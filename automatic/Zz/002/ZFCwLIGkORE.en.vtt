00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:12.210
 Hello dear friends 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.389
 marakasi today would like to tell you 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.840
 about a tank like fcm 50 tons is 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.699
 premium tank of the eighth level 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:23.340
 it differs from its competitors 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:26.460
 so that he has a good exact and 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.910
 quick gun with excellent 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:33.600
 breaking through and also gorgeous speed but 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:37.920
 while the cardboard armor is huge in size 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:40.399
 and also high crit and suit modules 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.559
 so many novice players 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:46.620
 make a lot of mistakes on this tank and 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.690
 so that the best newbies play fcm all 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.250
 tone i will try to tell how to 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.160
 act on this tank 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.309
 where better to go to realize the benefits 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.039
 and level the cons of this difficult 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.469
 cars as I think, but if competently 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.600
 act on fcm 50 tons then he doesn't 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:07.260
 will only bring a lot of silver 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:10.170
 to its owner but also will 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.780
 bring pleasure and you could see 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.850
 that I stood behind everyone for a long time 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.210
 although my speed allowed me to fly 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:21.060
 fastest ahead but i didn't 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:25.409
 for one reason because for enemies 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:28.590
 fcm 50 tons is a fat tasty croissant 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:32.759
 everybody wants to destroy this tank all on 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:36.689
 it is very very hot out there trying 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.729
 get out even at the cost of losing FPS and inflict 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.850
 damage to this tank and all one by one 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:45.180
 reason because he has a cardboard 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:48.140
 armor therefore at the beginning of the battle I didnâ€™t climb 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:51.000
 looked at the minimap collected information 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:54.240
 watched where the opponents were 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.960
 how many of them are they are dangerous stand up to go 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:01.079
 to attack and only then when I already understood 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.299
 exactly what I need to act 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.369
 flew and began to use his 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:08.280
 dpm speed and all the rest 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.709
 positive qualities I'm by no means 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.560
 I donâ€™t mean that you need this tank 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:16.140
 always use as pt stand there 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.140
 constantly on it in the bushes but sometimes 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:22.340
 you need to do this especially at the beginning of the battle 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.840
 wait to gather information where 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.450
 there are opponents and then already 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.730
 act 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:32.450
 but unfortunately in randomness very often 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:35.370
 there are such situations that the players 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:38.010
 acts on their tanks absolutely not 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:41.220
 because you need someone there 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:44.640
 on an IS-3 heavy tank in the bushes 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:48.269
 hiding there fcm 50 he for panties 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:52.260
 someone at all there I do not know is based on 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:55.830
 In general, itâ€™s hard to rely on random 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:59.129
 command and it often brings you because 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.940
 that it is 70 tons it depends very much 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:02.220
 from the team 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:05.159
 how will she play because he can't 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:08.220
 perform the role of such a tank which 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:10.950
 will tank go ahead he just 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:13.620
 for this is not created so I recommend 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.879
 play in platoon with such tanks as from 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.480
 6,112 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:21.269
 and apt-5 fcm perfectly complements these tanks 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:24.930
 thanks to its good speed review 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:28.319
 and dpm y well and also these tanks 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:30.720
 get to maximum level nine but 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:33.390
 do not think that fcm 50 he is 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:36.209
 helpless and he himself do nothing 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:38.400
 maybe without allies this tank is quite 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:41.540
 can drag especially on open maps 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:44.129
 towards the end of the fight because he has 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:47.250
 superior speed he can quickly 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:50.159
 move around the map borrow some 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:53.239
 tricky positions to troll opponents 

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:56.370
 he has a great weapon 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:58.319
 accurate rate of fire with good 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:02.099
 breaking through 212 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:04.860
 well, and there is also an overview of 400 meters 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:07.860
 allows us to highlight ourselves 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:10.760
 and shoot from afar and just thanks 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:14.549
 With all this plus I managed 1 to base 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:16.650
 opponents are trying to grab it here 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:19.139
 already received on of course but you know what 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:21.600
 you need to play here correctly shoot down 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:23.670
 capture what I basically do 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.650
 and just the potential of this tank 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:28.640
 reveals mostly closer 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:32.250
 the end of the battle of course and at the beginning of the battle you can 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:34.920
 much useful to do on fcm but need 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:37.560
 play more carefully not to risk and in 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:39.900
 Mostly I think because this 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:43.050
 the tank does not at all forgive mistakes 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:46.320
 you can be set on fire there to criticize 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:50.040
 ammo immediately some more models and in 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:53.010
 in the end you will already be completely like that 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:55.380
 useless if you make a mistake at the beginning of the battle 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:58.860
 so on this tank you need to act 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:01.320
 well, surely many will ask what 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:03.750
 does it mean to play well 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:06.390
 I personally think it means to play from 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:10.410
 situations depending on the setup 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:13.980
 enemy cards from the period of combat from 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:16.370
 is there an orton from what are the advantages of 

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:18.450
 the opponent how best against him 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:21.030
 counteract and from many others 

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:23.610
 factors all in one video and not 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:26.040
 tell it so there will be other videos 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:28.350
 I want to give you some more useful 

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:31.050
 tips that will let you better 

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:33.240
 play fcm 50 tons first 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:35.880
 try to avoid near frontal 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:39.150
 shootouts especially with armored 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:42.510
 For example, by tanks, imagine a situation that 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:44.820
 if you shoot out with 6 or sisters 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:47.910
 then he will most likely punch you 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:49.620
 every shot plus will very often 

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:52.830
 break you all sorts of modules 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:53.520
 especially ammo and will often 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:56.280
 set fire 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:59.190
 you will not always punch him well 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:01.140
 very often but still some 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:04.200
 non-penetration and ricochets 

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:07.230
 it is best to choose such positions so that 

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:09.540
 Shoot enemies from far or medium 

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:13.020
 distances in which case you implement 

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:15.900
 the soles of his instrument namely fast 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:18.510
 mixing but true as you are for sure 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:20.310
 know in our game there are such cases 

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:24.360
 what any 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:28.140
 the player on the Soviet tank just rides out 

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:32.100
 the guard there on the move from 400 meters 

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:35.169
 throws breaks and fires your ammo laying 

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:36.969
 and all that well, and the last 

00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:39.370
 advice use your speed 

00:06:36.969 --> 00:06:42.569
 take some interesting but 

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:46.800
 safe positions from where you can 

00:06:42.569 --> 00:06:49.749
 shell a large area well and 

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:53.310
 play of course very carefully on this 

00:06:49.749 --> 00:06:56.199
 tank and that's basically everything will be 

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:59.729
 probably still the second video on fcm all 

00:06:56.199 --> 00:07:02.529
 tons if you like it of course and 

00:06:59.729 --> 00:07:04.930
 ends up killing me 

00:07:02.529 --> 00:07:08.560
 super pershing though i saw that i have 

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:10.419
 hepe must be enough to survive but he 

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:13.360
 i 'm looking set on fire that is i'm not 

00:07:10.419 --> 00:07:16.620
 lucky and not getting me a warrior but not 

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:19.089
 less as I think the result is worthy 

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:22.419
 I hope you enjoyed the fight 

00:07:19.089 --> 00:07:25.270
 I wish you all the best with you 

00:07:22.419 --> 00:07:29.729
