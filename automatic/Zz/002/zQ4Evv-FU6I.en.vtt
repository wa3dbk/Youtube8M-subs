00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
is that the earlier motorcycles were

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.669 
is that the earlier motorcycles were
more<00:01:25.520> organic<00:01:26.090> they<00:01:26.450> are<00:01:26.780> better<00:01:27.440> looking

they<00:01:28.009> they<00:01:28.459> don't<00:01:28.640> of<00:01:28.880> course<00:01:29.149> handle<00:01:29.509> as<00:01:29.660> well

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:29.690 
they they don't of course handle as well

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.290

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
idea is that we created a ladder and a

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:11.069 
idea is that we created a ladder and a

progression to develop the young talent

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:14.030 
progression to develop the young talent
we<00:03:11.560> think<00:03:11.799> that<00:03:11.859> that<00:03:12.189> motorcycle<00:03:13.120> racing<00:03:13.510> has

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
we think that that motorcycle racing has

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.890 
we think that that motorcycle racing has
like<00:03:15.040> a<00:03:15.069> lot<00:03:15.310> of<00:03:15.340> things<00:03:15.579> over<00:03:16.090> the<00:03:16.299> last<00:03:16.389> ten

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
like a lot of things over the last ten

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.089 
like a lot of things over the last ten
years<00:03:18.000> probably<00:03:19.000> not<00:03:19.120> had<00:03:19.689> the<00:03:20.170> focus<00:03:20.950> that

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:21.099 
years probably not had the focus that

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:24.809 
years probably not had the focus that
might<00:03:21.400> have<00:03:21.549> had<00:03:21.879> and<00:03:22.239> it<00:03:23.079> through<00:03:23.680> using<00:03:24.519> the

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:24.819 
might have had and it through using the

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:30.030 
might have had and it through using the
new<00:03:24.970> media<00:03:25.359> in<00:03:25.680> social<00:03:26.680> media<00:03:27.090> and<00:03:29.040> other

new media in social media and other

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.710 
new media in social media and other
forms<00:03:30.370> of<00:03:30.489> distribution<00:03:31.120> we<00:03:31.239> feel<00:03:31.449> like<00:03:31.540> we

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
forms of distribution we feel like we

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.930 
forms of distribution we feel like we
can<00:03:31.840> rekindle<00:03:32.260> some<00:03:32.620> of<00:03:32.709> this<00:03:32.799> and<00:03:33.400> give<00:03:33.639> young

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
can rekindle some of this and give young

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.539 
can rekindle some of this and give young
people<00:03:33.970> platform<00:03:34.810> to<00:03:34.900> move<00:03:35.049> up<00:03:35.230> and<00:03:35.379> racing<00:03:35.799> so

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:36.549 
people platform to move up and racing so

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:38.400 
people platform to move up and racing so
all<00:03:36.699> these<00:03:36.819> things<00:03:36.879> will<00:03:37.269> I<00:03:37.510> think<00:03:37.840> come

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
all these things will I think come

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.369 
all these things will I think come
together<00:03:38.709> at<00:03:38.859> some<00:03:39.040> point<00:03:39.370> and<00:03:40.260> you<00:03:41.260> know

00:03:41.369 --> 00:03:41.379 
together at some point and you know

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:44.159 
together at some point and you know
people<00:03:41.739> need<00:03:42.069> to<00:03:42.359> they're<00:03:43.359> looking<00:03:43.540> for<00:03:43.750> ways

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:44.169 
people need to they're looking for ways

to go out and to kind of connect again

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:49.530 
to go out and to kind of connect again
rather<00:03:47.530> than<00:03:47.620> get<00:03:47.919> into<00:03:48.129> a<00:03:48.159> car<00:03:48.519> that<00:03:48.549> I<00:03:49.000> mean
