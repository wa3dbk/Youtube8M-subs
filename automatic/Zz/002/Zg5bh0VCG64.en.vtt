abstract layers and whatnot you know it

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.930 
abstract layers and whatnot you know it
and<00:00:51.989> in<00:00:52.710> there<00:00:52.890> in<00:00:53.070> that<00:00:53.160> whole<00:00:53.429> frame<00:00:53.670> of<00:00:53.820> mind

that's what they are and I thought that

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.149 
that's what they are and I thought that
would<00:00:59.070> be<00:00:59.129> fascinating<00:00:59.460> like<00:00:59.969> this<00:01:00.149> for<00:01:01.159> this

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:02.159 
would be fascinating like this for this

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:04.880 
would be fascinating like this for this
is<00:01:02.699> a<00:01:02.730> very<00:01:03.449> good<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.140> pre<00:01:04.379> don't<00:01:04.769> like

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
give an example think of the example

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:44.740 
give an example think of the example
sure<00:01:36.619> like<00:01:38.240> kind<00:01:39.240> of<00:01:39.299> very<00:01:39.740> RZA<00:01:40.740> ish<00:01:42.950> p<00:01:43.950> it's<00:01:44.310> a

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
sure like kind of very RZA ish p it's a

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.880 
sure like kind of very RZA ish p it's a
something<00:01:45.750> i<00:01:45.810> call<00:01:45.960> micro<00:01:46.439> loop<00:01:46.880> because<00:01:47.880> it

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
something i call micro loop because it

00:01:48.890 --> 00:02:19.980 
something i call micro loop because it
just<00:01:49.890> builds<00:01:50.159> off<00:01:50.369> well

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.500 

suction<00:02:20.320> I<00:02:20.640> noticed<00:02:21.640> likes<00:02:21.850> and<00:02:22.120> I<00:02:22.180> could<00:02:22.360> go

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
suction I noticed likes and I could go

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:46.660 
suction I noticed likes and I could go
back<00:02:22.690> hypnotic<00:02:23.440> and<00:02:24.070> you<00:02:24.250> know

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:52.510 

so<00:02:47.670> um<00:02:48.350> but<00:02:49.350> as<00:02:49.440> far<00:02:49.530> as<00:02:49.590> the<00:02:49.740> GD<00:02:49.980> it<00:02:50.340> came<00:02:50.580> to<00:02:50.760> me

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:52.520 
so um but as far as the GD it came to me

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.950 
so um but as far as the GD it came to me
this<00:02:53.520> kind<00:02:53.700> of<00:02:53.760> game<00:02:53.850> is<00:02:53.970> hard<00:02:54.210> to<00:02:54.360> almost

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960 
this kind of game is hard to almost

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.570 
this kind of game is hard to almost
remember<00:02:55.320> exactly<00:02:55.650> when<00:02:55.950> because<00:02:56.310> it<00:02:56.460> was<00:02:56.550> a

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
remember exactly when because it was a

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:57.920 
remember exactly when because it was a
gradual<00:02:57.000> thing<00:02:57.090> the<00:02:57.420> beginning<00:02:57.720> I<00:02:57.900> thought

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
gradual thing the beginning I thought

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.360
