00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.479
 of loneliness 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.760

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:35.820
 that there are almost no cars and besides it is 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.820
 super fast since it's all straight 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:44.060
 just to go 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:47.060

 I recommend you go very fast 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:55.180
 Today is another area other than this 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:57.610
 because you can what it would be to die 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:00.660
 then good 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.660
 but know 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.540
 hey 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:14.620
 let's stay 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:17.310
 12 km one kilometer 70 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.310
 and good 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:27.050
 already the curves begin and by one of 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:29.500
 I've lost my bugatti thanks 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.500
 curves 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.480
 as we will not keep going up 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:54.280
 and good 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:55.730
 at this time nor with his fucking mother of 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:00.200
 bitch 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.200
 and there are all the plantations 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:11.950
 let pulls up up up up up it is 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.400
 here in the house is on the right side 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.400
 OK 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:24.959
 normally you have to be here in this 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:27.840
 put but right now it is not then 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:31.980
 well as you can see here there are more cars and 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:35.010
 more shits of cars then we go to 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:37.849
 take a turn and now we see again if 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.849

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.340
 no no 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:48.460
 the plague there is no longer where I can see 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:55.659
 I think this is a racing car 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:55.659
 in an all-terrain car by God 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:08.180
 what I do not know is how many of them 

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:08.180
 cars with me let's see if they are already 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:15.330
 but this is to try until you're 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:19.489
 OK 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:19.489
 since there is no other place 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.600
 we go here we go back 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.870

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:43.950

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:47.240

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:50.539

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:54.069
 it has stayed like a little bit fac and 

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:54.069
 let's see let's see here 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.990
 let's see up 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:19.490
 hello to rich who happens you have an owl a 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:22.000
 a stroller out there for me 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:27.220

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.220
 indestructible uncle the trees 

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:32.540
 and it is as you see it has reappeared 

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:42.060
 and here we have the step 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.060
 well worth it 

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:48.540
 and I hope to continue testing until 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.540
 appear worth 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:57.600

 discovering to see if I can discover 

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:19.460
 something more than some car 

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:22.870
 to know where it is but I think that 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:22.870

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:29.990
 a video about exactly where it is 

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:31.310

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:33.140

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:35.980
