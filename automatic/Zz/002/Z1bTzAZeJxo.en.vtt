hi<00:00:00.480> guys<00:00:01.520> this<00:00:02.520> is<00:00:02.669> a<00:00:02.700> good<00:00:02.970> example<00:00:03.090> of<00:00:03.629> how<00:00:03.780> my

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
hi guys this is a good example of how my

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.079 
hi guys this is a good example of how my
mind<00:00:04.410> can<00:00:04.920> switch<00:00:05.279> from<00:00:05.310> one<00:00:05.790> thing<00:00:06.029> to

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
mind can switch from one thing to

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.680 
mind can switch from one thing to
another<00:00:06.270> quite<00:00:06.779> easily<00:00:07.020> I<00:00:08.690> originally

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
another quite easily I originally

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.270 
another quite easily I originally
started<00:00:10.019> going<00:00:10.500> through<00:00:10.559> my<00:00:11.030> bits<00:00:12.030> and<00:00:12.269> pieces

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:13.280 
started going through my bits and pieces

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.090 
started going through my bits and pieces
because<00:00:14.280> I<00:00:14.519> was<00:00:14.730> going<00:00:14.880> to<00:00:14.940> use<00:00:15.710> this<00:00:16.710> wire

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
because I was going to use this wire

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:23.390 
because I was going to use this wire
here<00:00:18.320> which<00:00:19.320> is<00:00:19.560> from<00:00:19.770> our<00:00:19.920> hair<00:00:20.310> dryer<00:00:22.400> it's

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
here which is from our hair dryer it's

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.759 
here which is from our hair dryer it's
that<00:00:23.609> sort<00:00:23.820> of<00:00:23.939> wire<00:00:24.180> that<00:00:24.420> you<00:00:24.539> can<00:00:24.750> heat<00:00:25.740> up

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
that sort of wire that you can heat up

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:32.540 
that sort of wire that you can heat up
and<00:00:26.340> use<00:00:27.210> for<00:00:27.599> a<00:00:28.070> hot<00:00:29.070> wire<00:00:29.340> foam<00:00:29.369> cutter<00:00:31.550> so

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
and use for a hot wire foam cutter so

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.010 
and use for a hot wire foam cutter so
that's<00:00:33.120> where<00:00:33.300> I<00:00:33.329> started<00:00:34.050> going<00:00:35.690> then<00:00:36.690> found

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
that's where I started going then found

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:43.940 
that's where I started going then found
some<00:00:37.290> of<00:00:37.410> my<00:00:37.640> nano<00:00:38.640> copper<00:00:39.030> bits<00:00:41.510> and<00:00:42.680> I<00:00:43.680> then

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
some of my nano copper bits and I then

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.380 
some of my nano copper bits and I then
remembered<00:00:44.640> that<00:00:45.680> pirate<00:00:46.680> Carribean<00:00:47.670> I<00:00:48.000> think

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
remembered that pirate Carribean I think

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.170 
remembered that pirate Carribean I think
he<00:00:48.510> calls<00:00:48.750> himself<00:00:49.340> suggested<00:00:50.340> I<00:00:50.789> should<00:00:51.000> make

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
he calls himself suggested I should make

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.639 
he calls himself suggested I should make
a<00:00:51.210> car<00:00:51.600> using<00:00:52.410> a<00:00:53.660> candle<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:55.140> Peltier

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
a car using a candle and a Peltier

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:01.580 
a car using a candle and a Peltier
mobile<00:00:56.340> module<00:00:58.579> and<00:00:59.579> I<00:00:59.730> thought<00:00:59.910> well<00:01:00.590> that

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
mobile module and I thought well that

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.050 
mobile module and I thought well that
little<00:01:01.920> motor<00:01:02.100> there<00:01:02.609> off<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.180> end<00:01:03.570> of<00:01:03.809> the

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:05.060 
little motor there off the end of the

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:10.310 
little motor there off the end of the
nano<00:01:06.060> copter<00:01:08.119> if<00:01:09.119> I<00:01:09.270> stick<00:01:09.510> a<00:01:09.540> wheel<00:01:09.840> on<00:01:10.170> the

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
nano copter if I stick a wheel on the

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:18.890 
nano copter if I stick a wheel on the
shaft<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:12.350> then<00:01:14.060> use<00:01:15.060> my<00:01:15.299> Peltier<00:01:16.080> tile<00:01:17.900> had

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
shaft and then use my Peltier tile had

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.310 
shaft and then use my Peltier tile had
laying<00:01:19.200> around<00:01:19.380> here<00:01:20.930> there'll<00:01:21.930> probably<00:01:21.990> be

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
laying around here there'll probably be

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.950 
laying around here there'll probably be
enough<00:01:22.710> power<00:01:23.070> generated<00:01:23.820> from<00:01:23.850> that<00:01:24.090> with<00:01:24.930> a

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
enough power generated from that with a

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.810 
enough power generated from that with a
candle<00:01:27.020> to<00:01:28.020> run<00:01:28.200> that<00:01:28.409> little<00:01:28.560> motor<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:29.670> with

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
candle to run that little motor and with

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.920 
candle to run that little motor and with
that<00:01:30.030> gearing<00:01:30.570> it<00:01:30.689> ought<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:31.110> run<00:01:31.290> that<00:01:31.950> wheel

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
that gearing it ought to run that wheel

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.840 
that gearing it ought to run that wheel
and<00:01:33.930> push<00:01:34.259> a<00:01:34.290> car<00:01:34.650> along<00:01:34.979> if<00:01:35.250> I<00:01:35.340> keep<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.670> car

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
and push a car along if I keep the car

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.520 
and push a car along if I keep the car
light<00:01:36.180> enough<00:01:36.979> so<00:01:37.979> I've<00:01:38.729> got<00:01:38.939> this<00:01:39.119> little

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
light enough so I've got this little

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.590 
light enough so I've got this little
plastic<00:01:40.530> car<00:01:41.070> that<00:01:41.790> originally<00:01:42.240> had<00:01:42.360> a<00:01:42.390> little

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
plastic car that originally had a little

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.580 
plastic car that originally had a little
pullback<00:01:43.200> motor<00:01:43.229> in<00:01:43.770> it<00:01:44.600> my<00:01:45.600> plan<00:01:45.899> is<00:01:46.530> to

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
pullback motor in it my plan is to

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.830 
pullback motor in it my plan is to
convert<00:01:47.070> that<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.369> a<00:01:47.640> three<00:01:48.030> wheeler<00:01:50.600> if<00:01:51.600> that

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
convert that to a three wheeler if that

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.749 
convert that to a three wheeler if that
wheel<00:01:52.670> sticking<00:01:53.670> out<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:54.000> middle<00:01:54.240> of<00:01:54.360> it<00:01:54.509> to

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
wheel sticking out the middle of it to

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:00.200 
wheel sticking out the middle of it to
push<00:01:56.759> it<00:01:56.909> along

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.250 

stick<00:02:01.210> a<00:02:01.240> tea<00:02:01.540> light<00:02:01.750> on<00:02:02.080> the<00:02:02.380> back<00:02:02.530> there<00:02:02.830> and

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:04.260 
stick a tea light on the back there and

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.840 
stick a tea light on the back there and
have<00:02:05.260> a<00:02:05.320> little<00:02:05.560> bracket<00:02:06.070> over<00:02:06.220> the<00:02:06.400> top<00:02:06.610> of<00:02:06.640> it

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
have a little bracket over the top of it

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.200 
have a little bracket over the top of it
so<00:02:07.120> it<00:02:07.240> heats<00:02:07.360> up<00:02:07.660> the<00:02:07.780> Peltier<00:02:08.229> tile<00:02:09.210> now

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.210 
so it heats up the Peltier tile now

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:12.050 
so it heats up the Peltier tile now
these<00:02:10.390> work<00:02:10.690> a<00:02:10.840> lot<00:02:11.020> better<00:02:11.290> if<00:02:11.530> you've<00:02:11.680> got<00:02:11.830> a

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
these work a lot better if you've got a

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.440 
these work a lot better if you've got a
heatsink<00:02:13.060> on<00:02:13.900> the<00:02:14.080> opposite<00:02:14.440> side<00:02:15.180> but<00:02:16.180> I

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
heatsink on the opposite side but I

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.930 
heatsink on the opposite side but I
don't<00:02:16.930> think<00:02:17.350> I've<00:02:17.740> got<00:02:17.980> a<00:02:18.010> heatsink<00:02:18.520> laying

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
don't think I've got a heatsink laying

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.360 
don't think I've got a heatsink laying
around<00:02:19.090> anywhere<00:02:19.660> at<00:02:19.810> the<00:02:19.870> moment<00:02:20.230> so<00:02:21.130> it'll

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
around anywhere at the moment so it'll

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.780 
around anywhere at the moment so it'll
just<00:02:21.610> have<00:02:21.790> to<00:02:22.080> heat<00:02:23.080> up<00:02:23.110> and<00:02:23.560> make<00:02:24.400> do<00:02:24.610> with

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
just have to heat up and make do with

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.210 
just have to heat up and make do with
natural<00:02:25.180> air<00:02:25.390> convection<00:02:26.140> so<00:02:26.770> it's<00:02:26.920> not<00:02:27.070> going

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
natural air convection so it's not going

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.480 
natural air convection so it's not going
to<00:02:27.280> be<00:02:27.340> as<00:02:27.460> powerful<00:02:27.970> as<00:02:28.060> it<00:02:28.090> could<00:02:28.360> be<00:02:29.490> but

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
to be as powerful as it could be but

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:32.060 
to be as powerful as it could be but
that's<00:02:30.670> the<00:02:30.850> plan

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
that's the plan

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.340 
that's the plan
just<00:02:33.070> very<00:02:33.250> quickly<00:02:33.550> going<00:02:33.910> back<00:02:34.180> to<00:02:34.390> the<00:02:34.540> hot

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
just very quickly going back to the hot

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.160 
just very quickly going back to the hot
wire<00:02:35.730> cutter<00:02:36.730> I<00:02:37.060> will<00:02:37.390> eventually<00:02:37.660> get<00:02:37.960> around

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
wire cutter I will eventually get around

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.230 
wire cutter I will eventually get around
to<00:02:38.350> making<00:02:38.470> that<00:02:38.830> I've<00:02:39.280> only<00:02:39.460> been<00:02:39.640> planning

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.240 
to making that I've only been planning

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.700 
to making that I've only been planning
to<00:02:40.270> do<00:02:40.450> it<00:02:40.570> for<00:02:40.720> about<00:02:40.870> two<00:02:41.110> years<00:02:41.350> now

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:49.020 

under<00:02:44.710> there<00:02:44.920> is<00:02:45.490> a<00:02:45.990> solar<00:02:46.990> panel<00:02:47.910> that<00:02:48.910> you

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
under there is a solar panel that you

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.690 
under there is a solar panel that you
use<00:02:49.240> for<00:02:49.480> charging<00:02:49.990> a<00:02:50.080> 12-volt<00:02:50.650> battery<00:02:51.190> or

volt<00:02:55.030> battery<00:02:55.090> sitting<00:02:55.900> down<00:02:56.110> in<00:02:56.320> my<00:02:56.500> shed

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
volt battery sitting down in my shed

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.290 
volt battery sitting down in my shed
that's<00:02:58.930> one<00:02:59.650> of<00:02:59.740> my<00:02:59.830> relatives<00:03:00.040> gave<00:03:00.550> me<00:03:00.820> I've

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
that's one of my relatives gave me I've

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.979 
that's one of my relatives gave me I've
just<00:03:01.330> tested<00:03:02.110> the<00:03:02.670> output<00:03:03.670> on<00:03:03.820> it<00:03:03.970> and<00:03:04.150> it's

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
just tested the output on it and it's

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:07.170 
just tested the output on it and it's
been<00:03:05.140> sitting<00:03:05.350> there<00:03:05.500> for<00:03:06.160> probably<00:03:06.940> a<00:03:07.150> year

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
been sitting there for probably a year

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.630 
been sitting there for probably a year
and<00:03:07.720> it's<00:03:07.989> still<00:03:08.080> giving<00:03:08.470> me<00:03:08.500> 12<00:03:09.130> point<00:03:09.400> 3

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
and it's still giving me 12 point 3

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.080 
and it's still giving me 12 point 3
volts<00:03:10.060> so<00:03:10.239> I<00:03:10.270> think<00:03:10.360> it's<00:03:10.600> a<00:03:10.660> good<00:03:10.810> battery<00:03:12.090> so

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
volts so I think it's a good battery so

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.900 
volts so I think it's a good battery so
that<00:03:13.830> will<00:03:14.830> be<00:03:14.950> something<00:03:15.160> else<00:03:15.400> that<00:03:15.670> I'll<00:03:15.790> be

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
that will be something else that I'll be

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.990 
that will be something else that I'll be
doing<00:03:16.180> but<00:03:16.810> tonight<00:03:17.250> this<00:03:18.250> will<00:03:18.430> be<00:03:18.489> one<00:03:18.760> of<00:03:18.880> my

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
doing but tonight this will be one of my

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.660 
doing but tonight this will be one of my
I<00:03:19.330> think<00:03:19.780> I<00:03:19.930> call<00:03:20.140> them<00:03:20.320> Frankenstein<00:03:23.220> cars<00:03:24.220> or

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
I think I call them Frankenstein cars or

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.610 
I think I call them Frankenstein cars or
Frankenstein<00:03:25.570> projects<00:03:26.230> where<00:03:26.380> I<00:03:26.410> put

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
Frankenstein projects where I put

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.280 
Frankenstein projects where I put
together<00:03:26.770> bits<00:03:27.190> from<00:03:28.150> completely<00:03:28.720> unrelated

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
together bits from completely unrelated

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.690 
together bits from completely unrelated
items<00:03:32.290> and<00:03:32.680> try<00:03:33.040> and<00:03:33.160> make<00:03:33.250> something<00:03:33.519> that

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
items and try and make something that

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.780 
items and try and make something that
works<00:03:34.000> out<00:03:34.269> of<00:03:34.390> them<00:03:34.510> so<00:03:35.370> this<00:03:36.370> will<00:03:36.430> become<00:03:36.760> a

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
works out of them so this will become a

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.759 
works out of them so this will become a

I<00:04:12.450> think<00:04:13.450> I've<00:04:13.569> got<00:04:13.719> height<00:04:13.989> about<00:04:14.319> right<00:04:14.680> I

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
I think I've got height about right I

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.349 
I think I've got height about right I
should<00:04:16.750> use<00:04:16.930> this<00:04:17.549> galvanized<00:04:18.549> wire<00:04:18.880> to<00:04:19.209> make

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 
should use this galvanized wire to make

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:23.070 
should use this galvanized wire to make
up<00:04:19.539> little<00:04:19.810> frame<00:04:20.229> to<00:04:20.769> support<00:04:20.949> the<00:04:22.080> Peltier

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
up little frame to support the Peltier

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.990 
up little frame to support the Peltier
tile<00:04:24.030> when<00:04:25.030> it's<00:04:25.150> up<00:04:25.300> together<00:04:26.850> haven't<00:04:27.850> got<00:04:27.970> a

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
tile when it's up together haven't got a

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.469 
tile when it's up together haven't got a
tea<00:04:28.210> light<00:04:28.419> for<00:04:28.780> it<00:04:28.870> yet<00:04:29.080> if<00:04:29.500> I<00:04:29.590> hold<00:04:29.800> my

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:30.479 
tea light for it yet if I hold my

00:04:30.479 --> 00:05:04.710 
tea light for it yet if I hold my
soldering<00:04:31.479> iron<00:04:31.889> to<00:04:32.889> it

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:21.020 

visible

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.030 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:24.270 

so<00:05:22.030> we'll<00:05:22.900> replace<00:05:23.080> my<00:05:23.500> soldering<00:05:23.980> iron<00:05:24.250> with

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:24.280 
so we'll replace my soldering iron with

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:43.290 
so we'll replace my soldering iron with
a<00:05:24.430> tea<00:05:24.640> light<00:05:24.900> tea<00:05:25.900> light<00:05:26.110> in<00:05:26.320> place<00:05:42.300> that's

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:43.300 
a tea light tea light in place that's

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:46.680 
a tea light tea light in place that's
the<00:05:44.130> lighter<00:05:45.130> that<00:05:45.670> actually<00:05:46.030> pop<00:05:46.150> up<00:05:46.300> go<00:05:46.540> in

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:46.690 
the lighter that actually pop up go in

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:55.709 
the lighter that actually pop up go in
there

00:05:55.709 --> 00:05:55.719 

00:05:55.719 --> 00:06:05.339 

let's<00:05:56.719> go<00:05:56.990> under<00:05:57.919> there<00:06:00.789> yeah<00:06:02.680> it's<00:06:03.680> fine<00:06:04.400> so

00:06:05.339 --> 00:06:05.349 
let's go under there yeah it's fine so

00:06:05.349 --> 00:06:10.390 
let's go under there yeah it's fine so
that's<00:06:06.349> our<00:06:08.289> candle<00:06:09.289> powered<00:06:09.680> or<00:06:09.860> tea<00:06:10.159> light

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:10.400 
that's our candle powered or tea light

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:16.089 
that's our candle powered or tea light
powered<00:06:11.379> car<00:06:13.840> pretty<00:06:14.840> low<00:06:15.110> power<00:06:15.439> cuz<00:06:15.919> that's

00:06:16.089 --> 00:06:16.099 
powered car pretty low power cuz that's

00:06:16.099 --> 00:06:18.309 
powered car pretty low power cuz that's
stopped<00:06:16.520> on<00:06:16.729> a<00:06:16.759> little<00:06:17.150> bit<00:06:17.270> of<00:06:17.389> onion<00:06:18.229> even

00:06:18.309 --> 00:06:18.319 
stopped on a little bit of onion even

00:06:18.319 --> 00:06:22.089 
stopped on a little bit of onion even
nestled<00:06:18.770> on<00:06:18.800> the<00:06:18.919> floor<00:06:20.650> but<00:06:21.650> the<00:06:21.710> wheels

00:06:22.089 --> 00:06:22.099 
nestled on the floor but the wheels

00:06:22.099 --> 00:06:27.219 
nestled on the floor but the wheels
going<00:06:24.879> it<00:06:25.879> really<00:06:26.150> needs<00:06:26.330> a<00:06:26.419> proper<00:06:26.659> heat<00:06:26.930> sink

00:06:27.219 --> 00:06:27.229 
going it really needs a proper heat sink

00:06:27.229 --> 00:06:29.050 
going it really needs a proper heat sink
on<00:06:27.409> top<00:06:27.469> so<00:06:27.979> you<00:06:28.069> get<00:06:28.219> a<00:06:28.250> proper<00:06:28.610> difference

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:29.060 
on top so you get a proper difference

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:30.999 
on top so you get a proper difference
between<00:06:29.509> the<00:06:29.629> top<00:06:29.810> and<00:06:29.840> the<00:06:30.020> bottom<00:06:30.199> because

00:06:30.999 --> 00:06:31.009 
between the top and the bottom because

00:06:31.009 --> 00:06:34.059 
between the top and the bottom because
once<00:06:31.340> this<00:06:31.520> warms<00:06:31.909> up<00:06:32.060> on<00:06:32.240> top<00:06:32.830> then<00:06:33.830> you

00:06:34.059 --> 00:06:34.069 
once this warms up on top then you

00:06:34.069 --> 00:06:35.290 
once this warms up on top then you
haven't<00:06:34.219> got<00:06:34.310> the<00:06:34.520> temperature<00:06:34.729> difference

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:35.300 
haven't got the temperature difference

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:38.020 
haven't got the temperature difference
between<00:06:35.360> top<00:06:35.810> and<00:06:35.840> bottom
