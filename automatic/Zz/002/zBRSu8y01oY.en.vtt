00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 very good to all welcome in the 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.500
 video of teaching a top 5 of best 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.389
 games that are paid and that are 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.980
 available on the web play these games 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.210
 they are updated in 2014 so it has 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.610
 I tried to make them games that have 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.080
 recently launched and that are not very 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.539
 repetitively I could put you games 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.730
 as minecraft as the self that is the 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.680
 fruit ninja the road that you all know 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.269
 and that sure because they are going to 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.340
 interesting because for that and the best 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.619
 declared blake appear the first and 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.840
 we have games that are a little 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.790
 more different that are very good and that 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.670
 talk about everything for payment and that they are 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.500
 of 2014 so that's something that 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.430
 it has practically happened to me and said this 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.430
 let's start 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.400
 the first game we 're going to see is called 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:50.680
 the infiniti flight then a game of 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.390
 airplane simulator is a piece of game 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.550
 I mean it is a piece of game 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:57.610
 because they have so many airplanes we can 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.590
 control them with different cameras and already 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:02.739
 I say a lot of different aircraft 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:04.570
 whether it's passenger aircraft fighters is 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:05.800
 a very complete new topic because they have 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.509
 many options to buy the 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.460
 airplanes as if we were if we 

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:11.800
 we were the pilots really have them 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.440
 the lever has everything is as if a 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.280
 flight experience completely as 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.210
 if it were really 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.399
 then we can change the 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.530
 configurations of we are felix each of 

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:22.270
 day at night the different tracks what 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.680
 we can land and everything is very 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.930
 configurable and with a quality 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:29.729
 awesome so really that what 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.729
 I recommend and it is one of my favorites 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.400
 well then the next one we will see 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.320
 called the monument by the truth is that 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.869
 this is a piece of game at the level of 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.840
 think strategy design with 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.430
 minimalist design and what good is not going to 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.890
 to think is not going to do as a 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.540
 little bit of the coconut and also with a 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.830
 very easy game mechanics is 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.420
 simply that we have to move 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.000
 the parts of a castle to be able 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.399
 get to the princess and that the dam then 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.540
 with deadlines way to be able to rescue her like this 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.549
 Well, the truth is that there is simply 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.280
 to turn, you have to drag the 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:04.080
 different parts of the castle and with a 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.759
 algae sound that has a very good 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.100
 that makes us focus and that 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.170
 we live the game and whenever 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.489
 we give if you can pass the level 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.000
 truth is that a piece of egg and that 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.000
 I recommend 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.700
 the next game as I'm going to teach it 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.650
 call from directions the truth is that is 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.080
 in the second installment of this game already 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.880
 there was the first version of room and the 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.470
 truth is he has a note 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.450
 awesome on the google play I think that 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.610
 it is a note between 4.7 four points 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:35.060
 about 5 which is impressive 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.040
 then those strategy games are worth 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.420
 that we will have to resolve 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.800
 can a game of instinct we have 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.390
 that solving different puzzles a 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.720
 interactive game a game of 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:47.030
 puzzle in addition on a stage 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.920
 totally in three of these and the truth 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.170
 that it's very easy to handle it and 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.420
 with a very simple user interface 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.830
 and very addictive and so we have to go 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.780
 solving all the tests and 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.440
 solving all the mysteries of this 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.850
 game 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.780
 so this one also does not say it is 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.780
 a piece of game 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:05.239
 ah 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.760
 now to seal the game to that breaker 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.340
 good come ice breakers of comebacks 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.769
 long ago it's worth in the era of 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.659
 the Vikings then you are a man that 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:17.680
 has superpowers and can go cutting and 

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:20.950
 then so it 's a very funny game 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:23.170
 where you have more than 140 levels of 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:26.500
 pure action between different environments 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:28.810
 more than one site full of vikings trolls 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.760
 lethal attractions and a lot and in the 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.409
 pazo the only thing you have to do is go 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.000
 cutting and it 's global to be able to go 

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:35.829
 advancing and that the Vikings can 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.810
 go with the boats the truth is very 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:39.400
 entertaining that education is a game 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.140
 because from thinking because you have to 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.970
 do it with smart to go cutting 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.739
 alright and so his only mission is 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.349
 import ice and bring the Vikings 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:50.670
 as safe and sound to their destination as well 

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:50.670
 that is also a very, very good game 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.760
 and we will also measure in game 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:58.129
 good machinery in this game is 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.860
 also very good note on the web play 

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:03.830
 almost 5 has the maximum value then 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:05.510
 you are a robot that appears like this without 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:07.549
 no reason is worth a city 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:09.230
 questionable of imagines and very 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:11.659
 contaminated so little by little it's going to 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:14.360
 keep discovering the history of this 

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:16.910
 robot is a game then with a mixture of 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.919
 puzzles and adventure and you'll have to go 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:21.109
 recomposing and exceeding many 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:24.470
 new barriers that separate it from the 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:25.789
 city ​​is worth and his beloved companion and 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:26.840
 Well, this has been all for today and 

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:28.880
