00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
on a new iphone 4s that I got this will

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.569 
on a new iphone 4s that I got this will
soon<00:00:37.260> be<00:00:37.500> on<00:00:37.820> so<00:00:38.820> it's<00:00:39.270> a<00:00:39.480> silly<00:00:39.899> crellick<00:00:40.579> so

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
soon be on so it's a silly crellick so

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.100 
soon be on so it's a silly crellick so
has<00:00:41.969> silicone<00:00:42.329> and<00:00:43.340> acrylic<00:00:44.510> for<00:00:45.510> protection

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
has silicone and acrylic for protection

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.430 
has silicone and acrylic for protection
silicone<00:00:46.649> gives<00:00:46.920> it<00:00:47.100> that<00:00:47.129> a<00:00:48.440> rubbery

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
silicone gives it that a rubbery

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.819 
silicone gives it that a rubbery
non-slip<00:00:50.430> feel<00:00:50.879> so<00:00:51.840> it's<00:00:51.960> kind<00:00:52.170> of<00:00:52.230> a<00:00:52.379> in<00:00:52.590> the

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
non-slip feel so it's kind of a in the

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.350 
non-slip feel so it's kind of a in the
acrylic<00:00:53.370> is<00:00:54.770> kind<00:00:55.770> of<00:00:55.829> like<00:00:56.329> you<00:00:57.329> know

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
acrylic is kind of like you know

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.040 
acrylic is kind of like you know
plexiglass<00:00:58.550> lexan<00:00:59.550> is<00:00:59.760> i<00:01:00.180> think<00:01:00.420> is<00:01:00.930> the

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
plexiglass lexan is i think is the

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.319 
plexiglass lexan is i think is the
strongest<00:01:01.530> because<00:01:02.039> supposedly<00:01:02.940> they<00:01:03.180> use

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
strongest because supposedly they use

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.000 
strongest because supposedly they use
that<00:01:03.539> for<00:01:03.780> bulletproof<00:01:04.229> glass<00:01:05.540> but<00:01:06.540> hey<00:01:07.010> i'm

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
that for bulletproof glass but hey i'm

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.670 
that for bulletproof glass but hey i'm
sure<00:01:08.070> this<00:01:08.880> acrylic<00:01:09.180> will<00:01:09.479> work<00:01:09.630> just<00:01:09.900> fine<00:01:10.020> I

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
sure this acrylic will work just fine I

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.730 
sure this acrylic will work just fine I
think<00:01:11.610> acrylic<00:01:12.090> also<00:01:12.450> scratches<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.439> least

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
think acrylic also scratches the least

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.940 
think acrylic also scratches the least
so<00:01:14.340> anyway<00:01:15.119> this<00:01:16.020> is<00:01:16.229> it<00:01:16.409> I'm<00:01:16.590> going<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.799> unbox

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
so anyway this is it I'm going to unbox

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.940 
so anyway this is it I'm going to unbox
it<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.700> then<00:01:17.880> it<00:01:18.150> will<00:01:18.560> probably<00:01:19.560> take<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.860> few

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
it and then it will probably take a few

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.820 
it and then it will probably take a few
pictures<00:01:20.220> with<00:01:20.759> it<00:01:20.790> on<00:01:21.390> it<00:01:21.659> you're<00:01:22.619> going<00:01:22.740> to

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
pictures with it on it you're going to

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:30.050 
pictures with it on it you're going to
need<00:01:22.979> a<00:01:23.009> knife<00:01:23.869> to<00:01:24.869> open<00:01:24.900> this<00:01:28.850> my<00:01:29.850> usual

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060

why I bought it as a nice surface it's

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.390 
why I bought it as a nice surface it's
not<00:02:22.410> too<00:02:22.620> sticky<00:02:22.950> but<00:02:24.890> gives<00:02:25.890> it<00:02:25.980> a<00:02:26.070> little<00:02:26.220> bit

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
not too sticky but gives it a little bit

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.370 
not too sticky but gives it a little bit
more<00:02:26.520> grip<00:02:26.910> doesn't<00:02:27.450> make<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:27.690> phone<00:02:27.870> too<00:02:28.080> fat

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
more grip doesn't make the phone too fat

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:34.220 
more grip doesn't make the phone too fat
and<00:02:30.020> protects<00:02:31.020> the<00:02:31.110> camera<00:02:32.040> lens<00:02:32.160> which<00:02:33.230> for

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
me that's kind of a big thing because I

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.420 
me that's kind of a big thing because I
didn't<00:02:36.660> want<00:02:36.690> to<00:02:36.840> put<00:02:37.020> anything<00:02:37.230> over<00:02:37.470> it<00:02:37.770> cuz

cameras pretty clean so this will just

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.979 
cameras pretty clean so this will just
give<00:02:47.549> it<00:02:47.670> that<00:02:47.760> attic<00:02:48.090> protection<00:02:48.750> when<00:02:48.900> you

won't scratch the lens on your iPhone 4s

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:02.360 
won't scratch the lens on your iPhone 4s
you<00:03:01.049> know<00:03:01.110> the<00:03:01.260> design<00:03:01.620> doesn't<00:03:01.920> really<00:03:02.160> give

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
you know the design doesn't really give

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.360 
you know the design doesn't really give
much<00:03:02.549> protection<00:03:03.060> but<00:03:03.630> I<00:03:03.900> think<00:03:04.350> this<00:03:04.530> will

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
much protection but I think this will

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.340 
much protection but I think this will
work<00:03:05.430> out<00:03:05.820> pretty<00:03:05.970> well<00:03:06.060> so<00:03:06.870> anyway<00:03:07.170> that's

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
work out pretty well so anyway that's

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.580 
work out pretty well so anyway that's
enough<00:03:07.650> talk<00:03:07.890> and<00:03:09.260> maybe<00:03:10.260> I'll<00:03:10.410> take<00:03:10.560> a

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
enough talk and maybe I'll take a

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.490 
enough talk and maybe I'll take a
picture<00:03:10.739> of<00:03:11.010> this<00:03:11.100> thing<00:03:11.370> and<00:03:11.640> then<00:03:12.470> how<00:03:13.470> to

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
picture of this thing and then how to

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.740 
picture of this thing and then how to
probably<00:03:14.070> grab<00:03:14.280> another<00:03:14.519> camera<00:03:15.000> to<00:03:15.239> show<00:03:15.690> you

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
probably grab another camera to show you

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.259 
probably grab another camera to show you
what<00:03:15.959> it<00:03:16.049> looks<00:03:16.080> like<00:03:16.350> to<00:03:16.530> put<00:03:16.680> it<00:03:16.769> on<00:03:17.269> all

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:10.919 
it you just snap this thing in here I
