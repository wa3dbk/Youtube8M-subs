very very simple all you need is two
different<00:00:32.470> things<00:00:32.800> and<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:34.480> results<00:00:34.900> are

00:00:35.009 --> 00:00:35.019 
different things and the results are

00:00:35.019 --> 00:00:37.380 
different things and the results are

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.320 
Oh what you're going to need is a state

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.840 
Oh what you're going to need is a state
sensor<00:00:48.950> and<00:00:49.210> a<00:00:50.210> character<00:00:50.660> animation<00:00:51.230> Tweaker

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:51.850 
sensor and a character animation Tweaker

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.290 
sensor and a character animation Tweaker
it's<00:00:52.850> as<00:00:53.120> simple<00:00:53.420> as<00:00:53.690> that<00:00:53.870> okay<00:00:54.640> so<00:00:55.640> open<00:00:56.030> up

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
it's as simple as that okay so open up

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.070 
it's as simple as that okay so open up
the<00:00:56.420> circuit<00:00:56.780> board<00:00:57.020> on<00:00:57.200> your<00:00:58.090> sack<00:00:59.090> bot<00:00:59.360> put<00:00:59.930> a

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:00.080 
the circuit board on your sack bot put a

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:08.370 
the circuit board on your sack bot put a
microchip<00:01:00.590> in<00:01:01.120> add<00:01:02.650> your<00:01:03.650> state<00:01:04.339> sensor<00:01:06.310> and

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
microchip in add your state sensor and

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.290 
microchip in add your state sensor and
pull<00:01:09.380> this<00:01:09.560> down<00:01:09.800> so<00:01:10.160> it's<00:01:10.460> near<00:01:10.700> the<00:01:10.729> sack<00:01:11.030> pot

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:11.300 
pull this down so it's near the sack pot

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.680 
pull this down so it's near the sack pot
otherwise<00:01:12.110> the<00:01:12.350> animator<00:01:12.830> won't<00:01:13.430> work<00:01:13.690> pop

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:14.690 
otherwise the animator won't work pop

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.280 
otherwise the animator won't work pop
down<00:01:14.930> an<00:01:15.050> animator<00:01:16.540> okay<00:01:17.540> now<00:01:17.750> open<00:01:18.020> up<00:01:18.229> the

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 
down an animator okay now open up the

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.499 
down an animator okay now open up the
options<00:01:18.860> in<00:01:19.070> the<00:01:19.220> state<00:01:19.520> sensor<00:01:20.000> we're<00:01:20.360> going

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:20.509 
options in the state sensor we're going

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:24.190 
options in the state sensor we're going
to<00:01:20.570> choose<00:01:20.810> running<00:01:21.729> so<00:01:22.729> anytime<00:01:23.630> that<00:01:23.840> the

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
to choose running so anytime that the

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.680 
to choose running so anytime that the
sack<00:01:24.740> port<00:01:25.009> is<00:01:25.100> seen<00:01:25.340> running<00:01:25.580> you<00:01:26.330> will<00:01:26.420> play

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:26.690 
sack port is seen running you will play

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:28.660 
sack port is seen running you will play
whichever<00:01:27.350> animation<00:01:27.979> we<00:01:28.160> have<00:01:28.190> attached<00:01:28.520> it

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
whichever animation we have attached it

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.200 
whichever animation we have attached it
to<00:01:28.750> so<00:01:29.750> we're<00:01:29.869> going<00:01:29.960> to<00:01:30.080> choose<00:01:30.259> an<00:01:30.470> animation

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
to so we're going to choose an animation

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.690 
to so we're going to choose an animation
you<00:01:32.210> have<00:01:32.360> lots<00:01:32.660> to<00:01:33.170> choose<00:01:33.380> from<00:01:33.430> and<00:01:34.430> change

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
you have lots to choose from and change

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.170 
you have lots to choose from and change
from<00:01:35.259> zomball<00:01:36.259> to<00:01:36.500> whatever<00:01:36.710> I<00:01:37.160> find<00:01:38.000> that

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
from zomball to whatever I find that

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:39.670 
from zomball to whatever I find that
there's<00:01:38.360> a<00:01:38.420> lot<00:01:38.600> of<00:01:38.690> good<00:01:38.899> ones<00:01:39.050> if<00:01:39.380> you<00:01:39.500> scroll

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 
there's a lot of good ones if you scroll

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.540 
there's a lot of good ones if you scroll
all<00:01:39.920> the<00:01:39.950> way<00:01:40.130> down<00:01:40.460> to<00:01:40.670> the<00:01:40.759> one<00:01:41.950> there's<00:01:42.950> sack

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:43.550 
all the way down to the one there's sack

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.900 
all the way down to the one there's sack
bot<00:01:43.789> miscellaneous<00:01:44.690> and<00:01:44.930> in<00:01:45.289> here<00:01:45.700> after<00:01:46.700> all

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:46.910 
bot miscellaneous and in here after all

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:51.160 
bot miscellaneous and in here after all
the<00:01:47.259> emotes<00:01:48.259> are<00:01:48.590> pretty<00:01:49.429> good<00:01:49.840> ones<00:01:50.840> to<00:01:51.050> play

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
the emotes are pretty good ones to play

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.969 
the emotes are pretty good ones to play
with<00:01:51.729> they<00:01:52.729> have<00:01:52.849> swagger<00:01:53.360> why<00:01:53.569> not<00:01:53.830> so<00:01:54.830> he's

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
with they have swagger why not so he's

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:59.910 
with they have swagger why not so he's
going<00:01:55.160> to<00:01:55.220> swagger<00:01:55.550> to<00:01:55.849> walk<00:01:56.920> and<00:01:57.920> that<00:01:58.610> is<00:01:58.819> it

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
going to swagger to walk and that is it

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.460 
going to swagger to walk and that is it
now<00:02:00.920> when<00:02:01.160> you<00:02:01.250> go<00:02:01.399> in<00:02:01.610> and<00:02:01.819> you<00:02:02.330> run<00:02:02.599> the

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
now when you go in and you run the

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.630 
now when you go in and you run the
Swagger's<00:02:05.319> can<00:02:06.319> be<00:02:06.440> applied<00:02:06.770> to<00:02:07.250> anything

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
Swagger's can be applied to anything

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.660 
Swagger's can be applied to anything
from<00:02:08.119> jumping<00:02:08.869> to<00:02:09.259> falling<00:02:09.979> swimming

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
from jumping to falling swimming

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.390 
from jumping to falling swimming
climbing<00:02:11.650> so<00:02:12.650> we're<00:02:12.830> going<00:02:12.920> to<00:02:12.980> show<00:02:13.160> you<00:02:13.190> a

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
climbing so we're going to show you a

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.350 
climbing so we're going to show you a
jump<00:02:13.910> so<00:02:14.480> we<00:02:14.599> change<00:02:14.870> that<00:02:15.080> to<00:02:15.440> jumping<00:02:16.360> we'll

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
jump so we change that to jumping we'll

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.339 
jump so we change that to jumping we'll
change<00:02:17.599> the<00:02:17.780> animation<00:02:18.099> to<00:02:19.540> something<00:02:20.540> fairly

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:21.349 
change the animation to something fairly

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:36.850 
change the animation to something fairly
good<00:02:21.500> that<00:02:21.709> we<00:02:21.950> like<00:02:35.200> there<00:02:36.200> we<00:02:36.349> go<00:02:36.500> a<00:02:36.530> bit<00:02:36.739> of<00:02:36.800> a

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
good that we like there we go a bit of a

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.500 
good that we like there we go a bit of a
flip

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
flip

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.479 
flip
and<00:02:38.900> now<00:02:39.890> when<00:02:40.189> we<00:02:40.220> jump<00:02:40.610> we<00:02:40.939> do<00:02:41.060> that<00:02:41.239> flip<00:02:42.489> so

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
and now when we jump we do that flip so

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:46.149 
and now when we jump we do that flip so
backwards<00:02:43.879> flip<00:02:44.260> if<00:02:45.260> you<00:02:45.349> wanted<00:02:45.650> it<00:02:45.799> to<00:02:45.920> turn

00:02:46.149 --> 00:02:46.159 
backwards flip if you wanted it to turn

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:47.979 
backwards flip if you wanted it to turn
the<00:02:46.489> other<00:02:46.640> way<00:02:46.849> so<00:02:46.909> you<00:02:47.120> do<00:02:47.239> a<00:02:47.269> forwards<00:02:47.720> flip

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
the other way so you do a forwards flip

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:51.460 
the other way so you do a forwards flip
you<00:02:48.920> can<00:02:49.040> go<00:02:49.220> into<00:02:49.430> the<00:02:50.090> animation<00:02:50.510> settings

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
you can go into the animation settings

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.869 
you can go into the animation settings
and<00:02:52.569> the<00:02:53.569> animation<00:02:54.140> speed<00:02:54.319> turn<00:02:55.010> to<00:02:55.220> minus

00:02:55.869 --> 00:02:55.879 
and the animation speed turn to minus

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:59.920 
and the animation speed turn to minus
100%<00:02:56.329> thing<00:02:56.900> which<00:02:57.409> reverses<00:02:57.799> the<00:02:58.069> speed<00:02:58.930> well
