00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:09.480
 and then guys River here in this video will 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.240
 Talk about giovanna django 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:16.440
 in these 14 how am I doing the 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:19.170
 rounds but I've already put it on the screen and it's already 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:22.380
 I tried to do the same kind of damage with 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:27.019
 a contact such members and such 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:30.359
 Only I do not know, man. I always have it. 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:32.759
 stay tuned for fuck in it game 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.280
 Only then my team can not 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.800
 close the game you know we can not 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.510
 finish the game so that's why 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.210
 I stopped running from doing it with a 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.399
 damage by making him fo tank helping 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.930
 100 percent team and this is me 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.489
 leading to victory 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.410
 I think it 's like I played it 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:54.539
 normal games I've already won a game with 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:57.030
 he doing with it mid -year and tank 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.039
 only that only works if the team 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.379
 enemy surrender early in the game 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.539
 site for 20 minutes already gives surrender 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.090
 because the guys give up the game only 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.590
 for in platinum plucking cars 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.530
 Quit the game. 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.909
 Then you end up sinking in the milk game 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.430
 because I can not be a tank 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.799
 enough to give a digital gay because 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.500
 the hill is very fast when it goes 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:22.229
 so I can not burst their cab 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.150
 these things depends on the team, too. 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.340
 That's why I stopped doing damage. 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.040
 doing it's fine you can win 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.049
 several matches with him making a 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.290
 tank helper metal 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.960
 So I think it's taken from the 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.360
 less silver platinum I do not know but it's about 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.920
 that works out to platinum but was not 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.740
 getting no way so much is that 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.090
 I was in the sea in the fucking district I 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.680
 I could not win right away. 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.450
 I'm not going to make another video talking 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.189
 about this too but now I'm already 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.850
 being able to win I'm rising from 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:57.420
 good, easy 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:59.430
 and today his van is an excellent win 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.500
 He earns his fucking money. 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.780
 I chose this particular game for 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.690
 cause of that play there that we gave 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.869
 rebound that everyone died of changing or 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:12.870
 that the chicken is a triple or I do not know 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.550
 that we are losing was why 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.200
 I chose this game our orb game was 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.770
 too bad we started losing and 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.990
 but then take it light or six 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.420
 get a new boat got it for 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:27.110
 dinks din that is already kind of coming back 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:30.000
 game but we're still losing 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:32.130
 I want to show you that we just 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.850
 lost a game no matter the game does not 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:38.550
 It's over, the game is far from over yet. 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:40.650
 The game only ends when nexus falls until 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.930
 then the game is still worth any 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.900
 one can win 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:47.730
 and as the team was already better 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.490
 that we started doing 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:54.020
 a simple one but they tried to make a 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:56.880
 more aggressive and thanks to our 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:58.890
 Luckily we were able to see 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:02.070
 these bases and to capitalize on 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:04.170
 on top of their mistake, get the fuck out 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:07.850
 of police position now after 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.850
 I could order light to kill and such 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.580
 here our morgana telling him that 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.460
 She played well so I do not know what to do. 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:23.920
 so a negative attitude of this can 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:27.880
 see but still good that morgan also 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:32.370
 did not let himself be carried away by the 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.370
 Face there and still throwing sewage 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:39.080
 seek the passage was very forward and 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:40.670
 it ended up being loaned here to dengue 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.730
 because the pike was very close to the 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:45.440
 tower and just as I was and adins and I 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:48.410
 I'm very tank you can see that the 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:54.710
 Tango he's a fool and jeans can 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:56.840
 stay on beck line attacking and got 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:04:01.460
 give the ball very good because I came back 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:04.580
 to the vision of her nami trading 

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:06.100
 That's when I ended up in the bubble. 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:10.490
 going to the leaf 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:12.800
 But beauty then in our millennium was 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:17.030
 east and he can see what I 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:18.859
 I said rami is equally pro because 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:20.440
 That's precisely why he went there and 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:25.370
 he really was 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:26.840
 then our media but despite not 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.890
 knowing how to play media was playing a lot 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.930
 right here 

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:32.290
 thanks to the order of new people 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.790
 managed to get him out of position 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.860
 before she even attacked us, she already 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:40.280
 dengue was practically dead only 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:42.830
 arrived with the sepe killed she said that already 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.540
 is very good in the game is already back 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:52.430
 We have now been able to turn and already 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:56.270
 we are winning 0/7 respect the avaÃ­ 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:05:00.950
 but it worked out right in my 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:04.220
 flag on people's heads killed her already 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:06.860
 It's little if it's one is a very champion. 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:09.229
 because if she can get some 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:12.410
 she can carry hardware 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:15.710
 so my goal in this game is to protect 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:19.220
 she's just trying to get some 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:22.280
 someone out of position of course but on pf 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:25.640
 my main goal is to be protected 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:28.310
 the best you can do is stay on the river and 

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:30.140
 winning the guys are already faltering the 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:32.180
 my whole team along with the team rotation 

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:34.040
 was very good too after we 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:36.410
 got back to the game you can 

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:38.040
 see everyone always grouped and that's it 

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:41.190
 This is an error that 

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:44.040
 a lot of people do that is not stay together 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:47.310
 with the team if you are winning a lot 

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:50.640
 better you already group because you 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:53.780
 is stronger then the team in a fight 

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:58.340
 on a 5 x 5 tf they will not take it 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:06:01.440
 I used the clasp because I am the name 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:07.380
 need not have spent more east is 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:09.480
 see the state has only p 

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:12.720
 despite your team that does not have 

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:14.300
 Magic resistance and so no Adin 

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:16.440
 nor can change much by giving 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:19.950
 unfortunately died there because people 

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:22.200
 cloud but nothing the body like that 

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:24.720
 managed to take the tower there was 

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:28.170
 goal is right, she's our team 

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:33.120
 hesitated lieu tim the trash 

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:35.250
 but haia beauty after it was picked up was 

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:37.200
 I only managed to get there. 

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:40.740
 time to save her this fight we 

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:42.060
 won because aeni she could not 

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:44.430
 use nothing 

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:46.770
 I think the uncle of the January guy 

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:48.870
 but anyway she 's used to it there died 

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:50.640
 the fast 

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:53.190
 After that we just went to the 

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:55.410
 then the game ends only when the 

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:57.240
 I'm telling you guys beauty, that's what 

00:06:55.410 --> 00:07:00.120
 You liked that you subscribe to the 

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:02.510
 channel and we'll see you in the next video 

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:02.510
 thanks
