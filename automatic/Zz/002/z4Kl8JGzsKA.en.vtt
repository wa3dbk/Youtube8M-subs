00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
system at the end of it just became an

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.340 
system at the end of it just became an
obsession<00:01:22.939> my<00:01:23.939> film<00:01:24.210> talked<00:01:24.390> about<00:01:24.960> for<00:01:25.229> years

individual<00:01:38.729> artist<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:39.390> I<00:01:39.780> got<00:01:40.020> to<00:01:40.170> create<00:01:40.409> my

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
individual artist and I got to create my

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.800 
individual artist and I got to create my
entire<00:01:41.009> vision<00:01:41.280> myself<00:01:41.819> and<00:01:42.090> create<00:01:42.569> every

entire vision myself and create every

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.719 
entire vision myself and create every
aspect<00:01:43.229> of<00:01:43.350> it<00:01:43.499> probably<00:01:43.979> a<00:01:44.130> control<00:01:44.549> freak

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
aspect of it probably a control freak

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.179 
aspect of it probably a control freak
but<00:01:45.049> it<00:01:46.049> was<00:01:46.229> good<00:01:46.439> you're<00:01:46.619> allowed<00:01:46.859> to<00:01:47.009> do

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
but it was good you're allowed to do

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.240 
but it was good you're allowed to do
that

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.090 

when<00:01:50.700> it<00:01:50.790> came<00:01:50.940> to<00:01:51.090> working<00:01:51.270> by<00:01:51.510> myself<00:01:51.930> I<00:01:52.680> just

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
when it came to working by myself I just

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.360 
when it came to working by myself I just
found<00:01:53.490> that<00:01:53.880> was<00:01:54.390> just<00:01:54.720> working<00:01:55.170> for<00:01:55.409> me<00:01:55.620> and<00:01:55.890> I

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:56.370 
found that was just working for me and I

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.100 
found that was just working for me and I
could<00:01:56.550> find<00:01:56.850> all<00:01:57.150> the<00:01:57.300> tools<00:01:57.540> I<00:01:57.690> wanted<00:01:57.990> and

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
could find all the tools I wanted and

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.590 
could find all the tools I wanted and
everything<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:58.920> it<00:01:59.100> was<00:01:59.250> about<00:01:59.520> yeah<00:02:00.180> being

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
everything and it was about yeah being

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.060 
everything and it was about yeah being
an<00:02:00.810> individual<00:02:01.260> artist<00:02:01.590> and<00:02:01.830> getting<00:02:02.010> that

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
an individual artist and getting that

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.520 
an individual artist and getting that
individual<00:02:02.580> vision<00:02:03.270> out<00:02:03.479> there<00:02:03.510> as<00:02:04.140> opposed

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
individual vision out there as opposed

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.109 
individual vision out there as opposed
to<00:02:05.390> plugging<00:02:06.390> into<00:02:06.540> a<00:02:06.660> big<00:02:06.900> pipeline<00:02:07.170> nice<00:02:07.530> job

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
to plugging into a big pipeline nice job

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.520 
to plugging into a big pipeline nice job
yeah<00:02:09.119> it<00:02:09.300> was<00:02:09.390> freeing<00:02:09.720> in<00:02:09.869> some<00:02:10.080> way

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
yeah it was freeing in some way

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.480 
yeah it was freeing in some way
it's<00:02:11.070> interesting<00:02:11.370> how<00:02:11.640> my<00:02:12.330> short<00:02:12.660> film<00:02:12.930> has

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
it's interesting how my short film has

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.770 
it's interesting how my short film has
managed<00:02:14.490> to<00:02:14.550> strike<00:02:14.850> a<00:02:14.910> reasonable<00:02:15.540> chord

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
managed to strike a reasonable chord

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.260 
managed to strike a reasonable chord
with<00:02:15.959> people<00:02:16.380> and<00:02:16.670> they<00:02:17.670> find<00:02:17.940> it<00:02:18.030> interesting

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
with people and they find it interesting

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.160 
with people and they find it interesting
and<00:02:18.630> inspiring<00:02:18.810> I<00:02:19.470> think<00:02:20.250> that<00:02:20.610> comes<00:02:20.850> down<00:02:21.060> to

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
and inspiring I think that comes down to

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.780 
and inspiring I think that comes down to
just<00:02:22.170> sheer<00:02:22.620> perseverance<00:02:23.190> of<00:02:23.459> following

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
just sheer perseverance of following

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.470 
just sheer perseverance of following
your<00:02:24.150> own<00:02:24.209> vision<00:02:25.580> softened<00:02:26.580> with<00:02:26.700> the<00:02:27.120> 3d

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
your own vision softened with the 3d

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.030 
your own vision softened with the 3d
process<00:02:27.900> we<00:02:28.050> get<00:02:28.200> plugged<00:02:28.470> into<00:02:28.590> little<00:02:28.890> holes

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
process we get plugged into little holes

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.790 
process we get plugged into little holes
