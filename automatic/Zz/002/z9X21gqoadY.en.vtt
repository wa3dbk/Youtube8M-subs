 hello friends and friends welcome out 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.240
 some crafts today we're going 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.880
 to learn how to make a delicious pizza 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.480
 with very few ingredients of a 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.160
 super super easy way and believe me is left 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:17.699
 delicious that what we are going to need 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.939
 we're going to need salt wheat flour 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.590
 tomato puree a beer the 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.300
 ingredient of your preference for the 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.779
 pizza in this case we 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.990
 love this choricito ok is 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.540
 delicious and the secret ingredient the 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.460
 garlic prepared for the sauce that brings the 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.350
 tomato puree I tell you I know there 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.050
 many ways to prepare the basis of the 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.840
 pizza this is a super simple way 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.850
 the base is crunchy you have left 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.739
 delicious the truth since the 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.200
 we try we do not like to buy pizzas from 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.860
 the street because you get a fraction of the 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.660
 cost and it's delicious ok we're going to 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.489
 prepare the tomato puree first 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.260
 What we are going to do is put a sauté 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.150
 little of the prepared garlic that we already have 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.220
 I'm going to leave the link here 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:06.750
 since it is slightly golden brown 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.750
 let's put the tomato puree 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:12.060
 I always wear clothes 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:14.130
 Italian pasta pizza and all that 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.840
 take to ok 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.030
 that is the touch and I say to me I love 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.790
 garlic and apart super healthy if to you 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.970
 you do not like good garlic you can put it 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:26.880
 little bit down or put the garlic 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.460
 dehydrated garlic salt given so that 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.920
 give it a little flavor and there is what 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:35.910
 let's do it already is letting go of the 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:39.180
 boil the tomato puree that thickens 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:41.220
 a little bit and we're going to rectify the taste 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.290
 if we feel that you need a little 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.060
 of pepper we are going to take pepper 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:49.320
 let's take some oregano and 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:51.630
 let's have a little salt or consommé 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.130
 of chicken ok what you prefer little 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.710
 because remember that the cheese has 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.800
 much flavor and the chorizo ​​also carries 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:01.619
 Pretty flavor but peace the sauce yes 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:05.220
 It has to go with an unsalted taste but 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:07.619
 yes blunt ok ok then I'm going to 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.959
 as I say to throw the pepper 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.600
 oregano rectified if he needs a 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:14.040
 little chicken consommé left to thicken 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.900
 tantito and 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.219
 is now ready let's see how it 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.969
 make peace friends ready 

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:23.250
 now let's prepare the base the base 

00:02:20.969 --> 00:02:26.219
 of our pizza ok just a moment ago 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.650
 of obvious step to tell them that we need 

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:31.859
 grated cheese in this case I'm 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.900
 occupying gouda and manchego this gives a 

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:36.450
 very rich clear flavor you can put 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.120
 the cheeses that you like ok 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.220
 then this is gouda and manchego is going 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.810
 to love for the base that is what 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.049
 we need let's put the 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:50.129
 equivalent to three quarters of a cup 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:52.470
 flour in a tupper please and this is 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:55.680
 we are going to place a little bit of 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.689
 salt do not exaggerate with the salt please is 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.040
 about half a teaspoon and we're going to 

00:02:57.689 --> 00:03:02.450
 place our ingredient 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.680
 deliciously the chevecha is believed in 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.169
 this case is a key that you can 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.000
 occupy whatever is agreed I am 

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:10.950
 putting in the marks that I'm 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.989
 occupying at this time but neither are my 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.419
 sponsors is not that you have to 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:18.100
 occupy these marks ok now what are you going 

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:20.620
 to do is to go stirring peace 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:23.800
 to the mass so that I have one 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.300
 pasta since we did our dough well 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.160
 little ball what we are going to do is that 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.710
 having a perfectly surface 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:32.330
 clean and disinfected we will place you 

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:34.310
 please a little flour 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.020
 it's easy rather this is so that it does not 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.180
 stick or that obviously in your hands 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:40.010
 They are perfectly clean and so on 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.230
 etcetera and what we do is that 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:45.590
 we started to knead and in this case the 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:47.390
 I left a little bit wet and little by little 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:50.030
 you are rectifying the flour is preferable 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:52.190
 that is missing the inah and little to 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:55.070
 little you are integrating it to that of 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:57.650
 soon you have a paste or very watery or 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:59.840
 very dry then you are going to have to 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.480
 go feeling good because you know 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.190
 be a ball that you can 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.170
 Crush with the roller and do not pay 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:08.390
 forgiveness and on your table or in the 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.310
 roll is that the dough is already perfect 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.530
 ok then so we will continue 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.930
 kneading until I have my dough with the 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:17.989
 adequate consistency and then already 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.850
 let's proceed to place it in the base 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:21.290
 for pizza I tell you I 'm not going to 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:24.020
 I'll make them round 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:26.210
 rectangular ok for the case is now 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:29.360
 they decide and it's delicious when 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:32.360
 finish kneading the base well the appointment 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.340
 place the obvious pizza base and the 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.020
 place on a tray in this 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.470
 case I had told you that it was going to be 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:40.500
 rectangular ok 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:42.480
 in oil below so we do not get 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.880
 paste the pasta and the edges I made them 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:47.190
 like a chip or tito ok here in mexico is 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.690
 like when you make the shopper who 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:52.380
 you leave as well as a chip or tito so that 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:55.050
 precisely the sauce does not come out 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:58.590
 Now let's put the sauce right 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:01.590
 comes expansive please do not leave a 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:03.870
 corner Caesar quotes two tips I am 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:06.000
 fan of salsa but if you throw him 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:09.210
 Too much you get a lot of water 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.220
 well the base then do not exaggerate 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:14.820
 in the amount of ok that looks good 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:17.160
 explicit that is generous you can but 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:19.290
 not that it is as if you were 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:21.870
 bathing a sorrel what subsequently 

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:24.510
 I'm going to put it is well distributed all the 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:27.919
 cheese and I'm going to put it in the oven 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:30.150
 previously preheated that is to 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:33.410
 Average temperature I already told you 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:35.610
 in other videos that my oven does not have 

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:38.880
 degrees does not have them 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:41.760
 very high or very low ok then right now 

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:44.190
 leave pre warming in the short 

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:46.710
 for pizza I'll let the dough 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:49.800
 I'm not going to put the cover once 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:51.600
 that is to say the chorizo because if it is not 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:54.420
 I would burn the chorizo ​​I will know that my 

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:57.570
 pizza is already when the cheese is already seen 

00:05:54.420 --> 00:06:00.540
 well melted and the pasta from the edges 

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:03.660
 it looks slightly golden in that 

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:05.910
 moment is when I put the chorizo 

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:08.460
 I 'm going to teach you anyway 

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:10.830
 when I put the chorizo ​​for nothing 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:12.240
 more to put it back about 5 minutes to 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:15.360
 that the chori cited are also brown 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:17.220
 because this one who teaches you already comes pre 

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:19.740
 cooked then burns with much 

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:22.650
 ease then it's ready now 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:25.440
 we're going to put it in the oven ready and 

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:29.880
 now to wait as well as you see our 

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:31.890
 mass is already golden brown slightly and the 

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:34.620
 cheese already looks perfectly melted and 

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:36.840
 also slightly golden, that 's why we're going 

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:39.510
 to proceed to place the slices of 

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:41.640
 chorizo ok the truth as I tell you this 

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:43.950
 is the chorizo is not my sponsor but 

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:47.249
 we love and husband jiang that you're going 

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:49.859
 covering well all your pizza well 

00:06:47.249 --> 00:06:52.219
 and then it is to put another 10 

00:06:49.859 --> 00:06:55.439
 minutes or when the chorizo ​​looks 

00:06:52.219 --> 00:06:59.639
 golden but obviously not burnt and 

00:06:55.439 --> 00:07:05.279
 ready and you can eat it with a 

00:06:59.639 --> 00:07:07.229
 Delicious beer later with sauce 

00:07:05.279 --> 00:07:09.239

00:07:09.239 --> 00:07:15.149
 pizza and now I show you how it was already 

00:07:11.039 --> 00:07:17.219
 well done golden ready delicious crispy 

00:07:15.149 --> 00:07:19.949
 It looks good golden like I said 

00:07:17.219 --> 00:07:23.699
 this is for thin and remaining dough 

00:07:19.949 --> 00:07:26.759
 Crunch and delicious, I'm going to 

00:07:23.699 --> 00:07:30.689
 make another recipe since it is with pasta 

00:07:26.759 --> 00:07:33.599
 thick ok with the base quote c quote that
