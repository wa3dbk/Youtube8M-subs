 dragon ball digging in the cartoons 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:32.300

 doubt will be resolved every node will come 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:42.050
 loose and if we were to get there where 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:45.469
 there is no answer we will change 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.030
 question since you will propose 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:49.010
 the arguments 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.929
 write in the comments the doubt that there 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.940
 grips on dragon ball the most questions 

00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:55.280

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.440
 episodes of dragon ball fax 

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:02.749
 today we start with the group of enemies 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:06.890
 more fun than it ever appeared 

00:01:02.749 --> 00:01:09.500
 during the manga the team jin ju very few 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.510
 i knew how to pronounce i 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.730
 elite warriors personally chosen 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.680
 from freezer to solve big 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:18.700
 problems that every conqueror 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:21.140
 intergalactic must face how 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.970
 to overthrow a democracy to kill 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.670
 all the firstborns to walk around 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.860
 Fori Toriyama has always created enemies 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.960
 so that they had something in common 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.870
 the officers of the red bow ad 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.690
 example they are all united by colors 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:38.750
 that identify them but these aliens 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.520
 all different in race and ability 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.010
 what they have in common 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.680
 to find out I had to analyze the 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:47.810

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.930
