showpieces<00:01:26.280> this<00:01:27.180> show<00:01:27.360> piece<00:01:27.600> right<00:01:27.810> here<00:01:27.840> is

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
showpieces this show piece right here is

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.420 
showpieces this show piece right here is
going<00:01:28.320> to<00:01:28.380> actually<00:01:28.560> be<00:01:28.770> set<00:01:29.070> up<00:01:29.189> into<00:01:29.400> a

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
going to actually be set up into a

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.249 
going to actually be set up into a
clover<00:01:30.259> fused<00:01:31.259> pattern<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:33.049> probably<00:01:34.049> can't

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
clover fused pattern and probably can't

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.990 
clover fused pattern and probably can't
tell<00:01:34.320> but<00:01:34.470> there's<00:01:34.740> five<00:01:34.950> items<00:01:35.220> there<00:01:35.700> five

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
tell but there's five items there five

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.240 
tell but there's five items there five
different<00:01:36.360> items<00:01:36.630> but<00:01:36.780> there's<00:01:36.960> four<00:01:37.259> per

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
different items but there's four per

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.060 
different items but there's four per
item<00:01:38.670> so<00:01:39.630> each<00:01:39.930> clover<00:01:40.409> leaf<00:01:40.680> is<00:01:40.860> going<00:01:41.009> to

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
item so each clover leaf is going to

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.830 
item so each clover leaf is going to
have<00:01:41.280> five<00:01:41.610> of<00:01:41.820> those<00:01:41.909> idols<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:42.540> we're<00:01:42.720> going

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
stop that you see is a actually one

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.149 
stop that you see is a actually one
event<00:02:38.019> we've<00:02:39.019> aren't<00:02:39.290> this<00:02:39.409> is<00:02:39.590> would<00:02:39.889> be<00:02:40.010> the

00:02:40.149 --> 00:02:40.159 
event we've aren't this is would be the

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:41.860 
event we've aren't this is would be the
fourth<00:02:40.400> event<00:02:40.639> this<00:02:41.030> would<00:02:41.150> be<00:02:41.299> the<00:02:41.480> the

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
fourth event this would be the the

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.509 
fourth event this would be the the
middle<00:02:42.139> one<00:02:42.290> and<00:02:42.439> that's<00:02:43.189> where<00:02:43.370> we<00:02:43.400> really

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 
middle one and that's where we really

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:47.379 
middle one and that's where we really
start<00:02:44.060> getting<00:02:44.120> it<00:02:44.540> serious<00:02:44.959> into<00:02:45.319> the<00:02:46.389> bigger

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:47.389 
start getting it serious into the bigger

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:50.979 
start getting it serious into the bigger
items<00:02:48.290> and<00:02:48.919> more<00:02:49.879> interesting<00:02:50.389> things<00:02:50.629> to<00:02:50.780> see

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
items and more interesting things to see

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:54.240 
items and more interesting things to see
and<00:02:51.700> this<00:02:52.700> right<00:02:52.970> here<00:02:53.000> down<00:02:53.540> the<00:02:53.689> center

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
and this right here down the center

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.740 
and this right here down the center
starting<00:02:55.250> with<00:02:55.370> a<00:02:55.400> stroke<00:02:55.879> spectacular<00:02:56.540> and

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
starting with a stroke spectacular and

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.429 
starting with a stroke spectacular and
going<00:02:57.650> all<00:02:57.799> the<00:02:57.889> way<00:02:58.010> down<00:02:58.219> to<00:02:58.750> color<00:02:59.750> topia<00:03:00.230> I

00:03:00.429 --> 00:03:00.439 
going all the way down to color topia I

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:03.039 
going all the way down to color topia I
guess<00:03:00.739> don't<00:03:01.010> run<00:03:01.250> down<00:03:01.459> there<00:03:01.780> this<00:03:02.780> will<00:03:02.930> be

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:03.049 
guess don't run down there this will be

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:06.699 
guess don't run down there this will be
in<00:03:03.560> a<00:03:04.540> interesting<00:03:05.540> fuse<00:03:06.109> pattern<00:03:06.469> that<00:03:06.560> I'm

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
in a interesting fuse pattern that I'm

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.379 
in a interesting fuse pattern that I'm
coming<00:03:06.980> up<00:03:07.099> with<00:03:07.280> but<00:03:07.609> most<00:03:07.879> of<00:03:08.060> them<00:03:08.239> are

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:08.389 
coming up with but most of them are

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:13.949 
coming up with but most of them are
actually<00:03:08.769> bright<00:03:09.769> lights<00:03:11.560> patterns<00:03:12.560> and

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
actually bright lights patterns and

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:16.089 
actually bright lights patterns and
that's<00:03:14.959> why<00:03:15.109> I<00:03:15.139> put<00:03:15.440> them<00:03:15.590> together<00:03:15.709> and

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:16.099 
that's why I put them together and

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:17.710 
that's why I put them together and
hopefully<00:03:16.310> the<00:03:16.609> organization<00:03:17.269> will<00:03:17.389> just<00:03:17.599> be

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
hopefully the organization will just be

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.080 
hopefully the organization will just be
a<00:03:17.750> just<00:03:18.379> a<00:03:18.440> lot<00:03:18.680> like<00:03:19.010> maybe<00:03:19.310> not<00:03:19.519> so<00:03:19.909> much

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
a just a lot like maybe not so much

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.300 
a just a lot like maybe not so much
noise<00:03:20.299> but<00:03:20.659> a<00:03:20.690> lot<00:03:20.810> of<00:03:20.840> light<00:03:21.079> I<00:03:21.349> think<00:03:22.040> that'll

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
noise but a lot of light I think that'll

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.210 
noise but a lot of light I think that'll
be<00:03:22.340> interesting<00:03:22.819> for<00:03:23.180> people<00:03:23.359> to<00:03:23.629> see<00:03:24.189> now<00:03:25.189> I

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
be interesting for people to see now I

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.189 
be interesting for people to see now I
scoot<00:03:25.609> over<00:03:25.879> one<00:03:26.090> more<00:03:26.329> step<00:03:26.599> over<00:03:26.930> and<00:03:27.049> that's

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:27.199 
scoot over one more step over and that's

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:34.240 
scoot over one more step over and that's
a<00:03:27.790> another<00:03:28.810> event<00:03:30.489> and<00:03:32.319> this<00:03:33.319> event<00:03:33.470> has<00:03:33.859> the

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250
