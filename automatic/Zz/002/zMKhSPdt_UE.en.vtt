sides together and you put the ruler on
and<00:01:43.740> you<00:01:43.950> cut<00:01:44.220> one<00:01:44.940> direction<00:01:45.510> then<00:01:45.780> you<00:01:45.930> flip

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
and you cut one direction then you flip

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.600 
and you cut one direction then you flip
the<00:01:46.350> ruler<00:01:46.650> and<00:01:46.830> cut<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.220> other<00:01:47.340> direction

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
the ruler and cut the other direction

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.210 
the ruler and cut the other direction
and<00:01:48.090> you<00:01:48.540> end<00:01:48.720> up<00:01:48.780> with<00:01:48.960> these<00:01:49.140> great<00:01:49.770> half

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.860 
and you end up with these great half
square<00:01:50.640> triangles<00:01:51.210> that<00:01:51.300> are<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.630> perfect

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:51.870 
square triangles that are the perfect
