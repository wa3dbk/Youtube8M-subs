00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.930 
do some wonder I will post a link down
in<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:49.110> descriptions<00:00:49.829> for<00:00:50.250> those<00:00:50.579> who

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
in the descriptions for those who

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.510 
in the descriptions for those who
actually<00:00:51.120> wants<00:00:51.750> whatsit<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.649> board

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
actually wants whatsit and the board

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.600 
actually wants whatsit and the board
goes<00:00:53.760> for<00:00:54.030> about<00:00:54.289> $6<00:00:55.289> on<00:00:55.440> eBay<00:00:55.980> plus<00:00:56.370> the

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
goes for about $6 on eBay plus the

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.479 
goes for about $6 on eBay plus the
little<00:00:56.879> fee<00:00:57.210> for<00:00:57.510> shipping<00:00:57.870> and<00:00:58.219> I<00:00:59.219> actually

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
little fee for shipping and I actually

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.650 
little fee for shipping and I actually
ordered<00:01:00.059> two<00:01:00.300> of<00:01:00.329> these<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:01.640> I<00:01:02.640> was<00:01:03.030> expecting

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
ordered two of these and I was expecting

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.020 
ordered two of these and I was expecting
something<00:01:03.960> a<00:01:04.290> little<00:01:04.650> bit<00:01:04.769> bigger<00:01:04.920> then<00:01:05.549> I<00:01:05.580> saw

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
something a little bit bigger then I saw

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.760 
something a little bit bigger then I saw
and<00:01:06.710> it's<00:01:08.000> very<00:01:09.000> very<00:01:09.330> small<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:09.990> what<00:01:10.530> it<00:01:10.619> is

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
and it's very very small and what it is

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:17.270 
and it's very very small and what it is
it's<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:12.439> auto-mode<00:01:14.180> buck<00:01:15.180> boost<00:01:15.600> converter<00:01:16.280> so

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
it's a auto-mode buck boost converter so

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.510 
it's a auto-mode buck boost converter so
it<00:01:17.490> will<00:01:17.670> either<00:01:17.970> step<00:01:18.509> up<00:01:18.540> or<00:01:18.720> step<00:01:18.990> down

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
it will either step up or step down

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.640 
it will either step up or step down
depending<00:01:20.520> on<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.119> voltage<00:01:21.350> on<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.619> input

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
depending on the voltage on the input

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.359 
depending on the voltage on the input
and<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.610> voltage<00:01:24.000> that<00:01:24.659> you<00:01:24.930> set<00:01:25.650> for<00:01:25.890> the

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
and the voltage that you set for the

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.899 
and the voltage that you set for the
output<00:01:26.729> so<00:01:27.890> here<00:01:28.890> I<00:01:28.920> have<00:01:29.310> it<00:01:29.490> set<00:01:29.759> up<00:01:29.880> for

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
output so here I have it set up for

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.660 
output so here I have it set up for
basically<00:01:30.810> just<00:01:31.140> powering<00:01:31.530> an<00:01:31.799> LED<00:01:32.250> I<00:01:32.280> think

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
basically just powering an LED I think

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.929 
basically just powering an LED I think
I'm<00:01:32.820> about<00:01:33.060> to<00:01:33.329> 3<00:01:33.630> volts<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.220> I'm<00:01:35.220> powering<00:01:35.670> it

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
I'm about to 3 volts and I'm powering it

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.749 
I'm about to 3 volts and I'm powering it
with<00:01:36.210> a<00:01:36.240> bunch<00:01:36.630> of<00:01:36.810> super<00:01:37.200> capacitor<00:01:37.829> bündchen

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
with a bunch of super capacitor bündchen

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.899 
with a bunch of super capacitor bündchen
in<00:01:38.939> series<00:01:39.630> that<00:01:39.930> are<00:01:40.170> around<00:01:40.710> roughly<00:01:41.520> 2

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
in series that are around roughly 2

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.780 
in series that are around roughly 2
volts<00:01:42.390> just<00:01:43.140> basically<00:01:44.009> wants<00:01:44.430> to<00:01:44.490> discharge

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
volts just basically wants to discharge

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.289 
volts just basically wants to discharge
them<00:01:45.360> and<00:01:46.110> you<00:01:46.500> can<00:01:46.710> adjust<00:01:46.829> this<00:01:47.430> little<00:01:48.000> chip

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
them and you can adjust this little chip

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.069 
them and you can adjust this little chip
to<00:01:48.659> give<00:01:49.290> you<00:01:49.439> an<00:01:49.590> output<00:01:49.770> from<00:01:50.189> 1.8<00:01:51.030> volt<00:01:51.360> to

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
to give you an output from 1.8 volt to

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.760 
to give you an output from 1.8 volt to
5.5<00:01:53.070> volt<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:54.329> it<00:01:54.570> will<00:01:54.750> give<00:01:55.020> you<00:01:55.229> this

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
5.5 volt and it will give you this

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.609 
5.5 volt and it will give you this
voltage<00:01:56.460> regardless<00:01:57.329> of<00:01:57.750> what<00:01:58.049> you<00:01:58.170> put<00:01:58.409> in

circuit<00:02:23.440> when<00:02:24.190> I<00:02:24.220> can<00:02:24.489> just<00:02:24.760> use<00:02:25.030> this<00:02:25.300> little

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
circuit when I can just use this little

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:28.979 
circuit when I can just use this little
very<00:02:26.290> inexpensive<00:02:27.190> board<00:02:27.519> that<00:02:28.269> is<00:02:28.510> actually

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989 
very inexpensive board that is actually

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:31.350 
very inexpensive board that is actually
very<00:02:29.019> well<00:02:29.620> made<00:02:29.920> and<00:02:29.950> the<00:02:30.610> only<00:02:30.760> thing<00:02:31.000> I<00:02:31.150> did

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
very well made and the only thing I did

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.570 
very well made and the only thing I did
is<00:02:32.879> put<00:02:33.879> a<00:02:33.910> little<00:02:34.739> connector<00:02:35.739> here<00:02:36.040> so<00:02:36.250> I<00:02:36.280> can

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
is put a little connector here so I can

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.500 
is put a little connector here so I can
do<00:02:37.030> some<00:02:37.269> prototype<00:02:38.110> and<00:02:38.650> it<00:02:39.549> is<00:02:39.700> very<00:02:40.060> well

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
do some prototype and it is very well

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:48.059 
do some prototype and it is very well
labeled<00:02:42.299> there<00:02:43.299> we<00:02:43.480> go<00:02:45.420> in<00:02:46.420> ground<00:02:47.110> and<00:02:47.500> output

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069 
labeled there we go in ground and output

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:51.150 
labeled there we go in ground and output
and<00:02:48.670> there's<00:02:49.209> also<00:02:49.450> a<00:02:49.660> couple<00:02:50.440> of<00:02:50.620> other<00:02:50.739> thing

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
and there's also a couple of other thing

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.809 
and there's also a couple of other thing
you<00:02:51.400> can<00:02:51.549> set<00:02:51.819> some<00:02:52.000> jumper<00:02:52.450> here<00:02:52.780> for<00:02:53.110> various

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
you can set some jumper here for various

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:57.300 
you can set some jumper here for various
function<00:02:54.819> and<00:02:55.000> stuff<00:02:55.239> like<00:02:55.420> that<00:02:55.660> and<00:02:56.310> to

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
function and stuff like that and to

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.850 
function and stuff like that and to
adjust<00:02:57.760> the<00:02:58.060> output<00:02:58.170> voltage<00:02:59.170> well<00:02:59.500> there's<00:02:59.769> a

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
adjust the output voltage well there's a

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.850 
adjust the output voltage well there's a
little<00:03:00.459> mini<00:03:01.319> potentiometer<00:03:02.319> right<00:03:02.620> there

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
little mini potentiometer right there

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.240 
little mini potentiometer right there
and<00:03:03.190> that's<00:03:03.910> it<00:03:04.209> so<00:03:04.840> let<00:03:05.110> me<00:03:05.230> hook<00:03:05.470> it<00:03:05.620> back<00:03:05.799> in

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
and that's it so let me hook it back in

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.509 
and that's it so let me hook it back in
the<00:03:06.459> de<00:03:06.549> board<00:03:07.829> without<00:03:08.829> burning<00:03:09.250> anything

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
the de board without burning anything

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:15.900 
the de board without burning anything
and<00:03:10.000> voila<00:03:10.980> so<00:03:11.980> here<00:03:12.579> it<00:03:12.670> is<00:03:12.790> and<00:03:14.610> I've<00:03:15.610> got

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
and voila so here it is and I've got

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.210 
and voila so here it is and I've got
myself<00:03:16.480> I've<00:03:16.780> ordered<00:03:16.989> myself<00:03:17.290> five<00:03:17.799> more<00:03:18.100> of

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
myself I've ordered myself five more of

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.069 
myself I've ordered myself five more of
these<00:03:18.340> and<00:03:18.760> I'll<00:03:18.910> probably<00:03:19.450> build<00:03:19.660> a<00:03:19.780> couple

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:20.079 
these and I'll probably build a couple

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:23.280 
these and I'll probably build a couple
of<00:03:20.170> other<00:03:20.319> circuit<00:03:21.069> with<00:03:21.250> these<00:03:22.019> maybe<00:03:23.019> not

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
of other circuit with these maybe not

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.000 
of other circuit with these maybe not
LEDs<00:03:23.950> but<00:03:24.660> maybe<00:03:25.660> something<00:03:26.049> to<00:03:26.230> charge<00:03:26.590> a

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
LEDs but maybe something to charge a

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.849 
LEDs but maybe something to charge a
super<00:03:27.549> capacitor<00:03:28.239> and<00:03:28.569> a<00:03:28.630> little<00:03:29.380> portable

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:29.859 
super capacitor and a little portable

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:34.709 
super capacitor and a little portable
power<00:03:30.639> supply<00:03:31.230> thanks<00:03:32.230> for<00:03:32.380> watching
