00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.000
 None of this makes sense to me. 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.500
 What still escapes me, Uncle? 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.500
 What should I see? 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 You thought you were so smart, 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.000
 who had fooled us all. 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 One by one our brothers fell into the trap. 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.000
 But I do not, I challenge you! 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 I know the Black Stone is the key, and it will be mine. 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.500
 Soon my armies will come by the Shattered Mountain. 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 Devastating this world and all hope of resistance. 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 My servants will find the stone, wherever you hide it! 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:03:01.000
 And then, finally, Azmodan will reign as Supreme Evil! 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:15.000
