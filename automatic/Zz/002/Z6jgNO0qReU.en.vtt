00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
well again it's still a set up volume so

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.820 
well again it's still a set up volume so
there's<00:02:28.880> a<00:02:28.970> lot<00:02:29.120> of<00:02:29.150> just<00:02:29.510> explaining<00:02:30.290> what's

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
going on and why the world is the way it

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.470 
going on and why the world is the way it
is<00:02:32.480> that<00:02:32.690> kind<00:02:32.780> of<00:02:32.870> thing<00:02:33.080> so<00:02:33.830> not<00:02:34.220> too<00:02:34.640> much<00:02:35.090> in

going on that kind of a you know that

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.130 
going on that kind of a you know that
kind<00:04:00.920> of<00:04:01.010> a<00:04:01.130> reveal<00:04:01.640> so<00:04:01.910> good<00:04:02.660> on<00:04:02.750> the<00:04:02.840> artist

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140 
kind of a reveal so good on the artist

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:06.250 
kind of a reveal so good on the artist
from<00:04:03.410> managing<00:04:03.739> that<00:04:03.890> so<00:04:04.220> overall<00:04:05.150> again<00:04:06.140> this

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
from managing that so overall again this

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.350 
from managing that so overall again this
is<00:04:06.380> the<00:04:06.470> first<00:04:06.650> volume<00:04:07.130> of<00:04:07.340> an<00:04:07.610> action<00:04:07.940> manga

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:08.360 
is the first volume of an action manga

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.420 
is the first volume of an action manga
so<00:04:08.510> there's<00:04:08.660> a<00:04:08.690> lot<00:04:08.780> of<00:04:08.840> setup<00:04:09.170> I<00:04:09.980> didn't<00:04:10.310> like

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
so there's a lot of setup I didn't like

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:11.920 
so there's a lot of setup I didn't like
it<00:04:10.519> as<00:04:10.580> much<00:04:10.670> as<00:04:10.790> say<00:04:11.120> I<00:04:11.150> like<00:04:11.540> the<00:04:11.720> first<00:04:11.840> of

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
it as much as say I like the first of

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:13.780 
it as much as say I like the first of
all<00:04:11.989> bleach<00:04:12.380> which<00:04:12.620> I<00:04:12.739> thought<00:04:12.860> del<00:04:13.160> del<00:04:13.549> more

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
all bleach which I thought del del more

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:16.509 
all bleach which I thought del del more
to<00:04:13.880> the<00:04:13.970> characters<00:04:14.620> and<00:04:15.620> it<00:04:15.769> made<00:04:16.220> me<00:04:16.250> feel

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:16.519 
to the characters and it made me feel

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:18.130 
to the characters and it made me feel
for<00:04:16.669> the<00:04:16.729> characters<00:04:16.880> much<00:04:17.479> more<00:04:17.630> very

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:18.140 
for the characters much more very

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:20.380 
for the characters much more very
effectively<00:04:18.530> whereas<00:04:19.370> this<00:04:19.790> is<00:04:19.970> again<00:04:20.359> a

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:20.390 
effectively whereas this is again a

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:22.000 
effectively whereas this is again a
fairly<00:04:20.840> standard<00:04:20.959> shown<00:04:21.289> in<00:04:21.410> action<00:04:21.739> set<00:04:21.890> up

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.010 
fairly standard shown in action set up

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.870 
fairly standard shown in action set up
not<00:04:22.490> a<00:04:22.520> complaint<00:04:22.849> and<00:04:24.669> honestly<00:04:25.669> I<00:04:25.760> think

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
not a complaint and honestly I think

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:26.800 
not a complaint and honestly I think
this<00:04:26.030> is<00:04:26.120> one<00:04:26.300> of<00:04:26.330> those<00:04:26.479> show

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
this is one of those show

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.420 
this is one of those show
and<00:04:26.900> titles<00:04:27.410> that<00:04:27.560> will<00:04:27.680> really<00:04:28.130> reveal

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
and titles that will really reveal

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.850 
and titles that will really reveal
itself<00:04:28.700> around<00:04:28.970> volume<00:04:29.360> three<00:04:29.570> or<00:04:29.690> four<00:04:29.990> if

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:30.860 
itself around volume three or four if

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.159 
itself around volume three or four if
this<00:04:30.980> turns<00:04:31.220> into<00:04:31.400> just<00:04:31.840> constant<00:04:32.840> mindless

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:33.169 
this turns into just constant mindless

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:37.240 
this turns into just constant mindless
fighting<00:04:33.730> okay<00:04:34.810> and<00:04:35.810> it<00:04:35.960> is<00:04:36.380> mean<00:04:36.830> much<00:04:37.220> of

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
fighting okay and it is mean much of

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.129 
fighting okay and it is mean much of
this<00:04:37.550> volume<00:04:37.940> is<00:04:38.090> kind<00:04:38.360> of<00:04:38.419> mindless<00:04:38.690> fighting

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:39.139 
this volume is kind of mindless fighting

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:41.230 
this volume is kind of mindless fighting
so<00:04:39.440> there's<00:04:40.430> that<00:04:40.610> whole<00:04:40.820> question<00:04:41.150> as<00:04:41.210> to

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
so there's that whole question as to

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.590 
so there's that whole question as to
whether<00:04:41.389> it's<00:04:41.660> going<00:04:41.930> to<00:04:42.669> go<00:04:43.669> somewhere<00:04:44.120> or

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:44.600 
whether it's going to go somewhere or

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.040 
whether it's going to go somewhere or
just<00:04:44.660> duval<00:04:45.200> with<00:04:45.410> the<00:04:45.500> standard<00:04:45.740> shounen

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
just duval with the standard shounen

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.550 
just duval with the standard shounen
cliche<00:04:48.050> and<00:04:48.350> just<00:04:48.530> dough<00:04:48.919> cliche<00:04:49.580> because<00:04:49.820> I

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 
cliche and just dough cliche because I

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.659 
cliche and just dough cliche because I
watch<00:04:51.560> a<00:04:51.710> lot<00:04:51.740> of<00:04:51.889> action<00:04:52.250> if<00:04:52.340> I<00:04:52.400> care<00:04:52.580> about

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:52.669 
watch a lot of action if I care about

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:53.890 
watch a lot of action if I care about
the<00:04:52.760> characters<00:04:52.940> this<00:04:53.360> point<00:04:53.570> I<00:04:53.600> don't<00:04:53.630> quite

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:53.900 
the characters this point I don't quite

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.960 
the characters this point I don't quite
care<00:04:54.169> about<00:04:54.350> them<00:04:54.500> too<00:04:54.860> much<00:04:54.980> yet<00:04:55.250> so<00:04:55.850> I<00:04:55.880> have

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:55.970 
care about them too much yet so I have

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:57.700 
care about them too much yet so I have
to<00:04:56.060> see<00:04:56.270> how<00:04:56.540> it<00:04:56.570> deals<00:04:57.080> with<00:04:57.230> that<00:04:57.440> or<00:04:57.590> whether

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.710 
to see how it deals with that or whether

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:59.350 
to see how it deals with that or whether
we<00:04:57.889> actually<00:04:58.370> go<00:04:58.880> somewhere<00:04:58.910> with<00:04:59.330> that

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
we actually go somewhere with that

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.500 
we actually go somewhere with that
material<00:04:59.540> so<00:05:00.020> that's<00:05:00.860> the<00:05:00.979> overall<00:05:01.510> your

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:02.510
