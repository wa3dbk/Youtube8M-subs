00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.300
 a new colony of Vulcans suddenly 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.770
 attacked by army of walking 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.020
 armed dinosaurs from space 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.060
 dinosaurs abducted a local volcano-OPERATION 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.220
 beautiful and with her take 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.620
 some kind of unimaginably powerful device 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:17.650
 the main character is perpetual comrades kirk and 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:19.900
 Spock decide to fix this situation they 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.000

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.840
 they have to deal extremely 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.730
 important thing 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.650
 kill those most armed 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:29.440
 dinosaurs lasted it will be like 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.760
 at least 7 hours exactly as long as you

 you will not find the most important 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:35.020
 dinosaur beauty and stolen 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.420
 device only then you can 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.820
 enjoy captions although there is no mistake 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:43.240
 titles can be viewed from the main menu 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.890
 one wonders why torture yourself digital 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.930
 extremes tried to shoved his game 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.540
 as much as possible of the most diverse 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.490
 chips here you and pumping characters and 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.880
 tomb jumping from the box 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.070
 raider 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.960
 and shooting shelters rolls and 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.060
 arcade space simulator 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.550
 and a set of mini-games and everything, and do not count 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:03.190
 at first it may seem that in this game 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:05.470
 just too much but it’s an impression 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.960
 only self-deception star trek represents 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:10.179
 is one big set mediating on 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.800
 ideas realized monstrous mini-games 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:13.630
 with the word computers finally 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.970
 bored in the first half of the game 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.190
 jumping from the ledge to the ledge and crawling on 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.990
 eaves look completely unnecessary 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.480
 Bleeding characters turns 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.740
 totally unnecessary thing that can 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.470
 just pour out of my head 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:29.560
 but the moments in space they can 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:32.290
 spoil the nerves to anyone though there are 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.480
 something curious in about 10 seconds 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:38.050
 you have to play because of who she was there and 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:40.030
 for the torpedo putin enterprise ingenious 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.030
 and still in this game is stealth which 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.590
 works so i feel like crying 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.569
 most of the battle mechanics star trek 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.090
 reminds mass effect 2 without abundance 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:50.430
 special abilities 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.500
 Only there are some nuances it 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.110
 completely irresponsible location not 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.390
 intuitive shelters useless trunks and 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.700
 the dumbest artificial intelligence of enemies 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.950
 predict their behavior is impossible 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.430
 most of the times they just don’t 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.599
 see 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.760
 if someone is from a local dinosaur 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:08.610
 finds you first and starts you 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.069
 shoot this is an event they take only 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.590
 spawning number down straight from the air 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:15.390
 star trek is a co-op shooter game 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.709
 the logic of things play it with a friend 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.900
 will be much more fun 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:21.360
 do not believe if you really want 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.519
 look at this game take pity 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.140
 friends and do it in company with the bot 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:28.140
 amazing as with so many 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:30.120
 bugs emitting squeaks here manages 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.370
 self-pass mini-games 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.560
 press the desired button and rotate 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.620
 levers from playing with him they are alive 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.900
 man you will not lose anything 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:42.090
 star trek co-op is a dummy all on 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.049
 that was enough developers joint 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.329
 door opening 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:46.379
 hacking consoles and sitting down each other 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:48.810
 on high ledges 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:50.910
 time after time every five minutes and one 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.889
 the same even with the greatest desire 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.859
 the pleasures of such a cooperative are quite 

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:57.930
 doubtfully hardly many hoped for 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:04:00.030
 the fact that the game output is timed 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.459
 loud and movie premiere will be at least 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:05.160
 something to claim star trek completely 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:07.799
 met all the heaps of expectations she 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.269
 monotonous and sadly terribly tightened and 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:12.359
 absolutely not beautiful 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:14.280
 although there is a good side to this and and 

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:16.109
 soundtrack in the game 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.760
 there is wonderful music and 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:20.220
 full set of branded sound effects 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:23.419
 which any fan will easily recognize 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.419
 star trek universe 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:29.650
 characters here are also voiced 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.750
 remarkably sorry for just yourself 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:34.360
 the dialogues here are more in their absolute 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.790
 meaningless if you have not had time 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.890
 spent your 50 dollars better 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:40.990
 keep them with you buy something 

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:43.660
 anything more pleasant 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.980
 at least a movie ticket for sure coming out 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:47.560
 my film whatever it is 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:50.620
 it will be much better to let you 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:53.430
 say good luck shooters and see you on
