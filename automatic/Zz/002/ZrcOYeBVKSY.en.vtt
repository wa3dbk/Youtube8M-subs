00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:08.400
 Schlossborner today again two 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.950
 variations with the cable for the 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.690
 chest muscles I use the cable too 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.190
 fundamentally more about the individual 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.990
 Muscle groups again after the hard 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.910
 Isolating trainings means little 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.230
 weight also go many repetitions 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.119
 Let the breast, for example, here in the 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.630
 example, very very burn, that is 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.490
 cable one variations of the butterfly 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:29.250
 first the classic we consolidate 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.619
 of these individual handles on top of the cable too 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.510
 make another failure step that 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.809
 I already have a tension on the ropes 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.309
 and now here from far out 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.899
 Always get to look as the shoulder 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.170
 gives the changes to one lowered 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.090
 they are slightly bent 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.700
 students and cheeky forward 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.200
 yes I see many in the gym 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.090
 going to do to this point the guys here 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.250
 just slightly forward we want 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.379
 here in this cable beautiful into the vale 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.180
 get in the chest because of that 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.989
 we can go back here already 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:03.329
 a lowered a bit anti-bodies 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:06.720
 and squeeze out exclusively depending on 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:09.380
 extraction and we also move from it 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.380
 stay lowered 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.799
 the splash in the chest just at 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.530
 the negative movement as this 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.299
 eccentric four beautiful tension the 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.250
 the smell in the chest and then go 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:25.290
 out the front slightly 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:28.520
 the hands and push out very nice 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.750
 also go to the final and the chest 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.590
 isolate and skim the first 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.810
 variation here 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.500
 the classic that leaves meat 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:47.759
 stand with the charismatic and build 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:49.890
 I want you down here 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.899
 only one variation above all shows that 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.310
 we are at these key areas 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.399
 Reinbek more area so in the upper 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.140
 chest area here pay attention to these 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.060
 In both cases, he gives his exercises away to the woman 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.380
 and the one that gets you to that very much 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.720
 little dishes it's not about it 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.950
 establish rekorde but little 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.170
 weight you have to consciously with these 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.019
 Both exercises therefore feel isolation 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.550
 on the cable after the bench press at the end 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:13.800
 again if necessary if the 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.239
 Breast 13 gets a little weight 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.560
 take care of shoulder complaints and all 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:18.299
 important always the opponent 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.310
 train if you have trained here 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:21.989
 We'll share someone four with you 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.150
 front shoulder with it always too 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.829
 so the reverse exercise always the 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.829
 against each other to compensate with trained 

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:30.989
 so second exercise again one 

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:32.820
 sewage from groups as I said something 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:35.040
 more the areas covered also liked 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.470
 the problem has the so-called t shirt 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:42.060
 breast in the neckline that has the 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:43.410
 breasts out and out 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.560
 written it could quite natural 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:48.080
 sit down 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.849
 here we go in schönau earned and 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:53.900
 quite possibly not only and building 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:55.360
 pull them up over the 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.980
 has strength 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:05.980
 slightly crossing above again 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:11.920
 as well banned and beauty so far 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:13.390
 to a motion similar front themes 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.620
 so know how the front themes 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:23.310
 Mixed butterfly especially shoulders 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:23.310
 big wide little weight best 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:32.110
 Exhales beautiful in the effort 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:35.940
 Exercise second overall at the end of my 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:38.320
 cousins ​​years the breast finger 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.940
 to burn it out of here 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.370
 so there comes a 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:45.870
 coladose expensive cola zero dose 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.870
 could get stuck until then 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:53.230
 Schejbal 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:53.230
 Keystone led 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.880
 you are dead 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.880
 drink 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:20.239
 how come paris feels best tests 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:20.239
 countries stressed league what a bonus
