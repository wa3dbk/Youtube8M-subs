00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:12.580 
it ought to be pretty simple but there's

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.549 
it ought to be pretty simple but there's
a<00:00:12.670> lot<00:00:12.820> of<00:00:12.910> confusion<00:00:13.389> on<00:00:13.480> it<00:00:13.660> and<00:00:13.900> there<00:00:14.380> are<00:00:14.410> a

the<00:02:09.519> ground<00:02:09.910> on<00:02:10.209> the<00:02:11.019> infield<00:02:11.440> side<00:02:11.709> of<00:02:11.920> the

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
the ground on the infield side of the

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.190 
the ground on the infield side of the
base<00:02:12.189> first<00:02:12.879> right<00:02:13.239> after<00:02:13.450> comes<00:02:13.659> off<00:02:13.840> the<00:02:13.989> bat

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
base first right after comes off the bat

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.500 
base first right after comes off the bat
you<00:02:14.650> can't<00:02:14.920> call<00:02:15.129> it<00:02:15.159> fair<00:02:15.459> or<00:02:15.489> foul<00:02:15.790> until<00:02:16.420> it

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
you can't call it fair or foul until it

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:17.970 
you can't call it fair or foul until it
stops<00:02:16.840> or<00:02:17.079> is<00:02:17.170> touched

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
stops or is touched

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.339 
stops or is touched
or<00:02:18.040> it<00:02:18.700> goes<00:02:18.730> beyond<00:02:19.270> first<00:02:19.780> or<00:02:19.930> third<00:02:20.050> base

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:20.349 
or it goes beyond first or third base

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:23.640 
or it goes beyond first or third base
now<00:02:21.160> it's<00:02:21.580> ruled<00:02:21.879> by<00:02:22.030> where<00:02:22.900> the<00:02:23.110> ball<00:02:23.290> crosses

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
now it's ruled by where the ball crosses

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.559 
now it's ruled by where the ball crosses
the<00:02:23.950> base<00:02:24.190> so<00:02:24.849> the<00:02:24.940> ball<00:02:25.150> could<00:02:25.360> actually

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
the base so the ball could actually

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:30.089 
the base so the ball could actually
touch<00:02:26.440> down<00:02:26.830> in<00:02:27.810> foul<00:02:28.810> territory<00:02:29.080> and<00:02:29.680> with<00:02:30.069> a

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:30.099 
touch down in foul territory and with a

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:32.070 
touch down in foul territory and with a
lot<00:02:30.310> of<00:02:30.340> spin<00:02:30.670> on<00:02:30.910> it<00:02:31.060> it<00:02:31.300> comes<00:02:31.569> up<00:02:31.810> and<00:02:31.959> goes

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
lot of spin on it it comes up and goes

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.680 
lot of spin on it it comes up and goes
over<00:02:32.470> the<00:02:32.590> base<00:02:32.800> and<00:02:33.280> lands<00:02:34.269> on<00:02:34.420> the<00:02:34.480> other

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
over the base and lands on the other

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.509 
over the base and lands on the other
side<00:02:34.989> of<00:02:35.019> the<00:02:35.170> base<00:02:35.349> that<00:02:35.890> would<00:02:36.010> be<00:02:36.160> a<00:02:36.190> fair

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:36.519 
side of the base that would be a fair

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:38.280 
side of the base that would be a fair
ball<00:02:36.760> because<00:02:37.090> it<00:02:37.209> went<00:02:37.330> over<00:02:37.599> the<00:02:37.690> bag<00:02:37.900> fair

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
ball because it went over the bag fair

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.100 
ball because it went over the bag fair
right<00:02:39.090> you<00:02:40.090> can<00:02:40.269> have<00:02:40.390> another<00:02:40.690> one<00:02:40.780> that

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
right you can have another one that

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:46.110 
right you can have another one that
touches<00:02:41.970> in<00:02:42.970> here<00:02:43.510> fair<00:02:43.900> and<00:02:44.430> then<00:02:45.430> because<00:02:46.000> of

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
touches in here fair and then because of

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.449 
touches in here fair and then because of
the<00:02:46.209> spin<00:02:46.480> comes<00:02:46.840> up<00:02:47.019> over<00:02:47.230> the<00:02:47.349> base<00:02:47.650> and<00:02:47.950> then

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
the spin comes up over the base and then

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.820 
the spin comes up over the base and then
it's<00:02:48.640> next<00:02:48.910> landing<00:02:49.690> is<00:02:49.870> in<00:02:50.290> foul<00:02:50.530> territory

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
it's next landing is in foul territory

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.009 
it's next landing is in foul territory
but<00:02:51.730> that<00:02:51.910> would<00:02:52.030> be<00:02:52.150> a<00:02:52.180> fair<00:02:52.540> ball

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
but that would be a fair ball

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:56.039 
but that would be a fair ball
because<00:02:53.530> it<00:02:53.680> went<00:02:53.830> over<00:02:54.069> the<00:02:54.190> base<00:02:54.370> fare<00:02:55.049> now

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049 
because it went over the base fare now

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:58.370 
because it went over the base fare now
for<00:02:56.349> balls<00:02:56.560> that<00:02:56.890> first<00:02:57.160> touch<00:02:57.430> the<00:02:57.640> ground

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
for balls that first touch the ground

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.890 
for balls that first touch the ground
beyond<00:02:59.380> first<00:02:59.739> or<00:02:59.950> third<00:03:00.099> base<00:03:00.660> meaning<00:03:01.660> that

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
beyond first or third base meaning that

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.240 
beyond first or third base meaning that
they<00:03:02.019> came<00:03:02.170> right<00:03:02.410> off<00:03:02.440> the<00:03:02.560> bat<00:03:02.890> and<00:03:03.160> the

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
they came right off the bat and the

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.729 
they came right off the bat and the
first<00:03:03.459> time<00:03:03.700> they<00:03:03.849> touch<00:03:04.030> the<00:03:04.209> ground<00:03:04.739> was

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
first time they touch the ground was

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:08.580 
first time they touch the ground was
here<00:03:06.190> you<00:03:06.970> would<00:03:07.120> rule<00:03:07.329> it<00:03:07.480> but<00:03:07.630> where<00:03:08.380> it<00:03:08.500> is

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
here you would rule it but where it is

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.830 
here you would rule it but where it is
when<00:03:08.829> it<00:03:08.920> hits<00:03:09.010> the<00:03:09.190> ground<00:03:09.220> if<00:03:10.209> it<00:03:10.450> comes<00:03:10.690> off

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
when it hits the ground if it comes off

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.259 
when it hits the ground if it comes off
the<00:03:10.900> bat<00:03:11.260> and<00:03:11.709> it<00:03:12.310> first<00:03:12.579> touches<00:03:12.940> the<00:03:13.090> ground

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:13.269 
the bat and it first touches the ground

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:17.910 
the bat and it first touches the ground
here<00:03:14.790> you<00:03:15.790> have<00:03:15.940> a<00:03:15.970> foul<00:03:16.239> ball<00:03:16.480> so<00:03:17.440> if<00:03:17.620> a<00:03:17.709> touch

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
here you have a foul ball so if a touch

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.710 
here you have a foul ball so if a touch
touches<00:03:18.640> the<00:03:18.730> ground<00:03:18.910> you<00:03:19.180> have<00:03:19.299> to<00:03:19.360> wait

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
touches the ground you have to wait

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.259 
touches the ground you have to wait
until<00:03:20.530> it<00:03:21.010> goes<00:03:21.130> past<00:03:21.430> the<00:03:21.579> baggers<00:03:21.940> touched

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
until it goes past the baggers touched

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:24.809 
until it goes past the baggers touched
the<00:03:23.230> first<00:03:23.440> touch<00:03:23.650> as<00:03:23.769> a<00:03:23.799> groundout<00:03:24.220> here<00:03:24.579> you

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:24.819 
the first touch as a groundout here you

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:26.129 
the first touch as a groundout here you
don't<00:03:25.030> have<00:03:25.180> to<00:03:25.299> wait<00:03:25.600> you<00:03:25.810> call<00:03:26.019> it

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:26.139 
don't have to wait you call it

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:28.949 
don't have to wait you call it
immediately<00:03:27.329> okay<00:03:28.329> now<00:03:28.480> we're<00:03:28.630> going<00:03:28.750> to<00:03:28.840> give

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
immediately okay now we're going to give

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.259 
immediately okay now we're going to give
some<00:03:28.989> examples<00:03:29.260> of<00:03:29.950> the<00:03:30.250> fact<00:03:30.609> that<00:03:30.730> it's

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269 
some examples of the fact that it's

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:33.090 
some examples of the fact that it's
where<00:03:31.569> the<00:03:31.780> ball<00:03:32.019> is<00:03:32.049> in<00:03:32.530> relation<00:03:32.950> to<00:03:32.980> the

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
where the ball is in relation to the

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.699 
where the ball is in relation to the
line<00:03:33.400> and<00:03:33.730> it<00:03:34.150> has<00:03:34.299> nothing<00:03:34.450> to<00:03:34.690> do<00:03:34.930> with<00:03:35.530> the

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
line and it has nothing to do with the

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:37.620 
line and it has nothing to do with the
position<00:03:35.889> of<00:03:36.280> the<00:03:36.370> fielder<00:03:36.760> you<00:03:37.329> have<00:03:37.480> to

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
position of the fielder you have to

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.990 
position of the fielder you have to
judge<00:03:37.989> where<00:03:38.560> the<00:03:38.709> ball<00:03:38.889> was<00:03:39.130> when<00:03:39.819> it's

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
judge where the ball was when it's

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.970 
judge where the ball was when it's
touched<00:03:40.389> all<00:03:41.139> right<00:03:41.260> so<00:03:41.620> we're<00:03:41.709> going<00:03:41.799> to<00:03:41.859> give

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
touched all right so we're going to give

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:43.949 
touched all right so we're going to give
an<00:03:42.130> example<00:03:42.489> here<00:03:42.880> where<00:03:43.269> he<00:03:43.480> touches<00:03:43.930> the

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
an example here where he touches the

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:46.770 
an example here where he touches the
ball<00:03:44.109> and<00:03:44.590> then<00:03:45.100> it<00:03:45.250> goes<00:03:45.430> in<00:03:45.700> one<00:03:46.030> side<00:03:46.630> of<00:03:46.720> the

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
ball and then it goes in one side of the

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.629 
ball and then it goes in one side of the
field<00:03:46.959> and<00:03:47.139> it<00:03:47.260> falls<00:03:47.470> to<00:03:47.650> the<00:03:47.769> other<00:03:47.920> so

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:48.639 
field and it falls to the other so

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:51.150 
field and it falls to the other so
here's<00:03:48.819> one<00:03:49.230> where<00:03:50.230> he's<00:03:50.530> going<00:03:50.829> to<00:03:50.889> touch<00:03:51.130> it

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
here's one where he's going to touch it

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.960 
here's one where he's going to touch it
in<00:03:51.900> fair<00:03:52.900> territory<00:03:53.109> and<00:03:53.799> it's<00:03:54.519> going<00:03:54.639> to<00:03:54.700> fall

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
in fair territory and it's going to fall

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:01.620 
in fair territory and it's going to fall
foul<00:03:59.639> okay<00:04:00.639> that<00:04:00.819> would<00:04:00.910> be<00:04:00.970> a<00:04:01.060> fair<00:04:01.389> ball

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630 
foul okay that would be a fair ball

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:04.170 
foul okay that would be a fair ball
