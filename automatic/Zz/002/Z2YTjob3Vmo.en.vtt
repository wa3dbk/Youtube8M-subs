 ----- warning!! -----. I produce videos for Japanese people who are common sense, such as religion, politics, ethics and morals. These may be different from your country's common sense. 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
 ----- warning!! -----. If you try to look only at your country's values, you may find it uncomfortable. If this is not acceptable, please stop playing the video now. 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 Hello !! I am "YUKKURI" of the famous voice actor in Japan. 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
 I bought a new camera. 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
 It is Panasonic HX-A100. 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 I bought it for shooting back and forth in KSR and for shooting in AR. 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 I thought to put it in my head at the time of maintenance, but I think it is a bit disturbing. 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 It does not fit very well to install in KSR. 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 And the image quality is bad. 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 When I saw the sample on the Internet, I thought that the image quality was bad. 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 However, "image quality may not be bad when viewed on a local drive." / I have purchased with such groundless expectations. 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 It was useless as expected. 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 In addition to that, the cable is short. 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 The disadvantages are more problematic than the advantages of camera separation. 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 Wiring and light bulb status check 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 Microphone installed under the seat 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
 Motorcycle &amp; Poem 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
 August 19 is the day of motorcycles !! And it is Poem day. 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.000
 The performers are always everyone. 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 The top batter is Sumomo-chan !! 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:31.000
 Good fuel economy. . . . . Load up. . . Oh! Convenient !! 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:38.000
 The characteristics of Sumomo-chan were well expressed. Next is Sarah's turn. 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:45.000
 small. . . Running well. . . Tiny. . . 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:52.000
 Sarah is so cute !! Next is Yae's turn. 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 Full moon shining in gold. . . Cherry blossoms illuminated by moonlight. . . 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 As expected, beautiful Yaesu !! Next is Nanako's turn !! 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:12.000

 Oh! Motorcycle !! . . Aha! Motorcycle. . . Yes! Motorcycles. . . 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
 Well, who is the winner? 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.000
 Before the announcement of winning, it is an advertisement. 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:42.000

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000
