that<00:04:09.340> the<00:04:09.879> Scot<00:04:10.180> protecting<00:04:10.719> this<00:04:10.930> is<00:04:11.140> what

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:11.319 
that the Scot protecting this is what

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:12.869 
that the Scot protecting this is what
you're<00:04:11.469> gonna<00:04:11.560> use<00:04:11.890> on<00:04:12.129> the<00:04:12.249> date<00:04:12.459> you<00:04:12.609> don't

00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:12.879 
you're gonna use on the date you don't

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:16.680 
you're gonna use on the date you don't
wash<00:04:13.150> your<00:04:13.180> hair<00:04:13.569> remember<00:04:15.239> it's<00:04:16.239> gonna<00:04:16.389> take

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
wash your hair remember it's gonna take

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.449 
wash your hair remember it's gonna take
a<00:04:16.720> little<00:04:17.079> bit<00:04:17.229> of<00:04:17.350> time<00:04:17.530> for<00:04:17.769> YouTube<00:04:18.130> perhaps

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
a little bit of time for YouTube perhaps

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.219 
a little bit of time for YouTube perhaps
adjust<00:04:18.820> maybe<00:04:19.060> you're<00:04:19.269> not<00:04:19.389> washing<00:04:19.840> often

00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:20.229 
adjust maybe you're not washing often

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:22.920 
adjust maybe you're not washing often
enough<00:04:20.530> maybe<00:04:20.919> you're<00:04:21.100> washing<00:04:21.280> too<00:04:21.699> often<00:04:22.180> so

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
enough maybe you're washing too often so

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.290 
enough maybe you're washing too often so
the<00:04:23.050> idea<00:04:23.410> is<00:04:23.650> to<00:04:24.009> not<00:04:24.580> wash<00:04:24.820> your<00:04:24.940> hair<00:04:25.120> more

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
the idea is to not wash your hair more

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.240 
the idea is to not wash your hair more
than<00:04:25.360> three<00:04:25.930> times<00:04:26.139> a<00:04:26.380> week<00:04:26.590> and<00:04:26.800> I<00:04:26.919> know<00:04:26.979> that

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
than three times a week and I know that

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:28.620 
than three times a week and I know that
for<00:04:27.430> some<00:04:27.550> of<00:04:27.610> you<00:04:27.820> that<00:04:28.000> might<00:04:28.210> seem<00:04:28.479> a<00:04:28.539> little

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
for some of you that might seem a little

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.110 
for some of you that might seem a little
alarming<00:04:29.259> because<00:04:29.500> some<00:04:29.710> of<00:04:29.740> you<00:04:30.009> maybe<00:04:30.970> you

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
alarming because some of you maybe you

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.390 
alarming because some of you maybe you
wash<00:04:31.720> your<00:04:31.870> hair<00:04:32.020> once<00:04:32.289> a<00:04:32.470> week<00:04:32.650> while<00:04:33.099> others

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
wash your hair once a week while others

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.290 
wash your hair once a week while others
are<00:04:33.580> watching<00:04:33.849> every<00:04:34.120> day<00:04:34.240> but

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
are watching every day but

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.969 
are watching every day but
dermatologists<00:04:35.199> recommend<00:04:35.229> that<00:04:35.680> you<00:04:35.800> don't

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:35.979 
dermatologists recommend that you don't

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:37.350 
dermatologists recommend that you don't
wash<00:04:36.190> your<00:04:36.220> hair<00:04:36.520> more<00:04:36.669> than<00:04:36.849> twenty<00:04:37.150> three

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
wash your hair more than twenty three

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.570 
wash your hair more than twenty three
times<00:04:37.509> a<00:04:37.690> week<00:04:37.870> maximum<00:04:38.830> because<00:04:39.250> otherwise

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
times a week maximum because otherwise

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.990 
times a week maximum because otherwise
you're<00:04:40.060> stripping<00:04:40.419> away<00:04:40.660> other<00:04:41.199> than<00:04:41.410> this

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
you're stripping away other than this

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.689 
you're stripping away other than this
necessary<00:04:43.000> oils<00:04:43.720> in<00:04:43.870> order<00:04:44.080> for<00:04:44.380> your<00:04:44.650> hair<00:04:45.400> to

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:45.699 
necessary oils in order for your hair to

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:48.360 
necessary oils in order for your hair to
grow<00:04:45.910> optimally<00:04:46.750> so<00:04:47.259> the<00:04:47.590> idea<00:04:47.889> is<00:04:48.130> to

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370 
grow optimally so the idea is to

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.909 
grow optimally so the idea is to
preserve<00:04:48.669> restore<00:04:49.389> that<00:04:49.599> pH<00:04:49.960> balance<00:04:50.470> you

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:50.919 
preserve restore that pH balance you

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:52.830 
preserve restore that pH balance you
will<00:04:51.190> see<00:04:51.490> a<00:04:51.520> difference<00:04:52.030> within<00:04:52.090> a<00:04:52.449> couple<00:04:52.599> of

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840 
will see a difference within a couple of

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.260 
will see a difference within a couple of
uses<00:04:53.080> and<00:04:53.530> each<00:04:54.160> of<00:04:54.310> this<00:04:54.430> brings<00:04:54.880> its

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 
uses and each of this brings its

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.570 
uses and each of this brings its
benefits<00:04:55.870> so<00:04:56.110> the<00:04:56.560> renewing<00:04:56.889> scalp<00:04:57.160> cleanser

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
benefits so the renewing scalp cleanser

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.640 
benefits so the renewing scalp cleanser
you<00:04:57.759> use<00:04:57.910> that<00:04:58.090> before<00:04:58.509> you<00:04:58.750> shampoo<00:04:59.259> your

00:05:18.749 --> 00:05:18.759 
as I mentioned you might want to make it

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:21.839 
as I mentioned you might want to make it
part<00:05:19.000> of<00:05:19.120> your<00:05:19.180> daily<00:05:19.900> morning<00:05:20.500> regimen<00:05:21.400> or<00:05:21.580> at

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:31.449 
great thing about the scalp protecting

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:33.600 
great thing about the scalp protecting
mist<00:05:31.659> is<00:05:31.930> that<00:05:32.110> it<00:05:32.289> removes<00:05:32.590> bacteria<00:05:32.860> it

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:33.610 
mist is that it removes bacteria it
