00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
video last um and I've had a lot of

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.410 
video last um and I've had a lot of
projects<00:00:08.220> going<00:00:08.400> on<00:00:08.610> but<00:00:08.940> just<00:00:09.090> nothing<00:00:09.240> that

projects going on but just nothing that
had<00:00:09.780> the<00:00:09.870> time<00:00:10.080> to<00:00:10.110> really<00:00:10.470> document<00:00:11.400> on<00:00:11.820> and

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
had the time to really document on and

had the time to really document on and
whatever<00:00:12.360> else<00:00:12.599> so<00:00:12.840> here's<00:00:13.440> one<00:00:13.620> project<00:00:14.009> that

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
whatever else so here's one project that

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.440 
whatever else so here's one project that
I<00:00:14.160> definitely<00:00:14.519> I'm<00:00:14.849> going<00:00:15.000> to<00:00:15.059> try<00:00:15.210> to<00:00:15.269> follow

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
I definitely I'm going to try to follow

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.029 
I definitely I'm going to try to follow
through<00:00:15.780> from<00:00:15.900> start<00:00:16.230> to<00:00:16.349> finish<00:00:16.379> which<00:00:16.949> I

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
through from start to finish which I

anyone is a sv rider form watch her out

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.739 
anyone is a sv rider form watch her out
there<00:00:27.619> but<00:00:28.619> anyways<00:00:28.890> I<00:00:29.159> love<00:00:29.339> the<00:00:29.429> bike<00:00:29.609> um<00:00:30.239> but

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:30.749 
there but anyways I love the bike um but

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:32.450 
there but anyways I love the bike um but
it's<00:00:30.869> got<00:00:31.019> some<00:00:31.349> aftermarket<00:00:31.859> taillights

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
it's got some aftermarket taillights

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.130 
it's got some aftermarket taillights
which<00:00:32.669> I<00:00:32.759> do<00:00:32.820> like<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.300> casing<00:00:33.660> looks<00:00:33.870> really

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
which I do like the casing looks really

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.319 
which I do like the casing looks really
good<00:00:34.350> it's<00:00:34.590> really<00:00:34.620> smooth<00:00:35.070> it's<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:36.059> the

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
good it's really smooth it's the the

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.459 
good it's really smooth it's the the
white<00:00:36.510> clear<00:00:36.809> casing<00:00:37.230> um<00:00:37.850> but<00:00:38.850> it<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.929> LEDs<00:00:40.320> on

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
white clear casing um but it the LEDs on

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.259 
white clear casing um but it the LEDs on
the<00:00:40.500> inside<00:00:40.890> are<00:00:41.039> not<00:00:41.190> very<00:00:41.370> bright

00:00:42.259 --> 00:00:42.269 
the inside are not very bright

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:43.700 
the inside are not very bright
instead<00:00:42.780> of<00:00:42.870> trying<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.170> increase<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.589> power

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
instead of trying to increase the power

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:44.900 
instead of trying to increase the power
to<00:00:43.859> LEDs<00:00:44.219> because<00:00:44.519> I<00:00:44.550> don't<00:00:44.699> really<00:00:44.789> know

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
to LEDs because I don't really know

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.910 
to LEDs because I don't really know
what's<00:00:45.179> in<00:00:45.329> there<00:00:45.629> I<00:00:45.809> decided<00:00:46.559> just<00:00:46.710> to

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
what's in there I decided just to

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.619 
what's in there I decided just to
replace<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.399> LEDs<00:00:47.699> with<00:00:47.940> some<00:00:48.089> super<00:00:48.359> flux

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
replace the LEDs with some super flux

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.189 
replace the LEDs with some super flux
LEDs<00:00:49.170> that<00:00:49.199> I<00:00:49.440> found<00:00:49.620> from<00:00:49.829> ozium<00:00:50.399> they're<00:00:51.059> a

00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:51.199 
LEDs that I found from ozium they're a

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:55.549 
LEDs that I found from ozium they're a
lighting<00:00:52.199> supplier<00:00:54.170> I've<00:00:55.170> worked<00:00:55.350> with<00:00:55.440> them

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
lighting supplier I've worked with them

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:56.720 
lighting supplier I've worked with them
for<00:00:55.739> quite<00:00:55.769> a<00:00:55.949> while<00:00:56.159> and<00:00:56.370> they<00:00:56.429> have<00:00:56.579> some

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
for quite a while and they have some

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.180 
for quite a while and they have some
good<00:00:56.820> products<00:00:57.239> but<00:00:57.420> anyways<00:00:57.929> um<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.710> what<00:00:59.159> I

good products but anyways um and what I

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.709 
good products but anyways um and what I
wanted<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.489> do<00:00:59.609> is<00:00:59.760> I<00:00:59.850> also<00:00:59.999> wanted<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.449> hook<00:01:00.569> it

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
wanted to do is I also wanted to hook it

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.410 
wanted to do is I also wanted to hook it
up<00:01:00.780> with<00:01:00.839> Arduino<00:01:01.499> and<00:01:01.739> be<00:01:02.370> able<00:01:02.609> to<00:01:02.760> animate

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
up with Arduino and be able to animate

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.939 
up with Arduino and be able to animate
the<00:01:03.539> taillight<00:01:03.960> so<00:01:04.140> like<00:01:04.259> the<00:01:04.379> blinkers<00:01:04.769> have

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
the taillight so like the blinkers have

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.679 
the taillight so like the blinkers have
to<00:01:05.070> be<00:01:05.159> able<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.369> scroll<00:01:05.640> us<00:01:05.790> at<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:05.970> side<00:01:06.180> I'll

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
to be able to scroll us at the side I'll

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.660 
to be able to scroll us at the side I'll
show<00:01:06.869> you<00:01:06.930> what<00:01:07.140> I<00:01:07.170> mean<00:01:07.380> so<00:01:07.920> what<00:01:08.100> I<00:01:08.130> did<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.520> do

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
all that um is I got I've had my Arduino

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.539 
all that um is I got I've had my Arduino
board<00:01:12.840> I've<00:01:13.290> got<00:01:13.470> back<00:01:13.619> here<00:01:13.860> it's<00:01:14.220> just<00:01:14.430> the

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
board I've got back here it's just the

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.719 
board I've got back here it's just the
mega<00:01:14.759> 80k<00:01:15.659> I<00:01:16.560> originally<00:01:17.159> was<00:01:17.310> going<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:17.520> try

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
mega 80k I originally was going to try

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.450 
mega 80k I originally was going to try
to<00:01:17.790> do<00:01:17.969> some<00:01:18.119> more<00:01:18.299> stuff<00:01:18.509> with<00:01:18.630> my<00:01:18.780> phone<00:01:19.460> to

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
to do some more stuff with my phone to

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.700 
to do some more stuff with my phone to
try<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:20.939> I<00:01:21.540> don't<00:01:21.810> know<00:01:21.990> take<00:01:22.200> some<00:01:22.320> projects

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
try to I don't know take some projects

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.039 
try to I don't know take some projects
up<00:01:22.829> but<00:01:23.040> I<00:01:23.399> found<00:01:24.060> out<00:01:24.270> I'm<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:24.479> little<00:01:24.509> bit<00:01:24.869> over

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
up but I found out I'm a little bit over

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.469 
up but I found out I'm a little bit over
my<00:01:25.079> head<00:01:25.259> with<00:01:25.649> that<00:01:25.799> as<00:01:26.100> for<00:01:27.000> my<00:01:27.119> current

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
my head with that as for my current

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:28.789 
my head with that as for my current
knowledge<00:01:27.600> range<00:01:28.020> so<00:01:28.229> I'm<00:01:28.320> probably<00:01:28.500> gonna<00:01:28.680> be

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
knowledge range so I'm probably gonna be

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.679 
knowledge range so I'm probably gonna be
getting<00:01:29.039> just<00:01:29.159> a<00:01:29.280> little<00:01:29.520> hard<00:01:29.700> we<00:01:29.880> know<00:01:30.030> mini

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
getting just a little hard we know mini

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.719 
getting just a little hard we know mini
or<00:01:30.930> micro<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.439> just<00:01:31.890> throw<00:01:32.070> in<00:01:32.250> there<00:01:32.460> for<00:01:32.670> the

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
or micro to just throw in there for the

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.760 
or micro to just throw in there for the
bike<00:01:32.909> just<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.299> keep<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:34.409> keep<00:01:34.590> everything

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
bike just to keep and keep everything

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.779 
bike just to keep and keep everything
running<00:01:35.070> but<00:01:35.939> anyways<00:01:36.240> so<00:01:36.450> what<00:01:36.810> I<00:01:36.869> got<00:01:37.140> we're

00:01:37.779 --> 00:01:37.789 
running but anyways so what I got we're

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:43.810 
running but anyways so what I got we're
three<00:01:38.789> of<00:01:39.000> these<00:01:39.329> um<00:01:40.490> TLC<00:01:41.899> 59:40<00:01:42.899> and<00:01:43.140> tea

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
three of these um TLC 59:40 and tea

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.670 
three of these um TLC 59:40 and tea
chips<00:01:44.820> from<00:01:45.000> Texas<00:01:45.359> Instruments<00:01:45.539> what<00:01:46.500> this

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
chips from Texas Instruments what this

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.109 
chips from Texas Instruments what this
allows<00:01:47.009> each<00:01:47.759> of<00:01:48.509> these<00:01:48.570> chips<00:01:48.899> have<00:01:50.119> 16

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
allows each of these chips have 16

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.859 
allows each of these chips have 16
channels<00:01:51.750> of<00:01:51.960> PWM<00:01:52.619> outputs<00:01:53.210> each<00:01:54.210> so

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
channels of PWM outputs each so

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.410 
channels of PWM outputs each so
altogether<00:01:55.649> I've<00:01:55.829> got<00:01:56.009> what<00:01:56.310> 48<00:01:56.789> outputs

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
altogether I've got what 48 outputs

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.139 
altogether I've got what 48 outputs
where<00:01:57.630> I<00:01:57.659> can<00:01:57.840> use<00:01:58.049> now<00:01:58.770> it<00:01:59.609> may<00:01:59.820> not<00:01:59.850> look<00:02:00.090> like

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
where I can use now it may not look like

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.810 
where I can use now it may not look like
much<00:02:00.299> that's<00:02:01.170> because<00:02:01.409> these<00:02:01.649> LEDs<00:02:02.460> are<00:02:02.490> all

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
much that's because these LEDs are all

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.169 
much that's because these LEDs are all
RGB<00:02:03.420> leds<00:02:03.810> leds<00:02:04.020> so<00:02:04.710> they<00:02:04.979> have<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:06.000> red

00:02:06.169 --> 00:02:06.179 
RGB leds leds so they have the the red

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:09.410 
RGB leds leds so they have the the red
green<00:02:06.420> and<00:02:06.600> blue<00:02:06.780> light<00:02:07.320> in<00:02:07.679> each<00:02:07.979> bulb<00:02:08.420> but

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
green and blue light in each bulb but

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.020 
green and blue light in each bulb but
you<00:02:09.510> can<00:02:09.660> see<00:02:09.900> on<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:11.040> back<00:02:11.160> side<00:02:11.220> all<00:02:11.790> the

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
you can see on the back side all the

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.790 
you can see on the back side all the
pins<00:02:12.210> going<00:02:12.510> down<00:02:12.660> each<00:02:12.990> of<00:02:13.200> those

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
pins going down each of those

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.860 
pins going down each of those
pins<00:02:14.280> are<00:02:14.670> a<00:02:14.700> different<00:02:15.180> outlet<00:02:15.510> on<00:02:15.660> the

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
pins are a different outlet on the

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.250 
pins are a different outlet on the
backside<00:02:16.410> there<00:02:16.620> so<00:02:17.930> something<00:02:18.930> to<00:02:19.080> make<00:02:19.230> sure

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
backside there so something to make sure

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.020 
backside there so something to make sure
of<00:02:19.530> when<00:02:19.650> you're<00:02:19.830> if<00:02:20.490> you're<00:02:20.640> going<00:02:20.760> through<00:02:21.000> a

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
of when you're if you're going through a

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.880 
of when you're if you're going through a
project<00:02:21.240> to<00:02:21.540> get<00:02:21.660> some<00:02:21.870> of<00:02:21.960> this<00:02:22.020> hooked<00:02:22.260> up<00:02:22.410> if

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
project to get some of this hooked up if

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.280 
project to get some of this hooked up if
you're<00:02:23.070> making<00:02:23.310> this<00:02:23.370> your<00:02:23.550> own<00:02:23.670> is<00:02:24.660> that<00:02:25.080> the

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
you're making this your own is that the

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.470 
you're making this your own is that the
LEDs<00:02:25.770> you<00:02:26.010> use<00:02:26.250> especially<00:02:26.670> if<00:02:26.880> they're<00:02:27.000> RGB

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
LEDs you use especially if they're RGB

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.170 
LEDs you use especially if they're RGB
overly<00:02:28.440> only<00:02:28.710> at<00:02:28.800> their<00:02:28.860> RGB<00:02:29.310> is<00:02:29.550> that<00:02:30.060> they

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
overly only at their RGB is that they

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.710 
overly only at their RGB is that they
have<00:02:30.390> to<00:02:30.570> be<00:02:30.720> common<00:02:31.620> anode<00:02:32.280> which<00:02:32.910> means<00:02:33.240> that

have to be common anode which means that

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.360 
have to be common anode which means that
the<00:02:34.320> single-leg<00:02:35.070> that<00:02:35.730> either<00:02:36.000> gets<00:02:36.420> or<00:02:37.370> gets

these TLC chips when they they make the

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.330 
these TLC chips when they they make the
connection<00:02:52.410> and<00:02:52.680> control<00:02:53.160> everything

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
connection and control everything

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.730

through<00:02:53.670> the<00:02:53.790> p.m.<00:02:54.090> dub<00:02:54.360> or<00:02:54.570> the<00:02:54.690> PWM<00:02:55.200> outputs

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
through the p.m. dub or the PWM outputs

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.190 
through the p.m. dub or the PWM outputs
it<00:02:56.160> goes<00:02:56.520> straight<00:02:56.730> to<00:02:57.000> ground<00:02:57.270> so<00:02:57.810> your<00:02:57.990> power

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
it goes straight to ground so your power

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.260 
it goes straight to ground so your power
has<00:02:58.470> to<00:02:58.500> come<00:02:58.770> from<00:02:58.920> back<00:02:59.130> here<00:02:59.460> flow<00:03:00.030> through

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
has to come from back here flow through

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.090 
has to come from back here flow through
whatever<00:03:00.450> devices<00:03:00.930> you're<00:03:01.230> using<00:03:01.410> the

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
whatever devices you're using the

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.680 
whatever devices you're using the
devices<00:03:02.940> you<00:03:03.060> are<00:03:03.180> using<00:03:03.390> excuse<00:03:04.170> my<00:03:04.380> tongue

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
devices you are using excuse my tongue

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.950 
devices you are using excuse my tongue
and<00:03:06.690> then<00:03:07.050> flow<00:03:07.470> through<00:03:07.710> the<00:03:07.830> chips<00:03:08.130> which

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:08.960 
and then flow through the chips which

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.570 
and then flow through the chips which
regulate<00:03:09.960> how<00:03:10.140> much<00:03:10.320> power<00:03:10.590> these<00:03:10.950> get<00:03:11.310> how

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
regulate how much power these get how

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.280 
regulate how much power these get how
much<00:03:11.700> flows<00:03:11.970> through<00:03:12.270> and<00:03:12.480> then<00:03:12.840> it<00:03:12.960> grounds

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
much flows through and then it grounds

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.540 
much flows through and then it grounds
it<00:03:13.380> out<00:03:13.500> so<00:03:14.480> just<00:03:15.480> something<00:03:15.660> to<00:03:15.810> to<00:03:16.290> make

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:16.550 
it out so just something to to make

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.550 
it out so just something to to make
aware<00:03:17.550> of<00:03:17.730> when<00:03:17.940> you're<00:03:18.060> doing<00:03:18.330> that<00:03:18.560> the

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
aware of when you're doing that the

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.990 
aware of when you're doing that the
chips<00:03:19.950> are<00:03:20.910> easy<00:03:21.600> quote<00:03:22.230> very<00:03:22.560> easy<00:03:22.830> to<00:03:23.250> add

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
chips are easy quote very easy to add

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.660 
chips are easy quote very easy to add
onto<00:03:24.300> so<00:03:24.810> these<00:03:25.410> three<00:03:25.800> chips<00:03:26.070> are<00:03:26.310> just<00:03:26.520> kind

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
onto so these three chips are just kind

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.210 
onto so these three chips are just kind
of<00:03:26.700> daisy<00:03:26.970> chained<00:03:27.360> down<00:03:27.480> um<00:03:27.900> I<00:03:28.440> feel<00:03:28.920> like<00:03:28.980> I

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
of daisy chained down um I feel like I

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.130 
of daisy chained down um I feel like I
saw<00:03:29.400> you<00:03:29.459> can<00:03:29.730> go<00:03:29.850> up<00:03:29.970> to<00:03:30.090> 16<00:03:30.600> of<00:03:30.720> these<00:03:30.810> chips

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
saw you can go up to 16 of these chips

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.890 
saw you can go up to 16 of these chips
with<00:03:31.350> no<00:03:31.530> problem<00:03:32.330> don't<00:03:33.330> quote<00:03:33.600> me<00:03:33.750> on<00:03:33.780> that

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
with no problem don't quote me on that

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.720 
with no problem don't quote me on that
because<00:03:34.290> I<00:03:34.350> can't<00:03:34.770> remember<00:03:34.860> exactly<00:03:35.489> where<00:03:35.700> I

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
because I can't remember exactly where I

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.340 
because I can't remember exactly where I
read<00:03:36.090> that<00:03:36.300> or<00:03:36.510> where<00:03:36.690> I'm<00:03:36.780> pulling<00:03:37.080> that<00:03:37.140> out

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
read that or where I'm pulling that out

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:41.540 
read that or where I'm pulling that out
of<00:03:37.790> the<00:03:38.790> wiring<00:03:39.239> looks<00:03:39.510> a<00:03:39.720> little<00:03:40.310> messy<00:03:41.310> and

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
of the wiring looks a little messy and

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.580 
of the wiring looks a little messy and
jumbly<00:03:42.060> that's<00:03:42.600> just<00:03:42.750> because<00:03:42.840> I<00:03:42.989> have<00:03:43.200> just<00:03:43.530> a

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
jumbly that's just because I have just a

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.979 
jumbly that's just because I have just a
certain<00:03:43.890> length<00:03:44.100> wire<00:03:44.430> to<00:03:44.640> work<00:03:44.790> with<00:03:45.060> once<00:03:45.900> I

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
certain length wire to work with once I

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:47.690 
certain length wire to work with once I
get<00:03:46.140> these<00:03:46.260> all<00:03:46.470> on<00:03:46.680> a<00:03:46.709> perf<00:03:47.310> board<00:03:47.550> or<00:03:47.670> a

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
get these all on a perf board or a

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.750 
get these all on a perf board or a
printed<00:03:48.030> board<00:03:48.270> I'll<00:03:48.510> update<00:03:49.080> another<00:03:49.380> video

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
printed board I'll update another video

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.130 
printed board I'll update another video
and<00:03:50.760> that<00:03:51.000> should<00:03:51.150> help<00:03:51.270> you<00:03:51.420> hopefully<00:03:51.989> be<00:03:52.110> a

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
and that should help you hopefully be a

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:57.290 
and that should help you hopefully be a
lot<00:03:52.380> cleaner<00:03:54.200> but<00:03:55.200> yeah<00:03:55.860> the<00:03:56.850> only<00:03:56.970> thing<00:03:57.180> I

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 
lot cleaner but yeah the only thing I

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.290 
lot cleaner but yeah the only thing I
got<00:03:57.480> besides<00:03:57.720> this<00:03:58.170> hooked<00:03:58.440> up<00:03:59.090> just<00:04:00.090> on<00:04:00.180> this

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:00.300 
got besides this hooked up just on this

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:01.520 
got besides this hooked up just on this
extra<00:04:00.630> little<00:04:00.750> breadboard<00:04:01.110> over<00:04:01.260> here<00:04:01.440> is

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
extra little breadboard over here is

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.290 
extra little breadboard over here is
just<00:04:01.650> a<00:04:01.680> couple<00:04:01.890> buttons<00:04:02.040> to<00:04:02.760> simulate<00:04:03.000> the

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:03.300 
just a couple buttons to simulate the

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:07.940 
just a couple buttons to simulate the
stuff<00:04:03.510> on<00:04:03.630> the<00:04:03.720> bike<00:04:05.120> everything<00:04:06.120> a<00:04:06.950> few

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
stuff on the bike everything a few

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.449 
stuff on the bike everything a few
pulldown<00:04:08.250> resistors<00:04:08.730> and<00:04:08.850> everything<00:04:09.270> so<00:04:09.660> uh

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459 
pulldown resistors and everything so uh

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:13.820 
pulldown resistors and everything so uh
yeah<00:04:11.459> that's<00:04:11.790> that's<00:04:12.090> pretty<00:04:12.600> much<00:04:12.690> it<00:04:12.959> um<00:04:13.140> the

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:13.830 
yeah that's that's pretty much it um the

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:15.110 
yeah that's that's pretty much it um the
other<00:04:13.950> thing<00:04:14.130> is<00:04:14.280> that<00:04:14.310> when<00:04:14.730> you're<00:04:14.850> when

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
other thing is that when you're when

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.780 
other thing is that when you're when
you're<00:04:15.150> powering<00:04:15.570> your<00:04:15.780> LEDs<00:04:16.169> and<00:04:16.410> such<00:04:16.790> put

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:17.790 
you're powering your LEDs and such put

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:19.130 
you're powering your LEDs and such put
these<00:04:17.910> on<00:04:18.060> a<00:04:18.090> different<00:04:18.359> power<00:04:18.600> source<00:04:18.959> and

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:19.140 
these on a different power source and

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:21.289 
these on a different power source and
from<00:04:19.260> your<00:04:19.410> Arduino<00:04:19.919> board<00:04:20.190> a<00:04:20.640> lot<00:04:21.120> of

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
from your Arduino board a lot of

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:23.120 
from your Arduino board a lot of
schematics<00:04:21.780> I've<00:04:21.960> seen<00:04:22.229> have<00:04:22.560> pulled<00:04:22.919> it

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
schematics I've seen have pulled it

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:24.770 
schematics I've seen have pulled it
straight<00:04:23.430> from<00:04:23.520> the<00:04:23.610> 5<00:04:23.880> volts<00:04:24.300> coming<00:04:24.539> off<00:04:24.660> the

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
straight from the 5 volts coming off the

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:25.810 
straight from the 5 volts coming off the
Arduino

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
Arduino

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.370 
Arduino
using<00:04:26.210> the<00:04:26.270> power<00:04:26.390> regulator<00:04:26.810> on<00:04:26.870> there<00:04:27.200> to

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380 
using the power regulator on there to

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.160 
using the power regulator on there to
provide<00:04:27.560> power<00:04:27.830> for<00:04:27.950> this<00:04:28.250> stuff<00:04:28.490> I<00:04:29.360> found<00:04:29.960> out

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:30.170 
provide power for this stuff I found out

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:32.470 
provide power for this stuff I found out
that<00:04:30.350> I<00:04:30.410> was<00:04:30.740> very<00:04:30.770> very<00:04:31.250> very<00:04:31.520> close<00:04:31.970> to<00:04:32.300> the

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:32.480 
that I was very very very close to the

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.510 
that I was very very very close to the
maximum<00:04:32.900> range<00:04:33.080> than<00:04:33.290> the<00:04:33.320> Arduino<00:04:33.650> which<00:04:34.280> I

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
maximum range than the Arduino which I

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.040 
maximum range than the Arduino which I
mean<00:04:34.910> I'm<00:04:35.030> sure<00:04:35.210> the<00:04:35.360> Arduino<00:04:35.750> could<00:04:35.900> take

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
mean I'm sure the Arduino could take

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.460 
mean I'm sure the Arduino could take
more<00:04:36.380> but<00:04:36.950> rather<00:04:37.310> than<00:04:37.640> chance<00:04:37.970> it<00:04:38.180> I<00:04:38.410> all<00:04:39.410> I

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
more but rather than chance it I all I

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.880 
more but rather than chance it I all I
did<00:04:39.830> was<00:04:40.040> I<00:04:40.220> got<00:04:41.090> this<00:04:41.330> USB<00:04:42.080> cord<00:04:42.440> running<00:04:42.650> back

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:42.890 
did was I got this USB cord running back

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:44.590 
did was I got this USB cord running back
just<00:04:43.580> to<00:04:43.670> a<00:04:43.700> cell<00:04:43.940> phone<00:04:44.060> charger<00:04:44.120> you<00:04:44.420> can't

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:44.600 
just to a cell phone charger you can't

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:45.940 
just to a cell phone charger you can't
really<00:04:44.720> see<00:04:44.900> it<00:04:44.990> back<00:04:45.140> there

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:45.950 
really see it back there

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:47.890 
really see it back there
and<00:04:46.340> all<00:04:46.430> I<00:04:46.460> did<00:04:46.580> is<00:04:46.730> I<00:04:46.850> just<00:04:46.880> snip<00:04:47.450> the<00:04:47.480> end<00:04:47.720> off

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900 
and all I did is I just snip the end off

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.080 
and all I did is I just snip the end off
it's<00:04:48.530> 5<00:04:48.770> volts<00:04:49.130> right<00:04:49.310> in<00:04:49.490> exact<00:04:49.970> code

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090 
it's 5 volts right in exact code

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.270 
it's 5 volts right in exact code
everything<00:04:50.390> else<00:04:50.540> uses<00:04:50.900> and<00:04:51.800> then<00:04:51.890> you<00:04:52.040> just

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 
everything else uses and then you just

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:56.200 
everything else uses and then you just
tie<00:04:52.550> the<00:04:52.610> ground<00:04:53.770> here<00:04:54.770> the<00:04:55.310> ground<00:04:55.580> from<00:04:55.940> the

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210 
tie the ground here the ground from the

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:58.840 
tie the ground here the ground from the
from<00:04:56.540> your<00:04:56.660> cell<00:04:56.900> phone<00:04:57.110> or<00:04:57.470> whatever<00:04:58.340> USB

00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:58.850 
from your cell phone or whatever USB

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:00.430 
from your cell phone or whatever USB
cord<00:04:59.120> using<00:04:59.420> doesn't<00:04:59.660> matter<00:04:59.780> what<00:05:00.020> it<00:05:00.110> is<00:05:00.140> and

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:00.440 
cord using doesn't matter what it is and

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.080 
cord using doesn't matter what it is and
just<00:05:00.500> tie<00:05:01.070> the<00:05:01.130> grounding<00:05:01.580> over<00:05:01.730> there

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090 
just tie the grounding over there

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.360 
just tie the grounding over there
because<00:05:02.690> your<00:05:02.990> ground<00:05:03.320> if<00:05:03.710> you're<00:05:03.950> using<00:05:04.100> the

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:04.370 
because your ground if you're using the

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.060 
because your ground if you're using the
5<00:05:04.610> volts<00:05:04.910> in<00:05:05.000> your<00:05:05.120> Arduino<00:05:05.660> to<00:05:06.200> power<00:05:06.410> the

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:07.070 
5 volts in your Arduino to power the

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:09.970 
5 volts in your Arduino to power the
chips<00:05:07.460> um<00:05:08.080> you'll<00:05:09.080> need<00:05:09.260> to<00:05:09.350> tie<00:05:09.500> that<00:05:09.710> ground

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:09.980 
chips um you'll need to tie that ground

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.470 
chips um you'll need to tie that ground
and<00:05:10.130> because<00:05:10.310> the<00:05:10.430> ground<00:05:10.640> coming<00:05:11.270> out<00:05:11.360> of

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:11.480 
and because the ground coming out of

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.470 
and because the ground coming out of
here<00:05:11.840> is<00:05:12.020> going<00:05:12.530> back<00:05:12.710> into<00:05:12.890> that<00:05:13.070> side<00:05:13.480> if

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:14.480 
here is going back into that side if

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.150 
here is going back into that side if

that makes any sort of sense which

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.500 
that makes any sort of sense which
probably<00:05:16.430> doesn't<00:05:16.610> cuz<00:05:16.940> I'm<00:05:17.030> just<00:05:17.240> mumbling

about<00:05:29.600> an<00:05:29.750> hour<00:05:29.900> long<00:05:30.170> video<00:05:30.590> but<00:05:30.920> it's<00:05:31.550> really

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:32.030 
about an hour long video but it's really

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:34.270 
about an hour long video but it's really
really<00:05:32.660> good<00:05:32.870> he<00:05:33.710> really<00:05:33.740> knows<00:05:34.040> what<00:05:34.160> he's

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:34.280 
really good he really knows what he's

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.010 
really good he really knows what he's
talking<00:05:34.580> about<00:05:34.610> he<00:05:35.000> actually<00:05:35.300> read<00:05:35.480> it<00:05:35.510> or

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:36.020 
talking about he actually read it or

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.310 
talking about he actually read it or
wrote<00:05:36.440> his<00:05:36.620> own<00:05:36.800> code<00:05:37.040> excuse<00:05:37.580> me<00:05:38.050> which<00:05:39.050> does

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:39.320 
wrote his own code excuse me which does

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:42.130 
wrote his own code excuse me which does
it<00:05:39.440> all<00:05:39.560> in<00:05:39.800> a<00:05:39.890> much<00:05:40.100> more<00:05:40.870> efficient<00:05:41.870> manner<00:05:41.960> I

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:42.140 
it all in a much more efficient manner I

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:45.160 
it all in a much more efficient manner I
guess<00:05:42.790> there<00:05:43.790> is<00:05:43.940> a<00:05:43.970> library<00:05:44.540> out<00:05:44.750> there<00:05:44.930> that

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:45.170 
guess there is a library out there that

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:49.060 
guess there is a library out there that
you<00:05:45.260> can<00:05:45.440> use<00:05:45.650> to<00:05:45.980> plug<00:05:46.310> the<00:05:46.610> the<00:05:47.920> decoding<00:05:48.920> in

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:49.070 
you can use to plug the the decoding in

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:51.670 
you can use to plug the the decoding in
for<00:05:49.280> these<00:05:49.400> th<00:05:49.610> e<00:05:49.850> TLC<00:05:50.480> chips<00:05:50.810> into<00:05:51.500> the

for these th e TLC chips into the
Arduino<00:05:51.950> IDE<00:05:54.220> it's<00:05:55.220> a<00:05:55.340> little<00:05:55.550> bit<00:05:55.640> clumsy<00:05:55.880> but

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:56.090 
Arduino IDE it's a little bit clumsy but

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:58.630 
Arduino IDE it's a little bit clumsy but
does<00:05:56.570> work<00:05:56.950> enough<00:05:57.950> of<00:05:58.070> me<00:05:58.160> rambling<00:05:58.490> I'll

00:05:58.630 --> 00:05:58.640 
does work enough of me rambling I'll

00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:59.650 
does work enough of me rambling I'll
just<00:05:58.760> show<00:05:58.880> you<00:05:58.910> what<00:05:59.090> it<00:05:59.150> doesn't<00:05:59.480> get<00:05:59.570> out

00:05:59.650 --> 00:05:59.660 
just show you what it doesn't get out

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:04.000 
just show you what it doesn't get out
here<00:05:59.840> here<00:05:59.990> so<00:06:00.410> a<00:06:01.040> left<00:06:01.910> blinker<00:06:02.860> Scrolls<00:06:03.860> out

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:04.010 
here here so a left blinker Scrolls out

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:06.760 
here here so a left blinker Scrolls out

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:14.720 
few pulses a few strobes and then it

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.720 
few pulses a few strobes and then it
stays<00:06:14.960> on<00:06:15.200> and<00:06:15.440> I<00:06:15.590> kind<00:06:15.980> of<00:06:16.100> programmed<00:06:16.490> in<00:06:16.640> a

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:19.040 
like a breathing pattern of sorts didn't

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:20.020 
like a breathing pattern of sorts didn't
know<00:06:19.100> what<00:06:19.220> else<00:06:19.310> to<00:06:19.460> call<00:06:19.490> it

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:20.030 
know what else to call it

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:22.300 
know what else to call it
I<00:06:20.060> just<00:06:20.570> kind<00:06:20.780> of<00:06:20.810> slowly<00:06:21.200> fades<00:06:21.560> on<00:06:21.740> and<00:06:21.920> off<00:06:22.010> I

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:22.310 
I just kind of slowly fades on and off I

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:24.430 
I just kind of slowly fades on and off I
really<00:06:22.970> like<00:06:23.150> the<00:06:23.360> look<00:06:23.570> of<00:06:23.660> the<00:06:23.810> effect<00:06:24.170> I

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:24.440 
really like the look of the effect I

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.410 
really like the look of the effect I
don't<00:06:25.220> know<00:06:25.310> if<00:06:25.400> I'll<00:06:25.490> actually<00:06:25.520> keep<00:06:26.090> it<00:06:26.270> when

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:26.420 
don't know if I'll actually keep it when

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:30.239 
don't know if I'll actually keep it when
I<00:06:26.450> have<00:06:26.750> it<00:06:26.870> on<00:06:27.080> the<00:06:27.200> bike<00:06:27.790> just<00:06:28.790> because

00:06:30.239 --> 00:06:30.249 
I have it on the bike just because

00:06:30.249 --> 00:06:33.599 
I have it on the bike just because
I<00:06:30.959> don't<00:06:31.959> know<00:06:32.079> how<00:06:32.229> legal<00:06:32.499> it<00:06:32.769> is<00:06:32.799> I'll<00:06:33.549> have

00:06:33.599 --> 00:06:33.609 
I don't know how legal it is I'll have

00:06:33.609 --> 00:06:35.639 
I don't know how legal it is I'll have
to<00:06:33.699> look<00:06:33.879> into<00:06:34.029> that<00:06:34.269> but<00:06:34.839> what<00:06:35.319> we'll<00:06:35.499> see

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:35.649 
to look into that but what we'll see

00:06:35.649 --> 00:06:37.859 
to look into that but what we'll see
when<00:06:35.769> I<00:06:35.829> get<00:06:35.949> there<00:06:36.219> and<00:06:36.939> then<00:06:37.149> I<00:06:37.269> also<00:06:37.479> have

00:06:37.859 --> 00:06:37.869 
when I get there and then I also have

00:06:37.869 --> 00:06:40.529 
when I get there and then I also have
these<00:06:38.859> would<00:06:39.069> be<00:06:39.159> like<00:06:39.339> the<00:06:39.489> hazard<00:06:39.879> lights<00:06:39.909> so

00:06:40.529 --> 00:06:40.539 
these would be like the hazard lights so

00:06:40.539 --> 00:06:42.689 
these would be like the hazard lights so
it's<00:06:40.989> hard<00:06:41.289> to<00:06:41.409> see<00:06:41.589> on<00:06:41.619> the<00:06:41.859> camera<00:06:42.549> it's

00:06:42.689 --> 00:06:42.699 
it's hard to see on the camera it's

00:06:42.699 --> 00:06:46.079 
it's hard to see on the camera it's
probably<00:06:42.939> looks<00:06:43.089> a<00:06:43.179> little<00:06:43.419> flashy<00:06:44.229> but<00:06:45.219> but

00:06:46.079 --> 00:06:46.089 
probably looks a little flashy but but

00:06:46.089 --> 00:06:49.169 
probably looks a little flashy but but
all<00:06:46.209> it<00:06:46.389> is<00:06:46.509> is<00:06:46.779> it's<00:06:47.079> just<00:06:47.469> the<00:06:47.769> LEDs<00:06:48.249> or

00:06:49.169 --> 00:06:49.179 
all it is is it's just the LEDs or

00:06:49.179 --> 00:06:50.909 
all it is is it's just the LEDs or
orange<00:06:49.659> scrolling<00:06:50.049> off<00:06:50.169> in<00:06:50.349> the<00:06:50.409> center<00:06:50.709> and

00:06:50.909 --> 00:06:50.919 
orange scrolling off in the center and

00:06:50.919 --> 00:06:53.849 
orange scrolling off in the center and
then<00:06:51.159> a<00:06:51.459> few<00:06:51.699> strokes<00:06:52.149> of<00:06:52.449> red<00:06:52.829> from<00:06:53.829> the

00:06:53.849 --> 00:06:53.859 
then a few strokes of red from the

00:06:53.859 --> 00:06:58.079 
then a few strokes of red from the
overall<00:06:55.769> fixture<00:06:56.769> or<00:06:56.919> whatever<00:06:57.189> so<00:06:57.759> anyways

00:06:58.079 --> 00:06:58.089 
overall fixture or whatever so anyways

00:06:58.089 --> 00:06:59.819 
overall fixture or whatever so anyways
that's<00:06:58.299> all<00:06:58.509> I've<00:06:58.629> got<00:06:58.659> so<00:06:58.899> far

00:06:59.819 --> 00:06:59.829 
that's all I've got so far

00:06:59.829 --> 00:07:01.259 
that's all I've got so far
eventually<00:07:00.549> I'm<00:07:00.639> going<00:07:00.759> to<00:07:00.849> take<00:07:00.999> the<00:07:01.089> back

00:07:01.259 --> 00:07:01.269 
eventually I'm going to take the back

00:07:01.269 --> 00:07:03.899 
eventually I'm going to take the back
end<00:07:01.509> off<00:07:01.659> the<00:07:01.809> bike<00:07:01.989> and<00:07:02.289> get<00:07:02.409> everything<00:07:02.909> in

00:07:03.899 --> 00:07:03.909 
end off the bike and get everything in

00:07:03.909 --> 00:07:06.199 
end off the bike and get everything in
to<00:07:04.179> where<00:07:04.360> it<00:07:04.509> should<00:07:04.539> be

00:07:06.199 --> 00:07:06.209 
to where it should be

00:07:06.209 --> 00:07:08.429 
to where it should be
I'll<00:07:07.209> probably<00:07:07.419> do<00:07:07.599> that<00:07:07.749> this<00:07:07.929> weekend<00:07:08.319> it's

00:07:08.429 --> 00:07:08.439 
I'll probably do that this weekend it's

00:07:08.439 --> 00:07:09.539 
I'll probably do that this weekend it's
supposed<00:07:08.619> to<00:07:08.679> rain<00:07:08.860> a<00:07:08.919> bit<00:07:09.129> so<00:07:09.279> I<00:07:09.309> won't<00:07:09.459> be

00:07:09.539 --> 00:07:09.549 
supposed to rain a bit so I won't be

00:07:09.549 --> 00:07:11.669 
supposed to rain a bit so I won't be
taking<00:07:09.849> it<00:07:09.939> out<00:07:10.059> so<00:07:10.389> at<00:07:10.929> least<00:07:11.079> I<00:07:11.229> can<00:07:11.379> park<00:07:11.589> it

00:07:11.669 --> 00:07:11.679 
taking it out so at least I can park it

00:07:11.679 --> 00:07:14.039 
taking it out so at least I can park it
in<00:07:11.799> the<00:07:12.099> garage<00:07:12.449> the<00:07:13.449> neighbors<00:07:13.749> get<00:07:13.869> their

00:07:14.039 --> 00:07:14.049 
in the garage the neighbors get their

00:07:14.049 --> 00:07:17.639 
in the garage the neighbors get their
toy<00:07:14.349> trains<00:07:14.619> out<00:07:14.799> of<00:07:14.860> there<00:07:15.209> anyways<00:07:16.209> I<00:07:16.649> will

00:07:17.639 --> 00:07:17.649 
toy trains out of there anyways I will

00:07:17.649 --> 00:07:21.779 
toy trains out of there anyways I will
keep<00:07:17.949> you<00:07:18.069> updated<00:07:18.249> on<00:07:18.699> this<00:07:18.879> I<00:07:19.089> promise<00:07:20.789> but
