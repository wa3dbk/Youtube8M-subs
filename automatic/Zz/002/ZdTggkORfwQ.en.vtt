00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.500
The flinch in your eye calls your bluff

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:17.000
Feel free to die when you've had enough

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.500
Useless cause is breaking your back

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.000
Your life will end when you attack

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:39.000
Make your move, make your stand
Make the win, (hah) Like you can

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:45.000
See the war, See me rule
See the mirror, you'll see a fool

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:52.000
To take me out you must fight like a man
(To take me out you must fight like a man)

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:58.000
You've yet to proven that you can
(You've yet to proven that you can)

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:04.500
I see your might it compares to something
(I see your might it compares to something)

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000
That is if something is nothing
(That is if something is nothing)

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:17.750
Time to figure, time to sin
Your time's done when you begin

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Live for suffer, life for revenge
Know your life comes to an end

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:30.000
Taste the blood, taste your fate
Swallow your pride with your hate

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:36.000
Your last breath, your last stance
The last of all in your command

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.800
Knees in the blood with your crying pleas
Wade in your sorrow, bathe in your fear

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Clear your mind from righteousness suffered
Wittnes the moment your failures prosper
