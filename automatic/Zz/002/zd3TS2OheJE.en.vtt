00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
 channel sponsor thermaltake 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.259
 thermaltake play even better all hello 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.240
 you have a novel and this is a techno-kitchen 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.700
 install two video cards in one 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.009
 the computer must have dreamed each of us 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.230
 And many have tried, let's not water 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.830
 open this topic and most importantly, we will understand 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.380
 terms 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.510
 whole this geforce video card from 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.470
 Corporation nvidia crossfire when 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.080
 radeon video card 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.330
 not all video cards from md 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.550
 support joins and all 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.800
 motherboards have the support and 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.230
 of processors only and 7 and preferably with 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.300
 Okay index 1 for such a turn of affairs 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.059
 other processors will not open 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:42.239
 union for ligaments need two 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.430
 identical chips for example two gtx 770 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.570
 often important having the same 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.520
 memory capacity 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.140
 to avoid problems just buy 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.360
 two identical video cards 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.520
 video memory is not cumulative as they think 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.949
 many but now the main thing 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.899
 does it make any sense considering 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.210
 that power supplies are needed more powerful 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.550
 definitely ligaments need to do the case 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.979
 top graphics cards just because 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:09.710
 there is nothing more powerful on the market 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.710
 get maximum fps take two top 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:15.720
 such implementation is justified in the case of 4-ke 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.640
 permissions still single cards for 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.470
 it is not the same in the case of 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.570
 games on three monitors 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.729
 and now the most important thing is to do 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.130
 layer or crossfire is not on top 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.689
 video cards here all just make 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.119
 list of favorite games 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:33.240
 if at least one of them does not support 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:36.659
 tandem it is contraindicated to you and better 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.390
 aim to buy top and if 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:42.270
 ok you play for example only 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.259
 battlefield 4 or gta 5 then look 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.350
 tests 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:50.159
 if they see two video cards give out fps 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:52.470
 more than 1 and less expensive than top 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.240
 you need to decide on a tandem only 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.210
 make sure the power of your unit 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:00.149
 there is enough power supply and in a wheelbarrow there are 4 790 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.820
 system board key supporting 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:05.640
 overclocking without limits + processor and 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:09.119
 cooler in your opinion full hd with interest 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:12.850
 enough for such video cards as gtx 970 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:16.510
 and r9 290x and in general there is no point for a thief 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:18.700
 with you sl or crossfire in the market 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.370
 more already have a large number more 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.460
 cool video cards if you want to 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:27.090
 play witch with hair or gta 5 with 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:29.040
 knee-deep buy fury x or 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.440
 980ti 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.720
 fence 2 970 do not recommend although we know 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.210
 that your hands are very itchy 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:41.200
 and in case of 4, you can and will aim at 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:41.710
 purchase of two tops 2,980 ti or 2 fury 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.260
 x 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:45.040
 as for the solution two chips on one 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.410
 video card 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:51.300
 this song is separate and about this next 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.300
 once you had an affair all bye bye
