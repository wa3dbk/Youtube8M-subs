00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
she's actually able to but it looks at

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.560 
she's actually able to but it looks at
it<00:01:52.740> it<00:01:52.890> doesn't<00:01:53.009> make<00:01:53.220> sure<00:01:53.369> they<00:01:53.490> can't<00:01:53.700> so<00:01:53.970> it

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
it it doesn't make sure they can't so it

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.960 
it it doesn't make sure they can't so it
doesn't<00:01:54.930> say<00:01:55.080> I<00:01:55.289> wouldn't<00:01:55.530> put<00:01:55.649> it<00:01:55.740> right<00:01:55.970> so

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.400 
yeah I think they put it in the wrapping
really<00:01:59.190> well<00:01:59.340> but<00:01:59.670> it<00:01:59.789> just<00:01:59.820> very<00:02:00.330> long<00:02:00.539> as<00:02:01.259> you

a<00:03:05.850> whole<00:03:06.030> year<00:03:06.239> and<00:03:06.510> I<00:03:06.690> think<00:03:06.810> that's<00:03:07.019> for<00:03:07.290> the

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
a whole year and I think that's for the

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.220 
a whole year and I think that's for the
water<00:03:07.739> causes<00:03:08.190> it's<00:03:08.819> like<00:03:08.940> there's<00:03:09.090> a<00:03:09.150> whole

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
water causes it's like there's a whole

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.690 
water causes it's like there's a whole
but<00:03:10.230> I<00:03:10.440> really<00:03:10.680> like<00:03:10.860> how<00:03:11.190> our<00:03:11.340> head<00:03:11.520> is<00:03:11.610> my
