what's<00:00:00.299> up<00:00:00.420> guys<00:00:00.570> in<00:00:00.780> this<00:00:00.870> video<00:00:01.050> we'll<00:00:01.290> be

00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:01.439 
what's up guys in this video we'll be

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:03.500 
what's up guys in this video we'll be
testing<00:00:01.829> out<00:00:01.949> 3d<00:00:02.370> mark<00:00:02.610> on<00:00:02.760> the<00:00:02.850> galaxy<00:00:03.210> s3

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
testing out 3d mark on the galaxy s3

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.450 
testing out 3d mark on the galaxy s3
this<00:00:03.750> is<00:00:03.929> the<00:00:04.049> international<00:00:04.799> version<00:00:04.830> so<00:00:05.339> its

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
this is the international version so its

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.629 
this is the international version so its
quad-core<00:00:05.899> 1.4<00:00:06.899> gigahertz<00:00:07.230> and<00:00:07.919> only<00:00:08.429> one<00:00:08.610> can

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
quad-core 1.4 gigahertz and only one can

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.419 
quad-core 1.4 gigahertz and only one can
buy<00:00:08.940> ram<00:00:09.269> so<00:00:09.570> were<00:00:09.719> taken<00:00:10.110> into<00:00:10.200> account<00:00:10.429> now

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
buy ram so were taken into account now

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.190 
buy ram so were taken into account now
the<00:00:11.490> first<00:00:11.759> time<00:00:12.000> I<00:00:12.120> actually<00:00:12.210> run<00:00:12.540> this<00:00:12.719> on<00:00:12.990> my

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
the first time I actually run this on my

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.230 
the first time I actually run this on my
previous<00:00:13.559> video<00:00:14.070> it<00:00:14.280> didn't<00:00:14.580> work<00:00:14.730> and<00:00:15.089> what<00:00:15.210> I

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
previous video it didn't work and what I

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.330 
previous video it didn't work and what I
realize<00:00:15.599> you<00:00:15.750> have<00:00:15.900> to<00:00:16.020> do<00:00:16.170> is<00:00:16.410> on<00:00:16.650> tick<00:00:17.070> run

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
realize you have to do is on tick run

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.099 
realize you have to do is on tick run
demo<00:00:17.730> so<00:00:17.940> I'm<00:00:18.029> not<00:00:18.150> sure<00:00:18.240> if<00:00:18.390> that's<00:00:18.660> a<00:00:18.869> ram

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
demo so I'm not sure if that's a ram

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.349 
demo so I'm not sure if that's a ram
issue<00:00:19.140> a<00:00:19.680> memory<00:00:20.490> issue<00:00:20.640> i'm<00:00:20.880> not<00:00:21.090> sure<00:00:21.330> but

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
issue a memory issue i'm not sure but

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.720 
issue a memory issue i'm not sure but
nonetheless<00:00:22.170> it<00:00:22.410> runs<00:00:22.830> if<00:00:23.160> you<00:00:23.279> turn<00:00:23.460> it<00:00:23.580> off

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
nonetheless it runs if you turn it off

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.689 
nonetheless it runs if you turn it off
so<00:00:24.510> these<00:00:24.930> are<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.140> two<00:00:25.199> tests<00:00:25.650> at<00:00:25.800> 720p<00:00:26.310> and

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
so these are the two tests at 720p and

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.479 
so these are the two tests at 720p and
the<00:00:26.910> 1080<00:00:27.330> let's<00:00:28.140> do<00:00:28.710> it<00:00:29.480> and<00:00:30.480> it's<00:00:30.689> loading<00:00:31.050> up

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:31.489 
the 1080 let's do it and it's loading up

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:35.090 
the 1080 let's do it and it's loading up
so<00:00:32.489> in<00:00:32.940> terms<00:00:33.329> of<00:00:33.510> hardware<00:00:33.719> guys<00:00:34.140> is<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.469> 1.4

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
so in terms of hardware guys is the 1.4

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.160 
so in terms of hardware guys is the 1.4
do<00:00:35.250> you<00:00:35.340> host<00:00:35.520> quad-core<00:00:36.090> x<00:00:36.270> no<00:00:36.450> cpu<00:00:36.899> with<00:00:37.079> the

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
do you host quad-core x no cpu with the

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.790 
do you host quad-core x no cpu with the
Mallee<00:00:37.410> 400<00:00:38.100> GPU<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:39.030> Mallee<00:00:39.270> 400<00:00:39.899> guys<00:00:40.050> is<00:00:40.500> or

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
Mallee 400 GPU the Mallee 400 guys is or

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.670 
Mallee 400 GPU the Mallee 400 guys is or
was<00:00:41.190> one<00:00:41.550> of<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.820> absolute<00:00:42.090> kings<00:00:42.899> of<00:00:43.140> android

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
was one of the absolute kings of android

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.190 
was one of the absolute kings of android
it<00:00:43.890> is<00:00:44.520> quite<00:00:45.030> old<00:00:45.270> now<00:00:45.390> and<00:00:45.539> you<00:00:45.840> can<00:00:45.960> see

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
it is quite old now and you can see

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.830 
it is quite old now and you can see
already<00:00:46.500> we<00:00:46.860> are<00:00:47.100> getting<00:00:47.579> very<00:00:47.820> very<00:00:48.239> choppy

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
already we are getting very very choppy

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.470 
already we are getting very very choppy
frame<00:00:49.260> rates<00:00:49.530> don't<00:00:50.280> forget<00:00:50.550> this<00:00:50.820> device<00:00:51.210> is

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
frame rates don't forget this device is

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.750 
frame rates don't forget this device is
a<00:00:51.510> year<00:00:51.840> old<00:00:52.079> we<00:00:52.350> are<00:00:52.559> going<00:00:52.829> to<00:00:53.010> be<00:00:53.160> seeing<00:00:53.430> the

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
a year old we are going to be seeing the

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.520 
a year old we are going to be seeing the
galaxy<00:00:54.390> s4<00:00:54.719> right<00:00:55.170> around<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.500> corner

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
galaxy s4 right around the corner

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.069 
galaxy s4 right around the corner
sometimes<00:00:56.160> i<00:00:56.640> think<00:00:56.820> somewhere<00:00:57.390> somewhere

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
sometimes i think somewhere somewhere

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.650 
sometimes i think somewhere somewhere
around<00:00:58.170> 8<00:00:58.500> for<00:00:58.680> 24<00:00:59.219> something<00:00:59.640> like<00:00:59.789> that<00:00:59.969> so

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
around 8 for 24 something like that so

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.840 
around 8 for 24 something like that so
were<00:01:00.870> yeah<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:02.250> we're<00:01:02.489> back<00:01:02.609> with<00:01:02.789> the

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
were yeah and we're back with the

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.690 
were yeah and we're back with the
results<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.390> you<00:01:03.480> can<00:01:03.600> see<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.809> scores<00:01:04.700> 2731

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
results and you can see the scores 2731

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.120 
results and you can see the scores 2731
you<00:01:06.119> can<00:01:06.240> see<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.510> breakdown<00:01:06.750> here<00:01:07.229> it's<00:01:07.830> got

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
you can see the breakdown here it's got

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.990 
you can see the breakdown here it's got
the<00:01:08.280> two<00:01:08.700> graphics<00:01:09.150> test<00:01:09.390> 7.2<00:01:10.229> FPS<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:11.040> 16<00:01:11.520> FPS

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
the two graphics test 7.2 FPS and 16 FPS

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.320 
the two graphics test 7.2 FPS and 16 FPS
the<00:01:12.540> physics<00:01:12.930> test<00:01:13.140> is<00:01:13.530> quite<00:01:14.070> respectable<00:01:14.670> 28

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
the physics test is quite respectable 28

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.210 
the physics test is quite respectable 28
FPS<00:01:15.840> so<00:01:16.020> you<00:01:16.110> can<00:01:16.229> see<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.439> cpu<00:01:16.860> is<00:01:17.009> still

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
FPS so you can see the cpu is still

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.640 
FPS so you can see the cpu is still

should say as well but you can see in

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.490 
should say as well but you can see in
terms<00:01:32.880> of<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.060> scores<00:01:33.420> how<00:01:33.750> much<00:01:33.990> is<00:01:34.200> getting

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
terms of the scores how much is getting

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.590 
terms of the scores how much is getting
beat<00:01:34.680> by<00:01:34.890> now<00:01:35.100> you<00:01:35.159> can<00:01:35.400> see<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:36.270> high-end

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
beat by now you can see the high-end

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.359 
beat by now you can see the high-end
devices<00:01:36.869> like<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.290> HTC<00:01:37.680> One<00:01:38.040> and<00:01:38.159> getting

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
devices like the HTC One and getting

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.149 
devices like the HTC One and getting
10,000<00:01:39.119> 383<00:01:40.049> so<00:01:40.200> you<00:01:40.320> can<00:01:40.470> see<00:01:40.619> guys<00:01:40.860> it<00:01:41.009> is

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
10,000 383 so you can see guys it is

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.800 
10,000 383 so you can see guys it is
starting<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:41.670> show<00:01:41.790> its<00:01:41.939> age<00:01:42.240> now<00:01:42.630> I'm<00:01:42.689> going

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
starting to show its age now I'm going

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.260 
starting to show its age now I'm going
to<00:01:42.869> test<00:01:43.079> out<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.470> 1080p<00:01:44.100> web<00:01:44.460> version<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.180> it

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
to test out the 1080p web version and it

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.760 
to test out the 1080p web version and it
should<00:01:45.509> well<00:01:46.200> it's<00:01:46.320> probably<00:01:46.530> going<00:01:46.649> to<00:01:46.710> be

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
should well it's probably going to be

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.469 
should well it's probably going to be
even<00:01:46.920> worse<00:01:47.159> or<00:01:47.460> will<00:01:47.549> that<00:01:47.700> run<00:01:47.970> this<00:01:48.180> and

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
even worse or will that run this and

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.569 
even worse or will that run this and
again<00:01:49.290> I'll<00:01:49.759> meet<00:01:50.759> you<00:01:50.820> at<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.329> results<00:01:52.579> okay

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
again I'll meet you at the results okay

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:54.830 
again I'll meet you at the results okay
we're<00:01:53.790> back<00:01:53.820> with<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.240> scores<00:01:54.509> and<00:01:54.659> you<00:01:54.720> can

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
we're back with the scores and you can

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.609 
we're back with the scores and you can
see<00:01:54.990> it<00:01:55.110> scores<00:01:55.579> 2072<00:01:56.579> so<00:01:57.079> 2072<00:01:58.079> you<00:01:58.380> can<00:01:58.500> see

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
see it scores 2072 so 2072 you can see

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.980 
see it scores 2072 so 2072 you can see
the<00:01:58.740> break<00:01:58.950> down<00:01:59.130> here<00:01:59.399> in<00:01:59.610> the<00:02:00.299> two<00:02:00.479> graphics

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
the break down here in the two graphics

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.160 
the break down here in the two graphics
test<00:02:01.229> 5.9<00:02:01.920> FPS<00:02:02.399> 9.7<00:02:03.390> again<00:02:03.659> you<00:02:03.810> can<00:02:03.930> see<00:02:04.049> the

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
test 5.9 FPS 9.7 again you can see the

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.069 
test 5.9 FPS 9.7 again you can see the
GPU<00:02:04.590> is<00:02:04.619> showing<00:02:05.310> its<00:02:05.430> age<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:06.479> physics<00:02:06.869> test

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
GPU is showing its age the physics test

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.690 
GPU is showing its age the physics test
you<00:02:07.290> can<00:02:07.350> see<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.649> CPU<00:02:08.069> is<00:02:08.220> doing<00:02:08.459> much<00:02:08.640> better

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
you can see the CPU is doing much better

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.440 
you can see the CPU is doing much better
it's<00:02:09.179> a<00:02:09.709> 28.7<00:02:10.709> FPS

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
it's a 28.7 FPS

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.630 
it's a 28.7 FPS
you<00:02:11.540> know<00:02:11.690> so<00:02:11.840> the<00:02:11.930> CPU<00:02:12.379> its<00:02:12.590> quad-core<00:02:12.860> 1.5

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
you know so the CPU its quad-core 1.5

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.300 
you know so the CPU its quad-core 1.5
gigahertz<00:02:14.000> CPU<00:02:14.360> has<00:02:14.930> still<00:02:15.650> got<00:02:15.830> some<00:02:16.069> life<00:02:16.250> in

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
gigahertz CPU has still got some life in

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.270 
gigahertz CPU has still got some life in
it<00:02:16.610> that<00:02:16.849> is<00:02:17.000> for<00:02:17.450> sure<00:02:17.480> now<00:02:18.290> if<00:02:18.530> we<00:02:18.560> just<00:02:18.830> go

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
it that is for sure now if we just go

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.860 
it that is for sure now if we just go
ahead<00:02:19.400> and<00:02:19.519> check<00:02:19.819> out<00:02:20.000> the<00:02:20.150> device<00:02:20.420> channel

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
ahead and check out the device channel

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.020 
ahead and check out the device channel
you<00:02:21.769> can<00:02:21.890> see<00:02:22.099> is<00:02:22.340> getting<00:02:22.760> absolutely

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
you can see is getting absolutely

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.350 
you can see is getting absolutely
swamped<00:02:23.599> by<00:02:24.050> these<00:02:24.260> other<00:02:24.470> devices<00:02:24.940> I<00:02:25.940> don't

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
swamped by these other devices I don't

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.960 
swamped by these other devices I don't
even<00:02:26.480> know<00:02:26.660> what's<00:02:26.840> going<00:02:26.870> on<00:02:27.080> there<00:02:27.319> this

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
even know what's going on there this

this app doesn't run too well on the guy
sister<00:02:31.069> I'm<00:02:31.190> not<00:02:31.220> sure<00:02:31.610> why<00:02:31.880> you<00:02:32.120> can<00:02:32.569> see<00:02:32.720> that

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
sister I'm not sure why you can see that

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.420 
sister I'm not sure why you can see that
mess<00:02:32.989> up<00:02:33.140> you<00:02:33.230> can<00:02:33.319> see<00:02:33.500> on<00:02:33.650> the<00:02:33.800> extreme<00:02:34.130> test

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
mess up you can see on the extreme test

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.330 
mess up you can see on the extreme test
the<00:02:34.550> galaxy<00:02:34.880> s4<00:02:35.180> scores<00:02:35.450> nearly<00:02:36.140> 7,000<00:02:37.130> this

so mali-400 in this device guys is

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:46.270 
so mali-400 in this device guys is
starting<00:02:45.080> to<00:02:45.140> show<00:02:45.319> its<00:02:45.349> age<00:02:45.620> it's<00:02:45.680> not<00:02:46.250> a

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
starting to show its age it's not a

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.640 
starting to show its age it's not a
surprise<00:02:46.489> considering<00:02:47.239> it's<00:02:47.450> a<00:02:47.510> year<00:02:47.780> old<00:02:47.959> but

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
surprise considering it's a year old but

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.610 
surprise considering it's a year old but
yeah<00:02:49.400> that's<00:02:50.030> 3dmark<00:02:50.840> scores<00:02:51.140> for<00:02:51.319> the<00:02:51.380> galaxy

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
yeah that's 3dmark scores for the galaxy
