00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:04.910
 the bridge that connects with the camera, well, the star 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:07.910
 and that although it is true that it was going to happen towards the av 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.789

 min as they are 2 on earth and is wider and then if the sherpas of 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.010
 weapons from ee 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.790
 come before it the leader of iu 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.500
 and then I love making my own reality is that there is no nation without 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.960
 villa and then agreements and performance 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.960
 nor with the computers of people on the trails 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:53.840
 our action 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.300
 ten seconds 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.500
 Damian after ten seconds crisis 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.500
 the criteria for selecting the actors are not effectively 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.530
 professionals nor banners are 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.370
 the actors actually 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.640
 in prison only 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.570
 they inform us of nothing 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.570
 inform them is a scene in which 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.730
 for them maybe it's because he had the past you get along with her now 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.770
 imagine that he is a friend that is all right 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.210
 I feel that it is taking you once again to the representation 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.250
 and it moves you away from poverty 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.020
 we have been given the character 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.840
 I do not know if it's good or bad 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.540
 nobody escapes that is if I love it because it will be called have said that the guy 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.410
 of person that had to be surely she would have been 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.270
 all day juan antonio lladÃ³s 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.620
 this scale leads to that desire to do it brings as it is nothing 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.200
 I will get so open and 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.730
 is what they tell me 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.579
 complicated moments for example 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.299
 we know that they have been behind the first one but it does not matter in fact I 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.279
