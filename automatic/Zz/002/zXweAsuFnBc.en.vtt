00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.280 
everything and here you'll see me fail I
didn't<00:02:54.359> realize<00:02:54.690> when<00:02:54.989> you're<00:02:55.139> in<00:02:55.230> the

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
didn't realize when you're in the

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:56.690 
didn't realize when you're in the
gunship<00:02:55.620> that<00:02:55.829> you<00:02:55.950> could<00:02:56.129> actually<00:02:56.250> drive<00:02:56.639> it

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
gunship that you could actually drive it

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.849 
gunship that you could actually drive it
so<00:02:57.389> I<00:02:57.420> thought<00:02:57.720> I<00:02:57.750> was<00:02:57.930> just<00:02:58.139> taking<00:02:58.590> shots

00:02:58.849 --> 00:02:58.859 
so I thought I was just taking shots

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:00.860 
so I thought I was just taking shots
from<00:02:59.010> back<00:02:59.310> here<00:02:59.579> and<00:02:59.970> then<00:03:00.450> about<00:03:00.599> halfway

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
from back here and then about halfway

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.920 
from back here and then about halfway
through<00:03:01.079> this<00:03:01.470> I<00:03:01.620> actually<00:03:02.099> oh<00:03:02.609> I<00:03:03.420> could<00:03:03.810> move

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
through this I actually oh I could move

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.690 
through this I actually oh I could move
it<00:03:04.109> and<00:03:04.319> then<00:03:04.440> I<00:03:04.500> was<00:03:04.650> like<00:03:04.829> oh<00:03:05.040> my<00:03:05.220> god<00:03:05.430> I'm<00:03:05.609> an

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
it and then I was like oh my god I'm an

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:06.229 
it and then I was like oh my god I'm an
idiot

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
idiot

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:08.180

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:30.050 
modern warfare 2 first we're playing for
the<00:03:28.109> first<00:03:28.290> day<00:03:28.440> I<00:03:28.680> felt<00:03:28.980> like<00:03:29.370> we<00:03:29.669> were<00:03:29.819> trying

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.170 
the first day I felt like we were trying
to<00:03:30.389> like<00:03:30.599> it<00:03:30.780> so<00:03:30.989> much<00:03:31.049> and<00:03:31.440> that<00:03:32.310> we<00:03:32.970> wouldn't

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
to like it so much and that we wouldn't

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.479 
to like it so much and that we wouldn't
notice<00:03:33.359> things<00:03:33.660> that<00:03:33.840> we're<00:03:34.079> like<00:03:34.379> yeah<00:03:34.739> but

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:38.119 
notice things that we're like yeah but
we<00:03:35.639> wouldn't<00:03:36.030> accept<00:03:37.019> it<00:03:37.290> this<00:03:37.709> is<00:03:37.889> where<00:03:38.099> I

00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:38.129 
we wouldn't accept it this is where I

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:41.420 
we wouldn't accept it this is where I
realize<00:03:38.669> I<00:03:38.760> can<00:03:38.910> move<00:03:39.060> um<00:03:39.980> we<00:03:40.980> would<00:03:41.099> sort<00:03:41.340> of

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
realize I can move um we would sort of

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.879 
realize I can move um we would sort of
turn<00:03:41.609> our<00:03:41.790> heads<00:03:42.030> a<00:03:42.120> bit<00:03:42.299> and<00:03:42.530> with<00:03:43.530> this<00:03:43.680> game

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:43.889 
turn our heads a bit and with this game

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:46.339 
turn our heads a bit and with this game
I<00:03:44.129> I<00:03:44.160> I<00:03:44.819> realized<00:03:45.269> that<00:03:45.389> you<00:03:45.900> know<00:03:46.019> before

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:46.349 
I I I realized that you know before

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:48.979 
I I I realized that you know before
actually<00:03:47.160> purchasing<00:03:47.579> this<00:03:47.760> so<00:03:48.269> I<00:03:48.299> went<00:03:48.870> into

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
actually purchasing this so I went into

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:52.610 
actually purchasing this so I went into
it<00:03:49.109> looking<00:03:49.590> for<00:03:49.829> the<00:03:49.889> bad<00:03:50.040> things<00:03:50.340> and<00:03:51.620> I

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
it looking for the bad things and I

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.949 
it looking for the bad things and I
really<00:03:53.609> couldn't<00:03:53.879> find<00:03:53.940> any<00:03:54.299> not<00:03:54.540> not<00:03:54.840> an

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
really couldn't find any not not an

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:57.140 
really couldn't find any not not an
eight<00:03:55.079> hours<00:03:55.349> apply<00:03:55.590> I<00:03:55.620> can<00:03:55.980> find<00:03:56.280> anything<00:03:56.849> I

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
eight hours apply I can find anything I

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.030 
eight hours apply I can find anything I
was<00:03:57.299> really<00:03:57.629> thought<00:03:57.810> was<00:03:58.019> game<00:03:58.319> breaking<00:03:58.799> or

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
was really thought was game breaking or

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.890 
was really thought was game breaking or
took<00:03:59.819> away<00:04:00.090> from<00:04:00.120> it<00:04:00.449> at<00:04:00.569> all

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
took away from it at all

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.360 
took away from it at all
so<00:04:01.470> that's<00:04:01.620> what<00:04:01.739> that's<00:04:01.889> a<00:04:02.069> really<00:04:02.280> good

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
so that's what that's a really good

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.819 
so that's what that's a really good
thing<00:04:02.609> I<00:04:02.909> I<00:04:03.150> was<00:04:03.480> only<00:04:03.750> impressed<00:04:04.169> like<00:04:04.379> I<00:04:04.440> kept

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:04.829 
thing I I was only impressed like I kept

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:08.059 
thing I I was only impressed like I kept
I<00:04:05.099> kept<00:04:05.639> being<00:04:05.849> impressed<00:04:06.739> you<00:04:07.739> know<00:04:07.799> the<00:04:07.919> more

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:08.069 
I kept being impressed you know the more

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:09.530 
I kept being impressed you know the more
I<00:04:08.099> played<00:04:08.400> so<00:04:08.699> that's<00:04:08.879> definitely<00:04:09.120> good<00:04:09.389> thing

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
I played so that's definitely good thing

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.210 
I played so that's definitely good thing
but<00:04:10.169> the<00:04:10.260> main<00:04:10.409> things<00:04:10.650> I<00:04:10.799> really<00:04:11.040> love<00:04:11.190> about

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
but the main things I really love about

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.180 
but the main things I really love about
this<00:04:11.519> game<00:04:11.760> and<00:04:11.970> I<00:04:12.329> this<00:04:12.659> is<00:04:12.870> something<00:04:13.709> that<00:04:13.739> I

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
this game and I this is something that I

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.390 
this game and I this is something that I
couldn't<00:04:14.970> exactly<00:04:15.299> yo<00:04:15.979> place<00:04:16.979> my<00:04:17.130> finger<00:04:17.370> on

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
couldn't exactly yo place my finger on

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.129 
couldn't exactly yo place my finger on
it<00:04:17.519> at<00:04:17.940> the<00:04:18.030> beginning<00:04:18.239> but<00:04:18.389> I<00:04:18.599> realized

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:19.139 
it at the beginning but I realized

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:20.719 
it at the beginning but I realized
without<00:04:19.739> having<00:04:20.010> stopping<00:04:20.459> power

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:20.729 
without having stopping power

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:23.180 
without having stopping power
it<00:04:21.030> makes<00:04:21.479> the<00:04:21.659> game<00:04:21.690> so<00:04:21.840> much<00:04:22.380> more<00:04:22.979> fun

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
it makes the game so much more fun

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:24.890 
it makes the game so much more fun
because<00:04:23.849> you<00:04:23.969> can<00:04:24.120> make<00:04:24.270> so<00:04:24.570> many<00:04:24.599> more

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
because you can make so many more

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.080 
because you can make so many more
different<00:04:25.289> classes<00:04:25.740> and<00:04:25.940> it

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
different classes and it

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:28.820 
different classes and it
takes<00:04:27.240> it<00:04:27.570> actually<00:04:27.930> takes<00:04:28.169> some<00:04:28.260> bullets<00:04:28.710> to

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
takes it actually takes some bullets to

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.920 
takes it actually takes some bullets to
kill<00:04:28.860> people<00:04:29.190> unlike<00:04:29.610> morrow<00:04:29.850> fair<00:04:30.090> to<00:04:30.300> suck
