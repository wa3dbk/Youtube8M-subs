00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
so I'm just Fanning that base down so it

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.569 
so I'm just Fanning that base down so it
can<00:04:16.790> be<00:04:17.090> even<00:04:18.070> and<00:04:19.070> you<00:04:19.190> want<00:04:19.370> to<00:04:19.430> make<00:04:19.549> sure

you thin it down really good

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:23.770 
you thin it down really good

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:41.129 
and not just measuring to make sure it's
the<00:04:38.830> right<00:04:39.069> size<00:04:39.400> and<00:04:39.819> you<00:04:40.479> want<00:04:40.689> to<00:04:40.780> go<00:04:40.900> back
