00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
glass and by plate glass I mean it's

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.900 
glass and by plate glass I mean it's
quarter-inch<00:00:10.469> thick<00:00:10.730> that's<00:00:11.730> what<00:00:11.849> the

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
quarter-inch thick that's what the

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.009 
quarter-inch thick that's what the
industry<00:00:12.150> calls<00:00:12.210> it<00:00:12.509> plate<00:00:12.719> glass

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
industry calls it plate glass

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.049 
industry calls it plate glass
this<00:00:13.650> is<00:00:13.830> a<00:00:13.860> scrap<00:00:14.250> piece<00:00:14.460> it's<00:00:14.700> a<00:00:14.790> smaller

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
this is a scrap piece it's a smaller

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:16.129 
this is a scrap piece it's a smaller
piece<00:00:15.269> but<00:00:15.540> I'm<00:00:15.630> just<00:00:15.690> going<00:00:15.839> to<00:00:15.900> show<00:00:16.020> you<00:00:16.049> a

show you something a little bit bigger
and<00:00:19.619> how<00:00:19.740> we<00:00:19.800> cut<00:00:20.369> in<00:00:20.490> and<00:00:20.670> break<00:00:20.970> it<00:00:21.180> but<00:00:21.990> on<00:00:22.109> a

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
and how we cut in and break it but on a

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.720 
and how we cut in and break it but on a
smaller<00:00:22.410> piece<00:00:22.650> typically<00:00:23.279> just<00:00:23.490> to<00:00:23.580> make

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
smaller piece typically just to make

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.150 
smaller piece typically just to make
sure<00:00:23.760> that<00:00:24.060> I<00:00:24.150> have<00:00:24.330> it<00:00:24.359> square<00:00:24.949> I'll<00:00:25.949> take<00:00:26.130> a

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
sure that I have it square I'll take a

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.349 
sure that I have it square I'll take a
measurement<00:00:26.519> let's<00:00:26.849> say<00:00:27.000> I<00:00:27.029> want<00:00:27.180> to<00:00:27.240> make

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
measurement let's say I want to make

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.650 
measurement let's say I want to make
this<00:00:27.480> one<00:00:27.720> 16<00:00:28.680> inches<00:00:28.980> long

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:29.660 
this one 16 inches long

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.709 
this one 16 inches long
now<00:00:30.660> I<00:00:30.960> score<00:00:31.529> it<00:00:31.560> on<00:00:32.070> both<00:00:32.250> ends<00:00:32.600> just<00:00:33.600> a

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
now I score it on both ends just a

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.319 
now I score it on both ends just a
little<00:00:33.899> tick<00:00:34.460> so<00:00:35.460> I<00:00:35.520> can<00:00:35.670> see<00:00:35.850> my<00:00:36.000> mark<00:00:37.309> okay

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:38.329 
little tick so I can see my mark okay

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:42.110 
little tick so I can see my mark okay
after<00:00:39.329> I<00:00:39.540> got<00:00:39.660> my<00:00:39.809> mark<00:00:40.050> there<00:00:40.790> lay<00:00:41.790> down<00:00:41.969> my

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
after I got my mark there lay down my

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.700 
after I got my mark there lay down my
guide<00:00:42.329> and<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.629> reason<00:00:42.870> I<00:00:42.930> do<00:00:42.989> on<00:00:43.200> both<00:00:43.410> places

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
guide and the reason I do on both places

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.830 
guide and the reason I do on both places
because<00:00:44.129> a<00:00:44.160> lot<00:00:44.340> of<00:00:44.399> times<00:00:44.579> these<00:00:44.969> even<00:00:45.719> though

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
because a lot of times these even though

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:46.819 
because a lot of times these even though
they're<00:00:45.989> supposed<00:00:46.079> to<00:00:46.260> be<00:00:46.379> square<00:00:46.649> and<00:00:46.770> you

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
they're supposed to be square and you

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.319 
they're supposed to be square and you
can<00:00:46.950> adjust<00:00:47.039> them<00:00:47.399> if<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.730> guy<00:00:47.850> before<00:00:48.000> me

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
can adjust them if the guy before me

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.700 
can adjust them if the guy before me
stood<00:00:48.510> down<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.840> ground<00:00:49.050> too<00:00:49.230> hard<00:00:49.260> I'm<00:00:49.590> going

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
stood down the ground too hard I'm going

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.680 
stood down the ground too hard I'm going
to<00:00:49.770> not<00:00:49.890> get<00:00:50.039> out<00:00:50.129> of<00:00:50.219> square<00:00:50.489> so<00:00:50.760> I<00:00:51.000> like<00:00:51.570> this

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
to not get out of square so I like this

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.590 
to not get out of square so I like this
double-checking<00:00:52.199> with<00:00:52.289> a<00:00:52.410> measurement<00:00:53.600> then

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
double-checking with a measurement then

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.630 
double-checking with a measurement then
I<00:00:54.690> go<00:00:54.870> ahead<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.260> put<00:00:55.350> my<00:00:55.379> cutter<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:56.399> I<00:00:56.460> like

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
I go ahead and put my cutter and I like

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.720 
I go ahead and put my cutter and I like
the<00:00:56.760> oil<00:00:56.789> cutters<00:00:58.340> basically<00:00:59.340> cutter<00:00:59.520> it's

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
the oil cutters basically cutter it's

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.580 
the oil cutters basically cutter it's
got<00:01:00.030> a<00:01:00.059> reservoir<00:01:00.420> for<00:01:00.510> oil<00:01:00.780> be<00:01:00.930> put<00:01:01.140> in<00:01:01.260> it<00:01:01.410> so

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
got a reservoir for oil be put in it so

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.250 
got a reservoir for oil be put in it so
I<00:01:01.620> always<00:01:01.800> have<00:01:02.039> it<00:01:02.160> oil<00:01:02.430> in<00:01:02.609> it<00:01:02.899> that<00:01:03.899> lines<00:01:04.080> up

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
I always have it oil in it that lines up

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.750 
I always have it oil in it that lines up
pretty<00:01:04.409> well<00:01:04.680> so<00:01:05.010> I'm<00:01:05.309> going<00:01:05.430> to<00:01:05.489> go<00:01:05.549> ahead<00:01:05.610> and

pretty well so I'm going to go ahead and

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.620 
pretty well so I'm going to go ahead and
score<00:01:06.000> it<00:01:06.830> it's<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:07.920> nice<00:01:08.070> smooth<00:01:08.340> motion

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
score it it's a nice smooth motion

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.789 
score it it's a nice smooth motion
there's<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:09.689> couple<00:01:09.869> ways<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.200> snap<00:01:10.409> this<00:01:10.590> off

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
there's a couple ways to snap this off

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:11.780 
there's a couple ways to snap this off
I'm<00:01:11.010> going<00:01:11.100> to<00:01:11.159> do<00:01:11.340> it<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.490> way<00:01:11.520> I<00:01:11.610> would

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
I'm going to do it the way I would

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.190 
I'm going to do it the way I would
normally<00:01:11.909> do<00:01:12.270> it<00:01:12.390> on<00:01:12.540> this<00:01:12.659> piece<00:01:12.960> of<00:01:13.110> this

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
normally do it on this piece of this

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.760 
normally do it on this piece of this
size<00:01:13.470> I<00:01:13.830> use<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.760> base<00:01:14.939> of<00:01:15.150> my<00:01:15.270> cutter

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
size I use the base of my cutter

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.719 
size I use the base of my cutter
basically<00:01:16.770> it's<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:16.950> block<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:17.400> I'll<00:01:17.520> put<00:01:17.640> that

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
basically it's a block and I'll put that

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:18.740 
basically it's a block and I'll put that
underneath<00:01:17.970> right<00:01:18.240> in<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.420> middle<00:01:18.570> of<00:01:18.659> the

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
underneath right in the middle of the

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.960 
underneath right in the middle of the
score<00:01:19.049> where<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.500> score<00:01:19.740> is<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:20.759> apply

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
score where the score is and apply

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.010 
score where the score is and apply
pressure<00:01:21.180> to<00:01:21.420> both<00:01:21.540> sides

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
pressure to both sides

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.039 
pressure to both sides
this<00:01:22.799> snapping<00:01:23.390> see<00:01:24.390> I<00:01:24.450> got<00:01:24.600> a<00:01:24.630> nice<00:01:24.780> clean

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
this snapping see I got a nice clean

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.960 
this snapping see I got a nice clean
crisp<00:01:25.350> cut<00:01:25.680> I<00:01:25.890> cut<00:01:26.100> about<00:01:26.220> four<00:01:26.520> inches<00:01:26.759> off

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
crisp cut I cut about four inches off

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.330 
crisp cut I cut about four inches off

I'll show you with something a little
bit<00:01:33.270> smaller<00:01:34.189> I'm<00:01:35.189> just<00:01:35.400> going<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.579> cut<00:01:35.729> this

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
bit smaller I'm just going to cut this

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.520 
bit smaller I'm just going to cut this
off<00:01:36.000> about<00:01:36.240> 14<00:01:36.630> inches<00:01:36.659> so<00:01:37.049> now<00:01:37.170> when<00:01:37.320> they<00:01:37.380> cut

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
off about 14 inches so now when they cut

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.830 
off about 14 inches so now when they cut
a<00:01:37.560> couple<00:01:37.890> inches<00:01:38.009> off<00:01:38.310> go<00:01:39.270> ahead<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:39.570> score

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
a couple inches off go ahead and score

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.960 
a couple inches off go ahead and score
for<00:01:39.900> my<00:01:40.110> marks<00:01:43.310> sometimes<00:01:44.310> use<00:01:44.399> a<00:01:44.430> marker<00:01:44.850> but

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
for my marks sometimes use a marker but

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:52.670 
for my marks sometimes use a marker but
I<00:01:45.030> like<00:01:45.180> to<00:01:45.299> just<00:01:45.479> score<00:01:45.899> it<00:01:46.020> myself

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.590 

and<00:01:53.680> then<00:01:53.800> once<00:01:53.950> my<00:01:54.070> my<00:01:54.220> score<00:01:54.580> and<00:01:55.240> this<00:01:55.360> time

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
and then once my my score and this time

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.600 
and then once my my score and this time
instead<00:01:55.810> of<00:01:55.900> using<00:01:55.990> my<00:01:57.060> cutter<00:01:58.060> base<00:01:58.630> as<00:01:58.930> the

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
instead of using my cutter base as the

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.910 
instead of using my cutter base as the
point<00:02:00.610> to<00:02:00.729> snap<00:02:00.970> it<00:02:01.150> at<00:02:01.300> I'm<00:02:02.080> going<00:02:02.229> to<00:02:02.320> use<00:02:02.530> a

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
point to snap it at I'm going to use a

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.670 
point to snap it at I'm going to use a
pair<00:02:03.310> of<00:02:03.340> running<00:02:03.580> pliers<00:02:04.170> as<00:02:05.170> you<00:02:05.350> can<00:02:05.470> see

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 
pair of running pliers as you can see

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.710 
pair of running pliers as you can see
here<00:02:06.040> you<00:02:06.820> pick<00:02:07.000> these<00:02:07.119> up<00:02:07.180> from<00:02:07.450> various

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
here you pick these up from various

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.020 
here you pick these up from various
different<00:02:07.960> suppliers<00:02:08.369> and<00:02:09.369> you<00:02:09.520> see<00:02:09.729> the<00:02:09.820> line

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
different suppliers and you see the line

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.640 
different suppliers and you see the line
in<00:02:10.450> the<00:02:10.600> center<00:02:10.869> of<00:02:10.899> it<00:02:11.080> I<00:02:11.140> want<00:02:11.260> to<00:02:11.320> center

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
in the center of it I want to center

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.110 
in the center of it I want to center
that<00:02:11.680> up<00:02:11.920> with<00:02:12.040> where<00:02:12.190> my<00:02:12.220> cut<00:02:12.520> is<00:02:14.640> and<00:02:15.640> then

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
that up with where my cut is and then

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.880 
that up with where my cut is and then
this<00:02:16.239> squeeze<00:02:16.540> gently<00:02:16.900> and<00:02:17.260> that<00:02:17.470> will<00:02:17.650> snap

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
this squeeze gently and that will snap

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.229 
this squeeze gently and that will snap
the<00:02:18.190> glass<00:02:20.400> and<00:02:21.400> there<00:02:21.580> it's<00:02:21.700> not<00:02:21.850> a<00:02:21.910> couple

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 
the glass and there it's not a couple

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:23.940 
the glass and there it's not a couple
inches<00:02:22.360> off<00:02:22.660> so<00:02:23.260> that's<00:02:23.380> another<00:02:23.560> way<00:02:23.739> to<00:02:23.770> do

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
inches off so that's another way to do

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.250 
inches off so that's another way to do
it<00:02:24.300> I'm<00:02:25.300> going<00:02:25.420> to<00:02:25.570> show<00:02:25.660> you<00:02:25.690> one<00:02:25.870> other<00:02:26.020> way

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
it I'm going to show you one other way

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.170 
it I'm going to show you one other way
which<00:02:27.130> is<00:02:27.220> a<00:02:27.280> little<00:02:27.489> bit<00:02:27.580> trickier<00:02:30.060> I'll<00:02:31.060> just

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
which is a little bit trickier I'll just

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:47.020 
which is a little bit trickier I'll just
cut<00:02:31.360> an<00:02:31.480> inch<00:02:31.660> off<00:02:31.870> of<00:02:31.900> it<00:02:34.019> and<00:02:35.019> then<00:02:35.230> score<00:02:35.709> it

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.930 

make<00:02:47.570> my<00:02:47.720> mark<00:02:47.960> all<00:02:48.140> the<00:02:48.170> way<00:02:48.260> down<00:02:48.610> okay<00:02:49.610> and

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
make my mark all the way down okay and

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.400 
make my mark all the way down okay and
on<00:02:50.030> this<00:02:50.150> one<00:02:50.390> I'm<00:02:50.540> going<00:02:50.690> to<00:02:50.750> cut<00:02:50.900> an<00:02:51.020> inch<00:02:51.170> off

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
on this one I'm going to cut an inch off

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.830 
on this one I'm going to cut an inch off
and<00:02:52.160> on<00:02:52.760> quarter-inch<00:02:53.150> glass<00:02:53.360> that's<00:02:53.570> kind<00:02:53.780> of

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
and on quarter-inch glass that's kind of

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.570 
and on quarter-inch glass that's kind of
tough<00:02:54.050> it<00:02:54.290> makes<00:02:54.500> it<00:02:54.650> a<00:02:54.680> lot<00:02:55.010> harder<00:02:55.070> to<00:02:55.400> break

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
tough it makes it a lot harder to break

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:56.890 
tough it makes it a lot harder to break
off<00:02:55.790> clean<00:02:56.120> otherwise<00:02:56.450> you're<00:02:56.630> just<00:02:56.660> pulling

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
off clean otherwise you're just pulling

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.410 
off clean otherwise you're just pulling
chunks<00:02:57.350> of<00:02:57.470> glass<00:02:57.620> off<00:02:57.940> the<00:02:58.940> way<00:02:59.060> I<00:02:59.090> do<00:02:59.210> this

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
chunks of glass off the way I do this

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.540 
chunks of glass off the way I do this
typically<00:02:59.780> then<00:03:00.050> to<00:03:00.770> take<00:03:00.920> my<00:03:01.040> glass<00:03:01.250> cutter

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 
typically then to take my glass cutter

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:03.340 
typically then to take my glass cutter
and<00:03:01.790> with<00:03:01.970> the<00:03:02.090> ball<00:03:02.270> in<00:03:02.480> on<00:03:02.630> the<00:03:02.660> end<00:03:02.900> of<00:03:03.050> it<00:03:03.170> I

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
and with the ball in on the end of it I

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:07.650 
and with the ball in on the end of it I
just<00:03:04.010> tap<00:03:04.250> until<00:03:04.820> I<00:03:04.850> start<00:03:05.300> seeing<00:03:05.540> it<00:03:05.690> running

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
just tap until I start seeing it running

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.030 
just tap until I start seeing it running
you<00:03:08.660> can<00:03:08.810> see<00:03:08.960> I<00:03:08.990> just<00:03:09.050> started<00:03:09.530> to<00:03:09.620> get<00:03:09.710> a<00:03:09.770> run

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
you can see I just started to get a run

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.400 
you can see I just started to get a run
there<00:03:10.570> on<00:03:11.570> the<00:03:11.840> glass<00:03:12.050> there

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
there on the glass there

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.640 
there on the glass there
it's<00:03:13.040> run<00:03:13.280> down<00:03:13.430> about<00:03:13.640> two<00:03:13.850> inches<00:03:14.120> into<00:03:14.330> it

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
it's run down about two inches into it

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.780 
it's run down about two inches into it
and<00:03:15.650> what<00:03:15.800> I<00:03:15.860> can<00:03:16.010> do<00:03:16.130> is<00:03:16.250> take<00:03:16.430> my<00:03:16.550> plate

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
and what I can do is take my plate

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:23.980 
and what I can do is take my plate
pliers<00:03:20.260> and<00:03:21.260> apply<00:03:21.560> pressure<00:03:21.830> here<00:03:22.690> and<00:03:23.690> pull

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:23.990 
pliers and apply pressure here and pull

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:25.720 
pliers and apply pressure here and pull
that<00:03:24.140> off<00:03:24.350> you<00:03:24.680> get<00:03:24.800> a<00:03:24.830> nice<00:03:25.010> clean<00:03:25.190> break<00:03:25.430> you

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
that off you get a nice clean break you

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.270 
that off you get a nice clean break you
don't<00:03:26.540> get<00:03:26.630> it<00:03:26.750> started<00:03:27.230> like<00:03:27.410> that<00:03:27.680> on<00:03:27.890> a<00:03:28.130> nice

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
don't get it started like that on a nice

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.070 
don't get it started like that on a nice
clean<00:03:28.550> break<00:03:28.730> what'll<00:03:29.240> happen<00:03:29.390> is<00:03:29.540> a<00:03:29.660> jump<00:03:29.900> off

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
clean break what'll happen is a jump off

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.540 
clean break what'll happen is a jump off
and<00:03:30.260> I<00:03:30.320> have<00:03:30.410> to<00:03:30.500> chunk<00:03:30.740> it<00:03:30.830> all<00:03:30.950> off<00:03:31.220> and<00:03:31.490> I'll

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:31.550 
and I have to chunk it all off and I'll

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:33.010 
and I have to chunk it all off and I'll
have<00:03:31.700> to<00:03:31.820> spend<00:03:32.030> a<00:03:32.060> lot<00:03:32.270> of<00:03:32.300> time<00:03:32.570> cleaning<00:03:32.810> the

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:33.020 
have to spend a lot of time cleaning the

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.070 
have to spend a lot of time cleaning the
edge<00:03:33.140> up<00:03:33.410> or<00:03:34.040> just<00:03:34.310> recut<00:03:34.670> another<00:03:34.880> piece<00:03:35.150> this

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.080 
edge up or just recut another piece this

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:37.420 
edge up or just recut another piece this
takes<00:03:36.290> a<00:03:36.350> long<00:03:36.470> time<00:03:36.710> to<00:03:36.800> clean<00:03:36.980> it<00:03:37.100> up<00:03:37.190> so<00:03:37.310> it's

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
takes a long time to clean it up so it's

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:38.500 
takes a long time to clean it up so it's
easier<00:03:37.760> just<00:03:37.910> get<00:03:38.060> it<00:03:38.120> started<00:03:38.330> by<00:03:38.450> a<00:03:38.480> couple

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
easier just get it started by a couple

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:42.160 
easier just get it started by a couple
taps<00:03:38.960> and<00:03:39.280> get<00:03:40.280> that<00:03:40.430> going<00:03:40.960> then<00:03:41.960> if<00:03:42.080> they

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
taps and get that going then if they

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:43.390 
taps and get that going then if they
have<00:03:42.290> a<00:03:42.320> big<00:03:42.560> sheet<00:03:42.860> and<00:03:43.010> I'll<00:03:43.070> show<00:03:43.250> you<00:03:43.310> in

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
have a big sheet and I'll show you in

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.270 
have a big sheet and I'll show you in
another<00:03:43.430> video<00:03:43.760> but<00:03:44.150> just<00:03:44.330> an<00:03:44.420> example<00:03:44.750> just

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
another video but just an example just

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.430 
another video but just an example just
imagine<00:03:46.280> this<00:03:46.370> is<00:03:46.430> a<00:03:46.550> only<00:03:47.270> four<00:03:48.170> foot<00:03:48.320> by

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
imagine this is a only four foot by

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.110 
imagine this is a only four foot by
eight<00:03:48.530> foot<00:03:48.560> sheet<00:03:49.010> and<00:03:49.220> I'm<00:03:49.820> going<00:03:49.940> to<00:03:50.000> try

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
eight foot sheet and I'm going to try

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.580 
eight foot sheet and I'm going to try
and<00:03:50.240> cut<00:03:50.360> it<00:03:50.450> and<00:03:50.540> snap<00:03:50.690> it<00:03:50.840> myself<00:03:51.020> and<00:03:51.440> it's<00:03:51.560> a

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
and cut it and snap it myself and it's a

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:52.630 
and cut it and snap it myself and it's a
lot<00:03:51.740> of<00:03:51.860> weight<00:03:51.980> there<00:03:52.010> it's<00:03:52.250> kind<00:03:52.400> of<00:03:52.459> hard<00:03:52.610> to

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 
lot of weight there it's kind of hard to

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.340 
lot of weight there it's kind of hard to
do<00:03:52.820> but<00:03:53.120> I'll<00:03:53.630> show<00:03:53.840> you<00:03:53.870> what<00:03:54.050> I<00:03:54.080> would<00:03:54.260> do

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.350 
do but I'll show you what I would do

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:56.080 
do but I'll show you what I would do
then<00:03:54.590> it's<00:03:55.220> basically<00:03:55.550> the<00:03:55.670> same<00:03:55.790> type<00:03:56.060> of

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
then it's basically the same type of

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.870 
then it's basically the same type of
deal<00:03:57.010> I'm<00:03:58.010> just<00:03:58.160> going<00:03:58.280> to<00:03:58.340> cut<00:03:58.550> it<00:03:58.670> roughly

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.880 
deal I'm just going to cut it roughly

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.070 
deal I'm just going to cut it roughly
here<00:03:59.060> in<00:03:59.150> the<00:03:59.240> middle<00:03:59.450> without<00:03:59.510> measure<00:03:59.900> and

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.080 
here in the middle without measure and

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.580 
here in the middle without measure and
just<00:04:00.200> get<00:04:00.320> an<00:04:00.410> idea<00:04:00.500> you<00:04:02.140> would<00:04:03.140> score<00:04:03.410> it<00:04:03.500> all

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
just get an idea you would score it all

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:05.890 
just get an idea you would score it all
the<00:04:03.680> way<00:04:03.770> down<00:04:03.920> the<00:04:04.070> long<00:04:04.190> sheet<00:04:04.900> then

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
the way down the long sheet then

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.000 
the way down the long sheet then
ticularly<00:04:06.230> I'll<00:04:06.350> have<00:04:06.470> somebody<00:04:06.650> come<00:04:06.980> and

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
ticularly I'll have somebody come and

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:08.740 
ticularly I'll have somebody come and
help<00:04:07.130> me<00:04:07.430> I'll<00:04:07.520> pull<00:04:07.730> one<00:04:07.910> end<00:04:07.940> of<00:04:08.240> it<00:04:08.360> up<00:04:08.540> and

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
help me I'll pull one end of it up and

help me I'll pull one end of it up and
I'll<00:04:09.200> stick<00:04:09.470> a<00:04:09.680> big<00:04:12.370> stick<00:04:13.370> underneath<00:04:13.790> of<00:04:13.970> it

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
I'll stick a big stick underneath of it

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:15.490 
I'll stick a big stick underneath of it
it's<00:04:14.360> just<00:04:14.450> totally<00:04:14.959> straight<00:04:15.230> it's<00:04:15.380> not

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500 
it's just totally straight it's not

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.409 
it's just totally straight it's not
shaped<00:04:16.010> like<00:04:16.220> this<00:04:16.459> which<00:04:16.790> is<00:04:16.940> a<00:04:16.970> real<00:04:17.209> long

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:17.419 
shaped like this which is a real long

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:22.750 
shaped like this which is a real long
straight<00:04:19.419> straight<00:04:20.419> board<00:04:21.430> I'll<00:04:22.430> put<00:04:22.580> it<00:04:22.669> over

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:22.760 
straight straight board I'll put it over

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.450 
straight straight board I'll put it over
the<00:04:22.940> center<00:04:23.120> of<00:04:23.330> it<00:04:23.450> and<00:04:24.130> then<00:04:25.130> just<00:04:25.160> apply

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
the center of it and then just apply

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.250 
the center of it and then just apply
pressure<00:04:25.490> on<00:04:25.790> both<00:04:25.880> sides<00:04:26.150> and<00:04:26.750> that'll<00:04:27.050> snap

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260 
pressure on both sides and that'll snap

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:28.930 
pressure on both sides and that'll snap
it<00:04:27.440> in<00:04:27.530> two<00:04:27.710> but<00:04:28.370> I'll<00:04:28.460> show<00:04:28.610> you<00:04:28.669> that<00:04:28.790> in<00:04:28.910> a

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:35.990 
just straddle it put apply pressure and

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.290 
just straddle it put apply pressure and
snap<00:04:36.290> in<00:04:36.440> two<00:04:36.620> and<00:04:37.310> if<00:04:38.000> you<00:04:38.060> have<00:04:38.150> more
