00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.000
 Newton's Second Law of Motion. 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.000
 The Royal King invites you to join the Grand Science Festival. 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:17.300
 Newton's second law states that the rate of change of the object's momentum is directly proportional to the unbalanced force in the direction of force. 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.000
 Therefore, F is directly proportional to what. 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.500
 The force applied by Newton causes the rock to move slightly. 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.500
 Why not try to move the rock? 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.400
 The force applied by the horse causes the rock to move more distance. 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
 Newton applies less power, less acceleration is produced. 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 The horse applies more power, more acceleration is produced. 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
 Thus, the force is proportional to the acceleration. 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000
 The mass of Newton is lower, thus applying less force. 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:20.700
 The mass of the horse is more, thus applying more force. 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:37.000
 Therefore, the force is directly proportional to the mass. 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000
 The force is proportional to the mass. 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.800
 The force is proportional to the acceleration. 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:53.300
 Thus, the force is directly proportional to the mass and acceleration output. 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.300
 End.
