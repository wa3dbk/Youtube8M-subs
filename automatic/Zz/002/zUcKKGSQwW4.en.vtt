but<00:02:16.900> as<00:02:17.290> well<00:02:17.469> when<00:02:17.620> the<00:02:17.739> stood<00:02:17.950> that<00:02:18.129> it<00:02:18.400> takes

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
but as well when the stood that it takes

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.479 
but as well when the stood that it takes
time<00:02:19.329> to<00:02:19.749> achieve<00:02:19.870> that<00:02:20.260> position<00:02:20.799> so<00:02:21.040> we<00:02:21.310> will

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
time to achieve that position so we will

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:24.330 
time to achieve that position so we will
work<00:02:21.760> in<00:02:21.969> order<00:02:22.180> to<00:02:23.049> let's<00:02:23.469> say<00:02:23.650> to<00:02:23.709> give<00:02:24.129> him

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
work in order to let's say to give him

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.330 
work in order to let's say to give him
more<00:02:24.999> comfort<00:02:25.450> and<00:02:25.659> you<00:02:26.409> should<00:02:26.709> be<00:02:26.859> able<00:02:27.219> to

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
achieve that position quicker as soon as

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.589 
achieve that position quicker as soon as
become<00:02:29.139> the<00:02:29.260> bike<00:02:29.409> out<00:02:29.620> to<00:02:29.769> the<00:02:29.889> corner<00:02:30.599> the

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
perfect body position means chaz davies

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.729 
perfect body position means chaz davies
can<00:02:34.060> go<00:02:34.239> to<00:02:34.299> the<00:02:34.719> three<00:02:34.959> kilometers<00:02:35.500> an<00:02:35.650> hour
