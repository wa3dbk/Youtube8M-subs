00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.400
 Especially in gardening and landscaping four schnorrt cramped conditions can 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.890
 you can see it now in the new game year as 700th 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.229
 a problem solver for these missions 

00:00:10.229 --> 00:00:13.220
 Here you can see the Euro are as 700 

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:17.370
 it is the smaller device the smallest device from our new product line 

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:18.779
 the exhausting though 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.710
 how beautiful was exclusive Goller word huge or again device and that immediately 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:23.970
 was always device 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.109
 the satire is the entry-level 700 model 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:30.380
 but with the appropriate features you can see that too 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.810
 as swiveling they have already said and that with the 9 evening concept 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:36.020
 of the volume 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.850
 we want or you want to have more workspace 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.670
 between the front wheels and the slimmer evening is 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.730
 We have now slimmed down by 46 percent. Lagarde has been tested 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.670
 they have more workspace between the front wheels 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.910
 that is, there she lives the efficiency of which from strict 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:56.430
 on it from our product 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.820
 Uster Insight is a compensation Skinner Martínez 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.870
 We came first in the market 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.570
 Percent, we have corresponding advantages as this chart again quite slimmer 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.640
 that is the workspace then we have a whole class sets the Gematik 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.190
 the stage that means they can all be a cultivation located last year 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.140
 completely on the over the mountain is modeled on the tent stage with 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.640
 Sprinkling rice 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.830
 unnatural was parallel leadership features 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.870
 so now we have more highlights 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:32.410
 VAT the bus wanted to translate a short time for power assistance 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.360
 that is, the customer has always engaged optimal shovel 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.270
 because at that moment where the shovel is loaded I have one 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:41.880
 Support from the WHO 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.610
 and correspond there 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.330
 three times the pilot again for the customer 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.510
 that I have a fast turnaround performance, Vogt have time to stop what they do 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:51.510
 Naturally 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:52.780
 Money would be back 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.210
 Percent imagines 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.920
 the four distraction 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.550
 Four-wheel steering is extremely important for the tropics that knows everything and 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:04.080
 We are known as swiveling manufacturer Daimler for the extremely important on the 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.240
 stability 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.069
 At an EM wasting on taxes, we are more crooked 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.590
 while citing speaks more stability more tilts load than 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.449
 what does that mean for the customer? 

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:19.629
 that they are all important to the customer I can all attachments 180 degrees 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:24.080
 Full Petit area drive and all loads accordingly 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:26.659
 the data 

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:29.799
 Just commute and I have an unlikely good is that 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:33.609
 Feeling that means again we are back at the word stability 

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:35.739
 the word security too 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:40.290
 So our products in this performance class also said seven months 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.879
 Fields entry-level model 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:45.879
 a full well equipped cabin 

00:02:46.679 --> 00:02:51.799
 excellent entry wide large steps in and out that again 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:52.500
 oyster 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.539
 Analysis of the customer came 

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:58.219
 I have to get in and out of the building on the day 20:30 

00:02:58.219 --> 00:02:59.869
 and as I said the craft 

00:02:59.869 --> 00:03:02.909
 As I think we have already told our customers here at the show 

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:04.219
 at the GaLaBau 

00:03:04.219 --> 00:03:05.600
 very well done 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.600
 in course no match will be good comfort 

00:03:09.219 --> 00:03:11.339
 the desert controls 

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:15.699
 optionally optimally adjustable to the corresponding driver 

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:20.219
 the powertrain has been napping for a very long time we have Ramadan in 2007 

00:03:20.219 --> 00:03:23.539
 Production started to introduce a new door concept 

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:25.169
 that means we suck 

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:28.759
 At the top of the food and the cleanest spot will be 

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:31.799
 three times the cool air because we would have all the components 

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:35.769
 that also has the advantage that the customs 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:39.009
 Lüthi Rossi can be seen from the 8th 

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:43.809
 So Beck hits the height where we stand as 80 miners club with 8 at all 

00:03:43.809 --> 00:03:47.069
 are not there 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:49.240
 74 the b in the cabin 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.150
 and though 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.069
 clear 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:54.489
 and 90 DB outdoors 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:57.619
 two meters next to the cabin is just as normal as we are now 

00:03:59.539 --> 00:04:01.569
 from Weimar that the people continue 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:03.939
 we will comply 

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:05.799
 have installed bad 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:08.109
 the other Western European market 

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:11.109
 all in the long run 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.669
 around the clock Wiek 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:33.590
 The Levites reads Browse 24 points is great
