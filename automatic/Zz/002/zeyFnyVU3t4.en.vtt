can put the knife into a sheath will
quick<00:01:57.380> and<00:01:58.380> then<00:01:59.719> this<00:02:00.719> loop<00:02:01.079> has<00:02:01.770> way<00:02:02.009> too

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
quick and then this loop has way too

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.109 
quick and then this loop has way too
much<00:02:02.310> space<00:02:02.640> in<00:02:03.000> it<00:02:03.329> and<00:02:04.159> as<00:02:05.159> you<00:02:05.460> can<00:02:05.640> see<00:02:05.909> even

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
much space in it and as you can see even

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.730 
much space in it and as you can see even
with<00:02:06.270> that<00:02:06.479> loop<00:02:06.689> closed<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.259> knife<00:02:07.439> can

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
with that loop closed the knife can

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.499 
with that loop closed the knife can
still<00:02:08.069> come<00:02:08.280> out<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.580> sheath<00:02:08.789> so<00:02:09.090> that's<00:02:09.270> not

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
still come out the sheath so that's not

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.309 
still come out the sheath so that's not
good<00:02:09.979> also<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.280> back<00:02:11.580> of<00:02:11.790> it

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
good also the back of it

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:14.500 
good also the back of it
very<00:02:12.769> confusing<00:02:13.280> I<00:02:13.459> have<00:02:13.700> no<00:02:13.939> idea<00:02:14.269> how<00:02:14.450> to

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
very confusing I have no idea how to

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.149 
very confusing I have no idea how to
attach<00:02:14.840> this<00:02:15.049> to<00:02:15.230> gear<00:02:15.439> I<00:02:15.470> mean<00:02:15.739> it<00:02:15.830> has<00:02:15.950> these

00:02:16.149 --> 00:02:16.159 
attach this to gear I mean it has these

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:20.050 
attach this to gear I mean it has these
two<00:02:17.150> strings<00:02:17.540> and<00:02:18.019> this<00:02:18.560> whatever<00:02:19.519> at<00:02:19.730> the<00:02:19.819> top

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
two strings and this whatever at the top

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.259 
two strings and this whatever at the top

would highly recommend this knife as a

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:36.970 
would highly recommend this knife as a
combat<00:02:34.220> dagger<00:02:34.459> it<00:02:34.819> is<00:02:35.780> extremely<00:02:36.680> strong<00:02:36.920> and

combat dagger it is extremely strong and

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.039 
combat dagger it is extremely strong and
durable<00:02:37.190> but<00:02:37.909> what<00:02:38.480> I've<00:02:38.599> seen<00:02:38.720> a<00:02:38.780> lot<00:02:38.959> of

durable but what I've seen a lot of

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:41.020 
durable but what I've seen a lot of
people<00:02:39.260> do<00:02:39.470> to<00:02:39.680> account<00:02:40.370> for<00:02:40.459> the<00:02:40.760> sheet

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
and that seems to be the best option

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.240
