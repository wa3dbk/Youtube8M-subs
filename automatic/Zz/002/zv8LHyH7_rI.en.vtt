00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:04.440 

in<00:00:01.830> this<00:00:02.830> video<00:00:03.190> we're<00:00:03.610> going<00:00:03.820> to<00:00:04.090> explore

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:04.450 
in this video we're going to explore

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:06.749 
in this video we're going to explore
positive<00:00:05.200> and<00:00:05.379> negative<00:00:05.890> feedback<00:00:06.189> in<00:00:06.700> terms

00:00:06.749 --> 00:00:06.759 
positive and negative feedback in terms

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:10.620 
positive and negative feedback in terms
of<00:00:07.450> physiology<00:00:08.310> so<00:00:09.310> many<00:00:09.730> molecular<00:00:10.090> and

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:10.630 
of physiology so many molecular and

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:13.230 
of physiology so many molecular and
physiological<00:00:11.250> processes<00:00:12.250> are<00:00:12.580> controlled

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:13.240 
physiological processes are controlled

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.590 
physiological processes are controlled
by<00:00:13.630> feedback<00:00:14.260> mechanisms<00:00:15.119> there<00:00:16.119> are<00:00:16.299> two

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:16.600 
by feedback mechanisms there are two

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.720 
by feedback mechanisms there are two
types<00:00:16.960> of<00:00:17.230> feedback<00:00:17.440> mechanisms<00:00:18.280> that<00:00:18.580> we're

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:18.730 
types of feedback mechanisms that we're

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:20.790 
types of feedback mechanisms that we're
going<00:00:18.910> to<00:00:19.030> talk<00:00:19.180> about<00:00:19.210> the<00:00:20.050> first<00:00:20.470> is

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:20.800 
going to talk about the first is

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.490 
going to talk about the first is
positive<00:00:21.400> feedback<00:00:21.580> it's<00:00:22.180> when<00:00:22.870> the<00:00:23.020> rate<00:00:23.289> of

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:23.500 
positive feedback it's when the rate of

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.060 
positive feedback it's when the rate of
process<00:00:24.070> works<00:00:24.490> to<00:00:25.180> increase<00:00:25.450> the<00:00:25.900> product<00:00:26.320> we

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:27.070 
process works to increase the product we

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.000 
process works to increase the product we
can<00:00:27.280> think<00:00:27.520> of<00:00:27.699> this<00:00:27.880> as<00:00:28.180> a<00:00:28.720> domino<00:00:29.199> or<00:00:29.410> chain

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.010 
can think of this as a domino or chain

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:33.000 
can think of this as a domino or chain
effect<00:00:30.279> so<00:00:31.240> the<00:00:31.360> process<00:00:31.900> will<00:00:32.050> work<00:00:32.110> to

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.010 
effect so the process will work to

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.790 
effect so the process will work to
increase<00:00:33.609> one<00:00:33.879> product<00:00:34.390> which<00:00:35.170> will<00:00:35.319> then<00:00:35.559> go

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 
increase one product which will then go

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.849 
increase one product which will then go
ahead<00:00:35.920> and<00:00:36.399> stimulate<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:38.230> production<00:00:38.469> of

00:00:38.849 --> 00:00:38.859 
ahead and stimulate the production of

00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:42.809 
ahead and stimulate the production of
another<00:00:39.550> product<00:00:39.850> and<00:00:40.269> so<00:00:40.659> on<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:42.219> opposite

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:42.819 
another product and so on the opposite

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:46.139 
another product and so on the opposite
is<00:00:43.079> negative<00:00:44.079> feedback<00:00:44.289> or<00:00:45.249> when<00:00:45.550> the<00:00:45.699> rate<00:00:45.940> of

00:00:46.139 --> 00:00:46.149 
is negative feedback or when the rate of

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:49.559 
is negative feedback or when the rate of
process<00:00:46.719> has<00:00:46.960> to<00:00:47.199> be<00:00:47.379> controlled<00:00:48.059> to<00:00:49.059> prevent

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:49.569 
process has to be controlled to prevent

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:53.129 
process has to be controlled to prevent
the<00:00:49.780> accumulation<00:00:50.050> of<00:00:50.679> a<00:00:51.129> product<00:00:52.139> negative

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:53.139 
the accumulation of a product negative

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:56.309 
the accumulation of a product negative
feedback<00:00:53.589> works<00:00:53.949> to<00:00:54.339> decrease<00:00:54.789> a<00:00:54.819> product<00:00:55.389> so

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:56.319 
feedback works to decrease a product so

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:58.799 
feedback works to decrease a product so
that's<00:00:56.440> important<00:00:57.069> because<00:00:57.370> if<00:00:57.850> we<00:00:58.269> have<00:00:58.659> an

00:00:58.799 --> 00:00:58.809 
that's important because if we have an

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:01.349 
that's important because if we have an
accumulation<00:00:59.170> of<00:00:59.920> a<00:01:00.339> product<00:01:00.850> in<00:01:00.999> our<00:01:01.120> blood

00:01:01.349 --> 00:01:01.359 
accumulation of a product in our blood

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:04.200 
accumulation of a product in our blood
for<00:01:01.600> example<00:01:02.079> we<00:01:02.799> can't<00:01:03.069> have<00:01:03.370> it<00:01:03.519> build<00:01:03.760> up<00:01:03.940> to

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
for example we can't have it build up to

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:05.999 
for example we can't have it build up to
excessive<00:01:04.750> levels<00:01:05.140> that<00:01:05.379> can<00:01:05.560> be<00:01:05.619> really

00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:06.009 
excessive levels that can be really

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:06.539 
excessive levels that can be really
toxic

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:06.549 
toxic

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:10.499 
toxic
that's<00:01:07.479> why<00:01:07.829> feedback<00:01:08.829> mechanisms<00:01:09.640> are<00:01:09.939> put

00:01:10.499 --> 00:01:10.509 
that's why feedback mechanisms are put

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:14.100 
that's why feedback mechanisms are put
into<00:01:10.810> place<00:01:11.110> to<00:01:11.549> control<00:01:12.549> the<00:01:12.939> process<00:01:13.479> that's

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 
into place to control the process that's

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.039 
into place to control the process that's
increasing<00:01:14.860> the<00:01:14.979> product<00:01:15.430> so<00:01:16.420> it<00:01:16.630> will<00:01:16.810> work

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:17.049 
increasing the product so it will work

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:20.039 
increasing the product so it will work
to<00:01:17.409> inhibit<00:01:17.950> that<00:01:17.979> process<00:01:18.729> by<00:01:19.450> decreasing

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:20.049 
to inhibit that process by decreasing

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:23.840 
to inhibit that process by decreasing
the<00:01:20.259> product<00:01:21.689> let's<00:01:22.689> look<00:01:23.289> at<00:01:23.530> a

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
the product let's look at a

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.999 
the product let's look at a
physiological<00:01:24.850> process<00:01:25.420> that<00:01:26.079> uses<00:01:26.500> positive

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:27.009 
physiological process that uses positive

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:29.399 
physiological process that uses positive
and<00:01:27.579> negative<00:01:28.180> feedback<00:01:28.390> and<00:01:28.869> more

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409 
and negative feedback and more

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:32.940 
and negative feedback and more
specifically<00:01:30.100> occurs<00:01:30.789> in<00:01:30.969> females<00:01:31.500> so<00:01:32.500> the

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
specifically occurs in females so the

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.029 
specifically occurs in females so the
first<00:01:33.250> structure<00:01:33.820> here<00:01:34.240> in<00:01:34.390> blue<00:01:34.810> is<00:01:35.109> called

00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:36.039 
first structure here in blue is called

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:39.840 
first structure here in blue is called
the<00:01:36.429> hypothalamus<00:01:37.420> the<00:01:38.409> hypothalamus<00:01:39.280> as<00:01:39.579> you

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
the hypothalamus the hypothalamus as you

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.779 
the hypothalamus the hypothalamus as you
may<00:01:40.000> have<00:01:40.030> heard<00:01:40.179> in<00:01:40.719> your<00:01:40.899> studies<00:01:41.289> is<00:01:41.530> the

00:01:41.779 --> 00:01:41.789 
may have heard in your studies is the

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:44.910 
may have heard in your studies is the
master<00:01:42.789> control<00:01:43.000> gland<00:01:43.509> of<00:01:43.689> our<00:01:44.350> endocrine

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
master control gland of our endocrine

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.810 
master control gland of our endocrine
system<00:01:45.600> now<00:01:46.600> it's<00:01:46.810> signals<00:01:47.409> or<00:01:47.820> basically

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
system now it's signals or basically

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.810 
system now it's signals or basically
talks<00:01:49.359> to<00:01:49.749> this<00:01:50.439> next<00:01:50.770> gland<00:01:51.070> here<00:01:51.460> the

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:51.820 
talks to this next gland here the

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.469 
talks to this next gland here the
pituitary<00:01:52.270> gland<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:54.130> pituitary<00:01:54.520> gland<00:01:54.909> is

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 
pituitary gland the pituitary gland is

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:59.399 
pituitary gland the pituitary gland is
further<00:01:55.929> broken<00:01:56.229> down<00:01:56.530> into<00:01:56.909> two<00:01:57.909> lobes<00:01:58.409> the

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409 
further broken down into two lobes the

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:02.940 
further broken down into two lobes the
back<00:01:59.710> lobe<00:02:00.039> is<00:02:00.369> the<00:02:00.609> posterior<00:02:01.210> and<00:02:01.679> the<00:02:02.679> front

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
back lobe is the posterior and the front

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.429 
back lobe is the posterior and the front
lobe<00:02:03.159> that<00:02:03.429> we're<00:02:03.579> going<00:02:03.700> to<00:02:03.759> focus<00:02:04.030> on<00:02:04.390> is<00:02:04.659> the

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:05.439 
lobe that we're going to focus on is the

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:09.960 
lobe that we're going to focus on is the
anterior<00:02:05.920> pituitary<00:02:07.500> now<00:02:08.500> moving<00:02:08.890> down<00:02:09.040> we

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
anterior pituitary now moving down we

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.290 
anterior pituitary now moving down we
have<00:02:10.150> another<00:02:10.510> organ<00:02:11.050> called<00:02:11.620> the<00:02:11.800> ovary<00:02:12.300> so

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
have another organ called the ovary so

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.120 
have another organ called the ovary so
females

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
females

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.730 
females
have<00:02:14.250> two<00:02:14.580> ovaries<00:02:14.970> that<00:02:15.660> are<00:02:15.810> located<00:02:16.200> way

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
have two ovaries that are located way

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.410 
have two ovaries that are located way
further<00:02:17.130> down<00:02:17.250> in<00:02:17.730> the<00:02:17.850> body

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
further down in the body

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.230 
further down in the body
well<00:02:19.140> the<00:02:19.470> hypothalamus<00:02:20.340> and<00:02:20.640> the<00:02:20.730> pituitary

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
well the hypothalamus and the pituitary

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.160 
well the hypothalamus and the pituitary
gland<00:02:21.570> are<00:02:22.080> up<00:02:22.500> in<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:22.800> brain<00:02:23.450> now<00:02:24.450> I've<00:02:24.750> also

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
gland are up in the brain now I've also

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.220 
gland are up in the brain now I've also
color-coded<00:02:25.820> these<00:02:26.820> four<00:02:27.210> hormones<00:02:27.810> that

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
color-coded these four hormones that

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.560 
color-coded these four hormones that
we're<00:02:28.410> going<00:02:28.590> to<00:02:28.710> talk<00:02:28.950> about<00:02:29.000> so<00:02:30.000> that<00:02:30.180> way<00:02:30.360> we

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
we're going to talk about so that way we

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.360 
we're going to talk about so that way we
can<00:02:30.720> keep<00:02:30.900> them<00:02:31.140> straight<00:02:31.320> as<00:02:31.710> we<00:02:32.010> go<00:02:32.160> through

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
can keep them straight as we go through

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.230 
can keep them straight as we go through
the<00:02:32.460> process<00:02:32.940> the<00:02:33.930> first<00:02:34.290> is<00:02:34.560> estrogen<00:02:35.240> the

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
the process the first is estrogen the

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.740 
the process the first is estrogen the
second<00:02:36.720> is<00:02:36.930> GnRH<00:02:37.920> or<00:02:38.310> ganado<00:02:39.120> tropen

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
second is GnRH or ganado tropen

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.280 
second is GnRH or ganado tropen
releasing<00:02:40.380> hormone<00:02:40.790> the<00:02:41.790> third<00:02:42.120> is<00:02:42.420> LH<00:02:42.930> or

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
releasing hormone the third is LH or

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.220 
releasing hormone the third is LH or
luteinizing<00:02:44.130> hormone<00:02:44.490> and<00:02:44.790> the<00:02:45.630> last<00:02:45.870> is

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
luteinizing hormone and the last is

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:51.110 
luteinizing hormone and the last is
progesterone<00:02:48.110> so<00:02:49.110> let's<00:02:49.320> start<00:02:49.910> during<00:02:50.910> the

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
progesterone so let's start during the

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.320 
progesterone so let's start during the
menstrual<00:02:51.570> cycle<00:02:51.630> and<00:02:52.260> more<00:02:52.560> specifically

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
menstrual cycle and more specifically

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.990 
menstrual cycle and more specifically
before<00:02:54.330> ovulation<00:02:55.430> small<00:02:56.430> amounts<00:02:56.910> of

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
before ovulation small amounts of

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.670 
before ovulation small amounts of
estrogen<00:02:57.210> are<00:02:57.780> secreted<00:02:58.470> from<00:02:58.800> the<00:02:59.010> ovaries

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
estrogen are secreted from the ovaries

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.070 
estrogen are secreted from the ovaries
this<00:03:01.680> small<00:03:02.100> amount<00:03:02.430> of<00:03:02.580> estrogen<00:03:02.820> is<00:03:03.360> just

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
this small amount of estrogen is just

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.920 
this small amount of estrogen is just
enough<00:03:04.620> to<00:03:05.340> trigger<00:03:05.610> the<00:03:05.760> release<00:03:06.240> of<00:03:06.540> two

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
enough to trigger the release of two

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.490 
enough to trigger the release of two
other<00:03:07.110> hormones<00:03:07.910> so<00:03:08.910> it<00:03:09.330> stimulates<00:03:10.260> the

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
other hormones so it stimulates the

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.430 
other hormones so it stimulates the
release<00:03:10.620> of<00:03:11.070> GnRH<00:03:12.060> from<00:03:12.510> the<00:03:12.660> hypothalamus

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
release of GnRH from the hypothalamus

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.190 
release of GnRH from the hypothalamus
and<00:03:13.680> also<00:03:14.640> works<00:03:14.940> to<00:03:15.150> stimulate<00:03:15.480> the<00:03:16.020> release

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
and also works to stimulate the release

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.440 
and also works to stimulate the release
of<00:03:16.650> LH<00:03:17.220> from<00:03:17.820> the<00:03:17.970> anterior<00:03:18.480> pituitary<00:03:20.450> so

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
of LH from the anterior pituitary so

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.960 
of LH from the anterior pituitary so
this<00:03:21.660> is<00:03:21.870> an<00:03:21.990> example<00:03:22.350> of<00:03:22.680> positive<00:03:23.160> feedback

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
this is an example of positive feedback

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.450 
this is an example of positive feedback
because<00:03:24.540> the<00:03:24.900> process<00:03:25.440> that<00:03:25.650> stimulated

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:26.460 
because the process that stimulated

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:29.540 
because the process that stimulated
estrogen<00:03:27.150> also<00:03:28.110> stimulated<00:03:28.830> the<00:03:28.980> release<00:03:29.310> of

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
estrogen also stimulated the release of

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:34.490 
estrogen also stimulated the release of
GnRH<00:03:30.420> and<00:03:30.750> LH<00:03:31.190> so<00:03:32.190> GnRH<00:03:33.120> can<00:03:33.510> also<00:03:33.750> then<00:03:34.230> work

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
GnRH and LH so GnRH can also then work

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.280 
GnRH and LH so GnRH can also then work
on<00:03:34.770> the<00:03:35.070> anterior<00:03:35.520> pituitary<00:03:35.850> to<00:03:36.840> stimulate

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
on the anterior pituitary to stimulate

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.830 
on the anterior pituitary to stimulate
the<00:03:37.470> production<00:03:37.620> and<00:03:38.280> release<00:03:38.760> of<00:03:39.180> even<00:03:39.570> more

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
the production and release of even more

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.860 
the production and release of even more
LH<00:03:40.320> into<00:03:40.680> the<00:03:40.770> blood<00:03:41.040> so<00:03:41.820> here's<00:03:42.180> positive

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
LH into the blood so here's positive

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.280 
LH into the blood so here's positive
feedback<00:03:43.260> again<00:03:44.390> the<00:03:45.390> hypothalamus

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
feedback again the hypothalamus

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.290 
feedback again the hypothalamus
communicates<00:03:47.010> its<00:03:47.220> message<00:03:47.700> down<00:03:47.970> to<00:03:48.030> the

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:48.300 
communicates its message down to the

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:49.960 
communicates its message down to the
anterior<00:03:48.810> pituitary

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
anterior pituitary

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.990 
anterior pituitary
now<00:03:50.970> LH<00:03:51.540> can<00:03:51.900> also<00:03:52.110> go<00:03:52.440> ahead<00:03:52.470> and<00:03:53.000> stimulate

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
now LH can also go ahead and stimulate

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.110 
now LH can also go ahead and stimulate
the<00:03:54.180> release<00:03:54.510> of<00:03:54.750> even<00:03:55.260> more<00:03:55.500> estrogen<00:03:56.120> again

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
the release of even more estrogen again

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.590 
the release of even more estrogen again
positive<00:03:58.020> feedback<00:03:59.000> so<00:04:00.000> here<00:04:00.240> we<00:04:00.360> have<00:04:00.570> a

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
positive feedback so here we have a

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.650 
positive feedback so here we have a
cycle<00:04:01.430> estrogen<00:04:02.430> causes<00:04:02.910> the<00:04:03.060> release<00:04:03.360> of

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
cycle estrogen causes the release of

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.460 
cycle estrogen causes the release of
GnRH<00:04:04.350> which<00:04:05.100> causes<00:04:05.580> a<00:04:05.610> release<00:04:05.820> of<00:04:06.180> LH<00:04:06.780> which

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
GnRH which causes a release of LH which

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.710 
GnRH which causes a release of LH which
causes<00:04:07.980> the<00:04:08.130> release<00:04:08.280> of<00:04:08.700> even<00:04:09.060> more<00:04:09.240> estrogen

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
causes the release of even more estrogen

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.280 
causes the release of even more estrogen
and<00:04:10.200> the<00:04:10.800> cycle<00:04:11.220> continues<00:04:11.660> so<00:04:12.660> you<00:04:12.750> can<00:04:13.020> see

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
and the cycle continues so you can see

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.190 
and the cycle continues so you can see
that<00:04:13.530> chain<00:04:13.800> effect<00:04:14.070> we're<00:04:14.370> talking<00:04:14.730> about

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 
that chain effect we're talking about

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.099 
that chain effect we're talking about
so<00:04:16.200> estrogen<00:04:16.859> is<00:04:17.160> produced<00:04:17.840> let's<00:04:18.840> write<00:04:19.080> that

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
so estrogen is produced let's write that

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:24.170 
so estrogen is produced let's write that
over<00:04:19.260> here<00:04:20.209> which<00:04:21.209> triggers<00:04:21.690> GnRH<00:04:22.470> and<00:04:23.180> that

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
over here which triggers GnRH and that

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.929 
over here which triggers GnRH and that
works<00:04:24.450> to<00:04:24.720> trigger<00:04:24.990> a

00:04:25.929 --> 00:04:25.939 
works to trigger a

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:30.070 
works to trigger a
now<00:04:26.930> GnRH<00:04:27.740> and<00:04:28.099> LH<00:04:28.490> are<00:04:28.849> going<00:04:29.449> to<00:04:29.659> be

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
now GnRH and LH are going to be

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.320 
now GnRH and LH are going to be
accumulating<00:04:30.889> in<00:04:31.039> our<00:04:31.159> blood<00:04:31.490> due<00:04:32.210> to

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
accumulating in our blood due to

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.830 
accumulating in our blood due to
positive<00:04:32.900> feedback<00:04:33.819> so<00:04:34.819> when<00:04:35.000> high<00:04:35.300> amounts

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 
positive feedback so when high amounts

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.619 
positive feedback so when high amounts
of<00:04:35.990> LH<00:04:36.409> are<00:04:36.650> produced<00:04:37.039> in<00:04:37.189> the<00:04:37.340> blood<00:04:37.639> another

00:04:38.619 --> 00:04:38.629 
of LH are produced in the blood another

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:42.939 
of LH are produced in the blood another
hormone<00:04:39.099> will<00:04:40.099> wake<00:04:40.610> up<00:04:40.909> so<00:04:41.509> to<00:04:41.569> say<00:04:41.870> and<00:04:42.139> that

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:42.949 
hormone will wake up so to say and that

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:45.550 
hormone will wake up so to say and that
hormone<00:04:43.219> is<00:04:43.370> called<00:04:43.699> progesterone<00:04:44.560> so

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
hormone is called progesterone so

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.909 
hormone is called progesterone so
progesterone<00:04:46.189> is<00:04:46.430> triggered<00:04:46.879> when<00:04:47.360> it<00:04:47.539> senses

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:47.919 
progesterone is triggered when it senses

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:51.490 
progesterone is triggered when it senses
that<00:04:48.919> these<00:04:49.189> LH<00:04:49.610> levels<00:04:49.639> are<00:04:50.330> too<00:04:50.360> high<00:04:50.750> and

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
that these LH levels are too high and

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.119 
that these LH levels are too high and
it's<00:04:52.280> secreted<00:04:52.669> from<00:04:53.060> the<00:04:53.210> corpus<00:04:53.629> luteum

00:04:54.119 --> 00:04:54.129 
it's secreted from the corpus luteum

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:56.279 
it's secreted from the corpus luteum
after<00:04:55.129> ovulation

00:04:56.279 --> 00:04:56.289 
after ovulation

00:04:56.289 --> 00:04:59.860 
after ovulation
so<00:04:57.289> after<00:04:57.800> ovulation<00:04:57.969> the<00:04:58.969> progesterone<00:04:59.419> will

00:04:59.860 --> 00:04:59.870 
so after ovulation the progesterone will

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:02.860 
so after ovulation the progesterone will
trigger<00:05:00.139> the<00:05:00.919> gnrh<00:05:01.699> production<00:05:02.419> in<00:05:02.599> the

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:02.870 
trigger the gnrh production in the

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.950 
trigger the gnrh production in the
hypothalamus<00:05:03.199> to<00:05:03.949> turn<00:05:04.189> off<00:05:04.430> and<00:05:04.939> then<00:05:05.719> that

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:05.960 
hypothalamus to turn off and then that

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.140 
hypothalamus to turn off and then that
will<00:05:06.199> also<00:05:06.229> trigger<00:05:06.800> Elish<00:05:07.340> production<00:05:07.969> in

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.150 
will also trigger Elish production in

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.459 
will also trigger Elish production in
the<00:05:08.689> anterior<00:05:09.110> pituitary<00:05:09.529> to<00:05:10.520> also<00:05:10.819> turn<00:05:11.029> off

00:05:11.459 --> 00:05:11.469 
the anterior pituitary to also turn off

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:14.920 
the anterior pituitary to also turn off
so<00:05:12.469> can<00:05:13.460> you<00:05:13.610> guess<00:05:13.819> what<00:05:14.090> this<00:05:14.270> is<00:05:14.479> called

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:14.930 
so can you guess what this is called

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:18.040 
so can you guess what this is called
if<00:05:15.400> you<00:05:16.400> said<00:05:16.699> negative<00:05:17.150> feedback<00:05:17.539> then<00:05:17.870> you

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.050 
if you said negative feedback then you

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:21.189 
if you said negative feedback then you
are<00:05:18.199> correct<00:05:18.939> since<00:05:19.939> the<00:05:20.090> levels<00:05:20.509> of<00:05:20.719> product

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:21.199 
are correct since the levels of product

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:23.219 
are correct since the levels of product
are<00:05:21.379> becoming<00:05:21.830> too<00:05:22.219> high<00:05:22.490> in<00:05:22.669> the<00:05:22.789> blood

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:23.229 
are becoming too high in the blood

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:26.290 
are becoming too high in the blood
something<00:05:24.229> needs<00:05:24.469> to<00:05:24.710> cause<00:05:25.009> an<00:05:25.430> inhibition

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:26.300 
something needs to cause an inhibition

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.869 
something needs to cause an inhibition
of<00:05:26.479> those<00:05:27.080> products<00:05:27.590> that<00:05:28.310> way<00:05:28.550> they<00:05:28.759> don't

00:05:28.869 --> 00:05:28.879 
of those products that way they don't

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:32.769 
of those products that way they don't
accumulate<00:05:29.449> in<00:05:29.990> the<00:05:30.800> blood<00:05:31.539> that's<00:05:32.539> why

00:05:32.769 --> 00:05:32.779 
accumulate in the blood that's why

00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:35.829 
accumulate in the blood that's why
progesterone<00:05:33.409> comes<00:05:33.889> in<00:05:34.159> and<00:05:34.430> turns<00:05:35.150> off<00:05:35.539> that

00:05:35.829 --> 00:05:35.839 
progesterone comes in and turns off that

00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:39.159 
progesterone comes in and turns off that
positive<00:05:36.440> feedback<00:05:36.680> process<00:05:37.580> and<00:05:38.169> decreases

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:39.169 
positive feedback process and decreases

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:41.950 
positive feedback process and decreases
the<00:05:39.349> products<00:05:40.120> that's<00:05:41.120> where<00:05:41.479> we<00:05:41.599> have<00:05:41.810> an

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:41.960 
the products that's where we have an

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.920 
the products that's where we have an
example<00:05:42.289> of<00:05:42.529> negative<00:05:43.009> feedback<00:05:43.279> in<00:05:43.930> this

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:44.930 
example of negative feedback in this

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:48.550 
example of negative feedback in this
specific<00:05:45.560> physiological<00:05:46.180> mechanism<00:05:47.560> going

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:48.560 
specific physiological mechanism going

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:53.230 
specific physiological mechanism going
back<00:05:49.180> we<00:05:50.180> can<00:05:50.389> see<00:05:50.659> that<00:05:50.900> the<00:05:51.169> LH<00:05:51.969> caused<00:05:52.969> the

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:53.240 
back we can see that the LH caused the

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.769 
back we can see that the LH caused the
production<00:05:54.669> of<00:05:55.669> progesterone<00:05:56.240> or<00:05:56.689> the

00:05:56.769 --> 00:05:56.779 
production of progesterone or the

00:05:56.779 --> 00:05:58.869 
production of progesterone or the
secretion<00:05:57.409> of<00:05:57.500> progesterone<00:05:58.099> in<00:05:58.400> the<00:05:58.610> first

00:05:58.869 --> 00:05:58.879 
secretion of progesterone in the first

00:05:58.879 --> 00:06:02.439 
secretion of progesterone in the first
place<00:05:59.120> and<00:05:59.419> then<00:06:00.349> progesterone<00:06:01.039> is<00:06:01.490> going<00:06:02.300> to

00:06:02.439 --> 00:06:02.449 
place and then progesterone is going to

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:05.200 
place and then progesterone is going to
go<00:06:02.539> back<00:06:02.810> and<00:06:03.139> work<00:06:03.409> on<00:06:03.699> inhibiting<00:06:04.699> further

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:05.210 
go back and work on inhibiting further

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:09.700 
go back and work on inhibiting further
GnRH<00:06:06.080> and<00:06:06.409> LH<00:06:06.949> release<00:06:07.400> as<00:06:08.199> you<00:06:09.199> can<00:06:09.379> see<00:06:09.589> in

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:09.710 
GnRH and LH release as you can see in

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:12.309 
GnRH and LH release as you can see in
this<00:06:09.830> little<00:06:09.889> cycle<00:06:10.599> so<00:06:11.599> that's<00:06:11.930> how<00:06:12.259> we

00:06:12.309 --> 00:06:12.319 
this little cycle so that's how we

00:06:12.319 --> 00:06:15.670 
this little cycle so that's how we
maintain<00:06:12.710> homeostasis<00:06:13.339> or<00:06:14.300> balance<00:06:14.560> in<00:06:15.560> our

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:15.680 
maintain homeostasis or balance in our

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.369 
maintain homeostasis or balance in our
body<00:06:15.949> which<00:06:16.819> is<00:06:17.060> really<00:06:17.569> important<00:06:18.139> for

00:06:18.369 --> 00:06:18.379 
body which is really important for

00:06:18.379 --> 00:06:20.579 
body which is really important for
maintaining<00:06:18.740> molecular<00:06:19.460> and<00:06:19.729> physiological

00:06:20.579 --> 00:06:20.589 
maintaining molecular and physiological

00:06:20.589 --> 00:06:24.040 
maintaining molecular and physiological
processes<00:06:21.819> that<00:06:22.819> way<00:06:23.089> nothing<00:06:23.569> in<00:06:23.689> our<00:06:23.810> body

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:24.050 
processes that way nothing in our body

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:27.339 
processes that way nothing in our body
becomes<00:06:24.620> too<00:06:24.979> out<00:06:25.219> of<00:06:25.370> balance<00:06:25.759> too<00:06:26.629> high<00:06:26.900> or

00:06:27.339 --> 00:06:27.349 
becomes too out of balance too high or

00:06:27.349 --> 00:06:30.149 
becomes too out of balance too high or
too<00:06:27.379> low<00:06:28.000> that's<00:06:29.000> the<00:06:29.330> beauty<00:06:29.659> of

00:06:30.149 --> 00:06:30.159 
too low that's the beauty of
