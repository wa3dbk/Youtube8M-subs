setup<00:00:48.030> first<00:00:48.539> this<00:00:49.379> game<00:00:49.620> playing<00:00:49.890> in<00:00:50.399> the

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
setup first this game playing in the

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.569 
setup first this game playing in the
background<00:00:50.820> is<00:00:51.210> this<00:00:51.480> weapon<00:00:52.020> I<00:00:52.199> do<00:00:52.379> go<00:00:52.739> 19<00:00:53.340> in

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
background is this weapon I do go 19 in

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.760 
background is this weapon I do go 19 in
isn't<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.390> best<00:00:54.660> game<00:00:54.930> player<00:00:55.199> bullet<00:00:55.500> it's<00:00:55.649> a

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
isn't the best game player bullet it's a

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.470 
isn't the best game player bullet it's a
pretty<00:00:55.980> decent<00:00:56.489> one<00:00:56.520> showing<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.090> best<00:00:57.329> of

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
pretty decent one showing the best of

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.360 
pretty decent one showing the best of
the<00:00:57.600> ability<00:00:57.989> of<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.530> honey<00:00:58.739> buddy<00:00:59.010> assault

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
the ability of the honey buddy assault

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.860 
the ability of the honey buddy assault
rifle<00:00:59.699> so<00:00:59.820> let's<00:01:00.059> get<00:01:00.149> straight<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.449> it

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
rifle so let's get straight to it

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.500 
rifle so let's get straight to it
so<00:01:01.379> basically<00:01:01.649> I<00:01:01.800> use<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.340> honey<00:01:03.059> budget

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
so basically I use the honey budget

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.320 
so basically I use the honey budget
assault<00:01:03.899> rifle<00:01:04.350> it<00:01:05.159> has<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:05.309> built<00:01:05.640> on<00:01:05.790> silence

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
assault rifle it has a built on silence

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.240 
assault rifle it has a built on silence
as<00:01:06.510> you<00:01:06.780> honor<00:01:06.990> so<00:01:07.409> you<00:01:07.470> basically<00:01:07.740> are

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
as you honor so you basically are

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.210 
as you honor so you basically are
getting<00:01:08.520> three<00:01:09.270> attachments<00:01:10.140> one<00:01:10.920> with<00:01:11.100> it

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
getting three attachments one with it

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.469 
getting three attachments one with it
being<00:01:11.520> a<00:01:11.640> bill<00:01:11.820> on<00:01:12.060> silencer<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:12.990> two<00:01:13.350> for<00:01:13.860> the

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
being a bill on silencer and two for the

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:16.580 
being a bill on silencer and two for the
attachments<00:01:15.479> you<00:01:15.570> get<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:15.930> put<00:01:16.080> on<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.409> gun

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
attachments you get to put on the gun

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.160 
attachments you get to put on the gun
but<00:01:17.460> this<00:01:17.640> gun<00:01:17.880> is<00:01:18.000> pretty<00:01:18.299> good<00:01:18.509> I<00:01:18.659> do<00:01:18.810> use

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
but this gun is pretty good I do use

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.100 
but this gun is pretty good I do use
this<00:01:19.320> gun<00:01:19.530> as<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.770> SMG<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:20.880> very<00:01:21.240> close<00:01:21.540> range<00:01:21.810> gun

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
this gun as a SMG a very close range gun

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.890 
this gun as a SMG a very close range gun
as<00:01:22.380> close<00:01:23.280> range<00:01:23.580> this<00:01:23.820> gun<00:01:24.090> destroys<00:01:24.659> at

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
as close range this gun destroys at

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.660 
as close range this gun destroys at
medium<00:01:25.200> range<00:01:25.409> it's<00:01:25.650> pretty<00:01:25.860> decent<00:01:26.040> but<00:01:26.400> long

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
medium range it's pretty decent but long

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.090 
medium range it's pretty decent but long
range<00:01:26.939> it's<00:01:27.270> got<00:01:27.540> a<00:01:27.570> bit<00:01:27.780> of<00:01:27.869> problem<00:01:28.380> but

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
range it's got a bit of problem but

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.670 
range it's got a bit of problem but
let's<00:01:29.579> get<00:01:29.909> on<00:01:29.970> to<00:01:30.090> that<00:01:30.570> in<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:30.869> minute<00:01:31.020> so

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
let's get on to that in a minute so

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.830 
let's get on to that in a minute so
basically<00:01:31.920> I<00:01:32.070> use<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.610> foregrip<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:33.509> the

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
basically I use the foregrip and the

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.929 
basically I use the foregrip and the
extended<00:01:34.290> max<00:01:34.530> so<00:01:34.860> I<00:01:34.890> use<00:01:35.130> for<00:01:35.430> group<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.759> stop

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
extended max so I use for group to stop

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.060 
extended max so I use for group to stop
the<00:01:36.060> recoil<00:01:36.450> as<00:01:36.659> this<00:01:36.810> gun<00:01:37.049> has<00:01:37.290> not<00:01:37.560> got

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
the recoil as this gun has not got

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.399 
the recoil as this gun has not got
normal<00:01:38.520> recoil<00:01:38.909> it<00:01:39.180> recoils<00:01:39.750> in<00:01:40.020> every

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
normal recoil it recoils in every

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.289 
normal recoil it recoils in every
direction<00:01:40.650> that<00:01:41.220> means<00:01:41.400> it<00:01:41.670> rate<00:01:41.850> cars<00:01:42.060> up

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
direction that means it rate cars up

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.330 
direction that means it rate cars up
down<00:01:42.570> and<00:01:42.930> left<00:01:43.229> them<00:01:43.380> right<00:01:43.590> it's<00:01:43.890> just<00:01:43.950> a<00:01:44.159> bit

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
down and left them right it's just a bit

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.990 
down and left them right it's just a bit
crazy<00:01:44.850> so<00:01:45.360> if<00:01:45.450> you<00:01:45.570> use<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:46.670> foregrip<00:01:47.670> you're

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
crazy so if you use the foregrip you're

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.270 
crazy so if you use the foregrip you're
gonna<00:01:48.149> reduce<00:01:48.570> that<00:01:48.780> recoil<00:01:49.140> by<00:01:49.500> quite<00:01:49.710> a<00:01:49.740> bit

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
gonna reduce that recoil by quite a bit

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.670 
gonna reduce that recoil by quite a bit
also<00:01:51.149> I<00:01:51.180> use<00:01:51.420> extended<00:01:51.930> mags<00:01:52.140> just<00:01:52.439> because

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
also I use extended mags just because

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.000

I just get my maniac pretty much

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.710 
I just get my maniac pretty much
straight<00:04:06.280> after<00:04:06.760> just<00:04:07.000> because<00:04:07.269> the<00:04:07.420> Trinity

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
straight after just because the Trinity

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.300 
straight after just because the Trinity
rocket<00:04:07.989> normally<00:04:08.320> gets<00:04:08.470> me<00:04:08.590> about<00:04:08.769> two<00:04:08.950> kills

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
rocket normally gets me about two kills

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.030 
rocket normally gets me about two kills
so<00:04:09.760> it<00:04:09.850> does<00:04:10.000> help<00:04:10.209> a<00:04:10.510> lot<00:04:10.810> but<00:04:11.290> maniac<00:04:11.680> is<00:04:11.859> just

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
so it does help a lot but maniac is just

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.770 
so it does help a lot but maniac is just
a<00:04:12.160> such<00:04:12.489> a<00:04:12.519> fun<00:04:12.820> kill<00:04:13.030> streak<00:04:13.299> I<00:04:13.450> would

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780

recommend<00:04:14.230> that<00:04:14.320> if<00:04:14.560> you<00:04:14.980> can't<00:04:15.190> get<00:04:15.340> a<00:04:15.370> maniac

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:15.850 
recommend that if you can't get a maniac

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:17.430 
recommend that if you can't get a maniac
I'd<00:04:16.060> go<00:04:16.209> with<00:04:16.239> battle<00:04:16.660> hand<00:04:16.870> but<00:04:17.169> you<00:04:17.260> should

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.080

be<00:04:17.560> able<00:04:17.650> to<00:04:17.739> get<00:04:17.859> a<00:04:17.890> maniac<00:04:18.400> if<00:04:18.579> you<00:04:18.700> can<00:04:18.850> get<00:04:19.060> a
