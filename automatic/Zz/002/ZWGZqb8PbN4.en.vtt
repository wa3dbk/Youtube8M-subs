00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:09.870
 in 2003 after a long search 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:14.340
 so that it could be interesting 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:17.030
 make an idea you were born now to all of you 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.030
 famous project 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:24.420
 idea 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.710
 we didnâ€™t try as if here 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.390
 some sense on the one hand 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.300
 invent a completely bicycle with another 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.770
 the parties of course wanted for what their new 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.660
 the first is what usually happened and he 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:38.400
 other projects we have become 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.989
 analyze why some projects in 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.200
 that foreign turned out to be especially 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:46.710
 successful which conversely failing in 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:51.949
 than before the phenomenon of a number of Russian projects 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:55.110
 what is the phenomenon on literary images and 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:58.530
 still there is that we most quickly 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:01.140
 Well, so interesting and that you could 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.440
 maximum believe found no such 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.960
 a formula that I would say simple 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.290
 can be called modern winnie the pooh 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:13.049
 when we started the project 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.830
 principle in Russia but without a stake was 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.840
 full vacuum 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.280
 that on the one hand was of course very 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.240
 good and wonderful because 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.549
 actually 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.810
 where I care that we are there with the Russian 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.990
 project and some might 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.640
 we compete unequivocally 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.189
 about this sense were pioneers on the other 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:33.380
 there was no party to rely on anyone 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:34.979
 there were people and a structure was created and 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.710
 we had to 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:43.770
 and still falls farther than 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:49.049
 to do when every year we launch 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:51.090
 next directions in fact 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.130
 sometimes we create those directions from scratch 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.840
 which Russia was not present before 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.829
 for example, during this time 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.659
 now it's all called a group 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.820
 companies of the river rolled into a group 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.700
 because the company total 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.660
 it has now become more than 20 besides 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:11.820
 animation studio and in addition to actually 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.600
 the stools engaged in the development of the game yes 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:17.790
 and the appearance 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:19.620
 during this time we had to create two 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:24.950
 publishing house 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:26.780
 development of print media projects 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.019
 separately publishing new copper which 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:32.690
 began to develop a project on the Internet 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:35.480
 a separate company began to deal with how 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.650
 about speech company brand management 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.660
 road media 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:42.530
 becoming such a key license 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:46.040
 agency and create your own studio 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.000
 industrial design your project 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:52.450
 agency option 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:54.110
 advertising agency to fly and up to 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.209
 small factories 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.750
 on making theater props because 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:01.910
 what we faced the task of producing 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:05.329
 dolls for theatrical shows necessary 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:07.040
 qualities you hay that again nowhere in 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:09.410
 Russian mother can not place an order 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.060
 that everything went to his knees and that level 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.970
 which was needed could order 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.860
 only very near in germany we 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.720
 launched 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.790
 another direction which is also in 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.269
 Russia as not mastered is called the river 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.910
 fashion 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:23.920
 This is the direction of licensing 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:27.590
 fashion 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:30.709
 when animated characters already 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:36.950
 does not develop as a children's nursery 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:41.239
 franchise as a project just for young 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:45.799
 girls and the growth of people she is with 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:47.090
 using payment images here 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:49.880
 accordingly creating thus 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:54.230
 there company for company project for 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:55.790
 project can say that there if I 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:57.260
 there was a project there would be these companies 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:01.010
 another country would be these companies 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:02.239
 the project would not have developed into that big 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.299
 industrial project which we are now 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:07.760
 it is clear that modern as 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:11.150
 only we ran most projects 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.650
 decisions here were made at the level 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.530
 rather some kind of hiding behind someone's instincts and 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.120
 even sometimes especially once more 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.579
 contributes resources it has always been 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:22.789
 some kind of risk which is far from 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:24.590
 always making excuses for the result we 

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:29.360
 have created a structure that is now now 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:30.289
 is able to serve only ours 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.830
 the company 

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:35.790
 the first brand that started it all 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:38.700
 if we talk about today's situation 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:40.700
 then we work with almost all 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:44.400
 key Russian brands 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:47.670
 ensuring their development progress beyond 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:50.310
 ether we are testing several new 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:53.220
 projects now which is at the stage 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:55.230
 active development and this year we 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:59.190
 signed here sim recently a contract with 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:05:03.900

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:09.030
 viacom 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:13.070
 which includes such famous structures 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:16.140
 how to dry box from aun te vi 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:18.890
 Nickelodeon less known in Russia on 

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:21.720
 worldwide known comedy central 

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:23.960
 this is one of the largest media companies 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:30.750
 on a par with disney and warner brothers 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:32.910
 this stormy and this company has signed with

 in Russia and CIS countries 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:51.840
 in fact, that's turned now 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:54.240
 a company that not only creates 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:06:00.500
 manages the media brands itself but also 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:06:04.130
 actively develops accompanying projects 

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:09.510
 foreign and just that 

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:12.330
 This company is exactly after a long 

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:13.860
 analyzing more than two years of it 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:16.980
 decided to stop the election on us and 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:18.980
 refused to communicate plans attempts 

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:21.210
 creating something here yourself 

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:23.820
 I understand that including us she 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:27.740
 will be able to compete hard speaks in 

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:31.140
 general about what national companies 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:33.000
 create it here may well succeed and 

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:35.610
 compete effectively in volume through 

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:39.330
 global at least in the local market for 

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:44.180
 so that after it is already on equal video 

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:44.180
 negotiate with them to move on
