00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.370
 talk about some facts about a video game 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.019
 that marked the world and revolutionized 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:44.739
 console generation 

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:47.559
 this game is the first playstation 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:50.980
 playstation was originally 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:54.250
 developed to be a peripheral of the 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:57.879
 super nintendo will play cd roms penning 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:00.850
 similar to the sega cd released by 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:05.049
 mow at the beginning would get a playstation 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:06.760
 ex and then switched to playstation 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:08.970
 however due to problems of 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:13.360
 licensing between sony and nintendo 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:16.630
 prevented should be released later to sony 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.790
 Tried it 's a partnership with the sega but 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.890
 it was not successful either 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.260
 not wanting to throw away all 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.710
 hard work on playstation to sony 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:28.630
 continuously develop it on their own 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.140
 and this decision completely changed the 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:34.570
 videogames world 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:37.539

 official session but it works 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.970
 perfectly connected to a port
