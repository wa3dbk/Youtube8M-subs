00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
strangely enough we do on a regular

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.430 
strangely enough we do on a regular

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
picking apart scats we have also

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.420 
picking apart scats we have also
something<00:02:27.940> that's<00:02:28.180> very<00:02:28.240> important<00:02:29.430> when

something that's very important when

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.340 
something that's very important when
we're<00:02:30.670> looking<00:02:31.000> at<00:02:31.120> animal<00:02:31.570> tracks<00:02:31.930> we're

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
we're looking at animal tracks we're

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.140 
we're looking at animal tracks we're
looking<00:02:32.740> at<00:02:32.860> not<00:02:33.220> just<00:02:33.280> tracks<00:02:33.790> but<00:02:33.970> we're

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
looking at not just tracks but we're

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:35.850 
looking at not just tracks but we're
looking<00:02:34.480> at<00:02:34.600> animals<00:02:35.020> sign<00:02:35.320> and<00:02:35.590> one<00:02:35.710> of<00:02:35.800> the

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
looking at animals sign and one of the

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.030 
looking at animals sign and one of the
things<00:02:35.920> we<00:02:36.310> most<00:02:36.580> commonly<00:02:36.670> look<00:02:37.300> at<00:02:37.510> is

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
things we most commonly look at is

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.580 
things we most commonly look at is
animal<00:02:39.040> scat<00:02:39.340> and<00:02:39.610> these<00:02:40.060> calipers<00:02:40.600> are<00:02:41.020> used

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
animal scat and these calipers are used

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.980 
animal scat and these calipers are used
to<00:02:42.100> determine<00:02:42.490> the<00:02:42.850> diameter<00:02:43.030> of<00:02:43.510> different

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
to determine the diameter of different

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:45.690 
to determine the diameter of different
kinds<00:02:44.290> of<00:02:44.380> scat<00:02:44.650> which<00:02:45.160> will<00:02:45.370> help<00:02:45.490> us

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
kinds of scat which will help us

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.870 
kinds of scat which will help us
identify<00:02:46.230> what<00:02:47.230> animal<00:02:47.710> left<00:02:48.220> that<00:02:48.460> sign

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
identify what animal left that sign

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.390 
identify what animal left that sign
there<00:02:49.750> are<00:02:49.780> other<00:02:50.050> things<00:02:50.380> in<00:02:50.560> here<00:02:50.770> too<00:02:51.010> like

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
there are other things in here too like

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.030 
there are other things in here too like
a<00:02:51.550> metal<00:02:52.030> ruler<00:02:52.720> that<00:02:53.020> I<00:02:53.050> use<00:02:53.320> when<00:02:53.890> I'm

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040
