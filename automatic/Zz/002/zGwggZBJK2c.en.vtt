00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:13.420
 in this video we are going to make two designs 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.420
 nail tuxedo 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.790
 we started painting the color nail 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.270
 white so that it looks good let's give it 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:21.270
 two layers 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:30.340
 and we are going to paint the edge of the 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:30.340
 nail in the French manicure style 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.370
 we make a point up in the middle of 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:45.250
 the nail and 4 to the sides and now 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:48.300
 we join these three forming a triangle 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.300
 we fill it 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.150
 and we join these other three 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:02.940
 Now let's do the buttons do 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:05.670
 3 points in a row in the middle of the nail 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:09.230
 for the second design we are going to paste a 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.930
 piece of heat diagonally 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:15.070
 and we cover with black enamel the part of 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.070
 the nail that does not have zeal 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:23.250
 and once dry we remove the piece of 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.250
 zeal very carefully 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.580
 Now let's do the same on the other 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.580
 side 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.740
 and once dry we remove the zeal we go to 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.420
 do the bow tie we make a point in 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.420
 half and four the lateral ones 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.570
 we put these three together forming a 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.570
 triangle 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.280
 and these three others forming another 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.280
 triangle 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:06.890
 we fill it well with black enamel 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:10.869
 and finally we make three buttons 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.869
 followed one below the other 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.930
 and once well dry we apply a layer 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.490
 of transparent enamel 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:22.560
 and ready 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:24.870
 this is the result 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.750
