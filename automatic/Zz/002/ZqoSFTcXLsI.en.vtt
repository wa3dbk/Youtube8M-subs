00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
and for the first time ever we've

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.130 
and for the first time ever we've
increased<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.559> size<00:00:37.800> of<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.129> display<00:00:39.140> by

00:00:59.830 --> 00:00:59.840 
to achieve a design this thing we had to

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.540 
to achieve a design this thing we had to
look<00:00:59.960> at<00:01:00.110> making<00:01:00.470> many<00:01:00.800> of<00:01:00.980> the<00:01:01.130> components

inside<00:01:49.460> the<00:01:49.670> phone<00:01:49.910> very<00:01:50.390> carefully<00:01:51.020> we've

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
inside the phone very carefully we've

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.070 
inside the phone very carefully we've
created<00:01:51.950> the<00:01:52.280> new<00:01:52.490> much<00:01:53.000> smaller<00:01:53.390> lightning

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
created the new much smaller lightning

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.440 
created the new much smaller lightning
connector<00:01:54.590> it's<00:01:55.070> all<00:01:55.310> digital<00:01:55.550> so<00:01:56.210> it's

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
connector it's all digital so it's

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.050 
connector it's all digital so it's
designed<00:01:56.869> for<00:01:57.020> today's<00:01:57.380> juices<00:01:57.920> and<00:01:58.160> we<00:01:58.850> made

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
designed for today's juices and we made

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.590 
designed for today's juices and we made
it<00:01:59.180> reversible<00:01:59.750> so<00:02:00.170> it<00:02:00.320> fits<00:02:00.590> either<00:02:00.800> way<00:02:01.600> we

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
it reversible so it fits either way we

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.500 
it reversible so it fits either way we
also<00:02:02.780> move<00:02:03.200> to<00:02:03.409> a<00:02:03.440> sapphire<00:02:04.040> lens<00:02:04.490> cover<00:02:04.909> which

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:05.510 
also move to a sapphire lens cover which

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.660 
also move to a sapphire lens cover which
is<00:02:05.659> thinner<00:02:06.049> and<00:02:06.409> more<00:02:06.440> durable<00:02:07.340> than<00:02:07.549> the

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
is thinner and more durable than the

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.000 
is thinner and more durable than the
previous<00:02:08.330> cover<00:02:08.600> glass<00:02:08.780> this<00:02:09.530> really

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:10.010 
previous cover glass this really

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
previous cover glass this really
protects<00:02:10.429> the<00:02:10.640> optics<00:02:11.120> keeps<00:02:11.690> your<00:02:11.900> photos

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
protects the optics keeps your photos

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.120 
protects the optics keeps your photos
I<00:02:13.120> don't<00:02:13.750> think<00:02:13.810> the<00:02:14.050> level<00:02:14.290> of<00:02:14.500> convention

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
I don't think the level of convention
