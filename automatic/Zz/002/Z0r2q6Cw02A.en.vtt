 safe and fun and above all very healthy 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.439
 because it has neither preservatives nor 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.239
 dyes then it is for children 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.190
 of course especially for the 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.870
 infant feeding that is designed 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.550
 so you can enjoy in the kitchen at home 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.550
 so come on let's go there 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.940
 Y 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:01:01.110
 first we have the flour the water 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.110
 tempered if you are going to help me 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:08.360
 to hydrate a little the yeast and 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:12.380
 does not take away so much what is 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:14.870
 the block and undoing that is irak and what 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:18.400
 that we have is the already heavy flour in a 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.400
 volcano let's add the water 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.670
 the butter you do not know that this 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.680
 allure butter for that of 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:30.090
 butter that is one of the richest in the 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.090
 I am the one who uses in my kitchen 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:38.770
 for the taste is very natural has has 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:40.930
 a special part that is the creaminess 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:47.100
 the authority is easy to spread 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:47.100
 chuli butter let's put the salt 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.350
 and now when you have the leaven more 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.800
 pasty 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:57.620
 let's get us here we said as 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.570
 always says hands in flour yes as 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:02.720
 we hear it the real one when 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:06.100
 have lists and if it is already liquid 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.100
 well let's go beyond a hole 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:12.280
 and now let's do it is once 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:14.500
 this mass we are going to put the must the 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.530
 let's let it rest how long a 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.450
 hour with 40 minutes or so this 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.370
 It needs a fermentation they are small 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.760
 fermentation for yeast to make 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:28.480
 its effect of knowledge and lord I like 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:30.220
 the masses of bread if I made them small 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:34.790
 what I started doing as a child with 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:38.060
 six years it was good small small 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:40.069
 the pizzas or the bread bases is what 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.560
 he liked it better and we 're going to help him now 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:44.480
 that I have it called dominated and 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.310
 haciendas if you are going to go towards 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.030
 inside if I go washing my hands 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.819
 OK 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:52.970
 that's already perfect now let's leave 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:55.099
 to rest and while resting you know 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.769
 what are we going to do the filling 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:03:00.590
 for good he will fix it we can put 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:03.139
 in a year we go there we leave it 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.280
 rest vale line let's do the 

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:06.230
 tomatito for pizza 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:09.470
 that's the doctor's knob we're going to cut 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.730
 the onion in burgas is worth you know that 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.189
 always be very careful to 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.829
 cut the food because the 

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:18.439
 Knives do not know anyone they know 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:20.169
 the vegetables is always a food that 

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:23.720
 we have to introduce in our diet 

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:26.269
 of all the parties as we carry the 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.840
 mushroom well we put it a 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:31.790
 little salt to help 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:34.329
 we put the tomato they know it well if 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.329
 Let's go there 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.670
 in a little bit of salt too so that 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.140
 sude 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:42.200
 go now let's go cutting the 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:44.810
 basil vale is always caught coils 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.099
 rolled it and now I yes 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.840
 cut him with the back of the 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:49.220
 knife actually what we do is 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.410
 add just a little bit to the tomato to 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.900
 to give it the aroma once there in the water 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:56.989
 Well, the tomato is doing very well 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:58.370
 low of course the chicken in two 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:03:59.750
 stations with him now we 're going to 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.489
 I'll teach you 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:04.670
 I'm short a few and you few others are worth 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:06.350
 ok we add the basil a little to the 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:08.470
 tomato to release the freshness and the 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:10.450
 to Rome 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:14.000
 a few finite taquitos so that we 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:16.579
 make with your own pizza on it 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:21.829
 in the oven it's good to see now 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:24.470
 we turn our hand the flour the flour that 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:28.540
 help us to knead and that we can not 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:31.040
 that's if we give it the round 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:34.000
 let's do the square square 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.000
 square 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:42.129
 there is to expose it so you are are you are 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.259
 a type of risk 

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:46.340
 there is a trick to those who like the 

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:48.470
 edge 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:52.490
 it unfolds a little bit inside 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:54.820
 mass for death if you like 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:57.699
 with good mass that has good for and not 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:59.870
 but come on I like it's bread 

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:01.760
 let's now fill in the clue it seems 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:05.690
 well fine but you've learned enough 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:08.000
 tricks like how to move forward and the 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:10.639
 thing here we have the dining room or home 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.229
 that what we are going to do is with a 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:14.750
 spoon look at me I have an example worth 

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:16.790
 issues such as Galician pies if 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:19.850
 with the base teaspoon thus stretching a 

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:23.479
 little bit worth it but that more help is the 

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:28.300
 encourage to put our massage the 

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:28.300
 special if it seems like you have 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:34.780
 that the floor is shaped like a puzzle and 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:38.099
 besides that they have a puzzle shape 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:38.099
 he's super good 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:48.160
 it's super creamy carlos good 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:50.389
 well this has a pint of militias 

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:55.260
 let's put a touch of oregano 

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:57.740
 Ok, it looks good 

00:05:55.260 --> 00:06:02.930
 there we are going to put it to 200 degrees 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:04.820
 in about 15-20 minutes there is 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:07.310
 only what to expect has a good 

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:09.590
 Pa does not paint painted and we're going to 

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:14.050
 cut a little look let's stretch 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:17.050
 that's not an app from the sea I help you 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:17.050
 we go 

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:26.900
 this works as it is very good 

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:28.250
 we have also done from scratch from the 

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:33.760
 base 

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:37.340
