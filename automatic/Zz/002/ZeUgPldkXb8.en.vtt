that bulky look that it had and the
other<00:03:32.250> kind<00:03:32.760> is<00:03:33.120> that<00:03:33.630> it's<00:03:33.780> a<00:03:33.930> little<00:03:34.170> shiny<00:03:34.380> I

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
other kind is that it's a little shiny I

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.080 
other kind is that it's a little shiny I
definitely<00:03:35.040> have<00:03:35.160> to<00:03:35.250> put<00:03:35.400> some<00:03:35.579> baby<00:03:35.790> powder

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
so that it didn't look shiny or I

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.530 
so that it didn't look shiny or I
haven't<00:03:40.260> gotten<00:03:40.500> a<00:03:40.769> shading<00:03:41.310> at<00:03:41.489> all<00:03:41.730> no
