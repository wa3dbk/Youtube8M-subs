00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
picture that I was talking about now

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.270 
picture that I was talking about now
here<00:02:33.930> is<00:02:34.080> the<00:02:34.200> picture<00:02:34.530> that<00:02:34.560> I<00:02:34.710> was<00:02:34.950> talking

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
here is the picture that I was talking

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.910 
here is the picture that I was talking
about<00:02:35.520> if<00:02:36.390> you<00:02:36.540> guys<00:02:36.630> can<00:02:36.840> see<00:02:37.050> the<00:02:37.230> two<00:02:37.470> blue

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
about if you guys can see the two blue

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.340 
about if you guys can see the two blue
little<00:02:38.190> markers<00:02:38.670> there<00:02:38.880> or<00:02:39.330> the<00:02:39.480> two<00:02:39.660> bands<00:02:40.050> I

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
little markers there or the two bands I

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.560 
little markers there or the two bands I
guess<00:02:40.500> you<00:02:40.680> can<00:02:40.800> call<00:02:40.950> them<00:02:41.130> are<00:02:41.640> exactly<00:02:42.420> the

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
guess you can call them are exactly the

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:43.970 
guess you can call them are exactly the
same<00:02:42.750> as<00:02:42.990> what's<00:02:43.140> on<00:02:43.200> the<00:02:43.260> flag<00:02:43.530> along<00:02:43.800> with

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
same as what's on the flag along with

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.530 
same as what's on the flag along with
the<00:02:44.100> blue<00:02:44.400> stripe<00:02:44.610> and<00:02:44.940> the<00:02:45.090> white<00:02:45.240> stripe

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
the blue stripe and the white stripe

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.810 
the blue stripe and the white stripe
going<00:02:46.020> down<00:02:46.350> the<00:02:46.500> side<00:02:46.709> and<00:02:47.010> the<00:02:47.220> brown<00:02:47.520> pole

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
going down the side and the brown pole

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.120 
going down the side and the brown pole
that's<00:02:48.000> holding<00:02:48.420> on<00:02:48.540> and<00:02:48.720> the<00:02:49.680> reason<00:02:50.010> why

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
that's holding on and the reason why

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.590 
that's holding on and the reason why
they<00:02:50.400> look<00:02:50.520> different<00:02:50.880> just<00:02:51.030> in<00:02:51.150> texture<00:02:51.480> is

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
they look different just in texture is

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.540 
they look different just in texture is
because<00:02:51.930> clubpenguin<00:02:52.590> amazing<00:02:53.250> gonna<00:02:53.340> give

you the exact picture they actually they

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.020 
you the exact picture they actually they
draw<00:02:55.380> the<00:02:55.440> picture<00:02:55.890> themselves<00:02:56.430> so<00:02:56.880> that's

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
draw the picture themselves so that's

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.949

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
because of this one picture here

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:24.979 
because of this one picture here
now<00:03:23.370> the<00:03:23.430> next<00:03:23.730> two<00:03:23.880> pictures<00:03:24.239> that<00:03:24.269> do<00:03:24.690> have

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
now the next two pictures that do have

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:28.670 
now the next two pictures that do have
the<00:03:25.550> question<00:03:26.550> marks<00:03:26.900> around<00:03:27.900> them<00:03:28.140> I'm<00:03:28.290> sure

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
the question marks around them I'm sure

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.199 
the question marks around them I'm sure
we're<00:03:28.980> gonna<00:03:29.190> get<00:03:29.280> more<00:03:29.459> information<00:03:29.760> on<00:03:30.150> that

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
we're gonna get more information on that

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:33.259 
we're gonna get more information on that
because<00:03:30.570> this<00:03:30.900> one<00:03:31.050> was<00:03:31.200> released<00:03:32.000> maybe<00:03:33.000> I'd

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
because this one was released maybe I'd

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.330 
because this one was released maybe I'd
say<00:03:33.480> day<00:03:33.750> after<00:03:34.170> the<00:03:34.380> actual<00:03:34.830> pictures<00:03:35.160> were

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
say day after the actual pictures were

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.690 
say day after the actual pictures were
released<00:03:35.930> so<00:03:36.930> I'm<00:03:37.860> assuming<00:03:38.100> those<00:03:38.370> are<00:03:38.400> going

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
released so I'm assuming those are going

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.820 
released so I'm assuming those are going
to<00:03:38.760> be<00:03:38.900> released<00:03:39.900> as<00:03:40.080> well<00:03:40.230> too<00:03:40.440> which<00:03:40.680> I'm

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
to be released as well too which I'm

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.530 
to be released as well too which I'm
really<00:03:41.160> really<00:03:41.280> excited<00:03:41.489> to<00:03:41.880> say<00:03:42.000> because<00:03:42.360> I

a monster sing party and so I wasn't
sure<00:03:51.690> at<00:03:51.989> the<00:03:52.049> beginning<00:03:52.290> but<00:03:52.590> um<00:03:52.799> now<00:03:53.400> I'm

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
100% confident that it will be that and

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.370 
100% confident that it will be that and
that<00:03:56.670> could<00:03:56.910> also<00:03:57.060> be<00:03:57.239> where<00:03:57.690> the<00:03:57.870> classroom

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
that could also be where the classroom

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.920 
that could also be where the classroom
comes<00:03:58.680> in<00:03:58.890> so<00:03:59.580> we<00:04:00.000> can<00:04:00.209> look<00:04:00.390> forward<00:04:00.690> to

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930
