00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.910

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.069

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.099

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.570

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:13.830

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.230
 September but I'm a little late 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.170
 because frankly I'm overwhelmed 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.880
 finally and then overwhelmed first I 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.230
 exceeded the 500 subscribers so I'm going 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.500
 make a contest for the 500 subscribers 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.250
 so you already have about 650 I 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.080
 wish to thank you 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.220
 but now I have no time to 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.510
 make the video of the 500 competitions 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.669

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.960
