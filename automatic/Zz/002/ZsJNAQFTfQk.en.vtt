00:00:55.904 --> 00:00:58.359
Hello, Ogawa here.

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.729
And today I have the Mini VENT here.

00:01:00.862 --> 00:01:03.330
For Guitar. There's one for Organ too.

00:01:03.567 --> 00:01:06.667
The one I'm using now is for guitar.

00:01:06.902 --> 00:01:09.970
Basically, it's a rotary cabinet simulator.

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.740
A Leslie speaker simulator, if you will.

00:01:13.095 --> 00:01:16.244
I think you can tell by looking at it, it's very simple!

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:17.745
There are only two switches on it!

00:01:18.394 --> 00:01:19.280
Just two switches, that's it.

00:01:19.497 --> 00:01:21.750
There's an A/B switch back here though, so you can

00:01:21.962 --> 00:01:25.462
save two presets and switch between them.

00:01:25.754 --> 00:01:27.989
To make a preset, you use the two switches,

00:01:28.387 --> 00:01:31.887
and choose from 5 drive types, and cabinet size,

00:01:32.357 --> 00:01:35.530
5 sizes, mix and match and make your own presets.

00:01:35.834 --> 00:01:38.332
And assign them to A/B, selectable here.

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:41.979
So what does it sound like? I played a clean tone at the start,

00:01:42.144 --> 00:01:44.572
but let's compare clean and distortion shall we?

00:01:44.774 --> 00:01:47.242
Let's set it to bypass first.

00:01:50.845 --> 00:01:52.614
So the clean tone was like this.

00:01:53.457 --> 00:01:54.749
The straight sound.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:57.552
Turn the effect on.

00:01:59.497 --> 00:02:01.189
It's set to slow rotary right now.

00:02:07.195 --> 00:02:08.429
Switch it to fast.

00:02:13.317 --> 00:02:14.369
Yeah, that's really...

00:02:22.077 --> 00:02:23.745
That's one way you can use it.

00:02:24.155 --> 00:02:28.082
Or as I played in the start, a slow rotary, and cutting technique.

00:02:40.802 --> 00:02:42.630
Like that. Feels great!

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.434
Let's switch from A to B.

00:02:46.624 --> 00:02:50.124
There we go. This one seems like the cabinet is closer.

00:02:51.592 --> 00:02:54.075
The sound is stronger, and distorted a bit.

00:02:55.637 --> 00:02:56.477
Hear it?

00:03:01.492 --> 00:03:03.150
Back to the previous setting.

00:03:05.604 --> 00:03:08.857
Hear the difference? Now, you can make your own presets,

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:11.825
so you can tailor the sound to your liking.

00:03:11.997 --> 00:03:14.829
What's it like on a distorted sound?

00:03:17.407 --> 00:03:18.734
The slow setting, ok?

00:03:31.542 --> 00:03:32.614
Or how about a slightly crunched sound?

00:03:36.025 --> 00:03:37.652
Ah yeah that's really nice.

00:03:44.377 --> 00:03:45.827
Sounds good fast too.

00:03:57.652 --> 00:04:00.275
Right? This sounds really good too.

00:04:00.777 --> 00:04:02.377
One more interesting thing about this,

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:04.245
if you push both switches, it stops the rotor.

00:04:06.682 --> 00:04:07.549
It'll slow down &amp; stop.

00:04:10.855 --> 00:04:11.752
Almost there.

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:15.724
There. It stopped.

00:04:16.337 --> 00:04:19.837
I like this sound. When you have it bypassed,

00:04:20.062 --> 00:04:23.562
the sounds becomes sort of centered?

00:04:23.795 --> 00:04:25.834
But when on, it spreads out quite a bit.

00:04:28.392 --> 00:04:31.892
So if you're playing rhythm guitar and you want a bit more spread,

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.974
this is perfect.

00:04:56.307 --> 00:04:59.700
Let's take a look at the connections.

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:03.349
Here we are, uh, you'll notice the DC plug, this doesn't run on batteries.

00:05:03.537 --> 00:05:05.540
There's a 12V DC adapter.

00:05:05.764 --> 00:05:08.309
You've got a mono input, the A/B switch,

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:09.910
and a stereo output.

00:05:10.224 --> 00:05:12.247
As you can see, I'm using the stereo outputs, but

00:05:12.485 --> 00:05:15.817
but you can hook up just the R out for mono, to a guitar amp,

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:19.020
and still get that unique rotary sound with no problem.

00:05:19.235 --> 00:05:22.735
Little things like this make me feel like, "Ah, it's for guitars"

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:26.327
and it's true bypass as well,

00:05:26.565 --> 00:05:29.297
no degradation of sound quality,

00:05:29.505 --> 00:05:30.832
things like that.

00:05:31.087 --> 00:05:33.367
So, the mini VENT.

00:05:33.615 --> 00:05:37.115
To tell you the truth, rotary cabinet simulators, well, they

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:39.340
are something I rarely ever use.

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:42.344
I mean I have one, and have used it when I needed to,

00:05:42.514 --> 00:05:44.145
but it's not something I actively think to use.

00:05:44.335 --> 00:05:46.514
But I have to ay I recommend this one!

00:05:46.672 --> 00:05:50.172
I especially like the way it sounds slow, on cutting.

00:05:50.395 --> 00:05:52.020
That REALLY sounded great!

00:05:52.227 --> 00:05:53.889
That's the deal breaker for me, personally.

00:05:54.074 --> 00:05:57.574
Phaser and chorus is cool, but when you want something a tad different,

00:05:57.789 --> 00:05:59.594
this is awesome!

00:05:59.737 --> 00:06:02.930
Find one at a shop and try it out yourself!

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:03.999
I think you'll love it!

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:11.600
