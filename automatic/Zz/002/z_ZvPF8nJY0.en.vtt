00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:25.860
 Here's a little bit of these on top of this 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:29.330
 There is diamond, but this is 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:32.980
 For the d 800 d 600 , let's do it here 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:36.340
 So there is no big r here 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:39.450
 It is Nashi have'm here I come with perform tomorrow 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:42.780
 Yes it will be part of the outer periphery 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:47.480
 After it + the Tteyuu big difference 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.480
 It is here, as can be seen clearly me anymore 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:58.130
 It is a part of the dial 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:01:03.260
 If we introduce from d 800, this is locomo while pressing the lock button 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:08.930
 First of all, there is also the Tokai final stage , so the outer circumference is continuous shooting mode and single shutter 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:15.230
 More later because the self-timer mirror usually can be switched here 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:16.159
 After this, while pressing this button, a note with a sheet-fed back dial or a note written here 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:22.780
 Is 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:22.780
 Though we can change many places with blanket photography though 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:33.479
 In the case of d 600, this dial is the same 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:35.850
 When the outer circumference turns around by unlocking here 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:42.990
 From too up 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:44.480
 I can do everything until I get on continuous shooting so it's a big difference button here 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.750
 Though 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:52.890
 this 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:57.290
 That immediately can be seen in one looks say more easily It is Massenet has become a dial-up 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.930
 In the case of made you Hey d 800 to be referred to 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.050
 Good 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:05.880
 The point is the shutter 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:10.260
 It is all about aperture priority after star 6 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:12.750
 While checking the electronic panel while pressing the button or while checking in the viewfinder 

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:16.410
 I choose with the dial 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:19.450
 Here immediately another appearance in the case of d 600 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.950
 Turn while centering 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.340
 If you decide 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.340
 Said in 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:32.400
 There is also a full auto I have a bag separately from the program auto 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.400
 How about shutter speed priority 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:40.670
 It may be said that this is aperture priority Yes 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:44.530
 Of course you can easily set up the area here 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:47.960
 So was the upper dial is equipped with dial both lock 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:55.310
 I do not have to go around by mistake 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:57.900
 Yes, I wrote about 8 people, but when I buy this for a moment 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.920
 I referred to 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:05.280
 Of the release button 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.550
 The shutter button also has a slightly different angle 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:11.950
 Hey 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:17.610
 Somehow it curves a little smoothly towards the outside of t 800 but d 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:17.610
 600 feeling that curved toward the straight ahead while in the case of 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:24.870
 Well , I think it might be different to somebody, but no good 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.080
 Hmm 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:31.690
 That's quite different, isn't it 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:39.100
 Though it mon after Well grip 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:43.510
 It so that overall greater in d 800 is the feeling that gripped the Gu' 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:48.760
 In the case of d 600, what kind of side is this ? 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:53.680
 I than the jerk-mer be because You're here is first thin we have that as a tapering 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:59.159
 It will look to grip with a jerk as it is felt to be fit 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:59.159
 So after all, compared to this alone, it's all over again 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:12.319
 It's expected large Tteyuu Na or a lightweight system 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:14.640
 Here to me Mars other on whether Concern appeared It is the emergence usual Tanida's in 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:17.620
 I just electronic 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:22.450
 At first from d 800 people 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:26.389
 I will keep it in place, so it's annoying to remove the strap for a while 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:27.460
 Strap is about the opportunity 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:31.660
 However 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:39.289
 Overall we have to carpet dropped out 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:41.700
 It is line 17g to measure in the state dropped outside by the school feeling 

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:46.020
 1017 g why 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:50.060
 Well it is about 1 kilometer t 800 card is 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:53.210
 Contains is from the battery 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:56.470
 I want you to change it a bit again and again 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:58.950
 We will continue to show the 600 to 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:01.460
 Place 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:03.710
 How many 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:07.010
 870 chi 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:11.289
 So you're about 200g now ? 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:15.550
 This is 200 grams of sour 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:19.570
 It is very huge I am 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:20.560
 It's big, so the size is different. 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:23.660
 It is not 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:27.750
 I forgot, but it's Urakawa 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:30.480
 Actually there is a big difference in the lacquer 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:32.870
 I wonder if you farewell of philately 

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:35.860
 9 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:40.340
 Tripod screw holes 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:44.560
 Around is d 800 is rubber 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:44.560
 However, d 600 is plastic 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:57.699
 So it seems that some people say that it's slippery after all 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:06:03.250
 Well just the tripod itself pan head to stop the child of the tripod 

00:05:57.699 --> 00:06:08.919
 As cork is pasted in the times , I think that it should be shaken as it is 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:12.270
 I do not know that I do not finish Mara I actually touched in a little big liturgy shop there 

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:12.270
 Please compare 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:20.510
 It has been 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:20.510
 me
