00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.930 
thing to note though don't use cardstock
or<00:01:39.530> dimensionals<00:01:40.530> because<00:01:41.010> it'll<00:01:41.400> add<00:01:41.610> too

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940 
or dimensionals because it'll add too

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.090 
or dimensionals because it'll add too
much<00:01:42.120> bulk<00:01:42.450> and<00:01:42.810> then<00:01:42.900> if<00:01:43.170> you're<00:01:43.560> using<00:01:43.740> it<00:01:43.980> as

much bulk and then if you're using it as

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.610 
much bulk and then if you're using it as
a<00:01:44.130> bookmark<00:01:44.460> it<00:01:45.030> might<00:01:45.240> deform<00:01:46.110> your<00:01:46.170> book<00:01:46.500> a

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:46.620 
a bookmark it might deform your book a

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.160 
a bookmark it might deform your book a
little<00:01:46.740> bit<00:01:46.970> or<00:01:47.970> even<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.630> sides<00:01:48.930> of<00:01:49.110> the

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
little bit or even the sides of the

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.170 
little bit or even the sides of the
embellishments<00:01:49.740> will<00:01:49.860> get<00:01:50.010> caught<00:01:50.370> and<00:01:50.730> tear

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
embellishments will get caught and tear

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.140 
embellishments will get caught and tear
off<00:01:51.500> so<00:01:52.500> we're<00:01:52.680> just<00:01:52.710> using<00:01:53.010> plain<00:01:53.370> patterned

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.150 
off so we're just using plain patterned

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.930 
off so we're just using plain patterned
paper<00:01:54.390> I'm<00:01:54.690> using<00:01:55.190> two<00:01:56.190> different<00:01:56.520> sizes<00:01:56.730> of

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
paper I'm using two different sizes of

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.130 
paper I'm using two different sizes of
scalloped<00:01:57.420> labor<00:01:57.630> punches<00:01:58.790> and<00:01:59.790> it<00:02:00.780> doesn't

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
scalloped labor punches and it doesn't

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.410 
scalloped labor punches and it doesn't
really<00:02:01.290> matter<00:02:01.590> which<00:02:02.280> ones<00:02:02.610> you<00:02:02.820> start<00:02:03.180> with

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
really matter which ones you start with

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.389 
really matter which ones you start with
actually<00:02:04.230> I<00:02:04.260> do<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:05.040> same<00:02:05.430> piece<00:02:05.700> of<00:02:05.730> paper

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:07.399 
actually I do the same piece of paper

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:11.509 
actually I do the same piece of paper
with<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.429> same<00:02:08.819> size<00:02:09.179> punch<00:02:09.690> I<00:02:10.160> just<00:02:11.160> found<00:02:11.310> it

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:11.519 
with the same size punch I just found it

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:13.100 
with the same size punch I just found it
looks<00:02:11.730> a<00:02:11.879> little<00:02:12.000> nicer<00:02:12.269> when<00:02:12.690> you<00:02:12.810> put<00:02:12.989> them

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
looks a little nicer when you put them

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.290 
looks a little nicer when you put them
together<00:02:13.260> and<00:02:13.830> this<00:02:14.310> one<00:02:14.519> is<00:02:14.670> a<00:02:14.700> scalloped

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
together and this one is a scalloped

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.780 
together and this one is a scalloped
square<00:02:15.930> and<00:02:16.260> it's<00:02:16.440> just<00:02:16.769> a<00:02:16.950> slightly<00:02:17.430> bit

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
square and it's just a slightly bit

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:26.930 
square and it's just a slightly bit
larger

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:32.070 

let's<00:02:27.940> punched<00:02:28.270> out<00:02:30.090> so<00:02:31.090> we'll<00:02:31.300> line<00:02:31.540> up<00:02:31.569> our

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
let's punched out so we'll line up our

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.839 
let's punched out so we'll line up our
papers<00:02:32.800> and<00:02:32.830> since<00:02:33.190> this<00:02:33.370> has<00:02:33.580> married

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:33.849 
papers and since this has married

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:35.940 
papers and since this has married
Christmas<00:02:34.239> on<00:02:34.390> it<00:02:34.540> I<00:02:34.630> want<00:02:34.810> to<00:02:34.870> make<00:02:34.930> sure<00:02:35.290> that

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
Christmas on it I want to make sure that

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.220 
Christmas on it I want to make sure that
it's<00:02:36.220> down<00:02:36.700> so<00:02:37.180> that<00:02:37.360> when<00:02:37.510> you<00:02:37.630> open<00:02:37.810> the<00:02:38.080> book

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
it's down so that when you open the book

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.050 
it's down so that when you open the book
you<00:02:38.500> can<00:02:38.680> read<00:02:39.010> the<00:02:39.190> Merry<00:02:39.340> Christmas<00:02:39.580> and

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
you can read the Merry Christmas and

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.340 
you can read the Merry Christmas and
we'll<00:02:40.660> start<00:02:41.080> with<00:02:41.290> the<00:02:41.500> longer<00:02:41.920> end<00:02:42.160> of<00:02:42.430> the

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
we'll start with the longer end of the

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.970 
we'll start with the longer end of the
paper<00:02:44.350> clip<00:02:44.680> and<00:02:44.890> I<00:02:45.430> found<00:02:45.850> it's<00:02:46.269> smart<00:02:47.200> to

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
paper clip and I found it's smart to

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.259 
paper clip and I found it's smart to
scotch<00:02:48.459> tape<00:02:48.959> the<00:02:49.959> paper<00:02:50.260> clip<00:02:50.680> down<00:02:51.269> first

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
scotch tape the paper clip down first

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:55.170 
scotch tape the paper clip down first
because<00:02:53.170> there's<00:02:53.410> less<00:02:53.709> chance<00:02:54.100> of<00:02:54.880> it

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
because there's less chance of it

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.090 
because there's less chance of it
pulling<00:02:55.660> out<00:02:55.930> it<00:02:56.260> just<00:02:56.290> gives<00:02:56.650> it<00:02:56.769> a<00:02:56.860> little

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
pulling out it just gives it a little

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.300 
pulling out it just gives it a little
more<00:02:57.360> reinforcement<00:02:58.500> so<00:02:59.500> I<00:02:59.530> put<00:02:59.709> a<00:02:59.739> couple<00:03:00.069> of

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
more reinforcement so I put a couple of

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:09.390 
more reinforcement so I put a couple of
pieces<00:03:00.489> of<00:03:00.760> tape<00:03:06.090> hold<00:03:07.090> that<00:03:08.100> and<00:03:09.100> then<00:03:09.250> I'll

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
pieces of tape hold that and then I'll

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.670 
pieces of tape hold that and then I'll
take<00:03:09.640> my<00:03:09.670> tacky<00:03:10.330> glue<00:03:10.630> and<00:03:10.900> it's<00:03:11.140> important<00:03:11.650> to

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
take my tacky glue and it's important to

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.460 
take my tacky glue and it's important to
get<00:03:11.890> up<00:03:12.069> to<00:03:12.250> the<00:03:12.370> edges<00:03:12.580> on<00:03:13.030> this<00:03:13.470> because

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
get up to the edges on this because

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:15.930 
get up to the edges on this because
that's<00:03:14.709> what's<00:03:15.010> going<00:03:15.160> to<00:03:15.220> hold<00:03:15.519> it<00:03:15.730> all

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
that's what's going to hold it all

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.479 
that's what's going to hold it all
together<00:03:16.150> and<00:03:16.690> get<00:03:17.319> in<00:03:17.590> between<00:03:18.100> the<00:03:18.280> paper

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
together and get in between the paper

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:23.430 
together and get in between the paper
clip<00:03:18.970> as<00:03:19.150> well<00:03:19.680> and<00:03:21.450> then<00:03:22.450> just<00:03:22.690> slide<00:03:23.049> that

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
clip as well and then just slide that

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.870 
clip as well and then just slide that
one<00:03:23.739> and<00:03:24.480> I<00:03:25.480> go<00:03:25.720> about<00:03:25.930> half<00:03:26.350> way<00:03:26.380> up<00:03:27.040> the<00:03:27.700> end

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
one and I go about half way up the end

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.229 
one and I go about half way up the end
of<00:03:28.120> the<00:03:28.209> paper<00:03:28.450> clip<00:03:28.959> so<00:03:29.769> that<00:03:29.799> it's<00:03:30.220> past<00:03:30.609> the

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 
of the paper clip so that it's past the

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:34.580 
of the paper clip so that it's past the
shorter<00:03:31.810> part<00:03:32.079> but<00:03:32.769> that<00:03:33.010> it<00:03:33.220> gives<00:03:33.519> you<00:03:33.790> a

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
shorter part but that it gives you a

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.440 
shorter part but that it gives you a
good<00:03:35.590> amount<00:03:35.890> of<00:03:35.920> paper<00:03:36.190> clip<00:03:36.609> to<00:03:36.880> grip<00:03:37.180> and

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
good amount of paper clip to grip and

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.099 
good amount of paper clip to grip and
make<00:03:38.019> sure<00:03:38.230> you<00:03:38.440> go<00:03:38.620> around<00:03:38.739> the<00:03:39.160> edges<00:03:40.109> with

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:41.109 
make sure you go around the edges with

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:43.670 
make sure you go around the edges with
your<00:03:41.290> hands<00:03:41.560> real<00:03:41.859> real<00:03:42.670> well<00:03:42.850> so<00:03:42.880> that<00:03:43.390> it<00:03:43.510> all

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
your hands real real well so that it all

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.740 
your hands real real well so that it all
sticks<00:03:44.680> tight<00:03:44.950> that's<00:03:45.549> another<00:03:46.150> reason<00:03:46.390> why<00:03:46.720> I

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
sticks tight that's another reason why I

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.470 
sticks tight that's another reason why I
don't<00:03:46.900> use<00:03:47.109> cardstock<00:03:47.709> because<00:03:48.579> paper<00:03:49.120> is<00:03:49.450> a

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
don't use cardstock because paper is a

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.030 
don't use cardstock because paper is a
little<00:03:49.840> more<00:03:50.019> manipulable<00:03:52.620> then<00:03:53.620> we'll<00:03:53.829> take

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
little more manipulable then we'll take

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.610 
little more manipulable then we'll take
the<00:03:54.280> second<00:03:54.790> one<00:03:54.820> and<00:03:55.239> I<00:03:55.810> like<00:03:56.049> to<00:03:57.090> offset<00:03:58.090> that

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
the second one and I like to offset that

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.240 
the second one and I like to offset that
just<00:03:59.620> like<00:03:59.769> that<00:04:00.010> gives<00:04:00.250> it<00:04:00.400> a<00:04:00.489> nice<00:04:00.640> contrast

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
just like that gives it a nice contrast

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:24.760 
just like that gives it a nice contrast
and<00:04:03.250> again<00:04:04.859> put<00:04:05.859> a<00:04:05.890> couple<00:04:06.250> of<00:04:06.310> pieces<00:04:06.519> of<00:04:06.790> tape

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.860 

then<00:04:25.370> when<00:04:25.520> you're<00:04:25.669> working<00:04:26.180> with<00:04:26.210> scallops

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
then when you're working with scallops

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.300 
then when you're working with scallops
you<00:04:26.990> always<00:04:27.229> have<00:04:27.440> to<00:04:27.620> be<00:04:27.740> careful<00:04:28.160> that<00:04:28.190> you

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
you always have to be careful that you

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.540 
you always have to be careful that you
get<00:04:28.550> those<00:04:28.759> lined<00:04:29.240> up<00:04:29.449> real<00:04:29.840> well<00:04:30.050> and<00:04:30.550> just

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
get those lined up real well and just

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:38.830 
get those lined up real well and just
grip<00:04:32.060> it<00:04:32.150> underneath<00:04:37.479> push<00:04:38.479> it<00:04:38.690> together

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
grip it underneath push it together

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.020 
grip it underneath push it together
really<00:04:39.259> well<00:04:39.409> but<00:04:39.949> make<00:04:40.129> sure<00:04:40.340> that<00:04:40.610> your<00:04:40.819> glue

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030 
really well but make sure that your glue

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:43.779 
really well but make sure that your glue
isn't<00:04:41.240> spilling<00:04:41.930> it<00:04:42.129> over<00:04:43.129> the<00:04:43.250> edges<00:04:43.759> and

00:04:43.779 --> 00:04:43.789 
isn't spilling it over the edges and

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:46.779 
isn't spilling it over the edges and
onto<00:04:44.030> your<00:04:44.569> other<00:04:44.960> side<00:04:45.770> otherwise<00:04:46.220> you're

00:04:46.779 --> 00:04:46.789 
onto your other side otherwise you're

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:48.610 
onto your other side otherwise you're
going<00:04:47.030> to<00:04:47.270> end<00:04:47.360> up<00:04:47.479> sticking<00:04:48.199> the<00:04:48.440> two

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:48.620 
going to end up sticking the two

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.420 
going to end up sticking the two
together<00:04:48.800> and<00:04:49.750> another<00:04:50.830> trick<00:04:51.830> that<00:04:51.889> you<00:04:52.220> can

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
together and another trick that you can

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.790 
together and another trick that you can
use<00:04:52.789> when<00:04:53.449> working<00:04:53.659> with<00:04:53.960> this<00:04:54.169> type<00:04:54.409> of<00:04:54.590> thing

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 
use when working with this type of thing

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.790 
use when working with this type of thing
is<00:04:55.009> to<00:04:55.819> put<00:04:56.659> a<00:04:56.690> piece<00:04:56.810> of<00:04:56.870> saran<00:04:57.319> wrap<00:04:57.560> in

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
is to put a piece of saran wrap in

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.129 
is to put a piece of saran wrap in
between<00:04:58.550> them<00:04:58.729> until<00:04:58.849> you<00:04:59.539> have<00:04:59.659> them<00:04:59.840> glued

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:00.139 
between them until you have them glued

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:08.730 
between them until you have them glued
down<00:05:01.009> tight<00:05:04.870> okay<00:05:06.009> then<00:05:07.009> I'm<00:05:07.099> just<00:05:07.130> going<00:05:07.430> to

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
down tight okay then I'm just going to

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:24.520 
down tight okay then I'm just going to
add<00:05:09.740> my<00:05:10.639> extra<00:05:11.150> embellishments

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:24.530 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:26.740 

and<00:05:24.650> these<00:05:25.220> also<00:05:25.430> would<00:05:25.730> make<00:05:25.940> cute<00:05:26.240> teachers

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:26.750 
and these also would make cute teachers
