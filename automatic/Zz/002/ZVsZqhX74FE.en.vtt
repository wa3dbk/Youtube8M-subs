00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.769 
like damage and then as you can see gets
more<00:00:28.920> powerful<00:00:29.189> about<00:00:29.699> three<00:00:30.029> seconds<00:00:30.420> after

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
more powerful about three seconds after

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.530 
more powerful about three seconds after
pressing<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.140> trigger<00:00:31.369> so<00:00:32.369> as<00:00:32.759> you<00:00:33.270> can<00:00:33.360> see

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
pressing the trigger so as you can see

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.100

the<00:00:33.780> clip<00:00:34.620> with<00:00:35.010> extended<00:00:35.899> thermo<00:00:36.899> Clips

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
the clip with extended thermo Clips

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.410 
the clip with extended thermo Clips
starts<00:00:37.530> at<00:00:37.649> 180<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:38.370> slowly<00:00:38.940> works<00:00:39.149> its<00:00:39.300> way

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
starts at 180 and slowly works its way

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.479 
starts at 180 and slowly works its way
down<00:00:39.450> when<00:00:40.110> you<00:00:40.200> stop<00:00:40.260> shooting<00:00:40.710> it'll<00:00:41.190> start

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
down when you stop shooting it'll start

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.250 
down when you stop shooting it'll start
recharging<00:00:41.790> itself<00:00:42.270> so<00:00:42.480> this<00:00:42.660> gun<00:00:42.840> doesn't

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
recharging itself so this gun doesn't

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.660 
recharging itself so this gun doesn't
actually<00:00:43.379> use<00:00:43.649> thermal<00:00:44.040> clips<00:00:44.219> you'll<00:00:44.430> never

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
actually use thermal clips you'll never

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.240 
actually use thermal clips you'll never
have<00:00:44.879> to<00:00:45.000> worry<00:00:45.149> about<00:00:45.360> going<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.750> get<00:00:46.250> thermal

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
have to worry about going to get thermal

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.069 
have to worry about going to get thermal
clips<00:00:47.579> and<00:00:47.760> going<00:00:48.059> to<00:00:48.149> get<00:00:48.270> more<00:00:48.390> ammo<00:00:48.570> because

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
clips and going to get more ammo because

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.950 
clips and going to get more ammo because
it's<00:00:49.469> basically<00:00:50.070> has<00:00:50.190> unlimited<00:00:50.789> ammo<00:00:51.059> now<00:00:51.780> if

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
it's basically has unlimited ammo now if

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.180 
it's basically has unlimited ammo now if
you<00:00:52.079> get<00:00:52.230> all<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.410> way<00:00:52.500> down<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:52.770> zero<00:00:53.010> you

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
you get all the way down to zero you

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.950 
you get all the way down to zero you
will<00:00:53.399> have<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:53.699> do<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:53.850> reload<00:00:54.180> animation<00:00:54.690> and

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
will have to do a reload animation and

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.959 
will have to do a reload animation and
you'll<00:00:55.230> see<00:00:55.530> me<00:00:55.649> do<00:00:55.829> one<00:00:56.010> I<00:00:56.250> think<00:00:56.370> pretty<00:00:56.670> soon

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
you'll see me do one I think pretty soon

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.959 
you'll see me do one I think pretty soon
now<00:00:57.890> when<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:58.980> do<00:00:59.070> this<00:00:59.160> reload<00:00:59.520> animation

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969

now a tip I have for you guys I kind
discovered<00:01:12.450> is<00:01:12.659> because<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.619> rifle<00:01:14.010> shoots

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
discovered is because the rifle shoots

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.399 
discovered is because the rifle shoots
less<00:01:15.390> powerful<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:15.900> then<00:01:15.990> gets<00:01:16.170> more

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
less powerful and then gets more

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.960 
less powerful and then gets more
powerful<00:01:16.830> if<00:01:17.009> you're<00:01:17.189> facing<00:01:17.400> an<00:01:17.610> enemy<00:01:17.939> like
