00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.070

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:12.090

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.049

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.090
 drinks dracula 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.799
 what happens to the 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.780

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.140
 I see the devil behaving 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:01.780

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.409
