00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
where the and then we're going to snap

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
how you get the wave and then what we're

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.090 
how you get the wave and then what we're
gonna<00:01:54.899> do<00:01:55.049> again<00:01:55.259> is<00:01:55.439> just<00:01:55.470> repeat<00:01:55.950> the

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.240 

using<00:02:15.650> the<00:02:15.740> triple<00:02:16.280> barrel<00:02:17.210> irons<00:02:18.100> works<00:02:19.100> a

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
using the triple barrel irons works a

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.540 
using the triple barrel irons works a
lot<00:02:19.520> better<00:02:19.580> on<00:02:20.180> one<00:02:21.020> length<00:02:21.200> hair<00:02:21.560> it's<00:02:22.460> a

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
lot better on one length hair it's a

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.310
