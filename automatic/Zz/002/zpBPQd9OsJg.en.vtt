in<00:03:46.100> the<00:03:46.430> draft<00:03:46.700> but<00:03:47.269> my<00:03:47.480> goodness<00:03:47.720> went<00:03:48.110> with

the knock on Fowler and maybe this is a

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.630 
the knock on Fowler and maybe this is a
concern<00:03:54.900> for<00:03:55.110> some<00:03:55.650> is<00:03:55.860> the<00:03:56.160> fact<00:03:56.370> that<00:03:56.460> he's

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:58.020 
maybe a little soft that he doesn't

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:59.450 
maybe a little soft that he doesn't
battle<00:03:58.290> and<00:03:58.380> he<00:03:58.440> doesn't<00:03:58.740> compete<00:03:59.010> like<00:03:59.400> a

00:03:59.450 --> 00:03:59.460 
battle and he doesn't compete like a

any of the offense intervention and the

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.060 
any of the offense intervention and the
knock-on<00:04:03.510> Gormley<00:04:03.930> if<00:04:04.080> there<00:04:04.230> is<00:04:04.350> one<00:04:04.560> is<00:04:04.860> that

knock-on Gormley if there is one is that
