feeling back I you know it's hard to say
why<00:02:03.509> I<00:02:03.540> just<00:02:04.079> think<00:02:04.320> after<00:02:04.530> rewatching<00:02:05.460> the

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939

why I just think after rewatching the
Alvarado<00:02:06.570> fight<00:02:06.960> I<00:02:07.229> just<00:02:07.710> have<00:02:07.920> that<00:02:08.160> feeling

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
Alvarado fight I just have that feeling

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.870 
Alvarado fight I just have that feeling
that<00:02:09.860> you<00:02:10.860> know<00:02:11.239> Brandon<00:02:12.239> Rios<00:02:12.569> isn't<00:02:13.319> a

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
that you know Brandon Rios isn't a

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.670

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
cutting off the ring because um I also

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.210 
cutting off the ring because um I also
get<00:03:01.880> the<00:03:02.000> feeling<00:03:02.300> against<00:03:02.780> Mike<00:03:03.440> Alvarado<00:03:03.890> he

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
get the feeling against Mike Alvarado he

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:05.860 
get the feeling against Mike Alvarado he
thought<00:03:04.430> it<00:03:04.700> would<00:03:04.850> be<00:03:05.000> similar<00:03:05.270> to<00:03:05.450> the<00:03:05.600> first

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
thought it would be similar to the first

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.110 
thought it would be similar to the first
fight<00:03:06.230> and<00:03:06.500> he<00:03:07.100> didn't<00:03:07.340> think<00:03:07.550> Mike<00:03:07.700> Alvarado

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
fight and he didn't think Mike Alvarado

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.770 
fight and he didn't think Mike Alvarado
quit<00:03:08.510> could<00:03:08.810> adjust<00:03:09.260> now<00:03:10.160> that<00:03:10.430> he<00:03:10.550> knows<00:03:10.780> his

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
quit could adjust now that he knows his

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.100 
quit could adjust now that he knows his
flaws<00:03:12.230> maybe<00:03:12.650> he<00:03:12.830> can<00:03:13.480> try<00:03:14.480> and<00:03:14.510> improve<00:03:14.870> on

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
flaws maybe he can try and improve on

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:16.840 
flaws maybe he can try and improve on
that<00:03:15.140> and<00:03:15.560> cut<00:03:15.710> off<00:03:15.830> the<00:03:16.010> ring<00:03:16.190> but<00:03:16.460> I<00:03:16.490> think

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
that and cut off the ring but I think

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.690 
that and cut off the ring but I think
Manny<00:03:17.510> Pacquiao<00:03:18.050> if<00:03:18.410> he<00:03:19.130> still<00:03:19.340> has<00:03:19.490> that

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
Manny Pacquiao if he still has that

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.750 
Manny Pacquiao if he still has that
speed<00:03:20.060> and<00:03:20.210> quickness<00:03:20.390> and<00:03:21.460> from<00:03:22.460> what<00:03:22.610> I've

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.690 
speed and quickness and from what I've
seen<00:03:22.790> in<00:03:23.300> his<00:03:23.510> training<00:03:23.900> he<00:03:24.160> he<00:03:25.160> looks<00:03:25.430> pretty

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
seen in his training he he looks pretty

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.900

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:32.240 
just as good as he is and he can take a

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:35.470 
just as good as he is and he can take a
half<00:03:33.200> decent<00:03:33.530> punch<00:03:33.890> if<00:03:34.070> he's<00:03:34.220> recovered<00:03:34.760> like

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
half decent punch if he's recovered like

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.290 
half decent punch if he's recovered like
Tim<00:03:35.750> Bradley<00:03:36.080> did<00:03:36.530> if<00:03:36.680> he's<00:03:36.890> his<00:03:37.670> chin<00:03:38.090> has

Tim Bradley did if he's his chin has

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.990 
Tim Bradley did if he's his chin has
recovered<00:03:38.660> from<00:03:39.080> a<00:03:39.580> devastating<00:03:40.580> knockout

recovered from a devastating knockout

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.350 
recovered from a devastating knockout
defeat<00:03:41.420> I<00:03:42.580> think<00:03:43.580> he<00:03:43.640> goes<00:03:43.850> on<00:03:44.030> to<00:03:44.209> beat

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
defeat I think he goes on to beat

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.010 
defeat I think he goes on to beat
brandon<00:03:45.260> rios<00:03:45.560> by<00:03:46.220> decision<00:03:46.790> and<00:03:46.970> maybe<00:03:47.780> by

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:48.020 
brandon rios by decision and maybe by

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:51.040 
brandon rios by decision and maybe by
stoppage<00:03:48.500> as<00:03:48.620> well<00:03:48.830> um<00:03:49.420> if<00:03:50.420> he<00:03:50.570> completely

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.050 
stoppage as well um if he completely

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:52.480 
stoppage as well um if he completely
gets<00:03:51.440> into<00:03:51.680> that<00:03:51.709> mode<00:03:52.010> where<00:03:52.190> he's<00:03:52.310> held

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:52.490 
gets into that mode where he's held

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:55.810 
gets into that mode where he's held
classing<00:03:52.970> reels<00:03:53.209> which<00:03:54.050> uh<00:03:54.350> i<00:03:54.890> don't<00:03:55.220> think

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:55.820 
classing reels which uh i don't think

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:59.380 
classing reels which uh i don't think
it's<00:03:55.970> gonna<00:03:56.120> be<00:03:56.209> that<00:03:56.360> AA<00:03:57.130> that<00:03:58.130> I<00:03:58.520> think<00:03:58.970> Rios

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390 
it's gonna be that AA that I think Rios

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:00.910 
it's gonna be that AA that I think Rios
is<00:03:59.510> gonna<00:03:59.720> have<00:03:59.900> his<00:04:00.050> moments<00:04:00.470> in<00:04:00.560> the<00:04:00.650> fight

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:00.920 
is gonna have his moments in the fight

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:06.190 
is gonna have his moments in the fight
and<00:04:01.690> I<00:04:02.690> think<00:04:03.050> that<00:04:03.950> Rios<00:04:04.220> is<00:04:04.370> training<00:04:05.200> harder

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200 
and I think that Rios is training harder

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.590 
and I think that Rios is training harder
than<00:04:06.350> he's<00:04:06.470> ever<00:04:06.620> trained<00:04:07.010> before<00:04:07.100> um<00:04:08.000> and

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:08.600 
than he's ever trained before um and

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.530 
than he's ever trained before um and
he's<00:04:08.930> going<00:04:09.290> to<00:04:09.730> come<00:04:10.730> in<00:04:10.910> there<00:04:11.060> with<00:04:11.180> a<00:04:11.240> chip

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
he's going to come in there with a chip

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.810 
he's going to come in there with a chip
on<00:04:11.690> his<00:04:11.810> shoulder<00:04:11.870> it's<00:04:12.560> gonna<00:04:13.160> fight<00:04:13.490> his<00:04:13.640> ass

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:13.820 
on his shoulder it's gonna fight his ass

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:17.229 
on his shoulder it's gonna fight his ass
off<00:04:14.120> and<00:04:15.459> there<00:04:16.459> ain't<00:04:16.640> no<00:04:16.730> way<00:04:16.910> in<00:04:17.060> hell

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
off and there ain't no way in hell

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
because he's gonna go out on a shield

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.800 
because he's gonna go out on a shield
and<00:04:24.560> that's<00:04:25.340> why<00:04:25.550> I<00:04:25.580> saved<00:04:25.970> my<00:04:26.150> patio<00:04:26.660> by
