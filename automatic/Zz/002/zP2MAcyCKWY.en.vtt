 all my dear viewers and subscribers 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:21.610
 my channel with you marathon is worth me 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:25.770
 I present to your attention short 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:29.220
 series in classes in the game red orchestra 2 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:34.629
 today we 'll talk about the class 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:37.300
 shooter playing on any server where 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:39.280
 play a lot of people don't often notice 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.879
 almost always free slots 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:45.280
 Arrow grade rifle shooter have 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:46.600
 hull shooting speed but 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.000
 good accuracy 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.519
 let's talk about the basics of it 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.320
 class as a rule his arsenal 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:56.559
 make up rifle 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:59.480
 two grenades and depending on the settings 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:02.190
 server and become 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:06.390
 low firing speed and high 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.120
 accuracy make you a sniper well only 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.910
 without optical sight 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:13.910
 it is very convenient when defending any 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:16.190
 buildings for example if you sit down at 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:19.130
 any dark corner next to the window 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:21.140
 you will have a good overview of the square 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.200
 next to the building and you will be almost 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:27.190
 impossible to kill and in the meantime 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:29.330
 you can score a couple dozen frags 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:32.270
 pomegranate is very suitable for 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:34.550
 stripping room low speed 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:38.210
 shooting can be a big problem 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:42.380
 at long and close distances for example 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.950
 if you see in the distance 56 enemies more often 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.770
 Total 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.410
 so spawn and runs here and build 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.380
 love only 1 2 until you have time 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.840
 to hide 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.610
 also at close range rifle with 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.890
 low rate of fire is nothing against 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.590
 automat 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.740
 so 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:04.039
 keep your distance this is logical happiness 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:06.399
 when you raise the level of the weapon gives us pc 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:10.099
 and for the stream 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:11.959
 who quickly do a couple of holes in 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:15.750
 close range enemies 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:18.860
 especially indoors 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.070
 Let's talk about the weapons at hand 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:25.170

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:27.570
 USSR Mosin rifle 762 millimeter 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:31.260
 differently it is called a trilinea 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:33.630
 rifle sample 91 year name 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.840
 trilinear comes from the caliber of the trunk 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.880
 rifles which is equal to three Russian 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.150
 clinics old measure of length 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:45.680
 one line is one tenth of an inch or 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:50.760
 two point fifty four millimeters 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:54.269
 accordingly, three lines are equal to 762 mm 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.640
 trilinea system Mosin refers to 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:58.730
 magazine rifles with sliding 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.860

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.150
 the barrel is locked 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:06.569
 symmetrically arranged fighting 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.920

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.900
 locking mechanisms collected on it 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:17.730

 sleeve and misfire interaction 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:29.099
 a reflector for locking the barrel 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:34.349
 serves as a battle larva in two 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:37.650
 Symmetrical made by the German 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:40.940
 The arrow on arms consists rifle 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:43.920
 carbine Mauser k98 to 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:45.840
 k98 carbine k represents 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:49.349

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.449
 placement is completely hidden 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.889
 cartridges in a shop in a staggered manner 

00:03:56.449 --> 00:04:00.989
 store equipment with the shutter open 

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:04.079

 starting from k98 and bent down 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:39.200
 located at the back of the gate 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:43.010
 I personally like the class arrow very much 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:45.770
 because it needs a big skill 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:50.120
 country with other classes if example 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:53.450
 you can ram an attack plane from ppsh 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:56.330
 enemies with a runaway fire here are not 

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:57.850
 aiming you probably will not get 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:00.430
 to the enemy 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:03.560
 the only thing I can advise you 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:06.530
 close combat use bayonet on rifle 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:11.300
 Of course, you first need to pump it 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:14.180
 how do you know the harm in 42 is pumping 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:17.660
 weapons such a role element and pumping 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:20.690
 class in general is the base class for 

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:23.630
 which there is a place in any match 

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:26.200
 playing for this class is difficult but interesting 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:29.480
 single hit from a rifle usually 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:32.530
 deaths for the enemy to the same thing 

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:35.300
 exact weapon benefit so the arrows 

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:36.050
 great choice for long range combat 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.450
 distances 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:41.230
 and with some maneuverability have 

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:44.870
 odds and open 

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:47.470
 Well, well, on this description of classes of fracture 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:52.190
 in the genus orchestre two ends 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:56.540
 subscribe to new videos about class a 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:06:00.740
 also by playing different games. 

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:02.750
 cards in different modes like games red 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:07.150
 orchestra 2 heroes of stalingrad 

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:10.390
 Reisen who did with you was your Marat
