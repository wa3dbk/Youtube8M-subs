00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
something and we find that it's bad will

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:11.860 
something and we find that it's bad will
usually<00:03:10.820> take<00:03:11.090> it<00:03:11.210> back<00:03:11.330> from<00:03:11.450> the<00:03:11.540> customer

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
usually take it back from the customer

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.060 
usually take it back from the customer
and<00:03:11.930> replace<00:03:12.200> it<00:03:12.230> with<00:03:12.380> something<00:03:12.470> better<00:03:12.770> um
