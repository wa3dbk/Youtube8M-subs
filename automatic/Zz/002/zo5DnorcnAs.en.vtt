looking<00:02:13.920> at<00:02:14.010> eight<00:02:14.190> hundred<00:02:14.220> millimeters

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
looking at eight hundred millimeters

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.449 
looking at eight hundred millimeters
that's<00:02:15.480> at<00:02:15.660> least<00:02:15.690> five<00:02:16.470> point<00:02:16.740> six<00:02:16.920> at<00:02:17.160> that

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
that's at least five point six at that

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.460 
that's at least five point six at that
as<00:02:17.700> well<00:02:18.270> cause<00:02:18.630> of<00:02:18.780> stuff<00:02:18.959> wanna<00:02:19.170> join<00:02:19.410> our

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
as well cause of stuff wanna join our

car through well good and then the

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:23.630 
car through well good and then the
distance<00:02:22.740> from<00:02:22.890> your<00:02:22.980> subject<00:02:23.459> and<00:02:23.550> the

at<00:02:32.360> 5.6<00:02:33.360> it<00:02:33.630> did<00:02:33.840> seem<00:02:34.170> that<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.580> exposure<00:02:36.030> is

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
at 5.6 it did seem that the exposure is

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.210 
at 5.6 it did seem that the exposure is
a<00:02:36.360> pad<00:02:36.570> or<00:02:36.750> maybe<00:02:37.080> a<00:02:37.170> third<00:02:37.440> letting<00:02:37.890> Harper

stop<00:02:38.460> under<00:02:39.440> and<00:02:40.440> look<00:02:41.430> sharpness<00:02:41.910> is<00:02:42.000> one

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
stop under and look sharpness is one

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.800 
stop under and look sharpness is one
thing<00:02:42.390> but<00:02:42.660> at<00:02:42.960> f5<00:02:43.470> ff8<00:02:44.460> this<00:02:45.180> thing<00:02:45.420> is<00:02:45.540> as

thing but at f5 ff8 this thing is as

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.350 
thing but at f5 ff8 this thing is as

sharpest lives I have shot with bond
down<00:02:56.490> like<00:02:57.150> i<00:02:57.270> said<00:02:57.330> if<00:02:57.630> 5.6<00:02:58.260> it<00:02:58.350> seems<00:02:58.560> to<00:02:58.709> be<00:02:58.740> a

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
down like i said if 5.6 it seems to be a

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.470 
down like i said if 5.6 it seems to be a
little<00:02:59.130> bit<00:02:59.340> under<00:02:59.610> exposed<00:02:59.970> to<00:03:00.090> be<00:03:00.180> keeping

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
little bit under exposed to be keeping

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.590 
little bit under exposed to be keeping
all<00:03:00.600> your<00:03:00.630> settings<00:03:00.900> are<00:03:01.170> saying<00:03:01.380> so<00:03:02.070> but

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
all your settings are saying so but

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.290 
all your settings are saying so but
Solomon<00:03:03.600> a<00:03:03.930> little<00:03:04.670> either<00:03:05.670> overexposure

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
Solomon a little either overexposure

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.330 
Solomon a little either overexposure
compensate<00:03:06.900> for<00:03:07.050> that<00:03:07.080> exposure<00:03:07.500> or<00:03:08.010> then

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
compensate for that exposure or then

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.680 
compensate for that exposure or then
bump<00:03:08.580> it<00:03:08.700> up<00:03:08.820> a<00:03:08.880> little<00:03:09.150> bit<00:03:09.330> of<00:03:09.390> your<00:03:09.480> post

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
bump it up a little bit of your post

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.300 
bump it up a little bit of your post
processing<00:03:10.140> and<00:03:10.440> you<00:03:10.470> shoot<00:03:11.040> you<00:03:11.130> on<00:03:11.160> the

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
processing and you shoot you on the

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.690 
processing and you shoot you on the
right<00:03:11.459> track<00:03:11.870> chromatic<00:03:12.920> aberration<00:03:13.920> is

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
right track chromatic aberration is

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.390 
right track chromatic aberration is
literally<00:03:15.150> none<00:03:15.330> now<00:03:15.750> what<00:03:15.900> that<00:03:15.930> is<00:03:16.290> is<00:03:16.560> when

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
literally none now what that is is when

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.650 
literally none now what that is is when
you<00:03:17.489> look<00:03:17.610> at<00:03:17.730> images<00:03:17.880> sometimes<00:03:18.239> when<00:03:18.540> you're

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
you look at images sometimes when you're

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.240 
you look at images sometimes when you're
shooting<00:03:18.780> long<00:03:19.080> lenses<00:03:19.440> you<00:03:19.890> get<00:03:20.130> this

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
shooting long lenses you get this

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.010 
shooting long lenses you get this
fringing<00:03:20.730> if<00:03:20.880> you<00:03:20.940> zoom<00:03:20.970> into<00:03:21.360> the<00:03:21.480> image<00:03:21.570> you

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:22.020 
fringing if you zoom into the image you

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.630 
fringing if you zoom into the image you
keep<00:03:22.200> that<00:03:22.320> fringing<00:03:22.800> of<00:03:22.890> a<00:03:22.920> blue<00:03:23.220> or<00:03:23.580> red

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
keep that fringing of a blue or red

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.880 
keep that fringing of a blue or red
color<00:03:24.090> yeah<00:03:24.540> that's<00:03:25.020> chromatic<00:03:25.410> aberration

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
color yeah that's chromatic aberration

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.400 
color yeah that's chromatic aberration
what<00:03:26.310> that<00:03:26.489> means<00:03:26.730> is<00:03:27.000> the<00:03:27.510> long<00:03:27.720> lens<00:03:27.989> isn't

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
what that means is the long lens isn't

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.010 
what that means is the long lens isn't
able<00:03:28.739> to<00:03:28.890> bend<00:03:29.310> all<00:03:29.580> the<00:03:29.640> very<00:03:30.570> different

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:31.020 
able to bend all the very different

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.220 
able to bend all the very different
colors<00:03:31.590> of<00:03:31.620> light<00:03:31.950> onto<00:03:32.310> one<00:03:32.910> point<00:03:33.239> so<00:03:33.959> you

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
colors of light onto one point so you

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:35.840 
colors of light onto one point so you
get<00:03:34.410> that<00:03:34.560> blue<00:03:34.799> fringing<00:03:35.310> happening<00:03:35.670> on<00:03:35.790> the

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
get that blue fringing happening on the

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:37.580 
get that blue fringing happening on the
sides<00:03:36.060> element<00:03:36.510> there's<00:03:36.959> a<00:03:37.019> thing<00:03:37.170> almost

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
sides element there's a thing almost

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:38.870 
sides element there's a thing almost
nothing<00:03:37.769> you're<00:03:38.070> gonna<00:03:38.190> have<00:03:38.310> to<00:03:38.370> look<00:03:38.610> for<00:03:38.820> it

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
nothing you're gonna have to look for it

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.539 
nothing you're gonna have to look for it
off<00:03:39.030> to<00:03:39.209> while<00:03:39.470> Flay<00:03:40.470> I<00:03:40.500> shot<00:03:40.860> into<00:03:41.250> the<00:03:41.340> Sun

off to while Flay I shot into the Sun

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:43.310 
off to while Flay I shot into the Sun
part<00:03:41.790> often<00:03:42.090> looking<00:03:42.390> for<00:03:42.570> that<00:03:42.660> gold<00:03:42.900> morning

part often looking for that gold morning

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.320 
part often looking for that gold morning
light<00:03:43.500> silhouette<00:03:44.670> almost

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
light silhouette almost

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.170 
light silhouette almost
mirthfully<00:03:45.950> distortion<00:03:46.950> as<00:03:47.100> in<00:03:47.489> like<00:03:47.910> to<00:03:48.030> wide

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
mirthfully distortion as in like to wide

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.940 
mirthfully distortion as in like to wide
angle<00:03:48.209> there's<00:03:48.900> zero<00:03:49.140> distortion<00:03:49.500> on<00:03:49.799> this

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
angle there's zero distortion on this

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.420 
angle there's zero distortion on this
thing<00:03:50.130> and<00:03:50.870> what<00:03:51.870> else<00:03:52.110> heaviness<00:03:53.010> we<00:03:53.280> have

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
thing and what else heaviness we have

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.460 
thing and what else heaviness we have
spoken<00:03:53.640> about<00:03:53.850> 4.5<00:03:54.510> kilograms<00:03:54.989> is<00:03:55.140> not<00:03:55.290> that

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
spoken about 4.5 kilograms is not that

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.949 
spoken about 4.5 kilograms is not that
bad<00:03:55.709> considering<00:03:56.250> that<00:03:56.820> a<00:03:56.880> six<00:03:57.239> hundred<00:03:57.330> ways

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
bad considering that a six hundred ways

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:02.590 
bad considering that a six hundred ways
5.3<00:03:58.830> so<00:03:59.370> that<00:03:59.970> comparison<00:04:00.690> it's<00:04:00.870> a<00:04:00.989> no<00:04:01.140> brainer

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:02.600
