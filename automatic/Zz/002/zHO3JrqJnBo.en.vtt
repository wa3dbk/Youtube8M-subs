00:01:06.749 --> 00:01:06.759 
question that you need to ask yourself

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:09.270 
question that you need to ask yourself
you<00:01:06.940> know<00:01:07.060> is<00:01:07.390> is<00:01:08.020> it<00:01:08.080> sustainable

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
you've gotten from it and and so you

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.190 
you've gotten from it and and so you
know<00:01:24.640> I<00:01:24.940> would<00:01:25.240> think<00:01:25.450> at<00:01:25.780> least<00:01:25.899> for<00:01:26.080> me

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
know I would think at least for me

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.630 
know I would think at least for me
anyways<00:01:26.560> interment<00:01:26.920> of<00:01:26.950> fasting<00:01:27.310> would<00:01:27.459> not

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
anyways interment of fasting would not

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.510 
anyways interment of fasting would not
be<00:01:27.819> the<00:01:27.940> case<00:01:28.119> and<00:01:28.990> it's<00:01:29.560> not<00:01:29.740> required<00:01:30.009> you

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
be the case and it's not required you

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.070 
be the case and it's not required you
know<00:01:30.550> you<00:01:30.700> don't<00:01:30.849> have<00:01:31.119> to<00:01:31.390> you<00:01:31.599> know<00:01:31.720> before

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
know you don't have to you know before

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.779 
know you don't have to you know before
that<00:01:32.110> or<00:01:32.649> any<00:01:32.800> of<00:01:32.890> these<00:01:32.979> other<00:01:33.160> fad<00:01:33.369> diets

00:01:33.779 --> 00:01:33.789 
that or any of these other fad diets

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:34.949 
that or any of these other fad diets
came<00:01:33.970> along<00:01:34.240> there's<00:01:34.450> plenty<00:01:34.780> of<00:01:34.810> other

00:01:34.949 --> 00:01:34.959 
came along there's plenty of other

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:36.990 
came along there's plenty of other
people<00:01:35.259> still<00:01:35.560> in<00:01:35.709> shape<00:01:35.890> before<00:01:36.280> it<00:01:36.550> existed

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
people still in shape before it existed

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.419 
people still in shape before it existed
so<00:01:37.270> the<00:01:38.110> reason<00:01:38.470> that<00:01:38.500> you<00:01:38.800> know<00:01:39.069> you<00:01:39.280> may<00:01:39.399> not

00:01:39.419 --> 00:01:39.429 
so the reason that you know you may not

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:41.400 
so the reason that you know you may not
be<00:01:39.670> in<00:01:39.729> shape<00:01:39.940> is<00:01:40.060> not<00:01:40.270> because<00:01:40.660> you're<00:01:41.319> not

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:41.410 
be in shape is not because you're not

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:42.900 
be in shape is not because you're not
trying<00:01:41.619> intermittent<00:01:42.099> fasting<00:01:42.250> it's<00:01:42.640> because

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:42.910 
trying intermittent fasting it's because

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.150 
trying intermittent fasting it's because
something<00:01:43.179> in<00:01:43.539> the<00:01:43.989> core<00:01:44.200> process<00:01:44.739> in<00:01:45.009> your

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:45.160 
something in the core process in your

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.199

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
lot of guys to get I mean the bare

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.420 
lot of guys to get I mean the bare
minimum<00:03:06.330> would<00:03:06.510> be<00:03:06.570> six<00:03:07.020> but<00:03:07.800> you<00:03:07.950> really<00:03:08.250> want

those<00:03:08.550> two<00:03:08.730> extra<00:03:09.060> hours<00:03:09.090> because<00:03:09.450> that's

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
those two extra hours because that's

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:10.850 
those two extra hours because that's
when<00:03:09.840> your<00:03:09.959> body's<00:03:10.200> releasing<00:03:10.590> all<00:03:10.680> those

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
when your body's releasing all those

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.650 
when your body's releasing all those
hormones<00:03:11.280> and<00:03:11.610> rebuilding<00:03:12.120> the<00:03:12.209> muscle<00:03:12.570> and

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
hormones and rebuilding the muscle and

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.300

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
gonna see a lot of lag time in your

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.290 
gonna see a lot of lag time in your
gains<00:03:16.650> and<00:03:17.010> just<00:03:17.190> you<00:03:17.490> know<00:03:17.580> run<00:03:17.910> into<00:03:18.090> a<00:03:18.120> lot
