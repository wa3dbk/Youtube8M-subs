to this type of performance with the new

to this type of performance with the new
MacBook<00:05:12.800> Pro<00:05:13.100> we<00:05:13.910> set<00:05:14.270> out<00:05:14.479> to<00:05:15.200> design

00:05:15.339 --> 00:05:15.349 
MacBook Pro we set out to design

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:17.400 
MacBook Pro we set out to design
something<00:05:15.800> extreme

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:17.410 
something extreme

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:20.130 
something extreme
and<00:05:18.070> this<00:05:18.340> led<00:05:18.640> us<00:05:18.820> to<00:05:19.390> rethink<00:05:19.570> everything

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:20.140 
and this led us to rethink everything

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:22.860 
and this led us to rethink everything
about<00:05:20.950> our<00:05:21.160> process<00:05:21.700> everything<00:05:22.510> about

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:22.870 
about our process everything about

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:26.040 
about our process everything about
what's<00:05:23.080> essential<00:05:23.770> to<00:05:24.040> a<00:05:24.070> notebook

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.050 
what's essential to a notebook

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:28.439 
what's essential to a notebook
and<00:05:26.349> that<00:05:26.650> meant<00:05:26.949> that<00:05:27.340> we<00:05:27.729> could<00:05:27.910> design<00:05:28.060> the

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:28.449 
and that meant that we could design the

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:31.469 
and that meant that we could design the
very<00:05:28.810> best<00:05:29.139> computer<00:05:29.710> for<00:05:29.889> today<00:05:30.190> and<00:05:30.580> for<00:05:30.610> the

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:31.479 
very best computer for today and for the

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:33.930 
very best computer for today and for the
future
