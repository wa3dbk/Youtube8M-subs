00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:03.720
 hello killings tears 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.670
 he finds today the program w3 102 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.619
 so that I received in prototype 

00:00:11.619 --> 00:00:13.879
 who is this tiny phone 

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:18.189
 when I say small it's up to these little ones anyway you have to keep for example 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:20.749
 manificat and crystalline 

00:00:20.749 --> 00:00:23.519
 So here is a very nice story 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.439
 1 the 71 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.149
 % 

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:28.470
 a small effort 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:29.369
 So here is 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.250
 percent and what to say on this phone above all it's a phone that serves 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:34.380
 step 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.690
 call yes bravo 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.550
 you do not know what a phone call is and which is also used to 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.960
 listen to some music eventually 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.660
 and I want to say that's it 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.460
 finally there is peace m 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.390
 who is 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.670
 but that's all it's a phone that is above all compact solid besides 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.610
 so the first thing on leave in the orchard was 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.239
 I hallucinated when I did not see the movie and it's too 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:58.940
 beautiful while being super simple 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.170
 % and I still find it so it has rounded outlines it is 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.000
 very compact very very hungry 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.280
 very small super light 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.750
 and super strong and that's really there these kinds of phone that I 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.370
 will take that I would take if I wanted to leave 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:14.520
 at the mountain 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.540
 finally he is not waterproof but even 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.290
 I do not know if I find it really nice to do 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.200
 kind of small phone cutoff missed grandparents can be amply 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.200
 even if he is still a bit small 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.990
 finally he is he is cute like everything 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.470
 he is solid 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.010
 then if not the level here 2 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:32.190
 buttons 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.050
 % and what do we have a name that we will do a little tour first on the 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.030
 shows I'm going to do that in order but it's going to go very quickly a 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.190
 phone that is not too old here so it's not even we'll say 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.030
 good he has a few times a year ago to pay but he lives the music but it's 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.640
 not really a smartphone it's a penn and phonic sean 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.450
 these few little things and that's it 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.150
 so who's just hedges 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.070
 that does not mean that you can not surf the internet but you can 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:55.220
 will be a little slower 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.210
 percent of the 2 megapixel pn even without autofocus it's a boom of the 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.550
 walkman series 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.360
 percent and at the end you have the complainant othman 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.370
 that a little particular but finally who is nice 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.960
 internal memory attention drums drums of wine the words 

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:14.739
 so it does not do much and you can fill with the beginning of 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:17.839
 2000s what was said gates that not huge either 

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:20.839
 but abigail music if you are not 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:24.680
 if you do not count on the phone to listen to the most 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.689
 disks to traffic 

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:30.179
 an autonomy announced of 7 hours in communication of 12 days in standby 

00:02:30.179 --> 00:02:32.419
 hulk a pretty good autonomy 

00:02:32.419 --> 00:02:36.459
 so the price is a little strong point of this naked phone there is 130 euros this 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:39.229
 which is not huge and risks in addition to lowering there are chances 

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:42.199
 and you can find it at 1 euro with subscription 

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:45.539
 so that's really it is part of the phones to 1 euro for the loan 

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:46.459
 with cabot 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:49.939
 % who also makes camera p music player 

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:53.289
 so you have to work 

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:55.599
 but here in its black version 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:59.889
 So here it is that is if this type of buttons found a lot at sony with 

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:02.239
 his friends if the little buttons 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:03.600
 very nice and very solid 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.239
 the use is perfect 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:09.909
 % and here the button in France the volume joundallah for peace n 

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:14.559
 and then there a quick director access 

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:17.369
 in the program 

00:03:17.369 --> 00:03:20.699
 the internet portal 

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:23.489
 and on the other side here is here to leiria the camera 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.859
 Dominguez pixels 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:27.539
 without flash m 

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:30.539
 then the cci so long absent 

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:32.479
 pocket we are going to light it 

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:35.479
 and we'll have a quick tour of the phone 

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:40.659
 which in the end the strong points are clearly this is the solidity and 

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:42.339
 its price is good 

00:03:42.339 --> 00:03:43.999
 then leaving the place 

00:03:43.999 --> 00:03:46.999
 by looking a bit on the internet I saw some 

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:51.720
 % on stephanie who say that that sound 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.270
 % and as we do not want anymore we call for example bad enough 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:58.240
 I do not know I tested 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.149
 I called% and I passed 

00:04:00.149 --> 00:04:03.129
 a quarter of an hour telephone with edf with this phone 

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:06.859
 it seemed to go so now I can not promise you that it's 

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:11.189
 bullshit what they say but for a hundred here's me I tested it had 

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:14.189
 look like you go to him then 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:16.249
 You want to do 

00:04:16.249 --> 00:04:19.709
 so you have its very simple interface and besides these areas 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.289
 it's back a little step back even when you see there 

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:24.529
 with its interfaces like this 

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:28.669
 but we still lasted an hour and and internet but hey that's the duel 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:31.759
 So it's not there in the oise where you still have very painful 

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:33.039
 which is pretty cool 

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:36.039
 and this is here 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.020
 she is we are going to spend on Europe 1 after mail so great classic 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.330
 take a picture quickly 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.330
 so you've seen it starts anyway quickly 

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:50.710
 his camera rather fast 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.710
 2 megapixels so do not ask too much anyway 

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:57.569
 so not afraid with evil 

00:04:57.569 --> 00:04:59.289
 on the music 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:02.289
 yes we still have the file manager so it's even a gallery 

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:06.759
 media like and on others this is an excellent smartphone it's really 

00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:09.719
 the file manager a little bit old school 

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:11.580
 which is not super convenient n 10 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:15.550
 fake admit it per cent - you like radio too but that's with the 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:17.319
 hands-free kit then in the skull 

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:18.820
 you can access 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:20.690
 not going to the skin by throwing 

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:24.260
 from here notes the second time so I can follow the beloved it's still 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:25.930
 relatively fast 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:29.419
 its colors 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:32.139
 followed in charleroi 

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:35.139
 I am a researcher 

00:05:37.819 --> 00:05:41.319
 it's the same it's not exceptional but at the same time on a small phone 

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:45.809
 his 11 asks if we will start as we can that leaves and goes back their power 

00:05:45.809 --> 00:05:47.229
 quite complicated 

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:50.229
 so we did not stand there yesterday 

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:53.919
 if I go to my music here in front 

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:57.529
 asia indeed quite classic the artist will accept 

00:05:57.529 --> 00:06:00.879
 be fair 

00:06:00.879 --> 00:06:02.689
 and percent 

00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:05.339
 therefore not in the end 100 m 

00:06:05.339 --> 00:06:08.399
 there is not much to say on this phone except that here so 

00:06:08.399 --> 00:06:09.139
 5 

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:12.139
 it's a phone to the general public for people who want a phone 

00:06:12.689 --> 00:06:17.179
 which is not too fragile% and that is compact pettiti take no beach 

00:06:17.179 --> 00:06:18.389
 who do not take the lead 

00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:21.340
 it looks very easy and easy to use a word moissac had enough 

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:22.599
 used but still 

00:06:22.599 --> 00:06:24.719
 taking a step back I feel like it's a bit like 

00:06:24.719 --> 00:06:26.229
 rather easy to use 

00:06:26.229 --> 00:06:29.030
 for 100 m he has functions at the club 

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:31.349
 which is not nothing 

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:32.639
 it's nice enough 

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:34.620
 % and it's true that it's not either 

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:37.139
 super evolve you have not a lot of memory but 

00:06:37.139 --> 00:06:38.469
 it remains correct 

00:06:38.469 --> 00:06:39.979
 fast pnp 

00:06:39.979 --> 00:06:42.979
 even if the quality is not top it remains for the souvenir photos 

00:06:44.449 --> 00:06:46.469
 what can i say more 

00:06:46.469 --> 00:06:49.409
 it's just about all that it's a phone that's not very expensive 

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:52.629
 percent and that you can have for 1 euro with subscriptions so the time 

00:06:52.629 --> 00:06:53.860
 my opinion here it is 

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:57.449
 so if you do not feel like you if you have a big smartphone type 

00:06:57.449 --> 00:07:00.680
 blackberry this stop you naughty pals phone just rings 

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:01.779
 and faded 

00:07:01.779 --> 00:07:04.589
 who do not take the lead and who take especially no place 

00:07:04.589 --> 00:07:06.229
 you can take this stuff 

00:07:06.229 --> 00:07:09.509
 for this group though if you're not interested in that 

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:13.919
 % and all that is 3g will ecceterra a phone that does at the same time 

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:18.200
 the coffee is for and who was not looking for a bargain it's a good phone 

00:07:18.949 --> 00:07:19.840
 So here is 

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:20.280
 see you soon
