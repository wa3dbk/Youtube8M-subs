00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
riding like a real short board he didn't

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.609 
riding like a real short board he didn't
want<00:00:26.880> to<00:00:26.939> give<00:00:27.060> up<00:00:27.210> wave<00:00:27.390> count<00:00:27.689> he<00:00:28.380> didn't

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
want to give up wave count he didn't

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.800 
want to give up wave count he didn't
want<00:00:28.769> to<00:00:28.859> give<00:00:28.980> up<00:00:29.160> just<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.939> fudge<00:00:30.210> factor<00:00:30.240> of

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
want to give up just the fudge factor of

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.269 
want to give up just the fudge factor of
like<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.080> forgiveness<00:00:31.470> of<00:00:31.800> a<00:00:31.859> board<00:00:32.099> like

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
like the forgiveness of a board like

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.700 
like the forgiveness of a board like
that<00:00:32.309> so<00:00:32.759> this<00:00:33.420> board<00:00:33.780> actually<00:00:34.020> with<00:00:34.380> as<00:00:34.500> much

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
that so this board actually with as much

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.090 
that so this board actually with as much
success<00:00:34.950> as<00:00:35.160> it's<00:00:35.460> had<00:00:35.610> on<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.880> Pro<00:00:36.300> Tour<00:00:37.110> this

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
success as it's had on the Pro Tour this

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.830 
success as it's had on the Pro Tour this
this<00:00:38.489> summer<00:00:38.760> which<00:00:39.059> basically<00:00:39.450> every

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
this summer which basically every

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.470 
this summer which basically every
contest<00:00:40.379> in<00:00:40.559> California<00:00:41.129> was<00:00:41.280> won<00:00:41.520> on<00:00:41.700> a<00:00:42.180> lot

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
contest in California was won on a lot

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.810 
contest in California was won on a lot
of<00:00:42.510> speed<00:00:42.719> to<00:00:42.750> short<00:00:43.050> board<00:00:43.260> this<00:00:43.410> summer<00:00:43.820> it

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
of speed to short board this summer it

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.299 
of speed to short board this summer it
was<00:00:45.239> actually<00:00:45.570> derived<00:00:45.960> from<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.860> not<00:00:47.129> the

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
was actually derived from the not the

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.729 
was actually derived from the not the
bro<00:00:47.489> side<00:00:47.730> but<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.149> not<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.870> pro<00:00:49.170> side<00:00:49.469> but

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
bro side but the not the pro side but

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.380 
bro side but the not the pro side but
the<00:00:49.860> bro<00:00:50.160> side<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:50.730> Matt<00:00:50.879> wanted<00:00:51.120> to<00:00:51.239> make<00:00:51.360> a

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
the bro side and Matt wanted to make a

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.709 
the bro side and Matt wanted to make a
board<00:00:51.660> for<00:00:51.780> himself<00:00:52.170> so<00:00:52.260> he<00:00:52.890> took<00:00:53.129> his

00:00:53.709 --> 00:00:53.719 
board for himself so he took his

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:56.270 
board for himself so he took his
favorite<00:00:54.719> hybrid<00:00:55.079> which<00:00:55.260> was<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.590> rocket<00:00:55.980> v2

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
favorite hybrid which was the rocket v2

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.500 
favorite hybrid which was the rocket v2
rocket<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:57.170> extended<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.350> nose<00:00:58.559> out<00:00:58.829> line<00:00:59.670> a

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
rocket and extended the nose out line a

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.290 
rocket and extended the nose out line a
little<00:01:01.320> bit<00:01:01.410> further<00:01:01.739> forward<00:01:02.039> to<00:01:02.850> come<00:01:03.059> to

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
little bit further forward to come to

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.729 
little bit further forward to come to
more<00:01:03.480> of<00:01:03.570> a<00:01:03.629> pointy<00:01:03.989> nose<00:01:04.019> rather<00:01:04.439> than<00:01:04.710> a

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
more of a pointy nose rather than a

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.280 
more of a pointy nose rather than a
bullet<00:01:05.040> nose<00:01:05.309> like<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.729> rocket<00:01:06.180> and<00:01:07.080> then<00:01:07.200> he

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
bullet nose like the rocket and then he

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.399 
bullet nose like the rocket and then he
also<00:01:07.500> took<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:08.400> tail<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:09.170> rather<00:01:10.170> than

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
also took the tail and rather than

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.340 
also took the tail and rather than
having<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.860> tail<00:01:11.070> end<00:01:11.310> about<00:01:11.610> right<00:01:11.850> here

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
having the tail end about right here

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.320 
having the tail end about right here
drew<00:01:13.350> it<00:01:13.530> into<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:13.950> more<00:01:14.280> conservative<00:01:14.760> squash

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
drew it into a more conservative squash

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.810 
drew it into a more conservative squash
but<00:01:16.200> basically<00:01:16.470> just<00:01:16.590> taking<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.159> rocket

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
but basically just taking the rocket

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.880 
but basically just taking the rocket
midsection<00:01:18.509> bringing<00:01:18.990> it<00:01:19.110> out<00:01:19.229> a<00:01:19.259> little<00:01:19.470> bit

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
midsection bringing it out a little bit

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.920 
midsection bringing it out a little bit
and<00:01:19.979> bringing<00:01:20.580> it<00:01:20.820> forward<00:01:21.150> a<00:01:21.330> little<00:01:21.509> bit<00:01:21.630> and

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
and bringing it forward a little bit and

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.960 
and bringing it forward a little bit and
then<00:01:22.080> adding<00:01:22.409> a<00:01:22.500> little<00:01:22.950> bit<00:01:23.220> of<00:01:23.340> extra<00:01:23.610> rocker

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
then adding a little bit of extra rocker

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.380 
then adding a little bit of extra rocker
up<00:01:24.409> front<00:01:25.409> right<00:01:25.860> here<00:01:25.890> but<00:01:26.820> still<00:01:27.060> keeping

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
up front right here but still keeping

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.840 
up front right here but still keeping
the<00:01:27.479> rocker<00:01:27.689> flat<00:01:28.140> through<00:01:28.829> here<00:01:29.100> a<00:01:29.250> lot<00:01:29.759> of

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
the rocker flat through here a lot of

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.910 
the rocker flat through here a lot of
the<00:01:29.909> foil<00:01:30.270> in<00:01:30.540> this<00:01:30.689> board<00:01:30.990> is<00:01:31.170> exactly<00:01:31.799> the

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
the foil in this board is exactly the

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.069 
the foil in this board is exactly the
same<00:01:32.159> as<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:33.000> rocket<00:01:33.420> so<00:01:33.570> it<00:01:33.689> does<00:01:33.869> have

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
same as the rocket so it does have

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.469 
same as the rocket so it does have
especially<00:01:34.890> on<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.280> domesticated<00:01:36.060> DIMMs

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
especially on the domesticated DIMMs

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:37.460 
especially on the domesticated DIMMs
which<00:01:36.689> we're<00:01:36.810> going<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:36.990> get<00:01:37.079> a<00:01:37.140> little<00:01:37.320> bit

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
which we're going to get a little bit

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.440 
which we're going to get a little bit
later<00:01:37.650> on<00:01:37.860> this<00:01:38.430> board<00:01:38.700> in<00:01:38.820> general<00:01:39.180> both<00:01:39.329> the

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
later on this board in general both the

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.179 
later on this board in general both the
pro<00:01:39.630> dims<00:01:39.869> on<00:01:40.079> that<00:01:40.229> and<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.530> domesticated

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
pro dims on that and the domesticated

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.800 
pro dims on that and the domesticated
ends<00:01:41.369> have<00:01:41.520> a<00:01:41.579> little<00:01:41.880> bit<00:01:42.000> fuller<00:01:42.180> rail<00:01:42.540> and

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
ends have a little bit fuller rail and

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.319 
ends have a little bit fuller rail and
the<00:01:43.290> foil<00:01:43.560> is<00:01:43.799> very<00:01:44.159> similar<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:44.640> a<00:01:44.759> rocket<00:01:45.210> so

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
the foil is very similar to a rocket so

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.600 
the foil is very similar to a rocket so
if<00:01:45.390> you've<00:01:45.479> ever<00:01:45.630> written<00:01:45.869> a<00:01:46.079> v2<00:01:47.009> rocket<00:01:47.430> or<00:01:47.579> a

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
if you've ever written a v2 rocket or a

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.490 
if you've ever written a v2 rocket or a
v3<00:01:47.880> rocket<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:48.689> you<00:01:48.750> like<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.110> way<00:01:49.200> that<00:01:49.350> that

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
v3 rocket and you like the way that that

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.200 
v3 rocket and you like the way that that
board<00:01:49.740> feels<00:01:50.070> you're<00:01:50.670> definitely<00:01:50.909> going<00:01:51.149> to

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
board feels you're definitely going to

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.460 
board feels you're definitely going to
like<00:01:51.360> this<00:01:51.540> board<00:01:51.780> as<00:01:51.869> well<00:01:51.960> you<00:01:52.110> want<00:01:52.259> to<00:01:52.320> ride

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
like this board as well you want to ride

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:53.719 
like this board as well you want to ride
it<00:01:52.560> a<00:01:52.649> little<00:01:52.829> bit<00:01:52.920> bigger<00:01:53.130> obviously<00:01:53.340> because

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
it a little bit bigger obviously because

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:54.920 
it a little bit bigger obviously because
you<00:01:53.820> got<00:01:53.939> to<00:01:54.030> draw<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.270> nose<00:01:54.509> in<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.750> tail

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
you got to draw the nose in the tail

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.740 
you got to draw the nose in the tail
output<00:01:55.380> it's<00:01:55.860> got<00:01:56.070> a<00:01:56.100> very<00:01:56.750> confident

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
output it's got a very confident

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.260 
output it's got a very confident
positive<00:01:58.439> feel<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:59.009> works<00:01:59.549> in<00:01:59.729> in<00:02:00.030> a<00:02:00.119> variety

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
positive feel and works in in a variety

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.109 
positive feel and works in in a variety
of<00:02:00.600> waves<00:02:00.920> as<00:02:01.920> far<00:02:02.219> as<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.430> rocker<00:02:02.670> on<00:02:02.939> this

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
of waves as far as the rocker on this

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.870 
of waves as far as the rocker on this
board<00:02:03.390> it<00:02:03.630> is<00:02:03.740> flatter<00:02:04.740> up<00:02:05.100> front<00:02:05.430> and<00:02:05.670> then

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
board it is flatter up front and then

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.330 
board it is flatter up front and then
accelerated<00:02:06.659> out<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:07.020> tail<00:02:07.229> so<00:02:07.950> it<00:02:08.099> is<00:02:08.220> going

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
accelerated out the tail so it is going

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.430 
accelerated out the tail so it is going
to<00:02:08.399> paddle<00:02:08.819> really<00:02:09.060> well<00:02:09.390> glide<00:02:09.929> into<00:02:10.259> waves

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
to paddle really well glide into waves

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.380 
to paddle really well glide into waves
really<00:02:10.860> well<00:02:11.009> glide<00:02:11.280> across<00:02:11.400> flat<00:02:11.879> sections

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
really well glide across flat sections

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.030 
really well glide across flat sections
really<00:02:12.690> well

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
really well

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.100 
really well
but<00:02:13.189> when<00:02:13.340> you<00:02:13.430> need<00:02:13.640> it<00:02:13.819> to<00:02:13.939> turn<00:02:14.180> you<00:02:14.930> just

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
but when you need it to turn you just

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:16.539 
but when you need it to turn you just
hammer<00:02:15.349> on<00:02:15.590> the<00:02:15.709> back<00:02:15.860> foot<00:02:16.159> it's<00:02:16.370> going<00:02:16.400> to

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:16.549 
hammer on the back foot it's going to

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:18.399 
hammer on the back foot it's going to
come<00:02:16.700> around<00:02:16.849> really<00:02:17.359> tight

00:02:18.399 --> 00:02:18.409 
come around really tight

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:20.050 
come around really tight
another<00:02:19.010> thing<00:02:19.219> that<00:02:19.370> Matt's<00:02:19.549> doing<00:02:19.849> on<00:02:19.969> these

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
another thing that Matt's doing on these

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.280 
another thing that Matt's doing on these
boards<00:02:20.359> is<00:02:21.250> having<00:02:22.250> that<00:02:22.969> built-in<00:02:23.510> lock<00:02:23.959> on

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
boards is having that built-in lock on

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:25.479 
boards is having that built-in lock on
the<00:02:24.409> tail<00:02:24.620> you're<00:02:24.859> going<00:02:24.980> to<00:02:25.040> see<00:02:25.219> that<00:02:25.400> the

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
the tail you're going to see that the

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:27.220 
the tail you're going to see that the
tails<00:02:25.700> got<00:02:25.909> a<00:02:25.969> lot<00:02:26.150> of<00:02:26.180> dome<00:02:26.480> right<00:02:26.780> here<00:02:27.049> and

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
tails got a lot of dome right here and

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.259 
tails got a lot of dome right here and
the<00:02:27.769> stringers<00:02:28.189> raised<00:02:28.549> up<00:02:28.819> and<00:02:29.000> so<00:02:29.150> that's

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:29.269 
the stringers raised up and so that's

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:31.330 
the stringers raised up and so that's
when<00:02:29.569> you're<00:02:29.720> pushing<00:02:29.989> on<00:02:30.290> it<00:02:30.319> your<00:02:30.950> foot<00:02:31.189> is

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
when you're pushing on it your foot is

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:32.949 
when you're pushing on it your foot is
naturally<00:02:31.819> it's<00:02:32.120> like<00:02:32.359> you've<00:02:32.540> been<00:02:32.569> riding

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
naturally it's like you've been riding

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:34.479 
naturally it's like you've been riding
the<00:02:33.019> board<00:02:33.140> forever<00:02:33.439> like<00:02:33.680> it's<00:02:33.829> like<00:02:34.040> sunk<00:02:34.340> in

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:34.489 
the board forever like it's like sunk in

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:35.800 
the board forever like it's like sunk in
the<00:02:34.579> deck<00:02:34.760> end<00:02:34.970> like<00:02:35.180> when<00:02:35.329> you<00:02:35.420> cave<00:02:35.629> your

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
the deck end like when you cave your

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:36.910 
the deck end like when you cave your
boards<00:02:36.019> in<00:02:36.170> you're<00:02:36.319> like<00:02:36.470> oh<00:02:36.560> this<00:02:36.709> thing

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
boards in you're like oh this thing

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.080 
boards in you're like oh this thing
feels<00:02:37.099> great<00:02:37.370> and<00:02:37.519> then<00:02:37.640> the<00:02:37.730> board's<00:02:37.939> just

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
feels great and then the board's just

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.030 
feels great and then the board's just
about<00:02:38.239> to<00:02:38.390> break<00:02:38.629> he<00:02:39.200> actually<00:02:39.379> shapes<00:02:39.829> the

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
about to break he actually shapes the

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.729 
about to break he actually shapes the
boards<00:02:40.280> in<00:02:40.430> that<00:02:40.670> way<00:02:40.849> so<00:02:41.450> it's<00:02:41.629> called<00:02:41.870> having

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 
boards in that way so it's called having

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:45.670 
boards in that way so it's called having
the<00:02:42.980> having<00:02:43.579> that<00:02:43.760> raised<00:02:44.750> center<00:02:45.049> line<00:02:45.379> so

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
the having that raised center line so

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.110 
the having that raised center line so
your<00:02:45.829> foot<00:02:46.040> just<00:02:46.280> sits<00:02:46.549> there<00:02:46.639> like<00:02:46.879> it's<00:02:47.030> a

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
your foot just sits there like it's a

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.429 
your foot just sits there like it's a
ramp<00:02:47.329> so<00:02:47.420> it's<00:02:47.599> not<00:02:47.750> going<00:02:47.900> to<00:02:47.959> try<00:02:48.079> and<00:02:48.109> slide

00:02:48.429 --> 00:02:48.439 
ramp so it's not going to try and slide

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:49.690 
ramp so it's not going to try and slide
off<00:02:48.620> the<00:02:48.650> board<00:02:48.950> a<00:02:49.010> lot<00:02:49.159> of<00:02:49.280> people<00:02:49.489> are<00:02:49.549> riding

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
off the board a lot of people are riding

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.280 
off the board a lot of people are riding
with<00:02:49.939> that<00:02:49.970> wax<00:02:50.329> or<00:02:50.659> if<00:02:50.780> you're<00:02:50.900> riding<00:02:51.139> with<00:02:51.169> a

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
with that wax or if you're riding with a

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:52.839 
with that wax or if you're riding with a
tail<00:02:51.530> Pat<00:02:51.739> it'll<00:02:51.950> actually<00:02:52.250> curve<00:02:52.459> the<00:02:52.639> tail

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:52.849 
tail Pat it'll actually curve the tail

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:54.879 
tail Pat it'll actually curve the tail
pad<00:02:53.090> so<00:02:53.599> just<00:02:53.780> gives<00:02:53.930> you<00:02:54.049> more<00:02:54.200> leverage<00:02:54.709> on

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:54.889 
pad so just gives you more leverage on

00:02:54.889 --> 00:02:57.990 
pad so just gives you more leverage on
turning<00:02:55.370> the<00:02:55.459> board<00:02:56.049> they're<00:02:57.049> using<00:02:57.409> a

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
turning the board they're using a

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.270 
turning the board they're using a
carbonless<00:02:59.169> carbon<00:03:00.169> on<00:03:00.349> the<00:03:00.409> tail<00:03:00.829> so<00:03:01.069> it's<00:03:01.220> a

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
carbonless carbon on the tail so it's a

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.500 
carbonless carbon on the tail so it's a
reinforced<00:03:01.970> fiberglass<00:03:03.489> tail<00:03:04.510> reinforcement

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
reinforced fiberglass tail reinforcement

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:06.550 
reinforced fiberglass tail reinforcement
you're<00:03:05.629> going<00:03:05.750> to<00:03:05.810> start<00:03:05.959> to<00:03:06.049> see<00:03:06.079> these<00:03:06.260> white

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
you're going to start to see these white

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.490 
you're going to start to see these white
fibers<00:03:07.040> now<00:03:07.250> these<00:03:07.730> are<00:03:08.120> directional<00:03:09.049> fibers

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
fibers now these are directional fibers

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.830 
fibers now these are directional fibers
very<00:03:09.709> very<00:03:10.069> strong<00:03:10.459> on<00:03:10.790> no<00:03:11.180> carpet<00:03:11.629> in<00:03:11.720> them

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
very very strong on no carpet in them

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.300 
very very strong on no carpet in them
but<00:03:11.959> doing<00:03:12.230> the<00:03:12.319> same<00:03:12.500> thing<00:03:12.680> that<00:03:12.799> the<00:03:12.950> carbon

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
but doing the same thing that the carbon

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.940 
but doing the same thing that the carbon
was<00:03:13.489> doing<00:03:13.849> and<00:03:14.810> they're<00:03:15.169> they're<00:03:15.560> all<00:03:15.680> white

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
was doing and they're they're all white

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:17.110 
was doing and they're they're all white
now<00:03:16.129> it's<00:03:16.340> like<00:03:16.489> which<00:03:16.669> looks<00:03:16.970> actually

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
now it's like which looks actually

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.080 
now it's like which looks actually
really<00:03:17.299> cool<00:03:17.690> against<00:03:18.169> some<00:03:18.769> of<00:03:18.799> the<00:03:19.129> dips<00:03:19.849> and

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
really cool against some of the dips and

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:21.909 
really cool against some of the dips and
then<00:03:20.180> also<00:03:20.359> even<00:03:20.479> on<00:03:20.750> a<00:03:20.780> clear<00:03:21.049> white<00:03:21.680> board

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:21.919 
then also even on a clear white board

00:03:21.919 --> 00:03:24.069 
then also even on a clear white board
looks<00:03:22.129> real<00:03:22.340> trick<00:03:22.579> this<00:03:22.760> year<00:03:23.000> just<00:03:23.629> a<00:03:23.810> great

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:24.079 
looks real trick this year just a great

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:26.319 
looks real trick this year just a great
all-around<00:03:24.349> board<00:03:24.889> and<00:03:25.250> right<00:03:25.940> now<00:03:26.090> it's

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:26.329 
all-around board and right now it's

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:27.909 
all-around board and right now it's
their<00:03:26.510> most<00:03:26.690> popular<00:03:26.930> short<00:03:27.440> board<00:03:27.680> and

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:27.919 
their most popular short board and

00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:29.500 
their most popular short board and
available<00:03:28.400> in<00:03:28.489> two<00:03:28.639> different<00:03:28.669> dimensions<00:03:29.060> so

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
available in two different dimensions so

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.659 
available in two different dimensions so
let's<00:03:29.690> cover<00:03:29.840> that<00:03:30.079> now<00:03:30.290> if<00:03:31.220> you're<00:03:31.370> looking

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:31.669 
let's cover that now if you're looking

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:35.430 
let's cover that now if you're looking
at<00:03:31.819> the<00:03:32.030> Julian<00:03:32.540> Wilson's<00:03:33.019> the<00:03:33.290> Taj<00:03:33.919> burrows

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
at the Julian Wilson's the Taj burrows

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.710 
at the Julian Wilson's the Taj burrows
the<00:03:36.440> Mason<00:03:36.889> hoes<00:03:37.069> obviously<00:03:37.699> they're<00:03:37.909> on<00:03:38.090> the

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
the Mason hoes obviously they're on the

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.629 
the Mason hoes obviously they're on the
pro<00:03:39.049> dimensions<00:03:39.889> and<00:03:40.129> those<00:03:40.250> boards<00:03:40.549> are

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:40.639 
pro dimensions and those boards are

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:44.110 
pro dimensions and those boards are
going<00:03:40.729> to<00:03:40.819> be<00:03:40.970> narrower<00:03:41.810> and<00:03:42.049> thinner<00:03:42.609> and<00:03:43.609> all

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
going to be narrower and thinner and all

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.520 
going to be narrower and thinner and all
the<00:03:44.269> way<00:03:44.389> up<00:03:44.510> through<00:03:44.780> and<00:03:44.959> they're<00:03:45.319> going<00:03:45.470> to

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
the way up through and they're going to

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:46.930 
the way up through and they're going to
run<00:03:45.650> those<00:03:45.829> boards<00:03:46.220> you<00:03:46.310> know<00:03:46.430> from<00:03:46.669> the<00:03:46.760> mid

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
run those boards you know from the mid

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.869 
run those boards you know from the mid
fives<00:03:47.209> up<00:03:47.930> through<00:03:48.260> about<00:03:48.409> six<00:03:48.769> for<00:03:49.099> in<00:03:49.310> pro

00:03:49.869 --> 00:03:49.879 
fives up through about six for in pro

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:52.439 
fives up through about six for in pro
dimensions<00:03:50.419> there's<00:03:51.229> also<00:03:51.470> a<00:03:51.620> new<00:03:51.919> line<00:03:52.190> of

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:52.449 
dimensions there's also a new line of

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:55.330 
dimensions there's also a new line of
domesticated<00:03:53.449> dimensions<00:03:53.989> and<00:03:54.169> those<00:03:54.889> boards

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
domesticated dimensions and those boards

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.640 
domesticated dimensions and those boards
are<00:03:55.519> wider<00:03:56.030> and<00:03:56.389> thicker<00:03:56.900> part<00:03:57.470> of<00:03:57.530> their

are wider and thicker part of their
length<00:03:57.949> and<00:03:58.220> that's<00:03:58.639> going<00:03:58.879> to<00:03:58.939> be<00:03:59.030> good<00:03:59.709> for<00:04:00.709> a

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:00.769 
length and that's going to be good for a

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:02.710 
length and that's going to be good for a
bunch<00:04:01.040> of<00:04:01.189> different<00:04:01.459> reasons<00:04:01.579> one<00:04:02.060> is<00:04:02.389> that

bunch of different reasons one is that

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.500 
bunch of different reasons one is that
if<00:04:02.989> you<00:04:03.229> find<00:04:03.530> that<00:04:03.819> you<00:04:04.819> come<00:04:05.030> up<00:04:05.150> against<00:04:05.419> the

if you find that you come up against the
ceiling<00:04:05.900> of<00:04:05.989> which<00:04:06.109> like<00:04:06.290> hey<00:04:06.409> I<00:04:06.439> don't<00:04:06.560> like

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:06.799 
ceiling of which like hey I don't like

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:08.259 
ceiling of which like hey I don't like
riding<00:04:07.159> a<00:04:07.220> board<00:04:07.370> longer<00:04:07.699> than<00:04:07.849> six<00:04:08.090> oak

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:08.269 
riding a board longer than six oak

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:09.699 
riding a board longer than six oak

faster<00:04:51.200> allow<00:04:51.980> you<00:04:52.040> to<00:04:52.370> drop<00:04:52.670> a<00:04:53.000> link<00:04:53.600> in<00:04:53.840> two

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:53.990 
faster allow you to drop a link in two

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.290 
faster allow you to drop a link in two
ways<00:04:54.170> both<00:04:54.830> from<00:04:55.100> the<00:04:55.220> nose<00:04:55.400> rocker<00:04:55.760> and<00:04:56.120> then

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
ways both from the nose rocker and then

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.660 
ways both from the nose rocker and then
also<00:04:56.510> the<00:04:56.990> reduced<00:04:57.860> width<00:04:58.100> of<00:04:58.250> the<00:04:58.340> nose<00:04:58.460> not

00:04:58.660 --> 00:04:58.670 
also the reduced width of the nose not

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:00.340 
also the reduced width of the nose not
hanging<00:04:59.090> up<00:04:59.240> and<00:04:59.420> cartwheeling<00:04:59.870> you<00:05:00.080> over<00:05:00.260> the

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:00.350 
hanging up and cartwheeling you over the

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:02.740 
hanging up and cartwheeling you over the
front<00:05:00.590> on<00:05:01.460> the<00:05:01.520> water<00:05:01.820> boards<00:05:02.210> and<00:05:02.390> then<00:05:02.570> also

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:02.750 
front on the water boards and then also

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:04.750 
front on the water boards and then also
the<00:05:02.990> faster<00:05:03.380> rail-to-rail<00:05:03.590> of<00:05:04.370> something

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:04.760 
the faster rail-to-rail of something

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.730 
the faster rail-to-rail of something
narrower<00:05:04.970> but<00:05:05.570> still<00:05:05.810> have<00:05:05.960> foam<00:05:06.260> in<00:05:06.530> the

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:06.740 
narrower but still have foam in the

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.200 
narrower but still have foam in the
board<00:05:06.950> still<00:05:07.220> being<00:05:07.460> able<00:05:07.580> to<00:05:07.730> catch<00:05:07.940> waves

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.210 
board still being able to catch waves

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.300 
board still being able to catch waves
and<00:05:08.600> still<00:05:09.170> having<00:05:09.440> some<00:05:09.650> glide<00:05:09.920> in<00:05:10.100> the<00:05:10.190> way

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:10.310 
and still having some glide in the way

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:13.390 
and still having some glide in the way
in<00:05:10.730> the<00:05:10.940> wave<00:05:11.090> that<00:05:11.810> a<00:05:11.870> zero<00:05:12.530> foam<00:05:12.830> board<00:05:13.160> would

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400 
in the wave that a zero foam board would

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.390 
in the wave that a zero foam board would
so<00:05:13.700> I<00:05:13.910> think<00:05:14.180> the<00:05:14.330> domesticated<00:05:15.340> version<00:05:16.340> is

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400 
so I think the domesticated version is

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:17.740 
so I think the domesticated version is
going<00:05:16.520> to<00:05:16.580> be<00:05:16.670> very<00:05:16.940> very<00:05:17.120> popular<00:05:17.360> as<00:05:17.630> well

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:17.750 
going to be very very popular as well

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.480 
going to be very very popular as well
one<00:05:18.050> again<00:05:18.500> as<00:05:18.620> a<00:05:18.650> cheater<00:05:18.920> to<00:05:19.100> be<00:05:19.160> able<00:05:19.220> to<00:05:19.340> get

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:19.490 
one again as a cheater to be able to get

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:21.100 
one again as a cheater to be able to get
shorter<00:05:19.850> boards<00:05:20.180> that<00:05:20.690> are<00:05:20.750> going<00:05:20.900> to<00:05:20.990> fit

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.110 
shorter boards that are going to fit

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:22.240 
shorter boards that are going to fit
into<00:05:21.230> the<00:05:21.380> way<00:05:21.500> better<00:05:21.740> for<00:05:21.830> something<00:05:22.160> that

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:22.250 
into the way better for something that

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:23.410 
into the way better for something that
might<00:05:22.400> need<00:05:22.520> a<00:05:22.580> little<00:05:22.700> bit<00:05:22.790> more<00:05:22.970> foam<00:05:23.210> and

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:23.420 
might need a little bit more foam and

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:26.230 
might need a little bit more foam and
then<00:05:23.510> also<00:05:23.690> for<00:05:24.440> the<00:05:24.530> bigger<00:05:24.740> guys<00:05:24.880> or<00:05:25.880> for

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 
then also for the bigger guys or for

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.250 
then also for the bigger guys or for
people<00:05:26.330> that<00:05:26.510> have<00:05:26.630> just<00:05:26.780> been<00:05:26.900> riding

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:27.260 
people that have just been riding

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:28.720 
people that have just been riding
hybrids<00:05:27.650> for<00:05:27.800> a<00:05:27.830> really<00:05:28.100> long<00:05:28.280> time<00:05:28.340> and

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:37.490 
domesticated ends in this board would be

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:39.870 
domesticated ends in this board would be
super<00:05:37.880> popular<00:05:38.120> for<00:05:38.540> that<00:05:38.570> so<00:05:38.960> it's<00:05:39.440> the<00:05:39.560> lost
