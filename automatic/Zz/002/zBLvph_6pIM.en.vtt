00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
initially is we have everything

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.539 
initially is we have everything
connected<00:01:13.290> right<00:01:13.470> but<00:01:14.010> we<00:01:14.159> have<00:01:14.310> enough

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
connected right but we have enough

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.249 
connected right but we have enough
television<00:01:14.880> tuned<00:01:15.330> in<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.840> pick<00:01:16.020> up<00:01:16.170> the

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
television tuned in to pick up the

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.530 
television tuned in to pick up the
channel<00:01:16.590> so<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.220> default<00:01:17.520> channel<00:01:17.850> output

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
channel so the default channel output

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.899 
channel so the default channel output
from<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.080> skyboxes<00:01:19.680> channel's<00:01:20.100> 68<00:01:20.580> which<00:01:20.820> is

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
from the skyboxes channel's 68 which is

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.609 
from the skyboxes channel's 68 which is
at<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.090> very<00:01:21.330> very<00:01:21.420> top<00:01:21.810> of<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.049> UHF<00:01:22.350> spectrum

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
at the very very top of the UHF spectrum

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.399 
at the very very top of the UHF spectrum
okay<00:01:23.310> so<00:01:24.060> I'm<00:01:24.240> doing<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.479> manual<00:01:24.659> tune<00:01:25.080> here<00:01:25.320> you

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
okay so I'm doing a manual tune here you

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:26.840 
okay so I'm doing a manual tune here you
could<00:01:25.530> do<00:01:25.590> an<00:01:25.680> opportune<00:01:26.250> which<00:01:26.640> it<00:01:26.759> would

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
could do an opportune which it would

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.179 
could do an opportune which it would
automatically<00:01:27.360> save<00:01:27.600> things<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:28.140> so<00:01:28.950> at<00:01:29.100> the

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
automatically save things and so at the

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.160 
automatically save things and so at the
very<00:01:29.220> top<00:01:29.460> we<00:01:29.790> can<00:01:29.880> see<00:01:30.090> we<00:01:30.810> have<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.020> same

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
very top we can see we have the same

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.870 
very top we can see we have the same
picture<00:01:31.500> here<00:01:31.530> is<00:01:31.799> over<00:01:32.040> there<00:01:32.189> so<00:01:32.579> I<00:01:32.610> make<00:01:32.850> a

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
picture here is over there so I make a

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.969 
picture here is over there so I make a
decision<00:01:33.299> then<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.630> arrow<00:01:33.990> down<00:01:34.229> a<00:01:34.500> lot

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
decision then the arrow down a lot

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.920 
decision then the arrow down a lot
across<00:01:35.430> and<00:01:35.700> store<00:01:35.970> it<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.270> that's<00:01:36.420> it<00:01:36.630> so

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
across and store it and that's it so

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.270 
across and store it and that's it so
we're<00:01:36.990> actually<00:01:37.170> save<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.680> output<00:01:37.710> from

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
we're actually save the output from

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.520 
we're actually save the output from
there<00:01:38.460> on<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:38.759> this<00:01:39.659> extra<00:01:40.020> channel<00:01:40.320> number

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
there on to this extra channel number

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.319 
there on to this extra channel number
tree<00:01:40.740> here<00:01:41.040> I'm<00:01:41.250> not<00:01:41.579> saving<00:01:41.880> to<00:01:42.090> run<00:01:42.210> my

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
tree here I'm not saving to run my

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.270 
tree here I'm not saving to run my
television<00:01:42.810> so<00:01:43.140> I've<00:01:43.229> got<00:01:43.380> channel<00:01:43.710> number<00:01:43.920> 6

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
television so I've got channel number 6

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.940 
television so I've got channel number 6
I<00:01:44.340> have<00:01:45.030> no<00:01:45.210> picture<00:01:45.600> but<00:01:46.200> if<00:01:46.290> I<00:01:46.380> hit<00:01:46.530> channel

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
I have no picture but if I hit channel

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.319 
I have no picture but if I hit channel
number<00:01:47.130> tree<00:01:47.369> which<00:01:47.880> is<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.149> one<00:01:48.299> that's

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
number tree which is the one that's

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.510 
number tree which is the one that's
tuned<00:01:48.630> in<00:01:48.810> from<00:01:48.960> here<00:01:49.170> I<00:01:49.350> have<00:01:49.680> that<00:01:49.890> one<00:01:50.040> okay

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
tuned in from here I have that one okay

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.460 
tuned in from here I have that one okay
so<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:51.149> next<00:01:51.299> thing<00:01:51.450> I'm<00:01:51.659> gonna<00:01:51.810> notice<00:01:52.259> here

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
so the next thing I'm gonna notice here

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.679 
so the next thing I'm gonna notice here
is<00:01:52.590> that<00:01:52.799> I<00:01:53.369> have<00:01:54.829> no<00:01:55.829> M<00:01:56.219> I<00:01:56.820> have<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.360> picture

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
is that I have no M I have the picture

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.560 
is that I have no M I have the picture
but<00:01:58.350> M<00:01:58.680> if<00:01:59.009> I<00:01:59.189> actually<00:01:59.490> aimed<00:01:59.850> remote<00:02:00.210> control

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
but M if I actually aimed remote control

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.179 
but M if I actually aimed remote control
here<00:02:00.750> and<00:02:00.810> try<00:02:01.140> to<00:02:01.200> change<00:02:01.439> channels<00:02:01.920> whatever

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
here and try to change channels whatever

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.130 
here and try to change channels whatever
it<00:02:02.490> won't<00:02:02.729> work<00:02:02.939> for<00:02:03.000> me<00:02:03.240> and<00:02:03.479> if<00:02:03.869> I<00:02:03.960> look

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
it won't work for me and if I look

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.889 
it won't work for me and if I look
closer<00:02:04.409> at<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.829> sky<00:02:05.009> I<00:02:05.040> then<00:02:05.460> I<00:02:05.700> find<00:02:06.600> out<00:02:06.780> that

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
closer at the sky I then I find out that

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.380 
closer at the sky I then I find out that
the<00:02:07.020> LED<00:02:07.409> light<00:02:07.649> is<00:02:07.680> on<00:02:07.979> so<00:02:08.459> let's<00:02:08.729> look<00:02:09.149> the

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
the LED light is on so let's look the

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.210 
the LED light is on so let's look the
scenarios<00:02:09.869> in<00:02:09.899> which<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.470> LED<00:02:10.770> light<00:02:11.009> will

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
scenarios in which the LED light will

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.140 
scenarios in which the LED light will
not<00:02:11.370> come<00:02:11.580> on<00:02:11.700> from

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
not come on from

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.860 
not come on from
the<00:02:12.420> first<00:02:12.690> scenario<00:02:12.870> would<00:02:13.410> be<00:02:14.569> if<00:02:15.569> we<00:02:15.720> go

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
the first scenario would be if we go

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.330 
the first scenario would be if we go
back<00:02:16.019> and<00:02:16.170> we<00:02:16.230> look<00:02:16.410> at<00:02:16.530> the<00:02:16.590> television<00:02:16.769> here

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
back and we look at the television here

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.790 
back and we look at the television here
and<00:02:17.550> we<00:02:18.000> can<00:02:18.150> see<00:02:18.360> that<00:02:18.599> we<00:02:18.989> have<00:02:19.170> connected<00:02:19.680> to

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
and we can see that we have connected to

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.699 
and we can see that we have connected to
the<00:02:19.920> RF<00:02:20.280> one<00:02:20.610> output<00:02:21.090> rather<00:02:21.390> than<00:02:21.599> a<00:02:21.660> RF<00:02:21.900> -<00:02:22.170> but

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
the RF one output rather than a RF - but

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.650 
the RF one output rather than a RF - but
the<00:02:22.769> problem<00:02:22.950> here<00:02:23.220> is<00:02:23.280> RF<00:02:23.849> one<00:02:24.090> works<00:02:24.360> fine

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
the problem here is RF one works fine

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.140 
the problem here is RF one works fine
for<00:02:25.410> the<00:02:25.470> picture<00:02:25.860> but<00:02:26.010> it<00:02:26.430> does<00:02:26.640> not<00:02:26.819> actually

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
for the picture but it does not actually

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.780 
for the picture but it does not actually
have<00:02:27.420> I<00:02:27.900> just<00:02:28.230> pull<00:02:28.590> it<00:02:28.680> away<00:02:28.769> here<00:02:29.129> a<00:02:29.280> nine

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
have I just pull it away here a nine

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.610 
have I just pull it away here a nine
volt<00:02:29.819> output<00:02:30.269> so<00:02:30.900> we<00:02:31.019> need<00:02:31.200> to<00:02:31.349> have<00:02:31.470> it

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
volt output so we need to have it

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.000 
volt output so we need to have it
connected<00:02:32.280> onto<00:02:32.519> the<00:02:32.730> RF<00:02:33.090> to<00:02:33.390> output<00:02:34.110> here<00:02:34.349> so

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
connected onto the RF to output here so

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.890 
connected onto the RF to output here so
we'll<00:02:35.160> push<00:02:35.370> this<00:02:35.549> in<00:02:35.790> here<00:02:36.030> and<00:02:36.209> we'll<00:02:36.750> go

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
we'll push this in here and we'll go

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.729 
we'll push this in here and we'll go
back<00:02:37.049> and<00:02:37.080> look<00:02:37.290> at<00:02:37.500> this<00:02:37.590> guy<00:02:37.799> here<00:02:39.530> and<00:02:40.530> we

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
back and look at this guy here and we

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:42.860 
back and look at this guy here and we
can<00:02:40.890> see<00:02:41.099> that<00:02:41.489> the<00:02:41.640> LED<00:02:41.730> light<00:02:42.239> has<00:02:42.540> come<00:02:42.629> on

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
can see that the LED light has come on

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.930 
can see that the LED light has come on
now<00:02:43.110> so<00:02:43.530> we<00:02:43.650> have<00:02:43.680> it<00:02:43.890> successfully<00:02:44.459> there

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
now so we have it successfully there

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.210 
now so we have it successfully there
another<00:02:45.209> possible<00:02:45.690> issue<00:02:45.900> is<00:02:46.170> that<00:02:46.380> possibly

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
another possible issue is that possibly

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.190 
another possible issue is that possibly
it's<00:02:47.459> not<00:02:47.730> lighting<00:02:48.000> up<00:02:48.209> but<00:02:48.540> we<00:02:48.630> do<00:02:48.810> have<00:02:49.049> it

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
it's not lighting up but we do have it

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.339 
it's not lighting up but we do have it
connected<00:02:49.590> to<00:02:49.860> an<00:02:50.160> RF<00:02:50.940> -<00:02:51.180> so<00:02:51.930> I'm<00:02:52.079> just<00:02:52.230> going

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
connected to an RF - so I'm just going

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:53.870 
connected to an RF - so I'm just going
to<00:02:52.380> rotate<00:02:52.500> this<00:02:52.829> box<00:02:53.069> around<00:02:53.310> something<00:02:53.730> so<00:02:53.819> I

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
to rotate this box around something so I

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.520 
to rotate this box around something so I
can<00:02:53.970> access<00:02:54.150> it<00:02:54.329> here<00:02:54.569> and<00:02:55.049> I'm<00:02:55.200> just<00:02:55.230> going<00:02:55.470> to

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
can access it here and I'm just going to

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:56.839 
can access it here and I'm just going to
go<00:02:55.620> to<00:02:55.650> the<00:02:55.920> services<00:02:56.489> button

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:56.849 
go to the services button

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:00.860 
go to the services button
I<00:02:57.030> go<00:02:57.959> to<00:02:58.019> an<00:02:58.530> option<00:02:59.099> number<00:02:59.250> 4<00:02:59.790> and<00:03:00.150> I<00:03:00.750> in

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
I go to an option number 4 and I in

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.580 
I go to an option number 4 and I in
quick<00:03:01.110> succession<00:03:01.290> I<00:03:01.739> type<00:03:01.980> in<00:03:02.160> 0<00:03:02.610> 1<00:03:02.970> select<00:03:03.750> so

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
quick succession I type in 0 1 select so

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.380 
quick succession I type in 0 1 select so
if<00:03:04.739> we<00:03:04.829> come<00:03:05.040> down<00:03:05.220> here<00:03:05.280> I<00:03:05.700> go<00:03:05.849> to<00:03:05.910> the<00:03:06.060> RF

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
if we come down here I go to the RF

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.119 
if we come down here I go to the RF
outputs<00:03:06.840> here<00:03:07.019> and<00:03:07.470> I<00:03:07.560> can<00:03:07.739> see<00:03:07.890> that<00:03:08.040> the

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:08.129 
outputs here and I can see that the

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:10.030 
outputs here and I can see that the
power<00:03:08.310> out<00:03:08.610> of<00:03:08.700> that<00:03:08.879> is<00:03:09.060> in<00:03:09.629> the<00:03:09.750> on<00:03:09.930> position

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
power out of that is in the on position

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.229 
power out of that is in the on position
now<00:03:11.040> if<00:03:11.099> we<00:03:11.250> come<00:03:11.459> along<00:03:11.670> and<00:03:11.879> it<00:03:11.970> is<00:03:12.060> in<00:03:12.150> the

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
now if we come along and it is in the

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.650 
now if we come along and it is in the
off<00:03:12.390> position<00:03:12.450> if<00:03:13.610> we<00:03:14.610> look<00:03:14.819> at<00:03:14.940> the<00:03:15.030> sky<00:03:15.239> I<00:03:15.269> now

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
off position if we look at the sky I now

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.199 
off position if we look at the sky I now
even<00:03:16.530> though<00:03:16.590> it's<00:03:16.739> connected<00:03:17.100> to<00:03:17.130> RF<00:03:17.459> 2<00:03:17.700> it's

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
even though it's connected to RF 2 it's

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.360 
even though it's connected to RF 2 it's
simply<00:03:18.569> not<00:03:18.600> working<00:03:19.170> ok<00:03:19.470> now<00:03:20.100> another

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
simply not working ok now another

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:21.830 
simply not working ok now another
interesting<00:03:20.579> thing<00:03:21.090> that<00:03:21.120> can<00:03:21.329> happen<00:03:21.540> with

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
interesting thing that can happen with

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.410 
interesting thing that can happen with
Sky<00:03:22.049> eise's<00:03:22.560> then<00:03:23.130> over<00:03:23.459> a<00:03:23.519> period<00:03:23.760> of<00:03:23.910> time<00:03:24.120> if

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
Sky eise's then over a period of time if

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.589 
Sky eise's then over a period of time if
it's<00:03:25.019> turned<00:03:25.380> on<00:03:25.709> all<00:03:26.430> of<00:03:26.730> us<00:03:26.819> that<00:03:27.359> it<00:03:27.480> can

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:27.599 
it's turned on all of us that it can

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:29.839 
it's turned on all of us that it can
actually<00:03:27.959> be<00:03:28.200> on<00:03:28.230> but<00:03:28.859> still<00:03:29.099> not<00:03:29.280> give<00:03:29.579> a<00:03:29.609> 9

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:29.849 
actually be on but still not give a 9

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:31.729 
actually be on but still not give a 9
volt<00:03:30.120> output<00:03:30.329> and<00:03:30.840> if<00:03:30.900> that's<00:03:31.019> the<00:03:31.230> case<00:03:31.290> what

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
volt output and if that's the case what

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.500 
volt output and if that's the case what
you<00:03:31.889> would<00:03:31.980> simply<00:03:32.130> do<00:03:32.430> is<00:03:32.609> you<00:03:33.030> would<00:03:33.150> go<00:03:33.209> in

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
you would simply do is you would go in

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.020 
you would simply do is you would go in
you<00:03:34.349> would<00:03:34.500> turn<00:03:34.739> it<00:03:34.920> from<00:03:35.430> the<00:03:35.519> arm<00:03:35.760> position

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
you would turn it from the arm position

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.530 
you would turn it from the arm position
to<00:03:36.540> the<00:03:36.630> off<00:03:36.810> position<00:03:37.049> save<00:03:37.889> the<00:03:38.069> settings<00:03:38.540> go

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
to the off position save the settings go

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.710 
to the off position save the settings go
back<00:03:39.720> in<00:03:40.019> and<00:03:40.410> turn<00:03:40.859> it<00:03:40.889> back<00:03:41.190> on<00:03:41.430> and<00:03:41.849> often

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
back in and turn it back on and often

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.569 
back in and turn it back on and often
that<00:03:42.840> can<00:03:43.049> clear<00:03:43.200> a<00:03:43.290> problem<00:03:43.680> in<00:03:43.799> so<00:03:44.190> that's

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
that can clear a problem in so that's

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:46.250 
that can clear a problem in so that's
quite<00:03:44.819> an<00:03:44.940> interesting<00:03:45.209> one<00:03:45.599> there<00:03:45.810> but<00:03:46.139> it

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
quite an interesting one there but it

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.930 
quite an interesting one there but it
shouldn't<00:03:46.980> work<00:03:47.010> but<00:03:47.310> it<00:03:47.489> does<00:03:47.609> from

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
shouldn't work but it does from

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.909 
shouldn't work but it does from
experience<00:03:48.480> ok<00:03:48.810> so<00:03:49.319> let's<00:03:49.500> look<00:03:49.650> at<00:03:49.799> other

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:49.919 
experience ok so let's look at other

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:51.289 
experience ok so let's look at other
things<00:03:50.010> then<00:03:50.400> at<00:03:50.519> the<00:03:50.609> bottom<00:03:50.760> of<00:03:51.030> your<00:03:51.060> own

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
things then at the bottom of your own

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:53.690 
things then at the bottom of your own
one<00:03:51.840> very<00:03:52.380> very<00:03:52.680> common<00:03:53.099> mistakes<00:03:53.459> that<00:03:53.639> are

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
one very very common mistakes that are

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.210 
one very very common mistakes that are
made<00:03:53.819> is<00:03:54.150> people<00:03:54.840> try<00:03:55.019> to<00:03:55.079> connect<00:03:55.799> this<00:03:55.950> in

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
made is people try to connect this in

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.430 
made is people try to connect this in
and<00:03:56.430> then<00:03:56.880> feed<00:03:57.269> the<00:03:57.389> signal<00:03:57.569> into<00:03:58.079> a<00:03:58.109> wall

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
and then feed the signal into a wall

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.460 
and then feed the signal into a wall
place<00:03:58.799> and<00:03:59.069> then<00:03:59.630> either<00:04:00.630> directly<00:04:01.290> at<00:04:01.410> the

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
place and then either directly at the

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.050 
place and then either directly at the
back<00:04:01.590> of<00:04:01.620> the<00:04:01.799> Sky<00:04:01.950> box<00:04:02.190> are<00:04:02.459> in<00:04:02.579> the<00:04:02.669> second

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
back of the Sky box are in the second

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.300 
back of the Sky box are in the second
location<00:04:03.209> but<00:04:03.959> this<00:04:04.109> often<00:04:04.590> will<00:04:04.799> not<00:04:05.040> work

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
location but this often will not work

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.490 
location but this often will not work
what<00:04:05.819> you<00:04:05.970> need<00:04:06.180> to<00:04:06.329> be<00:04:06.419> doing<00:04:06.720> is<00:04:06.900> you<00:04:07.230> need<00:04:07.380> to

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
what you need to be doing is you need to

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.530 
what you need to be doing is you need to
remove<00:04:07.769> all<00:04:07.980> face<00:04:08.549> plates<00:04:08.910> that<00:04:09.180> are<00:04:09.299> on<00:04:09.419> the

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
remove all face plates that are on the

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.479 
remove all face plates that are on the
thing<00:04:09.750> and<00:04:09.870> all<00:04:10.319> connections<00:04:10.889> need<00:04:11.160> to<00:04:11.340> use

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
thing and all connections need to use

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:13.789 
thing and all connections need to use
this<00:04:11.760> F<00:04:12.030> type<00:04:12.720> connector<00:04:13.169> that<00:04:13.319> we<00:04:13.410> use<00:04:13.560> here

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
this F type connector that we use here

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:15.740 
this F type connector that we use here
and<00:04:14.010> the<00:04:14.340> reason<00:04:14.669> that<00:04:14.730> we<00:04:14.880> insist<00:04:15.180> on<00:04:15.359> this<00:04:15.510> is

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
and the reason that we insist on this is

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.779 
and the reason that we insist on this is
F<00:04:16.079> type<00:04:16.500> connectors<00:04:16.950> are<00:04:17.099> fire<00:04:17.459> better

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:17.789 
F type connectors are fire better

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:20.509 
F type connectors are fire better
attract<00:04:18.570> transferring<00:04:19.320> voltage<00:04:19.950> than<00:04:20.489> the

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
attract transferring voltage than the

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.880 
attract transferring voltage than the
traditional<00:04:21.229> coaxial<00:04:22.229> type<00:04:22.469> that<00:04:22.650> we<00:04:22.740> have

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:22.890 
traditional coaxial type that we have

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:24.560 
traditional coaxial type that we have
here<00:04:23.159> so<00:04:23.550> if<00:04:23.640> we<00:04:23.729> were<00:04:23.909> trying<00:04:24.030> to<00:04:24.180> transfer

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
here so if we were trying to transfer

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:25.460 
here so if we were trying to transfer
our<00:04:24.630> signal<00:04:24.990> you

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
our signal you

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.590 
our signal you
a<00:04:25.500> coaxial<00:04:26.100> connector<00:04:26.520> and<00:04:26.820> a<00:04:27.150> coaxial

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
a coaxial connector and a coaxial

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.600 
a coaxial connector and a coaxial
jointer<00:04:27.960> like<00:04:28.260> that<00:04:28.440> it<00:04:28.710> just<00:04:28.770> will<00:04:29.370> not<00:04:29.550> be

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
jointer like that it just will not be

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.330 
jointer like that it just will not be
successful<00:04:30.000> it'll<00:04:30.990> be<00:04:31.140> either<00:04:31.530> not<00:04:31.890> work<00:04:32.130> or

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
successful it'll be either not work or

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.220 
successful it'll be either not work or
even<00:04:32.550> worse<00:04:32.730> not<00:04:33.000> intermittently<00:04:33.780> work<00:04:34.020> and

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:34.230 
even worse not intermittently work and

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:37.160 
even worse not intermittently work and
slowly<00:04:34.500> drive<00:04:34.830> you<00:04:34.980> insane<00:04:35.690> so<00:04:36.690> that's<00:04:36.870> it

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:37.170 
slowly drive you insane so that's it

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:38.510 
slowly drive you insane so that's it
so<00:04:37.350> you<00:04:37.440> need<00:04:37.620> to<00:04:37.710> keep<00:04:37.860> it<00:04:37.980> simple<00:04:38.010> like<00:04:38.460> that

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
so you need to keep it simple like that

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.730 
so you need to keep it simple like that
the<00:04:39.150> next<00:04:39.420> thing<00:04:39.600> that<00:04:39.630> is<00:04:39.870> people<00:04:40.260> trying<00:04:40.650> to

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
the next thing that is people trying to

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.260 
the next thing that is people trying to
come<00:04:40.890> along<00:04:41.160> and<00:04:41.370> the<00:04:41.490> decide<00:04:41.970> that<00:04:42.120> we're

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
come along and the decide that we're

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:43.730 
come along and the decide that we're
going<00:04:42.390> to<00:04:42.510> use<00:04:42.630> something<00:04:42.900> like<00:04:43.020> a<00:04:43.290> passive

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
going to use something like a passive

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.070 
going to use something like a passive

rooms<00:04:46.380> now<00:04:47.010> what<00:04:47.190> you<00:04:47.310> need<00:04:47.490> to<00:04:47.550> make<00:04:47.880> sure<00:04:47.910> is

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
rooms now what you need to make sure is

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.020 
rooms now what you need to make sure is
that<00:04:48.720> you're<00:04:48.900> using<00:04:49.140> proper<00:04:49.530> and<00:04:50.030> power

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
that you're using proper and power

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:52.910 
that you're using proper and power
passing<00:04:51.660> splitters<00:04:52.110> if<00:04:52.410> you're<00:04:52.560> going<00:04:52.710> to<00:04:52.770> be

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:52.920 
passing splitters if you're going to be

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.440 
passing splitters if you're going to be

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
multiples guys are simply a sky in one

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.410 
multiples guys are simply a sky in one
room<00:05:01.950> and<00:05:02.070> not<00:05:02.250> in<00:05:02.400> the<00:05:02.520> other<00:05:02.610> so<00:05:03.090> we<00:05:03.240> took

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:03.420 
room and not in the other so we took

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:07.550 
room and not in the other so we took
this<00:05:03.600> here<00:05:03.960> this<00:05:04.680> is<00:05:04.860> a<00:05:04.890> lab<00:05:05.220> gear<00:05:05.520> and<00:05:06.560> link

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
this here this is a lab gear and link

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.980 
this here this is a lab gear and link
amplifier<00:05:08.100> so<00:05:08.490> we<00:05:08.580> have<00:05:08.670> TV<00:05:09.090> in<00:05:09.270> here<00:05:09.720> and<00:05:09.930> we

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990 
amplifier so we have TV in here and we

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:11.750 
amplifier so we have TV in here and we
on<00:05:10.200> this<00:05:10.350> picture<00:05:10.560> model<00:05:10.980> we<00:05:11.310> have<00:05:11.460> actually

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:11.760 
on this picture model we have actually

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.970 
on this picture model we have actually
four<00:05:11.970> outputs<00:05:12.420> okay<00:05:12.750> so<00:05:13.230> what's<00:05:13.440> tuned<00:05:13.680> here

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:13.980 
four outputs okay so what's tuned here

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.890 
four outputs okay so what's tuned here
is<00:05:14.100> it<00:05:14.370> will<00:05:14.610> split<00:05:15.150> out<00:05:15.330> to<00:05:15.480> four<00:05:15.720> different

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:15.900 
is it will split out to four different

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:17.900 
is it will split out to four different
televisions<00:05:16.620> and<00:05:16.890> what<00:05:17.040> this<00:05:17.220> will<00:05:17.460> allow<00:05:17.580> is

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:17.910 
televisions and what this will allow is

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:19.610 
televisions and what this will allow is
signal<00:05:18.330> to<00:05:18.419> pass<00:05:18.600> through<00:05:18.960> pass<00:05:19.320> port

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:19.620 
signal to pass through pass port

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.070 
signal to pass through pass port
illusions<00:05:20.100> but<00:05:20.490> the<00:05:20.730> board<00:05:21.419> let's<00:05:21.660> a<00:05:21.780> picture

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
illusions but the board let's a picture

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.440 
illusions but the board let's a picture
go<00:05:22.230> true<00:05:22.500> but<00:05:22.740> also<00:05:22.919> very<00:05:23.370> importantly<00:05:24.000> let's

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:24.450 
go true but also very importantly let's

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:26.270 
go true but also very importantly let's
the<00:05:24.660> reverse<00:05:25.050> signal<00:05:25.350> coming<00:05:25.740> from<00:05:25.860> the<00:05:26.010> sky

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 
the reverse signal coming from the sky

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.550 
the reverse signal coming from the sky
go<00:05:26.880> backwards<00:05:27.360> true<00:05:27.630> here<00:05:27.900> and<00:05:28.080> with

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.560 
go backwards true here and with

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.290 
go backwards true here and with
something<00:05:28.890> like<00:05:29.040> this<00:05:29.190> because<00:05:29.910> it's

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300 
something like this because it's

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.000 
something like this because it's
actually<00:05:30.510> the<00:05:30.900> built-in<00:05:31.200> amplification<00:05:31.890> on

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:32.010 
actually the built-in amplification on

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:33.770 
actually the built-in amplification on
it's<00:05:32.370> actually<00:05:32.610> not<00:05:32.910> alone<00:05:33.150> splitting<00:05:33.660> but

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:33.780 
it's actually not alone splitting but

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:35.870 
it's actually not alone splitting but
also<00:05:34.020> boosting<00:05:34.650> the<00:05:34.740> signal<00:05:34.919> even<00:05:35.430> when

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:35.880 
also boosting the signal even when

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.640 
also boosting the signal even when
there's<00:05:36.330> no<00:05:36.450> power<00:05:36.750> unit<00:05:37.080> connected<00:05:37.470> to<00:05:37.560> it

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:37.650 
there's no power unit connected to it

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:39.350 
there's no power unit connected to it
something<00:05:38.100> like<00:05:38.220> that<00:05:38.400> it's<00:05:38.580> excellent<00:05:38.910> so

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 
something like that it's excellent so

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.630 
something like that it's excellent so
often<00:05:40.230> what<00:05:40.380> will<00:05:40.500> happen<00:05:40.770> is<00:05:40.890> people<00:05:41.070> use

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:41.640 
often what will happen is people use

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.310 
often what will happen is people use
something<00:05:41.970> like<00:05:42.030> a<00:05:42.120> passive<00:05:42.630> splitter<00:05:42.960> and

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:43.320 
something like a passive splitter and

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.080 
something like a passive splitter and
the<00:05:43.860> problem<00:05:44.130> with<00:05:44.220> passive<00:05:44.340> slavers<00:05:44.940> is

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.090 
the problem with passive slavers is

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:46.909 
the problem with passive slavers is
it'll<00:05:45.510> let<00:05:45.600> the<00:05:45.690> picture<00:05:45.960> go<00:05:46.110> true<00:05:46.410> but<00:05:46.800> it

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:46.919 
it'll let the picture go true but it

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:48.890 
it'll let the picture go true but it
will<00:05:47.130> not<00:05:47.400> let<00:05:47.550> the<00:05:47.700> power<00:05:47.880> go<00:05:48.030> back<00:05:48.330> so<00:05:48.780> that

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:48.900 
will not let the power go back so that

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.760 
will not let the power go back so that
once<00:05:49.320> again<00:05:49.440> it's<00:05:49.740> a<00:05:49.800> fairly<00:05:50.010> key<00:05:50.280> issue<00:05:50.910> on<00:05:51.180> it

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:51.770 
once again it's a fairly key issue on it

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:55.490 
once again it's a fairly key issue on it
now<00:05:52.770> I<00:05:53.070> am<00:05:53.250> moving<00:05:54.240> away<00:05:54.450> quickly<00:05:54.900> from<00:05:55.169> sky<00:05:55.470> I

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:55.500 
now I am moving away quickly from sky I

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.830 
now I am moving away quickly from sky I
our<00:05:56.010> sky<00:05:56.340> boxes<00:05:56.550> are<00:05:56.850> the<00:05:56.940> other<00:05:57.090> heavy<00:05:57.330> boxes

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:57.840 
our sky boxes are the other heavy boxes

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.590 
our sky boxes are the other heavy boxes
a<00:05:57.960> lot<00:05:58.680> of<00:05:58.860> boxes<00:05:59.190> don't<00:05:59.490> have<00:05:59.910> a<00:06:00.180> nine<00:06:00.570> volt

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:00.600 
a lot of boxes don't have a nine volt

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.780 
a lot of boxes don't have a nine volt
output<00:06:01.080> on<00:06:01.530> them<00:06:01.740> so<00:06:02.010> they<00:06:02.100> might<00:06:02.250> have<00:06:02.430> an<00:06:02.520> RF

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:02.790 
output on them so they might have an RF

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:04.550 
output on them so they might have an RF
out<00:06:03.000> but<00:06:03.540> and<00:06:03.750> people<00:06:03.930> take<00:06:04.169> all<00:06:04.320> just

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:04.560 
out but and people take all just

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.260 
out but and people take all just
connected<00:06:04.919> up<00:06:05.040> here<00:06:05.280> and<00:06:05.460> I'll<00:06:05.760> run<00:06:06.000> on<00:06:06.240> a

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:06.270 
connected up here and I'll run on a

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:08.390 
connected up here and I'll run on a
paralyzed<00:06:06.720> guy<00:06:06.750> of<00:06:07.350> it<00:06:07.500> it<00:06:07.710> just<00:06:08.040> won't<00:06:08.220> work

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.400 
paralyzed guy of it it just won't work

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.670 
paralyzed guy of it it just won't work
okay<00:06:09.030> so<00:06:09.210> what<00:06:09.630> you<00:06:09.750> need<00:06:09.780> if<00:06:10.229> you're<00:06:10.380> dealing

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:10.680 
okay so what you need if you're dealing

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.380 
okay so what you need if you're dealing
with<00:06:10.710> a<00:06:10.800> box<00:06:11.070> that<00:06:11.340> doesn't<00:06:11.640> have<00:06:12.000> a<00:06:12.030> nine<00:06:12.360> volt

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:12.390 
with a box that doesn't have a nine volt

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:14.780 
with a box that doesn't have a nine volt
output<00:06:12.870> on<00:06:13.290> and<00:06:13.620> you<00:06:14.190> need<00:06:14.340> to<00:06:14.460> use<00:06:14.550> something

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:14.790 
output on and you need to use something

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:17.150 
output on and you need to use something
like<00:06:14.940> this<00:06:15.120> try<00:06:15.419> link<00:06:15.690> here<00:06:15.900> okay<00:06:16.380> so<00:06:16.560> this<00:06:16.979> is

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:17.160 
like this try link here okay so this is

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:18.920 
like this try link here okay so this is
it<00:06:17.370> takes<00:06:17.640> a<00:06:17.729> scanner<00:06:18.000> clean<00:06:18.240> out<00:06:18.450> of<00:06:18.690> the<00:06:18.780> back

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:18.930 
it takes a scanner clean out of the back

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:21.260 
it takes a scanner clean out of the back
of<00:06:18.960> a<00:06:19.380> satellite<00:06:19.979> box<00:06:20.280> or<00:06:20.520> indeed<00:06:20.820> as<00:06:20.940> a<00:06:21.060> review

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:21.270 
of a satellite box or indeed as a review

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:23.630

the puking phases if you have crappy
quality<00:06:38.190> cable<00:06:38.910> in<00:06:39.210> the<00:06:39.720> thing<00:06:40.080> and<00:06:40.380> you<00:06:40.860> can

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:41.010 
quality cable in the thing and you can

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:43.910 
quality cable in the thing and you can
have<00:06:41.280> a<00:06:41.310> situation<00:06:41.550> here<00:06:41.940> where<00:06:42.570> they<00:06:42.930> decay

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:43.920 
have a situation here where they decay

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:45.860 
have a situation here where they decay
but<00:06:44.130> the<00:06:44.250> signal<00:06:44.580> will<00:06:44.730> simply<00:06:45.030> die<00:06:45.240> off<00:06:45.450> over

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:45.870
