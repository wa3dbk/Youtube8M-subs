00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:03.190 
too much hair and but I settled on this
one<00:02:00.470> it's<00:02:00.590> called<00:02:00.649> Holly<00:02:01.660> and<00:02:02.660> this<00:02:02.869> is<00:02:03.050> a

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
one it's called Holly and this is a

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:09.490 
one it's called Holly and this is a
color<00:02:03.560> 1b<00:02:04.420> it's<00:02:05.420> a<00:02:05.569> synthetic<00:02:05.840> wig<00:02:06.560> and<00:02:08.500> which

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
color 1b it's a synthetic wig and which

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.110 
color 1b it's a synthetic wig and which
means<00:02:09.770> it's<00:02:09.950> actually<00:02:10.220> easier<00:02:10.610> to<00:02:10.789> look<00:02:10.910> after

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
means it's actually easier to look after

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.089 
means it's actually easier to look after
because<00:02:11.690> it<00:02:11.810> won't<00:02:12.020> sort<00:02:12.530> of<00:02:12.590> splits<00:02:12.860> at<00:02:13.010> the

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:13.099 
because it won't sort of splits at the

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:16.240 
because it won't sort of splits at the
ends<00:02:13.610> it's<00:02:14.120> quite<00:02:14.390> easy<00:02:14.420> to<00:02:14.750> wash<00:02:15.110> and<00:02:15.140> dry<00:02:15.680> and

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
ends it's quite easy to wash and dry and

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.250 
ends it's quite easy to wash and dry and
I<00:02:17.030> use<00:02:17.510> next

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
I use next

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.470 
I use next
brush<00:02:18.980> this<00:02:19.280> is<00:02:19.430> worn<00:02:19.700> by<00:02:20.480> an<00:02:21.400> owl<00:02:22.400> men<00:02:22.700> and

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.850 
which I had when I have extensions and
it's<00:02:25.849> all<00:02:26.780> I<00:02:26.840> can<00:02:26.989> say<00:02:27.110> is<00:02:27.140> it's<00:02:27.319> a<00:02:27.439> bit<00:02:27.590> weird

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
it's all I can say is it's a bit weird

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.210

one for the whole day in the whole
evening<00:02:33.200> and<00:02:33.769> last<00:02:34.640> Saturday<00:02:35.360> and<00:02:35.599> it<00:02:35.659> was

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
evening and last Saturday and it was

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.990 
evening and last Saturday and it was
quite<00:02:35.930> comfortable<00:02:36.500> towards<00:02:37.340> the<00:02:37.459> end<00:02:37.519> I

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
quite comfortable towards the end I

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.280 
quite comfortable towards the end I
started<00:02:38.420> to<00:02:38.480> get<00:02:38.569> a<00:02:38.629> little<00:02:38.659> bit<00:02:38.989> sort<00:02:39.260> of

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
started to get a little bit sort of

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.759 
started to get a little bit sort of
itchy<00:02:40.269> underneath<00:02:41.269> I<00:02:41.569> just<00:02:42.110> put<00:02:42.260> my<00:02:42.379> hair<00:02:42.590> in<00:02:42.680> a

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
itchy underneath I just put my hair in a

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:44.589 
itchy underneath I just put my hair in a
ponytail<00:02:43.129> and<00:02:43.579> sort<00:02:43.879> of<00:02:43.970> tuck<00:02:44.299> it<00:02:44.480> and

00:02:44.589 --> 00:02:44.599 
ponytail and sort of tuck it and

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:47.110 
ponytail and sort of tuck it and
excellent<00:02:45.200> has<00:02:45.319> kind<00:02:46.159> of<00:02:46.340> just<00:02:46.730> a<00:02:46.819> bit<00:02:46.970> longer

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
excellent has kind of just a bit longer

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.910 
excellent has kind of just a bit longer
than<00:02:47.420> this<00:02:47.599> so<00:02:47.959> if<00:02:48.109> you<00:02:48.200> have<00:02:48.319> a<00:02:48.349> lot<00:02:48.530> of<00:02:48.560> hair

that<00:03:21.769> it<00:03:22.190> does<00:03:22.519> keep<00:03:22.730> my<00:03:22.910> head<00:03:23.180> really<00:03:23.569> warm

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:24.019 
that it does keep my head really warm

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:27.250 
that it does keep my head really warm
and<00:03:24.349> and<00:03:25.310> I<00:03:25.730> just<00:03:25.940> really<00:03:26.120> like<00:03:26.389> it<00:03:26.690> I<00:03:26.870> had<00:03:27.109> to

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
and and I just really like it I had to

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.430 
and and I just really like it I had to
have<00:03:27.379> the<00:03:27.620> the<00:03:28.430> front<00:03:28.760> trimmed<00:03:29.449> because<00:03:30.169> when

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
have the the front trimmed because when

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.740 
have the the front trimmed because when
I<00:03:30.470> got<00:03:30.680> it<00:03:30.980> it<00:03:31.250> was<00:03:31.669> down<00:03:31.910> here<00:03:32.239> and<00:03:32.419> I<00:03:32.480> couldn't

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
I got it it was down here and I couldn't

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.550 
I got it it was down here and I couldn't
actually<00:03:33.019> see<00:03:33.319> and<00:03:33.849> so<00:03:35.019> when<00:03:36.019> you<00:03:36.139> get<00:03:36.290> a<00:03:36.319> wig

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
actually see and so when you get a wig

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.680 
actually see and so when you get a wig
when<00:03:37.400> you<00:03:37.549> go<00:03:37.699> for<00:03:37.879> your<00:03:38.000> regular<00:03:38.389> haircut

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
when you go for your regular haircut

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.800 
when you go for your regular haircut
take<00:03:39.530> up<00:03:39.769> take<00:03:40.220> it<00:03:40.370> with<00:03:40.489> you<00:03:40.549> put<00:03:41.299> it<00:03:41.419> on<00:03:41.540> and

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
take up take it with you put it on and

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.990 
take up take it with you put it on and
they<00:03:41.989> will<00:03:42.139> actually<00:03:42.500> trim<00:03:42.739> it<00:03:42.889> for<00:03:42.919> you<00:03:43.160> so

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
they will actually trim it for you so

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.240 
they will actually trim it for you so
that<00:03:44.299> it's<00:03:44.510> perfect<00:03:45.109> every<00:03:45.470> time<00:03:45.620> you<00:03:45.829> wear<00:03:46.010> it

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
that it's perfect every time you wear it

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.849 
that it's perfect every time you wear it
I'm<00:03:46.459> all<00:03:47.299> I<00:03:47.329> tend<00:03:47.780> to<00:03:47.900> do<00:03:48.079> is<00:03:48.109> just<00:03:48.500> give<00:03:48.709> it<00:03:48.799> a

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:48.859 
I'm all I tend to do is just give it a

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:54.490 
I'm all I tend to do is just give it a
little<00:03:49.180> brush<00:03:50.180> and<00:03:51.069> and<00:03:52.069> sort<00:03:52.730> of<00:03:53.260> sleek<00:03:54.260> it

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
little brush and and sort of sleek it

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.289 
little brush and and sort of sleek it
down<00:03:54.769> because<00:03:55.220> it<00:03:55.459> doesn't<00:03:55.910> it<00:03:56.239> doesn't

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:56.299 
down because it doesn't it doesn't
