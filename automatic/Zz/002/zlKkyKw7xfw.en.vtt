00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
as leggy and and but I mean your face

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:19.270 
as leggy and and but I mean your face
looks<00:01:17.750> completely<00:01:18.260> different<00:01:18.740> than<00:01:18.920> the

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
looks completely different than the

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.400 
looks completely different than the
impression<00:01:19.670> I<00:01:19.759> had<00:01:20.000> of<00:01:20.030> it<00:01:20.300> now<00:01:20.750> is<00:01:20.900> is<00:01:21.140> that<00:01:21.170> a

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:21.410 
impression I had of it now is is that a

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:23.050 
impression I had of it now is is that a
secret<00:01:21.890> of<00:01:22.009> modeling<00:01:22.400> or<00:01:22.550> is<00:01:22.700> that<00:01:22.820> just<00:01:22.880> the

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
secret of modeling or is that just the

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.790 
secret of modeling or is that just the
way<00:01:23.210> that<00:01:23.360> works<00:01:23.600> well<00:01:24.200> I<00:01:24.259> guess<00:01:24.470> we<00:01:24.619> just<00:01:24.650> have

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:24.800 
way that works well I guess we just have

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.070 
way that works well I guess we just have
faces<00:01:25.340> that<00:01:25.520> can<00:01:25.759> change<00:01:26.150> pretty<00:01:26.540> easily<00:01:26.750> too

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
faces that can change pretty easily too

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.870 
faces that can change pretty easily too
depending<00:01:27.530> on<00:01:27.619> what<00:01:27.860> makeup<00:01:28.220> and<00:01:28.430> hair<00:01:28.700> and

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
depending on what makeup and hair and

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.060 
depending on what makeup and hair and
clothing<00:01:29.210> and<00:01:29.509> all<00:01:29.570> that<00:01:29.869> so<00:01:30.200> rubber<00:01:30.619> faces

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070
