because it couldn't meet his own demands
and<00:00:51.210> apparently<00:00:51.840> as<00:00:51.930> a<00:00:51.960> potential<00:00:52.230> of<00:00:52.410> like<00:00:52.530> 76

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
and apparently as a potential of like 76

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.170 
and apparently as a potential of like 76
which<00:00:53.550> isn't<00:00:53.820> too<00:00:53.940> bad<00:00:54.120> um<00:00:55.070> then<00:00:56.070> I<00:00:56.460> want<00:00:57.120> a

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.190 
weeks where I had two games in a row
that<00:01:07.830> I<00:01:08.820> really<00:01:09.210> was<00:01:09.360> a<00:01:09.390> lot<00:01:09.570> less<00:01:09.780> consistent

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
that I really was a lot less consistent

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
someone playing him a little bit more

this<00:06:09.310> guy<00:06:09.460> Damien<00:06:09.850> McCrory<00:06:10.330> now<00:06:11.229> he's<00:06:11.560> kind<00:06:11.860> of

00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:11.919 
this guy Damien McCrory now he's kind of

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:13.380 
this guy Damien McCrory now he's kind of
a<00:06:12.039> beast<00:06:12.280> because<00:06:12.760> even<00:06:13.120> though<00:06:13.180> he<00:06:13.240> has<00:06:13.330> a

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:13.390 
a beast because even though he has a

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:16.529 
a beast because even though he has a
lower<00:06:13.690> overall<00:06:14.110> rating<00:06:14.650> he<00:06:15.400> has<00:06:15.520> 86<00:06:15.970> stamina

00:06:16.529 --> 00:06:16.539 
lower overall rating he has 86 stamina

00:06:16.539 --> 00:06:17.909 
lower overall rating he has 86 stamina

00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:17.919 
so I don't see him getting tired anytime

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:21.510 
so I don't see him getting tired anytime

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:24.520 
than she in which is really nice the

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:27.330 
than she in which is really nice the
only<00:06:24.820> thing<00:06:25.060> is<00:06:25.500> he's<00:06:26.500> not<00:06:26.800> quite<00:06:27.039> as<00:06:27.100> a<00:06:27.220> good

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:27.340 
only thing is he's not quite as a good

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:29.640 
only thing is he's not quite as a good
at<00:06:27.430> defending<00:06:27.760> in<00:06:28.120> general<00:06:28.659> but<00:06:28.930> he<00:06:29.349> makes<00:06:29.530> a

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:29.650 
at defending in general but he makes a

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:32.760 
at defending in general but he makes a
decent<00:06:29.800> fullback<00:06:31.080> so<00:06:32.080> he's<00:06:32.200> gonna<00:06:32.320> cover<00:06:32.530> um

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:32.770
