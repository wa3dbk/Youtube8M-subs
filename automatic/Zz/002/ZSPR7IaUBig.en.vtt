I'm<00:00:00.390> very<00:00:01.050> often<00:00:01.500> then<00:00:01.740> you're<00:00:02.159> gonna<00:00:02.250> run<00:00:02.580> out

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:02.730 
I'm very often then you're gonna run out

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.690 
I'm very often then you're gonna run out
of<00:00:02.760> space<00:00:03.330> up<00:00:03.720> in<00:00:03.870> this<00:00:04.049> upper<00:00:04.319> pane<00:00:05.069> and<00:00:05.430> so<00:00:05.670> I

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
of space up in this upper pane and so I

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.909 
of space up in this upper pane and so I
often<00:00:06.089> will<00:00:06.509> put<00:00:06.870> the<00:00:06.990> detailed<00:00:07.410> view<00:00:07.500> to<00:00:07.799> the

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
often will put the detailed view to the

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.160 
often will put the detailed view to the
right<00:00:08.130> so<00:00:08.460> that<00:00:08.700> I<00:00:08.940> can<00:00:09.120> very<00:00:09.330> easily<00:00:09.570> drag<00:00:10.110> and

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
right so that I can very easily drag and

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:16.099 
right so that I can very easily drag and
drop<00:00:10.650> once<00:00:11.610> I<00:00:11.820> have<00:00:12.179> things<00:00:13.139> established<00:00:15.109> now

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
drop once I have things established now

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.670 
drop once I have things established now
let's<00:00:16.980> say<00:00:17.250> I<00:00:17.279> wanted<00:00:17.820> to<00:00:17.880> come<00:00:18.420> up<00:00:18.500> after<00:00:19.500> I've

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
let's say I wanted to come up after I've

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.820 
let's say I wanted to come up after I've
done<00:00:19.949> some<00:00:20.189> of<00:00:20.340> this<00:00:20.810> with<00:00:21.810> a<00:00:22.080> hierarchical

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
done some of this with a hierarchical

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.120 
relationship with things or I already
see<00:00:26.130> kind<00:00:26.580> of<00:00:26.730> a<00:00:27.029> hierarchical<00:00:27.810> relationship

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.130 
see kind of a hierarchical relationship

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.150 
see kind of a hierarchical relationship
amongst<00:00:29.130> concepts<00:00:29.699> than<00:00:30.090> I'm<00:00:30.240> coding<00:00:30.630> I<00:00:31.160> can

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
amongst concepts than I'm coding I can

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.540 
amongst concepts than I'm coding I can
use<00:00:32.399> tree<00:00:32.880> nodes<00:00:33.120> to<00:00:33.960> deal<00:00:34.140> with<00:00:34.350> that<00:00:34.530> a<00:00:34.770> tree

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
use tree nodes to deal with that a tree

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.090 
use tree nodes to deal with that a tree
nodes<00:00:35.760> are<00:00:36.000> used<00:00:36.270> for<00:00:36.630> kind<00:00:37.050> of<00:00:37.170> focused

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100

coding whatever you want to call it and

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:46.850 
coding whatever you want to call it and
that's<00:00:45.239> when<00:00:45.510> you<00:00:45.629> start<00:00:45.870> piecing<00:00:46.140> open

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
that's when you start piecing open

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.760 
that's when you start piecing open
coding<00:00:47.730> or<00:00:47.940> first<00:00:48.780> pass<00:00:49.050> coding<00:00:49.469> things

coding or first pass coding things

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.760 
coding or first pass coding things
together<00:00:50.010> so<00:00:50.670> you<00:00:50.730> can<00:00:51.059> paste<00:00:51.770> those

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
together so you can paste those

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.790 
together so you can paste those
unstructured<00:00:53.660> unrelated<00:00:54.660> nodes<00:00:54.899> into<00:00:55.559> some

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
unstructured unrelated nodes into some

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.250 
unstructured unrelated nodes into some
broader<00:00:56.100> categories<00:00:56.910> but<00:00:57.660> you<00:00:57.719> can<00:00:57.840> also<00:00:57.960> do

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
broader categories but you can also do

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.010 
broader categories but you can also do
some<00:00:58.590> of<00:00:58.620> that<00:00:58.739> on<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.100> fly<00:00:59.309> as<00:00:59.550> you<00:00:59.670> go<00:00:59.820> along

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020 
some of that on the fly as you go along

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.670 
some of that on the fly as you go along
so<00:01:01.020> for<00:01:01.800> instance<00:01:02.190> I<00:01:02.449> might<00:01:03.449> come<00:01:03.750> up<00:01:03.930> with<00:01:04.170> the

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
so for instance I might come up with the

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.649 
so for instance I might come up with the
idea<00:01:05.040> of<00:01:05.990> you<00:01:06.990> know<00:01:07.220> gosh<00:01:08.220> there's<00:01:09.119> probably

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
idea of you know gosh there's probably

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.600 
idea of you know gosh there's probably
going<00:01:10.049> to<00:01:10.140> be<00:01:10.229> a<00:01:10.260> whole<00:01:10.560> bunch<00:01:10.770> of<00:01:10.890> codes<00:01:11.430> that

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
going to be a whole bunch of codes that

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.649 
going to be a whole bunch of codes that
go<00:01:11.939> with<00:01:12.290> student<00:01:13.290> reactions<00:01:14.090> and<00:01:15.090> so<00:01:15.390> what

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
go with student reactions and so what

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.440 
go with student reactions and so what
are<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:16.200> types<00:01:16.560> of<00:01:16.770> student<00:01:17.340> reactions<00:01:18.240> well

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
are the types of student reactions well

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.670 
are the types of student reactions well
those<00:01:18.600> can<00:01:18.750> be<00:01:18.810> sub<00:01:19.670> codes<00:01:20.670> underneath<00:01:21.330> or

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
those can be sub codes underneath or

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.300 
those can be sub codes underneath or
children<00:01:22.680> of<00:01:22.710> a<00:01:23.490> broader<00:01:23.909> code<00:01:24.270> so<00:01:25.110> here<00:01:25.680> we

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
children of a broader code so here we

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.830 
children of a broader code so here we
have<00:01:26.640> a<00:01:27.060> type<00:01:27.689> of<00:01:28.280> reaction<00:01:29.280> so<00:01:30.060> I'm<00:01:30.630> gonna

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
have a type of reaction so I'm gonna

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.069 
have a type of reaction so I'm gonna
just<00:01:31.140> right<00:01:31.380> click<00:01:31.740> entry<00:01:32.340> notes<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:32.939> hit<00:01:33.659> new

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
just right click entry notes and hit new

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.609 
just right click entry notes and hit new
tree<00:01:34.380> node<00:01:34.790> what<00:01:35.790> is<00:01:35.909> its<00:01:36.090> name<00:01:36.329> it's<00:01:37.170> going<00:01:37.380> to

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
tree node what is its name it's going to

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.200 
tree node what is its name it's going to
be<00:01:38.540> reactions<00:01:40.430> again<00:01:41.430> you<00:01:41.610> can<00:01:41.729> always<00:01:41.850> change

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
be reactions again you can always change

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.179 
be reactions again you can always change
the<00:01:42.390> name<00:01:42.689> of<00:01:42.720> stuff<00:01:44.869> you<00:01:45.869> know<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:46.560> if<00:01:46.979> I

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
the name of stuff you know and and if I

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.010 
the name of stuff you know and and if I
think<00:01:47.250> about<00:01:47.520> it<00:01:47.850> is<00:01:48.479> it<00:01:48.750> going<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:48.930> be

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
think about it is it going to be

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.510 
think about it is it going to be
reactions<00:01:49.909> this<00:01:50.909> could<00:01:51.180> be<00:01:51.360> reactions<00:01:52.520> to

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
reactions this could be reactions to

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:01.999 
reactions this could be reactions to
other<00:01:55.070> students<00:01:57.200> so<00:01:58.200> I<00:02:00.740> can<00:02:01.740> give<00:02:01.890> it

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
other students so I can give it

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.740 
other students so I can give it
nicknames<00:02:02.430> I<00:02:02.670> can<00:02:02.790> do<00:02:02.909> all<00:02:03.060> sorts<00:02:03.540> of<00:02:03.600> other

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
nicknames I can do all sorts of other

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.139 
nicknames I can do all sorts of other
stuff<00:02:03.869> but<00:02:04.350> really<00:02:04.469> you<00:02:04.890> know<00:02:05.040> that's<00:02:06.030> helpful

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
stuff but really you know that's helpful

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.819 
stuff but really you know that's helpful
when<00:02:06.479> you're<00:02:06.600> doing<00:02:06.840> very<00:02:07.049> big<00:02:07.290> stuff<00:02:07.560> or

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
when you're doing very big stuff or

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.400 
when you're doing very big stuff or
you've<00:02:07.979> gotten<00:02:08.220> more<00:02:08.520> facile<00:02:09.030> with<00:02:09.179> this<00:02:09.410> but

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
you've gotten more facile with this but

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.309 
you've gotten more facile with this but
if<00:02:10.560> you're<00:02:10.739> not<00:02:10.890> just<00:02:11.430> give<00:02:11.760> it<00:02:11.910> a<00:02:12.090> regular<00:02:12.360> day

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
if you're not just give it a regular day

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.660 
if you're not just give it a regular day
so<00:02:13.709> I<00:02:13.980> created<00:02:14.730> a<00:02:14.909> new<00:02:15.200> node<00:02:16.200> I<00:02:16.560> have<00:02:16.920> this<00:02:17.280> text

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
so I created a new node I have this text

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.649 
so I created a new node I have this text
selected<00:02:18.150> I<00:02:18.590> can<00:02:19.590> go<00:02:19.769> and<00:02:20.069> move<00:02:20.969> it<00:02:21.120> over<00:02:21.299> and

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:21.659 
selected I can go and move it over and

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:24.949 
selected I can go and move it over and
drag<00:02:22.260> and<00:02:22.620> drop<00:02:22.829> and<00:02:23.489> now<00:02:23.760> reactions<00:02:24.719> to<00:02:24.810> other

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
drag and drop and now reactions to other

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:33.309 
drag and drop and now reactions to other
students<00:02:26.629> will<00:02:27.629> be<00:02:27.780> part<00:02:28.019> of<00:02:28.079> the<00:02:28.200> coding<00:02:28.500> and

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:36.649 

it<00:02:34.319> should<00:02:34.590> show<00:02:35.370> up<00:02:35.400> as<00:02:35.760> it<00:02:35.909> does<00:02:36.090> under<00:02:36.120> tree

00:02:36.649 --> 00:02:36.659 
it should show up as it does under tree

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:40.670 
it should show up as it does under tree
notes<00:02:36.870> now<00:02:38.329> here<00:02:39.329> this<00:02:39.810> is<00:02:39.870> one<00:02:40.230> kind<00:02:40.470> of

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
notes now here this is one kind of

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.319 
notes now here this is one kind of
reaction<00:02:41.189> to<00:02:41.400> another<00:02:41.670> student

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:42.329 
reaction to another student

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:44.539 
reaction to another student
it<00:02:42.599> could<00:02:42.719> be<00:02:42.810> intellectual<00:02:43.530> reactions<00:02:44.189> there

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
it could be intellectual reactions there

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:47.509 
it could be intellectual reactions there
could<00:02:44.730> be<00:02:44.760> emotional<00:02:45.359> reactions<00:02:46.280> there<00:02:47.280> can

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
could be emotional reactions there can

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:50.089 
could be emotional reactions there can
be<00:02:47.549> you<00:02:48.030> know<00:02:48.120> arguing<00:02:48.900> we<00:02:49.620> could<00:02:49.769> do<00:02:49.920> all

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.099 
be you know arguing we could do all

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:52.220 
be you know arguing we could do all
sorts<00:02:50.129> of<00:02:50.549> stuff<00:02:50.659> but<00:02:51.659> it<00:02:51.780> seems<00:02:51.930> to<00:02:52.079> me<00:02:52.200> that

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
sorts of stuff but it seems to me that

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.589 
sorts of stuff but it seems to me that
this<00:02:52.560> is<00:02:52.620> certainly<00:02:53.310> a<00:02:53.730> kind<00:02:54.000> of<00:02:54.150> emotional

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
this is certainly a kind of emotional

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:57.740 
this is certainly a kind of emotional
reaction<00:02:55.139> to<00:02:55.290> another<00:02:55.560> student<00:02:55.950> and<00:02:56.909> so<00:02:57.209> I<00:02:57.269> can

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
reaction to another student and so I can

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:04.819 
reaction to another student and so I can
do<00:02:58.049> a<00:02:58.459> new<00:02:59.459> tree<00:03:00.060> node<00:03:00.439> and<00:03:03.139> when<00:03:04.139> I<00:03:04.169> click<00:03:04.590> on

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:04.829 
do a new tree node and when I click on

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:08.059 
do a new tree node and when I click on
that<00:03:05.370> tree<00:03:05.970> know<00:03:06.120> that<00:03:06.329> I<00:03:06.359> already<00:03:06.540> had<00:03:07.069> and

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
that tree know that I already had and

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:09.740 
that tree know that I already had and
create<00:03:08.639> a<00:03:08.669> new<00:03:08.849> tree<00:03:09.090> node<00:03:09.239> it<00:03:09.389> actually

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
create a new tree node it actually

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.390 
create a new tree node it actually
creates<00:03:10.019> it<00:03:10.109> as<00:03:10.230> a<00:03:10.260> child<00:03:10.650> you<00:03:10.889> can<00:03:11.040> see<00:03:11.280> it

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
creates it as a child you can see it

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.819 
creates it as a child you can see it
under<00:03:11.669> the<00:03:11.760> hierarchy<00:03:12.239> tree<00:03:12.540> nodes<00:03:12.829> reaction

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:13.829 
under the hierarchy tree nodes reaction

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:15.199 
under the hierarchy tree nodes reaction
to<00:03:13.919> other<00:03:14.040> students<00:03:14.579> and<00:03:14.700> now<00:03:14.879> it's<00:03:15.060> going<00:03:15.180> to

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
to other students and now it's going to

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.030 
to other students and now it's going to
be<00:03:15.359> underneath<00:03:15.629> that<00:03:15.959> and<00:03:16.500> this<00:03:16.680> is<00:03:16.829> going<00:03:16.980> to

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
be underneath that and this is going to

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:30.860 
be underneath that and this is going to
be<00:03:17.989> emotional<00:03:21.500> memories<00:03:27.590> and<00:03:29.359> now<00:03:30.359> that<00:03:30.599> node

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
be emotional memories and now that node

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.309 
be emotional memories and now that node
is<00:03:31.019> going<00:03:31.169> to<00:03:31.379> appear<00:03:31.650> under<00:03:31.919> it<00:03:33.319> emotional

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319 
is going to appear under it emotional

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:39.379 
is going to appear under it emotional
memories<00:03:35.870> and<00:03:36.870> so<00:03:37.199> I<00:03:37.500> can<00:03:37.769> go<00:03:37.949> and<00:03:38.220> drag<00:03:39.090> and

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:39.389 
memories and so I can go and drag and

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:40.849 
memories and so I can go and drag and
click<00:03:39.569> this<00:03:39.750> into<00:03:40.169> emotional<00:03:40.530> memories

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:40.859 
click this into emotional memories

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:42.379 
click this into emotional memories
notice<00:03:41.159> I've<00:03:41.310> coded<00:03:41.519> this<00:03:41.699> at<00:03:41.879> four<00:03:42.090> places

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:42.389 
notice I've coded this at four places

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:45.140 
notice I've coded this at four places
the<00:03:42.930> exact<00:03:43.319> same<00:03:43.560> text<00:03:44.040> you<00:03:44.579> may<00:03:44.699> want<00:03:44.940> to<00:03:45.000> do

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
the exact same text you may want to do

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.140 
the exact same text you may want to do
that<00:03:45.359> and<00:03:45.599> and<00:03:46.109> really<00:03:46.470> in<00:03:46.919> the<00:03:47.010> early<00:03:47.609> process

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
that and and really in the early process

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.899 
that and and really in the early process
you<00:03:49.079> want<00:03:49.169> to<00:03:49.260> just<00:03:49.440> go<00:03:49.979> with<00:03:50.010> the<00:03:50.190> flow<00:03:50.459> and

00:03:50.899 --> 00:03:50.909 
you want to just go with the flow and

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:53.149 
you want to just go with the flow and
you<00:03:51.569> know<00:03:51.659> let<00:03:52.049> your<00:03:52.199> imagination<00:03:52.859> go<00:03:52.979> all

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:53.159 
you know let your imagination go all

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:56.569 
you know let your imagination go all
over<00:03:53.190> the<00:03:53.459> place<00:03:53.870> so<00:03:54.870> now<00:03:55.260> I<00:03:55.650> have<00:03:56.099> it<00:03:56.280> as<00:03:56.430> a

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:56.579 
over the place so now I have it as a

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:58.580 
over the place so now I have it as a
child<00:03:56.879> notice<00:03:57.569> that<00:03:57.720> it's<00:03:57.900> listed<00:03:58.319> underneath

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
child notice that it's listed underneath

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.789 
child notice that it's listed underneath
that<00:03:58.979> you<00:03:59.729> can<00:03:59.879> expand<00:04:00.449> or<00:04:00.750> contract<00:04:01.079> the

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 
that you can expand or contract the

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:04.819 
that you can expand or contract the
trees<00:04:02.540> based<00:04:03.540> on<00:04:03.750> this<00:04:03.930> plus<00:04:04.169> or<00:04:04.349> minus<00:04:04.650> sign

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:04.829 
trees based on this plus or minus sign

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:07.129 
trees based on this plus or minus sign
over<00:04:04.889> here<00:04:05.189> clicking<00:04:05.879> on<00:04:06.000> it<00:04:06.180> but<00:04:06.810> now<00:04:06.900> we<00:04:06.930> have

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:07.139 
over here clicking on it but now we have

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:08.689 
over here clicking on it but now we have
emotional<00:04:07.620> memories<00:04:08.010> as<00:04:08.159> one<00:04:08.340> kind<00:04:08.549> of

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:08.699 
emotional memories as one kind of

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:11.780 
emotional memories as one kind of
reactions<00:04:09.180> to<00:04:09.449> other<00:04:09.840> students<00:04:10.459> and<00:04:11.459> we<00:04:11.609> see

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
reactions to other students and we see

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.420 
reactions to other students and we see
that<00:04:11.939> there<00:04:12.349> you<00:04:13.349> can<00:04:13.560> put<00:04:13.769> all<00:04:13.919> sorts<00:04:14.189> of

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
that there you can put all sorts of

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.460 
that there you can put all sorts of
interesting<00:04:15.120> you<00:04:15.449> know<00:04:15.569> hierarchies<00:04:16.139> here

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
interesting you know hierarchies here

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.870 
interesting you know hierarchies here
and<00:04:16.650> and<00:04:17.130> play<00:04:17.370> with<00:04:17.579> it<00:04:18.139> you<00:04:19.139> can<00:04:19.320> also<00:04:19.880> play

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
and and play with it you can also play

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.120 
and and play with it you can also play
with<00:04:20.909> cases<00:04:21.599> or<00:04:21.810> relationships<00:04:22.529> or<00:04:22.740> matrices

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
all sorts of stuff in the same way

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:29.530 
all sorts of stuff in the same way
you<00:04:26.750> right-click<00:04:27.320> in<00:04:27.590> the<00:04:27.650> space<00:04:28.130> if<00:04:29.120> I<00:04:29.300> want<00:04:29.480> a

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:29.540 
you right-click in the space if I want a

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.420 
you right-click in the space if I want a
neutrino<00:04:29.930> not<00:04:30.260> related<00:04:30.740> to<00:04:30.770> this<00:04:31.010> one<00:04:31.220> for

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
neutrino not related to this one for

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:32.890 
neutrino not related to this one for
instance<00:04:31.520> then<00:04:32.090> I<00:04:32.180> need<00:04:32.330> to<00:04:32.360> click<00:04:32.600> somewhere

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
instance then I need to click somewhere

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.440 
instance then I need to click somewhere
that<00:04:33.140> it<00:04:33.380> isn't<00:04:33.830> and<00:04:34.040> it<00:04:34.700> will<00:04:34.880> put<00:04:35.120> it<00:04:35.150> at<00:04:35.330> the

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:35.450 
that it isn't and it will put it at the

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:38.740 
that it isn't and it will put it at the
highest<00:04:35.690> level<00:04:36.200> of<00:04:36.380> the<00:04:37.040> hierarchy<00:04:37.600> but<00:04:38.600> this

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
highest level of the hierarchy but this

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.710 
highest level of the hierarchy but this
is<00:04:38.900> just<00:04:39.080> another<00:04:39.790> simple<00:04:40.790> way<00:04:40.940> to<00:04:41.000> code<00:04:41.450> and

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720 
is just another simple way to code and

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.550 
is just another simple way to code and
that's<00:04:42.500> making<00:04:43.100> those<00:04:43.280> tree<00:04:43.550> nodes<00:04:44.290> let's<00:04:45.290> say

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
that's making those tree nodes let's say

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.880 
that's making those tree nodes let's say
I<00:04:45.590> wanted<00:04:46.190> to<00:04:46.250> put<00:04:46.490> something<00:04:47.090> that<00:04:47.570> I<00:04:47.600> have<00:04:48.050> in

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:48.890 
I wanted to put something that I have in

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:50.680 
I wanted to put something that I have in
a<00:04:49.070> free<00:04:49.400> node<00:04:49.580> under<00:04:49.910> a<00:04:50.090> tree<00:04:50.330> node

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:50.690 
a free node under a tree node

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:54.840 
a free node under a tree node
well<00:04:51.490> maybe<00:04:52.490> digging<00:04:52.970> up<00:04:53.090> the<00:04:53.270> past<00:04:53.300> is<00:04:53.930> a

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:54.850 
well maybe digging up the past is a

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:59.290 
well maybe digging up the past is a
child<00:04:55.850> of<00:04:56.270> that<00:04:57.110> emotional<00:04:57.800> reaction<00:04:58.270> so<00:04:59.270> I

00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.300 
child of that emotional reaction so I

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.730 
child of that emotional reaction so I
can<00:04:59.630> take<00:04:59.840> this<00:05:00.080> I<00:05:00.380> can<00:05:01.540> cut<00:05:02.540> or<00:05:02.750> copy<00:05:03.050> I<00:05:03.230> prefer

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:03.740 
can take this I can cut or copy I prefer

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.010 
can take this I can cut or copy I prefer
copying<00:05:04.400> things<00:05:04.790> so<00:05:05.180> that<00:05:05.330> there's<00:05:05.570> always<00:05:05.810> a

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
copying things so that there's always a

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:10.210 
copying things so that there's always a
second<00:05:06.890> place<00:05:07.730> in<00:05:07.940> it<00:05:08.090> and<00:05:08.860> then<00:05:09.860> if<00:05:09.950> I<00:05:10.040> go<00:05:10.190> to

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:10.220 
second place in it and then if I go to

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.760 
second place in it and then if I go to
tree<00:05:10.520> nodes<00:05:11.050> click<00:05:12.050> on<00:05:12.200> where<00:05:12.410> I<00:05:12.440> want<00:05:12.710> to

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:12.770 
tree nodes click on where I want to

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:16.750 
tree nodes click on where I want to
paste<00:05:12.950> it<00:05:13.220> under<00:05:14.020> emotional<00:05:15.020> memories<00:05:15.380> I<00:05:15.760> can

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:16.760 
paste it under emotional memories I can

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:21.250 
paste it under emotional memories I can
either<00:05:17.410> merge<00:05:18.410> it<00:05:18.560> into<00:05:18.710> a<00:05:18.830> new<00:05:19.070> child<00:05:19.430> node<00:05:20.260> or

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:21.260 
either merge it into a new child node or

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.440 
either merge it into a new child node or
merge<00:05:21.590> it<00:05:21.710> into<00:05:21.950> the<00:05:22.040> selected<00:05:22.550> node<00:05:22.730> I<00:05:23.000> want

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:23.450 
merge it into the selected node I want

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:27.520 
merge it into the selected node I want
it<00:05:23.540> into<00:05:23.870> a<00:05:23.900> new<00:05:24.140> child<00:05:24.440> node<00:05:26.260> merges<00:05:27.260> tree

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:27.530 
it into a new child node merges tree

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:30.700 
it into a new child node merges tree
node<00:05:27.680> yes<00:05:27.980> and<00:05:28.900> it<00:05:29.900> says<00:05:30.110> well<00:05:30.320> do<00:05:30.410> you<00:05:30.470> want<00:05:30.650> to

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:30.710 
node yes and it says well do you want to

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:32.080 
node yes and it says well do you want to
keep<00:05:30.830> all<00:05:31.010> the<00:05:31.130> things<00:05:31.160> that<00:05:31.490> were<00:05:31.610> selected

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:32.090 
keep all the things that were selected

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:35.110 
keep all the things that were selected
with<00:05:32.120> it<00:05:32.390> sure<00:05:33.250> and<00:05:34.250> what<00:05:34.550> do<00:05:34.610> we<00:05:34.670> want<00:05:34.760> to<00:05:34.940> call

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:35.120 
with it sure and what do we want to call

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:46.450 
with it sure and what do we want to call
this<00:05:35.410> pigs<00:05:37.000> memories<00:05:41.770> you<00:05:42.770> do<00:05:42.920> this<00:05:44.950> and<00:05:45.950> I've

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:46.460 
this pigs memories you do this and I've

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:51.490 
this pigs memories you do this and I've
gone<00:05:46.700> and<00:05:47.120> I've<00:05:47.500> copied<00:05:50.500> something

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:51.500 
gone and I've copied something

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.700 
gone and I've copied something
underneath<00:05:52.330> emotional<00:05:53.330> memories<00:05:53.720> from<00:05:54.560> my

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:54.710 
underneath emotional memories from my

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:56.350 
underneath emotional memories from my
tree<00:05:54.920> nodes<00:05:55.100> and<00:05:55.400> so<00:05:55.580> you<00:05:55.640> can<00:05:55.880> merge<00:05:56.060> things

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:56.360 
tree nodes and so you can merge things

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:01.210 
tree nodes and so you can merge things
together<00:05:58.330> and<00:05:59.330> I<00:05:59.840> can<00:06:00.140> could<00:06:00.650> have<00:06:00.800> pasted

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:01.220 
together and I can could have pasted

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.430 
together and I can could have pasted
that<00:06:01.250> and<00:06:01.640> just<00:06:01.940> merge<00:06:02.240> the<00:06:02.510> two<00:06:02.720> things<00:06:03.050> into

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:03.440 
that and just merge the two things into

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.860 
that and just merge the two things into
the<00:06:03.530> broader<00:06:03.770> concept<00:06:04.370> but<00:06:05.240> in<00:06:05.360> this<00:06:05.480> case<00:06:05.690> I

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:05.870 
the broader concept but in this case I

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:08.370 
the broader concept but in this case I
kept<00:06:06.110> it<00:06:06.230> as<00:06:06.350> its<00:06:06.560> own<00:06:06.740> thing<00:06:06.850> underneath<00:06:07.850> and

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:08.380 
kept it as its own thing underneath and

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:12.730 
kept it as its own thing underneath and
that<00:06:09.380> is<00:06:09.620> how<00:06:09.800> you<00:06:09.860> can<00:06:10.100> use<00:06:10.130> tree<00:06:10.550> nodes
