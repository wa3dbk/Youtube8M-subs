00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.710 

there's<00:02:41.280> a<00:02:41.370> lot<00:02:41.580> floating<00:02:42.000> around<00:02:42.090> the<00:02:42.360> edges

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
there's a lot floating around the edges

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.230 
there's a lot floating around the edges
but<00:02:42.959> there's<00:02:43.140> also<00:02:43.550> even<00:02:44.550> more<00:02:44.580> down<00:02:45.000> at<00:02:45.150> the

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
but there's also even more down at the

more<00:03:05.100> down<00:03:05.280> there<00:03:05.459> on<00:03:05.580> the<00:03:05.610> bottom

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:36.070 

I<00:03:31.010> think<00:03:31.520> it's<00:03:31.640> a<00:03:31.700> swords<00:03:32.060> form

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.080 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:42.670 

look<00:03:36.650> at<00:03:36.740> that<00:03:36.830> Pelican<00:03:37.100> opera<00:03:37.460> and<00:03:41.470> a<00:03:42.470> good

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
look at that Pelican opera and a good

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:50.960 
look at that Pelican opera and a good
size<00:03:42.920> on

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.820 

I'm<00:03:51.330> still<00:03:51.600> alive<00:03:51.780> he's<00:03:52.080> just<00:03:52.230> barely<00:03:52.470> kicking

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830 
I'm still alive he's just barely kicking

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:58.850 
I'm still alive he's just barely kicking
and<00:03:53.130> moving<00:03:53.400> around<00:03:57.380> it<00:03:58.380> looks<00:03:58.560> like<00:03:58.710> it's

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
and moving around it looks like it's

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.230 
and moving around it looks like it's
kind<00:03:59.010> of<00:03:59.130> the<00:03:59.220> wind<00:03:59.460> but<00:03:59.700> you<00:03:59.760> can<00:03:59.940> see<00:04:00.120> his

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:00.240 
kind of the wind but you can see his

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.560 
kind of the wind but you can see his
tail<00:04:00.480> still<00:04:01.550> still<00:04:02.550> kicking<00:04:03.030> just<00:04:03.210> moving

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
tail still still kicking just moving

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:11.270 
tail still still kicking just moving
around<00:04:03.690> barely<00:04:04.410> I<00:04:04.620> guess<00:04:05.070> it's<00:04:09.950> one<00:04:10.950> force

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
around barely I guess it's one force

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.410 
around barely I guess it's one force
that<00:04:11.340> I<00:04:11.490> don't<00:04:11.670> think<00:04:11.820> it's<00:04:11.940> going<00:04:12.060> to<00:04:12.090> heat<00:04:12.300> up

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
that I don't think it's going to heat up

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.290 
that I don't think it's going to heat up
for<00:04:12.570> the<00:04:12.660> next<00:04:12.900> few<00:04:13.080> days
