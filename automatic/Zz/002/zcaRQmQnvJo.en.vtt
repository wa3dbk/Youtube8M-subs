00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
battery and then on this end over here

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.150 
battery and then on this end over here
the<00:02:56.160> bottom<00:02:56.520> part<00:02:56.790> actually<00:02:57.060> unscrews<00:02:58.160> I'm

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
the bottom part actually unscrews I'm

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.010 
the bottom part actually unscrews I'm
not<00:02:59.310> exactly<00:02:59.550> sure<00:02:59.760> why<00:03:00.270> you'd<00:03:00.510> need<00:03:00.810> this

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
not exactly sure why you'd need this

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.590 
not exactly sure why you'd need this
just<00:03:01.740> basically<00:03:01.980> exposes<00:03:02.820> the<00:03:02.970> bottom<00:03:03.360> half

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
just basically exposes the bottom half

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.720 
just basically exposes the bottom half
of<00:03:03.840> the<00:03:04.020> battery

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
of the battery

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.060 
of the battery
I<00:03:05.760> guess<00:03:06.510> that's<00:03:06.780> so<00:03:06.990> you<00:03:07.050> can<00:03:07.140> replace<00:03:07.740> the

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
I guess that's so you can replace the

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.640 
I guess that's so you can replace the
battery<00:03:08.220> if<00:03:08.640> you<00:03:09.030> need<00:03:09.210> to<00:03:09.420> but<00:03:09.840> I<00:03:10.110> really

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
battery if you need to but I really

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.470 
battery if you need to but I really
don't<00:03:10.740> see<00:03:10.860> that<00:03:11.190> you<00:03:11.280> need<00:03:11.430> to<00:03:11.580> would<00:03:12.270> ever

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
don't see that you need to would ever

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.370 
don't see that you need to would ever
need<00:03:12.690> to<00:03:12.810> do<00:03:12.930> that<00:03:13.250> okay<00:03:14.300> and<00:03:15.300> it<00:03:15.420> also<00:03:15.600> has<00:03:16.110> two

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
need to do that okay and it also has two

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.410 
need to do that okay and it also has two
little<00:03:16.560> LED<00:03:17.100> indicator<00:03:17.610> lights<00:03:17.820> underneath

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
little LED indicator lights underneath

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.580 
little LED indicator lights underneath
underneath<00:03:19.380> this<00:03:20.100> plastic<00:03:20.370> ring<00:03:21.080> one<00:03:22.080> is<00:03:22.320> red

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
underneath this plastic ring one is red

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.470 
underneath this plastic ring one is red
and<00:03:22.770> one<00:03:22.920> is<00:03:23.040> blue<00:03:23.250> so<00:03:23.580> when<00:03:23.850> it's<00:03:23.970> red<00:03:24.240> that

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
and one is blue so when it's red that

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.060 
and one is blue so when it's red that
means<00:03:24.660> it's<00:03:25.020> charging<00:03:25.350> and<00:03:25.620> when<00:03:25.770> it's<00:03:25.890> blue

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
means it's charging and when it's blue

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:30.050 
means it's charging and when it's blue
it<00:03:26.280> means<00:03:26.460> it's<00:03:26.640> done<00:03:26.850> charging<00:03:28.880> now<00:03:29.880> let<00:03:30.000> me

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
it means it's done charging now let me

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.950 
it means it's done charging now let me
go<00:03:30.180> ahead<00:03:30.300> and<00:03:30.390> give<00:03:30.480> a<00:03:30.510> quick<00:03:30.750> demonstration

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:30.960 
go ahead and give a quick demonstration

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.010 
go ahead and give a quick demonstration
of<00:03:31.650> how<00:03:31.860> it<00:03:31.890> will<00:03:32.310> charge<00:03:32.610> your<00:03:32.790> device<00:03:33.090> for

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:34.020 
of how it will charge your device for

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:35.330 
of how it will charge your device for
that<00:03:34.140> I'm<00:03:34.290> just<00:03:34.350> going<00:03:34.650> to<00:03:34.680> demonstrate<00:03:34.830> an

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
that I'm just going to demonstrate an
