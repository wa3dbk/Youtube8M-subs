up and a lot of questions that arise

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.230 
up and a lot of questions that arise
that<00:01:52.069> they<00:01:52.280> just<00:01:52.549> know<00:01:52.700> the<00:01:52.850> answers<00:01:53.209> to

because they buy and sell businesses for
a<00:01:55.939> living<00:01:56.209> I<00:01:56.479> would<00:01:57.020> say<00:01:57.259> that<00:01:57.500> the<00:01:57.590> biggest

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
a living I would say that the biggest

a living I would say that the biggest
obstacle<00:01:58.429> I<00:01:58.520> think<00:01:58.759> that<00:01:58.970> sunbelt<00:01:59.509> helped<00:01:59.869> us

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:00.049 
obstacle I think that sunbelt helped us

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:05.050 
obstacle I think that sunbelt helped us
avoid<00:02:00.610> was<00:02:02.560> letting<00:02:03.560> us<00:02:03.679> know<00:02:03.709> and<00:02:04.280> informing

avoid was letting us know and informing
us<00:02:05.209> that<00:02:05.240> this<00:02:05.479> type<00:02:05.720> of<00:02:05.750> negotiation<00:02:06.590> is

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
us that this type of negotiation is

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.309 
us that this type of negotiation is
peculiar<00:02:07.729> to<00:02:07.759> the<00:02:08.390> selling<00:02:08.780> and<00:02:08.869> buying<00:02:09.019> of<00:02:09.259> a

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
peculiar to the selling and buying of a

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:12.970 
peculiar to the selling and buying of a
business<00:02:09.530> it's<00:02:09.979> hugely<00:02:10.280> emotionally
