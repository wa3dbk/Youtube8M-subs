let's<00:03:09.959> see<00:03:10.280> your<00:03:11.280> input<00:03:11.670> method<00:03:12.060> to<00:03:12.270> the<00:03:12.420> HTC

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 
let's see your input method to the HTC

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.820 
let's see your input method to the HTC
keyboard<00:03:14.850> it's<00:03:15.660> the<00:03:15.840> single<00:03:16.080> type<00:03:16.440> keyboard

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
keyboard it's the single type keyboard

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.370 
keyboard it's the single type keyboard
but<00:03:17.640> I<00:03:17.820> think<00:03:18.360> it's<00:03:18.480> pretty<00:03:18.630> good<00:03:18.750> keyboard<00:03:19.080> if

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
but I think it's pretty good keyboard if

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:24.050 
but I think it's pretty good keyboard if
you<00:03:19.500> don't<00:03:19.680> like<00:03:19.830> swype<00:03:22.489> so<00:03:23.489> let's<00:03:23.880> see<00:03:24.030> what

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
you don't like swype so let's see what

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.770 
you don't like swype so let's see what
else<00:03:24.239> is<00:03:24.510> there<00:03:24.660> um<00:03:25.100> the<00:03:26.100> GPS<00:03:26.610> is<00:03:26.790> fixed<00:03:27.180> I

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
else is there um the GPS is fixed I

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.860 
else is there um the GPS is fixed I
didn't<00:03:28.530> install<00:03:28.799> any<00:03:29.120> applications<00:03:30.120> here<00:03:30.570> so

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
didn't install any applications here so

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.190 
didn't install any applications here so
i<00:03:30.900> can't<00:03:31.769> really<00:03:31.860> verify<00:03:32.250> that<00:03:32.730> but<00:03:33.060> i<00:03:33.299> tried

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
i can't really verify that but i tried

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.870 
i can't really verify that but i tried
it<00:03:34.230> on<00:03:34.410> my<00:03:34.590> other<00:03:34.739> vibrant<00:03:35.370> it<00:03:35.430> works<00:03:35.640> pretty

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
it on my other vibrant it works pretty

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.360 
it on my other vibrant it works pretty
pretty<00:03:36.540> fine<00:03:36.840> with<00:03:37.260> the<00:03:37.410> update<00:03:37.769> one<00:03:38.010> so<00:03:38.340> i

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
pretty fine with the update one so i

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.460 
pretty fine with the update one so i
imagine<00:03:38.760> it<00:03:39.090> would<00:03:39.180> be<00:03:39.360> better<00:03:39.570> with<00:03:39.900> the

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
imagine it would be better with the

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:45.289 
imagine it would be better with the
update<00:03:40.799> 3<00:03:41.299> so<00:03:43.250> let's<00:03:44.250> see<00:03:44.489> what<00:03:44.880> else<00:03:44.910> is<00:03:45.180> there

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299
