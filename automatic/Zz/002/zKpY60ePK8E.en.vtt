price<00:01:01.770> of<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.160> stock<00:01:02.220> plan<00:01:02.670> fee<00:01:02.940> you<00:01:03.690> could<00:01:03.870> also

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
price of a stock plan fee you could also

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.870 
price of a stock plan fee you could also
just<00:01:04.350> do<00:01:04.530> a<00:01:04.559> total<00:01:04.949> custom<00:01:05.309> plan<00:01:05.549> where<00:01:05.850> we

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
just do a total custom plan where we

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.270 
just do a total custom plan where we
take<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.450> just<00:01:06.630> start<00:01:06.900> from<00:01:07.049> scratch

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
take and just start from scratch

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.050 
take and just start from scratch
completely<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.310> then<00:01:08.430> that<00:01:08.610> would<00:01:08.759> be<00:01:08.850> more

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
completely and then that would be more

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.700

lumber<00:01:50.100> yards<00:01:50.490> or<00:01:50.639> a<00:01:50.939> big<00:01:51.420> box<00:01:51.659> store<00:01:51.899> like

lumber yards or a big box store like

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.580 
lumber yards or a big box store like
Lowe's<00:01:52.350> or<00:01:52.529> Home<00:01:52.590> Depot<00:01:53.270> so<00:01:54.270> but<00:01:55.229> they're<00:01:55.409> not

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
Lowe's or Home Depot so but they're not

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.469 
Lowe's or Home Depot so but they're not
like<00:01:55.979> what<00:01:56.159> you<00:01:56.279> would<00:01:56.369> build<00:01:56.670> out<00:01:56.880> in<00:01:57.240> the

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
like what you would build out in the

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.050 
like what you would build out in the
suburbs<00:01:57.719> so<00:01:58.709> if<00:01:59.069> a<00:01:59.219> builder's<00:01:59.579> used<00:01:59.759> to<00:01:59.850> just

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
suburbs so if a builder's used to just

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.609 
suburbs so if a builder's used to just
building<00:02:00.389> houses<00:02:00.600> in<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:00.929> suburbs<00:02:01.139> this

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
building houses in the suburbs this

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.109 
building houses in the suburbs this
might<00:02:01.829> throw<00:02:02.069> a<00:02:02.130> little<00:02:02.219> loop<00:02:02.639> he<00:02:02.850> would<00:02:02.999> just

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
might throw a little loop he would just

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.580 
might throw a little loop he would just
need<00:02:03.299> to<00:02:03.359> pay<00:02:03.509> attention<00:02:03.539> to<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:04.139> details

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
need to pay attention to the details

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.410 
need to pay attention to the details
more<00:02:04.920> because<00:02:05.609> it's<00:02:05.759> a<00:02:05.849> little<00:02:06.179> different

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
more because it's a little different

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.600 
more because it's a little different
arrangement<00:02:07.380> of<00:02:07.499> materials<00:02:08.099> to<00:02:08.250> get<00:02:08.399> that

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
arrangement of materials to get that

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.250

historic<00:02:09.240> feel<00:02:10.069> let's<00:02:11.069> go<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.370> next<00:02:11.670> section

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
historic feel let's go the next section

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.330 
historic feel let's go the next section
primarily<00:02:13.260> I<00:02:13.349> want<00:02:13.590> to<00:02:13.650> show<00:02:13.830> you<00:02:13.890> what<00:02:14.220> you

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
primarily I want to show you what you

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.470 
primarily I want to show you what you
get<00:02:14.490> in<00:02:14.640> your<00:02:14.760> construction<00:02:15.300> drawings

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
get in your construction drawings

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.030 
get in your construction drawings
sometimes<00:02:16.080> you<00:02:16.290> know<00:02:16.380> construction<00:02:16.920> drawings

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
sometimes you know construction drawings

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.740 
sometimes you know construction drawings
are<00:02:17.310> not

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
are not

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.230 
are not
equal<00:02:18.140> you<00:02:18.740> can<00:02:18.920> have<00:02:19.070> a<00:02:19.100> great<00:02:19.400> design<00:02:19.790> and

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
equal you can have a great design and

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.590 
equal you can have a great design and
then<00:02:20.360> maybe<00:02:20.540> the<00:02:20.750> designer<00:02:21.080> wasn't<00:02:21.530> as<00:02:22.600> had

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
then maybe the designer wasn't as had

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.240 
then maybe the designer wasn't as had
enough<00:02:23.870> technical<00:02:24.290> experience<00:02:24.680> to<00:02:25.130> really

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
enough technical experience to really

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.100 
enough technical experience to really
put<00:02:25.520> together<00:02:25.640> the<00:02:26.000> house<00:02:26.210> everybody<00:02:26.900> has<00:02:27.080> a

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
put together the house everybody has a

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.860 
put together the house everybody has a
different<00:02:27.320> level<00:02:27.770> of<00:02:27.890> experience<00:02:28.390> so<00:02:29.390> we<00:02:29.570> put

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
different level of experience so we put

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.840 
different level of experience so we put
a<00:02:29.900> lot<00:02:29.960> of<00:02:30.230> time<00:02:30.560> and<00:02:30.980> effort<00:02:31.370> into<00:02:31.670> our

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
a lot of time and effort into our

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.580 
a lot of time and effort into our
details<00:02:32.270> so<00:02:32.720> that<00:02:32.750> when<00:02:33.020> the<00:02:33.080> Builder<00:02:33.410> gets

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
details so that when the Builder gets

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.110 
details so that when the Builder gets
out<00:02:33.800> there<00:02:34.040> there's<00:02:34.280> least<00:02:34.760> amount<00:02:35.000> of

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
out there there's least amount of

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.699 
out there there's least amount of
problems<00:02:35.540> you<00:02:35.690> get<00:02:35.780> a<00:02:35.840> better<00:02:36.050> estimate<00:02:36.320> on

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
problems you get a better estimate on

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.090 
problems you get a better estimate on
your<00:02:36.860> drawings<00:02:37.400> and<00:02:38.320> less<00:02:39.320> guessing<00:02:39.950> and

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
your drawings and less guessing and

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.590 
your drawings and less guessing and
head-scratching<00:02:40.370> is<00:02:40.790> what<00:02:40.940> I<00:02:40.970> call<00:02:41.270> it<00:02:41.390> in<00:02:41.510> the

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
head-scratching is what I call it in the

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.320 
head-scratching is what I call it in the
field<00:02:41.870> so<00:02:42.740> most<00:02:43.490> of<00:02:43.550> the<00:02:43.610> plans<00:02:43.880> are<00:02:44.030> set<00:02:44.209> up

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.540 
field so most of the plans are set up
the<00:02:44.360> same<00:02:44.480> way<00:02:44.830> same<00:02:45.830> type<00:02:46.130> of<00:02:46.160> sheets
