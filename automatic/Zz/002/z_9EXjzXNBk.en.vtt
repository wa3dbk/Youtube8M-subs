00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.480
 hello we are on the showroom 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.000
 ephemeral of the bsh group in the company of 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.080
 celine deville trainer then these 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.810
 lines you are going to talk to us about the 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.630
 new range bosch series 8 of 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.699
 ovens my faith who are endowed with 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.630
 advice of a brand new design 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:26.130
 exactly so it's completely 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.119
 differentiating compared to oven bosch 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.890
 that you could know up to 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.900
 present so there the Toulouse was 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.360
 completely reworked especially with 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.320
 a new command strip that goes 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.880
 to be for some devices 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.829
 completely tactile we had to be that 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.200
 just press the functions 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.360
 to restart features 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.770
 of the device 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.719
 you also have here a ring 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.789
 central that will serve all your 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:51.539
 settings all your settings 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:53.250
 temperature you also have on this 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.219
 device in terms of design a new 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.050
 volume of defour a new quality with 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.489
 an interior volume of 71 beds so 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.129
 it is a very large capacity in term 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.589
 of volumes with four levels thanks 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.119
 precisely to 4d pulsed air technology 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.860
 that will allow leather out of four 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.420
 levels simultaneously and without 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.860
 recommendations of bleachers having 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.560
 always perfectly cooked 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:17.000
 uniform four levels I can not m 4.9 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.610
 4a temperatures at the same time 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.049
 you are a fervent lover of 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.259
 things macaroons pastry like 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.540
 it 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.470
 bake four different levels 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.000
 simultaneously 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.710
 that's what's allowed with the 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 important volume of this crazy volume 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.180
 important and especially precisely the 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.920
 4d rotating heat technology which 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.150
 was re parameterized to just have 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.829
 better heat distribution 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.710
 inside the quality then these 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.869
 lines this oven also helps to cook at 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.119
 steam and you have to show it 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.590
 how how today no 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.909
 only the big force to be made 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.799
 it's about being able to steam cure in 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.479
 a 60 cm oven 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.369
 steaming at bosch it's not 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.560
 again but it was my and make 45 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.090
 cm today we have the skin mentioned are 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.040
 size 60 ovens on full of 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.990
 simply steam here 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.210
 you press this little one of this little 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.880
 button is hidden behind the face 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.590
 dufour you have a steam tank 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.929
 of an ability of a myth that will you 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.550
 allow to steam 100% we have 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.160
 fear with all the benefits that are going 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.540
 with food with all their 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.340
 vitamins all their crunchy 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.069
 but you also have a policeman 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.600
 to have the steam add function that goes 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:25.500
 to allow not to desiccate 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.670
 your preparations like roast fish 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.500
 things like that that require an addition of 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.900
 steam how does it work I can my 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.400
 roasted and in the end actually when you 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.739
 go put your side you can him 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.239
 say to add steam to your 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:38.070
 preparation for having also been able to tend 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:39.900
 even on the programs 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.209
 automatic it will do it alone 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.250
 a combination a combination then he 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.510
 there is bread also one for those who 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.430
 want is apprentice baker and 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.330
 pastries also more and more 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.250
 people see there like to do their 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.720
 preparing only their mail pines 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.430
 is in preparation are thoroughly a little 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.720
 little complex you have today 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.950
 it's very good to follow here it is necessary 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.840
 to be very precise to pastry chefs 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.940
 does you have on this force range 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.319
 which is called the perfect bug sensor 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.489
 it's just a probe that's 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:04.739
 inside the cavity that is going 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:06.239
 measure the humidity level and who is going 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:08.160
 stop the madman when your 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:10.890
 pastry will be ready so no longer needed 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.690
 to plant the knife in the heart of the cake 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.489
 tell you about two probes 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.900
 it is an oven that is very accessorized 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:19.140
 and since just now I have in the 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:21.140
 hand cooking probe 1 it's the same 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.010
 we never know what temperature 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.570
 how to cook a preparation 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.860
 that we know for example a meat a 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.390
 roast beef so that they are bleeding to 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.310
 how much temperature brooms and 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.720
 bassett are cooking or there planted at 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.010
 heart of food and she will you 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.480
 to allow precisely after 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.190
 selected temperature at heart of 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.180
 stop when that temperature and 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.070
 hacker is reached 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.230
 but the peculiarity of this sequel 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.850
 at three points of measurement ie 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.170
 that even if you badly plant the probe at 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.670
 heart of your enemy you will be 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.980
 always guaranteed to have to perfect 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.180
 cooking results to conclude these 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.670
 lines we are still in front of the 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:53.040
 series 8 already we are seen in a 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.170
 other colors and then you wanted that 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.970
 we talk about his models to talk about 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.350
 harmony quite the particularity 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.459
 also from this new range of 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.870
 oven is power composed of 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:01.350
 perfect alignment between our different 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.470
 appliances 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:07.829
 here for example a 60 cm oven here a 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:10.739
 oven 45 cm 100% is scared or combined is 

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:12.209
 also below a heated drawer 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:14.220
 which will allow you to keep warm 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:14.580
 your preparations or also to make 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.670
 hot 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.810
 warm up your plates to have them at 

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:20.640
 temperature before putting your 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.770
 preparations inside then there we 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:24.870
 you had talked about the model a little star 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.880
 of the range which lies around 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:28.350
 2200 euros we are around 2000 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.610
 euros for this device we start to 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:32.100
 699 euros 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:34.200
 here and we can find them we have 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:37.530
 in the spring with martial and the 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:39.330
 here is always the pale sun and bah 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.890
 listen and celine we have all seen you 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.070
 is more than thank you thank you to 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:43.070
 food
