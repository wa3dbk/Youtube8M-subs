00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:07.799
 marginal of the three thousand and the neighbors 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.019
 Yesterday Antonio did not have a license 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.750

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.820

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.050
 gulfs there and I will take you 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.460
 It is clear that I know with him 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.900

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.880
 top 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.539
 and the fact is that of course if they arrived there 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:31.410
 and with the entourage there of criminals 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:33.989

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.410
 come on there was never any kind of 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.030
 problem 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.560
 and I was amazed and at the beginning 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.090
 I did not know the repercussion that I had in 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:49.710
 the world of golf 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.710

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:23.050
 I had handled a future magazine 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.340
 music and there was an editing program 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:29.609
 audio and I started 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.740

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:34.859

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.000

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:37.659

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.310
 colleagues and others 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:41.890

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.170
 a handsome voice stamp and upload it 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.850
 let's upload it and we were going to mess around 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.350
 to go partying and at a traffic light in 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.350
 the car I listen to in the next car 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.370
 and the worst thing was that when we got to the 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.460
 botellona there was another car that was 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:00.110
 much 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.420
 surrounded the notes with listening to my 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.770
 issues and then I had another friend who 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.409

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.600

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.690
 of the two and let me talk to him 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.670

 there were not with same dishes two or three 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:41.480
 Sometimes a colleague notes that he tells me and 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:44.630
 I can talk about it finally shopping for 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.430
 the terrible practicing I bought this 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.750
 me and the same day that I bought I had 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.540
 the two days call me if I click 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:53.000
 tonight in the crow 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.939
 and as I had not punctured my life 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.280
 nerves that you shit totalfina as well 

00:02:55.939 --> 00:02:59.989
 went from fucking mother to parties and little 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.680
 little by then and all week all the 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:02.599
 weeks 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.209
 those are remises because they really 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:06.290
 there is no more own I have few to me what 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.629
 what I liked was to start 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.980
 because it was the most comfortable and it was what 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:11.870
 I liked it because I liked them 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.700
 some melodies and there's another melody in 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.400
 breaking or live or I put it and for my 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.920
 colleagues and when I started to see him color 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.689
 I already dedicated myself to that and even some 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.609
 fans sent me with him sevilla 

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:24.200
 You could make this theme to me 

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:27.920
 love this water theme by talk 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:30.019
 for money eternally grateful in 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:33.230
 contrast there are topics that more credited 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:36.439
 like the gold that a the horizon is the 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:39.290
 original scenes without progressive and the 

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:40.909
 remix that there was was weak and no more than 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.639
 I take it out tarantos by the gentleman soniquete 

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:45.530
 but of course it was a pirate cookie 

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:46.909
 because it was a pirate song it was a 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.120
 rave get inspired that you could not have 

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:51.010
 done or could not be 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.540
 by not paying royalties you have to 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:56.590
 take it out pirate so there is no problem 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:58.299
 with the let's say then people did not see 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.069
 in the street I'm going to white and subject 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:02.290
 they were break beat 'em and if they were 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:03.730
 white cookie was final karpin do what 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.069
 what do they do with the money others 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:09.640
 you have already seen itunes, you do not have to 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:13.860
 be a the bullet so that to have it color 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.860
 they almost always have royalties 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.530
 or not be a little girl 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:23.090
 and I was pricked puncture weeks and 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:26.840
 week not twice a week 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:30.250
 the parents for my gentlemen of means of 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:31.970
 vacation to throw from there that we 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.440
 we went with the idea of 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:35.360
 minivacaciones but now as we congo 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:38.510
 with one hand in front and one behind or 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:41.000
 there we started to download a couple of 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:42.350
 weekly here in a restaurant and what 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.960
 let's take it to 100 to hit us type 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:46.780
 of vacations without to madness with 20 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.660
 years 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.190
 When I returned to Seville and it is clear that 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.660
 I had not posted music on the internet 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:55.750
 they came a few times from places 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:57.250
 karpin calpins I do not know what would cut course 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.330
 he said every time he went he was jabbing 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:00.700
 I also hit the same tribute 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.870
 then people would see me stc around here 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:05.150
 of garden and media 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:07.040
 and rumors that they have died of 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:10.090
 overdose traffic accident 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.090
 I arrived in Seville 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:17.550
 and still 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:19.560
 but now he has never really left 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:21.780
 makes music always hung a rem album 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.860
 and hung something but there was no more 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.570
 10,000 pages 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.070
 to hang music then I did not have a 

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:29.490
 issue did not have the same impact on 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:31.110
 a single page that have a theme in diego 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:32.370
 it page everyone was listening 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:34.020
 there were people who listened to a page there 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:36.480
 people who listened to a short sale that 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:38.850
 I listened to sonic obviously with the idea 

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:40.410
 the idea that I have now is more than 

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:43.650
 same without installing a bolus I will take it and 

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:45.540
 I will try to go a little bit more than one 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:47.160
 little bit more renewed the remises heart 

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:48.840
 they have nobody recognized before before 

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.460
 they were copypaste because there was no 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.860
 tutorials there was nothing so 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:55.230
 I learned I learned alone I was not 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:57.060
 prepared for that kind of thing like 

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:57.960
 young also with 18 years very few 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:01.230
 lights 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:04.140
 life are stage I say that before make 

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:05.610
 much more tranquilito than before that 

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:07.260
 has a pocket lid that's why 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:09.090
 there has been a lot of talk about me there has been 

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:11.250
 so much theme 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:13.350
 me or controversial on the internet of the 

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:14.460
 drug I think that in this world of 

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:18.630
 l'ebre and pricked 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:19.979
 everyone has tried something that 

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:21.680
 more others less but that these are 

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:23.030
 stages 

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:25.610
 and you have to move forward and you have to 

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:29.050
 another stage of your life is forgetting with 

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:29.050
 a lack of nothing at once
