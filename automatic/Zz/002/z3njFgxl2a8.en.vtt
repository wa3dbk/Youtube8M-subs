00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
there is a very high analytical aspect

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.099 
there is a very high analytical aspect
to<00:00:16.289> that<00:00:16.440> kind<00:00:16.619> of<00:00:16.680> stuff<00:00:17.240> and<00:00:18.240> I<00:00:18.449> think<00:00:18.660> comedy

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109

has a lot of logic in it that you can

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.790 
has a lot of logic in it that you can
analyze<00:00:21.480> some<00:00:22.050> of<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.199> best<00:00:22.350> advice<00:00:22.560> I've

because I think that brie and camembert
are<00:01:14.570> the<00:01:15.440> same<00:01:15.800> cheese

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890
