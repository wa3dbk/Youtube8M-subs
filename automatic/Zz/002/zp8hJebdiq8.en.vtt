00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:11.900
 a couple of millions 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.900
 stop it 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.019
 thank you 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.019
 the true meaning 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:32.820
 he was a fugitive 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.820
 yes no 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:57.590
 21 and over 68 is not bad means that 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:01:00.720
 it's up to him or so he also finds himself 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.430
 question pelourinho measures the water e 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.260
 must serve the water temperature e 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.160
 not reflecting hands before it 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:14.509
 amount to be even needed 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:14.509
 8 tenth cars played discarded 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:26.410
 but still like that a function does not 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.410
 works need thousand temperature 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:44.150
 these died 31 16 died of 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.150
 tito that one 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:54.490
 a justification that is operational 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.490
 mischief hello month 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:10.560
 and we haven't come close yet though 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.560
 are the preliminary stages 

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:14.790
 we are still in the preliminaries 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:30.060
 you put it there 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:54.360
 I've seen stop-and-go macro themes when 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:57.260
 in the end then 9 sun impression me 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:00.310
 I'm just malaria 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.310
 andrea torbida 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.749
 and now you're relaxed 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:12.629
 useless you feel now that beautiful 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:34.580
 Yes No 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:48.900
 and now what do you do 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:52.730
 as the four that spins a pair 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:57.840
 of minutes seems like a few steps speed 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:04:02.360
 of speed is test from the speed between 4 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:03.860
 and 5 are room for 35 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:09.420
 and now territory 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:12.050
 yes but just little that relaxes 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.050
 this data 

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:20.459
 then the fact of stopping and starting again 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.440
 and what you do when you do 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:24.629
 the dough by hand that when it is finished the 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:27.120
 let me say the cloth is the same 

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:29.389
 what because this work is based the 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.389
 but no 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.670
 I say so 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.790
 because it's softer so it makes one 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:39.790
 fatigue 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.020
 each 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.400
 and if it feels right 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.860
 the action 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:13.940
 I got it 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.940
 ok 

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:24.370
 i 32 33 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.280
 for marco 

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:40.699
 and the water so was without two lists e 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:40.699
 to do this but very few sites grades 

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:50.350
 no 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:54.289
 it's true 

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:00.820
 what you are 

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:00.820
 Yup 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:16.100
