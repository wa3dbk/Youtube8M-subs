00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 so hey people welcome to a new one 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:08.390
 video and today I have c4 in 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.390
 minecraft vanilla 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.929
 as already are already here 

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:24.340
 I have this here and once 

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:27.039
 this one i have two pensions 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:29.739
 here to introduce and that once the 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:31.210
 variant of mystery he has me one 

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:32.829
 complete instructions from st 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.260
 sent by such a machine here 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:36.550
 times faded in and his equipment 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:40.059
 works so i have here now 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:42.250
 first a woman ex-model and if 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:44.350
 I throw the then becomes an exit 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.659
 commands executed that one 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.040
 Silverfish band called c4 and if I am 

00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:49.479
 then a snowball thrower then becomes 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.610
 from any distance just this 

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:52.299
 this blasted silver fish where the 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.799
 just a price 

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:55.960
 It will be interesting to do that now 

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:58.210
 Here and then you can just go out 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.259
 any distance as I said that 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.000
 blow up 

00:00:59.259 --> 00:01:02.500
 I was so free and have one 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.509
 a little bit about something else 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.060
 built another little principle and 

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:08.619
 Although once with the item frames wants from 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.119
 Metro have already seen and that moment 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:12.009
 I have here a box here again 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:13.720
 with c4 and once with the trigger that 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:16.720
 in this case, it's just a ne 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.640
 carrot at the other and want c4 so 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.280
 say the item frame sit down is that 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.439
 automatically here a fanblock of the c4 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.270
 means in the item frame and I can 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:26.979
 now everywhere and so on and so on 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.350
 with this trigger right click on it 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:32.020
 please do the whole thing automatically 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.159
 blown up and you're no harm 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.859
 there can exhibition has already seen 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:37.240
 that was a crib child and that's why 

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:38.319
 you can hurt a faster too 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.590
 and environmental or not 

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:43.569
 and yes, how do I do that 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.799
 automatically here c4 is old in the frame 

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:47.170
 sit down that I do with a ntt 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:50.409
 data command moment I do that 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.969
 I wrote it here so it was one 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:55.569
 finally the data command was for everyone 

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:58.539
 old frame of the data tatum the 

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:59.319
 minecraft tnt and next to it the name c4 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:01.810
 includes 

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:03.459
 and that just does not matter 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.560
 what like me sit down that if now 

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:08.590
 being at the side or so it is always 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:12.160
 an item called c4 in the slide in frame 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.270
 which is also a blog and that's exactly what 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.319
 That's the way you do it you can do it too 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.480
 not chip off as just always 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:17.770
 place is not enough for that 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.530
 Of course my god can not speak German 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:23.110
 and what a trigger press then 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.610
 the whole way is this trigger 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.070
 just works with one 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.750
 scoreboard objective called so I go 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:30.250
 I called it all and tested it 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.840
 just if I a 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.750
 use the item and that is in the case 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.580
 just this carrot on a stick an angel 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.620
 Of course, which pages right click then 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.150
 is it just that at this score 1 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.250
 it comes to that and if that is the case 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.020
 it is set to zero directly here and 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.700
 there will be an exit command at each 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.530
 player, meanwhile , has 1 for example 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.500
 if i have it legal i have in the 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:53.230
 score 1 then becomes exact at each frame 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.480
 carried out in turn all all 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.360
 entities within the radius of a block 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.560
 for safety and how 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.290
 actually done and with that here 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.180
 not top but it works that way 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.860
 I just like the used and 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.290
 the more important is just this one 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.140
 Creeper is stretched with 10 so 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.670
 immediately exploded is clamped 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.890
 and you can show it again 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.590
 beautiful and of course I can too 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.570
 again the force of the explosions 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:25.420
 show those innocent sheep 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:27.790
 Just free life so so 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.020
 So these two variants exist 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.239
 I have presented here many thanks 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:32.530
 again to miss tirol me this 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:35.110
 complete instructions the comments 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.370
 wrote and I know what it is 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:39.250
 written all over this head 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:41.350
 I find commands cool and yes 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.610
 otherwise I would say if you're upset 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.380
 all on something then could of course 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.209
 like to look into the description there 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.290
 there's the whole thing to download so then 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:49.510
 was that again from this one? 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.230
 small video day for super people up 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:55.000
 next time 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:59.010
 and so it's a bit more spectacular 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.010
 already there was not stingy
