00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.180
 indoor walking is an activity that 

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:13.300
 started around the year 2004 by half 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:15.219
 of a rhythm and there what I wanted was 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:19.480
 make a playful activity with the 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:22.359
 ellipticals to avoid a little bit the 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:25.270
 day to day boring aerobic work 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:28.720
 then invented this quote 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:30.640
 this activity that although after all it is your 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:34.660
 definition is the following is a 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:37.719
 playful activity is directed by a 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.520
 monitor to the rhythm of music and what 

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:42.969
 The main thing is that it has a 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:45.100
 low muscular impact that at the end and 

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:47.710
 Cape is the best for our 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.320
 joints for the lumbar area the 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:54.219
 back and everything in general for all 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:56.649
 body then from the year 2004 it 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:59.900
 started to start doing this this 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:02.360
 activity a little more more enjoyable 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:07.190
 directed by instructor and above all 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:10.700
 It also has the basis that spending 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:12.350
 caloric is quite high in a session 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:16.400
 of indoor walking of about 45 minutes 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:18.820
 it comes more or less to have then about 400 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.720
 500 calories of energy consumption 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:24.350
 then that's what people call the 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:26.600
 attention that we can talk about it more 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:30.320
 you can have better improvements both 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:33.690
 physical as well as psychic in the aspect of 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:36.330
 which is an escape valve 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:39.630
 you have improvements in recovery because 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.730
 the types of work that are done is a 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.440
 predominantly aerobic work 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:46.200
 although we also work a little bit on 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:49.110
 anaerobic threshold but to a lesser extent and 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.510
 otherwise, then nothing to be at 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.240
 rhythm of music and with more people 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:56.910
 people are encouraged and it is an activity 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.270
 pretty pretty bearable in terms of 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.270
 weather
