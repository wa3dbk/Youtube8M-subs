00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
have the generic I see s on I don't

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.660 
have the generic I see s on I don't
think<00:01:13.020> it<00:01:13.470> really<00:01:13.500> matters<00:01:13.710> which<00:01:14.159> one<00:01:14.400> but

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
it will have the Kate of the sign that

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.710 
it will have the Kate of the sign that
comes<00:01:35.130> up<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.460> tells<00:01:35.670> you<00:01:36.000> that<00:01:36.600> it's<00:01:38.720> using
