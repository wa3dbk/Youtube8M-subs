00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:15.860
 hello so today we find ourselves 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.429
 for a special video on my 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:21.199
 chain it's going to be the first of this type 

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:23.199
 in fact I did not see I had a little 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:27.710
 worry in celebration with my birds 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:30.890
 he had 2.4 of Conan so far 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:33.100
 everything was fine and there I realized 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:36.080
 that I had answered four in fact 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.510
 So suddenly I'm Rees me eggs 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.910
 so see if they were fertilized 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:45.910
 to tell you all I never did 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:49.490
 before so I'll do it with you 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:51.920
 So here is the shot g8 ruff and 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:53.510
 benchmarks everything we say because 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.220
 while they could all four 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.710
 first he continued to mate 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.440
 open and suddenly you have them 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:03.110
 resold 4 ' 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.009
 so that's the beating street that both 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:08.210
 parents come out of the nest 

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:10.880
 I'm going to get the level out of the cage and 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.610
 I will be realized with you then at 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.960
 right now 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.880
 so here's the parents are finally out 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.590
 of the nest so I struggled to get out 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.180
 the nest of the cage I would put it a 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.460
 other place in the cage I think about 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.670
 games to put back because that's it 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.950
 horror so here I have everything prepared 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.600
 I prepared a box with hemp 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.600
 to pose the eyes for palermo and 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.040
 change to see who to moan and 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:38.479
 which ones I did not come to and so you 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:40.990
 see this is the field here it is 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:40.990
 good of a room 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.130
 I do not have a lot but so the nest 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:58.270
 no, here is my material I took a 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:01.540
 lamp I do not know if she lit 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:04.270
 strong enough but I only have that so we 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.710
 will try and I will enjoy it too 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.760
 to clean a little nose but it does not 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.560
 do not want to do it in front of you 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:21.010
 since it's a bit boring so that 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:24.160
 so here I take them so parent 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.360
 finally the eggs one by one you you 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.220
 do not see if there is something 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:31.290
 in you go too far and if you 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.290
 poor quality safar approach I think 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:43.680
 Here one passes and then the center 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:45.520
 does not come to him so powerful 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.940
 I will look if I find a 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.940
 light 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.810
 I did not find other lights so 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:55.800
 we will try with the phone flash 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.800
 we will see what it gives 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:03.510
 I think it can work and if I 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.510
 see something to show it to you 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:18.360
 the room is not so dark did 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:21.160
 only concern the room we pass his 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:23.520
 last the piece his power it changes 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.520
 Something 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.050
 we see there I put myself in a room 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.959
 dark 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:37.239
 finally black what I do not know if you 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:40.510
 go see the ships yes this one there 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:50.980
 there is something in it we see the 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:53.140
 small ships is weird so I 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:57.750
 go find the nest or versailles this 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:04:02.160
 link and I'll be right back 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:02.160
 so we're going to look at this one 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:22.010
 this one there is also a small vessel 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:23.660
 in here take another is 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:26.800
 really small 1.9 this case the little 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.800
 angel in all by two the cases it's 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:38.320
 this one too there is something for 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:38.320
 what you see a little bit here 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:52.040
 I avoid too much moving them too 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.789
 so this one is a bit special 

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:11.039
 this one there is something in it 

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:13.119
 also you see a mass a little bit 

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:15.699
 that's it I think it's the most 

00:05:13.119 --> 00:05:17.139
 old neck that are like that where we 

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:19.119
 see a little less ship I think 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:20.289
 that it is the oldest ones so here you are 

00:05:19.119 --> 00:05:25.539
 are not in the dark and light 

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:27.929
 Here I still have four hours 

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:27.929
 admire 

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:39.940
 this one is like the one I 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:41.800
 just showed you it looks like he 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:43.330
 is a bit more advanced advanced than the 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.160
 others it's a mass and not that 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:49.960
 veins 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:51.160
 so here we have a little bit more 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:55.930
 high but for the quality of this video 

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:56.950
 also I apologize for this movie 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:03.940
 is in the dark and everything is not 

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:10.870
 obvious here is where you see well 

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:18.300
 the mass there you see there this one you 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:18.300
 see really well here I see there 

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:34.920
 this one I'm watching the avenue this 

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:34.920
 I saw the vessels with the naked eye 

00:06:46.989 --> 00:06:54.939
 this one here it might be 

00:06:51.709 --> 00:07:01.239
 life finally we see a task 

00:06:54.939 --> 00:07:01.239
 I do not know what is it
