on<00:01:27.920> the<00:01:28.009> run<00:01:28.190> just<00:01:28.700> for<00:01:29.000> the<00:01:29.060> lessons<00:01:29.330> we<00:01:29.450> teach

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:29.660 
on the run just for the lessons we teach

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:36.240 
on the run just for the lessons we teach
I'll<00:01:30.500> never<00:01:31.570> be<00:01:33.460> the<00:01:34.460> one<00:01:34.729> to<00:01:35.119> raise<00:01:35.600> my<00:01:35.990> hand

I'll never be the one to raise my hand
that<00:01:37.250> was<00:01:37.700> not<00:01:38.570> me

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.810 

that's<00:01:41.950> the<00:01:42.950> reason<00:01:43.220> I<00:01:43.340> think<00:01:43.580> it's<00:01:43.700> so

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
that's the reason I think it's so

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.490 
that's the reason I think it's so
important<00:01:44.270> to<00:01:44.300> start<00:01:44.570> young<00:01:44.840> today<00:01:45.290> with

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
important to start young today with

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.440 
important to start young today with
girls<00:01:45.800> and<00:01:45.950> making<00:01:46.220> healthy<00:01:46.490> decisions<00:01:46.520> is

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
girls and making healthy decisions is

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.210 
girls and making healthy decisions is
because<00:01:47.870> they're<00:01:48.020> faced<00:01:48.200> with<00:01:48.229> peer<00:01:48.979> pressure

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
because they're faced with peer pressure

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.520 
because they're faced with peer pressure
much<00:01:49.550> younger<00:01:49.820> in<00:01:50.030> today's<00:01:50.570> world<00:01:50.840> I<00:01:51.170> think

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
much younger in today's world I think

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.770 
much younger in today's world I think
the<00:01:51.670> lessons<00:01:52.670> that<00:01:52.760> are<00:01:52.909> talked<00:01:53.479> to<00:01:53.630> their

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
the lessons that are talked to their

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.270 
the lessons that are talked to their
girls<00:01:54.050> are<00:01:54.229> critical<00:01:54.710> because<00:01:54.740> they're<00:01:55.040> at<00:01:55.159> an
