hi and welcome to the FDR tutorial in
this<00:00:04.259> video<00:00:04.470> I<00:00:04.680> will<00:00:05.130> explain<00:00:05.160> what<00:00:05.759> fixed

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
this video I will explain what fixed

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.419 
this video I will explain what fixed
dialing<00:00:06.480> numbers<00:00:06.779> are<00:00:07.080> why<00:00:07.980> would<00:00:08.160> you<00:00:08.250> want

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
dialing numbers are why would you want

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.640 
dialing numbers are why would you want
to<00:00:08.490> use<00:00:08.700> them<00:00:08.940> who<00:00:09.750> needs<00:00:09.900> to<00:00:10.110> use<00:00:10.170> them<00:00:10.469> and

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
to use them who needs to use them and

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.280 
to use them who needs to use them and
how<00:00:10.740> to<00:00:10.980> actually<00:00:11.280> use<00:00:11.639> this<00:00:11.849> feature<00:00:12.290> so

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
how to actually use this feature so

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.099 
how to actually use this feature so
fixed<00:00:14.280> dialing<00:00:14.610> numbers<00:00:14.969> are<00:00:15.179> also<00:00:15.719> known<00:00:15.929> as

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
you have to ask your mobile company to

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.220 
you have to ask your mobile company to
help<00:02:16.730> you<00:02:16.850> out<00:02:17.030> because<00:02:17.390> otherwise<00:02:17.780> there<00:02:18.200> is

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
help you out because otherwise there is

no way you can change or edit the FG
ends<00:02:21.410> and<00:02:22.780> perhaps<00:02:23.780> I<00:02:24.290> should<00:02:24.680> point<00:02:24.890> out<00:02:25.100> that

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
ends and perhaps I should point out that

ends and perhaps I should point out that
there<00:02:25.580> is<00:02:25.610> another<00:02:25.730> scenario<00:02:26.660> in<00:02:26.810> which<00:02:26.840> you

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
there is another scenario in which you

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.800 
there is another scenario in which you
may<00:02:27.320> be<00:02:27.380> interested<00:02:28.250> in<00:02:28.370> using<00:02:28.490> FG<00:02:28.910> ends<00:02:29.030> for

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
may be interested in using FG ends for

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.130 
may be interested in using FG ends for
example<00:02:30.200> if<00:02:30.380> you're<00:02:30.560> a<00:02:30.620> company<00:02:31.190> and<00:02:32.140> you

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
example if you're a company and you

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.360 
example if you're a company and you
issue<00:02:33.440> your<00:02:33.830> employees<00:02:35.410> SIM<00:02:36.410> cards<00:02:36.770> that<00:02:37.190> they

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
issue your employees SIM cards that they

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.100 
issue your employees SIM cards that they
can<00:02:37.580> use<00:02:37.760> to<00:02:37.970> call<00:02:38.180> their<00:02:38.450> colleagues<00:02:38.870> and

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
can use to call their colleagues and

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.910 
can use to call their colleagues and
business<00:02:40.100> partners<00:02:40.490> you<00:02:41.020> probably<00:02:42.020> don't

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
business partners you probably don't

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.790 
business partners you probably don't
want<00:02:43.160> them<00:02:43.340> to<00:02:43.490> call<00:02:43.960> anywhere<00:02:44.960> else<00:02:45.200> for

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
want them to call anywhere else for

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.190 
want them to call anywhere else for
example<00:02:46.130> in<00:02:46.250> Australia<00:02:46.880> or<00:02:47.090> somewhere<00:02:47.600> really

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
example in Australia or somewhere really

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.320 
example in Australia or somewhere really
really<00:02:48.650> far<00:02:48.830> away<00:02:49.100> because<00:02:49.640> otherwise<00:02:50.090> the

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
really far away because otherwise the

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.260 
really far away because otherwise the
company<00:02:50.690> would<00:02:50.810> have<00:02:50.930> to<00:02:51.080> pay<00:02:51.260> for<00:02:51.320> some

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
company would have to pay for some

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:55.270 
company would have to pay for some
things<00:02:53.270> which<00:02:53.450> are<00:02:53.600> not<00:02:53.780> strictly<00:02:54.680> related<00:02:55.010> to

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
things which are not strictly related to

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.210 
things which are not strictly related to
business<00:02:55.690> so<00:02:56.690> in<00:02:56.870> this<00:02:57.020> case<00:02:57.290> a<00:02:57.500> company<00:02:58.040> can

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
business so in this case a company can

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.110 
business so in this case a company can
use<00:02:58.420> the<00:02:59.420> FD<00:02:59.780> n<00:02:59.870> feature<00:03:00.140> to<00:03:00.470> restrict<00:03:01.120> the

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
use the FD n feature to restrict the

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.090 
use the FD n feature to restrict the
numbers<00:03:02.480> to<00:03:02.660> which<00:03:02.780> employees<00:03:03.320> can<00:03:03.350> call<00:03:03.770> so

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
numbers to which employees can call so

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.680 
numbers to which employees can call so
for<00:03:04.280> example<00:03:04.580> if<00:03:04.700> you<00:03:04.820> have<00:03:04.970> a<00:03:05.000> company<00:03:05.420> of

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
for example if you have a company of

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.000 
for example if you have a company of
five<00:03:06.490> let's<00:03:07.490> say<00:03:07.670> ok<00:03:08.150> five<00:03:08.510> people<00:03:08.900> they<00:03:09.800> can

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
five let's say ok five people they can

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.870 
five let's say ok five people they can
only<00:03:10.160> call<00:03:10.520> each<00:03:11.150> other<00:03:11.420> and<00:03:12.490> so<00:03:13.490> on<00:03:13.670> so<00:03:13.790> I

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
only call each other and so on so I

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.820 
only call each other and so on so I
imagine<00:03:14.060> that<00:03:14.300> all<00:03:15.200> of<00:03:15.440> them<00:03:15.620> are

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
imagine that all of them are

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.550 
imagine that all of them are
interconnected<00:03:16.370> but<00:03:16.700> they<00:03:16.910> cannot<00:03:17.560> call

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
interconnected but they cannot call

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:25.170 
interconnected but they cannot call
anyone<00:03:19.220> else<00:03:20.410> outside<00:03:21.490> the<00:03:22.490> company<00:03:22.700> and

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
anyone else outside the company and

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.310 
anyone else outside the company and
another<00:03:26.180> interesting<00:03:26.540> feature<00:03:26.900> which

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:27.320 
another interesting feature which

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:32.650 
another interesting feature which
evidences<00:03:28.160> offer<00:03:28.460> are<00:03:29.470> templates<00:03:31.000> so<00:03:32.000> let's

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
evidences offer are templates so let's

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.080 
evidences offer are templates so let's
say<00:03:32.840> that<00:03:32.870> my<00:03:33.170> number<00:03:33.530> is<00:03:33.710> five<00:03:34.340> five<00:03:34.730> five

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
say that my number is five five five

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.610 
say that my number is five five five
three<00:03:35.630> two<00:03:35.780> one<00:03:36.470> okay<00:03:37.220> three<00:03:37.640> one<00:03:38.030> zero<00:03:38.060> and<00:03:38.620> my

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
three two one okay three one zero and my

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.440 
three two one okay three one zero and my
colleagues<00:03:40.100> number<00:03:40.460> is<00:03:40.640> five<00:03:40.970> five<00:03:41.210> five

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
colleagues number is five five five

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.090 
colleagues number is five five five
three<00:03:41.900> one<00:03:41.930> one<00:03:42.470> and<00:03:42.800> then<00:03:43.040> so<00:03:44.320> so<00:03:45.320> we<00:03:45.500> go<00:03:45.709> the

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:46.100 
three one one and then so so we go the

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:47.890 
three one one and then so so we go the
numbers<00:03:46.400> are<00:03:46.580> identical<00:03:47.120> but<00:03:47.330> only<00:03:47.450> the<00:03:47.690> last

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
numbers are identical but only the last

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.230 
numbers are identical but only the last
digit<00:03:48.230> is<00:03:48.350> different<00:03:48.709> so<00:03:49.340> if<00:03:49.550> I<00:03:49.700> have<00:03:49.940> ten

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:50.240 
digit is different so if I have ten

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:51.880 
digit is different so if I have ten
colleagues<00:03:50.600> I<00:03:50.840> would<00:03:50.900> have<00:03:51.170> to<00:03:51.320> enter<00:03:51.470> ten

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
colleagues I would have to enter ten

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.100 
colleagues I would have to enter ten
numbers<00:03:52.250> in<00:03:52.370> the<00:03:52.459> fixed<00:03:52.850> dialing<00:03:53.630> list<00:03:53.870> and

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.110 
numbers in the fixed dialing list and

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.070 
numbers in the fixed dialing list and
that<00:03:55.010> would<00:03:55.160> take<00:03:55.340> a<00:03:55.370> lot<00:03:55.580> of<00:03:55.610> effort<00:03:55.850> but<00:03:56.840> with

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:57.080 
that would take a lot of effort but with

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.740 
that would take a lot of effort but with
templates<00:03:57.590> I<00:03:57.890> can<00:03:58.580> enter<00:03:58.940> just<00:03:58.970> one<00:03:59.390> single

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
templates I can enter just one single

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:03.340 
templates I can enter just one single
entry<00:04:00.140> such<00:04:00.320> as<00:04:00.380> five<00:04:01.340> five<00:04:01.550> five<00:04:01.760> three<00:04:02.060> one<00:04:02.350> X

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:03.350 
entry such as five five five three one X

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:06.940 
entry such as five five five three one X
and<00:04:04.150> this<00:04:05.150> X<00:04:05.390> can<00:04:05.810> be<00:04:05.959> substituted<00:04:06.350> with<00:04:06.740> any

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
and this X can be substituted with any

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.670 
and this X can be substituted with any
other<00:04:07.190> digit<00:04:07.580> and<00:04:07.790> it<00:04:08.270> would<00:04:08.420> still<00:04:08.690> be<00:04:08.720> a

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
other digit and it would still be a

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.740 
other digit and it would still be a
valid<00:04:10.370> number<00:04:10.850> to<00:04:11.000> which<00:04:11.150> you<00:04:11.270> can<00:04:11.450> make<00:04:11.570> an

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
valid number to which you can make an

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.199 
valid number to which you can make an
outgoing<00:04:12.080> call<00:04:12.370> let<00:04:13.370> me<00:04:13.400> go<00:04:13.670> back<00:04:13.820> to<00:04:14.000> sim

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:14.209 
outgoing call let me go back to sim

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:17.320 
outgoing call let me go back to sim

is how I can add my new text dialing

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.290 
is how I can add my new text dialing

3 times in a row it will get blocked and

3 times in a row it will get blocked and
that's<00:05:06.349> a<00:05:06.440> bad<00:05:06.620> thing

00:05:07.059 --> 00:05:07.069

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:06.550 
country you can give them a local SIM
card<00:06:04.940> so<00:06:05.240> they<00:06:05.419> won't<00:06:05.539> have<00:06:05.690> to<00:06:05.870> pay<00:06:05.990> a<00:06:06.139> roaming

card so they won't have to pay a roaming

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.860 
card so they won't have to pay a roaming
fees<00:06:06.740> and<00:06:07.039> you<00:06:07.639> can<00:06:07.789> restrict<00:06:08.120> that<00:06:08.330> same<00:06:08.599> card

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:08.870

fees and you can restrict that same card
such<00:06:09.110> that<00:06:09.319> the<00:06:10.039> friend<00:06:10.340> could<00:06:10.520> only<00:06:10.639> call<00:06:10.940> you

and some other close person and how this

00:06:16.099 --> 00:06:21.300 
and some other close person and how this
works<00:06:16.400> is<00:06:16.729> by<00:06:17.210> relying<00:06:17.719> on<00:06:17.960> the<00:06:18.879> FDM<00:06:19.879> feature
