00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:09.589
 na na na na 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:18.070
 Yes do you still picopico 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:22.599
 Science of the NES sound from here 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:27.940
 I will actually analyze NES sound 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:29.080
 I 'm unmarried Well, I can give some tones, but I said the tone now, but the sound 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.490
 The character is 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:34.850
 There is something called a tone Famicoma 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:38.030
 So what kind of sound can you make? 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:41.540
 It becomes the main of the best NES sound 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:45.320
 I will explain the sound of pulse waves 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.220
 I Yes I'm a pulse wave So try to Itadako heard it is a little First what kind of sound 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.690
 think 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:51.510
 There's been a long time coming out there, but it's this cuddly device here but this 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.660
 synthesizer 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:58.859
 Well, here's a synthesizer that can make various electronic sounds 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:04.259
 And is another one I dubious argument that I do I Well ipad located on a side of here 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:10.409
 I'd are a little remodeling this is to see the waveform to say that the oscilloscope 

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:11.500
 It says brother I was told I device is I Ha ha systems that can be is vibration is transmitted to air support 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.850
 At last the eardrum come 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:19.650
 It's not like I'm going to make a sound. 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:25.740
 Mysterious vibration is converted to an electric signal so that the sound can be recorded or taken from the game console. 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:26.159
 And I mean that, but what kind of new what about it is its sound and use a device called the oscilloscope 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.060
 Or 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:33.090
 Is a device that can be seen with a total of seven days 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.780
 First of all, send out a pulse wave from here 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:39.680
 Let's take a look at an oscilloscope . 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.680
 When we put out the sound 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:52.560
 Yes This kind of waveform comes out and let's chop it 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:52.560
 Hmmm 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:05.469
 Yes this is also in the pulse wave 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:13.140
 Once you look at the screen of it is a wave called a rectangular wave oscilloscope 

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:16.400
 This is the case when square waves are continuous and lined up with exactly the same width 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:19.459
 Game consoles in the early 1980's 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:23.599
 It was the most popular with something like a personal computer 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:25.960
 Sounds and can be put out Amiko too 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:29.890
 It is a scene for 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:32.100
 Well then, if you try to play with the keyboard for a moment with this awsome square wave, what will it be like? 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.100
 Follow 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:47.569
 It seems like this is a little silent speech 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:49.280
 The Whoo The Tteyuu sound of the square wave 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:52.550
 Hmm 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:57.860
 Well I feel like an Ord game machine 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:59.600
 The NES can do this too. It is actually a NES square wave. 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:03.190
 I will ask you for a moment 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.190
 It is similar to this 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:12.390
 I've made 50 bends for NES now, but I think noise is coming in 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:16.170
 One of you is but also taste will come out also that this noise why I am first generation NES 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:17.710
 I think that I will deliver without cutting this time 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:24.660
 It is now 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:24.660
 If it is programmed so that a simple square wave comes out, try running it 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:36.700
 Yes I'm out for the oscilloscope 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:42.630
 It is a little compared to the square wave from the previous synthesizer . 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:42.630
 When the form is try to here distorted Kana I think a little while ago of one more time 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:52.280
 Yes like this I think that those who put out from the synthesizer are lined with relatively clean assassins 

00:03:51.499 --> 00:03:55.689
 but 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.689
 If you are a NES 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:08.240
 It does not change so much when I hear it with my ears, but I'm a little distorted 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:14.590
 It's like this . If the shape is a little different, it 's also the personality of the running machine . 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:14.590
 Well first of all this is a square wave of NES 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:25.200
 Well then, this family measles is similar to the game console PC in the early 1980's. 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:25.740
 But I could not 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.550
 a 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:35.930
 In fact, it is more from here that the receiver calls the pulse wave 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:35.930
 NES Looking out from the other Ichike application I'm able to another game 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:46.930
 The waveform of fe square wave came out with the previous waveform, but the squares are lined up with the same width 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:52.289
 Well then this 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:52.289
 If you try to do the Tteyuu what happens when try a little changing the width 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:08.819
 If I sound comes is changed is the ratio of the width of the rectangle will change 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:08.819
 The nose is clogged in the inside and the next one is gone 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:22.670
 Waveform will have also changed the feeling of the port changed 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:24.940
 A little while ago of Yoko and I are real but is a total of pay across the width of the NES is this 

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:26.920
 Not only the rectangular wave of equal width 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:31.340
 ThatLookLikeThis 

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:35.710
 It is possible to stand the sound of different width 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:35.710
 Yes if you play in this state 

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:44.160
 It's a bit like a whole lot. 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:44.160
 When such we'll spread Choi Toka Attari 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:57.860
 ten 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:58.940
 Feelings of the beginning are different, but NES is actually changing this pulse that width 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:02.510
 Be able to 

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:04.750
 There is a feeling of expression over there, I try to do a little programming 

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:04.750
 Let's go 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:11.419
 So is that of a little while ago once you have heard or hey monotonous rectangular wave 

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:22.420
 It was this, but even with Yappu, I 'm back a little 

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:35.840
 Try changing the width of the pulse wave Changing the width of the house Management 

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:39.520
 The waveform changes when you look at an oscilloscope with the sound of Natsuki Tsukuta for a moment 

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:39.520
 Square of the Well has changed 

00:06:40.849 --> 00:06:48.210
 It is also good that the atmosphere is pitting 

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:50.990
 I will support the program a little further 

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:50.990
 tai 

00:06:54.100 --> 00:07:00.450
 Furthermore , I think you can see that the width of Efals has changed 

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:13.669
 It sounds like it's like changing the pulse width in braiding like this 

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:19.130
 Than the actual to the variety richly put out by that time to, for example, ineffective msx Toka of other conflicts 

00:07:13.669 --> 00:07:20.539
 The expressive power was a bit high . With this NES, this pulse wave is up to two simultaneously 

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:22.260
 Can be put out 

00:07:20.539 --> 00:07:28.340
 In addition coma than those of books 

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:28.340
 I want to write it, so please take a look there as well
