there's<00:01:11.840> some<00:01:11.990> fundamental<00:01:12.500> differences

00:01:12.819 --> 00:01:12.829 
there's some fundamental differences

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:15.280 
there's some fundamental differences
with<00:01:13.040> this<00:01:13.130> club<00:01:13.340> over<00:01:13.460> our<00:01:14.150> competitors<00:01:14.329> this

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
with this club over our competitors this

section<00:01:15.979> of<00:01:16.100> the<00:01:16.130> tub<00:01:16.549> is<00:01:16.579> actually<00:01:16.970> quite<00:01:17.329> big

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 
section of the tub is actually quite big

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:20.290 
section of the tub is actually quite big
compared<00:01:18.230> to<00:01:18.440> some<00:01:19.190> other<00:01:19.250> tubs<00:01:19.610> and<00:01:20.150> that's

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:20.300 
compared to some other tubs and that's

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.610 
compared to some other tubs and that's
fundamentally<00:01:20.960> because<00:01:21.020> we've<00:01:21.260> tried<00:01:21.470> to

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:21.620 
fundamentally because we've tried to

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.920 
fundamentally because we've tried to
grow<00:01:22.220> this<00:01:22.580> surface<00:01:23.060> out<00:01:23.270> so<00:01:23.600> there's<00:01:23.780> no

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
grow this surface out so there's no

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:25.950 
grow this surface out so there's no
additional<00:01:24.350> bodywork<00:01:24.770> and<00:01:24.950> this<00:01:25.040> is<00:01:25.159> actually

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
additional bodywork and this is actually

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.380 
additional bodywork and this is actually
aerodynamic<00:01:26.960> surface<00:01:27.440> there's<00:01:27.920> no<00:01:28.390> clutch

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
safety measures here and you can see

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.570 
safety measures here and you can see
here<00:01:46.729> sort<00:01:47.090> of<00:01:47.120> the<00:01:47.470> handle<00:01:48.470> door<00:01:49.040> handle<00:01:49.460> and

here sort of the handle door handle and

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.460 
here sort of the handle door handle and
on<00:01:50.000> the<00:01:50.120> hinges<00:01:50.479> there's<00:01:50.690> some<00:01:50.870> quick<00:01:51.140> release

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
on the hinges there's some quick release

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.740 
on the hinges there's some quick release
buttons<00:01:52.340> here<00:01:52.610> so<00:01:52.850> if<00:01:52.909> there's<00:01:53.060> a<00:01:53.120> problem<00:01:53.360> we

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
buttons here so if there's a problem we

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.450 
buttons here so if there's a problem we
can<00:01:53.930> actually<00:01:54.080> get<00:01:54.409> the<00:01:54.530> doors<00:01:54.770> or<00:01:55.220> the<00:01:55.310> driver

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
can actually get the doors or the driver

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:56.950 
can actually get the doors or the driver
can<00:01:55.729> get<00:01:55.880> the<00:01:55.970> doors<00:01:56.150> off<00:01:56.360> and<00:01:56.540> it's<00:01:56.659> the<00:01:56.750> same

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
can get the doors off and it's the same

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.109 
can get the doors off and it's the same
from<00:01:57.140> the<00:01:57.290> outside<00:01:57.680> and<00:01:57.950> that's<00:01:58.909> also

you'll see that continuation on to the

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.440 
you'll see that continuation on to the
door<00:02:06.080> so<00:02:06.440> when<00:02:06.770> the<00:02:06.830> doors<00:02:07.130> shut<00:02:08.060> but

top<00:02:11.090> you'll<00:02:11.330> see<00:02:11.420> the<00:02:12.349> start<00:02:12.650> of<00:02:12.769> the<00:02:12.799> roof<00:02:13.370> inn

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
top you'll see the start of the roof inn

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.030 
top you'll see the start of the roof inn
and<00:02:14.599> that<00:02:14.780> is<00:02:14.900> again<00:02:15.230> as<00:02:15.409> part<00:02:15.620> of<00:02:15.680> technical

and that is again as part of technical

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.130 
and that is again as part of technical
regulations<00:02:16.299> it's<00:02:17.299> a<00:02:17.390> safety<00:02:17.629> measure<00:02:17.900> that

regulations it's a safety measure that
was<00:02:18.260> introduced<00:02:18.709> a<00:02:18.950> few<00:02:19.459> years<00:02:19.700> back<00:02:19.939> which

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:20.239 
was introduced a few years back which

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:22.790 
was introduced a few years back which
was<00:02:20.420> designed<00:02:20.629> to<00:02:20.959> help<00:02:21.140> stop<00:02:21.650> the<00:02:21.769> car<00:02:21.980> from

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
was designed to help stop the car from

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.440 
was designed to help stop the car from
turning<00:02:23.070> over<00:02:23.190> fuel<00:02:23.730> filler<00:02:23.940> here<00:02:24.120> there's

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
turning over fuel filler here there's

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.960 
turning over fuel filler here there's
one<00:02:24.570> of<00:02:24.870> these<00:02:25.020> on<00:02:25.200> either<00:02:25.410> side<00:02:25.740> and<00:02:25.980> one<00:02:26.700> side

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
one of these on either side and one side

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.850 
one of these on either side and one side
is<00:02:27.150> for<00:02:27.420> filling<00:02:28.200> the<00:02:28.260> fuel<00:02:28.530> and<00:02:28.680> the<00:02:28.740> other

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
is for filling the fuel and the other

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.230 
is for filling the fuel and the other
side<00:02:29.070> is<00:02:29.220> to<00:02:29.310> breathe<00:02:29.490> the<00:02:29.700> air<00:02:29.790> out<00:02:29.970> whilst

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
side is to breathe the air out whilst

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.820 
side is to breathe the air out whilst
you're<00:02:30.450> filling<00:02:30.780> so<00:02:31.020> you<00:02:31.080> can<00:02:31.290> fill<00:02:31.500> the<00:02:31.620> tank

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
you're filling so you can fill the tank

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.890 
you're filling so you can fill the tank
very<00:02:32.040> quickly<00:02:32.280> you<00:02:32.790> see<00:02:33.000> these<00:02:33.210> two<00:02:33.690> shapes

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
very quickly you see these two shapes

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.780 
very quickly you see these two shapes
here<00:02:34.200> battery<00:02:34.800> fits<00:02:35.010> team<00:02:35.340> from<00:02:35.520> underneath

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
here battery fits team from underneath

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.420 
here battery fits team from underneath
and<00:02:36.570> you<00:02:36.690> have<00:02:36.840> to<00:02:37.020> calling<00:02:37.770> hoses<00:02:38.100> which<00:02:38.280> are

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
and you have to calling hoses which are

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.640 
and you have to calling hoses which are
coming<00:02:38.640> out<00:02:38.730> through<00:02:38.970> here<00:02:39.150> fuel<00:02:39.540> is<00:02:40.080> being

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650
