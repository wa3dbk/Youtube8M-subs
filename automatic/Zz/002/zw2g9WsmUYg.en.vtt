 in the beginning was the word and the word was with god 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:18.920
 and the word was coming and juice 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.760
 but 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:40.280
 cling sat appeared to grow and beasts 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.280
 birds 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:45.750

 angel with you 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.329
 hello dear friends in our 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.920
 I want to introduce today's program 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.790
 you with the story of one unknown 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.610
 writer 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:08.240
 why unknown yes because 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.890
 wrote a story over a hundred years ago 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.290
 published it in one newspaper instead 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.259
 signatures put only the letter t 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:20.130
 and just recently accidentally old 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:23.940
 the newspaper came into my hands I turned over 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:28.920
 yellowed pages and saw the headline 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:31.200
 I read the story of God 's help 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.630
 him and decided that you must 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:38.149
 learn this touchingly true story 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.149
 and so listen 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.840
 died in petersburg 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.869
 the poor man left his wife with the little ones 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.450
 they had no money for the kids and no one for them 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.670
 did not help either mother worked in the house 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.759
 one rich merchant there she did 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.550
 all the hard work washed soap 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:59.130
 the order suggests but the merchant paid her 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:03.630
 quite a bit of money from this job barely 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:05.040
 enough to buy bread intel bread in 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.470
 there was no house 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.229
 one day mom as always went to work and 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.420
 the children were left alone a little Anya 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.690
 went to her older brother Misha and 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:18.650
 Masha says I really want to eat 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:22.580
 let me eat just go to the kitchen 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:27.210
 looked nothing crust nor crumbs 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:30.270
 come back, have a baby 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:36.060
 and bring us something to eat, I do not want to endure 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:38.100
 I want to cry Anya what to do here 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.980
 Misha remembered how his mother taught him 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:43.980
 if it is difficult to son and help no one 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:47.340
 can't you not grieve pray to god and 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:49.970
 asked him for help god good he 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.970
 will always help 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:57.330
 remembered less mother's words 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:03:01.230
 thought and thought and came up with is what she 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:07.220
 I write to her letter to God himself 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:11.040
 pencil paper and wrote a saint 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:12.870
 gracious god you are so kind and mother 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.860
 said you always help 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:21.080
 my sister wants to eat you send me 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:24.270
 three pennies to buy and bread 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:26.100
 writing he folded his letter and ran 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.570
 ran from the house to lower it 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.750
 as soon as possible in the mailbox 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:33.390
 but Misha was still small and the box hung high 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:37.800
 and he could not reach him as 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:38.700
 be at this time passing by alone 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.830
 a priest 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:44.800
 he saw a little boy with a letter 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:50.430
 in his hand the priest went over to help and saw 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:52.340
 on the envelope a strange address letter to god 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.350
 priest devils 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:57.220
 to god 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:59.650
 that already this woman you write father 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.800
 I write to God because he owes us 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:04.530
 help you and always said so 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:07.600
 what happened you boy 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:10.960
 you understand my father, our mother works 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:12.150
 I think my sister is crying wants to eat here I am 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:14.459
 and wrote 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.470
 a letter so that the Lord would not send money to 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:19.590
 bread you and said that God is always 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:24.109
 helps to not happen and where are you 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:24.109
 you live here near a cistern 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:30.950
 the priest bought bread and went with Misha to 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:33.650
 he saw home in poverty 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:35.840
 the family and left the money as he could and 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:38.900
 the next day in the service in the temple 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:41.230
 when the time came to preach the priest 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:44.230
 told in an amazing letter and 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:44.230
 added 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:51.060
 hard already you copy 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:54.330
 in poverty and hunger who will help them no one 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:58.290
 only god will not help everyone 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:05:00.300
 remember them remember and help them we 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:02.760
 should help each other and do 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:06.680
 good deeds because god often 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:12.180
 sends help through good people 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:15.720
 you said the priest and fell silent quietly 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:19.170
 became in the temple people thought they were sorry 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:22.260
 it became this family and ashamed that they themselves 

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:25.880
 so little help others and become money 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:31.000
 collect who a penny who ruble put 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:34.340
 This money was taken by priest Mishina Mom 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.410
 Here is a story from life 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:39.320
 was printed in one newspaper a hundred years 

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:39.980
 back there seems to be nothing in it 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:42.500
 special 

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:46.640
 well listened people good priest and 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:47.480
 helped a poor family but there is in it 

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:51.470
 the story 

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:54.410
 very important thing to know and 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:56.540
 always remember it is the Lord who sends 

00:05:54.410 --> 00:06:00.250
 We are with you kind people and through these 

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:03.560
 people we get help this is 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:03.980
 God's help is only necessary 

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:07.760
 believe 

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:09.910
 hope and ask about her and not 

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:12.250
 be sure to write a letter to god 

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:16.660
 enough to say from the bottom of my heart 

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:20.000
 God help and he will help 

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:23.920
