00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.430
 Hi everybody 

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:08.260
 it's steven and today I'm you 

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:09.160
 presents a new theme for iphone and 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.260
 ipod touch 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.570
 it's called event and that's the 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:15.490
 lockscreen you see that there are 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.890
 a great goal widgets with the time and the 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.630
 date so their on the holÃ  date just in 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.700
 underneath with a weather widget that you 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.570
 will indicate the weather of the day and the weather 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.550
 for the whole week 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.380
 so that's what it looks like 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.270
 lockscreen the unlock bar has 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.910
 also been modified and then found 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.199
 the springboard 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.460
 that's how it looks you see 

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:35.620
 than all application icons 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.329
 native bones so the one that I placed 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.940
 on the first page we were totally 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:41.920
 change the wallpaper to him the you 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.600
 see it's gray so it stays pretty 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.100
 simple but it helps to do well 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.929
 highlight the icons and what gives the 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.149
 final a very nice effect a theme 

00:00:46.929 --> 00:00:50.949
 really class with this gray background the 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:53.109
 application icons edit the 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:54.789
 folders with a red background and you 

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:57.789
 see that all the applications to the bel 

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:59.199
 and has been modified with event 

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:01.089
 native apps and that of the app 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:02.399
 store are not the only ones to change there 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:04.869
 you see for example or winterboard 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.820
 ifile is wrongly active they are 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:08.350
 applications of cydia and they too have 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.840
 a new design with this theme 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.770
 then there is a little clock widget 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.270
 we will come back to it later 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.100
 for now I'm going to show you that 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.469
 the design of a lot of application have 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.729
 been modified with the theme there by 

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:20.200
 example is the phone application 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:22.299
 you see we're staying again 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.609
 in gray tones it's still super classy 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:26.200
 so as I told you a lot 

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:27.820
 applications have seen their interface 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.950
 redo there I'm in the app 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.909
 clock and you see that clocks 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.649
 the tear 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:35.259
 the stopwatch and finally the menu of the 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:35.979
 timer have been totally redone this 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:36.909
 are not the only ones 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:39.640
 there are others for example 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:40.990
 the compass application here is the new 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.399
 interface once the theme is 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.020
 applied so I'll let you 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:45.520
 look you will open different 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.920
 applications you will see 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.630
 changes there is the dictaphone there 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.130
 also the application a brand new 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.359
 design 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.009
 So here I go not all the irons to 

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:55.689
 fire as I told you so much 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:56.799
 changes everywhere for the 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:58.659
 settings you also see a 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:59.200
 modification at the level of the icons on the 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:00.640
 left side 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.020
 so all the icons for them 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.670
 categories in the settings were 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.049
 modified whether it's the icons that 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.429
 come from native sections or 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:06.999
 so that of your applications you 

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:09.820
 will have installed 

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:11.650
 so we really have a great menu 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.470
 settings and if we will see in more detail 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.720
 by 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.190
 little in the section his veil how that's 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.940
 looks like once again everything has been 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.250
 amended 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.500
 the on off buttons are now gray and 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.180
 blue the little bar to increase or 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.890
 decrease the ringtone too she was 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.450
 modified you see what small breasts 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.730
 chrome buttons and that she too is 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.440
 blue here so I tell you again the 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.080
 settings menu is gorgeous the 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.830
 details have been changed 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.870
 now let's take a look at 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.430
 multitasking so I installed the 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.660
 tweak oxo that's why you see 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.320
 in this way there perceived from my 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.240
 applications 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.730
 but multitasking has also been 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.290
 changed with the theme event there you 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.209
 see the little bar for the volume and 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.470
 the control of music 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:50.390
 besides, music too 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.560
 the application has changed that's what she 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.090
 so again looks like a 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.010
 modification of the interface always 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.200
 in gray tones 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:59.510
 now here is the spotlight too 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.190
 a new look again with gray you 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.959
 see that the background is gray and we have a 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.860
 new keyboard so this keyboard you do not 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.150
 it's not just in the 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.980
 the spotlight on you would also by 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.690
 example in the notes in the sms in 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.920
 mobile safari wherever you have 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.660
 need to type text 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.160
 when I told you that all the little ones 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.290
 details have changed we notice 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.550
 again here since the indicator that you 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.350
 lets you tell if you are in mode 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.489
 ringtone or in silent mode and 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:22.160
 the volume indicator were 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:24.260
 modified with events we find 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.550
 gray of blue and above all we notice 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.670
 as I told you that the theme is 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:29.690
 extremely complete the screen of 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.790
 lock that I showed you to the 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.560
 video start with the weather widget and 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.380
 hours is not the only one available with 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.190
 the theme since here is a second 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.230
 finished gray right now 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.730
 a lot more colorful in the middle you 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.860
 have the theme logo and if we 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.540
 unlocks here is the springboard all 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.070
 the icons are the same of course 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.510
 it does not change the wallpaper is 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:47.900
 different it's the same as on the 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.700
 lockscreen 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.320
 and if we look at the center of 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.810
 notifications too is different 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.830
 with this wallpaper 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.600
 So now, I still have 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:58.100
 part of the theme I have not 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.680
 still spoken but you've seen it all at 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:02.570
 time it's the widgets with the 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.610
 tweak haye widget you will be able to them 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:06.530
 add on your home screen and the 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.850
 theme events offers you two I 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.980
 will start with the first and the 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.600
 widget with their veil what they 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.040
 look like you have a clock two 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.580
 needles and a second hand that turns into 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.170

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:18.329
 place where you want 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:20.340
 in the same way you can add 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:21.629
 the second budget this time this 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.330

 these themes are beautiful every time 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.139
 extremely complete and you see 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.069
