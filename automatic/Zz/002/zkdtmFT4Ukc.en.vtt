example like this wing yeah now a carbon

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.639 
example like this wing yeah now a carbon
fiber<00:01:47.739> wing<00:01:48.209> something<00:01:49.209> that<00:01:49.420> really<00:01:50.259> makes

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:50.649 
fiber wing something that really makes

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:52.859 
fiber wing something that really makes
the<00:01:50.830> car<00:01:51.009> look<00:01:51.250> that<00:01:51.759> much<00:01:51.970> sporty-er<00:01:52.450> but

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869 
the car look that much sporty-er but

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:54.809 
the car look that much sporty-er but
also<00:01:53.020> improves<00:01:53.560> the<00:01:53.770> aerodynamic<00:01:54.429> flow<00:01:54.640> of

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
to show you is the club let's check out

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:34.319 
to show you is the club let's check out
absolutely<00:02:30.180> here<00:02:31.180> we<00:02:31.269> are<00:02:31.799> now<00:02:32.819> they<00:02:33.819> will<00:02:34.060> be

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:34.329 
absolutely here we are now they will be

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:37.589 
absolutely here we are now they will be
left<00:02:34.989> hand<00:02:35.260> drive<00:02:35.610> this<00:02:36.610> case<00:02:36.879> right<00:02:37.329> hand

drive<00:02:37.810> so<00:02:38.200> you<00:02:38.230> may<00:02:38.500> think<00:02:38.560> that<00:02:38.920> that<00:02:39.069> would

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
drive so you may think that that would

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:40.830 
drive so you may think that that would
be<00:02:39.280> a<00:02:39.430> little<00:02:39.640> bit<00:02:39.849> of<00:02:39.940> an<00:02:40.030> inconvenience<00:02:40.299> but

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
be a little bit of an inconvenience but

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.800 
be a little bit of an inconvenience but
this<00:02:41.110> is<00:02:41.230> really<00:02:41.409> a<00:02:41.560> prototype<00:02:42.129> and<00:02:42.659> what<00:02:43.659> you

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
this is really a prototype and what you

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.110 
this is really a prototype and what you
see<00:02:43.840> is<00:02:44.049> that<00:02:44.409> it's<00:02:44.590> pure<00:02:44.890> clubman<00:02:45.370> from<00:02:45.970> the

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
see is that it's pure clubman from the

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.869 
see is that it's pure clubman from the
perspective<00:02:46.810> that<00:02:47.049> it<00:02:47.560> has<00:02:47.799> the<00:02:48.220> easy

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:48.879 
perspective that it has the easy

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:50.759 
perspective that it has the easy
functionality<00:02:49.810> for<00:02:50.079> getting<00:02:50.379> into<00:02:50.650> the

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
functionality for getting into the

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:55.890 
functionality for getting into the
backseat<00:02:52.950> but<00:02:53.950> underneath<00:02:54.430> the<00:02:54.760> bonnet<00:02:55.239> it

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
backseat but underneath the bonnet it

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.170 
backseat but underneath the bonnet it
has<00:02:56.170> the<00:02:56.200> heart<00:02:56.739> of<00:02:56.829> a<00:02:57.129> race<00:02:57.340> car<00:02:57.639> and<00:02:57.909> I'll<00:02:58.030> be

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
moment but it's a 208 horsepower mini

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:05.819 
moment but it's a 208 horsepower mini
motor<00:03:03.790> that<00:03:04.239> has<00:03:04.420> been<00:03:04.690> maxed<00:03:05.200> out<00:03:05.349> in<00:03:05.590> terms

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:05.829

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
miles per hour now sit and oh I think

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:18.809 
miles per hour now sit and oh I think
the<00:03:17.590> Assumption<00:03:17.950> with<00:03:18.069> the<00:03:18.159> clubman<00:03:18.519> is<00:03:18.609> that

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:18.819 
the Assumption with the clubman is that

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:20.460 
the Assumption with the clubman is that
ok<00:03:19.389> you<00:03:19.450> know<00:03:19.599> maybe<00:03:19.629> this<00:03:20.019> is<00:03:20.139> a<00:03:20.170> little<00:03:20.230> bit

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
ok you know maybe this is a little bit

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.589 
ok you know maybe this is a little bit
softer<00:03:21.010> mini<00:03:21.280> you<00:03:21.579> know<00:03:21.699> it's<00:03:22.030> a<00:03:22.120> maybe

00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:22.599 
softer mini you know it's a maybe

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:24.059 
softer mini you know it's a maybe

three electronic features that might be

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:57.439 
three electronic features that might be
of<00:04:54.660> interest<00:04:54.800> one<00:04:55.800> of<00:04:55.919> them<00:04:56.100> is<00:04:56.250> called<00:04:56.490> the

00:04:57.439 --> 00:04:57.449 
of interest one of them is called the

00:04:57.449 --> 00:04:59.480

control<00:05:28.800> so<00:05:29.340> it's<00:05:29.520> not<00:05:29.580> like<00:05:29.910> you're

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180 
control so it's not like you're

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.110 
control so it's not like you're
completely<00:05:30.630> ignoring<00:05:30.870> the<00:05:31.320> laws<00:05:31.470> of<00:05:31.500> physics

in<00:05:38.610> one<00:05:38.729> of<00:05:38.760> our<00:05:38.940> cars<00:05:39.150> is<00:05:39.449> the<00:05:39.599> sport<00:05:39.870> but<00:05:39.900> I<00:05:40.080> do

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:40.169 
in one of our cars is the sport but I do

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:42.320 
in one of our cars is the sport but I do
the<00:05:40.320> same<00:05:40.500> thing<00:05:40.710> and<00:05:40.889> you<00:05:41.699> know<00:05:41.820> it<00:05:41.970> well<00:05:42.120> is

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:42.330 
the same thing and you know it well is

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.029 
the same thing and you know it well is
being<00:05:42.870> an<00:05:42.990> owner<00:05:43.169> and<00:05:43.410> the<00:05:43.500> sport<00:05:43.800> button

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:44.039 
being an owner and the sport button

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:46.430 
being an owner and the sport button
gives<00:05:44.370> you<00:05:44.699> a<00:05:45.180> much<00:05:45.690> better<00:05:45.990> steering

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:46.440 
gives you a much better steering

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.439 
gives you a much better steering
response<00:05:46.650> a<00:05:47.099> quicker<00:05:47.310> steering<00:05:47.639> response<00:05:47.880> and

00:05:48.439 --> 00:05:48.449 
response a quicker steering response and

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:50.870 
response a quicker steering response and
a<00:05:48.900> much<00:05:49.110> faster<00:05:49.380> throttle<00:05:50.099> response<00:05:50.250> so<00:05:50.789> it

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:50.880 
a much faster throttle response so it

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.460 
a much faster throttle response so it
really<00:05:51.030> gives<00:05:51.120> you<00:05:51.360> the<00:05:51.539> opportunity<00:05:51.840> to<00:05:52.199> get

really gives you the opportunity to get

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:54.860 
really gives you the opportunity to get
the<00:05:52.650> most<00:05:52.860> out<00:05:53.160> of<00:05:53.190> it<00:05:53.400> well<00:05:53.880> you<00:05:54.030> know<00:05:54.210> in

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:54.870 
the most out of it well you know in
