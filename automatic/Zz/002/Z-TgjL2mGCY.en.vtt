00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.930
 good afternoon when better sometimes constantine 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.970
 I've just been a group of companies for 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:46.300
 fog and today instead of together our 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:48.159
 brand manager for compact and units we 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.729
 imagine a tent compact 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:53.799
 and curtain number 4 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:56.950
 I'm like tearing that number 4 means 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:58.540
 Of course weight up to 4 people with comfort 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.560
 two months in this tent will be yourself 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:04.330
 excellent module is obtained in detail 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.659
 bypass so the program and what is there 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:10.530
 there was this tent first of all 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:13.360
 interesting because he has a large vestibule 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:16.480
 there were can accommodate lim luggage 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:19.360
 either even balance bike is comfortable and 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.489
 comfortable and big she has two entrances to 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.040
 the input is good because firstly it 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:26.860
 convenient and secondly it is extra 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.860
 ventilation one move you can open here 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:34.690
 free will Podosinki why so 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:36.519
 here is the color of color stretch marks yellow for 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:40.580
 to be seen on the fact that just not 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:43.349
 stumble the gateway into this stretch 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:46.650
 woven display thread which 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:48.750
 the night time will allow you to quickly 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.569
 set up a tent guide was 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.819
 put the tent height 160 centimeters 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:56.940
 In principle, this is enough for 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:58.020
 so comfortable tradition is not much 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.070
 bend 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.070
 would be different. 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.599
 additional ventilation 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:09.290
 windows can be open when it is hot 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:11.489
 either close when it rains 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.230
 in such a way as to 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:14.970
 prevent moisture from entering like 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.370
 him so which are the most interesting and 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:21.110
 circles you are a space where faith must 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:24.120
 rest sleep what's interesting inside 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:27.930
 then look at the open entrance 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:30.239
 these are gentle here they protect from 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:33.150
 hitting the wind internally if there is 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:35.489
 strong wind means inner 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.920
 tent space represents 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:39.530
 and the inside tent and putting breathable 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:44.040
 of the material 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:46.500
 but the tents are made of polyethylene 120 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:51.329
 grams per square meter it says 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:55.019
 the fact that the floor can withstand water resistance 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:56.390
 over 10,000 meters of water column floor 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:04:00.120
 reinforced 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:02.519
 rest assured that it will not break when 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:06.150
 hitting a knot or on a stone was 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:08.970
 strong enough inside there 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:11.190
 shelf to store some 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:13.650
 small things either to 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:17.400
 hang the lantern and have 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:19.290
 there is a special ring here and the shelf 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.040
 there is an income before every entrance equip 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:22.949
 mosquito net 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.990
 each entrance is equipped with a mosquito net 

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:27.810
 can be used to completely close 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.740
 tight door or just leave 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:32.280
 mosquito net 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:45.090
 inside there are also pockets on both sides 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:47.370
 for small things ventilation tent there 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.840
 each side of the window that is opened 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.510
 also made sturmki 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:54.210
 if it rains hard you can help her 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:55.860
 close and not only that even if this 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.990
 window as you advise something to get 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:01.440
 inside the tent will not penetrate on 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:04.110
 I would like the inside 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:06.060
 add another thing around the perimeter of the tent 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:09.060
 here are made such amplification 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.610
 triangles to which the sling is attached 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:13.349
 points with a rubber band 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:18.180
 a bucket is installed there 

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:20.430
 to stretch the tent is such a clear 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:23.970
 this tent is compact and storm at war 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:26.789

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:30.199
