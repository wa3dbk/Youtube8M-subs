00:00:00.039 --> 00:00:03.030
 our moms total time on stock 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:04.770
 what are the forecasts especially the market 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:06.970
 real estate my personal opinion is that 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:09.120
 such as very serious stress from 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.740
 Brovary's fall will not be a little bit like 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.900
 Now why there is a rise 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.540
 that today there is a commission 

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:17.850
 money and accordingly 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.170
 deferred demand which was at the same time 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:21.699
 faster 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:25.560
 the floor can be divided into 100 in November 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.759
 children start the action at the end of December 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:30.759
 older they are not in demand 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:32.860
 at youth 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:34.960
 mass such drives 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.630
 therefore, everything will depend on 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:39.350
 public and now will be building 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.720
 if the construction remains a little 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.480
 then the new buildings went up 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.570
 unfortunately they are old apartments 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.589
 spokeswoman although she 

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:51.980
 room and fathers two-room 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:53.710
 the little ones were always in demand 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.710
 how should initial capital 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.539
 round when spaceships 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:01.770
 plowing the expanses of our universe 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.600
 many of our citizens are interested 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.090
 will there be anytime soon 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.150
 those citizens who want to buy they 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.310
 surely think that prices go up 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:13.540
 countless cube 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.900
 those citizens who sell they also 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.410
 happily waiting for when to get 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.510
 if you look 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.460
 in its height lived experience so 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.670
 spaceships and stuff other 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.820
 I can make the next forecast before 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.180
 the end of the year is now the month of November 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.850
 little by little the price will be January 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:34.850
 February March 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.710
 fastest stays in turkey 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.000
 which was recorded in December 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.940
 Further it will probably be because the price 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.250
 increased 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.450
 such a prognosis is favorable 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:45.990
 for all for sellers for 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.700
 a good time for 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.500
 less stable price 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.040
 it is possible to choose what 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.350
 built up happy 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.640
 its selling its buyer and well 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.700
 calmly decide your question 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:59.890
 any buyer 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.380
 face of crisis 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:03.299
 the fact that he 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.100
 going to purchase 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.790
 Yes, so why today talking about buying on 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.239
 real estate market then this is the price 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:13.729
 apartments rooms the fact that 

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:16.369
 so it is very difficult to give forecasts 

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:18.549
 so little observation experience from 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:19.539
 practice 

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:20.549
 they say that 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:22.650
 traditionally here when the present times 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:23.689
 Holocaust 

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:25.819
 people try to decide what the matter is 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:27.670
 the number associated with the acquisition 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.249
 real estate therefore 

00:02:30.249 --> 00:02:33.269
 dollars the demand increases if she returns to 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:35.819
 to that which is more likely such a feeling 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.259
 the fact that prices are rising because in the first 

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:40.839
 parts to disassemble the most running Sana b 

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:42.379
 inexpensive 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:43.789
 apartments 

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:46.699
 september october and even tougher middle 

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:47.799
 november 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:49.389
 deals have passed 

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:52.389
 started buying apartments 

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:55.769
 as for prices, prices have risen a bit 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:58.769
 regards to September rose 

00:02:59.759 --> 00:03:02.399
 when the purpose of persuading take their 

00:03:02.399 --> 00:03:05.029
 many more sum say every third 

00:03:05.029 --> 00:03:07.019
 I have a loan deal 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:08.639
 while they give loans 

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:10.909
 people buy apartments we will try 

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:13.509
 do something their people sell and 

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:16.540
 buy with surcharge his self report 

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:20.389
 Brazilian he is guardian response 

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:21.639
 concerning 

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:23.709
 what will happen next 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:25.429
 before the new year, I think this trend 

00:03:25.429 --> 00:03:28.429
 last after the new year what 

00:03:30.179 --> 00:03:32.169
 but here, too, depends on the economic 

00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:34.409
 position in the country 

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:36.589
 if they continue to give loans and 

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:38.609
 permutations 

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:41.039
 loan rates will decrease 

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:42.650
 will not buy apartments 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.560
 accordingly when there is a purchase price 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.129
 there will be a few guests if lifting credits 

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:49.549
 at prices it will be very heavy before 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:52.549
 him overwhelming percentage of people 

00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:54.789
 will take less loans 

00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:56.729
 Accordingly, the purchase will be less 

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:57.699
 prices can go down
