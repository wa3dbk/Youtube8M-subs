of cars waiting to turn and we can

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.970 
of cars waiting to turn and we can
actually<00:00:59.239> it<00:00:59.420> across<00:00:59.809> but<00:01:00.559> because<00:01:00.800> there's

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
actually it across but because there's

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.500 
actually it across but because there's
two<00:01:01.129> cars<00:01:01.399> there<00:01:01.579> we're<00:01:01.730> going<00:01:01.850> to<00:01:01.910> sit<00:01:02.120> at<00:01:02.360> the

the car hits brake lights going off

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.450 
the car hits brake lights going off
which<00:01:12.430> means<00:01:12.700> is<00:01:12.939> it<00:01:13.390> could<00:01:13.689> be<00:01:13.869> moving<00:01:14.400> so<00:01:15.400> I'm

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460 
which means is it could be moving so I'm

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.830 
which means is it could be moving so I'm
going<00:01:15.580> to<00:01:15.640> move<00:01:15.700> up<00:01:15.909> onto<00:01:16.270> the<00:01:16.540> crossing<00:01:18.840> car

checking the side road moving across the
crossroads

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.630 

and<00:02:13.290> the<00:02:13.380> next<00:02:13.590> crossroads<00:02:14.070> we're<00:02:14.280> turning

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
and the next crossroads we're turning

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.330 
and the next crossroads we're turning
right<00:02:15.200> so<00:02:16.200> lots<00:02:16.410> of<00:02:16.530> just<00:02:16.740> changed<00:02:17.130> grains

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
right so lots of just changed grains

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.920 
right so lots of just changed grains
we're<00:02:17.490> going<00:02:17.610> to<00:02:17.670> keep<00:02:17.790> it<00:02:17.970> nice<00:02:18.150> and<00:02:18.210> slow

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
we're going to keep it nice and slow

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.630 
we're going to keep it nice and slow
now<00:02:19.350> because<00:02:19.500> there's<00:02:19.800> two<00:02:19.950> cars<00:02:20.220> waiting<00:02:20.490> to

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
now because there's two cars waiting to

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.340 
now because there's two cars waiting to
turn<00:02:20.790> again<00:02:21.240> we're<00:02:21.840> going<00:02:21.960> to<00:02:22.020> hold<00:02:22.200> back

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
turn again we're going to hold back

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.320 
turn again we're going to hold back
behind<00:02:22.800> the<00:02:22.890> white<00:02:23.070> line<00:02:23.100> until<00:02:23.850> we<00:02:23.970> got<00:02:24.090> room

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
behind the white line until we got room

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.030 
behind the white line until we got room
to<00:02:24.480> move<00:02:24.690> out<00:02:24.870> onto<00:02:25.050> the<00:02:25.230> crossroads<00:02:28.040> another

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
to move out onto the crossroads another

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
to move out onto the crossroads another
cars<00:02:29.280> the<00:02:29.400> time<00:02:29.550> we're<00:02:29.730> going<00:02:29.820> to<00:02:29.880> move

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
cars the time we're going to move

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.660 
cars the time we're going to move
ourselves<00:02:30.530> looking<00:02:31.530> at<00:02:31.710> oncoming<00:02:32.160> traffic<00:02:32.430> to

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
ourselves looking at oncoming traffic to

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.610 
ourselves looking at oncoming traffic to
see<00:02:32.850> what<00:02:32.970> they're<00:02:33.120> actually<00:02:33.150> doing<00:02:33.450> car<00:02:34.440> head

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
see what they're actually doing car head

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.230 
see what they're actually doing car head
is<00:02:34.740> turning<00:02:34.980> to<00:02:35.160> the<00:02:35.190> right<00:02:35.430> so<00:02:35.730> that<00:02:35.820> means<00:02:36.030> we

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
is turning to the right so that means we

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.570 
is turning to the right so that means we
can<00:02:36.450> actually<00:02:36.720> move<00:02:36.810> across<00:02:36.990> the<00:02:37.230> road<00:02:37.580> which

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
can actually move across the road which

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.720 
can actually move across the road which
ecolo<00:02:38.880> mirror<00:02:39.090> is<00:02:39.180> a<00:02:39.210> made<00:02:39.450> progress
