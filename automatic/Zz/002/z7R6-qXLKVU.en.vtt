00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:11.020
 kandinsky is a painter not capitals not 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:12.880
 one of the great artists who 

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:15.369
 revolutionizes 20th century painting 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:18.430
 we are going to try to get closer to 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:20.320
 his life and his work if we have to talk 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.850
 a bit of the biography of kandinsky 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.150
 we will have to say that it is of origin 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:28.990
 Russian was born in a nearby Chinese area in 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:31.030
 the year 1866 although he received in other 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:34.149
 Russian areas such as Moscow 

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:36.129
 Odessa had a great interest in painting 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:37.780
 but it will not be until I see a 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:40.210
 exhibition of impressionists in Moscow 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.159
 when it finally decides for this 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:46.050
 option surprised by some of the 

00:00:42.159 --> 00:00:48.219
 works that could see there in the year 1895 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.989
 they will spend the next years of their lives 

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:52.629
 in germany settled in Munich 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:55.479
 mainly although the Russian revolution 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:57.579
 I limped him in Moscow and with the Russian regime 

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:59.800
 will collaborate for a few years in 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:02.829
 different educational projects for 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:05.650
 then return to Germany where your 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:07.659
 works were declared degenerate 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.580
 and many of them destroyed by the 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:11.280
 Nazi regime 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.410
 he devoted himself to teaching and they say it was 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.750
 very good teacher and also one of the 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:17.940
 great theorists of painting some 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.280
 of his writings are well known and 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:23.970
 appreciated by the critics having full 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:26.130
 currently valid for example his work 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.930
 of the spiritual in art 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.880
 often cited in many comments 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.700
 contemporary art by its conception 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.010
 about color and shapes in 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.940
 works spent his last days in france 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:41.520
 where he lived since 1939 and acquired 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:45.590
 the French nationality and dying 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.590
 there in the year 1944 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.729
 about technique we can say that 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.530
 when Kandinsky looked at a painting it was not 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.570
 for him the most important objects 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.820
 that appeared in the same but the 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.619
 colors that were part of the painting and 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.869
 the strength that they acquired in the work 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.539
 So in his work there is a 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.759
 evolution from the objectual realism in 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:11.340
 very close to fascism in the 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:14.280
 use of color to abstraction being 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.980
 a watercolor of his dictated in the year 1912 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.870
 in the first abstract work of all the 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.090
 art history through art 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.970
 abstract is produced according to the painter a 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:27.390
 new era of splendor for painting 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:29.220
 abstract art is a new language and 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.080
 as such a candice that said he should 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.299
 based mainly on color 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.900
 offering a gradation that was 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:38.880
 nice to the eyes his works little to 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.920
 little are getting closer to the abstraction 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.900
 geometric because it will be this kind of 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.599
 forms that predominate in his paintings 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.280
 combining dotted lines and the use of 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:49.830
 color as if it were a composition 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.470
 musical a hobby he had since 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.720
 young since I often listened 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.610
 music when he painted his paintings 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.010
 in your pictures for example the yellow 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.830
 it's a warm color in front of the blue that 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:04.200
 has a more cold atmosphere though 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.870
 it also represents calm clarity 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.240
 is the white and on the other hand the black 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:12.000
 represents darkness the white 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.380
 allows and the black denies represents the 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.900
 Eternal silence 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.510
 the red is warm cheerful and exhausted 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:21.120
 mixed with black produces brown 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.130
 that preludes some tension while 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.410
 if we mix it with yellow it produces us 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:28.620
 a warm and pleasant color as is the 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:33.080
 blue and yellow orange produce us 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.080
 green a color that alludes to the calm
