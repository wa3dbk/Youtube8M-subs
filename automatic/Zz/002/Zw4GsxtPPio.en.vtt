00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:08.519
 then show what we cling to 

00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:10.170
 wiring power for flush wiring 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.150
 recorder navigators 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.280
 radar detectors and so on means 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:18.090
 need to remove the skin as I have already described 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.340
 higher means the most ignition lock we have 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.039
 located 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:27.420
 then here he is 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:31.019
 the terminal neighbor rightly so here they 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.700
 suitable terminal is disconnected terminal 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.739
 starts attention as follows 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:44.480
 take pity I already connected means here 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:49.020
 we do not fool inconvenient means to hook 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:55.320
 red clip so here these red 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:58.649
 clip the most hook and drop down all 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:02.870
 she click for this we press 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:08.240
 respectively, the stopper and remove the connector 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:10.409
 gently swaying what it took out 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.900
 here it means easier for me to explain to him 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:16.979
 immediately connect the connection with us 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:19.259
 goes to the wire to read a lot c + ignition 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.020
 and then if that's blue . turn to 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:25.350
 here we have this blue stripes 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.270
 we get the third in a row from the left 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.729
 side purple wire 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.130
 if I am mistaken simply in pure purple 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.439
 yes there is no white then look 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:39.509
 the third wire is purple kiss more 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:41.549
 clear and we have the first coming 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.710
 purple with black with black stripe 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.020
 then there is no red wire and then just 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:51.140
 purple here to this this violet 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:55.290
 wire and is selling father c + 3 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:58.439
 on the left or on the right it is even centered 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.659
 is very recently not confused to 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:03.090
 it can be included in different ways 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.840
 can be soldered can be soldered on 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.939
 twist 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.910
 I made it so much not 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.810
 bother and not particularly interfere with 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.310
 full-time 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.400
 braid 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.860
 so how is it that how would she just 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:24.510
 clamps this wire thereby breaking through 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:24.510
 insulation and clinging to copper wire 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.910
 so if you can see it looks itself 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.769
 the design is rather small 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:36.849
 i.e. two 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:38.470
 I have to go for 25 volts and one 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:40.690
 12 volt ie radar detector 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:44.459
 smart up to 12 volts he passionately accounts 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:47.110
 just directly barely 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:49.480
 on the navigator and on the DVR not 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:53.819
 5 volts so itâ€™s not up to them 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:56.319
 native power supply 12 at 5 volts 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:59.140
 be sure to use fuses 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:02.430
 that is, I have 31 of them here because 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:06.190
 wait wait 2 here additional 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:10.840
 here's a plus I mean to 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:12.489
 goes minus apologize minus here it is 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:18.040
 passed is thin wire minus u 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:21.540
 me it goes in my body then guilt 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:24.160
 its all just not on the body came 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.840
 together get a lot of space not 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:31.290
 occupies 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:36.299
 neatly here she leaves us 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:40.120
 twine goes upstairs and so on 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:42.910
 places where occurs with a touch 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.530
 iron parts advise than 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.940
 seal and here with the plan did it 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.799
 so that it does not firstly cackle 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.750
 second since frayed 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:51.730
 well and also to ensure that she does not 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.000
 dangled fasten the whole thing just 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.480
 neatly not blue dragging 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.150
 regular stitches 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:03.390
 can see here 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:06.209
 now we put in place that is 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:11.420
 just turn it up for the first time 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:14.780
 and then until you click the second time, everything is possible 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.780
 collect all back
