00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:18.250
 hello youtube friends in this video les 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:21.190
 I will teach how to remove the 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:23.970
 annoying voice message as you see here 

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:23.970
 I have one 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:31.160
 s that is marked with the little ball 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:34.970
 red message from you 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:36.640
 but then although one to check the 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.980
 check it and all that is not deleted 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:42.920
 So the first thing we're going to do is 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:46.160
 This is available for devices 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.690
 with jailbreak then let's see if 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.559
 dya 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:54.460
 and let's open let's go find the tweet 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:54.460
 that it's called 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.879
 boix 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.020
 male remote 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.539
 here is 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.390
 we are going to give there and we are going to install it 

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:14.299
 this need to add no repo 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.429
 why because it comes in a 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:20.310
 pre-established laziness then what do you 

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:22.120
 let's give in install 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:26.220
 confirm 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.220
 and we will wait for it to be installed 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.880
 let's restart the string word 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:50.609
 you already know that it is quite annoying to have 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:52.350
 there the always good voice message does not 

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:54.770
 I know if for you for me the truth is 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.770
 yes 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.120
 here we go 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:04.150
 unlock it and as you see we still do not have 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.050
 what we are going to do is enter 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.050
 configuration 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.980
 and enter 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:13.980
 to the tweet 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.959
 here it is 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.920
 we will enable it 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:29.440
 ready 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.440
 let's go back 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:38.720
 nunes 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.720
 turn it off and turn it on 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.830
 and we hope it has been removed 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:55.640
 already once they start as they see no longer 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.640
 no voice message appears 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.700
 and no longer have that modest message of 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:05.099
 voice or soon if they come to leave 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.190
 a bag message anyway no 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:09.740
 they will disappear 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:12.680
 ok well I hope and I have served 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:15.830
 of much this tutorial the truth is that 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:18.680
 for me if it's something annoying and if you 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:21.650

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:25.570

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:28.580
 this about having the voice message there 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:31.400
