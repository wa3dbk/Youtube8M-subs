00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
protocol now Sam and you processor can

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:10.820 
protocol now Sam and you processor can
you<00:00:09.179> tell<00:00:09.389> us<00:00:09.420> about<00:00:09.540> that<00:00:09.840> sure<00:00:10.320> it's<00:00:10.650> our

you tell us about that sure it's our
next-generation<00:00:11.130> accelerated<00:00:12.059> processing

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
next-generation accelerated processing

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.600 
next-generation accelerated processing
unit<00:00:12.570> so<00:00:13.170> it's<00:00:13.380> code<00:00:13.559> name<00:00:13.740> Trinity<00:00:13.980> we're

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
unit so it's code name Trinity we're

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.039 
unit so it's code name Trinity we're
very<00:00:14.820> excited<00:00:14.940> about<00:00:15.269> this<00:00:15.509> processor

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
very excited about this processor

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.720 
very excited about this processor
because<00:00:16.289> we're<00:00:16.650> able<00:00:16.800> now<00:00:17.010> to<00:00:17.039> even<00:00:17.460> bring<00:00:17.609> the

because we're able now to even bring the

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.609 
because we're able now to even bring the
power<00:00:17.880> down<00:00:18.150> lower<00:00:18.390> for<00:00:18.690> better<00:00:19.140> battery<00:00:19.560> life

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
power down lower for better battery life

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.679 
power down lower for better battery life
but<00:00:20.430> at<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.580> same<00:00:20.820> time<00:00:21.029> we're<00:00:21.210> increasing

piece of silicon and why that's

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:56.840 
piece of silicon and why that's
important<00:01:56.070> is<00:01:56.159> when<00:01:56.310> you<00:01:56.399> look<00:01:56.579> at<00:01:56.700> what

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
important is when you look at what

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.609 
important is when you look at what
people<00:01:57.090> are<00:01:57.210> doing<00:01:57.360> with<00:01:57.659> their<00:01:57.689> PCs<00:01:58.290> today

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
really about entertainment and that's

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.760 
really about entertainment and that's
video<00:02:03.270> that's<00:02:03.719> aiming<00:02:04.079> and<00:02:04.409> of<00:02:04.469> course<00:02:04.649> they

I<00:02:19.650> spoken<00:02:19.950> to<00:02:20.100> in<00:02:20.220> cell<00:02:20.430> recently<00:02:20.820> about<00:02:20.940> the

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
I spoken to in cell recently about the

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.730 
I spoken to in cell recently about the
shoulder<00:02:21.270> issue<00:02:21.540> and<00:02:21.810> they<00:02:21.900> you<00:02:22.440> know<00:02:22.470> make<00:02:22.710> a

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
shoulder issue and they you know make a

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.680 
shoulder issue and they you know make a
lot<00:02:22.890> of<00:02:22.920> play<00:02:23.190> about<00:02:23.400> like<00:02:23.580> 22<00:02:24.030> nanometer<00:02:24.540> this

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
lot of play about like 22 nanometer this

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.690 
lot of play about like 22 nanometer this
whole<00:02:24.840> nanometer<00:02:25.380> is<00:02:25.530> she<00:02:25.650> seems<00:02:25.890> to<00:02:26.010> be<00:02:26.130> kind

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
whole nanometer is she seems to be kind

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.040 
whole nanometer is she seems to be kind
of<00:02:26.790> a<00:02:26.880> big<00:02:27.060> big<00:02:27.240> deal<00:02:27.420> I<00:02:27.450> mean<00:02:27.690> can<00:02:27.780> you<00:02:27.840> tell<00:02:28.020> us

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
of a big big deal I mean can you tell us

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.720 
of a big big deal I mean can you tell us
a<00:02:28.170> little<00:02:28.200> bit<00:02:28.380> about<00:02:28.590> the<00:02:28.800> Trinity<00:02:29.370> is<00:02:29.430> not<00:02:29.610> in

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
a little bit about the Trinity is not in

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.420 
a little bit about the Trinity is not in
the<00:02:29.820> station<00:02:30.120> or<00:02:30.390> its<00:02:30.660> 32<00:02:31.140> nanometer<00:02:31.440> but<00:02:31.980> you

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
the station or its 32 nanometer but you

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:33.710 
the station or its 32 nanometer but you
know<00:02:32.550> no<00:02:32.820> consumers<00:02:33.300> ever<00:02:33.480> bought<00:02:33.690> a

know no consumers ever bought a

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.840 
know no consumers ever bought a
nanometer<00:02:34.230> and<00:02:34.530> no<00:02:34.620> consumer<00:02:35.070> ever<00:02:35.250> well<00:02:35.490> it's

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.910 
nanometer and no consumer ever well it's
really<00:02:36.120> not<00:02:36.360> about<00:02:36.540> the<00:02:36.690> process<00:02:37.320> technology

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
really not about the process technology

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.400 
really not about the process technology
it's<00:02:38.610> really<00:02:39.270> about<00:02:39.390> the<00:02:39.780> technology<00:02:40.380> that

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
it's really about the technology that

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.170 
it's really about the technology that
can<00:02:40.650> drive<00:02:40.890> better<00:02:41.220> usages<00:02:41.880> better
