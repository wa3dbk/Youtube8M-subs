00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.140 
yeah this is what i use in the morning
and<00:02:07.890> then<00:02:08.399> at<00:02:08.700> night<00:02:09.179> I<00:02:10.220> use<00:02:11.220> they

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
and then at night I use they

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.440 
and then at night I use they
topical<00:02:12.750> and<00:02:13.049> it's<00:02:13.680> called<00:02:13.980> a<00:02:14.189> canyon<00:02:14.849> I<00:02:15.000> think

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
topical and it's called a canyon I think

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.600 
topical and it's called a canyon I think
it's<00:02:15.659> how<00:02:15.959> you<00:02:16.019> say<00:02:16.319> it<00:02:16.349> and<00:02:16.769> it<00:02:17.010> says<00:02:17.250> on<00:02:17.430> here

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
it's how you say it and it says on here

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.580 
it's how you say it and it says on here
to<00:02:17.819> jail<00:02:18.060> but<00:02:18.390> it<00:02:18.659> looks<00:02:19.140> more<00:02:19.379> like<00:02:19.560> a

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
to jail but it looks more like a

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.360 
to jail but it looks more like a
moisturizer<00:02:19.950> and<00:02:21.620> the<00:02:22.620> reason<00:02:22.950> I<00:02:23.010> use<00:02:23.040> this

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
moisturizer and the reason I use this

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.610 
moisturizer and the reason I use this
one<00:02:23.610> at<00:02:23.730> night<00:02:24.030> is<00:02:24.329> because<00:02:24.659> it<00:02:25.260> leaves<00:02:25.500> your

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
one at night is because it leaves your

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.860 
one at night is because it leaves your
skin<00:02:25.739> feeling<00:02:25.890> more<00:02:26.400> oily<00:02:27.000> and<00:02:27.209> I<00:02:27.269> don't<00:02:27.510> want

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
skin feeling more oily and I don't want

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.559 
skin feeling more oily and I don't want
am<00:02:28.290> looking<00:02:28.650> more<00:02:28.799> oily<00:02:29.400> as<00:02:29.519> well<00:02:29.700> so<00:02:30.450> I<00:02:30.480> don't

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
am looking more oily as well so I don't

want<00:02:31.230> that<00:02:31.379> look<00:02:31.799> or<00:02:32.099> feeling<00:02:32.549> during<00:02:32.730> the<00:02:32.909> day

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.319 
want that look or feeling during the day

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:37.009 
want that look or feeling during the day

it as well and this is what it looks

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.770 
it as well and this is what it looks
like<00:03:34.440> my<00:03:35.099> dermatologist<00:03:35.849> told<00:03:36.000> myself<00:03:36.239> look

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
like my dermatologist told myself look

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.159 
like my dermatologist told myself look
acid<00:03:37.230> dries<00:03:37.590> the<00:03:37.919> skin<00:03:37.949> out<00:03:38.400> more<00:03:39.359> than<00:03:39.870> a

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:40.169 
acid dries the skin out more than a

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:42.110 
acid dries the skin out more than a
regular<00:03:40.470> moisturizer<00:03:40.919> would<00:03:41.609> that<00:03:41.790> didn't

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
regular moisturizer would that didn't

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.469 
regular moisturizer would that didn't
have<00:03:42.299> salicylic<00:03:42.989> acid<00:03:43.319> in<00:03:43.409> it<00:03:43.500> so<00:03:44.280> i<00:03:44.819> think<00:03:45.120> i

00:03:45.469 --> 00:03:45.479 
have salicylic acid in it so i think i

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:47.569 
have salicylic acid in it so i think i
need<00:03:45.659> to<00:03:45.690> switch<00:03:46.440> moisturizers<00:03:47.220> since<00:03:47.459> my

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579 
need to switch moisturizers since my

so i would recommend this if you have
oily<00:04:03.329> skin<00:04:03.540> it<00:04:04.019> would<00:04:04.199> work<00:04:04.229> very<00:04:04.650> well<00:04:04.949> um<00:04:06.290> so

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
oily skin it would work very well um so

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.729 
oily skin it would work very well um so
