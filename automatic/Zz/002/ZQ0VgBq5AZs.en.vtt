00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:51.820
 I'm going to put that I'm going to put 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:54.610

 shit from youtube lets me upload the video 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:02.250
 is that yesterday I had gone up with the 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:02.250
 names of the two fighters but 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:09.299
 but they fucked me and they did not let me upload it 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.219
 because he said he was 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.219
 [Music] 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:20.150
 I was doing a fraud 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:22.840
 basically that was not the fight anymore 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.930
 that was not real 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.760
 so 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.550
 [Music] 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.020
 I'll see if uploading it with the 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:33.590
 Name (s 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:38.469
 Written badly I can not upload worth from 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.469

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:49.910
 I live or spell sleeve you have 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.510
 some shits and searches 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:55.350
 [Applause] 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.350
 why 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.540
 already they know that is the shit 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.820
 youtube that does not leave me since it does not leave 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:06.800
 doing nothing is not doing a shit you 're not going 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.800
 to put a name does not let you put music 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.300
 but even that would not stop me from climbing 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.220
 the video does not stop me uploading videos from w 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:20.060
 weight that the truth that is a game that 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.460
 I like it a lot, I 'm pretty cool 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.340
 as they would say out there 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:24.840
 [Applause] 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.250
 good at this time because he was very 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:31.080
 couple fight 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.080
 yes i am a china 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:37.460
 I would like to play the mode 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:40.970
 in career mode where we're going 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:44.100
 climbing from the lowest to 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:47.010
 [Music] 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:49.520
 catch good to win the heavyweight 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.520
 championship 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:58.390
 I have it in legend mode something else 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:04.870
 the most difficult way they have 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.870
 because the truth is that increase 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.049
 however also place in the others 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.049
 ways 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.330
 [Music] 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:26.360
 tactile tag mode 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.360
 [Applause] 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.069
 not if they are giving me it is accepted 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.040

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.040
 shit 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:56.980
 [Music] 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.660
 sporting 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:08.699
 [Music] 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:08.699
 [Applause] 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.640
 and I'm ready, as you can see the 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.840
 side 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:18.989
 down left 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:23.180
 I got a p that is like to perform 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.180
 a personal movement and here I said 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:31.860
 and we will try to do what the good 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:35.190
 the special or definitive film I 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:38.160
 I think if I do I could win 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:39.630
 here we have it I think no no no no like 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.700
 you can observe I just made a 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:48.960
 reversal 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:52.819
 [Applause] 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.819
 good special play 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:05:00.900
 and I also block it to adhere 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.900
 [Applause] 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:06.110
 [Applause] 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:22.600

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:22.600
 back 

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:34.439
 then you know if the video stuff that 

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:39.419
 however, he still does not feel 

00:05:34.439 --> 00:05:42.800
 excellent I have again what is a 

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:42.800
 personal movement here 

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:47.760
 the personal movement that is so 

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:50.840
 known from iuc al sitme 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.840
 from jong china 

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:58.229
 I believe that if I can do here the 

00:05:54.219 --> 00:05:58.229
 auction will be the end of the fight 

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:08.710
 forever 

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:11.670
 and once we go with the speed 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:18.500

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:18.500
 and we have the victory for joe china 

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.169

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:32.270
 that when I 

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:32.270
 a blockade the auction 

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:40.220
 then you know if they see that suddenly 

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:44.990
 is the bad name of the wrestlers 

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:49.230

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:58.140

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:59.820
