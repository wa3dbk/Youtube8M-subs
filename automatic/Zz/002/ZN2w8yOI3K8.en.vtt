00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.879 
remote but if you have an Android Vice
any<00:02:26.459> Android<00:02:26.730> device<00:02:26.760> and<00:02:27.209> i'm<00:02:27.480> in<00:02:27.720> an<00:02:28.530> iphone

um there's

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.089 
um there's
app<00:02:30.269> in<00:02:30.569> there<00:02:30.720> that<00:02:30.900> works<00:02:31.530> really<00:02:31.920> really

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
app in there that works really really

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:35.890 
app in there that works really really
well<00:02:32.370> I<00:02:32.790> mean<00:02:33.150> at<00:02:33.330> times<00:02:33.510> I<00:02:33.720> think<00:02:33.750> that<00:02:34.230> that

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
well I mean at times I think that that

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.720 
well I mean at times I think that that
the<00:02:36.900> app<00:02:37.049> for<00:02:37.319> Android<00:02:38.069> works<00:02:38.280> a<00:02:38.519> bit<00:02:38.700> better

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
the app for Android works a bit better

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.809 
the app for Android works a bit better
than<00:02:39.120> the<00:02:39.180> remote<00:02:39.629> maybe<00:02:40.019> it's<00:02:40.200> just<00:02:40.260> me<00:02:40.590> but

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:40.819 
than the remote maybe it's just me but

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:43.309 
than the remote maybe it's just me but
you<00:02:41.819> know<00:02:41.909> I<00:02:41.940> find<00:02:42.209> to<00:02:42.299> be<00:02:42.330> more<00:02:42.720> responsive

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
you know I find to be more responsive

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:46.160 
you know I find to be more responsive
than<00:02:43.349> our<00:02:43.530> mo<00:02:43.709> even<00:02:43.980> other<00:02:44.099> almost<00:02:44.280> is<00:02:44.849> um<00:02:45.170> you

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
than our mo even other almost is um you

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.539 
than our mo even other almost is um you
know<00:02:46.260> accurate<00:02:46.709> at<00:02:46.829> this<00:02:46.950> but<00:02:47.129> at<00:02:47.250> its<00:02:47.400> best

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
know accurate at this but at its best

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:50.990 
know accurate at this but at its best
but<00:02:47.970> you<00:02:48.349> know<00:02:49.349> I<00:02:49.590> guess<00:02:49.950> that's<00:02:50.190> based<00:02:50.760> on<00:02:50.879> my

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
but you know I guess that's based on my

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.539 
but you know I guess that's based on my
opinion<00:02:51.060> but<00:02:51.590> overall<00:02:52.590> the<00:02:52.829> Roku<00:02:53.190> is<00:02:53.220> very

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 
opinion but overall the Roku is very

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:56.690 
opinion but overall the Roku is very
nice<00:02:53.760> for<00:02:54.090> fifty<00:02:54.720> dollars<00:02:55.049> your<00:02:55.739> I<00:02:55.950> don't<00:02:56.549> see
