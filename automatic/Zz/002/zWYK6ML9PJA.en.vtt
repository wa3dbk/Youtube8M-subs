okay guys mores a year again another
update<00:00:03.570> to<00:00:04.080> the<00:00:04.350> last<00:00:04.740> video<00:00:04.920> I<00:00:05.130> made<00:00:05.400> I<00:00:06.319> went

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
update to the last video I made I went

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.830 
update to the last video I made I went
ahead<00:00:07.410> and<00:00:07.589> made<00:00:08.309> a<00:00:08.580> version<00:00:08.940> that<00:00:09.210> is

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
ahead and made a version that is

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.620 
ahead and made a version that is
completely<00:00:10.650> clean<00:00:10.920> on<00:00:11.130> the<00:00:11.250> inside<00:00:11.610> so<00:00:12.269> now

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
completely clean on the inside so now

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.220 
completely clean on the inside so now
you<00:00:12.719> can't<00:00:12.960> see<00:00:13.200> any<00:00:13.440> of<00:00:13.530> the<00:00:13.769> wiring<00:00:15.230> it's

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
you can't see any of the wiring it's

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.099 
you can't see any of the wiring it's
only<00:00:16.619> two<00:00:17.609> blocks<00:00:17.820> bigger<00:00:18.210> in<00:00:18.449> one<00:00:18.600> direction

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
only two blocks bigger in one direction

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.140 
only two blocks bigger in one direction
so<00:00:19.140> now<00:00:19.619> instead<00:00:19.770> of<00:00:19.980> a<00:00:20.070> four<00:00:20.279> by<00:00:20.430> six<00:00:20.460> it's<00:00:21.029> a

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
so now instead of a four by six it's a

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.109 
so now instead of a four by six it's a
six<00:00:21.420> by<00:00:21.630> six<00:00:22.430> which<00:00:23.430> is<00:00:23.580> still<00:00:23.789> pretty<00:00:23.970> small

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
six by six which is still pretty small

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.130 
six by six which is still pretty small
and<00:00:24.949> it<00:00:25.949> also<00:00:26.160> still<00:00:26.609> goes<00:00:26.789> up<00:00:27.029> and<00:00:27.300> down<00:00:27.359> but

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
and it also still goes up and down but

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.529 
and it also still goes up and down but
now<00:00:28.650> we<00:00:28.710> have<00:00:28.949> this<00:00:29.130> nice<00:00:29.760> little<00:00:29.789> room<00:00:30.300> to

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
now we have this nice little room to

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.709 
now we have this nice little room to
write<00:00:30.720> in<00:00:30.929> so<00:00:31.410> let's<00:00:32.279> let's<00:00:33.120> have<00:00:33.300> a<00:00:33.329> look<00:00:33.570> at

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
write in so let's let's have a look at

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:49.599 
write in so let's let's have a look at
it<00:00:35.090> I'll<00:00:36.090> turn<00:00:36.390> it<00:00:36.570> on<00:00:36.690> and<00:00:37.020> why<00:00:37.320> were<00:00:37.530> quick

00:00:49.599 --> 00:00:49.609 

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:53.229 

so<00:00:50.390> we<00:00:50.690> can<00:00:50.839> walk<00:00:51.050> into<00:00:51.320> here<00:00:51.760> push<00:00:52.760> the<00:00:52.940> button

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
so we can walk into here push the button

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:58.599 
so we can walk into here push the button
now<00:00:55.809> this<00:00:56.809> time<00:00:57.050> it<00:00:57.199> works<00:00:57.350> fine

00:00:58.599 --> 00:00:58.609 
now this time it works fine

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:00.789 
now this time it works fine
last<00:00:59.600> time<00:00:59.780> I<00:00:59.839> was<00:01:00.019> glitching<00:01:00.289> a<00:01:00.469> little<00:01:00.679> bit

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:00.799 
last time I was glitching a little bit

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:03.600 
last time I was glitching a little bit
but<00:01:01.039> this<00:01:01.129> times<00:01:02.019> absolutely<00:01:03.019> fine<00:01:03.289> because

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:03.610 
but this times absolutely fine because

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.700 
but this times absolutely fine because
I'm<00:01:04.610> riding<00:01:05.000> on<00:01:05.089> top<00:01:05.239> of<00:01:05.390> blocks<00:01:05.630> now<00:01:05.930> rather

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
I'm riding on top of blocks now rather

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.859 
I'm riding on top of blocks now rather
than<00:01:06.860> on<00:01:06.950> top<00:01:07.130> of<00:01:07.250> the<00:01:07.310> Pistons<00:01:07.759> as<00:01:08.479> you<00:01:08.720> can

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 
than on top of the Pistons as you can

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:11.080 
than on top of the Pistons as you can
see<00:01:09.080> there's<00:01:09.350> no<00:01:10.039> wiring<00:01:10.310> visible<00:01:10.789> which<00:01:10.939> is

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
see there's no wiring visible which is

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.690 
see there's no wiring visible which is
cool<00:01:11.330> we're<00:01:12.289> up<00:01:12.380> at<00:01:12.470> the<00:01:12.560> top<00:01:12.770> here<00:01:12.799> so<00:01:13.399> let's

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
cool we're up at the top here so let's

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:24.050 
cool we're up at the top here so let's
go<00:01:13.850> back<00:01:13.880> in<00:01:14.240> and<00:01:14.509> we'll<00:01:14.630> go<00:01:14.750> back<00:01:14.899> down

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:30.310 

no<00:01:24.720> problems<00:01:25.200> at<00:01:25.470> all<00:01:27.079> all<00:01:28.079> right<00:01:28.140> let's<00:01:28.770> say<00:01:29.040> I

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
you can see in here absolutely no wiring

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:44.060 
you can see in here absolutely no wiring
pretty<00:01:38.310> cool

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.160 

and<00:02:06.570> their<00:02:07.200> worries<00:02:08.360> alright<00:02:09.360> guys<00:02:09.600> this<00:02:10.110> is

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
and their worries alright guys this is

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.190 
and their worries alright guys this is
the<00:02:10.410> elevator<00:02:11.340> or<00:02:11.520> strip<00:02:11.819> back<00:02:12.060> that's<00:02:12.989> the

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
the elevator or strip back that's the

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.530 
the elevator or strip back that's the
one<00:02:13.290> over<00:02:13.560> there<00:02:13.680> that<00:02:13.739> I<00:02:13.920> was<00:02:14.100> riding<00:02:14.280> in<00:02:14.550> this

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
one over there that I was riding in this

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.070 
one over there that I was riding in this
one<00:02:15.780> has<00:02:16.080> no<00:02:16.440> frilly<00:02:17.160> bits<00:02:17.310> and<00:02:17.880> as<00:02:18.780> you<00:02:18.930> can

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
one has no frilly bits and as you can

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:25.040 
one has no frilly bits and as you can
see<00:02:19.319> it's<00:02:19.860> pretty<00:02:20.630> compact<00:02:23.660> again<00:02:24.660> just<00:02:24.930> a

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
see it's pretty compact again just a

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.770 
see it's pretty compact again just a
simple<00:02:25.310> repeating<00:02:26.310> pattern<00:02:26.850> I<00:02:27.030> have<00:02:27.330> used

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
simple repeating pattern I have used

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.440 
simple repeating pattern I have used
repeaters<00:02:28.380> this<00:02:28.590> time<00:02:28.890> just<00:02:29.220> to<00:02:29.550> reduce<00:02:30.000> the

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
repeaters this time just to reduce the

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.750 
repeaters this time just to reduce the
size<00:02:30.720> a<00:02:30.750> bit<00:02:31.110> I<00:02:31.410> could<00:02:32.100> actually<00:02:32.250> make<00:02:32.640> it

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
size a bit I could actually make it

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.840 
size a bit I could actually make it
without<00:02:32.880> the<00:02:33.209> repeaters<00:02:33.690> but<00:02:33.959> the<00:02:34.260> size<00:02:34.500> would

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
without the repeaters but the size would

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.790 
without the repeaters but the size would
expand<00:02:35.850> quite<00:02:36.180> a<00:02:36.239> bit<00:02:36.450> so<00:02:36.750> using<00:02:37.709> the

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
expand quite a bit so using the

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.199 
expand quite a bit so using the
repeaters<00:02:38.250> I<00:02:38.280> think<00:02:38.640> is<00:02:38.819> a<00:02:38.850> bit<00:02:39.030> of<00:02:39.150> a

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
repeaters I think is a bit of a

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.290 
repeaters I think is a bit of a
sacrifice<00:02:39.420> for<00:02:40.200> how<00:02:40.980> clean<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:41.610> inside<00:02:41.640> looks

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
sacrifice for how clean the inside looks

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:49.190 
sacrifice for how clean the inside looks
which<00:02:43.230> is<00:02:43.440> awesome<00:02:44.720> this<00:02:45.720> one<00:02:46.910> has<00:02:48.019> you<00:02:49.019> can

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
which is awesome this one has you can

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.690 
which is awesome this one has you can
see<00:02:49.470> here<00:02:49.680> actually<00:02:49.830> we<00:02:50.160> have<00:02:50.280> floating

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
see here actually we have floating

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.920 
see here actually we have floating
buttons<00:02:52.069> they<00:02:53.069> do<00:02:53.130> that<00:02:53.459> by<00:02:53.790> operating<00:02:54.540> sort

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
buttons they do that by operating sort

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.900 
buttons they do that by operating sort
of<00:02:54.989> like<00:02:55.110> a<00:02:55.140> bud<00:02:55.410> switch<00:02:55.709> so<00:02:56.069> when<00:02:56.250> I<00:02:56.280> when<00:02:56.880> I

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
of like a bud switch so when I when I

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.100 
of like a bud switch so when I when I
press<00:02:57.209> the<00:02:57.330> button<00:02:57.360> here<00:02:58.310> that<00:02:59.310> will<00:03:00.110> normally

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
press the button here that will normally

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.940 
press the button here that will normally
not<00:03:01.350> do<00:03:02.130> anything<00:03:02.430> but<00:03:03.420> if<00:03:03.780> like<00:03:04.500> adjusted

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
not do anything but if like adjusted

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:10.180 
not do anything but if like adjusted
then<00:03:05.130> but<00:03:05.790> if<00:03:06.000> this<00:03:06.239> is<00:03:06.450> turned<00:03:07.230> on<00:03:07.739> and

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.949 

there's<00:03:11.190> a<00:03:11.250> redstone<00:03:12.060> signal<00:03:12.360> being<00:03:12.720> updated

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
there's a redstone signal being updated

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:18.380 
there's a redstone signal being updated
nearby<00:03:13.590> when<00:03:14.459> I<00:03:14.489> push<00:03:14.790> the<00:03:14.970> button<00:03:16.549> it<00:03:17.549> does

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
nearby when I push the button it does

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.210 
nearby when I push the button it does
extend<00:03:18.810> that<00:03:18.930> piston<00:03:19.320> that's<00:03:19.680> how<00:03:19.799> I<00:03:19.829> make<00:03:20.070> the

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
extend that piston that's how I make the

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.180 
extend that piston that's how I make the
switches<00:03:20.640> reach<00:03:21.090> down<00:03:21.359> so<00:03:21.600> far<00:03:21.870> and<00:03:22.290> also<00:03:22.980> how

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
switches reach down so far and also how

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.380 
switches reach down so far and also how
we<00:03:23.910> can<00:03:24.060> have<00:03:24.269> a<00:03:24.859> too<00:03:25.859> high<00:03:26.070> button<00:03:26.430> stand<00:03:27.090> like

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
we can have a too high button stand like

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.810 
we can have a too high button stand like
that<00:03:27.630> so<00:03:28.530> as<00:03:28.829> you<00:03:28.950> can<00:03:29.040> see<00:03:29.100> this<00:03:29.370> guy's<00:03:29.579> going

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
that so as you can see this guy's going

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.220 
that so as you can see this guy's going
up<00:03:30.410> there<00:03:31.410> is<00:03:31.530> no<00:03:31.769> little

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
up there is no little

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.580 
up there is no little
he<00:03:33.680> built<00:03:34.310> onto<00:03:34.489> this<00:03:34.670> one<00:03:35.140> and<00:03:36.140> this<00:03:36.290> sort<00:03:36.530> of

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
he built onto this one and this sort of

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.369 
he built onto this one and this sort of
demonstrates<00:03:36.770> how<00:03:37.510> the<00:03:38.510> room<00:03:38.930> gets<00:03:39.170> moved

00:03:39.369 --> 00:03:39.379 
demonstrates how the room gets moved

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:40.990 
demonstrates how the room gets moved
around<00:03:39.560> I<00:03:39.980> actually<00:03:40.220> have<00:03:40.459> two<00:03:40.640> sets<00:03:40.910> of

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
around I actually have two sets of

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.880 
around I actually have two sets of
Pistons<00:03:41.420> one<00:03:41.750> at<00:03:41.870> the<00:03:41.959> bottom<00:03:42.260> one<00:03:42.410> at<00:03:42.530> the<00:03:42.650> top

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
Pistons one at the bottom one at the top

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.660 
Pistons one at the bottom one at the top
and<00:03:44.379> when<00:03:45.379> the<00:03:45.500> Pistons<00:03:45.860> run<00:03:46.010> into<00:03:46.280> something

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
and when the Pistons run into something

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:48.280 
and when the Pistons run into something
that<00:03:46.700> won't<00:03:47.030> move<00:03:47.330> they<00:03:47.720> actually<00:03:48.019> change

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
that won't move they actually change

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.559 
that won't move they actually change
direction<00:03:48.650> and<00:03:48.890> go<00:03:49.040> backwards<00:03:49.489> so<00:03:50.300> you<00:03:50.330> can

00:03:50.559 --> 00:03:50.569 
direction and go backwards so you can

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:52.509 
direction and go backwards so you can
see<00:03:50.720> how<00:03:50.870> that<00:03:51.019> one<00:03:51.170> went<00:03:51.319> up<00:03:51.560> hit<00:03:52.010> the<00:03:52.160> Pistons

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:52.519 
see how that one went up hit the Pistons

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:55.089 
see how that one went up hit the Pistons
at<00:03:52.640> the<00:03:52.730> top<00:03:52.940> and<00:03:53.209> came<00:03:53.390> back<00:03:53.420> down<00:03:53.750> again<00:03:54.019> so<00:03:54.709> I

00:03:55.089 --> 00:03:55.099 
at the top and came back down again so I

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:57.100 
at the top and came back down again so I
was<00:03:55.400> trying<00:03:55.700> to<00:03:55.760> work<00:03:55.910> out<00:03:56.150> before<00:03:56.360> how<00:03:56.780> I<00:03:56.810> was

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110 
was trying to work out before how I was

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:01.000 
was trying to work out before how I was
going<00:03:57.290> to<00:03:57.349> make<00:03:58.040> a<00:03:58.069> movable<00:03:59.140> room<00:04:00.140> and<00:04:00.709> then<00:04:00.890> I

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
going to make a movable room and then I

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.449 
going to make a movable room and then I
just<00:04:01.250> realized<00:04:01.489> that<00:04:01.989> if<00:04:02.989> I<00:04:03.200> just<00:04:03.260> have<00:04:03.620> a<00:04:03.650> room

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:04.459 
just realized that if I just have a room

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:07.000 
just realized that if I just have a room
that<00:04:04.790> hits<00:04:05.030> something<00:04:05.330> these<00:04:06.290> pistons<00:04:06.830> would

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
that hits something these pistons would

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:08.920 
that hits something these pistons would
go<00:04:07.190> down<00:04:07.430> the<00:04:07.640> room<00:04:07.790> would<00:04:07.970> stay<00:04:08.239> up<00:04:08.390> there<00:04:08.599> and

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
go down the room would stay up there and

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:10.809 
go down the room would stay up there and
they've<00:04:09.110> heard<00:04:09.349> more<00:04:09.560> on<00:04:09.739> top<00:04:10.010> than<00:04:10.700> when<00:04:10.790> I

00:04:10.809 --> 00:04:10.819 
they've heard more on top than when I

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:12.610 
they've heard more on top than when I
want<00:04:11.030> to<00:04:11.060> go<00:04:11.150> down<00:04:11.420> those<00:04:11.690> Pistons<00:04:12.110> will<00:04:12.349> push

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
want to go down those Pistons will push

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.309 
want to go down those Pistons will push
the<00:04:12.799> room<00:04:12.980> down<00:04:13.310> again<00:04:13.640> so<00:04:13.940> it<00:04:14.690> was<00:04:14.840> actually<00:04:14.959> a

00:04:15.309 --> 00:04:15.319 
the room down again so it was actually a

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:17.620 
the room down again so it was actually a
pretty<00:04:15.709> simple<00:04:16.130> fix<00:04:16.760> that<00:04:17.090> was<00:04:17.209> a<00:04:17.239> part<00:04:17.479> I<00:04:17.540> was

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
pretty simple fix that was a part I was

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:19.240 
pretty simple fix that was a part I was
most<00:04:17.870> worried<00:04:18.169> about<00:04:18.229> but<00:04:18.950> it's<00:04:19.070> a<00:04:19.100> pretty

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
most worried about but it's a pretty

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.879 
most worried about but it's a pretty
simple<00:04:19.549> fix<00:04:19.760> and<00:04:20.229> yeah<00:04:21.229> I'm<00:04:21.470> really<00:04:21.709> happy

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:21.889 
simple fix and yeah I'm really happy

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:25.930 
simple fix and yeah I'm really happy
with<00:04:22.070> the<00:04:22.220> result<00:04:23.080> yeah<00:04:24.110> so<00:04:24.470> it's<00:04:24.940> probably

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940 
with the result yeah so it's probably

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:27.940 
with the result yeah so it's probably
even<00:04:26.060> a<00:04:26.510> bit<00:04:26.870> better<00:04:27.050> than<00:04:27.290> the<00:04:27.350> last<00:04:27.530> one<00:04:27.830> I

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950 
even a bit better than the last one I

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:30.219 
even a bit better than the last one I
made<00:04:28.220> obviously<00:04:29.030> the<00:04:29.210> last<00:04:29.389> ones<00:04:29.660> tiny<00:04:30.050> bit

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:30.229 
made obviously the last ones tiny bit

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:33.190 
made obviously the last ones tiny bit
smaller<00:04:30.820> but<00:04:31.820> yeah<00:04:32.060> this<00:04:32.210> one<00:04:32.450> looks<00:04:32.630> quite<00:04:33.169> a

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:33.200 
smaller but yeah this one looks quite a

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:36.340 
smaller but yeah this one looks quite a
bit<00:04:33.290> nicer<00:04:33.760> so<00:04:34.990> hopefully<00:04:35.990> I'll<00:04:36.080> be<00:04:36.110> able<00:04:36.229> to

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350 
bit nicer so hopefully I'll be able to

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:39.279 
bit nicer so hopefully I'll be able to
make<00:04:36.470> a<00:04:36.500> bit<00:04:36.800> of<00:04:36.889> a<00:04:36.979> tutorial<00:04:37.190> soon<00:04:37.820> and<00:04:38.150> I<00:04:38.780> just

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:39.289 
make a bit of a tutorial soon and I just

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:42.540 
make a bit of a tutorial soon and I just
sort<00:04:39.470> of<00:04:39.560> update<00:04:39.950> you<00:04:40.070> on<00:04:40.100> this<00:04:40.630> new<00:04:41.630> design
