those for about five minutes or until
they're<00:03:49.450> tender<00:03:49.690> and<00:03:50.650> then<00:03:50.830> we'll<00:03:50.980> put<00:03:51.100> a<00:03:51.160> lid

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
they're tender and then we'll put a lid

they're tender and then we'll put a lid
on<00:03:51.340> it<00:03:51.610> and<00:03:51.820> just<00:03:51.880> set<00:03:52.540> them<00:03:52.690> aside<00:03:52.780> until<00:03:53.200> a

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
on it and just set them aside until a

00:03:53.620 --> 00:04:07.150 
on it and just set them aside until a
risotto<00:03:53.890> is<00:03:54.160> ready

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.950
