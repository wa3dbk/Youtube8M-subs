I fill it up just below the curvature of

I fill it up just below the curvature of
the<00:04:21.190> glass<00:04:22.650> we're<00:04:23.650> going<00:04:23.770> to<00:04:23.830> need<00:04:23.920> a<00:04:23.950> little

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
the glass we're going to need a little

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:29.340 
the glass we're going to need a little
more<00:04:24.610> than<00:04:24.850> that<00:04:27.150> as<00:04:28.150> I<00:04:28.390> said<00:04:28.600> this<00:04:28.720> is<00:04:28.780> already

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350 
more than that as I said this is already

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:33.630 
more than that as I said this is already
pre-mixed<00:04:30.450> fifty-fifty<00:04:31.450> so<00:04:31.750> I<00:04:32.440> have<00:04:33.280> seen

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:33.640 
pre-mixed fifty-fifty so I have seen

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.150 
pre-mixed fifty-fifty so I have seen
people<00:04:34.150> use<00:04:34.780> just<00:04:35.200> straight<00:04:35.530> apple<00:04:35.950> cider

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160 
people use just straight apple cider

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:41.670 
people use just straight apple cider
vinegar<00:04:36.340> but<00:04:39.120> this<00:04:40.120> works<00:04:40.419> just<00:04:40.720> fine<00:04:40.960> and<00:04:41.320> it

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
vinegar but this works just fine and it

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.150 
vinegar but this works just fine and it
saves<00:04:41.919> money<00:04:43.200> so<00:04:44.200> that's<00:04:44.500> about<00:04:44.680> right<00:04:44.980> it's

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.160 
saves money so that's about right it's

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.310 
saves money so that's about right it's
just<00:04:45.190> below<00:04:45.669> the<00:04:45.880> curvature<00:04:46.419> of<00:04:46.450> our<00:04:46.750> of<00:04:47.080> our

vessel<00:04:49.440> the<00:04:50.440> Apple<00:04:50.860> will<00:04:51.070> float<00:04:51.400> for<00:04:51.730> a<00:04:51.760> couple

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 
vessel the Apple will float for a couple

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.000 
vessel the Apple will float for a couple
of<00:04:52.150> days<00:04:52.330> after<00:04:52.720> that<00:04:53.140> it<00:04:53.260> will<00:04:53.320> sink<00:04:53.620> down<00:04:53.860> to

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.010 
of days after that it will sink down to

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:56.430 
of days after that it will sink down to
the<00:04:54.130> bottom<00:04:54.220> and<00:04:54.810> it<00:04:55.810> will<00:04:55.930> be<00:04:56.050> out<00:04:56.169> of<00:04:56.200> your

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:56.440 
the bottom and it will be out of your

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.330 
the bottom and it will be out of your
way<00:04:56.500> the<00:04:56.770> rest<00:04:56.950> of<00:04:57.130> time<00:04:57.280> you<00:04:57.550> may<00:04:57.700> notice<00:04:58.180> some

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
way the rest of time you may notice some

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.880 
way the rest of time you may notice some
sediment<00:05:00.360> building<00:05:01.360> up<00:05:01.540> inside<00:05:01.840> your<00:05:02.410> culture

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:02.890 
sediment building up inside your culture

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:05.100 
sediment building up inside your culture
over<00:05:03.760> time<00:05:03.940> that's<00:05:04.480> not<00:05:04.720> going<00:05:04.900> to<00:05:04.960> be<00:05:05.080> a

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110 
over time that's not going to be a

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:10.620 
over time that's not going to be a
problem<00:05:05.440> either<00:05:06.990> about<00:05:07.990> every<00:05:09.120> two<00:05:10.120> to<00:05:10.150> maybe

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:10.630 
problem either about every two to maybe

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:12.620 
problem either about every two to maybe
three<00:05:11.020> months<00:05:11.200> you're<00:05:11.620> going<00:05:11.770> to<00:05:11.830> want<00:05:12.040> to

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:12.630 
three months you're going to want to

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:17.190 
three months you're going to want to
refresh<00:05:13.630> your<00:05:13.840> Apple<00:05:14.320> and<00:05:15.960> that's<00:05:16.960> really

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:17.200 
refresh your Apple and that's really

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.880 
refresh your Apple and that's really
about<00:05:17.350> it<00:05:17.710> if<00:05:18.370> you're<00:05:18.910> making<00:05:19.230> subcultures<00:05:20.230> I

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:20.890 
about it if you're making subcultures I

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:23.040 
about it if you're making subcultures I
would<00:05:21.520> suggest<00:05:21.669> you<00:05:22.240> know<00:05:22.360> always<00:05:22.630> keep<00:05:22.840> two

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:23.050 
would suggest you know always keep two

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:25.560 
would suggest you know always keep two
cultures<00:05:23.560> going<00:05:24.010> at<00:05:24.130> at<00:05:24.640> all<00:05:24.700> times<00:05:24.850> just<00:05:25.330> in

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:25.570 
cultures going at at all times just in

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:27.840 
cultures going at at all times just in
case<00:05:25.720> one<00:05:26.020> crashes

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:27.850 
case one crashes

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:30.450 
case one crashes
and<00:05:27.940> if<00:05:28.750> you're<00:05:28.960> going<00:05:29.140> to<00:05:29.230> subculture<00:05:30.100> from

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:30.460 
and if you're going to subculture from

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.240 
and if you're going to subculture from
from<00:05:31.000> a<00:05:31.090> mother<00:05:31.330> culture<00:05:31.810> like<00:05:31.990> this<00:05:32.230> all<00:05:33.040> you

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:33.250 
from a mother culture like this all you

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:34.710 
from a mother culture like this all you
do<00:05:33.490> is<00:05:33.670> just<00:05:33.850> take<00:05:34.060> out<00:05:34.240> a<00:05:34.270> little<00:05:34.450> bit<00:05:34.630> of
