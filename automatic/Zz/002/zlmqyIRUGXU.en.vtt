[Music Track]

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:13.370
[Kiran] When I when to the first lottery, the room was just packed,

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:15.310
and everyone really wanted it so badly,

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:17.460
and you kind of get more excited about it yourself.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.230
And then you pass by the lab when you’re walking in the tunnels sometimes

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:22.740
and peer into it, and it’s really cool to see what’s happening.

00:00:24.198 --> 00:00:26.398
[Erick] I heard about the glass lab before I came here,

00:00:26.398 --> 00:00:28.628
but I hadn’t heard about the forge or the foundry

00:00:28.628 --> 00:00:31.228
until I was looking through the professional seminar programs,

00:00:31.228 --> 00:00:33.478
and I saw the one that was modern blacksmithing.

00:00:33.478 --> 00:00:35.948
It’s something that interested me, not because it’s

00:00:35.948 --> 00:00:37.758
something you can think about in medieval times

00:00:37.758 --> 00:00:39.408
when they made armor, that sounds really awesome,

00:00:39.408 --> 00:00:42.518
but then you also think about the implications that it has nowadays.

00:00:42.518 --> 00:00:43.768
[Music Track]

00:00:43.768 --> 00:00:45.388
[Kiran] I’m studying computer science,

00:00:45.388 --> 00:00:48.508
and these are just so so different from each other,

00:00:48.508 --> 00:00:51.328
because computer science is just about using logic,

00:00:51.328 --> 00:00:53.808
and everything should behave exactly as you tell it to.

00:00:53.808 --> 00:00:57.318
Whereas glass is like; you have to pay attention to what it’s doing,

00:00:57.318 --> 00:00:59.208
and you don’t have control anymore,

00:00:59.208 --> 00:01:02.718
so in one sense, you lose all the ability of control and calculation

00:01:02.718 --> 00:01:05.158
and all of a sudden it becomes much more natural and organic.

00:01:05.158 --> 00:01:07.808
[Neil] Most of my engineering classes are working with machines,

00:01:07.808 --> 00:01:10.408
which is pretty great, but it’s a lot of precision where you’re

00:01:10.448 --> 00:01:12.078
relying on really tight tolerances,

00:01:12.078 --> 00:01:14.348
and you can be very precise in the blacksmithing shop too,

00:01:14.348 --> 00:01:16.898
but it’s a little bit more hands-on in a different way.

00:01:16.898 --> 00:01:18.778
[Andrea] Part of the reason why I enjoy it is not just ‘cause

00:01:18.778 --> 00:01:20.528
I like doing things with my hands,

00:01:20.528 --> 00:01:24.798
but another part is also just that it means that I can sort of

00:01:24.798 --> 00:01:27.768
express that more artsy side without actually being artsy,

00:01:27.768 --> 00:01:29.618
‘cause I know I’m not very artsy.

00:01:30.898 --> 00:01:33.908
[Tara] I mean to be creative, that’s really what we are all here for.

00:01:33.926 --> 00:01:35.632
We all just express it in different ways.

00:01:35.848 --> 00:01:39.086
I think the students yearn to learn,

00:01:39.086 --> 00:01:42.826
and that just gets you so excited to teach.

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:45.608
[Peter] I think the great magic of glass blowing is that it teaches you

00:01:45.608 --> 00:01:49.377
to really read what it's doing.

00:01:49.377 --> 00:01:52.807
and to ride with that, and to think in the moment,

00:01:52.807 --> 00:01:55.417
and to solve problems very much on the fly.

00:01:56.087 --> 00:01:58.977
[Mike] You take this block of metal and melt it,

00:01:58.977 --> 00:02:02.177
and turn it into another solid block of metal in a different shape.

00:02:02.177 --> 00:02:03.787
It’s really kind of,

00:02:03.787 --> 00:02:05.487
even though we know everything that’s going on,

00:02:05.487 --> 00:02:07.507
it’s really magic.

00:02:09.068 --> 00:02:11.918
Heat and mass, transfer and fluid flow

00:02:11.918 --> 00:02:14.638
are things that are, well at least to me as an undergrad,

00:02:14.638 --> 00:02:16.548
they weren’t so obvious,

00:02:16.548 --> 00:02:19.698
But I think when you see it in the foundry or in the forge,

00:02:19.698 --> 00:02:23.298
you see real obvious version of those things,

00:02:23.298 --> 00:02:25.288
so it’s a powerful teaching tool.

00:02:26.165 --> 00:02:27.605
[Peter] MIT is an amazing place,

00:02:27.605 --> 00:02:30.465
with people with all kinds of ideas doing incredible work.

00:02:30.465 --> 00:02:33.615
Our classes are open to everyone at MIT.

00:02:33.615 --> 00:02:36.565
I just think that enriches the experience in a big way,

00:02:36.565 --> 00:02:38.875
when you get people of all ages and different backgrounds

00:02:38.875 --> 00:02:42.265
talking to each other and solving problems together on a bench.

00:02:42.912 --> 00:02:45.072
[Kiran] If you don’t have that kind of tact with it,

00:02:45.072 --> 00:02:48.242
it’s really easy for it to kind of go it's own way,

00:02:48.242 --> 00:02:50.062
and get out of control.

00:02:50.062 --> 00:02:52.192
So it’s a matter of just paying attention,

00:02:52.192 --> 00:02:54.372
and keeping focused.
