00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.780
 subscriptions and captions 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:19.080
 in the same window you can determine the 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:21.630
 information that will appear directly 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.640
 on the screen parts or on the 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.099
 printed cutting plane 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.890
 option buttons allow you to select 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.590
 a single option among those presented in the 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.500
 window but note that some are 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.830
 combine to show more than 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.019
 an example information if you prefer 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:41.160
 the dimensions of the part appeared in another 

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:44.340
 Format 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.219
 just uncheck the check box dimensions 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:51.000
 then the result will be like this 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:53.910
 in this image you see enlarged our 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.829
 example now in its version for 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.660
 print 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:00.739
 note that the program only left the 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:04.259
 dimensions hiding the other inscriptions 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:06.619
 description part code and 

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:09.720
 project because there is not enough room 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:10.830
 and avoid congestion 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.160
 information 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:17.640
 information has been replaced by the 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:20.580
 reference h that will be used to locate 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.600
 the part in the subtitle list below the 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.479
 cutting plan 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.600
 it is worth noting that the other part of the image 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.770
 here is now g-reference because it is a 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.110
 little bigger 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:36.840
 entries with the codes of the 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:39.150
 and part of the project but there is no description of the 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.479
 caption list of the cutting plane press 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:45.090
 begins by giving a new column number 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:48.180
 still for each set of equal parts 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.939
 that are positioned in the 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.520
 shown independently of the 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.329
 code that these parts already have 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.030
 Wish 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:02:00.060
 the flaps may also receive a 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.520
 description to differentiate them from 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.329
 choose between the sequences offered 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.329
 in the same window
