00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 lightness of the steering wheel is an item that can 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.270
 make a difference when it comes to choosing a 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:09.030
 car the driver of a separate with two 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.469
 power steering or 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.690
 electric direction 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.849
 it is important to know the characteristics of 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:20.340
 each one to define what will be the most 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:23.760
 useful when going to the moon time to buy 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:27.029
 the car and now electric director or 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.580
 power steering and there is one thing 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.920
 has changed with the advancement of 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.290
 doubt was the facility to turn the 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.230
 steering wheel and it all started when 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.870
 designers developed the direction 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.750
 has seen in the past that the mechanical 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.160
 denied the power steering 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.780
 today the general direction for migration 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:51.180
 much weaker in the 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.000
 reality with the power steering was 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.199
 much lighter but the new revolution is the 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.690
 electric generation 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.359
 no hydraulic system is just 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.590
 a much lighter engine and much more 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.949
 simple 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.770
 everything happens in this pump a system that 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.110
 inject could in the steering box closing 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.869
 the lightest steering wheel for the system 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.509
 work perfectly is necessary 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.330
 maintenance and replacement of the 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:21.390
 fluid that is in this reservoir a 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:24.600
 efficient system ensures with the body 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.630
 driving but nothing that compares to 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.450
 electronic system 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.250
 is not only an electronic exchange that 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.579
 through the battery 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:37.250
 it is triggered by turning it more or 

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:40.070
 less than 50 percent lighter than the 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:42.829
 hydraulically and progressively to 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:45.890
 maintenance of the electronic system is 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:48.439
 plus its operation consume less 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.069
 computers coupled to the 

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:51.920
 steering wheel 

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:53.270
 You do not follow an engine that helps in 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.179
 steering wheel composition 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.280
 the system is intelligent as you 

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:59.750
 increases speed makes steering 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.970
 firmer 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:05.119
 if the car is reading or stopped the 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:07.250
 steering wheel may have moved your finger 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:09.649
 some cars as is the case with bravo 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.900
 account of the progressive system of 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.209
 electronic steering with a device that 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.849
 can be triggered by the driver 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:19.940
 so that whoever drives can choose between 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:21.860
 a lighter direction an aggression by 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.079
 a little firmer and helps the driver 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.319
 to control the vehicle 

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:29.150
 in the case of high speed the panel 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:30.470
 indicates whether the panty is in the 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.130
 to town 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:36.470
 lighter the normal a little heavier 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.000
 the advantages of electronic steering can 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.390
 be felt by the driver 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.910
 especially when it comes to maneuvering 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.220
 so there is no doubt the direction 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.709
 offers more advantages than 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.350
 driver than the power steering in 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:52.430
 golden two martini has a lot of life 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.049
 from the driver 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.930
 imagine the customer are leading 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:58.130
 vehicle with 50 percent lighter than the 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.359
 that join the plant that the vehicle has 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.280
 five years per hour 

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:04.400
 becomes dangerous then it goes 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.350
 become progressive so that it becomes 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.910
 more firmly 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.910
 according to their position
