the gamepad

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:34.930 
the gamepad
and<00:07:33.169> it<00:07:33.800> doesn't<00:07:34.039> actually<00:07:34.160> say<00:07:34.370> what<00:07:34.639> game<00:07:34.819> it

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:34.940

and it doesn't actually say what game it
is<00:07:35.090> right<00:07:35.660> here<00:07:35.870> which<00:07:35.990> is<00:07:36.080> kind<00:07:36.259> of<00:07:36.289> odd<00:07:36.440> but

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:36.830 
is right here which is kind of odd but

II<00:07:37.039> for<00:07:37.340> everyone<00:07:37.669> I<00:07:37.699> have<00:07:38.030> to<00:07:38.150> assume<00:07:38.330> that

00:07:38.439 --> 00:07:38.449 
II for everyone I have to assume that

00:07:38.449 --> 00:07:40.779 
II for everyone I have to assume that
Zelda<00:07:38.810> or<00:07:38.930> Pikmin<00:07:39.350> actually<00:07:39.680> could<00:07:40.580> be<00:07:40.610> either

00:07:40.779 --> 00:07:40.789 
Zelda or Pikmin actually could be either

00:07:40.789 --> 00:07:43.659 
Zelda or Pikmin actually could be either
one<00:07:41.000> and<00:07:41.389> yep<00:07:42.319> here<00:07:42.620> we<00:07:42.710> go<00:07:42.830> it<00:07:43.009> is<00:07:43.130> Zelda<00:07:43.520> and

00:07:43.659 --> 00:07:43.669 
one and yep here we go it is Zelda and

00:07:43.669 --> 00:07:46.120 
one and yep here we go it is Zelda and
it's<00:07:43.819> about<00:07:43.910> one<00:07:44.090> and<00:07:44.180> a<00:07:44.240> half<00:07:44.270> gigs<00:07:44.860> just<00:07:45.860> fine

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:46.130 
it's about one and a half gigs just fine

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:47.620 
it's about one and a half gigs just fine
because<00:07:46.340> I've<00:07:46.520> only<00:07:46.669> ever<00:07:46.759> downloads<00:07:47.240> smaller

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:47.630 
because I've only ever downloads smaller

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:49.120
