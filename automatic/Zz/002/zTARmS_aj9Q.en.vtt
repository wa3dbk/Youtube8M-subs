00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
this was a different one because it's a

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.410 
this was a different one because it's a
big<00:02:10.410> book<00:02:10.649> and<00:02:10.830> when<00:02:11.190> you<00:02:11.310> adapt<00:02:11.819> that<00:02:12.120> there

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
big book and when you adapt that there

big book and when you adapt that there
are<00:02:12.510> certain<00:02:12.840> ideas<00:02:13.349> that<00:02:13.980> I<00:02:14.010> felt<00:02:14.459> I<00:02:14.640> could

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
are certain ideas that I felt I could

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.150 
are certain ideas that I felt I could
not<00:02:15.060> translate<00:02:15.540> to<00:02:15.720> film<00:02:16.110> and<00:02:16.410> so<00:02:16.650> I<00:02:16.680> had<00:02:16.980> to

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
not translate to film and so I had to

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.760 
not translate to film and so I had to
focus<00:02:17.670> on<00:02:18.030> what<00:02:18.239> would<00:02:18.510> really<00:02:18.810> move<00:02:19.470> the

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
focus on what would really move the

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.460 
focus on what would really move the
story<00:02:20.069> along<00:02:20.220> in<00:02:20.760> a<00:02:21.120> film<00:02:21.540> and<00:02:21.810> for<00:02:22.020> me<00:02:22.170> it<00:02:22.319> was

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
story along in a film and for me it was

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.199 
story along in a film and for me it was
the<00:02:22.590> love<00:02:22.770> story<00:02:23.040> between<00:02:23.310> now<00:02:23.940> and<00:02:23.970> my
