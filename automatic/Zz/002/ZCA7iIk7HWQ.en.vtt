00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.380
 all 6,000 hectares of maize 90 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:50.330
 percent of hybrids syngenta company 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:53.820
 We really liked the hybrid falcon 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:56.400
 old hybrid but reliable proven 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:02.670
 In fact, last year, these hybrids you 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:05.210
 gave us a yield of up to 150 150 cm with 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.210
 hector 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:17.750
 Over the past years we have been active 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.550
 We cooperate with the client company in a number of 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.110
 directions 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:26.140
 speaking of corn I would like 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:28.060
 note that 9 thousand hectares of area 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.250
 almost completely 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:33.380
 used cement company hybrids 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.100
 hybrids are not only high 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.750
 yield potential but also high 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.910
 ductility stability that is this 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:45.740
 potential can be realized in 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:47.690
 different conditions and not even always 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.240
 favorably the second distinctive 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.440
 I would point out that in 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.440
 ruler and brad come in 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:58.910
 hybrids of all groups of ripeness 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:03.159
 starting from Fau 180 and ending with 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:06.060
 for our zone of 260 that is 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:10.019
 we have the opportunity to pick up 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:12.819
 almost any hybrids that 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:15.519
 especially early maturing 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:17.799
 for our like but a little north 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:22.420
 zones corn blue third feature i 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:24.160
 would call it hybrids resistance 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.819
 singent corn company 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.950
 borer damage we 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:35.150
 each preserve yields thanks to 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:38.060
 that the breeder students are working on 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.519
 these indicators also have them 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.680
 characterize hybrids 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:44.870
 good good cottage that has 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.769
 certain economic benefits 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.769
 and when cleaning 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:58.170
 we are on the field and where is cleaning 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.829
 silage corn harvest, 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:03.450
 pre is about 400 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:07.680
 director that is cob already waxy 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:09.239
 the ripeness of the cob is done by the whole 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:14.030
 we are satisfied and of course 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:14.030
 and collaboration firm singenta 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.879
 Our company is engaged in growing 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:24.900
 corn over five years in the area 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:27.640
 about 5 thousand hectares for a long time we 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.709
 picked up hybrids experienced various 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.769
 manufacturers present their 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:36.280
 we chose the singing company 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:40.299
 over 95 percent of our crops are sown 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:44.469
 these leading hybrids are leading hybrids 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:48.879
 this is a top falcon sharing game we are 

00:03:44.469 --> 00:03:52.260
 on the field 200 hectares of hybris falcon pool 

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:57.340
 this May, the seeding rate is 91000 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:04:01.719
 cleaning we have about 88 89 thousand 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:03.849
 hectare plants protected from weeds 

00:04:01.719 --> 00:04:07.239
 syngent's company drugs 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:09.459
 milagros callisto about how they work 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:12.909
 you can look at our frequency 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:17.280
 crop spacing with 90 centners 90 92 

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:20.680
 here and wet 28 how would we be satisfied 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:24.780
 the future is naturally our choice 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.780
 leave on the syngenta hybrid 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:38.810
 the end of the field season is coming 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:41.360
 corn harvest this year we consider 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.320
 good 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:47.940
 average 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:50.639
 expect that he will be with us more than 80 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:53.520
 grain centers from 90 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:55.610
 bunker us things and 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:58.560
 about seventy-five centers 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:02.100
 directors in test down and hybrids 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:05.270
 singent companies have shown themselves 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:09.440
 this year as in previous years 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:09.440
 fairly stable and good
