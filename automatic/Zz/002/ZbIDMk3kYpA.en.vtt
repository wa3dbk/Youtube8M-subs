00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.440 
go for if I'm like you know not wanting

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.400

to<00:01:39.740> spend<00:01:40.100> the<00:01:40.730> bigger<00:01:40.970> bucks<00:01:41.330> on<00:01:41.750> another

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:42.410 
to spend the bigger bucks on another

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:44.620 
to spend the bigger bucks on another
conditioner<00:01:43.280> and<00:01:43.670> it's<00:01:43.880> cheap<00:01:44.360> and<00:01:44.510> it's

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
conditioner and it's cheap and it's

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.900 
conditioner and it's cheap and it's
natural<00:01:45.470> and<00:01:45.680> what's<00:01:46.280> not<00:01:46.430> to<00:01:46.580> love<00:01:46.700> about<00:01:46.730> it

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:46.910

but it's intensely amazing and the

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:30.610 
but it's intensely amazing and the
consistency<00:04:29.000> of<00:04:29.390> it<00:04:29.570> is<00:04:29.720> a<00:04:29.750> little<00:04:29.930> bit<00:04:30.140> weird

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620

I think it feels like a little bit like

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.890 
I think it feels like a little bit like
marshmallow<00:04:34.220> fluff<00:04:34.490> it's<00:04:35.270> a<00:04:35.390> little<00:04:35.630> bit<00:04:35.750> like

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
marshmallow fluff it's a little bit like

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.220 
marshmallow fluff it's a little bit like
sticky<00:04:36.800> and<00:04:37.040> like<00:04:37.280> a<00:04:37.640> last<00:04:38.210> sticky<00:04:38.720> it's<00:04:38.870> kind

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:39.230 
sticky and like a last sticky it's kind

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:41.530 
sticky and like a last sticky it's kind
of<00:04:39.260> bizarre<00:04:39.410> and<00:04:39.920> combed<00:04:40.220> it<00:04:40.400> through<00:04:40.700> like<00:04:41.420> I

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:41.540 
of bizarre and combed it through like I

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.930 
of bizarre and combed it through like I
would<00:04:41.780> just<00:04:41.990> a<00:04:42.110> normal<00:04:42.470> conditioner<00:04:43.220> and<00:04:43.790> it

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
would just a normal conditioner and it

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:45.730 
would just a normal conditioner and it
had<00:04:44.090> a<00:04:44.120> really<00:04:44.360> good<00:04:44.600> slip<00:04:44.930> to<00:04:45.200> it<00:04:45.350> and<00:04:45.500> it

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740 
had a really good slip to it and it

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.220 
had a really good slip to it and it
detangles<00:04:46.340> pretty<00:04:46.640> easily<00:04:46.880> I<00:04:47.420> think<00:04:47.870> it<00:04:47.990> works

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:48.230 
detangles pretty easily I think it works

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:50.710 
detangles pretty easily I think it works
regardless<00:04:48.920> of<00:04:49.400> how<00:04:49.550> long<00:04:49.820> you<00:04:49.970> use<00:04:50.150> leave<00:04:50.570> it

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:50.720 
regardless of how long you use leave it

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.100 
regardless of how long you use leave it
in<00:04:50.870> um<00:04:51.610> obviously<00:04:52.610> the<00:04:53.030> longer<00:04:53.150> is<00:04:53.420> better<00:04:53.450> but

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110 
in um obviously the longer is better but

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.320
