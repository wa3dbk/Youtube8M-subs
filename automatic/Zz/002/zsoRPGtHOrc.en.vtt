00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:19.990
 No, but this is too much of a refusal . 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:24.740
 patton of mine 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:29.420
 a little seriously i wo n't no how much 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:37.940
 dresses la two buckets little two buckets for 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:42.489
 three will be many but three will be right 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:45.589
 work our today's hero is 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:48.979
 truly legend many speak of him 

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:51.470
 but many have never seen him and 

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:54.320
 I hope they never see that 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:56.570
 the truth is that it is for me 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.089
 for my team once such 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.100
 pretenders and come across if in 

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:03.530
 previous videos of this category 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.799
 some viewers have questions about 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.420
 about the advisability of installing at all 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:11.720
 this or that gun such as 107 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:14.060
 millimeters per sq-2 then in this case I 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.700
 I can't imagine what the reaction will be 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.650
 public but your took 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.440
 the commentators won 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:24.260
 commentators under each video of this 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.590
 rubrics wrote then we will build 105 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.700
 millimeters and not that which is top 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.650
 absolutely not even many not 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.380
 guess what you have such 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:35.660
 great opportunity to set up 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.510
 i'm so bent over on level five true 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:42.980
 guns on tank 9 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:45.800
 Yes, I will remind you a gun M4 howitzer M4 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:49.070
 put and put still on the tank 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:52.070
 m4 sherman there before the nerf 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:55.670
 cumulative she vomited everything 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:58.100
 now getting into the top sherman there too 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.840
 something can with this gun but getting 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.790
 already against the sixes there is quite 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.909
 serious problems so that at all 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.860
 inflict full damage cumulative and now 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:10.340
 imagine that you are with this 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:13.250
 come across against t-62a versus e100 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.470
 against of 4 that is, in the normal level 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.870
 fighting tank level 9 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.939
 aware of all this you will need to know 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.290
 only three characteristics of their 

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:23.450
 guns to 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.150
 understand where did you get 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:29.299
 the very first is your alpha with a mine 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.519
 always keep in mind what the damage is with 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:34.250
 your landmine only 20 units 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:36.680
 I mean within the margin of error more than 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:40.519
 grandmothers top guns on the same tank 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:42.349
 cumulatives have less than 350 second 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:44.060
 Parameter armor penetration one hundred and four 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:48.109
 a millimeter in my opinion is quite small 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:51.319
 at the ninth level to 100 4 millimeter 

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:53.090
 This means that the leopard-1 you 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:54.799
 will have to target to lower armor plates and 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.989
 it is not a fact that you pierce it because 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:03:00.049
 that he can still put the rum battsat 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:03.319
 upper armor can not break through the tank 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:05.510
 lion you will pierce one of the 20 times if 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:09.079
 cumulative shoot ie gold and 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:11.120
 about land mines 64 millimeters armor penetration 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:12.470
 I think the bottom is also not worth talking 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.439
 and by the way 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.549
 artillery objects 61st cumulative in 

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:18.319
 do not pierce your forehead 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:19.849
 the last parameter you need 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:21.590
 It will always keep in mind is 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:23.629
 your projectile speed 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.849
 the numbers will not speak just say what 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:28.040
 she disgusting shoot at tanks 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:30.530
 which is in motion you are not 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:33.290
 be able to physical if he is not 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.000
 be closer than 100 meters to 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.519
 more than 100 meters you are almost certain 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.829
 don't get well and of course how 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:42.470
 a consequence of this whole wafercentre 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:44.389
 now become your favorite 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:46.609
 opponents who generally can you 

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:49.000
 meet insofar as your 

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:51.620
 good will definitely be higher than them 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.370
 considering even those crits that you give them 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.799
 will cause 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:56.690
 why am I telling you all this ask 

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:58.729
 you so far as 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.799
 it's pretty obvious patton 

00:03:58.729 --> 00:04:02.599
 fugasnita is probably the concentration 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:04.459
 the absurd which in general can in principle 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:08.720
 meet in the game world of tanks 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:09.500
 but I will tell you that this tank is very 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.359
 philosophical 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.549
 that is, it should not be considered as 

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:16.639
 combat unit its worth considering 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:18.470
 as an object of philosophy I will explain more 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:21.889
 Imagine in detail that you are all very 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.280
 bad in life well very bad in life 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:24.070
 you 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:27.910
 you are fully on credit 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:30.730
 you have a broken car you have an apartment 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:32.830
 repaired but there is nothing but at the same time 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:35.860
 you have some kind of antediluvian computer 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.790
 which at 5 frames per second starts 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.130
 world of tanks 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:41.230
 you go there you are pumping 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:43.900
 American development branch to the ninth 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:47.830
 level and put the folders with the fuseas I 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:50.620
 I assure you played here 5 fights on this 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:53.860
 tank you will understand that in fact everything 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:56.770
 not so bad really there 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:59.560
 things are even worse than the ones in which 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:02.770
 turned out and you so far as 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:06.220
 the world there is a folder with fugashnits why 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:08.530
 did this gun give me this tank 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:10.330
 I could not find an explanation 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:13.360
 the assumption that it is made in tribute 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:16.180
 supposedly based on tank m46 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:19.240
 done engineering machine yes it's true 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:21.670
 here are just a few guns there 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:24.880
 another caliber was not there 105 

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:27.610
 and if memory serves me 165 and this 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:29.830
 already completely changes the picture because 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:32.320
 I will remind you eagdpanzer e100 which 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.700
 caliber 5 millimeters less explosive 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.340
 shoots a1400 

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:38.920
 so imagine what would happen if 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:41.950
 would something like that be 

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:45.070
 installed on m46 another problem i 

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:45.760
 I think that the gun 105 millimeters m4 

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:47.470
 howitzer 

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:52.270
 can only be installed in the top tower 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:55.120
 and the top tower is already from the tank M47 she 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:57.910
 m47 and nothing seems to be 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:00.910
 this was not put there was like 

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:02.740
 something else turns out like some 

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:06.100
 historical reinforcements at 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:09.310
 least I would not find I do not know give 

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:12.430
 opportunity to put this here on 

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:14.410
 this tank but pretty strange that 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:17.380
 what about the average Urala which I got 

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:21.280
 let's keep the gun for the fifth 

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:23.080
 level indicator not bad 1180 if 

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:24.760
 this could be tuned to 

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:27.700
 the fifth level it could be boldly 

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:30.550
 say that the indicator is good well, really 

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:32.830
 on the ninth this is too small although I will give you 

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:35.520
 honest i tell i've met quite 

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:37.919
 often players who are on the tank of 8 hold 

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:40.919
 or even less what conclusion from this 

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:43.830
 Let's just not so easy to bring it 

00:06:40.919 --> 00:06:46.259
 his life before comparing it with 

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:50.330
 this tank in this configuration 

00:06:46.259 --> 00:06:54.180
 and if you just do nothing just 

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:56.280
 no need for this tank just need 

00:06:54.180 --> 00:07:00.060
 put such a gun about the letter as 

00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:02.520
 Normal good target tank level 9 with 

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:05.659
 with your pros and cons with you was a cop 

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:05.659
 maniac all good luck and bye
