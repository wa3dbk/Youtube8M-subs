about 30 to 32 inches and at that point

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.920 
about 30 to 32 inches and at that point
most<00:00:59.400> people<00:00:59.730> would<00:00:59.850> consider<00:01:00.210> it<00:01:00.390> a<00:01:00.450> trophy

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
brings a lot of people to muskie fishing

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.730 
brings a lot of people to muskie fishing
they're<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:23.520> solitary<00:01:24.240> fish<00:01:24.600> you<00:01:25.320> don't<00:01:25.499> see<00:01:25.710> a

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
they're a solitary fish you don't see a

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:26.959 
they're a solitary fish you don't see a
lot<00:01:26.009> of<00:01:26.039> them<00:01:26.249> they're<00:01:26.429> typically<00:01:26.820> aren't

00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:26.969 
lot of them they're typically aren't

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:29.270 
lot of them they're typically aren't
very<00:01:27.179> high<00:01:27.390> densities<00:01:27.990> anywhere<00:01:28.469> and<00:01:28.740> so<00:01:29.219> you

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
very high densities anywhere and so you

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.340 
very high densities anywhere and so you
might<00:01:29.520> fish<00:01:29.819> all<00:01:30.060> day<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:30.539> only<00:01:30.719> see<00:01:30.990> one<00:01:31.200> or

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
might fish all day and only see one or

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.459 
might fish all day and only see one or
two<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.799> if<00:01:31.979> you're<00:01:32.189> lucky<00:01:32.369> catch<00:01:32.819> one<00:01:33.289> so<00:01:34.289> the

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:34.469 
two and if you're lucky catch one so the

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:36.770 
two and if you're lucky catch one so the

catch although it's hardly a really big
one<00:03:02.640> this<00:03:02.970> one<00:03:03.180> is<00:03:03.210> about<00:03:03.600> oh<00:03:04.580> about<00:03:05.580> 30<00:03:05.940> inches

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
one this one is about oh about 30 inches

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.980 
one this one is about oh about 30 inches
long<00:03:06.600> and<00:03:07.550> not<00:03:08.550> happy<00:03:09.060> to<00:03:09.240> have<00:03:09.450> me<00:03:09.600> holding

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:09.990 
long and not happy to have me holding

him<00:03:10.140> or<00:03:10.380> her<00:03:11.220> this<00:03:12.090> is<00:03:12.360> now<00:03:12.540> they're<00:03:12.750> just<00:03:13.020> a

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
him or her this is now they're just a

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.530 
him or her this is now they're just a
little<00:03:13.470> bit<00:03:13.590> under<00:03:13.970> maturity<00:03:14.970> at<00:03:15.090> this<00:03:15.300> point

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
little bit under maturity at this point

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.270 
little bit under maturity at this point
so<00:03:15.690> this<00:03:15.810> this<00:03:16.170> fish<00:03:16.350> is<00:03:16.500> probably<00:03:16.800> not<00:03:16.950> quite

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
so this this fish is probably not quite

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.450 
so this this fish is probably not quite
an<00:03:17.460> adult<00:03:17.760> and<00:03:18.290> it's<00:03:19.290> probably<00:03:19.560> about<00:03:19.740> 4<00:03:20.310> or<00:03:20.340> 5

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:20.460 
an adult and it's probably about 4 or 5

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:23.330 
an adult and it's probably about 4 or 5
years<00:03:21.150> old<00:03:21.390> at<00:03:21.780> this<00:03:22.380> point<00:03:22.680> it's<00:03:22.890> really

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
years old at this point it's really

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.340 
years old at this point it's really
becoming<00:03:23.670> the<00:03:23.910> top<00:03:24.120> predator<00:03:24.660> in<00:03:24.690> the<00:03:24.930> system

becoming the top predator in the system

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.230 
becoming the top predator in the system
it's<00:03:25.530> the<00:03:25.710> fish<00:03:25.890> that<00:03:26.100> everybody<00:03:26.520> all<00:03:26.970> the

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:27.240 
it's the fish that everybody all the

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.850 
it's the fish that everybody all the
other<00:03:27.390> fish<00:03:27.660> in<00:03:27.690> here<00:03:28.020> are<00:03:28.110> fearing<00:03:28.440> because

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
other fish in here are fearing because

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
nice trophy muskie certainly not as big

nice trophy muskie certainly not as big
as<00:03:52.200> they<00:03:52.380> get<00:03:52.620> but<00:03:53.040> a<00:03:53.070> nice<00:03:53.310> one<00:03:53.550> nonetheless

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.590 

this<00:03:57.000> muskie<00:03:57.510> is<00:03:57.720> about<00:03:57.990> 44<00:03:58.620> inches<00:03:59.010> long<00:03:59.280> and

00:03:59.590 --> 00:03:59.600 
this muskie is about 44 inches long and

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:04.280 
this muskie is about 44 inches long and
it<00:04:00.600> is<00:04:00.660> a<00:04:01.760> probably<00:04:02.760> about<00:04:02.880> 20<00:04:03.540> pounds<00:04:03.750> maybe<00:04:04.170> a

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
it is a probably about 20 pounds maybe a

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.980 
it is a probably about 20 pounds maybe a
little<00:04:04.470> bit<00:04:04.680> less<00:04:04.890> and<00:04:05.209> so<00:04:06.209> by<00:04:06.450> most<00:04:06.660> people's

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:06.990 
little bit less and so by most people's

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:08.690 
little bit less and so by most people's
standards<00:04:07.050> this<00:04:07.620> would<00:04:07.800> be<00:04:07.920> a<00:04:07.950> nice<00:04:08.190> muskie

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
standards this would be a nice muskie

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.940 
standards this would be a nice muskie
but<00:04:09.390> it's<00:04:09.540> not<00:04:09.720> anywhere<00:04:10.110> near<00:04:10.170> the<00:04:10.380> record

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
but it's not anywhere near the record

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.560 
but it's not anywhere near the record
which<00:04:11.130> is<00:04:11.280> actually<00:04:11.640> from<00:04:11.820> Wisconsin<00:04:12.480> the

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
which is actually from Wisconsin the

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.090 
which is actually from Wisconsin the
world-record<00:04:12.930> muskie<00:04:13.500> is<00:04:13.560> a<00:04:13.620> little<00:04:13.950> bit

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
world-record muskie is a little bit

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.240 
world-record muskie is a little bit
under<00:04:14.400> 70<00:04:14.940> pounds<00:04:15.450> and<00:04:15.540> probably<00:04:16.350> close<00:04:16.590> to<00:04:16.799> 60

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
under 70 pounds and probably close to 60

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.580 
under 70 pounds and probably close to 60
inches<00:04:17.549> long<00:04:17.820> so<00:04:18.510> this<00:04:18.750> fish<00:04:19.020> would<00:04:19.260> have<00:04:19.320> to

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
inches long so this fish would have to

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.530 
inches long so this fish would have to
more<00:04:19.980> than<00:04:20.130> double<00:04:20.190> in<00:04:20.609> size<00:04:20.820> to<00:04:21.180> become<00:04:21.330> a

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:21.540 
more than double in size to become a

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.900 
more than double in size to become a
record<00:04:21.810> but<00:04:22.680> nonetheless<00:04:22.860> this<00:04:23.400> is<00:04:23.460> a<00:04:23.640> nice

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
record but nonetheless this is a nice

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:25.700 
record but nonetheless this is a nice
muskie<00:04:24.419> and<00:04:24.540> this<00:04:24.690> is<00:04:24.840> the<00:04:24.960> trophy<00:04:25.380> this<00:04:25.530> is

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
muskie and this is the trophy this is

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.260 
muskie and this is the trophy this is
the<00:04:25.800> kind<00:04:26.040> of<00:04:26.130> fish<00:04:26.310> that<00:04:26.340> people<00:04:26.880> will<00:04:27.000> drive

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
the kind of fish that people will drive

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:28.040 
the kind of fish that people will drive
from<00:04:27.570> all<00:04:27.720> over<00:04:27.750> the
