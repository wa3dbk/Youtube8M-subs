00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:03.649 
hello everybody and today's video I'll
be<00:00:02.250> showing<00:00:02.550> you<00:00:02.730> how<00:00:02.760> to<00:00:02.909> make<00:00:03.090> this<00:00:03.270> trellis

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
be showing you how to make this trellis

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:06.170 
be showing you how to make this trellis
for<00:00:04.049> around<00:00:04.200> 40<00:00:04.859> all<00:00:05.220> these<00:00:05.430> free<00:00:05.640> palettes

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
for around 40 all these free palettes

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.720 
for around 40 all these free palettes
came<00:00:06.750> from<00:00:06.990> my<00:00:07.140> next-door<00:00:07.470> neighbor<00:00:07.589> he<00:00:08.550> got

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
came from my next-door neighbor he got

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.549 
came from my next-door neighbor he got
them<00:00:08.910> from<00:00:08.940> work<00:00:09.300> and<00:00:09.599> he<00:00:09.960> said<00:00:10.200> I<00:00:10.230> could

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
them from work and he said I could

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.950 
them from work and he said I could
pretty<00:00:10.980> much<00:00:11.090> do<00:00:12.090> whatever<00:00:12.330> I<00:00:12.509> wanted<00:00:12.780> with

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
pretty much do whatever I wanted with

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.470 
pretty much do whatever I wanted with
them<00:00:13.110> and<00:00:13.620> I<00:00:14.040> immediately<00:00:14.429> thought<00:00:14.849> of<00:00:14.910> three

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
them and I immediately thought of three

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.970 
them and I immediately thought of three
or<00:00:15.540> four<00:00:15.690> projects<00:00:16.139> and<00:00:16.410> this<00:00:16.590> is<00:00:16.710> going<00:00:16.830> to<00:00:16.890> be

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
or four projects and this is going to be

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.760 
or four projects and this is going to be
one<00:00:17.130> of<00:00:17.220> them<00:00:17.340> I<00:00:17.550> will<00:00:18.330> be<00:00:18.570> building<00:00:19.170> a<00:00:19.380> trellis

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
one of them I will be building a trellis

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.790 
one of them I will be building a trellis
and<00:00:20.630> there's<00:00:21.630> three<00:00:22.020> advantages<00:00:22.500> of<00:00:22.560> these

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
and there's three advantages of these

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.240 
and there's three advantages of these
palettes<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:24.150> first<00:00:24.390> one<00:00:24.630> is<00:00:24.810> that<00:00:25.250> they're

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
palettes the first one is that they're

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.910 
palettes the first one is that they're
free<00:00:26.550> that's<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.150> best<00:00:27.359> of<00:00:27.449> all<00:00:27.769> second<00:00:28.769> one

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
free that's the best of all second one

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.410 
free that's the best of all second one
is<00:00:29.099> that<00:00:29.369> they're<00:00:29.490> put<00:00:29.609> together<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.939> staples

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
is that they're put together the staples

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.830 
is that they're put together the staples
super<00:00:31.380> easy<00:00:31.529> to<00:00:31.830> take<00:00:32.130> apart<00:00:32.489> and<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:33.660> third

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
super easy to take apart and the third

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.260 
super easy to take apart and the third
one<00:00:34.050> is<00:00:34.260> all<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:35.070> crossmembers<00:00:35.880> are<00:00:36.090> pretty

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
one is all the crossmembers are pretty

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.959 
one is all the crossmembers are pretty
much<00:00:36.420> cut<00:00:36.719> to<00:00:36.930> size<00:00:37.170> that<00:00:37.410> I<00:00:37.500> want<00:00:37.770> so<00:00:38.489> I<00:00:38.520> don't

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
much cut to size that I want so I don't

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.819 
much cut to size that I want so I don't
even<00:00:39.300> need<00:00:39.570> to<00:00:39.629> do<00:00:40.079> any<00:00:40.260> ripping<00:00:40.590> with<00:00:40.710> my

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
even need to do any ripping with my

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.799 
even need to do any ripping with my
table<00:00:41.040> saw<00:00:41.340> at<00:00:41.460> all<00:00:41.550> so<00:00:42.149> let's<00:00:42.180> go<00:00:42.420> ahead<00:00:42.510> and

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
table saw at all so let's go ahead and

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.569 
table saw at all so let's go ahead and
start<00:00:42.989> turning<00:00:43.230> these<00:00:43.440> apart<00:00:43.770> okay<00:00:44.370> as<00:00:44.489> I

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
start turning these apart okay as I

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:45.709 
start turning these apart okay as I
previously<00:00:44.789> mentioned<00:00:45.030> these<00:00:45.420> are<00:00:45.570> put

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
previously mentioned these are put

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.020 
previously mentioned these are put
together<00:00:45.809> with<00:00:46.140> staples<00:00:46.410> I'm<00:00:46.980> so<00:00:47.579> glad<00:00:47.789> they

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
together with staples I'm so glad they

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.510 
together with staples I'm so glad they
are<00:00:48.059> if<00:00:48.780> these<00:00:49.020> were<00:00:49.260> normal<00:00:49.710> pallets<00:00:50.160> they

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
are if these were normal pallets they

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.479 
are if these were normal pallets they
put<00:00:50.789> together<00:00:50.910> with<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:51.960> nails<00:00:52.379> you<00:00:53.280> pretty

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
you save a lot of the wood so with a

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.010 
you save a lot of the wood so with a
plain<00:00:58.530> pry<00:00:58.829> bar<00:00:59.449> go<00:01:00.449> ahead<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:00.750> get

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
okay so I've constructed one leg and I'm

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.789 
okay so I've constructed one leg and I'm
getting<00:01:45.540> ready<00:01:45.689> to<00:01:45.750> construct<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.439> other<00:01:46.560> leg

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
getting ready to construct the other leg

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.300 
getting ready to construct the other leg
of<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:46.979> trellis<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:48.020> these<00:01:49.020> planks<00:01:49.320> are<00:01:49.590> 70

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
of the trellis and these planks are 70

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.840 
of the trellis and these planks are 70
inches<00:01:50.790> long<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.680> very<00:01:52.680> thick<00:01:53.009> and<00:01:53.670> I

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
inches long and very thick and I

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.480 
inches long and very thick and I
actually<00:01:54.000> want<00:01:54.390> them<00:01:55.020> to<00:01:55.290> be<00:01:55.409> 89<00:01:55.890> inches<00:01:56.219> so

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
actually want them to be 89 inches so

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.280 
actually want them to be 89 inches so
I'm<00:01:56.640> doing<00:01:56.880> a<00:01:57.530> layer

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
I'm doing a layer

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:05.320 
I'm doing a layer
I<00:02:00.320> have<00:02:01.240> this<00:02:02.240> one<00:02:02.480> is<00:02:02.660> 7<00:02:03.110> inches<00:02:03.970> this<00:02:04.970> one<00:02:05.210> in

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.330 
I have this one is 7 inches this one in

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.690 
I have this one is 7 inches this one in
the<00:02:05.420> middle<00:02:05.690> here<00:02:06.010> which<00:02:07.010> you<00:02:07.220> can<00:02:07.370> see<00:02:07.580> on

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
the middle here which you can see on

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.680 
the middle here which you can see on
this<00:02:07.850> one<00:02:08.180> is<00:02:08.740> extending<00:02:09.740> outward<00:02:10.360> which<00:02:11.360> this

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
this one is extending outward which this

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.740 
this one is extending outward which this
one<00:02:11.960> does<00:02:12.200> and<00:02:12.410> then<00:02:13.010> you<00:02:13.100> go<00:02:13.250> ahead<00:02:13.370> and<00:02:13.760> place

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
one does and then you go ahead and place

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.590 
one does and then you go ahead and place
that<00:02:14.780> back<00:02:15.020> on<00:02:15.350> top<00:02:15.910> and<00:02:16.910> I'm<00:02:17.060> using<00:02:17.210> my<00:02:17.300> brad

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
that back on top and I'm using my brad

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.170 
that back on top and I'm using my brad
nailer<00:02:17.900> on<00:02:18.140> this<00:02:18.350> one<00:02:18.560> and<00:02:18.800> with<00:02:19.700> these<00:02:19.910> three

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
nailer on this one and with these three

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.150 
nailer on this one and with these three
together<00:02:20.330> this<00:02:20.720> should<00:02:20.960> be<00:02:21.080> stronger<00:02:21.650> and<00:02:21.830> I

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
together this should be stronger and I

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.550 
together this should be stronger and I
get<00:02:22.340> my<00:02:22.490> desired<00:02:22.880> length<00:02:23.210> of<00:02:23.480> 89<00:02:24.170> inch<00:02:24.320> so<00:02:24.500> I

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
get my desired length of 89 inch so I

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.190 
get my desired length of 89 inch so I

went ahead and put the two legs together

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.600 
went ahead and put the two legs together
and<00:02:27.560> they<00:02:28.460> are<00:02:29.050> 89<00:02:30.050> inches<00:02:30.350> long<00:02:30.590> by<00:02:31.010> one<00:02:31.310> and<00:02:31.550> a

that<00:04:24.240> across<00:04:24.540> so<00:04:25.410> that<00:04:25.440> is<00:04:25.680> going<00:04:25.830> to

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
that across so that is going to

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:28.130 
that across so that is going to
eliminate<00:04:26.310> all<00:04:26.520> of<00:04:26.880> these<00:04:27.060> turn<00:04:27.780> out<00:04:27.930> on<00:04:27.960> the

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:28.140 
eliminate all of these turn out on the

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:30.500 
eliminate all of these turn out on the
back<00:04:28.400> and<00:04:29.400> it's<00:04:29.580> going<00:04:29.700> to<00:04:29.760> give<00:04:29.880> it<00:04:29.910> a<00:04:30.120> nice<00:04:30.270> so

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
back and it's going to give it a nice so

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.110 
back and it's going to give it a nice so
here's<00:04:30.750> the<00:04:30.990> finished<00:04:31.470> trellis<00:04:31.919> and<00:04:32.160> I<00:04:32.880> think

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 
here's the finished trellis and I think

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.480 
here's the finished trellis and I think
in<00:04:33.270> cost<00:04:33.510> I<00:04:33.750> have<00:04:33.900> about<00:04:34.110> four<00:04:34.500> dollars<00:04:34.800> with

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
in cost I have about four dollars with

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:39.020 
in cost I have about four dollars with
the<00:04:35.640> bread<00:04:35.850> nails<00:04:36.150> and<00:04:36.890> I'm<00:04:37.890> also<00:04:38.070> going<00:04:38.340> to<00:04:38.460> go

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
the bread nails and I'm also going to go

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.480 
the bread nails and I'm also going to go
ahead<00:04:39.120> and<00:04:39.419> stain<00:04:40.320> it<00:04:40.350> and<00:04:40.650> polyurethane<00:04:41.130> it

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
ahead and stain it and polyurethane it

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:42.620 
ahead and stain it and polyurethane it
because<00:04:41.730> it's<00:04:41.940> what<00:04:42.360> is<00:04:42.480> not

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
because it's what is not

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.720 
because it's what is not
pressure-treated<00:04:43.200> so<00:04:44.100> it<00:04:44.220> will<00:04:44.370> start<00:04:44.610> the

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:44.730 
pressure-treated so it will start the

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:47.150 
pressure-treated so it will start the
rod<00:04:44.910> after<00:04:45.270> a<00:04:45.300> while<00:04:45.480> and<00:04:45.780> if<00:04:46.680> you<00:04:46.830> don't<00:04:47.010> want

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 
rod after a while and if you don't want

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.770 
rod after a while and if you don't want
to<00:04:47.220> do<00:04:47.280> that<00:04:47.400> I<00:04:47.460> would<00:04:47.730> suggest<00:04:47.970> painting<00:04:48.630> it

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
to do that I would suggest painting it

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.750 
to do that I would suggest painting it
because<00:04:49.500> it's<00:04:49.650> definitely<00:04:49.800> going<00:04:50.130> to<00:04:50.190> not

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:50.760 
because it's definitely going to not

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.250 
because it's definitely going to not
hold<00:04:50.940> up<00:04:51.060> to<00:04:51.180> the<00:04:51.270> weather<00:04:51.300> for<00:04:51.630> very<00:04:51.810> long

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:52.260 
hold up to the weather for very long

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:53.690 
hold up to the weather for very long
