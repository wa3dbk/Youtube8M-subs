00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
for a long time but it was more than a

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.760 
for a long time but it was more than a
lake<00:00:44.820> with<00:00:45.000> some<00:00:45.210> trout<00:00:45.539> in<00:00:45.780> that<00:00:46.110> Mike<00:00:46.350> wanted

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
lake with some trout in that Mike wanted

lake with some trout in that Mike wanted
to<00:00:46.920> create<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.910> private<00:00:48.390> setting<00:00:48.750> that<00:00:48.870> it<00:00:48.989> is

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
to create the private setting that it is

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.170 
to create the private setting that it is
it's<00:00:49.440> surrounded<00:00:50.010> by<00:00:50.010> National<00:00:50.610> Forest<00:00:50.969> on

it's surrounded by National Forest on
three<00:00:51.480> sides<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:52.440> so<00:00:52.890> it's<00:00:53.070> very<00:00:53.879> unique<00:00:54.510> in

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
three sides and so it's very unique in

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.959 
three sides and so it's very unique in
that<00:00:54.989> it's<00:00:55.289> basically<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.250> only<00:00:56.340> noise<00:00:56.579> you

the<00:01:40.409> tie<00:01:40.590> that<00:01:40.770> binds<00:01:41.070> I<00:01:41.720> always<00:01:42.720> i<00:01:42.840> think<00:01:43.079> it's

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
the tie that binds I always i think it's

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.660 
the tie that binds I always i think it's
just<00:01:43.380> something<00:01:43.710> you<00:01:43.740> were<00:01:44.159> brought<00:01:44.399> up<00:01:44.460> with

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
just something you were brought up with

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.730 
just something you were brought up with
and<00:01:45.210> it<00:01:45.329> just<00:01:45.540> kind<00:01:45.720> of<00:01:45.780> continues<00:01:46.290> on<00:01:46.500> I<00:01:46.680> know

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
and it just kind of continues on I know

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.520 
and it just kind of continues on I know
my<00:01:46.979> fall<00:01:47.460> much<00:01:47.700> my<00:01:48.060> kids<00:01:48.360> are<00:01:48.570> avid<00:01:49.049> fishermen
