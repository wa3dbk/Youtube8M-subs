 daughter 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:47.160
 it is not strange that harry fled from here to 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.490
 that if something were happening in the 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:53.930

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:56.420

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:15.500
 Harry loves chocolates goodbye 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:17.209
 there is swelling the wine to speak this 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.209
 They may seem sweet but in fact it is 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:21.950
 a marriage help I will have to 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:24.830
 hide these chocolates where if not 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:27.739

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:34.150
 child knows all my hiding places the 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:34.150
 kitchen where mamacita chocolates are kept 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:39.990
 and there they would last 5 minutes maybe in the 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.370
 room 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:44.970
