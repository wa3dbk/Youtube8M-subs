00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
watch another feature of this watch is

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.780 
watch another feature of this watch is
the<00:01:09.210> GMT<00:01:09.570> function<00:01:10.380> for<00:01:11.369> those<00:01:11.520> who<00:01:11.729> are

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
the GMT function for those who are

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.730 
the GMT function for those who are
unfamiliar<00:01:12.299> with<00:01:12.420> GMT<00:01:13.110> it<00:01:13.470> simply<00:01:14.400> means<00:01:14.670> that

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
unfamiliar with GMT it simply means that

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.580 
unfamiliar with GMT it simply means that
you<00:01:16.740> can<00:01:17.009> carry<00:01:17.400> another<00:01:18.119> time<00:01:18.570> zone<00:01:18.600> on<00:01:19.259> your

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
you can carry another time zone on your

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.100 
you can carry another time zone on your
watch<00:01:19.890> so<00:01:20.820> instead<00:01:21.180> of<00:01:21.270> just<00:01:21.509> displaying

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
watch so instead of just displaying

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.550 
watch so instead of just displaying
one<00:01:22.470> time<00:01:23.100> it<00:01:23.340> carries<00:01:23.790> two<00:01:24.150> now<00:01:25.140> in<00:01:25.320> most

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
one time it carries two now in most

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.850 
one time it carries two now in most
instances<00:01:26.189> when<00:01:26.670> you're<00:01:26.880> using<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.330> GMT<00:01:27.860> you

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
instances when you're using the GMT you

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.910 
instances when you're using the GMT you
would<00:01:29.040> you<00:01:29.610> gonna<00:01:29.790> use<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.540> second<00:01:31.049> GMT<00:01:31.619> hand

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
would you gonna use the second GMT hand

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.410 
would you gonna use the second GMT hand
as<00:01:32.159> you<00:01:32.280> can<00:01:32.430> see<00:01:32.640> over<00:01:32.759> here<00:01:32.909> with<00:01:33.299> the

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
as you can see over here with the

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.980 
as you can see over here with the
diamond<00:01:33.780> tip<00:01:33.960> and<00:01:34.409> that<00:01:35.310> hand<00:01:35.880> is<00:01:36.210> going<00:01:36.750> to

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
diamond tip and that hand is going to

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.800 
diamond tip and that hand is going to
show<00:01:37.259> you<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.979> hours<00:01:38.640> in<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.000> second<00:01:39.450> time

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
show you the hours in the second time

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.069 
show you the hours in the second time
zone<00:01:39.840> as<00:01:40.770> I<00:01:41.729> mentioned<00:01:42.150> before<00:01:42.240> this<00:01:42.780> watch

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
zone as I mentioned before this watch

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.460 
zone as I mentioned before this watch
also<00:01:43.829> offers<00:01:44.310> date<00:01:44.670> now<00:01:45.180> just<00:01:45.899> so<00:01:46.079> that<00:01:46.259> if

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
also offers date now just so that if

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.340 
also offers date now just so that if
people<00:01:47.009> might<00:01:47.399> be<00:01:47.520> confused<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.720> date<00:01:49.079> will

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
people might be confused the date will

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.460 
people might be confused the date will
follow<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:50.520> main<00:01:50.820> time<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:51.450> not<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.930> second

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
follow the main time and not the second

follow the main time and not the second
dual<00:01:52.740> time<00:01:53.600> now<00:01:54.600> let's<00:01:54.930> take<00:01:55.079> a<00:01:55.110> look<00:01:55.380> at<00:01:55.439> the

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
dual time now let's take a look at the

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.410 
dual time now let's take a look at the
power<00:01:55.680> reserve<00:01:56.070> indicator<00:01:56.299> towards<00:01:57.299> the

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
power reserve indicator towards the

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.560 
power reserve indicator towards the
12:00<00:01:57.799> now<00:01:58.799> it<00:01:58.950> just<00:01:59.100> says<00:01:59.250> you<00:01:59.280> know<00:01:59.610> orange

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
12:00 now it just says you know orange

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:01.940 
12:00 now it just says you know orange
is<00:02:00.689> very<00:02:00.960> well<00:02:01.200> known<00:02:01.229> for<00:02:01.680> their<00:02:01.740> power

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
is very well known for their power

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.859 
is very well known for their power
reserve<00:02:02.399> indicators<00:02:03.119> especially<00:02:03.630> at<00:02:03.719> this

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
reserve indicators especially at this

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.160 
reserve indicators especially at this
price<00:02:04.049> point<00:02:04.469> so<00:02:04.909> one<00:02:05.909> a<00:02:06.210> couple<00:02:06.930> other<00:02:07.110> things

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
price point so one a couple other things

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.809 
price point so one a couple other things
that<00:02:07.560> you<00:02:07.649> might<00:02:07.829> want<00:02:08.099> to<00:02:08.190> know<00:02:08.340> about<00:02:08.520> this

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
that you might want to know about this

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:09.800 
that you might want to know about this
movement<00:02:09.090> is<00:02:09.479> that

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
movement is that

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
movement is that
number<00:02:10.410> one<00:02:10.649> it<00:02:10.890> is<00:02:11.400> hackable<00:02:12.530> which<00:02:13.530> means

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
number one it is hackable which means

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.150 
number one it is hackable which means
that<00:02:14.190> you<00:02:14.880> can<00:02:15.030> sink<00:02:15.360> your<00:02:15.420> watch<00:02:15.810> much<00:02:16.740> easier

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
that you can sink your watch much easier

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.360 
that you can sink your watch much easier
this<00:02:17.340> way<00:02:17.610> and<00:02:17.940> number<00:02:18.720> two<00:02:19.130> they<00:02:20.130> also

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
this way and number two they also

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.320 
this way and number two they also
provide<00:02:21.330> a<00:02:21.630> hand<00:02:22.410> wine<00:02:22.890> double<00:02:23.250> feature<00:02:23.490> where

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
provide a hand wine double feature where

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.260 
provide a hand wine double feature where
you<00:02:24.480> can<00:02:24.750> turn<00:02:25.200> the<00:02:25.440> crown<00:02:25.800> and<00:02:26.160> it's<00:02:26.730> going<00:02:27.060> to
