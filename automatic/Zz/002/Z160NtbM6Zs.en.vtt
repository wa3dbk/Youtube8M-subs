Allah called sukoon I like circles then
I<00:00:30.480> still<00:00:30.689> very<00:00:31.650> simple<00:00:32.129> and<00:00:32.640> I'll<00:00:32.820> just<00:00:33.059> drag

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
I still very simple and I'll just drag

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.889 
I still very simple and I'll just drag
it<00:00:33.540> and<00:00:33.690> bring<00:00:34.199> it<00:00:34.230> to<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.530> stage

00:00:37.889 --> 00:00:37.899 

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:41.040 

I'll<00:00:38.469> create<00:00:38.860> a<00:00:38.949> new<00:00:39.039> layer<00:00:39.300> call<00:00:40.300> it<00:00:40.449> actions

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.050 
I'll create a new layer call it actions

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.380 
I'll create a new layer call it actions
you<00:00:41.800> don't<00:00:42.010> have<00:00:42.129> to<00:00:42.280> call<00:00:42.460> it<00:00:42.579> actions<00:00:43.000> you

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:43.390 
you don't have to call it actions you

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:44.759 
you don't have to call it actions you
can<00:00:43.510> call<00:00:43.719> it<00:00:43.840> whatever<00:00:43.989> you<00:00:44.290> want

00:00:44.759 --> 00:00:44.769 
can call it whatever you want

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:47.009 
can call it whatever you want
call<00:00:45.190> it<00:00:45.340> actions<00:00:45.910> is<00:00:46.210> just<00:00:46.420> a<00:00:46.570> standard

00:00:47.009 --> 00:00:47.019 
call it actions is just a standard

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:49.380 
call it actions is just a standard
method<00:00:47.199> that<00:00:47.500> most<00:00:47.680> people<00:00:48.070> use<00:00:48.100> and<00:00:48.790> I'll

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 
method that most people use and I'll

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:55.550 
method that most people use and I'll
call<00:00:49.660> this<00:00:49.899> layer<00:00:50.260> circled

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.280 

I'm<00:00:55.950> gonna<00:00:56.160> go<00:00:56.430> to<00:00:56.490> the<00:00:56.700> actions<00:00:57.240> layer<00:00:57.540> and<00:00:57.570> go

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:58.290 
I'm gonna go to the actions layer and go

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.130 
I'm gonna go to the actions layer and go
to<00:00:58.350> window<00:00:58.680> actions<00:00:59.420> we're<00:01:00.420> gonna<00:01:00.690> write<00:01:00.930> some

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
to window actions we're gonna write some

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.230 
to window actions we're gonna write some
variables<00:01:02.720> bar<00:01:03.720> T<00:01:04.559> that<00:01:04.800> is<00:01:04.949> pressed<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.760> it's

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
variables bar T that is pressed and it's

a positive integers bar right T is dong

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.140 
a positive integers bar right T is dong
which<00:01:10.350> is<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.530> wholly-owned<00:01:11.100> and<00:01:11.729> I'll<00:01:11.850> set<00:01:12.119> it

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
which is a wholly-owned and I'll set it

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.230 
which is a wholly-owned and I'll set it

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:17.070 
variable can jump which will be a
boolean<00:06:15.250> and<00:06:15.640> it'll<00:06:16.240> tell<00:06:16.510> whether<00:06:16.840> the

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:17.080 
boolean and it'll tell whether the

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.890 
boolean and it'll tell whether the
circle<00:06:17.470> can<00:06:17.710> jump<00:06:18.130> or<00:06:18.340> not<00:06:18.580> I'll<00:06:19.360> set<00:06:19.750> it<00:06:19.780> to

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:19.900 
circle can jump or not I'll set it to

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:23.800 
circle can jump or not I'll set it to
false

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:23.810 

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:27.550 

now<00:06:24.500> I'll<00:06:24.710> scroll<00:06:25.100> down<00:06:25.160> to<00:06:25.790> the<00:06:26.560> mystical

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:27.560 
now I'll scroll down to the mystical

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:31.030 
now I'll scroll down to the mystical
function<00:06:28.130> and<00:06:28.790> initial<00:06:29.600> the<00:06:30.080> lefty<00:06:30.620> is<00:06:30.740> done

function and initial the lefty is done

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.470 
function and initial the lefty is done
conditional<00:06:31.670> statement

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:32.480 
conditional statement

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:37.270 
conditional statement
we'll<00:06:33.020> try<00:06:33.320> if<00:06:34.280> a<00:06:34.670> key<00:06:34.970> is<00:06:35.000> done<00:06:35.420> and<00:06:35.780> and<00:06:36.530> can

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:37.280 
we'll try if a key is done and and can

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:41.500 
we'll try if a key is done and and can
jump<00:06:37.780> meaning<00:06:38.780> if<00:06:39.650> the<00:06:40.070> is<00:06:40.340> done<00:06:40.700> and<00:06:41.300> the

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:41.510 
jump meaning if the is done and the

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:44.350 
jump meaning if the is done and the
circle<00:06:41.930> can<00:06:42.200> jump<00:06:42.590> because<00:06:43.280> well<00:06:43.520> you<00:06:44.090> can't

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:44.360 
circle can jump because well you can't

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:46.840 
circle can jump because well you can't
jump<00:06:44.660> if<00:06:44.840> you're<00:06:44.990> already<00:06:45.230> in<00:06:45.440> the<00:06:45.560> air<00:06:45.860> if<00:06:46.580> you

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:46.850 
jump if you're already in the air if you

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:49.540 
jump if you're already in the air if you
can't<00:06:47.180> even<00:06:47.930> visit<00:06:48.080> me<00:06:48.380> because<00:06:49.010> I'd<00:06:49.160> love<00:06:49.490> to

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:49.550 
can't even visit me because I'd love to

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:54.220 
can't even visit me because I'd love to
know<00:06:49.850> you<00:06:49.910> do<00:06:50.240> it<00:06:50.770> anyway<00:06:51.820> if<00:06:52.820> so<00:06:53.150> and<00:06:53.270> so<00:06:53.570> then

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:54.230 
know you do it anyway if so and so then

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:59.760 
know you do it anyway if so and so then
why<00:06:54.440> velocity<00:06:55.450> equals<00:06:56.450> minus<00:06:57.140> 15<00:06:57.590> and<00:06:58.270> now

00:06:59.760 --> 00:06:59.770 
why velocity equals minus 15 and now

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:04.530 
why velocity equals minus 15 and now
Gangjeong<00:07:00.830> becomes<00:07:01.340> false

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:04.540 

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:07.800 

now<00:07:05.170> I'm<00:07:05.380> gonna<00:07:05.620> go<00:07:05.920> down<00:07:06.130> and<00:07:06.310> type<00:07:06.810> Y

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:07.810 
now I'm gonna go down and type Y

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:11.310 
now I'm gonna go down and type Y
porosity<00:07:08.320> plus<00:07:09.250> equals<00:07:09.820> gravity<00:07:10.690> so

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:11.320 
porosity plus equals gravity so

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:13.770 
porosity plus equals gravity so
basically<00:07:11.740> the<00:07:12.370> Y<00:07:12.520> velocity<00:07:12.580> is<00:07:13.210> increasing

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:13.780 
basically the Y velocity is increasing

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:16.380 
basically the Y velocity is increasing
by<00:07:13.930> gravity<00:07:14.380> every<00:07:14.710> three<00:07:14.980> so<00:07:15.760> the<00:07:15.940> circle<00:07:16.300> is

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:16.390 
by gravity every three so the circle is

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:18.690 
by gravity every three so the circle is
gonna<00:07:16.600> fall<00:07:16.870> faster<00:07:17.380> and<00:07:17.530> faster<00:07:17.710> I'm<00:07:18.670> going

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:18.700 
gonna fall faster and faster I'm going

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:21.030 
gonna fall faster and faster I'm going
to<00:07:19.060> collapse<00:07:19.360> the<00:07:19.600> actions<00:07:20.050> final<00:07:20.440> once<00:07:20.680> again

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:21.040 
to collapse the actions final once again

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:24.570 
to collapse the actions final once again
and<00:07:21.310> select<00:07:21.670> the<00:07:21.820> rectangle<00:07:22.360> tool
