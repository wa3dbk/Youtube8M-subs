Zephyr
to<00:01:24.300> where<00:01:25.100> we<00:01:26.100> start<00:01:26.460> so<00:01:27.120> it<00:01:27.570> should<00:01:27.780> be<00:01:27.900> like

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:28.440 
to where we start so it should be like

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.210 
to where we start so it should be like
that<00:01:28.730> it's<00:01:29.730> kind<00:01:29.940> of<00:01:29.970> like<00:01:30.120> a<00:01:30.180> Darwin<00:01:31.070> kind<00:01:32.070> of

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:48.150 
around this around train and then you

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:55.330 
around this around train and then you
make<00:01:48.300> another<00:01:48.330> one<00:01:49.940> off<00:01:50.940> the<00:01:51.360> edge<00:01:53.780> like<00:01:54.780> that

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
make another one off the edge like that

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.340 
make another one off the edge like that
and<00:01:56.340> maybe<00:01:57.000> you<00:01:57.240> want<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:57.600> make<00:01:57.720> this<00:01:57.869> one<00:01:58.140> a

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:35.670 
and you also want to make those f2 and

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:45.890 
and you also want to make those f2 and
then<00:04:36.670> you<00:04:36.790> color<00:04:37.000> those<00:04:37.240> in<00:04:42.720> like<00:04:43.720> that<00:04:43.900> and

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
then you color those in like that and

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.540 
then you color those in like that and
this<00:04:46.900> actually<00:04:47.140> takes<00:04:47.530> a<00:04:47.650> long<00:04:47.860> time<00:04:47.890> but<00:04:48.400> it's

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
this actually takes a long time but it's

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.260 
this actually takes a long time but it's
pretty<00:04:48.880> easy<00:04:49.360> steps<00:04:50.230> and<00:04:50.970> then<00:04:51.970> you<00:04:52.090> make

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
pretty easy steps and then you make

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:55.020 
pretty easy steps and then you make
another<00:04:52.390> one<00:04:52.840> on<00:04:53.050> the<00:04:53.140> other<00:04:53.620> side<00:04:54.220> and<00:04:54.910> make

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030 
another one on the other side and make

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:59.220 
another one on the other side and make
this<00:04:55.210> one<00:04:55.450> a<00:04:55.480> little<00:04:55.600> bit<00:04:55.840> from<00:04:55.990> bigger<00:04:58.230> and

00:04:59.220 --> 00:04:59.230 
this one a little bit from bigger and

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:17.559 
this one a little bit from bigger and
this<00:04:59.800> one<00:05:00.070> over<00:05:00.280> there

00:05:17.559 --> 00:05:17.569 

00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:27.920 

and<00:05:18.569> there<00:05:18.749> to<00:05:19.020> be<00:05:19.169> equal

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:33.890 

so<00:05:28.440> it's<00:05:28.590> going<00:05:28.710> to<00:05:28.770> be<00:05:28.830> like<00:05:29.370> that<00:05:30.650> ok<00:05:31.850> now<00:05:32.900> you

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:33.900 
so it's going to be like that ok now you

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:40.460 
so it's going to be like that ok now you
race<00:05:34.259> a<00:05:34.289> little<00:05:34.770> bit<00:05:34.919> of<00:05:35.100> this<00:05:35.280> side<00:05:35.580> a<00:05:39.470> little

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:40.470 
race a little bit of this side a little

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:48.909 
race a little bit of this side a little
piece<00:05:40.710> of<00:05:40.860> that<00:05:41.600> and<00:05:42.600> you<00:05:42.720> draw<00:05:43.310> like<00:05:44.310> around

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:48.919 

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:55.399 

looking<00:05:49.919> fish<00:05:51.680> shape

00:05:55.399 --> 00:05:55.409 

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:58.200 

okay<00:05:56.409> and<00:05:57.009> so<00:05:57.250> you<00:05:57.340> might<00:05:57.639> want<00:05:57.849> to<00:05:57.879> make<00:05:58.030> that

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:58.210 
okay and so you might want to make that

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:16.610 
okay and so you might want to make that
ending<00:05:58.750> more<00:06:00.720> point<00:06:01.720> here

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:16.620 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:19.040 

okay<00:06:17.430> so<00:06:17.729> it's<00:06:17.850> going<00:06:17.970> to<00:06:18.030> be<00:06:18.090> like<00:06:18.270> on<00:06:18.510> and

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:19.050 
okay so it's going to be like on and

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:21.680 
okay so it's going to be like on and
you're<00:06:19.470> going<00:06:19.590> to<00:06:19.650> put<00:06:19.889> another<00:06:20.690> little

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:21.690 
you're going to put another little

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:25.730 
you're going to put another little
circle<00:06:22.320> my<00:06:22.800> knees<00:06:24.020> and<00:06:25.020> so<00:06:25.470> you're<00:06:25.650> probably

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:25.740 
circle my knees and so you're probably

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:28.909 
circle my knees and so you're probably
thinking<00:06:26.070> that<00:06:26.250> looks<00:06:26.820> like<00:06:26.970> the<00:06:27.180> nose<00:06:27.919> and

00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:28.919 
thinking that looks like the nose and

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:34.969 
thinking that looks like the nose and
actually<00:06:29.280> I<00:06:29.610> don't<00:06:29.910> know<00:06:30.120> what<00:06:30.449> that<00:06:30.479> is<00:06:31.760> ok<00:06:33.979> so

00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:34.979 
actually I don't know what that is ok so

00:06:34.979 --> 00:06:47.580 
actually I don't know what that is ok so
now<00:06:36.740> you<00:06:37.740> draw<00:06:38.130> the<00:06:38.190> whiskers

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:47.590 

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:51.600 

and<00:06:47.740> this<00:06:48.400> side<00:06:48.880> has<00:06:49.210> to<00:06:49.780> be<00:06:50.680> a<00:06:50.710> good<00:06:50.980> job<00:06:51.340> three

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:51.610 
and this side has to be a good job three

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:55.260 
and this side has to be a good job three
if<00:06:52.000> you<00:06:52.150> want<00:06:52.770> which<00:06:53.770> I'm<00:06:53.980> going<00:06:54.160> to<00:06:54.220> do<00:06:54.370> okay

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:55.270 
if you want which I'm going to do okay

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:57.630 
if you want which I'm going to do okay
so<00:06:55.660> it<00:06:56.140> should<00:06:56.410> look<00:06:56.560> like<00:06:56.620> that<00:06:56.980> and<00:06:57.280> that<00:06:57.430> is

00:06:57.630 --> 00:06:57.640 
so it should look like that and that is

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:05.250 
so it should look like that and that is
the<00:06:57.670> head<00:07:03.150> it<00:07:04.150> looks<00:07:04.390> much<00:07:04.660> better<00:07:04.840> when<00:07:05.170> you

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:05.260 
the head it looks much better when you
