00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 why that you have so much trouble with this 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.250
 HBS from a high 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.620
 chasing you just start very well 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.960
 to the competition and we get 3 big ones 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.580
 chances including me two 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.610
 good if you make it into one 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.139
 know it a lot easier and 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.640
 out of the blue above their die 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.380
 shoot them right in and then it goes 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.539
 such teams believe two 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.160
 they just go in bags and they have 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.109
 two fast guys for in so it is 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.810
 also pay more attention to the counter 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.660
 yes and broad you are apparently going 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.859
 keep going and throw the boss down and yes 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.380
 it just does it for a long time that he 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.540
 a one falls and yes well 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.090
 luckily he still falls 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.450
 yes then the second the extension say 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.649
 gets looked up faster and faster 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.230
 and then you go here with ten men yes 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.239
 Sustainable you notice their everything they do 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.379
 went for those penalties and they were 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.789
 also dangerous with corners and free 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.710
 Stairs on the side and they have 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:56.070
 of course a lot of length and we we 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.270
 less heavy with a heavy on me 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.399
 We think that we do not panic 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.920
 its use it just rest 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.120
 have remained and in the end is good 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.680
 come 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.780
 the first extension of that also had to 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.479
 otherwise played less with a man 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.590
 because how you get injured and then you can 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.150
 it changed three times when the 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.520
 political penalty series 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:18.060
 was your work yes luckily dear 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.229
 I don't do it 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.939
 to the it means you grant it 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.350
 must go play against trying already 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.750
 that so only against amateur club 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.400
 don't you expect that but yes i got there 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.670
 a certain theory about it and he 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.680
 fortunately this is often the truth 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.900
 and where is your theory yes then I go 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.570
 separate us with ye not reveal 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:40.200
 all day you escape in the nick of time 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.990
 a wanvertoning yes indeed I 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.850
 think it wasn't right 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.200
 of course he also has indeed 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.030
 the cup for making has nothing to do 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.590
 lose here and we have everything 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.270
 actually lose if I get around it 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.590
 listening I also heard the word 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.429
 boom 'display 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:58.770
 cases is that right now I know 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:02.069
 people do n't look natural 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.930
 even now a week in which the 

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:06.690
 trainer is fired 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.429
 and I think they will take that too and 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.179
 of course many interviews located and 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.370
 weather 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.960
 financial setbacks people take that 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.940
 and have a lot in Frisian college 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.260
 from other people so take that 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.740
 supporters too 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.650
 I then 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:23.950
 then you will soon be dissatisfied and that 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:26.320
 but about the game that is certainly because of me 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.790
 think we are the first to have it 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.100
 reasonably done in the na no more yes 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.390
 then then bottom also dissatisfied 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.160
 to be 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:36.300
 And again they are just as happy as them 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.300
 as our way through
