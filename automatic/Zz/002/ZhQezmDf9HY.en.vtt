00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:15.980
 in the room 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.670
 it's about when time stays 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.500
 inside the shower when you bathe myself 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.420
 I have three shower routines I have a 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.930
 Quick routine of three minutes when 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.910
 I'm leaving late I have a routine 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:35.730
 standard 10 minutes and I have the routine 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.070
 25-minute luxury 25 because not 30 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.970
 because it does not take me more than 25 washes me 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.970
 the hair twice 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:49.040
 and well can you sing a song if 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:51.110
 in three days you and you are not alone 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:54.379
 clear soap is that the water does not speak well 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.879
 he listens to you nothing else accompanies you is a 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:58.159
 Accompaniment then you can not 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:00.170
 judge water simply dry water 

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:01.250
 and chained more cowardly dripping and after 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.140
 praise for example the hair with 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.680
 antimatter 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.680
 and now 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:13.049
 although sometimes my brother does little more 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:15.240
 of half an hour is to say for example that 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.810
 bathe faster to save a 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.810
 little water 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:27.090
 when time passes a shower 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.090
 that is 25 minutes ago 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:32.320
 the more it goes up in showering sales 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.300
 because he needs time to talk the 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.230
 hair and everything and we had thought about 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.180
 make movements so that suddenly 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.820
 so that the water bill comes a little 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:42.260
 less 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:45.330
 not what happens that does not mean that 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:47.960
 modify my bathroom routine that makes a 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.610
 Half an hour in the shower 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.930
 it bathes pressure survey about 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.930
 we fight from taken charter 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.080
 and I'm not in a hurry then an hour and a half 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.080
 half 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.799
 good 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.119
 when we think because I hope that you 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:10.360
 go very well your next half hour of 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.360
 shower
