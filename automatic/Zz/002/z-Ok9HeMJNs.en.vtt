Buick<00:01:10.020> hubcap<00:01:10.590> on<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:11.010> back<00:01:11.479> I'm<00:01:12.479> going<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.720> go

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
Buick hubcap on the back I'm going to go

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.380 
Buick hubcap on the back I'm going to go
real<00:01:13.080> quick<00:01:13.350> over<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.310> build<00:01:14.790> differences

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
real quick over the build differences

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.810 
real quick over the build differences
with<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.350> catback<00:01:16.890> there

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
with the catback there

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.940 
with the catback there
Samwise<00:01:18.509> it's<00:01:19.189> more<00:01:20.189> focused<00:01:20.400> sounding<00:01:21.000> and

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
Samwise it's more focused sounding and

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.190 
Samwise it's more focused sounding and
we<00:01:22.950> had<00:01:23.100> some<00:01:23.310> serious<00:01:23.549> directional<00:01:24.509> sound

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
we had some serious directional sound

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.830 
we had some serious directional sound
off<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.710> back<00:01:25.920> when<00:01:26.220> it<00:01:26.310> was<00:01:26.400> open<00:01:26.820> and<00:01:27.000> the

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
off the back when it was open and the

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.440 
off the back when it was open and the
cap<00:01:28.200> really<00:01:28.590> helped<00:01:29.130> keep<00:01:29.939> that<00:01:30.210> in<00:01:30.420> check

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
cap really helped keep that in check

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.319 
cap really helped keep that in check
which<00:01:30.990> is<00:01:31.170> for<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.100> most<00:01:32.220> part<00:01:32.340> good<00:01:32.670> it's<00:01:33.270> a

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
which is for the most part good it's a

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.770 
which is for the most part good it's a
little<00:01:34.110> bit<00:01:34.290> tenure<00:01:34.740> sounding<00:01:35.189> which<00:01:35.340> is

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
little bit tenure sounding which is

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.469 
little bit tenure sounding which is
different<00:01:36.780> I<00:01:37.500> think<00:01:37.950> more<00:01:38.640> good<00:01:38.820> than<00:01:38.970> not<00:01:39.180> but

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
different I think more good than not but

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.859 
different I think more good than not but
it<00:01:39.630> it's<00:01:40.380> all<00:01:40.500> it's<00:01:40.890> all<00:01:41.509> personal<00:01:42.509> preference

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
it it's all it's all personal preference

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.940 
it it's all it's all personal preference
and<00:01:43.380> what<00:01:43.880> else<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:45.060> mention<00:01:45.450> um<00:01:45.950> that's

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
and what else to mention um that's

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.880 
and what else to mention um that's
pretty<00:01:47.159> much<00:01:47.340> it<00:01:47.640> it's<00:01:48.000> oh<00:01:48.720> it's<00:01:49.439> also<00:01:49.619> more

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
pretty much it it's oh it's also more

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.370 
pretty much it it's oh it's also more
comfortable<00:01:50.100> because<00:01:50.490> it<00:01:50.670> isn't<00:01:51.200> cut<00:01:52.200> my

from<00:02:37.050> a<00:02:38.050> hardware<00:02:38.680> store<00:02:39.090> and<00:02:40.090> it<00:02:40.300> is<00:02:41.170> working

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
from a hardware store and it is working

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.890 
from a hardware store and it is working
pretty<00:02:41.680> well<00:02:41.940> it<00:02:42.940> is<00:02:43.150> attached<00:02:43.600> from<00:02:43.810> the

so<00:03:19.720> there's<00:03:20.079> your<00:03:20.230> look<00:03:20.380> at<00:03:20.560> the<00:03:20.590> base<00:03:20.860> banjo

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
so there's your look at the base banjo

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.759 
so there's your look at the base banjo
we'll<00:03:21.730> call<00:03:21.940> this<00:03:22.090> one<00:03:22.360> version<00:03:23.910> 0.9<00:03:24.910> and<00:03:25.769> it's

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
we'll call this one version 0.9 and it's

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:36.569 
we'll call this one version 0.9 and it's
working<00:03:27.430> really<00:03:27.670> really<00:03:27.850> well<00:03:34.950> and<00:03:35.950> towards

working really really well and towards

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:49.110 
working really really well and towards
the<00:03:36.670> bridge<00:03:46.799> so<00:03:47.799> it's<00:03:47.829> definitely<00:03:48.730> a<00:03:48.790> basic

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
the bridge so it's definitely a basic

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.900 
the bridge so it's definitely a basic
definitely<00:03:49.450> banjo<00:03:50.220> for<00:03:51.220> more<00:03:51.400> information<00:03:51.850> on

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
definitely banjo for more information on

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:52.830 
definitely banjo for more information on
how<00:03:52.180> I<00:03:52.209> built<00:03:52.480> it

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
how I built it

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.000 
how I built it
and<00:03:53.519> the<00:03:54.519> equipment<00:03:55.000> costs<00:03:55.570> all<00:03:55.810> that<00:03:56.260> go<00:03:56.829> look

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
and the equipment costs all that go look

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.160 
and the equipment costs all that go look
at<00:03:57.100> the<00:03:57.220> video<00:03:57.579> link<00:03:57.850> below<00:03:58.000> where<00:03:58.510> I<00:03:58.630> outline

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
at the video link below where I outline

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.680 
at the video link below where I outline
the<00:03:59.200> building<00:03:59.859> the<00:04:00.209> instrument<00:04:01.209> before<00:04:01.329> put

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
the building the instrument before put

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:03.960 
the building the instrument before put
the<00:04:01.780> hub<00:04:01.930> cap<00:04:02.140> on<00:04:02.350> the<00:04:02.470> back<00:04:02.680> like<00:04:03.640> I<00:04:03.670> said<00:04:03.880> the

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
the hub cap on the back like I said the

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.449 
the hub cap on the back like I said the
hub<00:04:04.120> cap<00:04:04.390> just<00:04:04.630> added<00:04:05.049> the<00:04:05.170> cost<00:04:05.410> of<00:04:05.739> some

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.459 
hub cap just added the cost of some

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:10.830 
hub cap just added the cost of some
washers<00:04:07.000> and<00:04:07.859> some<00:04:08.859> bolts<00:04:09.340> and<00:04:09.549> the<00:04:10.420> hub<00:04:10.570> cap

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
washers and some bolts and the hub cap

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.349 
washers and some bolts and the hub cap
so<00:04:11.109> it<00:04:11.200> was<00:04:11.350> a<00:04:11.380> fairly<00:04:12.010> inexpensive<00:04:12.400> edition

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:13.359 
so it was a fairly inexpensive edition

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:15.420 
so it was a fairly inexpensive edition
