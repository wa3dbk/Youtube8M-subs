through as she can get up to quite a
high<00:01:35.190> speed<00:01:35.700> so<00:01:36.630> that's<00:01:36.960> what<00:01:37.229> I<00:01:37.259> want<00:01:37.560> to

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
high speed so that's what I want to

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:45.920 
high speed so that's what I want to
demonstrate<00:01:37.920> today<00:01:38.430> I<00:01:38.940> was<00:01:39.780> this<00:01:44.930> certainly

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
demonstrate today I was this certainly

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:53.710 
demonstrate today I was this certainly
I'm<00:01:46.350> not<00:01:46.619> very<00:01:47.009> good<00:01:47.130> at<00:01:47.520> testing<00:01:49.399> actually

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.590 

big<00:01:54.720> ma<00:01:54.990> was<00:01:55.200> introduced<00:01:55.950> from<00:01:56.399> China<00:01:56.600> 200

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
big ma was introduced from China 200

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.359 
big ma was introduced from China 200
years<00:01:57.810> ago<00:01:58.190> in<00:01:59.190> the<00:01:59.399> Edo<00:01:59.640> area<00:02:00.149> and<00:02:01.369> people

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
years ago in the Edo area and people

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.669 
years ago in the Edo area and people
back<00:02:02.789> then<00:02:03.060> where<00:02:03.630> was<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:04.910> conch<00:02:05.910> shell<00:02:06.240> and

00:02:06.669 --> 00:02:06.679 
back then where was the conch shell and

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:13.760 
back then where was the conch shell and
then<00:02:08.179> evolved<00:02:09.470> to<00:02:10.470> using<00:02:11.039> the<00:02:11.190> wood<00:02:12.770> materials

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
then evolved to using the wood materials

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.790 
then evolved to using the wood materials
and<00:02:14.280> then<00:02:14.550> eventually<00:02:15.030> become<00:02:15.660> you<00:02:16.410> start

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
and then eventually become you start

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.760 
and then eventually become you start
using<00:02:17.040> cast<00:02:17.520> iron<00:02:17.700> after<00:02:18.599> the<00:02:18.900> World<00:02:19.110> War<00:02:19.290> two

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
using cast iron after the World War two

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.220 
using cast iron after the World War two
that's<00:02:20.550> where<00:02:20.970> the<00:02:21.120> big<00:02:21.330> one<00:02:21.660> was<00:02:21.810> becoming

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
that's where the big one was becoming

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.180 
that's where the big one was becoming
really<00:02:22.560> popular<00:02:22.819> and<00:02:23.819> we<00:02:24.180> are<00:02:24.360> about

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
really popular and we are about

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.120 
really popular and we are about
generations<00:02:26.780> the<00:02:27.780> kids<00:02:28.230> of<00:02:28.590> the<00:02:28.770> World<00:02:29.010> War

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
generations the kids of the World War

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.530 
generations the kids of the World War
two<00:02:29.459> generation

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
two generation

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.089 
two generation
so<00:02:32.760> parents<00:02:33.760> may<00:02:34.150> be<00:02:34.650> starting<00:02:35.650> of<00:02:35.769> the<00:02:35.890> paper

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099 
so parents may be starting of the paper

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:38.640 
so parents may be starting of the paper
mind<00:02:36.400> and<00:02:36.700> our<00:02:37.030> generation<00:02:37.720> is<00:02:37.900> probably<00:02:38.560> the

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
mind and our generation is probably the

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.600 
mind and our generation is probably the
end<00:02:39.209> of<00:02:40.209> the<00:02:40.540> big<00:02:40.900> of<00:02:41.019> our<00:02:41.140> generation<00:02:41.709> and<00:02:41.950> now

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
end of the big of our generation and now

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:48.660 
end of the big of our generation and now
our<00:02:43.000> kids<00:02:43.680> is<00:02:45.239> this<00:02:46.239> people<00:02:46.959> so<00:02:47.709> you<00:02:48.280> know<00:02:48.400> when

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
our kids is this people so you know when

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.710 
our kids is this people so you know when
we<00:02:48.790> see<00:02:49.090> the<00:02:49.269> void<00:02:49.590> we<00:02:50.590> recalled<00:02:51.430> a<00:02:51.700> coma<00:02:52.090> and

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
we see the void we recalled a coma and

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.399 
we see the void we recalled a coma and
that's<00:02:53.200> why<00:02:53.409> it<00:02:53.890> was<00:02:54.069> so<00:02:54.519> popular<00:02:54.549> in<00:02:54.970> Japan

00:02:55.399 --> 00:02:55.409 
that's why it was so popular in Japan

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:57.720 
that's why it was so popular in Japan
let's<00:02:56.409> see<00:02:56.680> one<00:02:57.069> more<00:02:57.220> try

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
let's see one more try

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:05.759 
let's see one more try
I<00:03:00.299> really<00:03:01.299> suck<00:03:04.200> this<00:03:05.200> need<00:03:05.440> a<00:03:05.470> lot<00:03:05.739> of

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
I really suck this need a lot of

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:10.199 
I really suck this need a lot of
practice<00:03:06.659> if<00:03:07.659> you<00:03:07.840> see<00:03:08.170> on<00:03:08.409> youtube<00:03:09.209> you'll

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
practice if you see on youtube you'll

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:12.390 
practice if you see on youtube you'll
see<00:03:10.510> a<00:03:10.540> bunch<00:03:10.959> of<00:03:11.139> people<00:03:11.349> I<00:03:11.680> should<00:03:11.920> use<00:03:12.190> the

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
see a bunch of people I should use the

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:18.240 
see a bunch of people I should use the
real<00:03:12.579> cast<00:03:13.090> iron<00:03:14.879> metal<00:03:15.879> wheel<00:03:17.069> those<00:03:18.069> are

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
real cast iron metal wheel those are

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:23.280 
real cast iron metal wheel those are
pretty<00:03:18.430> fun<00:03:20.519> you<00:03:21.519> can<00:03:21.760> actually<00:03:21.970> see<00:03:22.299> during

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
pretty fun you can actually see during

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.129 
pretty fun you can actually see during
the<00:03:23.470> attack<00:03:23.879> when<00:03:24.879> the<00:03:25.030> tube<00:03:25.299> a<00:03:25.540> cast<00:03:25.989> iron

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:26.139 
the attack when the tube a cast iron

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:28.020 
the attack when the tube a cast iron
arrow<00:03:26.290> hits<00:03:26.620> you<00:03:27.040> can<00:03:27.190> see<00:03:27.400> the<00:03:27.489> spark<00:03:27.849> coming

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
arrow hits you can see the spark coming

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.470 
arrow hits you can see the spark coming
out

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.410 

no<00:03:33.080> I'm<00:03:33.470> just<00:03:33.650> talking<00:03:33.950> talking<00:03:34.610> I<00:03:35.030> never
