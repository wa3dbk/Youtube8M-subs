00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.950
 - here we are in I was a number 4 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:11.460
 to make a small comparison between 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.990
 gta iv and gta 5 at the driving level 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.849
 vehicles that has 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.460
 according to very many players 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:19.240
 much evolved not necessarily so 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.599
 positive 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:24.770
 we're going to be we'll start the comparison 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:27.500
 right now 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:30.620
 first element which is a positive point 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:33.350
 for gt r 5 is the possibility 

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:35.180
 obviously to modify the vehicles of 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:39.020
 to do tuning or preparation 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.810
 sporty then an acceleration that is 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.330
 strong 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:46.810
 that's it and a very big impression of 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:50.370
 speed with the fuzzy contours that this 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:52.630
 which depreciates zh with speed 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.150
 another element that can be noticed 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:57.610
 here is that when we hit or we hit 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.960
 close to a vehicle the car is not 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.820
 hindered in his momentum 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.190
 the car can continue driving from 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.770
 way brightly enough while in gta 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:08.950
 5 very blatant is very 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.990
 pain with with cars it's 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.750
 that we are constantly constantly 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.490
 stopped while driving 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.220
 you see it plainly we can pass 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.330
 under a car it's really 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.090
 really something very very 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:25.030
 positive then another element that has 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:27.280
 also greatly changed and who 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.229
 very strongly impacts the sensitivity of 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.250
 driving and planck from version 4 to 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:33.430
 version 5 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:36.430
 there was the appearance of the decline 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:38.290
 necessarily as the game is when 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.140
 even in our contemporary world 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.040
 American 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.250
 so here I will try to make a 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:49.240
 little by little braking here you see 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:52.050
 like that skips it's still 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.940
 sensations not found in gta 5 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:57.220
 with particular braking that is 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:00.220
 much more much more 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.960
 powerful then we'll do a little test 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.850
 braking also so that was 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.090
 only the handbrake if I can 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.800
 say 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.580
 now we will brake forward and 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:12.600
 from the back then it's gone 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:15.240
 here is full braking so it skates 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:18.360
 and it stops a lot more 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.950
 late than in gta 5 which was not bad 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.260
 whose gta iv is we could when 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.940
 even repair the vehicle using the 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.850
 little cheat codes nice enough 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:30.600
 fire setting not available on gta iv 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:33.990
 good then obviously at the design level 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.310
 and then the realism of the game we are very 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:40.290
 very far from throwing r5 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:42.360
 it's clear gta 5 really is a 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.620
 very strong and very sharp evolution on 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.400
 the graphics on them on the details 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:51.420
 on character dialogues 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:54.840
 also but eventually I find myself 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.910
 that it has its charm a little game a little 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.400
 vintage like that eventually even if the 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:03.060
 from 2008 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:07.560
 here we are in 2013 so five years later 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:10.140
 there is already a small offbeat appearance on 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:14.130
 vitello is still at this level 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:16.709
 difference a sensitivity an impression 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.090
 of sailing to watch this floating see 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.540
 we can really make reminders of 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.820
 vehicles 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.030
 if you do that with vehicles 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:26.160
 in gta 5 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:28.680
 it is directly the head-to-tail 1 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.660
 while there is really this this 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.530
 maneuverability this possibility of 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.100
 control the car 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.660
 so certainly there may be less 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.239
 realism but there is still a lot 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.620
 more sensations in me I find I 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.660
 do not know what you think about it but 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.340
 opinions are quite divided 1 according to 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.480
 what we can see on youtube and then 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.739
 on the forums a new account mode 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.890
 which is getting closer to the 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:53.049
 arcade driving can seduce because 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:56.290
 it's true that it's still very 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:04:00.099
 nice we have we are maybe a 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:03.150
 direction more sharp but good for 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:06.760
 me finally there is a loss at the level 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:10.890
 at the level of sensations and at the level of 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:13.510
 pleasure to drive remember the iv gta 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:16.810
 the story is in the 2000s 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:19.209
 while gta 5 is really it's 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:22.120
 contemporary is the years 2010 and 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:25.720
 the evolution of cars between 2000 and 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:28.210
 2010 was very clear 2000 it's still 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:31.080
 very close to the 90s so no 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:34.090
 abbey is this no power steering 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:37.210
 a lot of sailing to still design 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:40.510
 enough a big sec 1 while the 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:44.370
 2010 years ago there really is the appearance 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:46.539
 of embedded electronics to 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.940
 I really did not go in 

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:50.470
 the sahara and i think i have in gt r 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:52.840
 5 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:55.289
 rockstar to develop this aspect this is 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.289
 a scanner
