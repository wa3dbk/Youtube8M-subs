00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.109 
and basically we are looking at
measuring<00:01:45.380> of<00:01:45.619> two<00:01:46.009> things<00:01:46.310> the<00:01:46.729> stage<00:01:47.000> of

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
measuring of two things the stage of

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:48.910 
measuring of two things the stage of
development<00:01:47.179> of<00:01:47.600> team<00:01:47.720> is<00:01:47.840> in<00:01:48.020> but<00:01:48.470> also<00:01:48.619> some

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
development of team is in but also some

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.490 
development of team is in but also some
core<00:01:49.160> competencies<00:01:49.819> the<00:01:50.479> beauty<00:01:50.959> of<00:01:50.990> this<00:01:51.229> is

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
core competencies the beauty of this is

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.190 
core competencies the beauty of this is
that<00:01:51.890> folks<00:01:52.250> can<00:01:52.340> actually<00:01:52.670> go<00:01:52.789> online

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
that folks can actually go online

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.260 
that folks can actually go online
participants<00:01:54.200> team<00:01:55.069> members<00:01:55.399> attending<00:01:56.179> the

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
participants team members attending the

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.779 
participants team members attending the
session<00:01:56.630> and<00:01:56.780> they<00:01:57.530> can<00:01:57.920> then<00:01:58.369> answer

00:01:58.779 --> 00:01:58.789 
session and they can then answer

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:00.790 
session and they can then answer
questions<00:01:59.630> that<00:01:59.720> are<00:01:59.869> provide<00:02:00.140> diagnostic

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:00.800 
questions that are provide diagnostic

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.210 
questions that are provide diagnostic
data<00:02:01.610> for<00:02:02.179> us<00:02:02.300> we're<00:02:03.289> able<00:02:03.349> to<00:02:03.500> tell<00:02:03.679> what

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
data for us we're able to tell what

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.350 
data for us we're able to tell what
stage<00:02:04.399> of<00:02:04.490> development<00:02:04.819> they're<00:02:05.060> in<00:02:05.149> but<00:02:05.270> we

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
stage of development they're in but we

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.540 
stage of development they're in but we
can<00:02:05.509> also<00:02:05.750> tell<00:02:06.140> jeez<00:02:06.619> what's<00:02:06.890> the<00:02:06.979> perception

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
can also tell jeez what's the perception

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.550 
can also tell jeez what's the perception
of<00:02:07.640> this<00:02:07.789> group<00:02:08.030> on<00:02:08.390> some<00:02:08.780> key<00:02:09.170> core

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
of this group on some key core

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.589 
of this group on some key core
competencies<00:02:10.220> let's<00:02:11.000> share<00:02:11.180> these<00:02:11.270> with<00:02:11.450> you

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:11.599 
competencies let's share these with you

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:14.080 
competencies let's share these with you
for<00:02:12.410> example<00:02:12.860> we<00:02:13.220> talked<00:02:13.430> about<00:02:13.550> stages<00:02:14.000> of

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
for example we talked about stages of

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.059 
for example we talked about stages of
development<00:02:14.450> way<00:02:14.990> back<00:02:15.470> if<00:02:15.650> you<00:02:15.770> can<00:02:15.890> remember

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
development way back if you can remember

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:17.589 
development way back if you can remember
it's<00:02:16.340> hard<00:02:16.520> to<00:02:16.610> believe<00:02:16.700> but<00:02:16.910> way<00:02:17.240> back<00:02:17.390> in<00:02:17.540> the

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599 
it's hard to believe but way back in the

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:19.570 
it's hard to believe but way back in the
january/february<00:02:18.050> issue<00:02:18.620> we<00:02:19.220> talked<00:02:19.459> about

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
january/february issue we talked about

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.270 
january/february issue we talked about
dependency<00:02:20.180> conflict<00:02:20.930> cohesion<00:02:21.560> and<00:02:21.709> synergy

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
dependency conflict cohesion and synergy

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.280

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
similar so what we do is we get folks to

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.490 
similar so what we do is we get folks to
go<00:02:29.209> online<00:02:29.330> and<00:02:29.540> they<00:02:29.810> answer<00:02:30.110> questions

go online and they answer questions

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.410 
go online and they answer questions
about<00:02:30.590> the<00:02:30.860> group<00:02:31.069> dependency<00:02:32.060> we'll<00:02:32.270> talk

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
about the group dependency we'll talk

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:33.880 
about the group dependency we'll talk
about<00:02:32.540> our<00:02:32.720> group<00:02:32.870> attend<00:02:33.110> dependency<00:02:33.739> is<00:02:33.860> a

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
about our group attend dependency is a

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.140 
about our group attend dependency is a
group<00:02:34.160> that's<00:02:34.340> looking<00:02:34.430> for<00:02:34.910> direction

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
group that's looking for direction

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
looking for guidance from its leadership

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.260 
looking for guidance from its leadership
it's<00:02:38.180> in<00:02:38.270> a<00:02:38.330> fairly<00:02:38.750> early<00:02:38.959> stage<00:02:39.610> now<00:02:40.610> once

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
it's in a fairly early stage now once

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.870 
it's in a fairly early stage now once
groups<00:02:42.200> are<00:02:42.770> in<00:02:43.040> this<00:02:43.190> stage<00:02:43.459> and<00:02:43.670> they<00:02:43.730> move

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
groups are in this stage and they move

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.250 
groups are in this stage and they move
on<00:02:44.000> of<00:02:44.330> course<00:02:44.360> we<00:02:44.569> want<00:02:44.810> them<00:02:44.900> to<00:02:44.959> go<00:02:45.110> through

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
on of course we want them to go through

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.080 
on of course we want them to go through
the<00:02:45.349> conflict<00:02:45.800> stage<00:02:46.040> and<00:02:46.340> what<00:02:46.940> this

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
the conflict stage and what this

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.140 
the conflict stage and what this
instrument<00:02:47.420> will<00:02:47.660> measure<00:02:47.690> is<00:02:48.020> our<00:02:48.290> folks

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
instrument will measure is our folks

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.390 
instrument will measure is our folks
addressing<00:02:50.150> conflict<00:02:50.900> with<00:02:51.799> the<00:02:51.950> appropriate

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
addressing conflict with the appropriate

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.970 
addressing conflict with the appropriate
people<00:02:52.640> the<00:02:53.060> appropriate<00:02:53.599> way<00:02:53.920> everybody<00:02:54.920> can

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
people the appropriate way everybody can

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:55.740 
people the appropriate way everybody can
have<00:02:55.219> conflict

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
have conflict

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.270 
have conflict
that's<00:02:55.900> easy<00:02:56.110> I<00:02:56.410> mean<00:02:56.560> you<00:02:56.650> know<00:02:56.770> if<00:02:56.890> I<00:02:57.040> slap

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
that's easy I mean you know if I slap

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.530 
that's easy I mean you know if I slap
you<00:02:57.430> in<00:02:57.490> the<00:02:57.520> head<00:02:57.700> hey<00:02:57.910> that's<00:02:58.120> conflict

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
you in the head hey that's conflict

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.540 
you in the head hey that's conflict
that's<00:02:58.810> not<00:02:58.960> healthy<00:02:59.320> conflict<00:02:59.620> so<00:03:00.430> we're

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
that's not healthy conflict so we're

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.280 
that's not healthy conflict so we're
talking<00:03:00.670> about<00:03:00.910> that<00:03:01.090> constructive<00:03:01.690> stuff<00:03:01.870> do

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
talking about that constructive stuff do

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.520 
talking about that constructive stuff do
we<00:03:02.320> do<00:03:02.590> that<00:03:02.800> here<00:03:03.240> also<00:03:04.240> once<00:03:04.690> we<00:03:04.750> move<00:03:04.960> on<00:03:05.110> do

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
we do that here also once we move on do

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.010 
we do that here also once we move on do
we<00:03:05.650> start<00:03:05.890> to<00:03:05.980> operate<00:03:06.190> as<00:03:06.310> cohesive<00:03:06.970> unit<00:03:07.020> do

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 
we start to operate as cohesive unit do

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.450 
we start to operate as cohesive unit do
we<00:03:08.170> start<00:03:08.440> to<00:03:08.590> reap<00:03:08.800> the<00:03:08.950> fruits<00:03:09.190> of<00:03:09.280> our<00:03:09.400> labor

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:09.460 
we start to reap the fruits of our labor

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.910 
we start to reap the fruits of our labor
and<00:03:09.940> of<00:03:10.300> course<00:03:10.510> if<00:03:10.750> we're<00:03:10.900> moving<00:03:11.170> on<00:03:11.320> we<00:03:11.800> can

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
and of course if we're moving on we can

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.800 
and of course if we're moving on we can
get<00:03:12.010> into<00:03:12.160> a<00:03:12.190> synergistic<00:03:12.910> stage<00:03:13.150> you<00:03:13.630> really

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
get into a synergistic stage you really

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.270 
get into a synergistic stage you really
start<00:03:14.020> to<00:03:14.050> see<00:03:14.140> things<00:03:14.380> pop<00:03:14.709> in<00:03:14.890> it's<00:03:15.040> really

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
start to see things pop in it's really

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.490 
start to see things pop in it's really
it's<00:03:15.760> quite<00:03:15.940> a<00:03:16.030> sight<00:03:16.240> to<00:03:16.270> see<00:03:16.420> when<00:03:17.050> teams<00:03:17.260> get

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
it's quite a sight to see when teams get

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.530 
it's quite a sight to see when teams get
to<00:03:17.620> that<00:03:17.770> stage<00:03:18.030> so<00:03:19.030> what<00:03:19.180> they're<00:03:19.300> doing<00:03:19.480> is

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
to that stage so what they're doing is

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.030 
to that stage so what they're doing is
they're<00:03:19.600> answering<00:03:19.900> questions<00:03:20.350> and

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
they're answering questions and

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.290 
they're answering questions and
basically<00:03:21.250> it's<00:03:21.580> called<00:03:21.700> the<00:03:21.820> five<00:03:22.030> star

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:22.300 
basically it's called the five star

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.540

team so folks will answer questions in

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.380 
team so folks will answer questions in
that<00:03:29.500> way<00:03:29.680> when<00:03:30.280> we<00:03:30.340> get<00:03:30.459> the<00:03:30.580> data<00:03:30.790> back<00:03:31.060> you

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
that way when we get the data back you

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:32.820 
that way when we get the data back you
start<00:03:31.660> to<00:03:31.750> see<00:03:31.959> it<00:03:32.110> and<00:03:32.260> it's<00:03:32.350> being<00:03:32.470> graphed

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 
start to see it and it's being graphed

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.820 
start to see it and it's being graphed
on<00:03:33.130> on<00:03:33.670> a<00:03:33.730> PowerPoint<00:03:34.270> presentation<00:03:34.530> we<00:03:35.530> share

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
on on a PowerPoint presentation we share

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.400 
on on a PowerPoint presentation we share
that<00:03:36.040> with<00:03:36.400> the<00:03:36.640> team<00:03:36.910> as<00:03:37.209> part<00:03:37.840> of<00:03:38.050> its

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
that with the team as part of its

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.710 
that with the team as part of its
session<00:03:38.830> so<00:03:39.670> for<00:03:39.970> example<00:03:40.330> we're<00:03:40.450> getting

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
session so for example we're getting

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.080 
session so for example we're getting
data<00:03:40.930> back<00:03:41.280> if<00:03:42.280> we<00:03:42.370> know<00:03:42.700> that<00:03:42.910> we're<00:03:43.000> getting

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
data back if we know that we're getting

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.360 
data back if we know that we're getting
data<00:03:43.360> back<00:03:43.510> and<00:03:43.810> we<00:03:43.900> got<00:03:44.050> out<00:03:44.560> of<00:03:44.680> five<00:03:45.010> stars

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
data back and we got out of five stars

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.670 
data back and we got out of five stars
we<00:03:45.910> got<00:03:46.120> a<00:03:46.150> high<00:03:46.510> number<00:03:46.570> hanging<00:03:47.290> on<00:03:47.380> here<00:03:47.560> in

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
we got a high number hanging on here in

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.290 
we got a high number hanging on here in
the<00:03:47.770> dependency<00:03:48.130> stage<00:03:48.489> you<00:03:49.090> know<00:03:49.150> we're

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:49.300 
the dependency stage you know we're

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.390 
the dependency stage you know we're
looking<00:03:49.390> at<00:03:49.630> something<00:03:49.870> it's<00:03:50.080> like<00:03:50.110> woo<00:03:50.400> 4.1

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
looking at something it's like woo 4.1

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.520 
looking at something it's like woo 4.1
and<00:03:51.640> then<00:03:52.270> our<00:03:52.390> conflict<00:03:52.900> stage<00:03:53.080> we<00:03:53.290> found

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
and then our conflict stage we found

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:54.900 
and then our conflict stage we found
that<00:03:53.680> jisse<00:03:53.890> we<00:03:54.040> got<00:03:54.190> these<00:03:54.310> answers<00:03:54.610> that

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
that jisse we got these answers that

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.240 
that jisse we got these answers that
were<00:03:55.000> like<00:03:55.150> four<00:03:55.450> point<00:03:55.780> three<00:03:55.930> and<00:03:56.560> then<00:03:57.220> of

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
were like four point three and then of

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:58.949 
were like four point three and then of
course<00:03:57.520> with<00:03:57.670> cohesion<00:03:58.209> um<00:03:58.450> well<00:03:58.720> the

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
course with cohesion um well the

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:00.780 
course with cohesion um well the
cohesion<00:03:59.290> brought<00:03:59.739> us<00:03:59.890> way<00:04:00.070> down<00:04:00.340> that<00:04:00.459> is<00:04:00.519> two

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
cohesion brought us way down that is two

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.120 
cohesion brought us way down that is two
point<00:04:01.060> nine<00:04:01.360> and<00:04:01.720> then<00:04:02.260> of<00:04:02.380> course<00:04:02.410> synergy

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
point nine and then of course synergy

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.940 
point nine and then of course synergy
was<00:04:03.340> hanging<00:04:03.670> around<00:04:03.730> 2.8<00:04:04.600> and<00:04:04.930> of<00:04:05.500> course<00:04:05.709> we

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:05.950 
was hanging around 2.8 and of course we

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:07.830 
was hanging around 2.8 and of course we
connect<00:04:06.250> the<00:04:06.340> dots<00:04:06.370> so<00:04:06.730> you're<00:04:07.000> actually<00:04:07.180> able

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
connect the dots so you're actually able

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.979 
connect the dots so you're actually able
to<00:04:07.989> see<00:04:08.350> a<00:04:08.620> readout<00:04:09.370> of<00:04:09.400> your<00:04:09.790> team<00:04:10.060> so<00:04:10.900> you

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:10.989 
to see a readout of your team so you

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:13.170 
to see a readout of your team so you
know<00:04:11.080> ideally<00:04:11.470> what<00:04:11.860> we<00:04:11.980> want<00:04:12.250> to<00:04:12.459> see<00:04:12.640> on<00:04:12.820> this

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
know ideally what we want to see on this

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.570 
know ideally what we want to see on this
graph<00:04:13.510> is<00:04:13.870> we<00:04:14.470> want<00:04:14.680> to<00:04:14.769> be<00:04:14.860> able<00:04:14.950> to<00:04:15.160> see<00:04:15.370> a

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:15.580 
graph is we want to be able to see a

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:20.009 
graph is we want to be able to see a
slope<00:04:16.150> where<00:04:16.720> dependency<00:04:17.470> is<00:04:17.680> low<00:04:19.019> conflict

slope where dependency is low conflict

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.710 
slope where dependency is low conflict
is<00:04:20.229> low<00:04:20.760> meaning<00:04:21.760> it's<00:04:22.000> being<00:04:22.330> addressed<00:04:22.570> by

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 
is low meaning it's being addressed by

the right people and of course cohesion

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.870 
the right people and of course cohesion
and<00:04:25.210> synergy<00:04:26.020> are<00:04:26.229> high<00:04:26.530> what<00:04:27.430> we're<00:04:27.610> able<00:04:27.700> to

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
and synergy are high what we're able to

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.150 
and synergy are high what we're able to
do<00:04:28.030> is<00:04:28.180> we<00:04:28.300> get<00:04:28.450> this<00:04:28.570> result<00:04:28.930> results<00:04:29.410> back<00:04:29.620> we
