00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.060
 the capitals of benzem and the removal of taras 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.910

 you joke so manta yamantau go 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:33.900
 faster so the penalty is not the closest but 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:33.900
 sometimes you can score 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.960
 on 3 and knew would play out 

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:48.409

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:14.740
