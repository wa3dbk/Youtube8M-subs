hello's Eric from Bosch here again and

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:03.889 
hello's Eric from Bosch here again and
this<00:00:02.220> time<00:00:02.460> I<00:00:02.700> would<00:00:02.970> like<00:00:03.090> to<00:00:03.270> show<00:00:03.449> you<00:00:03.480> the

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
this time I would like to show you the

this time I would like to show you the
GST<00:00:04.589> 25m<00:00:05.520> professional<00:00:06.330> jigsaw<00:00:08.000> 25m<00:00:09.000> for

GST 25m professional jigsaw 25m for

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.200 
GST 25m professional jigsaw 25m for
methyl<00:00:10.250> usually<00:00:11.250> jigsaws<00:00:11.670> are<00:00:11.820> associated

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
methyl usually jigsaws are associated

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.060 
methyl usually jigsaws are associated
with<00:00:12.360> woodworking<00:00:12.870> but<00:00:13.290> actually<00:00:13.710> it's

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
with woodworking but actually it's

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.010 
with woodworking but actually it's
surprising<00:00:14.580> how<00:00:14.700> many<00:00:14.759> methyl<00:00:15.360> blades<00:00:15.809> are

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
surprising how many methyl blades are

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.310 
surprising how many methyl blades are
sold<00:00:16.289> to<00:00:16.830> jigsaw<00:00:17.310> users<00:00:18.000> so<00:00:18.840> what's<00:00:19.170> different

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
sold to jigsaw users so what's different

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.370 
sold to jigsaw users so what's different
about<00:00:19.560> the<00:00:19.800> GST<00:00:20.490> 25m<00:00:21.270> obviously<00:00:21.779> is<00:00:21.840> optimized

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380

about the GST 25m obviously is optimized
for<00:00:22.529> metal<00:00:22.920> cutting<00:00:23.279> what<00:00:23.400> does<00:00:23.490> that<00:00:23.519> mean<00:00:23.850> it

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
for metal cutting what does that mean it

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.660 
for metal cutting what does that mean it
means<00:00:24.539> that<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:25.260> stroke<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:26.130> amount<00:00:26.519> of

means that the stroke the amount of

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.609 
means that the stroke the amount of
movement<00:00:26.910> that<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.750> plunger<00:00:28.170> and<00:00:28.199> therefore

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
movement that the plunger and therefore

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.230 
movement that the plunger and therefore
the<00:00:28.710> blade<00:00:28.920> makes<00:00:29.220> is<00:00:29.460> shorter<00:00:29.939> on<00:00:30.060> this

this is the GST 140 of course we have

this is the GST 140 of course we have

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
pendulum on here to full speed so let's

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.300 
pendulum on here to full speed so let's
see<00:01:19.350> how<00:01:19.439> we<00:01:19.530> get<00:01:19.680> on<00:01:19.799> with<00:01:19.920> this<00:01:20.100> piece<00:01:20.280> of

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
see how we get on with this piece of

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.560 
see how we get on with this piece of
steel<00:01:20.640> I<00:01:20.700> think<00:01:20.939> they're<00:01:21.030> taking<00:01:21.299> two<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:21.479> a

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
steel I think they're taking two and a

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.359 
steel I think they're taking two and a
half<00:01:21.689> three<00:01:21.869> millimeters<00:01:22.680> mild<00:01:22.890> steel<00:01:23.189> and

half three millimeters mild steel and

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:24.880 
half three millimeters mild steel and
we'll<00:01:23.670> just<00:01:23.820> do<00:01:23.909> head-to-head<00:01:24.360> to<00:01:24.540> see

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
we'll just do head-to-head to see

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.080 
we'll just do head-to-head to see
whether<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.040> 25<00:01:26.400> really<00:01:26.670> is<00:01:26.790> that<00:01:26.939> much

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
whether the 25 really is that much

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:51.380 
whether the 25 really is that much
faster

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.370 

okay<00:01:52.390> I<00:01:52.420> think<00:01:52.630> you'll<00:01:52.750> see<00:01:52.960> I<00:01:52.990> was<00:01:53.200> pushing

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
okay I think you'll see I was pushing

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.520 
okay I think you'll see I was pushing
the<00:01:53.560> 140<00:01:54.189> as<00:01:54.700> hard<00:01:55.000> as<00:01:55.119> I<00:01:55.240> dare<00:01:55.540> without

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
the 140 as hard as I dare without

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.770 
the 140 as hard as I dare without
wanting<00:01:56.710> to<00:01:56.890> break<00:01:56.979> the<00:01:57.280> blade<00:01:57.460> but<00:01:57.820> the<00:01:58.390> 25

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
wanting to break the blade but the 25

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.690 
wanting to break the blade but the 25
was<00:01:58.960> racing<00:01:59.439> ahead<00:01:59.710> with<00:01:59.860> the<00:01:59.950> same<00:02:00.189> blade<00:02:00.430> in

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
was racing ahead with the same blade in

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.120 
was racing ahead with the same blade in
the<00:02:00.909> same<00:02:01.090> material<00:02:01.600> so<00:02:01.750> that<00:02:01.930> clearly<00:02:02.799> shows

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
the same material so that clearly shows

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.480
