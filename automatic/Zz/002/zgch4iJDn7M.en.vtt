00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
the best option we're going to go out

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.060 
the best option we're going to go out
there<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:27.990> try<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:28.290> change<00:01:28.409> your<00:01:28.500> minds<00:01:28.860> so

there and try and change your minds so

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.030 
there and try and change your minds so
in<00:01:29.159> terms<00:01:29.340> of<00:01:29.520> performance<00:01:29.900> obviously

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
in terms of performance obviously

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.080 
in terms of performance obviously
improved<00:01:32.040> in<00:01:32.220> every<00:01:32.430> single<00:01:32.700> parameter

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
improved in every single parameter

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.140 
improved in every single parameter
correct<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.770> handling<00:01:35.070> on<00:01:35.159> this<00:01:35.250> car<00:01:35.460> is<00:01:35.970> the

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
correct the handling on this car is the

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.749 
correct the handling on this car is the
best<00:01:36.329> healing<00:01:36.479> WX<00:01:36.869> ever<00:01:37.079> and<00:01:37.350> I<00:01:38.040> think<00:01:38.640> by<00:01:38.729> a

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
best healing WX ever and I think by a

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.120 
best healing WX ever and I think by a
wide<00:01:39.000> margin<00:01:39.030> when<00:01:39.990> you<00:01:40.079> drive<00:01:40.259> this<00:01:40.409> car<00:01:40.619> the

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
wide margin when you drive this car the

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.679 
wide margin when you drive this car the
level<00:01:41.490> of<00:01:41.579> grip<00:01:41.880> we're<00:01:42.119> getting<00:01:42.390> out<00:01:42.509> of<00:01:42.540> this

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
level of grip we're getting out of this

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.660 
level of grip we're getting out of this
is<00:01:42.869> just<00:01:43.110> literally<00:01:43.710> amazing<00:01:44.100> I<00:01:44.220> mean<00:01:44.579> it's

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
is just literally amazing I mean it's

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.940 
is just literally amazing I mean it's
car<00:01:44.790> flies<00:01:45.180> for<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.540> Taurus<00:01:45.869> and<00:01:46.049> obviously

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
car flies for the Taurus and obviously

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.740 
car flies for the Taurus and obviously
all-wheel<00:01:47.520> drive<00:01:47.700> you<00:01:48.180> can<00:01:48.299> put<00:01:48.450> that<00:01:48.540> power

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
all-wheel drive you can put that power

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.149 
all-wheel drive you can put that power
down<00:01:48.990> in<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.500> corner<00:01:49.770> that's<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.009> great

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
down in the corner that's the great

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.620 
down in the corner that's the great
thing<00:01:50.189> about<00:01:50.340> driving<00:01:50.729> a<00:01:50.909> WX<00:01:51.240> or<00:01:51.360> an<00:01:51.420> FBI

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
thing about driving a WX or an FBI

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.480 
thing about driving a WX or an FBI
you're<00:01:52.320> always<00:01:52.439> able<00:01:52.649> to<00:01:52.770> explode<00:01:53.280> out<00:01:53.460> of
