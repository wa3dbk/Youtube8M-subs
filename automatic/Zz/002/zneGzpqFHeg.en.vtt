00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:03.549 
well his two ways to get starts one of

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:05.940 
well his two ways to get starts one of
them<00:01:03.729> is<00:01:03.850> a<00:01:03.879> taunt<00:01:04.210> but<00:01:04.839> he<00:01:04.930> also<00:01:05.049> the<00:01:05.710> first

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:05.950 
them is a taunt but he also the first

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.440 
them is a taunt but he also the first
way<00:01:06.130> is<00:01:07.950> pretty<00:01:08.950> much<00:01:09.130> when<00:01:09.340> he<00:01:09.430> uses<00:01:09.580> his<00:01:09.970> jab

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
way is pretty much when he uses his jab

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.630 
way is pretty much when he uses his jab
if<00:01:11.049> you<00:01:11.229> block<00:01:11.500> the<00:01:11.680> jab<00:01:11.979> you<00:01:12.189> get<00:01:12.280> a<00:01:12.340> brief

if you block the jab you get a brief

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.870 
if you block the jab you get a brief
opportunity<00:01:13.509> to<00:01:13.780> punch<00:01:14.380> him<00:01:14.500> in<00:01:14.560> the<00:01:14.619> gut<00:01:14.880> if

opportunity to punch him in the gut if

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.510 
opportunity to punch him in the gut if

for<00:01:34.749> the<00:01:37.109> don't<00:01:38.109> get<00:01:38.259> tired<00:01:38.590> challenge<00:01:39.369> at<00:01:39.549> the

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
for the don't get tired challenge at the

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.149 
for the don't get tired challenge at the
same<00:01:39.850> time<00:01:40.439> you're<00:01:41.439> gonna<00:01:41.619> want<00:01:41.829> to<00:01:41.889> keep<00:01:42.039> an

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:42.159 
same time you're gonna want to keep an

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:44.489 
same time you're gonna want to keep an
eye<00:01:42.249> on<00:01:42.280> your<00:01:42.520> stars<00:01:42.819> because<00:01:43.319> blocking<00:01:44.319> make

00:01:44.489 --> 00:01:44.499 
eye on your stars because blocking make

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:49.530 
eye on your stars because blocking make
sure<00:01:44.619> you<00:01:44.799> lose<00:01:45.189> a<00:01:45.249> star

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:49.540 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.940 

there's<00:01:50.540> probably<00:01:50.840> other<00:01:51.080> ways<00:01:51.170> to<00:01:51.560> use<00:01:51.740> like

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
there's probably other ways to use like

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.230 
there's probably other ways to use like
I<00:01:52.130> think<00:01:52.610> you<00:01:52.700> can<00:01:52.820> also<00:01:52.940> dodge<00:01:53.390> his<00:01:55.210> jab<00:01:56.210> and

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
I think you can also dodge his jab and

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.590 
I think you can also dodge his jab and
get<00:01:56.750> us<00:01:56.900> off<00:01:57.080> it's<00:01:57.500> pretty<00:01:57.680> much<00:01:57.830> like<00:01:58.600> when

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
get us off it's pretty much like when

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.359 
get us off it's pretty much like when
he's<00:01:59.840> got<00:02:00.200> his<00:02:00.320> hand<00:02:00.560> outstretched<00:02:00.740> and<00:02:01.250> he's

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
he's got his hand outstretched and he's

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:04.240 
he's got his hand outstretched and he's
missed<00:02:01.640> but<00:02:02.600> I<00:02:02.660> find<00:02:02.990> that<00:02:03.140> blocking<00:02:03.800> there's

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
missed but I find that blocking there's

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:05.950 
missed but I find that blocking there's
actually<00:02:04.580> the<00:02:04.640> easiest<00:02:04.940> way<00:02:05.119> to<00:02:05.150> do<00:02:05.360> it<00:02:05.509> and

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
actually the easiest way to do it and

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:19.949 
actually the easiest way to do it and
see<00:02:06.290> what<00:02:06.530> I<00:02:06.560> found<00:02:06.830> that<00:02:06.979> works

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:22.900 

now<00:02:20.959> I<00:02:21.200> mentioned<00:02:21.709> class<00:02:21.950> Joe<00:02:22.310> was<00:02:22.550> on<00:02:22.730> the

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
now I mentioned class Joe was on the

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.240 
now I mentioned class Joe was on the
captain<00:02:23.420> and<00:02:23.600> cartoon<00:02:24.050> King<00:02:24.860> Hippo<00:02:25.040> is

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
captain and cartoon King Hippo is

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:26.770

interesting<00:03:27.049> cuz<00:03:27.950> it<00:03:28.099> specific<00:03:28.519> way<00:03:28.609> to<00:03:28.640> do<00:03:28.879> it

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
interesting cuz it specific way to do it

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.369 
interesting cuz it specific way to do it
and<00:03:30.200> it's<00:03:31.569> somewhat<00:03:32.569> hard<00:03:32.599> to<00:03:32.900> pull<00:03:33.170> off<00:03:33.200> you

00:03:33.369 --> 00:03:33.379 
and it's somewhat hard to pull off you

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:34.839 
and it's somewhat hard to pull off you
have<00:03:33.500> to<00:03:33.530> be<00:03:33.680> good<00:03:33.799> at<00:03:33.980> countering<00:03:34.370> one<00:03:34.670> of<00:03:34.760> his

punches<00:03:36.250> so<00:03:37.250> here<00:03:37.519> I<00:03:38.290> decide<00:03:39.290> that<00:03:39.470> since

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
punches so here I decide that since

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:43.360 
punches so here I decide that since
nobody<00:03:40.159> just<00:03:40.280> wants<00:03:40.489> to<00:03:40.549> wait<00:03:42.190> for<00:03:43.190> me<00:03:43.280> to
