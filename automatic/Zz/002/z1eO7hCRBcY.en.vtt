here<00:01:47.780> is<00:01:47.840> guys<00:01:48.140> that<00:01:48.560> his<00:01:49.130> regular<00:01:49.580> card<00:01:49.909> is

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
here is guys that his regular card is

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:51.789 
here is guys that his regular card is
still<00:01:50.600> really<00:01:50.930> really<00:01:51.170> good<00:01:51.350> and<00:01:51.590> I<00:01:51.650> don't

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:51.799 
still really really good and I don't

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:53.920 
still really really good and I don't
think<00:01:51.950> it's<00:01:52.070> worth<00:01:52.220> paying<00:01:52.430> 130<00:01:53.090> K<00:01:53.299> for<00:01:53.840> this

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
think it's worth paying 130 K for this

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:55.570 
think it's worth paying 130 K for this
upgraded<00:01:54.350> version<00:01:54.710> let's<00:01:55.070> take<00:01:55.250> a<00:01:55.280> timeout

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
same time his regular card is a lot

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.090 
same time his regular card is a lot
cheaper<00:02:36.610> and<00:02:37.180> this<00:02:37.630> card<00:02:37.990> isn't<00:02:38.440> a<00:02:38.590> dramatic

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
upgrade over the last card because he

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.580 
upgrade over the last card because he
does<00:02:41.290> go<00:02:41.530> for<00:02:41.950> about<00:02:42.930> 120<00:02:43.930> K<00:02:44.080> more<00:02:44.320> than<00:02:44.500> his

handling<00:02:46.990> this<00:02:47.140> handling<00:02:47.740> just<00:02:47.920> makes<00:02:48.280> me

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:48.460 
handling this handling just makes me

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.550 
handling this handling just makes me
wanna<00:02:48.670> throw<00:02:48.970> my<00:02:49.420> controller<00:02:49.870> out<00:02:50.080> the<00:02:50.260> window

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
wanna throw my controller out the window

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.760 
wanna throw my controller out the window
it's<00:02:51.070> a<00:02:51.220> really<00:02:51.640> really<00:02:52.260> slow<00:02:53.260> shot<00:02:53.530> and<00:02:53.740> I

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
it's a really really slow shot and I

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.260 
it's a really really slow shot and I
don't<00:02:53.800> even<00:02:53.980> think<00:02:54.280> this<00:02:54.460> is<00:02:54.640> informed<00:02:55.180> with

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.270 
don't even think this is informed with

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.240 
don't even think this is informed with
fons<00:02:55.540> fault<00:02:55.870> this<00:02:56.050> happens<00:02:56.440> all<00:02:56.560> the<00:02:56.620> time<00:02:56.860> in

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
fons fault this happens all the time in

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.730 
fons fault this happens all the time in
FIFA<00:02:57.460> 13<00:02:57.490> a<00:02:57.820> low<00:02:58.090> shot<00:02:58.360> the<00:02:58.780> goalkeepers<00:02:59.350> don't

00:02:59.730 --> 00:02:59.740 
FIFA 13 a low shot the goalkeepers don't

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.980 
FIFA 13 a low shot the goalkeepers don't
want<00:02:59.890> to<00:02:59.980> catch<00:03:00.130> it<00:03:00.340> and<00:03:00.490> he<00:03:01.270> lost<00:03:01.540> the<00:03:01.660> second

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:01.990 
want to catch it and he lost the second

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:03.510 
want to catch it and he lost the second
chance<00:03:02.170> opportunity<00:03:02.830> but<00:03:03.190> one<00:03:03.340> more<00:03:03.490> thing

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:03.520 
chance opportunity but one more thing

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.000 
chance opportunity but one more thing
about<00:03:03.820> informed<00:03:04.390> with<00:03:04.540> fonts<00:03:04.840> handling<00:03:05.290> even

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
about informed with fonts handling even

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.320 
about informed with fonts handling even
though<00:03:06.100> it<00:03:06.250> showed<00:03:06.460> the<00:03:06.580> opposite<00:03:06.970> on<00:03:07.150> that

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
though it showed the opposite on that

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.180 
though it showed the opposite on that
last<00:03:07.540> play<00:03:07.780> most<00:03:08.140> of<00:03:08.260> the<00:03:08.350> time<00:03:08.560> when<00:03:08.740> he<00:03:08.770> I

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
last play most of the time when he I

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.190 
last play most of the time when he I
can't<00:03:09.760> catch<00:03:09.970> the<00:03:10.150> ball<00:03:10.270> usually<00:03:10.480> pushes<00:03:11.050> it

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
can't catch the ball usually pushes it

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:11.910 
can't catch the ball usually pushes it
out<00:03:11.320> of<00:03:11.470> bounds

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
out of bounds

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.200 
out of bounds
so<00:03:12.160> I<00:03:12.190> don't<00:03:12.280> think<00:03:12.430> that<00:03:12.520> would<00:03:12.760> be<00:03:12.790> a<00:03:12.880> big

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:13.210 
so I don't think that would be a big

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:15.390 
so I don't think that would be a big
problem<00:03:13.420> just<00:03:13.870> that<00:03:14.320> thing<00:03:14.560> happens<00:03:14.950> so<00:03:15.190> much

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
problem just that thing happens so much

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.980 
problem just that thing happens so much
in<00:03:15.460> FIFA<00:03:15.850> 13<00:03:15.880> I<00:03:16.360> just<00:03:16.390> wanted<00:03:16.720> to<00:03:16.840> talk<00:03:16.930> about

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:16.990 
in FIFA 13 I just wanted to talk about

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:19.050 
in FIFA 13 I just wanted to talk about
it<00:03:17.350> a<00:03:17.380> little<00:03:17.530> bit<00:03:17.680> been<00:03:18.250> informed<00:03:18.670> flaunt<00:03:18.910> if

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
it a little bit been informed flaunt if

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.280
