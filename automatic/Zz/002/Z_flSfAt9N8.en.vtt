00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
sign that says dock so I'm not really

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.770

but<00:01:12.930> I<00:01:13.020> don't<00:01:13.110> think<00:01:13.260> these<00:01:13.409> are<00:01:13.470> just<00:01:13.619> random

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
in this mode if you remember back in mob

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.830 
in this mode if you remember back in mob
of<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.650> dead<00:01:35.000> you<00:01:36.000> could<00:01:36.240> like<00:01:36.540> do<00:01:36.780> stuff

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
of the dead you could like do stuff

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.510 
of the dead you could like do stuff
while<00:01:37.170> you're<00:01:37.290> an<00:01:37.380> afterlife<00:01:37.680> mode<00:01:38.040> access

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
while you're an afterlife mode access

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.249 
while you're an afterlife mode access
doors<00:01:38.850> that<00:01:39.030> you<00:01:39.119> couldn't<00:01:39.420> do<00:01:39.570> while<00:01:40.110> you're

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
doors that you couldn't do while you're

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.170 
doors that you couldn't do while you're
an<00:01:40.380> actual<00:01:40.680> like<00:01:40.860> person<00:01:41.369> I<00:01:41.520> think<00:01:41.850> it's<00:01:42.030> kind

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
an actual like person I think it's kind

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.760 
an actual like person I think it's kind
of<00:01:42.210> like<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.450> same<00:01:42.720> type<00:01:42.990> of<00:01:43.170> thing<00:01:43.380> with<00:01:43.530> this

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
of like the same type of thing with this

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.230 
of like the same type of thing with this
because<00:01:44.100> when<00:01:44.369> you're<00:01:44.520> in<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.640> alien<00:01:45.060> mode

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
because when you're in the alien mode

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.450 
because when you're in the alien mode
those<00:01:45.450> doors<00:01:45.750> light<00:01:46.079> up<00:01:46.229> and<00:01:46.409> go<00:01:46.470> on<00:01:46.590> fire<00:01:46.860> but

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
those doors light up and go on fire but

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.580 
those doors light up and go on fire but
as<00:01:47.610> you<00:01:47.759> can<00:01:47.820> see<00:01:47.880> right<00:01:48.180> here<00:01:48.210> in<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:49.140> top

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
as you can see right here in the top

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.200 
as you can see right here in the top
right<00:01:49.860> hand<00:01:49.890> corner<00:01:50.189> where<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.790> door<00:01:50.970> would

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
right hand corner where the door would

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.649 
right hand corner where the door would
be<00:01:51.240> it<00:01:51.600> is<00:01:51.960> not<00:01:52.140> on<00:01:52.290> fire<00:01:52.649> so<00:01:53.610> it<00:01:53.880> only<00:01:54.119> happens

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
be it is not on fire so it only happens

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.240 
be it is not on fire so it only happens
when<00:01:55.020> you're<00:01:55.170> in<00:01:55.200> that<00:01:55.500> alien<00:01:55.890> mode<00:01:56.070> and<00:01:56.219> I

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
when you're in that alien mode and I

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.410 
when you're in that alien mode and I
think<00:01:56.430> it's<00:01:56.549> like<00:01:56.640> mob<00:01:56.850> of<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.030> dead<00:01:57.090> like<00:01:57.329> I

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
think it's like mob of the dead like I

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.270 
think it's like mob of the dead like I
talked<00:01:57.659> about<00:01:57.780> earlier<00:01:58.110> so<00:01:58.770> it<00:01:58.860> does<00:01:59.009> kind<00:01:59.219> of

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
talked about earlier so it does kind of

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.350 
talked about earlier so it does kind of
raise<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.579> question<00:01:59.969> of<00:02:00.060> whether<00:02:00.210> these

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
raise the question of whether these

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.569 
raise the question of whether these
doors<00:02:00.659> are<00:02:00.810> actually<00:02:01.259> for<00:02:01.560> most<00:02:02.189> people<00:02:02.490> are

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
doors are actually for most people are

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:03.679 
doors are actually for most people are
currently<00:02:02.850> thinking<00:02:03.119> that<00:02:03.210> it<00:02:03.299> has<00:02:03.450> something

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
currently thinking that it has something

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.450 
currently thinking that it has something
to<00:02:03.840> do<00:02:03.930> with<00:02:03.960> like<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.290> Easter<00:02:04.619> eggs<00:02:04.770> and<00:02:04.950> I<00:02:05.399> do

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
to do with like the Easter eggs and I do

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.080 
to do with like the Easter eggs and I do
agree<00:02:05.759> with<00:02:05.820> that

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
agree with that

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.999 
agree with that
I<00:02:06.210> do<00:02:06.270> think<00:02:06.600> that'll<00:02:06.869> have<00:02:07.049> more<00:02:07.590> than<00:02:07.770> just

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
I do think that'll have more than just

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.619 
I do think that'll have more than just
that<00:02:08.160> use<00:02:08.399> though<00:02:08.640> you<00:02:09.149> guys<00:02:09.270> can<00:02:09.420> go<00:02:09.509> ahead

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
that use though you guys can go ahead

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.240
