 Many people were asking me 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:31.030
 sorry the clips could not be recorded but 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:34.960
 there was a problem with the program 

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:38.830

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:40.950

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.820
 thanks for watching it let's see it 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:04.480
 let's accommodate the lights 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:06.260
 on the edge of the cloth 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:09.780
 and 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:12.050
 because let's do one first let's 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.050
 make the bullfight 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.050
 ah 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.840
 and we're going to start marking to cut 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:34.390
 you have to let the fabric be at 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:37.330
 backwards here we agreed previously 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:41.140
 back but how will it go in 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:42.900
 we're going to do what is the finger 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.520
 of the back 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:48.720
 if we are going to cut them I already had 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:54.410
 marked the line of what I will want 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.410
 that is crossed and we are going to cut 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:01.990
 to later arm 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:04.120
 we cut a strip of 7 centimeters to 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:07.720
 that the pd 5 do what will remain 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.650
 around the waist doing is like this already 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.570
 I cut it 

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:12.130
 now let's cut the glory of 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.340
 trousers 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.920
 I 'm looking for pants here 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:23.519
 the person to whom I'm going to do what 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:26.400
 they want straight legs that's why 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:29.970
 that is this way and we are going to cut it 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:32.730
 even and of lester in this part of here 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:37.019
 we're going to leave them as a fourth because 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:39.150
 I'm going to make it below the 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:44.720
 chest will not be around the waist going to 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.720
 stay higher because this person 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.660
 so 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:00.819
 Now let's talk about where we are and 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:05.140
 let's cut from here to down 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:10.120
 because this part of the blanket that 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:24.450
 down to be able to do this to be able to do it 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:24.450
 from here we cut back the insurance 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:29.590
 so they did not move because I put the 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.790
 quadruple fabric specialists more 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:36.610
 easy you do double only 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:39.610
 it's easier to cut too 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.610
 plus 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.360
 with the pants 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.069
 now let's join 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:04:00.140
 now let's do the sewing the 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:01.730
 sewing on the edge so you do not 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.770
 I'm going to parade that although this cloth 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:06.350
 I think he does not need 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:08.270
 let's use the zigzag 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:10.340
 and we're going to put it on the shore for 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:12.740
 after doing the straight we make a 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:17.130
 little more here to make it 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:23.430
 the union this is the zig zag 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:26.280
 this machine will have if you have this 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:28.050
 sewing type 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.330
 this nothing else are fixed what is the 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:34.880
 traffic is the straight every machine is 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.880
 different and now we're going to like 

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:49.919
 to one and the top part with the 

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:54.779
 down we are going to put a pin and I 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:56.960
 what it is the sides of the of 

00:04:54.779 --> 00:04:58.720
 that edits or 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.050
 the top 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.909
 to put it 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:06.379
 can make the folds in between 

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:06.379
 because it's going to be explained 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.520
 Y 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:17.699
 and to be able to know then if we see 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:17.699
 it is very little now we are going to make them 

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:26.740
 here we have just applied it and now 

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:26.740
 we go to the machine to pass the sewing 

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:36.869
 here after we're going to put a spring 

00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:36.869
 to make the upload easier 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:42.270
 now let's move 

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:44.689
 we are going to hit him 10 in what is everything 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:49.209
 around in the back 

00:05:44.689 --> 00:05:49.209
 and the sleeves and the neck 

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:54.490
 and to finish we have to unite the 

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:58.200
 short 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:06:00.060
 so you do not see the dir the union 

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:03.169
 Y 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:03.169
 and then let's take it 

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:09.430
 to finish nothing else let's join what 

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:12.919
 what is the wad with the back 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:16.219
 remember that it is crossed then this 

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:18.110
 it's the left side and we're going to join it 

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:22.180
 the right 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:22.180
 me to finally show them 

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:37.490
 and we have it finished 

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:52.319
 and we will teach them with our 

00:06:49.719 --> 00:06:52.319
