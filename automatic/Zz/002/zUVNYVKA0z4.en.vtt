half an hour hour half an hour stop and
it's<00:00:42.350> really<00:00:43.340> about<00:00:43.879> taking<00:00:44.120> things<00:00:44.480> very

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:44.720 
it's really about taking things very

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
slowly you know in this day and age we

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.119 
slowly you know in this day and age we
want<00:00:47.570> results<00:00:47.780> quickly<00:00:48.530> we<00:00:48.650> want<00:00:48.739> to<00:00:48.890> see<00:00:49.010> an

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:49.129 
want results quickly we want to see an

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:51.400 
want results quickly we want to see an
improvement<00:00:49.370> now<00:00:49.880> I'm<00:00:50.570> very<00:00:50.630> much<00:00:50.989> like<00:00:51.200> that

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
improvement now I'm very much like that

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.860 
improvement now I'm very much like that
but<00:00:52.070> I<00:00:52.100> very<00:00:52.220> shy<00:00:52.910> very<00:00:52.940> soon<00:00:53.329> realized<00:00:53.720> that

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
but I very shy very soon realized that

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.720 
but I very shy very soon realized that
to<00:00:54.649> get<00:00:54.800> better<00:00:54.980> at<00:00:55.130> your<00:00:55.250> instrument<00:00:55.610> does

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
to get better at your instrument does

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.170 
to get better at your instrument does
take<00:00:56.030> a<00:00:56.239> long<00:00:56.600> one<00:00:56.840> slow<00:00:57.410> practice<00:00:57.739> I<00:00:58.489> always

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 
take a long one slow practice I always

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:00.220 
take a long one slow practice I always
say<00:00:59.329> to<00:00:59.390> people<00:00:59.480> that<00:00:59.720> if<00:00:59.899> there<00:01:00.079> was<00:01:00.200> a

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
say to people that if there was a

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.680 
say to people that if there was a
shortcut<00:01:00.620> to<00:01:01.070> anything<00:01:01.489> on<00:01:01.820> one<00:01:02.420> planet

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
shortcut to anything on one planet

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.229 
shortcut to anything on one planet
especially<00:01:02.960> in<00:01:03.230> my<00:01:03.350> case<00:01:03.590> I<00:01:04.100> would<00:01:04.940> have<00:01:05.030> found

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.239 
especially in my case I would have found

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.359 
especially in my case I would have found
it<00:01:05.449> by<00:01:05.570> now<00:01:05.600> leaving<00:01:06.410> at<00:01:06.710> same<00:01:06.979> time<00:01:07.190> you

it by now leaving at same time you

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:14.350 
it by now leaving at same time you
opened<00:01:07.759> the<00:01:08.000> a<00:01:08.030> key<00:01:08.390> so<00:01:08.690> yeah

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.540

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:16.550 
laughs they can try and take your thumb

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:18.190 
laughs they can try and take your thumb
off<00:01:16.790> the<00:01:16.940> register<00:01:17.330> King<00:01:17.510> so<00:01:17.690> you're<00:01:18.020> playing

over time over a couple of weeks a

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:47.469 
over time over a couple of weeks a
couple<00:01:46.160> of<00:01:46.400> months<00:01:46.580> you'll<00:01:46.760> really<00:01:47.030> start<00:01:47.180> to

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
couple of months you'll really start to

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:55.380 
couple of months you'll really start to
notice<00:01:47.510> a<00:01:47.750> tip<00:01:47.930> that<00:01:52.150> is<00:01:53.150> beautiful

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
notice a tip that is beautiful

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.730 
notice a tip that is beautiful
practicing<00:01:56.390> that<00:01:56.510> lot<00:01:56.780> every<00:01:57.110> day<00:01:57.290> that<00:01:57.500> first

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
practicing that lot every day that first

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:08.419 
practicing that lot every day that first
section<00:01:58.340> of<00:01:58.580> flight<00:01:58.790> of<00:01:58.940> uncle<00:01:59.210> P<00:01:59.330> very<00:02:00.200> slowly

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.699 

you<00:02:08.880> don't<00:02:09.149> play<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.780> whole<00:02:10.020> piece<00:02:10.050> through

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
you don't play the whole piece through

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.100 
you don't play the whole piece through
at<00:02:10.979> that<00:02:11.039> tempo<00:02:11.880> so<00:02:12.360> you<00:02:12.450> didn't<00:02:12.930> make<00:02:13.050> one

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
at that tempo so you didn't make one

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.760 
at that tempo so you didn't make one
single<00:02:13.770> mistake<00:02:14.160> and<00:02:14.750> then<00:02:15.750> over<00:02:16.170> time<00:02:16.380> doing

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
single mistake and then over time doing

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.530 
single mistake and then over time doing
that<00:02:16.950> for<00:02:17.220> an<00:02:17.310> hour<00:02:17.430> or<00:02:17.640> so<00:02:17.819> then<00:02:18.240> you<00:02:18.420> would

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
that for an hour or so then you would

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.080 
that for an hour or so then you would
slowly<00:02:18.990> speed<00:02:19.410> it<00:02:19.560> up<00:02:19.680> it<00:02:20.400> takes<00:02:20.640> years<00:02:20.940> and

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
slowly speed it up it takes years and

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.640 
slowly speed it up it takes years and

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
years before we can get to a point where

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.010 
years before we can get to a point where

idea to design a new line of instruments

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.949 
idea to design a new line of instruments
that<00:02:49.350> we're<00:02:50.040> a<00:02:50.100> played<00:02:50.790> at<00:02:50.910> high<00:02:51.030> quality<00:02:51.450> but

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
that we're a played at high quality but

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:53.840 
that we're a played at high quality but
being<00:02:52.170> affordable<00:02:52.620> now<00:02:53.220> those<00:02:53.489> two<00:02:53.700> things

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
being affordable now those two things

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.900 
being affordable now those two things
don't<00:02:54.120> normally<00:02:54.480> go<00:02:54.630> together<00:02:55.670> and<00:02:56.670> that's

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
don't normally go together and that's

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.180 
don't normally go together and that's
that's<00:02:57.180> how<00:02:57.300> the<00:02:57.480> LeBlanc<00:02:58.290> bliss<00:02:58.530> was<00:02:58.800> was

that's how the LeBlanc bliss was was

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.400 
that's how the LeBlanc bliss was was
born<00:02:59.400> the<00:03:00.300> main<00:03:00.450> idea<00:03:00.810> was<00:03:01.050> we<00:03:01.200> wanted

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
born the main idea was we wanted

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.290 
born the main idea was we wanted
something<00:03:01.620> very<00:03:01.920> easy<00:03:02.069> to<00:03:02.310> play<00:03:02.430> and<00:03:02.940> if<00:03:03.180> you

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
something very easy to play and if you

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:04.759 
something very easy to play and if you
have<00:03:03.450> to<00:03:03.600> fight<00:03:03.900> with<00:03:03.930> your<00:03:04.260> instrument

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769

should<00:03:06.720> be<00:03:07.080> concentrating<00:03:07.500> on<00:03:07.800> which<00:03:08.010> is<00:03:08.160> how

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
should be concentrating on which is how

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.250

you can make it sound beautiful that is

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.259 
you can make it sound beautiful that is
what<00:03:10.590> it<00:03:10.709> comes<00:03:10.890> down<00:03:11.010> to<00:03:11.340> I<00:03:11.519> don't<00:03:11.910> want<00:03:12.150> to

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
what it comes down to I don't want to

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:13.970 
what it comes down to I don't want to
make<00:03:12.420> it<00:03:12.630> look<00:03:12.810> like<00:03:12.959> every<00:03:13.410> other<00:03:13.440> clarinet

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
make it look like every other clarinet

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.039 
make it look like every other clarinet
out<00:03:14.130> there<00:03:14.340> because<00:03:14.700> where's<00:03:15.600> the<00:03:15.750> fun<00:03:15.930> in

out there because where's the fun in
that

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
that

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.280 
that
so<00:03:18.030> we<00:03:18.150> decided<00:03:18.480> to<00:03:18.600> make<00:03:18.810> it<00:03:18.959> look<00:03:19.110> a<00:03:19.170> little

so we decided to make it look a little

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.289
