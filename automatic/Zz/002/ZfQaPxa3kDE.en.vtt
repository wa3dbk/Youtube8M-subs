it<00:01:49.520> ok<00:01:50.090> looking<00:01:50.419> to<00:01:50.569> the<00:01:50.659> future<00:01:51.049> with<00:01:51.079> it<00:01:51.349> it's

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
it ok looking to the future with it it's

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.609 
it ok looking to the future with it it's
is<00:01:52.219> this<00:01:52.490> an<00:01:52.639> exercise<00:01:53.179> in<00:01:53.479> styling<00:01:54.079> I<00:01:54.319> mean<00:01:54.439> it

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
is this an exercise in styling I mean it

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:56.769 
is this an exercise in styling I mean it
is<00:01:54.770> incredibly<00:01:55.399> styled<00:01:55.939> it's<00:01:56.060> beautiful<00:01:56.630> or

00:01:56.769 --> 00:01:56.779 
is incredibly styled it's beautiful or

00:01:56.779 --> 00:01:58.719 
is incredibly styled it's beautiful or
is<00:01:57.079> it<00:01:57.109> something<00:01:57.380> that<00:01:57.499> realistically<00:01:58.279> we

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
is it something that realistically we

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:00.699 
is it something that realistically we
very<00:01:58.999> met<00:01:59.299> well<00:01:59.539> may<00:01:59.749> see<00:01:59.810> this<00:02:00.200> on<00:02:00.409> the<00:02:00.439> roads

00:02:00.699 --> 00:02:00.709 
very met well may see this on the roads

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:04.749 
very met well may see this on the roads
well<00:02:01.609> from<00:02:02.060> the<00:02:03.049> design<00:02:03.349> characteristics<00:02:04.099> if

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
well from the design characteristics if

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:06.849 
well from the design characteristics if
you<00:02:04.909> take<00:02:05.119> for<00:02:05.299> example<00:02:05.359> the<00:02:05.689> exterior<00:02:06.289> style

00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:06.859 
you take for example the exterior style

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:11.080 
you take for example the exterior style
I<00:02:07.579> would<00:02:07.999> say<00:02:08.209> that<00:02:08.509> as<00:02:09.170> much<00:02:09.500> as<00:02:09.649> 80%<00:02:09.920> of<00:02:10.490> that

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
I would say that as much as 80% of that

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.340 
I would say that as much as 80% of that
will<00:02:11.450> come<00:02:11.480> out<00:02:11.750> in<00:02:11.870> production

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
will come out in production

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.000 
will come out in production
not<00:02:13.800> on<00:02:13.980> one<00:02:14.220> car<00:02:14.460> but<00:02:14.640> on<00:02:14.700> two<00:02:14.970> on<00:02:15.240> two<00:02:15.540> cars<00:02:16.010> so

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
not on one car but on two on two cars so

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.750 
not on one car but on two on two cars so
it<00:02:17.310> is<00:02:17.550> in<00:02:18.360> fact<00:02:18.690> very<00:02:18.870> much<00:02:19.130> showing<00:02:20.130> the<00:02:20.580> way

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
it is in fact very much showing the way

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.650 
it is in fact very much showing the way
that<00:02:21.060> we<00:02:21.240> are<00:02:21.510> going<00:02:22.350> in<00:02:22.620> the<00:02:23.130> upper<00:02:23.370> segment

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
that we are going in the upper segment

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.320 
that we are going in the upper segment
and<00:02:24.660> and<00:02:25.140> what<00:02:25.950> I'm<00:02:26.070> referring<00:02:26.250> to<00:02:26.520> is<00:02:26.640> you

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
and and what I'm referring to is you

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.720 
and and what I'm referring to is you
know<00:02:27.360> within<00:02:27.780> the<00:02:27.900> next<00:02:28.050> two<00:02:28.620> three<00:02:29.010> three

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
know within the next two three three

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.290 
know within the next two three three
years<00:02:29.970> so<00:02:30.330> it's<00:02:30.450> not<00:02:30.510> in<00:02:30.930> ten<00:02:31.260> years<00:02:31.350> time<00:02:32.300> it's

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
years so it's not in ten years time it's

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.450 
years so it's not in ten years time it's
shown<00:02:33.480> yes<00:02:33.900> the<00:02:34.530> turn<00:02:34.740> of<00:02:34.890> the<00:02:34.950> millennium<00:02:34.980> we

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
shown yes the turn of the millennium we

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.460 
shown yes the turn of the millennium we
could<00:02:35.610> be<00:02:35.760> seeing<00:02:35.970> something<00:02:36.300> like<00:02:36.630> this<00:02:36.840> do

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
could be seeing something like this do

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:38.930 
could be seeing something like this do
you<00:02:37.530> feel<00:02:37.590> that<00:02:37.980> you're<00:02:38.100> competing<00:02:38.430> anywhere

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
you feel that you're competing anywhere

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.000 
you feel that you're competing anywhere
with<00:02:39.150> the<00:02:39.270> likes<00:02:39.450> of<00:02:39.630> Mercedes<00:02:40.200> and<00:02:40.410> BMW<00:02:40.890> who

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
with the likes of Mercedes and BMW who

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.460 
with the likes of Mercedes and BMW who
are<00:02:41.160> very<00:02:41.340> very<00:02:42.180> classical<00:02:42.840> in<00:02:42.930> their<00:02:43.140> design

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
are very very classical in their design

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.500 
are very very classical in their design
and<00:02:43.770> you<00:02:44.460> feel<00:02:44.670> you<00:02:44.820> you<00:02:45.030> want<00:02:45.240> to<00:02:45.390> do

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
and you feel you you want to do

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.650 
and you feel you you want to do
something<00:02:45.840> very<00:02:45.870> different<00:02:46.310> well<00:02:47.310> as<00:02:47.520> a

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
something very different well as a

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.120 
something very different well as a
generalist<00:02:48.660> manufacturer<00:02:49.380> contrary<00:02:49.950> to

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
generalist manufacturer contrary to

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.220 
generalist manufacturer contrary to
let's<00:02:50.370> say<00:02:50.490> Mercedes<00:02:50.790> one<00:02:51.300> would<00:02:51.510> refer<00:02:51.930> to<00:02:51.960> as

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
let's say Mercedes one would refer to as

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.880 
let's say Mercedes one would refer to as
being<00:02:52.260> a<00:02:52.530> specialist<00:02:53.990> we<00:02:54.990> have<00:02:55.260> to<00:02:55.440> make<00:02:55.620> sure

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
being a specialist we have to make sure

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.360 
being a specialist we have to make sure
that<00:02:56.160> our<00:02:56.520> customers<00:02:57.240> will<00:02:57.630> buy<00:02:58.110> us<00:02:58.320> will<00:02:59.250> buy

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
that our customers will buy us will buy

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.450 
that our customers will buy us will buy
our<00:02:59.400> cars<00:02:59.850> and<00:03:00.180> if<00:03:00.750> if<00:03:01.140> they<00:03:01.500> buy<00:03:01.950> them<00:03:02.220> then

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:02.460 
our cars and if if they buy them then

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:05.240 
our cars and if if they buy them then
clearly<00:03:02.850> it's<00:03:03.090> not<00:03:03.180> by<00:03:03.540> doing<00:03:03.600> a<00:03:04.140> an<00:03:04.860> imitation

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
clearly it's not by doing a an imitation

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.800 
clearly it's not by doing a an imitation
of<00:03:05.430> a<00:03:05.520> Mercedes<00:03:05.940> or<00:03:06.060> an<00:03:06.150> imitation<00:03:06.420> of<00:03:06.570> a<00:03:06.660> BMW

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
of a Mercedes or an imitation of a BMW

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.250 
of a Mercedes or an imitation of a BMW
so<00:03:07.470> our<00:03:08.100> complete<00:03:08.640> strategy<00:03:09.540> is<00:03:09.750> based<00:03:10.080> upon

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
so our complete strategy is based upon

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.290 
so our complete strategy is based upon
offering<00:03:10.800> totally<00:03:11.700> different<00:03:12.000> products

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
offering totally different products

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.700 
offering totally different products
which<00:03:13.140> are<00:03:13.410> very<00:03:14.220> much<00:03:14.310> in<00:03:15.060> terms<00:03:15.270> of

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:15.710 
which are very much in terms of

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:19.100 
which are very much in terms of
inspiration<00:03:16.880> not<00:03:17.880> over-the-rhine<00:03:18.600> or<00:03:18.840> over

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
inspiration not over-the-rhine or over

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.140 
inspiration not over-the-rhine or over
the<00:03:19.200> channel<00:03:19.560> but<00:03:19.920> in<00:03:20.070> fact<00:03:20.340> very<00:03:20.550> French<00:03:20.940> in

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
the channel but in fact very French in

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.470 
the channel but in fact very French in
terms<00:03:21.600> of<00:03:21.720> approach<00:03:21.989> and<00:03:22.200> it's<00:03:23.190> not<00:03:23.489> in<00:03:24.360> a

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
terms of approach and it's not in a

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.690 
terms of approach and it's not in a
question<00:03:24.810> of<00:03:24.930> nationalism<00:03:25.470> it's<00:03:25.890> not<00:03:26.100> it's

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
question of nationalism it's not it's

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.460 
question of nationalism it's not it's
not<00:03:26.850> bad<00:03:27.060> it's<00:03:27.500> we<00:03:28.500> feel<00:03:28.770> that<00:03:29.720> as<00:03:30.720> a<00:03:30.780> European

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
not bad it's we feel that as a European

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.100 
not bad it's we feel that as a European
we<00:03:31.980> have<00:03:32.190> to<00:03:32.340> defend<00:03:32.670> Frenchness<00:03:33.510> in<00:03:33.840> the<00:03:33.930> same

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
we have to defend Frenchness in the same

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.110 
we have to defend Frenchness in the same
way<00:03:34.230> the<00:03:34.350> de<00:03:34.470> Gaulle<00:03:34.680> said<00:03:34.890> about<00:03:35.610> good<00:03:35.880> he

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
way the de Gaulle said about good he

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.660 
way the de Gaulle said about good he
said<00:03:36.360> you<00:03:36.900> know<00:03:37.080> good<00:03:37.709> was<00:03:37.980> so<00:03:38.310> much<00:03:38.489> of<00:03:38.610> a

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
said you know good was so much of a

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.400 
said you know good was so much of a
European<00:03:39.060> because<00:03:39.360> he<00:03:39.450> was<00:03:39.600> so<00:03:39.750> German<00:03:40.140> and<00:03:40.350> I

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
European because he was so German and I

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.440 
European because he was so German and I
think<00:03:40.680> that<00:03:40.830> our<00:03:41.010> cars<00:03:41.310> are<00:03:42.120> going<00:03:42.330> to<00:03:42.390> be

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
think that our cars are going to be

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.390 
think that our cars are going to be
desirable<00:03:42.900> if<00:03:43.140> we<00:03:43.380> offer<00:03:43.590> something<00:03:43.920> very

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
desirable if we offer something very

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.640 
desirable if we offer something very
different
