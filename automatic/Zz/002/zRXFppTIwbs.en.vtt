00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.820
 done well on how styles and modes 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.170
 on the moscow 5 and skyrim on mac 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.939
 if you have not seen my tutorial on 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.529
 how to crack skyrim on mac 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.779
 do not hesitate to watch it I put you 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.130
 nothing so a description for its all 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.320
 immediately after the installation of the modes 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.760
 kerim on mac then for those who do not 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.650
 do not know what modes they are 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.340
 improvements or additions in the 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.590
 game they are all finally almost all 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.879
 as much target on two sites the brotherhood 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.420
 translators so these are modes 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.190
 only french and skyrim nexus fashion 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.719
 so these are English modes but 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.149
 also french workers full of 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.590
 languages â€‹â€‹but me for a little trick 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.570
 I advise you to download this 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.270
 mega file with all modes 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.039
 that I installed on my on this crime 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.199
 but beware some modes do not work 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.640
 not for the good and simple reason that 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.920
 the cracked version of screen is a 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.539
 old version all modes and have 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.220
 been created for recent versions of 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.650
 skyrim we can not walk on 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.470
 this live on what so I put you 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.170
 this link for all modes on in the 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.460
 description sorry but you can that 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.659
 these are rare item files and 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.450
 could open to the needs of the 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.939
 software on official mac do that is that 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.560
 thus had only to you but once 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.119
 times the link in the description and so 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.530
 we will see immediately how 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.850
 install his modes so I take the 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.850
 all stupid as the mario weapons that 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.340
 are weapons that this epic novel so 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.900
 opened this mode through dock so you k 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.270
 double click on it and go often 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.490
 all thanks to the issiaka be you 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.829
 will give a folder in this folder 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.320
 will appear so see two versions 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.970
 different me I think older 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.829
 so here you see you will have a 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.930
 file for the aspect a file a 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:51.869
 folder me shit it's a folder a 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.700
 folder during texture so this shot of 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.040
 iron ended up the folder where figure 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.490
 your game so right click on it 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:02.130
 shows the contents of the package contains 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:04.979
 gaming water resources sidwaya program 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.869
 files sanders kroes and so yes you 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.869
 have a dat file advertised in there 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.760
 that will fall your patterns so you 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.379
 true and so has 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.200
 you see that you only have these 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:17.549
 a few packages of files but if 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.170
 you haunt a lot of fashion than me 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:21.180
 believe me it'll stay like this 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.310
 a long time so you just take 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.129
 these two records including qmi cheese and 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.019
 textures because they are not yes they do not 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:30.870
 are not yet present in this folder 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:33.840
 you take it both of them you put them 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.220
 in the folder and then you take 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.629
 the file goes the wafd 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.980
 here you win any good voice jury 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:41.549
 you click on it you press the 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.280
 entrance key 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:46.230
 it's going to open the man to change title 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.659
 you have these controls or copy 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.659
 paste you close then you go back 

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:54.030
 back to sessions and user profile 

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:56.760
 the casting applications of tasci grimm 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.549
 and where you have an empty folder so you 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.500
 want what by so you have to do 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:03.980
 it's open a text editor like 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.480
 text says for example so open it 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.389
 marked in the first place what rhymes 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.690
 point e only voice because otherwise the game not 

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:14.430
 market finally a fashion so not walk 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.239
 then very important to convert it to 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.379
 text format 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:18.750
 so here to give something like 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:20.340
 this then jean from below you 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.799
 simply mark badly with the drizzles 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.349
 so the the title of the mode you have 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:29.040
 installed you save you send it 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:31.769
 so in eight little tricks we 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:36.209
 the recorded on the desktop so you 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:38.849
 put you put text here in time 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:40.970
 I forgot the name of the file it takes 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:44.609
 put so I'm going to look directly 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:47.269
 in my own game skyrim d2 for this 

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:47.269
 little bug 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:04:00.180
 so here you put plugin will do 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:04:01.739
 too much plugin name so here you are 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:05.010
 please make sure it's a format 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:07.019
 txt sim and an rtf or windows format or 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.069
 anything is not going to work so 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:10.949
 wanted to record 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:12.120
 we will make you an application so there 

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:14.099
 you see that there is on the desk so 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:17.190
 you take it you put it in your 

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:18.780
 record so in your record of this 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.329
 crime that was inside 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.099
 same software and therefore there is your 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:24.680
 fashion is a style I did not launch the 

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:26.630
 game because that 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.850
 spitting my recording but 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.620
 yeah that's as simple as that 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:33.169
 little recap you have in the 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:35.720
 data folder and so you copy everything 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:37.750
 just the point respect file that 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.440
 you have found in your mode 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.180
 then when I have two new 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.620
 texture files you open it and you 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.570
 so do not worry about it and propose 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.729
 a folder while you put it in 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:48.680
 texture if you have a texture folder 

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:51.530
 interview kheyari qods like you 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:53.630
 fight in it and then so you 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:55.580
 select hop it's copy paste 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:58.580
 you go back illzach 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:00.590
 profile not you here so you arrive 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.599
 on this file you just created 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:05.030
 do not forget and add everything 

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:07.099
 simply add it all 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:08.990
 simply the title of your fashion by 

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:10.250
 against if you type by hand and that 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:12.470
 you make that you do not do a 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:14.479
 copy-and-paste is very careful that this 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:15.740
 Press the character really is there to 

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:17.870
 a capital letter that is not present in 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:20.750
 the title make it spit your game and 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:22.160
 the mode will not work that's so it's 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:23.599
 everything for this little tutorial do not hesitate to 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.370
 ask me if you have any questions 

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:27.590
 on how to install certain modes 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:27.889
 graphics or sound or anything 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:30.380
 else 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:31.370
 and that's it and everyone thinks about 

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:31.760
 will have to meet up for a next 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:34.270
 video 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:34.270
