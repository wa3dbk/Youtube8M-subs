00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.940
 we had a difficult match Krasnodar 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:17.449
 where the word defended well but 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:21.890
 conducted a quick attack and three such 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:25.080
 sharp attacks at our gates delivered us 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:32.910
 a lot of problems where once 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:35.850
 goalkeeper picked the ball 2 2 players kick 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.610
 words on we hit the target 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.879
 but these blows were very very dangerous 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:45.180
 the two ball margin that we have 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:48.059
 says nothing because we 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:52.829
 expect here against glory from 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.190
 words on very persistent very serious 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.050
 the game 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:59.480
 so we are very tuned to this 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:04.170
 duel 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:08.250
 first of all we want to show a good game 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:10.590
 and of course the result I would like 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.170
 ask as a coach like captain 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.090
 teams 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:17.520
 which players are from broken 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.479
 half the biggest 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.880
 the threat 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:25.950
 but if you take on the game in Krasnodar 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:33.390
 of course 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:38.310
 very sharply acted coil and very 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:40.890
 well played the gate i could but overall i 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:44.100
 already noted that the team is enough 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:51.450
 even very organized therefore 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:56.119
 you can expect good from any player 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:59.700
 games are therefore tuned to the whole team 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:01.619
 rival asus about war is cool how are we 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.720
 saw in Krasnodar the words he plays 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.420
 very compactly protected by the whole team 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.759
 and use counterattacks I think captain 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.890
 pressed rival milinkevich represents 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.690
 for us the greatest threat is it is dangerous when 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.790
 standards and can render good 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.430
 the final pass therefore against him 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.260
 need to play very carefully we have 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.569
 a good backlog of 20 after a home meeting 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.709
 and came to our bratislava 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.709
 football fight for victory
