00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.500
 guide how to play on each map the 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:10.330
 scheme looks like this I can not I know 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.710

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:23.110
 another lovato and I do not get everything without bullets but 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.149
 took out the second area to catch before the 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.799
 soil changes it is advice and always 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:29.110
 change what you can your high school 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:31.179
 for a main weapon of the serum is worth 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.909

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.549
 to see if it came not because it was what 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:45.399

 to 620 and the play's gunner because the 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.570
 690 because because in this map really 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:01.050
 it's very good to make an open map you can 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:04.619
 swelled to kill 230 batches with him 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:06.479

 sitito where you can put you throw 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.070

 saying it was the best streak and what 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.060
 explained and compared it to the 630 and 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.610
 well here you see that I start spending 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:59.370
 quite but maybe it's not the game 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:01.230

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.180

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.610
 there and there you see one shooting at me 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.890
 trying to tear down I do that 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:10.610
 it could have been a better game 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:14.270
 but hey it 's pretty good 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:17.760
 and as I say it has the drawers on top 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:19.740
