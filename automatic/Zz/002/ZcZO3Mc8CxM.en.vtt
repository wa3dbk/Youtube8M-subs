00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.960
 if I am very excited about any 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.400

 repaint the wall and say you stayed there for 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.569
 which is neither blue 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.209

 not to eat everything I want 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.889
 It has days that are easier, but it has 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:38.569
 Days that I'm crazy to make a 

00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:40.879

 I already had a belly button piercing 

00:02:59.719 --> 00:03:04.969
 When I did I tried to get in 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:07.069
 federal university I entered arrived at 

00:03:04.969 --> 00:03:08.989
 to study journalism but in the first year 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:09.590
 that I did I did not pass I went too far 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.840
 happy 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.680
 and then I went and put the piercing just for 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.650
 rage 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.599
 one day my world for years the hole 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.109
 is practically closed although it is still 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:23.870
 have a sign of him and tattoo 

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:26.389
 let's say I Andrew balances me 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:29.479
 because he has none he has 1 billion 

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:33.199
 With your horita strength I love Daisy 

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:36.079
 I love that white with 6 yellow or 

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:38.840
 then that girl is daisy name 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:41.689
 I know, but I think so. 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.549
 Tom's market was when small what 

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:46.759
 You wanted to be when you grew up well. 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:49.819
 first I started wanting to be a singer 

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:51.259
 I later wanted to be a model after I 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:53.150
 I wanted to be an actress. 

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:57.470
 In the middle of it all I wanted to be an actress. 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:59.569
 open up a mess but it was something in this 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:02.209
 kind of what you keep under the bed 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:06.880
 people kept all the mess 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:10.750
 possible to see in the air at a 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:13.270
 today is my bed is those chest and 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:15.670
 so inside I use space to store 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:16.750
 you consider yourself organized or 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:20.709
 mischievous 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:23.850
 This one is hard, I like to keep 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:27.250
 things organized but at the same time 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:30.400
 if you open my closet in the clothes 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:32.140
 My wardrobe is always a mess. 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.360
 there is one thing that never was 

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:36.370
 never organized is not possible in the 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:39.100
 practice is is beyond my capabilities 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:41.800
 if you could see anywhere in the 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:43.780
 world where it would be I think it would be 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.750
 united states for being a place I 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:49.840
 I think I believe things work 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:52.540
 there and this is very different unfortunately 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.250
 Brazil is a mess that is a 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:54.940
 color well corruption has all that is 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:57.160
 corner 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:58.780
 I find things very complicated by 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:02.800
 here we are going to hope for Brazil to improve 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:04.480
 but I have a hard time staying 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.250
 away from my family I 'm already far away 

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:08.470
 of those mobile in the great south and dwells 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:11.170
 in São Paulo so if I could 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:13.350
 so choosing the ideal situation would be 

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:16.450
 to be close to my family 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:19.180
 no matter where your movie is 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:21.550
 Favorite oil of a passion I think 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:30.640
 What is this diary of a passion is beautiful 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:33.070
 It's wonderful to me, it's a story. 

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:38.380
 A love story is a story that 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:39.880
 I dream of having the end he is 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:42.400
 that I do not tell you that not only 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:45.040
 spoiler spoiler of the story of the cry 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:50.760

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:59.040

 I remember but they always say that I 

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:13.150
 look like her and I think so funny 

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:14.979
 because the cold and the staff there but everything 

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:17.490
 well, I do not like anything, I do not like it either. 

00:06:14.979 --> 00:06:17.490
 would be 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:21.750
 no problem 

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:22.710

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:24.150
