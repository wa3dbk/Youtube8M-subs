than I have to evolve
I<00:01:34.360> know<00:01:34.870> that<00:01:35.380> they<00:01:35.530> must<00:01:35.740> have<00:01:35.920> evolved<00:01:36.460> in

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:36.550 
I know that they must have evolved in

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.860 
I know that they must have evolved in
ways<00:01:36.820> that<00:01:37.150> we<00:01:37.600> have<00:01:37.750> yet<00:01:38.050> to<00:01:38.260> understand<00:01:38.980> in
