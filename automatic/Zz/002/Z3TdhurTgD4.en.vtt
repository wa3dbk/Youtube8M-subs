can<00:01:27.540> buy<00:01:27.630> them<00:01:27.750> separately<00:01:27.990> or<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:28.320> can<00:01:28.500> buy

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
can buy them separately or you can buy

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.380 
can buy them separately or you can buy
in<00:01:28.680> a<00:01:28.740> minute<00:01:29.040> of<00:01:29.250> course<00:01:29.460> I<00:01:29.610> got<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.909> set<00:01:30.119> and

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.679 
they're super cheap and so these one is
like<00:01:51.540> a<00:01:51.570> stippling<00:01:52.079> brush

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:55.689 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:59.249 

the<00:01:56.049> other<00:01:56.290> is<00:01:56.680> kind<00:01:57.040> of<00:01:57.159> like<00:01:57.340> a<00:01:58.259> slightly

00:01:59.249 --> 00:01:59.259 
the other is kind of like a slightly

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:03.270 
the other is kind of like a slightly
angled<00:02:00.150> brush<00:02:01.200> these<00:02:02.200> brushes<00:02:02.590> didn't<00:02:03.100> really

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
angled brush these brushes didn't really

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.039 
angled brush these brushes didn't really
have<00:02:03.399> a<00:02:03.430> description<00:02:04.000> like<00:02:04.240> of<00:02:04.450> what<00:02:04.810> they<00:02:04.990> do

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:05.049 
have a description like of what they do

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:08.010 
have a description like of what they do
or<00:02:05.619> what<00:02:05.770> they<00:02:05.920> are<00:02:06.299> so<00:02:07.299> I<00:02:07.330> kind<00:02:07.600> of<00:02:07.689> just<00:02:07.840> use

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
or what they are so I kind of just use

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.440 
or what they are so I kind of just use
them<00:02:08.200> for<00:02:08.229> my<00:02:08.500> own<00:02:08.970> purposes<00:02:09.970> here's<00:02:10.300> the

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
them for my own purposes here's the

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:10.830 
them for my own purposes here's the
third<00:02:10.630> one

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
third one

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:16.380 
third one
it's<00:02:11.709> kind<00:02:12.069> of<00:02:12.280> domed<00:02:12.940> and<00:02:14.880> then<00:02:15.880> here's<00:02:16.150> one

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
it's kind of domed and then here's one

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:24.330 
it's kind of domed and then here's one
like<00:02:16.569> this<00:02:22.620> except<00:02:23.620> this<00:02:23.709> one<00:02:23.920> has<00:02:24.069> like

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
like this except this one has like

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.059 
like this except this one has like
longer<00:02:24.700> bristles<00:02:25.030> than<00:02:25.330> this<00:02:25.510> one<00:02:25.890> so<00:02:26.890> they're

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
longer bristles than this one so they're

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:30.660 
longer bristles than this one so they're
kind<00:02:27.280> of<00:02:27.340> similar<00:02:27.550> oh<00:02:28.950> and<00:02:29.950> this<00:02:30.069> is<00:02:30.130> the<00:02:30.280> domed

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
kind of similar oh and this is the domed

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.009 
kind of similar oh and this is the domed
one<00:02:30.970> I<00:02:31.150> mean<00:02:31.360> um

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:32.019 
one I mean um

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:34.050 
one I mean um
the<00:02:32.230> angled<00:02:32.590> one<00:02:32.769> this<00:02:33.100> is<00:02:33.280> the<00:02:33.400> angled<00:02:33.760> brush

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
the angled one this is the angled brush

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:43.970 
the angled one this is the angled brush
I<00:02:35.489> think<00:02:36.489> the<00:02:36.610> other<00:02:36.760> one<00:02:36.970> was<00:02:37.180> just<00:02:37.290> flat<00:02:42.600> um

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
I think the other one was just flat um

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.250 
I think the other one was just flat um
see<00:02:44.980> I<00:02:45.069> really<00:02:45.340> quickly<00:02:45.700> wanted<00:02:46.000> to<00:02:46.120> say<00:02:46.330> so<00:02:47.049> as

when<00:03:05.470> I<00:03:05.500> wash<00:03:05.769> them<00:03:05.950> there's<00:03:06.160> a<00:03:06.220> like<00:03:06.430> weird

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
when I wash them there's a like weird

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.030 
when I wash them there's a like weird
color<00:03:07.000> that<00:03:07.209> comes<00:03:07.390> off<00:03:07.630> and<00:03:07.959> so<00:03:08.620> I<00:03:08.829> was<00:03:09.010> just

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
color that comes off and so I was just

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.009 
color that comes off and so I was just
really<00:03:09.370> surprised<00:03:09.820> I'm<00:03:10.420> not<00:03:10.480> saying<00:03:10.870> these

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
really surprised I'm not saying these

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:12.960 
really surprised I'm not saying these
are<00:03:11.200> due<00:03:11.380> for<00:03:11.560> real<00:03:11.709> techniques<00:03:12.100> these<00:03:12.730> don't

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
are due for real techniques these don't

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:14.400 
are due for real techniques these don't
claim<00:03:13.120> to<00:03:13.180> be<00:03:13.329> real<00:03:13.540> techniques<00:03:13.930> they<00:03:14.140> look

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
claim to be real techniques they look

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.349 
claim to be real techniques they look
like<00:03:14.590> real<00:03:14.769> techniques<00:03:15.160> but<00:03:15.880> none<00:03:16.150> of<00:03:16.180> these

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:16.359 
like real techniques but none of these

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:18.120 
like real techniques but none of these
brushes<00:03:16.750> are<00:03:17.200> like<00:03:17.739> the<00:03:17.980> Real<00:03:18.100> Techniques

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130

brushes are like the Real Techniques
brushes<00:03:18.790> none<00:03:19.180> like<00:03:19.420> I<00:03:19.720> think<00:03:20.109> the<00:03:20.410> closest

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
brushes none like I think the closest

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:23.970

one<00:03:21.040> to<00:03:21.160> my<00:03:21.280> Real<00:03:21.459> Techniques<00:03:22.650> buffing<00:03:23.650> brush

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
one to my Real Techniques buffing brush

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.640 
one to my Real Techniques buffing brush
is<00:03:24.370> this<00:03:25.120> one<00:03:25.299> right<00:03:25.450> here<00:03:25.690> but<00:03:26.230> this<00:03:26.320> one<00:03:26.530> is

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
is this one right here but this one is

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.880 
is this one right here but this one is
flat<00:03:26.920> top<00:03:27.160> rather<00:03:27.549> than<00:03:27.700> this<00:03:28.420> one<00:03:28.690> so<00:03:29.140> they

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
flat top rather than this one so they

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.550 
flat top rather than this one so they
are<00:03:30.070> different<00:03:30.480> like<00:03:31.480> this<00:03:31.840> one<00:03:32.049> here<00:03:32.380> the
