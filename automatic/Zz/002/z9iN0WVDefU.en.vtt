that<00:00:37.590> one<00:00:37.800> it<00:00:38.070> seems<00:00:38.460> like<00:00:38.640> you<00:00:38.790> turn<00:00:39.000> to<00:00:39.120> get

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
that one it seems like you turn to get

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.049 
that one it seems like you turn to get
about<00:00:39.420> halfway<00:00:39.690> through<00:00:39.960> its<00:00:40.640> twist<00:00:41.640> and<00:00:41.969> it

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
about halfway through its twist and it

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:42.920 
about halfway through its twist and it
doesn't<00:00:42.329> do<00:00:42.420> nothing

doesn't do nothing
so<00:00:43.579> guess<00:00:44.579> that<00:00:44.850> was<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.000> shot<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:45.989> then<00:00:47.030> if

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
so guess that was the shot and then if

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.910 
so guess that was the shot and then if
