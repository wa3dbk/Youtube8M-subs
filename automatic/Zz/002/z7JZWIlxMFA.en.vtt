00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 Radiation is coming from the WiFi iPad 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 Turn on the measuring instrument 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
 I turned on WiFi on my iPad 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.000
 Immediately radiates pulse and microwave 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.750
 There is no WiFi router and it is an iPad (radio wave) signal 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 The radiation level has exceeded the instrument's maximum limit of 6 V / m 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:44.000
 Peak radiation is several times higher than the active iPhone 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.250
 Strong radiation continues for several hours a day 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.000
 I will try to play a game 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.000
 The microwave pulse can not stop ... 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.750
 I'm not connected to the net 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.000
 Because WiFi is turned on! 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 Turn off WiFi 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.000
 There is no more intense radiation 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.666
 What is the safe level? 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.000
 The detection threshold of this instrument is 0.02 V / m (the standard value for Salzburg) 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 Reviewed research has biological effects-genetic changes occur at 0.00006 V / m 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:21.000
 Recommendation of the European Parliament: Keep as low as reasonably achievable (exposure dose) (ALARA principle) 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.750
 Protect the brain and body from radiation cell damage 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.500
