push it in to the teeth of the puff puff
and<00:02:04.219> that<00:02:05.219> will<00:02:05.460> secure<00:02:05.820> it<00:02:06.000> this<00:02:06.930> way<00:02:07.200> is

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
and that will secure it this way is

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.190 
and that will secure it this way is
quicker<00:02:07.770> and<00:02:08.340> you<00:02:09.000> don't<00:02:09.270> need<00:02:09.450> any<00:02:09.599> hairpin

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
quicker and you don't need any hairpin

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.160 
quicker and you don't need any hairpin
so<00:02:10.619> it's<00:02:10.739> a<00:02:10.830> nice<00:02:10.950> way<00:02:11.009> to<00:02:11.220> do<00:02:11.489> it<00:02:11.670> but<00:02:12.020> if<00:02:13.020> you

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
so it's a nice way to do it but if you

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.530 
so it's a nice way to do it but if you
don't<00:02:13.290> have

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
don't have

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.080 
don't have
really<00:02:13.750> long<00:02:13.959> thick<00:02:14.349> hair<00:02:14.379> then<00:02:15.069> you'll<00:02:15.879> get<00:02:16.030> a

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
really long thick hair then you'll get a

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.940 
really long thick hair then you'll get a
flatter<00:02:16.569> bun<00:02:16.989> because<00:02:17.290> it's<00:02:17.560> taking<00:02:17.859> the

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
flatter bun because it's taking the

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.500 
flatter bun because it's taking the
shape<00:02:18.159> of<00:02:18.370> the<00:02:18.489> puff<00:02:18.700> Cup<00:02:18.909> but<00:02:19.090> if<00:02:19.209> you<00:02:19.299> have

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
shape of the puff Cup but if you have

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.349 
shape of the puff Cup but if you have
thick<00:02:19.780> long<00:02:20.019> hair<00:02:20.049> you<00:02:20.409> can<00:02:20.560> kind<00:02:20.859> of<00:02:20.920> create

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:21.359 
thick long hair you can kind of create

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:24.720 
thick long hair you can kind of create
more<00:02:22.359> rounded<00:02:22.959> shape<00:02:23.310> but<00:02:24.310> with<00:02:24.400> the<00:02:24.549> left

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
more rounded shape but with the left

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.420 
more rounded shape but with the left
upper<00:02:24.969> hair<00:02:25.239> I<00:02:25.510> don't<00:02:25.989> typically<00:02:26.829> do<00:02:27.099> the<00:02:27.250> bun

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
upper hair I don't typically do the bun

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.020 
upper hair I don't typically do the bun
this<00:02:27.640> way<00:02:27.879> I<00:02:29.040> usually<00:02:30.040> separate<00:02:30.609> it<00:02:30.730> out<00:02:30.819> in<00:02:30.970> a

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
this way I usually separate it out in a

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.259 
this way I usually separate it out in a
circle<00:02:31.239> the<00:02:31.540> same<00:02:31.750> way<00:02:32.019> and<00:02:32.609> I<00:02:33.609> start<00:02:33.970> from<00:02:34.150> the

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:34.269 
circle the same way and I start from the

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:35.880 
circle the same way and I start from the
back<00:02:34.450> and<00:02:34.510> pull<00:02:34.840> it<00:02:35.170> a<00:02:35.230> little<00:02:35.260> bit<00:02:35.620> just<00:02:35.769> to

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
back and pull it a little bit just to

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.199 
back and pull it a little bit just to
get<00:02:36.010> it<00:02:36.129> started<00:02:36.579> and<00:02:38.280> I<00:02:39.280> start<00:02:39.549> twisting<00:02:40.090> it

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
get it started and I start twisting it

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:45.629 
get it started and I start twisting it
and<00:02:40.920> I'm<00:02:41.920> twisting<00:02:42.370> it<00:02:42.459> in<00:02:42.609> a<00:02:42.700> circle<00:02:43.170> and<00:02:44.459> as<00:02:45.459> I

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:45.639 
and I'm twisting it in a circle and as I

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:53.629 
and I'm twisting it in a circle and as I
twist<00:02:45.700> it<00:02:46.530> I'll<00:02:47.530> secure<00:02:48.069> it<00:02:48.129> with<00:02:48.430> bobby<00:02:48.489> pins

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:53.639 

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:58.199 

and<00:02:54.639> I<00:02:54.909> use<00:02:55.209> bobby<00:02:55.540> pins<00:02:56.730> because<00:02:57.730> I've<00:02:58.030> tried

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
and I use bobby pins because I've tried

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:00.720 
and I use bobby pins because I've tried
hair<00:02:58.720> pins<00:02:59.049> and<00:02:59.590> when<00:02:59.950> your<00:03:00.069> hair<00:03:00.340> is<00:03:00.370> this

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
hair pins and when your hair is this

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.569 
hair pins and when your hair is this
thick<00:03:01.139> the<00:03:02.139> hair<00:03:02.349> pins<00:03:02.620> will<00:03:03.010> come<00:03:03.220> right<00:03:03.549> on

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:03.579 
thick the hair pins will come right on

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:08.940 
thick the hair pins will come right on
out<00:03:04.769> so<00:03:05.769> I<00:03:06.900> typically<00:03:07.900> use<00:03:08.019> the<00:03:08.470> bobby<00:03:08.650> pins

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
out so I typically use the bobby pins

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.460 
out so I typically use the bobby pins
and<00:03:09.129> they're<00:03:09.250> just<00:03:09.459> one<00:03:09.760> and<00:03:10.470> three-quarter

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
and they're just one and three-quarter

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.670 
and they're just one and three-quarter
inch<00:03:11.620> bobby<00:03:11.889> pins<00:03:12.840> if<00:03:13.840> you<00:03:13.930> have<00:03:14.079> older<00:03:14.470> bobby

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
inch bobby pins if you have older bobby

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.229 
inch bobby pins if you have older bobby
pins<00:03:15.810> where<00:03:16.810> the<00:03:17.439> bold<00:03:17.739> tips<00:03:18.280> are<00:03:18.729> no<00:03:18.909> longer

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
pins where the bold tips are no longer

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:22.710 
pins where the bold tips are no longer
on<00:03:19.840> the<00:03:20.049> pins<00:03:20.739> and<00:03:21.699> you<00:03:21.819> just<00:03:22.000> have<00:03:22.209> exposed

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
on the pins and you just have exposed

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.339 
on the pins and you just have exposed
metal<00:03:24.120> then<00:03:25.120> I<00:03:25.150> suggest<00:03:25.659> you<00:03:25.959> throw<00:03:26.109> those

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:26.349 
metal then I suggest you throw those

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:28.559 
metal then I suggest you throw those
away<00:03:26.379> because<00:03:27.129> those<00:03:27.340> tend<00:03:27.729> to<00:03:27.909> pull<00:03:28.389> your

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:28.569 
away because those tend to pull your

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:32.550 
away because those tend to pull your
hair<00:03:28.780> out<00:03:30.180> now<00:03:31.180> I<00:03:31.239> you<00:03:31.900> know<00:03:31.989> I<00:03:32.019> mentioned<00:03:32.319> her

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
hair out now I you know I mentioned her

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.909 
hair out now I you know I mentioned her
hair<00:03:32.769> is<00:03:32.889> dry<00:03:33.299> it's<00:03:34.299> also<00:03:34.599> somebody<00:03:35.109> tangled

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:35.919 
hair is dry it's also somebody tangled

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:40.500 
hair is dry it's also somebody tangled
and<00:03:36.250> it<00:03:36.879> stretched<00:03:37.449> because<00:03:37.870> I<00:03:38.049> recently<00:03:39.510> took

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
and it stretched because I recently took

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.379 
and it stretched because I recently took
out<00:03:40.659> her<00:03:40.810> box<00:03:41.049> braids<00:03:41.459> and<00:03:42.459> so<00:03:42.669> usually<00:03:43.180> when<00:03:43.329> I

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:43.389 
out her box braids and so usually when I

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:45.240 
out her box braids and so usually when I
take<00:03:43.569> out<00:03:43.690> my<00:03:43.750> box<00:03:44.079> braids<00:03:44.440> or<00:03:44.530> her<00:03:44.709> cornrows

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
take out my box braids or her cornrows

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.119 
take out my box braids or her cornrows
I'm<00:03:45.609> in<00:03:45.760> a<00:03:45.790> rush<00:03:46.209> to<00:03:46.930> get<00:03:47.109> washed<00:03:47.440> because<00:03:47.859> it's

00:03:48.119 --> 00:03:48.129 
I'm in a rush to get washed because it's

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:50.189 
I'm in a rush to get washed because it's
been<00:03:48.310> in<00:03:48.519> grades<00:03:48.879> for<00:03:49.359> a<00:03:49.389> while<00:03:49.629> and<00:03:50.079> I<00:03:50.169> feel

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:50.199 
been in grades for a while and I feel

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:52.979 
been in grades for a while and I feel
like<00:03:50.530> it<00:03:50.680> needs<00:03:50.709> a<00:03:50.949> good<00:03:51.069> wash<00:03:51.449> but<00:03:52.449> this<00:03:52.720> time

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
like it needs a good wash but this time

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:55.259 
like it needs a good wash but this time
I<00:03:53.409> said<00:03:54.220> you<00:03:54.519> know<00:03:54.639> what<00:03:54.790> let<00:03:55.000> me<00:03:55.090> take

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269 
I said you know what let me take

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:58.140 
I said you know what let me take
advantage<00:03:55.810> of<00:03:56.019> this<00:03:56.470> stretch<00:03:57.220> the<00:03:57.669> tangled

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
advantage of this stretch the tangled

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:03.110 
advantage of this stretch the tangled
hair<00:03:58.449> and<00:04:00.120> do<00:04:01.120> something<00:04:01.389> different<00:04:01.780> I

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
hair and do something different I

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.990 
hair and do something different I
mentioned<00:04:04.120> she<00:04:04.359> is<00:04:04.720> tender-headed<00:04:06.000> we're

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
mentioned she is tender-headed we're

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.409 
mentioned she is tender-headed we're
making<00:04:07.239> a<00:04:07.299> didn't<00:04:08.759> which<00:04:09.759> is<00:04:09.790> why<00:04:09.909> I<00:04:10.060> used<00:04:10.299> the

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:10.419 
making a didn't which is why I used the

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:11.819 
making a didn't which is why I used the
baby<00:04:10.599> brush<00:04:10.930> because<00:04:11.079> it<00:04:11.229> has<00:04:11.319> the<00:04:11.439> softer

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:11.829 
baby brush because it has the softer

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:14.909 
baby brush because it has the softer
bristles<00:04:12.280> as<00:04:12.909> opposed<00:04:13.329> to<00:04:13.479> a<00:04:14.229> brush<00:04:14.739> but

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:14.919 
bristles as opposed to a brush but

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:17.240 
bristles as opposed to a brush but
harder<00:04:15.189> bristles<00:04:15.549> that<00:04:15.639> will<00:04:15.790> flatter

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
harder bristles that will flatter

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:18.560 
harder bristles that will flatter
but<00:04:17.520> because<00:04:17.790> she's<00:04:17.970> tender-headed<00:04:18.330> she's

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
but because she's tender-headed she's

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.870 
but because she's tender-headed she's
not<00:04:18.720> a<00:04:18.750> big<00:04:18.930> fan<00:04:19.110> of<00:04:19.140> cornrows<00:04:19.920> so<00:04:20.460> this<00:04:20.700> is<00:04:20.850> a

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
not a big fan of cornrows so this is a

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.850 
not a big fan of cornrows so this is a
nice<00:04:21.090> alternative<00:04:21.300> so<00:04:22.170> once<00:04:22.350> I<00:04:22.440> get<00:04:22.620> to<00:04:22.740> the

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
nice alternative so once I get to the

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.150 
nice alternative so once I get to the
end<00:04:23.010> I<00:04:23.460> twist<00:04:24.150> it<00:04:24.300> tight<00:04:24.630> and<00:04:25.200> then<00:04:25.740> I<00:04:25.830> take

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
end I twist it tight and then I take

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.140 
end I twist it tight and then I take
that<00:04:26.190> hair<00:04:26.610> and<00:04:26.790> I<00:04:26.880> tuck<00:04:27.270> it<00:04:27.480> in<00:04:27.980> to<00:04:28.980> the<00:04:29.910> hair

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
that hair and I tuck it in to the hair

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.720 
that hair and I tuck it in to the hair
that<00:04:30.360> I<00:04:30.390> initially<00:04:30.690> started<00:04:31.020> twisting<00:04:31.740> and

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:32.730 
that I initially started twisting and

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:36.950 
that I initially started twisting and
then<00:04:32.760> I'll<00:04:32.940> pin<00:04:33.180> that<00:04:34.490> and<00:04:35.490> what<00:04:36.060> that<00:04:36.270> does<00:04:36.540> it

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
then I'll pin that and what that does it

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.100 
then I'll pin that and what that does it
conceals<00:04:37.470> the<00:04:37.710> end<00:04:37.860> of<00:04:38.070> the<00:04:38.160> hair<00:04:38.370> obviously

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
conceals the end of the hair obviously

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.440 
conceals the end of the hair obviously
but<00:04:40.110> it<00:04:40.200> also<00:04:40.380> helps<00:04:41.040> to<00:04:41.130> create<00:04:41.670> a<00:04:42.060> more

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:42.450 
but it also helps to create a more

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:48.530 
but it also helps to create a more
consistent<00:04:43.550> shape<00:04:46.010> and<00:04:47.010> I<00:04:47.460> typically<00:04:48.240> start

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:48.540 
consistent shape and I typically start

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:52.370 
consistent shape and I typically start
at<00:04:48.630> the<00:04:48.780> back<00:04:49.380> of<00:04:49.830> her<00:04:50.310> head<00:04:50.700> because<00:04:51.140> if<00:04:52.140> there

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
at the back of her head because if there

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:56.090 
at the back of her head because if there
is<00:04:52.620> any<00:04:52.920> difference<00:04:53.190> in<00:04:53.580> the<00:04:53.910> volume<00:04:54.570> of<00:04:55.100> what

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100 
is any difference in the volume of what

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.820 
is any difference in the volume of what
I<00:04:56.130> started<00:04:56.760> the<00:04:57.420> twist<00:04:57.780> and<00:04:58.080> where<00:04:58.290> I<00:04:58.320> ended<00:04:58.800> it

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:58.830 
I started the twist and where I ended it

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.130 
I started the twist and where I ended it
it's<00:04:59.640> easier<00:05:00.060> to<00:05:00.180> conceal<00:05:00.570> it<00:05:00.720> if<00:05:00.810> it's<00:05:00.960> in<00:05:01.050> the

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:01.140 
it's easier to conceal it if it's in the

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.110 
it's easier to conceal it if it's in the
back<00:05:01.320> get<00:05:01.740> this<00:05:01.860> in<00:05:02.010> the<00:05:02.070> front<00:05:02.370> it's<00:05:02.670> a<00:05:02.850> little

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 
back get this in the front it's a little

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.250 
back get this in the front it's a little
bit<00:05:03.240> more<00:05:03.450> obvious<00:05:04.070> so<00:05:05.090> that's<00:05:06.090> why<00:05:06.300> I<00:05:06.690> start

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:07.260 
bit more obvious so that's why I start

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.050 
bit more obvious so that's why I start
in<00:05:07.320> the<00:05:07.380> back<00:05:07.530> and<00:05:07.580> you'll<00:05:08.580> notice<00:05:08.820> I'm

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 
in the back and you'll notice I'm

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:10.760 
in the back and you'll notice I'm
putting<00:05:09.240> it<00:05:09.480> in<00:05:09.540> quite<00:05:09.840> a<00:05:09.870> bit<00:05:10.110> of<00:05:10.200> pins<00:05:10.470> and

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
putting it in quite a bit of pins and

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:12.740 
putting it in quite a bit of pins and
it's<00:05:10.890> because<00:05:11.160> she's<00:05:11.340> a<00:05:11.400> kid<00:05:11.670> she<00:05:12.450> likes<00:05:12.630> to

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 
it's because she's a kid she likes to

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.810 
it's because she's a kid she likes to
run<00:05:12.840> around<00:05:12.900> I<00:05:13.470> want<00:05:14.010> to<00:05:14.100> make<00:05:14.220> sure<00:05:14.250> it's

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:14.820 
run around I want to make sure it's

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:21.050 
run around I want to make sure it's
secure<00:05:15.920> so<00:05:16.920> I'll<00:05:16.980> put<00:05:17.160> in<00:05:17.280> another<00:05:17.490> one<00:05:19.070> and<00:05:20.070> so

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 
secure so I'll put in another one and so

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.560 
secure so I'll put in another one and so
that's<00:05:21.300> pretty<00:05:21.750> much<00:05:21.990> it

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:23.570 
that's pretty much it

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:27.980 
that's pretty much it
so<00:05:24.570> my<00:05:24.720> last<00:05:24.930> step<00:05:25.350> is<00:05:25.680> just<00:05:26.870> smoothing<00:05:27.870> out

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:27.990 
so my last step is just smoothing out

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.130 
so my last step is just smoothing out
the<00:05:28.140> edges<00:05:28.850> and<00:05:29.850> I<00:05:30.090> will<00:05:30.270> do<00:05:30.480> that<00:05:30.720> by<00:05:31.020> applying

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:31.140 
the edges and I will do that by applying

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:37.010 
the edges and I will do that by applying
some<00:05:31.740> gel<00:05:32.010> just<00:05:32.910> to<00:05:33.420> the<00:05:33.540> edges<00:05:35.060> and<00:05:36.060> I'm<00:05:36.720> using

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 
some gel just to the edges and I'm using

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:44.330 
some gel just to the edges and I'm using
eco<00:05:37.470> styler<00:05:38.040> I<00:05:39.890> like<00:05:40.890> this<00:05:41.130> gel<00:05:41.900> cuz<00:05:43.340> doesn't

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:44.340 
eco styler I like this gel cuz doesn't

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:48.710 
eco styler I like this gel cuz doesn't
flake<00:05:45.120> up<00:05:45.560> and<00:05:46.560> I<00:05:47.310> don't<00:05:47.370> need<00:05:47.730> a<00:05:47.790> ton<00:05:48.420> of<00:05:48.450> it

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:48.720 
flake up and I don't need a ton of it

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:55.550 
flake up and I don't need a ton of it
for<00:05:49.020> it<00:05:49.110> to<00:05:49.260> hold<00:05:49.580> and<00:05:50.600> it's<00:05:51.600> alcohol<00:05:52.110> free<00:05:54.560> the

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:55.560 
for it to hold and it's alcohol free the

00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:00.860 
for it to hold and it's alcohol free the
one<00:05:55.740> I'm<00:05:55.890> using<00:05:56.160> has<00:05:56.490> olive<00:05:56.880> oil<00:05:57.090> in<00:05:57.300> it<00:05:59.720> so<00:06:00.720> now

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:00.870 
one I'm using has olive oil in it so now

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:02.660 
one I'm using has olive oil in it so now
I'm<00:06:01.050> using<00:06:01.290> her<00:06:01.530> baby<00:06:01.770> brush<00:06:02.160> just<00:06:02.430> to<00:06:02.520> brush

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:02.670 
I'm using her baby brush just to brush

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:06.500 
I'm using her baby brush just to brush
it<00:06:02.910> up<00:06:04.340> and<00:06:05.340> then<00:06:05.520> I'll<00:06:05.670> play<00:06:05.910> with<00:06:06.150> her<00:06:06.270> baby

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:06.510 
it up and then I'll play with her baby

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:08.750 
it up and then I'll play with her baby
here<00:06:06.810> a<00:06:06.870> little<00:06:07.020> bit<00:06:07.290> by<00:06:07.560> just<00:06:07.590> pushing<00:06:08.490> it

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:08.760 
here a little bit by just pushing it

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:13.820 
here a little bit by just pushing it
down<00:06:09.110> onto<00:06:10.110> her<00:06:10.680> face<00:06:10.980> and<00:06:11.580> then<00:06:12.560> sweeping<00:06:13.560> the

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:13.830 
down onto her face and then sweeping the

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:15.860 
down onto her face and then sweeping the
bristles<00:06:14.250> across<00:06:14.580> just<00:06:15.360> doesn't<00:06:15.690> make<00:06:15.780> them

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:15.870 
bristles across just doesn't make them

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:22.610 
bristles across just doesn't make them
need<00:06:17.330> and<00:06:18.330> that's<00:06:18.540> it<00:06:18.920> we're<00:06:19.920> done<00:06:20.030> so<00:06:21.620> the

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:22.620 
need and that's it we're done so the

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:25.280 
need and that's it we're done so the
great<00:06:22.830> thing<00:06:23.010> about<00:06:23.040> this<00:06:23.520> is<00:06:23.730> also<00:06:23.940> that<00:06:24.290> it

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:25.290 
great thing about this is also that it

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:27.920 
great thing about this is also that it
can<00:06:25.440> be<00:06:25.560> a<00:06:25.590> great<00:06:25.890> protective<00:06:26.460> style<00:06:26.930> because

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:27.930 
can be a great protective style because

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:28.749 
can be a great protective style because
if

00:06:28.749 --> 00:06:28.759 
if

00:06:28.759 --> 00:06:31.600 
if
have<00:06:28.849> a<00:06:28.879> silk<00:06:29.240> scarf<00:06:29.740> you<00:06:30.740> can<00:06:30.770> just<00:06:31.129> wrap<00:06:31.460> it

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:31.610 
have a silk scarf you can just wrap it

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:36.809 
have a silk scarf you can just wrap it
up<00:06:32.439> won't<00:06:33.439> cover<00:06:33.650> her<00:06:33.830> face<00:06:33.889> wrap<00:06:34.490> it<00:06:34.639> up<00:06:34.789> and

00:06:36.809 --> 00:06:36.819 
up won't cover her face wrap it up and

00:06:36.819 --> 00:06:40.869 
up won't cover her face wrap it up and
once<00:06:37.819> you<00:06:37.939> wrap<00:06:38.120> it<00:06:38.180> up<00:06:38.479> it'll<00:06:38.779> kind<00:06:39.259> of<00:06:39.879> set

00:06:40.869 --> 00:06:40.879 
once you wrap it up it'll kind of set

00:06:40.879 --> 00:06:43.959 
once you wrap it up it'll kind of set
the<00:06:41.089> gel<00:06:41.389> and<00:06:41.830> it'll<00:06:42.830> allow<00:06:43.069> the<00:06:43.129> bun<00:06:43.550> to<00:06:43.580> keep

00:06:43.959 --> 00:06:43.969 
the gel and it'll allow the bun to keep

00:06:43.969 --> 00:06:47.230 
the gel and it'll allow the bun to keep
so<00:06:44.389> that<00:06:44.809> way<00:06:45.080> tomorrow<00:06:45.559> I<00:06:46.159> will<00:06:46.729> not<00:06:46.909> have<00:06:47.120> to
