headphones<00:01:27.150> actually<00:01:27.780> work<00:01:28.020> really<00:01:28.380> well

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
headphones actually work really well

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.620 
headphones actually work really well
I've<00:01:29.040> tried<00:01:29.280> multiple<00:01:29.430> times<00:01:29.790> to<00:01:30.210> try<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.509> get

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
I've tried multiple times to try and get

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.840 
I've tried multiple times to try and get
them<00:01:30.750> knotted<00:01:31.140> up<00:01:31.259> and<00:01:31.500> trying<00:01:32.310> to<00:01:32.400> stick<00:01:32.700> the

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
them knotted up and trying to stick the

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.609 
them knotted up and trying to stick the
cable<00:01:33.150> in<00:01:33.270> my<00:01:33.299> pocket<00:01:33.840> with<00:01:33.990> leaving<00:01:34.320> the

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
cable in my pocket with leaving the

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.200 
cable in my pocket with leaving the
headphones<00:01:34.979> out<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:35.460> they<00:01:35.700> just<00:01:35.909> don't<00:01:36.060> seem

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
headphones out and they just don't seem

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.999 
headphones out and they just don't seem
to<00:01:36.329> tangle<00:01:36.630> which<00:01:36.780> I<00:01:36.960> guess<00:01:37.170> is<00:01:37.350> a<00:01:37.380> really<00:01:37.860> good

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
to tangle which I guess is a really good

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.710 
to tangle which I guess is a really good
thing<00:01:38.189> about<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.549> cable<00:01:38.880> however<00:01:39.270> despite

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
thing about the cable however despite

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.330 
thing about the cable however despite
that<00:01:39.869> something<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.500> do<00:01:40.619> of<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.860> cable<00:01:41.189> that

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
that something to do of the cable that

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.010 
that something to do of the cable that
is<00:01:41.490> not<00:01:41.700> very<00:01:41.850> good<00:01:41.939> is<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.450> volume<00:01:42.810> rocker

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
is not very good is the volume rocker

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.050 
is not very good is the volume rocker
they<00:01:43.409> actually<00:01:43.740> chose<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.009> put<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.340> slider<00:01:44.790> and

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
they actually chose to put a slider and

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.850 
they actually chose to put a slider and
instead<00:01:45.390> which<00:01:45.810> can<00:01:45.990> be<00:01:46.110> really<00:01:46.350> annoying<00:01:46.649> as

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
instead which can be really annoying as

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.590 
instead which can be really annoying as
I<00:01:46.890> found<00:01:47.220> myself<00:01:47.340> knocking<00:01:48.000> it<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:48.299> then<00:01:48.450> the

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
I found myself knocking it and then the

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.940 
I found myself knocking it and then the
headphones<00:01:48.960> being<00:01:49.170> really<00:01:49.350> quiet<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:49.860> I've

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
headphones being really quiet and I've

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.130 
headphones being really quiet and I've
turned<00:01:50.159> up<00:01:50.369> my<00:01:50.520> volume<00:01:50.970> to<00:01:51.390> realize<00:01:51.780> that<00:01:51.990> the

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
turned up my volume to realize that the

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.990 
turned up my volume to realize that the
rocker<00:01:52.350> has<00:01:52.649> been<00:01:52.890> down<00:01:53.159> all<00:01:53.369> this<00:01:53.490> time<00:01:53.729> and

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
rocker has been down all this time and

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.550 
rocker has been down all this time and
it's<00:01:54.329> just<00:01:54.540> something<00:01:54.720> that<00:01:54.899> can<00:01:55.140> get<00:01:55.259> really

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
it's just something that can get really

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.889 
it's just something that can get really
annoying<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:56.460> button<00:01:56.880> works<00:01:57.090> quite<00:01:57.420> well<00:01:57.450> I

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
annoying the button works quite well I

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.179 
annoying the button works quite well I
think<00:01:58.290> it<00:01:58.380> would<00:01:58.469> be<00:01:58.560> better<00:01:58.740> if<00:01:59.009> they'd

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
think it would be better if they'd

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.709 
think it would be better if they'd
branded<00:01:59.670> it<00:01:59.759> somehow<00:01:59.969> put<00:02:00.299> like<00:02:00.450> play<00:02:00.689> pause

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
branded it somehow put like play pause

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.770 
branded it somehow put like play pause
or<00:02:01.320> skip<00:02:02.130> buttons<00:02:02.640> but<00:02:03.060> they've<00:02:03.360> just<00:02:03.570> put<00:02:03.750> a

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
or skip buttons but they've just put a

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.230 
or skip buttons but they've just put a
single<00:02:04.200> button<00:02:04.380> next<00:02:04.710> to<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:05.130> rocker<00:02:05.610> it<00:02:06.090> also

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
single button next to the rocker it also

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.789 
single button next to the rocker it also
has<00:02:06.570> a<00:02:06.600> built-in<00:02:07.020> microphone<00:02:07.259> which<00:02:07.680> I

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
has a built-in microphone which I

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.440 
has a built-in microphone which I
haven't<00:02:07.979> really<00:02:08.280> tested<00:02:08.459> out<00:02:08.819> by<00:02:09.179> I<00:02:09.209> guess

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
haven't really tested out by I guess

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.119 
haven't really tested out by I guess
that<00:02:09.660> could<00:02:09.840> be<00:02:09.929> useful<00:02:10.110> for<00:02:10.319> some<00:02:10.679> people<00:02:10.709> the

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
that could be useful for some people the

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.619 
that could be useful for some people the
build<00:02:11.310> of<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:11.489> headphones<00:02:11.879> overall<00:02:12.360> I<00:02:12.540> think

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
build of the headphones overall I think

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.220 
build of the headphones overall I think
is<00:02:12.959> quite

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
is quite

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.839 
is quite
good<00:02:13.409> it's<00:02:13.800> mainly<00:02:14.010> constructed<00:02:14.459> out<00:02:14.819> of

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849 
good it's mainly constructed out of

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:17.390 
good it's mainly constructed out of
plastic<00:02:15.480> metal<00:02:15.900> and<00:02:16.319> a<00:02:16.650> little<00:02:16.950> bit<00:02:17.069> of<00:02:17.190> fake

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
plastic metal and a little bit of fake

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.399 
plastic metal and a little bit of fake
leather<00:02:17.730> kind<00:02:18.090> of<00:02:18.209> material<00:02:18.750> the<00:02:19.200> fake

00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:19.409 
leather kind of material the fake

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:21.199 
leather kind of material the fake
leather<00:02:19.680> feels<00:02:20.099> really<00:02:20.519> soft<00:02:20.760> when<00:02:20.940> it's

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
leather feels really soft when it's

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:22.640 
leather feels really soft when it's
around<00:02:21.480> your<00:02:21.690> head<00:02:21.870> it<00:02:22.290> gives<00:02:22.440> good

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
around your head it gives good

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.649 
around your head it gives good
cushioning<00:02:23.129> to<00:02:23.190> the<00:02:23.400> top<00:02:23.610> and<00:02:23.819> it<00:02:24.150> feels<00:02:24.420> nice

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:24.659 
cushioning to the top and it feels nice

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:26.420 
cushioning to the top and it feels nice
around<00:02:24.900> your<00:02:25.140> ears<00:02:25.379> the<00:02:25.709> hard<00:02:25.890> plastic<00:02:26.099> you

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
around your ears the hard plastic you

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.039 
around your ears the hard plastic you
think<00:02:26.790> would<00:02:26.970> take<00:02:27.209> away<00:02:27.450> from<00:02:27.659> the<00:02:27.780> look<00:02:27.930> of

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:28.049 
think would take away from the look of

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:30.140 
think would take away from the look of
the<00:02:28.140> headphones<00:02:28.500> but<00:02:28.950> not<00:02:29.159> so<00:02:29.310> -<00:02:29.459> I<00:02:29.700> barely

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
the headphones but not so - I barely

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.330 
the headphones but not so - I barely
even<00:02:30.390> notice<00:02:30.840> it<00:02:31.019> and<00:02:31.200> the<00:02:31.500> metal<00:02:31.830> also<00:02:31.980> looks

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
even notice it and the metal also looks

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.830 
even notice it and the metal also looks
quite<00:02:32.549> nice<00:02:32.760> when<00:02:33.209> you're<00:02:33.360> wearing<00:02:33.599> the

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
quite nice when you're wearing the

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:34.460

headphones

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470

your<00:02:36.299> head<00:02:36.450> I<00:02:36.660> felt<00:02:37.080> that<00:02:37.290> the<00:02:37.410> soft<00:02:37.650> material

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769 
your head I felt that the soft material

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:40.009 
your head I felt that the soft material
that<00:02:38.340> mentioned<00:02:38.730> just<00:02:38.879> a<00:02:38.970> second<00:02:39.269> ago<00:02:39.360> feels

really nice and I've had no issues

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.339 
really nice and I've had no issues
wearing<00:02:42.360> these<00:02:42.480> headphones<00:02:42.690> for<00:02:43.049> a<00:02:43.110> long

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
wearing these headphones for a long

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:45.890 
wearing these headphones for a long
period<00:02:43.709> of<00:02:43.739> time<00:02:43.950> I<00:02:44.159> think<00:02:44.790> before<00:02:45.329> I've<00:02:45.660> worn

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900

these<00:02:46.110> headphones<00:02:46.349> for<00:02:46.650> at<00:02:46.769> least<00:02:46.890> kind<00:02:47.099> of

ears<00:02:51.720> hurt<00:02:52.170> so<00:02:52.410> much<00:02:52.620> even<00:02:53.370> though<00:02:53.549> one

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
ears hurt so much even though one

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.789 
ears hurt so much even though one
problem<00:02:54.420> of<00:02:54.540> it<00:02:54.660> is<00:02:54.810> they're<00:02:55.140> kind<00:02:55.349> of<00:02:55.530> tight

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
problem of it is they're kind of tight

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:57.890 
problem of it is they're kind of tight
which<00:02:56.400> I<00:02:56.609> don't<00:02:56.760> really<00:02:56.970> see<00:02:57.299> it<00:02:57.359> as<00:02:57.390> a<00:02:57.510> problem

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
which I don't really see it as a problem

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.390 
which I don't really see it as a problem
to<00:02:57.930> be<00:02:58.049> honest<00:02:58.349> I've<00:02:58.500> heard<00:02:58.799> other<00:02:59.040> people

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
to be honest I've heard other people

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.500 
to be honest I've heard other people
when<00:02:59.519> I<00:02:59.549> was<00:02:59.640> looking<00:03:00.030> around<00:03:00.120> to<00:03:00.329> other

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
when I was looking around to other

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.300 
when I was looking around to other
reviews<00:03:00.989> saying<00:03:01.500> that's<00:03:01.709> not<00:03:01.920> really<00:03:02.190> the

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
reviews saying that's not really the

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.430 
reviews saying that's not really the
best<00:03:02.459> thing<00:03:02.730> as<00:03:02.940> it<00:03:03.150> kind<00:03:03.299> of<00:03:03.480> can<00:03:04.019> push

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
best thing as it kind of can push

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.990 
best thing as it kind of can push
against<00:03:04.890> your<00:03:05.010> ears<00:03:05.160> and<00:03:05.340> make<00:03:05.489> them<00:03:05.609> hurt<00:03:05.790> but

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
against your ears and make them hurt but

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.580 
against your ears and make them hurt but
I<00:03:06.030> think<00:03:06.299> because<00:03:06.420> the<00:03:06.660> soft<00:03:06.900> material<00:03:07.049> that

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
I think because the soft material that

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.589 
I think because the soft material that
doesn't<00:03:07.890> really<00:03:08.040> matter<00:03:08.280> and<00:03:08.640> yeah<00:03:09.090> overall<00:03:09.480> I

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:09.599 
doesn't really matter and yeah overall I

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:11.240 
doesn't really matter and yeah overall I
just<00:03:09.720> really<00:03:10.319> like<00:03:10.500> the<00:03:10.620> feel<00:03:10.799> of<00:03:10.829> them<00:03:11.129> I

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
just really like the feel of them I

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:12.680 
just really like the feel of them I
think<00:03:11.519> now<00:03:11.670> it's<00:03:11.849> time<00:03:12.090> to<00:03:12.120> talk<00:03:12.359> about<00:03:12.599> the

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
think now it's time to talk about the

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.390 
think now it's time to talk about the
most<00:03:12.900> important<00:03:13.530> thing<00:03:13.739> about<00:03:13.769> a<00:03:14.040> pair<00:03:14.370> of

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
most important thing about a pair of

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.550 
most important thing about a pair of
over<00:03:14.879> the<00:03:14.970> ear<00:03:15.180> headphones<00:03:15.209> and<00:03:15.900> that's<00:03:16.379> the

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
over the ear headphones and that's the

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.740 
over the ear headphones and that's the
sound<00:03:16.829> quality<00:03:17.459> now<00:03:18.030> one<00:03:18.299> of<00:03:18.329> the<00:03:18.510> main

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
sound quality now one of the main

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.449 
sound quality now one of the main
reasons<00:03:19.260> that<00:03:19.319> I<00:03:19.470> decided<00:03:19.829> to<00:03:20.040> pick<00:03:20.220> these

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
reasons that I decided to pick these

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:22.250 
reasons that I decided to pick these
headphones<00:03:20.730> up<00:03:21.180> over<00:03:21.660> something<00:03:22.019> like<00:03:22.049> the

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
headphones up over something like the

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.309 
headphones up over something like the
audio<00:03:22.470> technica<00:03:22.919> ath<00:03:23.730> M<00:03:24.000> 50s<00:03:24.540> is<00:03:24.690> mainly

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319 
audio technica ath M 50s is mainly

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:27.199 
audio technica ath M 50s is mainly
because<00:03:25.560> according<00:03:26.220> to<00:03:26.430> other<00:03:26.669> reviewers

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
because according to other reviewers

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.479 
because according to other reviewers
it's<00:03:27.480> got<00:03:27.630> something<00:03:27.930> called<00:03:28.079> aw<00:03:28.889> spectrum

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
it's got something called aw spectrum

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.729 
it's got something called aw spectrum
which<00:03:29.880> means<00:03:30.180> instead<00:03:30.840> of<00:03:30.900> what<00:03:31.349> something

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
which means instead of what something

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.520 
which means instead of what something
like<00:03:32.040> the<00:03:32.430> m50<00:03:33.359> s<00:03:33.419> have<00:03:33.599> which<00:03:34.109> has<00:03:34.319> really

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
like the m50 s have which has really

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.890 
like the m50 s have which has really
nice<00:03:34.739> highs<00:03:35.040> and<00:03:35.310> really<00:03:35.549> nice<00:03:35.730> bass<00:03:36.060> but<00:03:36.630> it's

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
nice highs and really nice bass but it's

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.300 
nice highs and really nice bass but it's
not<00:03:37.079> that<00:03:37.230> great<00:03:37.410> in<00:03:37.590> the<00:03:37.680> middle<00:03:37.799> this<00:03:38.250> is

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
not that great in the middle this is

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.520 
not that great in the middle this is
kind<00:03:38.669> of<00:03:38.790> good<00:03:39.299> all-round<00:03:39.959> and<00:03:40.230> gives<00:03:40.410> a

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
kind of good all-round and gives a

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.280 
kind of good all-round and gives a
really<00:03:40.769> superb<00:03:41.190> overall<00:03:41.819> sound<00:03:42.090> quality

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
really superb overall sound quality

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.599 
really superb overall sound quality
because<00:03:43.290> of<00:03:43.440> the<00:03:43.530> sound<00:03:43.799> spectrum<00:03:44.040> it<00:03:44.370> doesn't

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:44.609 
because of the sound spectrum it doesn't

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:46.640 
because of the sound spectrum it doesn't
really<00:03:44.790> matter<00:03:45.060> what<00:03:45.450> genre<00:03:45.660> of<00:03:46.109> music<00:03:46.260> you're

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
listening to it always sounds great

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:49.640 
listening to it always sounds great
because<00:03:48.329> they're<00:03:48.690> certain<00:03:49.079> headphones<00:03:49.470> such

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
because they're certain headphones such

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:09.359 
to do with the volume I felt that

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:10.819 
to do with the volume I felt that
