a tough tough schedule death and but it

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.819 
a tough tough schedule death and but it
can<00:01:29.310> be<00:01:29.780> you<00:01:30.780> know<00:01:30.810> we<00:01:31.110> can't<00:01:31.320> put<00:01:31.500> that<00:01:31.530> on<00:01:31.710> our

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
can be you know we can't put that on our

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.060 
can be you know we can't put that on our
self<00:01:32.220> that<00:01:32.400> meal<00:01:32.850> off<00:01:33.750> so<00:01:34.170> we<00:01:34.290> didn't<00:01:34.560> win<00:01:34.950> as

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
self that meal off so we didn't win as

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.539 
self that meal off so we didn't win as
many<00:01:35.100> games<00:01:35.759> as<00:01:36.000> we<00:01:36.180> wanted<00:01:36.540> to<00:01:36.689> I<00:01:36.720> think

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:37.549 
many games as we wanted to I think

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:39.859 
many games as we wanted to I think
there's<00:01:38.549> always<00:01:38.700> going<00:01:38.939> to<00:01:39.000> be<00:01:39.060> a<00:01:39.299> part<00:01:39.780> in

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
there's always going to be a part in

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.080 
there's always going to be a part in
this<00:01:39.930> season<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:40.590> we<00:01:41.159> got<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:41.400> find<00:01:41.520> win<00:01:41.729> win

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
this season and we got to find win win

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.749 
this season and we got to find win win
more<00:01:42.329> games<00:01:42.509> but<00:01:42.869> I<00:01:43.140> thought<00:01:44.070> that<00:01:44.640> would

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
more games but I thought that would

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.249 
more games but I thought that would
probably<00:01:45.240> had<00:01:45.479> toughest<00:01:45.810> stretch<00:01:45.990> in<00:01:46.170> the

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
probably had toughest stretch in the

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.910 
probably had toughest stretch in the
season<00:01:46.590> so<00:01:46.799> that's<00:01:47.159> good<00:01:47.369> that<00:01:47.399> it's<00:01:47.640> over

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
season where we don't made in and you

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.160 
season where we don't made in and you
know<00:02:44.650> other<00:02:44.920> stretch<00:02:45.280> at<00:02:45.489> dating<00:02:46.030> shots<00:02:46.989> out

of<00:02:47.200> it<00:02:47.380> so<00:02:47.590> I<00:02:48.280> actually<00:02:48.700> thought<00:02:49.030> that<00:02:49.269> you

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
of it so I actually thought that you

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.600 
of it so I actually thought that you
know<00:02:50.290> except<00:02:50.620> the<00:02:50.709> second<00:02:51.100> period<00:02:51.250> i<00:02:51.400> thought

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
know except the second period i thought

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.520 
know except the second period i thought
they<00:02:51.760> kept<00:02:52.450> pretty<00:02:52.630> much<00:02:52.720> everything<00:02:53.290> to<00:02:53.410> the

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
they kept pretty much everything to the

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.269 
they kept pretty much everything to the
outside<00:02:53.950> which<00:02:54.160> makes<00:02:54.910> it<00:02:55.030> a<00:02:55.090> lot<00:02:55.209> easier
