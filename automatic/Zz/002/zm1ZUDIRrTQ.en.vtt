00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.230 
Gohan's pretty short uh there's just
there<00:02:26.680> I<00:02:26.709> mean<00:02:26.920> there's<00:02:27.160> just<00:02:27.220> I<00:02:27.610> mean<00:02:28.060> they're

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
there I mean there's just I mean they're

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:34.100 
there I mean there's just I mean they're
they're<00:02:28.270> really<00:02:28.840> short<00:02:29.110> ah<00:02:32.280> so<00:02:33.280> it<00:02:33.550> should<00:02:33.880> be

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
they're really short ah so it should be

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.340 
they're really short ah so it should be
relatively<00:02:35.110> quick<00:02:36.660> so<00:02:37.660> just<00:02:37.900> keep<00:02:38.050> that<00:02:38.110> in

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
relatively quick so just keep that in

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.920 
relatively quick so just keep that in
mind<00:02:38.709> and<00:02:39.010> the<00:02:39.100> coming<00:02:39.340> of<00:02:39.520> each<00:02:39.700> because<00:02:40.690> it's

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
mind and the coming of each because it's

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.810 
mind and the coming of each because it's
not<00:02:41.170> going<00:02:41.470> to<00:02:41.650> be<00:02:41.770> as<00:02:41.980> like<00:02:42.220> I<00:02:42.280> said<00:02:42.550> it's<00:02:42.670> not

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:42.820 
not going to be as like I said it's not

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:48.410 
not going to be as like I said it's not
gonna<00:02:42.970> be<00:02:43.090> as<00:02:43.270> long<00:02:43.570> as<00:02:43.780> I've<00:02:43.930> already<00:02:44.520> so<00:02:45.520> I

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.600 

guess<00:02:49.420> that's<00:02:49.630> all<00:02:50.200> right<00:02:50.560> then<00:02:50.890> no<00:02:51.280> one<00:02:51.400> wants

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
guess that's all right then no one wants

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.110 
guess that's all right then no one wants
to<00:02:51.670> see<00:02:51.820> too<00:02:52.120> many

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120

of my head but they said like the one

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.710 
of my head but they said like the one
thing<00:03:27.800> that<00:03:27.830> you<00:03:27.980> should<00:03:28.070> try<00:03:28.760> to<00:03:28.820> avoid<00:03:28.970> to<00:03:29.540> do

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
thing that you should try to avoid to do

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.910 
thing that you should try to avoid to do
is<00:03:30.640> anticipate<00:03:31.640> what<00:03:32.360> your<00:03:32.600> next<00:03:32.840> LP<00:03:33.230> is<00:03:33.620> going
