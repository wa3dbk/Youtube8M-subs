you can pry out the splash shield

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.300 
you can pry out the splash shield
and<00:02:31.379> pry<00:02:31.650> it<00:02:31.680> down<00:02:32.010> from<00:02:32.610> the<00:02:32.790> fender<00:02:34.069> and<00:02:35.069> that

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
and pry it down from the fender and that

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.740 
and pry it down from the fender and that
will<00:02:35.400> gain<00:02:35.549> you<00:02:35.700> enough<00:02:35.909> access<00:02:36.329> to<00:02:36.510> get<00:02:36.629> in

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
will gain you enough access to get in

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.690 
will gain you enough access to get in
there<00:02:36.930> and<00:02:36.989> work<00:02:37.140> on<00:02:37.349> it<00:02:37.379> now<00:02:38.159> I<00:02:38.189> don't<00:02:38.400> have

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
there and work on it now I don't have

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:39.949 
there and work on it now I don't have
the<00:02:38.849> wheel<00:02:39.030> tire<00:02:39.420> off

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
the wheel tire off

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.500 
the wheel tire off
I<00:02:39.989> simply<00:02:40.980> just<00:02:41.370> have<00:02:41.549> it<00:02:41.700> jacked<00:02:41.970> up<00:02:42.180> enough

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
I simply just have it jacked up enough

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.899 
I simply just have it jacked up enough
so<00:02:43.409> the<00:02:43.590> tire<00:02:43.769> is<00:02:44.040> just<00:02:44.069> barely<00:02:44.489> off<00:02:44.640> the

00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:44.909 
so the tire is just barely off the

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:46.460 
so the tire is just barely off the
ground<00:02:45.180> that<00:02:45.420> gives<00:02:45.959> me<00:02:46.079> more<00:02:46.230> than<00:02:46.409> enough

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
ground that gives me more than enough

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:52.920 
ground that gives me more than enough
working<00:02:47.040> room<00:02:47.220> in<00:02:47.370> here

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.660 

before<00:02:53.930> we<00:02:54.020> both<00:02:54.140> up<00:02:54.350> the<00:02:54.470> apron<00:02:54.710> play<00:02:54.980> I<00:02:55.190> like

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
before we both up the apron play I like

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.190 
before we both up the apron play I like
to<00:02:55.790> take<00:02:55.970> a<00:02:56.000> couple<00:02:56.330> of<00:02:56.450> pieces<00:02:56.630> of<00:02:56.810> duct<00:02:57.110> tape

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
to take a couple of pieces of duct tape

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.260 
to take a couple of pieces of duct tape
and<00:02:57.470> put<00:02:57.950> it<00:02:57.980> over<00:02:58.280> this<00:02:58.400> hole<00:02:58.610> in<00:02:58.880> the<00:02:58.940> metal

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 
and put it over this hole in the metal

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:01.180 
and put it over this hole in the metal
apron<00:02:59.750> there's<00:03:00.170> some<00:03:00.380> sharp<00:03:00.620> metal<00:03:00.800> in<00:03:01.010> there

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
apron there's some sharp metal in there

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:02.590 
apron there's some sharp metal in there
and<00:03:01.310> this<00:03:01.370> will<00:03:01.580> help<00:03:01.790> protect<00:03:01.970> that<00:03:02.330> pipe

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
and this will help protect that pipe

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.330 
and this will help protect that pipe
while<00:03:02.780> you're<00:03:02.960> putting<00:03:03.200> it<00:03:03.290> in<00:03:03.380> we'll<00:03:04.160> go

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
while you're putting it in we'll go

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:05.800 
while you're putting it in we'll go
ahead<00:03:04.430> and<00:03:04.580> take<00:03:04.790> the<00:03:04.910> factory<00:03:05.270> bolt<00:03:05.510> and

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810
