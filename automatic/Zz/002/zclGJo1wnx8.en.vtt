still<00:02:04.740> has<00:02:04.950> movements<00:02:05.790> in<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:05.969> hair<00:02:06.469> there<00:02:07.469> is

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
still has movements in the hair there is

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.770 
still has movements in the hair there is
very<00:02:07.860> minimal<00:02:08.369> shedding<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:09.270> only<00:02:09.539> thing

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
very minimal shedding the only thing

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:10.210 
very minimal shedding the only thing
that<00:02:09.929> I

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
that I

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.860 
that I
to<00:02:10.399> say<00:02:10.610> that<00:02:10.729> I've<00:02:10.790> been<00:02:11.030> experiencing<00:02:11.720> what

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
to say that I've been experiencing what

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.020 
to say that I've been experiencing what
the<00:02:11.960> hair<00:02:12.200> is<00:02:12.380> a<00:02:12.410> bit<00:02:12.710> of<00:02:12.950> frizziness<00:02:13.490> in<00:02:13.820> the

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
the hair is a bit of frizziness in the

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.750 
the hair is a bit of frizziness in the
center<00:02:14.450> of<00:02:14.660> the<00:02:15.290> hair<00:02:15.590> and<00:02:15.830> I<00:02:16.160> believe<00:02:16.550> the

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
center of the hair and I believe the

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.430 
center of the hair and I believe the
reason<00:02:16.940> being<00:02:17.240> is<00:02:17.480> because<00:02:17.510> i<00:02:17.870> put<00:02:18.260> the

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
reason being is because i put the

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.580 
reason being is because i put the
12-inch<00:02:18.890> i'm<00:02:19.280> at<00:02:19.700> the<00:02:19.910> top<00:02:20.210> and<00:02:20.540> i'm<00:02:21.110> guessing

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
12-inch i'm at the top and i'm guessing

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:22.960 
12-inch i'm at the top and i'm guessing
that<00:02:21.620> is<00:02:21.890> the<00:02:22.010> reason<00:02:22.190> why<00:02:22.370> because<00:02:22.670> it's<00:02:22.850> the

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
that is the reason why because it's the

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.750 
that is the reason why because it's the
shortest<00:02:23.390> length<00:02:23.870> as<00:02:24.200> you<00:02:24.260> can<00:02:24.890> see<00:02:25.160> so<00:02:25.640> it

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
shortest length as you can see so it

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.990 
shortest length as you can see so it
tends<00:02:26.000> to<00:02:26.090> kind<00:02:26.360> of<00:02:26.480> press<00:02:27.260> up<00:02:27.500> like<00:02:27.770> so<00:02:28.130> join

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
tends to kind of press up like so join

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.270 
tends to kind of press up like so join
throughout<00:02:29.630> the<00:02:29.810> day<00:02:30.050> but<00:02:30.590> i'm<00:02:30.710> guessing<00:02:30.980> that

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
throughout the day but i'm guessing that

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.400 
throughout the day but i'm guessing that
that's<00:02:31.460> because<00:02:31.970> of<00:02:32.210> the<00:02:32.240> shorter<00:02:33.050> length<00:02:33.230> at

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
that's because of the shorter length at

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.590 
that's because of the shorter length at
the<00:02:33.530> top<00:02:33.770> if<00:02:34.220> i<00:02:34.400> were<00:02:34.490> to<00:02:34.550> put<00:02:34.640> the<00:02:34.880> 12-inch<00:02:35.300> at

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
the top if i were to put the 12-inch at

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.530 
the top if i were to put the 12-inch at
the<00:02:35.750> bottom<00:02:36.170> i'm<00:02:36.410> pretty<00:02:36.590> sure<00:02:36.740> because<00:02:37.540> i'm

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
the bottom i'm pretty sure because i'm

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:39.880 
the bottom i'm pretty sure because i'm
pretty<00:02:38.750> sure<00:02:39.020> that<00:02:39.050> i<00:02:39.230> wouldn't<00:02:39.530> have<00:02:39.680> had

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
pretty sure that i wouldn't have had

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.580 
pretty sure that i wouldn't have had
this<00:02:40.100> problem<00:02:40.550> but<00:02:41.180> it's<00:02:41.360> not<00:02:41.480> too<00:02:41.780> much<00:02:42.170> of<00:02:42.230> a

about<00:03:12.440> this<00:03:12.650> hair<00:03:12.950> so<00:03:13.640> far<00:03:13.910> it's<00:03:14.120> really<00:03:14.510> nice

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
about this hair so far it's really nice

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:19.810 
about this hair so far it's really nice
i<00:03:15.080> received<00:03:16.070> the<00:03:16.670> hair<00:03:16.940> in<00:03:17.209> natural<00:03:18.140> um<00:03:18.470> in<00:03:18.890> a

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
i received the hair in natural um in a

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:23.650 
i received the hair in natural um in a
natural<00:03:20.290> color<00:03:21.290> which<00:03:21.590> is<00:03:21.620> I<00:03:22.100> guess<00:03:22.700> more<00:03:23.269> of<00:03:23.480> a

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
natural color which is I guess more of a

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.250 
natural color which is I guess more of a
color<00:03:23.959> to<00:03:24.320> 21<00:03:25.130> be<00:03:25.400> I<00:03:25.670> did<00:03:26.180> not<00:03:26.330> dye<00:03:26.570> the<00:03:26.630> hair<00:03:26.780> as

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
color to 21 be I did not dye the hair as

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.620 
color to 21 be I did not dye the hair as
you<00:03:27.380> guys<00:03:27.560> can<00:03:27.739> see<00:03:27.850> Michael<00:03:28.850> goes<00:03:29.120> through<00:03:29.480> it

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
you guys can see Michael goes through it

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.229 
you guys can see Michael goes through it
and<00:03:29.810> it<00:03:30.350> blends<00:03:30.590> really<00:03:30.860> well<00:03:31.010> with<00:03:31.489> my<00:03:31.700> actual

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 
and it blends really well with my actual

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:35.199 
and it blends really well with my actual
natural<00:03:33.100> hair<00:03:34.100> I<00:03:34.130> really<00:03:34.610> really<00:03:34.850> do<00:03:35.000> like

natural hair I really really do like

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:37.210 
natural hair I really really do like
this<00:03:35.420> hair<00:03:35.750> I'm<00:03:36.019> let's<00:03:36.410> see<00:03:36.560> how<00:03:36.680> it<00:03:36.709> is<00:03:36.920> after

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
this hair I'm let's see how it is after

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.449 
this hair I'm let's see how it is after
a<00:03:37.400> month<00:03:37.730> or<00:03:37.880> so<00:03:38.269> the<00:03:39.230> bundles<00:03:39.709> are<00:03:40.040> very

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
a month or so the bundles are very

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:42.850 
a month or so the bundles are very
reasonable<00:03:40.880> is<00:03:41.390> a<00:03:41.420> hundred<00:03:41.959> grams<00:03:42.290> for<00:03:42.709> each

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:42.860 
reasonable is a hundred grams for each

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.400 
reasonable is a hundred grams for each
bundle<00:03:43.220> I'm<00:03:43.670> at<00:03:44.180> first<00:03:44.570> when<00:03:44.780> I<00:03:44.810> first<00:03:45.110> did<00:03:45.290> I

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
bundle I'm at first when I first did I

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.320 
bundle I'm at first when I first did I
thought<00:03:45.620> it<00:03:45.709> was<00:03:45.799> a<00:03:45.830> bit<00:03:46.100> too<00:03:46.430> flat<00:03:46.820> for<00:03:46.850> four

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:47.330 
thought it was a bit too flat for four

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.210 
thought it was a bit too flat for four
bundles<00:03:47.630> but<00:03:48.350> I'm<00:03:48.440> guessing<00:03:48.680> that<00:03:48.890> maybe

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
bundles but I'm guessing that maybe

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:50.920 
bundles but I'm guessing that maybe
because<00:03:49.610> it's<00:03:49.790> straight<00:03:50.090> hair<00:03:50.360> maybe<00:03:50.600> that's

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
because it's straight hair maybe that's

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.170 
because it's straight hair maybe that's
why<00:03:51.170> but<00:03:51.739> at<00:03:51.860> first<00:03:52.070> I<00:03:52.280> was<00:03:52.400> like<00:03:52.430> wait<00:03:52.790> this<00:03:53.030> is

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
why but at first I was like wait this is

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.030 
why but at first I was like wait this is
for<00:03:53.209> bundles<00:03:53.810> and<00:03:53.900> it<00:03:53.989> was<00:03:54.080> really<00:03:54.320> flat<00:03:54.739> for

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
for bundles and it was really flat for

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.160 
for bundles and it was really flat for
me<00:03:55.160> but<00:03:55.670> I'm<00:03:55.760> also<00:03:55.970> assuming<00:03:56.299> that<00:03:56.840> because<00:03:56.959> i

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
me but I'm also assuming that because i

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:59.259 
me but I'm also assuming that because i
did<00:03:57.410> not<00:03:57.440> apply<00:03:57.890> the<00:03:58.340> closure<00:03:58.670> along<00:03:59.239> with

00:03:59.259 --> 00:03:59.269 
did not apply the closure along with

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:01.720 
did not apply the closure along with
this<00:03:59.720> that's<00:04:00.380> the<00:04:00.590> reason<00:04:00.860> why<00:04:00.920> maybe<00:04:01.310> it's

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
this that's the reason why maybe it's

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.539 
this that's the reason why maybe it's
too<00:04:02.390> flat<00:04:02.720> but<00:04:03.019> i<00:04:03.200> like<00:04:03.620> it<00:04:03.799> like<00:04:03.920> I<00:04:04.070> said<00:04:04.340> said

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:04.549 
too flat but i like it like I said said

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:07.720 
too flat but i like it like I said said
i<00:04:04.580> was<00:04:04.970> going<00:04:05.209> for<00:04:05.360> a<00:04:05.570> more<00:04:05.989> natural<00:04:06.049> look<00:04:06.980> so<00:04:07.459> i

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:34.289 
thought on how I really feel about this

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:36.439 
thought on how I really feel about this
Hair<00:04:34.560> and<00:04:34.860> hopefully<00:04:35.669> you<00:04:35.699> know<00:04:35.939> nothing

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:36.449 
Hair and hopefully you know nothing

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:39.379 
Hair and hopefully you know nothing
changes<00:04:36.960> and<00:04:37.080> everything<00:04:37.500> still<00:04:38.300> remains<00:04:39.300> the

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:39.389 
changes and everything still remains the

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:41.240 
changes and everything still remains the
same<00:04:39.689> so<00:04:39.750> far<00:04:40.289> i<00:04:40.319> have<00:04:40.500> really<00:04:40.800> minimal

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
same so far i have really minimal

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.429 
same so far i have really minimal
shedding<00:04:41.610> i<00:04:41.699> think<00:04:41.909> and<00:04:42.090> a<00:04:42.180> day<00:04:42.479> when<00:04:43.110> i<00:04:43.139> comb

00:04:43.429 --> 00:04:43.439
