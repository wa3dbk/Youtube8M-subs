 [Nippon Toru tv] "Hitomebore" with seedlings 

00:00:03.936 --> 00:00:06.868
 Speaking of Japanese staple food is rice 

00:00:06.868 --> 00:00:11.622
 Freshly cooked rice is an essential part of the Japanese dining table 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:20.030
 In this video, we will introduce the process of rice seedling from among the rice production methods. 

00:00:21.012 --> 00:00:26.779
 It is planting work of variety called "Hitamebore" from Miyagi prefecture to have you see 

00:00:28.255 --> 00:00:35.082
 "Hitomebore" is more tenacious and sweeter than other rice types. 

00:00:35.854 --> 00:00:43.569
 Historically, sansanishiki was hit hard in the great cold of 1993 

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:50.354
 It is a variety that was born by the crossing of "Koshihikari" and "First Star" as a variety that can withstand cold regions 

00:00:51.391 --> 00:00:58.161
 It is produced in six northeastern prefectures including Kitakyushu and Hokuriku, including Miyagi Prefecture. 

00:01:01.425 --> 00:01:06.249
 Rice planting takes place around the middle of May every year 

00:01:08.825 --> 00:01:14.737
 In Tome City, Miyagi Prefecture, the soil rich in essential elements that Kitakami River wanted to bring 

00:01:14.737 --> 00:01:23.626
 Suitable for rice production because of the mild climate in the middle of Sanriku Coast and Kurikoma Range 

00:01:24.356 --> 00:01:28.683
 Rice is planted in this way with the riding rice planter 

00:01:29.657 --> 00:01:38.021
 If planted in the middle of May, it will grow in about six months and can be harvested in early October 

00:01:38.817 --> 00:01:44.620
 3.5 3.5 t of rice is harvested from 1 hectare of rice field 

00:01:46.224 --> 00:01:50.560
 When planting seedlings, be careful not to run out of stock 

00:01:50.564 --> 00:01:52.270
 The condition that the seedlings that were supposed to be planted at equal intervals did not go well is called "lack" 

00:01:52.306 --> 00:02:03.040
 We carry out thing such as pest control spray application, water level management, weed control in the seedling box just before rice planting to maintain quality 

00:02:04.005 --> 00:02:09.330
 Above, I saw how rice seedlings are planted
