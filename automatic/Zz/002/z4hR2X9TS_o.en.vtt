00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.629
 t 

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:11.309
 look what you need to convert your 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.320
 Actor automatic as standard 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.850
 it's practically simple that the 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.520
 vehicle has all the parts 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:20.080
 necessary necessary, I mean 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.690
 obviously the transmission 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.550
 when you suggest that you are 

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:26.890
 present when they are removing the 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:29.050
 transmission why because the screws 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:32.230
 these that hold the engine block 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:34.239
 if they change in this case they will change 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:37.180
 in the starter because this is the 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:39.129
 starter reaching us here this 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.960
 is that the starter is attached to the 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:44.000
 part of what the engine 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.430
 all the screws that the 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.649
 transmission directly to the block the 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.019
 you need because because two change their 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:56.110
 size I do not remember what is in this case 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:57.910
 is this the bottom starter 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.070
 and I think it's one behind that comes up 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.630
 of the motor support the support of the 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.600
 motor the rear 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:06.670
 you also need support support 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.550
 If you change from automatic to standard with 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:13.090
 your screws you also need then the 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:14.980
 rods the rods that hold the 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.590
 changes they expect by making changes in 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:21.119
 this case 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:24.270
 occupy the lines the line from which 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:27.140
 lead to hydraulic pressure in the 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.140
 slave cylinder 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:34.610
 the supports are practically the 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:37.580
 same what is the front support what 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.020
 which is the support of the right side of the 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.190
 engine and the support to do it are the 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:44.980
 themselves the base is the same you occupy the 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:47.500
 cylinder 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:50.250
 the master cylinder your girls their 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.250
 respective lines 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.520
 although today you're going to need the cinema scream 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:59.780
 the pedal cylinder the lines that 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.770
 they hold all the hydraulic pressure 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.440
 practically that state of the cylinder 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:08.039
 master the line that will hold the 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:10.350
 regulator and the fork in one as it 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:13.710
 call this 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:17.470
 what is a cylindrical cylinder is the one 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:19.190
 makes lens hydraulic pressure 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.440
 and here 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:25.880
 this hole in the wall of fire 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:32.910
 several together usually the 94 ones 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:35.820
 97 of 94 95 do not possess that s that hole 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:38.600
 I in this case I had to do it there 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.600
 with the help of one 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:46.739
 a drill to make the hole put it 

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:48.480
 I think the 96 97 already have this is a 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:50.159
 cap that sedesa screw took off is 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.700
 the cap and you're ready to 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:52.700
 do it standard 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:01.230
 it's from the inside 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:02.790
 and you're going to need what is all the 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.180
 pedals I suggest you get the 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:08.840
 three pedals why because this and this 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.390
 they are one 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.220
 in this case if you stay with the 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.970
 automatic the automatic is longer the 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:18.200
 Brake is going to hit you with it 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.220
 I do not recommend it at all 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.170
 so 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.450
 get the three pedals once 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.430
 give you the three pedals these two go 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.730
 together in a single plate this separate 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.190
 this separate one comes together directly with 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.270
 the one above 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:39.050
 it sticks directly with the cylinder it 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:41.060
 displayed with the master cylinder 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:43.370
 blog with that claws occupy also 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.870
 directly the gear lever the 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.180
 gear lever as it is a base 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.070
 complete this base has nothing of 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.720
 science is nothing more to remove and put the 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:53.840
 previous template removes is the 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:59.150
 automatic you place the new one is that of the 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:04:01.850
 standard and then all your screws is 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:05.540
 that the conversion is very simple 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:07.370
 standard you take off fights with one 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.860
 electric then it goes back to the box 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:12.410
 the mechanical box 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:14.710
 do not clear up your doubts yesterday all of me 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.710
 dices
