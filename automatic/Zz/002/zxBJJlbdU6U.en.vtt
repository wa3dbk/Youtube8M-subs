it's digital I'm getting have you ever
heard<00:00:47.100> of<00:00:47.219> dpi<00:00:47.640> it<00:00:48.059> doesn't<00:00:48.840> mean<00:00:48.989> digital

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
heard of dpi it doesn't mean digital

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.650 
heard of dpi it doesn't mean digital
product<00:00:49.739> and<00:00:49.860> competence<00:00:50.309> it<00:00:50.640> means<00:00:50.910> dots<00:00:51.270> per

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
product and competence it means dots per

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.869 
product and competence it means dots per
inch<00:00:51.690> so<00:00:52.289> let's<00:00:52.770> look<00:00:52.890> at<00:00:53.010> a<00:00:53.039> digital<00:00:53.430> image<00:00:53.520> of

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
inch so let's look at a digital image of

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.450 
inch so let's look at a digital image of
I<00:00:54.210> don't<00:00:54.420> know<00:00:54.510> me<00:00:55.020> when<00:00:55.710> you<00:00:55.800> zoom<00:00:56.100> right<00:00:56.340> in

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
I don't know me when you zoom right in

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.010 
I don't know me when you zoom right in
on<00:00:56.520> my<00:00:56.699> eyeball<00:00:57.090> you<00:00:57.239> can<00:00:57.390> see<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.660> pixels

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
on my eyeball you can see the pixels

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.349 
on my eyeball you can see the pixels
little<00:00:58.620> individual<00:00:59.100> blocks<00:00:59.370> of<00:00:59.550> color<00:00:59.760> now

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
little individual blocks of color now

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.880 
little individual blocks of color now
when<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.660> inkjet<00:01:00.870> printer<00:01:01.289> prints<00:01:01.680> out<00:01:01.739> the

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
when the inkjet printer prints out the

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.560 
when the inkjet printer prints out the
picture<00:01:02.219> instead<00:01:02.670> of<00:01:02.820> making<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.120> little<00:01:03.359> color

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
picture instead of making a little color

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.119 
picture instead of making a little color
square<00:01:03.989> it<00:01:04.170> squirts<00:01:04.500> out<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.619> little<00:01:04.920> dot<00:01:05.100> of

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
square it squirts out a little dot of

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.920 
square it squirts out a little dot of
ink<00:01:05.400> if<00:01:05.549> it<00:01:05.970> puts<00:01:06.119> those<00:01:06.270> dots<00:01:06.540> closer

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
ink if it puts those dots closer

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.660 
ink if it puts those dots closer
together<00:01:07.200> you<00:01:07.560> get<00:01:07.680> a<00:01:07.740> sharper<00:01:08.250> smoother

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
together you get a sharper smoother

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.940 
together you get a sharper smoother
image<00:01:09.000> if<00:01:09.270> its<00:01:09.479> paces<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:09.990> farther<00:01:10.290> apart<00:01:10.409> the

image if its paces and farther apart the
resulting<00:01:11.400> image<00:01:11.640> is<00:01:11.790> grainy<00:01:12.180> photograph

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
resulting image is grainy photograph

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.359 
resulting image is grainy photograph

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
quality for an inkjet printer is

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.700 
quality for an inkjet printer is
typically<00:01:14.670> between<00:01:14.880> 200<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:15.689> 400<00:01:16.259> dpi<00:01:16.590> or

better while the images that are on the

internet are usually around 72 DPI yes
this<00:01:21.659> is<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.930> reason<00:01:22.080> why<00:01:22.320> pictures<00:01:22.710> printed

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
this is the reason why pictures printed

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.469 
this is the reason why pictures printed
from<00:01:23.159> your<00:01:23.310> friends<00:01:23.580> websites<00:01:24.000> look<00:01:24.210> dumpy

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
from your friends websites look dumpy

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.270 
from your friends websites look dumpy
but<00:01:25.290> isn't<00:01:25.409> digital<00:01:25.979> always<00:01:26.280> high<00:01:26.430> quality

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
but isn't digital always high quality

but isn't digital always high quality
pixels<00:01:29.280> are<00:01:29.400> really<00:01:29.610> important<00:01:30.090> more<00:01:30.659> pixels

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
pixels are really important more pixels

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.090 
pixels are really important more pixels
in<00:01:31.140> an<00:01:31.229> image<00:01:31.290> means<00:01:31.590> you<00:01:31.740> have<00:01:31.860> more

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
in an image means you have more

in an image means you have more
information<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:32.880> you<00:01:33.210> can<00:01:33.240> print<00:01:33.570> them

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
information and you can print them

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.450

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.679 
small image like 300 pixels by 150
pixels<00:01:38.040> you<00:01:38.400> can<00:01:38.549> change<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.909> DPI<00:01:39.090> all<00:01:39.540> you

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
pixels you can change the DPI all you

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.840 
pixels you can change the DPI all you
want<00:01:39.930> but<00:01:40.290> it<00:01:40.439> won't<00:01:40.470> print<00:01:40.829> well<00:01:41.040> even<00:01:41.670> if<00:01:41.759> you

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
want but it won't print well even if you

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:42.980 
want but it won't print well even if you
take<00:01:42.000> it<00:01:42.030> to<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.270> store<00:01:42.509> it<00:01:42.659> won't<00:01:42.810> look<00:01:42.930> good

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
take it to the store it won't look good

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.139 
take it to the store it won't look good
because<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:44.009> digital<00:01:44.369> information<00:01:44.610> just

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
because the digital information just

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.120 
because the digital information just
isn't<00:01:45.390> there<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:46.259> more<00:01:46.500> you<00:01:46.530> blow<00:01:46.829> it<00:01:46.979> up

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
isn't there and the more you blow it up

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.160 
isn't there and the more you blow it up
the<00:01:47.280> worse<00:01:47.460> it<00:01:47.640> will<00:01:47.729> look<00:01:47.939> if<00:01:48.149> you<00:01:48.659> have<00:01:48.810> image

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
the worse it will look if you have image

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.780 
the worse it will look if you have image
editing<00:01:49.500> software<00:01:49.560> like<00:01:50.100> adobe<00:01:50.460> photoshop

editing software like adobe photoshop
you<00:01:51.180> can<00:01:51.360> adjust<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.899> dots<00:01:52.110> per<00:01:52.380> inch<00:01:52.409> without

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
you can adjust the dots per inch without

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.740 
you can adjust the dots per inch without
changing<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.490> pixel<00:01:53.850> size<00:01:54.030> of<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.299> image<00:01:54.450> it

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
changing the pixel size of the image it

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.539 
changing the pixel size of the image it
just<00:01:55.229> makes<00:01:55.380> it<00:01:55.530> print<00:01:55.799> smaller<00:01:56.100> and<00:01:56.340> cleaner

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
just makes it print smaller and cleaner

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.700 
just makes it print smaller and cleaner
or<00:01:56.820> bigger<00:01:57.180> and<00:01:57.420> nastier<00:01:57.570> I<00:01:58.020> say<00:01:58.259> go<00:01:58.409> for<00:01:58.590> big

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
or bigger and nastier I say go for big

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.830 
or bigger and nastier I say go for big
nasty<00:01:59.009> because<00:01:59.520> it's<00:01:59.700> digital<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.570> kind<00:02:00.780> of
