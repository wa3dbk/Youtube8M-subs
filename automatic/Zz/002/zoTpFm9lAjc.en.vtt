00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.120 

I<00:00:05.800> think<00:00:06.800> we<00:00:07.550> go<00:00:07.670> to<00:00:07.730> a<00:00:07.850> dark-colored<00:00:08.240> top<00:00:09.130> and

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:10.130 
I think we go to a dark-colored top and

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:11.530 
I think we go to a dark-colored top and
so<00:00:10.309> we're<00:00:10.430> working<00:00:10.550> with<00:00:10.730> these<00:00:10.880> Copic<00:00:11.300> pens

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:11.540

nice<00:00:16.780> square<00:00:17.780> end<00:00:18.140> chisel<00:00:18.920> end<00:00:19.210> and<00:00:20.210> it<00:00:20.360> gives

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:20.570 
nice square end chisel end and it gives

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:26.560 
nice square end chisel end and it gives
us<00:00:20.810> a<00:00:21.170> clean<00:00:23.949> strip<00:00:24.949> of<00:00:25.220> color<00:00:25.519> and<00:00:26.240> what<00:00:26.449> we

us a clean strip of color and what we

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.450 
us a clean strip of color and what we
put<00:00:26.840> when<00:00:27.019> we<00:00:27.109> apply<00:00:27.380> this<00:00:27.439> to<00:00:27.650> the<00:00:27.769> paper<00:00:28.070> as

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.460 
put when we apply this to the paper as

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.030 
put when we apply this to the paper as
best<00:00:29.119> we<00:00:29.210> can<00:00:29.599> would<00:00:30.320> like<00:00:30.470> an<00:00:30.650> edge<00:00:30.740> to<00:00:30.769> edge

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:33.040 
best we can would like an edge to edge

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.020 
best we can would like an edge to edge
this<00:00:34.040> is<00:00:34.160> quite<00:00:34.370> a<00:00:34.400> good<00:00:34.460> color

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.030 
this is quite a good color

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:36.220 
this is quite a good color
it's<00:00:35.180> about<00:00:35.300> having<00:00:35.450> itself<00:00:35.960> and<00:00:36.140> you'll

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.230 
it's about having itself and you'll

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.310 
it's about having itself and you'll
notice<00:00:36.440> it's<00:00:36.710> pulling<00:00:37.100> flat<00:00:37.520> as<00:00:38.239> it<00:00:38.480> dries<00:00:38.840> you

notice it's pulling flat as it dries you

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.310 
notice it's pulling flat as it dries you

administration so let's just check if
I'm<00:02:14.440> good<00:02:14.590> enough<00:02:14.620> inking<00:02:15.280> this

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.690 

so<00:02:29.870> again<00:02:30.530> starting<00:02:31.070> from<00:02:31.100> the<00:02:31.310> left<00:02:31.490> hand

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
so again starting from the left hand

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:38.270 
so again starting from the left hand
side<00:02:32.440> working<00:02:33.440> around<00:02:33.860> the<00:02:34.040> hand

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.770 

I'm<00:02:38.790> gonna<00:02:38.910> get<00:02:39.120> to<00:02:39.240> the<00:02:39.330> bottom<00:02:39.510> I<00:02:39.720> will

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
I'm gonna get to the bottom I will

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.510 
I'm gonna get to the bottom I will
describe<00:02:40.319> some<00:02:40.380> of<00:02:40.680> them<00:02:40.800> into<00:02:41.069> intricate

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
describe some of them into intricate

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.770 
describe some of them into intricate
shape<00:02:43.430> try<00:02:44.430> and<00:02:44.550> keep<00:02:44.670> the<00:02:44.819> consistent<00:02:45.420> speed

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
shape try and keep the consistent speed

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.270 
shape try and keep the consistent speed
when<00:02:46.050> you're<00:02:46.170> going<00:02:46.319> to<00:02:46.410> all<00:02:46.560> run<00:02:46.800> like<00:02:47.040> this

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
when you're going to all run like this

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.850 
when you're going to all run like this
it'll<00:02:48.150> give<00:02:48.390> you<00:02:48.480> an<00:02:48.630> even<00:02:48.990> color<00:02:49.580> you<00:02:50.580> go<00:02:50.760> fast

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
it'll give you an even color you go fast

00:02:51.860 --> 00:03:17.230 
it'll give you an even color you go fast
they'll<00:02:52.860> be<00:02:52.980> less<00:02:53.220> color<00:02:53.580> if<00:02:53.970> you<00:02:54.150> go<00:02:54.330> smoothly

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:17.240 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.000 

so<00:03:17.810> I'm<00:03:17.900> noticing<00:03:18.080> that<00:03:18.380> my<00:03:18.470> pain<00:03:18.800> is<00:03:18.890> getting

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
so I'm noticing that my pain is getting

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.780 
so I'm noticing that my pain is getting
a<00:03:19.190> little<00:03:19.310> low<00:03:20.590> I'm<00:03:21.590> quite<00:03:21.830> fortunate<00:03:22.130> in<00:03:22.610> this

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
a little low I'm quite fortunate in this

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:54.180 
a little low I'm quite fortunate in this
case<00:03:26.440> if<00:03:27.440> it<00:03:27.590> does<00:03:27.800> do<00:03:28.010> that<00:03:28.220> just<00:03:28.760> go<00:03:29.210> along

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:59.490 

okay<00:03:55.000> so<00:03:55.480> the<00:03:55.600> escapes<00:03:55.870> building<00:03:58.290> now<00:03:59.290> when

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
okay so the escapes building now when

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:00.930 
okay so the escapes building now when
I've<00:03:59.560> got<00:03:59.740> quite<00:03:59.950> a<00:04:00.010> few<00:04:00.100> features<00:04:00.430> on<00:04:00.700> here

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
I've got quite a few features on here

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.750 
I've got quite a few features on here
but<00:04:01.090> across<00:04:01.390> over<00:04:01.600> some<00:04:02.380> drape<00:04:02.800> on<00:04:03.010> the<00:04:03.160> top<00:04:03.430> a

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
but across over some drape on the top a

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.150 
but across over some drape on the top a
solution<00:04:04.390> of<00:04:04.480> the<00:04:04.630> skirts<00:04:05.200> must<00:04:05.500> form<00:04:05.860> us<00:04:06.010> in

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
solution of the skirts must form us in

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.550 
solution of the skirts must form us in
the<00:04:06.220> bottom<00:04:06.370> here<00:04:06.700> and<00:04:07.000> what<00:04:07.960> I<00:04:07.990> like<00:04:08.200> to<00:04:08.230> use

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
the bottom here and what I like to use

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.270 
the bottom here and what I like to use
as<00:04:08.740> I<00:04:08.860> like<00:04:09.040> to<00:04:09.160> use<00:04:09.310> pastel<00:04:09.850> pencils<00:04:11.280> they're

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
as I like to use pastel pencils they're

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:20.270 
as I like to use pastel pencils they're
really<00:04:14.250> soft<00:04:15.250> but<00:04:16.180> intense<00:04:18.360> color<00:04:19.360> pencils

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
really soft but intense color pencils

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.430 
really soft but intense color pencils
now<00:04:21.280> I<00:04:21.310> can<00:04:21.580> use<00:04:21.910> to<00:04:22.390> help<00:04:22.570> to<00:04:22.660> describe<00:04:23.080> some

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
now I can use to help to describe some

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.220 
now I can use to help to describe some
of<00:04:23.470> the<00:04:23.620> detail<00:04:24.040> in<00:04:24.280> my<00:04:24.460> garment<00:04:25.080> now<00:04:26.080> I'm

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.230 
of the detail in my garment now I'm

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:27.780 
of the detail in my garment now I'm
looking<00:04:26.530> the<00:04:26.620> gray<00:04:26.800> garment<00:04:27.220> here

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:27.790 
looking the gray garment here

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:32.040 
looking the gray garment here
I<00:04:28.050> tend<00:04:29.050> to<00:04:29.440> again<00:04:30.130> use<00:04:30.400> quite<00:04:30.700> strong<00:04:31.450> colors

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
I tend to again use quite strong colors

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.980 
I tend to again use quite strong colors
that<00:04:32.350> pop<00:04:32.970> they'll<00:04:33.970> actually<00:04:34.120> jump<00:04:34.570> out<00:04:34.750> at

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 
that pop they'll actually jump out at

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.330 
that pop they'll actually jump out at
you<00:04:35.200> in<00:04:35.890> the<00:04:36.040> illustration<00:04:36.760> and<00:04:36.910> to<00:04:37.480> do<00:04:37.690> that<00:04:37.990> I

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
you in the illustration and to do that I

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.330 
you in the illustration and to do that I
use<00:04:39.340> the<00:04:40.710> complementary<00:04:41.710> colors<00:04:42.040> from<00:04:42.190> the

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
use the complementary colors from the

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.970 
use the complementary colors from the
color<00:04:42.370> wheel<00:04:42.780> so<00:04:43.780> just<00:04:44.110> very<00:04:44.290> quickly<00:04:44.440> over

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:44.980 
color wheel so just very quickly over

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:48.080 
color wheel so just very quickly over
here<00:04:45.340> you've<00:04:45.940> got<00:04:45.970> the<00:04:46.240> usual<00:04:46.480> color<00:04:46.930> wheel

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
here you've got the usual color wheel

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.460 
here you've got the usual color wheel
and<00:04:49.090> has<00:04:49.300> red<00:04:49.890> yellow<00:04:50.890> and<00:04:51.280> blue

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:52.470

and has red yellow and blue
primary<00:04:53.470> colors<00:04:53.970> then<00:04:54.970> you<00:04:55.060> have<00:04:55.210> a<00:04:55.240> secondary

00:04:59.340 --> 00:04:59.350 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:02.100 

and<00:04:59.740> there<00:04:59.950> are<00:05:00.070> three<00:05:00.310> of<00:05:00.340> those<00:05:00.610> and<00:05:01.300> each<00:05:01.930> of

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.110 
and there are three of those and each of

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:03.780 
and there are three of those and each of
these<00:05:02.200> secondary<00:05:02.620> colors<00:05:02.980> is<00:05:03.100> a<00:05:03.130> combination

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:03.790 
these secondary colors is a combination

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:05.520 
these secondary colors is a combination
of<00:05:03.880> those<00:05:04.030> two<00:05:04.360> so<00:05:04.690> red<00:05:04.870> and<00:05:05.020> yellow<00:05:05.140> makes

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:05.530 
of those two so red and yellow makes

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:08.790 
of those two so red and yellow makes
orange<00:05:05.800> we<00:05:06.460> don't<00:05:06.880> makes<00:05:07.120> purple<00:05:07.630> and<00:05:08.620> blue

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:08.800 
orange we don't makes purple and blue

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.700 
orange we don't makes purple and blue
and<00:05:08.950> yellow<00:05:09.070> makes<00:05:09.460> green<00:05:09.870> the<00:05:10.870> complementary

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
and yellow makes green the complementary

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:16.110 
and yellow makes green the complementary
colors<00:05:13.680> on<00:05:14.680> the<00:05:14.890> opposite<00:05:15.370> side<00:05:15.640> of<00:05:15.670> the<00:05:15.940> wheel

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.120 
colors on the opposite side of the wheel

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.450
