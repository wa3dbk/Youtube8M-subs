00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.740 
muted by the hinge covering it it's not
really<00:01:58.110> noticeable<00:01:58.409> it<00:01:58.950> is<00:01:59.189> slightly<00:01:59.750> quieter

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
really noticeable it is slightly quieter

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.080 
really noticeable it is slightly quieter
but<00:02:01.469> when<00:02:01.799> you<00:02:01.860> have<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.159> volume<00:02:02.490> of<00:02:02.610> Max<00:02:02.850> it

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
but when you have the volume of Max it

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.550 
but when you have the volume of Max it
really<00:02:03.420> does<00:02:03.630> not<00:02:03.810> make<00:02:04.049> too<00:02:04.079> much<00:02:04.350> of<00:02:04.409> a

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
really does not make too much of a

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.380 
really does not make too much of a
difference<00:02:04.920> so<00:02:05.369> that's<00:02:05.969> just<00:02:06.030> for<00:02:06.299> you<00:02:06.360> guys

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:11.980 
to see for yourselves i guess but as you
can<00:02:10.399> hear<00:02:10.670> from<00:02:10.819> the<00:02:10.940> video<00:02:11.180> the<00:02:11.510> sound<00:02:11.780> comes

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
can hear from the video the sound comes

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.890 
can hear from the video the sound comes
through<00:02:12.200> pretty<00:02:12.410> clear<00:02:12.680> i<00:02:13.330> can't<00:02:14.330> personally

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
through pretty clear i can't personally

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.650 
through pretty clear i can't personally
i<00:02:14.959> don't<00:02:15.020> really<00:02:15.260> notice<00:02:15.470> the<00:02:15.650> difference<00:02:16.660> so

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
i don't really notice the difference so
