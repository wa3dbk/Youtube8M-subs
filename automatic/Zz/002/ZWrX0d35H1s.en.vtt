has been out in a coma for a little
while<00:02:53.989> we<00:02:54.260> assume<00:02:54.560> I<00:02:54.680> believe<00:02:54.950> it<00:02:55.040> is<00:02:55.130> a<00:02:55.160> few

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
while we assume I believe it is a few

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.550 
while we assume I believe it is a few
months<00:02:55.760> and<00:02:56.230> essentially<00:02:57.230> a<00:02:57.260> zombie

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
months and essentially a zombie

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.890 
months and essentially a zombie
apocalypse<00:02:57.620> this<00:02:58.190> hit<00:02:58.400> it<00:02:59.120> is<00:02:59.300> just<00:02:59.630> like<00:02:59.780> the

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
apocalypse this hit it is just like the

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.610 
apocalypse this hit it is just like the
opening<00:03:00.350> to<00:03:00.760> 28<00:03:01.760> days<00:03:01.880> later<00:03:02.230> Robert<00:03:03.230> Kirkman

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
opening to 28 days later Robert Kirkman

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.740 
opening to 28 days later Robert Kirkman
says<00:03:03.860> that<00:03:04.130> he<00:03:04.670> didn't<00:03:04.940> copy<00:03:05.150> it<00:03:05.360> off<00:03:05.450> that

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
says that he didn't copy it off that

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.420 
says that he didn't copy it off that
they<00:03:06.050> were<00:03:06.110> both<00:03:06.410> writing<00:03:06.890> it<00:03:06.980> at<00:03:07.100> about<00:03:07.280> the

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
they were both writing it at about the

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.120 
they were both writing it at about the
same<00:03:07.610> time<00:03:07.670> and<00:03:08.500> Robert<00:03:09.500> Kirkman<00:03:09.800> had<00:03:09.950> that

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
same time and Robert Kirkman had that

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.300 
same time and Robert Kirkman had that
idea<00:03:10.519> and<00:03:11.410> you<00:03:12.410> know<00:03:12.500> he<00:03:12.650> went<00:03:12.830> with<00:03:13.010> that<00:03:13.160> and

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
idea and you know he went with that and

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:14.050 
idea and you know he went with that and
it<00:03:13.370> is<00:03:13.430> a<00:03:13.459> little<00:03:13.580> bit<00:03:13.700> different<00:03:13.970> because

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
it is a little bit different because

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.840 
it is a little bit different because
Rick<00:03:14.420> Grimes<00:03:14.570> is<00:03:14.840> a<00:03:14.870> police<00:03:15.140> officer<00:03:15.400> and<00:03:16.400> the

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
Rick Grimes is a police officer and the

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:18.610 
Rick Grimes is a police officer and the
way<00:03:17.000> he<00:03:17.239> goes<00:03:17.390> into<00:03:17.630> a<00:03:17.660> coma<00:03:17.810> is<00:03:18.019> he<00:03:18.140> gets<00:03:18.350> shot

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
way he goes into a coma is he gets shot

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
way he goes into a coma is he gets shot
on<00:03:18.860> duty<00:03:20.380> so<00:03:21.380> yeah<00:03:21.530> so<00:03:21.709> he<00:03:21.890> wakes<00:03:22.070> up<00:03:22.250> from<00:03:22.489> that

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
on duty so yeah so he wakes up from that

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.970 
on duty so yeah so he wakes up from that
and<00:03:22.989> essentially<00:03:23.989> a<00:03:24.110> zombie<00:03:24.410> apocalypse<00:03:24.500> has

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
and essentially a zombie apocalypse has

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.710 
and essentially a zombie apocalypse has
hit<00:03:25.250> now<00:03:25.670> you<00:03:25.790> get<00:03:26.060> to<00:03:26.209> follow<00:03:26.420> this

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
hit now you get to follow this

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.110 
hit now you get to follow this
character's<00:03:27.200> life<00:03:27.280> from<00:03:28.280> that<00:03:28.489> point<00:03:28.790> up

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
character's life from that point up

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.069 
character's life from that point up
until<00:03:29.269> issue<00:03:29.780> 80<00:03:30.230> at<00:03:30.440> this<00:03:30.620> point<00:03:30.890> which<00:03:31.640> is

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:32.079 
until issue 80 at this point which is

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:35.890 
until issue 80 at this point which is
essentially<00:03:33.079> over<00:03:33.829> a<00:03:34.070> year's<00:03:34.489> time<00:03:34.760> I<00:03:35.030> believe

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
essentially over a year's time I believe

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:36.940 
essentially over a year's time I believe
in<00:03:36.019> his<00:03:36.110> less<00:03:36.290> than<00:03:36.470> two<00:03:36.620> years<00:03:36.829> but

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
that happen the other thing that I think

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.010 
that happen the other thing that I think
makes<00:04:33.070> it<00:04:33.280> very<00:04:33.400> unique<00:04:33.729> is<00:04:33.910> how<00:04:34.090> realistic<00:04:34.840> he

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
makes it very unique is how realistic he

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.409 
makes it very unique is how realistic he
makes<00:04:35.289> it<00:04:35.500> in<00:04:36.039> this<00:04:36.430> zombie<00:04:36.850> world<00:04:37.000> okay<00:04:37.360> so

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:37.419 
makes it in this zombie world okay so

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:39.300 
makes it in this zombie world okay so
obviously<00:04:37.660> being<00:04:38.139> in<00:04:38.289> a<00:04:38.380> zombie<00:04:38.560> world<00:04:38.919> is<00:04:39.100> not

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
obviously being in a zombie world is not

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.710 
obviously being in a zombie world is not
realistic<00:04:39.850> I<00:04:40.270> mean<00:04:40.810> that's<00:04:40.990> obvious<00:04:41.470> however

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
realistic I mean that's obvious however

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.210 
realistic I mean that's obvious however
when<00:04:43.720> you<00:04:43.840> let<00:04:44.020> that<00:04:44.199> slip<00:04:44.620> if<00:04:44.830> you<00:04:44.949> if<00:04:45.100> you

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
when you let that slip if you if you

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.189 
when you let that slip if you if you
allow<00:04:45.460> that<00:04:45.490> to<00:04:45.970> slip<00:04:46.270> okay<00:04:46.570> now<00:04:46.690> moving<00:04:46.960> on

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:47.199 
allow that to slip okay now moving on

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:49.320 
allow that to slip okay now moving on
now<00:04:47.830> what<00:04:48.130> would<00:04:48.220> it<00:04:48.280> really<00:04:48.580> be<00:04:48.699> like<00:04:49.030> if<00:04:49.210> I

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330 
now what would it really be like if I

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.920 
now what would it really be like if I
was<00:04:49.630> in<00:04:49.660> that<00:04:49.870> world<00:04:50.199> and<00:04:51.240> that<00:04:52.240> is<00:04:52.510> where<00:04:52.750> at

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:52.930 
was in that world and that is where at

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.110 
was in that world and that is where at
what<00:04:53.080> I<00:04:53.110> mean<00:04:53.380> by<00:04:53.560> realistic<00:04:54.160> is<00:04:54.280> that<00:04:54.460> he

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
what I mean by realistic is that he

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.129 
what I mean by realistic is that he
makes<00:04:55.449> it<00:04:55.780> very<00:04:56.490> real<00:04:57.600> for<00:04:58.600> the<00:04:58.750> characters

00:04:59.129 --> 00:04:59.139 
makes it very real for the characters

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:02.040 
makes it very real for the characters
who<00:04:59.229> are<00:04:59.320> living<00:04:59.560> in<00:04:59.770> this<00:04:59.979> world<00:05:00.250> and<00:05:01.050> that's

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
who are living in this world and that's

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:03.900 
who are living in this world and that's
impressive<00:05:02.560> you<00:05:02.889> know<00:05:02.949> that's<00:05:03.220> not<00:05:03.400> easy<00:05:03.610> to

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:03.910 
impressive you know that's not easy to

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:05.820 
impressive you know that's not easy to
do<00:05:04.060> but<00:05:04.240> it<00:05:04.360> does<00:05:04.570> feel<00:05:04.870> very<00:05:04.900> authentic<00:05:05.800> very

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:05.830 
do but it does feel very authentic very

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.830 
do but it does feel very authentic very
real<00:05:06.280> the<00:05:06.699> things<00:05:06.940> that<00:05:07.090> happen<00:05:07.419> to<00:05:07.539> them<00:05:07.660> are

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 
real the things that happen to them are

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.330 
real the things that happen to them are
the<00:05:07.930> things<00:05:08.169> that<00:05:08.260> you<00:05:08.440> can<00:05:08.620> imagine<00:05:08.860> would

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:09.340 
the things that you can imagine would

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:12.180 
the things that you can imagine would
and<00:05:09.840> the<00:05:10.840> people<00:05:11.199> that<00:05:11.410> you<00:05:11.710> you<00:05:12.070> know

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.190 
and the people that you you know

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:14.339 
and the people that you you know
normally<00:05:13.030> you<00:05:13.180> would<00:05:13.300> think<00:05:13.479> obviously<00:05:14.139> this

00:05:14.339 --> 00:05:14.349 
normally you would think obviously this

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:16.650 
normally you would think obviously this
person's<00:05:14.650> going<00:05:14.830> to<00:05:14.919> survive<00:05:15.210> they<00:05:16.210> might<00:05:16.449> not

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:16.660 
person's going to survive they might not

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:19.050 
person's going to survive they might not
so<00:05:17.410> it<00:05:17.530> doesn't<00:05:17.830> always<00:05:17.979> work<00:05:18.099> out<00:05:18.520> that<00:05:18.760> way

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.060 
so it doesn't always work out that way

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:20.520 
so it doesn't always work out that way
where<00:05:19.389> it's<00:05:19.539> predictable<00:05:20.139> there's<00:05:20.349> no

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:20.530 
where it's predictable there's no

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:22.110 
where it's predictable there's no
predictability<00:05:21.130> here<00:05:21.520> at<00:05:21.610> all<00:05:21.699> you<00:05:21.849> cannot

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.120 
predictability here at all you cannot

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.790 
predictability here at all you cannot
predict<00:05:22.570> what's<00:05:22.750> going<00:05:22.900> to<00:05:22.930> happen<00:05:23.289> next<00:05:23.470> at

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:23.800 
predict what's going to happen next at

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.460 
predict what's going to happen next at
the<00:05:24.669> next<00:05:24.910> turn<00:05:25.120> or<00:05:25.419> at<00:05:25.479> the<00:05:25.570> end<00:05:25.690> of<00:05:25.870> each<00:05:26.229> at
