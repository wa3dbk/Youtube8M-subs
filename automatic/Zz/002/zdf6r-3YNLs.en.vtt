called you and I found out that you had
shaved<00:00:31.980> your<00:00:32.160> head<00:00:32.219> and<00:00:32.730> I<00:00:33.660> know<00:00:34.610> having<00:00:35.610> a

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
shaved your head and I know having a

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.680 
shaved your head and I know having a
woman<00:00:36.329> with<00:00:36.510> no<00:00:36.690> hair<00:00:37.370> is<00:00:38.370> not<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.239> most<00:00:39.450> ideal

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
woman with no hair is not the most ideal

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.450 
woman with no hair is not the most ideal
thing<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:40.469> for<00:00:40.680> a<00:00:40.710> lot<00:00:40.920> of<00:00:40.950> women<00:00:41.129> that's

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
thing and for a lot of women that's

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.930 
thing and for a lot of women that's
probably<00:00:42.890> one<00:00:43.890> of<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.070> suckiest<00:00:44.430> things<00:00:44.730> ever

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
probably one of the suckiest things ever

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.020 
probably one of the suckiest things ever
because<00:00:45.180> a<00:00:45.350> woman<00:00:46.350> can<00:00:47.070> be<00:00:47.250> defined<00:00:47.550> from<00:00:47.910> her

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
because a woman can be defined from her

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.670 
because a woman can be defined from her
hair<00:00:48.300> and<00:00:48.539> that's<00:00:48.750> something<00:00:49.050> that<00:00:49.200> they<00:00:49.440> love

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
hair and that's something that they love

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:56.029 
hair and that's something that they love
about<00:00:49.710> themselves<00:00:50.340> um<00:00:52.100> and<00:00:53.100> I<00:00:54.090> know<00:00:54.750> if<00:00:55.230> I<00:00:55.469> was
