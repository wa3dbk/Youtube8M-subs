expect<00:00:14.709> but<00:00:15.709> my<00:00:15.830> friend<00:00:16.129> said<00:00:16.219> it<00:00:16.400> was<00:00:16.520> okay

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:16.820 
expect but my friend said it was okay

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.490 
expect but my friend said it was okay
because<00:00:17.150> some<00:00:17.510> of<00:00:17.630> the<00:00:17.750> others<00:00:17.990> were<00:00:18.140> new<00:00:18.320> to

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:18.500 
because some of the others were new to

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.290 
because some of the others were new to
it<00:00:18.620> too<00:00:18.860> and<00:00:19.100> that<00:00:19.490> made<00:00:19.670> me<00:00:19.790> feel<00:00:19.910> a<00:00:20.120> lot

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:20.300 
it too and that made me feel a lot

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.740

although I was having a great time the

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:41.720 
although I was having a great time the

point of going fishing is to actually

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.309 
point of going fishing is to actually
catch<00:02:41.970> some<00:02:44.360> and<00:02:45.360> it<00:02:45.569> can<00:02:45.689> be<00:02:45.810> a<00:02:45.840> real<00:02:46.110> surprise

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
catch some and it can be a real surprise

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:48.140 
catch some and it can be a real surprise
when<00:02:46.980> you<00:02:47.010> think<00:02:47.340> you<00:02:47.459> have<00:02:47.640> a<00:02:47.670> fish<00:02:47.939> on<00:02:48.120> your

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
when you think you have a fish on your

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.819 
when you think you have a fish on your
line<00:02:48.299> but<00:02:48.959> sometimes<00:02:49.379> you<00:02:49.500> don't<00:02:49.680> always

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:49.829 
line but sometimes you don't always

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:52.429 
line but sometimes you don't always
catch<00:02:50.220> fish<00:02:50.489> and<00:02:50.819> in<00:02:51.030> my<00:02:51.180> case<00:02:51.420> I<00:02:51.689> was<00:02:52.200> the<00:02:52.319> one

00:02:52.429 --> 00:02:52.439 
catch fish and in my case I was the one

00:02:52.439 --> 00:03:01.330 
catch fish and in my case I was the one
who<00:02:52.590> was<00:02:52.680> getting<00:02:52.799> caught<00:02:53.159> and<00:02:53.370> not<00:02:53.670> the<00:02:53.909> fish

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.380 

fortunately<00:03:02.340> my<00:03:02.640> friends<00:03:02.940> were<00:03:03.030> having<00:03:03.180> a

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
fortunately my friends were having a

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:10.640 
fortunately my friends were having a
little<00:03:03.540> better<00:03:03.810> luck<00:03:04.050> than<00:03:04.260> me

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.380 

even<00:03:11.650> though<00:03:11.740> the<00:03:11.890> smallmouth<00:03:12.400> bass<00:03:12.700> were<00:03:13.180> not

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
even though the smallmouth bass were not

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:14.910 
even though the smallmouth bass were not
the<00:03:13.570> largest<00:03:13.840> you<00:03:14.080> can<00:03:14.260> touch<00:03:14.470> on<00:03:14.650> the<00:03:14.740> river

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
the largest you can touch on the river

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:39.180 
the largest you can touch on the river
it<00:03:15.430> was<00:03:15.640> still<00:03:15.880> exciting<00:03:16.000> and<00:03:16.510> a<00:03:16.570> lot<00:03:16.720> of<00:03:16.870> fun

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.620 

I<00:03:41.490> always<00:03:42.490> thought<00:03:42.760> fishing<00:03:43.150> was<00:03:43.300> something

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
I always thought fishing was something

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.020 
I always thought fishing was something
other<00:03:43.810> people<00:03:44.020> did<00:03:44.530> I<00:03:44.740> never<00:03:45.370> imagined<00:03:45.880> myself

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
other people did I never imagined myself

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.900 
other people did I never imagined myself

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:50.710 
my thing now I can't believe I've been

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:52.710
