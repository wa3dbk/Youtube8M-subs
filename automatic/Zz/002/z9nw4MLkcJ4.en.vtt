00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:42.069 
here with within the book and hcc have
said<00:02:40.790> that<00:02:40.940> they<00:02:41.150> do<00:02:41.209> have<00:02:41.450> real<00:02:41.690> there

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:42.079 
said that they do have real there

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
they're going to push for an update soon

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.490 
they're going to push for an update soon
and<00:02:45.140> hopefully<00:02:45.319> they<00:02:45.620> were<00:02:45.739> fast<00:02:46.540> so<00:02:47.540> i<00:02:48.109> will

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
and hopefully they were fast so i will

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.670 
and hopefully they were fast so i will
show<00:02:48.709> you<00:02:48.769> how<00:02:49.099> the<00:02:49.310> camera<00:02:49.970> are<00:02:50.090> really<00:02:50.389> works

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
show you how the camera are really works

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:56.949 
show you how the camera are really works
just<00:02:51.680> get<00:02:51.829> on<00:02:51.950> with<00:02:52.069> it<00:02:55.299> so<00:02:56.299> the<00:02:56.420> background<00:02:56.840> of

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
just get on with it so the background of

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.280 
just get on with it so the background of
the<00:02:57.109> 8<00:02:57.290> megapixel<00:02:57.500> camera<00:02:58.250> and<00:02:58.430> you<00:02:58.670> will<00:02:58.790> get

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
the 8 megapixel camera and you will get

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:09.440 
the 8 megapixel camera and you will get
some<00:03:00.290> nice<00:03:00.859> pictures

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.759 

so<00:03:10.050> as<00:03:10.379> you<00:03:10.590> can<00:03:10.739> see<00:03:10.980> here<00:03:12.379> it's<00:03:13.379> pretty

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
so as you can see here it's pretty

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:16.400 
so as you can see here it's pretty
decent<00:03:13.950> and<00:03:14.599> you<00:03:15.599> can<00:03:15.780> the<00:03:15.900> colors<00:03:16.200> are<00:03:16.349> really

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
decent and you can the colors are really

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.850 
decent and you can the colors are really
sharp<00:03:16.769> and<00:03:17.780> I<00:03:18.780> think<00:03:19.170> for<00:03:19.319> an<00:03:19.440> eighth<00:03:19.560> pick<00:03:19.769> a

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
sharp and I think for an eighth pick a

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.589 
sharp and I think for an eighth pick a
pixel<00:03:20.160> cameras<00:03:20.489> are<00:03:20.670> really<00:03:20.910> good<00:03:21.090> and<00:03:21.269> I<00:03:21.450> will

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:21.599 
pixel cameras are really good and I will

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:23.600 
pixel cameras are really good and I will
show<00:03:21.629> you<00:03:21.840> another<00:03:22.040> the<00:03:23.040> front<00:03:23.459> camera

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
show you another the front camera

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:29.750 
show you another the front camera
2-megapixel<00:03:24.420> camera<00:03:26.510> so<00:03:28.130> see<00:03:29.130> he<00:03:29.310> was<00:03:29.459> pretty

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
2-megapixel camera so see he was pretty

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.199 
2-megapixel camera so see he was pretty
decent<00:03:30.000> not<00:03:30.540> that<00:03:30.980> good<00:03:31.980> but<00:03:32.190> 2<00:03:32.489> megapixels<00:03:33.090> is

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
decent not that good but 2 megapixels is

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:40.910 
decent not that good but 2 megapixels is
good<00:03:33.420> for<00:03:33.599> the<00:03:33.630> front<00:03:33.900> camera<00:03:34.050> I<00:03:34.500> mean<00:03:38.239> so<00:03:39.920> the

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
good for the front camera I mean so the

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.199 
good for the front camera I mean so the
it<00:03:41.280> works<00:03:41.549> it's<00:03:42.090> on<00:03:43.010> 1.4<00:03:44.010> gigahertz<00:03:44.489> octa-core

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
it works it's on 1.4 gigahertz octa-core

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:48.500 
it works it's on 1.4 gigahertz octa-core
processor<00:03:45.870> which<00:03:45.989> is<00:03:46.110> really<00:03:46.290> fast<00:03:46.620> and<00:03:47.510> those

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
processor which is really fast and those

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.410 
processor which is really fast and those
1.4<00:03:49.319> sits<00:03:49.620> really<00:03:49.769> works<00:03:50.190> really<00:03:50.400> fast<00:03:50.700> Karan

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
1.4 sits really works really fast Karan

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.050 
still ok but some phone they're getting
a<00:06:30.410> thousand<00:06:30.770> ATP<00:06:31.130> from<00:06:31.220> here<00:06:31.460> also<00:06:31.699> and<00:06:31.790> from

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:32.060 
a thousand ATP from here also and from

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:33.700 
a thousand ATP from here also and from
you'll<00:06:32.240> also<00:06:32.419> which<00:06:33.080> is<00:06:33.229> there<00:06:33.380> not<00:06:33.530> because

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:33.710 
you'll also which is there not because

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:35.200 
you'll also which is there not because
problem<00:06:34.220> but<00:06:34.340> I<00:06:34.400> think<00:06:34.639> this<00:06:34.760> should<00:06:35.090> have

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:35.210 
problem but I think this should have

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:38.230 
problem but I think this should have
been<00:06:35.240> in<00:06:35.540> theory<00:06:36.020> the<00:06:36.110> pixel<00:06:36.440> a<00:06:37.240> slight

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:38.240 
been in theory the pixel a slight

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:41.530 
been in theory the pixel a slight
drawback<00:06:38.540> is<00:06:39.080> that<00:06:39.470> it<00:06:39.770> has<00:06:39.949> actually<00:06:40.580> six<00:06:40.790> HTC

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:41.540 
drawback is that it has actually six HTC

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:45.850 
drawback is that it has actually six HTC
Sense<00:06:42.130> 5.5<00:06:43.130> and<00:06:43.490> not<00:06:43.699> HTC<00:06:44.210> Sense<00:06:44.419> 6<00:06:44.780> she's<00:06:45.590> one

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:45.860 
Sense 5.5 and not HTC Sense 6 she's one

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:48.730 
Sense 5.5 and not HTC Sense 6 she's one
version<00:06:46.280> lower<00:06:46.490> for<00:06:46.940> the<00:06:46.970> sense<00:06:47.300> and<00:06:47.740> you

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:48.740 
version lower for the sense and you

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:50.650 
version lower for the sense and you
wonder<00:06:48.770> the<00:06:49.160> latest<00:06:49.550> version<00:06:49.669> of<00:06:50.000> length<00:06:50.479> free

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:50.660 
wonder the latest version of length free

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:52.120 
wonder the latest version of length free
as<00:06:50.780> you<00:06:50.840> can<00:06:51.020> see<00:06:51.199> here<00:06:51.380> the<00:06:51.530> radius<00:06:51.889> will<00:06:51.979> be

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:52.130 
as you can see here the radius will be

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:54.969 
as you can see here the radius will be
against<00:06:52.490> green<00:06:52.789> color<00:06:53.120> looks<00:06:53.449> more<00:06:53.690> nice<00:06:54.470> but

00:06:54.969 --> 00:06:54.979
