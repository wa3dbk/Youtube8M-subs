00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.470
 all that inertia was cut off by the roots 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:08.399
 by the avalanche of the group 

00:00:08.399 --> 00:00:10.399
 everything grows the opposite 

00:00:10.399 --> 00:00:14.019
 instead of the social struggle and taking the streets that he achieved in Cyprus he tried 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:17.619
 the young man who shuts himself up at home and gets depressed by himself in his room 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.859
 that overturn has made suspect that the fame of grunge and its presence in media 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.689
 was consciously augmented by the interests of the American state 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:30.789
 and that the constant invitation to the social struggle of combative rap was not only 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:33.800
 silenced but has been finally replaced 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.550
 the rap that calls the collective has disappeared and today the success albums 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.830
 He talks generally about how well he lives changing himself in big houses 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.830
 surrounded by chartis 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.980
 the presence of conspiranoia in pop has created many voluntary winks 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.270
 pink floyd of the song in you expense of the disc of one has a message to the 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.640
 back says congratulations you have found the secret message 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.860
 a well-known Spanish case of voluntary child 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.970
 it is the closing of the disc track 91 of heroes of silence that we are going to put 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.080
 historical effects 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.420
 - night 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.390
 this decision leaves however 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.560
 humberto flowers abuse mutualism conserve it for children 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.730
 the Chinese labor market has promised as his coach to go 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.220
 the great simplistic message 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.220
 I'm really surprised 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.960
 In Spain, pop-rock as a satanic vehicle is a message 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.220
 that has not set 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.870
 because we generally assume the invasions of foreign popular culture from 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.870
 the conviction that we are helpless before the avalanche 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.290
 first it's time to assimilate the French drivers then touch similar ones 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.280
 rockers jones that took decades to revive the flamenco zarzuela 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.260
 because you are if they depend on us and do not invade us by themselves 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.420
 so in Spain the search for hidden messages in rock 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.929
 it has not been a priority 

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:01.270
 because we have not considered it relevant 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.100
 however the variant colt of music that does worry us a lot 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.920
 and that again shows that it is 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.480
 a mirror of what we are the place where we are outraged by hidden messages is 

00:02:13.109 --> 00:02:15.249
 in children's music 

00:02:15.249 --> 00:02:18.439
 the place where we are outraged by hidden messages is 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:21.389
 in children's music 

00:02:21.389 --> 00:02:25.349
 that is the sacrosanct music for our group the children should be 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:27.780
 protected even from those who do not understand 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.069
 and we are alerted if children's songs offer messages backwards 

00:02:33.419 --> 00:02:36.909
 a curious case 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:40.299
 a curious case is the tuning of the champions animation series 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:43.749
 that most of us know as oliver and benji apparently in his refrain 

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:46.209
 hides a joint message 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:49.209
 judge yourself 

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:58.309
 banega 

00:03:06.899 --> 00:03:09.899
 we repeat what is asked 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:13.049
 If you are sick, repeat 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:16.199
 to access it 

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:17.499
 there 

00:03:17.499 --> 00:03:20.499
 parallel 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:24.129
 but probably the case was immediately sorry 

00:03:24.679 --> 00:03:26.769
 but clearly the most shocking case 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:30.639
 The one that most impacts the Spanish collective is the presence of messages 

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:33.959
 hidden in the songs nothing less than the clowns on TV 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:40.219
 Spanish parents are still trusting filo and miliki encarrilÃ³ in the 

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:42.680
 training your little ones and I tell you so 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.050
 do I have to listen to the tape repeatedly every time I visit 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:47.239
 my nephews 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:51.239
 so listen to find messages when playing your songs back 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:53.329
 It generates a serious concern 

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:56.589
 against the tradition of hidden sound hunters 

00:03:56.589 --> 00:04:00.669
 the five who fired the hunt in the clown songs have not been 

00:04:00.669 --> 00:04:03.969
 members of a protection association of nothing if not the 

00:04:03.969 --> 00:04:07.359
 Basque designers that has in its web in tracksuit same point com 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:11.349
 and they studied the clowns it was because they first found 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:15.729
 this solo issue of miliki that hid a message directed with 

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:18.370
 known pilot of Formula 1 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.370
 joaquin esteban contreras fornelli that thesis 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:26.800
 this regime does not bother me so I left her alone 

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:31.939
 alonso off track rommel moreno manjarrez 

00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:38.279
 later and night 

00:04:41.809 --> 00:04:44.050
 this discovery 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.430
 he directed them to look at the pieces of his stage with gaby and forced 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.129
 so they found 

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:52.939
 this curious police party 

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:57.499
 so they found this curious pieces of subliminal advertising that invites us to 

00:04:57.499 --> 00:05:00.499
 go to a well-known hamburger chain 

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:25.839
 among the really incorrect messages we find them in two themes that have 

00:05:25.839 --> 00:05:28.499
 spent decades being and not 

00:05:28.499 --> 00:05:31.009
 first 

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:32.509
 the hen Turuleca 

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:33.470
 what's wrong with it 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:36.470
 an invitation to oral sex 

00:05:48.319 --> 00:05:49.949
 and finally 

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:53.940
 the piece with which they appeared every day on national television 

00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:58.550
 quique in which they confess nothing less than 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:01.550
 pro abortionists 

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:05.949
