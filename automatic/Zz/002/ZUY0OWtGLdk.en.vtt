good<00:00:06.100> morning<00:00:06.520> folks<00:00:07.090> the<00:00:07.300> big<00:00:07.479> question

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:07.990 
good morning folks the big question

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:10.049 
good morning folks the big question
yesterday<00:00:08.469> was<00:00:08.680> how<00:00:08.860> big<00:00:09.250> of<00:00:09.309> a<00:00:09.490> solar<00:00:09.760> flare

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:10.059 
yesterday was how big of a solar flare

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:12.420 
yesterday was how big of a solar flare
would<00:00:10.360> be<00:00:10.510> needed<00:00:10.840> to<00:00:10.870> produce<00:00:11.049> that<00:00:11.799> backside

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:12.430 
would be needed to produce that backside

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:13.289 
would be needed to produce that backside
kill<00:00:12.820> shot

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:13.299

the massive CME in truth there was

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.710 
the massive CME in truth there was
likely<00:00:16.810> not<00:00:17.260> a<00:00:17.470> large<00:00:17.830> flare<00:00:18.190> involved<00:00:18.820> and<00:00:18.970> no

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:19.720 
likely not a large flare involved and no

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.380 
likely not a large flare involved and no
