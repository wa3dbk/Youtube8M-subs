chuck<00:00:14.519> now<00:00:15.299> when<00:00:15.929> we<00:00:16.680> think<00:00:16.949> of<00:00:17.220> burgers<00:00:17.789> we

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
chuck now when we think of burgers we

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.179 
chuck now when we think of burgers we
often<00:00:18.359> go<00:00:18.539> to<00:00:18.600> the<00:00:18.930> grocery<00:00:19.470> store<00:00:19.500> and<00:00:19.980> we

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
often go to the grocery store and we

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.359 
often go to the grocery store and we
pick<00:00:20.400> up<00:00:20.430> ground<00:00:21.359> beef<00:00:21.600> and<00:00:21.869> an<00:00:22.800> important

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
thing to remember is look at the label

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.599

because<00:00:27.090> all<00:00:27.330> labels<00:00:28.050> have<00:00:28.289> a<00:00:28.320> fat<00:00:28.740> content<00:00:29.400> on

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
because all labels have a fat content on

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.319 
because all labels have a fat content on
them<00:00:30.029> so<00:00:30.779> not<00:00:31.470> all<00:00:31.800> ground<00:00:32.430> beefs<00:00:32.790> are<00:00:33.090> the

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
them so not all ground beefs are the

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.600 
them so not all ground beefs are the
same<00:00:33.630> there's<00:00:34.050> ground<00:00:34.290> sirloin<00:00:34.680> ground
