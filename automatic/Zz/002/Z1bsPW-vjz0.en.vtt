still<00:00:07.410> be<00:00:07.589> on<00:00:07.770> on<00:00:08.099> right<00:00:09.090> here<00:00:09.210> your<00:00:09.570> can

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
still be on on right here your can

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.600 
still be on on right here your can
that's<00:00:10.050> on<00:00:10.230> the<00:00:10.320> back<00:00:10.500> which<00:00:11.190> is<00:00:11.400> just

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
that's on the back which is just

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.070 
that's on the back which is just
underneath<00:00:11.910> this<00:00:12.210> exhaust<00:00:12.599> shield<00:00:12.900> right

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
underneath this exhaust shield right

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.990 
underneath this exhaust shield right
here<00:00:13.320> here's<00:00:14.009> the<00:00:14.130> exhaust<00:00:14.400> shield<00:00:14.639> I<00:00:14.759> talked

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
here here's the exhaust shield I talked

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.200 
here here's the exhaust shield I talked
about<00:00:15.120> right<00:00:15.960> there<00:00:16.199> I<00:00:16.410> think<00:00:16.920> it's<00:00:17.190> a<00:00:17.699> few

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
about right there I think it's a few

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.750 
about right there I think it's a few
bolts<00:00:18.449> for<00:00:19.170> them<00:00:19.410> and<00:00:19.650> that<00:00:20.310> comes<00:00:20.580> right<00:00:20.699> off

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
bolts for them and that comes right off

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.609 
bolts for them and that comes right off
and<00:00:21.090> then<00:00:21.150> that<00:00:21.420> will<00:00:21.750> show<00:00:21.900> you<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:22.080> top<00:00:22.560> of

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
and then that will show you the top of

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.900 
and then that will show you the top of
the<00:00:22.859> can<00:00:23.070> and<00:00:24.650> then<00:00:25.650> your<00:00:25.830> two<00:00:26.070> exhaust<00:00:26.609> pipes

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
the can and then your two exhaust pipes

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.210 
the can and then your two exhaust pipes
are<00:00:27.119> going<00:00:27.269> through<00:00:27.630> here<00:00:27.960> and<00:00:28.080> they<00:00:28.949> go<00:00:29.070> up

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
are going through here and they go up

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.950 
are going through here and they go up
and<00:00:29.279> they<00:00:29.369> hook<00:00:29.580> to<00:00:29.699> these<00:00:29.820> which<00:00:30.570> goes<00:00:30.810> to

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
and they hook to these which goes to

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.450 
and they hook to these which goes to
that<00:00:31.820> once<00:00:32.820> you<00:00:32.969> get<00:00:33.149> to<00:00:33.719> this<00:00:33.840> point<00:00:34.460> to

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
that once you get to this point to

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.350 
that once you get to this point to
remove<00:00:35.969> these<00:00:37.219> there<00:00:38.219> is<00:00:38.250> a<00:00:38.489> bracket<00:00:38.760> which<00:00:39.329> is

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
remove these there is a bracket which is

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.830 
remove these there is a bracket which is
right<00:00:39.629> here<00:00:40.940> here's<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.120> bracket<00:00:42.540> and<00:00:42.690> you

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
right here here's the bracket and you

don't<00:00:43.020> see<00:00:43.260> this<00:00:43.469> bracket<00:00:43.920> because<00:00:44.070> it's

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
don't see this bracket because it's

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.069 
don't see this bracket because it's
right<00:00:44.969> in<00:00:45.300> here

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
right in here

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.779 
right in here
these<00:00:46.950> four<00:00:47.629> on<00:00:48.629> each<00:00:48.690> side<00:00:48.899> rivets<00:00:49.789> you'll

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
these four on each side rivets you'll

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.569 
these four on each side rivets you'll
see<00:00:50.969> them<00:00:51.149> you'll<00:00:51.690> have<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:51.870> drill<00:00:52.140> those<00:00:52.320> out

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:52.579 
see them you'll have to drill those out

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:56.270 
see them you'll have to drill those out
because<00:00:53.579> this<00:00:53.879> here<00:00:54.270> is<00:00:54.420> hooked<00:00:55.170> into<00:00:55.920> these

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
because this here is hooked into these

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.330 
because this here is hooked into these
things<00:00:56.610> like<00:00:57.180> this<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:58.370> you<00:00:59.370> can't<00:01:01.340> remove

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
things like this and you can't remove

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.590 
things like this and you can't remove
the<00:01:02.879> Y<00:01:03.570> pipes<00:01:04.159> because<00:01:05.159> they're<00:01:05.850> u-shaped

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
the Y pipes because they're u-shaped

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.929 
the Y pipes because they're u-shaped
see<00:01:07.020> so<00:01:07.770> when<00:01:07.920> you<00:01:07.979> try<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.189> pull<00:01:08.430> back<00:01:08.610> on<00:01:08.670> the
