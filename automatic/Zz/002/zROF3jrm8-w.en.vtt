00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.880
 social movements are sober 

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:04.920
 generations backed by 955 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.160
 represent 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.839
 its site operational group 

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:11.839
 in the youth series I choose sports 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.280
 place to inspect m there so on 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.750
 resilience 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.860
 daimon offended me for yesterday 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.330
 however speak openly 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:40.620
 Singapore 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.030
 question yes I think it is a branch 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:45.980
 it will actually be interesting to know 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.980
 saturday 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.880
 in the segment screaming tribune however even 4 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.430
 October 5 did not arise such 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.740
 satellite direction 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:58.470
 television 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:00.100
 in our region only gaining 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.780
 turns but it is worth noting that with 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.750
 high speed this is only a year ago 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.060
 Kindergarten pupils number 25 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.510
 for the following first concert while 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.250
 today extra units 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.560
 technology in 26 there is a premiere 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.150
 there is little but still 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.560
 understanding under your feet 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.729
 and when not necessary, I went to visit 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:20.540
 obvious in chelyabinsk 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.460
 and every year a year goes by 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.460
 just yesterday we arrived productions 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.040
 and if the rate is on average every year 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.380
 it's obvious now 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.619
 25 people are recognized as two age 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:33.409
 groups 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:35.869
 preschool and school parents lead 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:37.300
 children from different regions 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.370
 this trade secret attracts one 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.070
 the fact that they play sports 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.070
 what are you doing in training 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.110
 a few days uk 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.150
 and not as serious as they say 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.119
 not only that heating tariffs 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:00.560
 they already had time to feel 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.829
 competitive spirit and therefore specialists 

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:04.939
 declare that everyone saw this sports 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:06.499
 dances that require constant 

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:09.499
 four-wheel drive 

00:02:14.149 --> 00:02:17.149
 h 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:21.119
 in the end of May 

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:24.119
 finally we 

00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:27.099
 ranked first 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:30.099
 and left 

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:46.149
 I do not have 

00:02:46.149 --> 00:02:48.629
 until the Germans have a team with whom we 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:49.370
 performed 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.030
 multiple stations striving to reach 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.030
 the highest point of the country 

00:02:57.619 --> 00:03:00.399
 however the main 

00:03:00.399 --> 00:03:02.719
 I understand that every kind of popularity 

00:03:02.719 --> 00:03:03.929
 need 

00:03:03.929 --> 00:03:05.429
 while they diligently pull 

00:03:05.429 --> 00:03:07.229
 socks and sit on the splits 

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:09.619
 all this is not easy but they were taught 

00:03:09.619 --> 00:03:11.509
 always smile even if arise 

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:13.619
 difficulties these artists must crush and 

00:03:13.619 --> 00:03:16.089
 other drinks as well as well-spent 

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:19.089
 advances in each frame 

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:22.000
 because there 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 dad peers 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:32.089
 as expected first end of the tunnel 

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:34.899
 and that's why 

00:03:34.899 --> 00:03:37.629
 she girls almost a third of respondents 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:39.149
 and here I am 

00:03:39.149 --> 00:03:42.149
 liked 

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:47.659
 what's the hardest job newship 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:51.379
 she herself tells 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:54.309
 mostly it is not very much 

00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:56.159
 because they understand that is unusual 

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:57.840
 for our city sports 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.950
 but because he already knows and understands what is 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:01.759
 healthy active lifestyle 

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:04.759
 and what prospects opens up in the future 

00:04:09.899 --> 00:04:11.969
 and when all the information is from today 

00:04:11.969 --> 00:04:13.089
 tomorrow i r 

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:15.139
 we already together with artem we will tell 

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:17.529
