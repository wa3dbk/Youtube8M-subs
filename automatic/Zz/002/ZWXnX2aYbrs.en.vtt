00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 in the previous video you have a way 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.290
 of preparation of the perfect mass 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.870
 Now I'll explain to you how 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.599
 cut the cake that this is to think 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:16.379
 to receive the South American Cup 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:21.260
 this rumor made the same mass shocks 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.260
 I made only one recipe 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:30.300
 I'll use the fact more or less of the 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:34.980
 same size and I'm going to measure a finger here 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:41.690
 to cut more or less feeling it 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:41.690
 cake of 25/10 fame gets bigger 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:50.270
 impress knife to the end without all the 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.270
 hand 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:59.329
 I'm safe on top by pressing the cake 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.329
 you have firmness and have been cutting 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:33.460
 3rd is soft not wet easy break 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:38.229
 ok you want just one example of that pie 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:45.030
 please take as an example only the 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:45.030
 second part the same thing works 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:12.930
 It's good 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:18.620
 I need a little team in case here it is only 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.620
 cut like this does not break 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:33.450
 after you cut it you need a 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:42.480
 a step that covers the entire 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:43.530
 side of the sheet which has been 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.440
 inside 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:53.640
 so you can stay a little bit 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:03:02.240
 time that is left little to do 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:03:02.240
 with the bottom part of the already wet trunk 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.890
 the fondant cap has to be 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:11.420
 with a tail can not be 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.420
 wet as plate 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:31.430
 You interned with the trade of that wrong 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:37.370
 to the cause of water and sugar being soft the cake 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:40.700
 This is already wet, the filling has to 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:44.860
 be the stuffing movie stuffing 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:48.080
 sweet milk fritter 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:53.390
 I can not move very soft because 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:55.660
 only the deep paste the heavy paste sinks 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:55.660
 no bo 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:27.570
 you can wet a donkey of pasta 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:31.050
 fearless American being with calculations 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.050
 nothing comics 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:51.660
 you come the second part of learning 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:51.660
 and always raising organized water 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.130
 1 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:27.379
 always following the same procedure 

00:06:24.379 --> 00:06:27.379
 layer 

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:26.160
 the joke was full spread right 

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:26.160
 the cake
