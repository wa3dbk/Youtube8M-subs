think<00:02:13.260> then<00:02:14.260> with<00:02:14.470> my<00:02:14.739> law<00:02:15.400> firm<00:02:15.430> blue<00:02:16.030> I'm

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
think then with my law firm blue I'm

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.000 
think then with my law firm blue I'm
getting<00:02:16.780> these<00:02:16.930> power<00:02:17.200> cables<00:02:17.590> hanging<00:02:17.770> now

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
getting these power cables hanging now

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.920 
getting these power cables hanging now
from<00:02:18.280> that<00:02:18.459> flamer<00:02:18.819> just<00:02:19.450> because<00:02:19.690> I<00:02:19.870> think

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
from that flamer just because I think

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.380 
from that flamer just because I think
power<00:02:20.920> cables<00:02:21.310> look<00:02:21.489> better<00:02:21.910> when<00:02:22.209> they're<00:02:22.360> a

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
power cables look better when they're a

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.570 
power cables look better when they're a
gluey<00:02:22.870> bluey<00:02:23.349> color<00:02:25.080> onto<00:02:26.080> my<00:02:26.230> known<00:02:26.680> oil<00:02:26.950> I'm

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
gluey bluey color onto my known oil I'm

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.650 
gluey bluey color onto my known oil I'm
basically<00:02:28.290> washing<00:02:29.290> or<00:02:29.680> shading<00:02:30.160> everything

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
basically washing or shading everything

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.449 
basically washing or shading everything
so<00:02:31.660> I<00:02:32.140> just<00:02:32.680> want<00:02:32.860> to<00:02:32.950> get<00:02:33.010> it<00:02:33.160> in<00:02:33.220> all<00:02:33.340> the<00:02:33.430> way

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
so I just want to get it in all the way

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:36.030 
so I just want to get it in all the way
something<00:02:33.790> I'm<00:02:34.000> not<00:02:34.209> doing<00:02:34.630> is<00:02:34.870> the<00:02:35.349> gold<00:02:35.620> but

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
something I'm not doing is the gold but

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.390 
something I'm not doing is the gold but
I'm<00:02:37.000> the<00:02:37.209> second<00:02:37.569> thought<00:02:37.840> now<00:02:38.260> I'm<00:02:38.769> looking

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400

getting the crest don't just slap it all
over<00:02:47.049> the<00:02:47.140> may<00:02:47.290> surface<00:02:47.620> areas<00:02:47.830> because<00:02:48.010> it's

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
over the may surface areas because it's

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.770 
over the may surface areas because it's
gonna<00:02:48.280> take<00:02:48.489> forever<00:02:48.700> to<00:02:48.970> go<00:02:49.090> back<00:02:49.299> over<00:02:49.450> and
