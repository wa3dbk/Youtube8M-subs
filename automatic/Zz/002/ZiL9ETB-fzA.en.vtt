cut off the second is they have to have

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:25.980 
cut off the second is they have to have
an<00:00:24.430> inner<00:00:24.580> geek<00:00:24.850> and<00:00:25.180> you<00:00:25.570> know<00:00:25.660> we<00:00:25.750> have<00:00:25.869> a<00:00:25.900> way

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:25.990 
an inner geek and you know we have a way

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.349 
an inner geek and you know we have a way
of<00:00:26.109> testing<00:00:26.320> that<00:00:26.560> but<00:00:26.980> essentially<00:00:27.310> we<00:00:28.180> want

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:28.359 
of testing that but essentially we want

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:30.890 
of testing that but essentially we want
to<00:00:28.449> know<00:00:28.570> that<00:00:28.810> they<00:00:28.960> are<00:00:29.250> accomplished

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
to know that they are accomplished

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.689 
to know that they are accomplished
analytical<00:00:31.980> they<00:00:32.980> know<00:00:33.100> how<00:00:33.250> to<00:00:33.280> structure

00:00:33.689 --> 00:00:33.699 
analytical they know how to structure

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:35.790 
analytical they know how to structure
and<00:00:33.970> solve<00:00:34.180> a<00:00:34.330> problem<00:00:34.600> the<00:00:35.470> amount<00:00:35.650> of

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 
and solve a problem the amount of

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.439 
and solve a problem the amount of
information<00:00:36.010> the<00:00:36.460> complexity<00:00:37.000> the<00:00:37.089> problems

00:00:37.439 --> 00:00:37.449 
information the complexity the problems

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:40.170 
information the complexity the problems
it's<00:00:37.540> gotten<00:00:37.780> so<00:00:37.960> great<00:00:38.229> that<00:00:39.040> you<00:00:39.489> have<00:00:39.790> to<00:00:40.000> be

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:40.180 
it's gotten so great that you have to be

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.410 
it's gotten so great that you have to be
able<00:00:40.449> to<00:00:40.720> pick<00:00:40.960> up<00:00:40.989> the<00:00:41.949> tools<00:00:42.370> for<00:00:42.820> slicing

and dicing the state and that takes an

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.479 
and dicing the state and that takes an
inner<00:00:45.909> geek<00:00:46.379> most<00:00:47.379> people<00:00:47.710> who<00:00:47.920> come<00:00:47.979> to<00:00:48.309> work

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:01.150 
airport test which is we essentially let

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.509 
airport test which is we essentially let
the<00:01:01.269> associates<00:01:01.809> here<00:01:02.080> decide<00:01:02.500> who<00:01:03.369> were

00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:03.519 
the associates here decide who were

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:05.250 
the associates here decide who were
ultimately<00:01:03.850> going<00:01:04.239> to<00:01:04.390> hire<00:01:04.600> we've<00:01:04.989> got<00:01:05.229> to

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:05.260 
ultimately going to hire we've got to

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.010 
ultimately going to hire we've got to
get<00:01:05.409> through<00:01:05.590> certain<00:01:06.040> minimum<00:01:07.020> requirements

of intelligence problem-solving
analytics<00:01:11.020> but<00:01:11.710> ultimately<00:01:12.520> it's<00:01:12.729> about

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:12.820 
analytics but ultimately it's about

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.510 
analytics but ultimately it's about
about<00:01:13.450> fit<00:01:13.750> as<00:01:13.960> well<00:01:13.990> and<00:01:14.560> if<00:01:14.829> you<00:01:14.950> can't<00:01:15.219> pass

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
about fit as well and if you can't pass

about fit as well and if you can't pass
the<00:01:15.729> pittsburgh<00:01:16.149> airport<00:01:16.390> test<00:01:16.840> which<00:01:17.079> is

00:01:17.099 --> 00:01:17.109 
the pittsburgh airport test which is

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:18.870 
the pittsburgh airport test which is
would<00:01:17.439> you<00:01:17.469> want<00:01:17.770> to<00:01:17.829> be<00:01:17.920> stuck<00:01:18.189> with<00:01:18.490> jamie

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
would you want to be stuck with jamie

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.410 
would you want to be stuck with jamie
and<00:01:19.180> pittsburgh<00:01:19.990> for<00:01:20.229> three<00:01:20.439> hours<00:01:21.119> then<00:01:22.119> you

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
and pittsburgh for three hours then you

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.359 
and pittsburgh for three hours then you
don't<00:01:22.509> get<00:01:22.659> an<00:01:22.780> offer<00:01:22.960> the<00:01:23.740> ahmanson<00:01:24.070> culture

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:24.369 
don't get an offer the ahmanson culture

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:27.840 
don't get an offer the ahmanson culture
I<00:01:24.399> think<00:01:24.460> comes<00:01:24.789> from<00:01:26.159> having<00:01:27.159> a<00:01:27.369> pretty<00:01:27.520> flat

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
I think comes from having a pretty flat

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.529 
I think comes from having a pretty flat
structure<00:01:28.859> it<00:01:29.859> is<00:01:30.039> not<00:01:30.369> very<00:01:30.399> hierarchical<00:01:31.240> a

00:01:31.529 --> 00:01:31.539 
structure it is not very hierarchical a

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:34.230 
structure it is not very hierarchical a
typical<00:01:31.960> team<00:01:32.200> sometimes<00:01:32.770> will<00:01:33.249> be<00:01:33.429> you<00:01:34.090> know

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
typical team sometimes will be you know

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.569 
typical team sometimes will be you know
me<00:01:34.659> maybe<00:01:35.289> a<00:01:35.409> senior<00:01:35.950> consultant<00:01:36.490> or

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:36.579 
me maybe a senior consultant or

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:38.399 
me maybe a senior consultant or
principal<00:01:37.030> and<00:01:37.210> an<00:01:37.299> associate<00:01:37.840> or<00:01:37.899> two<00:01:38.109> so<00:01:38.380> I

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:38.409 
principal and an associate or two so I

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:39.959 
principal and an associate or two so I
think<00:01:38.560> it's<00:01:38.649> a<00:01:38.679> very<00:01:38.770> inquisitive<00:01:39.070> culture<00:01:39.789> I

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:39.969 
think it's a very inquisitive culture I

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:44.190 
think it's a very inquisitive culture I
think<00:01:40.390> it's<00:01:41.320> a<00:01:41.499> very<00:01:41.789> you<00:01:42.789> know<00:01:42.820> fact<00:01:43.479> and<00:01:43.810> data

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
think it's a very you know fact and data

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.739 
think it's a very you know fact and data
oriented<00:01:44.619> culture<00:01:45.039> don't<00:01:45.429> tell<00:01:45.729> me<00:01:45.909> what<00:01:46.149> you

data shows and clients appreciate that

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:52.289 
data shows and clients appreciate that
because<00:01:50.950> they<00:01:51.219> know<00:01:51.340> the<00:01:51.460> quality<00:01:51.729> of<00:01:51.969> what<00:01:52.179> we

this is a very interesting time in the
pharmaceutical<00:02:29.900> industry<00:02:30.170> I<00:02:30.470> think<00:02:30.590> we<00:02:30.800> have

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
pharmaceutical industry I think we have

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.130 
pharmaceutical industry I think we have
some<00:02:31.040> unique<00:02:31.280> data<00:02:31.880> and<00:02:32.209> some<00:02:32.450> unique<00:02:32.750> skills

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
some unique data and some unique skills

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.890 
some unique data and some unique skills
and<00:02:33.560> that<00:02:34.520> the<00:02:34.640> experience<00:02:35.150> that<00:02:35.209> anyone<00:02:35.690> get

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
and that the experience that anyone get

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.130 
and that the experience that anyone get
would<00:02:36.200> get<00:02:36.380> working<00:02:36.830> here<00:02:37.100> will<00:02:37.820> be

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
would get working here will be

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.360 
would get working here will be
transferable<00:02:39.140> anywhere<00:02:39.650> else<00:02:39.770> in<00:02:39.950> healthcare

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
transferable anywhere else in healthcare

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.790 
transferable anywhere else in healthcare
and<00:02:40.550> in<00:02:40.940> a<00:02:41.030> lot<00:02:41.120> of<00:02:41.180> industries<00:02:41.660> that<00:02:42.230> use<00:02:42.290> big

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
and in a lot of industries that use big

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.160 
and in a lot of industries that use big
data

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.760 

so<00:02:47.890> most<00:02:48.340> people<00:02:48.520> don't<00:02:48.849> know<00:02:48.970> this<00:02:49.240> but<00:02:49.510> I<00:02:50.319> we
