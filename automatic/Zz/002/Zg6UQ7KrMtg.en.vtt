there<00:01:40.590> are<00:01:40.710> two<00:01:40.920> launchers<00:01:41.340> so<00:01:41.490> you<00:01:41.610> can<00:01:41.759> use

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
there are two launchers so you can use

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.760 
there are two launchers so you can use
to<00:01:42.119> get<00:01:42.240> yourself<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:42.750> just<00:01:42.990> about<00:01:43.290> any<00:01:43.500> point

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770

on<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:43.979> map<00:01:44.009> and<00:01:44.340> rather<00:01:44.549> quick<00:01:44.880> time<00:01:45.119> it's

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
on the map and rather quick time it's

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.359 
on the map and rather quick time it's
basically<00:01:45.840> your<00:01:46.079> own<00:01:46.229> personal<00:01:46.680> human<00:01:46.950> cannon

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
basically your own personal human cannon

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.160 
basically your own personal human cannon
the<00:01:47.759> problem<00:01:48.090> you<00:01:48.180> run<00:01:48.240> into<00:01:48.570> is<00:01:48.840> that<00:01:48.869> they

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
the problem you run into is that they

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.780 
the problem you run into is that they
make<00:01:49.320> exceptionally<00:01:49.890> noticeable<00:01:50.369> targets

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
make exceptionally noticeable targets

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.249 
make exceptionally noticeable targets
and<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.000> moment<00:01:51.329> you<00:01:51.420> pop<00:01:51.600> your<00:01:51.780> parachute

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
and the moment you pop your parachute

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.080 
and the moment you pop your parachute
coming<00:01:52.560> out<00:01:52.680> of<00:01:52.710> one<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.250> enemy<00:01:53.549> is<00:01:53.670> probably

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
coming out of one the enemy is probably

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.580 
coming out of one the enemy is probably
going<00:01:54.329> to<00:01:54.420> see<00:01:54.659> you<00:01:54.840> if<00:01:54.990> they<00:01:55.140> are<00:01:55.290> at<00:01:55.439> the

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
going to see you if they are at the

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.410 
going to see you if they are at the
point<00:01:55.799> you're<00:01:56.009> trying<00:01:56.040> to<00:01:56.369> head<00:01:56.579> to<00:01:56.850> but<00:01:57.329> they

sir turn on this map at Point Delta I

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:16.880 
sir turn on this map at Point Delta I
believe<00:02:15.510> this<00:02:15.660> is<00:02:15.810> also<00:02:15.990> the<00:02:16.140> location<00:02:16.410> of<00:02:16.770> the

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
believe this is also the location of the

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.350 
believe this is also the location of the
railgun<00:02:17.250> in<00:02:17.430> this<00:02:17.550> map<00:02:17.730> but<00:02:17.910> I<00:02:17.940> didn't<00:02:18.270> go

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
railgun in this map but I didn't go

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.910 
railgun in this map but I didn't go
sniffing<00:02:18.750> around<00:02:18.840> that<00:02:19.140> point<00:02:19.319> for<00:02:19.590> too<00:02:19.709> long

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
sniffing around that point for too long

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.500 
sniffing around that point for too long
because<00:02:20.190> of<00:02:20.459> the<00:02:20.520> constant<00:02:20.880> attention<00:02:21.270> it

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
because of the constant attention it

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.390 
because of the constant attention it
receives<00:02:21.870> from<00:02:22.020> every<00:02:22.530> corner<00:02:22.890> of<00:02:23.010> the<00:02:23.220> map

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
receives from every corner of the map

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.280 
receives from every corner of the map
but<00:02:23.970> like<00:02:24.150> previous<00:02:24.360> maps<00:02:24.780> we<00:02:24.959> have<00:02:25.080> seen<00:02:25.260> I

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
but like previous maps we have seen I

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.410 
but like previous maps we have seen I
think<00:02:25.470> this<00:02:25.920> map<00:02:26.160> has<00:02:26.370> a<00:02:26.430> bit<00:02:26.730> of<00:02:26.850> a<00:02:26.940> multiple

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
think this map has a bit of a multiple

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.360 
think this map has a bit of a multiple
personality<00:02:27.840> disorder<00:02:28.200> I<00:02:28.709> believe<00:02:29.040> there<00:02:29.250> are

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
personality disorder I believe there are

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.790 
personality disorder I believe there are
actually<00:02:29.760> three<00:02:30.120> maps<00:02:30.390> in<00:02:30.570> hangar<00:02:30.840> 21<00:02:31.170> there's

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
actually three maps in hangar 21 there's

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.500 
actually three maps in hangar 21 there's
the<00:02:31.950> outside<00:02:32.280> which<00:02:32.520> I've<00:02:32.760> already<00:02:32.910> covered

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
the outside which I've already covered

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.570 
the outside which I've already covered
then<00:02:34.050> there's<00:02:34.320> the<00:02:34.500> air<00:02:34.620> superiority<00:02:35.010> map

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
then there's the air superiority map

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.490 
then there's the air superiority map
with<00:02:35.820> huge<00:02:36.180> flight<00:02:36.450> ceilings<00:02:36.900> clouds<00:02:37.230> and

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
with huge flight ceilings clouds and

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.320 
with huge flight ceilings clouds and
wide<00:02:37.709> open<00:02:38.040> flying<00:02:38.340> area<00:02:38.730> that<00:02:38.910> seems<00:02:39.090> to<00:02:39.300> be

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
wide open flying area that seems to be

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.030 
wide open flying area that seems to be
made<00:02:39.600> for<00:02:39.780> stealth<00:02:40.050> jet<00:02:40.230> pilots<00:02:40.620> who<00:02:40.800> just

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
made for stealth jet pilots who just

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.290 
made for stealth jet pilots who just
shoot<00:02:41.250> at<00:02:41.370> each<00:02:41.459> other<00:02:41.700> all<00:02:41.940> day<00:02:41.970> without

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
shoot at each other all day without

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.090 
shoot at each other all day without
really<00:02:42.810> affecting<00:02:42.900> the<00:02:43.410> outcome<00:02:43.440> of<00:02:43.739> the<00:02:43.890> map

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
really affecting the outcome of the map

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.220 
really affecting the outcome of the map
finally<00:02:45.000> there's<00:02:45.270> the<00:02:45.360> beating<00:02:45.780> heart<00:02:45.959> of<00:02:46.110> the

finally there's the beating heart of the

finally there's the beating heart of the

the Titan hangar that get scorched out

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
when the engines are fired up it's

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.199 
when the engines are fired up it's
really<00:03:55.769> cool<00:03:56.010> looking<00:03:56.340> but<00:03:56.579> just<00:03:56.880> don't<00:03:57.030> get

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
really cool looking but just don't get

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:59.240 
really cool looking but just don't get
caught<00:03:57.480> in<00:03:57.510> the<00:03:57.660> blast<00:03:57.930> overall<00:03:58.709> I<00:03:58.739> think<00:03:58.980> this

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
caught in the blast overall I think this

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:00.710 
caught in the blast overall I think this
is<00:03:59.370> another<00:03:59.610> map<00:03:59.850> that<00:04:00.060> I'm<00:04:00.150> guessing<00:04:00.570> we'll

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
is another map that I'm guessing we'll

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.140 
is another map that I'm guessing we'll
keep<00:04:00.900> me<00:04:01.049> playing<00:04:01.230> domination<00:04:02.070> rusher<00:04:02.430> TDM<00:04:02.880> I

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
keep me playing domination rusher TDM I

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:04.850 
keep me playing domination rusher TDM I
think<00:04:03.480> these<00:04:03.540> outside<00:04:03.930> areas<00:04:04.230> are<00:04:04.380> fine<00:04:04.590> but<00:04:04.620> I

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 
think these outside areas are fine but I

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:06.259 
think these outside areas are fine but I
just<00:04:05.190> don't<00:04:05.400> find<00:04:05.760> them<00:04:05.940> all<00:04:06.090> that

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
just don't find them all that

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:07.880 
just don't find them all that
interesting<00:04:06.930> and<00:04:07.079> if<00:04:07.380> you've<00:04:07.500> seen<00:04:07.680> my<00:04:07.860> other

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
interesting and if you've seen my other

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:09.500 
interesting and if you've seen my other
two<00:04:08.220> videos<00:04:08.370> you<00:04:08.790> know<00:04:08.970> how<00:04:09.120> I<00:04:09.150> feel<00:04:09.450> about

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
two videos you know how I feel about

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.390 
two videos you know how I feel about
maps<00:04:09.989> that<00:04:10.230> make<00:04:10.380> you<00:04:10.530> crawl<00:04:10.769> over<00:04:10.829> open

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
maps that make you crawl over open

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.400 
maps that make you crawl over open
terrain<00:04:11.609> for<00:04:11.970> hundreds<00:04:12.299> of<00:04:12.390> meters<00:04:12.540> I<00:04:12.989> just

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
terrain for hundreds of meters I just

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:14.900 
terrain for hundreds of meters I just
think<00:04:13.590> that<00:04:13.650> the<00:04:13.799> interior<00:04:14.250> of<00:04:14.280> the<00:04:14.459> hangar<00:04:14.790> is

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
think that the interior of the hangar is

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.029 
think that the interior of the hangar is
the<00:04:15.060> interesting<00:04:15.450> new<00:04:15.959> fun<00:04:16.470> thing<00:04:16.709> on<00:04:16.859> this

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:17.039 
the interesting new fun thing on this

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:18.949 
the interesting new fun thing on this
map<00:04:17.250> it<00:04:17.700> feels<00:04:18.060> like<00:04:18.150> the<00:04:18.299> main<00:04:18.479> course<00:04:18.720> when

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
map it feels like the main course when

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.569 
map it feels like the main course when
the<00:04:19.079> rest<00:04:19.289> of<00:04:19.410> the<00:04:19.500> map<00:04:19.650> is<00:04:19.859> just<00:04:20.100> the<00:04:20.220> dressing

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:20.579 
the rest of the map is just the dressing

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:22.730 
the rest of the map is just the dressing
or<00:04:20.760> maybe<00:04:21.209> even<00:04:21.330> a<00:04:21.660> garnish<00:04:22.019> and<00:04:22.229> while<00:04:22.560> the

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
or maybe even a garnish and while the

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.469 
or maybe even a garnish and while the
size<00:04:22.979> of<00:04:23.130> these<00:04:23.220> maps<00:04:23.460> thematically<00:04:24.030> reminds

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 
size of these maps thematically reminds

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:26.440 
size of these maps thematically reminds
me<00:04:24.599> of<00:04:24.750> battlefield<00:04:25.200> 3<00:04:25.500> is<00:04:25.620> armored<00:04:25.919> kill

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.450 
me of battlefield 3 is armored kill

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:27.970 
me of battlefield 3 is armored kill
attention<00:04:26.690> I<00:04:26.810> feel<00:04:27.140> like<00:04:27.350> they<00:04:27.530> have<00:04:27.560> actually

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:27.980 
attention I feel like they have actually

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:30.010 
attention I feel like they have actually
been<00:04:28.130> a<00:04:28.190> better<00:04:28.490> experience<00:04:28.940> in<00:04:29.420> both<00:04:29.600> Giants

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
been a better experience in both Giants

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.050 
been a better experience in both Giants
of<00:04:30.110> Karelia<00:04:30.140> and<00:04:30.710> now<00:04:30.920> in<00:04:31.100> hangar<00:04:31.400> 21<00:04:31.700> there

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
of Karelia and now in hangar 21 there

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:33.520 
of Karelia and now in hangar 21 there
are<00:04:32.150> tucked<00:04:32.390> away<00:04:32.510> areas<00:04:32.960> of<00:04:33.110> the<00:04:33.200> map<00:04:33.350> that

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
are tucked away areas of the map that

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:35.620 
are tucked away areas of the map that
are<00:04:33.680> genuinely<00:04:34.130> interesting<00:04:34.880> I<00:04:35.060> just<00:04:35.450> wish

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
are genuinely interesting I just wish

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.330 
are genuinely interesting I just wish
they<00:04:35.870> were<00:04:35.930> more<00:04:36.170> of<00:04:36.290> the<00:04:36.380> maps<00:04:36.590> focus<00:04:37.010> because

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.340 
they were more of the maps focus because

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.070 
they were more of the maps focus because
undulating<00:04:37.700> hills<00:04:38.180> just<00:04:38.570> aren't<00:04:38.960> that

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
undulating hills just aren't that

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.230 
undulating hills just aren't that
