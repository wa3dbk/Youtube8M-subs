00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:18.000
 Hello, I have already applied this varnish 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:21.900
 golden rose number 15 and now I will 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.740
 Apply this scotch cut off and 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.740
 make a pattern 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:42.280
 so we have here like a corner here 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.280
 not 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:57.840
 white stripes in parallel here already going 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:04.530
 from the corner 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:08.130
 here it is parallel here carefully 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:12.110
 I press and now I will do two 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.110
 strips parallel in this direction 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.210
 I cut wages 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:31.770
 I put them also 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.250
 parts not pressing now one more 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.250
 at the same time put here 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.769
 rabbis strips 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:24.410
 Carefully press it all down. 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.990

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:37.880
 other nails 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:40.870
 we press it all carefully and now 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:47.830

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:47.830
 tea impudence like this color number 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.890

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:57.170
 800 973 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:03.550
 wait for 954 for any of them 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:13.600
 correct number on 954 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:16.989
 so now i put this varnish on top 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.989
 cross you a bunch 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:56.200

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:08.100

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:14.080
 on the sly with tweezers we shoot in the same 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:16.480
 the direction that they wore 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:18.160
 that is, if at first they wore it 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:21.250
 It means that it will have the first 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:30.210
 remove and vice versa, I memorize by 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:30.210
