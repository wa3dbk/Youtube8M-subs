00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:26.269 
yesterday was a tough day for me when I

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:28.660 
yesterday was a tough day for me when I
was<00:02:26.480> younger<00:02:26.720> I<00:02:26.840> may<00:02:27.079> be<00:02:27.140> a<00:02:27.290> bush<00:02:27.920> myself<00:02:28.519> by

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
was younger I may be a bush myself by

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.309 
was younger I may be a bush myself by
that<00:02:28.940> point<00:02:29.299> yesterday<00:02:29.720> where<00:02:29.870> I<00:02:29.900> realized

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
that point yesterday where I realized

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:32.380 
that point yesterday where I realized
that<00:02:30.500> probably<00:02:30.620> wasn't<00:02:30.980> advantageous<00:02:31.579> to

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
that probably wasn't advantageous to

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.440 
that probably wasn't advantageous to
continue<00:02:32.840> pushing<00:02:33.079> myself<00:02:33.970> the<00:02:34.970> Ender<00:02:35.239> day<00:02:35.420> I

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
continue pushing myself the Ender day I

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.110 
continue pushing myself the Ender day I
was<00:02:35.599> within<00:02:35.750> 5<00:02:36.110> pounds<00:02:36.650> of<00:02:37.000> making<00:02:38.000> the

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.110 
was within 5 pounds of making the
Olympic<00:02:39.069> 264<00:02:40.069> and<00:02:40.129> a<00:02:40.220> half<00:02:40.310> pound<00:02:40.610> of<00:02:40.700> weigh<00:02:40.910> in

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
Olympic 264 and a half pound of weigh in

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.110 
Olympic 264 and a half pound of weigh in
number<00:02:41.510> and<00:02:41.799> being<00:02:42.799> within<00:02:42.950> 5<00:02:43.280> pounds<00:02:43.760> I<00:02:43.850> felt

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
number and being within 5 pounds I felt

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.870 
number and being within 5 pounds I felt
a<00:02:44.209> little<00:02:44.389> bit<00:02:45.370> disappointed<00:02:46.370> but<00:02:46.459> my<00:02:46.639> father

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
a little bit disappointed but my father

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.809 
a little bit disappointed but my father
got<00:02:47.120> to<00:02:47.269> a<00:02:47.329> point<00:02:47.569> where<00:02:47.959> told<00:02:48.440> me<00:02:48.590> it's<00:02:49.010> time

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:49.819 
got to a point where told me it's time

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:53.770 
got to a point where told me it's time
that<00:02:50.030> you<00:02:50.090> stop<00:02:50.440> pushing<00:02:51.440> yourself<00:02:51.950> and<00:02:52.780> eight

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
that you stop pushing yourself and eight

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.530 
that you stop pushing yourself and eight
years<00:02:54.049> ago<00:02:54.290> I<00:02:54.590> was<00:02:55.579> on<00:02:55.670> the<00:02:55.819> exact<00:02:56.030> same<00:02:56.269> path

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
years ago I was on the exact same path

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.020 
years ago I was on the exact same path
as<00:02:56.720> I<00:02:56.840> was<00:02:57.049> the<00:02:57.350> trip<00:02:57.680> but<00:02:58.430> I<00:02:58.489> think<00:02:58.790> the<00:02:58.880> eight

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
as I was the trip but I think the eight

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.650 
as I was the trip but I think the eight
years<00:02:59.299> removed<00:02:59.660> and<00:02:59.930> not<00:03:00.109> being<00:03:00.440> you<00:03:01.250> know

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
years removed and not being you know

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.180 
years removed and not being you know
weighed<00:03:02.660> in<00:03:02.900> numerous<00:03:03.470> times<00:03:03.709> like<00:03:03.920> they<00:03:04.040> had

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
weighed in numerous times like they had

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.220 
weighed in numerous times like they had
in<00:03:04.370> the<00:03:04.459> past<00:03:04.670> I<00:03:05.090> think<00:03:05.150> that<00:03:05.510> affected<00:03:06.109> my

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
in the past I think that affected my

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.009 
in the past I think that affected my
body<00:03:06.470> and<00:03:06.650> ultimately<00:03:07.060> my<00:03:08.060> body<00:03:08.329> told<00:03:08.599> me<00:03:08.810> that

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
body and ultimately my body told me that

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:10.900 
body and ultimately my body told me that
it<00:03:09.650> wasn't<00:03:09.829> right<00:03:10.069> yesterday<00:03:10.609> and<00:03:10.760> that

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
it wasn't right yesterday and that

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.110 
it wasn't right yesterday and that
that's<00:03:11.120> why<00:03:11.359> I<00:03:11.389> decided<00:03:11.870> to<00:03:12.019> stop<00:03:12.410> and<00:03:13.010> for<00:03:14.000> me

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
that's why I decided to stop and for me

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.699 
that's why I decided to stop and for me
you<00:03:14.450> know<00:03:14.480> I<00:03:14.569> could<00:03:14.780> have<00:03:14.870> hurt<00:03:15.019> myself<00:03:15.170> but

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
you know I could have hurt myself but

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:18.309 
you know I could have hurt myself but
this<00:03:16.310> isn't<00:03:16.549> about<00:03:16.700> making<00:03:17.569> a<00:03:17.870> working<00:03:18.170> team

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:18.319 
this isn't about making a working team

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:20.770 
this isn't about making a working team
that<00:03:18.530> was<00:03:18.680> only<00:03:18.859> a<00:03:19.220> byproduct<00:03:19.760> and<00:03:20.359> that's

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
that was only a byproduct and that's

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.949 
that was only a byproduct and that's
part<00:03:21.109> of<00:03:21.170> it<00:03:21.290> we<00:03:21.470> get<00:03:21.680> help<00:03:22.510> to<00:03:23.510> being<00:03:23.780> human

part of it we get help to being human

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:26.319 
part of it we get help to being human

for<00:03:30.230> the<00:03:30.349> Olympic<00:03:30.709> team<00:03:30.889> has<00:03:31.130> been<00:03:31.310> something

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
for the Olympic team has been something

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.420 
for the Olympic team has been something
that's<00:03:31.819> truly<00:03:32.150> special<00:03:32.510> and<00:03:32.780> I<00:03:32.930> think<00:03:33.139> my

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
that's truly special and I think my

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.819 
that's truly special and I think my
hopefully<00:03:34.000> it<00:03:34.510> may<00:03:34.810> be<00:03:34.870> wiser<00:03:35.260> and<00:03:35.709> smarter

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:35.829 
hopefully it may be wiser and smarter

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:39.360 
hopefully it may be wiser and smarter
and<00:03:36.810> in<00:03:37.810> my<00:03:37.989> choices<00:03:38.260> from<00:03:38.859> here<00:03:39.099> to<00:03:39.310> the

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
and in my choices from here to the

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.819 
and in my choices from here to the
future<00:03:39.819> I<00:03:40.090> want<00:03:40.689> to<00:03:40.780> make<00:03:40.900> better<00:03:41.140> choices<00:03:41.230> and

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829 
future I want to make better choices and

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:45.420 
future I want to make better choices and
I<00:03:41.950> think<00:03:42.090> this<00:03:43.090> is<00:03:43.269> the<00:03:43.450> reason<00:03:43.840> that<00:03:44.500> put<00:03:45.340> the

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
I think this is the reason that put the

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.300 
I think this is the reason that put the
last<00:03:45.579> two<00:03:45.879> years<00:03:46.030> of<00:03:46.239> my<00:03:46.329> life<00:03:46.359> on<00:03:46.810> hold<00:03:47.019> to<00:03:47.379> be

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
last two years of my life on hold to be

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.539 
last two years of my life on hold to be
able<00:03:48.790> to<00:03:48.939> compete<00:03:49.239> here<00:03:49.299> and<00:03:49.840> to<00:03:50.829> succeed<00:03:51.250> and

able to compete here and to succeed and

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:55.590 
able to compete here and to succeed and
reach<00:03:51.609> my<00:03:52.389> goal<00:03:52.599> and<00:03:52.780> that<00:03:52.930> will<00:03:53.109> be<00:03:53.200> healthy
