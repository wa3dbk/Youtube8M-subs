is<00:02:00.450> so<00:02:00.659> fast<00:02:00.930> it<00:02:01.170> is<00:02:01.290> unbelievable<00:02:02.159> actually

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.940 
is so fast it is unbelievable actually

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:04.910 
is so fast it is unbelievable actually
thought<00:02:03.270> it<00:02:03.510> was<00:02:03.600> a<00:02:03.630> bit<00:02:03.900> like<00:02:04.050> Walcott<00:02:04.710> in<00:02:04.830> a

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920
