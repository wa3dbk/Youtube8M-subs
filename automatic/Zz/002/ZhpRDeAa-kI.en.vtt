magazine size as well as that really

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.860 
magazine size as well as that really
nice<00:00:45.690> viral<00:00:46.350> AoE<00:00:46.649> damage<00:00:47.510> also<00:00:48.510> I<00:00:48.539> don't

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
nice viral AoE damage also I don't

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.240 
nice viral AoE damage also I don't
really<00:00:49.079> mention<00:00:49.379> weapons<00:00:49.710> like<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:49.980> soma

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
really mention weapons like the soma

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.830 
really mention weapons like the soma
Prime<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:50.760> a<00:00:50.820> bolts<00:00:51.120> are<00:00:51.270> prime<00:00:51.539> because

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
Prime and a bolts are prime because

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.360 
Prime and a bolts are prime because
they're<00:00:52.020> really<00:00:52.379> straightforward<00:00:52.710> weapons

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
they're really straightforward weapons

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.799 
they're really straightforward weapons
and<00:00:53.520> everyone<00:00:53.789> pretty<00:00:53.969> much<00:00:54.090> knows<00:00:54.210> how<00:00:54.600> good

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
and everyone pretty much knows how good

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.500 
and everyone pretty much knows how good
they<00:00:54.989> are<00:00:55.020> and<00:00:55.649> I<00:00:56.219> also<00:00:56.489> try<00:00:56.879> not<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.030> mention<00:00:57.329> a

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
they are and I also try not to mention a

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.180 
they are and I also try not to mention a
lot<00:00:57.629> of<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.870> new<00:00:58.140> player<00:00:58.469> weaponry<00:00:59.010> that's

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
lot of the new player weaponry that's

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.340 
lot of the new player weaponry that's
really<00:00:59.730> low<00:00:59.910> level<00:01:00.359> because<00:01:00.510> it's<00:01:00.989> really

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
really low level because it's really

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.860 
really low level because it's really
accessible<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:02.039> newer<00:01:02.250> players<00:01:02.579> so<00:01:03.449> let's<00:01:03.750> get

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
accessible to newer players so let's get

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:04.549 
accessible to newer players so let's get
this<00:01:04.049> started

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
this started

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.940 
this started
top<00:01:05.100> five<00:01:05.430> most<00:01:05.880> hated<00:01:06.240> weapon<00:01:06.750> so<00:01:07.380> this<00:01:07.799> is

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
top five most hated weapon so this is

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.740 
top five most hated weapon so this is
going<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.159> be<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.369> sear<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:08.939> I<00:01:09.299> think<00:01:09.510> this<00:01:09.630> is

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
going to be the sear and I think this is

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.330 
going to be the sear and I think this is
an<00:01:09.840> absolutely<00:01:10.500> beautiful<00:01:10.590> weapon<00:01:11.220> just

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
an absolutely beautiful weapon just

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.550 
an absolutely beautiful weapon just
looking<00:01:11.700> at<00:01:11.850> it<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.150> all<00:01:12.780> of<00:01:12.840> those<00:01:13.229> really

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
looking at it and all of those really

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.770 
looking at it and all of those really
nice<00:01:13.740> looks<00:01:14.100> are<00:01:14.280> going<00:01:14.580> to<00:01:14.790> waste<00:01:15.000> now<00:01:15.330> this

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
nice looks are going to waste now this

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.410 
nice looks are going to waste now this
has<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:15.990> sniper<00:01:16.500> like<00:01:16.680> zoom<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:17.460> that<00:01:18.030> thing<00:01:18.270> is

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
has a sniper like zoom and that thing is

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.330 
has a sniper like zoom and that thing is
just<00:01:18.570> nodding<00:01:19.500> looking<00:01:19.770> down<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.070> scope

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
just nodding looking down the scope

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.100 
just nodding looking down the scope
trying<00:01:20.790> to<00:01:20.880> scope<00:01:21.119> in<00:01:21.299> on<00:01:21.450> enemies<00:01:21.750> with<00:01:21.930> this

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
trying to scope in on enemies with this

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.649 
trying to scope in on enemies with this
and<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:23.040> zoom<00:01:23.340> is<00:01:23.549> also<00:01:23.970> pretty<00:01:24.240> pointless

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
and the zoom is also pretty pointless

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.380 
and the zoom is also pretty pointless
since<00:01:25.130> projectiles<00:01:26.130> have<00:01:26.369> travel<00:01:26.850> time<00:01:27.030> and

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
since projectiles have travel time and

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.560 
since projectiles have travel time and
now<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.600> damage<00:01:28.140> on<00:01:28.229> this<00:01:28.320> is<00:01:28.530> OK<00:01:29.189> but<00:01:29.970> it's

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
now the damage on this is OK but it's

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.060 
now the damage on this is OK but it's
not<00:01:30.840> really<00:01:31.140> going<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:31.439> justify<00:01:32.009> the

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
not really going to justify the

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.039 
not really going to justify the
projectile<00:01:32.729> speed<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.360> also<00:01:33.509> this<00:01:33.750> weapon

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
projectile speed and also this weapon

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.080 
projectile speed and also this weapon
doesn't<00:01:34.200> really<00:01:34.409> have<00:01:34.560> any<00:01:34.770> critter<00:01:35.130> so<00:01:36.030> I'm

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
doesn't really have any critter so I'm

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.999 
doesn't really have any critter so I'm
going<00:01:36.329> to<00:01:36.420> say<00:01:36.600> this<00:01:37.020> weapon<00:01:37.409> especially<00:01:37.619> the

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
going to say this weapon especially the

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.859 
going to say this weapon especially the
look<00:01:38.250> of<00:01:38.400> this<00:01:38.520> weapon<00:01:38.850> is<00:01:38.970> just<00:01:39.030> an<00:01:39.270> absolute

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
look of this weapon is just an absolute

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.670 
look of this weapon is just an absolute
waste<00:01:40.110> number<00:01:41.040> 5<00:01:41.280> most<00:01:41.610> loved<00:01:41.970> yay<00:01:42.649> now<00:01:43.649> I

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
waste number 5 most loved yay now I

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.899 
waste number 5 most loved yay now I
think<00:01:43.829> this<00:01:44.070> is<00:01:44.189> going<00:01:44.310> to<00:01:44.369> be<00:01:44.430> a<00:01:44.460> tie<00:01:44.700> between

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
think this is going to be a tie between

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.670 
think this is going to be a tie between
the<00:01:45.149> sindelle<00:01:45.509> Prime<00:01:45.750> and<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.110> dragon<00:01:46.560> nikana

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
the sindelle Prime and the dragon nikana

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.920 
the sindelle Prime and the dragon nikana
I<00:01:47.159> was<00:01:47.430> leaning<00:01:47.790> more<00:01:47.970> towards<00:01:48.420> sendou<00:01:48.689> Prime

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
I was leaning more towards sendou Prime

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.020 
I was leaning more towards sendou Prime
but<00:01:49.110> I<00:01:49.170> asked<00:01:49.530> a<00:01:49.560> few<00:01:49.680> clan<00:01:49.979> members<00:01:50.369> and<00:01:50.549> they

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
but I asked a few clan members and they

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.420 
but I asked a few clan members and they
were<00:01:51.090> leaning<00:01:51.360> more<00:01:51.689> dragon<00:01:52.290> nikana<00:01:52.380> now<00:01:53.130> if<00:01:53.340> I

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
were leaning more dragon nikana now if I

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.380 
were leaning more dragon nikana now if I
wanted<00:01:53.670> to<00:01:53.729> start<00:01:53.970> with<00:01:54.030> this<00:01:54.180> no<00:01:54.360> problem

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
wanted to start with this no problem

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.670 
wanted to start with this no problem
because<00:01:54.840> that's<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.170> one<00:01:55.290> I<00:01:55.380> was<00:01:55.530> leaning

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
because that's the one I was leaning

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.100 
because that's the one I was leaning
towards<00:01:56.280> it<00:01:56.430> is<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.149> highest<00:01:57.479> melee<00:01:57.869> damage

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
towards it is the highest melee damage

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.800 
towards it is the highest melee damage
weapon<00:01:58.439> in<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.619> game<00:01:58.799> and<00:01:59.130> it<00:01:59.790> has<00:02:00.030> a<00:02:00.299> really

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
weapon in the game and it has a really

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.800 
weapon in the game and it has a really
high<00:02:00.960> crit<00:02:01.500> chance<00:02:01.710> and<00:02:01.979> crit<00:02:02.189> damage<00:02:02.369> and

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
high crit chance and crit damage and

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.580 
high crit chance and crit damage and
then<00:02:03.810> there's<00:02:04.110> this

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
then there's this

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.309 
then there's this
now<00:02:06.520> the<00:02:06.790> dragon<00:02:07.210> nikana<00:02:07.329> is<00:02:07.689> just<00:02:08.020> as<00:02:08.140> nice

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:08.319 
now the dragon nikana is just as nice

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:10.380 
now the dragon nikana is just as nice
it's<00:02:08.619> a<00:02:08.679> really<00:02:09.069> nicely<00:02:09.310> balanced<00:02:09.849> weapon<00:02:10.209> I

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
it's a really nicely balanced weapon I

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.479 
it's a really nicely balanced weapon I
think<00:02:10.599> both<00:02:11.050> weapons<00:02:11.410> have<00:02:11.590> really<00:02:11.920> nice<00:02:12.099> crit

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
think both weapons have really nice crit

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:14.190 
think both weapons have really nice crit
chance<00:02:12.700> and<00:02:12.970> create<00:02:13.180> damage<00:02:13.599> they<00:02:13.780> both<00:02:13.989> can

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
chance and create damage they both can

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.870 
chance and create damage they both can
use<00:02:14.349> the<00:02:14.470> Berserker<00:02:14.950> mod<00:02:15.130> to<00:02:15.370> make<00:02:15.489> the<00:02:15.610> speeds

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
use the Berserker mod to make the speeds

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.600 
use the Berserker mod to make the speeds
really<00:02:16.150> fast<00:02:16.569> so<00:02:17.200> it's<00:02:17.470> really<00:02:17.800> hard<00:02:18.430> to

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
really fast so it's really hard to

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.339 
really fast so it's really hard to
decide<00:02:19.000> between<00:02:19.209> the<00:02:19.450> two<00:02:19.480> so<00:02:19.810> I'm<00:02:19.959> gonna<00:02:20.110> call

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:20.349 
decide between the two so I'm gonna call

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:25.229 
decide between the two so I'm gonna call
it<00:02:20.500> a<00:02:20.590> tie<00:02:23.099> so<00:02:24.099> this<00:02:24.459> is<00:02:24.610> going<00:02:24.760> to<00:02:24.819> have<00:02:24.970> to<00:02:25.120> go

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
it a tie so this is going to have to go

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:27.479 
it a tie so this is going to have to go
to<00:02:25.300> the<00:02:25.540> Midlands<00:02:25.989> quante<00:02:26.470> this<00:02:27.040> is<00:02:27.220> pretty

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
to the Midlands quante this is pretty

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:29.820 
to the Midlands quante this is pretty
much<00:02:27.610> a<00:02:27.670> rifle<00:02:28.269> with<00:02:28.480> a<00:02:28.540> bubble<00:02:29.230> blower<00:02:29.500> on<00:02:29.620> it

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
much a rifle with a bubble blower on it

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.800 
much a rifle with a bubble blower on it
if<00:02:30.130> you<00:02:30.280> remember<00:02:30.880> blowing<00:02:31.239> bubbles<00:02:31.630> as<00:02:31.720> a

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
if you remember blowing bubbles as a

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.750 
if you remember blowing bubbles as a
little<00:02:32.019> kid<00:02:32.260> and<00:02:32.650> that's<00:02:32.830> about<00:02:32.980> as<00:02:33.310> useful<00:02:33.550> as

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
little kid and that's about as useful as

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.970 
little kid and that's about as useful as
these<00:02:33.940> bubbles<00:02:34.150> are<00:02:34.450> now<00:02:34.959> the<00:02:35.260> primary<00:02:35.560> fire

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
these bubbles are now the primary fire

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.039 
these bubbles are now the primary fire
has<00:02:36.400> no<00:02:36.700> aim<00:02:36.910> down<00:02:37.120> sight<00:02:37.420> on<00:02:37.630> it<00:02:37.780> so<00:02:37.900> it's

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:38.049 
has no aim down sight on it so it's

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:39.750 
has no aim down sight on it so it's
really<00:02:38.319> hard<00:02:38.530> to<00:02:38.709> aim<00:02:38.739> using<00:02:39.160> that<00:02:39.370> primary

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
really hard to aim using that primary

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.640 
really hard to aim using that primary
fire<00:02:40.000> and<00:02:40.299> honestly<00:02:41.140> even<00:02:41.350> with<00:02:41.560> the

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
fire and honestly even with the

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.710 
fire and honestly even with the
secondary<00:02:42.130> fire<00:02:42.400> those<00:02:43.030> bubbles<00:02:43.540> don't

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
secondary fire those bubbles don't

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.180 
secondary fire those bubbles don't
explode<00:02:44.230> and<00:02:44.470> they're<00:02:44.620> really<00:02:44.830> hard<00:02:45.160> to

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
explode and they're really hard to

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:46.860 
explode and they're really hard to
control<00:02:45.580> even<00:02:45.880> if<00:02:46.030> you<00:02:46.090> want<00:02:46.269> to<00:02:46.299> hit<00:02:46.510> enemies

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
control even if you want to hit enemies

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.630 
control even if you want to hit enemies
to<00:02:46.959> get<00:02:47.080> that<00:02:47.260> radiation<00:02:47.650> product<00:02:48.130> it's

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
to get that radiation product it's

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.150 
to get that radiation product it's
really<00:02:49.090> not<00:02:49.239> that<00:02:49.299> useful<00:02:49.690> overall<00:02:50.230> I<00:02:50.590> wish<00:02:51.040> I

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
really not that useful overall I wish I

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.520 
really not that useful overall I wish I
could<00:02:51.370> mutate<00:02:52.299> this<00:02:52.540> weapon<00:02:52.930> into<00:02:53.140> something

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
could mutate this weapon into something

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:54.080 
could mutate this weapon into something
better

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
better

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.320 
better
number<00:02:55.090> four<00:02:55.330> most-loved<00:02:56.130> mmm<00:02:57.220> I<00:02:57.459> really<00:02:58.120> like

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
the Thibodeaux and life isn't really

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.970 
the Thibodeaux and life isn't really
fair<00:03:01.000> I<00:03:01.299> think<00:03:01.900> something<00:03:02.380> is<00:03:02.500> in<00:03:02.590> life<00:03:02.799> are

fair I think something is in life are

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.470 
fair I think something is in life are
just<00:03:03.160> gonna<00:03:03.310> be<00:03:03.489> better<00:03:03.849> than<00:03:04.030> other<00:03:04.209> things

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
just gonna be better than other things

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.089 
just gonna be better than other things
and<00:03:04.690> the<00:03:04.750> typical<00:03:05.230> is<00:03:05.319> going<00:03:05.470> to<00:03:05.530> be<00:03:05.620> a<00:03:05.650> perfect

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:06.099 
and the typical is going to be a perfect

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:08.490 
and the typical is going to be a perfect
example<00:03:06.670> of<00:03:06.730> this<00:03:06.880> because<00:03:07.690> the<00:03:07.900> typical<00:03:08.140> has

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
example of this because the typical has

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.560 
example of this because the typical has
really<00:03:09.069> good<00:03:09.250> high<00:03:09.459> damage<00:03:09.790> it<00:03:10.090> has<00:03:10.239> a<00:03:10.269> good

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:10.570 
really good high damage it has a good

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.599 
really good high damage it has a good
crit<00:03:10.870> chance<00:03:11.049> and<00:03:11.320> create<00:03:11.530> damage<00:03:11.769> they<00:03:12.430> can

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:12.609 
crit chance and create damage they can

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:14.250 
crit chance and create damage they can
also<00:03:12.790> use<00:03:13.090> a<00:03:13.120> Berserker<00:03:13.630> mod<00:03:13.810> to<00:03:14.019> get<00:03:14.109> the

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:39.240 
and I really don't like this weapon I

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.000 
and I really don't like this weapon I
just<00:03:39.930> feel<00:03:40.080> like<00:03:40.230> if<00:03:40.470> you're<00:03:40.620> going<00:03:40.800> to<00:03:40.890> get

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
just feel like if you're going to get

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.190 
just feel like if you're going to get
this<00:03:41.220> close<00:03:41.520> to<00:03:41.730> an<00:03:41.850> enemy<00:03:42.060> you<00:03:42.420> better<00:03:42.780> pretty

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
this close to an enemy you better pretty

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.590 
this close to an enemy you better pretty
much<00:03:43.350> tear<00:03:43.650> it<00:03:43.770> in<00:03:43.890> half<00:03:44.100> and<00:03:44.400> the<00:03:45.090> primary

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
much tear it in half and the primary

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.780 
much tear it in half and the primary
fire<00:03:45.840> really<00:03:46.230> lacks<00:03:46.530> aim<00:03:46.800> down<00:03:47.040> sight<00:03:47.370> again

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
fire really lacks aim down sight again

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.280 
fire really lacks aim down sight again
we're<00:03:48.060> starting<00:03:48.390> to<00:03:48.450> see<00:03:48.570> a<00:03:48.600> trend<00:03:48.660> here<00:03:49.140> with

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
we're starting to see a trend here with

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:50.930 
we're starting to see a trend here with
weapons<00:03:49.470> that<00:03:49.800> lack<00:03:50.010> aim<00:03:50.250> down<00:03:50.430> slightly<00:03:50.880> the

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
weapons that lack aim down slightly the

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.570 
weapons that lack aim down slightly the
secondary<00:03:51.390> fire<00:03:51.600> so<00:03:52.200> I<00:03:52.500> think<00:03:52.710> the<00:03:53.130> mitre<00:03:53.430> is

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
secondary fire so I think the mitre is

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.400 
secondary fire so I think the mitre is
going<00:03:53.910> to<00:03:53.970> be<00:03:54.060> better<00:03:54.300> with<00:03:54.600> the<00:03:54.690> primary<00:03:54.960> fire

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
going to be better with the primary fire

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.370 
going to be better with the primary fire
I<00:03:55.710> just<00:03:56.310> don't<00:03:56.880> really<00:03:57.420> like<00:03:57.540> this<00:03:57.960> weapon<00:03:58.320> I

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
I just don't really like this weapon I

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:59.480 
I just don't really like this weapon I
think<00:03:58.410> you're<00:03:58.680> going<00:03:58.800> to<00:03:58.860> get<00:03:59.010> this<00:03:59.190> close

00:03:59.480 --> 00:03:59.490 
think you're going to get this close

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:01.190 
think you're going to get this close
with<00:03:59.670> the<00:03:59.760> weapon<00:04:00.090> no<00:04:00.480> weapon<00:04:00.600> better<00:04:00.960> do<00:04:01.170> a

so<00:05:03.170> this<00:05:03.620> is<00:05:03.800> going<00:05:03.950> to<00:05:04.010> go<00:05:04.160> to<00:05:04.220> the<00:05:04.520> pair

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:04.820 
so this is going to go to the pair

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:06.970 
so this is going to go to the pair
assist<00:05:05.180> which<00:05:05.480> is<00:05:05.690> another<00:05:06.110> quantified

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.620 
weapon and these quanta type weapons
usually<00:05:09.800> are<00:05:10.160> historically<00:05:10.730> not<00:05:11.180> really<00:05:11.480> that

primary fire the damage ain't that great

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:25.420 
primary fire the damage ain't that great
to<00:05:23.240> begin<00:05:23.330> with<00:05:23.780> and<00:05:23.960> the<00:05:24.140> secondary<00:05:24.740> fire<00:05:25.100> is

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:25.430

to begin with and the secondary fire is
gonna<00:05:26.060> be<00:05:26.180> a<00:05:26.210> grappling<00:05:26.810> hook<00:05:26.870> which<00:05:27.290> honestly

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:27.650

isn't really there with 1.5 times great
damage<00:05:57.440> but<00:05:58.010> you<00:05:58.130> can<00:05:58.280> really<00:05:58.460> make<00:05:58.730> that<00:05:58.880> up

00:05:59.050 --> 00:05:59.060 
damage but you can really make that up

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:00.550 
damage but you can really make that up
because<00:05:59.330> you<00:05:59.450> can<00:05:59.600> get<00:05:59.690> the<00:05:59.840> status<00:06:00.200> chance<00:06:00.410> on
