the<00:05:10.150> first<00:05:10.360> one<00:05:10.540> we<00:05:10.660> opened<00:05:10.810> so<00:05:11.230> mystery

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
the first one we opened so mystery

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.520 
the first one we opened so mystery
toothless<00:05:12.220> because<00:05:12.520> he's<00:05:12.670> the<00:05:12.850> mystery<00:05:13.240> one

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:13.530 
toothless because he's the mystery one

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:15.840 
toothless because he's the mystery one
which<00:05:14.530> I<00:05:14.740> think<00:05:14.770> I'm<00:05:15.070> leaning<00:05:15.370> towards<00:05:15.640> him

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:15.850 
which I think I'm leaning towards him

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:17.700 
which I think I'm leaning towards him
because<00:05:16.030> he<00:05:16.390> was<00:05:16.600> the<00:05:16.780> mystery<00:05:17.140> one<00:05:17.380> so<00:05:17.680> I

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710 
because he was the mystery one so I

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:19.410 
because he was the mystery one so I
think<00:05:17.830> he<00:05:18.130> is<00:05:18.460> a<00:05:18.520> little<00:05:18.700> special<00:05:18.970> but<00:05:19.270> this

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:19.420 
think he is a little special but this

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:20.970 
think he is a little special but this
one<00:05:19.570> is<00:05:19.750> this<00:05:19.870> but<00:05:20.020> in<00:05:20.140> this<00:05:20.320> TV<00:05:20.560> you<00:05:20.680> get<00:05:20.800> the

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:20.980 
one is this but in this TV you get the

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:22.650 
one is this but in this TV you get the
same<00:05:21.220> you<00:05:21.580> get<00:05:21.730> the<00:05:21.850> same<00:05:22.030> odds<00:05:22.300> of<00:05:22.540> getting

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:22.660 
same you get the same odds of getting

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:24.060 
same you get the same odds of getting
him<00:05:22.990> as<00:05:23.140> you<00:05:23.290> do<00:05:23.410> in<00:05:23.530> the<00:05:23.620> other<00:05:23.650> ones

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:24.070 
him as you do in the other ones

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:27.900 
him as you do in the other ones
so<00:05:24.520> it's<00:05:24.640> not<00:05:24.790> like<00:05:24.970> a<00:05:25.000> rare<00:05:25.360> life<00:05:26.550> yeah<00:05:27.550> I

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:27.910 
so it's not like a rare life yeah I

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:29.810 
so it's not like a rare life yeah I
guess<00:05:28.150> they<00:05:28.300> just<00:05:28.330> wanted<00:05:28.780> to<00:05:28.840> surprise<00:05:28.990> one

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:29.820 
guess they just wanted to surprise one
