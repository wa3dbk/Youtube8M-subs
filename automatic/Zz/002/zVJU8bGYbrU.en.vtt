advantage<00:00:42.850> about<00:00:43.090> this<00:00:43.330> so<00:00:43.650> basically<00:00:44.650> it

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.460 
advantage about this so basically it

advantage about this so basically it
turns<00:00:45.760> into<00:00:45.940> this<00:00:47.760> look<00:00:48.760> up<00:00:48.910> there<00:00:49.060> we<00:00:49.180> go<00:00:49.329> so

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:49.810 
turns into this look up there we go so

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:51.330 
turns into this look up there we go so
then<00:00:49.990> we<00:00:50.110> can<00:00:50.290> see<00:00:50.440> it<00:00:50.560> straight<00:00:50.950> out<00:00:51.100> of<00:00:51.130> its

a goodie a fish there's only this that
smells<00:01:27.340> so<00:01:27.729> we<00:01:27.820> can<00:01:27.970> wrap<00:01:28.150> this<00:01:28.180> up<00:01:28.510> put<00:01:29.170> it

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.290 
smells so we can wrap this up put it

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.620 
smells so we can wrap this up put it
somewhere<00:01:29.470> else<00:01:29.860> too<00:01:30.520> you<00:01:30.790> don't<00:01:31.360> have<00:01:31.450> to

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
somewhere else too you don't have to

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:32.850 
somewhere else too you don't have to
worry<00:01:31.810> about<00:01:31.930> this<00:01:32.170> this<00:01:32.229> can<00:01:32.560> go<00:01:32.680> straight

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
worry about this this can go straight

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.100 
worry about this this can go straight
back<00:01:33.070> in<00:01:33.250> its<00:01:33.369> bag<00:01:33.580> it<00:01:33.970> also<00:01:34.150> comes<00:01:34.570> with<00:01:34.810> a

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
back in its bag it also comes with a

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.440 
back in its bag it also comes with a
nice<00:01:35.409> cushion<00:01:35.950> kneeling<00:01:36.729> map<00:01:36.940> so<00:01:37.299> you<00:01:37.360> can

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
nice cushion kneeling map so you can

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.320 
nice cushion kneeling map so you can
kneel<00:01:37.720> on<00:01:37.750> it<00:01:38.159> adjustable<00:01:39.159> feet<00:01:39.490> every<00:01:40.270> corner

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 
kneel on it adjustable feet every corner

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.850 
kneel on it adjustable feet every corner
so<00:01:43.330> no<00:01:43.360> matter<00:01:43.720> what<00:01:44.049> the<00:01:44.229> terrain<00:01:44.439> is

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860 
so no matter what the terrain is

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:46.890 
so no matter what the terrain is
basically<00:01:45.670> you<00:01:45.909> can<00:01:46.060> adjust<00:01:46.360> the<00:01:46.479> legs<00:01:46.659> to

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:46.900 
basically you can adjust the legs to

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.060 
basically you can adjust the legs to
compensate<00:01:48.180> it<00:01:49.180> also<00:01:49.330> you'll<00:01:49.780> find<00:01:50.070> once

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
compensate it also you'll find once

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.520 
compensate it also you'll find once
you've<00:01:51.189> got<00:01:51.310> your<00:01:51.430> fish<00:01:51.580> in<00:01:51.729> there<00:01:52.530> basically

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
you've got your fish in there basically

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.200 
you've got your fish in there basically
you<00:01:53.590> can<00:01:53.740> tip<00:01:53.920> water<00:01:54.130> in<00:01:54.369> that<00:01:54.520> and<00:01:54.670> it<00:01:54.760> holds<00:01:55.000> a

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
you can tip water in that and it holds a

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.359 
you can tip water in that and it holds a
water<00:01:55.450> as<00:01:55.750> well<00:01:55.960> so<00:01:56.140> giving<00:01:56.530> the<00:01:56.650> fish<00:01:56.979> chance

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 
water as well so giving the fish chance

00:01:57.369 --> 00:01:59.219 
water as well so giving the fish chance
to<00:01:57.580> recover<00:01:57.909> before<00:01:58.390> you<00:01:58.479> let<00:01:58.659> any<00:01:58.810> go<00:01:59.020> so

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 
to recover before you let any go so
