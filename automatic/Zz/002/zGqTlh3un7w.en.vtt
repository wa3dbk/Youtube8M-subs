00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.110 
having to just be okay with it and yeah

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:22.600 
having to just be okay with it and yeah
i'm<00:05:21.320> not<00:05:21.470> a<00:05:21.500> huge<00:05:21.620> party<00:05:22.010> guy<00:05:22.130> she<00:05:22.340> wanted<00:05:22.550> me

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:22.610 
i'm not a huge party guy she wanted me

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:24.190 
i'm not a huge party guy she wanted me
to<00:05:22.640> go<00:05:22.790> to<00:05:22.820> parties<00:05:23.180> with<00:05:23.300> her<00:05:23.450> so<00:05:23.600> i<00:05:23.660> guess<00:05:23.870> i'm

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:24.200 
to go to parties with her so i guess i'm

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.930 
to go to parties with her so i guess i'm
partially<00:05:24.740> to<00:05:24.830> blame<00:05:24.860> for<00:05:25.100> you<00:05:25.520> know<00:05:25.610> that<00:05:25.760> not

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:25.940 
partially to blame for you know that not

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:27.310 
partially to blame for you know that not
working<00:05:26.270> out<00:05:26.360> because<00:05:26.630> I'm<00:05:26.750> not<00:05:26.870> someone<00:05:27.200> who

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:27.320 
working out because I'm not someone who

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.500 
working out because I'm not someone who
really<00:05:27.470> goes<00:05:27.680> to<00:05:27.710> parties<00:05:28.040> but<00:05:28.370> yeah<00:05:29.120> I<00:05:29.150> guess

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:29.510 
really goes to parties but yeah I guess

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:31.690 
really goes to parties but yeah I guess
she<00:05:29.990> just<00:05:30.020> wasn't<00:05:30.320> the<00:05:30.470> right<00:05:30.500> move<00:05:31.220> for<00:05:31.400> me<00:05:31.580> I

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:31.700 
she just wasn't the right move for me I

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:33.700 
she just wasn't the right move for me I
guess<00:05:32.030> so<00:05:32.210> we<00:05:32.330> end<00:05:32.480> up<00:05:32.570> breaking<00:05:32.720> up<00:05:32.990> all<00:05:33.410> good

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:33.710 
guess so we end up breaking up all good

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:35.380 
guess so we end up breaking up all good
in<00:05:33.800> the<00:05:33.860> hood<00:05:33.920> though<00:05:34.250> so<00:05:34.520> as<00:05:34.910> you<00:05:35.060> guys<00:05:35.180> see

in the hood though so as you guys see

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:36.850 
in the hood though so as you guys see
here<00:05:35.600> the<00:05:35.690> scoreboard<00:05:36.110> will<00:05:36.230> pop<00:05:36.410> up<00:05:36.440> you<00:05:36.740> see

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:36.860 
here the scoreboard will pop up you see

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:40.840 
129 kills but he does get one more kill
before<00:05:39.290> the<00:05:39.440> game<00:05:39.650> ends<00:05:40.010> I<00:05:40.130> had<00:05:40.520> to<00:05:40.610> do<00:05:40.700> that

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:40.850 
before the game ends I had to do that

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:42.190 
before the game ends I had to do that
because<00:05:41.030> he<00:05:41.330> only<00:05:41.480> shows<00:05:41.720> that<00:05:41.900> scoreboard

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:42.200 
because he only shows that scoreboard

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.890 
because he only shows that scoreboard
one<00:05:42.500> time<00:05:42.740> so<00:05:43.010> there's<00:05:43.220> the<00:05:43.370> 130th<00:05:44.330> kill<00:05:44.540> so

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:44.900 
one time so there's the 130th kill so

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:46.270 
one time so there's the 130th kill so
