00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.360 
in there and you can do about four or
five<00:01:49.720> of<00:01:49.900> these<00:01:50.140> depending<00:01:50.650> on<00:01:50.800> size<00:01:51.040> of<00:01:51.250> your

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:51.370 
five of these depending on size of your

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:53.640 
five of these depending on size of your
pot<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:52.600> then<00:01:52.690> you're<00:01:52.870> just<00:01:52.900> water<00:01:53.320> here

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:53.650 
pot and then you're just water here

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:55.740 
pot and then you're just water here
through<00:01:54.010> that<00:01:54.190> pot<00:01:54.640> new<00:01:54.790> model<00:01:55.120> right<00:01:55.510> and

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
through that pot new model right and

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.020 
through that pot new model right and
then<00:01:55.870> that<00:01:56.050> also<00:01:56.229> keeps<00:01:56.590> the<00:01:57.400> base<00:01:57.610> of<00:01:57.880> these

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
then that also keeps the base of these

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.480 
then that also keeps the base of these
of<00:01:58.390> these<00:01:58.570> things<00:01:58.930> from<00:01:59.229> from<00:02:00.130> getting<00:02:00.370> too

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
of these things from from getting too

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.750 
of these things from from getting too
much<00:02:00.640> water<00:02:00.700> in<00:02:01.090> writing<00:02:01.979> so<00:02:02.979> that's<00:02:03.220> the<00:02:03.580> the

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:03.760 
much water in writing so that's the the

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.240 
much water in writing so that's the the
neat<00:02:03.940> trick<00:02:04.210> and<00:02:04.450> then<00:02:04.570> you<00:02:04.690> can<00:02:04.900> put<00:02:05.250> your

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
neat trick and then you can put your

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.160 
neat trick and then you can put your
little<00:02:06.460> sign<00:02:06.820> on<00:02:07.030> there<00:02:07.240> that<00:02:07.330> says<00:02:07.600> watch<00:02:07.840> me

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
little sign on there that says watch me

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.250 
little sign on there that says watch me
grow<00:02:09.359> and<00:02:10.359> that's<00:02:10.539> what<00:02:10.689> we<00:02:10.810> like<00:02:10.989> to<00:02:11.019> do

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
grow and that's what we like to do

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.650 
grow and that's what we like to do
that's<00:02:11.499> why<00:02:11.680> we're<00:02:11.859> doing<00:02:11.950> this<00:02:12.249> okay

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
that's why we're doing this okay

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:14.970 
that's why we're doing this okay
we<00:02:13.780> have<00:02:13.870> some<00:02:14.020> other<00:02:14.140> plans<00:02:14.230> to<00:02:14.500> look<00:02:14.680> at<00:02:14.860> now

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
we have some other plans to look at now

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.260 
we have some other plans to look at now
I've<00:02:15.100> got<00:02:15.250> an<00:02:15.340> amaryllis<00:02:15.820> and<00:02:15.970> every<00:02:16.090> time<00:02:16.210> a

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
I've got an amaryllis and every time a

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.120 
I've got an amaryllis and every time a
water<00:02:16.600> if<00:02:16.810> the<00:02:16.930> water<00:02:17.170> just<00:02:17.380> runs<00:02:17.650> through<00:02:17.980> to

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
water if the water just runs through to

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.340 
water if the water just runs through to
rapidly<00:02:18.610> so<00:02:19.270> the<00:02:19.390> soil<00:02:19.660> needs<00:02:19.810> to<00:02:19.900> be<00:02:19.990> replaced

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
rapidly so the soil needs to be replaced

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:21.870 
rapidly so the soil needs to be replaced

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
babies grew around the edge of the leaf

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:35.670 
babies grew around the edge of the leaf
which<00:02:34.810> is<00:02:34.960> one<00:02:35.080> of<00:02:35.110> the<00:02:35.200> nice<00:02:35.350> things<00:02:35.380> about
