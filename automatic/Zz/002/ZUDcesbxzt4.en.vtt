00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.150
 Good day to all I am now 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:11.639
 I will try to make a video review on 

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:13.650
 swiss knife wenger legs missed 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:18.350
 But with such a good aluminum 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:23.490
 the boxes are nice knife model 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:26.420
 ranger mushroom 178 lining she has 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:31.949
 plastic with rubber inserts 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:33.000
 rubber nicely clings to the palm lies 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.710
 in hand well 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 the knife has the function open with one hand 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:43.980
 close also not difficult 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.649
 one-handed blade we have here for. 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.710
 combo ce reiter pretty pretty 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.780
 sweetie 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.100
 also on the blade a nice emphasis for 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.699
 thumb if you do any 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:01:02.489
 power movements 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:05.760
 work so about the backlash like that plus something 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:09.659
 I personally do not observe on this plane 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.820
 play a little bit there Well, how would I 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.430
 I think that it probably should not be much 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.750
 strain so turn and others 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:21.630
 tool here is a wood saw 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:26.580
 I saw a sharp saw in my opinion 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:31.049
 sawed bar about four on 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:34.590
 four centimeters like a hacksaw more convenient 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:38.090
 but if necessary, you can 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:41.130
 so on we have a can opener here 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.259
 tin can i cans yet 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.920
 opened up 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:50.600
 Well, it looks sharply reliable 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:53.340
 even here we have 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:57.000
 flat screwdriver bottle opener 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:02:03.320
 and such an eyelet for removing tiles with 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:06.649
 wiring so lanyard key ring 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.649
 just keychain 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:15.170
 Phillips screwdriver 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:22.019
 so powerful inspire confidence 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:27.870
 awl awl in my opinion blunt gun 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:30.420
 there is like this we are about a tool like 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:34.100
 I would like to talk more about 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:36.780
 the size of this knife 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.819
 because they write different things on the internet 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.670
 120 are written on some sites. 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:45.600
 millimeters blades on some 95 on 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:52.620
 actually cutting edge length approximately 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:57.950
 80 half centimeters that's because 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.950
 there is absolutely no sharpening 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:05.730
 total length of the whole knife 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:10.769
 we get somewhere around 13 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:15.140
 centimeters that's all he wanted 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:21.150
 about him to say but convenient in principle 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:23.630
 a powerful boost trust thanks 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.630
 for your attention
