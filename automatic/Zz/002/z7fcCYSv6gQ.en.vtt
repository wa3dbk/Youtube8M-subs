00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.750
 to film there 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.100
 this would also do so and lab should 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.320
 you definitely check it out 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.940

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.500

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:03.430
 handle things 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.150
 long white plush with banana pancakes 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.500
 us 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.300
 you have not seen what i have not 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.489
 filmed but I was still 5 hours 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.930
 get out of bed because head for again 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:13.700
 london then i had to be 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.140
 period trains that still exist today 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.959
 not 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.520
 I'm pretty broken, give it a tap 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:20.390
 by it is now about an hour up 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.220
 school 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.080
 Friday before that's not really me planning 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:30.920
 go try to finish some video 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:33.440
 but the for now boys also just still 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:37.280
 called good morning 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:40.040
 it is now half past four 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:43.299
 I went to lie I think at half past one 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:46.610
 also thought sleep would take two hours 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:48.830
 it is stress by the way that it will 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.580
 beats really really tasty 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.959
 slept 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:56.150
 if apparently needed I am hungry too 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:03:01.610
 you are just eating a baby sleeping eating 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:05.090
 stroke click also did you just learned 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:09.019
 in between but I'm going to cook now 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:10.640
 I think I have kidney beans with rice and 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:12.620
 then how to make it 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.489
 did you know that fried stove or those 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.130
 who 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:18.890
 really much nicer than just yato 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:20.570
 just eat what you do watch them be 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.549
 much sphincter and on the inside 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:26.000
 they are still a bit fluffy what 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:27.590
 you do is cut the tofu into pieces 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.239
 really dry well because of that 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.890
 they will be crispy if you don't get it right 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:34.670
 then they do not become so crispy 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:38.120
 such a beautiful golden brown and now just one 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.620
 little oil in the pan and frituristen 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.690
 both sides 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.549
 so so so so nice only downside is that 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.110
 So your whole home under wraps 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:46.570
 investigators 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.430
 it and that the button quite a while 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:52.050
 takes before you have done this and 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.050
 So before you actually belongs to sleeve 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:00.190
 lol i had francis last week 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.810
 that actually everything is smarter 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.270
 in more garlic 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.250
 so I'm going to eat a lot of garlic edwin 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:08.560
 normally I use two shifts 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.690
 would be or would I do this 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.070
 for your brain live I'm going to make this 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.870
 for the curry I am going to make but now 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:18.550
 just do the double 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:20.489
 effect has a deer fruit for the 

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:23.170
 curry you add garlic cloves 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:26.380
 so both just had the breakdown 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:28.690
 garlic and tomato onions okay I have 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:30.190
 here so the ropes and done in the 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:33.070
 passata that I'm Coming up yet 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:35.050
 add herbs and then gary is fine 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:38.940
 I rinsed the kidney beans here 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:41.880
 yet you are full of glory 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:44.190
 what a little bit more nutmeg oh yeah 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.110
 and tomato puree 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:47.880
 is also here and stove is 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:49.980
 meanwhile changed to one 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.660
 war zone seeing of course never 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:55.050
 a camera because I am doing well 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:57.390
 this and this market always eat for me 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.770
 10,000 times more delicious and tender but 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:00.510
 then genet pepertje 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:03.420
 despec only with curry so that i 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:04.890
 not completely memnon burned 

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:07.740
 normally I also do it 

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:09.750
 the kidney beans but yes that will be me now 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:13.710
 I just really think something too spicy I 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:16.040
 only do this at the course 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:21.530
 how do you think this should always be such a risk 

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:21.530
 is going to walk with this so okay 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:25.650
 dinner is there I have a little myself 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.210
 nicest rice cooked 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:28.350
 i have here so you name them kidney beans 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:30.570
 and the 

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:32.370
 you could order the curry every day i just got it 

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:33.480
 but just put it all together then it tastes 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:35.850
 it is fine 

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:37.680
 round number 2 sorry this is really such 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:39.180
 no photos your chain is 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.890
 really tasty 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.630
 your check i'm going to india and my 

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:45.810
 body thinks you know what i'm going to do 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:47.510
 natural pin that also give sometime 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:52.460
 just do it that way 

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:54.690
 or maybe so just bucket and how is 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:55.680
 I'm going to throw it 

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:57.870
 I have a final decision 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:59.190
 taken over the kilic and chip it dares 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:01.470
 sincere to say now because i like it 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:04.350
 namely really very beep beep beep beep 

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:06.810
 beep beep beep beep beep but I think 

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:09.270
 don't do it and the simple reason 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:10.410
 that's why it doesn't feel right 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:12.060
 I just have to get close to a feeling 

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:14.669
 I keep what's going on with Sonny today anke 

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:16.770
 Again about you don't know why it is 

00:06:14.669 --> 00:06:18.630
 where just do what you feel 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:20.910
 says despite being such a picture 

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:22.740
 perfect to do it 

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:24.690
 you know it seems so super fat to me 

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:26.730
 climb kilimanjaro i wear warsaw 

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:29.190

 just wondering because it is currently 

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:48.920

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:53.210
 is me and i am sorry 

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:55.160
 terrible but the feeling of you 

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:56.840
 it really shouldn't do that dominate 

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:58.940
 so strong that I just don't 

00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:02.240
