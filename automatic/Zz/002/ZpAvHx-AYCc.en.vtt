00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:03.620
 very good to all kids how about 

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:05.540
 you are good I bring another video here 

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.250
 regarding the zombies of black ops 2 and 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.740
 this video is going to be very short 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:12.499
 because I'm just going to show you how 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:14.539
 get the tomahawk you do not get a 

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:16.789
 very easy way and it is an accessory that 

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:18.939
 if you want to hold a high number 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:21.380
 of rounds, let's say it's essential 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:25.009
 the only thing that you will have to do will be 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:27.589
 search by map 33 let's say and brands 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:29.990
 on the wall and those three brands 

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:33.830
 they represent as you are seeing the 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:35.510
 appearance of three dogs dogs of the 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:37.420
 demonic dogs that the only thing that 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.760
 you have to do it because it will feed them 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.770
 with let's say I think they were six to 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.300
 seven zombies that the most killed 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:47.080
 you just have to kill them by the side 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.370
 of the head and the head are eating them 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.140
 herself without doing anything good the 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.360
 second you can see that it is 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.000
 here that I know where the door that goes 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.860
 pulling to to assemble the plane 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.170
 you just have to do the same 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.060
 you have to go back to having to go back to 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.460
 kill another one here the head is activated and 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:06.020
 he is eating his fucking taste not 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.299
 he has no more 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.700
 you have to one of these that you can 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:13.520
 do with low rounds so that we 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:16.729
 many, many enemies appear 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.380
 and well it's just the same thing you see there 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:19.880
 it has just been released because now 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.979
 he ate six or seven he was already 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.829
 embajado already simply have to do 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.750
 the last one that is outside that you can 

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:29.569
 get off on chairlift or get off good by 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.250
 where you want and as you see is here 

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:33.350
 simply to re-activate it another 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.010
 next time 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.340
 you wait there 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.840
 you break it there and the same thing comes out again 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.840
 again he is eating it as you can 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.940
 see and you have nothing to give again six 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.640
 or seven as soon as it is closed as it is 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:50.880
 time to go catch our our best 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.810
 not then do you here a little the 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.930
 silly while 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:58.540
 ok and when we have it they will activate 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.759
 is going to activate a door and up you go 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.710
 to be able to see rivals at the door you go to 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:05.049
 can see three dog heads 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.340
 illuminated that means that good 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:08.349
 because the door has been unlocked 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.840
 and you can go collect your prize 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:11.380
 then you can go up here there is no 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.480
 problems 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.660
 you can put here I think it's the 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.459
 faster way you can open this that 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.660
 are worth 1500 and now we have to go up 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:23.980
 up all the way to the top of 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.060
 you have to open another door 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.660
 that's worth 1000 that's good there goes with a 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.960
 partner we take us and we are taking turns 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.880
 we climb to the top 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.110
 here I think there's going to be another door if 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.030
 I'm not mistaken 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.010
 that this is where by where 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.440
 you go down when you want to get the pieces 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.820
 of the plane when you get off in a ghost and 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.250
 here is the last door that you must 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.440
 open I say it to do it from a 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.960
 fast way because simply 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.420
 we went in to record this so and 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:54.030
 now pay attention that there they are 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.190
 the symbols and the tomahawk in front of that 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.080
 all you have to do is go and 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.850
 to take it does not have more does not have more 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.520
 difficulty and will be with us 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.560
 until the game ends as 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:07.650
 You see, it's a very easy thing and I 'm telling you 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.209
 which is very helpful so I do not expect anything 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.230
 that you liked the video and in the 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:12.230
 next goodbye
