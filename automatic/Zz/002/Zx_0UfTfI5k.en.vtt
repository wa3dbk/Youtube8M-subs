00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:18.900
 there are miners as they are today I come to you with 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.130
 something very very different a kind of 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.289
 video that the truth was coming thinking 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.029
 a long time ago and good too 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.220
 can you tell us a little more about the 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.900
 bp world so I have the 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.859
 better news or at least for me 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.059
 where they are the most important 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:34.920
 probably in that season there 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.140
 a new princess this is not 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.930
 confirmed yet but it could be called 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:43.350
 the princess stack very interesting by 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.239
 true because it does not make a couple of has 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.879
 added a new item in the store 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.309
 of xbox live for the beloved bronis 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.220
 it seems to be a halloween costume but 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.800
 king version fashions 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:57.190
 great I only want and it only costs 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.190
 three dollars 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:05.080
 already came the official comic number 23 of 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:07.600
 mp it seems that in this new section there is no 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.220
 it's a lot about the main fates 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.940
 in your pets that take a trip 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:14.440
 to be able to find them even if this one is 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.900
 now I think it's the most important of 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:19.060
 this week or of these last days for 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.640
 make a complaint but your collaboration ends 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.979
 with strong discovery hood taking 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.260
 discovery control of the channel going on 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:28.330
 the call discord and family network 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:31.030
 truce away Brazil has had control 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.500
 of the channel but for a couple of hours 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.960
 the moment this does not mean a change 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.270
 of programming and it may be possible that 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.979
 Yew lasers will move to another channel 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.350
 but even this is not completely 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:43.540
 confirmed but imagine mp in 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.970
 cartoon network as an example to 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:48.040
 new for example I do not know 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.740
 nickelodeon or good god I think not in 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:53.850
 disney but do not know what must happen 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.830
 wait to see what happens 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.170
 it is very possible that there is another new 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.030
 episode of darling in the fifth 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.360
 season as in the previous 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.360
 episodes 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.570
 new vinyl and officers are released 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:10.990
 of mp there are two versions the version 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:13.750
 celestial and the moon version both discs 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:16.480
 they have 12 songs including in gala 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:20.220
 they are among the most popular those who love 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:24.160
 fans like smile winter grab and so on 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:26.890
 and I want a new line of candy 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.020
 ponys is scheduled to address 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.660
 europe or rather australia and 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:34.720
 germany there is a company called chocolate 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:37.840
 bodies that has everything from eggs to 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.430
 chocolate until marshmallows in I think that 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.980
 they'll be proud at least 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.530
 they appeared the package to be 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.930
 web concert called party city has 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.030
 started to design several bp suits 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:52.420
 like the one we see here the rhythm 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:55.630
 between all and others are not 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:58.240
 pretty good but I think that does not 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.310
 I would buy them 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:03.370

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.960

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.690
 constantly more updated and upload 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:18.610
