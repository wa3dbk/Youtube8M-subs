00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.760
 and I will do is one thing that is what it is 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.760
 check sample 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:11.920
 the idea that we were facing these 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.870
 gentlemen who like the subject of 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:18.040
 to get to the essence is to be able to create a 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:18.040
 comfort index be 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.869
 so what do we do 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:31.000
 We put a series of accelerometers 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:33.850
 triaxial in different elements of the 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.350
 car two of which are the steering wheel and 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.300
 the seat the savings guide and then 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.739
 for the rest of the elements of a car 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.739
 that are not interesting 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:50.719
 what we are doing is trying 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:53.390
 translate those those values ​​into great things 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:55.339
 steering wheel I have a high acceleration in 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.589
 and c but result accelerations in 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:59.239
 flyer those that are annoying are in x 

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:01.370
 the decelerations in anthem te 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:03.140
 they bother then all that later you have it 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.580
 what to ponder, you have to give it a 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.659
 weight based on what you see that 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.659
 annoying or not 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.030
 if for this part we are seven people 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.770
 these seven people we have an average 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:21.240
 person shared with another department 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:24.270
 which is simulation we use the system 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.939
 simulation adams and we have it at 50% 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.810
 as a simulator in 50% like 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.810
 experimenter 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:42.909
 these things for Carlos before these 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.590
 cars are suspension are sports 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:46.000
 they are pulling hard and instead the 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.260
 perception that many of the 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.720
 journalists that you have passed is therefore 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:51.729
 look and since they are very comfortable 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.369
 you already know why because they have a 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:56.979
 very good rolling filter very well 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:58.479
 this little roughness that the almond 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:00.580
 focuses it very well but the change the 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.470
 vertical movement is hard because we 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.170
 we have realized that the movement 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.479
 vertical hard shows less than a car 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:11.310
 that is in theory speaking but that go 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.310
 copying the small saves
