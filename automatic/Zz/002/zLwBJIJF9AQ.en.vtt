00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
cutting board and I smashed some fresh

garlic putting it here into the vinegar
which<00:01:01.200> is<00:01:01.350> going<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:01.739> infuse<00:01:02.160> it<00:01:02.340> with<00:01:02.460> the

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
which is going to infuse it with the

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.859 
which is going to infuse it with the
flavors<00:01:03.360> I<00:01:04.670> have<00:01:05.670> a<00:01:05.759> little<00:01:05.880> mini<00:01:06.119> whisk<00:01:06.450> here

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
flavors I have a little mini whisk here

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.960 
flavors I have a little mini whisk here
and<00:01:07.220> basically<00:01:08.220> what<00:01:08.460> I'm<00:01:08.520> going<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:08.700> do<00:01:08.820> is

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
and basically what I'm going to do is

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.730 
and basically what I'm going to do is
keep<00:01:09.180> stirring<00:01:09.660> this<00:01:10.310> drizzling<00:01:11.310> in<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:12.180> oil

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
keep stirring this drizzling in the oil

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.240 
keep stirring this drizzling in the oil
so<00:01:13.740> it<00:01:13.830> emulsifies<00:01:14.190> and<00:01:15.530> becomes<00:01:16.530> nice<00:01:16.890> and

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
so it emulsifies and becomes nice and

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:26.600 
so it emulsifies and becomes nice and
creamy<00:01:17.670> a<00:01:18.119> little<00:01:18.780> drizzle<00:01:19.020> at<00:01:19.289> a<00:01:19.320> time<00:01:25.550> if<00:01:26.550> you

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
creamy a little drizzle at a time if you

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:38.030 
creamy a little drizzle at a time if you
can<00:01:26.880> see<00:01:27.119> it's<00:01:27.300> starting<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:27.780> thicken<00:01:28.020> up<00:01:37.040> you

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
can see it's starting to thicken up you

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.770 
can see it's starting to thicken up you
want<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.340> hole<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.580> be<00:01:38.729> suspended<00:01:39.360> in<00:01:39.659> the

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
want the hole to be suspended in the

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.399 
want the hole to be suspended in the
vinegar<00:01:40.229> I<00:01:41.810> don't<00:01:42.810> know<00:01:42.900> if<00:01:42.990> you<00:01:43.049> could<00:01:43.200> see

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
vinegar I don't know if you could see

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.569 
vinegar I don't know if you could see
that<00:01:43.590> getting<00:01:43.799> nice<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:44.159> thick

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:46.579 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:49.160 

now<00:01:47.579> I'm<00:01:47.880> sure<00:01:48.119> there's<00:01:48.329> other<00:01:48.509> ways<00:01:48.720> of<00:01:48.990> doing

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
now I'm sure there's other ways of doing

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.960 
now I'm sure there's other ways of doing
it<00:01:49.409> but<00:01:49.470> this<00:01:49.799> is<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.130> way<00:01:50.280> I've<00:01:50.430> always<00:01:50.520> done

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
it but this is the way I've always done

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.950 
it but this is the way I've always done
it<00:01:52.009> you<00:01:53.009> know<00:01:53.299> you<00:01:54.299> could<00:01:54.450> add<00:01:54.570> a<00:01:54.600> little<00:01:54.869> bit

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
it you know you could add a little bit

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.980 
it you know you could add a little bit
of<00:01:55.049> salt<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.470> this<00:01:55.770> if<00:01:56.130> you<00:01:56.159> want<00:01:59.750> again<00:02:00.750> with

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
of salt to this if you want again with

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:09.699 
of salt to this if you want again with
cooking<00:02:01.290> it's<00:02:01.710> all<00:02:01.979> a<00:02:05.570> matter<00:02:06.570> of<00:02:06.770> taste

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
cooking it's all a matter of taste

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:15.140 
cooking it's all a matter of taste
so<00:02:10.709> basically<00:02:11.159> here's<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:12.060> mojito<00:02:14.000> and<00:02:15.000> you
