or<00:00:00.900> we<00:00:00.989> start<00:00:01.199> the<00:00:01.290> show<00:00:01.500> so<00:00:02.070> basically<00:00:02.399> this

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:02.939 
or we start the show so basically this

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:04.640 
or we start the show so basically this
is<00:00:03.000> called<00:00:03.510> the<00:00:03.600> industrial<00:00:04.170> control<00:00:04.500> across

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
is called the industrial control across

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.450 
is called the industrial control across
from<00:00:04.980> demo<00:00:05.899> it's<00:00:06.899> based<00:00:07.170> off<00:00:07.350> a<00:00:07.649> pipe<00:00:08.220> dream

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
from demo it's based off a pipe dream

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.640 
from demo it's based off a pipe dream
music<00:00:09.240> video<00:00:09.750> I<00:00:09.809> guess<00:00:10.080> that<00:00:10.290> was<00:00:10.349> digitally

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
music video I guess that was digitally

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.310 
music video I guess that was digitally
animated<00:00:11.099> I<00:00:11.280> was<00:00:11.550> made<00:00:11.730> by<00:00:11.759> an<00:00:11.940> amusing<00:00:12.630> and

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
animated I was made by an amusing and

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.640 
animated I was made by an amusing and
this<00:00:13.440> was<00:00:13.620> over<00:00:13.950> seven<00:00:14.790> years<00:00:14.910> ago<00:00:15.650> so

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
this was over seven years ago so

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:17.870 
this was over seven years ago so
originally<00:00:16.949> it<00:00:17.190> was<00:00:17.250> thought<00:00:17.340> that<00:00:17.490> this<00:00:17.760> is

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
originally it was thought that this is

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.370 
originally it was thought that this is
going<00:00:18.000> to<00:00:18.090> be<00:00:18.210> kind<00:00:18.539> of<00:00:18.600> brought<00:00:18.930> in<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.199> life

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
going to be kind of brought in the life

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.740 
going to be kind of brought in the life
but<00:00:19.740> that<00:00:20.640> was<00:00:20.730> our<00:00:20.850> challenge<00:00:21.270> and<00:00:21.390> we<00:00:21.449> did<00:00:21.630> it

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
but that was our challenge and we did it

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.679 
but that was our challenge and we did it
and<00:00:21.900> we<00:00:22.080> did<00:00:22.260> it<00:00:22.380> in<00:00:22.470> 90<00:00:22.800> days<00:00:22.980> which<00:00:23.310> is<00:00:23.689> pretty

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
and we did it in 90 days which is pretty

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.990 
and we did it in 90 days which is pretty
outstanding<00:00:24.990> so<00:00:25.560> Street<00:00:26.310> reviewed<00:00:26.640> a<00:00:26.730> lot<00:00:26.880> of

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
outstanding so Street reviewed a lot of

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.740 
outstanding so Street reviewed a lot of
this<00:00:27.119> deciding<00:00:27.840> on<00:00:28.160> Intel<00:00:29.160> Architecture

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:29.750 
this deciding on Intel Architecture

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:31.370 
this deciding on Intel Architecture
especially<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.840> hardware<00:00:31.170> and<00:00:31.199> software

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
especially the hardware and software

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.950 
especially the hardware and software
side<00:00:31.769> so<00:00:32.149> I'll<00:00:33.149> get<00:00:33.270> more<00:00:33.390> into<00:00:33.480> that<00:00:33.630> after

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
side so I'll get more into that after

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.139 
side so I'll get more into that after
show<00:00:34.230> but<00:00:34.440> now<00:00:34.710> just<00:00:35.579> we'll<00:00:35.700> go<00:00:35.820> ahead<00:00:35.940> and

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
show but now just we'll go ahead and

00:00:36.149 --> 00:04:33.040 
show but now just we'll go ahead and
pick<00:00:36.270> up<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:36.750> throw<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.590> show

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:37.400 

so<00:04:34.050> pretty<00:04:34.440> cool<00:04:35.660> like<00:04:36.660> I<00:04:36.780> said<00:04:36.960> before<00:04:37.050> this

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410 
so pretty cool like I said before this

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.680 
so pretty cool like I said before this
was<00:04:37.620> all<00:04:37.830> made<00:04:38.070> and<00:04:38.310> from<00:04:39.240> concept<00:04:39.570> to

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
was all made and from concept to

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.230 
was all made and from concept to
creation<00:04:39.840> in<00:04:40.110> just<00:04:40.290> 90<00:04:40.560> days<00:04:40.880> there's<00:04:41.880> seven

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
creation in just 90 days there's seven

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.000 
creation in just 90 days there's seven

there's also three different operating
systems<00:05:03.690> that<00:05:04.260> are<00:05:04.350> all<00:05:04.470> working<00:05:04.650> together

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:04.889 
systems that are all working together

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:07.129

there's<00:05:05.340> a<00:05:05.400> real-time<00:05:06.120> operating<00:05:06.510> system<00:05:06.930> in

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:07.139 
there's a real-time operating system in

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:09.080 
there's a real-time operating system in
the<00:05:07.200> middle<00:05:07.500> there's<00:05:07.979> a<00:05:08.040> windows<00:05:08.460> and<00:05:08.820> XP

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.090
