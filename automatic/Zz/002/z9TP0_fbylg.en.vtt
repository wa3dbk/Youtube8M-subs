00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
square grid and on there I can use that

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.920 
square grid and on there I can use that
to<00:01:17.009> draw<00:01:17.220> graphs<00:01:17.580> or<00:01:17.970> straight<00:01:18.299> lines<00:01:18.600> or

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
to draw graphs or straight lines or

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.800 
to draw graphs or straight lines or
arrows<00:01:19.380> as<00:01:19.619> I<00:01:20.400> see<00:01:20.700> fit<00:01:21.030> there<00:01:21.270> we<00:01:21.390> go<00:01:21.540> there's

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
arrows as I see fit there we go there's

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.410 
arrows as I see fit there we go there's
my<00:01:21.869> first<00:01:22.259> line<00:01:22.650> so<00:01:23.430> I<00:01:23.460> could<00:01:23.759> actually<00:01:23.970> draw

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420

my first line so I could actually draw
an<00:01:24.570> axis<00:01:24.720> on<00:01:25.170> this<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.700> recreate<00:01:26.700> for<00:01:27.030> my

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
an axis on this and recreate for my

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.350 
an axis on this and recreate for my
students<00:01:27.810> a<00:01:27.990> graph<00:01:28.920> if<00:01:29.430> I'm<00:01:29.790> teaching<00:01:30.180> math

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
students a graph if I'm teaching math

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.810 
students a graph if I'm teaching math
for<00:01:30.720> example<00:01:31.130> or<00:01:32.130> I<00:01:32.159> can<00:01:32.369> change<00:01:32.610> my

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
for example or I can change my

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.260

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
background so that I have lock paper for

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.030 
background so that I have lock paper for
writing<00:01:36.450> you<00:01:36.810> can<00:01:36.960> see<00:01:37.140> how<00:01:37.259> that<00:01:37.439> slipped<00:01:37.680> out

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
writing you can see how that slipped out

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.760 
writing you can see how that slipped out
the<00:01:38.130> way<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.820> I<00:01:39.060> can<00:01:39.360> scribble<00:01:40.110> away<00:01:40.259> just

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
the way and I can scribble away just

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.679 
the way and I can scribble away just
with<00:01:40.920> my<00:01:41.070> pen<00:01:41.340> I<00:01:41.369> can<00:01:41.640> choose<00:01:41.939> a<00:01:41.970> color<00:01:42.390> there
