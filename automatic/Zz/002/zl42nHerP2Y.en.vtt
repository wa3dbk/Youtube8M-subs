them I put into greenhouse conditions

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.670 
them I put into greenhouse conditions
and<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.359> other<00:00:24.480> one<00:00:24.689> I<00:00:24.869> just<00:00:25.109> put<00:00:25.260> in<00:00:25.380> a<00:00:25.470> warm

thousand bucks I'm going to show you how

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.020 
thousand bucks I'm going to show you how
easy<00:00:51.690> they<00:00:51.930> are<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:52.140> install<00:00:52.579> this<00:00:53.579> corner<00:00:53.940> of

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
easy they are to install this corner of

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.520 
easy they are to install this corner of
the<00:00:54.059> yard<00:00:54.239> doesn't<00:00:54.570> get<00:00:54.780> used<00:00:55.020> for<00:00:55.230> much<00:00:55.350> more

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
the yard doesn't get used for much more

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.799 
the yard doesn't get used for much more
than<00:00:55.590> mowing<00:00:55.920> catch<00:00:56.730> is<00:00:56.910> a<00:00:56.940> good<00:00:57.149> range<00:00:57.390> of<00:00:57.510> sun

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
than mowing catch is a good range of sun

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.479 
than mowing catch is a good range of sun
and<00:00:57.960> it's<00:00:58.199> protected<00:00:58.710> from<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.920> worst<00:00:59.129> wind

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
and it's protected from the worst wind

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.479 
and it's protected from the worst wind
so<00:00:59.820> it's<00:00:59.940> a<00:01:00.000> perfect<00:01:00.480> spot<00:01:00.690> for<00:01:00.719> a<00:01:00.899> greenhouse

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
so it's a perfect spot for a greenhouse

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:04.189 
so it's a perfect spot for a greenhouse
first<00:01:02.489> off<00:01:02.730> you<00:01:02.879> need<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.120> floor<00:01:03.359> if<00:01:03.660> you<00:01:04.080> have<00:01:04.170> a

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
first off you need a floor if you have a

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.990 
first off you need a floor if you have a
level<00:01:04.409> area<00:01:04.799> you<00:01:04.979> might<00:01:05.159> just<00:01:05.369> lay<00:01:05.610> a<00:01:05.640> grab<00:01:05.970> a

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
level area you might just lay a grab a

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.880 
level area you might just lay a grab a
bit<00:01:06.360> but<00:01:06.689> we<00:01:06.780> have<00:01:06.900> a<00:01:06.930> bit<00:01:07.049> of<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.200> slope<00:01:07.530> so<00:01:07.770> I'm

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
bit but we have a bit of a slope so I'm

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.710 
bit but we have a bit of a slope so I'm
going<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.189> make<00:01:08.310> a<00:01:08.340> jetty<00:01:08.640> style<00:01:09.000> floor<00:01:09.299> using

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
going to make a jetty style floor using

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.690 
going to make a jetty style floor using
sleepers<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.650> floor<00:01:10.920> is<00:01:11.040> simple<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.460> lay<00:01:11.640> but

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
sleepers the floor is simple to lay but

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.090 
sleepers the floor is simple to lay but
first<00:01:12.090> it<00:01:12.240> has<00:01:12.299> to<00:01:12.479> be<00:01:12.570> marked<00:01:12.900> out<00:01:13.110> I'm<00:01:13.470> making

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
first it has to be marked out I'm making

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.260 
first it has to be marked out I'm making

around a little as they dry out so you

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.230
