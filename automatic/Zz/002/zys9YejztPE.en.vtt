we<00:01:37.200> can<00:01:37.380> actually<00:01:38.390> quadruple<00:01:39.390> our<00:01:41.060> yield

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
we can actually quadruple our yield

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.620 
we can actually quadruple our yield

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.340 
little seedlings push from the bottom
you<00:02:03.670> can<00:02:03.700> squeeze<00:02:04.150> it<00:02:04.330> a<00:02:04.390> little<00:02:04.420> bit<00:02:04.750> or<00:02:04.990> push

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
you can squeeze it a little bit or push

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.770 
you can squeeze it a little bit or push
at<00:02:05.590> it<00:02:05.939> to<00:02:06.939> free<00:02:07.270> up<00:02:08.130> the<00:02:09.130> roots<00:02:09.520> and<00:02:09.819> soil<00:02:10.209> from

look very sad most of the time they will

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:15.449 
look very sad most of the time they will
bounce<00:03:11.590> back<00:03:11.790> from<00:03:12.790> being<00:03:13.630> transplanted<00:03:14.459> but

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
bounce back from being transplanted but

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:18.420 
bounce back from being transplanted but
if<00:03:15.670> we<00:03:15.850> transplant<00:03:16.359> in<00:03:16.510> the<00:03:16.540> evening<00:03:17.430> we'll

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
if we transplant in the evening we'll

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.910 
if we transplant in the evening we'll
have<00:03:18.670> a<00:03:19.000> little<00:03:19.480> bit<00:03:19.660> of<00:03:19.780> time<00:03:19.989> overnight<00:03:20.380> for

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
have a little bit of time overnight for

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.020 
have a little bit of time overnight for
the<00:03:21.010> plants<00:03:21.310> to<00:03:21.400> get<00:03:21.519> used<00:03:21.730> to<00:03:21.880> their<00:03:22.000> new

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
the plants to get used to their new

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.420 
the plants to get used to their new
surroundings<00:03:22.150> and<00:03:22.930> there'll<00:03:23.650> be<00:03:23.709> less<00:03:24.070> likely

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
surroundings and there'll be less likely

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.000 
surroundings and there'll be less likely
to<00:03:24.609> go<00:03:24.850> into<00:03:25.180> transplant<00:03:26.019> shock<00:03:26.079> which<00:03:26.769> means

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
to go into transplant shock which means

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.310 
to go into transplant shock which means
that<00:03:27.130> they<00:03:27.370> wilt<00:03:27.820> and<00:03:28.030> look<00:03:28.209> terrible<00:03:28.570> but

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.320 
that they wilt and look terrible but

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.289 
that they wilt and look terrible but
again<00:03:30.010> most<00:03:30.190> of<00:03:30.340> the<00:03:30.430> time<00:03:30.640> they<00:03:30.790> bounce<00:03:31.000> back

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:31.299 
again most of the time they bounce back

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:34.680 
again most of the time they bounce back
so<00:03:32.370> that's<00:03:33.370> how<00:03:33.670> to<00:03:33.730> transplant<00:03:34.359> our
