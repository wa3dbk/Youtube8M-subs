leave things in your life when you're

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
doing this then you get a brush as a

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.570 
doing this then you get a brush as a
fine<00:01:15.659> toothed<00:01:16.080> comb<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.590> brush<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:17.100> fine

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
fine toothed comb to brush a fine

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.570 
fine toothed comb to brush a fine

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
toothed comb a fine comb tooth to the

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.280 
toothed comb a fine comb tooth to the
pollen<00:01:21.150> brush<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:22.369> backcomb<00:01:23.369> all<00:01:24.150> of<00:01:24.630> your

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
pollen brush and backcomb all of your

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.499 
pollen brush and backcomb all of your
hair<00:01:25.799> that<00:01:25.830> you're<00:01:26.100> going<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.400> do<00:01:26.490> ombres<00:01:26.880> now

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
hair that you're going to do ombres now

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.090 
hair that you're going to do ombres now
the<00:01:27.570> reason<00:01:28.140> for<00:01:28.170> this<00:01:28.380> is<00:01:28.590> because<00:01:28.680> it<00:01:28.890> paused

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
the reason for this is because it paused

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.380 
the reason for this is because it paused
the<00:01:29.250> hairs<00:01:29.460> different<00:01:29.670> lengths<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.270> it

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
the hairs different lengths and it

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.390 
the hairs different lengths and it
allows<00:01:30.659> for<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.900> gradient<00:01:31.170> rather<00:01:31.950> than<00:01:32.250> just

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
allows for the gradient rather than just

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.370 
allows for the gradient rather than just
a<00:01:32.520> flat<00:01:32.820> line<00:01:33.090> of<00:01:33.420> where<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.750> ambra<00:01:34.020> starts

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
a flat line of where the ambra starts

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.499 
a flat line of where the ambra starts
and<00:01:34.590> finishes<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:35.610> if<00:01:36.060> that<00:01:36.150> doesn't<00:01:36.479> look

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
and finishes and if that doesn't look

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.810 
and finishes and if that doesn't look
that<00:01:36.900> doesn't<00:01:37.350> look<00:01:37.500> that<00:01:37.560> me<00:01:37.829> that<00:01:38.520> makes<00:01:38.729> it

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
that doesn't look that me that makes it

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.370 
that doesn't look that me that makes it
look<00:01:38.970> like<00:01:39.000> you've<00:01:39.329> had<00:01:39.570> it<00:01:39.750> and<00:01:39.930> done<00:01:40.140> by

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
20 minutes and make sure it's set in and

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.029 
20 minutes and make sure it's set in and
it's<00:02:08.640> lifting<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.569> next<00:02:09.929> stage<00:02:10.140> is<00:02:10.410> to<00:02:10.590> get<00:02:10.800> a

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
it's lifting the next stage is to get a

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.229 
it's lifting the next stage is to get a
little<00:02:11.310> bit<00:02:11.550> more<00:02:11.819> of<00:02:12.090> your<00:02:12.209> pre-mixed

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239 
little bit more of your pre-mixed

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:16.350 
little bit more of your pre-mixed
and<00:02:13.360> add<00:02:13.810> it<00:02:14.560> to<00:02:14.830> the<00:02:14.890> section<00:02:15.790> above<00:02:16.060> so<00:02:16.239> about

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
and add it to the section above so about

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.729 
and add it to the section above so about
half<00:02:16.629> an<00:02:16.870> inch<00:02:17.050> above<00:02:17.550> where<00:02:18.550> you<00:02:18.849> started<00:02:19.450> and

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
half an inch above where you started and

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.500 
half an inch above where you started and
this<00:02:20.739> will<00:02:20.980> also<00:02:21.220> add<00:02:21.400> to<00:02:21.700> the<00:02:21.790> gradient<00:02:22.030> so<00:02:22.450> if

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
this will also add to the gradient so if

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.880 
this will also add to the gradient so if
you<00:02:22.569> can<00:02:22.720> see<00:02:22.930> here<00:02:23.940> it<00:02:24.940> fades<00:02:25.390> down<00:02:25.800> so<00:02:26.800> it

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
you can see here it fades down so it

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.100 
you can see here it fades down so it
goes<00:02:27.069> through<00:02:27.370> the<00:02:27.459> series<00:02:27.760> of<00:02:27.910> brown<00:02:28.180> rather

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
goes through the series of brown rather

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.750 
goes through the series of brown rather
than<00:02:29.379> just<00:02:29.560> going<00:02:29.680> flat<00:02:30.099> blonde<00:02:30.370> whoa

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
than just going flat blonde whoa

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.360 
than just going flat blonde whoa

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
but yeah once this is done rinse it all

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.430 
but yeah once this is done rinse it all
