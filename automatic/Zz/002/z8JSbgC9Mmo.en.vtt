was<00:03:11.550> purely<00:03:11.910> intuition<00:03:12.300> but<00:03:12.420> it<00:03:12.510> clearly<00:03:12.810> pays

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
was purely intuition but it clearly pays

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.410 
was purely intuition but it clearly pays
off<00:03:13.380> I<00:03:13.680> then<00:03:14.550> proceed<00:03:14.940> to<00:03:14.970> put<00:03:15.120> as<00:03:15.239> much

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
off I then proceed to put as much

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.240 
off I then proceed to put as much
distance<00:03:15.630> as<00:03:15.959> possible<00:03:16.020> between<00:03:16.470> myself<00:03:16.950> and

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
distance as possible between myself and

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:18.979 
distance as possible between myself and
those<00:03:17.400> Titans<00:03:17.820> until<00:03:18.120> I<00:03:18.150> can<00:03:18.330> Riku<00:03:18.690> for<00:03:18.959> a

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
those Titans until I can Riku for a

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:22.250 
those Titans until I can Riku for a
second<00:03:19.290> attack<00:03:20.420> so<00:03:21.420> as<00:03:21.540> you<00:03:21.690> can<00:03:21.810> see<00:03:22.019> I've

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
second attack so as you can see I've

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.380 
second attack so as you can see I've
dodged<00:03:22.470> and<00:03:22.800> ran<00:03:22.920> away<00:03:23.040> but<00:03:23.820> I<00:03:23.940> still<00:03:24.120> need<00:03:24.300> to

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
dodged and ran away but I still need to

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:25.430 
dodged and ran away but I still need to
live<00:03:24.540> to<00:03:24.690> fight<00:03:24.720> another<00:03:24.930> day

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
live to fight another day

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.160 
live to fight another day
so<00:03:25.769> here<00:03:25.980> we<00:03:26.100> go<00:03:26.250> I'm<00:03:26.580> going<00:03:26.910> to<00:03:27.000> come<00:03:27.840> up<00:03:27.870> on

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
so here we go I'm going to come up on

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.170 
so here we go I'm going to come up on
these<00:03:28.260> Titans<00:03:28.650> here<00:03:28.920> and<00:03:29.160> I'm<00:03:29.459> gonna<00:03:29.640> see<00:03:29.940> that

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
these Titans here and I'm gonna see that

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.509 
these Titans here and I'm gonna see that
this<00:03:30.900> Titan<00:03:31.320> right<00:03:31.470> here<00:03:31.709> is<00:03:31.860> all<00:03:32.040> well<00:03:32.310> at

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
this Titan right here is all well at

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:34.729 
this Titan right here is all well at
least<00:03:32.610> I<00:03:32.790> thought<00:03:33.060> so<00:03:33.420> I<00:03:33.690> changed<00:03:34.440> my<00:03:34.470> mind

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
least I thought so I changed my mind

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:37.070 
least I thought so I changed my mind
seeing<00:03:35.160> its<00:03:35.340> buddies<00:03:35.700> actually<00:03:36.120> there<00:03:36.360> and

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
seeing its buddies actually there and

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.860 
seeing its buddies actually there and
decide<00:03:37.410> that<00:03:37.440> I<00:03:38.040> better<00:03:38.580> get<00:03:38.790> him<00:03:38.970> alone<00:03:39.180> so<00:03:39.450> I

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
decide that I better get him alone so I

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.990 
decide that I better get him alone so I
used<00:03:40.200> my<00:03:40.380> stim<00:03:40.890> pack<00:03:41.100> to<00:03:41.310> get<00:03:41.489> up<00:03:41.640> to<00:03:41.850> him

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
used my stim pack to get up to him

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.870 
used my stim pack to get up to him
really<00:03:42.209> quick<00:03:42.450> and<00:03:42.780> then<00:03:43.019> I<00:03:43.080> use<00:03:43.700> justice'<00:03:44.700> for

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
really quick and then I use justice' for

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.910 
really quick and then I use justice' for
audio<00:03:45.090> technique<00:03:45.570> to<00:03:45.870> take<00:03:46.170> this<00:03:46.290> guy<00:03:46.500> on<00:03:46.680> 101

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
audio technique to take this guy on 101

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.110 
audio technique to take this guy on 101
now<00:03:47.670> that<00:03:47.850> he's<00:03:47.970> isolated<00:03:48.480> for<00:03:48.600> his<00:03:48.720> friends

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
now that he's isolated for his friends

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.229 
now that he's isolated for his friends

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
get distracted a little bit I will

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.590 
get distracted a little bit I will

and<00:04:10.260> last<00:04:10.530> but<00:04:10.710> not<00:04:10.860> least<00:04:11.100> we<00:04:11.310> have<00:04:11.340> tip

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610 
and last but not least we have tip

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
that this game has a great movement

system but when it comes to gunplay it's

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
stuck in that mindset then you're going

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:24.730 
stuck in that mindset then you're going
to<00:04:23.490> flounder<00:04:23.760> against<00:04:24.210> better<00:04:24.420> players

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:28.350 
get the kill but I probably would have

mean yet this clip really captures the

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.300 
mean yet this clip really captures the
technique<00:05:41.480> perfectly<00:05:41.990> while<00:05:42.770> I<00:05:42.800> get<00:05:43.010> the<00:05:43.100> drop

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:43.310 
technique perfectly while I get the drop

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:45.520 
technique perfectly while I get the drop
on<00:05:43.430> this<00:05:43.550> player<00:05:43.790> he<00:05:44.060> still<00:05:44.300> notices<00:05:44.720> me<00:05:44.900> so

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:45.530 
on this player he still notices me so

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:47.080 
on this player he still notices me so
watch<00:05:45.710> where<00:05:45.920> he's<00:05:46.070> aiming<00:05:46.400> as<00:05:46.520> I'll<00:05:46.670> wall<00:05:46.850> run

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:47.090 
watch where he's aiming as I'll wall run

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:53.860 
watch where he's aiming as I'll wall run
and<00:05:47.300> double<00:05:47.570> jump<00:05:47.720> over<00:05:48.050> his<00:05:48.170> head<00:05:52.720> watch<00:05:53.720> the

and double jump over his head watch the
clip<00:05:54.050> again<00:05:54.320> in<00:05:54.470> slow<00:05:54.650> motion

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:55.220 
clip again in slow motion

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:56.830 
clip again in slow motion
and<00:05:55.340> you'll<00:05:55.520> really<00:05:55.730> see<00:05:55.970> how<00:05:56.150> the<00:05:56.210> guy<00:05:56.450> fails

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:56.840 
and you'll really see how the guy fails

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:58.840 
and you'll really see how the guy fails
to<00:05:57.020> keep<00:05:57.200> up<00:05:57.410> with<00:05:57.530> me<00:05:57.740> as<00:05:57.920> I<00:05:58.370> change<00:05:58.640> my

00:05:58.840 --> 00:05:58.850 
to keep up with me as I change my

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:08.620 
to keep up with me as I change my
direction<00:05:59.180> and<00:05:59.480> velocity<00:05:59.630> rapidly<00:06:07.630> notice

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:08.630 
direction and velocity rapidly notice

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:10.180 
direction and velocity rapidly notice
how<00:06:08.750> he's<00:06:08.870> always<00:06:09.050> left<00:06:09.290> one<00:06:09.500> step<00:06:09.740> behind

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:10.190 
how he's always left one step behind

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:12.100 
how he's always left one step behind
well<00:06:10.970> this<00:06:11.120> technique<00:06:11.540> is<00:06:11.660> certainly<00:06:11.960> the

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:12.110 
well this technique is certainly the

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:14.140 
well this technique is certainly the

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:14.150 
hardest one the lifts used properly but

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:15.550 
hardest one the lifts used properly but

a means of getting around the map you'll
find<00:06:19.940> yourself<00:06:20.270> dying<00:06:20.480> a<00:06:20.660> lot<00:06:20.810> less<00:06:21.020> often<00:06:21.440> and
