00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 hi everyone today I you 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:10.230
 found to talk about walnut oil 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:14.759
 coconut I really wanted you 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:17.279
 talk about this product or that I had 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.590
 very want to introduce you this product 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.449
 so what is not the vegetable oil of 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.640
 coconut is a product that really 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.930
 full full of use and 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.300
 it's true that people of faith are a 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.269
 little lost and I was already asked how 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.289
 I used it and so it's me 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.510
 I said I was going to introduce you 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.969
 these are the ways I have to use it 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.980
 of course she has plenty of others I serve 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.850
 to brandish some of you give 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.680
 some examples 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.629
 but here in this video games 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.340
 mainly tell you about how - 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.780
 game use it and I hope it 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.300
 may well help you so already for 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.280
 talk about the oil itself so me 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.100
 I bought it on the site as roma zone 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.770
 it's a big big cans of 20 liters 1 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:59.039
 I believe 1 liter of yeah 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.570
 I paid 25 th I think you came 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.879
 to something like that here on a 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.790
 Romagnol I put you the link to Lambare 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.640
 info then started at the level of 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.950
 its uses so first of all the 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.700
 hair so I use it in bath 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:17.130
 oil on my hair one to two times 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.930
 per week and then there are two kinds 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.509
 oil bath that I can do either 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.369
 I see there I put on my long 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.750
 hours she is mainly not 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.390
 too much to the roots anyway 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.280
 here are the lengths and spikes and I 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.720
 do this at night before doing my 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.610
 shampoo or day for example a 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.640
 Sunday I leave several 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.930
 hours as much as possible and 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.509
 then I wash my hair 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.060
 this is very very effective 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.680
 makes hair soft and shiny or 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.079
 to do something more 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.270
 intensive you can do that's the same 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.070
 thing put oil on your 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.060
 lengths and tips and let it pose 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.170
 All night long 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.299
 this is really going to be me meals 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.580
 your hair in depth is the 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:58.840
 very damaged hair so it's some 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.159
 thing that unfortunately I have not too much 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.409
 time to do because I wash 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:04.630
 not really let go in the morning otherwise 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:06.100
 I will not have time but I can 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.210
 so recommend to you that maybe not 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.130
 do it every time because it's a 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.399
 little longer but to do once a 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.800
 month 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.840
 here I recommend it then 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.150
 second use I make of 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.470
 this oil is the make-up removal 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.260
 so that was really a 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.120
 revelation I discovered this way 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.090
 to remove makeup about a year ago 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.010
 it was last summer and since then I 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.340
 no longer uses any other makeup remover 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:32.080
 it's really the revolution I 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.690
 understand and have some who do not like 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.519
 the oil aspect for example those that 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.170
 have oily skin may not like 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:40.000
 but I have dry skin and 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:45.280
 frankly I love this way of being 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:48.069
 removing make-up removes any sense of air 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.660
 any kind of waterproof makeup have it 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:52.569
 got everything you want 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:55.510
 frankly there is nothing more to say 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:03:00.220
 it's sweet and it's natural 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:03.160
 bio frankly that's positive I 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.810
 so find it to use it as a 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.090
 cleanser I do not pick up there 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:11.340
 in it I just put a little 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:16.410
 little of the solution in a skin bath 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.410
 like that the Berckois 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:31.900
 so I finished a burn the body shop which 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.530
 has a container like that I clean it 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.420
 etc. 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.430
 and here I have seen a little of the solution 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.200
 in and I post him in the room 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.430
 bath is very good that way so I 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.750
 just come take a small 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.280
 little with the tips of my fingers and 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.200
 children 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.190
 shown little it's been a year that I use 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.200
 every day a makeup remover and 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.209
 watch what and again I too 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.590
 a bath of oil so frankly it's 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:51.720
 more than profitable it costs 20 euros to 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.780
 the purchase but it means more than a year 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.770
 so it's more than profitable 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:58.350
 So here I put it in my little 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:59.940
 container I come a little too little but 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.780
 others in and after tackle jean lifts 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.980
 all the makeup 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.959
 after of course you have full 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.819
 flowing makeup and where so want 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:09.000
 him with micellar water or what 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:13.260
 you want and that's great for the 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.300
 already shown in live finally how I 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.829
 used it live in my routines from 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:19.380
 evening i will put the place in hamburg 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:21.000
 tax if you want and so that's it 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.410
 the two uses that I just 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.230
 present you these two main 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:27.060
 that I do with 7.8 oil baths 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:28.200
 and make-up removal is really 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.570
 why I use the most 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.700
 then there are other uses to 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:34.410
 do with this oil which a very 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.940
 interesting that is the scrubs of 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.070
 home it's true that the scrubs 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:40.200
 often it's expensive and with your white 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:41.550
 a coconut oil can be done by 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.950
 example to make a terrible for 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:46.800
 the lips we can help ourselves with the oil of 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:50.160
 coconut to do it by putting in a 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:53.790
 small container of sugar and a spoon 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:55.919
 of coconut oil and that's the pouring in 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:58.890
 effect must send it really and 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:05:01.620
 super simple and we can also 

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:03.840
 serve to make a scrub for the 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.250
 body so a little more abrasive if you 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.810
 finally want unless you have skin 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:08.640
 sensitive but if you want a gommard 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:10.350
 I'm still pretty abrasive and in 

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:13.680
 same time moisturizing a bit anyway 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:15.840
 those at the body shop who are and 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:18.090
 soil a moisturizer but that is expensive 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.410
 so there you can do it home in 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.780
 putting one more time in a 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:23.370
 container of coconut milk and instead 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:25.680
 sugar you put for example some 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:26.880
 salt that will be much stronger for a 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.800
 body scrub 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:30.030
 so here again you finally 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.620
 see you can largely make 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:33.479
 homemade scrubs that will count a lot 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.930
 cheaper than what you can buy in 

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:36.419
 store 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:37.920
 after that can also serve as an izard 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:41.250
 wait for example 

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:42.960
 moisturizing lip balm if you have 

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:45.930
 a sunburn in the summer if you are 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.290
 inherited it can serve really well 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:48.210
 things 

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:50.130
 after obviously it can be used 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:51.930
 in the kitchen but that's really not 

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:54.600
 something that I do and I also 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:56.870
 heard that we could use for by 

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:59.700
 example whitening yielding for example some 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:01.770
 care I do not know what 

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:02.910
 but here I heard that after me 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:04.950
 I never did I do not know if that 

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:07.500
 walking but there is plenty of use a 

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:08.940
 other noise still coconut oil 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:11.000
 no frankly it's a product that I 

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:14.070
 can only honestly recommend 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:17.010
 it is bio and or end here I do not see 

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:18.420
 not why it would not be recommended 

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:20.370
 did a year ago that I helped them that I 

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:20.820
 over it's for sure sure I'm going to 

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:23.250
 purchased 

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:24.810
 I hope this video has helped you 

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:26.280
 if you have further questions about 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:28.830
 coconut oil 

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:31.530
 do not hesitate to ask me all this in 

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:34.970
 comment and here I am telling you to the 

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:34.970
 next video chat hours 

00:06:42.459 --> 00:06:45.459
 a
