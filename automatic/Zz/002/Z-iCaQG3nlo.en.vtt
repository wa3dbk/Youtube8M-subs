 God what nice it will be to fish.

 It's dangerous but smart. - Do not blow smoke in my face! 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.879
 Nää, but I might be kicking you a little bit then. 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.670
 Maybe I'm gonna have some fun on you then. - You and your cigarettes!

00:00:54.793 --> 00:00:58.745
 No one decides on me either! - No, I'm leaving you here. 

00:00:58.746 --> 00:01:03.037

 Here is the auction, I drop you off. - I've sharpened myself now. 

00:01:06.523 --> 00:01:08.223
 Okay, you have tightened yourself now, then we go again. 

00:01:09.024 --> 00:01:11.925
 Oh, oh oh, Uncle! - Check this out! 

00:01:11.926 --> 00:01:16.444
 So, then, Uncle. - Do you think you own the street or? 

00:01:16.445 --> 00:01:19.418
 He believed he owned the street. - He thought he owned the street. 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.758
 Ho, eh, hear my mother. Hörredu. 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:39.546

 Your mother? - Yes! 

00:01:44.945 --> 00:01:46.481
 It's her with the patties! 

00:01:50.473 --> 00:01:55.135
 Eh, Monica ho has opened a bakery. - So she does? 

00:01:57.478 --> 00:02:01.441
 There she is standing and baking a toast with the tits in the dough, you understand. 

00:02:02.271 --> 00:02:04.117
 She rolls with her breasts, she does. 

00:02:04.118 --> 00:02:05.885
 Yes, it does, you understand! 

00:02:05.886 --> 00:02:08.383

 Do you understand? - Yes I understand that.

 You understand? - Do not blow smoke in the face while driving! 

00:02:20.582 --> 00:02:23.118
 I try not to! 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.933
 But sometimes it becomes as it gets. 

00:02:25.934 --> 00:02:27.647
 I usually say that, trying to do it. 

00:02:29.084 --> 00:02:31.315
 Yes sometimes it will work, sometimes it will not work. 

00:02:31.316 --> 00:02:32.316
 Now, sometimes it is not good. 

00:02:32.317 --> 00:02:34.517
 Now, sometimes it is not good! - Sometimes it doesn't work well. 

00:02:34.518 --> 00:02:35.933
 Sometimes it is NOT good ... 

00:02:35.934 --> 00:02:39.544
 God what happy I know. - GU was happy you are! Lucky you! 

00:02:41.965 --> 00:02:44.716
 Now we are going to go fishing ... In Tisaren! 

00:02:45.768 --> 00:02:48.595
 Sharpen you now, otherwise there will be no fish! 

00:02:51.506 --> 00:02:54.331
 It's the last time we take you, you understand. 

00:02:55.425 --> 00:02:57.846
 We at the daycare center are getting pretty tired of you. 

00:03:05.842 --> 00:03:08.153
 Gu, what a great weather this is Stefan. 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.392
 Gu, what lovely you are Stefan! 

00:03:14.152 --> 00:03:17.243
 Just calm down! Rest on! - Aj aj Captain! 

00:03:19.706 --> 00:03:23.984
 Now, the caterpillar is over! Here we stay! - Aj aj Captain! 

00:03:25.597 --> 00:03:28.243
 And then we release anchor ... Are we releasing anchor here? 

00:03:28.244 --> 00:03:29.695
 Put away the knife Stefan. 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.869
 Get rid of that! 

00:03:49.369 --> 00:03:51.523
 Don't you think it's for your own sake ?! 

00:03:57.104 --> 00:03:58.913
 What good you are! - Thanks so much. 

00:04:04.768 --> 00:04:06.905
 Gu who messed up Stefan. 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.523
 Now we do as a banana split, and split! 

00:04:28.817 --> 00:04:30.847
 Hey then, for this time! 

00:04:30.848 --> 00:04:33.358
 Maybe we'll see next time? 

00:04:41.807 --> 00:04:44.067
 Then wave it! - Bye!
