 you will start the program if you start 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.090
 program there 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.730
 although it is an unknown program, it is 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.590
 a very good program 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:15.510
 after it starts the first thing that 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.710
 you must do is come here in 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:26.970
 settings and came here in the 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:31.470
 put Portuguese point in yen and is not 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:34.409
 a Portuguese of Brazil is a Portuguese 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.490
 portugal is more you will understand with 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.490
 more easily 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.290
 this is the initial program hit 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.570
 page that had started the 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.690
 program and has three options for you 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:51.479
 to scan your computer 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.229
 the first one to scan where to make a 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:57.060
 sweep 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:02:00.630
 only in the memory of your computer is the 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.299
 second option is smart scan where 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.260
 make a deeper scan is in 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:08.459
 all computer files share 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:11.069
 will do 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.709
 the defender completes this program which is 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.790
 very complete very good you use it 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:17.519
 it's full 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:21.239
 The full quarterback is looking for the 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:23.370
 virus where it is and excludes you 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:25.620
 the third option africa application 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:29.129
 custom verification 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:31.439
 here you will be able to choose the folder that 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:33.150
 You'll want to do the scanning. 

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:37.980
 scan 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:41.220
 I recommend it as you are to always use the 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:44.159
 option here of the smart scan medium that neither 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.700
 made a more complete scan on the 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:48.840
 your computer 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:53.689
 Let's scan people here. 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:59.430
 to see if it is against a virus on the 

00:02:53.689 --> 00:03:02.549
 smart scan here first it will start 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.769
 here in the system memory and will make the 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:07.200
 scan on all system-wide 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:11.220
 as I said earlier 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:13.549
 and here the second option files goes 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:17.400
 scan all files on your computer 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:20.609
 and system folders and the third option 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:23.370
 will examine here and in all 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:25.769
 throughout the registration system of the 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:29.400
 document to pain everyone there is a system 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:33.989
 operating for those who have a computer 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:36.269
 Light then he has recalls uai take in 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:41.010
 band and so the vintes to 1 run some ago 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:43.620
 40 minutes for anyone who has a computer 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.900
 with a better performance is very fast to 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:49.379
 to scan in the case of my 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:53.849
 computer that's a little bit is setup 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:56.040
 download right and doing the video 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:59.310
 video recording it will take 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.959
 It's more time so I'm going to pause here. 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.840
 on the video and as soon as 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:09.900
 Full scan, I'll come back to show you 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:11.909
 is the final part about the problem comes 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:15.389
 here having to scan our 

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:18.329
 computer is lasted 55 minutes and 23 

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:20.009
 seconds right 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:22.620
 took a long time to make the 

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:26.000
 scan to see our computer does not 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:29.490
 have a good configuration and 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:33.330
 After you finish here, you come here in the 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:34.980
 page and will check that it is 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.390
 has any threat to be found in our 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:40.140
 if you did not find any threats here 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:42.360
 No threats found at 0 

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:44.520
 if in case your computer finds 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.840
 some threat to leave or some file 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.420
 suspect 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.700
 you come here in quarantine which is now 

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:53.550
 to be here in the quarantine after you come 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:54.360
 here see and recent checks and 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:57.120
 be here 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:05:00.030
 the last scan you made and the 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:06.300
 remove the virus there you just click 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:08.790
 here in sweeping and nobody here he sweeps 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:12.090
 will do the cleaning and viruses that 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:15.980
 you are inside the galley is a 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:18.120
 the observation there is that you 

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:21.270
 use this program you need 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:23.730
 also a virus saw it is do not use 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:26.640
 antivirus programs you have to use the 

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:27.750
 doj this program and the antivirus you 

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:32.280
 using two 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:34.890
 you're going to keep your computer by 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:37.290
 much longer without virus goes 

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:40.620
 to make it difficult for your computer to 

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:41.760
