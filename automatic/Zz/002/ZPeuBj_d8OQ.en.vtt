drive<00:01:54.180> anyway<00:01:54.659> again<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:55.500> so<00:01:56.399> here's<00:01:56.790> a

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
drive anyway again and so here's a

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:57.670 
drive anyway again and so here's a
chance<00:01:57.119> for

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 
chance for

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.820
