00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
triceps before you train chest I would

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.290 
triceps before you train chest I would
say<00:00:42.780> yes<00:00:43.020> because<00:00:43.950> I<00:00:44.399> don't<00:00:44.760> want<00:00:44.910> to<00:00:45.000> tire<00:00:45.270> out

say yes because I don't want to tire out
my<00:00:45.780> triceps<00:00:46.469> because<00:00:47.399> that's<00:00:47.670> going<00:00:47.820> to

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
my triceps because that's going to

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.930 
my triceps because that's going to
affect<00:00:48.180> my<00:00:48.420> ability<00:00:48.539> to<00:00:49.230> bench<00:00:49.710> press

especially<00:00:50.940> when<00:00:51.480> I'm<00:00:51.570> lifting<00:00:51.750> weight<00:00:52.050> above

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
especially when I'm lifting weight above

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.069 
especially when I'm lifting weight above
my<00:00:52.710> head<00:00:52.739> and<00:00:53.160> especially<00:00:54.149> when<00:00:54.510> guys<00:00:54.690> want<00:00:54.989> to

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
my head and especially when guys want to

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.279 
my head and especially when guys want to
handle<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.770> maximum<00:00:56.460> amount<00:00:56.579> of<00:00:56.789> weight<00:00:57.000> for

00:00:57.279 --> 00:00:57.289 
handle the maximum amount of weight for

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:01.250 
handle the maximum amount of weight for
chest<00:00:58.289> so<00:00:59.010> I<00:00:59.039> would<00:00:59.460> train<00:00:59.670> chest<00:01:00.120> then<00:01:00.899> train

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
chest so I would train chest then train

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.979 
chest so I would train chest then train
triceps<00:01:01.859> with<00:01:02.640> regards<00:01:03.059> to<00:01:03.120> triceps<00:01:03.840> and

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
triceps with regards to triceps and

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.570 
triceps with regards to triceps and
biceps<00:01:04.049> you<00:01:04.559> train<00:01:04.860> those<00:01:05.010> in<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.189> same<00:01:05.400> day

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
biceps you train those in the same day

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.490 
biceps you train those in the same day
doesn't<00:01:06.540> really<00:01:06.659> make<00:01:06.780> much<00:01:06.840> of<00:01:07.020> a<00:01:07.170> difference

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
doesn't really make much of a difference

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.039 
doesn't really make much of a difference
if<00:01:07.680> I<00:01:08.430> did<00:01:08.610> back<00:01:08.850> in<00:01:08.880> biceps<00:01:09.570> would<00:01:09.810> that<00:01:09.930> make

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
if I did back in biceps would that make

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.410 
if I did back in biceps would that make
a<00:01:10.110> difference<00:01:10.200> I<00:01:10.710> would<00:01:11.040> say<00:01:11.220> yes<00:01:11.490> I<00:01:11.850> would

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
a difference I would say yes I would

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.510 
a difference I would say yes I would
train<00:01:12.689> back<00:01:13.080> first<00:01:13.470> because<00:01:13.860> again<00:01:14.280> it's<00:01:14.430> a

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
train back first because again it's a

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.490 
train back first because again it's a
bigger<00:01:14.790> muscle<00:01:15.240> like<00:01:15.479> chest<00:01:15.840> is<00:01:16.020> compared<00:01:16.439> to

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
bigger muscle like chest is compared to

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.740 
bigger muscle like chest is compared to
triceps<00:01:17.040> I<00:01:17.280> would<00:01:17.700> train<00:01:17.909> back<00:01:18.150> first<00:01:18.540> and

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
triceps I would train back first and

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.039 
triceps I would train back first and
then<00:01:19.380> I<00:01:19.409> would<00:01:19.799> hit<00:01:19.920> biceps<00:01:20.460> hit<00:01:21.240> biceps<00:01:21.750> first

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
then I would hit biceps hit biceps first

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.149 
then I would hit biceps hit biceps first
you're<00:01:22.380> not<00:01:22.409> going<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:22.740> have<00:01:22.860> as<00:01:23.009> much

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
you're not going to have as much

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.670 
you're not going to have as much
strength<00:01:23.610> because<00:01:24.000> that<00:01:24.570> muscle<00:01:25.140> smaller

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
strength because that muscle smaller

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.020 
strength because that muscle smaller
it's<00:01:25.920> going<00:01:26.070> to<00:01:26.130> give<00:01:26.280> out<00:01:26.430> before<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.880> back

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
it's going to give out before the back

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.990 
it's going to give out before the back
gets<00:01:27.299> tired<00:01:27.979> with<00:01:28.979> regards<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.490> let's<00:01:29.850> say

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
gets tired with regards to let's say

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.960 
gets tired with regards to let's say
training<00:01:30.420> shoulders<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.470> biceps<00:01:32.310> together

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
training shoulders and biceps together

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.730 
training shoulders and biceps together
you<00:01:33.420> might<00:01:33.540> say<00:01:33.780> well<00:01:33.810> those<00:01:34.110> those<00:01:34.470> two

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
you might say well those those two

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.039 
you might say well those those two
aren't<00:01:34.950> really<00:01:35.250> related<00:01:35.509> but<00:01:36.509> take<00:01:36.750> it<00:01:36.840> from<00:01:36.869> a

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
aren't really related but take it from a

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.710 
aren't really related but take it from a
guy<00:01:37.079> who's<00:01:37.619> been<00:01:37.920> around<00:01:38.040> if<00:01:38.520> you<00:01:39.299> train

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
guy who's been around if you train

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.249 
guy who's been around if you train
shoulders<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:40.829> then<00:01:41.610> train<00:01:42.030> biceps<00:01:42.720> your

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
shoulders and then train biceps your

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.590 
shoulders and then train biceps your
biceps<00:01:43.710> won't<00:01:43.920> be<00:01:44.070> as<00:01:44.159> strong<00:01:44.490> here's<00:01:45.299> why

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
biceps won't be as strong here's why

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.139 
biceps won't be as strong here's why
because<00:01:45.930> typically<00:01:46.770> when<00:01:46.979> you<00:01:47.070> do<00:01:47.250> a<00:01:47.280> curl<00:01:47.759> a

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
because typically when you do a curl a

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.030 
because typically when you do a curl a
lot<00:01:48.570> of<00:01:48.689> that<00:01:48.840> weight<00:01:49.049> is<00:01:49.259> supported<00:01:49.560> by<00:01:49.920> your

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
lot of that weight is supported by your

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.609 
lot of that weight is supported by your
shoulders<00:01:50.430> when<00:01:51.240> you<00:01:51.360> do<00:01:51.780> a<00:01:51.810> one-arm<00:01:52.350> dumbbell

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
shoulders when you do a one-arm dumbbell

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.209 
shoulders when you do a one-arm dumbbell
curl<00:01:53.250> again<00:01:54.119> that<00:01:54.899> weight<00:01:55.320> is<00:01:55.590> supported<00:01:55.860> by

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
curl again that weight is supported by

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.609 
curl again that weight is supported by
the<00:01:56.369> shoulders<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.119> bicep<00:01:57.810> is<00:01:57.990> curling<00:01:58.469> it

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
the shoulders the bicep is curling it

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.010 
the shoulders the bicep is curling it
but<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.369> shoulder<00:01:59.909> is<00:02:00.060> supporting<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:00.810> whole

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
but the shoulder is supporting the whole

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.050 
but the shoulder is supporting the whole
arm<00:02:01.290> and<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.890> weight<00:02:02.070> you<00:02:02.219> have<00:02:02.250> in<00:02:02.549> your<00:02:02.670> hand

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
arm and the weight you have in your hand

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.260 
arm and the weight you have in your hand
so<00:02:03.750> if<00:02:03.840> you<00:02:03.930> group<00:02:04.369> biceps<00:02:05.369> and<00:02:05.579> shoulders

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
so if you group biceps and shoulders

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.520 
so if you group biceps and shoulders
together<00:02:07.079> you<00:02:07.649> train<00:02:08.179> biceps<00:02:09.179> first<00:02:09.599> and<00:02:10.020> then

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
together you train biceps first and then

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.640 
together you train biceps first and then
you<00:02:10.619> train<00:02:10.860> shoulders<00:02:11.340> second<00:02:11.870> let's<00:02:12.870> see

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
you train shoulders second let's see

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.399 
you train shoulders second let's see
quads<00:02:13.799> hamstrings<00:02:14.640> I<00:02:15.599> would<00:02:15.959> always<00:02:16.200> train

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:16.409 
quads hamstrings I would always train

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:18.170 
quads hamstrings I would always train
quads<00:02:16.739> first<00:02:17.129> because<00:02:17.549> believe<00:02:17.879> it<00:02:17.909> or<00:02:18.060> not

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
quads first because believe it or not

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.869 
quads first because believe it or not
the<00:02:18.659> hamstrings<00:02:19.409> if<00:02:19.680> you<00:02:20.069> tire<00:02:20.340> those<00:02:20.640> out

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:20.879 
the hamstrings if you tire those out

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:22.220 
the hamstrings if you tire those out
they're<00:02:21.420> not<00:02:21.450> going<00:02:21.659> to<00:02:21.720> be<00:02:21.810> able<00:02:21.840> to<00:02:22.049> support

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
they're not going to be able to support

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.020 
they're not going to be able to support
you<00:02:22.620> on<00:02:22.829> squats<00:02:23.519> or<00:02:23.760> leg<00:02:24.180> press<00:02:24.510> so<00:02:25.110> I<00:02:25.409> like

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
you on squats or leg press so I like

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.399 
you on squats or leg press so I like
squatting<00:02:27.030> or<00:02:27.209> leg<00:02:27.390> pressing<00:02:27.750> first<00:02:27.959> and<00:02:28.170> then

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:28.409 
squatting or leg pressing first and then

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:30.830 
squatting or leg pressing first and then
training<00:02:28.739> hamstrings<00:02:29.489> let<00:02:30.299> me<00:02:30.420> think<00:02:30.599> what

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
training hamstrings let me think what

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.130 
training hamstrings let me think what
other<00:02:31.099> combinations<00:02:32.099> chest<00:02:32.549> back<00:02:33.140> chest

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140

first back second chest back biceps

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.399 
first back second chest back biceps
triceps<00:02:38.329> again<00:02:39.329> always<00:02:39.599> think<00:02:39.930> in<00:02:40.019> terms<00:02:40.170> of

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:40.409 
triceps again always think in terms of

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:42.319 
triceps again always think in terms of
training<00:02:40.709> the<00:02:41.129> bigger<00:02:41.370> muscle<00:02:41.790> groups<00:02:42.000> first

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:42.329 
training the bigger muscle groups first

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:44.690 
training the bigger muscle groups first
that's<00:02:42.900> primarily<00:02:43.260> the<00:02:44.069> most<00:02:44.250> important

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
that's primarily the most important

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.089 
that's primarily the most important
thing<00:02:44.909> but<00:02:45.480> again<00:02:45.810> if<00:02:46.200> you're<00:02:46.920> getting

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:47.099 
thing but again if you're getting

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:49.250 
thing but again if you're getting
results<00:02:47.579> you<00:02:47.700> want<00:02:47.970> that's<00:02:48.540> all<00:02:48.780> that<00:02:48.930> matters

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
results you want that's all that matters
