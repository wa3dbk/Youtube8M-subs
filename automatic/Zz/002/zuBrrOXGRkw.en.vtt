I haven't seen any unboxings at all
well<00:00:44.940> here<00:00:45.030> we<00:00:45.090> go<00:00:45.680> got<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:48.230> instruction

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
well here we go got the instruction

00:00:49.230 --> 00:01:06.969 
well here we go got the instruction
books<00:00:50.420> tell<00:00:51.420> you<00:00:51.480> how<00:00:51.539> to<00:00:51.629> set<00:00:51.780> everything<00:00:51.899> up

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:11.660 

here's<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.130> overflow<00:01:08.580> box<00:01:09.229> which<00:01:10.229> I<00:01:10.740> really

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
here's the overflow box which I really

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.640 
here's the overflow box which I really
like<00:01:11.880> this<00:01:12.060> overflow<00:01:12.450> box<00:01:12.720> will<00:01:13.229> obviously

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
like this overflow box will obviously

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.020 
like this overflow box will obviously
show<00:01:13.950> you<00:01:14.040> that<00:01:14.189> all<00:01:14.310> my<00:01:14.340> tanking<00:01:14.790> a<00:01:14.850> little

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
show you that all my tanking a little

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:27.770 
show you that all my tanking a little
bit<00:01:20.270> pump<00:01:21.860> obviously<00:01:26.090> another<00:01:27.090> pump<00:01:27.420> probably

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
bit pump obviously another pump probably

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.240 
bit pump obviously another pump probably
for<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.020> protein<00:01:28.350> skimmer<00:01:28.500> one's<00:01:28.920> gonna<00:01:29.070> be

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
for the protein skimmer one's gonna be

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.789 
for the protein skimmer one's gonna be
the<00:01:29.340> return

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:30.799 
the return

00:01:30.799 --> 00:02:25.210 
the return
let's<00:01:31.670> get<00:01:31.820> this<00:01:32.060> out<00:01:32.299> of<00:01:32.359> there<00:02:23.950> minimum<00:02:24.950> max

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
let's get this out of there minimum max

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.059 
let's get this out of there minimum max
water<00:02:25.519> level<00:02:26.380> obviously<00:02:27.380> where<00:02:27.650> the<00:02:27.739> protein

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
water level obviously where the protein

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:29.530 
water level obviously where the protein
skimmer<00:02:28.310> is<00:02:28.519> gonna<00:02:28.849> be<00:02:29.000> probably<00:02:29.209> return

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
skimmer is gonna be probably return

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:37.750 
skimmer is gonna be probably return
intake<00:02:30.849> it's<00:02:31.849> open<00:02:32.150> her<00:02:32.209> up<00:02:34.569> okay<00:02:36.579> so<00:02:37.579> the

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
intake it's open her up okay so the

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.280 
intake it's open her up okay so the
water<00:02:37.940> is<00:02:38.060> going<00:02:38.090> to<00:02:38.209> be<00:02:38.359> spilling<00:02:38.810> into<00:02:38.930> here

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
water is going to be spilling into here

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:44.949 
water is going to be spilling into here
go<00:02:39.560> down<00:02:40.600> you<00:02:41.600> know<00:02:41.630> correctly<00:02:43.299> one<00:02:44.299> pad<00:02:44.540> to

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
go down you know correctly one pad to

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:47.500 
go down you know correctly one pad to
pad<00:02:45.230> three<00:02:45.739> pads<00:02:46.010> carbon<00:02:46.850> pillow<00:02:47.060> pad<00:02:47.329> right

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
pad three pads carbon pillow pad right

pad three pads carbon pillow pad right
there<00:02:49.299> the<00:02:50.299> bottle<00:02:50.569> boss<00:02:50.720> a<00:02:52.329> lot<00:02:53.329> of<00:02:53.450> people

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
there the bottle boss a lot of people

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.960 
there the bottle boss a lot of people
don't<00:02:53.780> like<00:02:53.900> bioballs<00:02:54.350> I<00:02:54.639> this<00:02:55.639> will<00:02:55.760> be<00:02:55.850> my

this is gonna be carbon and ceramic this

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.650 
this is gonna be carbon and ceramic this
perfect<00:03:27.660> and<00:03:28.050> then<00:03:29.060> we've<00:03:30.060> had<00:03:30.180> to<00:03:30.330> see<00:03:30.480> I<00:03:30.510> now

your sister your pumps and whatnot so
the<00:03:36.540> bottom<00:03:36.930> we<00:03:37.440> got<00:03:37.650> those<00:03:37.890> ceramic<00:03:38.760> rings

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:39.770 
the bottom we got those ceramic rings

00:03:39.770 --> 00:04:22.940 
the bottom we got those ceramic rings
karbonpad<00:04:06.110> nobody<00:04:07.110> saw<00:04:07.290> that<00:04:20.600> okay<00:04:21.680> let's<00:04:22.680> go

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
karbonpad nobody saw that okay let's go

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.070 
karbonpad nobody saw that okay let's go
see<00:04:23.280> there's<00:04:23.729> pretty<00:04:24.270> much<00:04:24.360> not<00:04:24.690> really<00:04:24.810> too

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
see there's pretty much not really too

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.350 
see there's pretty much not really too
much<00:04:25.200> to<00:04:25.260> this<00:04:25.620> auto<00:04:26.370> top<00:04:26.669> off<00:04:26.820> system<00:04:27.030> but

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
much to this auto top off system but

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.600 
much to this auto top off system but
we'll<00:04:27.510> go<00:04:27.660> there<00:04:27.870> anyways<00:04:28.200> just<00:04:29.900> okay<00:04:30.900> so

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
we'll go there anyways just okay so

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:34.250 
we'll go there anyways just okay so
obviously<00:04:32.610> this<00:04:32.850> is<00:04:33.030> a<00:04:33.060> auto<00:04:33.450> top<00:04:33.720> off<00:04:33.870> system

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.260 
obviously this is a auto top off system

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.140 
obviously this is a auto top off system
