effects<00:02:07.440> are<00:02:07.680> late<00:02:07.920> in<00:02:08.070> the<00:02:08.190> game<00:02:08.340> where<00:02:08.820> you

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
effects are late in the game where you

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.820 
effects are late in the game where you
get<00:02:09.149> down<00:02:09.360> towards<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:09.780> hell<00:02:10.020> areas<00:02:10.500> and<00:02:10.649> get

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
get down towards the hell areas and get

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.590 
get down towards the hell areas and get
them<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.130> stuff<00:02:11.310> it<00:02:11.460> looks<00:02:11.670> really<00:02:12.300> really
