00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.400
 hello you ever wondered to 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.870
 Where will your life where you are 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.179
 today it has a lot to do with your 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.390
 thoughts with your habits with your 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:18.950
 beliefs of the past and the question is 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:21.380
 you are satisfied with the address that 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:23.180
 follow your life sure there are aspects of 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.220
 your life that you would like to change or 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.410
 improve that is the reason why 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.510
 make your own decisions though 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.430
 Sometimes things do not happen like 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.710
 you expected there are elements that you 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.410
 condition and that you stop fears 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.540
 the limiting beliefs the doubts 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.460
 how many times fear has not 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.360
 allowed to do what really 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.879
 I wanted 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.040
 it has all happened to us once and 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:48.440
 what is the secret of the winners their 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.930
 secret is to face the things that 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.399
 they are scary and thus get overcoming 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.170
 themselves 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:56.329
 if you want to achieve something you've never done 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.640
 I have been able to get to start 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:00.829
 think about becoming the kind of 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.739
 person who has not been until now but 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:06.220
 that you can become we all have a 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:08.080
 great potential to progress 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.690
 so if what you want is to give that 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.420
 I turn to your life what would be the first 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.700
 which you should do the first step 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.320
 is to discover why you want to change what 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.840
 is what you want because you are going to take 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.840
 this decision what you want to achieve is what 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:25.210
 what we call dreams are our 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.430
 why of life the fuel of 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.410
 our engine what stimulates us and what 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.080
 that generates the necessary illusion for us 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:34.000
 fight for what we want for that 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.800
 you have to always keep it in mind 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.810
 every day define them and visualize them 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.210
 clearly to prevent our 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.250
 fears make us forget our dreams 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.740
 because if we forget our dreams and 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.930
 illusions we run out of fuel and 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.940
 we stop when we know what 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.850
 we want and we focus on it 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.650
 that vision generates the necessary force and 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.080
 the motivation to keep moving 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:58.600
 always the second step is to take a 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:01.119
 decision and a firm commitment there is 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.490
 people who sometimes do not react until 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:05.860
 that fall into a deep well and it is in that 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.320
 moment when they get to see clearly 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.209
 the output that fact becomes the 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.830
 transformation platform of your life 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:13.330
 what is the factor that marks 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.700
 life of a person to make that overturn 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.530
 radical in its existence that factor is 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.120
 your decision power 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.800
 the difference between those who 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.410
 They let themselves be carried away by the environment and those who 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.000
 they make conscious decisions and how 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.680
 do you take to be happy and have 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.420
 that energy asked someone 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:33.100
 decisions I make decisions and that's how 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.800
 quality of the decisions you make today 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.270
 will determine the quality of your future but 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.860
 what decisions are you have to make 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:41.560
 take to go where you want 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.990
 surely those decisions that 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.720
 you are avoiding what happens is that if not 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:48.760
 you make those decisions life will take them 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.700
 for you and probably will not be the ones 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:55.240
 you need you are free to choose 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:57.160
 make decisions and dare to change the 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.660
 family the education that you received the 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.030
 environment in which you grew the 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.160
 relationships friends work all 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.110
 these things have built your past the 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.390
 perception that you have of yourself and have 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.910
 generated a series of beliefs that are 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.350
 the filter through which you observe 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.940
 interpret the world 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.040
 these elements condition you until 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.230
 a certain point but you are not a prisoner of 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.300
 past your past 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.159
 to your future but the decisions that 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.440
 you take each day now at this moment in 

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:25.150
 the present thus is that the past would be 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.190
 like that wake that leaves in its wake a 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.440
 plane in the sky but that does not control 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.720
 he does not direct his course but he is the pilot 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.890
 who decides where he is going in 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.830
 every moment 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:39.540
 you are that pilot you with your decisions 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.540
 you can change the direction of your life 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:44.050
 is satisfied at this time with the 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.150
 kind of person that you are you would like 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:47.950
 progress independently of your 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.840
 answer we spend our lives changing 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.460
 whether we like it or not, we sometimes like the 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.260
 change is negative and other times it is 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:55.420
 positive but the good thing is that always 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.550
 we can improve every time you take a 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.280
 decision and you embark on a new path the 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:02.260
 life puts you to the test that's why you 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.330
 you will always find obstacles that 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.430
 at the beginning they will seem impossible 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:08.080
 impassable with toxic people who 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:11.290
 they are the dream thieves who will tell you 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:13.720
 well this is too difficult better 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:17.170
 try to leave it or not worth it 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:19.060
 well you will not disappoint yourself in that 

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:20.770
 moment more than ever is when you have 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.480
 have to look towards your dreams since the 

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:24.370
 future belongs to those who are 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.930
 dare to chase them even though you must 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.760
 know that you will have to face your 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:30.580
 greatest enemy you will have to prepare 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.500
 for the great battle your greatest challenge is not 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.380
 is waiting out there that great 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:37.480
 enemy is inside you sometimes 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:39.280
 our mind can become that 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.140
 worst enemy when fear invades us 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.420
 and we question our own 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:46.139
 capabilities then its greatest conquest 

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:47.819
 It will be the conquest of yourself 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:49.379
 the environment is another factor to have in 

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:51.240
 account if you do not have clear your 

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:53.370
 convictions perhaps you let the world 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.439
 outside dominate your inner world 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:57.870
 that's why you have to strengthen your muscles 

00:04:55.439 --> 00:05:00.719
 emotional to increase the strength 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:03.389
 mentally and be less influenced by 

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:05.159
 environment and how we can do it to 

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:07.229
 start being more responsible with the 

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:08.909
 information that you choose to see read and 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:10.529
 listen to avoid wallowing 

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:12.150
 unnecessarily in the news 

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:14.909
 negative without implying 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:17.099
 ignore them get away from the complain group 

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:19.379
 permanent and of the group from which it is 

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:21.539
 falling away definitely away from 

00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:23.610
 toxic people and look for what you 

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:26.219
 positively influences what 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:28.289
 what you are taught inspires you, get closer to 

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:30.150
 people with initiatives and illusions and 

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:32.819
 all those qualities that help you 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:34.620
 progress and evolve what happens 

00:05:32.819 --> 00:05:36.900
 So what happens is that your 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:39.270
 thoughts and your emotions start to 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:41.460
 improve your attitude and your 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:43.050
 expectations and increases your creativity and 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:45.360
 your ability to see and generate new 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:48.210
 opportunities and when you start to 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:50.909
 be better everything around you begins 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:52.009
 to be much better increases your strength 

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:54.469
 mental and can 

00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:56.360
 start making things happen your 

00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:58.400
 new future is waiting for you

 have you done or where are you what 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:03.979

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:05.839
 to be and where you can get to

00:06:05.839 --> 00:06:10.279
