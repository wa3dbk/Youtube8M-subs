00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:11.000
 Hello, I want to show you how in the garage 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:15.219
 you can pull a simple damage 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:18.980
 what is required for that well first 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:21.910
 digest such site here these pieces 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:25.610
 iron I took a channel 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:30.910
 the thickness of them is probably six 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:33.469
 at least that's means made in the area 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:36.410
 me here at the base 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:39.469
 this is an exit gate and the base 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:42.170
 made two corners one and the second corner 

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:44.420
 how between them is concrete here are two corners 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.600
 just goes here a little smeared like 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:51.199
 would be plastered here to them a solid seam 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.449
 I suddenly welded from both sides by welding 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:56.210
 failed plus planted on 2 anchors each 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:57.640
 the area, that is, it turns out that with 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.890
 tractive effort 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:04.250
 2 cool just we rests if 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:06.020
 top he rests on this corner if 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.759
 somewhere here in this corner plus I want 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:13.490
 for that corner pulls that is it turns out 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:16.130
 well, as it were, a fracture design is more 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.030
 less stiff getting i pulled there 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.980
 different things to 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.680
 uncomplicated but 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:25.980
 nothing turns me all over 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:29.070
 Excellent here on the second side for sure 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:30.990
 the same ground is the only one 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:35.700
 here I still have the ears made 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:39.060
 the cut was easier to break the chains then 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.250
 removed the case clearly this is approximately 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:46.200
 department on better this balcony fix 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:49.290
 also 2 anchors one anchor from the side 2 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:56.280
 the pad is boiled here and there is boiled 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:59.810
 pad now i'm gonna show tom how 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.810
 pull through just the handle 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:13.490
 to him i am usually a winch director 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:27.270
 to move pulled the case at all 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:31.890
 regulated moved means 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:35.190
 is it possible to substitute here for the workshop 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:37.860
 fame put some stump stand 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:41.640
 any yes then here on this level will be 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.560
 pull you higher no i do 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.700
 stand 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.700
 she clings clip 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:55.420
 all affairs are narrowed down by their child pulled 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:58.519
 2 goal chain there some bar 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.360
 any wooden stump spacer that is not 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:01.879
 will put 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:06.670
 that size at what height you need 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:12.579
 pull something on the series machine you pull out 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:15.500
 new system there are minutes higher 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:17.810
 all the above stand put less 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:23.530
 becomes those my efforts the greater 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:28.389
 starts to crush the floor also for exhaust i 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:31.430
 I use such things and fasteners 

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:37.400
 with them there you can understand the goal 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:40.420
 prophetic there are certain places here 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:43.120
 what is a woman usually use 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:45.530
 in order to pull in two planes 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:50.260
 written by force and i'm not sure what it is 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:53.449
 ford in general d200 door somewhere it stands 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:57.410
 I advise you to get yourself two different 

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:59.989
 clamping the spirit of skysat which pull big 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:02.750
 bite bones and the same is small 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:03.919
 two planes pulls the boom battleship more 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.840
 small teeth 

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:08.060
 the world he is so much like metal 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.859
 more responsible places where somewhere 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:13.069
 report will see there submit zinka so 

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:17.650
 further pull small clamp large 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:20.449
 clamp more here girazon vtom for 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:22.190
 stretcher well, such as would be the more 

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:24.889
 hard work for the rear panels 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.729
 straightening new front panels in 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:27.940
 general advise 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:30.289
 2 to buy even him at least 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:32.800
 a little big one that pulls two 

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:32.800
 planes 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:41.689
 such an ordinary clamp I have 

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:44.639
 It is worth the level of 1200 he skillfully bought 

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:46.669
 two bolts is more for rough 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:50.339
 work so let's say yes 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:53.879
 flanging somewhere grab I think that 

00:04:50.339 --> 00:04:57.029
 such clamps are well suited for clamping 

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:59.549
 on homemade stocks, he sees 

00:04:57.029 --> 00:05:02.009
 two bolts in principle with good 

00:04:59.549 --> 00:05:05.969
 need a platform of course dark with me 

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:07.949
 wider but you see decent tracks you can 

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:11.089
 pick something up weld as 

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:22.649
 for the clamp for the threshold such here still 

00:05:11.089 --> 00:05:26.729
 such a rear panel grip is being sold 

00:05:22.649 --> 00:05:33.659
 pulling cars looked this 

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:37.469
 video Andrei is most likely engaged 

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:40.289
 Seen on the Internet have seen analogs 

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:42.889
 sold already finished here already to them 

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:46.199
 even attached there is a different form boards 

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:48.689
 Depending on where that is necessary to shove I 

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:51.479
 make it easier any bar put here 

00:05:48.689 --> 00:05:53.269
 wooden or very well suited 

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:55.529
 some piece of plywood 

00:05:53.269 --> 00:05:59.599
 centimeter substitute a piece 

00:05:55.529 --> 00:06:04.439
 which we have to pull and we 

00:05:59.599 --> 00:06:08.099
 depending on the height of the traction 

00:06:04.439 --> 00:06:10.079
 this hole we get will be what 

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:12.329
 the higher we pull the more effort 

00:06:10.079 --> 00:06:14.129
 how would he go to the edge of google or 

00:06:12.329 --> 00:06:16.829
 throwing more or less at that level where 

00:06:14.129 --> 00:06:20.669
 we catch the trick will be the effort of a flat floor 

00:06:16.829 --> 00:06:24.269
 up where we pull here and effort tried 

00:06:20.669 --> 00:06:27.539
 pulling great it's all done by me 

00:06:24.269 --> 00:06:31.409
 there are strips cut strip from channel 

00:06:27.539 --> 00:06:33.599
 7 millimeters thick metal 7 

00:06:31.409 --> 00:06:36.689
 millimeters I think that's quite 

00:06:33.599 --> 00:06:37.689
 enough I pulled the worm gear 

00:06:36.689 --> 00:06:39.549
 its which before 

00:06:37.689 --> 00:06:42.039
 showed as if at full capacity 

00:06:39.549 --> 00:06:45.969
 practically pulled nothing with him 

00:06:42.039 --> 00:06:51.279
 going on welding keeps your said 

00:06:45.969 --> 00:06:53.649
 the electrode of the three here means further 

00:06:51.279 --> 00:06:58.499
 I will show there now I put pictures an example 

00:06:53.649 --> 00:06:58.499
 use of this car capture 

00:06:59.129 --> 00:07:06.399
 I will also say it means I welded this 

00:07:02.229 --> 00:07:10.419
 lane only class 45 degrees that is 

00:07:06.399 --> 00:07:14.189
 But from this piece and cut off with a corner 

00:07:10.419 --> 00:07:16.449
 measured out 45 degrees Bulgarian cut off and 

00:07:14.189 --> 00:07:18.179
 welded welfare something like this 

00:07:16.449 --> 00:07:21.939
 and it is clear that forbes 

00:07:18.179 --> 00:07:25.539
 hooks all and berg first example on 

00:07:21.939 --> 00:07:28.479
 level there at the end level of this 

00:07:25.539 --> 00:07:31.959
 pieces there but within five centimeters 

00:07:28.479 --> 00:07:34.379
 where are we doing to normal angle 

00:07:31.959 --> 00:07:34.379
 to pull
