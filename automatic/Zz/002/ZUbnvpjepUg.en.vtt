00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.310 
they're already up seven and nothing and
and<00:00:44.010> we're<00:00:44.670> like<00:00:44.789> four<00:00:45.120> minutes<00:00:45.329> in<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.780> first

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
and we're like four minutes in the first

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.889

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
don't really get anything at all I think

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.279 
don't really get anything at all I think
that<00:00:51.239> might<00:00:51.390> have<00:00:51.449> been<00:00:51.570> a<00:00:51.690> one-yard<00:00:52.199> gain

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
that might have been a one-yard gain

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.889 
that might have been a one-yard gain
boss<00:00:52.860> took<00:00:53.250> him<00:00:53.430> down<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:53.969> then<00:00:54.629> I<00:00:54.660> get

boss took him down and then I get

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.720 
boss took him down and then I get
another<00:00:54.930> touch<00:00:55.620> here<00:00:56.010> I'm<00:00:56.160> trying<00:00:56.399> to<00:00:56.550> get<00:00:56.699> a

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730

request<00:01:08.310> his<00:01:08.520> trade<00:01:08.820> I<00:01:08.850> might<00:01:09.180> stay<00:01:09.479> her<00:01:09.540> for

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
my rookie season though so I hear I'm

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.980 
my rookie season though so I hear I'm
taking<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:12.960> pitch<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.560> I<00:01:14.280> get<00:01:14.700> almost<00:01:15.390> open

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
taking the pitch and I get almost open

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.289 
taking the pitch and I get almost open
field<00:01:16.439> but<00:01:16.830> I<00:01:16.860> break<00:01:17.280> one<00:01:17.520> tackle<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.090> then

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
field but I break one tackle and then

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.170 
field but I break one tackle and then
McHale<00:01:18.900> just<00:01:19.259> takes<00:01:19.530> me<00:01:19.770> down<00:01:19.950> in<00:01:20.310> the

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
McHale just takes me down in the

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.390 
McHale just takes me down in the
backfield<00:01:21.420> therefore<00:01:22.350> I<00:01:22.650> think<00:01:22.979> that<00:01:23.130> was<00:01:23.220> no

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
backfield therefore I think that was no

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.999 
backfield therefore I think that was no
gain<00:01:23.670> actually<00:01:24.409> we're<00:01:25.409> starting<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:25.799> push

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
gain actually we're starting to push

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.740 
gain actually we're starting to push
down<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.280> field<00:01:26.670> after<00:01:27.000> Austin<00:01:27.450> Collie

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
down the field after Austin Collie

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.200 
down the field after Austin Collie
catches<00:01:28.290> that<00:01:28.500> one<00:01:28.710> now<00:01:29.009> we're<00:01:29.189> on<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.520> 19

catches that one now we're on the 19

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.120 
catches that one now we're on the 19
yard<00:01:30.479> line<00:01:30.540> so<00:01:30.659> we're<00:01:31.079> looking<00:01:31.350> to<00:01:31.380> score<00:01:31.799> and

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
preseason that felt pretty good we're

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.090 
preseason that felt pretty good we're
off<00:04:00.330> seven<00:04:00.780> and<00:04:00.930> nothing<00:04:01.290> on<00:04:01.440> the<00:04:01.500> Packers

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
off seven and nothing on the Packers

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.460 
off seven and nothing on the Packers
halfway<00:04:02.790> through<00:04:03.090> the<00:04:03.540> second<00:04:03.989> I<00:04:04.050> get<00:04:04.230> a<00:04:04.260> nice

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
halfway through the second I get a nice

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.830 
halfway through the second I get a nice
little<00:04:04.709> run<00:04:04.980> here<00:04:05.400> but<00:04:05.880> I<00:04:05.940> get<00:04:06.120> took<00:04:06.330> him<00:04:06.540> down

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
little run here but I get took him down

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.990 
little run here but I get took him down
in<00:04:07.200> the<00:04:07.770> midfield<00:04:08.010> there<00:04:08.520> I<00:04:08.550> think<00:04:08.790> that<00:04:08.910> was

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
in the midfield there I think that was

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.640 
in the midfield there I think that was
like<00:04:09.120> only<00:04:09.330> a<00:04:09.510> four<00:04:09.840> yard<00:04:10.080> run<00:04:10.290> I<00:04:10.320> thought<00:04:10.590> I

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
like only a four yard run I thought I

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.820 
like only a four yard run I thought I
had<00:04:10.830> more<00:04:11.040> room<00:04:11.450> but<00:04:12.450> I<00:04:12.690> ended<00:04:13.230> up<00:04:13.380> not<00:04:13.590> and

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:13.830 
had more room but I ended up not and

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:15.380 
had more room but I ended up not and
that's<00:04:13.950> gonna<00:04:14.130> be<00:04:14.310> hard<00:04:14.459> referring<00:04:14.970> to<00:04:15.209> me<00:04:15.360> as

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
that's gonna be hard referring to me as

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.420 
that's gonna be hard referring to me as

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:23.320 
and then I fumble it on top of that so
that's<00:05:20.480> great<00:05:20.840> I<00:05:21.310> fumbled<00:05:22.310> on<00:05:22.400> the<00:05:22.580> one-yard

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:23.330 
that's great I fumbled on the one-yard

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.140 
that's great I fumbled on the one-yard
line<00:05:23.450> that's<00:05:24.380> not<00:05:24.560> doing<00:05:25.070> good<00:05:25.310> for<00:05:25.640> my

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.150 
line that's not doing good for my

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:27.820 
line that's not doing good for my
starting<00:05:26.690> position<00:05:26.870> but<00:05:27.380> I<00:05:27.410> think<00:05:27.620> it's

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:27.830 
starting position but I think it's

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:29.590 
starting position but I think it's
automatic<00:05:28.430> anyway<00:05:28.790> so<00:05:28.850> it<00:05:29.150> really<00:05:29.330> doesn't

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:29.600 
automatic anyway so it really doesn't

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:33.220 
automatic anyway so it really doesn't
matter<00:05:29.750> I<00:05:30.820> think<00:05:31.820> this<00:05:32.030> game<00:05:32.450> I<00:05:32.510> was<00:05:32.870> getting

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:33.230 
matter I think this game I was getting

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:37.870 
matter I think this game I was getting
eat<00:05:34.010> alive<00:05:34.430> in<00:05:34.730> the<00:05:34.850> first<00:05:36.070> quarter<00:05:37.070> and<00:05:37.370> a<00:05:37.640> bit

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:37.880 
eat alive in the first quarter and a bit

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.820 
eat alive in the first quarter and a bit
of<00:05:38.030> the<00:05:38.180> pretty<00:05:38.660> much<00:05:38.840> the<00:05:38.870> first<00:05:39.200> half<00:05:39.560> I

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:39.830 
of the pretty much the first half I

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:41.740 
of the pretty much the first half I
wasn't<00:05:40.130> getting<00:05:40.310> anything<00:05:40.700> and<00:05:41.030> then<00:05:41.600> we

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:41.750 
wasn't getting anything and then we

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:43.510 
wasn't getting anything and then we
started<00:05:42.110> going<00:05:42.380> in<00:05:42.530> third<00:05:42.830> quarter<00:05:43.340> and

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:43.520

and<00:05:46.450> trying<00:05:47.450> to<00:05:47.690> deliver<00:05:48.080> some<00:05:48.470> punch<00:05:48.860> but<00:05:49.280> not

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:49.430 
and trying to deliver some punch but not

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:51.610
