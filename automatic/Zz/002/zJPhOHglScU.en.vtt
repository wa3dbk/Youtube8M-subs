00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.640
 and hugh people here this freak is 

00:00:20.649 --> 00:00:23.470
 today we will find ourselves 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.050
 for a new video on aisne 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:28.119
 tickets touquet fifteen and like you 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.949
 can see it on the screen we're going all 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:32.050
 simply create a new player 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:33.730
 so why create a new kind 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.800
 just this is it going to be a 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.510
 career in parallel with a leader of 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.089
 game because the playmaker post 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.890
 here I really wanted to see her 

00:00:40.089 --> 00:00:44.739
 given that I put systems 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:47.350
 in place and everything I appreciate a lot 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:50.079
 and since it's the only post that's 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:55.079
 able to do that so I hit 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:58.269
 just decided to do it here in 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.710
 parallel career and blow bah there 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:02.469
 this time it will be in dominant hand 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.940
 left and that's the story of changing a 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:06.729
 little bit because I like them 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.079
 shooters left and I like I like 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:10.119
 a little bit and that's how it is 

00:01:08.079 --> 00:01:12.460
 change a little bit right after 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:14.829
 it changes nothing it changes nothing 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.960
 just visual so here we do it at 

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:20.920
 one meter ninety-three up 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:24.040
 So I'm looking for a little bit 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.299
 name that I will give him but we get 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.409
 plug a little bit go on we'll call it 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:28.450
 kempen 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:31.149
 this is a champion guard it is a 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.219
 champion so suddenly that I put that 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:35.920
 like that that too camp length where is 

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:40.240
 the you put it there and that's perfect 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:43.619
 perfect 1995 it's like me and go on 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.619
 left for the new career 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.630
 for mamadou kabylie 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.170
 I'm not trying to make interceptions 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:50.019
 because after the note has really dropped 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:51.609
 or yes to go against aa I stay the 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:53.260
 guys they are not able to do a 

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:56.200
 okay pass so in fact if 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:59.459
 he did not even try that pass and that 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:03.819
 pass the ball yes ouistes racks junior 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:05.609

 frieden here at b + b + b + b + c at the 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.430
 hamois limit so blow 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.450
 logically there if we continue like this 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.780
 It will be alright 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.669
 it's going to be very good hop 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.730
 go ahead defense well tight pink like that 

00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:25.989
 it leaves no chance to jeff teague 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.810
 must leave him no chance must him 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:32.260

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:35.349
 the first style go go kisses and 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:37.599
 it goes up and it goes up and suddenly we go up 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:39.220
 at altogether we motta a minus 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:40.470

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:46.209

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:52.720
 just missed once again go 

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:53.409
 against attack or yes is still a 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.750
 decisive pass 

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:57.519
 I do not believe it I do not believe it 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.500

 I saw you go there and we go to aa 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:20.829
 we passed right before the end I would have 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:22.870
 even could ask to be in a 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:25.570
 other team in a team a little 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:29.110
 little higher but so suddenly 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:32.220

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.220
