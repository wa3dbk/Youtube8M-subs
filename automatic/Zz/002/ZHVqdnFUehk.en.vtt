00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
well right now I was setting up xbm

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.830 
well right now I was setting up xbm
starting<00:00:31.439> up<00:00:31.500> for<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.679> first<00:00:31.800> time<00:00:32.070> I<00:00:32.969> just

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
what I went a hard of a while ago and

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.330 
what I went a hard of a while ago and
selling<00:00:37.170> XP<00:00:37.530> didn't<00:00:37.829> have<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:37.980> hard<00:00:38.129> data<00:00:38.250> to

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
selling XP didn't have a hard data to

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.889 
selling XP didn't have a hard data to
begin<00:00:38.460> with<00:00:38.730> but<00:00:38.910> I<00:00:38.969> took<00:00:39.030> an<00:00:39.239> 80<00:00:39.420> gigabyte

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
oven out of an external hard drive so

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:49.100 
oven out of an external hard drive so
anyways<00:00:43.230> so<00:00:45.110> this<00:00:46.110> thing<00:00:47.780> that<00:00:48.780> is<00:00:48.899> for<00:00:48.930> a

while<00:00:49.350> it's<00:00:49.620> been<00:00:49.739> like<00:00:49.950> I'm<00:00:50.270> at<00:00:51.270> least<00:00:51.449> three

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
while it's been like I'm at least three

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.439 
while it's been like I'm at least three
weeks<00:00:51.899> now<00:00:52.140> and<00:00:52.640> when<00:00:53.640> I<00:00:53.670> first<00:00:53.879> got<00:00:54.149> I<00:00:54.210> didn't

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
weeks now and when I first got I didn't

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.529 
weeks now and when I first got I didn't
have<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:54.570> power<00:00:54.809> supply<00:00:54.989> for<00:00:55.410> it<00:00:55.500> I'd<00:00:56.489> I<00:00:57.000> had<00:00:57.510> a

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
have a power supply for it I'd I had a

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.920 
have a power supply for it I'd I had a
power<00:00:57.870> supply<00:00:57.989> matching<00:00:58.559> voltage<00:00:58.980> but<00:00:59.309> I<00:01:00.059> was

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
power supply matching voltage but I was

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.560 
power supply matching voltage but I was
about<00:01:01.079> an<00:01:01.230> amp<00:01:01.789> one<00:01:02.789> amp<00:01:03.120> too<00:01:03.539> low<00:01:04.070> so<00:01:05.070> I<00:01:05.729> didn't

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
about an amp one amp too low so I didn't

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.200 
about an amp one amp too low so I didn't
want<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:06.720> mess<00:01:06.869> it<00:01:06.900> up<00:01:07.140> or<00:01:07.260> anything<00:01:07.409> so

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
want to mess it up or anything so

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.880 
want to mess it up or anything so
decided<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.299> buy<00:01:09.510> a<00:01:09.570> new<00:01:09.810> power<00:01:10.229> supply<00:01:10.380> for<00:01:10.590> it

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
decided to buy a new power supply for it

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.940 
decided to buy a new power supply for it
so<00:01:11.070> that<00:01:11.310> without<00:01:11.490> checking<00:01:12.080> to<00:01:13.080> see<00:01:13.290> what<00:01:13.860> the

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
so that without checking to see what the

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.030 
so that without checking to see what the
amperage<00:01:14.310> and<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.580> new<00:01:14.700> power<00:01:14.939> supply<00:01:15.030> was<00:01:15.450> I

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
amperage and the new power supply was I

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:22.460 
amperage and the new power supply was I
I<00:01:17.040> bought<00:01:17.820> it<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:20.810> it<00:01:21.810> was<00:01:21.869> only<00:01:22.020> like<00:01:22.259> eight

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
I bought it and it was only like eight

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.890 
I bought it and it was only like eight
dollars<00:01:22.680> total<00:01:23.220> so<00:01:24.030> I<00:01:24.060> bought<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.509> thing<00:01:24.720> and

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
dollars total so I bought the thing and

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.679 
dollars total so I bought the thing and
when<00:01:24.990> I<00:01:25.020> came<00:01:25.259> here<00:01:25.470> I<00:01:25.530> realized<00:01:25.740> that<00:01:26.100> it<00:01:26.250> was

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:26.689 
when I came here I realized that it was

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:29.060 
when I came here I realized that it was
three<00:01:27.689> point<00:01:27.930> six<00:01:28.170> two<00:01:28.409> amps<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:28.950> this

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
three point six two amps and this

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.850 
three point six two amps and this
laptops<00:01:29.490> is<00:01:29.610> four<00:01:29.909> point<00:01:30.380> six<00:01:31.380> amps<00:01:31.770> or

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
laptops is four point six amps or

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.100 
laptops is four point six amps or
something<00:01:32.100> like<00:01:32.189> that<00:01:32.479> so<00:01:35.509> it<00:01:36.509> actually<00:01:36.750> works

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
something like that so it actually works

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.100 
something like that so it actually works
fine<00:01:37.530> I<00:01:38.090> think<00:01:39.090> just<00:01:39.270> I<00:01:39.450> think<00:01:39.509> it<00:01:39.750> is<00:01:39.840> supposed

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
fine I think just I think it is supposed

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:40.670 
fine I think just I think it is supposed
to<00:01:40.259> mean

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
to mean

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.950 
to mean
this<00:01:41.070> laptop<00:01:41.310> supposed<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:42.360> mean<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.509> four

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
this laptop supposed to mean a four

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.190 
this laptop supposed to mean a four
point<00:01:43.200> six<00:01:43.409> max<00:01:44.130> but<00:01:44.630> it<00:01:45.630> works<00:01:45.840> it<00:01:46.079> works

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
point six max but it works it works

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.020 
point six max but it works it works
found<00:01:46.530> 3<00:01:46.890> point<00:01:47.100> 6<00:01:47.280> 2<00:01:47.460> amps<00:01:47.700> that's<00:01:47.820> kind<00:01:47.970> of

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
found 3 point 6 2 amps that's kind of

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.039 
found 3 point 6 2 amps that's kind of
waste<00:01:48.240> a<00:01:48.299> little<00:01:48.479> bit<00:01:48.570> of<00:01:48.630> money<00:01:48.750> but<00:01:48.899> that's

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
waste a little bit of money but that's

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.649 
waste a little bit of money but that's
ok<00:01:49.490> and<00:01:50.490> I'm<00:01:50.610> already<00:01:50.729> on<00:01:50.850> critical<00:01:51.210> battery

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
ok and I'm already on critical battery

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:57.560 
ok and I'm already on critical battery
power<00:01:51.899> so<00:01:52.049> anyways<00:01:54.560> it's<00:01:55.560> got<00:01:56.030> steam<00:01:57.030> 512

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
power so anyways it's got steam 512

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.810

I as I said I put a 2 gig hard drive
from<00:02:03.960> a<00:02:04.049> external<00:02:04.860> hard<00:02:04.890> drive<00:02:05.189> in<00:02:05.280> it<00:02:05.399> I

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
from a external hard drive in it I

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.609 
from a external hard drive in it I
didn't<00:02:06.750> have<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:07.020> power<00:02:07.350> supply<00:02:07.560> for

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
didn't have the power supply for

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.390 
didn't have the power supply for
external<00:02:08.039> hard<00:02:08.250> drive<00:02:08.629> and<00:02:10.250> processor<00:02:11.250> it's

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
external hard drive and processor it's

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.200 
external hard drive and processor it's
Centrino<00:02:13.030> right<00:02:13.450> there<00:02:13.690> but<00:02:14.470> I<00:02:14.980> believe<00:02:15.700> if<00:02:16.000> I

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
Centrino right there but I believe if I

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:20.940 
Centrino right there but I believe if I
start<00:02:16.720> up<00:02:17.490> system<00:02:18.490> information<00:02:19.440> it<00:02:20.440> will<00:02:20.650> tell

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
start up system information it will tell

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.040 
start up system information it will tell
you<00:02:21.100> that<00:02:21.190> it's<00:02:21.340> a<00:02:21.400> Pentium<00:02:21.820> 4<00:02:22.240> because<00:02:22.660> I<00:02:22.780> went

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
you that it's a Pentium 4 because I went

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:24.600 
you that it's a Pentium 4 because I went
into<00:02:23.080> the<00:02:23.290> BIOS<00:02:23.710> and<00:02:23.950> it<00:02:24.100> said<00:02:24.370> it<00:02:24.490> was<00:02:24.580> a

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
into the BIOS and it said it was a

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.050 
into the BIOS and it said it was a
Pentium<00:02:24.970> 4<00:02:25.240> 126<00:02:26.020> gigahertz<00:02:26.730> and<00:02:27.730> I<00:02:27.790> think<00:02:27.970> it

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
Pentium 4 126 gigahertz and I think it

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:34.050 
Pentium 4 126 gigahertz and I think it
will<00:02:28.150> do<00:02:28.300> the<00:02:28.450> same<00:02:28.480> here<00:02:29.320> but<00:02:30.010> I<00:02:32.760> doesn't<00:02:33.760> say

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
will do the same here but I doesn't say

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.590 
will do the same here but I doesn't say
this<00:02:34.300> is<00:02:34.450> 1.6<00:02:35.230> about<00:02:35.740> that<00:02:36.270> so<00:02:37.270> I<00:02:37.360> just

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
this is 1.6 about that so I just

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.580 
this is 1.6 about that so I just
installed<00:02:38.020> XP<00:02:39.150> Pro<00:02:40.150> it's<00:02:41.080> got<00:02:41.290> a<00:02:41.320> working

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
installed XP Pro it's got a working

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:48.510 
installed XP Pro it's got a working
battery<00:02:42.100> in<00:02:42.640> it<00:02:44.370> let's<00:02:45.370> say<00:02:46.890> it's<00:02:47.890> got<00:02:48.220> a

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
battery in it let's say it's got a

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.900 
battery in it let's say it's got a
wireless<00:02:48.910> card<00:02:49.530> built-in<00:02:50.530> so<00:02:51.490> I<00:02:51.550> don't<00:02:51.700> need<00:02:51.880> a

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
wireless card built-in so I don't need a

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.160 
wireless card built-in so I don't need a
you<00:02:52.330> know<00:02:52.420> shove<00:02:52.720> a<00:02:52.750> shuttle<00:02:53.320> Cardon<00:02:53.680> it

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
you know shove a shuttle Cardon it

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.080 
you know shove a shuttle Cardon it
increase<00:02:56.170> resolution<00:02:56.980> I<00:02:57.190> don't<00:02:57.400> have<00:02:57.520> drivers

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
increase resolution I don't have drivers

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.580 
increase resolution I don't have drivers
for<00:02:58.270> it<00:02:58.390> yet<00:02:58.780> you<00:02:59.650> see<00:02:59.830> I'm<00:03:00.130> thinking<00:03:00.160> about

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
for it yet you see I'm thinking about

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.740 
for it yet you see I'm thinking about
putting<00:03:02.590> this<00:03:02.770> hard<00:03:03.010> drive<00:03:03.250> in<00:03:04.210> this<00:03:04.540> thing

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
putting this hard drive in this thing

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.060 
putting this hard drive in this thing
into<00:03:05.170> this<00:03:05.410> thing<00:03:05.650> this<00:03:06.550> is<00:03:06.610> a<00:03:07.800> slightly<00:03:08.800> older

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.070 
into this thing this is a slightly older

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.310 
into this thing this is a slightly older
but<00:03:09.370> better<00:03:09.670> laptops<00:03:10.360> more<00:03:10.660> interesting<00:03:11.230> on

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
but better laptops more interesting on

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.890 
but better laptops more interesting on
making<00:03:11.530> a<00:03:11.560> separate<00:03:11.770> video<00:03:11.920> on<00:03:12.010> that<00:03:12.100> later<00:03:12.900> so

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
making a separate video on that later so

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.780 
making a separate video on that later so
I'm<00:03:13.960> not<00:03:14.050> gonna<00:03:14.200> install<00:03:15.190> as<00:03:15.310> hard<00:03:15.490> drive<00:03:15.670> with

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
I'm not gonna install as hard drive with

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.190 
I'm not gonna install as hard drive with
drivers<00:03:16.270> yet<00:03:16.480> I'm<00:03:16.600> just<00:03:16.660> going<00:03:16.900> to<00:03:16.930> put<00:03:17.080> in

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
drivers yet I'm just going to put in

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.790 
drivers yet I'm just going to put in
that<00:03:17.350> thing<00:03:18.420> so<00:03:19.420> I'm<00:03:20.410> not<00:03:20.500> gonna<00:03:20.620> do<00:03:20.770> that

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.800 
that thing so I'm not gonna do that

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.820 
that thing so I'm not gonna do that
quite<00:03:21.250> so<00:03:21.550> yet<00:03:21.970> but<00:03:22.780> the<00:03:22.900> merit<00:03:23.140> resolution<00:03:23.710> is

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 
quite so yet but the merit resolution is

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:30.300 
quite so yet but the merit resolution is
1024<00:03:24.340> by<00:03:24.520> 768<00:03:24.820> default<00:03:25.690> you<00:03:25.870> know<00:03:26.970> now<00:03:29.310> let's

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
1024 by 768 default you know now let's

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:30.930 
1024 by 768 default you know now let's
see<00:03:30.490> what<00:03:30.640> else

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
see what else

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.260 
see what else
I<00:03:31.210> said<00:03:31.990> XP<00:03:32.380> Professional<00:03:32.980> right<00:03:33.850> out<00:03:34.030> there<00:03:34.180> I

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:34.270 
I said XP Professional right out there I

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:37.830 
I said XP Professional right out there I
bought<00:03:34.480> the<00:03:34.660> new<00:03:34.780> power<00:03:35.080> supply<00:03:35.530> I<00:03:36.690> decided<00:03:37.690> I

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
bought the new power supply I decided I

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.660 
bought the new power supply I decided I
might<00:03:37.990> as<00:03:38.170> well<00:03:38.350> see<00:03:38.770> if<00:03:38.860> it<00:03:38.950> works<00:03:39.220> so<00:03:39.400> what<00:03:39.640> I

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
might as well see if it works so what I

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.010 
might as well see if it works so what I
did<00:03:39.940> was<00:03:40.090> I<00:03:40.210> took<00:03:40.240> the<00:03:40.600> power<00:03:40.720> supply<00:03:40.990> I

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:41.020 
did was I took the power supply I

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.770 
did was I took the power supply I
already<00:03:41.410> had<00:03:41.680> and<00:03:41.980> I<00:03:42.970> plugged<00:03:43.270> it<00:03:43.390> in<00:03:43.480> with<00:03:43.660> it

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
already had and I plugged it in with it

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.600 
already had and I plugged it in with it
let<00:03:43.959> the<00:03:44.050> battery<00:03:44.440> charge<00:03:44.500> but<00:03:45.010> I<00:03:45.070> didn't<00:03:45.430> turn

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610 
let the battery charge but I didn't turn

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:47.790 
let the battery charge but I didn't turn
the<00:03:45.670> computer<00:03:46.270> on<00:03:46.330> because<00:03:47.020> I<00:03:47.110> figured<00:03:47.440> it's<00:03:47.709> a

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:47.800 
the computer on because I figured it's a

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.850 
the computer on because I figured it's a
bad<00:03:47.980> it's<00:03:48.250> if<00:03:48.670> the<00:03:48.940> computer<00:03:49.630> is<00:03:49.660> 4.6<00:03:50.200> amps<00:03:50.740> and

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:50.860 
bad it's if the computer is 4.6 amps and

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.520 
bad it's if the computer is 4.6 amps and
the<00:03:51.330> power<00:03:52.330> supply<00:03:52.570> has<00:03:52.600> only<00:03:53.020> three<00:03:53.290> point

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
the power supply has only three point

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.110 
the power supply has only three point
files<00:03:53.770> gonna<00:03:54.040> overload<00:03:54.490> the<00:03:54.610> power<00:03:54.820> supply<00:03:55.090> a

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
files gonna overload the power supply a

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.400 
files gonna overload the power supply a
power<00:03:55.360> slide<00:03:55.570> is<00:03:55.660> going<00:03:55.810> to<00:03:55.870> blow<00:03:56.020> up<00:03:56.200> so<00:03:56.350> I

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
power slide is going to blow up so I

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:57.660 
power slide is going to blow up so I
just<00:03:56.560> let<00:03:56.650> it<00:03:56.680> charge<00:03:57.010> a<00:03:57.070> battery<00:03:57.310> for<00:03:57.610> a

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
just let it charge a battery for a

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.060 
just let it charge a battery for a
little<00:03:57.880> while<00:03:58.060> and<00:03:58.959> I<00:03:59.140> turns<00:03:59.380> on<00:03:59.500> realize<00:03:59.950> it

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.070 
little while and I turns on realize it

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:01.949 
little while and I turns on realize it
font<00:04:00.280> what<00:04:00.520> we're<00:04:00.880> turned<00:04:01.060> on<00:04:01.180> fine<00:04:01.510> went<00:04:01.900> to

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
font what we're turned on fine went to

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:04.620 
font what we're turned on fine went to
the<00:04:02.050> BIOS<00:04:02.410> and<00:04:02.440> ran<00:04:02.709> out<00:04:02.830> of<00:04:02.890> battery<00:04:03.280> power<00:04:03.630> so

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
the BIOS and ran out of battery power so

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:09.510 
the BIOS and ran out of battery power so
I<00:04:05.170> knew<00:04:05.709> it<00:04:05.830> worked<00:04:06.600> and<00:04:07.600> everything<00:04:08.080> so<00:04:08.530> but

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:09.520 
I knew it worked and everything so but

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:10.830 
I knew it worked and everything so but
now<00:04:09.610> it<00:04:09.670> works<00:04:09.820> great<00:04:10.240> I'm<00:04:10.450> going<00:04:10.570> to<00:04:10.630> sell

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
now it works great I'm going to sell

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.180 
now it works great I'm going to sell
this<00:04:11.050> thing<00:04:11.350> I<00:04:11.530> don't<00:04:11.709> need<00:04:11.830> it<00:04:11.950> for<00:04:12.040> myself

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
this thing I don't need it for myself

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:17.830 
this thing I don't need it for myself
since<00:04:12.640> I<00:04:12.820> already<00:04:13.030> have<00:04:13.209> a<00:04:13.510> few<00:04:14.380> laptops<00:04:15.690> so

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
since I already have a few laptops so

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.500 
since I already have a few laptops so
what<00:04:18.739> else<00:04:18.919> I<00:04:19.100> really<00:04:19.130> liked<00:04:19.669> lap<00:04:20.000> the<00:04:20.329> Dell

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.510 
what else I really liked lap the Dell

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:25.060 
what else I really liked lap the Dell
laptops<00:04:21.049> of<00:04:21.320> this<00:04:21.590> era<00:04:22.040> a<00:04:22.540> 2004<00:04:23.540> --is--<00:04:23.860> as<00:04:24.860> you

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
laptops of this era a 2004 --is-- as you

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.070 
laptops of this era a 2004 --is-- as you
can<00:04:25.220> see<00:04:25.400> it's<00:04:25.520> got<00:04:25.669> a<00:04:25.700> you<00:04:26.030> know<00:04:26.150> as<00:04:26.840> I<00:04:26.930> said

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
can see it's got a you know as I said

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.330 
can see it's got a you know as I said
before<00:04:27.230> it's<00:04:27.410> kind<00:04:27.470> of<00:04:27.560> working<00:04:27.860> better<00:04:28.010> so<00:04:28.280> I

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
before it's kind of working better so I

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.170 
before it's kind of working better so I
can<00:04:28.460> unplug<00:04:28.669> that<00:04:28.790> and<00:04:29.000> works<00:04:29.360> fine<00:04:30.520> no<00:04:31.520> 65

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
can unplug that and works fine no 65

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.720 
can unplug that and works fine no 65
percent<00:04:32.630> I<00:04:33.190> don't<00:04:34.190> think<00:04:34.310> I<00:04:34.370> had<00:04:34.490> it<00:04:34.520> plugged

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:34.730 
percent I don't think I had it plugged

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:37.390 
percent I don't think I had it plugged
in<00:04:34.880> to<00:04:35.000> begin<00:04:35.120> with<00:04:35.450> actually<00:04:35.960> oh<00:04:36.169> I<00:04:37.040> unplug

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
in to begin with actually oh I unplug

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.820 
in to begin with actually oh I unplug
the<00:04:37.460> power<00:04:37.639> supply<00:04:37.970> that's<00:04:38.120> why<00:04:38.389> Oh

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
the power supply that's why Oh

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.879 
the power supply that's why Oh
so<00:04:40.100> the<00:04:40.220> entire<00:04:40.490> time<00:04:40.550> I<00:04:41.060> installed<00:04:41.540> a<00:04:41.860> xp<00:04:42.860> home

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:42.889 
so the entire time I installed a xp home

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:45.670 
so the entire time I installed a xp home
and<00:04:43.250> only<00:04:43.310> did<00:04:43.550> about<00:04:43.760> 35<00:04:44.300> percent<00:04:44.870> battery<00:04:45.290> on

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
and only did about 35 percent battery on

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.970 
and only did about 35 percent battery on
it

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:45.980 
it

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:49.120 
it
so<00:04:46.700> anyways<00:04:47.590> close<00:04:48.590> it<00:04:48.770> up

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.130 
so anyways close it up

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:52.060 
so anyways close it up
so<00:04:49.880> as<00:04:50.000> you<00:04:50.120> can<00:04:50.240> see<00:04:50.300> press<00:04:51.080> that<00:04:51.290> got<00:04:51.889> some

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:52.070 
so as you can see press that got some

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:54.580 
so as you can see press that got some
battery<00:04:52.340> power<00:04:52.550> there<00:04:52.790> I<00:04:53.380> think<00:04:54.380> I've<00:04:54.500> already

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:54.590 
battery power there I think I've already

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:55.900 
battery power there I think I've already
said<00:04:54.830> this<00:04:54.950> but<00:04:55.130> I've<00:04:55.400> left<00:04:55.550> and<00:04:55.729> Scott's

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:55.910 
said this but I've left and Scott's

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:58.990 
said this but I've left and Scott's
originally<00:04:56.630> came<00:04:56.750> 512<00:04:57.350> makes<00:04:57.500> a<00:04:57.590> Ram<00:04:57.800> put<00:04:58.520> 760

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.280 
originally came 512 makes a Ram put 760
nm<00:04:59.180> I<00:04:59.330> think<00:04:59.510> it<00:04:59.600> will<00:04:59.660> upgrade<00:04:59.840> into<00:05:00.229> a

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:00.290 
nm I think it will upgrade into a

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:03.580 
nm I think it will upgrade into a
gigabyte<00:05:00.770> if<00:05:00.950> I<00:05:01.100> have<00:05:01.220> the<00:05:02.050> available<00:05:03.050> space<00:05:03.350> I

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:03.590 
gigabyte if I have the available space I

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:07.570 
gigabyte if I have the available space I
mean<00:05:04.280> Ram<00:05:05.710> if<00:05:06.710> you<00:05:06.800> want<00:05:06.919> to<00:05:07.010> see<00:05:07.070> the<00:05:07.190> video<00:05:07.430> of

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:09.320 
me cleaning up the CPU fan it was really

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:10.960 
me cleaning up the CPU fan it was really
nasty<00:05:09.560> as<00:05:09.889> to<00:05:10.010> like<00:05:10.250> if<00:05:10.400> you'd<00:05:10.520> like<00:05:10.700> to<00:05:10.820> see

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 
and I shut the lid good drivers will fix

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:27.520 
and I shut the lid good drivers will fix
that<00:05:24.880> there<00:05:25.880> might<00:05:26.000> xq<00:05:26.360> proceeding<00:05:26.960> that<00:05:27.050> CD

out<00:05:27.650> of<00:05:27.800> there<00:05:28.720> CMOS<00:05:29.720> battery<00:05:29.979> this<00:05:30.979> is

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:31.160 
out of there CMOS battery this is

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.610 
out of there CMOS battery this is
seamless<00:05:31.430> battery<00:05:31.850> it's<00:05:32.210> dead

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:33.620 
seamless battery it's dead

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.940 
seamless battery it's dead
I<00:05:33.650> took<00:05:33.919> the<00:05:34.370> laptop<00:05:34.820> apart<00:05:35.539> she<00:05:36.470> the<00:05:36.560> keyboard

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:36.950 
I took the laptop apart she the keyboard

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:38.890 
I took the laptop apart she the keyboard
off<00:05:37.070> the<00:05:37.190> top<00:05:37.370> and<00:05:37.550> everything<00:05:37.850> off<00:05:38.000> looking

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:38.900 
off the top and everything off looking

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:42.880 
off the top and everything off looking
for<00:05:39.140> the<00:05:39.229> CMOS<00:05:39.530> battery<00:05:40.210> circuit<00:05:41.470> 1/2<00:05:42.470> stuff

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:42.890 
for the CMOS battery circuit 1/2 stuff

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:46.840 
for the CMOS battery circuit 1/2 stuff
out<00:05:43.070> even<00:05:43.729> the<00:05:43.789> modern<00:05:44.060> off<00:05:44.360> and<00:05:45.070> I<00:05:46.070> later

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:46.850 
out even the modern off and I later

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:50.670 
out even the modern off and I later
figured<00:05:47.150> out<00:05:47.419> that<00:05:47.660> the<00:05:48.020> CMOS<00:05:48.440> battery<00:05:48.970> was

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:50.680 
figured out that the CMOS battery was

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:55.570 
figured out that the CMOS battery was
simply<00:05:52.060> placed<00:05:54.310> under<00:05:55.310> the<00:05:55.400> battery

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:55.580 
simply placed under the battery

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:59.770 
simply placed under the battery
compartment<00:05:56.090> so<00:05:57.639> yeah<00:05:58.639> I'd<00:05:58.880> Spotify<00:05:59.600> under

00:05:59.770 --> 00:05:59.780 
compartment so yeah I'd Spotify under

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:01.090 
compartment so yeah I'd Spotify under
one<00:05:59.930> of<00:06:00.020> these<00:06:00.139> a<00:06:00.169> few<00:06:00.260> days<00:06:00.530> ago<00:06:00.710> she'll<00:06:01.010> be

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:01.100 
one of these a few days ago she'll be

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:04.629 
one of these a few days ago she'll be
arriving<00:06:01.430> shortly<00:06:01.460> and<00:06:02.060> I<00:06:03.400> don't<00:06:04.400> really<00:06:04.550> see

00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:04.639 
arriving shortly and I don't really see

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:09.040 
arriving shortly and I don't really see
much<00:06:04.820> matter<00:06:05.060> six<00:06:05.300> seven<00:06:05.600> point<00:06:05.840> two<00:06:06.080> volt<00:06:08.050> yes

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:09.050 
much matter six seven point two volt yes

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:14.320 
much matter six seven point two volt yes
and<00:06:09.470> so<00:06:11.380> waiting<00:06:12.380> for<00:06:12.470> that<00:06:12.530> to<00:06:12.650> arrive<00:06:13.210> so<00:06:14.210> I

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:14.330 
and so waiting for that to arrive so I

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:16.540 
and so waiting for that to arrive so I
can<00:06:14.539> so<00:06:15.470> going<00:06:15.650> to<00:06:15.710> have<00:06:15.830> proper<00:06:16.280> time<00:06:16.520> and

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:16.550 
can so going to have proper time and
