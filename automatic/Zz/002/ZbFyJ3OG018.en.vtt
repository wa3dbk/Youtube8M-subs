 let's hear the camera or 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:11.289
 when we photograph a building an inevitable effect is that of the 

00:00:11.819 --> 00:00:17.210
 in the so-called excellent and vertical falling lines not just a vertical but 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:18.460
 converge 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.079
 but 

00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:22.429
 lost diagonally upwards 

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:24.659
 for the effect that 

00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:26.509
 add resource hacker 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:32.250
 and I like you so much years ago it was considered an error in this 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.750
 however, photography is not particularly accentuated if we do not have it 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:36.870
 space 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.010
 which happens when it is not possible to instinctively move backwards orientates one 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.640
 high sol machine 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.040
 and mbe -

 Today on television 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.280
 comments 1 of the type rocketed 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.390
 there is a very fast method that allows us to sort things out a little and 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.250
 she is a perhaps little known filter. oppo little used 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.480
 and we find it in lens correction distortion filter 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.750
 but his window work with a grill being lean to be right 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:11.530
 for 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:17.120
 see how much shearing maxillo intervention shifted its vertical perspective 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.750
 we hope that the plans adapt 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.420
 and allow us to report the - 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.980
 in correct position quaestor 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.350
 and for professionals he calls verticality e 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:35.560
 the architectures of itself there is no other way 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.800
 there are other controls also horizontal perspectives will depend on you 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:40.870
 from the images 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:44.250
 whether to apply the intervention only 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.170
 that is with these controls 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:54.960
 correct red margin channel dear vignetting alone with corrections 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.600
 that sometimes are necessary for with the cameras they have 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:04.520
 from some defect my invoices the one that often forms the edge 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.030
 image with a 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.179
 common then i'm sure 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.309
 it is possible to intervene 

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:13.649
 accentuate pourriture this effect 5 on image 

00:02:13.649 --> 00:02:16.659
 grandmother is not necessary 

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:19.829
 what it begins to let you know 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:21.819
 pina how to correct 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:24.089
 the verticality 

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:26.579
 in a perspective 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:29.719
 we confirm 

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:34.739
 and what you find love in this way in photoshop so will be know the nose 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:36.329
 to newborns 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:41.269
 adjust a little bit because it is not visible under the transparent background 20 

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:45.549
 alemanno soltario 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:48.549
 eliminating excess barrels 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:54.469
 and here is our perspective 

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:56.680
 perfectly equipped
