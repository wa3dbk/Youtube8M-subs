00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:11.750
 in the previous lesson the principle of operation 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:15.170
 internal combustion engine 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:19.130
 we found out the valve at the right time 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:21.080
 open and close quite 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.279
 it is natural that they themselves are not 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.820
 can do this 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:29.810
 someone opens and closes them let's 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:33.970
 let's deal with it so new detail 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.970
 which is called cam 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:42.280
 turning the cam of your serving 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:44.590
 part he presses the valve in 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.829
 the result is the valve goes down then 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.219
 there is 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:51.220
 opens with further rotation 

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:55.210
 cam valve stays open 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:01:01.120
 position someone has to raise it 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:05.229
 will do the valve spring and so 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.130
 the spring closes the valve turning 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:10.450
 cam 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:12.570
 opens the valve and the spring closes 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.570
 valve 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:19.560
 and how does the spring grab 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.929
 valve and raises it up for that 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.570
 on the valve stem there is an annular 

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:27.710
 groove or maybe 2 or 3 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:31.490
 In which the next part is inserted 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.490
 called crackers 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:38.990
 rusks usually lie on a plate so 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.390
 the next new part is called from 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:45.350
 valve disc with internal 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:47.780
 surface tapering if we 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.579
 now make an effort to the plate valves 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.340
 and compress the valve spring 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:55.819
 it is now in the annular recess of the valve 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.829
 You can insert two crackers, they also 

00:01:55.819 --> 00:02:01.369
 have a tapered surface and therefore 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:04.830
 when we remove the force from the spring plate 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:07.360
 valve will clamp crackers 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:11.280
 having made this operation, drivers say 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.280
 for crackers or valve 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:18.360
 as repetition we see 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:21.750
 turning the cam he clicks on 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:24.120
 the valve that is, it opens and the valve 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.750
 the spring returns the valve to the top 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:30.200
 position that is it closes 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:32.820
 another question and who turns the cam 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.390
 the fact is the cam is 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.290
 part of the next new part 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.380
 which is called gas 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:46.170
 camshaft or drivers more often 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:48.930
 call it camshaft camshaft has 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:54.200
 supporting neck on which it is attached in 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.200
 the head of the block and already familiar to us cams 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:02.569
 on this fragment we see how 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:02.569
 turning camshaft work valve 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:14.000
 Now again, the next question and who 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.590
 turns camshaft 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.350
 for this at the front end of the crank 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.870
 shaft is mounted 6 on 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:24.870
 on the camshaft will also 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:27.480
 set gear and torque 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:30.840
 crankshaft torque to camshaft 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:35.100
 will be transmitted either by chain or here 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:37.740
 so timing belt correct 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.840
 installing the drive belt will decide 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:40.560
 main task of gas distribution 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.440
 mechanism 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:46.020
 it is at the right time to open 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.490
 appropriate valve and at the right moment 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:52.160
 shut it down 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:56.510
 now repeat the inlet compression 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.510
 expansion release 

00:04:01.969 --> 00:04:06.060
 depending on the design 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:09.439
 gas distribution mechanism 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:12.049
 effects on the valve can be performed 

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:18.410
 directly familiar to us 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:23.190
 cam or through a special lever 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:25.050
 which drivers call a rocker and in 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:27.570
 This situation will cam 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:30.949
 affect the rocker and he will already 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.949
 push the valve 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:42.380
 remembering the school physics program we 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:45.180
 we conclude that when the engine is running 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:47.610
 the valve is very hot and 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:51.300
 therefore lengthened 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:54.389
 and when cooled, it shrinks 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:57.090
 But where will this valve extension go? 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:57.750
 up can not go because rests 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:01.290
 in the lever 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:03.479
 it only remains for him to go down in 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:06.060
 In this case, the valve is not tightly closed. 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:09.330
 will and let's say in the compression stroke 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:11.310
 no compression will be because all 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.740
 gases will go in through not tight 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:15.600
 closed valve 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:18.870
 to prevent this from happening the valve must 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:22.740
 close tightly that is lengthen it 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:25.470
 should only up this way with us 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:28.500
 a thermal gap appears between the rod 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:31.380
 valve and lever within 2 tenths 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:36.560
 millimeter in reality this gap 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:36.560
 measured between lever and cam 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:41.820
 check of this thermal gap 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:44.990
 produce using a special 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:44.990
 flat probe 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:55.610
 to adjust this thermal gap 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:58.470
 adjusting screw or bolt is used 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:01.560
 so when the screw rotates the cotton 

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:02.550
 side clearance decreases turning into 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:05.420
 the other side 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:05.420
 the gap increases 

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:12.800
 on more modern engines 

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:15.280
 special hydraulic compensator is used 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:17.170
 that is, a device that allows 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:20.030
 auto compensate 

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:21.890
 thermal expansion valve and in 

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:25.030
 In this case, no adjustment valves 

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:25.030
 no need 

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:32.690
 during car operation 

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:36.440
 must be periodically checked 

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:36.440
 thermal gap 

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:45.790
 and if necessary produce it 

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:45.790
 adjustment 

00:06:58.089 --> 00:07:02.419
 also need to know what if 

00:07:00.979 --> 00:07:06.169
 engine running 

00:07:02.419 --> 00:07:08.240
 drive belt breaks then 

00:07:06.169 --> 00:07:09.619
 the camshaft is not connected in any way 

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:11.990
 now with crankshaft 

00:07:09.619 --> 00:07:14.240
 icons may stop completely 

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:16.249
 arbitrarily in this position with 

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:19.580
 which one of the valves will be 

00:07:16.249 --> 00:07:22.009
 the piston is fully open in this case 

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:24.639
 moving up can face 

00:07:22.009 --> 00:07:24.639
 valve 

00:07:24.919 --> 00:07:31.139
 in this case the engine is facing 

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:35.169
 serious repair and so bend 

00:07:31.139 --> 00:07:38.050
 valve at the meeting with the piston 

00:07:35.169 --> 00:07:40.509
 that this does not have to happen 

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:43.229
 replace periodically 

00:07:40.509 --> 00:07:43.229
 drive belt
