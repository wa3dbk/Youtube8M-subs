00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.660
 a way to enjoy this early morning 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:44.630
 since the day before 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.630

 my next test that inter 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.420

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.489
 two more sparsts he claims that neither more 

00:02:16.179 --> 00:02:18.879

 it is a very broad market consumption 

00:03:18.679 --> 00:03:19.999
