00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.500
 the diver see my name is Ivanova Galina 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:11.250
 and today i want to show you how 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.730
 make these elegant mystics for 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.710
 roses 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.070
 which can also be used for 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:20.340
 decorating and decorating cards 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:24.199
 frames and so on how to make a rose 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.730
 you see now 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:30.630
 click on the screen click on the pictures 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.600
 and move on to make the roses themselves 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.649
 a rose 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:37.739
 to make such a leaf 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:41.520
 need a square piece of paper i 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.800
 I take a size of 9 by 9 centimeters from me 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.239
 double sided paper on one side 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:50.910
 slept nets on the other hand she 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:57.600
 monophonic bend color square 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:01:00.989
 side inward diagonally and not 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:07.369
 turning again bend 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:12.600
 to mate happens triangle 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:23.509
 I unfold and this left corner 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:29.600
 I bend here the middle one straightening and 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:29.600
 once more bend and even to the middle 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:47.710
 this lower corner bend too 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:50.620
 center here and this little corner too 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:57.970
 I bend here to the middle, that is, for uroyu 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:02:02.080
 how would such a stalk carry to here 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:04.210
 so here I put it 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.520
 there will be a stalk of leaves now all is needed 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:09.070
 it is deployed neatly 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:12.459
 unfolded these folds come in handy to us 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:13.360
 a little later and unfold completely 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:16.240
 Mystic 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:19.050
 Here is the half square need 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:23.590
 harmonize 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:25.770
 and quite a small harmonica and so 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:33.700
 corner fold to the center 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:34.390
 I live the fold now I bend the little corner 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:39.010
 edge of 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:40.780
 and the bottom line is that each 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.840
 stripes divided by half 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.769
 for starters let's divide it to answer 8 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:50.200
 stripes 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:57.970
 and so this jigit bend 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:03:03.220
 and pull up the central diagonals here 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:05.830
 so it turned out 4 stripes now here 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:12.870
 I pull up this middle striped 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:12.870
 previous fold 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:24.500
 you can turn on the trail to light 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:28.250
 I pull this side up 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.250
 central diagonal 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:39.800
 Further here this strip here and little corner 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:51.390
 here in this way birth but this one 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.920
 half elevator to us 8 stripes for 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.670
 so that not stick turned out like this 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.510
 color 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:04:02.520
 I'm doing the last corrugation on the purl 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:04.350
 side and the bottom line is that to 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.960
 again each strip divided by 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:10.950
 take half 

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:17.040
 fold up to the central diagonal 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:29.040
 and just as well to make each stripes 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:31.710
 then bend over and pull up to 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:36.030
 I have a previous one 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:42.050
 It was further on I bend it I do from 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:46.620
 her mountain you again pull up 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:53.040
 previous fold and so small 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:56.250
 corner too bend half so 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:05:00.120
 how this part turned out at me 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:04.169
 what color and wanted to do on here 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:07.980
 this line bends and sticks 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:12.030
 but you already see a half 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:14.610
 practically formed and now us 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:19.550
 these creases that have already done will come in handy 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:29.030
 that is, the tail is bent here in the center of 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:33.080
 once again to the center this little corner here 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:38.310
 The central angle of the OS should center here and 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:41.010
 the result is such a leaflet 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:43.830
 rather graceful I donâ€™t really like me 

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:48.990
 I will use this leaf in order 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:51.270
 to collect a reference on the screen 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:54.150
 click on the pictures and go to 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:56.889
 make roses 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:58.750
