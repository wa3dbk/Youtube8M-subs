00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
really hot machine how hot we tested the

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.899 
really hot machine how hot we tested the
froth<00:01:54.420> coming<00:01:54.869> out<00:01:54.960> of<00:01:55.110> this<00:01:55.200> and<00:01:55.409> it<00:01:55.470> was<00:01:55.909> 145

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
I'll bet I know what that is that would

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.110 
I'll bet I know what that is that would
be<00:02:55.950> the<00:02:56.340> grind<00:02:56.580> settings

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
be the grind settings

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.699 
be the grind settings
how<00:02:57.300> many<00:02:57.510> grind<00:02:57.780> settings<00:02:58.140> here<00:02:58.290> there's

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
how many grind settings here there's

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.280 
how many grind settings here there's
five<00:02:59.040> and<00:02:59.490> this<00:02:59.700> has<00:02:59.910> a<00:03:00.180> ceramic<00:03:00.810> disc<00:03:01.080> grinder

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
five and this has a ceramic disc grinder

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.590 
five and this has a ceramic disc grinder
and<00:03:02.070> I<00:03:02.250> like<00:03:02.520> the<00:03:02.640> ceramic<00:03:03.000> disc<00:03:03.180> grinder<00:03:03.270> is

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
and I like the ceramic disc grinder is

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:04.760 
and I like the ceramic disc grinder is
what<00:03:03.720> we<00:03:03.840> all<00:03:03.959> like<00:03:04.170> them<00:03:04.350> because<00:03:04.500> they're

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
what we all like them because they're

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.400 
what we all like them because they're
quieter<00:03:05.610> and<00:03:06.300> less<00:03:06.690> heat<00:03:06.900> into<00:03:07.110> your<00:03:07.140> beans

this is a really quiet machine and just
to<00:03:45.150> give<00:03:45.269> you<00:03:45.300> an<00:03:45.450> example<00:03:45.810> when<00:03:46.470> I<00:03:46.769> was

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
to give you an example when I was

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.620 
to give you an example when I was
brewing<00:03:47.280> a<00:03:47.370> cup<00:03:47.550> of<00:03:47.670> tea<00:03:47.820> earlier<00:03:48.209> what<00:03:48.480> do<00:03:48.540> we

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
brewing a cup of tea earlier what do we

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.840 
brewing a cup of tea earlier what do we
notice<00:03:48.780> mark<00:03:49.140> that<00:03:49.709> the<00:03:49.920> water<00:03:50.280> hitting<00:03:50.640> the

notice mark that the water hitting the

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:52.790 
notice mark that the water hitting the
cup<00:03:51.060> is<00:03:51.239> actually<00:03:51.600> louder<00:03:51.840> than<00:03:52.260> the<00:03:52.410> pump<00:03:52.650> in

cup is actually louder than the pump in
the<00:03:52.860> machine<00:03:53.190> itself<00:03:53.610> no<00:03:53.940> I<00:03:54.180> mean<00:03:54.660> when<00:03:54.840> it's

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
the machine itself no I mean when it's

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:56.990 
the machine itself no I mean when it's
doing<00:03:55.350> a<00:03:55.560> shot<00:03:55.769> of<00:03:55.920> expresso<00:03:56.489> and<00:03:56.519> you<00:03:56.910> know
