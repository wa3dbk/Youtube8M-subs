00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.850
 hello to all boys now return to 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.779
 talk about air rifle 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.189
 then the 4.5 mm rifles, however, today it is 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.660
 let's take care of the 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.690
 small shooters 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.420
 today we will talk about the junior gamud under 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.570
 this nice and compact carbine is 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.960
 was made precisely for the kids e 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.600
 although in Italy it is these 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.939
 lowered carbines therefore under 7.5 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.980
 joules of energy that can be purchased from a 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.720
 adult public can be 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.120
 also used by minors with the 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.640
 adult supervision not only for i 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.670
 kids but this weapon is addressed 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.250
 also to women or otherwise shooters of 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.280
 female sex that do not have precisely 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.510
 a very large size and therefore not 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.379
 would find with a rifle of 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.430
 normal size 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:52.260
 let's see in more detail the 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.780
 junior hunter is an air rifle 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.430
 blackberry tablet ie with recharge 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.800
 of the plunger piston through 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.390
 bending the cane probably the 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.309
 junior lantern name is not much 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.320
 apt as in so many countries 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.540
 including the Italian air fighter 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.460
 tablet is forbidden but this weapon is 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.780
 dedicated to all the little shooters who 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.760
 they intend to approach the world 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.930
 of weapons and want a rifle 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.869
 suited to their physical dimensions 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.890
 reduced and perhaps with smaller hands than 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.470
 they can be those of a child 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.750
 precisely or those of a woman 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.580
 besides the reduced dimensions and weight yes 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.979
 speaks of 90 centimeters in length for 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.990
 just under 2 kg a few jumps immediately 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.540
 to the eye is the adjustable rear sight 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.280
 clearly visible at the top and in the drift 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.350
 but above all adjustable without 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.210
 the aid of external tools i 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.369
 fiber optic sticks that will make up 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.590
 the collimator will give the rifle 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.570
 an immediate and clear appointment i 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.939
 large in this rifle are 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.340
 essentially the first is the group 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.740
 click is completely in plastic 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.259
 including guard and trigger but does 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.759
 exception the safety lever the strong one 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.560
 vibration that this was a produce 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.600
 during the shooting despite being air 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.390
 tablet and the football without 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.790
 rubber or plastic finish remaining a 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.590
 talk about the safe it unlike 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.060
 of other rifle models not all 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.719
 automatic insertion in the phase of 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.670
 loading 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:10.020
 but this is not so much a problem yes 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.890
 follow good safety rules 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.140
 during your session 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.450
 to be so compact and also very 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.950
 lightweight the junior hunter is really a lot 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.530
 precise on the distances for which it is 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.630
 designed to perform a test I am 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.990
 always entrusted a gamo 3 per 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.819
 28 with zoom up to 7 for 28 to one 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:29.890
 20 meters distance produced a 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:31.510
 excellent grouping on the five shots e 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.290
 I must admit that for a black burrell 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.930
 entry level 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.820
 the result is truly remarkable 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.470
 concluding the junior hunter range 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.120
 turns out to be a great choice for 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.890
 all those who intend to start 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.350
 shoot or introduce a minor child 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.180
 to the world of precision shooting 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:49.000
 obviously always with the supervision of 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.800
 an adult holding the ideal weapon does not 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.140
 only for children but also for women 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.630
 given its small size and a 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.100
 really reduced weight thanking 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.420
 the armory fiery dinner caper that me 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.160
