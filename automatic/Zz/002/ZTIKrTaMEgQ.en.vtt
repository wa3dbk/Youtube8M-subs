players it's obviously pretty impressive

when you enter you enter a tournament
room<00:00:25.830> I<00:00:25.920> mean<00:00:26.070> look<00:00:26.220> around

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
room I mean look around

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.529 
room I mean look around
there<00:00:26.820> is<00:00:26.960> 2500<00:00:27.960> players<00:00:28.199> I<00:00:28.410> think<00:00:29.300> you<00:00:30.300> can't

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
there is 2500 players I think you can't

there is 2500 players I think you can't
feel<00:00:30.840> kind<00:00:31.140> of<00:00:31.230> small<00:00:31.500> I<00:00:31.529> guess<00:00:31.740> when<00:00:32.160> first

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
feel kind of small I guess when first

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.490 
feel kind of small I guess when first
entering<00:00:32.610> such<00:00:33.030> a<00:00:33.059> big<00:00:33.270> tournament<00:00:33.570> room<00:00:33.809> but

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
entering such a big tournament room but

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.049 
entering such a big tournament room but
in<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.620> end<00:00:34.800> it's<00:00:34.920> actually<00:00:35.100> not<00:00:35.520> not<00:00:35.910> that

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
in the end it's actually not not that

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.729 
in the end it's actually not not that
much<00:00:36.210> different<00:00:36.600> less<00:00:37.050> playing<00:00:37.380> let's<00:00:37.590> say<00:00:37.710> a

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
much different less playing let's say a

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.139 
much different less playing let's say a
tournament<00:00:38.010> with<00:00:38.190> 60<00:00:38.489> players<00:00:38.730> because

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
tournament with 60 players because

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.930 
tournament with 60 players because
there's<00:00:39.870> always<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.260> certain<00:00:40.980> percentage<00:00:41.820> of

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
there's always a certain percentage of

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.240 
there's always a certain percentage of
players<00:00:42.180> paid<00:00:42.570> so<00:00:43.020> in<00:00:43.170> I<00:00:43.379> mean<00:00:43.649> obviously<00:00:44.100> it's

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
players paid so in I mean obviously it's

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.720 
players paid so in I mean obviously it's
harder<00:00:44.520> to<00:00:44.640> win<00:00:44.850> but<00:00:45.840> in<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.410> end<00:00:46.530> min<00:00:47.309> cashing

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
harder to win but in the end min cashing

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.569 
harder to win but in the end min cashing
is<00:00:47.879> actually<00:00:48.390> let's<00:00:48.780> say<00:00:49.010> it's<00:00:50.010> it's<00:00:50.219> you<00:00:50.460> have

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
is actually let's say it's it's you have

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.069 
is actually let's say it's it's you have
the<00:00:50.700> same<00:00:50.879> chance<00:00:51.149> of<00:00:51.300> min<00:00:51.510> cashing<00:00:51.899> for

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
the same chance of min cashing for

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.270 
the same chance of min cashing for
instance<00:00:52.410> which<00:00:52.530> is<00:00:52.620> already<00:00:52.800> pretty<00:00:53.039> nice

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
instance which is already pretty nice

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.160 
instance which is already pretty nice
seeing<00:00:54.149> how<00:00:54.210> many<00:00:54.270> people<00:00:54.449> qualify<00:00:55.110> for

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
seeing how many people qualify for

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.639 
seeing how many people qualify for
events<00:00:55.559> like<00:00:55.739> this<00:00:56.570> so<00:00:57.570> I'd<00:00:57.690> say<00:00:57.930> try<00:00:58.289> not<00:00:58.530> to

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
events like this so I'd say try not to

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.619 
events like this so I'd say try not to
be<00:00:58.770> too<00:00:58.800> impressed<00:00:59.250> you<00:01:00.120> don't<00:01:00.270> have<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.480> beat

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
be too impressed you don't have to beat

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.720 
be too impressed you don't have to beat
everyone<00:01:01.050> people<00:01:01.710> are<00:01:01.800> busting<00:01:02.460> each<00:01:02.550> other

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
everyone people are busting each other

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.929 
everyone people are busting each other
out<00:01:02.940> so<00:01:02.969> that<00:01:03.930> helps<00:01:04.290> and<00:01:04.500> just<00:01:05.430> try<00:01:05.700> to<00:01:05.729> play

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
out so that helps and just try to play

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.980 
out so that helps and just try to play
your<00:01:06.090> game<00:01:07.130> try<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.189> stay<00:01:08.490> relaxed<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:09.299> don't

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
your game try to stay relaxed and don't

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.570 
your game try to stay relaxed and don't
rush<00:01:10.290> things<00:01:10.590> there's<00:01:10.860> five<00:01:11.070> days<00:01:11.340> there's

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
rush things there's five days there's

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.000 
rush things there's five days there's
maybe<00:01:12.060> six<00:01:12.330> days<00:01:12.390> I<00:01:12.630> think<00:01:12.689> in<00:01:12.930> this<00:01:13.049> event<00:01:13.320> in

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
maybe six days I think in this event in

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.499 
maybe six days I think in this event in
the<00:01:14.340> end<00:01:14.460> you<00:01:14.580> just<00:01:14.610> have<00:01:14.790> to<00:01:14.970> be<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.150> last<00:01:15.330> man

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
the end you just have to be the last man

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.840 
the end you just have to be the last man
standing<00:01:16.070> with<00:01:17.070> all<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.310> chips<00:01:17.549> you<00:01:17.640> don't

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
standing with all the chips you don't

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.969 
standing with all the chips you don't
have<00:01:17.939> to<00:01:18.060> win<00:01:18.180> them<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.330> first<00:01:18.540> day<00:01:18.650> is<00:01:19.650> it<00:01:19.920> a

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
have to win them the first day is it a

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.620 
have to win them the first day is it a
factor<00:01:20.430> that<00:01:20.640> you<00:01:20.729> have<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:20.939> play<00:01:21.119> in<00:01:21.210> multiple

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
factor that you have to play in multiple

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.450 
factor that you have to play in multiple
days<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:22.110> how<00:01:22.229> does<00:01:22.290> that<00:01:22.500> influence<00:01:22.979> your

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
days and how does that influence your

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.039 
days and how does that influence your
decisions<00:01:23.850> I<00:01:24.590> just<00:01:25.590> take<00:01:25.740> things<00:01:26.040> I<00:01:26.939> just<00:01:27.540> take

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
decisions I just take things I just take

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.950 
decisions I just take things I just take
things<00:01:28.259> at<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.470> moment<00:01:28.799> I<00:01:28.860> guess<00:01:29.960> some

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
things at the moment I guess some

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.190 
things at the moment I guess some
players<00:01:31.290> set<00:01:32.070> up<00:01:32.189> goals<00:01:32.600> every<00:01:33.600> for<00:01:33.780> every<00:01:33.810> day

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
players set up goals every for every day

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.380 
players set up goals every for every day
let's<00:01:34.409> say<00:01:34.470> they<00:01:35.369> want<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.670> end<00:01:35.759> this<00:01:35.939> day<00:01:36.180> with

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
let's say they want to end this day with

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.240 
let's say they want to end this day with
200k<00:01:36.960> in<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.140> next<00:01:37.350> day<00:01:37.439> with<00:01:37.560> 500k<00:01:38.100> but

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
200k in the next day with 500k but

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.440 
200k in the next day with 500k but
that's<00:01:38.369> not<00:01:38.549> that's<00:01:38.970> not<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.299> way<00:01:39.390> things

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
that's not that's not the way things

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.330 
that's not that's not the way things
