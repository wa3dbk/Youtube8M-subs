character on our sapphire we use the guy

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.999 
character on our sapphire we use the guy
and<00:01:20.640> if<00:01:21.630> you<00:01:21.840> don't<00:01:22.259> know<00:01:22.409> what<00:01:22.530> Masuda<00:01:22.979> method

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
and if you don't know what Masuda method

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.580 
and if you don't know what Masuda method
is<00:01:23.520> that<00:01:24.000> is<00:01:24.330> basically<00:01:24.659> taking<00:01:25.110> two

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
is that is basically taking two

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.590 
is that is basically taking two
different<00:01:25.920> pokemon<00:01:26.040> from<00:01:26.610> two<00:01:27.390> different

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
different pokemon from two different

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.810 
different pokemon from two different
regions<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:28.350> throwing<00:01:29.310> them<00:01:29.340> into<00:01:29.579> your

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
regions and throwing them into your

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.569 
regions and throwing them into your
breeding<00:01:30.060> place<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.689> uh<00:01:31.100> finding<00:01:32.100> some<00:01:32.310> eggs

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
breeding place and uh finding some eggs

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.580 
breeding place and uh finding some eggs
so<00:01:33.090> that<00:01:33.299> could<00:01:33.750> be<00:01:33.780> a<00:01:33.840> poke<00:01:34.049> one<00:01:34.259> from<00:01:34.439> your

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
so that could be a poke one from your

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.700 
so that could be a poke one from your
region<00:01:34.740> so<00:01:35.189> it<00:01:35.340> could<00:01:35.490> be<00:01:35.520> like<00:01:36.290> I'm<00:01:37.290> assuming

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
region so it could be like I'm assuming

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:38.719 
region so it could be like I'm assuming
you<00:01:37.770> probably<00:01:37.860> I'd<00:01:38.100> like<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.310> English<00:01:38.430> or

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
you probably I'd like the English or

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.730 
you probably I'd like the English or
Spanish<00:01:38.790> version<00:01:39.420> one<00:01:39.540> of<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.659> two<00:01:39.810> so<00:01:40.290> that

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
Spanish version one of the two so that

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.620 
Spanish version one of the two so that
one<00:01:41.130> with<00:01:41.430> like<00:01:41.640> a<00:01:41.700> Japanese<00:01:42.270> ditto<00:01:42.540> for

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
one with like a Japanese ditto for

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.679 
one with like a Japanese ditto for
example<00:01:43.259> or<00:01:43.439> you<00:01:43.560> could<00:01:43.710> have<00:01:43.829> like<00:01:44.040> it<00:01:44.189> a

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:44.689 
example or you could have like it a

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:48.830 
example or you could have like it a
German<00:01:45.689> murkrow<00:01:46.259> with<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:47.450> Japanese<00:01:48.450> murkrow

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
German murkrow with a Japanese murkrow

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:49.969 
German murkrow with a Japanese murkrow
it<00:01:48.930> doesn't<00:01:49.110> really<00:01:49.200> matter<00:01:49.409> as<00:01:49.619> long<00:01:49.649> as<00:01:49.890> are

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
it doesn't really matter as long as are

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.090 
it doesn't really matter as long as are
two<00:01:50.189> different<00:01:50.490> regions<00:01:51.409> pretty<00:01:52.409> easy<00:01:52.560> and

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
two different regions pretty easy and

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.429 
two different regions pretty easy and
we're<00:01:54.090> also<00:01:54.210> using<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.540> shiny<00:01:54.840> charm<00:01:55.229> so

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
we're also using the shiny charm so

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.530 
we're also using the shiny charm so
that's<00:01:55.590> gonna<00:01:55.770> hopefully<00:01:56.579> increase<00:01:57.299> our

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
that's gonna hopefully increase our

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.270 
that's gonna hopefully increase our
chance<00:01:57.840> of<00:01:57.990> getting<00:01:58.259> a<00:01:58.320> shiny<00:01:58.649> I'm<00:01:58.829> not<00:01:59.100> sure

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
chance of getting a shiny I'm not sure

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.310 
chance of getting a shiny I'm not sure
if<00:01:59.369> that<00:01:59.399> works<00:01:59.640> with<00:01:59.880> Masuda<00:02:00.390> method<00:02:00.420> but<00:02:01.200> I'm

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
if that works with Masuda method but I'm

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.740 
if that works with Masuda method but I'm
pretty<00:02:01.530> sure<00:02:01.649> it<00:02:01.890> does<00:02:02.509> otherwise<00:02:03.509> I<00:02:03.630> don't

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
pretty sure it does otherwise I don't

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.060 
pretty sure it does otherwise I don't
think<00:02:03.899> we've<00:02:04.079> got<00:02:04.110> a<00:02:04.229> ponyta<00:02:05.009> on

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
think we've got a ponyta on

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.969 
think we've got a ponyta on
forty-something<00:02:05.850> last<00:02:06.270> time<00:02:06.479> but<00:02:06.860> let's<00:02:07.860> go

defense and down special attack careful

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:33.550 
defense and down special attack careful
nature<00:03:31.209> so<00:03:32.209> we<00:03:32.389> have<00:03:32.569> a<00:03:32.599> great<00:03:33.079> ivy<00:03:33.530> and

takes that away from us so we kind of

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:43.899 
takes that away from us so we kind of
got<00:03:41.389> a<00:03:41.449> trollee<00:03:42.159> murkrow<00:03:43.159> but<00:03:43.340> that's<00:03:43.489> okay

luck<00:03:49.280> I<00:03:49.489> personally<00:03:49.970> think<00:03:50.269> probably<00:03:50.599> would

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
luck I personally think probably would

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.339 
luck I personally think probably would
have<00:03:50.900> been<00:03:50.989> better<00:03:51.349> for<00:03:52.099> murkrow<00:03:52.930> but<00:03:53.930> I<00:03:54.199> mean

00:03:54.339 --> 00:03:54.349 
have been better for murkrow but I mean

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:57.460 
have been better for murkrow but I mean
I<00:03:54.379> guess<00:03:54.500> if<00:03:54.859> you're<00:03:55.069> a<00:03:55.810> up<00:03:56.810> against<00:03:57.199> like<00:03:57.439> a

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
I guess if you're a up against like a

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.770 
I guess if you're a up against like a
breloom<00:03:58.250> or<00:03:58.459> something<00:03:58.879> that's<00:03:58.970> gonna<00:03:59.150> spoil

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
breloom or something that's gonna spoil

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.510 
breloom or something that's gonna spoil
your<00:03:59.930> team<00:04:00.169> or

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:01.520 
your team or

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.120

a<00:04:01.580> little<00:04:02.390> snot<00:04:02.870> smeargle<00:04:03.440> then<00:04:03.800> I<00:04:03.830> guess

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.130 
a little snot smeargle then I guess

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:07.900 
a little snot smeargle then I guess
