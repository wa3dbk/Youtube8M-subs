00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 hello to you Artem in this video I 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.790
 tell you about a rather unusual 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.740
 jailbreak tweaks ff 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.740
 it allows you to take a fresh look at 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.750
 multitasking in with 8 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.799
 after installing the extension at startup 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.630
 any application 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.930
 you will have it round 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.430
 desktop icon 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.990
 This icon can be dragged to a convenient 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.140
 you place besides this it will be 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.539
 translucent in a split second why 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.340
 She needs you ask and then to 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.050
 another application could be quickly 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.420
 open any program that you have 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.910
 already running and do it without a panel 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.739
 multitasking as you can see the icon 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.570
 move to a convenient place and without 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.570
 problems switch between each 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.710
 the program is in the background 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.050
 when will you switch between 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.280
 applications in this way they will 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.610
 not open full screen 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.050
 but as if over the previous program 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.850
 it seems that you opened 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.300
 window to do something quickly and 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.430
 returned back previous application 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.000
 idea rather curious implementation on 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.370
 the top five 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.439
 problems and glitches peak is not noticed 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.080
 the animation is almost smooth and not 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.150
 causes complaints in tweak settings you 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.310
 You can choose which applications it does not 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.830
 will run besides this there 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.299
 ability to enable or disable 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.610
 gesture extension action 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.080
 activator for example you can shake 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.950
 device to activate 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.030
 mkhat or press home three times 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.860
 of course you can choose any 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.650
 an interesting gesture or action 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.299
 by the way how do you understand tvik displays icons 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.110
 all applications that are in 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.000
 background 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.070
 if you complete the program from the panel 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.259
 multitasking and and the icon will disappear with 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.040
 desktop 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:40.590
 separate settings block allows 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.750
 select background when opening 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.430
 apps using tweak and can 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.570
 perform previous running 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:50.070
 application or desktop wallpaper 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.560
 running program icons can 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.939
 appearing in any place also 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.219
 it is possible to disable them 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.700
 dragging after that they will 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.960
 attached to any of the edges of the screen 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.509
 the authors have reasonably foreseen the possibility 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.939
 disabling action from the century on 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.500
 standard mail application because 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.569
 she is almost always in 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.310
 background and its icon has always been 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.660
 would be in sight 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.420
 it is also possible to enable or 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.470
 turn off day 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.640
 from on the locked device screen 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.410
 agree very conveniently quickly 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.380
 open the application syllable screen and 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.880
 make a series of actions you need 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.599
 also to eliminate graphic glitches 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.340
 and bugs 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:29.260
 separate option from the century allow 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.440
 turn it off during playback 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.600
 video as a small bonus can 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.120
 configure the action to click and 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.519
 hold each application icon 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:42.030
 very convenient for example to enable closing 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:43.959
 programs while holding its shortcut 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.790
 this way you can not only 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:49.780
 quickly switch between running 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:52.680
 applications well and complete them perfectly 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.910
 Looks around and on the screen ipad 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.650
 further development of the peak would be desirable 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.870
 see the ability to resize 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.299
 windows running program and course 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.940
 run two applications at the same time 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:06.040
 it would be a powerful answer in competing 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.890
 platforms and truly real 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.530
 multitasking buy jailbreak tweak 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:14.650
 traversal can be standard repository sit 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.250
 big boss for a hefty sum of 4 dollars 99 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.319
 cents 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.299
 do not forget to share your opinion 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:20.769
 the answer under the video add video you 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:23.530
 elected as well as subscribe to the channel 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:26.040
 Artem was with you especially for apples 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.040
 until
