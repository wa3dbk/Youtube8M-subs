00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.809
 the boom doctor was managed there this is 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:13.380
 probably turn snid yeah yeah 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.040
 this is again the only way to 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.359
 handle this need 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:20.300
 it's pretty years for the only one 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.830
 best way is or sylvanas 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:26.730
 sylvanas it's boring versus signed 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.380
 dolce raider wacey manas as he did 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.420
 no silence it's useless to siphon 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.440
 put on five sets so he goes out 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:38.309
 sylvanas and he chooses to go out 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:41.390
 bichon also there is a real choice and 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.390
 he'll do it he'll do it 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:51.199
 it's not bad huh is not bad in 

00:00:49.999 --> 00:00:52.269
 night who start working the 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:54.409
 pvd coop 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:57.079
 there is more silence for the 

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:59.299
 drake you see so the drake is a very 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:01.570
 good option at this turn there and behind the 

00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:01.570
 drake 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:08.060
 they hesitate the cap 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.950
 well, it's either the author but 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.900
 the hotel the carpet that makes it is done 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:20.600
 open by snildal shredder you see 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:22.040
 the hotel weary and it's a little hot it 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.360
 soul syphon actually is justified because 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.210
 that he has 2 you see in his hand or 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:30.590
 so there is anti they vote yes who 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:32.119
 will be destroyed by the drake but the sni 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.710
 of snit it's really a card that 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:35.750
 can overthrow parts she is 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.539
 extremely random she is very 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.340
 strong in control versus good control the 

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:43.340
 worse it's obviously when snid pop 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.050
 kel'thuzad slats and disgusted because 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.399
 it resuscitates snit I do not know if you have 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.770
 already seen 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:50.810
 well yeah yeah that's jesus that's it 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.700
 the legendary if they located on 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:56.899
 some usa of his daughters the party and 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:59.000
 to finish is precisely what he has when 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:59.840
 even very good options with cellou 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.729
 Yeah yeah 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.360
 totem who will be able to pose his phlegm falls 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:06.319
 of themes that could pose behind 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.119
 in fact he cpie 

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:10.750
 there is zone damage in phase life 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:14.720
 to their lille idol who is going little 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:18.379
 confidential of 1 of hellfire 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:20.150
 that's what he's really 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:22.430
 providential nature face there are ten 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.260
 points of damage is what the shaman to 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.660
 a sufficient bear oh that can be 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:31.470
 lethal or so they hesitate at the table and 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:34.910
 he's not going to tap is there 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:38.040
 and talk about the boom doctor is random 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:40.290
 but I'm not even talking about this need 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.680
 can that can reverse the game so in 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:46.530
 one who finds death wing is the title 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:48.600
 who finds a blouse these songs the wall 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.150
 lot the legendary murlocs frankly this 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.410
 turn it is difficult for me it's 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.440
 either the wolves or the theme languages ​​of 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.790
 fire because it happened is that he 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.160
 may be oil in front for damon 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.380
 see it a lot in time and what they have 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.910
 but none of the two nil and 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:11.200
 the totem totem tongues of fire have 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:13.810
 maybe not the theme nothing at all ok 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.160
 ok no it's not con it's not stupid 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.750
 all he wanted to ratu area damage 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.730
 exactly and the fear of hellfire ah 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.400
 yeah that's good I see it's 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:24.030
 intelligent unfortunately alas alas alas alas 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:30.550
 alas alas the legendary talent 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:33.340
 ok it's soft and I mean dumb 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:38.980
 yeah that's his failure do not go 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:43.840
 trigger these mouais but there this pv 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:48.870
 still it's less interesting 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:52.269
 he's going he'll kill an interesting little 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:54.400
 let's see what the snid the way sli dole 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:58.110
 trader goes garbage 8 August did it or 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:01.690
 so ancient he boot and the wolves 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:05.200
 antique he boot totem lou looks to me not 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:06.579
 badly and it happened we will call us 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:22.000
 let's sleep pose problem an opponent 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:23.150
 expectations so much so we'll explain in 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.340
 made 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:29.490
 well that's the duo actually he's going to do 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:35.570
 people at 11,11 toussaint that's it and if 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:35.570
 he does not have two ex impute a crazy thing 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.630
 finally 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:43.200
 but fortunately he has a flaw of 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:46.290
 gerard wey because he goes bgh to mesa 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:48.630
 Limoges beats damage but it cost 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:59.910
 a lot a lot of cards actually 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:05:01.440
 did you see that yeah and then fucking ah 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:03.000
 so what is not a morning for us 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.360
 say the percentage of chance to have this 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.360
 combo 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.590
 m
