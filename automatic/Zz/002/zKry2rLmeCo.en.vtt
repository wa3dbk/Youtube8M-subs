00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.140
 symbol of the return to jaguar business 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:17.500
 since its acquisition by the Indian giant 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.210
 auntie 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.800
 the new coupe she size is doing her 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:22.690
 Entered the scene one year after the beginnings 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.750
 sulphurous of its discoverable counterpart 

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:27.850
 more rigid more agile brief sportier 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.590
 the tapas cutter for ambition to come 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:32.920
 shake up the hierarchy of the sports coupe 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:35.260
 from less than one hundred thousand euros to 81 1400 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.059
 euros our version v6 that of 380 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.909
 horses is positioned between the model of 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:42.190
 base 340 horses displayed 60,000 

00:00:39.909 --> 00:00:44.499
 800 euros and extravagance version r 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.749
 culminating at 550 horses and 106 1000 

00:00:44.499 --> 00:00:48.399
 euros compared to the basic model the 

00:00:46.749 --> 00:00:50.829
 v6 is series of a piloted suspension 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:52.629
 an active sports brake exhaust 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:55.359
 high performance self-locking 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:57.850
 mechanical and gender of 19 inches are 

00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:59.170
 0 to 100km advanced ray in 4 seconds 9 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.749
 while its top speed 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:04.260
 electronically limited to 2 175 

00:01:01.749 --> 00:01:04.260
 kilometers / hour 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.400
 you have to install aboard this coupe ft 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.170
 I must say that we are also very 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.330
 comfortable a bit like in a blow tale 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.430
 orders fall well under the hand 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.590
 even if the ergonomics are sometimes a little 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.570
 wacky but the driving position 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.930
 is excellent the finish of good 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.430
 bill short we get for his money 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.250
 and then there is this outside line 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.680
 sumptuous particularly elegant in 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.880
 this English green 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.240
 undeniably we are dealing is a 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:36.100
 true star meuse this says the 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.400
 German competition is rough I think 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:42.640
 especially at the 911 porsche the bmw n 4 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:44.830
 audi rs5 and it will take more than 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.420
 simple charm this cut off ft to do the 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.680
 difference 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.080
 we came to the walloon Brabant 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.030
 to check his temperament on 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.870
 little roads and believe me you 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.870
 do not be disappointed 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.810
 1 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.190
 real sensations machine no 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.080
 doubt this cut is hype is much more 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.519
 that a simple charm on small 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.830
 country roads it provides a pleasure 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:26.140
 rough driving with this sound 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.909
 intoxicating a great agility a train 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.769
 incisive front and a perfect balance 

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:30.790
 that are completely forgotten left 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:32.860
 100 kg of the beast 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.269
 the eight-speed zf box snaps 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.650
 the reports the double output 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:37.150
 central exhaust crackle at 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.370
 each lift foot and the rear axle 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.510
 willingly to shirk through 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.340
 the mechanical self- locking 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.110
 as for the three liters supercharged it 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.299
 could happily up to 7000 laps 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.030
 minute before landing on a breaker 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:51.370
 worthy of the name guaranteed ambience and 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.890
 even though his torque of 468 m and 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.140
 relatively high perched at 3500 minutes 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.150
 the raises remain satisfactory thanks 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.940
 to an excellent staging of the unit and 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.859
 daf if we compare it to the cabriolets the 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.200
 cut the outclasses briskly his 

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:07.180
 torsional stiffness up 80% 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.010
 feels clearly behind the wheel with a 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.720
 roll virtually nonexistent adhesion 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.060
 impressive and a natural talent 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.349
 in the support changes this coupe 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.000
 really only needs to be 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:17.790
 to whip and he is very fast 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.720
 unsustainable to resist temptation 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.519
 so obviously the painting is not 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.410
 all rose to start with the suspension 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:25.930
 piloted which is relatively firm 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:28.750
 even in normal mode the direction certainly 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:31.329
 precise lack of feedback the list 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.620
 options and worthy of at porsche and the 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:35.769
 GPS is not what we could 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:38.019
 qualify the most competent in terms of 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:40.359
 performance with a 0 to 100 announced in 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:41.919
 4 seconds new for this version v6 s 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:44.500
 and finally have nothing 

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:46.329
 extraordinary because a bmw m4 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.819
 claims only four seconds on 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:50.019
 the same exercise 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:51.669
 in the end, however, 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:54.400
 relativize these defects in the set 

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:56.139
 turns out seductive not this cut ff is 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.609
 not perfect and will probably not compete 

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:58.450
 not with a probe in matters of 

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:00.400
 pure performance 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.900
 on the other hand and unlike the 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.849
 most of his German competitors 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.079
 it provides real sensations without 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:05.950
 to be pushed into his 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:08.560
 last entrenchments 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:10.750
 thanks to the incomparable field of his v6 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.060
 a frame set to the little onions and 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.560
 a charisma of which he alone has the secret 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.019
 coupe ft offers an experience of 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.910
 spicy driving by offering a coupe 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:19.570
 Charismatic sportsman is relatively 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.160
 affordable 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.560
 Jaguar therefore offers an alternative 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.419
 serious to his German rivals and 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.950
 brings a significant breath of fresh air 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:28.650
 in the 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:31.790
 gori for a first attempt one can 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.790
 to say that the bet is successful 

00:04:39.809 --> 00:04:42.809
