00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:07.080
 my friends this is a news channel 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.929
 important cellular video games and 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.360
 very relevant things but let's move on 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.610
 then to the next topic that I believe 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.400
 that we are all very surprised 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:21.859
 special already written from chile from 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:30.619
 here to the people what's up 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:34.230
 the macro no more no more presented 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:36.329
 beyond the party when they named 4k that 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.210
 already a tremendous evolution to be able to edit 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.590
 4k videos 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:43.050
 many of which we edit video 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.680
 we are hoping that it is always 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.680
 updated 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:56.440
 excellent because let's say the go pro 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:58.739
 scale to the latest version and edit it 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.359
 really impossible he never appreciated me 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:04.449
 totally the definition I think it is 

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:06.909
 a movement that goes to 4k to jose and mario 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.170
 that also not quiet what I 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:09.580
 I have never had the opportunity to avoid 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.300
 with that 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.830
 but if you were looking for me that right now 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.410
 what are you talking about in the background 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:22.200
 example and had a macbook pro of 13 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:24.730
 inches and I have 8 gigs of ram I have 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.560
 750 euros and I was completely in 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:29.590
 mind zero in terms of memory offense 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.940
 everything here but everything happened to a disc 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.730
 external but the problem is that with the 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.110
 other days of spillage is short and the 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:36.820
 I 'm really locked by the machine 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.260
 look for something powerful especially those 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.610
 who make video constantly as 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.470
 what we do is practically a 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.229
 daily video diary then 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.060
 work with something in the background has that 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.880
 power to work with windows 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.050
 of several open entries and that do not 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.910
 It's good for the machine 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.620
 constantly until it freezes or 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.750
 touch wait or have the wheel 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:57.910
 constantly colors the time of the 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.470
 you need something powerful other powerful 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.780
 to work and anyway this 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:04.070
 computer could be an extra 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.380
 let's say it like that 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:09.020
 as you tempt me you keep to that one 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.390
 Once the market comes out, we can have the 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:14.290
 opportunity to buy it was not reflected 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.290
 also a little high 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.560
 in general 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.720
 but more focused for people who 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.340
 they do video editing and editors in the 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.620
 demonstration video there I had people 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.270
 working on what are videos and 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.150
 trust and take Sunday because for him 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:31.550
 it's something spectacular now to mario and to 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:35.570
 Martian what do you think the size from 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:36.890
 this new macro the design as how 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:40.310
 are you say in the design is 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:44.660
 surprising everything the same surprises a lot 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:46.220
 but is it say I do not know if 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.930
 to see well because I was not seeing 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.360
 but he says it 's super but super 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.580
 small we have to see the 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.920
 true specifications and but 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:59.170
 homework is a type of computer that does not 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:02.140
 is for the normal user or even for 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:04.599
 depends not only on the one who goes up 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.720
 video because it's like it's a lot 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:10.000
 power as I asked john that 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.040
 he does with his because I like him 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.770
 I believe in this one that I have I have power 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.380
 also for YouTube videos it would be 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:22.100
 since the iron has danced 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:24.950
 not in this in this degree I have 32 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:27.500
 the friend of this is a news channel 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:32.230
 important cellular video games and 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.230
 very relevant things of the angels
