00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:19.290 
like a Leica I couldn't figure out which

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:23.110 
like a Leica I couldn't figure out which
one<00:00:19.500> I<00:00:19.530> wanted<00:00:19.950> either<00:00:20.100> this<00:00:20.460> billingham<00:00:21.120> pro

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:23.120 
one I wanted either this billingham pro

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:30.590 
one I wanted either this billingham pro
in<00:00:24.120> tan<00:00:24.510> and<00:00:24.810> then<00:00:25.440> also<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:26.540> new<00:00:27.830> ona<00:00:28.830> bag<00:00:29.600> the

in tan and then also the new ona bag the
I<00:00:31.110> believe<00:00:31.590> it's<00:00:31.770> called<00:00:32.129> the<00:00:32.309> Union<00:00:32.700> Street

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:35.089 

00:00:35.089 --> 00:00:38.139 

the<00:00:36.089> comparison<00:00:36.719> of<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.960> two<00:00:36.989> in<00:00:37.350> size<00:00:37.679> you

00:00:38.139 --> 00:00:38.149 
the comparison of the two in size you

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:42.049 
the comparison of the two in size you
can<00:00:39.149> kind<00:00:39.390> of<00:00:39.449> see<00:00:39.739> let<00:00:40.739> me<00:00:40.800> get<00:00:40.980> it<00:00:41.100> here<00:00:41.850> so

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
can kind of see let me get it here so

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.270 
can kind of see let me get it here so
you<00:00:42.149> can<00:00:42.329> see<00:00:42.600> obviously<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.260> ona<00:00:43.710> is<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:43.859> sleek

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
you can see obviously the ona is a sleek

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:54.020 
you can see obviously the ona is a sleek
slightly<00:00:44.839> larger<00:00:45.839> bag<00:00:52.370> however<00:00:53.370> both<00:00:53.609> of<00:00:53.670> them

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
slightly larger bag however both of them

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:04.620 
slightly larger bag however both of them
are<00:00:54.239> very<00:00:54.510> thin<00:00:55.199> on<00:00:55.229> the<00:00:55.499> sides

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:04.630 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:09.490 

as<00:01:05.630> far<00:01:05.810> as<00:01:05.840> internal<00:01:06.730> space<00:01:07.870> the<00:01:08.870> ona

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
as far as internal space the ona

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.680 
as far as internal space the ona
definitely<00:01:10.010> takes<00:01:10.280> the<00:01:10.430> cake<00:01:10.580> with<00:01:11.060> the

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:11.690 
definitely takes the cake with the

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.670 
definitely takes the cake with the
Billingham<00:01:12.140> being<00:01:12.380> a<00:01:12.620> bit<00:01:13.070> smaller<00:01:13.490> than<00:01:13.820> it

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:14.680 
Billingham being a bit smaller than it

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.750 
Billingham being a bit smaller than it
they<00:01:15.680> both<00:01:15.890> feel<00:01:16.130> like<00:01:16.310> they're<00:01:16.490> made<00:01:16.610> out<00:01:16.670> of

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:16.760 
they both feel like they're made out of

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.330 
they both feel like they're made out of
fairly<00:01:17.150> quality<00:01:17.630> material<00:01:18.140> the<00:01:18.980> leather<00:01:19.220> is

fairly quality material the leather is
very<00:01:19.550> nice<00:01:19.970> around<00:01:20.330> the<00:01:20.420> edges<00:01:20.750> here<00:01:22.000> it's

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
very nice around the edges here it's

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.120 
very nice around the edges here it's
nice<00:01:23.300> I<00:01:23.690> will<00:01:24.110> say<00:01:24.320> that<00:01:24.530> the<00:01:24.650> leather<00:01:24.860> on<00:01:24.950> the

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
nice I will say that the leather on the

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:30.070 
nice I will say that the leather on the
Billingham<00:01:25.550> is<00:01:25.670> much<00:01:28.420> more<00:01:29.420> luxurious<00:01:29.600> than

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 
Billingham is much more luxurious than

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
camera inside of the Billingham so you

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.150 
camera inside of the Billingham so you
can<00:02:29.120> see<00:02:29.299> how<00:02:29.420> things<00:02:29.660> kind<00:02:29.870> of<00:02:29.989> fit<00:02:30.230> I've<00:02:30.980> got

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:07.750 
of between the two layers of canvas so
this<00:06:06.560> is<00:06:06.710> definitely<00:06:06.890> going<00:06:07.250> to<00:06:07.280> survive<00:06:07.730> a

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:07.760

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:46.410 
a little bit smaller than that I would

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:49.159 
a little bit smaller than that I would
probably<00:07:46.590> prefer<00:07:47.360> tell<00:07:48.360> you<00:07:48.450> the<00:07:48.570> truth<00:07:48.780> the

lighter<00:07:52.740> like<00:07:53.310> looser<00:07:53.850> weave<00:07:54.030> feels<00:07:54.510> even

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:54.720 
lighter like looser weave feels even

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:57.020 
lighter like looser weave feels even
better<00:07:54.990> on<00:07:55.260> your<00:07:55.410> shoulder<00:07:55.770> than<00:07:55.979> one<00:07:56.729> with<00:07:57.000> a

00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:57.030
