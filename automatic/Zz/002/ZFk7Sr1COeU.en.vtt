like the polities and you know you have
the<00:01:39.390> budget<00:01:39.720> hey<00:01:39.930> I<00:01:40.290> guess<00:01:40.770> you're<00:01:40.950> ready<00:01:41.130> to

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.539 
the budget hey I guess you're ready to
go<00:01:42.170> but<00:01:43.170> honestly<00:01:43.470> it's<00:01:43.890> been<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:44.100> very<00:01:44.310> great

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
go but honestly it's been a very great

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.850 
go but honestly it's been a very great
camera<00:01:44.939> for<00:01:44.970> me<00:01:45.299> I've<00:01:46.079> messed<00:01:46.350> with<00:01:46.439> a<00:01:46.560> lot<00:01:46.740> of

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
camera for me I've messed with a lot of

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.230 
camera for me I've messed with a lot of
different<00:01:47.130> cameras<00:01:47.460> and<00:01:47.640> I<00:01:47.759> didn't<00:01:48.000> like<00:01:48.119> the

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
different cameras and I didn't like the

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.389 
different cameras and I didn't like the
onboard<00:01:48.600> audio<00:01:48.750> this<00:01:49.290> one<00:01:49.530> actually<00:01:49.799> has<00:01:50.100> it

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
onboard audio this one actually has it

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.340 
onboard audio this one actually has it
so<00:01:50.549> you<00:01:50.610> can<00:01:50.820> actually<00:01:51.119> input<00:01:51.270> your<00:01:52.200> own

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
so you can actually input your own

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.990 
so you can actually input your own
microphone<00:01:52.560> which<00:01:53.009> is<00:01:53.040> actually<00:01:53.369> nice<00:01:53.520> not<00:01:53.970> a

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
microphone which is actually nice not a

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.580 
microphone which is actually nice not a
lot<00:01:54.360> of<00:01:54.479> cameras<00:01:54.840> actually<00:01:54.960> support<00:01:55.409> that

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
lot of cameras actually support that

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.350 
lot of cameras actually support that
unless<00:01:55.770> I<00:01:55.890> like<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.159> higher<00:01:56.340> end<00:01:56.610> cameras<00:01:56.969> so

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
unless I like the higher end cameras so

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.510 
unless I like the higher end cameras so
that<00:01:57.390> said<00:01:57.689> again<00:01:58.140> don't<00:01:58.380> be<00:01:58.469> discouraged<00:01:58.920> if

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
that said again don't be discouraged if

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.069 
that said again don't be discouraged if
you<00:01:59.670> you<00:01:59.969> know<00:02:00.060> can't<00:02:00.360> afford<00:02:00.540> this<00:02:00.719> or<00:02:00.899> you

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
I mean this computer I think that's all

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.340 
I mean this computer I think that's all
for<00:04:29.340> lighting<00:04:29.520> uh<00:04:29.880> what<00:04:30.240> is<00:04:30.330> this<00:04:30.480> I<00:04:30.720> don't

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
for lighting uh what is this I don't

that's<00:04:40.350> an<00:04:40.470> LS<00:04:40.770> but<00:04:41.220> yeah<00:04:41.490> I<00:04:41.820> really<00:04:42.120> don't

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
that's an LS but yeah I really don't

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:43.880 
that's an LS but yeah I really don't
know<00:04:42.390> as<00:04:42.510> far<00:04:42.540> as<00:04:42.690> lighting<00:04:42.960> like<00:04:43.170> what<00:04:43.440> brand

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:43.890 
know as far as lighting like what brand

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:45.290

was I apologize for that

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:46.970 
was I apologize for that
I<00:04:45.480> think<00:04:45.840> it's<00:04:45.930> top<00:04:46.200> lighting<00:04:46.590> but<00:04:46.740> then<00:04:46.860> the

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:46.980 
I think it's top lighting but then the

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:48.800 
I think it's top lighting but then the
other<00:04:47.100> one<00:04:47.220> says<00:04:47.370> LS<00:04:47.790> that<00:04:48.240> doesn't<00:04:48.660> really

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810 
other one says LS that doesn't really

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:49.910 
other one says LS that doesn't really
stand<00:04:49.020> for<00:04:49.140> I<00:04:49.380> don't<00:04:49.440> know<00:04:49.530> what<00:04:49.590> it<00:04:49.770> stands

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:49.920 
stand for I don't know what it stands

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.740 
stand for I don't know what it stands

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 
for to be honest honestly I think the

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:52.430

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 
I mean you can't the computer is PI like

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.970 
I mean you can't the computer is PI like
more<00:05:03.000> than<00:05:03.180> yeah<00:05:03.630> I<00:05:03.660> mean<00:05:03.900> realistically<00:05:04.560> you

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:04.980 
more than yeah I mean realistically you

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:06.800 
more than yeah I mean realistically you
can<00:05:05.130> buy<00:05:05.310> a<00:05:05.640> like<00:05:05.910> a<00:05:05.940> hundred<00:05:06.270> dollar<00:05:06.420> video
