00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:05.339
 here our table is dry 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.280
 already passed a certain period 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.960
 time and that's why it is necessary 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.840
 there are always some 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.509
 roughness and there it can be 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.750
 breath lacquer these were air bubbles 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:21.660
 under the lacquer all this can be here 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.500
 we also have a soft flag here 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.689
 here's a spatula 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.430
 normal spar not sharp 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.060
 you need to specifically blunt the edges 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:33.120
 that he did not arrange was not there on it 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.579
 sharp no these same projections and we 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.790
 take doing a simple elementary thing 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.760
 we are here and so passes without pressing another 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.250
 for now notice the varnish only here 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.180
 the next dialogue is still soft he is already 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.860
 dry out 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.020
 everything but he still smells a little but he 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.230
 soft and here are such over neat 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:57.270
 movements we remove all these 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:59.730
 roughness for even notice how under 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:03.149
 hand all at once became much softer 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:06.060
 if you want to get you will be perfect 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.070
 surface yes then you need to protect 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.170
 Naturally skin here this entire varnish 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.840
 let him stand stand give him 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.090
 dry properly live dry 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.970
 at about 48 hours maybe 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:21.930
 more and then all this is to shuffle with 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.640
 chicken 240 can be 300 well 240 under 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.009
 a brush is usually enough 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:31.490
 under the sprayer who does that 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:33.869
 knows what you need there is about 600 skin 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:37.020
 it will be enough under the brush or basement 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:39.090
 200 40 site poskusit and cover second 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.100
 a layer of varnish and then you will get 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.430
 perfect mirror smooth surface 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:47.240
 but since I will not do this here 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.860
 I covered once more no longer want 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.850
 raise all these smells something like this here 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.040
 in such a way with spatulas 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.500
 I remove all these irregularities again 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:59.280
 only stress without pressure and all i 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.090
 I think you can do it thanks 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.890
 all for attention 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.330
 color to create and you will have everything 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.330
 get well
