00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.940 
very very bright when we were out here
taking<00:02:06.060> these<00:02:07.160> images<00:02:08.160> this<00:02:08.399> is<00:02:08.580> iso<00:02:08.940> 100<00:02:09.950> f9

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
taking these images this is iso 100 f9

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.840 
taking these images this is iso 100 f9
to<00:02:11.700> 50th<00:02:12.060> of<00:02:12.180> a<00:02:12.300> second

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
to 50th of a second

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.880 
to 50th of a second
um<00:02:13.770> so<00:02:14.770> it<00:02:15.220> was<00:02:15.480> it<00:02:16.480> was<00:02:16.660> fairly<00:02:16.960> bright<00:02:17.320> out<00:02:17.560> um

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
um so it was it was fairly bright out um

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:28.980 
um so it was it was fairly bright out um
and<00:02:19.920> used<00:02:20.920> to<00:02:24.360> bear<00:02:25.360> flashes<00:02:26.820> for<00:02:27.820> Maine<00:02:28.240> and<00:02:28.600> a

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
and used to bear flashes for Maine and a

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.080 
and used to bear flashes for Maine and a
little<00:02:29.200> bit<00:02:29.260> of<00:02:29.320> fill<00:02:29.590> here<00:02:29.860> on<00:02:30.130> the<00:02:30.670> right<00:02:30.880> so

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
little bit of fill here on the right so

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.520 
little bit of fill here on the right so
there's<00:02:31.300> just<00:02:31.450> a<00:02:31.510> little<00:02:31.750> slight<00:02:31.990> shadow<00:02:32.200> on

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
there's just a little slight shadow on

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.040 
there's just a little slight shadow on
the<00:02:32.590> nose<00:02:32.980> there<00:02:33.250> so<00:02:34.240> we're<00:02:34.810> going<00:02:34.900> to<00:02:35.020> go

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
the nose there so we're going to go

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.370 
the nose there so we're going to go
ahead<00:02:35.170> and<00:02:35.500> drag<00:02:35.740> again<00:02:36.130> we've<00:02:36.280> got<00:02:36.520> the

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
ahead and drag again we've got the

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.990 
ahead and drag again we've got the
gradient<00:02:38.380> blue<00:02:38.620> sky<00:02:38.890> media<00:02:39.310> from<00:02:39.760> the

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
gradient blue sky media from the

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.960 
gradient blue sky media from the
workflow<00:02:40.570> engine<00:02:40.600> version<00:02:41.170> 3<00:02:42.420> selected<00:02:43.740> and

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
workflow engine version 3 selected and

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.640 
workflow engine version 3 selected and
we're<00:02:45.970> just<00:02:46.090> going<00:02:46.180> to<00:02:46.300> drag<00:02:46.660> down<00:02:46.720> with<00:02:47.380> that

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
we're just going to drag down with that

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.880 
we're just going to drag down with that
and<00:02:48.510> then<00:02:49.510> I'm<00:02:49.780> just<00:02:49.870> going<00:02:50.140> to<00:02:50.200> tilt<00:02:50.530> it<00:02:50.800> a

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
and then I'm just going to tilt it a

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.410 
and then I'm just going to tilt it a
little<00:02:51.070> bit<00:02:51.250> once<00:02:51.460> i<00:02:51.580> have<00:02:51.760> it<00:02:51.790> dragged<00:02:52.150> down

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
little bit once i have it dragged down

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.570 
little bit once i have it dragged down
because<00:02:52.780> the<00:02:52.960> right-hand<00:02:53.470> side<00:02:53.590> of<00:02:54.010> the<00:02:54.250> sky

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
because the right-hand side of the sky

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.560 
because the right-hand side of the sky
camera<00:02:55.180> right<00:02:55.480> um<00:02:56.070> is<00:02:57.070> already<00:02:57.970> dark<00:02:58.240> enough

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
camera right um is already dark enough

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:59.910 
camera right um is already dark enough
so<00:02:58.810> i'm<00:02:58.960> just<00:02:58.990> going<00:02:59.260> to<00:02:59.320> tilt<00:02:59.530> it<00:02:59.710> a<00:02:59.800> little

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
so i'm just going to tilt it a little

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.250 
so i'm just going to tilt it a little
bit<00:03:00.130> hit<00:03:00.430> enter<00:03:00.730> and<00:03:00.970> then<00:03:01.030> you'll<00:03:01.990> notice

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
bit hit enter and then you'll notice

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.500 
bit hit enter and then you'll notice
over<00:03:02.350> here<00:03:02.500> still<00:03:02.920> kind<00:03:03.130> of<00:03:03.160> light<00:03:03.370> so<00:03:03.670> this<00:03:04.360> is

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
over here still kind of light so this is

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.280 
over here still kind of light so this is
just<00:03:04.630> a<00:03:04.810> new<00:03:04.990> pass<00:03:06.030> so<00:03:07.030> then<00:03:07.870> I'm<00:03:08.020> just<00:03:08.140> going

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
just a new pass so then I'm just going

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:15.090 
just a new pass so then I'm just going
to<00:03:08.350> come<00:03:08.590> across<00:03:08.710> again<00:03:12.960> maybe<00:03:13.960> like<00:03:14.230> that<00:03:14.500> hit

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
to come across again maybe like that hit

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:21.870 
to come across again maybe like that hit
enter<00:03:15.400> and<00:03:15.610> then<00:03:18.360> might<00:03:19.360> be<00:03:19.540> able<00:03:19.630> to<00:03:19.810> do<00:03:20.880> one

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
enter and then might be able to do one

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.280 
enter and then might be able to do one
more<00:03:22.090> pass<00:03:22.360> but<00:03:22.600> I'm<00:03:22.690> going<00:03:22.810> to<00:03:22.870> have<00:03:22.990> to<00:03:23.020> tone

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
more pass but I'm going to have to tone

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.230 
more pass but I'm going to have to tone
it<00:03:23.320> down<00:03:23.470> I<00:03:23.770> know<00:03:23.890> that<00:03:24.010> looks<00:03:24.370> crazy<00:03:24.670> so<00:03:25.000> just

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:25.240

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
me um another gradient filter that is a

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.510 
me um another gradient filter that is a
preset<00:03:59.390> in<00:03:59.630> the<00:03:59.810> workflow<00:04:00.590> engine<00:04:00.830> version<00:04:01.250> 3

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:01.520 
preset in the workflow engine version 3

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.660 
preset in the workflow engine version 3
and<00:04:01.970> this<00:04:02.420> one's<00:04:02.600> just<00:04:02.690> a<00:04:02.960> light<00:04:03.670> decrease

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
and this one's just a light decrease

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:11.140 
and this one's just a light decrease
exposure<00:04:07.300> across<00:04:08.300> all<00:04:08.750> of<00:04:08.780> that<00:04:09.400> okay<00:04:10.400> I'm

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
exposure across all of that okay I'm

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.250 
exposure across all of that okay I'm
going<00:04:11.270> to<00:04:11.360> grab<00:04:11.450> another<00:04:11.690> one<00:04:14.260> decrease

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
going to grab another one decrease

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.050 
going to grab another one decrease
exposure<00:04:15.920> we're<00:04:16.519> just<00:04:16.609> going<00:04:16.760> to<00:04:16.820> drag<00:04:17.000> it

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
exposure we're just going to drag it

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:18.550 
exposure we're just going to drag it
from<00:04:17.209> the<00:04:17.450> bottom<00:04:17.810> just<00:04:17.930> to<00:04:18.080> make<00:04:18.230> sure<00:04:18.260> that

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
from the bottom just to make sure that

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.039 
from the bottom just to make sure that
this<00:04:18.680> concrete<00:04:19.310> is<00:04:19.459> not<00:04:19.489> as<00:04:19.850> dark<00:04:20.120> I<00:04:20.480> might

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
this concrete is not as dark I might

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:23.650 
this concrete is not as dark I might
even<00:04:21.080> try<00:04:21.380> and<00:04:21.560> do<00:04:21.650> it<00:04:21.769> another<00:04:22.010> pass<00:04:22.660> that's

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
even try and do it another pass that's

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.530 
even try and do it another pass that's
really<00:04:23.900> darken<00:04:24.410> that<00:04:24.440> up<00:04:24.820> so<00:04:25.820> the<00:04:25.940> focus<00:04:26.180> is

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:26.540 
really darken that up so the focus is

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:31.660 
really darken that up so the focus is
just<00:04:26.780> on<00:04:26.930> his<00:04:27.350> face<00:04:28.150> so<00:04:29.150> there<00:04:29.840> we<00:04:30.590> go<00:04:30.620> we<00:04:31.460> just

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:31.670 
just on his face so there we go we just

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:37.630 
just on his face so there we go we just
dragged<00:04:32.000> a<00:04:32.270> couple<00:04:32.690> of<00:04:36.190> graduated<00:04:37.190> filters

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:37.640 
dragged a couple of graduated filters

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.150 
dragged a couple of graduated filters
that<00:04:38.540> have<00:04:38.690> a<00:04:38.720> blue<00:04:38.990> color<00:04:39.290> a<00:04:39.530> little<00:04:39.860> bit<00:04:40.070> of

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 
that have a blue color a little bit of

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.310 
that have a blue color a little bit of
under<00:04:40.400> exposure<00:04:40.820> a<00:04:41.030> little<00:04:41.300> bit<00:04:41.420> separation<00:04:42.290> a

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 
under exposure a little bit separation a

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.700 
under exposure a little bit separation a
little<00:04:42.710> this<00:04:42.860> little<00:04:42.890> that<00:04:43.250> and<00:04:44.140> drag<00:04:45.140> them<00:04:45.380> on

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.710 
little this little that and drag them on

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.490 
little this little that and drag them on
diagonals<00:04:46.550> and<00:04:46.790> then<00:04:47.030> the<00:04:47.630> third<00:04:47.840> one<00:04:47.900> my<00:04:48.260> drag

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500 
diagonals and then the third one my drag

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:19.669 
better blue sky but the expression

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:25.470 
better blue sky but the expression
wasn't<00:05:20.030> as<00:05:20.150> good<00:05:20.360> so<00:05:22.150> hey<00:05:23.150> it<00:05:23.570> happens<00:05:23.840> so<00:05:24.620> um
