00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:24.439 
problem here I am trying to do it on a

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:28.850 
problem here I am trying to do it on a
video<00:01:25.439> and<00:01:25.680> I<00:01:25.770> pick<00:01:25.950> up<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.220> bundle<00:01:27.650> hold<00:01:28.650> it

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
video and I pick up the bundle hold it

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.649 
video and I pick up the bundle hold it
hold<00:01:29.070> it<00:01:29.280> pinch<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.610> back<00:01:29.880> end<00:01:30.119> a<00:01:30.270> little<00:01:30.509> bit

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
hold it pinch the back end a little bit

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.310 
hold it pinch the back end a little bit
and<00:01:31.290> make<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.590> little<00:01:31.829> bit<00:01:32.040> of<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.189> spout<00:01:32.460> here

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
and make a little bit of a spout here

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:43.340 
and make a little bit of a spout here
and<00:01:34.320> then<00:01:35.299> tilt<00:01:36.299> it<00:01:36.509> so<00:01:41.000> so<00:01:42.000> that<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.479> braising

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
and then tilt it so so that the braising

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.550 
and then tilt it so so that the braising
liquid<00:01:44.090> drains<00:01:45.090> into<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.659> Thermomix<00:01:46.259> bowl

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
liquid drains into the Thermomix bowl

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.160 
liquid drains into the Thermomix bowl
and<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:46.890> reason<00:01:47.250> I<00:01:47.340> have<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.820> bowl<00:01:48.000> down<00:01:48.930> in

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
and the reason I have the bowl down in

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.310 
and the reason I have the bowl down in
the<00:01:49.290> sink<00:01:49.560> like<00:01:49.770> this<00:01:50.009> is<00:01:50.810> because<00:01:51.810> it's<00:01:52.110> much

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
the sink like this is because it's much

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.780 
the sink like this is because it's much
easier<00:01:52.649> than<00:01:53.250> lifting<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.329> ribs<00:01:54.540> up<00:01:55.250> high<00:01:56.250> if

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
easier than lifting the ribs up high if

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.840 
easier than lifting the ribs up high if
the<00:01:57.270> bowl<00:01:57.479> is<00:01:57.810> is<00:01:58.619> on<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.280> counter<00:01:59.460> because<00:01:59.820> I

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
the bowl is is on the counter because I

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.670 
the bowl is is on the counter because I
like<00:02:00.149> to<00:02:00.299> let<00:02:00.450> them<00:02:01.310> really<00:02:03.110> drain<00:02:04.110> well<00:02:04.380> and<00:02:04.619> I

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
like to let them really drain well and I

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.720 
like to let them really drain well and I
realize<00:02:05.070> this<00:02:05.250> isn't<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.670> best

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:06.730 
realize this isn't the best

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:11.080 
realize this isn't the best
view<00:02:07.730> for<00:02:08.000> people<00:02:08.330> but<00:02:09.640> you<00:02:10.640> know<00:02:10.729> it<00:02:10.940> is<00:02:11.060> hard

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
view for people but you know it is hard

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.300 
view for people but you know it is hard
to<00:02:11.360> hold<00:02:11.540> a<00:02:11.720> camera<00:02:11.960> and<00:02:14.770> do<00:02:15.770> this<00:02:15.890> kind<00:02:16.220> of

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
to hold a camera and do this kind of

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:25.980 
to hold a camera and do this kind of
work<00:02:16.370> at<00:02:16.760> the<00:02:16.880> same<00:02:17.120> time<00:02:17.360> so<00:02:20.440> maybe<00:02:21.440> this<00:02:21.680> one

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:34.210 

you<00:02:26.990> can<00:02:27.080> see<00:02:27.470> better<00:02:31.540> now<00:02:32.540> this<00:02:33.070> reason<00:02:34.070> we're

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
you can see better now this reason we're

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.140 
you can see better now this reason we're
doing<00:02:34.370> this<00:02:34.550> is<00:02:34.760> because<00:02:36.790> Thermomix<00:02:37.790> is<00:02:37.970> going

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
doing this is because Thermomix is going

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.130 
doing this is because Thermomix is going
to<00:02:39.010> take<00:02:40.010> the<00:02:40.190> bulk<00:02:40.459> of<00:02:40.670> the<00:02:40.790> work<00:02:40.940> out<00:02:41.810> of<00:02:41.870> this

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
to take the bulk of the work out of this

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.800 
to take the bulk of the work out of this
recipe<00:02:42.790> and<00:02:44.350> reduce<00:02:45.350> the<00:02:45.530> glaze<00:02:45.800> for<00:02:46.160> us<00:02:46.810> over

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
recipe and reduce the glaze for us over

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:53.590 
recipe and reduce the glaze for us over
the<00:02:47.930> next<00:02:47.959> half<00:02:48.830> hour<00:02:49.010> to<00:02:49.250> 45<00:02:49.489> minutes<00:02:52.600> what

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
the next half hour to 45 minutes what

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.100 
the next half hour to 45 minutes what
are<00:02:53.660> we<00:02:53.750> doing<00:02:54.020> is<00:02:54.140> taking<00:02:54.590> the<00:02:54.860> ribs<00:02:55.040> and<00:02:56.110> keep

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110
