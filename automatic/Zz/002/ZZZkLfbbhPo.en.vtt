choose<00:04:39.070> our<00:04:39.220> age<00:04:39.460> range<00:04:39.700> I'm<00:04:40.000> going<00:04:40.120> to<00:04:40.180> go

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
choose our age range I'm going to go

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:45.960 
choose our age range I'm going to go
with<00:04:40.660> 17<00:04:41.560> which<00:04:41.710> is<00:04:41.860> my<00:04:42.010> age<00:04:42.190> to<00:04:43.410> around<00:04:44.410> 50<00:04:45.190> so

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
with 17 which is my age to around 50 so

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:47.730 
with 17 which is my age to around 50 so
they<00:04:46.060> don't<00:04:46.210> have<00:04:46.300> anyone<00:04:46.600> older<00:04:47.440> or<00:04:47.590> younger

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
they don't have anyone older or younger

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.320 
they don't have anyone older or younger
than<00:04:47.890> that<00:04:48.100> because<00:04:48.250> that's<00:04:48.460> our<00:04:48.550> target<00:04:49.000> age

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330 
than that because that's our target age

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.540 
than that because that's our target age
range<00:04:49.750> and<00:04:50.050> then<00:04:50.920> we're<00:04:51.040> pretty<00:04:51.130> much<00:04:51.310> done

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
range and then we're pretty much done

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:52.590 
range and then we're pretty much done
with<00:04:51.610> that<00:04:51.790> so<00:04:52.000> we<00:04:52.090> can<00:04:52.240> use<00:04:52.360> other<00:04:52.480> things

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:52.600 
with that so we can use other things

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.360 
with that so we can use other things
such<00:04:52.960> as<00:04:52.990> their<00:04:53.230> location<00:04:53.560> language<00:04:54.190> if<00:04:54.280> you

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.370 
such as their location language if you

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:56.310 
such as their location language if you
want<00:04:54.490> to<00:04:54.550> really<00:04:54.760> target<00:04:55.000> things<00:04:55.360> but<00:04:56.260> I

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320 
want to really target things but I

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.200 
want to really target things but I
that's<00:04:56.440> done<00:04:56.680> so<00:04:57.280> here<00:04:57.520> we<00:04:57.670> go<00:04:57.820> over<00:04:57.940> to<00:04:58.180> our

that's<00:05:13.960> a<00:05:14.080> little<00:05:14.230> trick<00:05:14.470> that<00:05:14.500> will

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:14.770 
that's a little trick that will

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:16.800 
that's a little trick that will
basically<00:05:15.160> stealing<00:05:15.910> other<00:05:16.060> people's<00:05:16.360> funds

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:16.810 
basically stealing other people's funds

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.340 
basically stealing other people's funds
off<00:05:17.170> your<00:05:17.380> sites<00:05:17.830> and<00:05:18.330> choose<00:05:19.330> target<00:05:19.630> country

quickly United States United Kingdom
those<00:05:30.730> the<00:05:30.940> main<00:05:31.120> two<00:05:31.390> and<00:05:31.830> then<00:05:32.830> we<00:05:33.040> can<00:05:35.010> place

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360 
those the main two and then we can place

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:43.560 
those the main two and then we can place
the<00:05:37.360> order<00:05:37.390> now<00:05:37.960> and<00:05:38.520> that<00:05:39.520> should<00:05:40.169> run<00:05:42.570> and

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:43.570 
the order now and that should run and

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:45.870 
the order now and that should run and
it's<00:05:43.810> run<00:05:44.050> and<00:05:44.290> we<00:05:44.560> can<00:05:44.800> have<00:05:45.070> it<00:05:45.250> the<00:05:45.640> order

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:45.880 
it's run and we can have it the order

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.150 
it's run and we can have it the order
placed<00:05:46.210> so<00:05:46.900> this<00:05:47.020> is<00:05:47.140> actually<00:05:47.440> now<00:05:47.590> done<00:05:47.919> and

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:48.160 
placed so this is actually now done and

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.510 
placed so this is actually now done and
our<00:05:48.430> advert<00:05:48.880> is<00:05:49.000> running<00:05:49.390> and<00:05:49.830> the<00:05:50.830> kind<00:05:51.460> of
