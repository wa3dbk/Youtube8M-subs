conversions and stuff like that and most

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:27.930 
conversions and stuff like that and most
of<00:02:26.620> them<00:02:26.740> were<00:02:26.920> when<00:02:27.340> the<00:02:27.459> people<00:02:27.730> just

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
of them were when the people just

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.430 
of them were when the people just
finished<00:02:28.270> the<00:02:28.390> project<00:02:31.140> but<00:02:32.140> I<00:02:32.170> always

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
finished the project but I always

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.190 
finished the project but I always
wondered<00:02:32.800> you<00:02:33.550> know<00:02:33.610> how<00:02:34.060> long<00:02:34.330> the<00:02:35.020> people

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
wondered you know how long the people

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.020 
wondered you know how long the people
had<00:02:35.380> vehicles<00:02:35.890> for<00:02:36.100> did<00:02:36.340> they<00:02:36.370> drive<00:02:36.670> good

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
had vehicles for did they drive good

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.760 
had vehicles for did they drive good
that<00:02:37.330> were<00:02:37.510> they<00:02:37.690> reliable<00:02:38.260> and<00:02:38.410> that<00:02:38.500> sort<00:02:38.709> of

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
that were they reliable and that sort of

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:45.809 
that were they reliable and that sort of
thing<00:02:38.970> so<00:02:40.620> with<00:02:41.620> that<00:02:41.739> being<00:02:41.950> said<00:02:44.670> this<00:02:45.670> will

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819 
thing so with that being said this will

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:47.540 
thing so with that being said this will
probably<00:02:46.120> just<00:02:46.300> be<00:02:46.390> a<00:02:46.480> real<00:02:46.690> quick<00:02:46.930> video<00:02:47.080> I

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
probably just be a real quick video I

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.620 
probably just be a real quick video I
won't<00:02:48.550> go<00:02:48.670> into<00:02:48.850> a<00:02:48.940> whole<00:02:49.180> lot<00:02:49.209> of<00:02:49.390> detail<00:02:51.630> good

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:46.330 
there's no rust hardly coming you might

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.499 
there's no rust hardly coming you might

00:05:48.499 --> 00:05:48.509 
see a little bit of speck here and there

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:54.809 
see a little bit of speck here and there
but<00:05:49.509> it's<00:05:50.289> completely<00:05:50.919> rust<00:05:51.340> free<00:05:53.069> at<00:05:54.069> 225

00:05:54.809 --> 00:05:54.819

this<00:06:04.090> build<00:06:04.389> was<00:06:04.680> trying<00:06:05.680> to<00:06:05.800> stick<00:06:06.039> to<00:06:06.190> a

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:06.220 
this build was trying to stick to a

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:09.300 
this build was trying to stick to a
budget<00:06:06.310> and<00:06:06.880> stay<00:06:07.870> close<00:06:08.110> to<00:06:08.319> the<00:06:08.469> economical

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:09.310 
budget and stay close to the economical

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:11.249 
budget and stay close to the economical
part<00:06:09.550> of<00:06:09.669> it<00:06:09.789> there<00:06:10.389> is<00:06:10.630> a<00:06:10.659> such<00:06:10.900> thing<00:06:10.930> with

00:06:11.249 --> 00:06:11.259 
part of it there is a such thing with

00:06:11.259 --> 00:06:12.990 
part of it there is a such thing with
the<00:06:11.319> conversion<00:06:11.740> like<00:06:11.889> this<00:06:12.069> but<00:06:12.340> the<00:06:12.819> motor

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:13.000 
the conversion like this but the motor

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.990 
the conversion like this but the motor
came<00:06:13.270> out<00:06:13.419> of<00:06:13.569> a<00:06:13.690> 92<00:06:14.500> Dodge<00:06:14.740> be<00:06:15.039> 350<00:06:15.490> two-wheel

00:06:18.809 --> 00:06:18.819 
drive pickup as did the transmission I

00:06:18.819 --> 00:06:21.149 
drive pickup as did the transmission I
used<00:06:19.270> the<00:06:19.419> most<00:06:19.650> economical<00:06:20.650> way<00:06:20.710> to<00:06:20.800> go<00:06:20.979> for

00:06:21.149 --> 00:06:21.159 
used the most economical way to go for

00:06:21.159 --> 00:06:22.379 
used the most economical way to go for
me<00:06:21.250> with<00:06:21.370> transmission<00:06:21.969> was<00:06:22.090> to<00:06:22.240> use<00:06:22.360> a

00:06:22.379 --> 00:06:22.389 
me with transmission was to use a

00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:23.939 
me with transmission was to use a
transmission<00:06:22.900> that<00:06:23.020> was<00:06:23.110> on<00:06:23.289> the<00:06:23.409> motor<00:06:23.590> I<00:06:23.680> did

00:06:23.939 --> 00:06:23.949 
transmission that was on the motor I did

00:06:23.949 --> 00:06:26.309 
transmission that was on the motor I did
not<00:06:24.039> have<00:06:24.219> to<00:06:24.340> buy<00:06:24.490> any<00:06:24.729> expensive<00:06:25.449> adapters

00:06:26.309 --> 00:06:26.319 
not have to buy any expensive adapters

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:28.110

00:06:31.379 --> 00:06:31.389 
the other thing that costs some doing it

00:06:31.389 --> 00:06:32.700 
the other thing that costs some doing it
that<00:06:31.539> way<00:06:31.750> was<00:06:32.110> I<00:06:32.139> had<00:06:32.380> to<00:06:32.469> have<00:06:32.590> the

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:32.710 
that way was I had to have the

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:37.469 
that way was I had to have the
driveshaft<00:06:35.310> made<00:06:36.310> and<00:06:36.610> they<00:06:36.789> basically<00:06:37.000> took

00:06:37.469 --> 00:06:37.479 
driveshaft made and they basically took

00:06:37.479 --> 00:06:40.370 
driveshaft made and they basically took
their<00:06:38.319> part<00:06:38.560> of<00:06:38.650> the<00:06:38.889> Chevrolet<00:06:39.699> driveshaft

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:40.380 
their part of the Chevrolet driveshaft

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:42.839 
their part of the Chevrolet driveshaft
replaced<00:06:41.380> the<00:06:41.560> tube<00:06:41.740> and<00:06:42.099> then<00:06:42.250> put<00:06:42.460> the<00:06:42.610> front

00:06:42.839 --> 00:06:42.849 
replaced the tube and then put the front

00:06:42.849 --> 00:06:45.540 
replaced the tube and then put the front
part<00:06:43.120> of<00:06:43.240> the<00:06:43.389> Dodge<00:06:43.539> driveshaft<00:06:44.169> on<00:06:44.349> that<00:06:44.560> and

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:45.550 
part of the Dodge driveshaft on that and

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:48.629 
part of the Dodge driveshaft on that and
that<00:06:46.029> was<00:06:46.150> around<00:06:46.270> 300<00:06:46.750> bucks<00:06:47.139> as<00:06:47.490> opposed<00:06:48.490> to

00:06:48.629 --> 00:06:48.639 
that was around 300 bucks as opposed to

00:06:48.639 --> 00:06:50.070 
that was around 300 bucks as opposed to
it<00:06:49.029> being<00:06:49.090> about<00:06:49.569> twenty<00:06:49.900> five<00:06:50.050> hundred

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:50.080 
it being about twenty five hundred

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.260 
it being about twenty five hundred
dollars<00:06:50.560> more<00:06:50.800> if<00:06:51.219> I<00:06:51.639> went<00:06:51.940> with<00:06:52.150> the

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:52.270 
dollars more if I went with the

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:53.580 
dollars more if I went with the
different<00:06:52.630> transmission<00:06:53.199> I<00:06:53.259> would<00:06:53.409> have<00:06:53.500> had

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:53.590 
different transmission I would have had

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:55.879 
different transmission I would have had
to<00:06:53.710> buy<00:06:53.800> adapter<00:06:54.279> plate<00:06:54.520> starter

00:06:55.879 --> 00:06:55.889 
to buy adapter plate starter

00:06:55.889 --> 00:06:57.899 
to buy adapter plate starter
transmission<00:06:56.889> programmer<00:06:57.310> if<00:06:57.580> it<00:06:57.759> was

00:06:57.899 --> 00:06:57.909 
transmission programmer if it was

00:06:57.909 --> 00:07:00.959 
transmission programmer if it was
electronic<00:06:58.449> transmission<00:06:59.550> and<00:07:00.550> that<00:07:00.699> sort<00:07:00.940> of

00:07:00.959 --> 00:07:00.969 
electronic transmission and that sort of

00:07:00.969 --> 00:07:02.850 
electronic transmission and that sort of
thing<00:07:01.150> so<00:07:01.180> I<00:07:01.419> tried<00:07:01.750> to<00:07:01.930> stay<00:07:02.380> more<00:07:02.590> toward<00:07:02.800> the

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:02.860 
thing so I tried to stay more toward the

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:07.969 
thing so I tried to stay more toward the
conservative<00:07:03.460> side<00:07:03.580> as<00:07:03.759> far<00:07:03.880> as<00:07:03.940> cost<00:07:04.210> goes

00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:07.979 

00:07:07.979 --> 00:07:09.890 

anyway

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:09.900 
anyway

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:13.280 
anyway
so<00:07:10.800> she<00:07:10.920> runs<00:07:11.220> good<00:07:11.490> she's<00:07:11.730> dependable<00:07:12.290> good

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:13.290 
so she runs good she's dependable good

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:14.960 
so she runs good she's dependable good
fuel<00:07:13.530> mileage<00:07:13.560> fuel<00:07:14.100> mileage<00:07:14.280> will<00:07:14.520> rival<00:07:14.730> out

won't<00:07:20.700> believe<00:07:20.970> me<00:07:21.120> but<00:07:21.150> it's<00:07:21.420> in<00:07:21.540> the<00:07:21.630> 20s<00:07:21.980> on

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:22.980 
won't believe me but it's in the 20s on

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:27.470 
won't believe me but it's in the 20s on
the<00:07:23.040> highway<00:07:24.620> and<00:07:25.620> that<00:07:25.940> was<00:07:26.940> actually<00:07:27.120> with

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:27.480 
the highway and that was actually with

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:29.420 
the highway and that was actually with
my<00:07:27.660> wife<00:07:27.840> Kane<00:07:28.140> calculating<00:07:28.800> and<00:07:29.040> when<00:07:29.190> I<00:07:29.220> was

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:29.430 
my wife Kane calculating and when I was

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:30.950 
my wife Kane calculating and when I was
doing<00:07:29.670> this<00:07:29.790> project<00:07:30.330> she<00:07:30.450> wasn't<00:07:30.720> really

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:30.960 
doing this project she wasn't really

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:32.420 
doing this project she wasn't really
excited<00:07:31.410> about<00:07:31.500> it

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:32.430 
excited about it

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:34.790 
excited about it
as<00:07:33.300> far<00:07:33.540> as<00:07:33.690> the<00:07:33.840> time<00:07:34.050> and<00:07:34.260> maybe<00:07:34.380> some<00:07:34.650> of<00:07:34.710> the

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:34.800 
as far as the time and maybe some of the

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:37.760 
as far as the time and maybe some of the
money<00:07:35.180> but<00:07:36.180> now<00:07:36.360> it<00:07:36.750> has<00:07:36.810> a<00:07:37.050> remain<00:07:37.380> source<00:07:37.650> of

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:37.770 
money but now it has a remain source of

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:40.520 
money but now it has a remain source of
transportation<00:07:38.010> and<00:07:38.960> it's<00:07:39.960> like<00:07:40.200> she<00:07:40.350> doesn't

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:40.530 
transportation and it's like she doesn't

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:42.350 
transportation and it's like she doesn't
really<00:07:40.710> want<00:07:41.010> to<00:07:41.070> drive<00:07:41.220> anything<00:07:41.580> else<00:07:41.760> so

00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:42.360 
really want to drive anything else so

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:44.870 
really want to drive anything else so
