00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:07.620
 hello everybody today I'm showing here 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:11.190
 the step by step how to connect is a motor 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:14.849
 to take off to be controlled with 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:17.460
 arduino through the bridge h 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:23.070
 For that I'm going to use it's just a little source 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:26.730
 simple mobile phone charger 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:29.880
 it provides voltage and current 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.610
 sufficient to start the engine 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.790
 there are those who point ho circuit conti h 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.770
 have to be double when playing double or 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.510
 even build a scheme that china 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:45.059
 internet, I 'll put it in the description of the 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:48.420
 video also the dilma protocol order only 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:53.100
 to facilitate the connection there are years 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:55.530
 so let's first identify 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:59.760
 that the floors to these are the wires of 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:03.300
 bridge power h 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:07.020
 the positive you can see that it is 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:14.240
 a gambiarra require that you will connect the 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:14.240
 positive and negative source here 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:29.710
 beauty now here 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:32.740
 on the bridge h the walking team we have is the 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:36.100
 following scheme we have four 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:39.970
 children on each side and four children here 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:44.439
 with 234 and here too 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:48.850
 these two children here is yellow and 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:50.380
 are connected to the pitch motor of the 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.979
 the other side the same thing 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:57.850
 yellow and black are not bonded 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:02:02.619
 paÃ§o motor and this wire here the orange 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:05.409
 and the gray on the doors of the arduino 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:06.039
 on the other side also the similar son 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:10.269
 to him 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:13.690
 orange and violet also on the 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:16.900
 arduino and they who control the 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.910
 reversal of bridge direction h 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.910
 I do not know if the crew knows what the 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:24.910
 More gattuso steering wheel I will put link of 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:28.000
 also for you to understand the 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:31.060
 and we use it to trigger 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.150
 this type of stepper motor the 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:38.319
 peace he has these four wires here 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:41.560
 the bicola has four unipolar children is 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:43.959
 other type you trigger it different not 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.239
 When he got to school, he was one of the 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:50.230
 bipolar with what I have here O 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:55.269
 This motorcycle here, I have a 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:56.440
 epson stylus 777 printer you power on 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:59.620
 to him 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:03.850
 this way if you see the children you 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:07.569
 It's going to turn red on black, that's all. 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:12.160
 Are you going to skip one is a two three four? 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:18.690
 or pick up the first and the third the 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:18.690
 second and fourth on one side 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:30.810
 the bike on the first and third 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.810
 I do not know if it gives you the right ones. 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:38.780
 on the other side that controls the 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.370
 bridge is also the output of the motor in the 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:48.070
 truth 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:48.070
 in the second and fourth child 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:04:01.750
 Beauty the engine turned on and now I go 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:03.730
 connect the wires that control a bridge 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.430
 h that will make the engine control of 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:08.079
 step on the arduino I could connect direct 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:12.040
 the arduino but I'll call here at 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:28.180
 own club only going will help me 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:32.169
 beauty in 1234 is not four 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:37.300
 wires that will turn on the 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:40.990
 on the four digital arduino ports that 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.740
 here by my program are the 8 9 10 and 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.780
 11 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:47.979
 I'll put it there for you. 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:52.240
 to see right 8 9 10 and 11 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:56.940
 beauty then I'll download the 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.940
 hymn code 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:09.260
 it was a pool 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.950
 can upload code 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:27.530
 ready was the fado or off to power 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:32.240
 see me now with the arrival of yet another 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:33.620
 book of a computer then beauty 8 9 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:39.680
 10 and 11 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:48.650
 I think we'll call 8 from the other 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:51.770
 there and 11 really nothing from anyone 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:55.160
 connected not connect the five children 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:59.710
 You have to turn on negative too. 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:06:03.080
 op seeing here o negative of the bridge h 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:06.050
 in the negative of the source and with the 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:14.380
 Arduino also does not work there in the 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:18.790
 gene in the power 15 art in the great 

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:18.790
 I'll call the source then. 

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:28.050
 and now 

00:06:26.009 --> 00:06:32.059
 I'll call here on the computer that the 

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:32.059
 provide energy for me 

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:35.990
 come on it 's working 

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:43.889
 this code I made it spins on motor 

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:47.430
 chrome 

00:06:43.889 --> 00:06:51.360
 then go to another more of it is always 

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:55.289
 simple to play in basic programming 

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:59.069
 same side - I'll put the code to 

00:06:55.289 --> 00:07:01.520
 description of the video with more than 

00:06:59.069 --> 00:07:01.520
 that an engine 

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:08.310
 the noise 

00:07:17.509 --> 00:07:23.939
 That's it so I hope it stayed 

00:07:19.559 --> 00:07:26.399
 of course how the connection is made 

00:07:23.939 --> 00:07:28.769
 I'll post the website that takes the schematic 

00:07:26.399 --> 00:07:30.599
 From the bridge, they will put this to you. 

00:07:28.769 --> 00:07:33.449
 any doubt you can enter into 

00:07:30.599 --> 00:07:37.289
 contact me by e-mail put 

00:07:33.449 --> 00:07:40.819
 in the video description as well and here 

00:07:37.289 --> 00:07:45.539
 even for my youtube channel 

00:07:40.819 --> 00:07:48.259
 I want your help and this is it 

00:07:45.539 --> 00:07:48.259
 thanks
