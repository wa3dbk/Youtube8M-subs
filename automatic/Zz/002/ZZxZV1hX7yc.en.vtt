00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.430 

now<00:02:42.020> that<00:02:42.530> we<00:02:42.709> are<00:02:42.830> at<00:02:43.010> 100%<00:02:43.790> we<00:02:44.720> can<00:02:44.900> finally

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
now that we are at 100% we can finally

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.070 
now that we are at 100% we can finally
enter<00:02:45.740> the<00:02:46.190> portal<00:02:46.610> and<00:02:46.910> go<00:02:47.540> to<00:02:47.870> an

just<00:02:58.430> like<00:02:58.610> the<00:02:58.790> Suzuka<00:02:59.330> only<00:03:00.290> a<00:03:00.500> little<00:03:00.770> bit

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
just like the Suzuka only a little bit

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.090 
just like the Suzuka only a little bit
bigger<00:03:01.250> I<00:03:01.580> think<00:03:01.610> and<00:03:02.120> it<00:03:02.600> has<00:03:02.840> all<00:03:03.590> these

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
bigger I think and it has all these

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.240 
bigger I think and it has all these
links<00:03:04.459> are<00:03:05.000> sprayed<00:03:05.569> next<00:03:05.959> to<00:03:06.050> it<00:03:06.170> and<00:03:06.500> look<00:03:07.130> at

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
links are sprayed next to it and look at

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.290 
links are sprayed next to it and look at
it<00:03:07.400> I'm<00:03:07.580> trying<00:03:08.420> to<00:03:08.630> kill<00:03:08.870> it<00:03:09.730> but<00:03:10.730> it<00:03:10.910> doesn't

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300 
it I'm trying to kill it but it doesn't

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.960 
it I'm trying to kill it but it doesn't

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 
going down and now I have the void key

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:22.000 
going down and now I have the void key
and<00:03:19.790> it's<00:03:20.570> time<00:03:20.780> to<00:03:20.810> go<00:03:21.080> back<00:03:21.290> to<00:03:21.350> the<00:03:21.620> portal

have to find these scanners again and
these<00:04:13.000> scanners<00:04:13.360> need<00:04:13.870> power<00:04:14.310> to<00:04:15.310> find<00:04:15.640> it's

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
these scanners need power to find it's

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.350 
these scanners need power to find it's
excavators<00:04:17.200> and<00:04:17.920> these<00:04:18.190> excavators<00:04:18.880> will
