00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:13.850
 Hello friends today tell you how 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:17.240
 in a simple way by drywall and 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:19.100
 make a beautiful arch in the doorway old 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.170
 brick doorway on the idea 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.930
 should turn into a pretty arch 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:26.000
 made of drywall due 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:28.160
 features of this opening we will 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.410
 act in a non-standard way with us 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.029
 there are already side walls on them 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.760
 we will place a curved arch 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:37.100
 drywall to understand how long 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.100
 there will be an arch I use ordinary wire 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:45.860
 and and need to align the semblance 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:47.750
 and then install the opening set 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.680
 wire in the opening as it will stand 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.829
 future arch 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.930
 I rest the upper jumper bending 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:55.760
 wire from both sides to learn 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:59.540
 the exact length of drywall for 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:03.250
 arches set the resulting arc on 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.250
 side plasterboard supports 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:16.640
 using wire as a template we measure 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.640
 the length of drywall for the arch 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:28.060
 we already have the length of the arch and now 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.060
 check its width 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:34.400
 we cut off the usual size 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:38.290
 we perform a piece of drywall for walls 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.290
 marking up and cutting drywall 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:48.609
 the gift sheet we cut off will now find out 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:51.679
 what is the arch depth 

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:56.149
 for this we will check the height from the base 

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:59.090
 an abortion 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:00.799
 find out the width of the opening now I'm going 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.549
 scrap materials are very simple 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:03.049
 construction 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:06.229
 which will help to bend the sheet 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:08.780
 drywall this is three trimming boards the most 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.280
 large y is equal to the width of the opening side 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:17.360
 height of the structure 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:19.400
 corresponds to the depth of the archive is simple 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.200
 U-shaped design will allow without 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.230
 problems bend the arch to fit us 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.450
 size note that the side 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.000
 parts securely fastened to the bottom support 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.549
 since we will bend the drywall 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.549
 wet we need notches 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:36.620
 or punctures on one of its sides when 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:38.360
 the absence of a special spiked roller 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.209
 for punctures you can use 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:44.950
 following method along the intended 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:47.540
 bend with knife i put shallow notches 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.350
 then I retreat a little and spend 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:53.299
 next notch line 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:56.290
 this way I apply notches all over 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:03:00.290
 surface of one of the sides of drywall 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:07.280
 that's what eventually should be able to 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:10.420
 and now proceed to the process of bending and 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.829
 under our design we put the film 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.599
 on top of the structure fit 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:17.689
 cut drywall sheet 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:19.760
 notched up now our task 

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:22.849
 soak the top surface evenly 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:29.750
 drywall water for this use 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:31.510
 ordinary sponge to 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:35.709
 additionally wet drywall 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.709
 put a damp cloth on top 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:44.450
 Here is our construction in 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:50.870
 right here is the main thing to soak 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:53.270
 drywall moisture after 20 minutes we 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:56.210
 observe that drywall has already begun 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:58.130
 self-sag if rag 

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:08.000
 dries quickly and can be reused 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:11.180
 moisturize and that's what happens with 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.520
 drywall two hours later how are you 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.390
 can see he evenly caved up 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.269
 very bottom 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:19.730
 now take a rag and inspect our 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:21.760
 arch with hands if necessary 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:25.820
 we correct this or that side 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:27.620
 neatly install orc opening here 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:42.650
 need to be careful because 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:45.350
 the sheet is wet and easily bent bent 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:48.380
 drywall sheet installed and secured 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:50.990
 at the base further along the perimeter 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:52.240
 arches i put up a metal frame and 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.590
 sewed voids 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.270
 as you can see this is not a difficult way 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:59.210
 drywall bending 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:03.550
 Here is the arch I got all
