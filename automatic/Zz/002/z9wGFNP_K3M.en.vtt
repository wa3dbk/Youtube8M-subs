00:05:17.959 --> 00:05:17.969 
really did sell it to me it means I can

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:19.670

massive<00:05:30.900> selling<00:05:31.349> point<00:05:31.560> in<00:05:31.680> my<00:05:31.770> opinion<00:05:32.120> the

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120 
massive selling point in my opinion the

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.610 
massive selling point in my opinion the
City<00:05:33.270> Mini<00:05:33.510> is<00:05:33.719> also<00:05:34.110> travel<00:05:34.500> system

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:34.620 
City Mini is also travel system

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.129 
City Mini is also travel system
compatible<00:05:35.339> so<00:05:35.610> all<00:05:36.029> you<00:05:36.150> need<00:05:36.270> to<00:05:36.389> do<00:05:36.479> is<00:05:36.750> buy

00:05:48.019 --> 00:05:48.029 
do for more of a sleeker look is

00:05:48.029 --> 00:05:50.120 
do for more of a sleeker look is
actually<00:05:48.419> remove<00:05:48.960> this<00:05:49.199> seat<00:05:49.409> completely<00:05:49.949> and

00:05:53.839 --> 00:05:53.849 
okay so on to some of the main

00:05:53.849 --> 00:05:55.579 
okay so on to some of the main
differences<00:05:54.089> between<00:05:54.690> the<00:05:54.930> four<00:05:55.169> models<00:05:55.469> that

00:05:55.579 --> 00:05:55.589 
differences between the four models that

00:05:55.589 --> 00:05:56.659 
differences between the four models that
I<00:05:55.620> mentioned<00:05:55.979> at<00:05:56.039> the<00:05:56.070> beginning<00:05:56.219> of<00:05:56.520> this

00:05:56.659 --> 00:05:56.669 
I mentioned at the beginning of this

00:05:56.669 --> 00:05:58.579 
I mentioned at the beginning of this
video<00:05:56.849> this<00:05:57.570> of<00:05:57.750> course<00:05:57.779> is<00:05:58.080> the<00:05:58.169> four-wheel

00:05:58.579 --> 00:05:58.589 
video this of course is the four-wheel

00:05:58.589 --> 00:06:00.769 
video this of course is the four-wheel
version<00:05:58.860> which<00:05:59.370> funnily<00:05:59.849> enough<00:05:59.880> is<00:06:00.360> not<00:06:00.570> as

00:06:00.769 --> 00:06:00.779 
version which funnily enough is not as

00:06:00.779 --> 00:06:03.170 
version which funnily enough is not as
readily<00:06:01.199> available<00:06:01.289> as<00:06:01.949> the<00:06:02.250> three<00:06:02.490> wheel<00:06:02.699> the

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:03.180 
readily available as the three wheel the

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:04.700 
readily available as the three wheel the
three<00:06:03.389> rule<00:06:03.570> you'll<00:06:03.779> find<00:06:04.050> in<00:06:04.199> all<00:06:04.320> the<00:06:04.440> stores

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:04.710 
three rule you'll find in all the stores

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:05.810 
three rule you'll find in all the stores
and<00:06:04.919> you'll<00:06:05.039> probably<00:06:05.190> see<00:06:05.490> more<00:06:05.639> people

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:05.820 
and you'll probably see more people

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:08.390 
and you'll probably see more people
using<00:06:06.270> it<00:06:06.510> as<00:06:06.690> well<00:06:06.930> the<00:06:07.620> three<00:06:07.860> wheel<00:06:08.010> is<00:06:08.219> also

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.400 
using it as well the three wheel is also

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:09.980 
using it as well the three wheel is also
slightly<00:06:08.909> lighter<00:06:09.180> than<00:06:09.360> the<00:06:09.570> four<00:06:09.779> wheels

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:09.990 
slightly lighter than the four wheels

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:13.070 
slightly lighter than the four wheels
only<00:06:10.409> because<00:06:10.650> it<00:06:10.740> has<00:06:10.860> one<00:06:11.130> less<00:06:11.159> wheel<00:06:11.900> but<00:06:12.900> I

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:13.080 
only because it has one less wheel but I

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.290 
only because it has one less wheel but I
find<00:06:13.440> that<00:06:13.529> with<00:06:13.710> four<00:06:13.949> wheels<00:06:14.339> is<00:06:14.580> easier<00:06:15.089> to

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:15.300 
find that with four wheels is easier to

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:17.810 
find that with four wheels is easier to
go<00:06:15.510> up<00:06:15.750> and<00:06:15.960> down<00:06:16.080> curbs<00:06:16.409> and<00:06:16.740> also<00:06:17.400> I<00:06:17.430> find

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:17.820 
go up and down curbs and also I find

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:19.430 
go up and down curbs and also I find
that<00:06:17.909> because<00:06:18.089> of<00:06:18.479> that<00:06:18.599> extra<00:06:18.990> weight<00:06:19.139> of<00:06:19.169> the

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:19.440 
that because of that extra weight of the

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.890 
that because of that extra weight of the
extra<00:06:19.800> wheel<00:06:20.010> and<00:06:20.310> the<00:06:21.240> weight<00:06:21.539> is<00:06:21.750> actually

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:21.900 
extra wheel and the weight is actually

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:24.800 
extra wheel and the weight is actually
distributed<00:06:22.349> a<00:06:22.740> bit<00:06:23.070> better<00:06:23.430> and<00:06:23.909> you<00:06:24.479> know<00:06:24.510> so

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:24.810 
distributed a bit better and you know so

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:26.899 
distributed a bit better and you know so
there's<00:06:25.050> less<00:06:25.589> likelihood<00:06:25.860> of<00:06:26.370> the<00:06:26.669> stroller

00:06:26.899 --> 00:06:26.909 
there's less likelihood of the stroller

00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:27.370 
there's less likelihood of the stroller
tipping

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:27.380 
tipping

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:28.990 
tipping
the<00:06:27.530> backwards<00:06:28.100> hopefully<00:06:28.610> we<00:06:28.670> weren't<00:06:28.820> drunk

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:29.000 
the backwards hopefully we weren't drunk

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.480 
the backwards hopefully we weren't drunk
over<00:06:29.270> backwards<00:06:29.570> anyway<00:06:30.100> you<00:06:31.100> then<00:06:31.280> have<00:06:31.460> the

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:31.490 
over backwards anyway you then have the

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:33.490 
over backwards anyway you then have the
three-wheeled<00:06:31.970> GT<00:06:32.360> the<00:06:32.600> GT<00:06:32.960> version<00:06:33.110> is<00:06:33.380> only

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:42.730 
Mini and the GT tires are foam filled
tires<00:06:39.140> so<00:06:39.800> they<00:06:40.790> are<00:06:40.910> heavier<00:06:41.360> tires<00:06:41.740> but

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:42.740 
tires so they are heavier tires but

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:44.860 
tires so they are heavier tires but
they're<00:06:42.950> great<00:06:43.310> if<00:06:43.550> you<00:06:43.820> are<00:06:43.850> an<00:06:44.360> off-roader
