goes by so quickly that it's very hard
to<00:01:25.770> notice<00:01:27.049> but<00:01:28.049> a<00:01:28.110> minute<00:01:28.530> is<00:01:28.710> like<00:01:28.950> a<00:01:28.979> moment

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
to notice but a minute is like a moment

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
begins and where it ends so it's easier
