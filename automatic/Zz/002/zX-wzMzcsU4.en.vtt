00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:05.019 
a big mistake because jaedong has that

00:05:05.019 --> 00:05:07.889 
a big mistake because jaedong has that
natural<00:05:05.199> going<00:05:05.949> himself<00:05:06.399> he<00:05:07.209> is<00:05:07.329> economically

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:07.899 
natural going himself he is economically

00:05:07.899 --> 00:05:10.559 
natural going himself he is economically
ahead<00:05:08.349> now<00:05:08.589> he<00:05:09.279> has<00:05:09.699> a<00:05:09.729> production<00:05:10.209> advantage

00:05:10.559 --> 00:05:10.569 
ahead now he has a production advantage

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:13.469 
ahead now he has a production advantage
she's<00:05:10.689> just<00:05:10.809> over<00:05:11.079> all<00:05:12.149> over<00:05:13.149> one<00:05:13.269> a<00:05:13.329> much

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:13.479 
she's just over all over one a much

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:15.149 
she's just over all over one a much
better<00:05:13.659> positions<00:05:14.049> part<00:05:14.319> halfway<00:05:14.679> done<00:05:14.860> on

00:05:15.149 --> 00:05:15.159 
better positions part halfway done on

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:17.669 
better positions part halfway done on
the<00:05:15.549> opposite<00:05:15.819> side<00:05:15.999> the<00:05:16.179> we're<00:05:16.389> not<00:05:17.289> even<00:05:17.529> up

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:17.679 
the opposite side the we're not even up

00:05:17.679 --> 00:05:19.799 
the opposite side the we're not even up
yet<00:05:17.709> ferraro's<00:05:18.339> so<00:05:18.699> Jael<00:05:19.509> is<00:05:19.569> going<00:05:19.689> to<00:05:19.749> be

00:05:19.799 --> 00:05:19.809 
yet ferraro's so Jael is going to be

00:05:19.809 --> 00:05:22.079 
yet ferraro's so Jael is going to be
able<00:05:19.869> to<00:05:19.989> pop<00:05:20.199> six<00:05:20.529> meters<00:05:20.949> five<00:05:21.669> or<00:05:21.789> six<00:05:21.909> moons

00:05:22.079 --> 00:05:22.089 
able to pop six meters five or six moons

00:05:22.089 --> 00:05:23.519 
able to pop six meters five or six moons
out<00:05:22.299> of<00:05:22.389> those<00:05:22.509> two<00:05:22.569> bases<00:05:23.079> pretty<00:05:23.289> quickly

00:05:23.519 --> 00:05:23.529 
out of those two bases pretty quickly

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:26.189 
out of those two bases pretty quickly
probably<00:05:24.219> six<00:05:24.579> and<00:05:24.819> they're<00:05:25.749> going<00:05:25.869> to<00:05:25.929> by<00:05:26.139> the

00:05:26.189 --> 00:05:26.199 
probably six and they're going to by the

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:27.719 
probably six and they're going to by the
time<00:05:26.499> that<00:05:26.679> they're<00:05:26.829> in<00:05:26.979> ruins<00:05:27.309> base<00:05:27.459> row

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:27.729 
time that they're in ruins base row

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:29.729 
time that they're in ruins base row
might<00:05:28.119> not<00:05:28.299> even<00:05:28.449> have<00:05:28.809> any<00:05:28.989> mutants<00:05:29.379> up<00:05:29.499> yet

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:29.739 
might not even have any mutants up yet

00:05:29.739 --> 00:05:31.409 
might not even have any mutants up yet
so<00:05:30.039> that's<00:05:30.249> going<00:05:30.459> to<00:05:30.519> be<00:05:30.579> GG<00:05:30.849> right<00:05:31.149> there<00:05:31.299> if

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:31.419 
so that's going to be GG right there if

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:33.689 
so that's going to be GG right there if
not<00:05:31.539> anytime<00:05:31.899> soon<00:05:32.249> creep<00:05:33.249> colony<00:05:33.549> at<00:05:33.639> the

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:33.699 
not anytime soon creep colony at the

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:35.669 
not anytime soon creep colony at the
nitrous<00:05:33.999> mansion<00:05:34.329> this<00:05:34.809> yeah<00:05:35.199> this<00:05:35.379> is<00:05:35.559> the

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:35.679 
nitrous mansion this yeah this is the

00:05:35.679 --> 00:05:37.619 
nitrous mansion this yeah this is the
bad<00:05:35.829> part<00:05:35.860> Pororo<00:05:36.639> because<00:05:36.969> jaedong<00:05:37.329> now<00:05:37.479> has

00:05:37.619 --> 00:05:37.629 
bad part Pororo because jaedong now has

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:39.299 
bad part Pororo because jaedong now has
had<00:05:37.839> enough<00:05:38.049> time<00:05:38.199> to<00:05:38.259> put<00:05:38.559> down<00:05:38.739> some<00:05:39.009> extra

00:05:39.299 --> 00:05:39.309 
had enough time to put down some extra

00:05:39.309 --> 00:05:40.829 
had enough time to put down some extra
defenses<00:05:39.669> he<00:05:39.759> knows<00:05:39.999> that<00:05:40.299> the<00:05:40.419> only<00:05:40.449> chance

00:05:40.829 --> 00:05:40.839 
defenses he knows that the only chance

00:05:40.839 --> 00:05:42.239 
defenses he knows that the only chance
for<00:05:40.899> right<00:05:41.169> now<00:05:41.199> is<00:05:41.469> to<00:05:41.589> go<00:05:41.709> for<00:05:41.829> a<00:05:41.919> full

00:05:42.239 --> 00:05:42.249 
for right now is to go for a full

00:05:42.249 --> 00:05:44.879 
for right now is to go for a full
frontal<00:05:42.579> attack<00:05:42.879> and<00:05:43.409> I<00:05:44.409> honestly<00:05:44.769> feel

00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:44.889 
frontal attack and I honestly feel

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:45.809 
frontal attack and I honestly feel
that's<00:05:45.039> what<00:05:45.129> role<00:05:45.309> should<00:05:45.519> have<00:05:45.639> done<00:05:45.789> just

00:05:45.809 --> 00:05:45.819 
that's what role should have done just

00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:47.669 
that's what role should have done just
get<00:05:46.149> the<00:05:46.269> speed<00:05:46.539> and<00:05:46.719> just<00:05:46.869> a<00:05:46.929> mess<00:05:47.079> continue

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:47.679 
get the speed and just a mess continue

00:05:47.679 --> 00:05:49.559 
get the speed and just a mess continue
amassing<00:05:48.099> zerglings<00:05:48.519> and<00:05:48.699> just<00:05:48.909> go<00:05:49.209> for<00:05:49.509> it

00:05:49.559 --> 00:05:49.569 
amassing zerglings and just go for it

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:51.389 
amassing zerglings and just go for it
that's<00:05:49.779> the<00:05:49.929> only<00:05:50.349> way<00:05:50.499> I<00:05:50.529> see<00:05:50.860> the<00:05:50.979> Roar<00:05:51.159> can

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:51.399 
that's the only way I see the Roar can

00:05:51.399 --> 00:05:53.339 
that's the only way I see the Roar can
win<00:05:51.519> J<00:05:51.549> don't<00:05:51.759> even<00:05:52.029> say<00:05:52.119> has<00:05:52.899> enough<00:05:53.110> not<00:05:53.259> to

00:05:53.339 --> 00:05:53.349 
win J don't even say has enough not to

00:05:53.349 --> 00:05:54.929 
win J don't even say has enough not to
send<00:05:53.499> up<00:05:53.589> to<00:05:53.709> his<00:05:53.860> dad<00:05:54.039> that<00:05:54.069> sunken<00:05:54.519> colony<00:05:54.849> at

00:05:54.929 --> 00:05:54.939 
send up to his dad that sunken colony at

00:05:54.939 --> 00:05:56.279 
send up to his dad that sunken colony at
the<00:05:54.999> next<00:05:55.179> expansion<00:05:55.389> he<00:05:55.599> feels<00:05:55.809> a<00:05:55.899> lot<00:05:55.989> safer

00:05:56.279 --> 00:05:56.289 
the next expansion he feels a lot safer

00:05:56.289 --> 00:05:58.319 
the next expansion he feels a lot safer
with<00:05:56.589> that<00:05:56.769> lower<00:05:57.189> does<00:05:57.459> have<00:05:57.610> a<00:05:57.669> larger<00:05:58.059> force

00:05:58.319 --> 00:05:58.329 
with that lower does have a larger force

00:05:58.329 --> 00:05:59.909 
with that lower does have a larger force
it<00:05:58.569> seems<00:05:58.959> or<00:05:59.259> actually<00:05:59.589> i<00:05:59.649> think<00:05:59.679> the

00:05:59.909 --> 00:05:59.919 
it seems or actually i think the

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:00.989 
it seems or actually i think the
circuits<00:06:00.129> are<00:06:00.159> about<00:06:00.339> the<00:06:00.429> same<00:06:00.549> camera<00:06:00.879> we're

00:06:00.989 --> 00:06:00.999 
circuits are about the same camera we're

00:06:00.999 --> 00:06:02.459 
circuits are about the same camera we're
still<00:06:01.149> gonna<00:06:01.239> go<00:06:01.419> for<00:06:01.599> this<00:06:01.659> i<00:06:01.839> think<00:06:02.379> this

00:06:02.459 --> 00:06:02.469 
still gonna go for this i think this

00:06:02.469 --> 00:06:04.169 
still gonna go for this i think this
actually<00:06:02.619> a<00:06:02.829> doomed<00:06:03.099> venture<00:06:03.639> jet<00:06:03.879> and<00:06:03.999> seems

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:04.179 
actually a doomed venture jet and seems

00:06:04.179 --> 00:06:05.699 
actually a doomed venture jet and seems
to<00:06:04.269> be<00:06:04.360> coming<00:06:04.479> out<00:06:04.719> of<00:06:04.749> this<00:06:04.929> slightly<00:06:05.409> ahead
