to me so it's a very thick dark lotion

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.340 
to me so it's a very thick dark lotion
and<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:55.469> smell<00:00:55.770> this<00:00:56.010> product<00:00:56.520> I<00:00:56.699> was

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
and the smell this product I was

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.869 
and the smell this product I was
overwhelmed<00:00:58.350> by<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.739> smell<00:00:59.010> of<00:00:59.070> alcohol<00:00:59.309> when

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
overwhelmed by the smell of alcohol when

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.670 
overwhelmed by the smell of alcohol when
I<00:00:59.910> first<00:01:00.239> pumped<00:01:00.600> this<00:01:00.690> product<00:01:01.109> onto<00:01:01.320> my<00:01:01.410> hand

I first pumped this product onto my hand

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.520 
I first pumped this product onto my hand
so<00:01:02.550> I<00:01:02.579> think<00:01:02.879> it<00:01:02.969> smells<00:01:03.090> very<00:01:03.449> chemically<00:01:04.110> and

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
so I think it smells very chemically and

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.289 
so I think it smells very chemically and
you<00:01:04.860> could<00:01:05.010> definitely<00:01:05.189> smell<00:01:05.519> alcohol<00:01:06.180> in

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299

you could definitely smell alcohol in
this<00:01:06.390> product<00:01:06.780> which<00:01:06.900> I<00:01:07.020> don't<00:01:07.200> like<00:01:07.350> and

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070

this product which I don't like and
putting<00:01:08.850> it<00:01:08.970> on<00:01:09.180> is<00:01:09.510> a<00:01:10.049> pain<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.979> say<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.340> least

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
putting it on is a pain to say the least

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.700 
putting it on is a pain to say the least
because<00:01:11.790> it<00:01:11.970> is<00:01:12.240> so<00:01:12.540> dark<00:01:12.840> it<00:01:13.049> got<00:01:13.200> everywhere

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
because it is so dark it got everywhere

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.420 
because it is so dark it got everywhere
they<00:01:14.310> do<00:01:14.369> send<00:01:14.970> gloves<00:01:15.240> with<00:01:15.450> it<00:01:15.600> which<00:01:15.780> I<00:01:15.900> like

they do send gloves with it which I like

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.010 
they do send gloves with it which I like
however<00:01:17.430> it<00:01:17.820> just<00:01:17.970> didn't<00:01:18.330> seem<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.630> help

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
however it just didn't seem to help

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.660 
however it just didn't seem to help
getting<00:01:19.409> all<00:01:19.530> over<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.770> place<00:01:20.040> like<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.280> next

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
got all those places because I thought I

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.719 
got all those places because I thought I
was<00:01:27.630> careful<00:01:28.110> but<00:01:28.290> it's<00:01:28.470> extremely<00:01:29.220> messy<00:01:29.340> as

was careful but it's extremely messy as

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.480 
was careful but it's extremely messy as

try<00:01:43.710> this<00:01:43.770> because<00:01:44.040> I<00:01:44.280> thought<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.670> color

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
try this because I thought the color

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.580 
try this because I thought the color
produce<00:01:45.210> was<00:01:45.390> going<00:01:45.540> to<00:01:45.630> be<00:01:45.720> dark<00:01:46.020> due<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.470> the

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
produce was going to be dark due to the

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.010 
produce was going to be dark due to the
dark<00:01:46.829> guide<00:01:47.040> it<00:01:47.220> has<00:01:47.399> however<00:01:48.299> when<00:01:48.659> I<00:01:48.689> washed

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
dark guide it has however when I washed

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.780 
dark guide it has however when I washed
it<00:01:49.229> off<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.560> next<00:01:49.829> day<00:01:49.890> it<00:01:50.130> just<00:01:50.340> wasn't<00:01:50.759> very

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
it off the next day it just wasn't very

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.880 
it off the next day it just wasn't very
dark<00:01:51.210> it<00:01:51.390> was<00:01:51.479> light<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:52.079> medium<00:01:52.290> shade<00:01:52.710> at

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
dark it was light to medium shade at

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.700 
dark it was light to medium shade at
best<00:01:53.189> and<00:01:53.840> when<00:01:54.840> I<00:01:54.869> washed<00:01:55.140> it<00:01:55.290> off<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.560> next

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
best and when I washed it off the next

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.389 
best and when I washed it off the next
day<00:01:55.860> there<00:01:56.070> was<00:01:56.100> streaks<00:01:56.700> already<00:01:57.180> on<00:01:57.420> my<00:01:57.630> legs

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 
day there was streaks already on my legs

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:00.740 
day there was streaks already on my legs
so<00:01:59.399> I<00:01:59.430> think<00:01:59.549> that<00:01:59.850> kind<00:02:00.090> of<00:02:00.180> had<00:02:00.360> something<00:02:00.659> to

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
so I think that kind of had something to

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.959 
so I think that kind of had something to
do<00:02:00.930> with<00:02:00.960> blending<00:02:01.829> it<00:02:01.920> in<00:02:02.070> it<00:02:02.310> took<00:02:02.640> forever

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
do with blending it in it took forever

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.770 
do with blending it in it took forever
to<00:02:03.390> blend<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.869> product<00:02:04.140> in<00:02:04.469> I<00:02:04.680> was<00:02:05.780> blending

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
to blend the product in I was blending

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.809 
to blend the product in I was blending
it<00:02:06.869> in<00:02:06.960> on<00:02:07.110> my<00:02:07.259> legs<00:02:07.500> for<00:02:07.649> about<00:02:07.950> 5<00:02:08.280> minutes<00:02:08.550> or

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
it in on my legs for about 5 minutes or

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.880 
it in on my legs for about 5 minutes or
more<00:02:09.030> until<00:02:09.360> I<00:02:09.390> couldn't<00:02:09.780> see<00:02:10.020> it<00:02:10.110> anymore<00:02:10.289> and

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
more until I couldn't see it anymore and

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.309 
more until I couldn't see it anymore and
that's<00:02:11.009> unusual<00:02:11.580> for<00:02:11.730> our<00:02:11.760> product<00:02:12.290> so<00:02:13.290> I

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
that's unusual for our product so I

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:14.100 
that's unusual for our product so I
think<00:02:13.440> that<00:02:13.770> kind

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
think that kind

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.370 
think that kind
made<00:02:14.500> it<00:02:14.650> streaky<00:02:15.100> the<00:02:15.250> next<00:02:15.550> day<00:02:15.700> and<00:02:16.380> it

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
made it streaky the next day and it

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.320 
made it streaky the next day and it
lasts<00:02:17.890> about<00:02:17.980> three<00:02:18.430> to<00:02:18.520> four<00:02:18.670> days<00:02:18.730> which<00:02:19.180> is

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
lasts about three to four days which is

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.810 
lasts about three to four days which is
about<00:02:19.600> average<00:02:19.810> and<00:02:20.800> like<00:02:20.950> I<00:02:21.070> said<00:02:21.280> it<00:02:21.520> fades

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
about average and like I said it fades

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.890 
about average and like I said it fades
streaky<00:02:22.480> too<00:02:22.720> so<00:02:23.440> it's<00:02:23.590> not<00:02:23.710> very<00:02:23.980> um<00:02:24.520> a<00:02:25.000> smooth

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
streaky too so it's not very um a smooth

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.160 
streaky too so it's not very um a smooth
looking<00:02:26.260> tan<00:02:26.500> I<00:02:26.530> wouldn't<00:02:26.890> say<00:02:27.010> it's<00:02:27.160> smooth

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
looking tan I wouldn't say it's smooth

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.170 
looking tan I wouldn't say it's smooth
it<00:02:29.170> does<00:02:29.470> like<00:02:29.890> I<00:02:30.010> said<00:02:30.220> it<00:02:30.610> does<00:02:30.910> come<00:02:31.150> with

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.170 
bottle is glittery which I do like but I
don't<00:02:38.830> think<00:02:39.100> that<00:02:39.280> men<00:02:39.670> would<00:02:39.850> like<00:02:40.030> this

patience for that I usually don't even
have<00:02:46.630> the<00:02:46.750> patience<00:02:47.200> for<00:02:47.230> messy<00:02:47.590> products<00:02:47.980> but
