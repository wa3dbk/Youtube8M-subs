00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:08.370
 welcome to my little one 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:11.849
 review about nicanor 300 the canoes 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:14.370
 300 is a volume model from the eos 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.400
 which is especially for the 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:21.119
 ambitious amateur photographers thought 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:26.460
 So no real high standards 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:27.480
 to processing or technology 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.090
 were 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:34.050
 you also always notice the device almost 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:38.730
 Compared to other models, it is 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.670
 rather sparse so comparable to the 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.020
 Plastic quality in the of 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.800
 Japanese vehicle that comes 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.200
 of course , the prayer here from Japan 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.610
 generally a common one 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.809
 appearance in this type of cameras 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.100
 is that these rubberized surfaces here 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:59.399
 become slightly sticky 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.620
 that means he is saving material 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.650
 that was still true back then 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.840
 an expensive camera in the sense but stop 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.260
 from the eros models within the eos 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.500
 row a volume model in large 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:16.290
 Number of which one not qualitatively 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.369
 Of course , it has a lot to expect 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.909
 Of course, like all others, it has its own 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:26.130
 reflex cameras from the principle of 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:29.579
 similar features it is here too 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.979
 again the big central council with the 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.439
 one that is the main programs and 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.540
 can switch 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:39.659
 as with other cameras from the first 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:43.280
 row with almost all we have here 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.280
 usual on an automatic program 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:51.390
 Delay preselection manually and 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:54.689
 depth of field program here is still 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:58.110
 another iso is the other way around 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:00.090
 imprint so you can manually so 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.720
 iso value of the film change there is 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.490
 the green window 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.030
 the fully automatic and there are the 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:12.430
 usual motivational portrait 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:14.260
 landscape macro sport and against not 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.870
 of course, as always, the view up here 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.450
 School have a camera here as well 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.430
 like his many first models only 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:25.150
 then automatically exits if they 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:27.400
 it is needed for the newer ones here 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.520
 times to focus or 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.650
 first time ever to do 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.840
 green ennstal a value joke 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:38.050
 folded up and the helpful light itself 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:40.420
 the one on the side is so far 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.520
 hard to simulate and see 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.459
 Here there is a small lamp that 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.990
 autofocus auxiliary light what the camera 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:50.530
 should enable autofocus 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:51.990
 Now you can shine as her 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.760
 see 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:57.370
 make the measurements if so 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.950
 a relative on ios ratios 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:03.640
 relatively small display what you like 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:05.290
 can see also reflects much you can 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:09.190
 really only vaguely recognize here 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:11.140
 that it is 90 at 4.0 we are here 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:14.170
 Suggests the usual two 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:17.230
 once the aster the keys 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:19.600
 makes little sense now because we are in 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:26.320
 fully automatic program are so go 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:29.200
 turn here on the time code here 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:31.090
 15 10 8 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.080
 At the same time, the iris changes 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:37.209
 flashing the aperture means total 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:41.440
 underexposure but that is due to the 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:43.150
 corresponding conditions here so 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.180
 at a quarter of this now with 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.980
 dazzling four and a half satisfied but already 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.170
 at a 60 seconds no longer with 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.660
 Aperture 4 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:55.630
 Here are buttons attached once 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:57.640
 Of course, the self-timer one 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:01.819
 Function key and that's the keys 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:04.069
 which allows us the measuring point resp 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:08.719
 Missing fields are here to select 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:11.060
 By default, of course, all seven 

00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:13.459
 measuring fields 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.530
 So that means you could be selective now 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:18.549
 new measurements or only on the right edge 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:26.720
 or on the left edge or wherever 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:30.590
 here the key with which we the 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:33.169
 can create exposure compensation whether 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:35.500
 this is a ios a conventional 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:38.780
 function 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:41.570
 We now want to once again the 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:43.520
 watch housing so remember this is in 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:45.820
 compared to other cases from the 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:57.169
 series, in fact , the least 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:05:00.289
 high quality lamella closure in front 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:02.870
 lightning just seen we look like each other 

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:04.759
 the lamellae but a little longer 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:07.970
 closing time of a quarter straight 

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:11.210
 open at the the usual back wall the 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:13.610
 it also came as a backlog with the data 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:17.300
 appropriate threading here 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:23.139
 of course, the feel for the denex 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:27.639
 coding with this model also here 

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:31.070
 a connection for the wired 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:35.180
 remote control and we have of course 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:37.400
 here are the buttons that allows us 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:41.060
 to fade out to see how the 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:45.050
 Depth of field is set we have 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:48.620
 Hidden here something hidden because the 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:52.009
 return button and just the 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:54.349
 slide switch for the opening of the 

00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:57.080
 relatively often one meets the rear housing 

00:05:54.349 --> 00:05:58.280
 that we have the appropriate mechanics 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.810
 if you look for example 

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:02.270
 needed camera that the 

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:03.770
 appropriate mechanics aborted here 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:05.720
 one sees it differently than at 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:07.880
 others rather hard to see but 

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:10.610
 you feel is to have if you go about it 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:12.770
 Here is a plastic part that is natural 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:14.360
 with such moving things sooner 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:16.130
 hindsight just when you do that 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:18.710
 professionally a few times already 

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:21.020
 close that also break off very quickly 

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:23.410
 this is certainly for a collection 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:26.750
 nice piece 

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:28.370
 if I necessarily so in the permanent use 

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:29.990
 if I'm more ambitious 

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:32.480
 hobby photographer on the go 

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:34.520
 I would like to take pictures 

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:37.360
 not with me she is frankly 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:41.360
 only in the showcase 

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:42.620
 it's a lightweight camera you have to 

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.630
 In any case say that 

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:48.650
 especially plastic is installed and 

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:50.750
 So little was laid on metal bed 

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:53.450
 Everything is plastic here 

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:55.370
 the only thing really shines out here 

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:58.490
 Metal seems to be the halter 

00:06:55.370 --> 00:07:02.780
 for the strap and the rails for the 

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:05.120
 Lightning therefore quite a useful one 

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:06.410
 camera she also makes nice pictures 

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:09.010
 Of course, she also has to deal with her 

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:09.010
 knowledge 

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:16.580
 sometimes on ebay for less than 20 euros without 

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:17.090
 Objectively including shipping costs too 

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:18.640
 to have 

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:21.380
 an enrichment for everyone 

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:24.460
 mirror reflex friend but just nothing 

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:24.460
 for high demands
