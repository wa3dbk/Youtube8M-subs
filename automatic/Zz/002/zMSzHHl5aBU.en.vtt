00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
guys the scar-h is probably the

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.109 
guys the scar-h is probably the
all-round<00:01:54.450> gun<00:01:54.720> it<00:01:55.290> is<00:01:55.530> far<00:01:56.189> range<00:01:56.460> it<00:01:56.700> it<00:01:56.850> is

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
all-round gun it is far range it it is

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.230 
all-round gun it is far range it it is
kind<00:01:57.420> of<00:01:57.479> powerful<00:01:57.799> but<00:01:58.799> it's<00:01:59.520> not<00:01:59.939> that

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
kind of powerful but it's not that

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.209 
kind of powerful but it's not that
powerful<00:02:00.479> a<00:02:00.810> long-range<00:02:01.439> it<00:02:01.829> will<00:02:01.920> take<00:02:02.070> about

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
powerful a long-range it will take about

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.490 
powerful a long-range it will take about
if<00:02:02.610> your<00:02:02.909> aim<00:02:03.030> is<00:02:03.060> pinpoint<00:02:03.719> then<00:02:04.350> you're

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
if your aim is pinpoint then you're

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.709 
if your aim is pinpoint then you're
perfectly<00:02:04.920> fine<00:02:05.159> but<00:02:05.820> if<00:02:05.939> you're<00:02:06.030> aiming<00:02:06.630> a

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
perfectly fine but if you're aiming a

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.540 
perfectly fine but if you're aiming a
bit<00:02:06.869> dodgy<00:02:07.049> and<00:02:07.409> like<00:02:07.649> yours<00:02:07.979> you're<00:02:08.399> not

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
bit dodgy and like yours you're not

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.010 
bit dodgy and like yours you're not
currently<00:02:09.060> but<00:02:09.239> basically<00:02:09.629> say<00:02:09.810> you're<00:02:09.929> not

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
currently but basically say you're not

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.990 
currently but basically say you're not
used<00:02:10.200> to<00:02:10.259> recall<00:02:10.739> of<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:10.920> gun<00:02:11.160> because<00:02:11.760> each

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
used to recall of the gun because each

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.400 
used to recall of the gun because each
gun<00:02:12.270> itself<00:02:12.780> has<00:02:12.989> got

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410
