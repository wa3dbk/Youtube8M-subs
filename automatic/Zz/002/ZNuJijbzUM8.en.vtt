00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
is fully incorporated into the cookie

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:47.569 
is fully incorporated into the cookie
crumbs<00:02:45.510> I'm<00:02:45.750> just<00:02:45.930> going<00:02:46.140> to<00:02:46.200> use<00:02:46.410> a<00:02:46.739> cookie

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:47.579 
crumbs I'm just going to use a cookie

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:51.069 
crumbs I'm just going to use a cookie
scoop<00:02:47.640> to<00:02:48.570> measure<00:02:48.989> out<00:02:49.230> the<00:02:49.410> portions<00:02:49.860> of<00:02:50.070> the

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:51.079 
scoop to measure out the portions of the

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:53.060 
scoop to measure out the portions of the
basically<00:02:52.079> of<00:02:52.260> the<00:02:52.350> batter<00:02:52.560> I<00:02:52.739> guess<00:02:52.920> you

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
basically of the batter I guess you

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.150 
basically of the batter I guess you
could<00:02:53.220> call<00:02:53.370> it<00:02:53.430> in<00:02:54.360> order<00:02:54.690> to<00:02:54.900> roll<00:02:55.620> equal

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
could call it in order to roll equal

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.050 
could call it in order to roll equal
sized<00:02:56.400> balls<00:02:58.280> so<00:02:59.280> once<00:02:59.430> I've<00:02:59.579> got<00:02:59.610> all<00:02:59.940> these

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
sized balls so once I've got all these

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.080 
sized balls so once I've got all these
balls<00:03:00.360> rolled<00:03:00.750> and<00:03:01.500> I<00:03:01.620> will<00:03:01.799> do<00:03:02.010> is<00:03:02.579> pop<00:03:02.880> them

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
balls rolled and I will do is pop them

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.080 
balls rolled and I will do is pop them
into<00:03:03.209> the<00:03:03.420> freezer<00:03:03.680> because<00:03:04.680> the<00:03:05.430> final<00:03:05.820> step

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
into the freezer because the final step

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.180 
into the freezer because the final step
is<00:03:06.299> to<00:03:06.329> coat<00:03:06.690> them<00:03:06.900> in<00:03:07.049> chocolate<00:03:07.260> and<00:03:07.739> I<00:03:08.160> just

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
is to coat them in chocolate and I just

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.610 
is to coat them in chocolate and I just
find<00:03:08.610> that<00:03:08.880> it's<00:03:09.600> a<00:03:09.750> little<00:03:09.989> bit<00:03:10.079> easier<00:03:10.260> if

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
find that it's a little bit easier if

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.130 
find that it's a little bit easier if
the<00:03:10.739> balls<00:03:10.980> are<00:03:11.160> cold<00:03:11.540> especially<00:03:12.540> if<00:03:12.900> there's

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
the balls are cold especially if there's

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.800 
the balls are cold especially if there's
any<00:03:13.320> like<00:03:13.590> flake<00:03:14.430> egde<00:03:14.640> that's<00:03:14.970> gonna<00:03:15.120> come

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
any like flake egde that's gonna come

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.630 
any like flake egde that's gonna come
off<00:03:15.989> of<00:03:16.260> the<00:03:16.350> balls<00:03:16.560> and<00:03:16.890> then<00:03:17.040> it<00:03:17.190> doesn't<00:03:17.519> get

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
off of the balls and then it doesn't get

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.819 
off of the balls and then it doesn't get
into<00:03:18.480> your<00:03:18.959> chocolate<00:03:19.140> that<00:03:19.440> you've<00:03:19.620> melted

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
into your chocolate that you've melted

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:28.240 
into your chocolate that you've melted
and<00:03:20.100> Derby<00:03:20.549> that<00:03:20.730> alone

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.860 

so<00:03:28.520> the<00:03:28.670> Oreo<00:03:28.940> truffles<00:03:29.000> have<00:03:29.450> all<00:03:29.630> been

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
so the Oreo truffles have all been

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:31.840 
so the Oreo truffles have all been
rolled<00:03:30.290> out<00:03:30.500> and<00:03:30.890> they're<00:03:31.340> ready<00:03:31.490> for<00:03:31.610> the

you're<00:03:50.660> going<00:03:50.900> to<00:03:51.080> slowly<00:03:51.350> add<00:03:51.590> additions<00:03:52.310> of

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:52.490 
you're going to slowly add additions of

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:55.660 
you're going to slowly add additions of
the<00:03:53.300> alcohol<00:03:53.900> I'm<00:03:54.440> going<00:03:54.620> to<00:03:54.710> start<00:03:55.040> with<00:03:55.280> 1

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
the alcohol I'm going to start with 1

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.360 
the alcohol I'm going to start with 1
tablespoon<00:03:56.450> and<00:03:56.870> what<00:03:57.710> you're<00:03:57.920> going<00:03:58.070> to<00:03:58.130> see

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
tablespoon and what you're going to see

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.240 
tablespoon and what you're going to see
happen<00:03:58.820> is<00:03:59.060> because<00:03:59.780> some<00:04:00.170> of<00:04:00.200> the<00:04:00.470> alcohol<00:04:00.770> is

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
happen is because some of the alcohol is

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.120 
happen is because some of the alcohol is
going<00:04:01.490> to<00:04:01.700> evaporate<00:04:02.510> that<00:04:03.410> is<00:04:03.590> going<00:04:03.770> to<00:04:03.860> cool

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.130 
going to evaporate that is going to cool

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:05.980 
going to evaporate that is going to cool
down<00:04:04.459> the<00:04:04.490> temperature<00:04:05.180> of<00:04:05.330> the<00:04:05.510> chocolate

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:05.990 
down the temperature of the chocolate

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:08.080 
down the temperature of the chocolate
and<00:04:06.110> so<00:04:06.530> it's<00:04:06.650> kind<00:04:06.890> of<00:04:06.950> going<00:04:07.070> to<00:04:07.160> re<00:04:07.400> solidify

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
and so it's kind of going to re solidify

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:09.490 
and so it's kind of going to re solidify
the<00:04:08.150> chocolate<00:04:08.720> just<00:04:08.870> slightly<00:04:09.170> and<00:04:09.350> it's

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
the chocolate just slightly and it's

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.070 
the chocolate just slightly and it's
going<00:04:09.620> to<00:04:09.680> turn<00:04:09.920> it<00:04:10.040> into<00:04:10.190> a<00:04:11.090> paste<00:04:11.720> like

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:12.080 
going to turn it into a paste like

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.890 
going to turn it into a paste like
texture<00:04:12.709> so<00:04:13.280> what<00:04:13.430> we<00:04:13.520> have<00:04:13.700> to<00:04:13.820> do<00:04:13.970> is<00:04:14.209> just<00:04:14.630> to

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
texture so what we have to do is just to

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.009 
texture so what we have to do is just to
counteract<00:04:15.260> that<00:04:15.590> is<00:04:15.950> keep<00:04:16.489> adding

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:17.019 
counteract that is keep adding

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:19.990 
counteract that is keep adding
increasing<00:04:18.019> amounts<00:04:18.530> of<00:04:18.590> the<00:04:18.950> alcohol<00:04:19.400> so<00:04:19.910> I'm

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
increasing amounts of the alcohol so I'm

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.490 
increasing amounts of the alcohol so I'm
going<00:04:20.120> to<00:04:20.180> just<00:04:20.299> do<00:04:20.510> it<00:04:20.540> by<00:04:20.750> the<00:04:20.810> tablespoon

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
going to just do it by the tablespoon

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.840 
going to just do it by the tablespoon
until<00:04:22.070> I<00:04:22.100> get<00:04:22.430> back<00:04:23.000> to<00:04:23.360> the<00:04:24.169> proper

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:24.850 
until I get back to the proper

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.670 
until I get back to the proper
consistency<00:04:25.850> in<00:04:26.510> order<00:04:26.870> to<00:04:27.080> dip<00:04:27.470> the

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
consistency in order to dip the

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.970 
consistency in order to dip the
chocolate<00:04:28.330> truffles<00:04:29.330> into<00:04:29.710> so<00:04:30.710> you<00:04:30.740> can<00:04:30.800> see

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:30.980 
chocolate truffles into so you can see

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:38.920 
chocolate truffles into so you can see
it's<00:04:31.130> getting<00:04:31.340> quite<00:04:31.669> stiff<00:04:32.000> again<00:04:37.660> and<00:04:38.660> if

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
it's getting quite stiff again and if

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:42.730 
it's getting quite stiff again and if
you<00:04:39.050> don't<00:04:39.290> want<00:04:39.530> to<00:04:40.240> add<00:04:41.240> the<00:04:41.270> alcohol<00:04:42.080> or<00:04:42.620> you

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
you don't want to add the alcohol or you

completely and you can just dip the

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:51.430 
completely and you can just dip the
truffles<00:04:49.250> in<00:04:49.510> the<00:04:50.510> chocolate<00:04:50.960> right<00:04:51.140> when<00:04:51.320> it

I'm drying them or letting them drip off

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.780 
I'm drying them or letting them drip off
on<00:05:29.450> what<00:05:30.020> is<00:05:30.169> called<00:05:30.380> a<00:05:30.620> drying<00:05:31.220> rack<00:05:31.370> or<00:05:31.760> a

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:31.790 
on what is called a drying rack or a

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:34.659 
on what is called a drying rack or a
cooling<00:05:32.180> rack<00:05:32.210> for<00:05:32.750> your<00:05:33.290> baked<00:05:33.530> goods<00:05:33.680> so<00:05:34.160> you

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:34.669 
cooling rack for your baked goods so you

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:36.250 
cooling rack for your baked goods so you
don't<00:05:34.910> end<00:05:35.060> up<00:05:35.210> with<00:05:35.270> the<00:05:35.810> little<00:05:36.050> feet

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:36.260 
don't end up with the little feet

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.380 
don't end up with the little feet
underneath<00:05:36.830> and<00:05:37.070> it<00:05:37.669> can<00:05:37.820> just<00:05:37.970> drip<00:05:38.210> right

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:38.390 
underneath and it can just drip right

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:40.120 
underneath and it can just drip right
through<00:05:38.630> and<00:05:38.990> while<00:05:39.200> it's<00:05:39.349> still<00:05:39.590> wet<00:05:39.830> of

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:40.130 
through and while it's still wet of

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:41.740 
through and while it's still wet of
course<00:05:40.970> you<00:05:41.210> can't<00:05:41.450> have

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:41.750 
course you can't have

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:43.330 
course you can't have
anything<00:05:42.290> that's<00:05:42.440> called<00:05:42.710> birthday<00:05:43.100> cake

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:43.340 
anything that's called birthday cake

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:45.990 
anything that's called birthday cake
without<00:05:44.180> having<00:05:44.690> birthday<00:05:45.230> sprinkles<00:05:45.710> on<00:05:45.860> it

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:46.000 
without having birthday sprinkles on it

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.730 
without having birthday sprinkles on it
so<00:05:47.000> you<00:05:47.600> want<00:05:47.750> to<00:05:47.840> put<00:05:47.990> that<00:05:48.110> on<00:05:48.170> while<00:05:48.590> it's

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:48.740 
so you want to put that on while it's

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:53.440 
so you want to put that on while it's
wet<00:05:49.420> so<00:05:50.420> they<00:05:50.540> stick<00:05:50.840> to<00:05:51.020> the<00:05:51.110> chocolate<00:05:52.450> so
