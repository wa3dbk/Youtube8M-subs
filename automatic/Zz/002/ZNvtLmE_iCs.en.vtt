00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.120
 hi to all with that of tess 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:10.940
 mobile.fr I am at mwc 2015 at 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.709
 huawei g in the hand the huawei watch the 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.270
 huawei's first smartwatch we had 

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:15.500
 already seen activity trackers of 

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:17.360
 things like that but this is the 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:21.130
 first smart touch to speak 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:23.180
 with a no watch design then a 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:26.000
 first thing to know is that 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.380
 tension if you find it nice if you 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.200
 are completely seduced by the product 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.329
 sachets not know though that the 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:35.750
 huawei 's ouache will only happen 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:37.670
 in France only q3 third quarter 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:41.390
 2015 we have a price still unannounced 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:44.030
 so here it is again this is a 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.320
 proto it will evolve a priori maybe 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.390
 not necessarily in terms of design but in 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.610
 terms of software and so here you are 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.380
 good if you like it so much better but 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.520
 it will have to be patient then there is 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.720
 different versions and you see 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.690
 behind full of grace let's 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.910
 18 mm bracelets it's a watch they have 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.730
 studied the size is sondhi bomb at 40 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.260
 its 42 mm diameter it is the right 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.509
 size apparently so they left 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.920
 on it and there are different versions 

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:08.530
 I can not show everything to you there me 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.579
 I have the black version which is not very 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:13.039
 practice of the video shot because we 

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:14.509
 not see much but there are others 

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:16.909
 editions including ker bracelet in 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:18.950
 real leather apparently this kind of 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:20.509
 things that can be it can be very 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.759
 very very nice to show you maybe 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:23.929
 we'll do a second video on the 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:25.189
 stand I will try to shift me a 

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:26.539
 little for not getting me in because 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:27.829
 that there are a lot of people around 

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:30.409
 me everyone is very interested in 

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:32.539
 this this new product then new 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:33.709
 products yes we will spend on design 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:36.229
 but afterwards for the rest it's 

00:01:33.709 --> 00:01:36.740
 android were so it's very very very 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:40.009
 basic 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.909
 so we'll go around but here we go 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:43.939
 I told you we 're going inside 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:45.770
 then on the right side we have a button 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:47.509
 dedicated who is right here here you are the 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.249
 see I press it it allows me a 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:52.459
 priori to go back 

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:54.919
 that's the first thing here to nothing 

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:56.419
 aluminum it is a little thick 1 you 

00:01:54.919 --> 00:01:57.829
 see it's still pretty sturdy 

00:01:56.419 --> 00:01:59.689
 must still enter the 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:01.340
 components in these products there you go 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:03.679
 bowl is not always obvious and 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.810
 behind then there you see absolutely 

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:09.050
 nothing but there is a 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.940
 so here you see it there is a dock a 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.340
 small connectors for for dock 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.270
 to recharge it and a 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.650
 heart rate monitor that's right 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.970
 behind I can not at all you 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.660
 show you see him he's just 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:23.090
 behind this is a bracelet 18 mm he me 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.710
 seems that's it yeah standard it's not 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.230
 if yeah it's a little bit more and 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:29.900
 thinner than the 22 beats that's it and so 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.250
 there aluminum steel I do not know 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.280
 too much what it's pretty much a 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.600
 fixing like that a little bit a little 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.760
 atypical I do not know how to do 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.300
 to work his a6 is like that you 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.630
 here 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.680
 yes ok sir louis who confirmed me 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.740
 side that's how good we are 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.940
 use and then down for the interface 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.920
 I make it brief 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:53.090
 what will be interesting is especially 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:56.240
 the sealed watch weiss so how does that 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:59.000
 is happening already how is it going already 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.770
 for the for watch butt I want 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.530
 not to do anything stupid I think it takes 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:05.870
 stay here we are going to do that so 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.900
 fashion sunlights we will stick a little 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:12.050
 then we'll see wait if I do 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:13.580
 saint-henri dish is ok we're going all 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.290
 take off right here you have your 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.960
 notifications that arrives from 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:20.450
 of android compatible of course only 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:21.920
 android if I'm not mistaken for that matter 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.600
 on that I have a slight doubt and then 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.210
 after you have a few watts things 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.600
 who are very successful I find that 

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:28.760
 it is 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.740
 it's very nice they worked that there 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.180
 on it they worked that thoroughly and 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.500
 the screen is very nice there is something that 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.080
 I do not mention it is that it is a 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:38.300
 screen with a definition of 400 by 400 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.110
 with a pixel density of almost 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.670
 300 countries 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.220
 it's the highest today on a 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:46.819
 smart switch on android ware and suddenly 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:48.880
 well it shows what's good for you 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:52.460
 something very very very pretty 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.770
 voice the ice I think she is in 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:56.000
 demo mode too so 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:58.910
 So here we are not going to be able to go 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.170
 to be able to grab the jioi you see the gg 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.280
 gilles emo mode so I'm not going to you 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.810
 show the different whiteface 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.420
 I would have liked because one 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.980
 exclusive quarantine exclusive 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:09.580
 I do not know if it's feminine or a 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:11.410
 watch watch be 0 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.000
 exclusive to huawei so that it can be 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.230
 really nice the control of course 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.230
 the music is going like this finally 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:19.540
 good here is a beautiful screen a beautiful design a 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:20.860
 product that is ip certified if I get 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:25.030
 I'm trying to find that 

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:27.190
 weighs 67 actually that's it and that a 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.870
 kikwete and a nice design and who 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.250
 the air was rather successful so we will follow it 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.740
 closely we will attest when she 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.450
 will come out in France that's if you have any 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:37.290
 questions of course do not hesitate and then 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:37.290
 I tell you next time
