 the transition of mankind will go into 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:04:00.210
 energy form of existence 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:04.210
 the transition will be 

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:07.740
 it was before it will be with us now 

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:08.860
 were the golden age of silver and bronze 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:11.020
 iron 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:15.730
 now on its end iron 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:18.070
 century and we we have to go go to 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.989
 the golden age we still see whether the pen 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:24.460
 have we have will start a new round and 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:28.950
 we have to get up well what are the wheels 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:32.470
 Samsara website and climb a new round 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:34.639
 for this for this we are going now 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:37.679
 above this knowledge 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:39.929
 scientists do not deny the transition to a new 

00:04:37.679 --> 00:04:40.999
 level for human civilization 

00:04:39.929 --> 00:04:44.219
 inevitable 

00:04:40.999 --> 00:04:47.249
 we are waiting for global man-made 

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:49.169
 and environmental disasters modern 

00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:51.319
 devices are so complicated 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:54.739
 that potentially have power 

00:04:51.319 --> 00:04:57.319
 comparable forces of natural elements and 

00:04:54.739 --> 00:05:00.119
 ordinary accident can turn out 

00:04:57.319 --> 00:05:04.649
 environmental disaster planetary 

00:05:00.119 --> 00:05:07.079
 scale there is a theory that highly developed 

00:05:04.649 --> 00:05:09.689
 civilizations are man-made they get sick and 

00:05:07.079 --> 00:05:12.049
 horse then die from such 

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:14.429
 disasters that do not generate themselves 

00:05:12.049 --> 00:05:16.619
 Vernadsky expressed the idea that 

00:05:14.429 --> 00:05:18.929
 humanity taken as a whole becomes 

00:05:16.619 --> 00:05:21.769
 powerful geological force 

00:05:18.929 --> 00:05:24.659
 this power is the mind of man 

00:05:21.769 --> 00:05:29.249
 aspired and organized will of his 

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:31.769
 as being public today 

00:05:29.249 --> 00:05:33.929
 it is considered that but the sphere is collective 

00:05:31.769 --> 00:05:37.039
 consciousness that will control 

00:05:33.929 --> 00:05:39.149
 direction of the future evolution of the planet and 

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:43.860
 merge with the universe 

00:05:39.149 --> 00:05:46.739
 forming a holistic but organism if 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:48.959
 earlier technology mostly and technology 

00:05:46.739 --> 00:05:51.619
 have worked on changing someone 

00:05:48.959 --> 00:05:54.209
 around the building 

00:05:51.619 --> 00:05:56.099
 city ​​cars all this change 

00:05:54.209 --> 00:05:59.039
 environment around the person for the first time 

00:05:56.099 --> 00:06:02.009
 the opportunity to start some 

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:04.079
 actions already on changing biology itself 

00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:08.039
 man himself to seek inner peace 

00:06:04.079 --> 00:06:10.889
 and then these moments seem very 

00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:12.719
 important and having a whopping 

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:14.579
 last consequences for the future and 

00:06:12.719 --> 00:06:16.490
 human and humanity and civilization 

00:06:14.579 --> 00:06:18.510
 of our social networks 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:21.030
 technological progress does not stand on 

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:23.940
 the place has already become a reality 

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:27.150
 artificial cells managed prostheses 

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:29.700
 limbs and even made the first steps to 

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:31.460
 creating an electronic device in 

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:36.930
 which can be transplanted 

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:38.730
 person dying person by 

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:40.170
 Some say so presentation 

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:42.750
 we can say that, in principle, figured out 

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:44.670
 what is life a product is that we are not 

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:46.550
 we know where she came from now 

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:48.920
 quite well imagine how 

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:52.190
 it works and it works 

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:55.080
 Of course in this area we are waiting for the most 

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:59.030
 incredible achievements can be said 

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:59.030
 discoveries and on the result
