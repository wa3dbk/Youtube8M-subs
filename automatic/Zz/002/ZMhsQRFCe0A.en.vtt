he has to yawn and stretch because he's

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:51.760 
he has to yawn and stretch because he's
reading<00:02:50.840> his<00:02:50.930> book<00:02:51.140> and<00:02:51.260> he's<00:02:51.380> very<00:02:51.440> tired

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.770 
reading his book and he's very tired
