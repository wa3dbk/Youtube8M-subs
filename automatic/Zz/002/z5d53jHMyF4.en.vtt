00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:13.480
 I am pleasantly surprised by your 

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:16.119
 presence are working with us 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.109
 problem is that this thank you for 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:19.929
 angeletti 

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:23.819
 the first is the first opportunity more in 

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:26.409
 contact that of the car land and neither 

00:00:23.819 --> 00:00:29.159
 pleasure to face true side not 

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:32.230
 are nothing more than stable centenarians of 

00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:35.560
 verona begins to live just these 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:37.870
 days and until October there are but 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.820
 more events are perhaps even more 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.340
 an important classic for her 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:47.590
 important then I go back to doing mine 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:51.829
 craft after years of two areas of 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:56.960
 sanremo profile made serious is that 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:01:00.149
 so it will be rather 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:03.000
 exciting for me to get close to that 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:06.479
 day in the constitution 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.729
 the idea of â€‹â€‹having a large orchestra that 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:12.300
 finally a thing that accompanies me 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.940
 a first time forever had neither 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:18.659
 sell or even 100's granted by 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:21.420
 sun with a guitar or some 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.910
 time I happened to have a big one 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:31.170
 orchestra but as we know it is not there yet 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:35.399
 a new goal will be a new one 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:37.790
 new desire to measure up to sing 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:39.800
 sing above all 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:42.100
 the last few years contact with the others 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.100
 what's this 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.740
 what can I add 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:51.619
 maybe with some questions of yours 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:55.159
 we make lavoce.info count has worked 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:57.229
 among other things, a concept that I did eight 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:03.890
 years ago they did just like one 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:08.149
 ship direct or indirect view of the 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:12.620
 world years ago last year channel 5 ha 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:22.220
 resumed its object us 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:24.549
 we hoped they were the guests 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:29.060
 the trio run very far towards him 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:33.170
 can try I would like to invite some 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:36.480
 artist who is on pole with a single with 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.519
 which I have shared in these 50 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.680
 the iconic artists who have the names a 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:48.810
 to fly that I take away from another 's 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:51.340
 cultivation, however, it is necessary to raise them 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:54.950
 provide lines are 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:56.840
 there are so many we also give those who have 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.959
 wish 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:02.510
 was built really reason am 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:06.769
 preparing 40 songs the arrangements 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:09.370
 they are surely all different 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:12.849
 therefore changed changed in short 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:20.450
 adapted to an orchestra of 110 people 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:21.260
 center to those who sell more and therefore there is 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.239
 to work a lot 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.280
 the shift that has ever theoria you did not 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:29.060
 never done concerts but not maximum 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:33.319
 strange animal malaman because it is one 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:37.790
 mention of anticipating some authors 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:41.959
 these words I learned a bit 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:43.730
 listen to the song selection 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:46.610
 songs form the center 's genes the thing 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:51.829
 because if he had a hard time then he found himself 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:54.709
 to compose we are another between 0 and then 

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:56.329
 many songs that have gone by 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:58.940
 traverso facebook 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:04:00.450
 it will seem strange but in short through the 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:03.650
 my part of me 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:08.280
 against at least 500 proposals of which 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:12.150
 300 just ignored them by 200 that 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:14.519
 say 180 mediocre and twenty 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:17.269
 interested then some track is 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:20.070
 also came out of young people 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:22.350
 but then for a single decision 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.450
 will come first if you define it 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:29.310
 I wish it was a sero to get out first 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:32.210
 also because I think we can maraglio 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.210
 return to the cinema
