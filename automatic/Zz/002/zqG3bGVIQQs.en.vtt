00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
them up giving it a clip so I picked

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.020 
them up giving it a clip so I picked
both<00:02:25.870> ends<00:02:26.470> you<00:02:26.950> went<00:02:27.160> through<00:02:27.280> in<00:02:27.460> doing<00:02:27.850> that

phone creating a winding armature that
will<00:03:14.709> encase<00:03:15.160> all<00:03:15.580> the<00:03:15.970> dahlias

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:28.140 

for<00:03:25.209> the<00:03:25.329> flowers<00:03:26.200> the<00:03:26.680> echinacea<00:03:27.280> pods<00:03:27.730> are

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
for the flowers the echinacea pods are

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.229 
for the flowers the echinacea pods are
used<00:03:28.450> just<00:03:28.689> as<00:03:28.930> a<00:03:28.959> basing<00:03:29.680> material<00:03:30.239> tufting

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 
used just as a basing material tufting

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:34.649 
used just as a basing material tufting
them<00:03:31.420> very<00:03:31.810> close<00:03:32.319> to<00:03:32.650> the<00:03:32.769> base<00:03:33.659> creating

00:03:34.649 --> 00:03:34.659 
them very close to the base creating

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:39.179 
them very close to the base creating
texture<00:03:35.560> and<00:03:35.799> impact<00:03:36.459> and<00:03:37.060> also<00:03:37.980> covering<00:03:38.980> up

00:03:39.179 --> 00:03:39.189 
texture and impact and also covering up

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:41.459 
texture and impact and also covering up
part<00:03:39.370> of<00:03:39.670> the<00:03:39.790> foam<00:03:40.060> so<00:03:40.629> it's<00:03:40.750> all<00:03:40.900> concealed

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:41.469 
part of the foam so it's all concealed

00:03:41.469 --> 00:03:43.979 
part of the foam so it's all concealed
so<00:03:42.099> all<00:03:42.310> of<00:03:42.519> those<00:03:42.700> will<00:03:42.909> be<00:03:42.939> just<00:03:43.269> tufted<00:03:43.840> it's

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
so all of those will be just tufted it's

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:48.059 
so all of those will be just tufted it's
downward<00:03:44.680> way<00:03:45.670> low<00:03:46.209> as<00:03:46.659> a<00:03:47.049> visual<00:03:47.530> support

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:48.069 
downward way low as a visual support

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:51.720 
downward way low as a visual support
then<00:03:48.849> the<00:03:48.879> dahlias<00:03:49.739> left<00:03:50.739> a<00:03:50.889> little<00:03:51.069> longer

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
then the dahlias left a little longer

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.569 
then the dahlias left a little longer
giving<00:03:52.659> them<00:03:52.810> a<00:03:52.840> cut<00:03:53.230> and<00:03:53.859> then<00:03:53.920> inserting

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:54.579 
giving them a cut and then inserting

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:56.849 
giving them a cut and then inserting
them<00:03:54.730> into<00:03:54.760> the<00:03:55.090> foam<00:03:55.420> so<00:03:56.200> that<00:03:56.230> they<00:03:56.409> go<00:03:56.620> in

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:56.859 
them into the foam so that they go in

00:03:56.859 --> 00:04:00.839 
them into the foam so that they go in
quite<00:03:57.310> far<00:03:57.639> a<00:03:57.970> good<00:03:58.480> two<00:03:58.870> inches<00:03:59.700> that<00:04:00.700> way

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:00.849 
quite far a good two inches that way

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:02.220 
quite far a good two inches that way
they'll<00:04:01.030> be<00:04:01.090> down<00:04:01.419> in<00:04:01.599> the<00:04:01.629> water<00:04:01.930> reservoir

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
they'll be down in the water reservoir

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:09.679 
they'll be down in the water reservoir
and<00:04:02.859> drink<00:04:03.250> well<00:04:04.379> bring<00:04:05.379> some<00:04:05.739> down<00:04:05.950> very<00:04:06.459> low

00:04:09.679 --> 00:04:09.689 

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:13.860 

some<00:04:10.689> up<00:04:10.930> a<00:04:11.049> little<00:04:11.260> higher<00:04:12.510> radiating<00:04:13.510> all

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
some up a little higher radiating all

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.020 
some up a little higher radiating all
the<00:04:14.079> way<00:04:14.230> around<00:04:14.769> so<00:04:15.459> you<00:04:15.549> get<00:04:15.639> a<00:04:15.700> full<00:04:16.000> and

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
the way around so you get a full and

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.430 
the way around so you get a full and
lush<00:04:16.449> look<00:04:16.900> I<00:04:17.759> have<00:04:18.759> moving<00:04:19.449> the<00:04:19.630> grasses<00:04:20.199> and
