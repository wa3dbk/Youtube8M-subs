 to demonstrate the superiority of the club michel guyot 33 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.190
 on its predecessor the tire Michelin Pilot too 2 in terms of braking 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:35.490
 this wet coating 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:39.790
 dekra test center independent body specialized in testing 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.990
 of vehicles and realistic equipment for michelin a comparative test of 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:45.880
 two tires 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.170
 the text unfold on copiously watered tracks 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.909
 some of which have a low level of adhesion 

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:55.009
 like this one for example with a little chair coating 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.250
 a braking distance recorder 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.850
 and sensors evaluate the pressure exerted on the front brake lever and 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.950
 the signal adsl the front wheel are installed on the motorcycle

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:46.930
 while disengaging 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.520
 the pilot triggers the ABS braking from the cone reuters 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.720
 the measurement taken 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.680
 and the distance traveled to go from 50 kilometers per hour to the full stop 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.880
 the result and without appeal 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.679
 the tire Michelin Pilot 33 with the bike five meters before the tire Michelin 

00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:18.679
 pilot promoted two on this track 

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:28.790
 these slats 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.220
 which cuts the film back and so powerful that stores the water before evacuation 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:35.999
 to compensate for the lack of grip of the coating made particularly 

00:02:35.999 --> 00:02:38.169
 slippery 

00:02:38.169 --> 00:02:41.169
 standing 

00:02:41.889 --> 00:02:44.820
 and in more common conditions on a simple wet road 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.820
 the gap with his predecessor was still 2 meters 50 

00:02:48.999 --> 00:02:52.489
 powerful braking repeated ten times per tire and the measurements are 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:54.419
 carried out on several wet tracks 

00:02:54.419 --> 00:02:57.449
 representing different degrees of defense 

00:02:57.449 --> 00:03:00.799
 the grip level is low plus the speed is high 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:03.259
 and more the tire Michelin Pilot 33
