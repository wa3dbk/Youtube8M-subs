00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:01.879
 the harmonica 

00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:06.800
 she is like the accordion among other things a representative of the hand train 

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.589
 instruments 

00:00:08.589 --> 00:00:13.650
 the harmonica differs from the accordion among other things by the 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.599
 sees the nuclear business that is the ebike corpses push of a button 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:20.890
 which is approx 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.890
 another case occurs 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.490
 So she brings out 2 tones at the push of a button that Heikki 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.440
 the accordion, on the other hand, produces both times 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.440
 in the district of Steinfurt 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.240
 The accordion is available as a Knaup 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.980
 Keys accordion 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.900
 The latter is also called a piano accordion 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.130
 a harmonica has consisted of the tests Kant part 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.990
 the ball 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.990
 the parties 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:08.770
 in that Haye can play the tune and that is enough through a total of 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.650
 agrees pieces 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.250
 the depth leads the test can eg with Detlef Kant scarcely 4 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.580
 By pressing the buttons one directs the air Tiemann supplies by bike 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.690
 purposefully to support the corresponding voting cards in the votes 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.980
 by the vibrations of each one is already correct 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.980
 Plato generated 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.640
 to make the Stephanie important to set up her preference 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.300
 Stripping pulls 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.030
 against a tree 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:41.240
 to become clear 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.190
 do not look in the cards 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.080
 and after a good game 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.060
 and 55 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.060
 help here holding in hand agrees 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.010
 then the voting cards are matched to the previously prepared stock 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:01.460
 grew up 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.450
 For this purpose, a work is used that was chosen in its composition 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.450
 that is possible he holds 

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:20.039
 The substance consists of three choirs of reason 

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:22.499
 the tremolo 

00:02:22.499 --> 00:02:25.499
 and that would have to 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:27.930
 by growing up 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.340
 Toni's mood changes slightly, that means you still have to 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.340
 no vote-buying child so-called playmaker 

00:02:39.779 --> 00:02:43.170
 in the treble part is also true pieces 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.609
 still the mechanics 

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:48.049
 the opponents can connect with the skimpy 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:52.180
 the tight and missed before to seal and Dr 

00:02:59.229 --> 00:03:03.939
 The almost 5 are connected to the mechanics 17 for example 

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:06.579
 that fits in part 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:09.659
 Place mostly heals serves the accompaniment 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:13.150
 Of course, the people looking for a parking space are taller than the cards on the table 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.150
 came 

00:03:25.669 --> 00:03:30.629
 on many models of the harmonica, so-called Chahed judges sit at Balsthal 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:31.969
 mostly, however 

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:35.329
 she takes only the better look 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:38.489
 between base and this may be the price of Sky 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:43.370
 after Oberndorf had been on the so-called stars initially with 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.089
 Glued drugs 

00:03:45.089 --> 00:03:45.939
 therefor 

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:50.349
 One uses victories of any choice is soft and is better at movements 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:53.349
 adapts and thus poet Stevens 

00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:57.899
 then a special something is stuck the paper 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:01.959
 This process is called concealment 

00:04:08.749 --> 00:04:12.839
 to give the ball its final shape because the press is brought 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.960
 then the messages are put on 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.780
 after he was finished with leather and the frame was beefed up the 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.240
 Frankfurter 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.660
 my harmonica 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.660
 consists of several hundred parts 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.400
 before the examining attack 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.199
 he is named after the instruments in the gravel bed 

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:50.180
 France team company name matches 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.360
 glued 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.500
 they heard 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.500
 Cologne the manufacturer for quality 

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:12.939
 and to be able to play the harmonica is more 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.539
 or less game practice 

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:21.139
 Grand Prix with playing harmonica a drink that he in the annals 

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:23.110
 entertained and that comes now
