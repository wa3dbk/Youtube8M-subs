it is a really nice mid pocket really

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.490 
it is a really nice mid pocket really
deep<00:00:51.270> probably<00:00:51.539> about<00:00:51.719> two<00:00:51.899> balls<00:00:52.140> deep<00:00:52.320> maybe

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
deep probably about two balls deep maybe

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.970 
deep probably about two balls deep maybe
a<00:00:52.649> little<00:00:52.739> more<00:00:53.899> with<00:00:54.899> a<00:00:55.140> really<00:00:55.739> great

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
a little more with a really great

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.520 
a little more with a really great
channel<00:00:56.370> for<00:00:56.399> goalies<00:00:56.879> I<00:00:56.910> found<00:00:57.420> that<00:00:57.570> from<00:00:58.440> my

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
channel for goalies I found that from my

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.720 
channel for goalies I found that from my
experience<00:00:58.559> from<00:00:58.949> cogs<00:00:59.219> a<00:00:59.309> lot<00:00:59.489> of<00:00:59.579> goalies

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
experience from cogs a lot of goalies

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.760 
experience from cogs a lot of goalies
that<00:01:00.030> channels<00:01:00.420> in<00:01:01.020> goalie<00:01:01.379> sticks<00:01:01.590> don't

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
that channels in goalie sticks don't

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.770 
that channels in goalie sticks don't
need<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:01.980> be<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.160> tightest<00:01:02.550> ever<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:03.600> East

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
need to be the tightest ever the East

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.660 
need to be the tightest ever the East
Coast<00:01:03.960> mesh<00:01:04.140> gives<00:01:04.320> you<00:01:04.530> a<00:01:04.710> lot<00:01:05.250> of<00:01:05.369> rebound

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
Coast mesh gives you a lot of rebound

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.630 
Coast mesh gives you a lot of rebound
control<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.270> it's<00:01:06.390> going<00:01:06.479> to<00:01:06.570> break<00:01:06.780> in

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
control and it's going to break in

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.120 
control and it's going to break in
really<00:01:08.640> really<00:01:08.729> nicely<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.390> so<00:01:10.010> while<00:01:11.010> the

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
really really nicely and so while the

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.859 
really really nicely and so while the
pattern<00:01:11.490> is<00:01:11.670> pretty<00:01:12.030> simple<00:01:12.270> I<00:01:12.450> think<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.689> pod

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
pattern is pretty simple I think the pod

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.390 
pattern is pretty simple I think the pod
is<00:01:13.049> pretty<00:01:13.200> much<00:01:13.320> perfect<00:01:13.560> I<00:01:13.950> found<00:01:14.220> if<00:01:14.369> you

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
is pretty much perfect I found if you

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.960 
is pretty much perfect I found if you
make<00:01:14.720> goalie<00:01:15.720> sticks<00:01:16.110> too<00:01:16.920> defined<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:17.729> if

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
make goalie sticks too defined and if

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.310 
make goalie sticks too defined and if
you<00:01:18.030> make<00:01:18.180> them<00:01:18.240> too<00:01:18.299> channel<00:01:18.780> they<00:01:18.900> get<00:01:19.140> too

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
you make them too channel they get too

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.410 
you make them too channel they get too
defined<00:01:19.650> and<00:01:19.950> it<00:01:20.430> makes<00:01:20.610> it<00:01:20.759> really<00:01:20.970> abrupt

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
defined and it makes it really abrupt

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.179 
defined and it makes it really abrupt
pocket<00:01:21.810> it's<00:01:21.990> not<00:01:22.170> able<00:01:22.290> to<00:01:22.409> release<00:01:22.740> smoothly

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
pocket it's not able to release smoothly

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.130 
pocket it's not able to release smoothly
so<00:01:24.180> that<00:01:24.210> is<00:01:24.509> really<00:01:24.689> what<00:01:24.810> I'm<00:01:24.930> trying<00:01:25.110> to

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
so that is really what I'm trying to

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.800 
so that is really what I'm trying to
balance<00:01:25.350> with<00:01:25.590> this<00:01:25.740> pocket<00:01:26.189> so<00:01:27.180> like<00:01:27.479> I<00:01:27.600> said

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
balance with this pocket so like I said

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.800 
balance with this pocket so like I said
is<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.049> STX<00:01:28.439> eclipse<00:01:28.860> it<00:01:29.670> has<00:01:29.790> an<00:01:29.939> 11<00:01:30.329> diamond

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
is the STX eclipse it has an 11 diamond

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.630 
is the STX eclipse it has an 11 diamond
top<00:01:30.990> string<00:01:31.320> I'll<00:01:31.829> cover<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.250> little<00:01:32.430> bit<00:01:32.520> more

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
top string I'll cover a little bit more

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.920 
top string I'll cover a little bit more
about<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.880> texture<00:01:33.150> whether<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.600> side<00:01:33.780> web

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
about the texture whether the side web

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.200 
about the texture whether the side web
story<00:01:34.170> also<00:01:34.290> now<00:01:34.560> so<00:01:35.369> you<00:01:35.460> guys<00:01:35.640> have<00:01:35.820> a<00:01:35.850> string

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
story also now so you guys have a string

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.140 
story also now so you guys have a string
the<00:01:36.509> sidewall<00:01:37.229> for<00:01:37.470> this<00:01:37.590> stick<00:01:38.000> alright<00:01:39.000> guys

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
the sidewall for this stick alright guys

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.190 
the sidewall for this stick alright guys
so<00:01:39.360> now<00:01:39.479> we're<00:01:39.600> going<00:01:39.720> to<00:01:39.780> learn<00:01:39.930> how<00:01:40.170> to

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
so now we're going to learn how to

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.960 
so now we're going to learn how to
string<00:01:40.740> it<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:41.040> sidewall<00:01:41.549> it's<00:01:41.670> a<00:01:41.759> really

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
string it the sidewall it's a really

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.160 
string it the sidewall it's a really
simple<00:01:42.090> pattern<00:01:42.570> I<00:01:42.689> think<00:01:42.899> you<00:01:42.960> guys<00:01:43.140> are

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
simple pattern I think you guys are

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.469 
simple pattern I think you guys are
really<00:01:43.500> gonna<00:01:43.680> like<00:01:43.740> but<00:01:44.610> first<00:01:44.970> let's<00:01:45.270> talk

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
really gonna like but first let's talk

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.200 
really gonna like but first let's talk
about<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.930> top<00:01:46.140> string<00:01:46.439> so<00:01:46.649> this<00:01:46.799> is<00:01:47.210> 12

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
about the top string so this is 12

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.840 
about the top string so this is 12
diamond<00:01:48.600> East<00:01:48.780> Coast<00:01:48.990> mesh<00:01:49.259> and<00:01:49.530> for<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.399> STX

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
diamond East Coast mesh and for the STX

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.690 
diamond East Coast mesh and for the STX
Eclipse<00:01:51.299> I've<00:01:51.509> used<00:01:52.110> an<00:01:52.290> 11-9<00:01:52.770> mint<00:01:53.159> option<00:01:53.610> as

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
Eclipse I've used an 11-9 mint option as

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.399 
Eclipse I've used an 11-9 mint option as
you<00:01:53.729> can<00:01:53.939> see<00:01:54.119> there<00:01:54.420> is<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:54.869> center<00:01:55.229> diamond

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
you can see there is the center diamond

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.670 
you can see there is the center diamond
and<00:01:55.799> then<00:01:56.520> it<00:01:56.610> has<00:01:56.729> five<00:01:57.119> on<00:01:57.479> each<00:01:58.200> side<00:01:58.500> of<00:01:58.619> the

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
and then it has five on each side of the

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.109 
and then it has five on each side of the
center<00:01:58.890> diamond<00:01:59.130> and<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.520> center<00:01:59.759> diamond<00:01:59.880> is

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
center diamond and the center diamond is

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.100 
center diamond and the center diamond is
lined<00:02:00.329> up<00:02:00.479> right<00:02:01.290> with<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.860> middle<00:02:02.280> of<00:02:03.110> that

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
lined up right with the middle of that

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.230 
lined up right with the middle of that
center<00:02:04.469> hole<00:02:04.500> so<00:02:04.890> it's<00:02:05.070> one<00:02:05.820> in<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:05.969> middle

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
center hole so it's one in the middle

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.660 
center hole so it's one in the middle
file<00:02:06.780> on<00:02:06.930> each<00:02:07.049> side<00:02:07.320> so<00:02:07.350> 11<00:02:07.950> diamonds<00:02:08.310> total

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
file on each side so 11 diamonds total

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.510 
file on each side so 11 diamonds total
coming<00:02:09.300> across<00:02:09.599> the<00:02:09.869> top<00:02:10.110> and<00:02:10.530> you<00:02:10.830> can<00:02:10.979> see<00:02:11.220> on

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
coming across the top and you can see on

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.670 
coming across the top and you can see on
the<00:02:11.670> side<00:02:12.410> we've<00:02:13.410> got

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
the side we've got

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.160 
the side we've got
this<00:02:13.799> large<00:02:14.609> elongated<00:02:15.180> top<00:02:15.689> string<00:02:15.989> hole

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
this large elongated top string hole

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.990 
this large elongated top string hole
here<00:02:16.469> and<00:02:16.739> then<00:02:17.549> one<00:02:18.090> round<00:02:18.719> hole<00:02:19.019> and<00:02:19.230> this

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
here and then one round hole and this

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.910 
here and then one round hole and this
the<00:02:21.000> second<00:02:21.540> round<00:02:21.569> hole<00:02:21.959> down<00:02:22.230> is<00:02:22.530> the<00:02:22.739> one

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
the second round hole down is the one

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.440 
the second round hole down is the one
that<00:02:23.040> I've<00:02:23.159> used<00:02:23.189> my<00:02:23.640> top<00:02:23.849> string<00:02:24.120> so<00:02:24.239> you<00:02:24.299> can

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
that I've used my top string so you can

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.319 
that I've used my top string so you can
see<00:02:24.659> right<00:02:25.530> there<00:02:25.859> is<00:02:26.129> the<00:02:26.700> start<00:02:26.760> of<00:02:27.030> the<00:02:27.150> top

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:27.329 
see right there is the start of the top

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:30.229 
see right there is the start of the top
string<00:02:27.599> on<00:02:27.840> the<00:02:28.549> second<00:02:29.549> round<00:02:29.760> hole<00:02:30.000> so

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
string on the second round hole so

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:31.099 
string on the second round hole so
there's<00:02:30.450> the<00:02:30.569> first<00:02:30.719> one

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:31.109 
there's the first one

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:33.080 
there's the first one
here's<00:02:31.379> the<00:02:31.530> second<00:02:31.889> I<00:02:31.950> started<00:02:32.280> on<00:02:32.430> there's

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
here's the second I started on there's

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.039 
here's the second I started on there's
all<00:02:33.359> the<00:02:33.450> way<00:02:33.540> around

back through twice so you can see I've
got<00:03:32.430> a<00:03:32.489> tie<00:03:32.849> and<00:03:33.239> a<00:03:34.049> loop<00:03:34.319> on<00:03:34.560> the<00:03:34.669> first<00:03:35.750> 12

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
got a tie and a loop on the first 12

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.199 
got a tie and a loop on the first 12
diamond<00:03:37.079> row<00:03:37.260> right<00:03:38.099> there<00:03:38.159> on<00:03:38.579> the<00:03:38.849> third

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:41.849 
round hole in the side wall and then

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:45.170 
round hole in the side wall and then
just<00:03:42.090> come<00:03:42.299> back<00:03:42.329> up<00:03:42.840> and<00:03:43.290> through<00:03:43.949> the<00:03:44.340> bottom

just come back up and through the bottom
of<00:03:45.569> that<00:03:45.689> diamond<00:03:45.930> mesh<00:03:46.379> again<00:03:47.269> so<00:03:48.269> now<00:03:48.359> we're

00:03:48.499 --> 00:03:48.509 
of that diamond mesh again so now we're

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:50.719 
of that diamond mesh again so now we're
going<00:03:48.599> to<00:03:48.659> si<00:03:49.049> is<00:03:49.379> next<00:03:50.280> I'm<00:03:50.400> going<00:03:50.489> to<00:03:50.579> mesh

00:03:50.719 --> 00:03:50.729 
going to si is next I'm going to mesh

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:54.050 
going to si is next I'm going to mesh
down<00:03:51.509> to<00:03:51.780> this<00:03:52.019> next<00:03:52.259> sidewall<00:03:52.769> hole<00:03:52.979> so<00:03:53.729> come

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
down to this next sidewall hole so come

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.789 
down to this next sidewall hole so come
down<00:03:55.049> through<00:03:55.680> the<00:03:55.829> top<00:03:56.040> of<00:03:56.069> the<00:03:56.250> mesh<00:03:57.049> in<00:03:58.049> to

00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799 
down through the top of the mesh in to

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:00.679 
down through the top of the mesh in to
the<00:03:58.979> outside<00:03:59.400> of<00:03:59.759> the<00:03:59.849> sidewalk<00:04:00.060> hole<00:04:00.419> and

00:04:00.679 --> 00:04:00.689 
the outside of the sidewalk hole and

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:05.330 
the outside of the sidewalk hole and
then<00:04:01.680> just<00:04:02.370> a<00:04:02.459> normal<00:04:02.759> si<00:04:03.439> up<00:04:04.439> through<00:04:04.919> that

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
then just a normal si up through that

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.429 
then just a normal si up through that
loop<00:04:05.639> there<00:04:05.699> that<00:04:06.479> we've<00:04:06.629> created<00:04:06.870> by<00:04:07.169> going

00:04:07.429 --> 00:04:07.439 
loop there that we've created by going

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:09.619 
loop there that we've created by going
down<00:04:07.590> to<00:04:07.769> the<00:04:07.859> top<00:04:08.009> of<00:04:08.129> the<00:04:08.189> mesh<00:04:08.400> and<00:04:08.699> pull

00:04:09.619 --> 00:04:09.629 
down to the top of the mesh and pull

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:11.749 
down to the top of the mesh and pull
that<00:04:09.780> nice<00:04:10.049> and<00:04:10.079> tight<00:04:10.290> and<00:04:10.889> then<00:04:11.549> we're<00:04:11.639> going

00:04:11.749 --> 00:04:11.759 
that nice and tight and then we're going

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:13.939 
that nice and tight and then we're going
to<00:04:11.790> si<00:04:12.120> one<00:04:12.359> more<00:04:12.540> time<00:04:12.750> to<00:04:13.139> get<00:04:13.259> that<00:04:13.439> top<00:04:13.709> nice

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:13.949 
to si one more time to get that top nice

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:16.759 
to si one more time to get that top nice
and<00:04:13.979> tight<00:04:14.280> down<00:04:15.209> through<00:04:15.479> the<00:04:15.569> top<00:04:15.780> of<00:04:15.959> it

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
and tight down through the top of it

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:19.879 
and tight down through the top of it
down<00:04:16.889> to<00:04:17.070> the<00:04:17.159> back<00:04:17.310> of<00:04:17.489> the<00:04:17.549> mesh<00:04:18.019> in<00:04:19.019> through

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:19.889 
down to the back of the mesh in through

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:22.969 
down to the back of the mesh in through
the<00:04:20.130> outside<00:04:20.459> of<00:04:20.519> the<00:04:20.639> sidewall<00:04:21.060> and<00:04:21.979> then

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
the outside of the sidewall and then

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:25.850 
the outside of the sidewall and then
with<00:04:23.760> the<00:04:23.909> sidewall<00:04:24.360> up<00:04:24.630> through<00:04:25.440> that<00:04:25.620> gap

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
with the sidewall up through that gap

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:26.990 
with the sidewall up through that gap
right<00:04:25.919> there

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
right there

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.970 
right there
and<00:04:27.090> then<00:04:27.360> pull<00:04:27.840> that<00:04:27.990> down<00:04:28.230> nice<00:04:28.470> as<00:04:28.680> tight<00:04:28.860> as

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:28.980 
and then pull that down nice as tight as

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.310 
and then pull that down nice as tight as
well<00:04:29.310> and<00:04:29.580> so<00:04:30.030> from<00:04:30.270> here<00:04:30.300> on<00:04:30.540> out<00:04:30.720> we're

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
well and so from here on out we're

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.530 
well and so from here on out we're
really<00:04:31.560> just<00:04:31.650> going<00:04:31.890> to<00:04:31.950> be<00:04:32.070> doing<00:04:32.540> twos

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:33.540 
really just going to be doing twos

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.230 
really just going to be doing twos
that's<00:04:34.110> going<00:04:34.290> to<00:04:34.350> create<00:04:34.520> a<00:04:35.520> nice<00:04:35.880> channel

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
that's going to create a nice channel

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.610 
that's going to create a nice channel
will<00:04:36.420> have<00:04:36.480> making<00:04:36.780> it<00:04:36.900> too<00:04:37.020> abrupt<00:04:37.380> or<00:04:37.500> to

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
will have making it too abrupt or to

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.310 
will have making it too abrupt or to
define<00:04:37.950> you<00:04:38.100> giving<00:04:38.340> it<00:04:38.400> too<00:04:38.460> much<00:04:38.520> whip<00:04:38.850> so<00:04:39.320> up

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
define you giving it too much whip so up

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.230 
define you giving it too much whip so up
and<00:04:40.530> under<00:04:40.740> the<00:04:40.920> next<00:04:41.100> diamond<00:04:41.340> of<00:04:41.670> mesh<00:04:41.910> and

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
and under the next diamond of mesh and

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.140 
and under the next diamond of mesh and
then<00:04:43.050> up<00:04:43.290> and<00:04:43.440> under<00:04:43.790> another<00:04:44.790> diamond<00:04:45.090> to

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
then up and under another diamond to

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.990 
then up and under another diamond to
match<00:04:45.300> to<00:04:45.450> creative<00:04:45.720> -<00:04:45.900> and<00:04:46.490> then<00:04:47.490> down<00:04:47.790> to<00:04:47.820> the

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
match to creative - and then down to the

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.290 
match to creative - and then down to the
next<00:04:48.090> Sabol<00:04:48.900> hole<00:04:49.050> so<00:04:49.650> make<00:04:49.800> sure<00:04:49.830> you're<00:04:50.300> full

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 
next Sabol hole so make sure you're full

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.710 
next Sabol hole so make sure you're full
all<00:04:51.480> this<00:04:51.740> really<00:04:52.740> really<00:04:53.040> tight<00:04:53.220> as<00:04:53.340> you<00:04:53.430> go

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:53.720 
all this really really tight as you go

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:58.460 
all this really really tight as you go
so<00:04:54.720> another<00:04:55.170> two<00:04:55.440> here<00:04:55.800> up<00:04:56.250> and<00:04:56.700> under<00:04:57.000> and<00:04:57.470> up

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
so another two here up and under and up

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.980 
so another two here up and under and up
and<00:04:58.650> under<00:04:58.830> another<00:04:59.330> row<00:05:00.330> or<00:05:00.540> down<00:05:00.780> in<00:05:00.930> the

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
and under another row or down in the

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:04.280 
and under another row or down in the
mesh<00:05:01.200> and<00:05:01.910> in<00:05:02.910> through<00:05:03.570> the<00:05:03.750> side<00:05:03.960> bubble

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:04.290 
mesh and in through the side bubble

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:11.300 
mesh and in through the side bubble
little<00:05:05.010> tight<00:05:05.570> another<00:05:06.570> two<00:05:07.610> up<00:05:08.610> and<00:05:08.790> under<00:05:10.310> up

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310 
little tight another two up and under up

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:17.409 
little tight another two up and under up
and<00:05:11.490> under<00:05:11.730> and<00:05:12.620> in<00:05:13.620> through<00:05:14.370> the<00:05:14.760> outside

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:17.419 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:24.050 

finally<00:05:18.419> another<00:05:19.050> two<00:05:20.180> so<00:05:21.590> open<00:05:22.590> under<00:05:22.770> one<00:05:23.060> up

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 
finally another two so open under one up

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:28.420 
finally another two so open under one up
and<00:05:24.270> on<00:05:24.360> another<00:05:24.680> and<00:05:26.240> into<00:05:27.240> the<00:05:27.510> outside<00:05:27.900> and

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:28.430 
and on another and into the outside and

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:32.120 
and on another and into the outside and
finally<00:05:29.430> one<00:05:29.610> more<00:05:29.640> show<00:05:30.770> down<00:05:31.770> here<00:05:32.010> at<00:05:32.070> the

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:32.130 
finally one more show down here at the

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:36.350 
finally one more show down here at the
bottom<00:05:32.250> up<00:05:32.940> and<00:05:33.120> under<00:05:34.010> another<00:05:35.010> and<00:05:35.490> finish

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360 
bottom up and under another and finish

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.640 
bottom up and under another and finish
off<00:05:36.570> at<00:05:37.530> this<00:05:37.770> last<00:05:39.200> side<00:05:40.200> we'll<00:05:40.380> hold<00:05:40.500> down

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:40.650 
off at this last side we'll hold down

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:41.780 
off at this last side we'll hold down
here<00:05:40.830> and<00:05:40.919> I<00:05:40.979> actually<00:05:41.100> like<00:05:41.340> to<00:05:41.370> take<00:05:41.640> the

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:41.790 
here and I actually like to take the

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:46.100 
here and I actually like to take the
extra<00:05:42.000> string<00:05:42.390> and<00:05:42.720> write<00:05:43.710> it<00:05:43.800> down<00:05:45.020> so<00:05:46.020> I<00:05:46.080> can

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:46.110 
extra string and write it down so I can

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:49.969 
extra string and write it down so I can
do<00:05:46.860> it<00:05:46.979> here<00:05:47.190> but<00:05:48.320> see<00:05:49.320> this<00:05:49.380> is<00:05:49.650> a<00:05:49.680> little

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:49.979 
do it here but see this is a little

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:52.640 
do it here but see this is a little
tricky<00:05:50.310> to<00:05:50.340> get<00:05:50.520> it<00:05:50.640> in<00:05:50.729> there<00:05:51.380> there<00:05:52.380> we<00:05:52.470> go

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:52.650 
tricky to get it in there there we go

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:56.390 
tricky to get it in there there we go
and<00:05:52.890> run<00:05:53.280> it<00:05:53.370> down<00:05:53.960> in<00:05:54.960> through<00:05:55.860> these<00:05:56.070> holes

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:56.400 
and run it down in through these holes

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.850 
and run it down in through these holes
down<00:05:56.700> in<00:05:56.910> the<00:05:57.000> very<00:05:57.240> bottom<00:05:57.390> of<00:05:58.380> the<00:05:58.470> throat

00:05:58.850 --> 00:05:58.860 
down in the very bottom of the throat

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.130 
down in the very bottom of the throat
just<00:05:59.610> just<00:06:00.360> to<00:06:00.479> keep<00:06:00.600> them<00:06:00.750> out<00:06:00.840> of<00:06:00.870> the<00:06:00.990> way

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:01.140 
just just to keep them out of the way

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:03.230 
just just to keep them out of the way
keep<00:06:01.380> it<00:06:01.500> just<00:06:01.590> a<00:06:01.740> little<00:06:01.830> bit<00:06:01.950> tighter<00:06:02.220> and<00:06:02.400> so

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:03.240 
keep it just a little bit tighter and so

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.850 
keep it just a little bit tighter and so
that<00:06:03.450> should<00:06:03.660> give<00:06:03.810> you<00:06:03.930> a<00:06:03.960> really<00:06:04.350> nice<00:06:04.530> mid

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:04.860 
that should give you a really nice mid
