works<00:01:37.049> and<00:01:37.380> then<00:01:37.560> you<00:01:37.680> can<00:01:37.829> physically<00:01:38.250> see

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
works and then you can physically see

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.399 
works and then you can physically see
that<00:01:38.820> it<00:01:38.939> works<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.420> then<00:01:39.479> you<00:01:39.689> nose<00:01:39.900> feels<00:01:40.259> so

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
that it works and then you nose feels so

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.710 
that it works and then you nose feels so
much<00:01:40.530> smoother<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.280> better<00:01:41.400> but<00:01:42.329> maybe<00:01:42.509> that

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
much smoother and better but maybe that

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.359 
much smoother and better but maybe that
might<00:01:42.899> grow<00:01:43.110> some<00:01:43.350> people<00:01:43.619> out<00:01:43.740> so<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.130> only

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
might grow some people out so the only

con<00:01:44.549> about<00:01:44.820> this<00:01:45.000> product<00:01:45.390> is<00:01:45.509> that<00:01:45.570> might

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
con about this product is that might

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.139

perfect kind of neutral palette for
spraying<00:02:07.409> and<00:02:07.590> everyday<00:02:07.860> kind<00:02:08.280> of<00:02:08.429> look<00:02:08.640> and

but<00:02:10.319> they<00:02:10.590> honestly<00:02:11.039> are<00:02:11.430> so<00:02:11.790> not<00:02:12.000> pigmented

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
but they honestly are so not pigmented

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.760 
but they honestly are so not pigmented
it's<00:02:12.940> a<00:02:13.210> little<00:02:13.510> bit<00:02:13.630> ridiculous<00:02:13.870> when<00:02:14.650> you

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
it's a little bit ridiculous when you

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.620 
it's a little bit ridiculous when you
swatch<00:02:15.040> it<00:02:15.220> on<00:02:15.280> your<00:02:15.430> finger<00:02:15.790> it's<00:02:16.000> fine<00:02:16.330> and

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
swatch it on your finger it's fine and

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.740 
swatch it on your finger it's fine and
you<00:02:17.350> can<00:02:17.560> tell<00:02:17.860> that<00:02:17.890> it<00:02:18.520> there's<00:02:18.910> color<00:02:19.300> and

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
you can tell that it there's color and

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.530 
you can tell that it there's color and
it's<00:02:20.530> a<00:02:20.650> little<00:02:20.860> bit<00:02:20.980> chalky<00:02:21.220> as<00:02:21.640> well<00:02:21.940> but

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
it's a little bit chalky as well but

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.750 
it's a little bit chalky as well but
then<00:02:22.690> when<00:02:22.870> you<00:02:22.990> kind<00:02:23.170> of<00:02:23.320> rub<00:02:23.560> it<00:02:23.710> in<00:02:23.890> or<00:02:24.190> try

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
then when you kind of rub it in or try

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.190 
then when you kind of rub it in or try
it<00:02:24.820> on<00:02:24.940> your<00:02:25.090> eyes<00:02:25.210> it<00:02:25.630> literally<00:02:25.930> is<00:02:26.080> like

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
it on your eyes it literally is like

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.500 
it on your eyes it literally is like
you're<00:02:26.530> putting<00:02:26.920> on<00:02:27.010> nothing<00:02:27.490> so<00:02:28.090> I<00:02:28.120> kind<00:02:28.450> of

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
you're putting on nothing so I kind of

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.450 
you're putting on nothing so I kind of
think<00:02:28.660> it's<00:02:28.840> a<00:02:28.930> waste<00:02:29.080> of<00:02:29.320> money<00:02:29.470> the<00:02:30.010> colors

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:30.460 
think it's a waste of money the colors

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:31.980 
think it's a waste of money the colors
are<00:02:30.670> nice<00:02:30.820> they<00:02:31.090> came<00:02:31.270> up<00:02:31.300> with<00:02:31.450> really<00:02:31.750> nice

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
are nice they came up with really nice

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.830 
are nice they came up with really nice
colors<00:02:32.470> but<00:02:33.220> the<00:02:33.430> product<00:02:33.880> just<00:02:34.090> doesn't<00:02:34.570> do

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
colors but the product just doesn't do

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.750 
colors but the product just doesn't do
what<00:02:35.140> it<00:02:35.290> should<00:02:35.560> be<00:02:35.590> doing<00:02:35.740> especially<00:02:36.340> since

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
what it should be doing especially since

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.580 
what it should be doing especially since
it's<00:02:36.880> a<00:02:36.940> colorstay<00:02:37.450> product<00:02:37.870> so<00:02:38.290> basically

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
it's a colorstay product so basically

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:39.840 
it's a colorstay product so basically
it's<00:02:38.800> claiming<00:02:39.190> that<00:02:39.280> it's<00:02:39.430> going<00:02:39.580> to<00:02:39.670> stay<00:02:39.820> on

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
it's claiming that it's going to stay on

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.210 
it's claiming that it's going to stay on
for<00:02:40.209> a<00:02:40.240> long<00:02:40.390> period<00:02:40.600> of<00:02:40.780> time<00:02:40.840> it<00:02:41.410> does<00:02:41.620> not<00:02:41.890> do

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
for a long period of time it does not do

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.370 
for a long period of time it does not do
that<00:02:42.400> I<00:02:42.700> definitely<00:02:43.300> give<00:02:43.690> this<00:02:43.720> product<00:02:44.110> a

smear mark when my I waters with this

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.789 
smear mark when my I waters with this
literally<00:03:34.390> it<00:03:34.660> does<00:03:34.840> not<00:03:35.080> come<00:03:35.320> off<00:03:35.350> it's<00:03:35.709> like

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:35.799 
literally it does not come off it's like

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:37.620 
literally it does not come off it's like
it's<00:03:36.220> like<00:03:36.400> it's<00:03:36.489> kind<00:03:36.910> of<00:03:37.030> waterproof<00:03:37.450> but

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
it's like it's kind of waterproof but

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.190 
it's like it's kind of waterproof but
it's<00:03:37.780> not<00:03:38.019> it's<00:03:38.320> just<00:03:38.860> not<00:03:39.070> very<00:03:39.400> easy<00:03:39.760> to<00:03:40.299> come

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
it's not it's just not very easy to come

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.770 
it's not it's just not very easy to come
off<00:03:41.410> and<00:03:41.709> so<00:03:42.640> it<00:03:42.790> really<00:03:42.820> stays<00:03:43.450> on<00:03:43.630> there

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
off and so it really stays on there

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.020 
off and so it really stays on there
really<00:03:44.110> nice<00:03:44.290> so<00:03:44.680> that'll<00:03:45.130> be<00:03:45.220> better<00:03:45.340> when

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
really nice so that'll be better when

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:47.310 
really nice so that'll be better when
it's<00:03:46.180> hot<00:03:46.390> weather<00:03:46.630> and<00:03:46.780> you<00:03:46.930> don't<00:03:47.110> want<00:03:47.230> your

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.320 
it's hot weather and you don't want your

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:48.930 
it's hot weather and you don't want your
mascara<00:03:47.739> kind<00:03:47.980> of<00:03:48.070> melting<00:03:48.400> down<00:03:48.549> your<00:03:48.760> face

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
mascara kind of melting down your face

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.990 
mascara kind of melting down your face
or<00:03:49.330> flaking<00:03:49.989> off<00:03:50.350> this<00:03:51.010> is<00:03:51.190> really<00:03:51.370> good<00:03:51.670> so

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
or flaking off this is really good so

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.430 
or flaking off this is really good so
this<00:03:52.120> is<00:03:52.239> definitely<00:03:52.450> for<00:03:52.720> somebody<00:03:53.080> who<00:03:53.260> is

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
this is definitely for somebody who is

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.830 
this is definitely for somebody who is
looking<00:03:53.560> for<00:03:53.769> length<00:03:54.340> rather<00:03:55.000> than<00:03:55.299> volume

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
looking for length rather than volume

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.410 
looking for length rather than volume
hate<00:03:56.170> to<00:03:56.290> say<00:03:56.470> that<00:03:56.500> this<00:03:56.860> probably<00:03:57.459> one<00:03:58.390> of
