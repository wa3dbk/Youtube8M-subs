showing something that a lot of you may
not<00:00:13.889> know<00:00:14.160> about<00:00:14.670> Minecraft<00:00:15.299> in<00:00:15.450> general<00:00:15.870> and

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
not know about Minecraft in general and

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.140 
not know about Minecraft in general and
I'm<00:00:17.039> gonna<00:00:17.160> be<00:00:17.310> showing<00:00:17.340> off<00:00:17.699> a<00:00:17.730> little<00:00:17.970> bit<00:00:18.060> of

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
I'm gonna be showing off a little bit of

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.970 
I'm gonna be showing off a little bit of
sand<00:00:18.510> physics<00:00:19.050> today<00:00:19.230> with<00:00:19.500> this<00:00:19.619> contraption

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
sand physics today with this contraption

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.880 
sand physics today with this contraption
that<00:00:20.189> I<00:00:20.310> built<00:00:20.520> um<00:00:20.820> I've<00:00:21.750> known<00:00:22.140> for<00:00:22.590> a<00:00:22.619> while

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
that I built um I've known for a while

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.099 
that I built um I've known for a while
now<00:00:22.949> but<00:00:23.699> I<00:00:23.760> haven't<00:00:24.060> really<00:00:24.330> been<00:00:24.689> able<00:00:24.930> to

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
now but I haven't really been able to

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.009 
now but I haven't really been able to
like<00:00:25.820> just<00:00:26.820> build<00:00:27.210> something<00:00:27.750> to<00:00:27.869> take

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
like just build something to take

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.140 
like just build something to take
advantage<00:00:28.380> of<00:00:28.500> it<00:00:28.590> that<00:00:29.189> you<00:00:29.609> can<00:00:29.640> actually

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
advantage of it that you can actually

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.089 
advantage of it that you can actually
launch<00:00:30.420> sand<00:00:30.900> blocks<00:00:31.230> as<00:00:31.500> they're<00:00:31.830> falling

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
launch sand blocks as they're falling

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.979 
launch sand blocks as they're falling
and<00:00:32.399> they<00:00:32.460> go<00:00:32.579> flying<00:00:32.880> it's<00:00:33.180> actually<00:00:33.480> really

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
and they go flying it's actually really

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.360 
and they go flying it's actually really
cool<00:00:34.200> and<00:00:35.149> it's<00:00:36.149> it's<00:00:36.750> really<00:00:37.739> hard<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.100> time

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
cool and it's it's really hard to time

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.950 
cool and it's it's really hard to time
actually<00:00:38.969> I<00:00:39.000> think<00:00:39.180> I've<00:00:39.420> got<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.660> timing

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
actually I think I've got the timing

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.840 
actually I think I've got the timing
down<00:00:40.050> decently<00:00:40.590> I<00:00:40.680> mean<00:00:41.010> I<00:00:41.129> have<00:00:41.309> to<00:00:41.430> manually

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
down decently I mean I have to manually

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.299 
down decently I mean I have to manually
press<00:00:42.180> these<00:00:42.329> buttons<00:00:42.390> for<00:00:42.930> it<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.140> work<00:00:43.309> but

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
press these buttons for it to work but

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.279 
press these buttons for it to work but
you<00:00:44.640> guys<00:00:44.760> will<00:00:44.969> see<00:00:45.149> what<00:00:45.270> I<00:00:45.300> mean<00:00:45.329> what<00:00:45.840> what

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
you guys will see what I mean what what

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.490 
you guys will see what I mean what what
what<00:00:46.590> I<00:00:46.620> do<00:00:46.710> is<00:00:47.010> I<00:00:47.100> use<00:00:47.730> this<00:00:48.210> dispenser<00:00:48.629> pop

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
what I do is I use this dispenser pop

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.650 
what I do is I use this dispenser pop
down<00:00:49.739> a<00:00:49.770> piece<00:00:50.340> of<00:00:50.399> TNT<00:00:50.910> goes<00:00:51.180> down<00:00:51.390> here

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
down a piece of TNT goes down here

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.049 
down a piece of TNT goes down here
breaks<00:00:52.050> all<00:00:52.410> of<00:00:52.770> these<00:00:52.949> pieces<00:00:53.430> of<00:00:53.640> sand<00:00:53.879> down

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
breaks all of these pieces of sand down

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.959 
breaks all of these pieces of sand down
here<00:00:54.350> sand<00:00:55.350> blocks<00:00:55.590> start<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:55.980> fall<00:00:56.219> but

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
here sand blocks start to fall but

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.090 
here sand blocks start to fall but
meanwhile<00:00:57.750> I<00:00:57.989> pressed<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:58.469> button<00:00:58.500> up<00:00:58.859> here

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
meanwhile I pressed a button up here

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.540 
meanwhile I pressed a button up here
allowed<00:00:59.579> all<00:00:59.879> these<00:01:00.239> dispensers<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.550> drop

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
allowed all these dispensers to drop

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.509 
allowed all these dispensers to drop
down<00:01:02.760> piece<00:01:03.090> of<00:01:03.270> TNT<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:03.840> then<00:01:04.619> I<00:01:04.920> wait<00:01:05.220> until

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
down piece of TNT and then I wait until

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.850 
down piece of TNT and then I wait until
they<00:01:05.700> I<00:01:06.090> wait<00:01:06.390> about<00:01:06.630> four<00:01:06.990> seconds<00:01:07.409> or<00:01:07.500> so<00:01:07.650> and

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
they I wait about four seconds or so and

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.730 
they I wait about four seconds or so and
then<00:01:07.950> I<00:01:08.610> open<00:01:09.060> up<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.750> TNT<00:01:10.200> let<00:01:10.409> them<00:01:10.530> fall

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
then I open up the TNT let them fall

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.190 
then I open up the TNT let them fall
through<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.189> hopefully<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.240> TNT<00:01:12.720> explodes

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
through and hopefully the TNT explodes

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.140 
through and hopefully the TNT explodes
on<00:01:13.470> this<00:01:13.619> on<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.100> falling<00:01:14.460> sand<00:01:14.700> so<00:01:14.939> I<00:01:14.970> can

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
on this on the falling sand so I can

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.350 
on this on the falling sand so I can
demonstrate<00:01:15.270> this<00:01:15.750> correctly<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:17.000> yeah<00:01:18.030> so

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
demonstrate this correctly and yeah so

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.730 
demonstrate this correctly and yeah so
let's<00:01:18.570> actually<00:01:18.900> give<00:01:19.049> this<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.259> whirl<00:01:19.290> see<00:01:19.680> if

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
let's actually give this a whirl see if

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:29.929 
let's actually give this a whirl see if
we<00:01:19.799> can<00:01:19.920> do<00:01:19.979> this<00:01:21.530> okay<00:01:22.530> -<00:01:23.390> ah<00:01:26.479> ah<00:01:28.700> guys<00:01:29.700> like

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
we can do this okay - ah ah guys like

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.510 
we can do this okay - ah ah guys like
that<00:01:30.150> you<00:01:31.049> guys<00:01:31.200> like<00:01:31.439> that<00:01:31.619> that<00:01:31.860> was<00:01:32.100> cool

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
that you guys like that that was cool

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.120 
that you guys like that that was cool
man<00:01:32.939> and<00:01:33.930> it's<00:01:34.110> like<00:01:34.200> they<00:01:34.470> actually<00:01:34.619> get

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
man and it's like they actually get

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.910 
man and it's like they actually get
placed<00:01:35.670> they're<00:01:36.210> not<00:01:36.390> just<00:01:36.630> like<00:01:36.920> they're

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
placed they're not just like they're

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.380 
placed they're not just like they're
they<00:01:38.159> don't<00:01:38.189> just<00:01:38.490> like<00:01:38.610> fly<00:01:38.909> as<00:01:39.180> like<00:01:39.360> a

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
they don't just like fly as like a

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.179 
they don't just like fly as like a
little<00:01:39.600> random<00:01:40.020> icons<00:01:40.409> or<00:01:40.619> something<00:01:41.040> they

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
little random icons or something they

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.340 
little random icons or something they
legitimately<00:01:41.820> just<00:01:41.939> land<00:01:42.390> here<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:42.990> I<00:01:43.290> think

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
legitimately just land here and I think

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.090 
legitimately just land here and I think
that's<00:01:43.829> super<00:01:44.729> cool<00:01:45.030> and<00:01:45.420> a<00:01:45.770> lot<00:01:46.770> of<00:01:46.890> people

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
that's super cool and a lot of people

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.700 
that's super cool and a lot of people
don't<00:01:47.310> know<00:01:47.520> about<00:01:47.700> this<00:01:48.000> which<00:01:48.299> is<00:01:48.710> not

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
don't know about this which is not

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.499 
don't know about this which is not
surprising<00:01:50.189> because<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.640> conditions<00:01:51.210> for<00:01:51.420> it

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
surprising because the conditions for it

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.499 
surprising because the conditions for it
to<00:01:51.659> work<00:01:51.840> are<00:01:52.049> actually<00:01:52.409> ridiculous<00:01:53.399> as<00:01:53.820> you

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
to work are actually ridiculous as you

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.690 
to work are actually ridiculous as you
can<00:01:54.659> see<00:01:54.810> I<00:01:54.840> actually<00:01:55.110> had<00:01:56.040> to<00:01:56.219> line<00:01:56.460> that<00:01:56.670> up

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
can see I actually had to line that up

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.700 
can see I actually had to line that up
perfectly<00:01:57.240> I<00:01:57.329> used<00:01:57.570> a<00:01:57.689> ton<00:01:57.930> of<00:01:57.960> sand<00:01:58.350> so<00:01:58.530> that<00:01:58.649> I

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
perfectly I used a ton of sand so that I

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.090 
perfectly I used a ton of sand so that I

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
hard I just didn't feel like setting up

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:10.639 
hard I just didn't feel like setting up
the

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
the

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.100 
the
all<00:02:10.739> the<00:02:10.950> timings<00:02:11.340> and<00:02:11.459> stuff<00:02:11.730> but<00:02:12.510> if<00:02:12.989> you

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
all the timings and stuff but if you

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.270 
all the timings and stuff but if you
guys<00:02:13.230> can<00:02:13.409> make<00:02:13.470> something<00:02:13.769> like<00:02:13.890> that<00:02:14.040> and

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
guys can make something like that and

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.280 
guys can make something like that and

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
then just get an easy way to set up the

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.780 
then just get an easy way to set up the
sand<00:02:16.500> instead<00:02:17.069> of<00:02:17.159> just<00:02:17.280> placing<00:02:17.430> them<00:02:17.670> each

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
sand instead of just placing them each

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.839 
sand instead of just placing them each
individually<00:02:17.970> oh<00:02:18.540> that<00:02:19.500> is<00:02:19.680> sick<00:02:20.129> I<00:02:20.400> know<00:02:20.549> and

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
is why it's fun with TNT s because I can

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.610 
is why it's fun with TNT s because I can
just<00:02:29.549> like<00:02:29.760> pee<00:02:30.329> pre<00:02:30.599> stacking<00:02:31.140> this<00:02:31.290> and

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
just like pee pre stacking this and

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.589 
just like pee pre stacking this and
launching<00:02:32.519> them<00:02:32.640> over<00:02:32.879> and<00:02:33.000> over<00:02:33.060> again<00:02:33.299> just

launching them over and over again just
see<00:02:34.049> the<00:02:34.260> sand<00:02:34.769> go<00:02:34.950> flying<00:02:35.250> just<00:02:35.519> because

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
see the sand go flying just because

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.339 
see the sand go flying just because
something<00:02:36.299> you<00:02:36.329> don't<00:02:36.659> see<00:02:36.930> every<00:02:37.200> day<00:02:37.230> I

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349 
something you don't see every day I

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:40.339 
something you don't see every day I
don't<00:02:37.620> know<00:02:37.819> so<00:02:38.819> uh<00:02:38.849> if<00:02:39.540> you<00:02:39.720> guys<00:02:39.840> want<00:02:40.170> to<00:02:40.260> get

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
don't know so uh if you guys want to get

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.080 
don't know so uh if you guys want to get
something<00:02:40.590> like<00:02:40.799> this<00:02:40.920> set<00:02:41.189> up<00:02:41.340> um<00:02:41.819> it's

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
something like this set up um it's

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.879 
something like this set up um it's
pretty<00:02:42.480> it's<00:02:42.840> pretty<00:02:42.900> simple<00:02:43.440> to<00:02:43.560> do<00:02:43.709> the

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:43.889 
pretty it's pretty simple to do the

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:45.110 
pretty it's pretty simple to do the
reason<00:02:44.040> why<00:02:44.190> I<00:02:44.250> didn't<00:02:44.459> build<00:02:44.639> is<00:02:44.819> just

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
reason why I didn't build is just

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.839 
reason why I didn't build is just
because<00:02:45.359> it's<00:02:45.599> a<00:02:45.720> little<00:02:46.079> bit<00:02:46.470> long<00:02:46.739> but<00:02:47.670> it's

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 
because it's a little bit long but it's

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:49.849 
because it's a little bit long but it's
really<00:02:48.090> it's<00:02:48.359> a<00:02:48.480> really<00:02:48.599> simple<00:02:49.139> concept<00:02:49.349> all

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:49.859 
really it's a really simple concept all

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:52.220 
really it's a really simple concept all
you<00:02:50.010> do<00:02:50.159> is<00:02:50.280> just<00:02:50.569> I<00:02:51.569> think<00:02:51.659> you<00:02:51.959> can<00:02:52.079> pretty

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
you do is just I think you can pretty

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.149 
you do is just I think you can pretty
much<00:02:52.319> figure<00:02:52.590> it<00:02:52.799> out

00:02:53.149 --> 00:02:53.159 
much figure it out

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:55.160 
much figure it out
from<00:02:53.819> everything<00:02:54.450> that<00:02:54.599> I'm<00:02:54.750> just<00:02:54.930> showing

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
from everything that I'm just showing

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.330 
from everything that I'm just showing
you<00:02:55.260> guys<00:02:55.379> I<00:02:55.439> don't<00:02:55.590> think<00:02:55.709> I<00:02:55.829> need<00:02:55.920> to<00:02:56.069> explain

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
you guys I don't think I need to explain

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.550 
you guys I don't think I need to explain
anything<00:02:56.639> like<00:02:57.480> this<00:02:57.659> switch<00:02:57.900> just<00:02:58.170> makes<00:02:58.379> the

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
anything like this switch just makes the

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.229 
anything like this switch just makes the
like<00:02:58.950> this<00:02:59.099> doesn't<00:02:59.400> this<00:02:59.430> doesn't<00:03:00.000> even<00:03:00.030> need

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
like this doesn't this doesn't even need

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.420 
like this doesn't this doesn't even need
to<00:03:00.299> be<00:03:00.389> here<00:03:00.840> like<00:03:01.170> you<00:03:01.620> want<00:03:01.769> me<00:03:01.859> to<00:03:01.920> simplify

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
to be here like you want me to simplify

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.690 
to be here like you want me to simplify
it<00:03:02.489> even<00:03:02.639> more<00:03:02.939> just<00:03:03.810> do<00:03:03.900> that<00:03:04.109> you<00:03:04.409> know<00:03:04.530> I<00:03:04.769> was

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
it even more just do that you know I was

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.220 
it even more just do that you know I was
over<00:03:05.879> complicating<00:03:06.510> it<00:03:06.599> but<00:03:06.780> this<00:03:07.019> is<00:03:07.200> a

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
over complicating it but this is a

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.690 
over complicating it but this is a
really<00:03:07.650> simple<00:03:07.859> contraption<00:03:08.459> that<00:03:08.489> you<00:03:08.609> guys

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
really simple contraption that you guys

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:09.830 
really simple contraption that you guys
can<00:03:08.849> make<00:03:08.970> and<00:03:09.120> it's<00:03:09.209> all<00:03:09.299> about<00:03:09.420> the<00:03:09.569> timing

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
can make and it's all about the timing

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.800 
can make and it's all about the timing
that<00:03:10.079> you<00:03:10.109> get<00:03:10.319> it<00:03:10.439> and<00:03:11.239> also<00:03:12.239> how<00:03:12.450> long<00:03:12.480> it

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
that you get it and also how long it

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.289 
that you get it and also how long it
takes<00:03:12.959> for<00:03:13.079> you<00:03:13.139> to<00:03:13.260> set<00:03:13.439> up<00:03:13.470> the<00:03:14.000> the<00:03:15.000> sand

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
takes for you to set up the the sand

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:17.240 
takes for you to set up the the sand
hopefully<00:03:16.109> you<00:03:16.199> guys<00:03:16.290> enjoyed<00:03:16.650> this<00:03:16.859> though<00:03:17.069> I

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
hopefully you guys enjoyed this though I

hopefully you guys enjoyed this though I
think<00:03:17.430> this<00:03:17.760> was<00:03:17.879> one<00:03:17.910> of<00:03:18.150> the<00:03:18.209> more

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:18.599 
think this was one of the more

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:20.599 
think this was one of the more
informative<00:03:19.410> episodes<00:03:20.010> more<00:03:20.220> like<00:03:20.430> wow<00:03:20.579> I

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:20.609 
informative episodes more like wow I

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:22.129 
informative episodes more like wow I
didn't<00:03:21.150> even<00:03:21.299> know<00:03:21.480> that<00:03:21.510> existed<00:03:21.690> in

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:22.139 
didn't even know that existed in

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:22.670 
didn't even know that existed in

personally<00:03:23.430> I<00:03:23.489> don't<00:03:23.669> even<00:03:23.730> know<00:03:23.910> how<00:03:24.030> long

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
personally I don't even know how long
