00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:09.960
 good afternoon with you natalya popova and 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.840
 online biologists project today we are with you 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.910
 proceed to consider the type of chord 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.109
 of animals 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:19.410
 characteristic feature of chord 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.400
 animals is what they have 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.830
 chord 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.890
 or the spine as an axial 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:30.240
 skeletal nervous system tubular shape 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:32.070
 and there is the gill slits of the cord or how them 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.829
 also called the dorsal string 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.489
 this is the internal axial skeleton of chordates 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.250
 of animals 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.700
 chord consists of a strong kuzi rowan them 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.690
 cells that allow the chord to be 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.110
 at the same time 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.760
 elasticity durable and elastic in 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.510
 as an axial skeleton chord 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:55.500
 only saved without skull and 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.859
 of some shells of a main body 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.829
 chordates of vertebrate animals 

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:03.960
 chord is replaced by cartilage or bone 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.990
 spine central department none 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.180
 the system is represented by a tube which 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.299
 chordate animals located above 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:15.110
 chord or above the spine and 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.729
 at the front end this tube 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.720
 transformed into a brain composed 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.210
 from 5 departments 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.340
 this is the forebrain midbrain 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.100
 midbrain cerebellum and 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.259
 medulla 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.189
 further behind the medulla is followed 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.530
 spinal cord 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:34.049
 gill slits this hole which 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.810
 connect the front of the digestive 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:40.259
 tube that is sip with the external environment 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.810
 in cyclostomes and amphibian larvae 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.149
 gills develop on the gill crevices 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.210
 special respiratory organs at ground 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:51.119
 vertebral gills mind kiss but they 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.860
 are present in embryonic development to 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.399
 chord type refers 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:59.820
 trip type is a subtype tunic 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:03.659
 by type without cranial and subtype cranial 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:06.180
 or vertebrates to a type without cranial 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.729
 include class lancelet of or head 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.009
 chordates to the type of cranial or 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.410
 vertebrates include the following classes 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:16.290
 this is the cyclos class 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:19.110
 then superclass which the fish 2 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:22.500
 class is cartilaginous and bony fish 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:26.070
 class amphibians class reptiles 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.450
 bird class and mammal class so 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.540
 today we reviewed the general 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:33.390
 classification and the type of response 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:36.510
 chordates next time we get down to 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:39.270
 examining a type without a cranial on 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:43.220
 example lancelet with you was Natalia 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.220
