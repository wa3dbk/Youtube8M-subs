00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 hello to all guys and welcome to 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:07.379
 this new spot light where we will talk 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:10.320
 of mod deathsmiles then as you can 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.540
 see here the front furnaces with gods 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.960
 numbers above the numbers indicate 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.760
 the cooking speed that is practically 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:22.710
 this furnace and cook minerals 25 times 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:24.600
 a normal furnace then as you can 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.310
 see before you even voice iron 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.980
 the golden one with the diamond then 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.120
 we have a reform that would be this and 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.670
 yes kraft has it this way 

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:38.410
 diamond blocks not even a cream tnt meter 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:40.570
 Bric and then we lai screen that Formez 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.980
 it is obviously throat el and more 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.750
 you have to add under stand her 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.760
 offender and this is very complicated but 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:50.110
 I think it's worth it to cook i 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:51.850
 mining 50 times faster and then 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.530
 in addition to these furnaces we also have 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.080
 of upgrades and that you can see here 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.550
 in my main bar then 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.620
 let's start with the first one 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.970
 the first is called fuel efficiency not 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.519
 does nothing more than double 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.140
 the energy that was elena from anybody 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:07.450
 to put in the furnace to cook 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.040
 for example if we take a piece of 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:13.230
 coal 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.230
 all 2 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.320
 of the iron hours 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.080
 if we cook we can see that 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.930
 cooks up 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:27.390
 eight blocks in the moment in which 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.390
 we're going to put wolf grade and cook 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:35.630
 we will cook 16 blocks 16 ingots with a 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:40.850
 only piece of coal this is consumed 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:43.790
 yes consumption is hard for 128 firings then 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:47.030
 we have now and processes that upgrade is not 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:49.040
 other than an upgrade and that doubles the 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.840
 mineral coming out like a paul verizon 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:54.070
 the same effect as the powder heiser 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.070
 the thief came to take 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:02.780
 and from 16 iron hours I will go to cook 32 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.790
 ingots with a single block of coal 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.900
 obviously they can be accumulated in 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:10.520
 could the particular thing about these 

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:13.820
 you can see that there is a second version 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:17.020
 which is nothing but the advance and what not 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.020
 has usage limitations 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.900
 here is the world 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:24.940
 advanced and advanced processes now with 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.850
 these two could you unlimited 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:31.480
 Cook the mineral twice by half 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:33.250
 of the fuel price then we have a 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.330
 another very nice godfather who liquidated 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.770
 fuel of trade 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.140
 does nothing but add a little 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.730
 thank you to the furnace and you can 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.250
 quietly connect a tube the 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.810
 fine form we see here we have the 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.550
 thermal expansys we should have gods 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.000
 liquids 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.000
 here they are 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.569
 we get a little beyond 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.129
 here it is 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.980
 ours will go inside and we can use it 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:12.180
 to cook our minerals in place 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.040
 of coal 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.950
 obviously these also come into effect 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.140
 two could then have another father 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.549
 which is called storage upgrade a 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.549
 unlike the other upgrades and it doesn't go 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:26.359
 inside but it must be set by clicking shift 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:26.359
 and with the right 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:32.010
 and now you will see that the space at the 

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:34.599
 form c is doubled compared to before 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:37.000
 then we have these others or you can do that 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:40.390
 are optional and decorative we have 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.680
 reduced the color of green we can give 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:45.180
 color we want training 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.180
 look at the example we click 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.510
 and it was I go 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.510
 and here it is 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.430
 wonderful 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.870
 the difference is not that much has been seen 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.159
 because the color is very similar but a 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.849
 other color 

00:03:57.159 --> 00:03:59.849
 let's make a nice yellow 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.670
 here it is 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:07.909
 then we have these three upgrades that are 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:09.170
 for advanced industries that are 

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:10.400
 obviously optional as usual 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:12.980
 because obviously to pull out 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.560
 minerals and just give it a boost 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:17.320
 already in any kind of borderline tour 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:20.799
 warcraft 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:24.380
 these are practically the self output 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:25.759
 and auto output and input and this one 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.349
 instead, both together 

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:31.360
 practically if I put a self input 

00:04:27.349 --> 00:04:34.090
 I can choose for example fi of the art 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:37.250
 the moment I go to put 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:39.229
 this upgrade I will be able to put input from 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:41.030
 left instead of the other because 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:42.440
 every furnace to input always from the top 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:45.169
 in the moment here I go to put this 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:47.810
 I can change it and put it to the left is 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:51.440
 same with this this is an output 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:53.260
 practically I choose right write 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:57.510
 I put 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.510
 I take a very simple chest 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:05.400
 almost my iron and goes directly 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:08.169
 in the basket with output all right right 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:11.800
 and then of course we have the cry in 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:13.990
 final which is a summary all has 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:16.830
 powers we have its first was l 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.830
 input output 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:21.330
 obviously you can see the craft 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.919
 all in the mail 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.470
 here is this tabby with the others 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:28.710
 two obviously because it is a summary 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:32.099
 this in gold this in iron that is 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:33.659
 very simple and this color a little 

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:35.930
 a mixture of all existing colors 

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:35.930
 in the game 

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:41.349
 okay this is all i said this 

00:05:39.219 --> 00:05:43.389
 I greet you I hope the way you like it 

00:05:41.349 --> 00:05:44.889
 you will also find in my package is 

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:46.539
 really a very interesting way 

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:48.069
 especially to make industry high 

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:49.659
 level especially with this is the 

00:05:48.069 --> 00:05:52.960
 formez which is really really very much 

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:53.560
 useful a greeting to all the kids at 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:57.900
 next 

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:57.900
 I recommend like polito ciao a tutti
