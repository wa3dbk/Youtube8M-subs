00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
play on or even the games that we play I

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.510 
play on or even the games that we play I
know<00:02:10.020> I<00:02:10.200> have<00:02:10.590> to<00:02:10.619> be<00:02:10.860> a<00:02:10.890> little<00:02:11.130> bit<00:02:11.340> more

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
know I have to be a little bit more

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.310 
know I have to be a little bit more
tolerant<00:02:12.150> guys<00:02:12.300> because<00:02:12.570> I'm<00:02:12.660> a<00:02:12.690> bit<00:02:12.959> older

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:13.320 
tolerant guys because I'm a bit older

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.900 
tolerant guys because I'm a bit older
than<00:02:13.350> most<00:02:13.650> of<00:02:13.830> the<00:02:13.890> gamers<00:02:14.280> out<00:02:14.430> there<00:02:14.490> so

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
than most of the gamers out there so

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.610 
than most of the gamers out there so
yeah<00:02:15.120> there's<00:02:15.360> a<00:02:15.420> bit<00:02:15.630> of<00:02:15.780> you<00:02:16.230> know<00:02:16.260> in

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
yeah there's a bit of you know in

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.130 
yeah there's a bit of you know in
maturity<00:02:17.340> out<00:02:17.520> there<00:02:17.850> and<00:02:18.000> I<00:02:18.030> suppose<00:02:18.450> it's<00:02:18.780> to

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
maturity out there and I suppose it's to

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.110 
maturity out there and I suppose it's to
be<00:02:19.260> expected<00:02:19.290> but<00:02:20.220> the<00:02:20.340> name-calling<00:02:20.580> and

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
be expected but the name-calling and

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.060 
be expected but the name-calling and
blatant<00:02:21.480> disrespect<00:02:22.110> to<00:02:22.230> other<00:02:22.410> gamers<00:02:22.770> is

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
blatant disrespect to other gamers is

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.640 
blatant disrespect to other gamers is
getting<00:02:23.400> old<00:02:23.610> fast<00:02:23.760> not<00:02:24.330> about<00:02:24.630> you<00:02:24.840> guys<00:02:25.110> but

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
getting old fast not about you guys but

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.620 
getting old fast not about you guys but
I<00:02:25.739> think<00:02:25.980> if<00:02:26.130> everybody<00:02:26.790> would<00:02:27.180> simply<00:02:27.600> take

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
I think if everybody would simply take

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.390 
I think if everybody would simply take
the<00:02:27.840> time<00:02:28.230> to<00:02:28.470> watch<00:02:28.620> all<00:02:28.890> of<00:02:28.950> the

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
the time to watch all of the

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.490 
the time to watch all of the
presentations<00:02:30.180> at<00:02:30.300> e3<00:02:30.450> maybe<00:02:30.959> we<00:02:31.170> can<00:02:31.320> learn

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
presentations at e3 maybe we can learn

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.620 
presentations at e3 maybe we can learn
something<00:02:31.560> from<00:02:32.130> all<00:02:32.910> the<00:02:33.269> different
