00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.890

 Professionals in this matter calmly 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:11.220
 all done today for the whole day with 

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:13.680

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.399

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:49.039
 the former well that's the way he 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.899
 It was made the way or just a brick 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:54.830
 ordinary mortar is not even concrete on 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:57.390
 something in between the concrete solution 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:02:04.200
 Naturally this wall this angle is quite 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:08.220
 break down here goes 2 old military

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:20.910
 plastic pipe this sleeve of my pipe 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:25.260
 every pipe is smaller and smaller have 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:26.970
 fit better then did the old 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.830

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:40.650
 80 well meter not 80 meter seventy is 65 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.650

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:47.739
 that closed them off because they 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.590
