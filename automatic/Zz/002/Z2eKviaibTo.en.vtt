00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.590 
word that was written by the Spirit it's
like<00:00:22.920> we<00:00:23.070> avoid<00:00:23.490> studying<00:00:24.240> God's<00:00:24.420> Word

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600

don't really want to do that so we'll

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.500 
don't really want to do that so we'll
just<00:00:28.439> rather<00:00:28.619> be<00:00:28.800> spirit<00:00:29.670> led<00:00:29.880> but<00:00:30.240> do<00:00:30.390> we

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
just rather be spirit led but do we

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.540 
just rather be spirit led but do we
really<00:00:30.660> have<00:00:30.810> a<00:00:30.869> biblical<00:00:31.289> definition<00:00:31.769> for
