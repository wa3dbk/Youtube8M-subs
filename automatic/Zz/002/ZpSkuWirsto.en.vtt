 Hello everyone and welcome to the first one 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.100
 makeup attack episode 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.800
 in practice I will show you how I realize 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:17.760
 characters maybe taken from illustrations 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:19.770
 and designs in a simple way with materials 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.580
 products that I find in my laboratory or 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.160
 at my home 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.760
 in this way they try to create make-up 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.710
 creative and artistic in no time 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:31.650
 for this first episode chosen batman 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.019
 beyond I remember that ivan had found a 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.079
 very cool illustration and we have 

00:00:34.019 --> 00:00:39.210
 immediately decided to make it then 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.100
 we created a latex carrot 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.770
 horns obviously improvised with 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.230
 latex and polystyrene within 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.000
 an hour we were ready to leave with 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.950
 trick since i'm little i always have 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.739
 followed the series with great interest 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.289
 batman animate or adored but of what 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.440
 this batman beyond speaks very few 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:01.469
 batman words of the future created by 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.500
 pollens and whips and our rider 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:07.150
 dark is not what we all know 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.580
 Russian n but a kid 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.110
 a rebel student called the 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.210
 remaking iss 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.250
 returning to our make up as always 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.130
 ivan proved to be my guinea pig 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.140
 preferred versatile and capable of 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.570
 interpret all the characters that 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.270
 together they eventually create this trick 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:28.000
 it was simple but impressive 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.400
 I want to know from you what you think 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.900

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.020
 characters 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.010
