00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.790 
plan your food so those coming look from
sources<00:02:18.040> locally<00:02:18.610> produced<00:02:18.819> for<00:02:19.450> you<00:02:19.630> so<00:02:20.620> that

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
sources locally produced for you so that

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.760 
sources locally produced for you so that
that<00:02:20.920> reduces<00:02:21.640> the<00:02:21.819> food<00:02:22.450> miles<00:02:22.780> associated

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
that reduces the food miles associated

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.010 
that reduces the food miles associated
with<00:02:23.920> the<00:02:24.010> transport<00:02:24.670> something<00:02:25.570> like<00:02:25.840> that

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
with the transport something like that

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.110 
with the transport something like that
be<00:02:26.230> aware<00:02:26.560> of<00:02:26.620> the<00:02:26.980> environment<00:02:27.070> around<00:02:27.730> you

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
be aware of the environment around you

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.780 
be aware of the environment around you
it's<00:02:28.270> a<00:02:28.390> year<00:02:28.690> for<00:02:29.620> you<00:02:29.740> for<00:02:30.070> being<00:02:30.310> aware<00:02:30.730> of

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
it's a year for you for being aware of

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.420 
it's a year for you for being aware of
the<00:02:31.090> environment<00:02:31.209> and<00:02:32.080> making<00:02:32.950> some<00:02:33.160> progress

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
the environment and making some progress

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.350 
the environment and making some progress
in<00:02:33.700> in<00:02:34.209> putting<00:02:34.720> things<00:02:35.430> in<00:02:36.430> place<00:02:36.760> that<00:02:37.330> will

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
in in putting things in place that will

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.850 
in in putting things in place that will
reduce<00:02:37.720> your<00:02:38.260> carbon<00:02:38.770> footprint<00:02:40.590> maybe<00:02:41.590> take

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
reduce your carbon footprint maybe take

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.979 
reduce your carbon footprint maybe take
a<00:02:41.920> look<00:02:42.160> at<00:02:42.340> things<00:02:43.209> like<00:02:43.330> to<00:02:43.660> have

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
a look at things like to have

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:47.520 
a look at things like to have
photovoltaic<00:02:44.830> cells<00:02:45.310> at<00:02:45.610> solar<00:02:45.910> panels<00:02:46.530> or

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
photovoltaic cells at solar panels or

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.130 
photovoltaic cells at solar panels or
maybe<00:02:48.280> wind<00:02:48.640> power<00:02:48.940> something<00:02:49.360> like<00:02:49.690> that<00:02:49.930> if

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
maybe wind power something like that if

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.630 
maybe wind power something like that if
you've<00:02:50.320> got<00:02:50.560> the<00:02:50.680> opportunity<00:02:50.920> to<00:02:51.459> do

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
you've got the opportunity to do

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.240 
you've got the opportunity to do
something<00:02:51.970> like<00:02:52.239> that<00:02:52.650> if<00:02:53.650> you<00:02:53.800> have<00:02:53.890> to<00:02:54.070> learn

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
something like that if you have to learn

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.100 
something like that if you have to learn
it<00:02:54.400> available<00:02:54.730> and<00:02:55.209> you<00:02:55.300> can<00:02:55.330> produce<00:02:55.720> your

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
it available and you can produce your

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.940 
it available and you can produce your
own<00:02:56.140> power<00:02:56.620> it<00:02:57.489> will<00:02:57.640> reduce<00:02:57.850> your<00:02:58.950> your

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
own power it will reduce your your

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.250 
own power it will reduce your your
carbon<00:03:00.430> footprint<00:03:01.420> it'll<00:03:01.780> reduce<00:03:01.900> your

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
carbon footprint it'll reduce your

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.830 
carbon footprint it'll reduce your
impact<00:03:02.380> on<00:03:02.890> the<00:03:03.040> earth<00:03:03.070> a<00:03:03.430> little<00:03:03.519> bit<00:03:03.880> it

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
impact on the earth a little bit it

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.130 
impact on the earth a little bit it
might<00:03:05.080> also<00:03:05.320> get<00:03:05.650> you<00:03:05.800> some<00:03:06.180> some<00:03:07.180> finance<00:03:07.750> and

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
might also get you some some finance and

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.740 
might also get you some some finance and
money<00:03:08.290> flowing<00:03:08.920> if<00:03:09.130> you<00:03:09.370> can<00:03:09.550> contribute<00:03:10.300> to

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
money flowing if you can contribute to

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.620 
money flowing if you can contribute to
the<00:03:10.900> national<00:03:11.799> power<00:03:12.070> grid<00:03:12.190> of<00:03:12.940> something

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
the national power grid of something

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.780 
the national power grid of something
like<00:03:13.780> that<00:03:13.989> they're<00:03:14.200> always<00:03:14.380> coming<00:03:15.190> up<00:03:15.430> for

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
like that they're always coming up for

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.759 
like that they're always coming up for
you<00:03:15.820> that<00:03:16.150> you<00:03:16.269> might<00:03:16.540> take<00:03:17.140> want<00:03:17.410> to<00:03:17.530> take<00:03:17.739> a
