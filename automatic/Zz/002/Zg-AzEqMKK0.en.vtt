00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
actually not going to match just because

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.560 
actually not going to match just because
apparently<00:00:20.820> when<00:00:21.000> I<00:00:21.060> was<00:00:21.180> recording<00:00:21.359> with

apparently when I was recording with

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.269 
apparently when I was recording with
fraps<00:00:21.840> it<00:00:22.529> was<00:00:22.680> supposed<00:00:22.890> to<00:00:22.920> be<00:00:23.010> a<00:00:23.100> live

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.490 
fraps it was supposed to be a live
commentary<00:00:23.850> apparently<00:00:24.630> it<00:00:24.900> didn't<00:00:25.199> detect

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
commentary apparently it didn't detect

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.679 
commentary apparently it didn't detect
my<00:00:25.650> microphone<00:00:26.189> so<00:00:26.490> right<00:00:27.060> now<00:00:27.090> I'm<00:00:27.359> talking

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
my microphone so right now I'm talking

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.210 
my microphone so right now I'm talking
over<00:00:27.900> this<00:00:27.990> clip<00:00:28.260> with<00:00:28.380> sound<00:00:28.650> recorders<00:00:29.070> so

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
over this clip with sound recorders so

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.790 
over this clip with sound recorders so
that's<00:00:29.400> why<00:00:29.699> it<00:00:30.599> might<00:00:30.779> not<00:00:30.929> match<00:00:31.199> with<00:00:31.619> the

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
that's why it might not match with the

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.260 
that's why it might not match with the
clip<00:00:32.040> that<00:00:32.219> you're<00:00:32.460> seeing<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:32.940> my
