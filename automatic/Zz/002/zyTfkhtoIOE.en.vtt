of the previous EOS models when you look

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:33.500 
of the previous EOS models when you look
deeper<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:32.850> look<00:00:32.940> a<00:00:33.030> little<00:00:33.180> more<00:00:33.329> closely

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
deeper and look a little more closely

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.690 
deeper and look a little more closely
you<00:00:33.930> will<00:00:34.020> see<00:00:34.100> there<00:00:35.100> are<00:00:35.190> a<00:00:35.250> few<00:00:35.460> subtle

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
you will see there are a few subtle

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.639 
you will see there are a few subtle
changes<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:36.600> those<00:00:36.809> subtle<00:00:37.140> changes<00:00:37.530> have

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
changes and those subtle changes have

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.049 
changes and those subtle changes have
been<00:00:37.739> brought<00:00:37.950> about<00:00:38.250> by<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.579> feedback

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
been brought about by the feedback

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.760 
been brought about by the feedback
photographers<00:00:39.570> give<00:00:39.750> us<00:00:39.870> on<00:00:39.989> a<00:00:40.020> daily<00:00:40.290> basis

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
photographers give us on a daily basis

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.260 
photographers give us on a daily basis
so<00:00:41.309> whether<00:00:41.460> it's<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.670> way<00:00:41.790> a<00:00:41.820> buttons

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
so whether it's the way a buttons

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.030 
so whether it's the way a buttons
positioned<00:00:42.690> or<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:42.899> way<00:00:43.050> a<00:00:43.079> button<00:00:43.469> feels<00:00:43.770> and

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
positioned or the way a button feels and

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.840 
positioned or the way a button feels and
this<00:00:44.430> is<00:00:44.610> really<00:00:44.910> important<00:00:45.360> to<00:00:45.450> us<00:00:46.850> we've

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
this is really important to us we've

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.340 
this is really important to us we've
been<00:00:47.969> able<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.210> achieve<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.750> twelve<00:00:48.989> frames<00:00:49.170> a

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
been able to achieve the twelve frames a

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.650 
been able to achieve the twelve frames a
second<00:00:49.710> option<00:00:50.070> by<00:00:50.579> putting<00:00:50.969> in<00:00:51.090> a<00:00:51.180> new<00:00:51.360> mirror

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
second option by putting in a new mirror

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.720 
second option by putting in a new mirror
mechanism<00:00:52.289> that<00:00:52.710> powers<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.309> mirror<00:00:53.520> both

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
mechanism that powers the mirror both

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.029 
mechanism that powers the mirror both
upwards<00:00:54.300> and<00:00:54.480> downwards<00:00:54.539> which<00:00:55.530> means<00:00:55.770> it<00:00:55.890> has

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
upwards and downwards which means it has

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.069 
upwards and downwards which means it has
much<00:00:56.250> more<00:00:56.280> control<00:00:56.879> and<00:00:57.300> a<00:00:57.360> lot<00:00:57.539> less<00:00:57.780> mirror

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
much more control and a lot less mirror

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.470 
much more control and a lot less mirror
bounce<00:00:58.460> one<00:00:59.460> of<00:00:59.520> our<00:00:59.579> key<00:00:59.730> benefits<00:01:00.210> of<00:01:00.390> the

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
bounce one of our key benefits of the

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.779 
bounce one of our key benefits of the
new<00:01:00.510> mirror<00:01:00.930> mechanism<00:01:01.530> is<00:01:02.039> it's<00:01:02.309> much<00:01:02.579> more

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
new mirror mechanism is it's much more

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.520 
new mirror mechanism is it's much more
responsive<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:03.780> it<00:01:03.899> means<00:01:04.049> that<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.290> shutter

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
responsive and it means that the shutter

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.590 
responsive and it means that the shutter
lag<00:01:04.769> is<00:01:04.979> reduced<00:01:05.339> even<00:01:05.549> further<00:01:05.700> so<00:01:06.510> the

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
lag is reduced even further so the

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.750 
lag is reduced even further so the
photographer<00:01:06.840> really<00:01:07.560> feels<00:01:07.979> in<00:01:08.189> tune<00:01:08.490> with

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
photographer really feels in tune with

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.850 
photographer really feels in tune with
what<00:01:08.970> he's<00:01:09.119> shooting<00:01:09.540> and<00:01:09.689> his<00:01:10.140> reaction<00:01:10.740> is

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
what he's shooting and his reaction is

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.370 
what he's shooting and his reaction is
mirrored<00:01:11.250> by<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.460> camera<00:01:12.200> along<00:01:13.200> with<00:01:13.320> the

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
new mirror mechanism there's also a new

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.840 
new mirror mechanism there's also a new
shutter<00:01:15.479> unit<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.860> new<00:01:17.009> shutter<00:01:17.280> unit<00:01:17.670> has<00:01:17.820> a

durability of up to 400,000 cycles which

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.420 
durability of up to 400,000 cycles which
means<00:01:21.390> that<00:01:21.630> you<00:01:21.720> get<00:01:21.869> more<00:01:21.930> use<00:01:22.590> before<00:01:23.189> you

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
means that you get more use before you

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.890 
means that you get more use before you
need<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.670> have<00:01:23.880> your<00:01:24.000> shutter<00:01:24.150> unit<00:01:24.540> replaced

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
need to have your shutter unit replaced

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.929 
need to have your shutter unit replaced
one<00:01:25.860> of<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.009> major<00:01:26.159> differences<00:01:26.430> you'll<00:01:26.790> see
