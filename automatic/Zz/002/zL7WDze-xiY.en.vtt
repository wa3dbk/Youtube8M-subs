unsilenced version of the pdw-57 it has
50<00:00:30.300> rounds<00:00:30.570> in<00:00:30.660> each<00:00:30.720> magazine<00:00:30.960> which<00:00:31.289> is

definitely above average for the
submachine<00:00:33.059> guns<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:33.570> a<00:00:33.870> 2.6<00:00:34.530> second<00:00:34.860> reload

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
submachine guns and a 2.6 second reload

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.979 
submachine guns and a 2.6 second reload
time<00:00:35.430> which<00:00:35.579> is<00:00:35.670> all<00:00:35.820> right<00:00:35.969> I<00:00:36.000> guess<00:00:36.270> and<00:00:36.690> also

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
time which is all right I guess and also

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.290 
time which is all right I guess and also
as<00:00:37.140> a<00:00:37.260> point<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:37.950> second<00:00:38.399> 80's<00:00:38.790> time<00:00:38.969> or<00:00:39.149> aim

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
as a point to to second 80's time or aim

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.459 
as a point to to second 80's time or aim
down<00:00:39.480> sight<00:00:39.750> time<00:00:39.899> that's<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.140> time<00:00:40.290> it<00:00:40.379> takes

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
down sight time that's the time it takes

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:41.510 
down sight time that's the time it takes
you<00:00:40.590> to<00:00:40.649> aim<00:00:40.829> down<00:00:40.980> your<00:00:41.160> sights<00:00:41.280> with<00:00:41.460> the

now<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.490> axion<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.060> MSMC<00:01:39.450> is<00:01:39.840> average<00:01:40.290> which

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
now the axion the MSMC is average which

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.020 
now the axion the MSMC is average which
we<00:01:40.530> saw<00:01:40.710> in<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:40.860> PDW<00:01:41.369> is<00:01:41.460> actually<00:01:41.790> below

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
we saw in the PDW is actually below

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.160 
we saw in the PDW is actually below
average<00:01:42.180> so<00:01:42.479> it's<00:01:42.570> definitely<00:01:42.840> a<00:01:42.899> little<00:01:42.960> bit

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
average so it's definitely a little bit

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.230

40 well the PDW does deal less than that

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.999 
40 well the PDW does deal less than that
and<00:02:06.390> it<00:02:06.479> deals<00:02:06.630> an<00:02:06.810> 18<00:02:07.170> @<00:02:07.320> FR<00:02:07.560> range<00:02:07.799> like<00:02:07.950> i

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
and it deals an 18 @ FR range like i

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.559 
and it deals an 18 @ FR range like i
said<00:02:08.190> not<00:02:08.310> too<00:02:08.520> much<00:02:08.640> but<00:02:09.060> of<00:02:09.179> course<00:02:09.360> it<00:02:09.450> is<00:02:09.539> a

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
said not too much but of course it is a

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:10.969 
said not too much but of course it is a
submachine<00:02:10.050> gun<00:02:10.200> which<00:02:10.319> is<00:02:10.470> meant<00:02:10.649> for<00:02:10.830> close

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
submachine gun which is meant for close

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.830 
submachine gun which is meant for close
range<00:02:11.129> engagements<00:02:11.520> for<00:02:12.060> a<00:02:12.480> close-range

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
range engagements for a close-range

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.640 
range engagements for a close-range
damage<00:02:13.140> per<00:02:13.290> bullet

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
damage per bullet

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.339 
damage per bullet
so<00:02:13.709> MSMC<00:02:14.280> deals<00:02:14.489> 40<00:02:14.849> well<00:02:14.970> the<00:02:15.060> pdw-57<00:02:15.599> only

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
so MSMC deals 40 well the pdw-57 only

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:19.009 
so MSMC deals 40 well the pdw-57 only
deals<00:02:16.620> 35<00:02:17.099> so<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.430> MSMC<00:02:17.909> wins<00:02:18.540> in<00:02:18.720> close<00:02:18.900> range

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
deals 35 so the MSMC wins in close range

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:20.600 
deals 35 so the MSMC wins in close range
damage<00:02:19.290> per<00:02:19.530> bullet<00:02:19.680> and<00:02:19.980> they're<00:02:20.280> both<00:02:20.400> tied

the<00:02:50.010> pw<00:02:50.459> is<00:02:50.489> a<00:02:50.609> huge<00:02:51.299> magazine<00:02:51.720> compared<00:02:51.930> to

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
the pw is a huge magazine compared to

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.020 
the pw is a huge magazine compared to
the<00:02:52.079> MSMC<00:02:52.500> 50<00:02:53.069> rounds<00:02:53.370> compared<00:02:53.639> to<00:02:53.700> 30<00:02:53.879> that's

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
the MSMC 50 rounds compared to 30 that's

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.369 
the MSMC 50 rounds compared to 30 that's
a<00:02:54.090> difference<00:02:54.450> in<00:02:54.569> 20<00:02:54.930> rounds<00:02:55.200> which<00:02:55.290> is

00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:55.379 
a difference in 20 rounds which is

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:57.410 
a difference in 20 rounds which is
almost<00:02:55.530> a<00:02:55.709> separate<00:02:55.980> magazine<00:02:56.340> in<00:02:56.519> itself<00:02:56.849> so

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
almost a separate magazine in itself so

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.059 
almost a separate magazine in itself so
definitely<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:57.840> pw<00:02:58.260> picks<00:02:58.409> up<00:02:58.530> the<00:02:58.680> win<00:02:58.709> on

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
definitely the pw picks up the win on

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:00.890 
definitely the pw picks up the win on
that<00:02:59.220> and<00:02:59.459> at<00:02:59.760> close<00:02:59.879> range<00:03:00.209> chest<00:03:00.540> shots<00:03:00.720> to

00:03:08.899 --> 00:03:08.909 
the MSMC like I said does deal a little

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:10.580 
the MSMC like I said does deal a little
bit<00:03:09.090> better<00:03:09.359> of<00:03:09.480> a<00:03:09.689> close-range<00:03:10.139> damage<00:03:10.439> per

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
bit better of a close-range damage per

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.259

bullet<00:03:10.739> well<00:03:11.159> the<00:03:11.250> PDW<00:03:11.670> does<00:03:11.819> deal<00:03:12.030> a<00:03:12.060> little

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
bullet well the PDW does deal a little

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:13.610 
bullet well the PDW does deal a little
bit<00:03:12.450> better<00:03:12.540> of<00:03:12.659> a<00:03:12.810> long-range<00:03:13.170> amateur

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
bit better of a long-range amateur

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.559 
bit better of a long-range amateur
bullets<00:03:13.859> i<00:03:13.950> would<00:03:14.099> recommend<00:03:14.459> the<00:03:14.549> MSMC<00:03:14.879> but

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:15.569 
bullets i would recommend the MSMC but

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:16.729 
bullets i would recommend the MSMC but
like<00:03:15.720> i<00:03:15.840> said<00:03:15.870> it<00:03:16.139> does<00:03:16.409> come<00:03:16.590> down<00:03:16.620> to

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739
