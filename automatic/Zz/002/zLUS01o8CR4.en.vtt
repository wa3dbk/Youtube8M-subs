for<00:01:19.439> bass<00:01:19.710> crankbaits<00:01:20.369> don't<00:01:20.580> get<00:01:20.700> me<00:01:20.790> wrong

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
for bass crankbaits don't get me wrong

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.580 
for bass crankbaits don't get me wrong
there's<00:01:21.210> giant<00:01:21.420> crank<00:01:21.810> baits<00:01:22.020> out<00:01:22.170> there<00:01:22.409> but

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590

quick<00:03:24.440> that's<00:03:25.069> your<00:03:25.280> graphite<00:03:25.669> your

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:25.849 
quick that's your graphite your

quick that's your graphite your
fiberglass<00:03:26.359> is<00:03:26.569> a<00:03:26.599> little<00:03:27.139> bit<00:03:27.290> more<00:03:27.530> limber

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:27.859 
fiberglass is a little bit more limber

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:31.030 
fiberglass is a little bit more limber
but<00:03:28.519> fiberglass<00:03:29.150> is<00:03:29.359> stronger<00:03:30.079> then<00:03:30.470> graphite

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
but fiberglass is stronger then graphite

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.819 
but fiberglass is stronger then graphite
and<00:03:31.310> graphite<00:03:31.819> is<00:03:32.060> lighter<00:03:32.690> and<00:03:33.290> a<00:03:33.379> little<00:03:33.709> bit

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:33.829 
and graphite is lighter and a little bit

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:36.580 
and graphite is lighter and a little bit
faster<00:03:34.099> and<00:03:34.519> snappier<00:03:35.139> when<00:03:36.139> it<00:03:36.230> comes<00:03:36.409> to

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
faster and snappier when it comes to

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.319 
faster and snappier when it comes to
bass<00:03:36.769> fishing<00:03:37.310> you're<00:03:37.790> going<00:03:37.909> to<00:03:37.970> hear<00:03:38.090> a<00:03:38.150> lot

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:38.329 
bass fishing you're going to hear a lot

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:41.020 
bass fishing you're going to hear a lot
of<00:03:38.480> guys<00:03:38.659> the<00:03:39.379> older<00:03:39.949> crop<00:03:40.250> back<00:03:40.760> in<00:03:40.909> the<00:03:40.970> early

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
of guys the older crop back in the early

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.059 
of guys the older crop back in the early
90s<00:03:41.659> they<00:03:41.840> mentioned<00:03:42.229> fishing<00:03:42.530> fiberglass

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:43.069 
90s they mentioned fishing fiberglass

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:45.460 
90s they mentioned fishing fiberglass
rods<00:03:43.519> for<00:03:44.510> their<00:03:44.629> crank<00:03:44.959> baits<00:03:45.199> and<00:03:45.409> the

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
rods for their crank baits and the

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.500 
rods for their crank baits and the
reason<00:03:45.799> for<00:03:45.979> that<00:03:46.010> is<00:03:46.370> it<00:03:46.639> would<00:03:46.819> load<00:03:47.180> up<00:03:47.209> a

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
reason for that is it would load up a

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.569 
reason for that is it would load up a
little<00:03:47.840> bit<00:03:48.019> slower<00:03:48.470> so<00:03:48.829> those<00:03:49.010> treble<00:03:49.400> hooks

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:49.579 
little bit slower so those treble hooks

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:51.640 
little bit slower so those treble hooks
wouldn't<00:03:49.909> rip<00:03:50.090> out<00:03:50.299> so<00:03:51.169> that's<00:03:51.349> where

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
wouldn't rip out so that's where

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.530 
wouldn't rip out so that's where
fiberglass<00:03:52.220> came<00:03:52.489> into<00:03:52.669> bass<00:03:52.879> fishing<00:03:53.329> but

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
fiberglass came into bass fishing but

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:54.909 
fiberglass came into bass fishing but
now<00:03:53.720> a<00:03:53.750> lot<00:03:54.019> of<00:03:54.139> guys<00:03:54.260> are<00:03:54.290> going<00:03:54.680> to<00:03:54.769> those

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:54.919 
now a lot of guys are going to those

00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:57.460 
now a lot of guys are going to those
carbon<00:03:55.760> fiber<00:03:56.000> choices<00:03:56.540> but<00:03:56.810> to<00:03:57.019> answer<00:03:57.199> the

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
carbon fiber choices but to answer the

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.949 
carbon fiber choices but to answer the
question<00:03:57.859> fiberglass<00:03:58.489> it<00:03:58.729> is<00:03:59.389> stronger<00:03:59.840> than

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
question fiberglass it is stronger than

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:02.589 
question fiberglass it is stronger than
graphite<00:04:00.440> and<00:04:00.650> graphite<00:04:01.549> is<00:04:01.790> lighter<00:04:02.479> than

00:04:02.589 --> 00:04:02.599 
graphite and graphite is lighter than

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:05.140 
graphite and graphite is lighter than
your<00:04:02.959> fiberglass<00:04:03.560> and<00:04:03.909> which<00:04:04.909> one<00:04:05.120> was

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
your fiberglass and which one was

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:06.819 
your fiberglass and which one was
stronger<00:04:05.629> that<00:04:05.810> was<00:04:05.959> the<00:04:06.079> question<00:04:06.260> so<00:04:06.620> that's

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:06.829 
stronger that was the question so that's

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:11.610 
stronger that was the question so that's
your<00:04:06.979> answer<00:04:07.129> for<00:04:07.310> that<00:04:07.519> one<00:04:09.760> next<00:04:10.760> question

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
your answer for that one next question

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
I'm going to suggest for your spinning

I'm going to suggest for your spinning
rods<00:05:27.240> here<00:05:27.479> is<00:05:27.659> most<00:05:27.900> spinning<00:05:28.289> reels<00:05:28.470> are<00:05:28.650> not

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:28.830 
rods here is most spinning reels are not

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:30.860 
rods here is most spinning reels are not
that<00:05:29.070> fast<00:05:29.370> they<00:05:29.639> don't<00:05:29.759> pick<00:05:30.060> up<00:05:30.210> line<00:05:30.449> as

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:30.870 
that fast they don't pick up line as

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:33.110 
that fast they don't pick up line as
fast<00:05:31.139> as<00:05:31.289> a<00:05:31.320> baitcasting<00:05:32.070> reel<00:05:32.280> so<00:05:32.759> what<00:05:32.969> you

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120 
fast as a baitcasting reel so what you

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.730 
fast as a baitcasting reel so what you
might<00:05:33.330> want<00:05:33.570> to<00:05:33.659> do<00:05:33.780> here<00:05:34.169> to<00:05:34.380> make<00:05:34.530> up<00:05:34.710> for

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 
might want to do here to make up for

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.399 
might want to do here to make up for
that<00:05:34.949> subtle<00:05:35.490> change<00:05:35.820> from<00:05:36.719> baitcasting

00:05:37.399 --> 00:05:37.409 
that subtle change from baitcasting

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:40.310 
that subtle change from baitcasting
versus<00:05:37.770> spinning<00:05:38.280> is<00:05:38.430> use<00:05:38.699> a<00:05:38.940> moderate<00:05:39.570> fast

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:40.320 
versus spinning is use a moderate fast

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.399 
versus spinning is use a moderate fast
raw<00:05:40.800> Rob<00:05:41.280> that<00:05:41.430> bends<00:05:41.789> just<00:05:42.690> above<00:05:42.930> the<00:05:42.990> middle

00:05:43.399 --> 00:05:43.409 
raw Rob that bends just above the middle

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:45.620 
raw Rob that bends just above the middle
or<00:05:43.650> even<00:05:44.009> a<00:05:44.070> completely<00:05:44.669> moderate<00:05:45.120> rod<00:05:45.360> and

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:45.630 
or even a completely moderate rod and

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:47.510 
or even a completely moderate rod and
the<00:05:45.719> reason<00:05:46.050> for<00:05:46.080> that<00:05:46.289> is<00:05:46.620> if<00:05:46.860> the<00:05:46.979> bass<00:05:47.130> swims

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:47.520 
the reason for that is if the bass swims

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.999 
the reason for that is if the bass swims
at<00:05:47.699> you<00:05:48.150> and<00:05:48.419> you<00:05:48.930> can't<00:05:49.169> catch<00:05:49.409> up<00:05:49.620> line<00:05:49.830> in

at you and you can't catch up line in

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:51.920 
at you and you can't catch up line in
time<00:05:50.190> hopefully<00:05:50.820> you<00:05:51.150> had<00:05:51.270> enough<00:05:51.539> bend<00:05:51.810> in

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:51.930

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:53.400 
that rod to wear that raw it's going to

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.459 
that rod to wear that raw it's going to
suck<00:05:53.580> up<00:05:53.789> a<00:05:53.909> lot<00:05:53.940> of<00:05:54.180> free<00:05:54.389> time<00:05:54.419> a<00:05:54.900> lot<00:05:55.289> of<00:05:55.380> that
