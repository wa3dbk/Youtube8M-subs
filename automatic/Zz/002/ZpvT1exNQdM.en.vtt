I say and there's a little button right
there

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
there

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:26.759 
there
you<00:03:21.170> just<00:03:21.530> press<00:03:22.480> shoot<00:03:23.480> it<00:03:24.190> pretty<00:03:25.190> cool

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
you just press shoot it pretty cool

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:29.229 
you just press shoot it pretty cool
spring-loaded<00:03:27.769> so<00:03:28.220> it'll<00:03:28.640> snap<00:03:28.940> back<00:03:29.209> into

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
spring-loaded so it'll snap back into

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:30.930 
spring-loaded so it'll snap back into
place

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
place

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.260 
place
let's<00:03:31.940> make<00:03:32.090> sure<00:03:32.120> I<00:03:32.239> put<00:03:32.390> in<00:03:32.510> the<00:03:32.660> right<00:03:32.810> way

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:35.270 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:40.900 

and<00:03:35.810> then<00:03:36.020> the<00:03:36.680> other<00:03:36.820> arm<00:03:37.820> has<00:03:38.120> a<00:03:39.040> claw<00:03:40.040> here

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
and then the other arm has a claw here

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.870 
and then the other arm has a claw here
the<00:03:41.510> that's<00:03:42.080> a<00:03:42.200> really<00:03:42.470> nice<00:03:42.880> articulation

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880 
the that's a really nice articulation

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.880 
the that's a really nice articulation
can<00:03:44.360> rotate<00:03:44.540> it<00:03:44.900> around<00:03:45.490> the<00:03:46.490> wrist<00:03:46.760> and<00:03:47.120> then

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890 
can rotate it around the wrist and then

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:56.910 
can rotate it around the wrist and then
rotate<00:03:48.890> it<00:03:48.920> open<00:03:49.370> and<00:03:49.520> close<00:03:49.700> very<00:03:50.630> nice

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.160 

moving<00:03:57.920> down<00:03:58.390> ball<00:03:59.390> turning<00:03:59.690> upper<00:03:59.930> legs

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
moving down ball turning upper legs

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:05.520 
moving down ball turning upper legs
right<00:04:00.920> here<00:04:01.160> it's<00:04:02.120> a<00:04:02.240> nice<00:04:02.450> range<00:04:03.310> rotations

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
right here it's a nice range rotations

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:11.040 
right here it's a nice range rotations
and<00:04:06.530> ball<00:04:06.800> and<00:04:08.350> foot<00:04:09.350> butter<00:04:09.980> excuse<00:04:10.280> me<00:04:10.430> knee

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.050 
and ball and foot butter excuse me knee

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:15.690 
and ball and foot butter excuse me knee
it's<00:04:12.050> like<00:04:12.200> to<00:04:12.320> say<00:04:12.350> moving<00:04:12.770> on<00:04:12.890> the<00:04:12.980> foot<00:04:13.250> and

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.670 

for<00:04:16.700> them<00:04:16.850> back<00:04:17.000> rotation<00:04:17.540> and<00:04:17.840> 360<00:04:18.560> rotation

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
for them back rotation and 360 rotation

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:24.390 
for them back rotation and 360 rotation
so<00:04:19.330> really<00:04:20.330> nice<00:04:21.310> articulation<00:04:22.570> joints<00:04:23.570> are

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400
