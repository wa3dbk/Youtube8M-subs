support<00:01:36.530> so<00:01:36.920> I<00:01:37.190> don't<00:01:38.150> know<00:01:38.210> how<00:01:38.300> much

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:38.480 
support so I don't know how much

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.120 
support so I don't know how much
difference<00:01:38.900> he<00:01:38.960> actually<00:01:39.380> does<00:01:39.560> make<00:01:39.800> you

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
difference he actually does make you

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.300 
difference he actually does make you
know<00:01:40.870> but<00:01:41.870> the<00:01:42.350> main<00:01:42.530> thing<00:01:42.800> is<00:01:42.830> bottom<00:01:43.220> at

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
know but the main thing is bottom at

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:44.740 
know but the main thing is bottom at
carburettor<00:01:43.760> you've<00:01:43.940> got<00:01:44.060> a<00:01:44.090> little<00:01:44.300> solenoid

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
carburettor you've got a little solenoid

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.800 
carburettor you've got a little solenoid
what<00:01:45.340> it<00:01:46.340> reacts<00:01:46.640> we<00:01:46.850> have<00:01:46.970> lot<00:01:47.210> but<00:01:47.630> it<00:01:47.720> only

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
what it reacts we have lot but it only

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.510 
what it reacts we have lot but it only
works<00:01:47.930> in<00:01:48.290> fest<00:01:48.530> for<00:01:48.680> a<00:01:48.770> year<00:01:49.040> so<00:01:49.190> it's<00:01:49.340> like<00:01:49.490> a

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
works in fest for a year so it's like a

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.750 
works in fest for a year so it's like a
two<00:01:50.180> wheeler<00:01:50.390> device<00:01:51.070> get<00:01:52.070> that<00:01:52.250> blocked<00:01:52.520> off

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:52.760 
two wheeler device get that blocked off

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.790 
two wheeler device get that blocked off
are<00:01:53.000> removed<00:01:53.420> whichever<00:01:54.050> that'll<00:01:54.590> transform

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:54.800 
are removed whichever that'll transform

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.719 
are removed whichever that'll transform
it<00:01:55.460> gosh<00:01:56.450> got<00:01:56.690> our<00:01:56.810> honors<00:01:57.440> I<00:01:57.710> have<00:01:58.250> an<00:01:58.370> I<00:01:58.520> love
