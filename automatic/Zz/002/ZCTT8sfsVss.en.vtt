00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:12.950
 mouth organ firm with sounds I turn on 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:17.299
 or the tombs of the second coffin is 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.299
 appearance so here so correctly 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:25.380
 folk master brin rolka here and cogs with 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.849
 one side and the other not 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.800
 very convenient and parsing here too 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.430
 we are registered highest registered 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:39.660
 quality 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:42.930
 and what kind of m hand do you see it 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:46.980
 looks very gleaming for glitters 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:59.609
 and gleams here and 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:01:01.829
 sound on the exhale and inhale the sound 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.660
 harmonica is very similar to the old 8-bit 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:10.200
 consoles can remember here type 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:16.939
 dandy there were similar sounds in mario like 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.939
 collecting coins when i drink coins 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.400
 for some reason reminds me of playing on 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.290
 Feeding trough learn in principle not difficult 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.939
 for a couple of days you can learn some 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.630
 simple melodies on the internet a lot i 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:32.970
 something more or less tried not very 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.610
 Of course this comes out but something 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.970
 Looks like the first melody is the size of the retry. 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.970
 demolition 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:02:03.120
 so that you understand what it was about to stumble and 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.120
 grasshopper 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:29.250
 Well, in the end, as always, lost in general 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.780
 that's how it sounds nothing difficult 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.000
 melodies it turns out interesting principle 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.400
 even if you can't play, you can 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:53.200
 something there to come up with legs and turn out 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:56.020
 some kind of irish german there something 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.910
 in this style is a very interesting toy I 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:00.550
 honestly happy never thought that 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:02.640
 like everything else read in 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.640
