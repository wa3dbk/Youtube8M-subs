00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.689
 Here is the side 

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:10.219
 What kind of case do you put on your iphone case ? 

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:14.179
 After all I want to bring out the individuality and I think whether it has been variously devised by everyone 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:19.610
 But I'm a barber now 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:20.869
 Nan'nimo you I did not put the case is it an interesting iphone case came out 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:22.110
 In saying 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:26.760
 From plastic child's 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:33.150
 I sent you a sample product 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:37.510
 The presence of this case but it is interesting call I say this case itself is it shiny 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:41.240
 Let's try and install it 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:44.780
 Yes, I will open it 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:48.170
 This is the only thing that is included 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:54.890
 There is nothing behind you to put out 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:56.450
 Instructions are written in English When you go to Bravo's site, instructions are written in Japanese 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.540
 There is 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:05.540
 This Let's put Well But you know anyway 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:08.780
 Even if you don't eat and read the description , you can see immediately if you look at this video, so it's just a transparent case 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:16.470
 You can see the patterns in your mind 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:22.620
 No batteries, no need to store light in the port 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:23.100
 I will attach to iphone If it is stuck with a snap it will not shine separately 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.940
 right 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:34.230
 So if you called the I do not know how to illuminate it 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:36.690
 Open accessibility settings screen for general accessibility 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:39.909
 It is this in this 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:47.740
 led flash notification iron will 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:53.980
 Turn this on Now when you are on this LED lights up 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:59.910
 It's about trying to light this case itself using the light 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:59.910
 Let's make a phone call to see if it glows in this state 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.970
 Do you think that allotment is lighted 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.960
 Shining light 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.410
 It is cool 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:22.819
 hey 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:26.480
 Don't pull it so wide I'll reflect the light of the flash here 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:32.090
 Let the silicon glow ぇ This is a nice little ー 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:33.499
 What I was light shiny I mean that yes when you want to support the flash of this camera 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:38.450
 Is this 

00:02:33.499 --> 00:02:41.819
 I'd like to open the 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:44.969
 Then let's attach one more person a little 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:47.969
 Yes what kind of feeling is this 

00:02:44.969 --> 00:02:51.799
 I can see the pattern already 

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:51.799
 Let's take it with the relocation 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.920
 This is also interesting I 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.300
 I like this 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:09.620
 And when you don't want to light this case turn off this led flash notification 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:13.489
 It is to say that 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:19.159
 Just let 's go this while operating the iphone 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:23.000
 When that is I'm not light this guy in such a standby state only 

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:29.180
 It this is I'm shining this led flash 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:30.340
 The thing I introduced this time is to manage the incoming call of iphone but let me know 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:34.000
 Give me 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:37.400
 Light up case for iphone 5 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:42.829
 It was 5 s 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:47.150
 It looks like there are other cases of black and gold and strong here too 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:52.060
 I wish i could say that my iphone is black 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:52.060
 Black would be better after all
