to kind of block the strumming pattern
out<00:02:39.110> you<00:02:39.260> can't<00:02:39.470> really<00:02:39.590> hear<00:02:39.770> it<00:02:39.860> that<00:02:40.010> well

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
out you can't really hear it that well

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.940 
out you can't really hear it that well
but<00:02:40.630> if<00:02:41.630> you<00:02:41.810> play<00:02:41.989> written<00:02:42.140> rhythm<00:02:42.650> guitar

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
that's how you play it okay

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:50.920 
that's how you play it okay
so<00:02:44.510> it's<00:02:44.989> going<00:02:45.200> to<00:02:45.319> be<00:02:45.440> pluck<00:02:48.310> so<00:02:49.310> pluck<00:02:50.030> the

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
so it's going to be pluck so pluck the

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.320 
so it's going to be pluck so pluck the
lowest<00:02:51.410> note<00:02:51.680> in<00:02:51.890> the<00:02:52.010> chord<00:02:52.220> okay<00:02:52.610> so<00:02:52.940> on<00:02:53.120> G

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
lowest note in the chord okay so on G

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.740 
lowest note in the chord okay so on G
for<00:02:53.540> example<00:02:53.569> plug<00:02:54.319> that<00:02:55.160> third<00:02:56.060> fret<00:02:56.510> E
