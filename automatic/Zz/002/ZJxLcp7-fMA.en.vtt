however this one's an s4 dual core so it

00:04:02.419 --> 00:04:05.589 
however this one's an s4 dual core so it
has<00:04:02.979> clocked<00:04:03.979> on<00:04:04.220> quadrant<00:04:04.819> you<00:04:05.479> know

00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:05.599 
has clocked on quadrant you know

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:10.300 
has clocked on quadrant you know
generally<00:04:06.109> around<00:04:06.290> the<00:04:07.449> 4900<00:04:08.620> 5,000<00:04:09.620> range<00:04:09.829> so

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
generally around the 4900 5,000 range so

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.839
