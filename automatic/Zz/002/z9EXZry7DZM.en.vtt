00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:11.070
 Today I'm going to show you this vest that 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.379
 It is made in one piece and everything is with 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.560
 chains and massifs then we go to 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:19.770
 start with a base chain let's 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.830
 start first making 60 chains and 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:26.160
 joining with a low point to do the 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:29.970
 first the first fringe then they will do 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.769
 305 chains that will be the basis of 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.170
 all the vest we are going to face and 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:37.500
 back at the same time and then they go to 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:40.260
 be another 60 chains I'm going to 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.780
 teach here to do the fringe of the 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.300
 another side I tell you that this is super 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.699
 easy it sounds with many chains but 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.410
 The truth is that making chains is 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:51.899
 super easy is the first thing that we 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:55.440
 grandmothers teach when they teach us 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.050
 to knit we make the chains and we're going 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.990
 to join 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:05.200
 with the first one with a half point 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:06.760
 in this way we are going to make the fringe of 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.370
 down here I am doing them in 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.650
 small but good we have the fringe 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:15.750
 and the point is super easy, let's do 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:17.910
 massifs then we climb with 3 chains 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:22.020
 this will have our first 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:25.450
 solid in the following chain we will 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.700
 make another massif 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:31.899
 in the next other in total our 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:33.939
 stitch are going to be 5 solid and 15 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:36.750
 chains to give the draft then 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:41.290
 I've been here 3 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:45.659
 I make the fourth solid and 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:48.659
 we make the fifth massif 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:52.259
 this is the part of the massifs we make 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:54.600
 15 chains in the air that will give us the 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.970
 part of the draft if you want 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.920
 Littlest can do 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.870
 but I like it quite well 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.050
 so that they can also put it 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:06.930
 can use as well as beach exit and 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.640
 then 15 chains are skipped below and 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.490
 here I have them marked with a security 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.730
 so as not to have to count them and go back to 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.730
 do 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.350
 there are 25 in gases 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.840
 and that's how the whole garment will be 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:28.019
 all 305 chains are going to knit 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.120
 with this exhibition 5 solid and 15 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:32.640
 I'll show you here how 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.010
 they will stay here at the table so 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:38.430
 will be leaving them will have their 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:40.230
 fringes on both sides your stitch and 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.110
 then the only thing we are going to do is to 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:46.310
 make the neckline what we need is 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:49.440
 that when you have already 16 laps 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:52.410
 in the next turn they will knit nothing 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.989
 more up to half and from there they go to 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.650
 come back then realize that 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.650
 this is my half 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:03.010
 I finish my 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:07.770
 I finish my file and I get up with 3 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.770
 chains and I'm going to return 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:14.019
 I'm going back here to do the 

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:14.019
 neckline opening 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.459
 this is very simple let's continue 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:23.980
 weaving exactly the same thing we're going to do 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:26.980
 4 half turns to achieve the neckline 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:29.080
 with the same stitch and then we're going to 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.900
 go back to do the other side we're going to 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:34.090
 do 16 laps again so that they 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.670
 it is as colorful as what we saw 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:39.099
 right now they can do every turn of a 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:42.549
 different color and then the only thing that they go 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:45.670
 to do is that they are going to fold their garment to 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:48.069
 half and they are going to sew a part for 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:50.019
 the sides and ready have a vest 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:52.989
 very easy divine that they can only 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:56.250
 win in 2 afternoon and you can 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:56.250
 look easy
