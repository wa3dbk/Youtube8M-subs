from b8 is coming to 6 - the most
natural<00:02:54.790> square<00:02:55.790> so<00:02:56.299> the<00:02:56.510> bishop<00:02:56.720> could<00:02:57.080> be

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
natural square so the bishop could be

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.280

quite similar to the scourge gambit or

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.380 
quite similar to the scourge gambit or
all<00:03:34.090> different

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
all different

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:37.690 
all different
gambits<00:03:35.959> we<00:03:36.109> already<00:03:36.410> studied<00:03:37.040> like

Scandinavian gambit when black is having
much<00:03:40.910> better<00:03:40.940> development<00:03:41.930> of<00:03:42.109> all<00:03:42.260> his

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
much better development of all his

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.680 
much better development of all his
pieces<00:03:42.769> so<00:03:43.459> minor<00:03:43.730> piece<00:03:44.000> is<00:03:44.150> very<00:03:44.180> fast

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
pieces so minor piece is very fast
