and<00:00:01.350> everyone<00:00:01.709> hears<00:00:02.010> the<00:00:02.159> exi<00:00:03.030> 250<00:00:03.540> I've<00:00:03.659> had

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
and everyone hears the exi 250 I've had

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:05.900 
and everyone hears the exi 250 I've had
and<00:00:04.140> I've<00:00:04.740> been<00:00:04.859> having<00:00:05.130> big<00:00:05.310> problems<00:00:05.490> with

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
and I've been having big problems with

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.839 
and I've been having big problems with
this<00:00:06.089> Dutch<00:00:06.629> from<00:00:06.899> gyro<00:00:07.519> holding<00:00:08.519> the<00:00:08.610> tail<00:00:08.790> I

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
this Dutch from gyro holding the tail I

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:10.850 
this Dutch from gyro holding the tail I
get<00:00:09.090> tons<00:00:09.330> of<00:00:09.480> wag<00:00:09.660> I<00:00:09.990> have<00:00:10.170> to<00:00:10.290> stop<00:00:10.500> my<00:00:10.590> gyro

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
get tons of wag I have to stop my gyro

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.640 
get tons of wag I have to stop my gyro
gain<00:00:11.130> down<00:00:11.370> to<00:00:11.580> like<00:00:11.730> 30<00:00:12.030> to<00:00:12.990> get<00:00:13.290> it<00:00:13.440> to<00:00:13.530> be

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
gain down to like 30 to get it to be

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.499 
gain down to like 30 to get it to be
steady<00:00:13.980> but<00:00:14.400> then<00:00:14.580> I<00:00:14.610> don't<00:00:14.880> have<00:00:15.059> any<00:00:15.179> heading

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
steady but then I don't have any heading

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.529 
steady but then I don't have any heading
hold<00:00:15.690> so<00:00:16.940> decided<00:00:17.940> to<00:00:18.000> go<00:00:18.090> ahead<00:00:18.180> and<00:00:18.359> try<00:00:18.510> it

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
hold so decided to go ahead and try it

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.870 
hold so decided to go ahead and try it
better<00:00:18.779> gyro<00:00:19.109> so<00:00:19.650> we<00:00:19.800> got<00:00:19.949> the<00:00:20.130> J<00:00:22.279> rg27<00:00:23.279> t3d

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
better gyro so we got the J rg27 t3d

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.750 
better gyro so we got the J rg27 t3d
gyro<00:00:24.390> this<00:00:24.779> is<00:00:24.960> a<00:00:24.990> mems<00:00:25.289> geral<00:00:25.769> he<00:00:26.369> works<00:00:26.580> on

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
gyro this is a mems geral he works on

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.660 
gyro this is a mems geral he works on
the<00:00:26.910> MEMS<00:00:27.150> sensor<00:00:27.859> whereas<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:29.099> old<00:00:29.250> a<00:00:29.369> gyro

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
the MEMS sensor whereas the old a gyro

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.250 
the MEMS sensor whereas the old a gyro
that<00:00:29.820> I<00:00:29.880> got<00:00:30.029> here<00:00:30.359> and<00:00:30.480> most<00:00:30.599> jurors<00:00:30.840> that<00:00:31.109> are

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
that I got here and most jurors that are

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.920 
that I got here and most jurors that are
the<00:00:31.700> less<00:00:32.700> expensive<00:00:33.000> jerez<00:00:33.480> they're<00:00:33.630> mostly

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
the less expensive jerez they're mostly

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.389 
the less expensive jerez they're mostly
pizzo<00:00:35.570> piezoelectric<00:00:36.570> ceramic<00:00:37.440> sensors<00:00:37.860> so

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
pizzo piezoelectric ceramic sensors so

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:39.770 
pizzo piezoelectric ceramic sensors so
they're<00:00:38.640> okay<00:00:38.879> but<00:00:38.910> they<00:00:39.120> don't<00:00:39.270> work<00:00:39.390> is<00:00:39.540> good

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
they're okay but they don't work is good

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.000 
they're okay but they don't work is good
the<00:00:39.930> MEMS<00:00:40.140> I<00:00:40.290> supposed<00:00:40.530> to<00:00:40.559> be<00:00:40.680> a<00:00:40.710> lot<00:00:40.860> better

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
the MEMS I supposed to be a lot better

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.250 
the MEMS I supposed to be a lot better
so<00:00:41.790> we'll<00:00:41.940> be<00:00:42.030> testing<00:00:42.390> out<00:00:42.480> this<00:00:42.690> MEMS<00:00:42.960> jarrow

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
so we'll be testing out this MEMS jarrow

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.040 
so we'll be testing out this MEMS jarrow
and<00:00:43.500> then<00:00:43.620> we<00:00:44.430> also<00:00:44.550> got<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:44.789> JR<00:00:45.180> tail<00:00:45.420> servo<00:00:45.690> I

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
and then we also got a JR tail servo I

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.760 
and then we also got a JR tail servo I
think<00:00:46.770> it's<00:00:46.890> like<00:00:46.980> point<00:00:47.250> eight<00:00:47.399> seconds<00:00:47.850> or

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:48.770 
think it's like point eight seconds or

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.200 
think it's like point eight seconds or
let's<00:00:49.770> see<00:00:49.980> you<00:00:50.280> have<00:00:50.399> point<00:00:50.670> eight<00:00:50.789> seconds

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
let's see you have point eight seconds

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.430 
let's see you have point eight seconds
of<00:00:51.329> four<00:00:51.510> point<00:00:51.719> eight<00:00:51.809> volts<00:00:51.989> so<00:00:52.230> it's<00:00:52.350> pretty

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
of four point eight volts so it's pretty

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.590 
of four point eight volts so it's pretty
quick<00:00:52.710> servo<00:00:53.039> for<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.280> tail<00:00:53.460> so<00:00:54.420> we're<00:00:54.510> going

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
quick servo for the tail so we're going

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.479 
quick servo for the tail so we're going
to<00:00:54.690> go<00:00:54.750> ahead<00:00:54.780> outside<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.500> show<00:00:56.250> you<00:00:56.309> this

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
to go ahead outside and show you this

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.520 
to go ahead outside and show you this
helicopter<00:00:56.879> on<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.300> original<00:00:58.050> gyro<00:00:58.289> that<00:00:58.500> I

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
helicopter on the original gyro that I

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.439 
helicopter on the original gyro that I
got<00:00:58.710> in<00:00:58.859> here<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.670> then<00:00:59.850> we'll<00:00:59.940> go<00:01:00.090> ahead<00:01:00.300> and

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
got in here and then we'll go ahead and

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.869 
got in here and then we'll go ahead and
put<00:01:00.719> these<00:01:00.840> new<00:01:01.680> parts<00:01:02.010> in<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:02.370> test<00:01:02.670> it<00:01:02.820> out

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
put these new parts in and test it out

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.850 
put these new parts in and test it out
again<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:03.270> see<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.510> difference<00:01:03.840> so<00:01:04.080> here<00:01:04.769> we

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
again and see the difference so here we

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.390 
again and see the difference so here we
go<00:01:04.979> let's<00:01:05.220> go<00:01:05.369> test<00:01:05.729> it<00:01:05.820> outside<00:01:07.189> hey<00:01:08.189> guys

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
go let's go test it outside hey guys

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.679 
go let's go test it outside hey guys
we're<00:01:08.549> going<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:08.729> do<00:01:08.790> a<00:01:08.820> little<00:01:09.000> testing<00:01:09.420> here

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
we're going to do a little testing here

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.179 
we're going to do a little testing here
with<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.549> original<00:01:12.409> dsm-5<00:01:13.409> tail<00:01:13.650> servo<00:01:13.890> and

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
with the original dsm-5 tail servo and

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.380 
with the original dsm-5 tail servo and
the<00:01:14.430> Dutch<00:01:14.610> from<00:01:14.880> j<00:01:15.210> rho<00:01:15.390> gy<00:01:16.320> sandy<00:01:16.830> vijay<00:01:17.070> row

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
the Dutch from j rho gy sandy vijay row

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:25.350 
the Dutch from j rho gy sandy vijay row
now

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.810 

with<00:01:26.360> this<00:01:26.510> guy<00:01:26.810> role<00:01:27.250> i'm<00:01:28.250> going<00:01:28.400> to<00:01:28.490> show<00:01:28.790> you

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
with this guy role i'm going to show you

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.609 
with this guy role i'm going to show you
first<00:01:29.530> see<00:01:30.530> it<00:01:30.560> on<00:01:30.740> here<00:01:31.150> not<00:01:32.150> sure<00:01:32.360> if<00:01:32.450> you<00:01:32.479> can

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:32.619 
first see it on here not sure if you can

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:38.609 
first see it on here not sure if you can
but<00:01:33.619> i'm<00:01:34.060> going<00:01:35.060> to<00:01:35.150> set<00:01:35.690> my<00:01:35.720> gyro<00:01:36.200> up<00:01:36.790> 50<00:01:37.790> 75

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:38.619 
but i'm going to set my gyro up 50 75

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:43.060 
but i'm going to set my gyro up 50 75
let's<00:01:39.619> try<00:01:39.830> it<00:01:41.500> takes<00:01:42.500> a<00:01:42.590> second<00:01:42.860> for<00:01:42.890> this

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
let's try it takes a second for this

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:44.230 
let's try it takes a second for this
helicopter<00:01:43.400> to<00:01:43.670> start<00:01:43.820> up<00:01:43.970> it's<00:01:44.119> got<00:01:44.210> a

helicopter this gyro is a cheap like $12
gyro<00:02:08.580> somebody<00:02:09.509> gain<00:02:10.140> down<00:02:10.350> to<00:02:10.530> like<00:02:10.649> 45

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.370 

there's<00:02:15.030> a<00:02:15.090> lot<00:02:15.270> like<00:02:15.450> shape<00:02:15.720> right<00:02:15.959> now<00:02:15.990> right

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
there's a lot like shape right now right

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.710 
there's a lot like shape right now right
but<00:02:17.010> the<00:02:17.100> problem<00:02:17.489> is<00:02:19.850> still<00:02:20.850> shakes<00:02:21.150> my<00:02:21.360> pump

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
but the problem is still shakes my pump

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:28.699 
but the problem is still shakes my pump
with<00:02:21.870> rattle<00:02:26.060> and<00:02:27.060> the<00:02:27.870> problem<00:02:28.200> is<00:02:28.260> as<00:02:28.440> I<00:02:28.530> get

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
with rattle and the problem is as I get

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.010 
with rattle and the problem is as I get
lower<00:02:28.890> and<00:02:29.040> lower<00:02:29.280> with<00:02:29.580> my<00:02:29.730> rape<00:02:29.970> I<00:02:30.270> have<00:02:30.810> less

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
lower and lower with my rape I have less

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.750 
lower and lower with my rape I have less
and<00:02:31.200> less<00:02:31.260> heading<00:02:31.739> hold<00:02:31.950> and<00:02:32.190> the<00:02:32.430> wind<00:02:32.640> will

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
and less heading hold and the wind will

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.640 
and less heading hold and the wind will
start<00:02:33.000> pushing<00:02:33.300> around<00:02:33.390> my<00:02:33.570> tail<00:02:33.810> so<00:02:34.470> I<00:02:34.500> have

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
start pushing around my tail so I have

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:35.750 
start pushing around my tail so I have
to<00:02:34.739> go<00:02:34.830> down<00:02:34.980> to<00:02:35.010> like<00:02:35.220> thirty<00:02:35.519> five<00:02:35.730> percent

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
to go down to like thirty five percent

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.000 
to go down to like thirty five percent
to<00:02:36.300> get<00:02:36.420> no<00:02:36.600> tail<00:02:36.840> waggin<00:02:37.230> and<00:02:37.440> pumps<00:02:37.860> and

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
to get no tail waggin and pumps and

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.100 
to get no tail waggin and pumps and
stuff<00:02:38.090> so<00:02:39.090> this<00:02:39.239> driver<00:02:39.450> just<00:02:39.720> doesn't<00:02:39.780> work

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
stuff so this driver just doesn't work

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.550 
stuff so this driver just doesn't work
great<00:02:40.940> with<00:02:41.940> this<00:02:42.090> helicopter<00:02:42.480> I<00:02:42.930> have<00:02:43.380> had

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
great with this helicopter I have had

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.160 
great with this helicopter I have had
some<00:02:43.860> luck<00:02:44.040> with<00:02:44.160> this<00:02:44.280> gyro<00:02:44.640> but<00:02:45.050> we're<00:02:46.050> going

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
some luck with this gyro but we're going

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.770 
some luck with this gyro but we're going
to<00:02:46.230> try<00:02:46.290> putting<00:02:46.739> on<00:02:46.860> good<00:02:47.310> JR<00:02:47.819> mom's<00:02:48.090> gyro<00:02:48.540> and

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
to try putting on good JR mom's gyro and

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.720 
to try putting on good JR mom's gyro and
we're<00:02:49.200> going<00:02:49.319> to<00:02:49.350> take<00:02:49.530> a<00:02:49.590> look<00:02:50.340> and<00:02:50.519> see<00:02:50.580> what

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
we're going to take a look and see what

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.809 
we're going to take a look and see what
the<00:02:50.940> difference<00:02:51.269> is<00:02:51.420> so<00:02:51.630> here<00:02:51.810> we<00:02:51.870> go<00:02:52.819> alright

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
the difference is so here we go alright

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:55.340 
the difference is so here we go alright
it's<00:02:53.970> a<00:02:54.060> little<00:02:54.269> windy<00:02:54.390> but<00:02:54.600> now<00:02:54.840> we<00:02:54.900> got<00:02:55.140> the

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
it's a little windy but now we got the

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.050 
it's a little windy but now we got the
junior<00:02:56.040> 270<00:02:56.850> mums<00:02:57.060> general<00:02:57.510> I'm<00:02:57.720> going<00:02:58.019> to<00:02:58.260> be

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
junior 270 mums general I'm going to be

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.729 
junior 270 mums general I'm going to be
doing<00:03:00.060> the<00:03:00.269> first<00:03:00.480> test<00:03:00.780> here<00:03:01.050> so<00:03:01.290> i'ma<00:03:01.440> start

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
doing the first test here so i'ma start

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.960 
doing the first test here so i'ma start
the<00:03:01.950> gyro<00:03:02.310> adda<00:03:02.900> 62.5

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:17.930 

I<00:03:06.060> saw<00:03:06.660> that<00:03:06.900> really<00:03:16.430> all<00:03:17.430> right<00:03:17.520> seems<00:03:17.850> pretty

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
I saw that really all right seems pretty

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.760 
I saw that really all right seems pretty
screwed<00:03:18.420> right<00:03:18.630> now<00:03:18.690> a<00:03:19.170> little<00:03:19.800> bit<00:03:19.980> of

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:21.770 
screwed right now a little bit of

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:28.520 
screwed right now a little bit of
switching<00:03:22.770> my<00:03:22.890> pumps<00:03:23.340> kill<00:03:23.610> a<00:03:27.410> little<00:03:28.410> bit

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
switching my pumps kill a little bit

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:40.310 
switching my pumps kill a little bit
more

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:04:19.870 

let's<00:03:41.320> try<00:03:41.560> it

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.670 

actually<00:04:20.880> going<00:04:20.970> to<00:04:21.060> try<00:04:21.239> raising<00:04:22.139> up<00:04:22.500> my

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
actually going to try raising up my

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:28.340 
actually going to try raising up my
thing<00:04:23.670> a<00:04:23.730> little<00:04:26.750> raising<00:04:27.750> up<00:04:27.870> my<00:04:28.020> game<00:04:28.290> a

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 
thing a little raising up my game a

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.940 
thing a little raising up my game a
little<00:04:28.440> bit<00:04:28.680> actually<00:04:28.950> here<00:04:30.770> let's<00:04:31.770> go<00:04:31.889> to

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:31.950 
little bit actually here let's go to

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:35.000 
little bit actually here let's go to
jail<00:04:32.310> if<00:04:32.520> you<00:04:32.669> guys<00:04:32.910> can<00:04:33.120> see<00:04:33.150> it<00:04:33.510> go<00:04:34.440> back<00:04:34.800> up

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
jail if you guys can see it go back up

00:04:35.010 --> 00:05:41.910 
jail if you guys can see it go back up
to<00:04:35.190> 57<00:04:35.910> 360

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:41.920 

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:44.590 

alright<00:05:42.920> guys<00:05:43.160> so<00:05:43.520> you<00:05:43.580> just<00:05:43.910> saw<00:05:44.270> the<00:05:44.330> two

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:44.600 
alright guys so you just saw the two

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:52.830 
alright guys so you just saw the two
tests<00:05:45.110> and<00:05:45.230> you<00:05:45.890> saw<00:05:46.070> that<00:05:46.100> with<00:05:46.400> the<00:05:47.050> debt

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:52.840 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.000 

reminder<00:05:53.840> gain<00:05:54.110> all<00:05:54.320> the<00:05:54.350> way<00:05:54.500> down<00:05:54.650> to<00:05:54.680> like

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:55.010 
reminder gain all the way down to like

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:57.070 
reminder gain all the way down to like
thirty<00:05:55.370> five<00:05:55.610> to<00:05:55.910> forty<00:05:55.940> percent<00:05:56.540> to<00:05:56.810> get<00:05:56.960> the

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:57.080 
thirty five to forty percent to get the

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.340 
thirty five to forty percent to get the
tail<00:05:57.290> to<00:05:57.500> hold<00:05:57.770> smoothly<00:05:58.700> but<00:05:59.600> it<00:05:59.990> wouldn't

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:00.350 
tail to hold smoothly but it wouldn't

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:02.110 
tail to hold smoothly but it wouldn't
hold<00:06:00.530> the<00:06:00.770> heading<00:06:01.040> anymore<00:06:01.400> because<00:06:01.550> my<00:06:01.790> gyro

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:02.120 
hold the heading anymore because my gyro

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.080 
hold the heading anymore because my gyro
game<00:06:02.330> is<00:06:02.480> too<00:06:02.660> low<00:06:02.840> so<00:06:03.800> I<00:06:04.160> was<00:06:04.400> not<00:06:04.760> having<00:06:04.880> luck

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:05.090 
game is too low so I was not having luck

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:06.940 
game is too low so I was not having luck
with<00:06:05.120> this<00:06:05.360> as<00:06:05.570> you<00:06:05.690> saw<00:06:05.900> lots<00:06:06.380> of<00:06:06.500> twitching

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:06.950 
with this as you saw lots of twitching

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:11.230 
with this as you saw lots of twitching
we<00:06:07.790> went<00:06:07.970> ahead<00:06:08.060> and<00:06:08.360> put<00:06:08.570> in<00:06:08.600> the<00:06:09.130> gy<00:06:10.130> 270<00:06:10.940> gyro

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:11.240 
we went ahead and put in the gy 270 gyro

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:15.100 
we went ahead and put in the gy 270 gyro
by<00:06:11.540> jr<00:06:12.260> and<00:06:12.700> as<00:06:13.700> you<00:06:13.940> saw<00:06:14.120> i<00:06:14.150> had<00:06:14.270> my<00:06:14.540> gain<00:06:14.750> set

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:15.110 
by jr and as you saw i had my gain set

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:17.380 
by jr and as you saw i had my gain set
at<00:06:15.290> the<00:06:15.410> end<00:06:15.590> i<00:06:15.920> set<00:06:16.340> it<00:06:16.370> right<00:06:16.580> around<00:06:16.790> 260<00:06:17.300> and

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:17.390 
at the end i set it right around 260 and

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:19.840 
at the end i set it right around 260 and
i<00:06:17.570> was<00:06:17.690> getting<00:06:17.930> very<00:06:18.350> smooth<00:06:18.830> flight<00:06:19.130> i<00:06:19.370> think

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:19.850 
i was getting very smooth flight i think

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:21.010 
i was getting very smooth flight i think
i'm<00:06:19.940> actually<00:06:20.090> probably<00:06:20.360> going<00:06:20.570> to<00:06:20.630> lower<00:06:20.780> it

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:21.020 
i'm actually probably going to lower it

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:24.250 
i'm actually probably going to lower it
and<00:06:21.140> run<00:06:21.560> it<00:06:21.590> right<00:06:21.770> around<00:06:22.210> 57.5<00:06:23.210> seems<00:06:24.110> like

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:24.260 
and run it right around 57.5 seems like

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:25.750 
and run it right around 57.5 seems like
a<00:06:24.290> nice<00:06:24.500> sweet<00:06:24.800> spot<00:06:25.070> on<00:06:25.100> this<00:06:25.340> helicopter

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:25.760 
a nice sweet spot on this helicopter

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.480 
a nice sweet spot on this helicopter
with<00:06:26.240> this<00:06:26.420> gyro<00:06:26.780> but<00:06:27.500> as<00:06:27.620> you<00:06:27.740> saw<00:06:27.950> even<00:06:28.370> an

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:28.490 
with this gyro but as you saw even an

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:31.170 
with this gyro but as you saw even an
extreme<00:06:28.880> wind<00:06:29.180> it<00:06:29.510> was<00:06:29.660> holding<00:06:29.960> its<00:06:30.080> head<00:06:30.290> and

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:31.180 
extreme wind it was holding its head and

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:33.310 
extreme wind it was holding its head and
pumps<00:06:32.180> with<00:06:32.330> this<00:06:32.570> when<00:06:32.810> I<00:06:32.840> was<00:06:32.990> hitting<00:06:33.200> the

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:33.320 
pumps with this when I was hitting the

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.200 
pumps with this when I was hitting the
throttle<00:06:33.680> up<00:06:33.800> and<00:06:33.950> making<00:06:34.160> it<00:06:34.250> jump<00:06:34.940> up<00:06:35.060> a

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:35.210 
throttle up and making it jump up a

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:37.600 
throttle up and making it jump up a
little<00:06:35.420> bit<00:06:35.570> the<00:06:36.110> tail<00:06:36.350> was<00:06:36.380> not<00:06:36.890> wagging<00:06:37.400> so<00:06:37.580> I

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:37.610 
little bit the tail was not wagging so I

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:39.280 
little bit the tail was not wagging so I
was<00:06:37.760> able<00:06:37.850> to<00:06:37.970> set<00:06:38.270> this<00:06:38.420> gyro<00:06:38.810> all<00:06:39.020> the<00:06:39.110> way<00:06:39.200> up

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:39.290 
was able to set this gyro all the way up

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:41.230 
was able to set this gyro all the way up
to<00:06:39.320> 60<00:06:39.860> but<00:06:40.040> like<00:06:40.160> i<00:06:40.280> said<00:06:40.310> i<00:06:40.490> might<00:06:40.670> lower<00:06:40.880> it<00:06:41.090> a

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:41.240 
to 60 but like i said i might lower it a

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.150 
to 60 but like i said i might lower it a
couple<00:06:41.450> just<00:06:42.230> to<00:06:42.350> make<00:06:42.500> sure<00:06:42.530> that<00:06:42.890> i<00:06:42.919> never

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:43.160 
couple just to make sure that i never

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:48.220 
couple just to make sure that i never
get<00:06:43.340> any<00:06:43.550> twitching<00:06:45.190> but<00:06:46.570> very<00:06:47.570> nice<00:06:47.780> i'm<00:06:48.020> very

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:48.230

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:50.890 
get any twitching but very nice i'm very
happy<00:06:48.410> with<00:06:48.740> it<00:06:48.770> I<00:06:49.090> really<00:06:50.090> works<00:06:50.270> better<00:06:50.540> so

a little windy today and I'm not at the

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:57.940 
a little windy today and I'm not at the
park<00:06:56.810> I<00:06:56.960> was<00:06:57.080> just<00:06:57.200> flying<00:06:57.380> in<00:06:57.560> my<00:06:57.650> driveway

00:06:57.940 --> 00:06:57.950 
park I was just flying in my driveway

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:00.430 
park I was just flying in my driveway
just<00:06:58.190> doing<00:06:58.550> some<00:06:58.700> hovering<00:06:59.090> but<00:06:59.810> now<00:07:00.200> that<00:07:00.410> I

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:00.440 
just doing some hovering but now that I

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.800 
just doing some hovering but now that I
got<00:07:00.500> this<00:07:00.800> nice<00:07:01.010> gyro<00:07:01.490> in<00:07:01.640> here<00:07:01.880> pretty<00:07:02.570> soon

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:02.810 
got this nice gyro in here pretty soon

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:05.860 
got this nice gyro in here pretty soon
we'll<00:07:03.020> get<00:07:03.169> some<00:07:03.440> you<00:07:04.370> know<00:07:04.400> loops<00:07:04.820> rolls<00:07:05.120> some

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:05.870 
we'll get some you know loops rolls some

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:07.270 
we'll get some you know loops rolls some
inverted<00:07:06.260> hovering<00:07:06.620> and<00:07:06.710> stuff<00:07:06.950> with<00:07:07.130> this

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:07.280 
inverted hovering and stuff with this

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:11.409 
inverted hovering and stuff with this
250<00:07:08.060> here<00:07:08.090> so<00:07:09.020> stay<00:07:09.440> tuned<00:07:09.620> for<00:07:09.860> that<00:07:09.890> and<00:07:10.419> once

00:07:11.409 --> 00:07:11.419 
250 here so stay tuned for that and once

00:07:11.419 --> 00:07:12.820 
250 here so stay tuned for that and once
again<00:07:11.540> i<00:07:11.690> really<00:07:11.960> recommend<00:07:12.050> this<00:07:12.380> gyro<00:07:12.800> or

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:12.830 
again i really recommend this gyro or

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:14.860 
again i really recommend this gyro or
this<00:07:13.640> is<00:07:13.790> one<00:07:13.940> of<00:07:13.970> the<00:07:14.090> least<00:07:14.210> expensive<00:07:14.570> ones

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:14.870 
this is one of the least expensive ones

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:18.100 
this is one of the least expensive ones
is<00:07:14.990> a<00:07:15.220> G<00:07:16.220> 270<00:07:16.940> it's<00:07:17.060> for<00:07:17.210> 500<00:07:17.810> sighs

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:18.110 
is a G 270 it's for 500 sighs

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:20.080 
is a G 270 it's for 500 sighs
helicopters<00:07:18.800> and<00:07:18.919> lower<00:07:19.070> which<00:07:19.490> that's<00:07:19.910> where

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:20.090 
helicopters and lower which that's where

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:22.870 
helicopters and lower which that's where
most<00:07:20.210> people<00:07:20.570> fly<00:07:20.780> there's<00:07:21.560> also<00:07:21.740> like<00:07:22.130> a<00:07:22.160> 300

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:22.880 
most people fly there's also like a 300

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:24.760 
most people fly there's also like a 300
something<00:07:23.360> I<00:07:23.570> forget<00:07:24.200> the<00:07:24.290> other<00:07:24.410> numbers

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:24.770 
something I forget the other numbers

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:27.520 
something I forget the other numbers
like<00:07:24.919> a<00:07:24.950> 370<00:07:25.700> or<00:07:25.940> 390<00:07:26.690> but<00:07:27.200> there's<00:07:27.350> other

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:27.530 
like a 370 or 390 but there's other

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:29.409 
like a 370 or 390 but there's other
junior<00:07:28.250> gyros<00:07:28.610> that<00:07:28.760> are<00:07:28.850> meant<00:07:29.030> for<00:07:29.210> little

00:07:29.409 --> 00:07:29.419 
junior gyros that are meant for little

00:07:29.419 --> 00:07:31.180 
junior gyros that are meant for little
bigger<00:07:29.570> helicopters<00:07:30.230> and<00:07:30.350> gas<00:07:30.530> helicopters

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:31.190 
bigger helicopters and gas helicopters

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:34.870 
bigger helicopters and gas helicopters
to<00:07:31.430> this<00:07:32.390> g7<00:07:32.960> 270<00:07:33.620> is<00:07:33.890> a<00:07:33.950> little<00:07:34.280> bit<00:07:34.370> over<00:07:34.460> 100

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:34.880 
to this g7 270 is a little bit over 100

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:37.810 
to this g7 270 is a little bit over 100
I<00:07:34.940> think<00:07:35.090> it's<00:07:35.210> like<00:07:35.300> 110<00:07:35.750> bucks<00:07:36.820> definitely

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:37.820 
I think it's like 110 bucks definitely

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:39.040 
I think it's like 110 bucks definitely
find<00:07:38.030> it<00:07:38.180> worth<00:07:38.360> it<00:07:38.510> though<00:07:38.690> if<00:07:38.840> you're<00:07:38.930> going

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:39.050 
find it worth it though if you're going

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:41.260 
find it worth it though if you're going
to<00:07:39.110> be<00:07:39.260> doing<00:07:39.550> extreme<00:07:40.550> stunts<00:07:41.030> and

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:41.270 
to be doing extreme stunts and

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:43.330 
to be doing extreme stunts and
everything<00:07:41.540> especially<00:07:41.750> 3d<00:07:42.380> if<00:07:42.919> you<00:07:43.070> plan<00:07:43.310> to

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:43.340 
everything especially 3d if you plan to

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:45.969 
everything especially 3d if you plan to
just<00:07:43.880> do<00:07:44.270> sport<00:07:44.840> flying<00:07:45.140> you<00:07:45.620> might<00:07:45.800> get<00:07:45.950> away

00:07:45.969 --> 00:07:45.979 
just do sport flying you might get away

00:07:45.979 --> 00:07:50.140 
just do sport flying you might get away
just<00:07:46.850> fine<00:07:47.120> with<00:07:47.539> a<00:07:47.570> regular<00:07:48.110> Pizzo<00:07:48.860> gyro<00:07:49.160> but

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:50.150 
just fine with a regular Pizzo gyro but

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:51.530 
just fine with a regular Pizzo gyro but
if<00:07:50.390> you're<00:07:50.479> going<00:07:50.600> to<00:07:50.660> be<00:07:50.750> doing<00:07:50.840> 3d

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:51.540 
if you're going to be doing 3d

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:53.440 
if you're going to be doing 3d
any<00:07:51.690> type<00:07:51.930> of<00:07:51.960> extreme<00:07:52.500> fast<00:07:52.860> tricks

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:53.450 
any type of extreme fast tricks

00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:55.880 
any type of extreme fast tricks
definitely<00:07:54.450> would<00:07:54.570> recommend<00:07:54.750> the<00:07:55.230> mums<00:07:55.440> gyro

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:55.890 
definitely would recommend the mums gyro

00:07:55.890 --> 00:07:58.340
