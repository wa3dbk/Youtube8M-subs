00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
tips that I'm really helped me out when

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.900 
tips that I'm really helped me out when
I<00:00:39.480> play<00:00:39.719> so<00:00:39.950> these<00:00:40.950> tips<00:00:41.250> really<00:00:41.309> apply<00:00:41.700> for

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
I play so these tips really apply for

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.729 
I play so these tips really apply for
most<00:00:42.090> cod<00:00:42.510> games<00:00:42.780> but<00:00:43.110> black<00:00:43.320> ops<00:00:43.500> 2<00:00:43.590> in

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
most cod games but black ops 2 in

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.380 
most cod games but black ops 2 in
particular<00:00:43.980> so<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.789> first<00:00:45.000> thing<00:00:45.090> that<00:00:45.239> I

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
particular so the first thing that I

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.090 
particular so the first thing that I
think<00:00:45.480> is<00:00:45.690> pretty<00:00:45.719> important<00:00:46.289> is<00:00:46.469> actually

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
think is pretty important is actually

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.950 
think is pretty important is actually
choosing<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.520> right<00:00:47.610> sensitivity<00:00:48.300> now

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
choosing the right sensitivity now

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.479 
choosing the right sensitivity now
obviously<00:00:49.289> with<00:00:49.620> black<00:00:49.770> of<00:00:49.890> soap<00:00:50.070> guys<00:00:50.219> up<00:00:50.370> to

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
obviously with black of soap guys up to

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.549 
obviously with black of soap guys up to
14<00:00:50.879> now<00:00:51.059> i<00:00:51.120> believe<00:00:51.420> so<00:00:52.170> it's<00:00:52.320> a<00:00:52.350> little<00:00:52.469> bit

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
14 now i believe so it's a little bit

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.310 
14 now i believe so it's a little bit
more<00:00:52.770> sort<00:00:53.070> of<00:00:53.100> tricky<00:00:53.460> but<00:00:53.670> i<00:00:53.960> play<00:00:54.960> on<00:00:54.989> about

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
more sort of tricky but i play on about

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.200 
more sort of tricky but i play on about
an<00:00:55.440> eight<00:00:55.649> or<00:00:55.949> so<00:00:56.190> which<00:00:56.670> was<00:00:56.820> basically<00:00:57.000> the

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
an eight or so which was basically the

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.610 
an eight or so which was basically the
equivalent<00:00:57.300> of<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.750> sort<00:00:57.989> of<00:00:58.050> six<00:00:58.350> in<00:00:58.500> other

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
equivalent of a sort of six in other

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.740 
equivalent of a sort of six in other
Cod's<00:00:58.890> that's<00:00:59.850> a<00:00:59.940> sort<00:01:00.149> of<00:01:00.210> nice<00:01:00.480> because

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
Cod's that's a sort of nice because

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.569 
Cod's that's a sort of nice because
you're<00:01:01.440> not<00:01:01.559> too<00:01:01.739> fast<00:01:01.980> if<00:01:02.160> you<00:01:02.219> can't<00:01:02.430> control

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
you're not too fast if you can't control

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.490 
you're not too fast if you can't control
yourself<00:01:02.820> but<00:01:03.210> you<00:01:03.270> can<00:01:03.390> all<00:01:03.480> asleep<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:04.379> if

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
yourself but you can all asleep and if

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.440 
yourself but you can all asleep and if
you're<00:01:04.589> getting<00:01:04.650> shot<00:01:04.799> at<00:01:05.129> so<00:01:05.369> really<00:01:06.330> it's

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
you're getting shot at so really it's

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.480 
you're getting shot at so really it's
just<00:01:06.540> whatever<00:01:06.930> suits<00:01:07.560> you<00:01:07.799> if<00:01:08.010> someone

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
just whatever suits you if someone

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.130 
just whatever suits you if someone
recommends<00:01:08.939> 10<00:01:09.150> then<00:01:09.390> just<00:01:09.930> think<00:01:10.049> about

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
recommends 10 then just think about

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.899 
recommends 10 then just think about
whatever<00:01:10.350> suits<00:01:10.740> you<00:01:10.890> you<00:01:10.979> don't<00:01:11.280> only<00:01:11.520> go<00:01:11.880> off

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
whatever suits you you don't only go off

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.700 
whatever suits you you don't only go off
what<00:01:12.119> other<00:01:12.270> people<00:01:12.570> recommend<00:01:12.659> obviously<00:01:13.619> if

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
what other people recommend obviously if

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.109 
what other people recommend obviously if
you're<00:01:13.799> a<00:01:13.860> sniper<00:01:14.159> then<00:01:14.460> maybe<00:01:14.670> 10<00:01:14.880> would<00:01:15.000> be

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
you're a sniper then maybe 10 would be

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.510 
you're a sniper then maybe 10 would be
more<00:01:16.080> helpful<00:01:16.320> sorry<00:01:16.650> 14<00:01:17.070> might<00:01:17.280> be<00:01:17.400> more

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
I don't care but just move sort of

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.050 
I don't care but just move sort of
tactically<00:02:08.069> so<00:02:08.220> move<00:02:08.610> from<00:02:08.729> cover<00:02:08.940> to<00:02:09.000> cover

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
tactically so move from cover to cover

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.510 
tactically so move from cover to cover
which<00:02:09.509> obviously<00:02:09.660> will<00:02:09.989> make<00:02:10.020> your<00:02:10.520> their

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
which obviously will make your their

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.910 
which obviously will make your their
line<00:02:11.730> of<00:02:11.879> sight<00:02:11.910> a<00:02:12.450> lot<00:02:12.930> harder<00:02:13.140> for

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
line of sight a lot harder for

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.080 
line of sight a lot harder for

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
so they won't be able to kill you as

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.059 
so they won't be able to kill you as

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.520 
obviously very predictable people will
expect<00:02:47.640> that<00:02:47.959> but<00:02:48.959> yeah<00:02:49.140> just<00:02:49.350> try<00:02:49.470> and

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
expect that but yeah just try and

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.009 
expect that but yeah just try and
because<00:02:49.769> unpredictable<00:02:50.250> as<00:02:50.370> you<00:02:50.489> can<00:02:50.900> okay<00:02:51.900> my

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
because unpredictable as you can okay my

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:53.449 
because unpredictable as you can okay my
next<00:02:52.260> thing<00:02:52.410> and<00:02:52.620> this<00:02:52.769> isn't<00:02:53.280> really

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
next thing and this isn't really

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:54.800 
next thing and this isn't really
something<00:02:53.670> you<00:02:53.850> can<00:02:54.030> just<00:02:54.060> know<00:02:54.420> straight

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
something you can just know straight

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:55.789 
something you can just know straight
away<00:02:54.840> all<00:02:55.080> those<00:02:55.170> with<00:02:55.319> low<00:02:55.470> and<00:02:55.620> straight

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
away all those with low and straight

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:58.699 
away all those with low and straight
away<00:02:55.980> but<00:02:56.010> try<00:02:56.730> and<00:02:57.060> learn<00:02:57.330> the<00:02:57.540> maps<00:02:57.720> so<00:02:58.590> this

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
away but try and learn the maps so this

00:02:58.709 --> 00:02:59.750 
away but try and learn the maps so this
might<00:02:58.830> take<00:02:59.010> a<00:02:59.069> while<00:02:59.130> especially<00:02:59.370> because

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
might take a while especially because

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.910 
might take a while especially because
black<00:03:00.000> ops<00:03:00.180> 2<00:03:00.269> and<00:03:00.480> just<00:03:00.750> came<00:03:00.900> out<00:03:01.080> but<00:03:01.319> try

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
black ops 2 and just came out but try

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.440 
black ops 2 and just came out but try
and<00:03:02.040> learn<00:03:02.160> sort<00:03:02.400> of<00:03:02.459> need<00:03:02.640> spots<00:03:03.030> enemy

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
and learn sort of need spots enemy

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:04.970 
and learn sort of need spots enemy
spawns<00:03:03.810> and<00:03:04.260> all<00:03:04.590> that<00:03:04.709> sort<00:03:04.830> of<00:03:04.920> stuff

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
spawns and all that sort of stuff

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.530 
spawns and all that sort of stuff
because<00:03:05.220> it<00:03:05.430> really<00:03:05.700> really<00:03:05.970> helps<00:03:06.239> you<00:03:06.390> with

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
because it really really helps you with

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.360 
because it really really helps you with
you<00:03:07.170> know<00:03:07.319> knowing<00:03:07.620> where<00:03:07.769> the<00:03:07.860> enemy<00:03:08.069> will<00:03:08.250> be

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
you know knowing where the enemy will be

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:09.830 
you know knowing where the enemy will be
in<00:03:08.670> knowing<00:03:08.940> where<00:03:09.120> you<00:03:09.269> should<00:03:09.450> be<00:03:09.569> located

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
in knowing where you should be located

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.570 
in knowing where you should be located
on<00:03:10.140> the<00:03:10.200> map<00:03:10.350> because<00:03:10.830> it's<00:03:11.010> you<00:03:11.190> know<00:03:11.250> even<00:03:11.519> if

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
on the map because it's you know even if

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.550 
on the map because it's you know even if
you're<00:03:11.730> not<00:03:11.760> a<00:03:11.910> good<00:03:12.090> computer<00:03:12.360> arts<00:03:12.900> computer

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
you're not a good computer arts computer

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.930 
you're not a good computer arts computer
even<00:03:13.980> if<00:03:14.040> you're<00:03:14.130> not<00:03:14.190> a<00:03:14.340> good<00:03:14.519> shooter<00:03:14.850> you

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
even if you're not a good shooter you

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.550 
even if you're not a good shooter you
can<00:03:15.060> still<00:03:15.269> do<00:03:15.360> quite<00:03:15.569> well<00:03:15.600> it<00:03:16.049> just<00:03:16.080> if<00:03:16.470> you

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
can still do quite well it just if you

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.690 
can still do quite well it just if you
can<00:03:16.680> flank<00:03:16.950> the<00:03:17.100> enemy<00:03:17.130> and<00:03:17.400> stuff<00:03:17.519> like<00:03:17.640> that

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
can flank the enemy and stuff like that

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.670 
can flank the enemy and stuff like that
and<00:03:18.359> that<00:03:18.840> really<00:03:19.049> comes<00:03:19.260> into<00:03:19.440> sort<00:03:19.650> of

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
and that really comes into sort of

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.560 
and that really comes into sort of
positioning<00:03:20.160> being<00:03:20.640> up<00:03:20.760> to<00:03:20.910> position

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
positioning being up to position

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:22.729 
positioning being up to position
yourself<00:03:21.870> in<00:03:21.900> the<00:03:22.019> right<00:03:22.109> sort<00:03:22.350> of<00:03:22.380> area<00:03:22.590> of

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
yourself in the right sort of area of

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:24.979 
yourself in the right sort of area of
the<00:03:22.890> map<00:03:23.010> is<00:03:23.190> very<00:03:23.430> important<00:03:23.880> so<00:03:24.090> if<00:03:24.510> you<00:03:24.690> feel

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
the map is very important so if you feel

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:26.420 
the map is very important so if you feel
bad<00:03:25.200> a<00:03:25.260> shooting<00:03:25.709> it<00:03:25.799> doesn't<00:03:26.070> always<00:03:26.190> matter

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
bad a shooting it doesn't always matter

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:27.770 
bad a shooting it doesn't always matter
because<00:03:26.790> as<00:03:27.209> long<00:03:27.359> as<00:03:27.480> you're<00:03:27.600> well

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
because as long as you're well

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.509 
because as long as you're well
positioned<00:03:28.200> and<00:03:28.380> flank<00:03:28.739> behind<00:03:28.980> the<00:03:29.070> enemy<00:03:29.220> I

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
positioned and flank behind the enemy I

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:30.949 
positioned and flank behind the enemy I
you'll<00:03:29.910> generally<00:03:30.209> be<00:03:30.390> able<00:03:30.540> to<00:03:30.600> get<00:03:30.690> the<00:03:30.750> kill

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
you'll generally be able to get the kill

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:32.990 
you'll generally be able to get the kill
okay<00:03:31.769> guys<00:03:31.950> my<00:03:32.130> next<00:03:32.400> tip<00:03:32.489> is<00:03:32.549> to<00:03:32.760> actually

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
okay guys my next tip is to actually

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.699 
okay guys my next tip is to actually
just<00:03:33.239> go<00:03:33.450> around<00:03:33.570> the<00:03:33.780> edge<00:03:33.930> of<00:03:34.109> the<00:03:34.290> map<00:03:34.500> um

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
just go around the edge of the map um

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.220 
just go around the edge of the map um
this<00:03:35.670> applies<00:03:36.090> to<00:03:36.120> most<00:03:36.420> maps<00:03:36.720> a<00:03:36.870> lot<00:03:37.019> of<00:03:37.079> naps

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
this applies to most maps a lot of naps

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:38.660 
this applies to most maps a lot of naps
are<00:03:37.440> quite<00:03:37.709> big<00:03:37.920> and<00:03:38.130> I<00:03:38.220> wouldn't<00:03:38.459> recommend

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
are quite big and I wouldn't recommend

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.490 
are quite big and I wouldn't recommend
doing<00:03:38.850> this<00:03:39.060> but<00:03:39.299> a<00:03:39.510> lot<00:03:39.900> of<00:03:39.930> the<00:03:40.049> maps<00:03:40.230> it's

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
doing this but a lot of the maps it's

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:41.900 
doing this but a lot of the maps it's
just<00:03:40.650> really<00:03:40.799> good<00:03:41.010> to<00:03:41.070> go<00:03:41.250> around<00:03:41.400> there<00:03:41.700> the

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
just really good to go around there the

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.310 
just really good to go around there the
edge<00:03:42.090> of<00:03:42.269> the<00:03:42.359> maps<00:03:42.540> particularly<00:03:43.170> in<00:03:43.230> the

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
edge of the maps particularly in the

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.020 
edge of the maps particularly in the
early<00:03:43.350> days<00:03:43.739> because<00:03:44.130> obviously<00:03:44.730> there's

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
early days because obviously there's

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.789 
early days because obviously there's
less<00:03:45.269> chance<00:03:45.299> get<00:03:45.780> killed<00:03:46.019> from<00:03:46.230> other<00:03:46.530> angles

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
less chance get killed from other angles

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:49.099 
less chance get killed from other angles
but<00:03:47.489> not<00:03:47.820> only<00:03:48.060> this<00:03:48.209> but<00:03:48.269> it<00:03:48.630> means<00:03:48.780> you<00:03:48.959> can

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:49.109 
but not only this but it means you can

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:50.449 
but not only this but it means you can
sort<00:03:49.260> of<00:03:49.410> the<00:03:49.500> upper<00:03:49.739> edge<00:03:49.890> of<00:03:50.100> enemies

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
sort of the upper edge of enemies

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:51.830 
sort of the upper edge of enemies
because<00:03:50.790> sometimes<00:03:51.150> I'll<00:03:51.299> be<00:03:51.420> in<00:03:51.480> the<00:03:51.570> middle

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
because sometimes I'll be in the middle

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.360 
because sometimes I'll be in the middle
they<00:03:52.260> won't<00:03:52.440> have<00:03:52.530> any<00:03:52.680> idea<00:03:53.010> where<00:03:53.130> to<00:03:53.190> be<00:03:53.340> and

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
they won't have any idea where to be and

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:54.560 
they won't have any idea where to be and
if<00:03:53.609> you<00:03:53.700> are<00:03:53.760> sort<00:03:54.030> of<00:03:54.060> around<00:03:54.209> the<00:03:54.359> edge<00:03:54.450> of

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
if you are sort of around the edge of

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:56.330 
if you are sort of around the edge of
the<00:03:54.690> map<00:03:54.840> you<00:03:55.260> also<00:03:55.380> be<00:03:55.709> able<00:03:55.799> to<00:03:55.950> sort<00:03:56.250> of

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
the map you also be able to sort of

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:57.680 
the map you also be able to sort of
scout<00:03:56.579> what's<00:03:56.880> in<00:03:57.000> front<00:03:57.180> of<00:03:57.269> you<00:03:57.390> where<00:03:57.569> is

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
scout what's in front of you where is

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.539 
scout what's in front of you where is
you<00:03:58.049> I<00:03:58.140> need<00:03:58.290> to<00:03:58.319> worry<00:03:58.560> about<00:03:58.680> what<00:03:58.980> store<00:03:59.220> you

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
you I need to worry about what store you

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:00.920 
you I need to worry about what store you
know<00:03:59.730> what's<00:03:59.940> behind<00:04:00.090> you<00:04:00.420> and<00:04:00.510> what<00:04:00.660> sort<00:04:00.870> of

know what's behind you and what sort of
