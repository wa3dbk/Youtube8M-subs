this planet real fix is real fast calm
this<00:00:12.269> is<00:00:12.389> air-conditioning<00:00:13.110> season<00:00:13.500> and

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
this is air-conditioning season and

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.670 
this is air-conditioning season and
we're<00:00:13.950> working<00:00:14.280> on<00:00:14.400> a<00:00:14.429> home<00:00:14.670> line<00:00:14.880> Chevy<00:00:15.240> Tahoe

we're working on a home line Chevy Tahoe

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.080 
we're working on a home line Chevy Tahoe
the<00:00:16.680> driver<00:00:16.920> came<00:00:17.190> in<00:00:17.400> and<00:00:17.609> complained<00:00:18.000> that

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
the driver came in and complained that

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.570 
the driver came in and complained that
the<00:00:18.300> rear<00:00:18.510> air<00:00:18.720> was<00:00:19.020> not<00:00:19.230> willing<00:00:19.439> cold<00:00:19.830> he

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
the rear air was not willing cold he

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.010 
the rear air was not willing cold he
seemed<00:00:20.850> to<00:00:20.939> think<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.359> front<00:00:21.660> air<00:00:21.840> was

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
seemed to think the front air was

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.050 
seemed to think the front air was
blowing<00:00:22.050> okay<00:00:22.650> but<00:00:22.890> not<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.189> rear<00:00:23.369> we<00:00:23.880> hooked

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
blowing okay but not the rear we hooked

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.029 
blowing okay but not the rear we hooked
it<00:00:24.180> up<00:00:24.330> to<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.600> gauges<00:00:25.019> and<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.260> low<00:00:25.410> side<00:00:25.710> was

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
it up to the gauges and the low side was

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.179 
it up to the gauges and the low side was
reading<00:00:26.369> 50-plus<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:28.349> high<00:00:28.650> side<00:00:28.949> was

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
reading 50-plus and the high side was

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.749 
reading 50-plus and the high side was
reading<00:00:29.550> nearly<00:00:29.880> at<00:00:29.939> 300<00:00:30.420> psi<00:00:31.250> we<00:00:32.250> also<00:00:32.430> had

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
reading nearly at 300 psi we also had

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.880 
reading nearly at 300 psi we also had
some<00:00:32.790> noise<00:00:33.230> sound<00:00:34.230> like<00:00:34.380> it<00:00:34.530> might<00:00:34.680> be<00:00:34.860> the

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
some noise sound like it might be the

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.400 
some noise sound like it might be the
compressor<00:00:35.489> but<00:00:36.300> it<00:00:36.480> also<00:00:36.630> might<00:00:36.930> be<00:00:36.960> a<00:00:37.110> belt

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
compressor but it also might be a belt

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.040 
compressor but it also might be a belt
so<00:00:38.219> we<00:00:38.340> actually<00:00:38.520> replaced<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.360> belt<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:39.840> the

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
so we actually replaced the belt and the

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.080 
so we actually replaced the belt and the
Kitchener<00:00:40.620> that<00:00:40.860> we<00:00:41.010> wanted<00:00:41.309> eliminate<00:00:41.879> that

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
Kitchener that we wanted eliminate that

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.060 
Kitchener that we wanted eliminate that
as<00:00:42.239> any<00:00:42.510> source<00:00:42.840> of<00:00:43.050> noise<00:00:43.230> it<00:00:43.680> was<00:00:43.829> really

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
as any source of noise it was really

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.500 
as any source of noise it was really
that<00:00:44.219> unclear<00:00:44.730> as<00:00:44.820> to<00:00:44.850> whether<00:00:45.090> or<00:00:45.270> not<00:00:45.329> it

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
that unclear as to whether or not it

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.389 
that unclear as to whether or not it
could<00:00:45.629> have<00:00:45.750> been<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:45.989> noise<00:00:46.219> some<00:00:47.219> of<00:00:47.309> the

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
could have been the noise some of the

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.160 
could have been the noise some of the
new<00:00:47.520> belt<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.059> new<00:00:48.239> tensioner<00:00:48.750> we<00:00:48.870> used<00:00:49.020> a

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
new belt and the new tensioner we used a

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.389 
new belt and the new tensioner we used a
stethoscope<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.980> noise<00:00:50.250> clearly

00:00:51.389 --> 00:00:51.399 
stethoscope the noise clearly

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:54.029 
stethoscope the noise clearly
impressive<00:00:52.180> when<00:00:53.170> we<00:00:53.320> check<00:00:53.559> the<00:00:53.590> actual

00:00:54.029 --> 00:00:54.039 
impressive when we check the actual

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:55.260 
impressive when we check the actual
temperature<00:00:54.520> in<00:00:54.610> the<00:00:54.670> front

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:55.270 
temperature in the front

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.090 
temperature in the front
it<00:00:55.480> really<00:00:55.719> wasn't<00:00:55.989> cooling<00:00:56.440> anywhere<00:00:56.829> near

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 
it really wasn't cooling anywhere near

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.770 
it really wasn't cooling anywhere near
what<00:00:57.309> it<00:00:57.399> should<00:00:57.640> have<00:00:57.730> been<00:00:57.879> with<00:00:58.449> the<00:00:58.600> noise

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 
what it should have been with the noise

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.319 
what it should have been with the noise
coming<00:00:59.230> from<00:00:59.260> the<00:00:59.559> compressor<00:01:00.280> using<00:01:01.239> a

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:01.329 
coming from the compressor using a

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:03.210 
coming from the compressor using a
stethoscope<00:01:01.600> in<00:01:02.260> it

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:03.220 
stethoscope in it

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.300 
stethoscope in it
noise<00:01:03.910> inside<00:01:04.350> we<00:01:05.350> knew<00:01:05.500> we<00:01:05.650> had<00:01:05.680> to<00:01:05.830> replace

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310 
noise inside we knew we had to replace

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.250 
noise inside we knew we had to replace
the<00:01:06.520> compressor<00:01:06.790> rebuild<00:01:07.540> the<00:01:07.630> front<00:01:07.870> system

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:08.260 
the compressor rebuild the front system

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.650 
the compressor rebuild the front system
but<00:01:08.920> here's<00:01:09.100> the<00:01:09.220> point<00:01:09.400> of<00:01:09.550> this<00:01:09.700> video<00:01:10.030> when

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:10.660 
but here's the point of this video when

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.330 
but here's the point of this video when
you<00:01:10.720> have<00:01:10.840> a<00:01:10.870> vehicle<00:01:11.170> that<00:01:11.470> has<00:01:11.650> front<00:01:12.190> and

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
you have a vehicle that has front and

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.570 
you have a vehicle that has front and
rear<00:01:12.460> AC<00:01:12.870> don't<00:01:13.870> forget<00:01:14.200> about<00:01:14.230> the<00:01:14.560> rear<00:01:14.800> now

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:15.580 
rear AC don't forget about the rear now

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.640 
rear AC don't forget about the rear now
on<00:01:15.700> the<00:01:15.790> front<00:01:16.060> as<00:01:16.240> we<00:01:16.390> begin<00:01:16.720> disassembling

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:17.650 
on the front as we begin disassembling

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.570 
on the front as we begin disassembling
this<00:01:17.860> we've<00:01:18.550> got<00:01:18.700> to<00:01:18.730> do<00:01:19.000> orifice<00:01:19.480> tube<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:21.250> as

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:21.580 
this we've got to do orifice tube and as

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.240 
this we've got to do orifice tube and as
you<00:01:21.730> can<00:01:21.910> see<00:01:22.060> the<00:01:22.210> orifice<00:01:22.630> tube<00:01:23.040> it's<00:01:24.040> got

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
you can see the orifice tube it's got

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.120 
you can see the orifice tube it's got
all<00:01:24.430> kinds<00:01:24.460> of<00:01:24.910> debris<00:01:25.210> in<00:01:25.390> it<00:01:25.680> this<00:01:26.680> is<00:01:26.740> what<00:01:27.100> a

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
all kinds of debris in it this is what a

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.450 
all kinds of debris in it this is what a
good<00:01:27.370> orifice<00:01:27.820> tube<00:01:28.030> should<00:01:28.240> look<00:01:28.420> like<00:01:29.310> so<00:01:30.310> we

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
good orifice tube should look like so we

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.610 
good orifice tube should look like so we
knew<00:01:30.580> the<00:01:30.790> front<00:01:31.090> was<00:01:31.270> bad<00:01:31.510> but<00:01:32.140> again<00:01:32.410> with

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:32.620 
knew the front was bad but again with

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.110 
knew the front was bad but again with
the<00:01:32.770> rear<00:01:33.010> air<00:01:33.160> conditioning<00:01:33.190> we<00:01:33.850> need<00:01:34.000> to

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:34.120 
the rear air conditioning we need to

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.090 
the rear air conditioning we need to
check<00:01:34.300> that<00:01:34.540> as<00:01:34.660> well<00:01:34.900> because<00:01:35.470> one<00:01:35.800> thing<00:01:36.010> you

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
check that as well because one thing you

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.400 
check that as well because one thing you
don't<00:01:36.310> want<00:01:36.580> to<00:01:36.640> do<00:01:36.790> is<00:01:37.540> tell<00:01:37.810> the<00:01:37.930> people<00:01:38.080> that

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:38.410 
don't want to do is tell the people that

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.410 
don't want to do is tell the people that
you<00:01:38.530> knew<00:01:38.650> the<00:01:38.770> compressor<00:01:39.340> or<00:01:39.910> of<00:01:40.090> us<00:01:40.210> to

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
you knew the compressor or of us to

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.380 
you knew the compressor or of us to
receive<00:01:41.170> a<00:01:41.290> dryer<00:01:41.560> rebuild<00:01:42.280> the<00:01:42.369> front<00:01:42.640> send

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
receive a dryer rebuild the front send

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:44.760 
receive a dryer rebuild the front send
them<00:01:43.510> out<00:01:43.660> and<00:01:43.900> then<00:01:44.050> they<00:01:44.080> come<00:01:44.350> back<00:01:44.380> and<00:01:44.680> say

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
them out and then they come back and say

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.230 
them out and then they come back and say
yeah<00:01:45.010> but<00:01:45.190> the<00:01:45.340> rear<00:01:45.550> still<00:01:45.850> isn't<00:01:46.000> working

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
yeah but the rear still isn't working

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.450 
yeah but the rear still isn't working
now<00:01:46.750> in<00:01:46.900> this<00:01:47.020> situation<00:01:47.710> when<00:01:47.890> the<00:01:47.920> front<00:01:48.280> air

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460 
now in this situation when the front air

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.340 
now in this situation when the front air
conditioning<00:01:49.000> was<00:01:49.090> on<00:01:49.300> and<00:01:49.660> actually<00:01:49.869> cooling

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
conditioning was on and actually cooling

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.620 
conditioning was on and actually cooling
we<00:01:51.160> came<00:01:51.369> back<00:01:51.550> around<00:01:51.759> because<00:01:52.060> the<00:01:52.360> pipes

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
we came back around because the pipes

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.660 
we came back around because the pipes
come<00:01:52.930> from<00:01:53.170> the<00:01:53.259> front<00:01:53.500> to<00:01:53.619> the<00:01:53.650> back<00:01:53.740> and<00:01:54.400> I'm

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
come from the front to the back and I'm

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.100 
come from the front to the back and I'm
going<00:01:54.820> to<00:01:54.850> eat<00:01:54.970> the<00:01:55.090> back<00:01:55.300> here<00:01:55.600> you<00:01:55.780> can<00:01:55.900> reach

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
going to eat the back here you can reach

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.050 
going to eat the back here you can reach
up<00:01:56.350> there<00:01:56.530> anything<00:01:56.740> so<00:01:57.130> put<00:01:57.340> your<00:01:57.460> hands<00:01:57.910> on

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
up there anything so put your hands on

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.600 
up there anything so put your hands on
the<00:01:58.180> pipes<00:01:58.530> and<00:01:59.530> you<00:01:59.770> can<00:01:59.950> do<00:02:00.070> the<00:02:00.190> touch<00:02:00.400> and

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
the pipes and you can do the touch and

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.640 
the pipes and you can do the touch and
feel<00:02:00.790> method<00:02:01.270> that's<00:02:01.869> not<00:02:02.140> as<00:02:02.320> good<00:02:02.530> as

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:02.650 
feel method that's not as good as

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:04.410 
feel method that's not as good as
actually<00:02:03.040> knowing<00:02:03.250> the<00:02:03.460> temperatures<00:02:03.940> but

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
actually knowing the temperatures but

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:05.940 
actually knowing the temperatures but
you<00:02:04.540> should<00:02:04.720> be<00:02:04.869> able<00:02:04.930> to<00:02:05.050> touch<00:02:05.290> those<00:02:05.590> pipes

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
you should be able to touch those pipes

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.550 
you should be able to touch those pipes
and<00:02:06.580> actually<00:02:06.940> feel<00:02:07.150> that<00:02:07.360> they're<00:02:07.510> cold<00:02:07.840> that

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
and actually feel that they're cold that

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.880 
and actually feel that they're cold that
means<00:02:08.769> you've<00:02:09.040> got<00:02:09.070> some<00:02:09.489> interchange

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
means you've got some interchange

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.640 
means you've got some interchange
getting<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.370> hot<00:02:11.550> and<00:02:11.760> cold<00:02:11.790> exchange<00:02:12.650> but

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
getting the hot and cold exchange but

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.710 
getting the hot and cold exchange but
are<00:02:13.830> in<00:02:14.100> our<00:02:14.250> case<00:02:14.460> both<00:02:14.790> of<00:02:14.940> those<00:02:15.090> pipes<00:02:15.450> were

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
are in our case both of those pipes were

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.350 
are in our case both of those pipes were
hot<00:02:15.960> now<00:02:16.770> if<00:02:17.070> we<00:02:17.310> felt<00:02:17.610> down<00:02:17.850> there<00:02:18.120> in<00:02:18.210> those

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
hot now if we felt down there in those

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.390 
hot now if we felt down there in those
pipes<00:02:18.690> were<00:02:18.900> actually<00:02:19.260> cold<00:02:19.560> but<00:02:20.160> you<00:02:20.310> were

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
pipes were actually cold but you were

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.400 
pipes were actually cold but you were
not<00:02:20.580> even<00:02:20.910> in<00:02:21.030> the<00:02:21.150> air<00:02:21.420> blowing<00:02:21.780> back<00:02:22.140> here

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
not even in the air blowing back here

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.740 
not even in the air blowing back here
that<00:02:22.590> was<00:02:22.710> both<00:02:23.240> possibility<00:02:24.240> you<00:02:24.360> can<00:02:24.570> have<00:02:24.720> a

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
that was both possibility you can have a

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.830 
that was both possibility you can have a
belt<00:02:25.110> or<00:02:25.290> a<00:02:25.350> problem<00:02:26.060> but<00:02:27.060> in<00:02:27.180> this<00:02:27.270> case<00:02:27.540> we

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
belt or a problem but in this case we

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.710 
belt or a problem but in this case we
had<00:02:27.990> no<00:02:28.230> cooling<00:02:28.680> going<00:02:28.830> on<00:02:29.010> in<00:02:29.160> those<00:02:29.280> pipes

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
had no cooling going on in those pipes

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.150 
had no cooling going on in those pipes
if<00:02:30.720> you<00:02:30.900> have<00:02:31.080> this<00:02:31.260> much<00:02:31.470> debris<00:02:31.890> in<00:02:32.040> the

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
if you have this much debris in the

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.580 
if you have this much debris in the
front<00:02:32.460> you<00:02:33.180> probably<00:02:33.690> do<00:02:33.930> in<00:02:34.050> the<00:02:34.140> rear<00:02:34.350> as

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
front you probably do in the rear as

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.100 
front you probably do in the rear as
well<00:02:34.640> so<00:02:35.640> we've<00:02:35.820> gathered<00:02:36.270> our<00:02:36.420> evidence<00:02:36.930> from

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
well so we've gathered our evidence from

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.660 
well so we've gathered our evidence from
the<00:02:37.290> front<00:02:37.590> the<00:02:37.800> club<00:02:38.040> though<00:02:38.220> we<00:02:38.370> clearly

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
the front the club though we clearly

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.930 
the front the club though we clearly
need<00:02:38.940> them<00:02:39.180> the<00:02:39.660> front

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.910 

down<00:02:43.510> the<00:02:43.720> rear<00:02:43.930> of<00:02:44.080> this<00:02:44.200> air-conditioning

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
down the rear of this air-conditioning

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.650 
down the rear of this air-conditioning
instead<00:02:45.280> of<00:02:45.370> an<00:02:45.460> orifice<00:02:45.700> tune<00:02:46.030> it<00:02:46.300> has<00:02:46.480> an

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
instead of an orifice tune it has an

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.580 
instead of an orifice tune it has an
expansion<00:02:47.110> valve<00:02:48.870> it<00:02:49.870> operates<00:02:50.350> differently

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
expansion valve it operates differently

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.710 
expansion valve it operates differently
it<00:02:51.130> still<00:02:51.400> is<00:02:51.520> the<00:02:51.550> control<00:02:52.030> device<00:02:52.360> for<00:02:52.630> the

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
it still is the control device for the

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.230 
it still is the control device for the
heat<00:02:52.840> cold<00:02:53.110> exchange<00:02:53.650> as<00:02:54.640> you<00:02:54.760> can<00:02:54.940> see<00:02:55.090> over

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.240 
heat cold exchange as you can see over

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.600 
heat cold exchange as you can see over
here<00:02:55.390> this<00:02:55.690> expansion<00:02:56.320> valve<00:02:56.590> is<00:02:56.950> very<00:02:57.220> pretty

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
here this expansion valve is very pretty

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.240 
here this expansion valve is very pretty
deep<00:02:58.170> so<00:02:59.170> you<00:02:59.230> actually<00:02:59.440> need<00:02:59.800> to<00:02:59.860> come<00:03:00.100> back

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
deep so you actually need to come back

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.920 
deep so you actually need to come back
here<00:03:00.310> and<00:03:00.640> pull<00:03:00.850> this<00:03:01.030> out<00:03:01.270> as<00:03:01.420> well

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
here and pull this out as well

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.020 
here and pull this out as well
you<00:03:02.380> can<00:03:02.530> see<00:03:02.680> it<00:03:02.800> just<00:03:02.830> threads<00:03:03.400> on<00:03:03.670> to<00:03:03.880> the

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
you can see it just threads on to the

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.330 
you can see it just threads on to the
two<00:03:04.210> pipes<00:03:04.860> but<00:03:05.860> then<00:03:06.010> when<00:03:06.190> you<00:03:06.310> look<00:03:06.490> inside

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
two pipes but then when you look inside

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.390 
two pipes but then when you look inside
as<00:03:09.340> you<00:03:09.610> can<00:03:09.790> see<00:03:10.000> in<00:03:10.150> the<00:03:10.270> big<00:03:10.450> port<00:03:10.780> in<00:03:10.960> the

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
as you can see in the big port in the

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.340 
as you can see in the big port in the
expansion<00:03:12.400> valve<00:03:12.480> it's<00:03:13.480> just<00:03:13.780> like<00:03:13.930> we've<00:03:14.170> got

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
expansion valve it's just like we've got

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.070 
expansion valve it's just like we've got
a<00:03:14.380> clean<00:03:14.710> and<00:03:14.950> a<00:03:15.040> dirty<00:03:15.250> orifice<00:03:16.030> tube<00:03:16.270> when

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
a clean and a dirty orifice tube when

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.210 
a clean and a dirty orifice tube when
you<00:03:17.170> go<00:03:17.290> to<00:03:17.350> the<00:03:17.560> other<00:03:17.710> side<00:03:18.010> of<00:03:18.160> the

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
you go to the other side of the

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.220 
you go to the other side of the
expansion<00:03:18.760> valve<00:03:19.000> you<00:03:19.540> can<00:03:19.570> see<00:03:19.930> the<00:03:20.080> debris

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
expansion valve you can see the debris

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.580 
expansion valve you can see the debris
inside<00:03:20.650> there<00:03:21.690> so<00:03:22.690> the<00:03:22.840> debris<00:03:23.110> that<00:03:23.350> did

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
inside there so the debris that did

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.800 
inside there so the debris that did
actually<00:03:23.860> sneak<00:03:24.370> past<00:03:24.640> this<00:03:25.000> travel<00:03:25.540> to<00:03:25.690> the

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
actually sneak past this travel to the

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.170 
actually sneak past this travel to the
rear<00:03:26.020> and<00:03:26.320> plugged<00:03:26.950> up<00:03:27.160> the<00:03:27.340> rear<00:03:27.550> expansion

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
rear and plugged up the rear expansion

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.100 
rear and plugged up the rear expansion
valve<00:03:28.420> as<00:03:28.660> well<00:03:30.360> so<00:03:31.360> you<00:03:31.420> see<00:03:31.660> they<00:03:31.810> ought<00:03:31.960> to

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
valve as well so you see they ought to

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.500 
valve as well so you see they ought to
look<00:03:32.230> more<00:03:32.500> like<00:03:32.560> this<00:03:33.070> if<00:03:33.310> there<00:03:33.910> was<00:03:34.060> not<00:03:34.240> any

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
look more like this if there was not any

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.690 
look more like this if there was not any
restriction<00:03:35.170> but<00:03:35.830> if<00:03:35.950> there's<00:03:36.190> a<00:03:36.250> restriction

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
restriction but if there's a restriction

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.330
