00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:37.770

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:40.290
 youtube watch my videos many 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.600
 ask where you can take lessons 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.860
 you can actually take the same on 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.770
 youtube and there is a playlist 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.530

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:53.100
 hours of lessons and but actually see 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.320

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.259
 whether there will be lessons on dub step 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:01.590
 Well, actually there is no dancing 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:06.230
 improvisation under dubstep music i think 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:08.870
 that you can all come in quietly 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:11.180
 then on youtube and someday I'll post 

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:14.060
 such lessons because for now but i 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.070
 developing in this style and not yet 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.490
 I want to release them I think sometime 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.970

 my new clip on the skrillex track by the way 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.080
 some kind of fight now tell you the track 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.850
 very cool 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:37.220

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:27.380
 the fact that I spoke at dubstep dubstep 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.100
 planet and actually taught 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:32.150
