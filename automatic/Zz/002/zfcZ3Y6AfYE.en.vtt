 ball bearings from their quadric see 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.900
 quadric good disassembled forward 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.800
 I disassemble I think everyone can 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:31.260
 you do not need to unscrew the bolts and all 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:33.750
 take off like this through this fist hour 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.360
 dumbass something so she called here 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:42.540
 will be generally shara shara here here 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:43.309
 such here such here it is 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.920
 below 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:52.680
 pressed in and fixed on top 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.390
 so as not to fall fixed locking 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.190
 the ring is not so understood put on 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.739
 ATV if they want to once 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.930
 stagger so as not to fall it was possible there 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.140
 drive and the like new such 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.580
 ball I could not find 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.700
 Here in the original new and not at all 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.130
 I managed to find so I will 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.650
 stop as i will recover 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.530
 I will shoot the video on show 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:20.310
 spun in this will get parts 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.740
 wipe dry all washed then on 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.140
 white then grease when tyagunova general 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.330
 tell you how it is inside there 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.670
 Ball floor is probably good with 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:33.270
 adjusting bolt that is all 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:36.000
 great and someone not once view 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.799
 did it already caught here wrong 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.250
 I need to knock them out 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:47.119
 take out here is it worth it just fell 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:49.950
 down spacer and top too 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:52.560
 prostavochka beat on the ball and knocked her 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.960
 you sent but someone really did 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.799
 wrong just x power see here 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:02.250
 at least here we have such 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:04.259
 thai gaper look for athlon well 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.020
 that's okay when the ball with the 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:09.330
 by the way side in the same way it can and 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.380
 from can operating conditions 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.330
 quad bike 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.090
 nothing happened when 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.760
 put the ball or dota before 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:22.090
 put them better so as not to overheat 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:25.320
 take here well squeeze and 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:29.320
 on the reverse side a couple of welding points 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:32.140
 put here the principle still want 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:36.340
 say about the steering tip and cool 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:42.780
 the tips here are such here apparently 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:46.630
 not here shattered already killed but but cost 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:49.480
 managed to find the owner of the former not immediately 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:53.050
 same tip here you can 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:56.470
 apply car geely from chinese 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:03:00.490
 car they are clipped just they 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:02.710
 thread is cut thread here right and 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:04.630
 left here right either here I have 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:06.640
 the tip is already trimmed undercut 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.090
 access to thread here right 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.440
 thread 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:13.150
 diameter 10 shah 125 and here the left thread 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:16.630
 that is, inside the left thread here is a pair 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:21.090
 cutout so we can adjust them our 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:24.700
 wheel alignment with Rocheva here 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.980
 so the die needs a diameter of 10 step 1 to 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.710
 sleep left and right to chop 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.680
 thread on tips stop them 

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:36.610
 I will not know that there are jelly fit and 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:38.380
 I will take geely to buy by sight 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.970
 good buy and just chop 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.750
 thread how it will develop steering 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.900
 tips 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:48.640
 but so while everything else then take off later 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:53.740
 video by the way the top also take off the support 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:56.940
 here here here here's the bob are you wearing arm 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:58.530
 Doctors here are the maximum of their soul 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.840
 will repair 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.530
 I will sort out these balls upper ball 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.650
 so all bye 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:08.760
 we see the beginning began to engage I 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.760
 our quadric
