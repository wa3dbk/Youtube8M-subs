resistance<00:06:03.410> burning<00:06:03.560> skies<00:06:04.390> that<00:06:05.390> was<00:06:05.570> it

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:05.840 
resistance burning skies that was it

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:07.930 
resistance burning skies that was it
that<00:06:06.290> was<00:06:06.320> literally<00:06:07.250> out<00:06:07.400> of<00:06:07.490> all<00:06:07.700> the<00:06:07.790> games

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:07.940 
that was literally out of all the games

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:09.370 
that was literally out of all the games
i<00:06:08.090> played<00:06:08.270> this<00:06:08.420> was<00:06:08.630> the<00:06:08.750> second<00:06:09.200> easiest

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:09.380 
i played this was the second easiest

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:12.010 
i played this was the second easiest
trophy<00:06:10.010> set<00:06:10.250> besides<00:06:10.910> terminated<00:06:11.510> salvation

trophy set besides terminated salvation

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:13.000 
trophy set besides terminated salvation
and<00:06:12.170> the<00:06:12.230> other<00:06:12.440> reason<00:06:12.680> I<00:06:12.710> didn't<00:06:12.890> get<00:06:12.950> that

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:13.010 
and the other reason I didn't get that

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:14.980 
and the other reason I didn't get that
get<00:06:13.640> of<00:06:13.790> that<00:06:13.910> fast<00:06:14.120> was<00:06:14.390> because<00:06:14.570> I<00:06:14.660> played<00:06:14.960> a

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:14.990 
get of that fast was because I played a

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:17.200 
get of that fast was because I played a
couple<00:06:15.290> of<00:06:15.500> levels<00:06:15.620> stopped<00:06:16.460> and<00:06:16.760> then<00:06:17.030> went
