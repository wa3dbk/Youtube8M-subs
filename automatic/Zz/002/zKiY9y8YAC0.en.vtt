00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:07.189
 the butterfly arms proceed mary 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.020
 things are done exactly the same 

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:11.929
 drawing is the same as that of akrÃ³n but 

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:13.940
 he makes both simultaneously 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:15.920
 symmetrical if in the crawl 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.210
 we need with is depth and to 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.980
 that we helped ourselves from the roller 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.020
 shoulder to shoulder we got it right for 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.989
 that the other will not help too 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.809
 the arm before the recovery here as no 

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:28.279
 we can throw the shoulders down 

00:00:25.809 --> 00:00:30.050
 well, we actually keep more or less 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:31.669
 the shadow at the same height being more 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.750
 or less here 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:37.510
 what is needed is 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.030
 draw as an active lock the 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.699
 drawing 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.660
 and always with your hands looking towards 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:46.329
 behind 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.660
 if I'm out of the pool and I 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:48.660
 I want 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.940
 Y 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.870
 and I stay in a spoon inside the 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:03.660
 office what I would do would be to take a 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.940
 strong bar in here would not be nor very 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.860
 open neither crossed nor very 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.610
 closed but more or less here and since 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.310
 here 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.590
 push me in the pool what happens 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.030
 is that instead of say to the mayor 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.580
 superficial I have to pass a grip 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.620
 deep because that's where I grab 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.140
 would be equivalence first the first 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:24.329
 phase 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:27.299
 and from here it's like when I do the 

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:32.000
 horseshoe when I make the lock 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.000
 old aunt as much strong for 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.350
 enter the water in this sequence 

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:40.710
 we can appreciate the butterfly nothing in 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.600
 nothing frontal and it looks like the first 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.820
 phase when it enters the arms open 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.039
 a little out trying to do 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.659
 the grip phase maybe the elbow will carry 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:50.819
 a tad lower it could take a 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.920
 little taller and then the arms 

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:55.740
 drawing that old lock of the 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.600
 that we speak and in a way that in the end is 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.179
 the push phase the end of the 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.520
 thumbs we got to contact the 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:05.489
 thighs or a phase of traction 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:09.369
 complete at the end in this angle from 

00:02:05.489 --> 00:02:13.090
 this angle is eliminated from below 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:14.769
 and we see how that is clearly drawn 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:18.310
 old lock here we see it to camera 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:20.440
 slow and that's the drawing since it comes 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:25.239
 to the arms you start to grab that 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:27.849
 open arms come together and come up 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:29.550
 the end here I see feline symmetrical 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:33.420
 the stroke 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:36.540
 and the recovery of arms the recovery was 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.950
 as if we had a rope appointment 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.500
 pull up 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.450
 we help getting the man out in butterfly 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.340
 as we can not remove the two shoulders 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.140
 same time a lot backwards do not 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.600
 we talk arms and arm recovery 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:52.490
 It is done with the arms stretched and flush 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.490
 of the siesta the surface of the water 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.330
 trying to say let them be isolated and 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.820
 Near the water there are people who 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:02.070
 flexibility can double a little more 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.840
 graphs perhaps but not recommended 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.460
 these people there are people who instead of 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.920
 breathe forward of butterfly it 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:09.510
 can breathe every stroke every stroke 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.400
 may be a long time without breathing 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.750
 It depends on the test, not as in a breaststroke 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.700
 for example they always take off their heads 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.650
 air breathing always takes something 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.100
 can make the physical hiccup like you 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.070
 want 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.720
 when you throw the square around here there are people who 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:25.570
 breathe on the side these people to 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:29.560
 better cross-arms to the stretched arm as 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:31.870
 what we see now how to proceed 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.540
 arms of the water we look at this 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:37.270
 frontal sequence from outside the water and 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.610
 it looks like the arms come out stretched and 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:41.810
 flush with the water and I might double a bit 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:44.270
 the doll is also not necessary 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:47.060
 but here in this other sequence what 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:48.980
 we observe from a little diagonal like 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:53.010
 the arms do not bend the arms 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:55.260
 stretched parallel to the lines 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:58.349
 and here you can also see the sequence 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:00.569
 of swimming the butterfly in which you see 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:04.260
 how am I doing a breathing in 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:06.810
 every stroke in a post and co2 and there's only 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:09.379
 a kick that splashes on which makes 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.379
 to take off his head 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:18.600
 here we see it completely from the side 

00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:21.419
 parallel and it looks like he pulled his head out 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.370
 arm stroke to arm stroke not and 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:25.380
 arms come out near the surface of the 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.860
 water so that the thumbs are 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:30.979
 looking towards the water 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:33.840
 and the hands as if they wanted to touch with 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:38.120
 the fingertips the garages 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.120
 and from there 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.800
 to live I put it
