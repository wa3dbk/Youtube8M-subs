extract<00:03:23.030> you<00:03:24.030> figured<00:03:24.300> would<00:03:24.390> contain<00:03:24.630> the

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
extract you figured would contain the

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.290 
extract you figured would contain the
oil<00:03:24.840> to<00:03:25.170> match<00:03:25.320> almost<00:03:25.620> but<00:03:26.340> smell<00:03:27.030> on<00:03:27.150> this

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
oil to match almost but smell on this

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:28.699 
oil to match almost but smell on this
one<00:03:27.450> was<00:03:27.570> hardly<00:03:27.840> anything<00:03:28.140> because<00:03:28.530> I<00:03:28.590> guess

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
one was hardly anything because I guess

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.520 
one was hardly anything because I guess
also<00:03:29.100> smell<00:03:29.370> like<00:03:29.459> very<00:03:29.670> much<00:03:29.880> do<00:03:30.090> they<00:03:30.239> um<00:03:30.720> I

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
also smell like very much do they um I

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.590 
also smell like very much do they um I
felt<00:03:32.250> my<00:03:32.430> face<00:03:32.459> might<00:03:33.060> have<00:03:33.180> been<00:03:33.300> a<00:03:33.330> little

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
felt my face might have been a little

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.720 
felt my face might have been a little
bit<00:03:33.840> softer<00:03:34.320> with<00:03:34.470> this<00:03:34.620> one<00:03:34.860> but<00:03:35.160> in<00:03:35.519> my

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
bit softer with this one but in my

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.850 
bit softer with this one but in my
experience<00:03:36.180> just<00:03:36.480> putting<00:03:36.780> extra<00:03:37.650> virgin

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
experience just putting extra virgin

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.290 
experience just putting extra virgin
olive<00:03:38.100> oil<00:03:38.370> on<00:03:38.550> your<00:03:38.610> skin<00:03:38.850> actually<00:03:39.090> does

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
olive oil on your skin actually does

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:40.790 
olive oil on your skin actually does
soften<00:03:39.930> up<00:03:40.200> your<00:03:40.230> skin

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
so yeah you really need a mask for it

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:44.420 
so yeah you really need a mask for it
not<00:03:43.380> necessarily<00:03:43.920> but<00:03:44.040> it<00:03:44.130> was<00:03:44.220> nice<00:03:44.400> and

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430
