00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:12.330
 today with our mother we prepare meatballs 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:12.330
 of salmon 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:26.149
 let's see the ingredients the ingredients 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:29.689
 already cooked potatoes will be boiled 

00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:32.399
 master flour was a chive 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:35.579
 salt and lycian texts for what they are 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:38.280
 thanks molin a new fine for 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.750
 first we must peel the potatoes 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.750
 and crush them 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.120
 when you do this 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:49.050
 kids make sure the potatoes don't 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.050
 they are too hot 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:55.890
 very good balaclava if we put then 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:59.220
 inside then baby and look at me 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.080
 cooked this steam salmon 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.990
 now it's already cold and you have to help me 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:06.690
 to remove all the bones and admit 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:09.420
 fish meat with potatoes 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.550
 the thorns of the salmon are large and yes 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.950
 they easily identify us instead 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.720
 we will prepare our meatballs without 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:20.040
 thorns and children will eat them 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:22.110
 quietly ok we ended up with the 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.360
 salmon now add the egg 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.080
 beaten and parsley and a bit of grass 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.080
 Chive 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.350
 let's go mix 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.650
 let's take a bit of a fun shape at 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.360
 these with slices of fish that form 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:47.970
 you would like to give sleep 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:51.690
 great idea go the humans otherwise or 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:55.430
 some do not cook or said 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.430
 she is a very good teacher 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.440
 we prepare all our fish and 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.510
 then we will pass girls in the end 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.210
 roasted cornmeal so this is a 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:07.310
 perfect dish for all the children who 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.960
 they are ciliates for those intolerant to 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.960
 milk or even yeast 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.610
 we also put a little eye 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:25.219
 these little fish will go into the oven at 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:27.379
 180 degrees for about 15 minutes 

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:28.909
 if we can maybe toss and turn there so 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:31.329
 they will take the color from one side 

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:31.329
 than on the other 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.209
 here are little girls our little fish vi 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.270
 like 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:40.770
 so now we're going to eat them ok 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:45.620
 but we greet our children 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.620
