this is video 4 in our practicum for

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.290 
this is video 4 in our practicum for
piano<00:00:09.540> and<00:00:10.190> we're<00:00:11.190> going<00:00:11.429> to<00:00:11.610> learn<00:00:12.000> the

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
piano and we're going to learn the

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.690 
piano and we're going to learn the
tritone<00:00:12.780> motion<00:00:13.620> chromatically<00:00:14.250> with<00:00:14.610> the

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
tritone motion chromatically with the

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.730 
tritone motion chromatically with the
circle<00:00:15.089> of<00:00:15.179> fifths<00:00:15.480> and<00:00:15.780> with<00:00:16.410> the<00:00:16.500> tritone

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
circle of fifths and with the tritone

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.859 
circle of fifths and with the tritone
we're<00:00:17.190> only<00:00:17.310> going<00:00:17.460> to<00:00:17.550> use<00:00:17.760> these<00:00:18.570> two

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
we're only going to use these two

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.679 
we're only going to use these two
fingers<00:00:19.289> for<00:00:19.740> our<00:00:19.890> tritone<00:00:20.400> let's<00:00:21.119> go<00:00:21.359> into

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
fingers for our tritone let's go into

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.570 
fingers for our tritone let's go into
the<00:00:21.810> ensemble<00:00:22.500> room<00:00:22.619> and<00:00:22.830> see<00:00:23.189> how<00:00:23.310> we<00:00:23.369> play

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
the ensemble room and see how we play

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:24.410 
the ensemble room and see how we play
this<00:00:23.789> example

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
this example

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.859 
this example
alright<00:00:25.199> game<00:00:25.439> we're<00:00:25.949> going<00:00:26.279> to<00:00:26.400> play

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:26.869 
alright game we're going to play

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:30.740 
alright game we're going to play
tritones<00:00:28.130> chromatically<00:00:29.130> descending<00:00:29.880> and

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
tritones chromatically descending and

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.720 
tritones chromatically descending and
that<00:00:31.170> means<00:00:31.349> but<00:00:31.560> basically<00:00:32.130> we're<00:00:32.309> moving<00:00:32.399> by

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
that means but basically we're moving by

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.370 
that means but basically we're moving by
half<00:00:33.000> steps<00:00:33.180> so<00:00:33.510> let's<00:00:33.719> take<00:00:33.870> a<00:00:33.899> look<00:00:34.110> at<00:00:34.230> that

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
half steps so let's take a look at that

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.860 
half steps so let's take a look at that
on<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.800> keyboard<00:00:35.250> and<00:00:35.850> we're<00:00:36.030> gonna<00:00:36.120> find<00:00:36.540> our

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
on the keyboard and we're gonna find our

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.470 
on the keyboard and we're gonna find our
first<00:00:37.440> tritone<00:00:38.040> which<00:00:38.340> is<00:00:38.489> going<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:38.700> be<00:00:38.879> e<00:00:39.090> and

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
first tritone which is going to be e and

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.889 
first tritone which is going to be e and
b-flat<00:00:40.070> and<00:00:41.070> we're<00:00:41.969> just<00:00:42.120> going<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.420> move<00:00:42.629> by

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
b-flat and we're just going to move by

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.840 
b-flat and we're just going to move by
half<00:00:43.170> step<00:00:43.530> it's<00:00:43.829> a<00:00:43.980> little<00:00:44.250> tricky<00:00:44.700> at<00:00:44.820> first

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
half step it's a little tricky at first

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.810 
half step it's a little tricky at first
to<00:00:45.300> be<00:00:45.450> careful<00:00:45.899> nice<00:00:46.110> and<00:00:46.379> slow<00:00:46.710> and<00:00:47.670> we're

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
to be careful nice and slow and we're

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.029 
to be careful nice and slow and we're
just<00:00:47.940> going<00:00:48.180> to<00:00:48.239> move<00:00:48.420> by<00:00:48.690> half<00:00:48.930> step<00:00:49.260> and

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
just going to move by half step and

00:00:50.039 --> 00:01:07.429 
just going to move by half step and
until<00:00:50.550> we<00:00:50.700> get<00:00:50.850> to<00:00:51.120> E<00:00:51.149> and<00:00:51.600> B<00:00:51.750> flat<00:00:51.960> again<00:01:06.439> there

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
until we get to E and B flat again there

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:07.730 
until we get to E and B flat again there
we<00:01:07.560> are

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
we are

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.370 
we are
b-flat<00:01:08.490> again<00:01:08.939> there's<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.840> method<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.290> my

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
b-flat again there's a method to my

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.700 
b-flat again there's a method to my
madness<00:01:10.530> here<00:01:11.250> trust<00:01:11.580> me<00:01:13.010> once<00:01:14.010> again

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
madness here trust me once again

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:24.679 
madness here trust me once again
practicing<00:01:22.490> this<00:01:23.490> is<00:01:23.700> an<00:01:23.820> important<00:01:24.390> piece<00:01:24.659> of

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
practicing this is an important piece of

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.289 
practicing this is an important piece of
the<00:01:24.990> exercise<00:01:25.710> from<00:01:26.040> when<00:01:26.250> you<00:01:26.369> open<00:01:26.820> up<00:01:26.909> video

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
the exercise from when you open up video

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.340 
the exercise from when you open up video
5<00:01:28.220> and<00:01:29.220> we<00:01:29.310> get<00:01:29.460> two<00:01:29.579> dominant<00:01:30.119> sevens<00:01:30.540> so

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
5 and we get two dominant sevens so

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.480 
5 and we get two dominant sevens so
there's<00:01:31.560> our<00:01:31.740> chromatics

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
there's our chromatics

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.990 
there's our chromatics
with<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.750> tritone<00:01:34.110> now<00:01:35.070> remember<00:01:35.850> that

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
with the tritone now remember that

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.090 
with the tritone now remember that
circle<00:01:36.390> of<00:01:36.450> fifths<00:01:36.720> that<00:01:37.049> we've<00:01:37.200> been<00:01:37.380> adding

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
circle of fifths that we've been adding

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.920 
circle of fifths that we've been adding
to<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.400> major<00:01:38.610> seventh<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.720> minor

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
to the major seventh and the minor

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.840 
to the major seventh and the minor
sevenths<00:01:40.409> let's<00:01:40.860> add<00:01:41.189> this<00:01:41.460> with<00:01:41.700> this

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
sevenths let's add this with this

00:01:41.850 --> 00:02:01.440 
sevenths let's add this with this
chromatic<00:01:42.150> motion

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.930 

sounds<00:02:02.450> pretty<00:02:02.690> cool<00:02:02.900> doesn't<00:02:03.259> it<00:02:03.759> let's<00:02:04.759> take

sounds pretty cool doesn't it let's take

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:25.619 
sounds pretty cool doesn't it let's take
a<00:02:04.970> look<00:02:05.180> at<00:02:05.270> that<00:02:05.360> on<00:02:05.570> the<00:02:05.659> board

here<00:02:26.629> are<00:02:26.870> our<00:02:26.900> tritones<00:02:27.560> moving

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
here are our tritones moving

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.640 
here are our tritones moving
chromatically<00:02:28.579> and<00:02:29.000> let's<00:02:29.930> add<00:02:30.170> this<00:02:30.379> with

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
chromatically and let's add this with

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:54.830 
chromatically and let's add this with
the<00:02:30.890> circle<00:02:31.549> of<00:02:31.670> fifths<00:02:31.909> counterclockwise
