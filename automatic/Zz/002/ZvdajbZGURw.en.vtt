00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.589
 2 

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:11.579
 what have been waiting for so long 

00:00:11.579 --> 00:00:13.259
 many officially happened 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:14.469
 introduced the phone 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:16.109
 on the book platform 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.369
 the model got the first 9 first on 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:20.619
 demand as a completely new machine and 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:22.480
 but in almost everything as far as it is 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.489
 maybe here is brand new 

00:00:24.489 --> 00:00:26.550
 operating system what does not look like 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.160
 user interface and 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.640
 original design 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:30.910
 corps as the creators say 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.230
 Made from the base of a solid piece 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:34.410
 polycarbonate 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.920
 besides spectacular elements 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.829
 the presentation of the phone this solution gives 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.580
 invisible technical 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:40.430
 advantages 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:41.670
 first polycarbonate 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.430
 Radek materials are transparent that is 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.250
 problems with the quality of communication should not be 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.109
 at least biza design apparatus 

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:50.069
 while the phone is cleaned durable 

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:51.400
 there is no roof here 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.620
 which could weaken 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.760
 constructions a small exception 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.190
 plugs plug micro devices mickey sim card 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.500
 the second is what is called coloring in 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.720
 the workshop that is the light of the phone and their 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.350
 there will be three black purple cyan it 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.600
 don't paint over it is actually a shade 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.400
 body material itself with 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.190
 In practical terms, this means 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.630
 less noticeable scratches appearance 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.950
 which is almost inevitable another 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.570
 The original solution is a display of 9 a little 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.450
 inconvenient for specifying the wave set 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.410
 protective glass on one side is 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:24.229
 some storerooms real dimensions 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:25.369
 apparatus besides 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:26.770
 in theory should do more 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.540
 natural tactile sensations 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.869
 and the movement of a large park across the story 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.889
 and the future owner will be the most 

00:01:32.889 --> 00:01:34.790

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.120
 five years another new novelty 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.900
 user interface 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.399
 built on three desktops 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:41.989
 home screen is the law for all 

00:01:41.989 --> 00:01:43.919

00:01:43.919 --> 00:01:45.080
 open applications 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.430
 and a tape of events when all messages fall 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.240
 special social networks 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.590
 chat rooms and so on but the main thing is to 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.630
 minimize any open program and 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.630
 back to the main screen is enough 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:56.980
 just throw off the EU

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:59.820
 while all running 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.210
 applications, their number 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.850
 limited 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.130
 phrase what is performance 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:04.850
 the device are displayed as 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.119
 essentially widgets on one of the workers 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:09.600
 tables switch between which again 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.690

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:25.919
 all this allowed to get rid of

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:36.069
 understand a lot of things concerning

 modern operating system 

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:43.629
 we did a lot of new and continue 

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:45.929
 build up what our knowledge is what it is 

00:02:45.929 --> 00:02:47.729

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:05.029

 again free 

00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:32.599
 that is, create applications with any

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:56.480
 I mean the operating system

 linux z we are very proud of it here 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:01.879
 many dozen of the world 900 models 

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:03.739

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:06.029
 but here is Kiev, which is also open 

00:04:06.029 --> 00:04:08.010
 and this all can use who 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.430
 anything you will never see the same 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.199
 user interface hidden

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.980
 solemn presentation of the model m9 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:24.420
 took place on monday 3 may 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:26.430
 prepared in conditions of unprecedented 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.810
 secrecy that the communicator is now 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.220
 the city was built was known for a long time 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.380
 but all the details are awesome Putin 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:34.590
 managed to keep secret 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.190
 almost until the last moment 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.870
 understand responsive specifications

 100 it seems that for science this 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.600
 the apparatus its success is a matter of principle reasons 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.150
 there are at least two 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.330
 Firstly for several years now 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:51.509
 once the undisputed leader 

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:53.770
 mobile market active is losing its 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.449
 positions around the world so far 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:58.199
 pore science and failed 

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:00.360
 communicator that would fully respond 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.680
 modern 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.300
 in many ways just from this amount of system 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:05.910
 accustomed themselves turned out to be 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:07.059
 you are capable 

00:05:07.059 --> 00:05:09.620
 first saved the formula from the ancestors and the SSU 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:10.779
 so now 

00:05:10.779 --> 00:05:12.239
 developers have a chance 

00:05:12.239 --> 00:05:15.239
 answer all charges last year 

00:05:15.819 --> 00:05:18.770
 The second reason 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:20.900
 mortality and luck on the communicator market 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.259
 on the wave of trying to turn the tide in 

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:25.139
 world of companies turned out to come from 

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:26.879
 microsoft exchange

 without this moment external main 

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:30.969
 the internal policies of the companies have changed 

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:31.879
 radically 

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:34.520
 thousands of developers today transferred 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.879
 Russia has long been sold to other companies 

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:38.780
 the day before who will receive 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:39.610
 however he 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:42.660
 sparingly as for promising and here 

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:43.699
 which were spent

 colossal powers 

00:05:45.509 --> 00:05:46.960
 top management of the company decided 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:47.969
 to let out 

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:50.289

 this is a lot of products and configurations we 

00:05:59.009 --> 00:06:00.219
 just can not provide 

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:02.439
 products on the sport today 

00:06:02.439 --> 00:06:05.439
