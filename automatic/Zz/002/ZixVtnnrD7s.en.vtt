 welcome to you in this second video dedicated to prodi month the console 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:09.779
 for the visually impaired 

00:00:09.779 --> 00:00:12.609
 if you have not seen the overdraft video of the console I you 

00:00:12.609 --> 00:00:15.759
 strongly advise to understand the principle of this device 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.510
 so I have in front of me the console and here the game cartridge included during 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:21.470
 of the purchase 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.060
 these cartridges are done in a compulsively tightened way only in one 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.399
 meaning so no way to go wrong 

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:29.640
 once the cartridge is in place 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.380

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.480

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:12.590

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.290
 we must above all continue at the same pace on the orientation of the game to 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.920
 the approach of the group was thus created by 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:32.160
 that's all I'm here to follow I'm 18 years old 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.670
 on the right side 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.640
 of course we have several breaks on a cartridge 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.780
 so we can choose fare 2 euros m 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.060
 we are fighting the first one and I already started earlier 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.140
 is possible if the few boxes filled 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.680

 trial at the tora prison 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.940
 to represent her 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.700

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.250
 while here for example 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:10.889
 I already said 

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:14.429
 so if we do not know of course we can go back on track 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:20.109
 sony dr that 4th dr anyway 

00:02:21.779 --> 00:02:24.329
 money is well used 

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:27.329
 I want to say 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:29.709
 copycat 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:31.890
 try to see if you have to of course 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.289
 I move on to the next 

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:36.269
 it was founded m 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:38.039
 chick dr 

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:40.449
 it is so to give a good answer anyway 

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:42.359
 I want to say 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:44.219
 to mass 

00:02:44.219 --> 00:02:45.290
 right answer 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.070
 p this is migaud really angry so why can not you imagine 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:52.860
 when the grid fills up, it takes a lot of effort to focus on 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.290
 to visualize mentally 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.160
 it is an exercise in which the visually impaired are ready for all 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.860
 distributions to Tehran in the photo on the bottom right we will test a 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.860
 other amendment believe 

00:03:04.529 --> 00:03:07.529
 there are the support 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:10.919
 China counts more more 

00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:11.870
 battle 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.179
 we will test the battle 

00:03:14.179 --> 00:03:17.499
 I still have the iron against memc press the left sidewalk 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:19.309
 please 

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:22.569
 the days press the middle return 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:25.489
 so you can perhaps ask the interest to play alone in the battle 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:29.040
 it is precisely the interest of this one is that we will be able to play 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.329
 to two a visually impaired person will be able to interact via the console 

00:03:33.969 --> 00:03:36.139
 with a person 

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:39.139
 what you hear here are the gaps that is set up 

00:03:40.749 --> 00:03:43.749
 technical sheet at alstom to start the day 

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:51.519
 why 2 j -c 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:52.320
 h 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.599
 2 d -c 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:55.740
 I won 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:58.360
 if you want all the interest of this game of chance it's really the 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.339
 possibility to play several 

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:03.339
 it may be visually impaired or not 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:08.259
 therefore even if we do not have anything that emerges that I do not want 

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:10.910
 show is born the idea is Belgium is a game of chance 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:14.249
 considering all his interest in being able to play it several times 

00:04:14.249 --> 00:04:17.329
 you believe that we will finish sooner with the cost below I am 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:19.919
 it seemed to me not at all insofar as the process of 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:22.009
 mental visualization of the town hall 

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:25.360
 she adds that much more complex than for the crossword her record 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.660
 while auch first actors of the middle electoral edifice 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.230
 why are you taking easy since as I told you I find that it is 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:33.539
 a shame for him 

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:36.080
 g 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.949
 Yes 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:39.199
 Yes 

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:41.779
 we denounced line by line 

00:04:41.779 --> 00:04:44.439
 picket jr to note 

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:46.090
 Yes 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:46.979
 4 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:48.430
 solid 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.539
 after i know this is the last line targeting the second class 

00:04:52.069 --> 00:04:55.239
 and now in his selected snapshots of the south and almost empty 

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:57.840
 because I'm leaving 2 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.970
 paris 2 this one quoted at two 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.310
 if I support city will pass to detroit 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.310
 but I made a proposal 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.389
 and that I can make him read the lines to check that he has taken 

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:13.389
 count my god because god 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:17.129
 brito 

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:20.349
 4 which is otherwise completely false passage 

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:23.199
 so I think under two couples seem pretty hard for someone 

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:25.689
 who used to do it on paper 

00:05:25.689 --> 00:05:28.809
 but I imagine and I hope that for a person who is used to 

00:05:28.809 --> 00:05:30.080
 present things 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.919
 she mentally it's a little easier 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:35.400
 so I hope you could get a little idea of ​​how 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.389
 works this little dimon console do not hesitate to tell me in the 

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:42.159
 comments what do you think for the personal opinion go on my 

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:45.159
 blog and if not i tell you abdullah 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.570
