00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
typically used by developers once they

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.450 
typically used by developers once they
not<00:00:39.390> see<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.870> production<00:00:40.649> stage<00:00:40.920> of<00:00:41.219> their

hundreds thousands of devices this is

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.619 
hundreds thousands of devices this is
what<00:00:46.950> they<00:00:47.100> would<00:00:47.309> migrate<00:00:47.760> from<00:00:48.239> the

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
what they would migrate from the

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.950 
what they would migrate from the
multi-link<00:00:49.289> over<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.829> a<00:00:50.000> cycling<00:00:51.000> product<00:00:51.390> so

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
multi-link over to a cycling product so

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.020 
multi-link over to a cycling product so
this<00:00:52.110> is<00:00:52.230> like<00:00:52.350> a<00:00:52.410> common<00:00:53.129> like<00:00:53.250> an<00:00:53.340> entry<00:00:53.670> kind

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
this is like a common like an entry kind

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.689 
this is like a common like an entry kind
of<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.300> interface<00:00:55.199> exactly<00:00:56.100> so<00:00:56.340> when<00:00:56.610> you

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
of the interface exactly so when you

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.520 
of the interface exactly so when you
first<00:00:56.969> start<00:00:57.239> all<00:00:57.420> you<00:00:57.719> have<00:00:57.840> a<00:00:57.870> board<00:00:58.170> you

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
first start all you have a board you

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.380 
first start all you have a board you
have<00:00:58.620> your<00:00:58.770> own<00:00:58.859> product<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.699> you<00:01:00.030> need<00:01:00.180> to<00:01:00.270> do

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
have your own product and you need to do

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.689 
have your own product and you need to do
some<00:01:00.420> on<00:01:00.870> development<00:01:01.440> they<00:01:01.680> engineers<00:01:02.579> will

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
some on development they engineers will

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:03.860 
some on development they engineers will
typically<00:01:02.969> start<00:01:03.270> off<00:01:03.420> one<00:01:03.690> of<00:01:03.719> these

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
typically start off one of these

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.800 
typically start off one of these
multi-link<00:01:04.739> units<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.339> then<00:01:05.909> once<00:01:06.600> they're

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
multi-link units and then once they're

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.870 
multi-link units and then once they're
satisfied<00:01:07.080> with<00:01:07.590> that<00:01:07.770> once<00:01:08.130> they<00:01:08.310> move<00:01:08.520> over

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
satisfied with that once they move over

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.840 
satisfied with that once they move over
to<00:01:09.030> producing<00:01:09.659> thousands<00:01:10.590> of<00:01:10.740> units<00:01:11.010> they

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
to producing thousands of units they

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.670 
to producing thousands of units they
move<00:01:12.060> over<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.450> a<00:01:12.479> cycle<00:01:12.960> product<00:01:13.409> so<00:01:13.500> that's

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
move over to a cycle product so that's

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.859 
move over to a cycle product so that's
the<00:01:13.860> migration<00:01:14.549> path<00:01:14.790> vampy<00:01:15.299> in<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.479> office

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
the migration path vampy in the office

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.780 
the migration path vampy in the office
so<00:01:16.530> what<00:01:16.619> is<00:01:16.710> working<00:01:17.040> there<00:01:17.159> you<00:01:17.310> can<00:01:17.460> have<00:01:17.580> to

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
so what is working there you can have to

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.410 
so what is working there you can have to
but<00:01:18.509> you<00:01:18.600> connect<00:01:18.869> so<00:01:19.500> there's<00:01:20.340> a<00:01:20.430> multiple

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
but you connect so there's a multiple

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.240 
but you connect so there's a multiple
headers<00:01:22.080> here<00:01:22.110> for<00:01:22.619> all<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.740> different

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
headers here for all the different

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.780 
headers here for all the different
freescale<00:01:23.700> architectures<00:01:24.360> I'm<00:01:24.540> support

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
freescale architectures I'm support

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.720 
freescale architectures I'm support
right<00:01:25.880> now<00:01:26.030> we<00:01:26.090> are<00:01:26.210> working<00:01:26.360> as<00:01:27.310> ribbon<00:01:28.310> cable

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:28.730 
right now we are working as ribbon cable

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.000 
right now we are working as ribbon cable
and<00:01:29.300> there's<00:01:29.930> all<00:01:30.050> the<00:01:30.140> world's<00:01:30.410> before<00:01:30.740> fire

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.010 
and there's all the world's before fire

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.070 
and there's all the world's before fire
as<00:01:31.370> a<00:01:31.400> way<00:01:31.730> that<00:01:32.030> sort<00:01:32.270> of<00:01:32.300> thing<00:01:32.420> so<00:01:32.690> depending

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:33.080 
as a way that sort of thing so depending

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.360 
as a way that sort of thing so depending
what<00:01:33.200> you're<00:01:33.350> working<00:01:33.710> with<00:01:33.740> we<00:01:34.070> plug<00:01:34.340> a

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:34.370 
what you're working with we plug a

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.730 
what you're working with we plug a
different<00:01:34.790> ribbon<00:01:35.000> cable<00:01:35.390> into<00:01:35.630> each<00:01:35.810> one<00:01:36.140> and

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
different ribbon cable into each one and

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.740 
different ribbon cable into each one and
at<00:01:36.950> the<00:01:36.980> other<00:01:37.190> end<00:01:37.490> you<00:01:38.060> got<00:01:38.330> you'll<00:01:38.660> be

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
at the other end you got you'll be

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.870 
at the other end you got you'll be
connecting<00:01:39.200> to<00:01:39.410> your<00:01:39.620> target<00:01:40.070> board<00:01:40.400> here<00:01:40.700> so

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
connecting to your target board here so

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.180 
connecting to your target board here so
for<00:01:41.060> example<00:01:41.120> here<00:01:41.630> we<00:01:41.780> have<00:01:41.810> a<00:01:42.190> universal

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.190 
for example here we have a universal

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.430 
for example here we have a universal
multi-link<00:01:43.730> one<00:01:44.600> side<00:01:44.840> we<00:01:44.960> have<00:01:44.990> the<00:01:45.110> USB

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.440 
multi-link one side we have the USB

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.620 
multi-link one side we have the USB
connection<00:01:46.100> and<00:01:46.340> on<00:01:46.850> the<00:01:46.970> other<00:01:47.060> side<00:01:47.360> we<00:01:47.600> have

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
connection and on the other side we have

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.580 
connection and on the other side we have
the<00:01:47.810> actual<00:01:48.170> on<00:01:48.710> connections<00:01:49.190> lovely<00:01:50.120> hetero

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
the actual on connections lovely hetero

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.320 
the actual on connections lovely hetero
so<00:01:51.590> how<00:01:51.680> much<00:01:51.770> does<00:01:51.890> it<00:01:51.950> cost<00:01:52.060> so<00:01:53.060> right<00:01:53.300> now

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
so how much does it cost so right now

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.070 
so how much does it cost so right now
