00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:14.009
 Since then, I've been thinking about the air reporter in Sao 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.940
 bernardo 45 students of the July school 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:20.250
 visited the treatment plant 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:22.800
 rodolfo josÃ© da costa and silva where he is 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.420
 the water treatment process is done 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.519
 by sabesp 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.429
 the proposal was to raise awareness 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.640
 environmental protection for small 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:35.070
 talk about water use in school 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:37.110
 on the waste of material goods in the 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.480
 school with the goal that they take 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.180
 these more sustainable habits for the 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.640
 their daily lives and parents point to 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.920
 This is that at home now they already 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.410
 controls the bath time they took 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:53.610
 in the hourglass to measure 15 minutes of 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:55.649
 Wastage wash bath is car with 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.710
 hose these things so the 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.539
 idea to change small attitudes and 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.510
 with that do something that they reflect 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.400
 in great attitudes in the future 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:08.220
 taught and put into practice. 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.409
 practice within the classroom he did 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.170
 a proposal for them that are you now 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.270
 build for us is a model of 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.130
 as should be the right sanitation how 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.960
 You understood that and today you are 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.939
 doing this is all the material that is 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.430
 here it was they who brought them 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.259
 brought from home then involved the parents 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.840
 the family because they were asking 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:31.140
 have been telling for qq is for 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.420
 educators, the approach to the students is 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.540
 important for didactics is very 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.900
 rewarding but they face education 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.890
 You're with them not only 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.659
 transmit knowledge but we 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.939
 learn a lot, learned a lot 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:48.740
 with them on this project and it was very cool 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.740
 it was worth all the work 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.760
 and did they learn the lesson 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.770
 Right I did not know that the water came 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:00.530
 of all this 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:03.110
 how she was treated I thought she 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.300
 already just came from box d water and already this 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.080
 year our home and water the world ends 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.080
 we do not survive 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.430
 we have to preserve it I learned 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.520
 it is very important to take care of water 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:20.690
 because if we save, we will not 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:23.360
 and water is a natural resource given to 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:26.870
 It 's very important for nature that we 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:30.290
 take care of it even water used to 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:33.230
 various utilities like washing clothes take 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.070
 bath brush your car wash teeth and it is 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.580
 right 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:40.840
 water is something that all beings 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.840
 humans need to survive
