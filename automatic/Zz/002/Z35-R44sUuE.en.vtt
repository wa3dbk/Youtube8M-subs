00:00:12.763 --> 00:00:17.097
Well, my friend, once again it all comes to this

00:00:20.128 --> 00:00:26.256
Holding on for too long to something falling through our fingertips

00:00:28.427 --> 00:00:34.308
And it gets harder and harder to bear when we're not even sure

00:00:34.633 --> 00:00:36.711
We're not sure

00:00:36.711 --> 00:00:44.759
If there's anything, anything left that's worth this fighting for

00:00:46.604 --> 00:00:53.969
And it breaks my heart, how we're breaking down, ooooh

00:00:54.389 --> 00:00:57.156
But if there's something left, then don't give up

00:00:57.156 --> 00:01:00.316
On me now

00:01:01.018 --> 00:01:06.995
'Cause if we find a single diamond in the rough

00:01:06.995 --> 00:01:09.196
Then it's worth it

00:01:09.196 --> 00:01:14.889
Through a thousand tears if there's one drop of love

00:01:14.889 --> 00:01:17.009
Then it's worth it

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.847
Let me feel what I've got to feel

00:01:20.847 --> 00:01:24.846
For a glimpse of something real

00:01:24.846 --> 00:01:28.351
I don't care how much it hurts

00:01:28.351 --> 00:01:33.060
It is worth it, it's worth it

00:01:36.401 --> 00:01:40.039
Ooooh

00:01:42.484 --> 00:01:47.428
Once again we are standing at the hardest part

00:01:49.445 --> 00:01:53.278
Tripping over each other and trying to stumble

00:01:53.278 --> 00:01:56.928
Through the dark

00:01:57.806 --> 00:02:02.552
And it's harder and harder to see if it's all a mistake

00:02:05.013 --> 00:02:08.823
I know we said "let's be naive"

00:02:08.924 --> 00:02:14.277
But now we're open-eyed and wide awake

00:02:14.862 --> 00:02:22.091
But I'm holding out that there's hope alive

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:29.003
'Cause if there once was love, then maybe something survived

00:02:29.272 --> 00:02:34.853
'Cause if we find a single diamond in the rough

00:02:35.153 --> 00:02:37.117
Then it's worth it

00:02:37.117 --> 00:02:42.844
Through a thousand tears if there's one drop of love

00:02:42.844 --> 00:02:44.898
Then it's worth it

00:02:44.898 --> 00:02:48.802
Let me feel what I've got to feel

00:02:48.802 --> 00:02:52.871
For a glimpse of something real

00:02:52.871 --> 00:02:56.805
I don't care how much it hurts

00:02:56.079 --> 00:03:00.820
It is worth it, it's worth it

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.066
It's worth it

00:03:03.499 --> 00:03:10.771
Ooh, don't walk away to soon

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:18.629
Ooh, there's still something left to lose

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:26.263
Ooh, I'm holding on to you

00:03:26.804 --> 00:03:29.814
Hold me too

00:03:31.624 --> 00:03:37.322
'Cause if we find a single diamond in the rough

00:03:37.554 --> 00:03:39.631
Then it's worth it

00:03:39.878 --> 00:03:45.573
Through a thousand tears if there's one drop of love

00:03:45.573 --> 00:03:47.725
Then it's worth it

00:03:47.725 --> 00:03:51.887
Let me feel what I've got to feel

00:03:51.887 --> 00:03:55.729
For a glimpse of something real

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:59.503
I don't care how much it hurts

00:03:59.503 --> 00:04:03.843
I swear it's worth it, it's worth it

00:04:03.843 --> 00:04:11.892
I don't care how much it hurts, it is worth it

00:04:20.966 --> 00:04:27.518
Oh, it's worth it
