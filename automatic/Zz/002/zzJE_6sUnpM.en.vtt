here that's holding up my peas I came
out<00:00:23.850> here<00:00:24.000> two<00:00:24.180> days<00:00:24.330> ago<00:00:24.390> actually<00:00:25.230> it's<00:00:25.380> been

out here two days ago actually it's been

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.080 
out here two days ago actually it's been
happening<00:00:25.740> for<00:00:26.010> about<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.369> last<00:00:26.400> month<00:00:26.789> but

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
happening for about the last month but

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.109 
happening for about the last month but
two<00:00:27.599> days<00:00:27.750> ago<00:00:27.980> it<00:00:28.980> was<00:00:29.039> just<00:00:29.310> swarmed<00:00:30.029> with

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
two days ago it was just swarmed with

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.799 
two days ago it was just swarmed with
ants<00:00:31.279> they're<00:00:32.279> coming<00:00:32.669> out<00:00:32.790> of<00:00:32.910> here<00:00:33.090> little

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
hole and I think they're dividing their

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.650 
hole and I think they're dividing their
colony<00:00:37.340> almost<00:00:38.340> every<00:00:38.610> ant<00:00:38.820> had<00:00:39.090> an<00:00:39.210> egg<00:00:39.390> sack

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660

understanding<00:02:11.830> it<00:02:12.070> could<00:02:12.250> be<00:02:12.370> incorrect<00:02:12.790> what

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
understanding it could be incorrect what

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:14.850 
understanding it could be incorrect what
it<00:02:13.630> does<00:02:13.810> is<00:02:14.020> it<00:02:14.140> gets<00:02:14.260> in<00:02:14.470> between<00:02:14.770> the

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
it does is it gets in between the

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.970 
it does is it gets in between the
segments<00:02:15.370> and<00:02:15.520> it<00:02:15.640> dries<00:02:16.120> the<00:02:17.080> animal<00:02:17.410> out<00:02:17.530> it

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
segments and it dries the animal out it

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.370 
segments and it dries the animal out it
sucks<00:02:18.459> the<00:02:18.610> moisture<00:02:18.790> out<00:02:19.000> of<00:02:19.120> them<00:02:19.300> but<00:02:20.080> it

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
sucks the moisture out of them but it

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.800 
sucks the moisture out of them but it
also<00:02:20.410> tears<00:02:21.010> up<00:02:21.190> their<00:02:21.340> carapace<00:02:21.760> too<00:02:22.000> so

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
also tears up their carapace too so

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.620 
also tears up their carapace too so
actually<00:02:23.709> it's<00:02:24.400> not<00:02:24.640> the<00:02:24.760> most<00:02:24.940> humane<00:02:25.330> way<00:02:25.390> to

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
actually it's not the most humane way to

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.900 
actually it's not the most humane way to
die<00:02:25.930> but<00:02:25.959> you<00:02:26.530> know<00:02:26.709> these<00:02:27.010> are<00:02:27.070> insects<00:02:27.670> and

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
die but you know these are insects and

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.370 
die but you know these are insects and
these<00:02:28.090> are<00:02:28.410> ants<00:02:29.410> and<00:02:29.620> you<00:02:29.800> know<00:02:30.370> there's

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
these are ants and you know there's

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.540 
these are ants and you know there's
quadrillion<00:02:32.380> ants<00:02:32.740> on<00:02:32.860> the<00:02:32.890> planet<00:02:33.340> so

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
quadrillion ants on the planet so

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
quadrillion ants on the planet so
they're<00:02:34.090> not<00:02:34.300> danger<00:02:35.340> as<00:02:36.340> you<00:02:36.820> can<00:02:36.940> see<00:02:37.060> I<00:02:37.270> put

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
they're not danger as you can see I put

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.480 
they're not danger as you can see I put
all<00:02:37.930> the<00:02:38.080> diatomaceous<00:02:38.590> earth<00:02:38.650> on<00:02:39.190> the<00:02:39.280> ground

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.490 
all the diatomaceous earth on the ground

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.100 
all the diatomaceous earth on the ground
because<00:02:40.209> the<00:02:40.360> ants<00:02:40.510> were<00:02:40.660> coming<00:02:40.959> up<00:02:41.050> the

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
because the ants were coming up the

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.580 
because the ants were coming up the
trellis<00:02:41.470> and<00:02:42.480> I<00:02:43.480> figure<00:02:44.080> there<00:02:44.290> are<00:02:44.320> less

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
trellis and I figure there are less

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.800 
trellis and I figure there are less
beneficial<00:02:45.130> insects<00:02:45.670> right<00:02:46.270> on<00:02:46.450> the<00:02:46.570> ground

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
beneficial insects right on the ground

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.640 
beneficial insects right on the ground
there<00:02:47.050> as<00:02:47.400> you<00:02:48.400> see<00:02:48.610> the<00:02:48.760> peace<00:02:49.560> you<00:02:50.560> know

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
there as you see the peace you know

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:51.840 
there as you see the peace you know
there's<00:02:50.830> a<00:02:50.890> little<00:02:51.100> bit<00:02:51.340> of<00:02:51.370> diatomaceous

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
there's a little bit of diatomaceous

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.910 
there's a little bit of diatomaceous
earth<00:02:51.910> where<00:02:52.540> I<00:02:52.570> kind<00:02:53.200> of<00:02:53.290> got<00:02:53.440> carried<00:02:53.650> away

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
earth where I kind of got carried away

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.259 
earth where I kind of got carried away
but<00:02:54.420> overall<00:02:55.560> 90%<00:02:56.560> of<00:02:56.590> the<00:02:56.680> PSR<00:02:57.040> has<00:02:57.519> no

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
but overall 90% of the PSR has no

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:02.820 
but overall 90% of the PSR has no
diatomaceous<00:02:58.840> earth<00:02:58.900> on<00:02:59.470> it<00:03:00.780> and<00:03:01.780> as<00:03:02.650> you<00:03:02.709> can

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
diatomaceous earth on it and as you can

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:07.160 
diatomaceous earth on it and as you can
see<00:03:03.300> there<00:03:04.300> are<00:03:04.390> no<00:03:04.600> ants<00:03:05.700> they're<00:03:06.700> gone

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
see there are no ants they're gone

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.840 
see there are no ants they're gone
now<00:03:08.170> this<00:03:08.560> diatomaceous<00:03:08.950> earth<00:03:09.010> like<00:03:09.580> I<00:03:09.670> said

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
now this diatomaceous earth like I said

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.810 
now this diatomaceous earth like I said
I<00:03:09.880> put<00:03:09.970> that<00:03:10.269> down<00:03:10.390> two<00:03:10.600> days<00:03:10.750> ago<00:03:11.610> but<00:03:12.610> what<00:03:12.790> I

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
I put that down two days ago but what I

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.990 
I put that down two days ago but what I
had<00:03:13.030> to<00:03:13.150> do<00:03:13.269> is<00:03:13.540> as<00:03:13.959> soon<00:03:14.019> as<00:03:14.260> it<00:03:14.350> gets<00:03:14.410> wet<00:03:14.709> it

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
had to do is as soon as it gets wet it

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.949 
had to do is as soon as it gets wet it
becomes<00:03:17.940> it<00:03:18.940> doesn't<00:03:19.269> work<00:03:19.360> as<00:03:19.540> well<00:03:19.570> because

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
becomes it doesn't work as well because

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:21.870 
becomes it doesn't work as well because
it's<00:03:20.290> it's<00:03:20.530> a<00:03:20.650> powder<00:03:20.860> so<00:03:21.430> as<00:03:21.519> soon<00:03:21.670> as<00:03:21.730> it<00:03:21.820> gets

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
it's it's a powder so as soon as it gets

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.920 
it's it's a powder so as soon as it gets
moist<00:03:22.150> it<00:03:22.540> kind<00:03:23.440> of<00:03:23.880> clumps<00:03:24.880> up<00:03:25.030> and<00:03:25.330> it's<00:03:25.690> not

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
moist it kind of clumps up and it's not

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.380 
moist it kind of clumps up and it's not
as<00:03:26.080> fine<00:03:26.320> and<00:03:26.560> as<00:03:26.650> dusty<00:03:27.070> anymore<00:03:27.280> so<00:03:28.239> what<00:03:28.360> I

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390

did right now is I just did a second

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
coating on the ground only just to get

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.880 
coating on the ground only just to get
any<00:03:33.459> remnant<00:03:33.970> ants<00:03:34.380> because<00:03:35.380> in<00:03:35.530> the<00:03:35.620> morning
