like but why do these concentrated foods
that<00:00:02.610> are<00:00:02.760> so<00:00:02.939> harmful<00:00:03.240> to<00:00:03.600> us<00:00:03.750> chemist<00:00:04.319> so

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
that are so harmful to us chemist so

that are so harmful to us chemist so
much<00:00:04.620> pleasure<00:00:05.270> dr.<00:00:06.270> Lyle<00:00:06.540> says<00:00:06.899> the<00:00:07.170> answer

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
much pleasure dr. Lyle says the answer

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.190 
much pleasure dr. Lyle says the answer
is<00:00:07.649> related<00:00:08.099> to<00:00:08.220> a<00:00:08.250> system<00:00:08.670> called<00:00:08.910> a

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:09.200 
is related to a system called a

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.020 
is related to a system called a
motivational<00:00:10.200> triad<00:00:10.530> this<00:00:11.400> is<00:00:11.550> a<00:00:11.580> trio<00:00:11.940> of

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
motivational triad this is a trio of

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.209 
motivational triad this is a trio of
biological<00:00:12.900> mechanisms<00:00:13.530> that<00:00:13.710> nature<00:00:14.070> has

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
biological mechanisms that nature has

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.640 
biological mechanisms that nature has
designed<00:00:14.639> into<00:00:14.969> every<00:00:15.299> creature<00:00:15.570> on<00:00:15.780> earth<00:00:15.839> so

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
designed into every creature on earth so

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.590 
designed into every creature on earth so
they<00:00:16.770> can<00:00:16.920> survive<00:00:17.279> to<00:00:17.550> pass<00:00:17.760> their<00:00:18.029> genes<00:00:18.060> on

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
they can survive to pass their genes on

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.349 
they can survive to pass their genes on
to<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:18.840> next<00:00:19.050> generation<00:00:19.789> the<00:00:20.789> first<00:00:20.820> leg<00:00:21.330> of

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
to the next generation the first leg of

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.480 
to the next generation the first leg of
the<00:00:21.570> motivational<00:00:22.170> triad<00:00:22.650> is<00:00:23.100> pleasure

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
the motivational triad is pleasure

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.839 
the motivational triad is pleasure
seeking<00:00:23.880> and<00:00:24.740> primarily<00:00:25.740> two<00:00:26.160> things<00:00:26.519> or

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
seeking and primarily two things or

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.670 
seeking and primarily two things or
because<00:00:27.150> of<00:00:27.180> that<00:00:27.480> and<00:00:27.720> those<00:00:28.050> two<00:00:28.230> things<00:00:28.439> are

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
because of that and those two things are

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.919 
because of that and those two things are
food<00:00:28.980> insects<00:00:29.490> so<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.330> case<00:00:30.480> of<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:30.750> great

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
food insects so the case of a great

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.840 
food insects so the case of a great
white<00:00:31.140> shark<00:00:31.170> it's<00:00:31.710> basically<00:00:32.219> got<00:00:32.460> a<00:00:32.489> neon

that's<00:00:41.070> pretty<00:00:41.340> much<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.460> same<00:00:41.730> thing<00:00:41.969> the

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
that's pretty much the same thing the

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.600 
that's pretty much the same thing the
other<00:00:42.930> two<00:00:43.200> legs<00:00:43.440> of<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.680> motivational<00:00:44.309> triad

us into something dr. Lyle calls a
pleasure<00:01:31.170> track<00:01:31.560> what<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.400> pleasure<00:01:32.670> trap<00:01:33.000> is

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
pleasure track what the pleasure trap is

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.370 
pleasure track what the pleasure trap is
is<00:01:33.659> an<00:01:34.590> interaction<00:01:35.310> between<00:01:35.990> our<00:01:36.990> natural

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
is an interaction between our natural

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.749 
is an interaction between our natural
instincts<00:01:37.829> which<00:01:38.009> we're<00:01:38.159> trying<00:01:38.400> to<00:01:38.490> tell<00:01:38.640> us

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
instincts which we're trying to tell us

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.789 
instincts which we're trying to tell us
the<00:01:38.790> right<00:01:39.030> thing<00:01:39.210> to<00:01:39.299> do<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:39.600> some<00:01:40.500> kind<00:01:40.740> of

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
the right thing to do and some kind of

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.460 
the right thing to do and some kind of
artificial<00:01:41.250> modern<00:01:41.880> stimulation<00:01:42.600> that<00:01:43.290> is

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
artificial modern stimulation that is

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.530 
artificial modern stimulation that is
piggybacking<00:01:44.100> or<00:01:44.369> hijacking<00:01:44.820> that<00:01:45.119> process

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
piggybacking or hijacking that process

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.109 
piggybacking or hijacking that process
so<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.530> classic<00:01:47.009> example<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.610> pleasure<00:01:47.820> trap

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
so the classic example the pleasure trap

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.630 
so the classic example the pleasure trap
would<00:01:48.780> be<00:01:48.960> drugs<00:01:49.350> and<00:01:49.710> drug<00:01:49.890> addiction<00:01:50.040> the

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
would be drugs and drug addiction the

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.800 
would be drugs and drug addiction the
way<00:01:50.790> drugs<00:01:51.119> work<00:01:51.420> is<00:01:51.810> they<00:01:52.970> hijack<00:01:53.970> the

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
way drugs work is they hijack the

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.230 
way drugs work is they hijack the
existing<00:01:55.350> pleasure<00:01:55.680> circus<00:01:56.130> when<00:01:56.759> certain

existing pleasure circus when certain
