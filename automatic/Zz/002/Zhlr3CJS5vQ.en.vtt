okay<00:00:27.110> now<00:00:27.289> i'm<00:00:27.500> using<00:00:27.529> the<00:00:27.980> poster<00:00:28.369> board<00:00:28.609> to

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:29.090 
okay now i'm using the poster board to

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.470 
okay now i'm using the poster board to
create<00:00:29.770> what<00:00:30.770> I<00:00:30.800> call<00:00:30.890> the<00:00:31.160> wallpaper<00:00:31.640> for<00:00:32.449> the

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:32.480 
create what I call the wallpaper for the

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.950 
create what I call the wallpaper for the
sides<00:00:32.809> of<00:00:33.110> the<00:00:33.470> marble<00:00:33.739> cascade<00:00:34.190> ramps<00:00:34.580> and

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:34.960 
sides of the marble cascade ramps and

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.479 
sides of the marble cascade ramps and
I've<00:00:35.960> already<00:00:36.110> placed<00:00:36.530> a<00:00:36.710> lot<00:00:36.860> of<00:00:36.980> the<00:00:37.070> Cascade

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489 
I've already placed a lot of the Cascade

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.049 
I've already placed a lot of the Cascade
ramps<00:00:37.879> on<00:00:38.059> as<00:00:38.510> you<00:00:39.140> can<00:00:39.260> see<00:00:39.820> it's<00:00:40.820> a<00:00:40.879> little

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:41.059 
ramps on as you can see it's a little

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:43.840 
ramps on as you can see it's a little
bit<00:00:41.409> hard<00:00:42.409> to<00:00:42.470> tell<00:00:42.680> from<00:00:42.890> this<00:00:43.100> distance<00:00:43.159> but

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
bit hard to tell from this distance but

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.210 
bit hard to tell from this distance but
most<00:00:44.540> of<00:00:44.659> the<00:00:44.720> Rams<00:00:44.930> have<00:00:45.170> the<00:00:45.589> wallpaper<00:00:46.010> on

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:46.220 
most of the Rams have the wallpaper on

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.500 
most of the Rams have the wallpaper on
them<00:00:46.430> right<00:00:47.089> now<00:00:47.150> I'm<00:00:47.540> just<00:00:48.019> measuring<00:00:48.620> a

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510 
them right now I'm just measuring a

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.479 
them right now I'm just measuring a
three-fourths<00:00:50.510> of<00:00:50.720> an<00:00:50.870> inch<00:00:51.280> making<00:00:52.280> hash

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:52.489 
three-fourths of an inch making hash

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:55.079 
three-fourths of an inch making hash
marks<00:00:52.909> at<00:00:53.210> three<00:00:53.570> three<00:00:54.110> quarters<00:00:54.440> of<00:00:54.470> an<00:00:54.739> inch

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:55.089 
marks at three three quarters of an inch

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:57.579 
marks at three three quarters of an inch
then<00:00:56.089> making<00:00:56.420> lines<00:00:56.750> all<00:00:57.019> the<00:00:57.049> way<00:00:57.140> across<00:00:57.350> the

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:57.589 
then making lines all the way across the

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:01.170 
then making lines all the way across the
paper<00:00:58.010> I<00:00:58.400> mean<00:00:59.299> across<00:00:59.629> the<00:00:59.750> cardstock<00:01:00.140> and

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:01.180 
paper I mean across the cardstock and

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.600 
paper I mean across the cardstock and
then<00:01:02.180> I<00:01:02.269> take<00:01:02.650> laser<00:01:03.650> printer<00:01:04.040> paper<00:01:04.190> and

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
then I take laser printer paper and

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:10.570 
then I take laser printer paper and
crinkle<00:01:05.210> it<00:01:05.269> three<00:01:05.510> times<00:01:09.130> you<00:01:10.130> can<00:01:10.310> see<00:01:10.460> the

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
crinkle it three times you can see the

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.580 
crinkle it three times you can see the
poster<00:01:10.909> board<00:01:11.090> underneath<00:01:11.420> my<00:01:11.690> hands<00:01:12.140> with

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
poster board underneath my hands with

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.090 
poster board underneath my hands with
the<00:01:12.830> the<00:01:13.579> lines<00:01:13.850> across<00:01:14.450> them<00:01:14.780> I<00:01:14.930> think<00:01:15.859> in<00:01:15.979> the

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
the the lines across them I think in the

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.289 
the the lines across them I think in the
tutorial<00:01:16.460> I<00:01:16.820> said<00:01:17.200> 1-inch<00:01:18.200> strips<00:01:19.299> originally

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:20.299 
tutorial I said 1-inch strips originally

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:32.630 
tutorial I said 1-inch strips originally
and<00:01:20.840> but<00:01:21.469> I<00:01:21.500> changed<00:01:21.859> that<00:01:22.009> later

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.370 

okay<00:01:33.640> now<00:01:33.789> i<00:01:33.820> take<00:01:34.179> the<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:35.829> poster<00:01:36.219> board<00:01:36.460> and

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
okay now i take the the poster board and

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.789 
okay now i take the the poster board and
a<00:01:38.380> newspaper<00:01:38.799> and<00:01:40.289> i'm<00:01:41.289> going<00:01:41.500> to<00:01:41.560> put<00:01:41.710> the

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
glue on the side that doesn't have the

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:52.500 
glue on the side that doesn't have the
lines<00:01:43.719> on<00:01:43.960> it

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.510 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:54.330 

because<00:01:53.170> it's<00:01:53.350> a<00:01:53.410> fairly<00:01:53.650> large<00:01:53.860> sheet<00:01:54.190> i'm

because it's a fairly large sheet i'm

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.990 
because it's a fairly large sheet i'm
using<00:01:54.700> a<00:01:54.940> fairly<00:01:55.780> large<00:01:55.990> amount<00:01:56.500> of<00:01:56.670> glue<00:01:57.670> and

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
using a fairly large amount of glue and

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.850 
using a fairly large amount of glue and
I<00:01:58.150> just<00:01:58.360> smear<00:01:59.110> it<00:01:59.140> on<00:01:59.290> I<00:02:01.320> try<00:02:02.320> to<00:02:02.380> get<00:02:02.560> every

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
I just smear it on I try to get every

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.570 
I just smear it on I try to get every
square<00:02:03.810> Senate<00:02:04.810> I<00:02:04.870> mean<00:02:05.050> every<00:02:05.530> square<00:02:05.830> yeah

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
every square centimeter is going to say

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:23.610 
every square centimeter is going to say
millimeter<00:02:21.030> ok<00:02:22.030> I<00:02:22.270> remove<00:02:22.960> the<00:02:23.110> newspaper<00:02:23.500> and

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620

millimeter ok I remove the newspaper and
put<00:02:24.280> the<00:02:24.520> crinkled<00:02:24.910> paper<00:02:24.940> down<00:02:25.360> I<00:02:28.170> place<00:02:29.170> it

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
on the crinkled paper and see that oh

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.240 
on the crinkled paper and see that oh
it's<00:02:31.690> a<00:02:31.750> little<00:02:31.960> too<00:02:32.080> large<00:02:32.320> on<00:02:32.530> one<00:02:32.740> end<00:02:35.250> that

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
it's a little too large on one end that

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.520 
it's a little too large on one end that
end<00:02:36.430> right<00:02:36.610> there<00:02:36.640> so<00:02:37.090> I'm<00:02:37.210> going<00:02:37.450> to<00:02:37.500> cut<00:02:38.500> that

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
end right there so I'm going to cut that

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:46.680 
end right there so I'm going to cut that
off<00:02:43.470> do<00:02:44.470> a<00:02:44.740> lot<00:02:45.160> of<00:02:45.220> my<00:02:45.520> measuring<00:02:46.150> by

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
off do a lot of my measuring by

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.130 
off do a lot of my measuring by
eyeballing<00:02:47.670> sizes<00:02:48.670> that's<00:02:49.600> not<00:02:49.840> always<00:02:49.990> the

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
eyeballing sizes that's not always the

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.860 
eyeballing sizes that's not always the
best<00:02:50.320> way<00:02:50.440> to<00:02:50.560> do<00:02:50.740> it<00:02:50.890> but<00:02:51.180> it<00:02:52.180> works<00:02:52.360> well

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
best way to do it but it works well

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.270 
best way to do it but it works well
enough<00:02:52.900> for<00:02:53.170> me<00:02:53.410> usually<00:02:55.410> ok<00:02:56.410> i<00:02:56.440> press<00:02:57.040> it<00:02:57.070> on

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
enough for me usually ok i press it on

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.850 
enough for me usually ok i press it on
the<00:02:57.400> paper<00:02:57.580> and<00:02:57.959> when<00:02:58.959> I'm<00:02:59.110> when<00:02:59.560> I<00:02:59.590> first

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
the paper and when I'm when I first

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.590 
the paper and when I'm when I first
start<00:03:00.100> pressing<00:03:00.310> it<00:03:00.610> I<00:03:00.700> also<00:03:00.880> pull<00:03:01.239> the<00:03:01.420> paper

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
start pressing it I also pull the paper

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.120 
start pressing it I also pull the paper
I<00:03:03.270> want<00:03:04.270> to<00:03:04.450> I<00:03:04.780> don't<00:03:05.260> want<00:03:05.380> it<00:03:05.470> to<00:03:05.770> be<00:03:05.920> too

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
I want to I don't want it to be too

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.780 
I want to I don't want it to be too
super<00:03:06.850> crinkly<00:03:07.300> because<00:03:07.750> then<00:03:07.930> it's<00:03:08.080> hard<00:03:08.230> too

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
super crinkly because then it's hard too

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.850 
super crinkly because then it's hard too
hard<00:03:09.790> to<00:03:10.420> glue<00:03:10.600> things<00:03:10.870> against<00:03:11.350> it<00:03:11.470> when<00:03:11.739> it's

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
hard to glue things against it when it's

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.620 
hard to glue things against it when it's
too<00:03:12.010> quickly<00:03:12.280> and<00:03:12.550> it<00:03:12.820> doesn't<00:03:13.150> look<00:03:13.239> as<00:03:13.420> good

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
too quickly and it doesn't look as good

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:29.580 
too quickly and it doesn't look as good
so<00:03:14.470> I<00:03:16.709> just<00:03:17.709> press<00:03:17.950> it<00:03:17.980> thoroughly

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.900 

then<00:03:30.590> I<00:03:30.680> flip<00:03:30.950> it<00:03:31.040> over<00:03:31.190> on<00:03:31.400> the<00:03:31.430> newspaper

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
then I flip it over on the newspaper

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.090 
then I flip it over on the newspaper
because<00:03:32.600> there's<00:03:33.170> glue<00:03:33.380> on<00:03:33.560> the<00:03:33.680> other<00:03:33.800> side

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
because there's glue on the other side

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.460 
because there's glue on the other side
and<00:03:34.460> I<00:03:34.700> don't<00:03:34.910> don't<00:03:35.780> want<00:03:35.960> to<00:03:36.050> get<00:03:36.170> the<00:03:36.290> glue

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
and I don't don't want to get the glue

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:43.300 
and I don't don't want to get the glue
on<00:03:36.650> the<00:03:36.830> table<00:03:39.730> once<00:03:40.730> I<00:03:40.850> pressed<00:03:41.150> it<00:03:41.590> then<00:03:42.590> then

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
on the table once I pressed it then then

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.210 
on the table once I pressed it then then
I<00:03:43.340> want<00:03:43.610> to<00:03:43.790> trim<00:03:44.150> it<00:03:44.300> but<00:03:45.230> I<00:03:45.260> leave<00:03:45.560> about<00:03:46.160> a

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
I want to trim it but I leave about a

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.420 
I want to trim it but I leave about a
quarter<00:03:46.640> of<00:03:46.820> an<00:03:47.210> inch<00:03:48.040> trim<00:03:49.040> around<00:03:49.220> the

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
quarter of an inch trim around the

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:50.710 
quarter of an inch trim around the
entire<00:03:49.700> thing<00:03:49.760> because<00:03:50.210> I<00:03:50.330> want<00:03:50.480> to<00:03:50.510> fold

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
entire thing because I want to fold

00:03:50.720 --> 00:04:00.090 
entire thing because I want to fold
those<00:03:50.960> edges<00:03:51.350> over<00:03:57.820> then<00:03:58.820> I<00:03:58.940> cut<00:03:59.150> the<00:03:59.300> corners

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
those edges over then I cut the corners

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:06.510 
those edges over then I cut the corners
right<00:04:01.100> almost<00:04:01.910> flush<00:04:02.240> against<00:04:02.660> the<00:04:02.720> corner<00:04:03.110> I

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:06.520 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.790 

don't<00:04:07.520> want<00:04:07.670> to<00:04:07.730> get<00:04:07.820> a<00:04:07.850> to<00:04:08.120> flush<00:04:08.800> because

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:09.800 
don't want to get a to flush because

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:16.330 
don't want to get a to flush because
when<00:04:10.010> I<00:04:10.040> I<00:04:10.370> fold<00:04:11.140> the<00:04:12.340> both<00:04:13.340> the<00:04:13.540> trim<00:04:15.220> over<00:04:16.220> the

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
when I I fold the both the trim over the

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:19.360 
when I I fold the both the trim over the
paper<00:04:16.959> the<00:04:17.959> bear<00:04:18.440> corners<00:04:18.890> might<00:04:19.130> poke

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
paper the bear corners might poke

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.070 
paper the bear corners might poke
through<00:04:19.669> so<00:04:20.000> I<00:04:20.239> always<00:04:20.450> leave<00:04:20.690> a<00:04:20.750> little<00:04:20.900> space

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:21.080 
through so I always leave a little space

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:23.170 
through so I always leave a little space
as<00:04:21.470> you<00:04:22.160> could<00:04:22.280> see<00:04:22.310> I<00:04:22.460> kind<00:04:22.700> of<00:04:22.760> creased<00:04:23.000> it

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 
as you could see I kind of creased it

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.820 
as you could see I kind of creased it
ahead<00:04:23.390> of<00:04:23.450> time<00:04:23.570> and<00:04:23.720> then<00:04:23.960> I<00:04:24.020> take<00:04:24.290> glue<00:04:24.620> with

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
ahead of time and then I take glue with

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:27.300 
ahead of time and then I take glue with
the<00:04:24.919> bottle<00:04:25.310> and<00:04:25.970> just<00:04:26.270> put<00:04:26.510> a<00:04:26.540> line<00:04:26.810> of<00:04:27.020> glue

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
the bottle and just put a line of glue

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.280 
the bottle and just put a line of glue
against<00:04:28.310> the<00:04:28.490> cardstock<00:04:29.240> where<00:04:30.169> the

cardstock and cardstock and the paper
meet<00:04:32.780> and<00:04:33.080> then<00:04:33.140> I<00:04:33.290> spread<00:04:34.280> it<00:04:34.340> on<00:04:34.550> like<00:04:34.820> this<00:04:35.030> I

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
meet and then I spread it on like this I

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.460 
meet and then I spread it on like this I
use<00:04:36.560> the<00:04:37.040> cap<00:04:37.850> of<00:04:38.030> the<00:04:38.060> bottle<00:04:38.290> almost<00:04:39.290> as<00:04:39.440> a

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
use the cap of the bottle almost as a

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.440 
use the cap of the bottle almost as a
brush<00:04:39.770> and<00:04:40.130> I'm<00:04:40.610> not<00:04:40.790> actually<00:04:41.000> squeezing

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:41.450 
brush and I'm not actually squeezing

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:44.620 
brush and I'm not actually squeezing
more<00:04:41.690> glue<00:04:41.930> out<00:04:42.169> of<00:04:42.290> it<00:04:42.380> i'm<00:04:42.500> just<00:04:43.180> just<00:04:44.180> using

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:44.630 
more glue out of it i'm just just using

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:59.520 
more glue out of it i'm just just using
the<00:04:44.720> cap<00:04:44.900> as<00:04:45.110> a<00:04:45.140> brush

00:04:59.520 --> 00:04:59.530 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:08.200 

then<00:05:00.530> I<00:05:00.620> press<00:05:00.830> down<00:05:01.190> on<00:05:01.490> the<00:05:02.080> trim<00:05:06.910> try<00:05:07.910> to<00:05:07.970> get

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.210 
then I press down on the trim try to get

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:11.200 
then I press down on the trim try to get
it<00:05:08.330> as<00:05:08.420> I<00:05:09.100> try<00:05:10.100> to<00:05:10.160> press<00:05:10.370> it<00:05:10.520> down<00:05:10.550> as<00:05:10.880> well<00:05:11.090> as

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210 
it as I try to press it down as well as

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:38.050 
it as I try to press it down as well as
possible<00:05:33.730> and<00:05:34.730> then<00:05:35.060> I'll<00:05:35.300> cut<00:05:35.690> a<00:05:35.720> strip<00:05:37.060> and

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:38.060 
possible and then I'll cut a strip and

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:41.350 
possible and then I'll cut a strip and
remember<00:05:38.810> this<00:05:39.020> strip<00:05:39.410> is<00:05:40.330> three-quarters<00:05:41.330> of

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 
remember this strip is three-quarters of

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:46.900 
remember this strip is three-quarters of
an<00:05:41.660> inch<00:05:41.870> wide<00:05:45.070> i'm<00:05:46.070> using<00:05:46.250> a<00:05:46.520> scissors

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:46.910 
an inch wide i'm using a scissors

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:49.030 
an inch wide i'm using a scissors
instead<00:05:47.120> of<00:05:47.420> the<00:05:47.480> paper<00:05:47.690> cutter<00:05:48.020> because<00:05:48.470> the

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:49.040 
instead of the paper cutter because the

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.860 
instead of the paper cutter because the
paper<00:05:49.220> cutter<00:05:49.610> doesn't<00:05:50.000> work<00:05:50.180> very<00:05:50.210> well<00:05:50.510> when

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:50.870 
paper cutter doesn't work very well when

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:52.750 
paper cutter doesn't work very well when
there's<00:05:51.080> a<00:05:51.140> layer<00:05:51.320> of<00:05:51.440> glue<00:05:51.740> there<00:05:52.040> and<00:05:52.250> it's

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:52.760 
there's a layer of glue there and it's

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:53.980 
there's a layer of glue there and it's
not<00:05:52.910> very<00:05:52.940> good<00:05:53.150> for<00:05:53.270> the<00:05:53.480> blade<00:05:53.690> either

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:53.990 
not very good for the blade either

00:05:53.990 --> 00:06:01.750 
not very good for the blade either
either<00:05:59.080> okay<00:06:00.080> i'm<00:06:00.170> going<00:06:00.350> to<00:06:00.440> put<00:06:00.620> i'm<00:06:01.610> going

then I press it on and I hold it in

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:47.180 
then I press it on and I hold it in
place<00:06:45.240> the<00:06:45.960> poster<00:06:46.320> board<00:06:46.560> and<00:06:46.710> sometimes

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:47.190 
place the poster board and sometimes

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:49.250 
place the poster board and sometimes
cardstock<00:06:47.700> doesn't<00:06:48.240> it<00:06:48.780> takes<00:06:48.990> a<00:06:49.110> while

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:49.260 
cardstock doesn't it takes a while

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.250 
cardstock doesn't it takes a while
sometimes<00:06:49.320> for<00:06:50.040> the<00:06:50.130> glue<00:06:50.280> to<00:06:50.310> take<00:06:51.140> I'm<00:06:52.140> going

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:52.260 
sometimes for the glue to take I'm going

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.860 
sometimes for the glue to take I'm going
to<00:06:52.320> do<00:06:52.440> the<00:06:52.560> same<00:06:52.590> thing<00:06:53.010> there's<00:06:53.430> a<00:06:53.700> wall<00:06:54.480> that

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:54.870 
to do the same thing there's a wall that

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:58.880 
to do the same thing there's a wall that
you<00:06:55.290> can't<00:06:55.560> see<00:06:55.860> on<00:06:56.670> the<00:06:57.210> other<00:06:57.330> side<00:06:57.630> of<00:06:57.890> that

00:06:58.880 --> 00:06:58.890 
you can't see on the other side of that

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:01.970 
you can't see on the other side of that
ramp<00:06:59.340> right<00:06:59.610> there<00:06:59.820> and<00:07:00.350> so<00:07:01.350> this<00:07:01.590> this

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:01.980 
ramp right there and so this this

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:03.470 
ramp right there and so this this
wallpaper<00:07:02.490> is<00:07:02.610> going<00:07:02.940> to<00:07:03.000> go<00:07:03.150> on<00:07:03.270> the<00:07:03.390> other

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:03.480 
wallpaper is going to go on the other

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:08.000 
wallpaper is going to go on the other
side<00:07:03.780> of<00:07:03.810> the<00:07:03.900> ramp<00:07:05.690> again<00:07:06.690> I<00:07:06.920> kind<00:07:07.920> of

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:08.010 
side of the ramp again I kind of

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:12.800 
side of the ramp again I kind of
eyeballed<00:07:08.520> the<00:07:08.850> measurement<00:07:09.780> for<00:07:09.990> it<00:07:11.690> and<00:07:12.690> I

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:12.810 
eyeballed the measurement for it and I

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:15.260 
eyeballed the measurement for it and I
glue<00:07:13.050> the<00:07:13.200> back<00:07:13.350> side<00:07:13.620> this<00:07:14.100> time<00:07:14.160> this<00:07:15.060> time

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:15.270 
glue the back side this time this time

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:16.880 
glue the back side this time this time
I'm<00:07:15.480> using<00:07:15.630> the<00:07:15.900> brush<00:07:16.080> instead<00:07:16.410> of<00:07:16.620> the<00:07:16.710> glue

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:16.890 
I'm using the brush instead of the glue

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:23.690 
I'm using the brush instead of the glue
bottle

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:23.700 

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:26.810 

and<00:07:24.500> I'm<00:07:25.500> going<00:07:25.650> to<00:07:25.680> place<00:07:25.890> it<00:07:25.920> with<00:07:26.310> that<00:07:26.460> gray

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:26.820 
and I'm going to place it with that gray

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:31.700 
and I'm going to place it with that gray
edge<00:07:27.710> on<00:07:28.850> the<00:07:29.850> top<00:07:30.090> because<00:07:30.960> it'll<00:07:31.350> just<00:07:31.560> look

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:31.710 
edge on the top because it'll just look

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:34.850 
edge on the top because it'll just look
better<00:07:31.890> that<00:07:32.070> way<00:07:32.960> the<00:07:33.960> Cascade<00:07:34.440> ramp<00:07:34.680> is

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:34.860 
better that way the Cascade ramp is

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:37.730 
better that way the Cascade ramp is
already<00:07:35.520> white<00:07:35.790> so<00:07:36.510> adding<00:07:37.140> that<00:07:37.260> little<00:07:37.410> gray

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:37.740 
already white so adding that little gray

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:41.060 
already white so adding that little gray
on<00:07:38.040> top<00:07:38.870> is<00:07:39.870> a<00:07:39.900> nice<00:07:40.200> contrast<00:07:40.470> and<00:07:40.890> there<00:07:40.980> you

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:41.070 
on top is a nice contrast and there you

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:42.740 
on top is a nice contrast and there you
can<00:07:41.190> see<00:07:41.220> a<00:07:41.370> close-up<00:07:41.640> of<00:07:41.940> it<00:07:42.090> and<00:07:42.540> here<00:07:42.690> you

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:42.750 
can see a close-up of it and here you

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:44.360 
can see a close-up of it and here you
see<00:07:42.900> wallpaper<00:07:43.140> on<00:07:43.530> the<00:07:43.620> front<00:07:43.860> of<00:07:43.950> it<00:07:44.070> that's

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:44.370 
see wallpaper on the front of it that's

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:52.310 
see wallpaper on the front of it that's
how<00:07:44.520> it<00:07:44.670> looks<00:07:47.690> and<00:07:50.060> here<00:07:51.060> i<00:07:51.210> put<00:07:51.510> wallpaper<00:07:51.750> on

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:52.320 
how it looks and here i put wallpaper on

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:55.990

this<00:07:52.620> zipper<00:07:53.160> ramp<00:07:53.370> I<00:07:53.610> put<00:07:54.390> thin<00:07:54.720> strips<00:07:55.590> a

00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:56.000 
this zipper ramp I put thin strips a

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.600 
this zipper ramp I put thin strips a
much<00:07:57.000> thinner<00:07:57.300> than<00:07:58.220> three-quarters<00:07:59.220> of<00:07:59.400> an

00:07:59.600 --> 00:07:59.610 
much thinner than three-quarters of an

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:02.450 
much thinner than three-quarters of an
inch<00:07:59.730> because<00:08:00.000> the<00:08:00.990> zipper<00:08:01.350> ramp<00:08:01.650> is<00:08:01.920> closed

00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:02.460 
inch because the zipper ramp is closed

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:05.000 
inch because the zipper ramp is closed
together<00:08:02.640> and<00:08:03.120> if<00:08:03.180> I<00:08:03.300> used<00:08:03.600> the<00:08:04.440> three<00:08:04.710> quarter

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:05.010 
together and if I used the three quarter

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:07.160 
together and if I used the three quarter
inch<00:08:05.220> strips<00:08:05.610> it<00:08:05.970> might<00:08:06.480> block<00:08:06.690> the<00:08:06.750> view<00:08:07.140> of

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:07.170 
inch strips it might block the view of

inch strips it might block the view of
the<00:08:07.260> marble<00:08:08.450> ok<00:08:09.450> the<00:08:09.720> next<00:08:09.750> thing<00:08:10.020> I'm<00:08:10.260> going
