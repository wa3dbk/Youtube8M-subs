for the vinyl I just want to let y'all

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.109 
for the vinyl I just want to let y'all
know<00:00:19.529> man<00:00:19.830> this<00:00:20.220> isn't<00:00:20.520> as<00:00:20.609> easy<00:00:20.910> as<00:00:21.029> it

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119

think<00:00:24.930> anyone<00:00:25.439> should<00:00:25.470> attempt<00:00:26.070> wrapping<00:00:26.430> an

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
think anyone should attempt wrapping an

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.880 
think anyone should attempt wrapping an
entire<00:00:26.820> car<00:00:27.180> without<00:00:27.449> experiencing<00:00:28.439> you<00:00:28.859> know

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
entire car without experiencing you know

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.370 
entire car without experiencing you know
training<00:00:29.390> it's<00:00:30.390> actually<00:00:30.840> really<00:00:31.109> harder

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
training it's actually really harder

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.870

than it looks I came across an issue

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.790 
than it looks I came across an issue
when<00:00:35.880> I<00:00:35.910> put<00:00:36.840> on<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:37.110> body<00:00:37.320> kit<00:00:37.590> on<00:00:37.649> the

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
weeks ago two and a half weeks ago so it

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.869 
weeks ago two and a half weeks ago so it
got<00:00:42.989> tarnished<00:00:43.620> in<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:43.890> Sun<00:00:44.129> you<00:00:44.370> can<00:00:44.520> see

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
got tarnished in the Sun you can see

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.840 
got tarnished in the Sun you can see
where<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:46.410> body<00:00:46.680> kit<00:00:46.980> that<00:00:47.190> wasn't<00:00:47.550> installed

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
where the body kit that wasn't installed

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.000 
where the body kit that wasn't installed
on<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.120> car<00:00:48.360> is<00:00:48.629> a<00:00:48.690> different<00:00:49.410> color<00:00:49.620> to

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
on the car is a different color to

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.799 
on the car is a different color to
what's<00:00:50.550> on<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:51.059> car<00:00:51.239> right<00:00:51.420> now

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
what's on the car right now

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.229 
what's on the car right now
apparently<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.770> Sun<00:00:53.070> changes<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.670> color<00:00:53.879> and

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
apparently the Sun changes the color and

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.779 
apparently the Sun changes the color and
now<00:00:55.230> I<00:00:55.260> got<00:00:55.559> to<00:00:55.649> drive<00:00:55.829> around<00:00:56.010> with<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:56.930> half

00:00:58.779 --> 00:00:58.789 
now I got to drive around with a half

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:03.399 
now I got to drive around with a half
orangish<00:00:59.789> half<00:01:00.559> lighter<00:01:01.559> orange<00:01:02.300> until

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:03.409 
orangish half lighter orange until

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:07.130 
orangish half lighter orange until
hopefully<00:01:04.640> the<00:01:05.640> body<00:01:05.880> kit<00:01:06.180> turns<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:06.930> same

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
hopefully the body kit turns to same

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.200 
hopefully the body kit turns to same
color<00:01:07.409> as<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.650> car<00:01:07.860> it's<00:01:08.460> clearly<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.880> Sun
