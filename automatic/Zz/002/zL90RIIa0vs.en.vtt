magical I fell in love the day I hit the

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.150 
magical I fell in love the day I hit the
water<00:00:24.180> when<00:00:24.510> I<00:00:24.599> was<00:00:24.720> 11<00:00:25.140> years<00:00:25.170> old<00:00:25.560> in<00:00:25.740> Hawaii

water when I was 11 years old in Hawaii
every<00:00:27.090> second<00:00:27.539> of<00:00:27.630> my<00:00:27.750> life<00:00:27.779> all<00:00:28.230> I<00:00:28.260> thought

every second of my life all I thought
about<00:00:28.590> was<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:29.699> next<00:00:29.939> surf<00:00:30.210> session<00:00:30.720> how<00:00:31.230> to

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
about was the next surf session how to

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.890 
about was the next surf session how to
get<00:00:31.529> a<00:00:31.560> good<00:00:31.710> board<00:00:32.269> where<00:00:33.269> I<00:00:33.300> was<00:00:33.570> going<00:00:33.720> to<00:00:33.780> go

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:33.900 
get a good board where I was going to go

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.250 
get a good board where I was going to go
sir

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.990 

when<00:00:37.739> you're<00:00:37.860> coming<00:00:38.100> down<00:00:38.220> a<00:00:38.340> giant<00:00:38.670> wave

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
when you're coming down a giant wave

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.420 
when you're coming down a giant wave
here<00:00:39.450> you're<00:00:40.200> going<00:00:40.410> faster<00:00:41.220> than<00:00:41.340> you've

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
here you're going faster than you've

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.420 
here you're going faster than you've
ever<00:00:41.579> gone<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:42.239> then<00:00:42.930> this<00:00:43.200> monsters<00:00:44.040> chasing

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
ever gone and then this monsters chasing

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.780 
ever gone and then this monsters chasing
you<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.840> then<00:00:46.350> there's<00:00:46.590> these<00:00:46.710> giant<00:00:46.790> chops

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:47.790 
you and then there's these giant chops

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.450 
you and then there's these giant chops
and<00:00:48.210> you're<00:00:48.329> hitting<00:00:48.540> them<00:00:48.600> so<00:00:48.840> hard<00:00:49.460> your

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
and you're hitting them so hard your

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.610 
and you're hitting them so hard your
brains<00:00:50.910> getting<00:00:51.329> rattled<00:00:51.540> your<00:00:51.900> bones<00:00:52.320> are

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
brains getting rattled your bones are

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.110 
brains getting rattled your bones are
getting<00:00:52.739> around<00:00:53.100> your<00:00:53.309> whole<00:00:53.460> body's<00:00:53.940> getting

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
getting around your whole body's getting

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.200 
getting around your whole body's getting
valid<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:54.870> for<00:00:55.769> that<00:00:55.890> type<00:00:56.220> of<00:00:56.250> a<00:00:56.489> wave<00:00:56.730> we

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
valid and for that type of a wave we

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.750 
valid and for that type of a wave we
have<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.570> design<00:00:57.930> a<00:00:57.960> special<00:00:58.650> board<00:00:58.860> and<00:00:59.550> this

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
have to design a special board and this

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.180 
have to design a special board and this
board<00:00:59.820> needs<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.930> be<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.440> fastest<00:01:01.949> board

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
board needs to be the fastest board

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.649 
board needs to be the fastest board
you've<00:01:02.309> ever<00:01:02.550> surfed<00:01:03.890> sleek<00:01:04.890> sexy<00:01:05.430> fast<00:01:06.150> board

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
you've ever surfed sleek sexy fast board

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.460 
you've ever surfed sleek sexy fast board
so<00:01:07.560> I<00:01:08.240> can<00:01:09.240> only<00:01:09.539> imagine<00:01:09.840> what<00:01:10.140> it's<00:01:10.289> going<00:01:10.350> to

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
so I can only imagine what it's going to

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:20.270 
so I can only imagine what it's going to
look<00:01:10.530> like

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.090 

it<00:01:20.820> is<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.119> challenge<00:01:21.330> of<00:01:21.720> speed<00:01:22.619> and<00:01:22.920> of

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
it is the challenge of speed and of

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.219 
it is the challenge of speed and of
dynamics<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.760> surfboard<00:01:24.240> is<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:24.450> very<00:01:24.840> pure

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
dynamics the surfboard is a very pure

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.980 
dynamics the surfboard is a very pure
body<00:01:25.590> it's<00:01:26.100> half<00:01:26.340> flying<00:01:26.850> it's<00:01:27.240> floating

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
body it's half flying it's floating

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.440 
body it's half flying it's floating
which<00:01:28.140> makes<00:01:29.070> this<00:01:29.280> board<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:30.060> digitize

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
which makes this board and to digitize

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.700 
which makes this board and to digitize
the<00:01:30.509> board<00:01:30.780> like<00:01:30.930> that<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.259> to<00:01:31.350> work<00:01:31.530> with

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
the board like that and to work with

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:48.230 
the board like that and to work with
poor<00:01:31.950> design<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.310> very<00:01:32.729> special<00:01:33.119> thing

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.450 

we<00:01:48.780> discussed<00:01:49.200> that<00:01:49.440> we<00:01:49.710> had<00:01:50.220> a<00:01:50.250> lot<00:01:50.430> of

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
we discussed that we had a lot of

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.609 
we discussed that we had a lot of
questions<00:01:51.000> what<00:01:51.540> happens<00:01:51.960> to<00:01:52.080> the<00:01:52.200> board<00:01:52.409> what

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
questions what happens to the board what

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:53.630 
questions what happens to the board what
happens<00:01:52.950> to<00:01:53.130> you

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
happens to you

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.370 
happens to you
Garrett<00:01:53.970> when<00:01:54.150> you<00:01:54.330> get<00:01:54.540> hit<00:01:54.810> by<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.080> wave

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
Garrett when you get hit by the wave

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.830 
Garrett when you get hit by the wave
what<00:01:56.159> is<00:01:56.190> the<00:01:56.369> main<00:01:56.640> dynamic<00:01:57.119> moment<00:01:57.300> what's

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
what is the main dynamic moment what's

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.670 
what is the main dynamic moment what's
the<00:01:58.050> maximum<00:01:58.530> speed<00:01:59.010> so<00:01:59.729> we<00:01:59.880> exchanged

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
the maximum speed so we exchanged

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.170 
the maximum speed so we exchanged
aerodynamical<00:02:01.680> water<00:02:02.100> aqua<00:02:02.550> dynamical

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
aerodynamical water aqua dynamical

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.870 
aerodynamical water aqua dynamical
aspects<00:02:04.110> thing<00:02:04.740> that<00:02:04.920> we<00:02:05.040> could<00:02:05.220> perfect<00:02:05.670> on

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
aspects thing that we could perfect on

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.960 
aspects thing that we could perfect on
this<00:02:06.290> is<00:02:07.290> right<00:02:07.979> between<00:02:08.190> here<00:02:08.640> and<00:02:08.670> here

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
this is right between here and here

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.120 
this is right between here and here
we'll<00:02:09.209> make<00:02:09.390> it<00:02:09.420> as<00:02:09.630> stiff<00:02:10.080> as<00:02:10.289> possible<00:02:10.410> like

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
we'll make it as stiff as possible like

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.400 
we'll make it as stiff as possible like
with<00:02:11.400> carbon<00:02:11.819> fiber<00:02:12.060> make<00:02:12.600> it<00:02:12.720> really<00:02:13.170> stiff

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
with carbon fiber make it really stiff

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.380 
with carbon fiber make it really stiff
and<00:02:13.800> then<00:02:14.010> from<00:02:14.250> here<00:02:14.280> for<00:02:14.760> where<00:02:14.970> we<00:02:15.090> make<00:02:15.239> it

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
and then from here for where we make it

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.370 
and then from here for where we make it
really<00:02:15.660> flexi<00:02:16.230> with<00:02:17.180> Kevlar<00:02:18.180> or<00:02:18.630> I<00:02:18.660> don't<00:02:19.200> know

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
really flexi with Kevlar or I don't know

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.949 
really flexi with Kevlar or I don't know
what<00:02:19.500> other<00:02:19.650> materials<00:02:20.280> we<00:02:21.060> got<00:02:21.209> to<00:02:21.330> have<00:02:21.450> flex

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
what other materials we got to have flex

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:23.990 
what other materials we got to have flex
in<00:02:22.200> the<00:02:22.230> nose<00:02:22.500> so<00:02:22.769> when<00:02:22.890> you<00:02:23.010> hit<00:02:23.280> it's<00:02:23.790> a

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
in the nose so when you hit it's a

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.110 
in the nose so when you hit it's a
smoother<00:02:24.540> hit<00:02:25.440> it<00:02:25.739> doesn't<00:02:26.220> shock<00:02:26.760> through

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
smoother hit it doesn't shock through

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.770 
smoother hit it doesn't shock through
your<00:02:27.239> whole<00:02:27.360> body

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
your whole body

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.710 
your whole body
but<00:02:28.380> you've<00:02:28.530> got<00:02:28.680> to<00:02:28.860> change<00:02:29.430> that's<00:02:30.060> a<00:02:30.180> cut<00:02:30.510> a

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
but you've got to change that's a cut a

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.420

cut<00:02:31.050> and<00:02:31.950> um<00:02:33.290> we<00:02:34.290> also<00:02:34.410> want<00:02:34.739> to<00:02:34.800> see<00:02:35.010> how<00:02:35.160> fast

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
cut and um we also want to see how fast

everybody all news reporters people ever

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.090 
everybody all news reporters people ever
how<00:02:39.000> fast<00:02:39.269> you<00:02:39.600> going<00:02:39.810> I<00:02:39.959> don't<00:02:40.530> know<00:02:40.650> I<00:02:40.680> think

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
how fast you going I don't know I think

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.210 
how fast you going I don't know I think
30<00:02:41.459> to<00:02:41.730> 70<00:02:42.150> other<00:02:42.420> I<00:02:42.690> think<00:02:43.220> especially

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
30 to 70 other I think especially

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.550 
30 to 70 other I think especially
extreme<00:02:45.000> wave<00:02:45.330> surfers<00:02:45.870> they<00:02:46.050> have<00:02:46.230> a<00:02:46.260> very

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
extreme wave surfers they have a very

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.140 
extreme wave surfers they have a very
high<00:02:46.800> speed

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
high speed

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.259 
high speed
we<00:02:48.239> asked<00:02:49.099> Garrett<00:02:50.099> just<00:02:50.310> now<00:02:50.579> he<00:02:50.640> doesn't

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
we asked Garrett just now he doesn't

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:53.960 
we asked Garrett just now he doesn't
know<00:02:51.510> exactly<00:02:51.689> but<00:02:52.319> I<00:02:52.379> guess<00:02:52.829> it's<00:02:53.189> somewhere

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
know exactly but I guess it's somewhere

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.839 
know exactly but I guess it's somewhere
around<00:02:54.150> 50<00:02:54.750> 60<00:02:54.780> kilometers<00:02:55.650> an<00:02:55.680> hour<00:02:55.829> and<00:02:56.189> that

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:56.849 
around 50 60 kilometers an hour and that

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:59.929 
around 50 60 kilometers an hour and that
that's<00:02:57.060> be<00:02:57.360> the<00:02:57.659> air<00:02:57.959> resistance<00:02:58.379> is<00:02:58.860> a<00:02:59.400> matter

00:02:59.929 --> 00:02:59.939 
that's be the air resistance is a matter

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:03.500 
that's be the air resistance is a matter
of<00:03:00.060> fact<00:03:00.420> so<00:03:01.260> we<00:03:01.560> can<00:03:02.159> know<00:03:02.579> for<00:03:02.610> example<00:03:02.970> that

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
of fact so we can know for example that

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.979 
of fact so we can know for example that
speed<00:03:03.840> and<00:03:04.400> you<00:03:05.400> can<00:03:05.640> feel<00:03:05.939> the<00:03:06.599> wind

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
speed and you can feel the wind

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:11.059 
speed and you can feel the wind
resistance<00:03:07.280> very<00:03:08.280> precise<00:03:08.879> and<00:03:09.329> can<00:03:10.069> optimize

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
resistance very precise and can optimize

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:13.250 
resistance very precise and can optimize
his<00:03:11.720> then

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
his then

00:03:13.260 --> 00:04:23.900 
his then
