level 7 which is two levels lighter than
my<00:00:52.559> hair<00:00:52.860> because<00:00:53.610> they're<00:00:53.879> my<00:00:54.000> permanent

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
which has been highlighted before so my

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.980 
which has been highlighted before so my
hair<00:01:03.809> is<00:01:03.930> naturally<00:01:04.439> about<00:01:04.979> level<00:01:05.309> 5<00:01:05.869> so<00:01:06.869> I'm

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
hair is naturally about level 5 so I'm

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.880 
hair is naturally about level 5 so I'm
using<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.470> 7<00:01:07.860> I<00:01:08.070> would<00:01:08.729> suggest<00:01:08.939> that<00:01:09.890> to

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
using the 7 I would suggest that to

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.740 
using the 7 I would suggest that to
anyone<00:01:11.490> who's<00:01:12.299> going<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:12.600> use<00:01:12.720> a

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
anyone who's going to use a

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.929 
anyone who's going to use a
demi-permanent<00:01:13.140> color<00:01:13.799> also<00:01:14.670> I<00:01:14.700> would

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
demi-permanent color also I would

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.410 
demi-permanent color also I would
suggest<00:01:15.229> to<00:01:16.229> use<00:01:16.470> one<00:01:17.430> ounce<00:01:17.610> of<00:01:17.790> color<00:01:18.090> and

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
suggest to use one ounce of color and

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.370 
suggest to use one ounce of color and
two<00:01:18.990> ounces<00:01:19.439> of<00:01:19.740> your<00:01:20.610> developer<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:21.450> with

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
two ounces of your developer and with

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.590 
two ounces of your developer and with
any<00:01:22.590> demi-permanent<00:01:23.310> color<00:01:23.790> it'll<00:01:24.240> be<00:01:24.570> a

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
any demi-permanent color it'll be a

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.140 
any demi-permanent color it'll be a
level<00:01:24.930> 10<00:01:25.470> or<00:01:25.710> lower<00:01:26.130> volume<00:01:26.820> developer

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
level 10 or lower volume developer

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.160 
level 10 or lower volume developer
usually<00:01:27.990> this<00:01:28.860> is<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.520> ion<00:01:30.000> sensitive<00:01:30.869> scalp

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
usually this is the ion sensitive scalp

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.950 
usually this is the ion sensitive scalp
developer<00:01:31.740> that<00:01:32.070> goes<00:01:32.310> with<00:01:32.549> that<00:01:32.759> color<00:01:33.060> so

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
developer that goes with that color so

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.960 
developer that goes with that color so
this<00:01:34.259> is<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.530> one<00:01:34.650> that<00:01:34.829> I<00:01:34.860> use<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.579> since<00:01:35.850> it

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
this is the one that I use and since it

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.390 
this is the one that I use and since it
is<00:01:36.090> sensitive<00:01:36.509> scalp<00:01:36.930> it's<00:01:37.740> good<00:01:38.070> for<00:01:38.369> people

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
is sensitive scalp it's good for people

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.039 
is sensitive scalp it's good for people
who<00:01:39.360> might<00:01:39.900> have<00:01:40.909> irritation<00:01:41.909> problems<00:01:42.420> due

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
who might have irritation problems due

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.770 
who might have irritation problems due
to<00:01:43.079> color<00:01:43.430> also<00:01:44.430> this<00:01:44.610> color<00:01:44.880> has<00:01:45.060> no<00:01:45.420> ammonia

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
to color also this color has no ammonia

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.960 
to color also this color has no ammonia
in<00:01:46.110> it<00:01:46.259> so<00:01:46.799> it<00:01:46.920> shouldn't<00:01:47.250> bother<00:01:47.369> you<00:01:47.579> as<00:01:47.759> much

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
in it so it shouldn't bother you as much

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.300 
in it so it shouldn't bother you as much
as<00:01:48.119> permanent<00:01:48.570> hair<00:01:48.780> color<00:01:48.810> if<00:01:49.710> you<00:01:49.890> are<00:01:50.100> going

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
as permanent hair color if you are going

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.130 
as permanent hair color if you are going
to<00:01:50.399> use<00:01:50.520> permanent<00:01:50.850> hair<00:01:51.180> color<00:01:51.210> instead<00:01:51.990> of

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
to use permanent hair color instead of

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.109 
to use permanent hair color instead of
demi-permanent<00:01:52.710> I<00:01:53.100> would<00:01:53.340> suggest<00:01:53.579> using<00:01:53.909> a

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
demi-permanent I would suggest using a

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.810 
demi-permanent I would suggest using a
10<00:01:54.390> volume<00:01:54.570> developer<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:56.210> mix<00:01:57.210> an<00:01:57.570> ounce<00:01:58.200> of

10 volume developer and mix an ounce of
10<00:01:59.820> volume<00:02:00.180> developer<00:02:00.689> and<00:02:01.020> ounce<00:02:01.979> of<00:02:02.369> water

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
10 volume developer and ounce of water

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
and 2 ounces of color that way it

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.499 
and 2 ounces of color that way it
dilutes<00:02:07.170> a<00:02:07.320> little<00:02:07.590> bit<00:02:07.770> and<00:02:08.099> it'll<00:02:09.030> make<00:02:09.300> it

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
dilutes a little bit and it'll make it

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.660 
dilutes a little bit and it'll make it
grab<00:02:09.929> a<00:02:09.959> little<00:02:10.229> bit<00:02:10.470> better<00:02:10.679> like<00:02:11.610> a

a<00:02:15.960> bowl<00:02:16.260> and<00:02:16.440> a<00:02:16.500> brush<00:02:16.740> with<00:02:16.980> this<00:02:17.190> color

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
a bowl and a brush with this color

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.430 
a bowl and a brush with this color
because<00:02:18.120> it<00:02:18.480> is<00:02:18.510> a<00:02:18.660> little<00:02:18.930> bit<00:02:19.050> of<00:02:19.140> a<00:02:19.200> thicker

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
because it is a little bit of a thicker

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.250 
because it is a little bit of a thicker
cream<00:02:19.890> consistency<00:02:20.370> if<00:02:21.060> you're<00:02:21.480> using<00:02:21.720> a<00:02:22.080> more

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
cream consistency if you're using a more

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.470 
cream consistency if you're using a more
liquidy<00:02:22.770> color<00:02:23.010> a<00:02:23.340> bottle<00:02:23.850> will<00:02:23.940> probably<00:02:24.360> be

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
liquidy color a bottle will probably be

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.110 
liquidy color a bottle will probably be
better<00:02:24.660> for<00:02:25.050> you<00:02:25.170> also<00:02:25.860> since<00:02:26.460> I<00:02:26.580> am<00:02:26.730> using<00:02:26.910> a

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
better for you also since I am using a

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.540 
better for you also since I am using a
bowl<00:02:27.330> just<00:02:27.600> a<00:02:28.080> measuring<00:02:28.500> cup<00:02:28.530> to<00:02:29.160> measure<00:02:29.280> out

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
bowl just a measuring cup to measure out

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.240 
bowl just a measuring cup to measure out
the<00:02:29.730> ounces<00:02:30.180> if<00:02:30.570> you're<00:02:31.500> using<00:02:31.710> a<00:02:31.860> bottle

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
the ounces if you're using a bottle

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.730 
the ounces if you're using a bottle
right<00:02:33.000> on<00:02:33.180> the<00:02:33.360> side<00:02:33.570> it'll<00:02:34.170> have<00:02:34.470> your

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
right on the side it'll have your

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.010 
right on the side it'll have your
measurements<00:02:34.920> also<00:02:35.850> just<00:02:36.360> a<00:02:36.480> pair<00:02:36.690> of<00:02:36.780> gloves

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
measurements also just a pair of gloves

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.370 
measurements also just a pair of gloves
and<00:02:37.640> basically<00:02:38.640> I<00:02:38.790> work<00:02:39.180> from<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:39.510> ends<00:02:39.990> to

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
and basically I work from the ends to

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.510 
and basically I work from the ends to
the<00:02:40.500> roots<00:02:41.810> focusing<00:02:42.810> on<00:02:43.170> the<00:02:43.890> parts<00:02:44.280> that

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
the roots focusing on the parts that

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.460 
the roots focusing on the parts that
look<00:02:44.970> the<00:02:45.090> most<00:02:45.270> red<00:02:45.510> which<00:02:45.720> for<00:02:45.960> me<00:02:46.080> is<00:02:46.110> the

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
look the most red which for me is the

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.530 
look the most red which for me is the
top<00:02:46.710> section<00:02:47.310> of<00:02:47.400> my<00:02:47.580> hair<00:02:47.880> because<00:02:48.090> that<00:02:48.270> was

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
top section of my hair because that was

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.170 
top section of my hair because that was
previously<00:02:49.050> highlighted<00:02:49.380> and<00:02:49.860> it<00:02:50.340> was<00:02:50.550> red

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
previously highlighted and it was red

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.440 
previously highlighted and it was red
for<00:02:51.480> a<00:02:51.540> little<00:02:51.780> while<00:02:52.490> so<00:02:53.490> you<00:02:53.970> can't<00:02:54.240> really

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
for a little while so you can't really

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.280 
for a little while so you can't really
tell<00:02:55.040> because<00:02:56.040> my<00:02:56.340> hair<00:02:56.610> is<00:02:56.640> up<00:02:56.970> but<00:02:57.690> I<00:02:57.990> do<00:02:58.050> need

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
to do it over again because the red is

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.570 
to do it over again because the red is
starting<00:03:00.840> to<00:03:00.960> pull<00:03:01.170> through<00:03:01.530> my<00:03:02.040> natural<00:03:02.400> hair

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580
