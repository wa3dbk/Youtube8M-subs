00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.779
 hello then we start with our apple 

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:09.039
 number 5 in this exclusive mind we are going to 

00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:12.549
 learn how to damage our apple in 

00:00:09.039 --> 00:00:14.750
 chocolate to melt or chocolate 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:19.850
 to melt 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:23.670
 is if you bought the boat that is 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:27.330
 coverage for the sides 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.790
 Well, you have to read very well how 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:34.040
 come the instructions how can we 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:36.570
 we melt or melt that chocolate 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:39.210
 because each brand has different 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.449
 ways to do it prepare this 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:45.030
 chocolate for our fruit if you 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:47.520
 they bought the sparkle chocolate that 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:52.280
 was the one that I told them they used 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:56.690
 well, what I do is in a 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:58.810
 boat or cup depending on the amount that 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.090
 I'm going to melt 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:02.990
 and I put it in the microwave for space 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:06.800
 10 seconds 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:10.890
 for example, I put them in the micro of 10 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:13.560
 seconds I take them out and lobato 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.870
 after I already did that if I see that no 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:21.000
 I have fluid left , I put it back in 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:25.020
 microwave another 10 seconds I take it out and 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:29.520
 I beat again and so on until 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:33.300
 my chocolate is liquid if I 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.610
 we do everything in one fell swoop because it 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:38.759
 that we can cause is that we 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:42.240
 burn the chocolate if you do not want it 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:45.869
 do not microwave and you do not have what 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:48.649
 it's the chocolate coverage for ice cream 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.420
 Well then you can do it in a water bath 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:53.369
 nothing else you have to be careful that the 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.670
 mold where you put your 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:58.590
 chocolate is not going to touch the water because 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.179
 otherwise they will have problems 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:05.910
 to be able to get that chocolate to be 

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:08.429
 melt there are people who say that you 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:10.860
 add cooking oil so that it is 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:14.330
 more fluid but be very careful I 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:18.410
 the personal thing I've never done 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:21.400
 the oil is fat is fat and then 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:24.129
 what we are going to do is that 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.670
 it will run easier from our apple and 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:29.860
 that if maybe we throw more 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:32.600
 oil will not be achieved 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:36.050
 stay in our block 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:38.480
 and we will have drained all the 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:41.420
 chocolate in it without having achieved what 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:44.330
 what we wanted then now yes that is 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.820
 optional if you want to use it 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:50.360
 later as I told them I did not have 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:52.250
 used but there are people who me to me 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:57.070
 have commented that that has served them 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:57.070
 to give your chocolate better fluidity 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:04.090
 a jar of chocolate ice cream for 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:07.420
 ice cream more or less reaches about 50 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:10.100
 apples once we have our 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:13.250
 melted chocolate 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:16.310
 what we are going to do is damage our 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:18.440
 apple this technique is the same as the 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:21.680
 of the cycle so remember we have to have 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:24.020
 our chocolate in a glass or in a 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:28.910
 boat that gives us depth because we're going 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:32.660
 to sink to and our apple then the 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:37.960
 technique is straight the apple gets 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:40.360
 sinks straight and is pulled out 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:43.570
 once it is removed we give it small 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:47.140
 taps on the wrist of the hand to 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:49.630
 that the excesses of chocolate fall 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:52.990
 once our apple is already 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:55.660
 bathed smooth completely so good the 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:59.830
 we can decorate myself in this case what 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:02.080
 I did was decorate it with coconut this apple 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:07.480
 with coconut they request it a lot for 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:10.150
 first communions baptisms or in 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.430
 occasions also for weddings but for 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:15.550
 weddings lately it's very fashionable to do 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:17.890
 the design of the bride and groom this design 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:22.840
 I will teach them in the following video 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:27.430
 meanwhile you are going to cover 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:29.680
 three little apples of white color 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.870
 because two of them are going to serve us 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.300
 to make decoration 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:37.270
 sweethearts with white chocolate please 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:41.320
 be very careful because it is 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:44.890
 a chocolate too delicate then 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:47.380
 can easily be burned once 

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:50.320
 we already know the simple and simple technique 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:52.600
 of how to damage our apple in 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:55.090
 good chocolate then from here to 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:58.270
 forward our imagination can fly 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:02.530
 to be able to make many apples of 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:05.940
 different types of design I hope it's from 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:05.940
 your liking until later
