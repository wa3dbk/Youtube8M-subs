00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
first two days of classes the semester

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:05.660 
first two days of classes the semester
were<00:00:04.500> canceled<00:00:04.950> because<00:00:05.040> it's<00:00:05.339> literally

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
were canceled because it's literally

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.400

like<00:00:06.000> negative<00:00:06.390> 20<00:00:06.750> degrees<00:00:06.870> outside<00:00:07.200> right

now<00:00:07.620> so<00:00:08.189> I<00:00:08.250> figured<00:00:08.519> what<00:00:08.670> better<00:00:08.700> way<00:00:08.970> to

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
now so I figured what better way to

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.330 
now so I figured what better way to
celebrate<00:00:09.300> them<00:00:09.660> with<00:00:09.840> a<00:00:09.870> Wi-Fi<00:00:10.380> battle<00:00:10.740> this

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
celebrate them with a Wi-Fi battle this

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.079 
celebrate them with a Wi-Fi battle this
was<00:00:11.490> against<00:00:11.790> clouds<00:00:12.030> liberation<00:00:12.599> and<00:00:12.780> it<00:00:13.559> was

00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:14.089 
was against clouds liberation and it was

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:15.860 
was against clouds liberation and it was
probably<00:00:15.089> one<00:00:15.179> of<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.330> best<00:00:15.420> battles<00:00:15.780> I've

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
probably one of the best battles I've

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.170 
probably one of the best battles I've
had<00:00:16.049> in<00:00:16.230> sex<00:00:16.440> Jen<00:00:16.619> honestly<00:00:17.039> if<00:00:17.220> you'll<00:00:17.640> recall

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
last time we battled was u u and v Jen

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.390 
last time we battled was u u and v Jen
and<00:00:20.699> we<00:00:20.939> ended<00:00:21.570> with<00:00:21.600> an<00:00:21.840> amazing<00:00:22.350> draw<00:00:22.590> it<00:00:22.980> was

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
and we ended with an amazing draw it was

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.130 
and we ended with an amazing draw it was
uh<00:00:23.430> quite<00:00:24.000> unlike<00:00:24.420> anything<00:00:24.660> I've<00:00:24.869> had<00:00:24.990> before

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
uh quite unlike anything I've had before

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.439 
uh quite unlike anything I've had before
so<00:00:25.529> let's<00:00:26.279> see<00:00:26.369> if<00:00:26.430> we<00:00:26.550> can<00:00:26.699> get<00:00:27.060> a<00:00:27.090> game

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
so let's see if we can get a game

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.630 
so let's see if we can get a game
equally<00:00:27.869> as<00:00:27.960> epic<00:00:28.230> this<00:00:28.380> time<00:00:28.560> around<00:00:28.769> lead

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
equally as epic this time around lead

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.669 
equally as epic this time around lead
off<00:00:29.760> with<00:00:30.050> my<00:00:31.050> belief<00:00:31.260> I'd<00:00:31.410> let<00:00:31.560> off<00:00:31.650> with

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
off with my belief I'd let off with

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.400 
off with my belief I'd let off with
kangaskhan<00:00:32.219> and<00:00:32.430> he<00:00:32.489> let<00:00:32.640> off<00:00:32.759> with<00:00:33.410> ariados

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
kangaskhan and he let off with ariados

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.080 
kangaskhan and he let off with ariados
or<00:00:34.590> i<00:00:34.649> probably<00:00:34.860> completely<00:00:35.219> just<00:00:35.850> wasn't

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
or i probably completely just wasn't

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.160 
or i probably completely just wasn't
paying<00:00:36.210> attention<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.540> what<00:00:36.630> i<00:00:36.719> led<00:00:36.870> with<00:00:37.020> but

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
paying attention to what i led with but

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.549 
paying attention to what i led with but
anyway<00:00:37.410> and<00:00:37.590> i<00:00:37.890> bring<00:00:38.100> in<00:00:38.250> medicham<00:00:39.469> kind<00:00:40.469> of

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
anyway and i bring in medicham kind of

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.110 
anyway and i bring in medicham kind of
just<00:00:40.710> thinking<00:00:40.950> it's<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.340> one<00:00:41.730> thing<00:00:41.850> I<00:00:41.969> have

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
just thinking it's the one thing I have

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.549 
just thinking it's the one thing I have
that<00:00:42.270> can<00:00:42.329> do<00:00:42.450> damage<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:42.930> it<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.140> not<00:00:43.260> really

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
that can do damage to it and not really

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.680 
that can do damage to it and not really
worry<00:00:43.800> about<00:00:43.860> any<00:00:44.300> moves<00:00:45.300> he<00:00:45.450> could<00:00:45.600> use

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
worry about any moves he could use

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.810 
worry about any moves he could use
against<00:00:46.050> me<00:00:46.170> I<00:00:46.320> have<00:00:46.920> if<00:00:47.309> you<00:00:47.430> notice<00:00:47.700> I<00:00:47.789> have

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
Tropius because it's really it's really

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.260 
Tropius because it's really it's really
a<00:01:37.530> potent<00:01:38.009> sweeper<00:01:38.340> when<00:01:38.490> it<00:01:38.610> gets<00:01:38.759> set<00:01:38.909> up<00:01:39.060> and

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
a potent sweeper when it gets set up and

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.090 
a potent sweeper when it gets set up and
I'm<00:01:39.689> kind<00:01:40.229> of<00:01:40.290> worried<00:01:40.500> that<00:01:40.590> I<00:01:40.650> don't<00:01:40.920> have<00:01:41.070> a

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
I'm kind of worried that I don't have a

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.620 
I'm kind of worried that I don't have a
whole<00:01:41.280> lot<00:01:41.400> to<00:01:41.430> deal<00:01:41.640> with<00:01:41.670> it<00:01:41.939> on

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
whole lot to deal with it on

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.690 
whole lot to deal with it on
medicham<00:01:43.350> I<00:01:43.649> think<00:01:44.070> it<00:01:44.159> was<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.340> best<00:01:44.460> thing

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
medicham I think it was the best thing

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.030 
medicham I think it was the best thing
to<00:01:44.729> go<00:01:44.909> into<00:01:45.060> because<00:01:45.479> I<00:01:45.720> could<00:01:46.040> potentially

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
to go into because I could potentially

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.340 
to go into because I could potentially
hit<00:01:47.310> him<00:01:47.430> with<00:01:47.520> an<00:01:47.610> ice<00:01:47.729> punch<00:01:48.020> but<00:01:49.020> then<00:01:49.140> I<00:01:49.200> saw

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
hit him with an ice punch but then I saw

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.929 
hit him with an ice punch but then I saw
a<00:01:49.380> dragon<00:01:49.560> dance<00:01:49.829> and<00:01:50.070> so<00:01:50.280> I<00:01:50.490> could<00:01:50.790> definitely

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
a dragon dance and so I could definitely

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.609 
a dragon dance and so I could definitely
can't<00:01:51.360> do<00:01:51.479> anything<00:01:51.720> to<00:01:51.930> him<00:01:52.020> especially

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
can't do anything to him especially

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.910 
can't do anything to him especially
after<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.250> fly<00:01:53.430> I<00:01:53.700> think<00:01:54.509> that<00:01:54.920> really

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
after the fly I think that really

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.380 
after the fly I think that really
medicham<00:01:56.340> is<00:01:56.520> just<00:01:56.790> gonna<00:01:56.909> be<00:01:57.030> useful<00:01:57.149> for

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
medicham is just gonna be useful for

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.870 
medicham is just gonna be useful for
death<00:01:57.540> fodder<00:01:57.780> and<00:01:58.079> so<00:01:58.860> I'm<00:01:59.310> trying<00:01:59.759> to<00:01:59.790> think

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
death fodder and so I'm trying to think

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.429 
death fodder and so I'm trying to think
of<00:02:00.000> what<00:02:00.149> I<00:02:00.180> have<00:02:00.420> to<00:02:00.600> really<00:02:00.869> take<00:02:01.140> out<00:02:01.290> this

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
of what I have to really take out this

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.539 
of what I have to really take out this
Tropius<00:02:01.829> right<00:02:02.040> now<00:02:02.159> and<00:02:02.399> I<00:02:03.090> figured<00:02:04.549> okay

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
Tropius right now and I figured okay

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.700 
Tropius right now and I figured okay
know<00:02:05.969> that<00:02:06.360> I<00:02:06.479> brought<00:02:06.719> in<00:02:06.869> Vaporeon<00:02:07.320> because

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
know that I brought in Vaporeon because

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.380 
know that I brought in Vaporeon because
for<00:02:08.310> some<00:02:08.489> reason<00:02:08.520> I<00:02:08.819> thought<00:02:09.000> I<00:02:09.030> could<00:02:09.239> live<00:02:09.330> a

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
for some reason I thought I could live a

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.780 
for some reason I thought I could live a
leaf<00:02:09.569> blade<00:02:09.810> I<00:02:09.989> just<00:02:10.530> I<00:02:10.830> mean<00:02:11.340> you<00:02:11.550> know<00:02:11.640> it

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
leaf blade I just I mean you know it

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:12.890 
leaf blade I just I mean you know it
took<00:02:11.910> me<00:02:12.090> about<00:02:12.209> half<00:02:12.450> a<00:02:12.569> second

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
took me about half a second

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.569 
took me about half a second
to<00:02:12.959> realize<00:02:13.230> that<00:02:13.409> was<00:02:13.530> utter<00:02:13.709> nonsense<00:02:14.010> so

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:14.579 
to realize that was utter nonsense so

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:16.880 
to realize that was utter nonsense so
that<00:02:15.450> move<00:02:15.870> right<00:02:16.170> there<00:02:16.230> was<00:02:16.560> probably<00:02:16.799> the

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
that move right there was probably the

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.100 
that move right there was probably the
worst<00:02:17.010> move<00:02:17.250> I've<00:02:17.400> made<00:02:17.430> in<00:02:17.819> Hall<00:02:18.000> six<00:02:18.360> gen<00:02:18.569> but

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
worst move I've made in Hall six gen but

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.170 
worst move I've made in Hall six gen but
it's<00:02:19.260> okay<00:02:19.500> we<00:02:19.709> can<00:02:19.829> come<00:02:19.950> back<00:02:20.069> from<00:02:20.220> it<00:02:20.430> you

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
it's okay we can come back from it you

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.479 
it's okay we can come back from it you
know<00:02:21.269> you<00:02:21.420> gotta<00:02:21.599> move<00:02:21.780> on<00:02:21.900> so<00:02:22.260> I<00:02:22.650> bring<00:02:23.220> in<00:02:23.340> a

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
know you gotta move on so I bring in a

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.069 
know you gotta move on so I bring in a
third<00:02:23.879> floor<00:02:23.909> now<00:02:24.239> knowing<00:02:24.629> that<00:02:24.659> I<00:02:24.810> can

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:25.079 
third floor now knowing that I can

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:26.240 
third floor now knowing that I can
absolutely<00:02:25.230> take<00:02:25.530> a<00:02:25.590> leaf<00:02:25.799> blade<00:02:26.040> you<00:02:26.159> know

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
absolutely take a leaf blade you know

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.710 
absolutely take a leaf blade you know
quite<00:02:26.610> the<00:02:26.640> opposite<00:02:27.150> of<00:02:27.239> what<00:02:27.299> happened<00:02:27.659> with

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
quite the opposite of what happened with

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.920 
quite the opposite of what happened with
a<00:02:27.780> Vaporeon<00:02:28.650> and<00:02:29.129> I<00:02:29.939> thundered<00:02:30.480> with<00:02:30.599> him<00:02:30.780> so

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
a Vaporeon and I thundered with him so

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.899 
a Vaporeon and I thundered with him so
that's<00:02:31.079> a<00:02:31.260> really<00:02:31.650> that<00:02:32.340> really<00:02:32.640> helped<00:02:32.819> me

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:32.909 
that's a really that really helped me

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:33.860 
that's a really that really helped me
out<00:02:32.939> that<00:02:33.180> kind<00:02:33.329> of<00:02:33.359> saved<00:02:33.569> me<00:02:33.689> from<00:02:33.780> getting

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
out that kind of saved me from getting

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.589 
out that kind of saved me from getting
swept<00:02:34.290> there<00:02:34.470> and<00:02:35.120> he's<00:02:36.120> probably<00:02:36.359> gonna

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
swept there and he's probably gonna

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:38.509 
swept there and he's probably gonna
bring<00:02:36.840> in<00:02:37.019> his<00:02:37.260> bringing<00:02:38.040> clothes<00:02:38.189> able

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
bring in his bringing clothes able

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:40.819 
bring in his bringing clothes able
because<00:02:39.150> he<00:02:39.359> can<00:02:39.540> Roma<00:02:39.780> therapy<00:02:40.200> and<00:02:40.409> I

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:40.829 
because he can Roma therapy and I

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:42.319 
because he can Roma therapy and I
figured<00:02:41.099> leech<00:02:41.310> seed<00:02:41.489> be<00:02:41.819> the<00:02:41.909> best<00:02:42.120> choice

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:42.329 
figured leech seed be the best choice

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:44.360 
figured leech seed be the best choice
but<00:02:42.750> of<00:02:43.049> magic<00:02:43.439> guards<00:02:43.680> so<00:02:43.859> it's<00:02:44.129> not<00:02:44.250> gonna

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
but of magic guards so it's not gonna

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.550 
but of magic guards so it's not gonna
really<00:02:44.519> help<00:02:44.760> me<00:02:44.849> out<00:02:44.879> that<00:02:45.120> much<00:02:45.299> and<00:02:45.599> I<00:02:45.629> bring

in<00:02:46.650> Kang's<00:02:46.859> gone<00:02:47.010> now<00:02:47.340> thinking<00:02:48.209> that<00:02:48.450> he<00:02:49.200> can

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
in Kang's gone now thinking that he can

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.640 
in Kang's gone now thinking that he can
just<00:02:50.940> kind<00:02:51.480> of<00:02:51.540> hit<00:02:51.840> him<00:02:51.959> with<00:02:52.049> any<00:02:52.200> moves<00:02:52.500> I

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
just kind of hit him with any moves I

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.129 
just kind of hit him with any moves I
have<00:02:52.680> really<00:02:53.129> like<00:02:53.310> I<00:02:53.489> know<00:02:53.790> I'm<00:02:54.000> not<00:02:54.150> mega

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:55.139

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
king is gone but you know I just figured

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.020 
king is gone but you know I just figured
I<00:02:58.019> can<00:02:58.680> do<00:02:58.739> damage<00:02:58.980> to<00:02:59.250> him<00:02:59.370> and<00:02:59.519> I'm<00:02:59.639> not

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
I can do damage to him and I'm not

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.460 
I can do damage to him and I'm not
really<00:03:00.180> worried<00:03:00.510> about<00:03:00.569> losing<00:03:00.900> Kangaskhan

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
really worried about losing Kangaskhan

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.550 
really worried about losing Kangaskhan
because<00:03:02.150> it's<00:03:03.150> not<00:03:03.329> gonna<00:03:03.480> do<00:03:04.049> a<00:03:04.079> whole<00:03:04.290> lot<00:03:04.379> to

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
because it's not gonna do a whole lot to

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.349 
because it's not gonna do a whole lot to
the<00:03:04.650> rest<00:03:04.799> of<00:03:04.859> his<00:03:04.980> team<00:03:05.129> anyway<00:03:05.430> and<00:03:05.790> so<00:03:06.269> I'm

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:06.359 
the rest of his team anyway and so I'm

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:08.000

just have Charizard to go mega now and

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:22.430 
just have Charizard to go mega now and
that's<00:04:20.789> good<00:04:21.029> I<00:04:21.060> tried<00:04:21.690> out<00:04:21.719> like<00:04:22.049> having<00:04:22.349> to

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
that's good I tried out like having to

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.409 
that's good I tried out like having to
Megas<00:04:22.770> on<00:04:22.919> the<00:04:23.010> team<00:04:23.159> just<00:04:23.340> to<00:04:23.729> play<00:04:24.150> like<00:04:24.389> a

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
Megas on the team just to play like a

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:25.530 
Megas on the team just to play like a
sort<00:04:24.690> of<00:04:24.719> a<00:04:24.810> reactionary

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.540 
sort of a reactionary

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.090 
sort of a reactionary
all<00:04:25.600> of<00:04:25.720> them<00:04:25.900> see<00:04:26.110> which<00:04:26.320> mega<00:04:26.560> would<00:04:26.740> be<00:04:26.830> best

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 
all of them see which mega would be best

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.310 
all of them see which mega would be best
to<00:04:27.280> use<00:04:27.310> based<00:04:28.240> on<00:04:28.360> what<00:04:28.510> his<00:04:28.570> team<00:04:28.810> has<00:04:28.990> and<00:04:29.260> I

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320 
to use based on what his team has and I

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.320 
to use based on what his team has and I
think<00:04:29.560> that<00:04:29.710> Charizard<00:04:30.640> will<00:04:30.880> definitely<00:04:31.240> be

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
think that Charizard will definitely be

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.110 
think that Charizard will definitely be
the<00:04:31.450> best<00:04:31.630> one<00:04:31.840> I<00:04:32.650> tried<00:04:33.250> to<00:04:33.400> dragon<00:04:33.880> dance<00:04:34.030> in

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
the best one I tried to dragon dance in

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.700 
the best one I tried to dragon dance in
there<00:04:34.240> without<00:04:34.360> going<00:04:34.660> mega<00:04:34.960> first<00:04:35.230> just<00:04:35.590> in

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
there without going mega first just in

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.200 
there without going mega first just in
case<00:04:35.920> he<00:04:36.100> wanted<00:04:36.400> to<00:04:36.490> stay<00:04:36.670> in<00:04:36.700> and<00:04:36.940> moonblast

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
case he wanted to stay in and moonblast

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.390 
case he wanted to stay in and moonblast
me<00:04:37.540> so<00:04:38.020> I'd<00:04:38.140> take<00:04:38.290> that<00:04:38.350> much<00:04:38.650> less<00:04:38.890> damage<00:04:39.250> but

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
me so I'd take that much less damage but

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.940 
me so I'd take that much less damage but
he<00:04:39.460> just<00:04:39.640> brings<00:04:39.820> in<00:04:39.940> lantern<00:04:40.270> and<00:04:40.480> I<00:04:41.410> didn't

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:41.950 
he just brings in lantern and I didn't

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:00.970 
damage but he did and it was really

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:02.670 
damage but he did and it was really
impressive<00:05:01.510> because<00:05:01.690> I<00:05:01.870> forgot<00:05:02.170> how<00:05:02.320> strong

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680

Ferrothorn<00:05:03.160> is<00:05:03.370> actually<00:05:03.760> and<00:05:04.300> so<00:05:04.450> now<00:05:04.570> he

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:04.660 
Ferrothorn is actually and so now he

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:06.750

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:06.760 
brings in Tropius again and I don't

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.880 
brings in Tropius again and I don't
really<00:05:07.570> think<00:05:07.690> I<00:05:08.020> can<00:05:08.170> do<00:05:08.290> a<00:05:08.320> whole<00:05:08.500> lot<00:05:08.620> to<00:05:08.680> him

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:08.890

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:10.260 
really think I can do a whole lot to him
but<00:05:09.310> the<00:05:09.400> good<00:05:09.550> thing<00:05:09.700> is<00:05:09.790> he<00:05:09.820> can't<00:05:10.150> do<00:05:10.240> a

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.270 
but the good thing is he can't do a

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:11.880 
but the good thing is he can't do a
whole<00:05:10.390> lot<00:05:10.510> to<00:05:10.570> me<00:05:10.810> either<00:05:10.930> so<00:05:11.590> I'll<00:05:11.740> get<00:05:11.860> to

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:11.890 
whole lot to me either so I'll get to

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:13.560 
whole lot to me either so I'll get to
stay<00:05:12.130> in<00:05:12.160> here<00:05:12.400> and<00:05:12.580> whittle<00:05:13.090> down<00:05:13.120> his<00:05:13.390> HP

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.120 
with iron barbs and a rocky helmet and

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:17.880 
with iron barbs and a rocky helmet and
he'll<00:05:16.870> keep<00:05:17.020> getting<00:05:17.290> harvest<00:05:17.650> with<00:05:17.770> the

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:17.890 
he'll keep getting harvest with the

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:19.140 
he'll keep getting harvest with the
berry<00:05:18.100> but<00:05:18.310> that<00:05:18.430> doesn't<00:05:18.640> really<00:05:18.790> bother<00:05:18.940> me

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:19.150 
berry but that doesn't really bother me

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.360 
berry but that doesn't really bother me
too<00:05:19.330> much<00:05:19.360> because<00:05:19.720> I<00:05:20.140> can<00:05:20.710> just<00:05:20.830> Thunder<00:05:21.220> with

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:21.370 
too much because I can just Thunder with

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:24.480 
too much because I can just Thunder with
him<00:05:21.580> and<00:05:21.820> then<00:05:22.770> you<00:05:23.770> know<00:05:23.830> kind<00:05:24.100> of<00:05:24.250> go<00:05:24.340> from

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:24.490 
him and then you know kind of go from

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:25.890 
him and then you know kind of go from
there<00:05:24.700> I'm<00:05:24.880> not<00:05:25.030> really<00:05:25.270> threatened<00:05:25.750> by<00:05:25.840> this

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:25.900 
there I'm not really threatened by this

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:29.520 
there I'm not really threatened by this
Tropius<00:05:26.410> anymore<00:05:26.770> so<00:05:27.450> he<00:05:28.450> brings<00:05:28.660> in<00:05:28.810> clefable

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:29.530 
Tropius anymore so he brings in clefable

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:32.880 
Tropius anymore so he brings in clefable
again<00:05:29.860> obviously<00:05:30.370> to<00:05:30.580> go<00:05:30.820> for<00:05:31.890> the

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:32.890 
again obviously to go for the

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:34.980 
again obviously to go for the
aromatherapy<00:05:33.190> and<00:05:33.760> I<00:05:34.330> Thunder<00:05:34.600> wave<00:05:34.720> again

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:34.990 
aromatherapy and I Thunder wave again

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:36.510 
aromatherapy and I Thunder wave again
knowing<00:05:35.200> he'd<00:05:35.440> probably<00:05:35.620> switch<00:05:36.010> and<00:05:36.250> this

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:36.520 
knowing he'd probably switch and this

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.730 
knowing he'd probably switch and this
way<00:05:36.700> I<00:05:36.730> can<00:05:37.000> at<00:05:37.120> least<00:05:37.150> get<00:05:37.510> the<00:05:37.540> 25%<00:05:38.530> chance

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:38.740 
way I can at least get the 25% chance

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:40.310 
way I can at least get the 25% chance
paralysis<00:05:39.400> on<00:05:39.550> him<00:05:39.760> even<00:05:39.850> though<00:05:40.030> it<00:05:40.090> won't

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:40.320 
paralysis on him even though it won't

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.230 
paralysis on him even though it won't
you<00:05:41.320> know<00:05:41.350> it's<00:05:41.770> not<00:05:41.860> going<00:05:41.980> no<00:05:42.700> magic<00:05:43.090> guard

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:43.240 
you know it's not going no magic guard

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.780 
you know it's not going no magic guard
doesn't<00:05:43.420> stop<00:05:43.660> that<00:05:43.900> at<00:05:44.050> least<00:05:44.200> so

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:44.790 
doesn't stop that at least so

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:46.530 
doesn't stop that at least so
aromatherapy<00:05:45.790> I<00:05:45.820> knew<00:05:46.030> he<00:05:46.150> was<00:05:46.270> going<00:05:46.390> to<00:05:46.450> do

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:46.540 
aromatherapy I knew he was going to do

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:48.030 
aromatherapy I knew he was going to do
that<00:05:46.570> and<00:05:46.930> I<00:05:46.990> power<00:05:47.290> whip<00:05:47.470> just<00:05:47.680> to<00:05:47.770> see<00:05:47.920> how

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:48.040 
that and I power whip just to see how

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.040 
that and I power whip just to see how
much<00:05:48.160> it'll<00:05:48.400> do<00:05:48.580> and<00:05:49.060> it<00:05:49.510> wants<00:05:49.690> him<00:05:49.780> doing<00:05:49.960> a

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:50.050 
much it'll do and it wants him doing a

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:52.200 
much it'll do and it wants him doing a
good<00:05:50.380> amount<00:05:50.710> to<00:05:50.770> him<00:05:50.950> I<00:05:51.040> guess<00:05:51.100> enough<00:05:52.060> to

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:52.210 
good amount to him I guess enough to

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:54.270 
good amount to him I guess enough to
make<00:05:52.390> him<00:05:52.540> probably<00:05:52.900> want<00:05:53.050> to<00:05:53.140> heal<00:05:53.350> up<00:05:53.620> or<00:05:54.160> at

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:54.280 
make him probably want to heal up or at

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:55.620 
make him probably want to heal up or at
the<00:05:54.370> very<00:05:54.400> least<00:05:54.700> switch<00:05:54.910> out<00:05:55.120> oh<00:05:55.270> never<00:05:55.540> mind

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:55.630 
the very least switch out oh never mind

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:57.570 
the very least switch out oh never mind
he<00:05:55.900> outspeeds<00:05:56.530> me<00:05:56.650> in<00:05:56.710> flamethrowers<00:05:57.190> so<00:05:57.400> I

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:57.580 
he outspeeds me in flamethrowers so I

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:59.100 
he outspeeds me in flamethrowers so I
guess<00:05:57.970> that's<00:05:58.120> the<00:05:58.210> one<00:05:58.480> solution<00:05:58.750> to<00:05:58.990> the

00:05:59.100 --> 00:05:59.110 
guess that's the one solution to the

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:02.640 
guess that's the one solution to the
problem<00:05:59.500> so<00:06:00.460> down<00:06:00.640> goes<00:06:00.820> Ferrothorn<00:06:01.240> and<00:06:01.650> I

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:02.650 
problem so down goes Ferrothorn and I

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:06.600 
problem so down goes Ferrothorn and I
kind<00:06:03.580> of<00:06:03.700> think<00:06:04.290> at<00:06:05.290> this<00:06:05.410> point<00:06:05.590> I<00:06:06.190> have<00:06:06.580> a

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:06.610 
kind of think at this point I have a

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:08.310 
kind of think at this point I have a
chance<00:06:06.880> to<00:06:07.030> sweep<00:06:07.210> with<00:06:07.420> Charizard<00:06:07.870> it's<00:06:08.080> kind

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:08.320 
chance to sweep with Charizard it's kind

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:09.930 
chance to sweep with Charizard it's kind
of<00:06:08.350> like<00:06:08.500> the<00:06:08.620> last<00:06:08.980> chance<00:06:09.250> I<00:06:09.370> have<00:06:09.580> I<00:06:09.700> think

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:09.940 
of like the last chance I have I think

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:11.490 
of like the last chance I have I think
Charizard<00:06:10.270> the<00:06:10.390> only<00:06:10.660> guy<00:06:10.810> I<00:06:10.840> have<00:06:11.080> left<00:06:11.320> and

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:11.500 
Charizard the only guy I have left and

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.250

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:28.870 
the ropes here and so he moonblast me

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:30.900 
the ropes here and so he moonblast me
doesn't<00:06:29.200> do<00:06:29.320> a<00:06:29.560> whole<00:06:29.980> lot<00:06:30.310> because<00:06:30.490> I'm<00:06:30.700> still

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:30.910 
doesn't do a whole lot because I'm still

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:33.030 
doesn't do a whole lot because I'm still
you<00:06:31.000> know<00:06:31.030> apart<00:06:31.330> fire<00:06:31.540> so<00:06:31.930> it's<00:06:32.590> only<00:06:32.710> neutral

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:33.040 
you know apart fire so it's only neutral

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:34.470 
you know apart fire so it's only neutral
damage<00:06:33.400> and<00:06:33.550> I<00:06:33.640> kill<00:06:33.910> him<00:06:34.030> with<00:06:34.060> the<00:06:34.300> flare

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:34.480

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:55.300 
greninja and I was really worried that

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:57.180 
greninja and I was really worried that
he'd<00:06:55.540> get<00:06:55.660> like<00:06:55.870> Max<00:06:56.200> hits<00:06:56.470> on<00:06:56.680> the<00:06:56.860> water

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:57.190

of mechanics to flare blitz like and
dying<00:07:13.390> to<00:07:13.540> recoil<00:07:13.900> I<00:07:14.170> guess<00:07:14.590> any<00:07:14.740> recoil<00:07:15.070> move

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:15.250 
dying to recoil I guess any recoil move

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:16.890 
dying to recoil I guess any recoil move
in<00:07:15.370> general<00:07:15.700> if<00:07:15.820> you<00:07:15.850> died<00:07:16.120> a<00:07:16.150> recoil<00:07:16.570> it<00:07:16.690> still

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:16.900 
in general if you died a recoil it still

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:18.390 
in general if you died a recoil it still
counts<00:07:17.170> as<00:07:17.230> you<00:07:17.380> winning<00:07:17.770> so<00:07:17.890> I<00:07:17.950> go<00:07:18.160> for<00:07:18.310> the

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:18.400 
counts as you winning so I go for the

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.640 
counts as you winning so I go for the
flare<00:07:18.610> blitz<00:07:18.820> just<00:07:19.120> to<00:07:19.210> be<00:07:19.300> awesome<00:07:19.480> and<00:07:19.930> you

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:20.650 
flare blitz just to be awesome and you

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:22.290 
flare blitz just to be awesome and you
know<00:07:20.680> I<00:07:20.770> go<00:07:21.040> down<00:07:21.250> he<00:07:21.460> goes<00:07:21.640> down<00:07:21.880> but<00:07:22.090> the<00:07:22.150> game

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:22.300 
know I go down he goes down but the game

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:23.880 
know I go down he goes down but the game
still<00:07:22.510> counted<00:07:22.870> as<00:07:22.990> a<00:07:23.080> win<00:07:23.260> for<00:07:23.470> me<00:07:23.560> excited

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:23.890 
still counted as a win for me excited

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:25.230 
still counted as a win for me excited
Stein<00:07:24.070> to<00:07:24.190> recoil<00:07:24.460> so<00:07:24.640> that<00:07:24.790> was<00:07:24.910> freaking

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:25.240 
Stein to recoil so that was freaking

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:26.120

technically<00:07:27.130> a<00:07:27.220> draw<00:07:27.490> I<00:07:27.520> guess<00:07:27.790> but<00:07:28.030> I<00:07:28.090> kind<00:07:28.600> of

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:28.690 
technically a draw I guess but I kind of

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:30.390 
technically a draw I guess but I kind of
won<00:07:28.870> so<00:07:29.230> it's<00:07:29.380> like<00:07:29.530> you<00:07:29.650> know<00:07:29.770> whatever<00:07:30.040> the

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:30.400 
won so it's like you know whatever the

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:32.100 
won so it's like you know whatever the
game<00:07:30.550> said<00:07:30.760> I<00:07:30.790> won<00:07:31.030> but<00:07:31.210> in<00:07:31.420> my<00:07:31.750> mind<00:07:31.960> it<00:07:32.080> was

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:32.110 
game said I won but in my mind it was

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:33.630 
game said I won but in my mind it was
the<00:07:32.200> draw<00:07:32.410> because<00:07:32.620> that<00:07:32.950> continued<00:07:33.370> on<00:07:33.430> with

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:33.640 
the draw because that continued on with

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:36.240 
the draw because that continued on with
the<00:07:33.850> epic<00:07:34.810> streak<00:07:35.080> that<00:07:35.260> clouds<00:07:35.830> and<00:07:36.010> I<00:07:36.070> have

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:36.250 
the epic streak that clouds and I have

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:37.740 
the epic streak that clouds and I have
of<00:07:36.430> getting<00:07:36.460> draws<00:07:36.970> in<00:07:37.150> our<00:07:37.240> games<00:07:37.420> so<00:07:37.570> that

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:37.750 
of getting draws in our games so that

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:38.550 
of getting draws in our games so that
was<00:07:37.840> really<00:07:38.170> awesome
