concentration but overall I would say

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.580 
concentration but overall I would say
hard-working<00:00:19.030> high<00:00:20.030> energy<00:00:20.630> level<00:00:21.080> were

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:21.590 
hard-working high energy level were

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.700 
hard-working high energy level were
great<00:00:22.630> some<00:00:23.630> unforced<00:00:24.140> errors<00:00:24.440> in<00:00:24.590> our

great some unforced errors in our
passing<00:00:25.190> game<00:00:25.220> the<00:00:25.520> attacking<00:00:25.850> game<00:00:26.150> as<00:00:26.300> we

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:26.450 
passing game the attacking game as we

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:28.840 
passing game the attacking game as we
defend<00:00:26.900> very<00:00:27.140> well<00:00:27.380> once<00:00:28.040> again<00:00:28.250> is<00:00:28.550> with<00:00:28.730> it

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:28.850 
defend very well once again is with it

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.290 
defend very well once again is with it
against<00:00:29.120> CSKA<00:00:29.660> so<00:00:30.070> those<00:00:31.070> absorbs<00:00:31.760> good<00:00:31.940> sango

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300 
against CSKA so those absorbs good sango

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.780 
against CSKA so those absorbs good sango
and<00:00:32.480> even<00:00:32.780> if<00:00:32.899> it's<00:00:33.110> only<00:00:33.289> friendly<00:00:33.860> I<00:00:34.280> think

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:34.790 
and even if it's only friendly I think

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.750 
and even if it's only friendly I think
it<00:00:34.880> was<00:00:34.940> a<00:00:35.000> vision<00:00:35.450> exercise<00:00:36.020> hey<00:00:36.380> I<00:00:37.190> think<00:00:37.610> we

all<00:00:54.320> today<00:00:54.500> it's<00:00:55.370> a<00:00:55.520> little<00:00:55.579> bit<00:00:55.760> too<00:00:56.350> too

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
all today it's a little bit too too

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.580 
all today it's a little bit too too
short<00:00:57.620> time<00:00:57.860> because<00:00:58.190> this<00:00:58.430> pitch<00:00:59.000> was<00:00:59.180> also<00:00:59.600> a

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:00.590 
short time because this pitch was also a

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.520 
short time because this pitch was also a
little<00:01:01.070> bit<00:01:01.190> bumping<00:01:01.820> await<00:01:02.059> was<00:01:02.530> difficult

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
little bit bumping await was difficult

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.200 
little bit bumping await was difficult
to<00:01:03.559> control<00:01:03.890> the<00:01:04.129> ball<00:01:04.369> and<00:01:04.640> get<00:01:04.729> hold<00:01:04.939> of<00:01:05.089> the

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
to control the ball and get hold of the

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.770 
to control the ball and get hold of the
ball<00:01:05.390> so<00:01:05.870> it<00:01:06.170> was<00:01:06.979> more<00:01:07.190> of<00:01:07.250> a<00:01:07.780> hard-working

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
ball so it was more of a hard-working

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.560 
ball so it was more of a hard-working
game<00:01:08.960> I<00:01:08.990> would<00:01:09.350> say<00:01:09.590> so<00:01:09.650> I<00:01:09.979> think<00:01:10.570> its

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
game I would say so I think its

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.289 
game I would say so I think its
difficulty<00:01:12.170> that<00:01:12.290> you<00:01:12.680> can<00:01:12.830> see<00:01:13.299> improvement

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:14.299 
difficulty that you can see improvement

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:16.810 
difficulty that you can see improvement
development<00:01:14.900> when<00:01:15.080> you<00:01:15.200> play<00:01:15.440> the<00:01:16.190> first<00:01:16.580> we

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
development when you play the first we

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.460 
development when you play the first we
play<00:01:17.119> money<00:01:17.360> again<00:01:17.720> it's<00:01:17.900> more<00:01:18.140> in<00:01:18.260> the<00:01:18.320> way<00:01:18.440> a

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
play money again it's more in the way a

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.250 
play money again it's more in the way a
training<00:01:19.430> camp<00:01:19.640> ticket<00:01:20.000> field<00:01:20.240> I<00:01:20.570> think<00:01:21.140> it's

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:21.260 
training camp ticket field I think it's

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:22.600 
training camp ticket field I think it's
too<00:01:21.409> early<00:01:21.470> there's<00:01:21.950> a<00:01:21.979> lot<00:01:22.220> of<00:01:22.250> you<00:01:22.549> know

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
too early there's a lot of you know

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.280 
too early there's a lot of you know
information<00:01:23.390> going<00:01:23.540> on<00:01:23.720> right<00:01:23.900> now<00:01:23.930> for

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
information going on right now for

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.770 
information going on right now for
everybody<00:01:24.710> hey<00:01:25.040> I<00:01:25.070> think<00:01:25.909> everyone<00:01:26.420> is<00:01:26.570> under

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
everybody hey I think everyone is under

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.350 
everybody hey I think everyone is under
evaluation<00:01:26.990> by<00:01:27.590> the<00:01:27.650> coaching<00:01:28.280> stuff<00:01:28.610> I'm

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
evaluation by the coaching stuff I'm

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.120 
evaluation by the coaching stuff I'm
sure<00:01:29.630> he's<00:01:29.869> you<00:01:30.170> know<00:01:30.200> that's<00:01:30.830> what<00:01:30.979> he's

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
sure he's you know that's what he's

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.190 
sure he's you know that's what he's
changing<00:01:31.549> formation<00:01:32.060> trying<00:01:32.479> to<00:01:32.689> people<00:01:32.960> here

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
changing formation trying to people here

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.730 
changing formation trying to people here
and<00:01:33.409> then<00:01:33.560> and<00:01:33.909> then<00:01:34.909> I<00:01:35.479> think<00:01:36.350> little<00:01:36.590> but

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
and then and then I think little but

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.410 
and then and then I think little but
little<00:01:37.010> ways<00:01:37.250> we're<00:01:37.549> gonna<00:01:37.729> start<00:01:38.030> you<00:01:38.330> know

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
little ways we're gonna start you know

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.120 
little ways we're gonna start you know
he's<00:01:38.720> gonna<00:01:38.930> start<00:01:39.200> shaping<00:01:39.590> the<00:01:39.680> team<00:01:39.890> you

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
he's gonna start shaping the team you

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:41.710 
he's gonna start shaping the team you
know<00:01:40.250> deciding<00:01:40.790> which<00:01:40.909> we<00:01:41.090> are<00:01:41.270> gonna<00:01:41.420> be<00:01:41.540> here

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
know deciding which we are gonna be here

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.300 
know deciding which we are gonna be here
which<00:01:42.020> we<00:01:42.170> are<00:01:42.380> not<00:01:42.500> going<00:01:42.680> to<00:01:42.770> be<00:01:42.830> here<00:01:43.130> and

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
which we are not going to be here and

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.429 
which we are not going to be here and
then<00:01:44.119> but<00:01:44.509> I<00:01:44.540> think<00:01:44.810> in<00:01:44.869> terms<00:01:44.990> of<00:01:45.229> you<00:01:45.409> know

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:45.439 
then but I think in terms of you know

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:48.280 
then but I think in terms of you know
what<00:01:45.740> he<00:01:45.890> pretends<00:01:46.729> and<00:01:47.330> the<00:01:47.570> way<00:01:47.720> he<00:01:47.840> wants<00:01:48.229> to

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
what he pretends and the way he wants to

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.070 
what he pretends and the way he wants to
