00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.540
 welcome to pickup 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:10.610
 com 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.070
 Today want to show how to do it again 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.679
 on a car 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:18.220
 after a bully a world adhesive 

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:20.470
 have written wet glue as an aid 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.520
 us here only once a few fans lines 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.050
 raised 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.900
 so that we can do the writing too 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:30.939
 We also have the logo to place 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:37.000
 already placed and with a strip 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:40.120
 readable tesa fixed above by this 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.730
 fixation can fold here concerns 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:47.770
 peel off and glue the show like 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:51.340
 always first we turn 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:57.730
 once over and remove our font 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:01:00.910
 The carrier paper here they pull that 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:04.210
 carrier paper 180 degrees to one side 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:06.460
 very carefully so that the adhesive 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:09.729
 Letters and the motive on the 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:12.520
 transfer paper will stay in the next 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:15.250
 step you prepare with the preparation 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:19.590
 spray bottle and the water additive the 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:21.939
 font and the paint once full wet 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.390
 we're referring very quickly 

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:24.390
 line off 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:34.500
 so we take the second lettering 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.500
 also directly in front 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.149
 Here too we feel everything beautiful and 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.490
 fold indirectly 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:59.700
 with increased pressure is now used by the 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:05.090
 out to the outside the water between 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.090
 Outstanding film and body 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:18.720
 The next one also works for us 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:22.380
 fix it down once 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:25.580
 and now to the page a lot of pressure that 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.580
 standing out 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:43.370
 so in the next step we remove on 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.330
 best still fast the tesa or 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.489
 christ 4 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.920
 depending on what you are for a paper 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:51.190
 this could use glue residue 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:55.310
 to let 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:57.680
 so now you spray the transfer paper 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:02.750
 with your water application solutions 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:05.690
 once wet and advise the water 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:08.110
 once very gently into the transfer paper 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.110
 in 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:23.030
 this layer of water is now used to 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:25.640
 glue the transfer paper easily on 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.830
 let solve the whole spawning season 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:30.310
 Up here you can fold a little bit 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.310
 to trick 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:39.170
 And now they are spraying this fold too 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:43.820
 again slightly water respectively 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:45.230
 your application solution so that whole 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:47.870
 let them now a bit of a man who 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.760
 does not have to position exactly 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.900
 you can also proceed as follows 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.769
 we remove 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.430
 first again the carrier paper from the 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:57.380
 foil 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.480
 please do it on a straight line 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:04.630
 surface , they also move back to 180 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.630
 grad the carrier paper off 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:15.130
 Now let's take a quick look at ours 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:18.220
 template where we go we have to spray 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:21.010
 the writing from the sticky side with 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.810
 our application solutions us and all 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:27.360
 important again the paint surface at the 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.360
 place where the writing should lie 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.400
 through the water film they now have the 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:38.340
 possibility the writing out and 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:38.340
 move it before you fix it 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:50.220
 Thanks for being okay with the 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:52.020
 position of writing are satisfied 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:55.530
 please start again in the middle 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:05:00.380
 and squeeze the water with strong pressure 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:00.380
 between the adhesive film and the body 

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:18.659
 Here too we make the transfer paper 

00:05:15.089 --> 00:05:27.989
 Widerersachers and squeegee the water film 

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:32.969
 easy and let the whole good one 

00:05:27.989 --> 00:05:35.789
 allowed to represent the vines so writings 

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:38.099
 since the water was already on the 

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:43.049
 transfer paper and then pull 

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:46.259
 we follow the slide from above very slowly 

00:05:43.049 --> 00:05:48.059
 Down this can be done in one piece 

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:49.919
 make big letters in small ones 

00:05:48.059 --> 00:05:50.729
 Please write in several pieces 

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:52.669
 pull it off 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:58.279
 the second was already finished 

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:58.279
 remove slowly and carefully 

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:06.370
 The residual moisture is now easy with 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.350
 a cloth removed by plucking on 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:12.570
 Best of all, watch out for them 

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:12.570
 do not move letters or motifs 

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:31.310
 with deep beads and edges they have to 

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:34.250
 to take a hot air dryer to help 

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:35.150
 put the foil in the bag or edge 

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:37.010
 and a hair dryer 

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:39.229
 how that works exactly we can 

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:41.660
 like in another video or one 

00:06:39.229 --> 00:06:43.160
 We betrayed our training I hope we 

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:45.260
 could him with this video something 

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:47.479
 should help second question 

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.370
 have a choice of films or should they 

00:06:47.479 --> 00:06:50.389
 a wish regarding 

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:52.720
 vehicle lettering can have the 

00:06:50.389 --> 00:06:54.380
 sawing swirls are for you 

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:56.330
 on the road throughout Europe 

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:57.950
 Thank you for your attention and 

00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:01.389
 say until next time 

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:01.389
 comes with self- love examination
