the throttle like that and then the half

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:58.649 
the throttle like that and then the half
grip<00:01:51.940> comes<00:01:52.180> on<00:01:52.420> like<00:01:52.630> that

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:58.659 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:03.300 

to<00:01:59.499> install<00:01:59.979> the<00:02:00.310> throttle<00:02:00.729> like<00:02:01.569> this<00:02:02.310> we

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
to install the throttle like this we

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.340 
to install the throttle like this we
need<00:02:03.670> to<00:02:03.789> know<00:02:03.819> where<00:02:04.659> the<00:02:04.929> throttle<00:02:05.140> is

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
need to know where the throttle is

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.889 
need to know where the throttle is
plugged<00:02:05.619> into<00:02:05.829> and<00:02:06.420> goes<00:02:07.420> into<00:02:07.719> this

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:07.899 
plugged into and goes into this

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:10.740 
plugged into and goes into this
distribution<00:02:08.739> box<00:02:08.950> if<00:02:09.310> you<00:02:09.369> follow<00:02:09.610> the<00:02:09.879> cable

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
distribution box if you follow the cable

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.869 
distribution box if you follow the cable
down<00:02:10.929> and<00:02:13.470> you'll<00:02:14.470> see<00:02:14.769> if<00:02:15.040> we<00:02:15.310> take<00:02:15.549> you

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:15.879 
down and you'll see if we take you

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:18.240 
down and you'll see if we take you
unscrew<00:02:16.180> four<00:02:16.599> screws<00:02:17.019> from<00:02:17.319> from<00:02:17.950> the<00:02:18.069> back

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
unscrew four screws from from the back

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.400 
unscrew four screws from from the back
here<00:02:18.519> these<00:02:18.849> four<00:02:19.180> screws<00:02:19.540> you<00:02:19.690> unscrew<00:02:20.049> them

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
here these four screws you unscrew them

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:26.220 
here these four screws you unscrew them
and<00:02:22.140> then<00:02:23.140> you<00:02:23.470> can<00:02:23.650> see<00:02:23.950> that<00:02:23.980> the<00:02:25.230> throttle

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
and then you can see that the throttle

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:31.580 
and then you can see that the throttle
the<00:02:26.470> throttle<00:02:27.400> lead<00:02:29.160> actually<00:02:30.160> goes<00:02:30.400> into

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
the throttle lead actually goes into

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.680 
the throttle lead actually goes into
this<00:02:32.590> spot<00:02:33.010> here<00:02:33.310> this<00:02:33.849> is<00:02:34.030> the<00:02:34.180> throttle<00:02:34.390> leg

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
this spot here this is the throttle leg

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.940 
this spot here this is the throttle leg
coming<00:02:35.079> in<00:02:35.170> here<00:02:36.090> so<00:02:37.090> it's<00:02:38.079> just<00:02:38.290> a<00:02:38.709> matter<00:02:38.860> of

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
coming in here so it's just a matter of

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.440 
coming in here so it's just a matter of
matter<00:02:39.430> of<00:02:39.750> connecting<00:02:40.750> that<00:02:41.200> and<00:02:42.450> putting

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
matter of connecting that and putting

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:49.670 
matter of connecting that and putting
the<00:02:43.629> that<00:02:44.290> lead<00:02:44.530> in<00:02:44.769> like<00:02:45.069> so<00:02:45.810> into<00:02:46.810> that<00:02:46.959> spot

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:59.620 

that's<00:02:50.680> the<00:02:50.890> connector

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:13.850 

you

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.680 

and<00:03:14.460> now<00:03:15.120> you'll<00:03:15.540> see<00:03:15.630> that<00:03:16.080> the<00:03:16.740> plug<00:03:17.010> has<00:03:17.280> got

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
and now you'll see that the plug has got

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.860 
and now you'll see that the plug has got
red<00:03:18.830> red<00:03:19.830> white<00:03:20.340> and<00:03:20.640> black<00:03:20.910> wires<00:03:21.270> and<00:03:21.720> the

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
red red white and black wires and the

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.320 
red red white and black wires and the
watt<00:03:22.050> white<00:03:22.350> wires<00:03:22.650> in<00:03:22.890> the<00:03:22.980> center<00:03:23.400> and<00:03:24.120> this

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
watt white wires in the center and this

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.650 
watt white wires in the center and this
plug<00:03:24.660> has<00:03:24.900> got<00:03:25.280> red<00:03:26.280> white<00:03:26.910> and<00:03:27.120> black<00:03:27.300> and<00:03:27.600> the

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
plug has got red white and black and the

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.450 
plug has got red white and black and the
white<00:03:27.930> lies<00:03:28.170> in<00:03:28.380> the<00:03:28.500> center<00:03:28.800> so<00:03:29.250> they're

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:29.460 
white lies in the center so they're

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:30.560 
white lies in the center so they're
obviously<00:03:29.850> the<00:03:29.940> ones<00:03:30.150> that<00:03:30.300> have<00:03:30.420> to<00:03:30.540> be

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
obviously the ones that have to be

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:33.560 
obviously the ones that have to be
plugged<00:03:30.810> together<00:03:30.990> and<00:03:31.640> the<00:03:32.640> red<00:03:32.820> side<00:03:33.330> of

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
plugged together and the red side of

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.570 
plugged together and the red side of
wire<00:03:33.780> goes<00:03:34.080> onto<00:03:34.350> the<00:03:34.440> red<00:03:34.620> side<00:03:34.890> wire<00:03:35.190> there

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
wire goes onto the red side wire there

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.690 
wire goes onto the red side wire there
so<00:03:36.240> plugs<00:03:36.810> that<00:03:36.900> way<00:03:37.200> and<00:03:37.470> the<00:03:38.190> little<00:03:38.430> clip

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
so plugs that way and the little clip

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.010 
so plugs that way and the little clip
clips<00:03:39.690> on<00:03:39.900> to<00:03:40.110> that<00:03:40.890> little<00:03:41.160> notch<00:03:41.430> there<00:03:42.020> and

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:43.020 
clips on to that little notch there and

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.490 
clips on to that little notch there and
and<00:03:43.800> then<00:03:44.310> just<00:03:44.940> simply<00:03:45.300> reassemble<00:03:46.260> it<00:03:46.380> and

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
and then just simply reassemble it and

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.860 
and then just simply reassemble it and
screw<00:03:47.400> this<00:03:47.550> triangle<00:03:48.060> back<00:03:48.360> together<00:03:48.570> again

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
screw this triangle back together again

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.610 
screw this triangle back together again
the<00:03:49.140> distribution<00:03:49.680> box<00:03:50.190> and<00:03:51.470> test<00:03:52.470> your

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
the distribution box and test your

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.500 
the distribution box and test your
throttle<00:03:52.980> your<00:03:53.550> testers<00:03:53.910> rubble<00:03:54.209> by<00:03:54.300> just

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
throttle your testers rubble by just

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.660 
throttle your testers rubble by just
leaning<00:03:54.840> the<00:03:54.900> bike<00:03:54.930> over<00:03:55.530> onto<00:03:56.220> the<00:03:56.340> stand

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
leaning the bike over onto the stand

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.120 
leaning the bike over onto the stand
like<00:03:57.060> that<00:03:57.090> and<00:03:57.630> that<00:03:58.230> gives<00:03:58.440> the<00:03:58.709> rear<00:03:58.890> wheel

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
like that and that gives the rear wheel

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:00.320 
like that and that gives the rear wheel
off<00:03:59.160> the<00:03:59.400> ground<00:03:59.640> and<00:03:59.790> you<00:03:59.880> can<00:03:59.910> just<00:04:00.180> twist

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 
off the ground and you can just twist

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.150 
off the ground and you can just twist
the<00:04:00.540> throttle<00:04:00.720> but<00:04:01.530> you<00:04:01.709> have<00:04:01.860> to<00:04:01.980> make<00:04:02.130> sure

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
the throttle but you have to make sure

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.600 
the throttle but you have to make sure
that<00:04:02.670> the<00:04:02.910> red<00:04:03.600> button<00:04:04.050> this<00:04:04.620> red<00:04:04.920> button<00:04:05.130> here

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
that the red button this red button here

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:09.770 
that the red button this red button here
is<00:04:06.150> in<00:04:06.600> to<00:04:07.350> make<00:04:07.530> the<00:04:07.940> throttle<00:04:08.940> work<00:04:09.180> if<00:04:09.540> it's

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
is in to make the throttle work if it's

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.520 
is in to make the throttle work if it's
out<00:04:10.050> like<00:04:10.380> that<00:04:10.680> the<00:04:11.190> throttle<00:04:11.550> is<00:04:11.640> turned<00:04:11.910> off

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530 
out like that the throttle is turned off

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:17.520 
out like that the throttle is turned off
good<00:04:13.530> luck

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:19.140 

you<00:04:17.859> can<00:04:18.010> see<00:04:18.220> that<00:04:18.430> there's<00:04:18.639> a<00:04:18.700> little<00:04:18.850> lever

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
you can see that there's a little lever

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.629 
you can see that there's a little lever
on<00:04:19.510> the<00:04:19.540> connector<00:04:20.079> you<00:04:20.109> just<00:04:20.430> push<00:04:21.430> your

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:21.639 
on the connector you just push your

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:23.790 
on the connector you just push your
thumb<00:04:22.030> onto<00:04:22.480> that<00:04:22.600> leader<00:04:22.870> that<00:04:23.020> unclips<00:04:23.590> it

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
thumb onto that leader that unclips it

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:35.140 
thumb onto that leader that unclips it
and<00:04:24.040> then<00:04:24.310> it<00:04:24.970> can<00:04:25.240> be<00:04:25.740> pulled<00:04:26.740> apart<00:04:26.860> like<00:04:27.340> so

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.210
