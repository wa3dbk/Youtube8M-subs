00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.410
 Hello, friends, how are you? 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.839
 Welcome back to my channel today 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.780
 is in a very interesting application and 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.969
 it's about ultimate mouse that is a 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.610
 application that allows us to control the 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.560
 mouse from our computer with the 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.480
 phone with our smartphone in this 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.520
 Case of agreement is an application 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.310
 quite intuitive we simply 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.890
 we connect to our computer via 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.110
 bluetooth or via wifi and from there 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.420
 we can control using the screen 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.650
 touch the mouse of our computer 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.000
 OK 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.760
 we have simple the application is called 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.589
 ultimate mouse as I have already told you 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.600
 can you download from the projector 

00:00:37.589 --> 00:00:42.719
 totally free without any kind of 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.179
 problem and good as you can see it the 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.940
 interface is pretty easy to understand 

00:00:45.179 --> 00:00:50.129
 first tell us here in touch mode if 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.289
 we give it to him because it comes out to us in mode 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.749
 basically the pointers mode basically 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.940
 for if we leave the dow click 

00:00:54.749 --> 00:00:59.069
 over the phone and we do so and move 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.589
 the mobile you can the arrow is moving 

00:00:59.069 --> 00:01:04.320
 in the same way that we move the 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:06.450
 phone an example well it's pretty much 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.960
 as the command of the wii that we 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.130
 we move 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.159
 and the arrow moves as well 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.869
 It would be this I honestly prefer it 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.909
 better in touch mode although in mode 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.580
 pointer can also be used with the 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.920
 finger of agreement I always connect 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:23.439
 via wifi and good 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:27.130
 and here I get to put wifi receivers me 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:29.200
 come out of here this now after you 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.570
 I will explain on the computer how it is done 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.759
 we just download the computer 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.880
 a program that I will explain now how 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:39.640
 is downloaded and in the program so what 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.470
 activate and let's say that program 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.420
 what it does is that I from my phone 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.979
 can I connect to the computer then 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.080
 once I have the program 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:49.180
 installed I give this one that would be my 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:53.009
 computer and tells me good things you 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.009
 It gave close and now 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.790
 to do this because it is already moving 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.610
 writing it right now it would be 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.409
 moving the arrow on the pc according 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.619
 here we have these two buttons that 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:08.130
 it would be the same buttons that this 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.720
 for the right button and this one to click 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.910
 or click on some with a mind 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.560
 we can do as in a touch pad the 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:17.280
 portable dice when doing so 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.450
 click here and now I'm going to 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.780
 show how 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.670
 It looks good on the computer deal 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.930
 because the computer as you are going to see is going 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.900
 to move the arrow I have here my 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.370
 phone and function if I move this 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.379
 As you can see, the mouse is moving 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:36.040
 you see it moving around like 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:37.989
 you can see it works pretty well 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.480
 let's get on the internet so that 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:43.030
 you can see that you can see here the 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.159
 arrow likewise if I hit the button 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:48.189
 this one here, the menu is going to come out 

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:51.700
 Contextually you see now I give it 

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:54.220
 to the other and it closes me I can make 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.109
 everything is worth another advantage of all this is 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.209
 that also serves as a keyboard that is to say 

00:02:56.109 --> 00:03:01.060
 example I come here and I'm going to write something 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:05.460
 if you look at this thing here is the 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:07.350
 keyboard then if we give it if I can 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:10.020
 you can not use a keyboard and how are you going 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.880
 see as I'm writing here I'm going 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.670
 typing on the computer you will see 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:17.090
 I'm going to say hello how are you like 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.090
 right here 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.000
 as you can see it is being written 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:25.490
 according to what I'm doing, so I'm leaving 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.870
 writing things on the screen because 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:28.870
 I'm going to write hello how 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.990
 and we can also select 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.770
 with 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:35.770
 we'll see 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.250
 Hello such 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:46.189
 so you can see well that is 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:49.920
 quite interesting then we give you here 

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:52.080
 and it's erased so 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.150
 this is all from the phone 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:57.090
 Now I'm going to leave you a video in which 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:59.550
 I will explain how 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:03.900
 install the program on the computer 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:06.390
 so that you can work on it like this 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.769
 now we see good once 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.910
 we are in the computer what we have 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:11.760
 what to do is enter our browser 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:13.799
 and put in the search engine the program 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.840
 ultimate control this program is the one 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:18.239
 will help us to make the phone 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:21.359
 can connect to the pc and thus be able to move 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:23.820
 the mouse from the mobile is worth just 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:25.919
 the first page ultimate control is the 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:28.500
 that we should enter in, it's worth 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:30.950
 the euro page of dotcom etc. 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:33.270
 It's worth once we enter, as you see 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:36.660
 tells us that it is for bluetoh wifi and 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:39.600
 also tells us that it is for android e 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:41.669
 ios that is, those who have iphone and 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.080
 so then it also serves you what 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:46.000
 what we have to do is give it to you 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:48.280
 says download none we give 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.560
 and good we will appear systems 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:52.120
 operatives then depending on the 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.430
 operating system that you have the 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.440
 selecting is one of the advantages is 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:58.870
 which also supports linux as you can 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.730
 see is worth both 32 and 64 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:03.280
 we would give windows because it is 

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:05.530
 the case in case of agreement and no longer 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.730
 would go where we want to save the set I 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:08.230
 I recommend that you keep in the 

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:11.170
 desk because you can 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:12.910
 find more easily and already only 

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:14.890
 would give it to save if it would start to 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:16.930
 download and it would simply be 

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:18.130
 install the set and like any other 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:20.320
 I'm not going to do it because I already 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:22.600
 I have installed once you have already 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:25.770
 installed all this you come here to 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:28.720
 where it says ultimate control and well 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:30.760
 As you can see this is the program that 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.669
 you should download here they appear 

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:35.590
 the types of connections or via wifi 

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:37.180
 or by bluetooth than bluetooth as it does not 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:38.980
 I know why but it does not allow me now 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:41.260
 select it but good as I'm going 

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:42.940
 to do by wifi not all problem this 

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:45.280
 Well, here you do not have to touch him 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:47.980
 nothing this normal and here good because 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:49.690
 neither is this the name of the people or 

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:51.520
 be the name of the computer that is the 

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:52.420
 name that will come out here in the 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.160
 phone 

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:55.480
 when I had enter in the application this 

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:58.000
 you can change it and give it a name 

00:05:55.480 --> 00:06:01.480
 personalized but basically neither 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.550
 it's very interesting and good once 

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:06.400
 we get on the phone and 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:08.350
 select the program be in the 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.540
 computer then we would give to where it says 

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:12.220
 hide in agreement then now 

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:14.350
 we could work perfectly without 

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:16.240
 need for the program to be 

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:19.420
 bothering when we want to remove it then 

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:22.090
 we give him here we go back and get him 

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:23.650
 we give to where it says to leave and it will ask us 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:26.710
 that if we are sure to leave the 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:29.560
 program we accept and because 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:32.340
 we would have finished the flight connection 

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:32.340
 so this has been all
