year and that's gonna tell us about it

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.729 
year and that's gonna tell us about it
we've<00:00:31.720> tried<00:00:31.960> a<00:00:31.990> lot<00:00:32.200> of<00:00:32.260> different<00:00:32.349> nose

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:32.739 
we've tried a lot of different nose

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:35.760 
we've tried a lot of different nose
designs<00:00:33.160> over<00:00:33.370> the<00:00:33.550> years<00:00:33.760> in<00:00:34.030> this<00:00:34.390> design<00:00:34.870> by

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:35.770 
designs over the years in this design by

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.420 
designs over the years in this design by
far<00:00:36.250> it<00:00:36.760> has<00:00:37.600> been<00:00:37.900> great<00:00:38.350> in<00:00:38.620> almost<00:00:38.860> every

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:39.430 
far it has been great in almost every

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.170 
far it has been great in almost every
type<00:00:39.670> of<00:00:39.850> condition<00:00:40.300> flat<00:00:40.750> water<00:00:41.080> upwind

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
type of condition flat water upwind

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.560 
type of condition flat water upwind
downwind<00:00:43.180> side<00:00:43.780> chop<00:00:44.370> it<00:00:45.370> just<00:00:46.239> seems<00:00:46.450> to

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:46.570 
downwind side chop it just seems to

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.299 
downwind side chop it just seems to
handle<00:00:46.780> it<00:00:46.989> all<00:00:47.140> it's<00:00:47.470> definitely<00:00:48.190> our

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:48.309 
handle it all it's definitely our

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:51.210 
handle it all it's definitely our
favorite<00:00:48.520> design<00:00:49.500> all<00:00:50.500> right<00:00:50.740> now<00:00:50.890> we're<00:00:51.070> kind

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:51.220 
favorite design all right now we're kind

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:52.580 
favorite design all right now we're kind
of<00:00:51.250> moving<00:00:51.370> on<00:00:51.579> to<00:00:51.700> the<00:00:51.820> deck<00:00:51.970> of<00:00:52.120> the<00:00:52.180> board

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
of moving on to the deck of the board

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.080 
of moving on to the deck of the board
we've<00:00:53.590> tried<00:00:53.829> to<00:00:53.860> keep<00:00:54.190> the<00:00:54.400> maximum<00:00:54.850> amount

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:55.090 
we've tried to keep the maximum amount

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.600 
we've tried to keep the maximum amount
of<00:00:55.270> volume<00:00:55.480> in<00:00:55.930> the<00:00:56.260> nose<00:00:56.440> area<00:00:56.710> so<00:00:57.340> the<00:00:57.430> nose

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:57.610 
of volume in the nose area so the nose

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.180 
of volume in the nose area so the nose
will<00:00:57.820> write<00:00:58.060> itself<00:00:58.480> if<00:00:58.690> does<00:00:58.930> go<00:00:59.200> too<00:00:59.770> deeply

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
will write itself if does go too deeply

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.660 
will write itself if does go too deeply
into<00:01:00.340> a<00:01:00.489> wave<00:01:00.700> then<00:01:01.300> in<00:01:01.480> here<00:01:01.810> the<00:01:02.680> rail

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
into a wave then in here the rail

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.790 
into a wave then in here the rail
actually<00:01:03.940> swales<00:01:04.540> down<00:01:04.960> a<00:01:04.989> little<00:01:05.410> bit<00:01:05.560> and

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:05.800 
actually swales down a little bit and

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.830 
actually swales down a little bit and
then<00:01:06.280> there's<00:01:06.520> a<00:01:06.580> nice<00:01:06.790> crown<00:01:07.240> on<00:01:07.509> the<00:01:07.630> deck

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
then there's a nice crown on the deck

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.160 
then there's a nice crown on the deck
and<00:01:08.259> then<00:01:08.530> kind<00:01:08.860> of<00:01:08.890> comes<00:01:09.160> up<00:01:09.399> into<00:01:10.170> the

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
and then kind of comes up into the

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:12.780 
and then kind of comes up into the
highest<00:01:11.560> point<00:01:11.830> right<00:01:12.160> here<00:01:12.369> right<00:01:12.640> in<00:01:12.759> front

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:12.790 
highest point right here right in front

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.300 
highest point right here right in front
of<00:01:13.030> the<00:01:13.119> rider<00:01:13.330> so<00:01:13.720> if<00:01:14.170> any<00:01:14.350> water<00:01:14.680> comes<00:01:15.070> in

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
of the rider so if any water comes in

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.310 
of the rider so if any water comes in
we're<00:01:15.790> trying<00:01:16.060> to<00:01:16.149> shed<00:01:16.360> that<00:01:16.540> water<00:01:16.869> off<00:01:17.110> as

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
we're trying to shed that water off as

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.469 
we're trying to shed that water off as
soon<00:01:17.500> as<00:01:17.680> we<00:01:17.830> can<00:01:18.100> without<00:01:18.580> having<00:01:18.970> a<00:01:19.210> whole

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:19.479 
soon as we can without having a whole

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:23.550 
soon as we can without having a whole
lot<00:01:19.540> of<00:01:19.810> extra<00:01:20.080> volume<00:01:20.890> up<00:01:21.159> here<00:01:22.380> which<00:01:23.380> is

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
lot of extra volume up here which is

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.260 
lot of extra volume up here which is
gonna<00:01:23.740> add<00:01:23.979> extra<00:01:24.520> weight<00:01:24.729> above<00:01:25.120> the

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
gonna add extra weight above the

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:26.850 
gonna add extra weight above the
waterline<00:01:25.570> and<00:01:26.020> that<00:01:26.140> foam<00:01:26.380> really<00:01:26.740> isn't

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
waterline and that foam really isn't

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.240 
waterline and that foam really isn't
doing<00:01:27.010> anything<00:01:27.580> for<00:01:27.820> you<00:01:27.940> there<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.950> our

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
doing anything for you there the our

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.039 
doing anything for you there the our
cockpit<00:01:30.580> is<00:01:30.909> one<00:01:31.060> of<00:01:31.150> the<00:01:31.210> deeper<00:01:31.540> cockpits

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:32.049 
cockpit is one of the deeper cockpits

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:33.719 
cockpit is one of the deeper cockpits
I've<00:01:32.229> ever<00:01:32.409> seen<00:01:32.680> out<00:01:32.740> there<00:01:33.130> this<00:01:33.340> brings<00:01:33.640> the

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729 
I've ever seen out there this brings the

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:35.910 
I've ever seen out there this brings the
rider<00:01:34.030> closer<00:01:34.450> to<00:01:34.690> the<00:01:34.780> water<00:01:34.990> aids<00:01:35.680> and

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
rider closer to the water aids and

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.910 
rider closer to the water aids and
stability<00:01:36.159> let<00:01:37.090> you<00:01:37.240> have<00:01:37.360> a<00:01:37.390> flat<00:01:37.720> a<00:01:38.260> faster

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
stability let you have a flat a faster

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.620 
stability let you have a flat a faster
bottom<00:01:39.310> or<00:01:39.430> put<00:01:39.610> a<00:01:39.640> faster<00:01:40.060> bottom<00:01:40.390> on<00:01:40.540> the

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
bottom or put a faster bottom on the

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.630 
bottom or put a faster bottom on the
board<00:01:40.869> but<00:01:41.470> what's<00:01:41.710> real<00:01:41.890> important<00:01:42.430> is<00:01:42.520> the

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
board but what's real important is the

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.100 
board but what's real important is the
water<00:01:42.850> still<00:01:43.180> needs<00:01:43.420> to<00:01:43.600> flow<00:01:43.840> out<00:01:43.869> the<00:01:44.200> back

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
water still needs to flow out the back

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.270 
water still needs to flow out the back
this<00:01:47.110> force<00:01:47.380> made<00:01:47.590> out<00:01:47.740> of<00:01:47.860> two<00:01:48.010> different

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
the spread toe carbon is that it's

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.830 
the spread toe carbon is that it's
literally<00:02:14.680> half<00:02:15.010> the<00:02:15.040> weight<00:02:15.600> material<00:02:16.600> and

literally half the weight material and

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.199 
literally half the weight material and
it's<00:02:17.680> five<00:02:17.920> times<00:02:18.190> stronger<00:02:20.730> carry<00:02:21.730> you<00:02:21.910> spent

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
it's five times stronger carry you spent

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:25.350 
it's five times stronger carry you spent
