00:00:01.069 --> 00:00:05.140
 year to see 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:08.019
 is known in the porridge of progression 

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:10.379
 if you want to keep making progress, it is handy 

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:14.090
 also serious strength exercises such as the bank manager 30th 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:15.370
 do the song outside 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:19.099
 and also for beating all other variation incentives are the training 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:21.509
 to continue to force progression 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:23.050
 much forgotten exercise 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.750
 in that this is the country concerned, I would like to demonstrate that 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.779
 a primary school for the thirtieth 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:33.730
 feet on shoulder width may already be slightly wider than shoulder width 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.070
 if you look down and already knew it until the transition from the vvd 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.690
 you are an antillean handle 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.220
 a hand for a hand behind 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.220
 at the moment that the gravel comes loose from the ground, the intention is that I see small 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:49.490
 bit the honor sits down 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:53.170
 so you can always have it yourself and go on the floor 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.070
 later the tallest books are gradually 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.070
 I have to keep you as close as possible to your own center of gravity 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.440
 this exercise is 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.330
 practically the whole body 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.740
 but in particular of course the gluteal hamstrings 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.180
 quadriceps 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.180
 but everywhere your neck 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.960
 by doing this exercise not too light use enough weight so that you have a maximum of 80 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.250
 make american 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:31.630
 a good boost 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.080
 3 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.100
 Another nice power exercise that you can bring to training include some 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.100
 The track is also clinically 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.810
 dries is good for your kp4 the back of your neck 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.070
 but also for your lower back 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.200
 just like with the bed, it is actually for your entire body that you are in shape 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.620
 if you would make many repetitions 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.710
 As a rule, the peacock becomes exercise 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.790
 never repeated more than six times 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.040
 what you then you have too few posts left to have even more arrests 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.560
 if you do it on a global level in terms of weight 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.560
 and so it is also a dangerous claim to injuries 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:06.790
 both 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.729
 when you hit a crisis, you both take the trading day Monday 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.630
 see examples in it was always not going to give in or on reading 3 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.209
 too fat all legs forward 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:18.309
 the position is about the same as with the twitter 

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:20.560
 you also make a mountain trip in the beginning 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.099
 the moment the flat above no longer hits you lead through your black point to 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:28.039
 to bring forward by raising your shoulders and that meant coming 

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:31.119
 because I have more fluid movement 

00:02:31.119 --> 00:02:34.119
 so that's how it goes 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:41.839
 the ref 

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:44.839
 and accelerate 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:48.669
 as the area gets heavier 

00:02:48.669 --> 00:02:51.279
 better in bags 

00:02:51.279 --> 00:02:54.279
 the art world stand out a bit 

00:03:02.719 --> 00:03:05.739
 openings give your training a little more spirit
