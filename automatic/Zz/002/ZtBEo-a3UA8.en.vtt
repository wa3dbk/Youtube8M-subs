um okay what we got today is ever taped
it<00:00:07.170> up<00:00:07.290> so<00:00:08.040> but<00:00:08.280> you<00:00:08.430> can<00:00:08.460> tell<00:00:08.760> it's<00:00:08.910> a<00:00:08.970> case<00:00:09.150> of

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:09.180 
it up so but you can tell it's a case of

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.780 
it up so but you can tell it's a case of
a<00:00:09.360> motorcycle<00:00:09.870> of<00:00:09.990> an<00:00:10.110> old<00:00:10.290> 175<00:00:11.100> Yamaha<00:00:11.670> the

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
a motorcycle of an old 175 Yamaha the

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.290 
a motorcycle of an old 175 Yamaha the
problem<00:00:12.720> that<00:00:13.400> they<00:00:14.400> have<00:00:14.639> is<00:00:14.910> they<00:00:15.120> have

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:15.300 
problem that they have is they have

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.540 
problem that they have is they have
these<00:00:15.480> weirdo<00:00:15.990> little<00:00:16.940> cast<00:00:17.940> in<00:00:18.390> steel

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:19.550 
these weirdo little cast in steel

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.279 
these weirdo little cast in steel
support<00:00:20.550> races<00:00:21.029> for<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.360> main<00:00:21.630> bearings<00:00:22.050> and

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:24.289 
support races for the main bearings and

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:26.660 
support races for the main bearings and
it's<00:00:25.289> hard<00:00:25.500> to<00:00:25.560> see<00:00:25.859> you<00:00:25.980> but<00:00:26.130> you<00:00:26.220> can<00:00:26.340> see<00:00:26.520> our

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
it's hard to see you but you can see our

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.429 
it's hard to see you but you can see our
oil<00:00:26.970> squirting<00:00:27.689> in<00:00:27.779> and<00:00:27.900> out<00:00:27.990> of<00:00:28.140> it<00:00:28.230> there

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
oil squirting in and out of it there

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.269 
oil squirting in and out of it there
it's<00:00:28.619> it's<00:00:29.180> hollowed<00:00:30.180> out<00:00:30.330> and<00:00:30.439> the<00:00:31.439> cheap<00:00:31.949> fix

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
it's it's hollowed out and the cheap fix

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.150 
it's it's hollowed out and the cheap fix
for<00:00:32.579> it<00:00:32.700> is<00:00:32.820> to<00:00:33.350> peen<00:00:34.350> it<00:00:34.530> back<00:00:34.710> in<00:00:34.950> there

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
for it is to peen it back in there

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.600 
for it is to peen it back in there
around<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.670> edge<00:00:35.790> and<00:00:36.500> it<00:00:37.500> being<00:00:37.920> aluminum

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
around the edge and it being aluminum

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.810 
around the edge and it being aluminum
that<00:00:38.790> doesn't<00:00:39.210> work<00:00:39.510> very<00:00:39.540> well

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
that doesn't work very well

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.840 
that doesn't work very well
I'm<00:00:41.820> guessing<00:00:42.360> that<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:43.130> original<00:00:44.130> well<00:00:44.610> you

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
I'm guessing that the original well you

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.369 
I'm guessing that the original well you
know<00:00:45.180> since<00:00:45.360> its<00:00:45.540> cast<00:00:45.780> in<00:00:46.020> there<00:00:46.200> there

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
know since its cast in there there

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.479 
know since its cast in there there
wasn't<00:00:46.530> really<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.800> press<00:00:47.100> effect<00:00:47.340> they<00:00:47.399> were

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
wasn't really a press effect they were

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:48.650 
wasn't really a press effect they were
just<00:00:47.640> counting<00:00:47.910> on<00:00:47.969> how<00:00:48.059> much<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.329> aluminum

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
just counting on how much the aluminum

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.990 
just counting on how much the aluminum
shrunk<00:00:49.079> around<00:00:49.379> it<00:00:49.559> when<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.340> casting<00:00:50.760> cooled

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
shrunk around it when the casting cooled

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.959 
shrunk around it when the casting cooled
off<00:00:51.770> because<00:00:52.770> of<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.190> expansion<00:00:53.520> rate<00:00:53.789> and

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
off because of the expansion rate and

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.670 
off because of the expansion rate and
contracted<00:00:54.360> rate<00:00:54.510> of<00:00:54.570> aluminum<00:00:54.960> as<00:00:55.140> versus

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
contracted rate of aluminum as versus

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.900 
contracted rate of aluminum as versus
steel<00:00:56.030> so<00:00:57.079> what<00:00:58.079> I'm<00:00:58.289> going<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:58.860> do<00:00:59.070> and<00:00:59.489> most

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
steel so what I'm going to do and most

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.720 
steel so what I'm going to do and most
people<00:01:00.270> tell<00:01:00.539> me<00:01:00.570> this<00:01:01.110> is<00:01:01.289> possible<00:01:02.250> but<00:01:02.489> I<00:01:02.550> do

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
people tell me this is possible but I do

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:03.410 
people tell me this is possible but I do
it<00:01:02.940> all<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.059> time

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
it all the time

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.179 
it all the time
this<00:01:04.379> is<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.619> regular<00:01:05.279> old<00:01:06.799> roller<00:01:07.799> bearing

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
this is a regular old roller bearing

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.179 
this is a regular old roller bearing
race<00:01:08.869> for<00:01:09.869> just<00:01:10.170> a<00:01:10.289> solid<00:01:10.649> roller<00:01:10.829> bearing

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
race for just a solid roller bearing

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.989 
race for just a solid roller bearing
cylindrical<00:01:12.149> roller<00:01:12.329> ring<00:01:12.509> and<00:01:13.520> it's<00:01:14.520> just<00:01:14.909> a

00:01:14.989 --> 00:01:14.999 
cylindrical roller ring and it's just a

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:18.080 
cylindrical roller ring and it's just a
little<00:01:15.209> bit<00:01:15.329> bigger<00:01:15.569> than<00:01:16.490> the<00:01:17.490> old<00:01:17.520> steel

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
little bit bigger than the old steel

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.519 
little bit bigger than the old steel
sleeve<00:01:18.509> or<00:01:19.319> steel<00:01:19.679> insert<00:01:20.340> thing<00:01:20.990> so<00:01:21.990> I<00:01:22.289> will

00:01:22.519 --> 00:01:22.529 
sleeve or steel insert thing so I will

00:01:22.529 --> 00:01:24.180 
sleeve or steel insert thing so I will
have<00:01:22.679> enough<00:01:22.920> room

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.190 
have enough room

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:25.890 
have enough room
you<00:01:24.760> know<00:01:24.880> so<00:01:25.120> a<00:01:25.150> little<00:01:25.330> bit<00:01:25.480> of<00:01:25.600> the<00:01:25.690> ears

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:25.900 
you know so a little bit of the ears

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.120 
you know so a little bit of the ears
left<00:01:26.140> on<00:01:26.290> there<00:01:26.440> but<00:01:26.560> I'll<00:01:26.650> have<00:01:26.770> enough<00:01:26.950> room

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
left on there but I'll have enough room

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:28.800 
left on there but I'll have enough room
that<00:01:27.370> I<00:01:27.610> can<00:01:27.640> actually<00:01:27.970> press<00:01:28.210> this<00:01:28.390> in<00:01:28.570> tight

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
that I can actually press this in tight

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.460 
that I can actually press this in tight
enough<00:01:29.020> it'll<00:01:29.140> stay<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:30.690> then<00:01:31.690> bore<00:01:32.080> this<00:01:32.260> out

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
enough it'll stay and then bore this out

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.470 
enough it'll stay and then bore this out
to<00:01:32.650> the<00:01:32.770> correct<00:01:33.070> size

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:34.480 
to the correct size

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.480 
to the correct size
you<00:01:34.900> can't<00:01:35.200> cut<00:01:35.530> this<00:01:35.680> with<00:01:35.890> high<00:01:36.010> speed<00:01:36.280> steel

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
you can't cut this with high speed steel

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.040 
you can't cut this with high speed steel
you<00:01:36.700> can<00:01:36.910> cut<00:01:37.180> it<00:01:37.270> with<00:01:37.300> carbide<00:01:37.780> if<00:01:37.930> you're

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.050 
you can cut it with carbide if you're

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:39.930 
you can cut it with carbide if you're
careful<00:01:38.350> and<00:01:38.680> I<00:01:39.070> will<00:01:39.220> demonstrate<00:01:39.400> how<00:01:39.640> to<00:01:39.760> do

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:39.940 
careful and I will demonstrate how to do

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.150 
careful and I will demonstrate how to do
that<00:01:40.090> but<00:01:40.690> the<00:01:40.780> plan<00:01:40.960> so<00:01:41.200> far<00:01:41.410> and<00:01:41.950> the<00:01:42.010> other

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:42.160 
that but the plan so far and the other

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.460 
that but the plan so far and the other
thing<00:01:42.340> is<00:01:42.520> is<00:01:42.730> that<00:01:42.760> this<00:01:43.060> main<00:01:43.480> bearing<00:01:43.870> which

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 
thing is is that this main bearing which

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.350 
thing is is that this main bearing which
hasn't<00:01:45.040> spun<00:01:45.490> I<00:01:45.520> mean<00:01:45.850> you<00:01:45.970> know<00:01:46.060> it's<00:01:46.210> got

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
hasn't spun I mean you know it's got

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.550 
hasn't spun I mean you know it's got
some<00:01:46.390> marks<00:01:46.750> where<00:01:46.870> it's<00:01:46.990> been<00:01:47.230> in<00:01:47.380> there<00:01:47.530> for

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
some marks where it's been in there for

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.710 
some marks where it's been in there for
a<00:01:47.710> while<00:01:47.830> but<00:01:48.040> it<00:01:48.100> hasn't<00:01:48.250> spun<00:01:51.330> was<00:01:52.330> only<00:01:52.600> in

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
a while but it hasn't spun was only in

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.320 
a while but it hasn't spun was only in
there<00:01:52.870> with<00:01:53.050> like<00:01:53.200> I<00:01:53.820> would<00:01:54.820> say<00:01:55.000> half<00:01:55.240> a

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
there with like I would say half a

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:56.790 
there with like I would say half a
thousandth<00:01:55.750> of<00:01:55.840> press<00:01:56.050> man<00:01:56.260> I<00:01:56.290> mean<00:01:56.500> it<00:01:56.590> took

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:56.800 
thousandth of press man I mean it took

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.890
