00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:37.200
When I looked at that perfectly round moon I thought

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:44.660
“Isn’t it just a gaping empty hole in the earth?”

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:51.940
Beyond that there’s a shining world spreading

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:59.840
While sleeping my dreams and my hopes too are being sucked in

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:06.800
“God, why have you created such trash?”

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:16.240
I can’t even stick the key of my heart’s door very well

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:24.600
Someday, I’ll end up being sucked into the light too and then disappear

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:32.220
And I’ll wear an angel’s hoop, throwing away all my memories

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:39.580
At my rate in 100 years everyone will end up melting away and becoming one

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:52.760
If this is what you wish for, then I won’t be lost anymore

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:09.540
If the stars make a fuss, the earth will break down

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:16.960
The sky’s fragments are going to downpour like glass

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:24.260
If I try to know it all my body will get pierced

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:31.960
And even that heart that I've longed for and loved will be torn apart

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:39.140
The wound that is shining in the blue light of the moon hurts

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:49.340
I haven’t even been able to say that person’s name for a bit

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:56.940
Someday, I’ll end up being sucked into the light too and then disappear

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:04.340
And while spreading an angel’s wings I’ll fly far beyond the galaxy

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:11.840
At any rate in 100 years everyone will end up melting away and becoming one

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:20.480
If this is your last desire then there’s nothing to fear anymore

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.120
Even if I’ll be reborn,

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:34.140
surely, to you, I’ll just be a repetition

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:41.140
Someday, I’ll end up being sucked into the light too and then disappear

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:48.680
And I’ll wear an angel’s hoop, throwing away all my memories

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:56.020
At my rate in 100 years everyone will end up melting away and becoming one

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:03.400
If this is what you wish for, then I won’t be lost

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.980
anymore
