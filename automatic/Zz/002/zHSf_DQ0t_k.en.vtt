00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.320 
there's a very good one because the

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.350 
there's a very good one because the
second<00:00:56.770> page<00:00:56.920> stops<00:00:57.250> using<00:00:57.550> chords<00:00:58.000> so<00:00:58.270> we

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:58.360 
second page stops using chords so we

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.570 
second page stops using chords so we
stop<00:00:58.570> putting<00:00:58.660> tune<00:00:58.960> into<00:00:59.260> the<00:00:59.350> time<00:00:59.590> left<00:01:00.430> and

stop putting tune into the time left and

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:01.440 
stop putting tune into the time left and
then<00:01:00.760> right<00:01:00.970> in<00:01:01.090> it

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:01.450 
then right in it

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.020 
then right in it
first<00:01:02.170> page<00:01:02.410> is<00:01:02.710> not<00:01:03.130> that<00:01:03.400> hard<00:01:03.700> just

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030 
first page is not that hard just

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.450 
first page is not that hard just
basically<00:01:04.750> step<00:01:05.080> reading<00:01:05.470> so<00:01:05.770> much<00:01:06.160> watch

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
basically step reading so much watch

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.130 
basically step reading so much watch
your<00:01:06.670> repeated<00:01:07.330> notes<00:01:07.510> that's<00:01:07.810> what<00:01:07.960> a<00:01:07.990> lot<00:01:08.110> of

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 
your repeated notes that's what a lot of

your repeated notes that's what a lot of
people<00:01:08.229> get<00:01:08.470> lost<00:01:08.500> on<00:01:08.860> and<00:01:09.100> there's<00:01:09.310> really

not that many skips I think there's only
one<00:01:11.110> skip<00:01:11.680> right<00:01:11.830> there<00:01:12.070> and<00:01:12.520> then<00:01:12.670> right<00:01:12.790> here

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
one skip right there and then right here

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.150 
one skip right there and then right here

of this a lot of people have trouble on
that<00:01:17.560> last<00:01:17.740> line<00:01:18.010> so<00:01:18.460> I<00:01:18.490> tell<00:01:18.760> them<00:01:18.880> to<00:01:19.030> do<00:01:19.180> that

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 
that last line so I tell them to do that

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.050 
that last line so I tell them to do that
mine<00:01:20.020> from<00:01:20.500> 13<00:01:20.950> to<00:01:20.979> the<00:01:21.160> end<00:01:21.340> of<00:01:21.430> the<00:01:21.490> page<00:01:21.670> like

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
mine from 13 to the end of the page like

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:33.969 
mine from 13 to the end of the page like
ten<00:01:22.270> times<00:01:22.500> pretty<00:01:23.500> much<00:01:23.649> left<00:01:24.190> hand

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:35.770 

really<00:01:34.610> not<00:01:34.789> that<00:01:34.909> hard<00:01:35.119> the<00:01:35.299> right<00:01:35.450> hand<00:01:35.659> is

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
really not that hard the right hand is

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.690 
really not that hard the right hand is
pretty<00:01:36.229> much<00:01:36.409> only<00:01:36.619> doing<00:01:36.890> the<00:01:36.950> letter<00:01:37.130> D<00:01:37.399> it's

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
pretty much only doing the letter D it's

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.279 
pretty much only doing the letter D it's
the<00:01:37.759> left<00:01:37.939> hand<00:01:38.119> that<00:01:38.240> skips<00:01:38.600> back<00:01:38.840> and<00:01:39.110> forth

00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:39.289 
the left hand that skips back and forth

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:44.550 
the left hand that skips back and forth
okay

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.220 

and<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:46.060> secret<00:01:46.360> to<00:01:46.390> this<00:01:46.570> song<00:01:46.810> is<00:01:47.020> that

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:47.230 
and the secret to this song is that

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:48.630 
and the secret to this song is that
there's<00:01:47.380> a<00:01:47.440> lot<00:01:47.590> of<00:01:47.620> repeated<00:01:47.980> things<00:01:48.280> so<00:01:48.490> this

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
there's a lot of repeated things so this

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.760 
there's a lot of repeated things so this
in<00:01:49.000> this<00:01:49.270> of<00:01:49.540> the<00:01:49.630> things<00:01:49.840> I<00:01:49.990> think<00:01:50.320> so<00:01:50.590> once

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
in this of the things I think so once

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.740 
in this of the things I think so once
you<00:01:50.890> got<00:01:50.980> that<00:01:51.190> you<00:01:51.460> got<00:01:51.490> two<00:01:51.790> lines<00:01:51.970> so<00:01:52.630> it's

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
you got that you got two lines so it's

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.980 
you got that you got two lines so it's
been<00:01:52.930> your<00:01:52.990> time<00:01:53.170> on<00:01:53.290> that<00:01:54.660> another<00:01:55.660> trick<00:01:55.900> to

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
been your time on that another trick to

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.660 
been your time on that another trick to
the<00:01:56.080> song<00:01:56.290> is<00:01:56.470> that<00:01:56.500> this<00:01:56.860> song<00:01:57.160> is<00:01:57.340> the<00:01:57.370> same

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
the song is that this song is the same

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.640 
the song is that this song is the same
thing<00:01:57.940> twice<00:01:58.210> actually<00:01:58.570> it's<00:01:59.020> just<00:01:59.200> a<00:01:59.290> second

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.650 
thing twice actually it's just a second

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.680 
thing twice actually it's just a second
page<00:01:59.800> they<00:02:00.010> add<00:02:00.190> notes<00:02:00.550> so<00:02:01.360> if<00:02:01.450> you<00:02:01.540> actually

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 
page they add notes so if you actually

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:02.940 
page they add notes so if you actually
look<00:02:01.960> at<00:02:02.020> your<00:02:02.140> right<00:02:02.350> hand<00:02:02.380> part<00:02:02.770> it's<00:02:02.920> the

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
look at your right hand part it's the

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.740 
look at your right hand part it's the
same<00:02:03.100> exact<00:02:03.640> thing<00:02:03.850> as<00:02:03.970> your<00:02:04.119> right<00:02:04.360> hand<00:02:04.600> part

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
same exact thing as your right hand part

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.960 
same exact thing as your right hand part
on<00:02:04.900> the<00:02:04.960> second<00:02:05.320> page<00:02:05.440> all<00:02:06.280> they<00:02:06.490> do<00:02:06.550> is<00:02:06.760> add

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
on the second page all they do is add

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.990 
on the second page all they do is add
that<00:02:07.180> chord<00:02:07.540> to<00:02:07.690> the<00:02:07.780> beginning<00:02:08.080> of<00:02:08.259> every<00:02:09.000> of

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
that chord to the beginning of every of

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.650 
that chord to the beginning of every of
every<00:02:10.420> sentence<00:02:10.780> so<00:02:11.590> what<00:02:12.250> for<00:02:12.850> that<00:02:12.910> stuff<00:02:13.330> so

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
every sentence so what for that stuff so

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:23.840 
every sentence so what for that stuff so
the<00:02:13.750> second<00:02:14.110> page<00:02:16.500> we<00:02:17.500> just<00:02:17.530> add<00:02:17.800> that<00:02:17.980> a<00:02:18.160> to<00:02:18.220> it

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:35.350 

so<00:02:24.850> you're<00:02:27.870> ending<00:02:28.870> a<00:02:29.080> boy<00:02:29.290> to<00:02:29.530> it

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.540 

the<00:02:36.260> second<00:02:36.590> line<00:02:36.680> is<00:02:36.830> another<00:02:36.980> tricky<00:02:37.280> part

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
the second line is another tricky part

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:43.850 
the second line is another tricky part
so

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.890 

choose<00:02:44.610> some<00:02:44.940> hard<00:02:45.180> notes<00:02:45.360> in<00:02:45.510> that<00:02:45.600> left<00:02:45.780> hand

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
choose some hard notes in that left hand

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.400 
choose some hard notes in that left hand
but<00:02:47.030> the<00:02:48.030> trick<00:02:48.270> to<00:02:48.390> that<00:02:48.420> is<00:02:48.600> just<00:02:49.080> do<00:02:49.200> that

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
but the trick to that is just do that

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.110 
but the trick to that is just do that
first<00:02:49.680> line<00:02:49.920> like<00:02:50.280> ten<00:02:50.490> times<00:02:50.670> from<00:02:51.000> the

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
first line like ten times from the

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.030 
first line like ten times from the
second<00:02:51.450> line<00:02:51.540> length<00:02:51.780> 10<00:02:51.930> times<00:02:52.170> it<00:02:52.950> was

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
second line length 10 times it was

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.230 
second line length 10 times it was
actually<00:02:53.310> funny<00:02:53.490> I<00:02:53.580> had<00:02:53.730> a<00:02:53.760> student<00:02:54.000> teaching

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
actually funny I had a student teaching

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.850 
actually funny I had a student teaching
that<00:02:54.480> I<00:02:54.690> was<00:02:54.810> teaching<00:02:55.080> this<00:02:55.170> too<00:02:55.350> and<00:02:55.590> she

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
that I was teaching this too and she

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.440 
that I was teaching this too and she
played<00:02:56.040> the<00:02:56.220> song<00:02:56.490> like<00:02:56.670> perfectly<00:02:57.120> but<00:02:57.330> she

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
played the song like perfectly but she

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:58.910
