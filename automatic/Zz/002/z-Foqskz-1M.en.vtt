00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:06.940 

I<00:00:05.049> started<00:00:06.049> implementing<00:00:06.470> formative

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:06.950 
I started implementing formative

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:08.980 
I started implementing formative
assessment<00:00:07.430> more<00:00:07.970> commonly<00:00:08.300> in<00:00:08.450> my<00:00:08.540> classroom

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:08.990 
assessment more commonly in my classroom

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:11.500 
assessment more commonly in my classroom
this<00:00:09.110> year<00:00:09.170> because<00:00:10.070> I<00:00:10.100> realized<00:00:10.610> it's<00:00:11.209> a<00:00:11.330> lot

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:11.510 
this year because I realized it's a lot

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.230 
this year because I realized it's a lot
easier<00:00:11.690> to<00:00:12.130> clarify<00:00:13.130> any<00:00:13.400> misconceptions<00:00:13.759> a

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:14.240 
easier to clarify any misconceptions a

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:15.910 
easier to clarify any misconceptions a
student<00:00:14.540> might<00:00:14.690> have<00:00:14.870> might<00:00:15.139> have<00:00:15.440> on<00:00:15.740> the

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:15.920 
student might have might have on the

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.460 
student might have might have on the
topic<00:00:16.309> or<00:00:16.640> the<00:00:16.759> content<00:00:17.180> at<00:00:17.300> that<00:00:17.599> point<00:00:17.900> then

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:18.470 
topic or the content at that point then

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.010 
topic or the content at that point then
having<00:00:18.740> to<00:00:18.860> go<00:00:19.070> back<00:00:19.310> after<00:00:20.300> a<00:00:20.330> test<00:00:20.660> and

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:21.020 
having to go back after a test and

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:22.900 
having to go back after a test and
figure<00:00:21.410> out<00:00:21.560> where<00:00:22.369> they<00:00:22.520> might<00:00:22.550> have

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:22.910 
figure out where they might have

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.599 
figure out where they might have
confusion<00:00:23.359> in<00:00:23.689> the<00:00:24.289> weeks<00:00:24.500> prior<00:00:24.619> so<00:00:25.490> we're

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:25.609 
confusion in the weeks prior so we're

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:27.460 
confusion in the weeks prior so we're
able<00:00:25.730> to<00:00:25.939> clarify<00:00:26.119> a<00:00:26.420> lot<00:00:26.660> of<00:00:26.750> misconception

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.470 
able to clarify a lot of misconception

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.200 
able to clarify a lot of misconception
and<00:00:27.680> a<00:00:28.070> lot<00:00:28.189> of<00:00:28.279> the<00:00:28.400> students<00:00:28.880> are<00:00:28.939> able<00:00:29.060> to

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.210 
and a lot of the students are able to

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.689 
and a lot of the students are able to
see<00:00:29.539> that<00:00:29.990> they're<00:00:30.439> not<00:00:30.859> the<00:00:31.189> only<00:00:31.279> ones<00:00:31.580> with

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:31.699 
see that they're not the only ones with

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:35.530 
see that they're not the only ones with
that<00:00:32.000> issue<00:00:32.720> or<00:00:33.199> with<00:00:33.739> that<00:00:33.920> question<00:00:34.540> this

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.540 
that issue or with that question this

that issue or with that question this
Vista<00:00:36.110> 5<00:00:36.379> is<00:00:36.739> a<00:00:36.799> new<00:00:37.100> technique<00:00:37.549> that<00:00:38.390> I<00:00:38.510> got<00:00:38.750> at

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.870 
Vista 5 is a new technique that I got at

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.930 
Vista 5 is a new technique that I got at
the<00:00:38.900> last<00:00:39.199> training<00:00:39.530> and<00:00:39.830> I<00:00:40.400> really<00:00:40.699> enjoyed

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 
the last training and I really enjoyed

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.850 
the last training and I really enjoyed
it<00:00:40.970> because<00:00:41.360> it<00:00:41.600> made<00:00:41.780> me<00:00:41.809> as<00:00:42.140> an<00:00:42.290> adult<00:00:42.530> and<00:00:42.799> a

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:42.860 
it because it made me as an adult and a

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.070 
it because it made me as an adult and a
teacher<00:00:43.420> familiar<00:00:44.420> with<00:00:44.600> the<00:00:44.750> science

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:45.080 
teacher familiar with the science

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.920 
teacher familiar with the science
content<00:00:45.229> area<00:00:45.799> actually<00:00:46.250> think<00:00:46.760> about<00:00:46.930> my

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:47.930 
content area actually think about my

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.039 
content area actually think about my
thought<00:00:48.199> process<00:00:48.710> and<00:00:49.150> my<00:00:50.150> knowledge<00:00:50.420> of<00:00:50.690> the

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:51.049 
thought process and my knowledge of the

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:53.320 
thought process and my knowledge of the
questions<00:00:51.440> that's<00:00:51.739> being<00:00:52.100> asked<00:00:52.699> and<00:00:53.119> so<00:00:53.299> I

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:53.330 
questions that's being asked and so I

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:54.520 
questions that's being asked and so I
thought<00:00:53.570> it<00:00:53.690> was<00:00:53.809> a<00:00:53.839> great<00:00:53.989> way<00:00:54.229> for<00:00:54.260> the

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
thought it was a great way for the

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.130 
thought it was a great way for the
students<00:00:55.010> to<00:00:55.159> actually<00:00:55.489> have<00:00:56.420> an<00:00:56.570> opportunity

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
students to actually have an opportunity

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.960 
students to actually have an opportunity
to<00:00:57.320> do<00:00:57.470> the<00:00:57.619> same<00:00:57.830> thing<00:00:58.070> and<00:00:58.309> I<00:00:58.369> can't<00:00:58.580> just<00:00:58.670> go

00:00:58.960 --> 00:00:58.970 
to do the same thing and I can't just go

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.630 
to do the same thing and I can't just go
on<00:00:59.000> I<00:00:59.390> don't<00:00:59.510> know<00:00:59.809> they<00:01:00.409> have<00:01:00.619> to<00:01:00.830> honestly

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
on I don't know they have to honestly

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.259 
on I don't know they have to honestly
think<00:01:01.970> about<00:01:02.299> their<00:01:03.430> thought<00:01:04.430> process<00:01:04.970> of

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:05.269 
think about their thought process of

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:08.500 
think about their thought process of
what<00:01:05.900> don't<00:01:06.170> they<00:01:06.380> know<00:01:07.030> one<00:01:08.030> thing<00:01:08.240> you<00:01:08.360> do

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 
what don't they know one thing you do

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.330 
what don't they know one thing you do
have<00:01:08.660> to<00:01:08.780> clarify<00:01:08.990> with<00:01:09.350> the<00:01:09.470> students<00:01:09.860> prior

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
have to clarify with the students prior

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.760 
have to clarify with the students prior
to<00:01:10.640> the<00:01:10.760> activity<00:01:11.270> is<00:01:11.420> that<00:01:12.020> if<00:01:12.200> you<00:01:12.320> hold<00:01:12.470> up<00:01:12.650> a

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
to the activity is that if you hold up a

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.160 
to the activity is that if you hold up a
fist<00:01:13.010> you're<00:01:13.430> not<00:01:13.610> hitting<00:01:13.760> the<00:01:13.910> clear<00:01:14.170> I'm

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
fist you're not hitting the clear I'm

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:16.690 
fist you're not hitting the clear I'm
not<00:01:15.380> only<00:01:15.560> going<00:01:15.770> to<00:01:15.860> choose<00:01:16.040> the<00:01:16.220> students

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
not only going to choose the students

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.970 
not only going to choose the students
that<00:01:17.360> are<00:01:17.420> holding<00:01:17.750> up<00:01:17.870> four<00:01:18.080> or<00:01:18.230> five<00:01:18.290> because

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:18.980 
that are holding up four or five because

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:20.350 
that are holding up four or five because
they're<00:01:19.160> confident<00:01:19.610> with<00:01:19.700> their<00:01:19.850> answers<00:01:20.180> I

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
they're confident with their answers I

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.180 
they're confident with their answers I
might<00:01:20.630> choose<00:01:20.840> a<00:01:20.900> student<00:01:21.350> with<00:01:21.500> a<00:01:21.530> fist<00:01:21.920> or

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:22.190
