a<00:03:05.970> little<00:03:06.270> bit<00:03:06.390> of<00:03:06.540> that<00:03:06.570> in<00:03:06.750> the<00:03:06.990> last

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
a little bit of that in the last

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.830 
a little bit of that in the last
preseason<00:03:07.650> game<00:03:08.040> his<00:03:08.490> conditioning<00:03:09.330> still

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
preseason game his conditioning still

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.500 
preseason game his conditioning still
isn't<00:03:10.170> quite<00:03:10.380> up<00:03:10.410> to<00:03:10.590> par<00:03:10.790> Jeremy's<00:03:11.790> isn't<00:03:12.150> and
