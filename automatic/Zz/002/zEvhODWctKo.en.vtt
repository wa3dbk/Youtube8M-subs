00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
can play and here's a games board I've

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.440 
can play and here's a games board I've
turned<00:00:46.469> into<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.920> snakes<00:00:47.550> and<00:00:47.730> ladders<00:00:47.820> game<00:00:48.059> I

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
turned into a snakes and ladders game I

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.029 
turned into a snakes and ladders game I
drew<00:00:48.840> in<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.110> snakes<00:00:49.379> and<00:00:49.500> ladders<00:00:49.649> in<00:00:49.950> the

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
drew in the snakes and ladders in the

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.580 
drew in the snakes and ladders in the
first<00:00:50.250> place<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:50.820> as<00:00:50.879> we're<00:00:51.870> going<00:00:52.020> along<00:00:52.170> if

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
first place and as we're going along if

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.220 
first place and as we're going along if
we<00:00:52.800> get<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:54.030> bottom<00:00:54.329> of<00:00:54.449> a<00:00:54.539> ladder<00:00:54.719> so<00:00:55.110> if

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
we get to the bottom of a ladder so if

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.500 
we get to the bottom of a ladder so if
we<00:00:55.350> land<00:00:55.530> on<00:00:55.649> number<00:00:55.920> 3<00:00:56.219> we'd<00:00:56.820> go<00:00:57.000> up<00:00:57.149> the

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
we land on number 3 we'd go up the

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.660 
we land on number 3 we'd go up the
ladder<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:57.989> number<00:00:58.260> 20<00:00:58.770> so<00:00:59.039> we<00:00:59.160> progress<00:00:59.430> along

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
ladder to number 20 so we progress along

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.900 
ladder to number 20 so we progress along
the<00:01:00.030> board<00:01:00.270> so<00:01:01.170> if<00:01:01.260> we<00:01:01.379> landed<00:01:01.649> on<00:01:01.770> 22<00:01:02.309> we'd<00:01:02.760> go

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
the board so if we landed on 22 we'd go

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.170 
the board so if we landed on 22 we'd go
up<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:03.210> 28<00:01:03.690> however<00:01:04.619> if<00:01:04.949> we<00:01:05.430> land<00:01:05.670> on<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.000> head

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
up to 28 however if we land on the head

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.140 
up to 28 however if we land on the head
of<00:01:06.299> a<00:01:06.390> snake<00:01:06.450> like<00:01:07.290> number<00:01:07.619> 21<00:01:08.189> we'd<00:01:08.790> slide

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
of a snake like number 21 we'd slide

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.870 
of a snake like number 21 we'd slide
down<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:10.170> snake<00:01:10.439> all<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.950> way<00:01:11.040> to<00:01:11.100> number<00:01:11.490> 7

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
down the snake all the way to number 7

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.870 
down the snake all the way to number 7
and<00:01:12.740> after<00:01:13.740> you<00:01:13.920> draw<00:01:14.189> in<00:01:14.340> all<00:01:14.460> your<00:01:14.610> snakes

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
and after you draw in all your snakes

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.130 
and after you draw in all your snakes
and<00:01:15.060> ladders<00:01:15.150> then<00:01:15.479> you<00:01:15.570> can<00:01:15.720> color<00:01:15.930> in<00:01:16.080> the

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
and ladders then you can color in the

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.170 
and ladders then you can color in the
background<00:01:16.560> as<00:01:17.070> you<00:01:17.220> see<00:01:17.460> I<00:01:17.670> haven't<00:01:17.970> quite

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
background as you see I haven't quite

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.770 
background as you see I haven't quite
finished<00:01:18.360> this<00:01:18.600> one<00:01:20.000> this<00:01:21.000> board<00:01:21.330> I've<00:01:21.570> just

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
finished this one this board I've just

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.570 
finished this one this board I've just
turned<00:01:22.020> into<00:01:22.200> an<00:01:22.380> ordinary<00:01:22.560> track<00:01:22.979> game<00:01:23.250> so

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
turned into an ordinary track game so

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.160 
turned into an ordinary track game so
we're<00:01:23.759> starting<00:01:24.000> our<00:01:24.330> counters<00:01:24.720> that<00:01:24.869> start

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
we're starting our counters that start

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.749 
we're starting our counters that start
at<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.470> start<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:26.040> then<00:01:26.159> we're<00:01:26.310> just<00:01:26.340> going

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
at the start and then we're just going

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.569 
at the start and then we're just going
along<00:01:27.060> but<00:01:27.720> you<00:01:28.380> throw<00:01:28.590> your<00:01:28.740> dice<00:01:28.979> or<00:01:29.250> spin

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
along but you throw your dice or spin

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.280 
along but you throw your dice or spin
your<00:01:29.759> spinner<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:30.450> if<00:01:30.600> you<00:01:30.720> land<00:01:30.930> on<00:01:31.079> one<00:01:31.229> of

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
your spinner and if you land on one of

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.870 
your spinner and if you land on one of
the<00:01:31.409> colored<00:01:31.710> squares<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:32.250> different<00:01:32.579> colors

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
the colored squares the different colors

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.969 
the colored squares the different colors
mean<00:01:33.270> you<00:01:33.509> do<00:01:33.659> different<00:01:34.049> things<00:01:34.079> so<00:01:34.740> for

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
mean you do different things so for

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.609 
mean you do different things so for
example<00:01:35.490> if<00:01:35.970> I<00:01:36.150> throw<00:01:36.390> a<00:01:36.420> 2<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:37.079> land<00:01:37.320> on<00:01:37.500> the

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
example if I throw a 2 and land on the

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.580 
example if I throw a 2 and land on the
purple<00:01:38.100> it<00:01:38.640> says<00:01:39.000> do<00:01:39.630> not<00:01:39.659> move<00:01:39.990> again<00:01:40.320> until

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
purple it says do not move again until

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.639 
purple it says do not move again until
you<00:01:40.680> throw<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:40.920> 6<00:01:41.280> if<00:01:42.270> I'd<00:01:42.509> landed<00:01:42.840> on<00:01:42.990> four<00:01:43.350> and

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
you throw a 6 if I'd landed on four and

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.370 
you throw a 6 if I'd landed on four and
got<00:01:43.860> pink<00:01:44.250> then<00:01:45.119> it<00:01:45.270> says<00:01:45.479> throw<00:01:45.750> again<00:01:46.079> so<00:01:46.350> I

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
got pink then it says throw again so I
