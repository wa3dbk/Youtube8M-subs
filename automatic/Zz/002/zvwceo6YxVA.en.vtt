00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
tree when you went in earlier do you

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.479 
tree when you went in earlier do you
like<00:00:31.740> it<00:00:32.090> yeah<00:00:33.090> it's<00:00:33.300> good<00:00:33.540> it<00:00:33.899> makes<00:00:34.140> you<00:00:34.489> feel

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
like it yeah it's good it makes you feel

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:36.979 
like it yeah it's good it makes you feel
a<00:00:35.550> bit<00:00:35.670> more<00:00:35.880> hungry<00:00:36.180> for<00:00:36.390> it<00:00:36.510> but<00:00:36.660> actually

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
a bit more hungry for it but actually

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.350 
a bit more hungry for it but actually
that<00:00:37.140> horse<00:00:37.410> told<00:00:37.770> earlier<00:00:38.160> it<00:00:38.820> doesn't<00:00:39.210> like

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
that horse told earlier it doesn't like

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.229 
that horse told earlier it doesn't like
noise<00:00:39.570> so<00:00:40.170> it's<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.680> bit<00:00:40.890> of<00:00:41.430> a<00:00:41.550> disaster<00:00:41.879> for

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
noise so it's a bit of a disaster for

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.520 
noise so it's a bit of a disaster for
that<00:00:42.420> one<00:00:42.600> but<00:00:42.809> it's<00:00:42.930> just<00:00:43.050> something<00:00:43.320> that

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
that one but it's just something that

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.889 
that one but it's just something that
all<00:00:43.649> have<00:00:43.860> to<00:00:44.010> get<00:00:44.160> used<00:00:44.340> to<00:00:44.550> and<00:00:44.870> you<00:00:45.870> just

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
all have to get used to and you just

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.900 
all have to get used to and you just
need<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.320> keep<00:00:46.440> jumping<00:00:46.800> in<00:00:47.070> these<00:00:47.190> rings<00:00:47.520> and

you get time to actually think in these
rings<00:00:53.239> not<00:00:54.239> in<00:00:54.390> these<00:00:54.570> small<00:00:54.870> rings<00:00:55.140> now<00:00:55.670> every
