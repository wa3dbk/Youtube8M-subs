00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:05.200
 hi to all with these two theses 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.620
 mobile.fr and I am currently 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.200
 so many 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.850
 of chiba watching a world 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.530
 which is quite interesting of his sorrow 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:14.710
 it's a prototype for the moment they 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:20.060
 call it the computer graphics h 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:21.439
 if jay walsh here there and then before before 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.400
 to watch it we will do a little 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:25.270
 quick point on what she is capable of 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.600
 to do now is another 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:30.430
 with an oled screen which processor arm 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:32.380
 and a lot of other elements 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.720
 interior sensus that allow 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:37.210
 to go big enough 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.829
 also to connect to android 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.210
 to your iphone is there 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:42.370
 more connected or gps your 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.649
 smartphone we see it here she has the 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.820
 possibility to recognize the pulsation 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:47.079
 of 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.930
 down to recognize that it's 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:51.790
 well you who use so 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.780
 it's beautiful it's interesting but what 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:56.170
 also interested is that she is 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.940
 able to detect incoming calls 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.080
 sms etc 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.960
 we will look a little at traders 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:04.739
 so here we have it with a bracelet in 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.159
 kind of leather 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.820
 sorry 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:10.690
 but here for example we see hal 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.440
 ah the 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.440
 the next appointment 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.060
 he had the device another threat 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.060
 displays the screen is touch 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.860
 so there uni fsa devices not like 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.020
 that I was not there so that's for 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.579
 what you have a screen shows this 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:33.030
 way there that you can customize 

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:33.030
 I also had it here 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.830
 I'm trying to see other nice screens 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.710
 so here it is and the envelopes 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.720
 like that and the smell check up at the checkouts 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.190
 and to check if it's okay 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.820
 it is you the owner 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.820
 check that 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.360
 doc 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.520
 you can have intense information 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.630
 and it's nice there's no built- in gps 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.980
 I personally find it 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.750
 is a little tall a little high 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:00.800
 I think on a wrist it's a bit 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:03.020
 complicated there we see here with 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.030
 like when incoming calls from a 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.350
 nobody you can pick up and so 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.940
 bluetooth sealer to your terminal 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.729
 you have a text that has just arrived 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.530
 that's what kind of thing what if we 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.569
 laonnois 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.069
 with m 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.569
 leave open I can not I can go 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:17.970
 much further 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:19.830
 there we are told 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.670
 with a black mask there too at the bottom 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.960
 but also grayer here I 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.470
 think we did pretty much the trick there 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.330
 is just 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.680
 it's on my screen there we see the 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.400
 messages sorry 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.400
 we not see much eh 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.610
 so that was it was a little we were a 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.080
 little preview of the toshiba prototype of 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.630
 smartphones at really a big 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.730
 trend today 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.320
 all manufacturers who starts 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.700
 make similar products not 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.870
 always always like that there is edge 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.540
 and who makes a product that is more 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.819
 near the 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.250
 ski sport activities and that's where we are 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:57.560
 more about a product a little more elegant 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.939
 who connects to your smartphone that 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.620
 which is supposed to give us 

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:02.200
 information about Roma and 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.269
 et cetera with a system of 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.010
 user recognition is 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:08.090
 interesting 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.409
 why a sense and proto so we 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.250
 do not know when they are 

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:11.299
 will be available 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.260
 will they even be available 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:14.430
 on the market 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.300
 and so that was just for you 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:19.630
 give a little overview 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:23.340
 toshiba's vision on smartphones 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.340
 connected with android and ios
