00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
and on the right hand side you've got a

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.569 
and on the right hand side you've got a
left-footer<00:03:20.440> so<00:03:20.859> you've<00:03:21.010> got<00:03:21.040> sort<00:03:21.340> of<00:03:21.459> a

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:21.579 
left-footer so you've got sort of a

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:23.400 
left-footer so you've got sort of a
shooting<00:03:21.940> threats<00:03:22.450> from<00:03:22.600> both<00:03:22.840> sides<00:03:23.170> and

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
shooting threats from both sides and

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.710 
shooting threats from both sides and
then<00:03:23.680> to<00:03:24.280> promoting<00:03:24.700> who's<00:03:25.390> just<00:03:25.540> going<00:03:25.660> to

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
then to promoting who's just going to

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.300 
then to promoting who's just going to
power<00:03:25.959> through<00:03:26.380> with<00:03:26.560> this<00:03:26.620> sort<00:03:26.859> of<00:03:26.890> aerial

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
power through with this sort of aerial

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.250 
power through with this sort of aerial
threat<00:03:27.579> and<00:03:27.790> strength<00:03:28.120> ability<00:03:28.569> so<00:03:28.840> yeah<00:03:28.989> he's

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
threat and strength ability so yeah he's

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.890 
threat and strength ability so yeah he's
also<00:03:29.500> midfield<00:03:30.190> is<00:03:30.310> great<00:03:30.549> too<00:03:30.850> I<00:03:31.060> guess<00:03:31.720> it's

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
also midfield is great too I guess it's

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.720 
also midfield is great too I guess it's
a<00:03:31.959> little<00:03:32.079> bit<00:03:32.380> of<00:03:32.410> a<00:03:32.650> defensive<00:03:33.100> formation

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
a little bit of a defensive formation

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.240 
a little bit of a defensive formation
but<00:03:34.090> it<00:03:34.239> just<00:03:34.390> allows<00:03:34.780> I<00:03:35.260> guess<00:03:35.799> especially

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
but it just allows I guess especially

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.400 
but it just allows I guess especially
with<00:03:36.579> a<00:03:36.609> 10,000<00:03:37.180> point<00:03:37.359> team<00:03:37.630> you<00:03:38.079> want<00:03:38.200> a

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
with a 10,000 point team you want a

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.140 
with a 10,000 point team you want a
little<00:03:38.680> bit<00:03:38.920> of<00:03:38.950> like<00:03:39.190> rigidity<00:03:39.790> of<00:03:39.880> the<00:03:39.910> back

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
little bit of like rigidity of the back

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.030 
little bit of like rigidity of the back
so<00:03:40.450> it's<00:03:40.750> good<00:03:40.930> i<00:03:41.079> like<00:03:41.290> it<00:03:41.530> and<00:03:41.650> then

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
so it's good i like it and then

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.470 
so it's good i like it and then
obviously<00:03:42.220> your<00:03:42.549> norm<00:03:42.940> in<00:03:43.060> the<00:03:43.150> right<00:03:43.299> back

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480
