just<00:02:20.730> don't<00:02:20.820> want<00:02:21.000> to<00:02:21.030> touch<00:02:21.210> it<00:02:21.270> again

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
just don't want to touch it again

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.690 
just don't want to touch it again
because<00:02:21.690> every<00:02:21.990> time<00:02:22.020> i<00:02:22.230> go<00:02:23.130> back<00:02:23.280> to<00:02:23.340> try<00:02:23.640> to

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
because every time i go back to try to

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.820 
because every time i go back to try to
make<00:02:24.030> it<00:02:24.060> perfect<00:02:24.780> and<00:02:24.930> I<00:02:25.050> just<00:02:25.170> fuck<00:02:25.470> it<00:02:25.500> up<00:02:25.680> a

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
make it perfect and I just fuck it up a

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.980 
make it perfect and I just fuck it up a
bunch<00:02:26.040> so<00:02:26.420> it's<00:02:27.420> a<00:02:28.940> this<00:02:29.940> the<00:02:30.270> hollow<00:02:30.480> grind<00:02:30.750> is

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
bunch so it's a this the hollow grind is

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.600 
bunch so it's a this the hollow grind is
a<00:02:31.130> a<00:02:32.780> 165<00:02:33.780> Gator<00:02:34.680> belt<00:02:34.980> finished<00:02:35.400> with<00:02:35.520> the

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
a a 165 Gator belt finished with the

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.580 
a a 165 Gator belt finished with the
scotch<00:02:35.850> brite<00:02:36.060> and<00:02:36.300> the<00:02:36.360> flats<00:02:36.630> or<00:02:36.840> 120<00:02:37.410> grit

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
scotch brite and the flats or 120 grit

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.040 
scotch brite and the flats or 120 grit
finished<00:02:38.220> with<00:02:38.340> the<00:02:38.400> scouts<00:02:38.580> right<00:02:38.960> and<00:02:39.960> i

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
finished with the scouts right and i

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.840 
finished with the scouts right and i
think<00:02:40.260> it's<00:02:40.380> just<00:02:40.560> absolutely<00:02:41.100> gorgeous<00:02:41.310> kind

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
think it's just absolutely gorgeous kind

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.699 
think it's just absolutely gorgeous kind
of<00:02:41.880> hard<00:02:42.030> to<00:02:42.330> get<00:02:42.870> with<00:02:43.020> the<00:02:43.050> lighting<00:02:43.590> that's

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
of hard to get with the lighting that's

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.490 
of hard to get with the lighting that's
now<00:02:43.980> it's<00:02:44.610> kind<00:02:44.820> of<00:02:44.880> a<00:02:45.030> kind<00:02:45.930> of<00:02:46.020> a<00:02:46.080> cloudy<00:02:46.350> day

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
now it's kind of a kind of a cloudy day

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.970 
now it's kind of a kind of a cloudy day
right<00:02:46.890> now<00:02:47.780> so<00:02:48.780> pretty<00:02:49.500> good<00:02:49.740> lighting

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
right now so pretty good lighting

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.060 
right now so pretty good lighting
supposedly<00:02:50.700> for<00:02:51.030> knives<00:02:51.480> but<00:02:51.990> this<00:02:52.860> one's

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
supposedly for knives but this one's

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:54.830 
supposedly for knives but this one's
just<00:02:53.160> really<00:02:53.640> hard<00:02:53.820> to<00:02:54.000> get<00:02:54.120> good<00:02:54.180> lighting<00:02:54.600> on

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
just really hard to get good lighting on

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.730 
just really hard to get good lighting on
so<00:02:55.140> I<00:02:55.170> thought<00:02:55.380> I<00:02:55.440> would<00:02:55.850> do<00:02:56.850> a<00:02:56.880> video<00:02:57.240> instead

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:57.740 
so I thought I would do a video instead

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.720 
so I thought I would do a video instead
this<00:02:58.740> one's<00:02:58.950> just<00:02:59.010> going<00:02:59.250> to<00:02:59.310> get<00:02:59.370> a<00:02:59.430> straight

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
this one's just going to get a straight

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.610 
this one's just going to get a straight
handle<00:03:00.090> like<00:03:00.240> this<00:03:00.950> Japanese<00:03:01.950> tanto<00:03:02.870> or<00:03:03.870> not

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
handle like this Japanese tanto or not

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.920 
handle like this Japanese tanto or not
Japanese<00:03:05.190> well<00:03:05.670> kind<00:03:06.060> of<00:03:06.240> i<00:03:06.450> mean<00:03:06.630> the<00:03:06.720> shape

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
Japanese well kind of i mean the shape

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.560 
Japanese well kind of i mean the shape
is<00:03:07.170> like<00:03:07.950> a<00:03:08.010> traditional<00:03:08.550> japanese<00:03:09.000> tanto<00:03:09.390> but

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
is like a traditional japanese tanto but

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:13.520 
is like a traditional japanese tanto but
the<00:03:09.660> grind<00:03:09.930> is<00:03:10.140> like<00:03:10.530> a<00:03:10.560> lump<00:03:10.890> tonto<00:03:12.470> how<00:03:13.470> he

the grind is like a lump tonto how he
always<00:03:13.769> did<00:03:14.010> his<00:03:14.190> but<00:03:14.550> this<00:03:14.730> is<00:03:14.790> the<00:03:14.850> first

really<00:03:16.800> happy<00:03:17.130> with<00:03:17.370> how<00:03:17.400> it<00:03:17.519> turned<00:03:17.610> out<00:03:17.880> like

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
really happy with how it turned out like

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.470 
really happy with how it turned out like
grind<00:03:18.720> lines<00:03:18.989> are<00:03:19.230> like<00:03:19.470> spot-on<00:03:20.330> plunges<00:03:21.330> are

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
grind lines are like spot-on plunges are

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:27.710 
grind lines are like spot-on plunges are
pretty<00:03:21.959> even<00:03:25.670> so<00:03:26.670> does<00:03:26.850> a<00:03:26.880> little<00:03:27.510> bit<00:03:27.630> of

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
pretty even so does a little bit of

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.870 
pretty even so does a little bit of
waiver<00:03:27.900> to<00:03:28.050> the<00:03:28.200> grind<00:03:28.440> line<00:03:28.650> but<00:03:29.010> i'm<00:03:29.820> just

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
waiver to the grind line but i'm just

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.150 
waiver to the grind line but i'm just
super<00:03:30.690> happy<00:03:30.810> with<00:03:31.019> it<00:03:31.230> overall<00:03:31.500> this<00:03:32.040> is

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
super happy with it overall this is

super happy with it overall this is
going<00:03:32.310> to<00:03:32.370> be<00:03:32.489> awesome<00:03:32.750> nice<00:03:33.750> nice<00:03:34.350> ample

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
think this thing's going to turn out

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.670 
think this thing's going to turn out
amazingly<00:03:41.400> well<00:03:41.640> and<00:03:42.290> since<00:03:43.290> these<00:03:43.440> are<00:03:43.500> all

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
amazingly well and since these are all

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.410 
amazingly well and since these are all
hardened<00:03:44.100> already<00:03:44.489> just<00:03:44.850> need<00:03:45.000> to<00:03:45.090> temper

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
hardened already just need to temper

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.320 
hardened already just need to temper
them<00:03:45.570> a<00:03:45.600> bit<00:03:45.860> and<00:03:46.860> I<00:03:47.100> have<00:03:47.280> carbide<00:03:47.940> bits<00:03:48.150> to

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
them a bit and I have carbide bits to

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:49.640 
them a bit and I have carbide bits to
drill<00:03:48.570> with<00:03:48.780> I'm<00:03:48.959> going<00:03:49.080> to<00:03:49.140> get<00:03:49.260> some

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
drill with I'm going to get some

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.090 
drill with I'm going to get some
correctly<00:03:50.459> sized<00:03:50.760> ones<00:03:51.709> with<00:03:52.709> my<00:03:52.860> mil

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
correctly sized ones with my mil

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.100 
correctly sized ones with my mil
drilling<00:03:53.610> hardened<00:03:54.000> steel<00:03:54.269> is<00:03:54.480> not<00:03:54.660> a<00:03:54.720> problem

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
drilling hardened steel is not a problem

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:59.930 
drilling hardened steel is not a problem
at<00:03:55.230> all<00:03:55.320> so<00:03:57.470> I'm<00:03:58.470> gonna<00:03:58.670> going<00:03:59.670> to<00:03:59.760> finish

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
at all so I'm gonna going to finish

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.340 
at all so I'm gonna going to finish
these<00:04:00.209> up<00:04:00.269> I<00:04:00.630> think<00:04:00.810> this<00:04:00.959> one<00:04:01.170> will<00:04:01.230> probably

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350 
these up I think this one will probably

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.710 
these up I think this one will probably
get<00:04:01.620> a<00:04:01.680> wood<00:04:01.920> handle<00:04:02.370> possibly<00:04:03.120> a<00:04:03.150> wood<00:04:03.420> sheet

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
get a wood handle possibly a wood sheet

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.250 
get a wood handle possibly a wood sheet
to<00:04:03.989> go<00:04:04.110> with<00:04:04.380> it<00:04:04.410> we'll<00:04:04.830> see<00:04:05.810> but<00:04:06.810> they'll<00:04:07.170> be

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
to go with it we'll see but they'll be

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.570 
to go with it we'll see but they'll be
up<00:04:07.440> on<00:04:07.590> gear<00:04:07.830> Bastion<00:04:08.190> when<00:04:08.310> they're<00:04:08.430> finished

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:08.580 
up on gear Bastion when they're finished

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.420
