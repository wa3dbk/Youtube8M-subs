00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.320
 their oysters but their boats are brought to their land the eggs 

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:06.839
 Machine alone by a political is so we have the reinforced 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:08.910
 arranged here from the airport 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.129
 these are the yellow pages of Jennings 

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:13.749
 that bothered the machine 

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:15.139
 Percent 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:18.999
 with the engines running for another year as long as the engines run away 

00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:19.770
 his engines 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.390
 then drive the plane itself are the markets 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:23.880
 also not be pulled 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.119
 when the planes 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:28.380
 the engines that are turned off from the engine 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.239
 then it has to be pulled 

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:33.239
 after the pilot but only on the 8th on a safe leash 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.370
 otherwise, he stepped there then he is driving 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.940
 I thought that the drink at the paddock happened and the spectacular looks 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.980
 is that always so that there is someone else 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.100
 behind a waterfall year alone is the case 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:51.370
 Roth it can also be one in one that none of us the black one 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.600
 since they brought divers or something 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.140
 I do not think that one of them is Caribbean 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.490
 everything looks like that so one is swimming 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:07.330
 Who seems to be an employee of the technical relief organization 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.330
 we want to try now on the machines 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.950
 to draw 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.040
 but that also looks like the case of the events has gone well 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.890
 Samsonov have experienced it before 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.310
 No, I have so if that is the case that no autopilot has gone 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.950
 then they have just experienced 450 years or champagne since the last war 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.980
 that the machine comes to an end for the first time 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.810
 People had rescued from distress in the scene Not what s sei sei sei 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.120
 not so bad 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.630
 but that is really something special 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.439
 And by the way, it actually happened that the ocean was running 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:48.340
 I'll decide where to sing along 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.010
 to have been clear or to me these wishes the we and they all requirements 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.159
 or parking garages brought water to the St 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:57.380
 is a 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.560
 ambulance 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.380
 nobody was out of one 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.430
 the plane would not be a problem either 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.359
 there is no dinghy here 

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:11.009
 Drive to a serious capsized 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.979
 and drives now without 

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:16.379
 without crew then 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:20.059
 then I do not want to disturb her taking photos anymore 

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:21.459
 with the beautiful 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.319
 Scenery of the Cologne Cathedral in winter and we from here samples of investors 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:29.339
 can see beautiful 

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:30.059
 how is it going now?
