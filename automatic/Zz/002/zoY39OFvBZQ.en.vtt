sandy base this is why the hole in the
middle<00:04:07.739> of<00:04:07.920> the<00:04:08.010> base<00:04:08.160> was<00:04:08.400> important<00:04:08.849> so<00:04:08.910> the

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
middle of the base was important so the

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.300 
middle of the base was important so the
little<00:04:09.390> bit<00:04:09.510> of<00:04:09.660> extra<00:04:09.959> fiber<00:04:10.380> optics<00:04:10.890> cable

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
little bit of extra fiber optics cable

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:19.069 
little bit of extra fiber optics cable
has<00:04:11.459> some<00:04:11.640> place<00:04:11.790> to<00:04:11.849> go<00:04:17.690> you'll<00:04:18.690> want<00:04:18.959> the

has some place to go you'll want the

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:20.659 
has some place to go you'll want the
truck<00:04:19.320> pieces<00:04:19.709> towards<00:04:19.980> the<00:04:20.100> bottom<00:04:20.400> to<00:04:20.549> be

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
truck pieces towards the bottom to be

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:22.190 
truck pieces towards the bottom to be
spaced<00:04:20.940> closer<00:04:21.209> together<00:04:21.480> than<00:04:21.900> the<00:04:22.019> ones

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
spaced closer together than the ones

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.900 
spaced closer together than the ones
towards<00:04:22.530> the<00:04:22.680> top<00:04:22.889> so<00:04:23.160> the<00:04:23.280> whole<00:04:23.430> tree<00:04:23.700> can

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
towards the top so the whole tree can

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:25.640 
towards the top so the whole tree can
lean<00:04:24.090> over<00:04:24.120> more<00:04:24.570> gradually<00:04:25.110> that's<00:04:25.410> it
