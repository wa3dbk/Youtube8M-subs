00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600 
now we're fortunate to get some runs

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.690 
now we're fortunate to get some runs
against<00:00:03.990> bangladesh<00:00:04.589> and<00:00:04.620> you<00:00:05.190> know<00:00:05.310> having

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
against bangladesh and you know having

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.210 
against bangladesh and you know having
played<00:00:06.000> here<00:00:06.270> as<00:00:06.390> well<00:00:06.629> so<00:00:06.690> getting<00:00:07.589> gotten

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
played here as well so getting gotten

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.259 
played here as well so getting gotten
used<00:00:08.460> to<00:00:08.639> the<00:00:08.730> conditions<00:00:09.590> quite<00:00:10.590> quickly<00:00:11.269> so

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
used to the conditions quite quickly so

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:13.549 
used to the conditions quite quickly so
i<00:00:12.300> think<00:00:12.509> we<00:00:12.690> cannot<00:00:12.870> draw<00:00:13.110> that<00:00:13.290> type<00:00:13.530> of

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
i think we cannot draw that type of

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.790 
i think we cannot draw that type of
experience<00:00:14.160> to<00:00:14.400> take<00:00:15.210> us<00:00:15.330> to<00:00:15.480> the<00:00:15.599> seas<00:00:15.839> and<00:00:16.289> it

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
experience to take us to the seas and it

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.200 
experience to take us to the seas and it
really<00:00:16.949> helps<00:00:17.250> with<00:00:17.340> the<00:00:17.369> t20<00:00:17.850> guys<00:00:18.029> it

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
really helps with the t20 guys it

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.519 
really helps with the t20 guys it
extremely<00:00:18.539> well<00:00:18.690> so<00:00:18.930> i<00:00:18.990> think<00:00:19.050> for<00:00:19.289> the<00:00:19.350> rest

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
extremely well so i think for the rest

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:20.689 
extremely well so i think for the rest
of<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.770> team<00:00:19.980> they<00:00:20.189> come<00:00:20.430> with<00:00:20.550> some

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
of the team they come with some

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.740 
of the team they come with some

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
happened a couple of days ago they

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.390 
happened a couple of days ago they
getting<00:00:28.080> into<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.410> one<00:00:28.560> again<00:00:28.859> I<00:00:29.010> don't

getting into the one again I don't
thinks<00:00:29.640> I<00:00:29.730> think<00:00:29.910> everybody's<00:00:30.359> had<00:00:30.570> enough

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
thinks I think everybody's had enough

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.930 
thinks I think everybody's had enough
corporation<00:00:31.410> couple<00:00:32.250> of<00:00:32.340> us<00:00:32.489> who<00:00:32.640> have<00:00:32.759> come

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
corporation couple of us who have come

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.600 
corporation couple of us who have come
in<00:00:33.120> for<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.450> OD<00:00:33.600> is<00:00:33.840> we<00:00:34.829> had<00:00:34.920> good<00:00:35.370> training

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
in for the OD is we had good training

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.250 
in for the OD is we had good training
sessions<00:00:36.149> over<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.570> last<00:00:36.750> two<00:00:36.960> or<00:00:36.989> three<00:00:37.110> days

sessions over the last two or three days

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.770 
sessions over the last two or three days
and<00:00:38.250> i<00:00:38.370> think<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.610> t20<00:00:39.059> guys<00:00:39.239> have<00:00:39.420> had<00:00:39.510> enough

and i think the t20 guys have had enough

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:40.880 
and i think the t20 guys have had enough
training<00:00:39.960> side<00:00:40.290> i<00:00:40.320> don't<00:00:40.500> think<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.710> weather

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
training side i don't think the weather

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.270 
training side i don't think the weather
have<00:00:41.040> any<00:00:41.579> any<00:00:42.510> any<00:00:42.660> effective<00:00:43.410> hampering<00:00:44.160> our

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
have any any any effective hampering our

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.950 
have any any any effective hampering our
population<00:00:44.879> well<00:00:45.239> certainly<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.600> a<00:00:45.690> team

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
population well certainly the a team

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.240 
population well certainly the a team
that<00:00:46.110> has<00:00:46.140> been<00:00:46.379> doing<00:00:46.590> well<00:00:46.710> over<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.100> last

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
that has been doing well over the last

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.000 
that has been doing well over the last
couple<00:00:47.760> of<00:00:47.940> months<00:00:48.090> or<00:00:48.360> maybe<00:00:48.570> year<00:00:48.960> i<00:00:49.739> think

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
couple of months or maybe year i think

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.830 
couple of months or maybe year i think
they<00:00:50.309> there<00:00:50.730> one<00:00:50.879> day<00:00:51.030> records<00:00:51.480> a<00:00:51.570> lot<00:00:51.719> better

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
they there one day records a lot better

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
of our bali attack there's a lot a lot

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.740 
of our bali attack there's a lot a lot
of<00:01:01.649> new<00:01:01.770> guys<00:01:01.980> you<00:01:02.969> know<00:01:03.090> Dale<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.539> male

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
of new guys you know Dale and male

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.250 
of new guys you know Dale and male
Dale's<00:01:04.680> not<00:01:04.949> around<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.850> further<00:01:06.119> as<00:01:06.360> well<00:01:06.600> so

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
Dale's not around and further as well so

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.320 
Dale's not around and further as well so
it<00:01:07.439> gives<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.860> chance<00:01:07.890> for<00:01:08.250> guys<00:01:08.580> like<00:01:08.760> robotic

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
it gives a chance for guys like robotic

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.210 
it gives a chance for guys like robotic
Chris<00:01:09.570> Morris<00:01:11.210> Kyle<00:01:12.210> Abbott<00:01:12.360> guys<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:13.320> give<00:01:14.100> it

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
Chris Morris Kyle Abbott guys to give it

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.580 
Chris Morris Kyle Abbott guys to give it
gives<00:01:14.700> them<00:01:14.850> a<00:01:15.000> chance<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.479> make<00:01:15.960> you<00:01:16.350> get<00:01:16.560> a

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
gives them a chance to make you get a

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:17.960 
gives them a chance to make you get a
few<00:01:16.770> games<00:01:16.920> under<00:01:17.159> their<00:01:17.369> belt<00:01:17.580> so<00:01:17.820> I<00:01:17.850> think

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
few games under their belt so I think

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.999 
few games under their belt so I think
that's<00:01:18.150> really<00:01:18.299> exciting<00:01:18.689> for<00:01:18.900> us<00:01:19.049> obviously

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
that's really exciting for us obviously

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.679 
that's really exciting for us obviously
abies<00:01:20.520> not<00:01:20.700> around<00:01:20.939> so<00:01:21.150> it<00:01:21.240> gives<00:01:21.390> a<00:01:21.570> better

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
abies not around so it gives a better

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.570 
abies not around so it gives a better
than<00:01:22.020> opportunity<00:01:22.680> so<00:01:22.799> i<00:01:22.860> think<00:01:22.920> this<00:01:23.280> type<00:01:23.549> of

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
than opportunity so i think this type of

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.910 
than opportunity so i think this type of
thing<00:01:23.970> is<00:01:24.420> very<00:01:24.479> healthy<00:01:24.930> especially<00:01:25.200> after<00:01:25.740> a

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
thing is very healthy especially after a

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.800 
thing is very healthy especially after a
long<00:01:26.159> season<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:26.850> what<00:01:27.150> a<00:01:27.180> long<00:01:27.390> season<00:01:27.600> to

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
long season and what a long season to

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.020 
long season and what a long season to
come<00:01:27.960> so<00:01:28.320> are<00:01:29.100> you<00:01:29.340> going<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.549> see<00:01:29.670> some<00:01:29.820> fresh

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
come so are you going to see some fresh

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.670 
come so are you going to see some fresh
faces<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.630> i<00:01:30.689> think<00:01:30.840> that's<00:01:30.990> really<00:01:31.170> nice<00:01:31.409> for

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
faces and i think that's really nice for

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.890 
faces and i think that's really nice for
me<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:32.400> way<00:01:32.490> i<00:01:32.520> see<00:01:32.880> it<00:01:32.909> is<00:01:33.119> ODI<00:01:33.479> cricket<00:01:33.570> at

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.810 
me the way i see it is ODI cricket at
the<00:01:33.960> moment<00:01:34.259> is<00:01:34.320> gonna<00:01:34.470> be<00:01:34.590> a<00:01:34.619> lot<00:01:34.799> more<00:01:34.860> for<00:01:35.310> a

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
the moment is gonna be a lot more for a

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.090 
the moment is gonna be a lot more for a
transitional<00:01:36.630> phase<00:01:36.840> suddenly<00:01:37.799> there's<00:01:37.950> new

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
transitional phase suddenly there's new
