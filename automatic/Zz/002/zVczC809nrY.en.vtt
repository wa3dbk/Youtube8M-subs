already have products which are exactly

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.160 
already have products which are exactly
similar<00:01:35.579> to<00:01:35.790> this<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.119> buy<00:01:36.329> exactly<00:01:36.509> similar

I<00:01:37.439> mean<00:01:37.680> exactly<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.280> same<00:01:38.460> only<00:01:38.729> bigger<00:01:39.030> or

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.580 
I mean exactly the same only bigger or
smaller<00:01:39.329> because<00:01:39.720> that's<00:01:39.930> what<00:01:40.110> Apple<00:01:40.380> do

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
smaller because that's what Apple do

smaller because that's what Apple do
they<00:01:40.799> have<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.040> exact<00:01:41.369> same<00:01:41.549> thing<00:01:41.850> and<00:01:42.060> then

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
they have the exact same thing and then

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:43.969 
they have the exact same thing and then
they<00:01:42.600> make<00:01:42.720> a<00:01:42.750> new<00:01:43.049> thing<00:01:43.320> with<00:01:43.560> a<00:01:43.619> tiny

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
they make a new thing with a tiny

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.560 
they make a new thing with a tiny
feature<00:01:44.430> which<00:01:44.970> doesn't<00:01:45.240> really<00:01:45.329> make<00:01:45.509> a

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
feature which doesn't really make a

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.179 
feature which doesn't really make a
single<00:01:45.899> difference<00:01:46.380> want<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:46.829> use<00:01:46.920> internet
