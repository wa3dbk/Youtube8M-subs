00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:07.929
 hello I was at a new video for 

00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:09.759
 you and that I thought I show 

00:00:07.929 --> 00:00:12.280
 again a basic to the topic 

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:15.039
 make up and do it like her lipstick 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:17.650
 can apply properly and for that 

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:19.360
 Of course you need a lipstick 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.450
 in that have your choice 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.450
 I have a bright red 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:27.450
 selected it from who the 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:30.790
 number 07 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.900
 and he really nice gaudy red with it 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:34.600
 her course well recognize the 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:37.720
 can and you need to match the 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:41.200
 color of your lipstick one more 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:43.230
 lipliner I have from eating the 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:47.649
 number 10 taken 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:50.130
 also just quite gaudy red and 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:53.140
 so that the whole keeps a little better 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:55.000
 you need a base in the before 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.280
 on your lips order what we can 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.899
 there simply take more time for dubai 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:03.850
 one also from essens and all the way to 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:05.379
 I would recommend beginning with expensive 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.430
 my with a moisturizer 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.170
 einzucremen 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.390
 then she will not be so stressed and 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.870
 be tracked and this just the 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.760
 normal events occur so me 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:19.320
 start now in which I have my lips 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.320
 only a little one chandler 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:31.210
 and next I'll wear the eyeshadow 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:34.120
 base on my lips on top of that 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.610
 Lipstick after longer lasts for this 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:38.680
 just a little bit on the lips 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.100
 dab and make nice with the finger 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.100
 rub 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:02:00.360
 in the next step I draw with 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.440
 my lipliner has the shape of a lip 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:06.440
 here we have a strong contour 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.910
 That's best done in small ones 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:12.390
 do not draw and draw a whole line 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:16.670
 By doing so you can change the shape of the lips 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.670
 move much better 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.920
 that does not look very special right now 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.180
 nice but in the next step you can 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.710
 you already start yours 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.630
 apply lipstick 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:49.860
 Here I start on the lower lip 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:51.720
 and then rub my upper lip on it and 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.360
 they are not color yet 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:58.260
 then have gotten I paint still 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:00.090
 time with the lipstick and now 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.890
 you can also brush a lip brush 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.170
 Use it in different ways 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:07.440
 sizes i have a pretty wide 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.570
 and I use it with the border 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.880
 the lips does not look that tough and 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:13.800
 a little bit crossfades here 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.870
 he just sells it with your lips 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:23.040
 brush the contours little in the middle 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:24.660
 in the middle of your lips and clean 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.310
 are you already finished and have 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.590
 a beautiful evenly 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:31.100
 applied lipstick the very long 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.100
 keeps
