then<00:01:56.680> it<00:01:56.950> was<00:01:57.130> really<00:01:57.460> hard<00:01:57.640> too<00:01:57.729> fast<00:01:57.759> expand

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
then it was really hard too fast expand

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.080 
then it was really hard too fast expand
and<00:01:59.070> apparently<00:02:00.070> figured<00:02:00.310> that<00:02:00.399> out<00:02:00.430> yet<00:02:00.580> so

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
and apparently figured that out yet so

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.219 
and apparently figured that out yet so
they<00:02:01.210> would<00:02:01.300> just<00:02:01.330> have<00:02:01.570> that<00:02:01.750> wall<00:02:01.899> the<00:02:02.080> top

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:05.490 
they would just have that wall the top
there<00:02:02.380> and<00:02:02.500> make<00:02:02.649> sure<00:02:02.680> they<00:02:02.860> hold<00:02:03.070> um<00:02:04.500> you

know in against terran players you don't

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.240 
know in against terran players you don't

really need a walker no melee units with

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:10.650 
really need a walker no melee units with
sometimes<00:02:09.520> but<00:02:09.850> it's<00:02:10.060> still<00:02:10.270> wall<00:02:10.479> up<00:02:10.600> there

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
sometimes but it's still wall up there

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.180 
sometimes but it's still wall up there
people<00:02:11.320> figured<00:02:11.560> out<00:02:11.620> pretty<00:02:11.739> quick<00:02:12.040> though

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
people figured out pretty quick though

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.560 
people figured out pretty quick though
you're<00:02:12.400> pretty<00:02:12.550> vulnerable<00:02:12.760> to<00:02:13.209> Marauder

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.570 
you're pretty vulnerable to Marauder

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:15.240 
you're pretty vulnerable to Marauder
fire<00:02:13.900> anything<00:02:14.350> on<00:02:14.440> the<00:02:14.530> ground<00:02:14.709> attacking<00:02:15.160> up

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
fire anything on the ground attacking up

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.150 
fire anything on the ground attacking up
on<00:02:15.370> you<00:02:15.489> same<00:02:16.239> is<00:02:16.390> true<00:02:16.420> pros<00:02:16.780> vs<00:02:17.530> protoss<00:02:17.739> so

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
on you same is true pros vs protoss so

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.190 
on you same is true pros vs protoss so
that's<00:02:18.489> completely<00:02:19.239> out<00:02:19.390> of<00:02:19.420> style<00:02:19.720> now<00:02:19.959> and

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
that's completely out of style now and

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.590 
that's completely out of style now and
the<00:02:21.010> only<00:02:21.160> thing<00:02:21.220> you<00:02:21.489> gain<00:02:22.030> in<00:02:22.209> the<00:02:22.299> match<00:02:22.450> of

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
the only thing you gain in the match of

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.420 
the only thing you gain in the match of
if<00:02:22.690> you<00:02:22.780> do<00:02:22.959> that<00:02:23.110> otherwise<00:02:23.470> is<00:02:23.890> that<00:02:24.070> you<00:02:24.190> get

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
if you do that otherwise is that you get

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.100 
if you do that otherwise is that you get
your<00:02:24.459> units<00:02:25.000> out<00:02:25.150> a<00:02:25.180> little<00:02:25.480> bit<00:02:25.630> faster

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
your units out a little bit faster

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.530 
your units out a little bit faster
towards<00:02:26.380> your<00:02:26.500> opponent's<00:02:26.830> base<00:02:26.980> but<00:02:27.360> it's<00:02:28.360> a

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
towards your opponent's base but it's a

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.420 
towards your opponent's base but it's a
very<00:02:28.570> negligible<00:02:29.560> difference<00:02:29.980> and<00:02:30.130> it<00:02:30.190> cost

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
very negligible difference and it cost

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.009 
very negligible difference and it cost
you<00:02:30.580> a<00:02:30.640> lot<00:02:30.760> more<00:02:30.820> money<00:02:31.180> to<00:02:31.330> send<00:02:31.690> the<00:02:31.810> probe

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:32.019 
you a lot more money to send the probe

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:33.210 
you a lot more money to send the probe
all<00:02:32.230> the<00:02:32.470> way<00:02:32.560> over<00:02:32.769> there<00:02:32.799> to<00:02:32.920> make<00:02:33.040> your

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
all the way over there to make your

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.350 
all the way over there to make your
structures<00:02:33.549> and<00:02:33.580> send<00:02:33.850> it<00:02:33.940> all<00:02:34.030> the<00:02:34.150> way<00:02:34.209> back

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
structures and send it all the way back

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.410 
structures and send it all the way back
so

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
so

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.270 
so
something<00:02:37.260> that<00:02:37.349> kind<00:02:37.530> of<00:02:37.590> fill<00:02:37.770> out<00:02:37.890> a<00:02:37.920> style

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
something that kind of fill out a style

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.780 
something that kind of fill out a style
for<00:02:38.520> many<00:02:39.150> reasons<00:02:39.569> yeah<00:02:40.520> now<00:02:41.520> we<00:02:41.580> have

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
for many reasons yeah now we have

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.910 
for many reasons yeah now we have
parting<00:02:42.209> throwing<00:02:42.510> down<00:02:42.660> the<00:02:42.780> Stargate<00:02:43.319> it's

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
parting throwing down the Stargate it's

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.729 
parting throwing down the Stargate it's
a<00:02:44.160> almost<00:02:44.970> there<00:02:45.290> probably<00:02:46.290> going<00:02:46.380> to<00:02:46.470> be<00:02:46.560> for

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
a almost there probably going to be for

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:48.410 
a almost there probably going to be for
an<00:02:46.830> Oracle<00:02:47.190> it<00:02:47.370> is<00:02:47.580> on<00:02:47.730> the<00:02:47.849> corner<00:02:48.120> that<00:02:48.360> is

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
an Oracle it is on the corner that is

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.660 
an Oracle it is on the corner that is
close<00:02:48.810> to<00:02:48.840> son<00:02:49.260> so<00:02:49.680> that's<00:02:49.830> good<00:02:50.069> for<00:02:50.250> him

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670

tightly council coming up here for

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:01.020 
tightly council coming up here for
Shawne<00:02:58.290> I'll<00:02:59.290> see<00:02:59.530> how<00:02:59.680> good<00:03:00.010> he<00:03:00.070> responds<00:03:00.790> to

base three gateways blink it's going to

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.120 
base three gateways blink it's going to
be<00:03:27.070> a<00:03:27.100> much<00:03:27.370> more<00:03:28.380> successful<00:03:29.380> blinkin<00:03:30.010> i

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
be a much more successful blinkin i

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:31.229 
be a much more successful blinkin i
would<00:03:30.310> say<00:03:30.520> than<00:03:30.730> what<00:03:30.760> we<00:03:30.940> saw<00:03:31.090> in<00:03:31.209> the

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 
would say than what we saw in the

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:33.360 
would say than what we saw in the
previous<00:03:31.540> game<00:03:31.780> this<00:03:32.470> Oracle<00:03:32.860> is<00:03:33.010> actually

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
previous game this Oracle is actually

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.050 
previous game this Oracle is actually
going<00:03:33.489> to<00:03:33.580> see<00:03:33.730> that<00:03:33.880> pylon<00:03:34.090> I<00:03:34.239> think<00:03:34.570> oh<00:03:34.780> I

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
going to see that pylon I think oh I

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.250 
going to see that pylon I think oh I
don't<00:03:37.060> think<00:03:37.180> he<00:03:37.239> saw<00:03:37.420> the<00:03:37.480> white<00:03:38.050> yeah<00:03:38.230> I

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
don't think he saw the white yeah I

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.930 
don't think he saw the white yeah I
don't<00:03:38.470> think<00:03:38.620> so<00:03:38.800> brings<00:03:39.130> it<00:03:39.280> down<00:03:39.520> right

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
don't think so brings it down right

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.800 
don't think so brings it down right
before<00:03:40.180> she<00:03:40.390> in<00:03:40.720> it<00:03:42.090> this<00:03:43.090> could<00:03:43.300> still<00:03:43.510> very

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
before she in it this could still very

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.590 
before she in it this could still very
well<00:03:43.989> work<00:03:44.170> for<00:03:44.380> something<00:03:44.620> oh<00:03:45.030> it's<00:03:46.030> a<00:03:46.120> solid

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.600 
well work for something oh it's a solid

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.020 
well work for something oh it's a solid
push<00:03:46.959> okay<00:03:47.320> gonna<00:03:48.310> have<00:03:48.430> to<00:03:48.520> use<00:03:48.610> his<00:03:48.760> energy

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
push okay gonna have to use his energy

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:50.490 
push okay gonna have to use his energy
here<00:03:49.209> because<00:03:49.450> he's<00:03:49.570> got<00:03:49.690> no<00:03:49.930> stalkers<00:03:50.410> at

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
here because he's got no stalkers at

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.670 
here because he's got no stalkers at
home<00:03:50.850> he<00:03:51.850> won't<00:03:52.060> kill<00:03:52.390> that<00:03:52.570> though<00:03:52.840> and<00:03:53.110> that

means<00:03:53.920> that<00:03:54.070> once<00:03:54.550> the<00:03:54.700> overcharge<00:03:55.090> is<00:03:55.300> down

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:55.600 
means that once the overcharge is down

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.539 
means that once the overcharge is down
on<00:03:55.870> cooldown<00:03:56.200> he's<00:03:56.980> going<00:03:57.130> to<00:03:57.190> have<00:03:57.310> to<00:03:57.370> use

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:57.549 
on cooldown he's going to have to use

00:03:57.549 --> 00:03:59.250 
on cooldown he's going to have to use
some<00:03:57.790> of<00:03:57.940> his<00:03:58.030> war<00:03:58.209> pins<00:03:58.420> at<00:03:58.570> home<00:03:58.750> to<00:03:58.959> keep<00:03:59.110> his

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
some of his war pins at home to keep his

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.070 
some of his war pins at home to keep his

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
that blink it's not quite ready yet yeah

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.060 
that blink it's not quite ready yet yeah

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:06.070 
as a warp gate research is done he can

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:07.890 
as a warp gate research is done he can
start<00:04:06.280> moving<00:04:06.459> in<00:04:06.760> some<00:04:06.970> stalkers<00:04:07.480> at<00:04:07.780> the

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.289 
start moving in some stalkers at the
attack<00:04:08.430> and<00:04:09.430> that's<00:04:09.610> so<00:04:09.820> annoying<00:04:10.030> because

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:10.299 
attack and that's so annoying because

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:12.090 
attack and that's so annoying because

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350 
commit to the attack fully that's too

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.350 
commit to the attack fully that's too
many<00:04:41.500> resources<00:04:41.890> yeah<00:04:42.790> you<00:04:42.850> know<00:04:43.150> what

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
many resources yeah you know what

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.820 
many resources yeah you know what
parting<00:04:43.750> with<00:04:43.810> the<00:04:43.960> Oracle<00:04:44.320> he<00:04:44.440> got<00:04:44.620> a<00:04:44.650> great

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
parting with the Oracle he got a great

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.530 
parting with the Oracle he got a great
scout<00:04:45.340> of<00:04:45.490> the<00:04:45.580> entire<00:04:45.820> base<00:04:46.060> and<00:04:46.240> he<00:04:46.300> knows

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:46.540 
scout of the entire base and he knows

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:48.290 
scout of the entire base and he knows
that<00:04:46.570> there's<00:04:46.900> no<00:04:46.990> robotics<00:04:47.410> follow-up<00:04:47.800> yeah

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 
that there's no robotics follow-up yeah

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.550 
that there's no robotics follow-up yeah
this<00:04:49.300> is<00:04:49.390> he<00:04:49.450> can<00:04:49.570> keep<00:04:49.810> checking<00:04:50.020> that<00:04:50.350> too

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 
this is he can keep checking that too

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.320 
this is he can keep checking that too
now<00:04:50.950> this<00:04:51.190> is<00:04:51.370> so<00:04:51.520> smart<00:04:51.760> now<00:04:51.880> departing

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
now this is so smart now departing

actually
with<00:04:53.970> a<00:04:54.000> mothership<00:04:54.300> core<00:04:54.600> here<00:04:54.750> he<00:04:54.900> should<00:04:55.170> be

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 
with a mothership core here he should be

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:56.810 
with a mothership core here he should be
able<00:04:55.440> to<00:04:55.650> buy<00:04:55.770> enough<00:04:56.040> time<00:04:56.220> to<00:04:56.370> get<00:04:56.460> that<00:04:56.610> dark

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:56.820 
able to buy enough time to get that dark

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:58.640 
able to buy enough time to get that dark
shrine<00:04:57.120> up<00:04:57.300> and<00:04:57.540> he<00:04:57.630> has<00:04:57.810> that<00:04:57.990> pylon<00:04:58.410> from

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
shrine up and he has that pylon from

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:00.350 
shrine up and he has that pylon from
earlier<00:04:59.010> we<00:04:59.160> were<00:04:59.220> talking<00:04:59.280> about<00:04:59.640> it<00:04:59.940> you
