 title simplified mode free to play 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.530
 based on app purchases but 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.649
 very well done especially at 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.899
 graphic level marvel universe with 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.250
 all superheroes available at 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.840
 layout 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.500
 and then we show them to you in the part 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.299
 initial where after the launch of the game 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:09.030
 we can obviously select several 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:12.180
 things such as the beginning of a mission 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:15.330
 arena mode and form our time 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.640
 improve it according to the objectives 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.619
 reached at team level but look 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.570
 quick as you can see we will play with 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:25.049
 a trio of characters but they will be 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:28.259
 really many and the additional that 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:30.390
 we will be able to unlock with in app or advancing 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.610
 at the levels earning points with a 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.490
 rather classic bar mechanism 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.490
 energy like other titles that you 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.380
 will run out by facing the missions and will come 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.360
 recharged or time or buying 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.000
 small coin gold coins for i 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.240
 upgrades and gems then a system 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.220
 pretty classic any hero can 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.920
 let's take it as an example 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:56.880
 our black widow and how you will see 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.950
 from the graphics and overlay 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.610
 we will be able to modify various parameters 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.440
 among which 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.440
 objects at our disposal 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.970
 skills and also increase level i 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.520
 our characters 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.800
 regarding missions 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.520
 quickly, there are eight chapters 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.770
 available 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.050
 it will start from the first and if comparable 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.900
 both in normal mode and elite in 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:22.110
 elite earnings will be more complicated 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.920
 they will be greater but the energy consumed 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:29.980
 it will be even more before the classic 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:33.130
 in-game editing a brief mention of the 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.430
 indirect gameplay to show you how 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:39.090
 the controls react very well 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:42.940
 as you can see we will enter the game 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.530
 with three characters obviously what it is 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.550
 prey we may should that it will not be 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.870
 available 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:51.130
 normally we turn it off in this one 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.170
 moment we are using air one not 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:56.230
 may change at any time 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:03:01.090
 with the other characters available 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:03.510
 in addition to the virtual left and the commands a 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.799
 right we will find the special moves 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.480
 reliable caring everyone will be 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:09.580
 characterized by its typology of 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.049
 moves and as a result we could create 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.910
 really special combos 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:15.190
 making our character interact 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.780
 with the other two left in quotation marks 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.239
 on the bench 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.070
 as you can see at the level of fluids 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:23.170
 between is graphic realization we are 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:26.140
 really on excellent levels 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:29.540
 high quality full screen animations 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:31.879
 excellent colors on ipad term been 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.329
 a resolution very well indeed 

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:35.390
 done 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:36.980
 the levels are quite short for 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.359
 however, regarding less first chapter 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.030
 but we reserve the right to pass judgment 

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:45.409
 final in the complete review 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:47.390
 will come after this pre-stage 

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:50.290
 game is all we leave you to the video 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.290
 full 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.039
 we get some pseudo conclusions in 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.110
 how much the game we are currently 

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:41.539
 testing and this is a sort of preview 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.550
 the conclusions you will find in the 

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:46.970
 full review on the blog about 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:50.990
 apple a seemingly well done game 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:53.090
 graphically and strikes immediately and 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:55.310
 the problem is also very funny 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:59.599
 will probably be related to the type 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:01.430
 of freemium that has been adopted but is 

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:03.800
 we will evaluate with time regarding 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:06.169
 the first eight chapters can be overcome 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.940
 the levels are very simple 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:10.400
 rather short and are characterized 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:12.580
 from the classic presence of the end boss 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.300
 level as you saw in the assembly 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.550
 we will give you more details 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:18.949
 soon then for this video 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:21.110
