00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.900
 jonathan 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.710
 Jonathan is able to identify one by 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.410
 example is jonathan 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:50.100
 what idea does eta give you? 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:53.770
 good 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:57.700
 marianela jimenez back is the name 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:59.590
 can you identify it if jonathan ponte 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:02.600
 tranquilito and remain tranquilito 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:05.930
 to show you this 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:08.310
 is the French painter ghoga 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:11.610
 how old is jonathan 4 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:17.000
 Hail Mary when he was 3 years old he knew 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.000
 91 now he knows 153 and who is that 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.340
 and it's the American paul paul klee 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:24.100
 Awesome 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:28.359
 and expression to anybody 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:31.590
 if I like Jonathan study that you 

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:35.560
 taught to paint who you sr 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:38.850
 who left me taught to paint dad 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.750
 It was his dad but this is a job 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.930
 extraordinary with the good child 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.759
 I really wanted to guide him because 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.799
 at first it sounds so without me 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:49.479
 I said he started smearing me all 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:51.460
 the walls in an apartment again 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:53.289
 that we had just moved the truth 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.730
 is that for me it was terrible because 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:57.160
 go figure 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:02:00.400
 when we had a month of moved and 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:03.220
 it was daubed 90% of the walls 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.170
 and it was because he was a year and two 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:08.380
 months out there because I walk at 10 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.840
 months at 16 and before two years 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.970
 you already knew the alphabet all the numbers 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.220
 Learn to count the colors and all that 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.210
 then from there it was that I 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.560
 would begin to illuminate the idea of 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:19.750
 teach them painters because how he has 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.450
 such a prodigious memory and when 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:25.360
 when he moved his hands to strokes 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.640
 you realized that identified 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.040
 had such clear as teacher of 20 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.810
 years I knew it was an unusual stroke 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.700
 when 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.130
 the first picture he made when 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:39.670
 I was one year and three months old 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:42.430
 account of what he had done was 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.500
 unusual for his age after here 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.569
 for example we have the first box that 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.760
 he did when he was a year and a half 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:51.940
 the first and a half box if the first 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.700
 picture in acrylic I brought some 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.230
 works for example true that hide 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.870
 I was a year and a half now, I'm going to 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:02.220
 show when he 's two years old this one already 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:04.200
 It was when he was two years two years if 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:07.190
 here is one when he was the years 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.190
 also that one that is there 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:16.110
 if this was when he had already been 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:18.900
 I was three years old 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.820
 when he did it and it's a picture that he knows 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:25.940
 what it is to give a person very 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.940
 special that he wants to give 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.310
 or 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:36.049
 he wants to give it to the president 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:38.180
 Leon Fernandez President Fernandez 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:41.290
 look 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:46.140
 and let me say let me tell you 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:49.030
 that the purple stands out incredibly 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:51.459
 yellow made harmonic colors because 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.829
 is for those who do not know maybe they look 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:55.659
 to the great fans now so are 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:04:00.400
 the great painters of the country ureña rib 

00:03:55.659 --> 00:04:02.079
 and luis muñoz guadalupe in july susana 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.829
 who have admired his works and have 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:09.359
 written from the gaudy oak and they do not know 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:09.359
 explains for example the same 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:15.159
 the deputy director of modern art is ricky 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.989
 my mistress wrote of him in that brooch 

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:19.600
 that is there that we put what 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.729
 you can see that brooch if we expand it on 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:24.729
 he wrote saying that he does not understand 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:27.580
 because they are atan seems to assimilate as 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:30.040
 great a great teacher not only the 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:32.290
 forms of splendor access minutes 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.180
 but the colors for example knows 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.510
 harmonize colors and nobody told you 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.510
 the sun 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:42.850
 if you notice the violet is 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:43.240
 exactly the opposite of yellow I 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:46.630
 they gave 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:49.750
 we want to highlight the work of 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:52.330
 this boy from jonathan just because 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:54.190
 we have to tell the world that in the

 movement and the trend the moment in 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:21.160
