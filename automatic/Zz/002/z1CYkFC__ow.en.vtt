00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
hard because you don't see your family

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.630 
hard because you don't see your family
you<00:02:06.420> can<00:02:06.659> call<00:02:07.140> them<00:02:07.319> like<00:02:07.590> once<00:02:07.860> a<00:02:08.039> week<00:02:08.069> or

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
you can call them like once a week or

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.789 
you can call them like once a week or
it's<00:02:09.269> really<00:02:09.539> hard<00:02:09.690> you<00:02:09.810> go<00:02:10.080> back<00:02:10.289> home<00:02:10.590> for

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:10.799 
it's really hard you go back home for

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:15.440 
it's really hard you go back home for
vacation<00:02:10.950> and<00:02:11.549> weekends<00:02:11.970> sometimes<00:02:13.250> but<00:02:14.450> yeah

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
vacation and weekends sometimes but yeah

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.570 
vacation and weekends sometimes but yeah
but<00:02:15.630> I<00:02:15.690> think<00:02:15.810> it's<00:02:16.170> how<00:02:16.410> you<00:02:16.470> become<00:02:17.370> a

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
but I think it's how you become a

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.789 
but I think it's how you become a
professional<00:02:18.420> in<00:02:18.720> everything<00:02:19.380> maybe<00:02:19.590> you

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:19.799 
professional in everything maybe you

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:23.470
