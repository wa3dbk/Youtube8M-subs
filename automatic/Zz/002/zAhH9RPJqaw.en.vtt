display their muscles what they try to

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.219 
display their muscles what they try to
do<00:02:06.159> is<00:02:06.310> to<00:02:06.459> keep<00:02:06.670> animals<00:02:06.880> in<00:02:07.360> order<00:02:08.049> to

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
do is to keep animals in order to

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.009 
do is to keep animals in order to
highlight<00:02:08.739> the<00:02:09.459> the<00:02:09.759> older<00:02:10.149> muscle<00:02:10.509> you<00:02:10.869> see

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:11.019 
highlight the the older muscle you see

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:12.210 
highlight the the older muscle you see
well<00:02:11.170> so<00:02:11.200> you<00:02:11.350> can<00:02:11.470> see<00:02:11.650> where<00:02:11.799> all<00:02:11.950> the<00:02:12.070> meat

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
well so you can see where all the meat

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.759 
well so you can see where all the meat
is<00:02:12.430> exactly<00:02:13.239> exactly<00:02:13.660> but<00:02:14.140> even<00:02:14.380> here<00:02:14.590> where

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
is exactly exactly but even here where

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:16.530 
is exactly exactly but even here where
they've<00:02:14.920> sort<00:02:15.190> of<00:02:15.220> trimmed<00:02:15.609> in<00:02:15.790> there<00:02:16.060> yeah<00:02:16.329> to

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
they've sort of trimmed in there yeah to

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.620 
they've sort of trimmed in there yeah to
highlight<00:02:16.959> to<00:02:17.320> highlight<00:02:17.709> that<00:02:18.400> muscle<00:02:18.850> which

highlight to highlight that muscle which

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.699 
highlight to highlight that muscle which
has<00:02:19.810> got<00:02:19.959> too<00:02:20.049> high<00:02:20.200> value<00:02:20.530> you<00:02:21.070> see<00:02:22.530> and<00:02:23.530> these

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
has got too high value you see and these

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:25.680 
has got too high value you see and these
are<00:02:23.920> all<00:02:24.040> gonna<00:02:24.370> be<00:02:24.459> lean<00:02:24.790> cuts<00:02:25.180> and<00:02:25.480> they're

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
are all gonna be lean cuts and they're

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.539 
are all gonna be lean cuts and they're
all<00:02:25.870> for<00:02:26.200> quick<00:02:26.500> cooking<00:02:26.829> are<00:02:26.950> they<00:02:27.070> decide

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:27.549 
all for quick cooking are they decide

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:29.099 
all for quick cooking are they decide
that's<00:02:28.030> right<00:02:28.299> without<00:02:28.480> you<00:02:28.720> when<00:02:28.900> you<00:02:28.959> look

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:29.109 
that's right without you when you look

00:02:29.109 --> 00:02:30.750 
that's right without you when you look
at<00:02:29.230> this<00:02:29.320> you<00:02:29.500> you<00:02:29.769> can't<00:02:30.220> help<00:02:30.370> thinking<00:02:30.700> of

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
at this you you can't help thinking of

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.440 
at this you you can't help thinking of
lunch<00:02:30.970> you<00:02:31.090> know<00:02:31.329> is<00:02:32.200> it<00:02:32.380> healthy

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
lunch you know is it healthy

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.330 
lunch you know is it healthy
the<00:02:34.450> annual<00:02:34.630> media<00:02:35.109> what<00:02:35.530> the<00:02:35.650> animal<00:02:35.980> is<00:02:36.010> as

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
the annual media what the animal is as

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.810 
the annual media what the animal is as
healthy<00:02:36.910> as<00:02:37.120> another<00:02:38.160> intensive<00:02:39.160> producing

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
healthy as another intensive producing

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.520 
healthy as another intensive producing
animal<00:02:40.239> so<00:02:40.540> this<00:02:40.690> is<00:02:40.840> about<00:02:41.109> the<00:02:41.320> most

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
animal so this is about the most

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.130 
animal so this is about the most
technological<00:02:42.430> that<00:02:43.000> meat<00:02:43.209> can<00:02:43.390> get<00:02:43.570> not<00:02:44.019> the

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
technological that meat can get not the

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.569 
technological that meat can get not the
most<00:02:44.290> technological<00:02:44.950> in<00:02:45.100> terms<00:02:45.430> of

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:45.579 
most technological in terms of

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:46.979 
most technological in terms of
technology<00:02:46.120> we<00:02:46.239> talk<00:02:46.420> about<00:02:46.690> selection

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
technology we talk about selection

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:54.970 
technology we talk about selection
natural<00:02:47.290> selection<00:02:47.590> having<00:02:48.489> achieved<00:02:48.840> that

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.860 

so<00:02:55.980> what<00:02:56.220> is<00:02:56.430> the<00:02:56.640> science<00:02:57.120> behind<00:02:57.330> the

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
so what is the science behind the

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.770 
so what is the science behind the
Belgian<00:02:58.350> blues<00:03:02.000> there<00:03:03.000> is<00:03:03.120> a<00:03:03.150> gene<00:03:03.480> that

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
Belgian blues there is a gene that

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.630 
Belgian blues there is a gene that
