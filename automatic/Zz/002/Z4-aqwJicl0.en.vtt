heavy duty stuff you're using a big

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.840 
heavy duty stuff you're using a big
heavy<00:00:33.270> kit<00:00:33.660> this<00:00:34.290> could<00:00:34.500> be<00:00:34.649> for<00:00:34.890> you<00:00:35.010> if<00:00:35.250> not

heavy kit this could be for you if not

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.490 
heavy kit this could be for you if not
just<00:00:36.300> have<00:00:36.570> a<00:00:36.600> look<00:00:36.840> because<00:00:36.989> it's<00:00:37.350> really

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
just have a look because it's really

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.130 
just have a look because it's really
impressive<00:00:37.829> tripod<00:00:38.520> but<00:00:39.149> overkill<00:00:40.110> for

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
impressive tripod but overkill for

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.650 
impressive tripod but overkill for
everyday<00:00:40.800> shooting<00:00:41.399> first<00:00:42.030> of<00:00:42.210> all<00:00:42.329> let's

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
everyday shooting first of all let's

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.690 
everyday shooting first of all let's
just<00:00:42.750> have<00:00:43.020> a<00:00:43.050> look<00:00:43.260> how<00:00:44.010> big<00:00:44.250> this<00:00:44.430> thing<00:00:44.489> is

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
just have a look how big this thing is

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.510 
just have a look how big this thing is
so<00:00:45.570> this<00:00:45.750> is<00:00:45.899> only<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.289> three<00:00:46.590> section<00:00:46.860> leg<00:00:47.280> it's

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
so this is only a three section leg it's

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.700 
so this is only a three section leg it's
not<00:00:47.700> like<00:00:47.879> one<00:00:48.090> that<00:00:48.239> compresses<00:00:48.870> down<00:00:48.899> heaps

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
not like one that compresses down heaps

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.369 
not like one that compresses down heaps
it<00:00:49.980> has<00:00:50.190> four<00:00:50.489> or<00:00:50.579> five<00:00:50.640> leg<00:00:51.059> sections<00:00:51.539> this<00:00:52.230> is

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
it has four or five leg sections this is

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.110 
it has four or five leg sections this is
designed<00:00:52.739> for<00:00:52.980> maximum<00:00:53.160> rigidity<00:00:54.090> and

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
designed for maximum rigidity and

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.779 
designed for maximum rigidity and
strength<00:00:54.420> so<00:00:55.379> it's<00:00:55.530> minimum<00:00:55.949> leg<00:00:56.190> sections

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
strength so it's minimum leg sections

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.799 
strength so it's minimum leg sections
this<00:00:57.690> is<00:00:57.960> as<00:00:58.289> I<00:00:58.680> said<00:00:58.920> full<00:00:59.219> carbon<00:00:59.520> fiber

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
this is as I said full carbon fiber

a load up to 18 kilos okay the head i've
got<00:01:42.689> out<00:01:42.780> here<00:01:43.020> is<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.170> rc4<00:01:43.909> 0:55<00:01:44.970> and<00:01:45.960> this<00:01:46.439> is

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
got out here is the rc4 0:55 and this is

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.920 
got out here is the rc4 0:55 and this is
a<00:01:46.590> monster<00:01:47.070> to<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.250> ball<00:01:47.610> in<00:01:47.850> there<00:01:48.090> is<00:01:48.329> huge

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
a monster to the ball in there is huge

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.330 
a monster to the ball in there is huge
it's<00:01:49.140> like<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.350> size<00:01:49.560> of<00:01:49.649> a<00:01:49.740> tennis<00:01:49.950> ball

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
it's like the size of a tennis ball

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.969 
it's like the size of a tennis ball
it's<00:01:50.899> magnesium<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:52.020> this<00:01:52.320> one's<00:01:52.530> rated<00:01:52.860> up

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
it's magnesium and this one's rated up

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.700 
it's magnesium and this one's rated up
to<00:01:53.009> 12<00:01:53.549> kilogram<00:01:54.149> so<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.780> combination<00:01:55.500> is

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
to 12 kilogram so the combination is

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.950 
to 12 kilogram so the combination is
good<00:01:55.920> for<00:01:56.100> 12<00:01:56.340> I<00:01:56.520> tell<00:01:56.729> you<00:01:56.880> what<00:01:57.090> it<00:01:57.719> was<00:01:57.840> like

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
good for 12 I tell you what it was like

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.450 
good for 12 I tell you what it was like
you<00:01:58.049> could<00:01:58.200> swing<00:01:58.439> a<00:01:58.530> frigging<00:01:58.829> tank<00:01:59.070> off<00:01:59.280> this

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
you could swing a frigging tank off this

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.120 
you could swing a frigging tank off this
thing<00:01:59.670> it's<00:02:00.180> so<00:02:00.540> sturdy<00:02:00.869> now<00:02:01.590> I<00:02:01.619> showed<00:02:01.950> this

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
thing it's so sturdy now I showed this

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.660 
thing it's so sturdy now I showed this
in<00:02:02.340> a<00:02:02.460> video<00:02:02.729> before<00:02:03.020> but<00:02:04.020> having<00:02:04.770> a<00:02:04.920> bigger

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
in a video before but having a bigger

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.880 
in a video before but having a bigger
the<00:02:05.790> ball<00:02:06.000> head<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.540> more<00:02:06.990> easy<00:02:07.380> it<00:02:07.590> is<00:02:07.710> to

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
the ball head the more easy it is to

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.309 
the ball head the more easy it is to
make<00:02:08.039> really<00:02:08.429> small<00:02:08.789> fine<00:02:09.179> precise<00:02:09.629> movements

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
make really small fine precise movements

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.310 
make really small fine precise movements
let's<00:02:10.739> get<00:02:10.890> a<00:02:10.920> close-up<00:02:11.190> on<00:02:11.489> this<00:02:11.640> head

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.320 
let's get a close-up on this head

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.870 
let's get a close-up on this head
okay<00:02:13.320> so<00:02:13.380> take<00:02:13.710> your<00:02:13.830> close-up<00:02:14.280> on<00:02:14.460> the<00:02:14.640> head

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
okay so take your close-up on the head

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.540 
okay so take your close-up on the head
it's<00:02:15.750> got<00:02:15.900> a<00:02:15.960> pan<00:02:16.320> lock<00:02:16.590> here<00:02:16.860> so<00:02:17.070> you<00:02:17.130> can<00:02:17.340> lock

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
it's got a pan lock here so you can lock

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.280 
it's got a pan lock here so you can lock
that<00:02:17.730> away<00:02:18.000> or<00:02:18.240> you<00:02:18.450> can<00:02:18.600> unlock<00:02:18.960> it<00:02:19.020> and

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
that away or you can unlock it and

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.740 
that away or you can unlock it and
smoothly<00:02:20.070> pan<00:02:20.580> around<00:02:20.910> so<00:02:21.240> you<00:02:21.300> know<00:02:21.390> what

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
smoothly pan around so you know what

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.710 
smoothly pan around so you know what
distance<00:02:22.200> you're<00:02:22.410> at<00:02:22.970> the<00:02:23.970> ball<00:02:24.180> will<00:02:24.510> rotate

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
distance you're at the ball will rotate

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.470 
distance you're at the ball will rotate
beyond<00:02:25.370> horizontal<00:02:26.370> you'll<00:02:26.550> see<00:02:26.820> but<00:02:27.360> it's

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
beyond horizontal you'll see but it's

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.720 
beyond horizontal you'll see but it's
got<00:02:27.660> this<00:02:27.810> collar<00:02:28.770> inside<00:02:29.280> that<00:02:29.460> you<00:02:29.550> can

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
got this collar inside that you can

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.180 
got this collar inside that you can
rotate<00:02:30.180> across<00:02:30.600> and<00:02:31.020> then<00:02:31.470> that<00:02:31.680> will<00:02:31.830> lock<00:02:32.040> it

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
rotate across and then that will lock it

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.820 
rotate across and then that will lock it
out<00:02:32.340> at<00:02:32.760> the<00:02:33.030> ninety<00:02:33.360> degree<00:02:33.660> position<00:02:33.830> most

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
out at the ninety degree position most

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.410 
out at the ninety degree position most
importantly<00:02:35.310> it's<00:02:35.430> got<00:02:35.520> a<00:02:35.580> bubble<00:02:35.940> level<00:02:36.060> here

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
importantly it's got a bubble level here

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.660 
importantly it's got a bubble level here
and<00:02:36.660> here<00:02:36.990> and<00:02:37.260> that's<00:02:38.040> where<00:02:38.220> you<00:02:38.310> want<00:02:38.490> it

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
and here and that's where you want it

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.220 
and here and that's where you want it
there's<00:02:38.820> no<00:02:39.000> point<00:02:39.240> really<00:02:39.480> having<00:02:39.870> a<00:02:39.930> bubble

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
there's no point really having a bubble

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.810 
there's no point really having a bubble
level<00:02:40.350> down<00:02:40.620> below<00:02:40.890> and<00:02:41.010> relying<00:02:41.310> on<00:02:41.430> that<00:02:41.670> one

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
level down below and relying on that one

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.220 
level down below and relying on that one
because<00:02:41.940> it's<00:02:42.180> right<00:02:42.360> at<00:02:42.510> the<00:02:42.540> camera<00:02:43.020> where

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
because it's right at the camera where

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.800 
because it's right at the camera where
you<00:02:43.260> need<00:02:43.620> to<00:02:43.770> know<00:02:43.950> that<00:02:43.980> you're<00:02:44.520> level<00:02:44.880> so

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
you need to know that you're level so

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.750 
you need to know that you're level so
it's<00:02:46.140> got<00:02:46.320> the<00:02:46.470> ball<00:02:46.680> lock<00:02:46.920> as<00:02:47.190> one<00:02:47.490> movement

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
it's got the ball lock as one movement

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.570 
it's got the ball lock as one movement
then<00:02:48.720> the<00:02:48.900> pan<00:02:49.110> lock<00:02:49.380> as<00:02:49.590> a<00:02:49.650> second<00:02:50.370> movement

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
then the pan lock as a second movement

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.880 
then the pan lock as a second movement
then<00:02:51.240> you've<00:02:51.390> got<00:02:51.600> a<00:02:51.630> third<00:02:52.140> one<00:02:52.170> here<00:02:52.590> which<00:02:52.740> I

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
then you've got a third one here which I

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.420 
then you've got a third one here which I
believe<00:02:53.190> is<00:02:53.370> for<00:02:53.640> the<00:02:53.940> amount<00:02:54.420> of<00:02:54.510> resistance

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
believe is for the amount of resistance

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.220 
believe is for the amount of resistance
now<00:02:56.430> look<00:02:56.670> at<00:02:56.760> the<00:02:56.850> actual<00:02:57.000> head<00:02:57.420> itself<00:02:57.840> let's

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
now look at the actual head itself let's

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.960 
now look at the actual head itself let's
um<00:02:58.500> turn<00:02:59.250> this<00:02:59.460> around<00:03:00.770> what<00:03:01.770> a<00:03:01.980> monster<00:03:02.520> it

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
um turn this around what a monster it

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.910 
um turn this around what a monster it
comes<00:03:03.240> with<00:03:03.480> the<00:03:03.990> both<00:03:04.200> the<00:03:04.380> different<00:03:04.710> sizes

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
comes with the both the different sizes

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.830 
comes with the both the different sizes
that<00:03:05.220> you<00:03:05.430> could<00:03:05.610> possibly<00:03:06.000> require<00:03:06.270> and

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
that you could possibly require and

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.350 
that you could possibly require and
they're<00:03:07.290> both<00:03:07.500> are<00:03:07.910> integral<00:03:08.910> I<00:03:09.030> mean<00:03:09.210> they're

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
they're both are integral I mean they're

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.710 
they're both are integral I mean they're
both<00:03:09.480> full<00:03:10.320> they're<00:03:10.620> not<00:03:11.060> one<00:03:12.060> screws<00:03:12.420> off<00:03:12.570> to

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
both full they're not one screws off to

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.410 
both full they're not one screws off to
reveal<00:03:12.840> the<00:03:13.320> smaller<00:03:13.980> one<00:03:14.250> they're<00:03:14.820> complete

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
reveal the smaller one they're complete

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.050 
reveal the smaller one they're complete
units<00:03:15.840> for<00:03:16.140> maximum<00:03:16.770> stability<00:03:17.190> and<00:03:17.700> strength

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
units for maximum stability and strength
