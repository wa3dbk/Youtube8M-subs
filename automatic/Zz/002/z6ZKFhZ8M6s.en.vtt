00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:06.029
 the next chapter is about one 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.250
 the hardest areas around this 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.309
 coaching when we talk about coaching 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:14.969
 we distinguish over 34 different 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:17.660
 situations once coaching after the 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:21.230
 current game coaching as 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:24.300
 preparing for the next game coaching 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:27.119
 during the game and especially 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.800
 Coaching during the break in one 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.529
 game 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.690
 if we go directly to the coaching 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.809
 you could talk to the current game 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.840
 also say after the game is before the 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:43.320
 It is important for me to play as a tenth 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:46.350
 consciously differentiate the outcome as it does 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:50.969
 result and performance of my team 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:53.640
 far too often there are trainers 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.860
 do not make that distinction and 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:00.149
 fix the performance simplem results 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:02.579
 whether the 2 0 the lucky 2 0 victory 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.710
 it came about that one 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.740
 Although grotesquely played the 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.820
 opponent but was not able to his 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:12.030
 Dozens of gate opportunities in gates 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.280
 to convert one has a happy one 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.950
 awarded eleven meters and on 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.840
 The opponent has to finish in the 90 minutes 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.770
 then you also get an owner 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.960
 has won two to zero 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.369
 everything is good 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.500
 and you go to the next game 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.560
 as well as the last one 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.180
 gone is that would be fundamentally wrong that 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.810
 would be completely wrong as well as in the 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:37.409
 another case if you are unfortunately 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:39.540
 0 2 lost result of performance 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.750
 If you do not do this, you will break up 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.220
 fast in a trott is only 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.560
 result-oriented in quotation marks 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.630
 and do not pay attention to how the 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.130
 team in each game 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.409
 has presented as the individual 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.869
 player to the predetermined positions 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.649
 and has kept tasks and whether 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:01.259
 actually a performance improvement 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:04.020
 that's why it recommends 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.060
 after the currently completed game 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.160
 to analyze in peace 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.460
 just the things that were mentioned before 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.560
 have 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:13.810
 never was the default to this individual 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.940
 what were the specifications to the 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.800
 single player to the team like 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:21.340
 she has stuck to it 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:24.280
 what was the gameplay which 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:27.220
 There were special influences how is that 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.740
 Result has been achieved and is at rest 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.820
 to analyze what were actually the 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:35.830
 backgrounds for the respective result 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:38.580
 Of course it is very helpful if you 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:42.040
 This analysis not alone performs 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:45.010
 if you are a person of his trust 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.600
 that can be the co-trainer 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.360
 which may be the carer 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.370
 But that can also be a member of the 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.850
 be a board member or it can also be one 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:57.430
 from the be there from the loyal viewers 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.830
 It may be a former player 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.380
 kicks in the old men's team 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:04.210
 mid- forties in my fifties and me 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.580
 just after the game please and 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:07.210
 say human how do you have the game 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.340
 seen 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:11.110
 can you explain why ours? 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.990
 Center Forward no longer hits the ball 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:17.530
 or do you have our defense as well? 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:19.360
 weak I saw or why 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.730
 you an explanation for why you 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.500
 suddenly not over the outside anymore 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:27.670
 bring flanks inwards 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:30.250
 how is your opinion about that has 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:33.670
 the big advantage if you have several 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.540
 opinions do not pick them up again 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.790
 alone 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.220
 alone accomplish this topic 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.020
 that must be the others 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.210
 responsible as said trainer 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:46.000
 caretaker also quiet a spectator or 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:48.940
 a member of the board in the truest 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.350
 sense of the word picked up with feel 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.260
 feel involved 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:55.950
 they show interest in theirs 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:58.810
 opinion and how to say so beautiful 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:01.180
 four eyes see more than two 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:04.030
 you may see some things in it 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.500
 a one-way street and suddenly it comes 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.450
 and have you ever thought of it ? 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.220
 thought to do that and so or so 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:12.460
 For the last game that's me and that 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:15.640
 what did not notice him alone 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:19.560
 would be noticed after the game with 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:23.220
 to analyze a certain distance in peace 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.220
 written records
