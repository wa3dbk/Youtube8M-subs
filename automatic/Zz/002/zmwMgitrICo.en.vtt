 our traditional vegan vegan supermarkets 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:15.280

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.870
 challenge I can do that for me 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.640
 unfortunately not allow but usually 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.620
 I also like to go there 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.780

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.370
 Tell me what you can buy with it 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.499
 Not always everyone thinks I would 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.420
 hostages and do not eat sweets 

00:01:05.499 --> 00:01:08.319
 can 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.210
 a little bit more 

00:01:08.319 --> 00:01:11.679
 categorize it so you get a better one 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:17.259
 Overview involved one 

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:19.420
 chocolate snacks biscuits pudding and 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:20.920
 reggae or borgs i will be you 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.079
 Of course, to say who buy that 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.270
 can I write you the prices in 

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:27.939
 the infobox just looks in and out 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:31.209
 then you will be informed but be yourself 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:33.609
 I'm not aware of any of these sweets 

00:01:31.209 --> 00:01:36.490
 even if she is vegan is in 

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:39.189
 some respects only the first 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.929
 category chocolate who is chocolate 

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:42.520
 it generally so that most bitter 

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:44.920
 varieties of a particular company 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.270
 Vegans are shit I know and 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.329
 which I'm pretty tasty is the 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.219
 demigods of knight sport but what up 

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:53.109
 they also have a bittersweet variety and 

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:55.240
 that is absolutely not vegan so that 

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:55.659
 I believe milk powder in it I am me 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.759
 for sure 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:00.560
 only the half bitter then there's still 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:02.689
 among the vegans relatively well-known 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.210
 a chocolate and that there are in the 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:07.220
 Kaufland and in edeka and rewe I believe 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.420
 I also do not know exactly, I 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.979
 I write this only my info boxes 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.470
 there are also still from the company 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.720
 bonita so-called rice milk chocolate 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.700
 this is on a rice milk basis 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.349
 also really delicious that all 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.670
 with the favorite chocolates that gives 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:21.440
 unfortunately only in organic stores and 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.860
 health food or in big bio 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:27.200
 super markets such as dance or in routes 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.640
 of course, but also possible 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.080
 smaller health food stores you can 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.090
 buy as well as the worries of 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.340
 naturata and how were they are right 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:38.060
 really great that he does not all varieties 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:41.090
 wega, of course, but the approximately 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:43.069
 half of it is vegan and very very 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.799
 delicious especially vivani I can tell you 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:51.190
 recommend the tat bitter chocolate with 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:54.319
 cocos flower category 2 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:56.000
 that are weird vegan 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:57.440
 probably quite a lot 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.900
 know but I am of course 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.989
 anyway, because everyone is vegan 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.730
 So celebrate without there is no worry 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:06.140
 you do not have to worry who they are 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.670
 In any case, there is no milk 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.680
 in the cream there is actually 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.060
 everywhere I have to say besides wants 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.130
 back there I would not it now 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.640
 but you probably know that 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:19.340
 itself, there then who would have thought it well 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.319
 mana's neapolitans are vegan oh 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.569

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:25.160

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:43.370
 it from the own brand edk for example 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:45.200
 the slightly larger american cookies and 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.790
 there is a variety that is also torn 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.920
 please among the vegans and again 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.359
 very well known the singular biscuits 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.920
 I hope that's right now 

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:53.630
 it is also pronounced in the 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.760
 Kaufland around I unfortunately have them 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:57.109
 not tried yet but i have heard 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.940
 that she should taste very good 

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:01.510
 in addition to christmas now relative 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:03.940

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:07.420

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:09.190
 third category gummi bears a must 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:12.520
 I say that the supermarkets are still there 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:15.130
 not so big are a huge 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:22.570
 offer of vegan rubber animals or 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:24.820
 but as you probably know 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:27.670
 Now katjes leads many many 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:29.590
 gummi bears that are vegetarian 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:31.630
 without gelatin but they also have one 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:34.090
 kind the iss began and that the 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.890

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.850
 I've seen it many times and you can 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:54.420
 also buy 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:05:00.040
 katjes and trolls can be found at edeka 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:05:01.720
 Rewe and Kaufland and the bigger one 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:05.620
 Supermarkets definitely 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:08.080
 category 4 1 at edeka you can do two 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:10.600
 really really tasty vegan ice creams 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:13.450
 buy, and that is once of the 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:16.390
 company lupine it's so small cups 

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:17.980
 so ben jerry's like cups and there 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:21.490
 There are three flavors of cherry 

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:24.430
 vanilla and chocolate and i just believe 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:26.890
 hardware exactly those are on flight you 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:28.360
 base so pure vegetable taste 

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:31.560
 very very good especially the chocolate 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:33.760
 I have already bought a few times 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.919
 There is also the brand there 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:39.430
 because yes, yes, they have such a market 

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:41.110
 male ice and then another ice cream 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:43.810
 looks a bit like this 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:46.090
 Cornetto exactly with his weapon beach 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:47.650
 I have not tested yet but should 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:50.729
 apparently also taste quite good 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:53.279
 at Kaufland there is the so-called million 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:54.809
 oh yes , there is one in the largest one 

00:05:53.279 --> 00:05:57.150
 and box that you always have one 

00:05:54.809 --> 00:05:58.710
 can rausholen portion but there are 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:00.960
 also a version that looks again 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:02.370
 Like the magnum tastes great 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:02.909
 you can already enjoy a bike too 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:05.639
 home 

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:08.909
 also, of course, such sorts of fruit ice cream 

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:11.189
 as capri and Fingerbang what is 

00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:12.599
 formerly there were all these naturally too 

00:06:11.189 --> 00:06:14.849
 vegan otherwise you can of course 

00:06:12.599 --> 00:06:16.620
 Never do something with fruit juice wrong 

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:19.169
 Actually we only fruit abs 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:21.029
 from frozen fruits, bit of water 

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:23.430
 and sugar 

00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:25.319
 that's why they get that, too 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:28.349
 everywhere you can rewe in the country of purchase 

00:06:25.319 --> 00:06:30.270
 edeka lidl aldi us what could be anywhere 

00:06:28.349 --> 00:06:31.529
 Buy course if you possible you 

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:32.819
 want to be sure then look behind 

00:06:31.529 --> 00:06:35.189
 again on the packaging too 

00:06:32.819 --> 00:06:36.569
 really nothing animal child me 

00:06:35.189 --> 00:06:38.610
 I have never had a book for example 

00:06:36.569 --> 00:06:43.219
 There is something animal about it 

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:43.219
 but that's why look inside
