thing of all for me is the new type of
dungeon<00:00:39.230> it's<00:00:39.620> just<00:00:39.890> not<00:00:39.920> a<00:00:40.039> new<00:00:40.520> Dodge<00:00:40.789> you

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 
dungeon it's just not a new Dodge you

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.450 
dungeon it's just not a new Dodge you
know<00:00:41.059> it's<00:00:41.210> a<00:00:41.329> new<00:00:41.539> type<00:00:42.020> of<00:00:42.289> dungeon<00:00:43.129> with

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.460 
know it's a new type of dungeon with

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.010 
know it's a new type of dungeon with
multiple<00:00:44.120> levels<00:00:44.480> in<00:00:44.600> the<00:00:44.660> further<00:00:44.930> you

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.020 
multiple levels in the further you

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.470 
multiple levels in the further you
progress<00:00:45.260> the<00:00:45.800> harder<00:00:46.160> it<00:00:46.280> becomes<00:00:46.699> so

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:47.480 
progress the harder it becomes so

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.779 
progress the harder it becomes so
basically<00:00:47.960> the<00:00:48.079> better<00:00:48.289> you<00:00:48.440> are<00:00:48.469> the<00:00:49.399> harder

00:00:49.779 --> 00:00:49.789 
basically the better you are the harder

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:51.790 
basically the better you are the harder
the<00:00:50.090> challenges<00:00:50.510> will<00:00:50.719> be<00:00:50.960> and<00:00:51.289> most<00:00:51.620> likely

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
the challenges will be and most likely

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.790 
the challenges will be and most likely
also<00:00:52.100> the<00:00:52.309> rewards<00:00:52.879> I<00:00:53.030> would<00:00:53.359> presume<00:00:53.870> and

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
also the rewards I would presume and

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.799 
also the rewards I would presume and
it's<00:00:54.980> only<00:00:55.160> designed<00:00:55.640> for<00:00:55.730> level<00:00:56.090> 80<00:00:56.300> so<00:00:56.629> if

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:56.809 
it's only designed for level 80 so if

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:58.180 
it's only designed for level 80 so if
you're<00:00:56.930> close<00:00:57.170> to<00:00:57.230> level<00:00:57.559> 80<00:00:57.710> make<00:00:58.010> sure

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
you're close to level 80 make sure

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:59.979 
you're close to level 80 make sure
you're<00:00:58.370> ready<00:00:58.609> for<00:00:58.670> it<00:00:58.910> and<00:00:59.120> get<00:00:59.719> it<00:00:59.750> up

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
you're ready for it and get it up

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:03.310 
you're ready for it and get it up
because<00:01:00.260> I'm<00:01:00.789> expecting<00:01:01.789> it<00:01:01.879> to<00:01:02.030> be<00:01:02.109> not<00:01:03.109> as

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
because I'm expecting it to be not as

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.100 
because I'm expecting it to be not as
easy<00:01:03.710> as<00:01:04.190> one<00:01:04.460> would<00:01:04.489> assume<00:01:05.120> especially<00:01:06.020> if

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
easy as one would assume especially if

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.620 
easy as one would assume especially if
you're<00:01:06.230> good<00:01:07.000> regardless<00:01:08.000> if<00:01:08.180> you<00:01:08.480> are

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
you're good regardless if you are

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.810 
you're good regardless if you are
