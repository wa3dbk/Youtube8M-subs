00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
extension cord and we're going to

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.109 
extension cord and we're going to
connect<00:01:18.939> that<00:01:19.780> to<00:01:20.619> the<00:01:20.860> camera<00:01:21.250> and<00:01:21.610> that

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:22.119

connect that to the camera and that
extension<00:01:22.540> cords<00:01:22.689> going<00:01:22.780> to<00:01:22.869> be<00:01:22.960> plugged<00:01:23.229> into

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
extension cords going to be plugged into

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:29.100 
extension cords going to be plugged into
the<00:01:23.530> wall

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.029 

so<00:01:30.110> the<00:01:30.259> first<00:01:30.439> thing<00:01:30.530> we're<00:01:30.649> going<00:01:30.770> to<00:01:30.829> do<00:01:30.950> is

00:01:31.029 --> 00:01:31.039 
so the first thing we're going to do is

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:33.100 
so the first thing we're going to do is
we're<00:01:31.130> going<00:01:31.159> to<00:01:31.310> set<00:01:31.490> up<00:01:31.520> the<00:01:31.700> camera<00:01:32.119> we're

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
we're going to set up the camera we're

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:34.719 
we're going to set up the camera we're
going<00:01:33.229> to<00:01:33.289> set<00:01:33.560> this<00:01:33.740> up<00:01:33.950> going<00:01:34.460> into<00:01:34.610> the

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
going to set this up going into the

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:39.700 
going to set this up going into the
camera<00:01:35.119> settings<00:01:35.539> to<00:01:36.380> record<00:01:37.220> at<00:01:37.490> 1080p<00:01:38.479> at<00:01:38.840> 60

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
camera settings to record at 1080p at 60

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.190 
camera settings to record at 1080p at 60
frames<00:01:39.860> a<00:01:40.100> second<00:01:40.520> and<00:01:40.899> then<00:01:41.899> we're<00:01:42.049> also

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
frames a second and then we're also

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.899 
frames a second and then we're also
going<00:01:42.470> to<00:01:42.590> set<00:01:42.860> up<00:01:43.039> so<00:01:43.189> that's<00:01:43.369> the<00:01:43.579> looping

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
going to set up so that's the looping

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:47.770 
going to set up so that's the looping
select<00:01:44.329> has<00:01:44.869> a<00:01:45.159> continuously<00:01:46.780> it's

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
select has a continuously it's

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.609 
select has a continuously it's
continuously<00:01:48.500> recording<00:01:49.159> at<00:01:49.340> 60<00:01:50.000> minute

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619 
continuously recording at 60 minute

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:56.169 
continuously recording at 60 minute
intervals<00:01:52.630> and<00:01:54.250> then<00:01:55.250> we're<00:01:55.490> going<00:01:55.700> to<00:01:55.850> turn

00:01:56.169 --> 00:01:56.179 
intervals and then we're going to turn

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:58.630 
intervals and then we're going to turn
on<00:01:56.390> the<00:01:56.600> Wi-Fi<00:01:56.890> or<00:01:57.890> at<00:01:57.979> least<00:01:58.159> make<00:01:58.369> sure<00:01:58.399> that

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
on the Wi-Fi or at least make sure that

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.839 
on the Wi-Fi or at least make sure that
the<00:01:58.759> Wi-Fi<00:01:58.909> setting<00:01:59.479> is<00:01:59.659> enabled<00:02:02.409> and<00:02:03.700> at<00:02:04.700> this

00:02:04.839 --> 00:02:04.849 
the Wi-Fi setting is enabled and at this

00:02:04.849 --> 00:02:06.490 
the Wi-Fi setting is enabled and at this
time<00:02:05.030> it's<00:02:05.179> also<00:02:05.330> probably<00:02:05.659> pretty<00:02:06.049> good<00:02:06.170> to

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
time it's also probably pretty good to

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.469 
time it's also probably pretty good to

setting on this camera let's see what

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:40.909 
setting on this camera let's see what
happens<00:04:39.510> when<00:04:39.660> we<00:04:39.750> use<00:04:39.780> a<00:04:40.020> nightlight<00:04:40.530> in<00:04:40.770> the

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:40.919 
happens when we use a nightlight in the

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:43.940 
happens when we use a nightlight in the
room<00:04:41.100> and<00:04:41.660> when<00:04:42.660> we<00:04:42.780> use<00:04:42.990> a<00:04:43.020> nightlight<00:04:43.590> in<00:04:43.830> the

and I hope it gave you some ideas or
some<00:05:01.740> inspiration<00:05:02.430> for<00:05:02.700> some<00:05:03.390> sort<00:05:03.750> of

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 
some inspiration for some sort of

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.650 
some inspiration for some sort of
monitoring<00:05:04.470> system<00:05:05.010> of<00:05:05.160> your<00:05:05.310> own<00:05:05.660> obviously

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:06.660 
monitoring system of your own obviously

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.600 
monitoring system of your own obviously
if<00:05:06.960> you<00:05:07.200> were<00:05:07.410> to<00:05:07.560> use<00:05:07.740> this<00:05:07.890> for<00:05:08.130> some<00:05:08.310> sort<00:05:08.520> of

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610 
if you were to use this for some sort of

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:10.820 
if you were to use this for some sort of
surveillance<00:05:09.300> system<00:05:09.720> you<00:05:10.350> probably

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:10.830 
surveillance system you probably

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:12.620 
surveillance system you probably
wouldn't<00:05:11.220> want<00:05:11.400> it<00:05:11.520> just<00:05:11.940> sitting<00:05:12.270> on<00:05:12.360> some

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:12.630 
wouldn't want it just sitting on some

wouldn't want it just sitting on some

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 
but you know I just wanted to test it

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:19.969 
but you know I just wanted to test it
out<00:05:18.180> just<00:05:18.330> to<00:05:18.450> see<00:05:18.660> if<00:05:18.780> it<00:05:18.960> was<00:05:19.140> possible<00:05:19.800> and

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 
to see if you know things could record

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:28.310 
to see if you know things could record
successfully<00:05:23.610> and<00:05:24.240> it<00:05:24.450> does

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:30.510 
a couple of cool things about this is

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:32.360 
a couple of cool things about this is
that<00:05:30.540> you<00:05:30.810> can<00:05:30.990> use<00:05:31.200> the<00:05:31.410> Wi-Fi<00:05:31.980> or<00:05:32.340> the

bad things or some setbacks are that

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:54.770 
bad things or some setbacks are that
it's<00:05:53.340> not<00:05:53.550> very<00:05:53.820> good<00:05:54.180> at<00:05:54.390> low-light

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:54.780 
it's not very good at low-light

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:56.030 
it's not very good at low-light
conditions<00:05:55.290> you<00:05:55.380> would<00:05:55.500> have<00:05:55.620> to<00:05:55.770> get<00:05:55.920> an

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:56.040 
conditions you would have to get an

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:59.600 
conditions you would have to get an
adapter<00:05:56.550> or<00:05:56.580> some<00:05:56.880> other<00:05:57.060> lens<00:05:57.830> to<00:05:58.830> be<00:05:59.280> able<00:05:59.370> to

upgrade<00:06:01.590> to<00:06:01.770> a<00:06:01.800> better<00:06:01.980> GoPro<00:06:02.550> I'm<00:06:02.700> using<00:06:03.030> a

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:03.240 
upgrade to a better GoPro I'm using a

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.630 
upgrade to a better GoPro I'm using a
GoPro<00:06:03.420> 3<00:06:03.750> +<00:06:04.050> Silver<00:06:04.470> Edition<00:06:04.590> and<00:06:05.010> I<00:06:05.580> do

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:05.640 
GoPro 3 + Silver Edition and I do

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:08.090 
GoPro 3 + Silver Edition and I do
believe<00:06:05.880> that<00:06:06.210> the<00:06:06.390> GoPro<00:06:06.750> 3<00:06:06.930> +<00:06:07.200> black<00:06:07.500> or<00:06:07.830> even

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:08.100 
believe that the GoPro 3 + black or even

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:12.790 
believe that the GoPro 3 + black or even
the<00:06:08.190> GoPro<00:06:08.640> Hero<00:06:09.420> 4<00:06:09.510> has<00:06:10.380> better<00:06:11.030> low-light

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:12.800 
the GoPro Hero 4 has better low-light

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.410 
the GoPro Hero 4 has better low-light
capabilities<00:06:13.800> so<00:06:14.340> that's<00:06:14.880> something<00:06:15.120> worth

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:15.420 
capabilities so that's something worth

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:18.020 
capabilities so that's something worth
considering<00:06:15.810> there<00:06:16.490> but<00:06:17.490> this<00:06:17.610> is<00:06:17.670> a<00:06:17.820> pretty

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:18.030 
considering there but this is a pretty

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:20.060 
considering there but this is a pretty
quick<00:06:18.390> setup<00:06:18.780> in<00:06:18.930> another<00:06:19.230> pretty<00:06:19.530> cool<00:06:19.860> way

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:20.070 
quick setup in another pretty cool way

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:23.120 
quick setup in another pretty cool way
to<00:06:20.100> use<00:06:20.550> your<00:06:20.580> GoPro<00:06:21.210> to<00:06:21.810> see<00:06:22.530> if<00:06:22.650> you<00:06:22.740> can<00:06:22.890> set

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:23.130 
to use your GoPro to see if you can set

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:25.250 
to use your GoPro to see if you can set
up<00:06:23.160> some<00:06:23.850> sort<00:06:24.090> of<00:06:24.240> surveillance<00:06:24.960> system

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:25.260 
up some sort of surveillance system

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.460 
up some sort of surveillance system
