00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:33.920

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:36.109
 everywhere in fortune city 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.320
 once you have given one of 

00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:41.120

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:52.640
 the objects I'm going to show you in 

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:56.180
 this video 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.739
 not really order to be given 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:02.210
 give you in the order you want 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:06.289
 but except for some who are 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:09.500
 special missions like this one that 

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:12.350
 is that of don t know flec and 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:16.009
 offer it to kitty if you do not know 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.720
 how to tame snowflake go into the 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:21.860
 link that is currently displayed on the 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:24.740
 video to see my video when I so 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:28.009
 you are and how to tame 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:31.340
 snowflake so that's it for this first 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:34.069
 gift so now be careful 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:37.429
 because several objects are in the 

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:41.420
 same store that is currently the one 

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:43.430
 here so you want the whole map of 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:48.969
 fortune city so he's here at 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:53.060
 royal flush bad and his name and children 

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:56.149
 castle so then the first is a 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:59.810
 elephant plush gyan so we are 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:03.020
 obliged to wear it on his back and we 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:06.200
 can not put it in its package 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:08.239
 can say so would want to do a very 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.130
 big way and then come back again 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:14.209
 because they adopt a budget in 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:17.180
 so take then second gift in 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:20.810
 this store is the bull stuffed 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:24.430
 giant who just the elephant's neighbor 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:26.959
 so you have to do the same thing for 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.819
 what you did with the francs 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.950
 that is to say take it under your back 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:34.579
 its power put it in the package 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.889
 and she bring him back was worried and I 

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:40.690
 Always remember that he is to children 

00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:43.640
 castle on the floor at royal flash plaza 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:46.090
 then third and last objects that 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:50.410

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.830
