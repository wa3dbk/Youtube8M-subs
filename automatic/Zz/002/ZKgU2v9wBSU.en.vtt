00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:03.069 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:07.110 

way<00:04:03.700> to<00:04:03.760> go<00:04:03.969> Frank<00:04:04.359> way<00:04:04.959> to<00:04:05.019> dodge<00:04:05.879> and<00:04:06.879> I<00:04:06.969> think

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
way to go Frank way to dodge and I think

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.399 
way to go Frank way to dodge and I think
I<00:04:07.150> did<00:04:07.299> make<00:04:07.450> this<00:04:07.540> level<00:04:07.840> of<00:04:07.870> winnable<00:04:08.230> I

00:04:08.399 --> 00:04:08.409 
I did make this level of winnable I

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:14.870 
I did make this level of winnable I
didn't<00:04:08.590> understand<00:04:08.980> the<00:04:09.069> gimmick

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.819 

the<00:04:15.450> fuck

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:22.309 

oh<00:04:19.889> I<00:04:20.759> guess<00:04:21.509> I'd<00:04:21.629> still<00:04:21.810> games<00:04:22.049> way<00:04:22.229> of

00:04:22.309 --> 00:04:22.319 
oh I guess I'd still games way of

00:04:22.319 --> 00:04:26.890 
oh I guess I'd still games way of
telling<00:04:22.590> me<00:04:22.650> that<00:04:22.800> the<00:04:22.860> game<00:04:23.039> is<00:04:23.189> over<00:04:24.289> well

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
telling me that the game is over well

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:34.969 
telling me that the game is over well
that<00:04:27.900> was<00:04:28.229> something<00:04:28.620> else<00:04:33.439> let's<00:04:34.439> just<00:04:34.590> put

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:34.979 
that was something else let's just put

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:41.749 
that was something else let's just put
in<00:04:35.099> the<00:04:35.370> old<00:04:35.580> John<00:04:35.909> Hancock<00:04:36.270> here<00:04:39.889> and<00:04:40.889> I<00:04:41.520> think

00:04:41.749 --> 00:04:41.759 
in the old John Hancock here and I think

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:43.959 
in the old John Hancock here and I think
that<00:04:41.909> should<00:04:42.060> about<00:04:42.180> do<00:04:42.449> it<00:04:42.479> for<00:04:42.599> jump<00:04:43.169> man

00:04:43.959 --> 00:04:43.969 
that should about do it for jump man

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:47.510 
that should about do it for jump man
unless<00:04:44.969> people<00:04:45.270> want<00:04:45.300> to<00:04:45.509> see<00:04:46.009> more<00:04:47.009> levels<00:04:47.430> I

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
unless people want to see more levels I

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:53.960 
unless people want to see more levels I
suppose<00:04:48.770> so<00:04:49.770> this<00:04:50.669> is<00:04:50.819> Frank<00:04:51.030> o<00:04:51.090> matic<00:04:51.270> later
