00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.210
 hello everybody today let's talk about 

00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:08.820
 voice controls and let's use the 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:12.960
 applications in the native music player of the 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:19.859
 galaxy s 4 and we will also use the camera 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:23.130
 photographic images are both use some 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:27.230
 by voice command to start then we 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:30.390
 Let's get into configurations here. 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.740
 to make the initial settings of the 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.690
 voice control 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:42.320
 we will find here the control of 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:49.170
 voice on my device device then 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:49.829
 the last tool that is control by 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.780
 voice 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:59.640
 He needs to be here connected later. 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:05.369
 so we play in voice control and 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:07.409
 here are the options in which the command 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:13.909
 can be used then 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:16.590
 has an incoming call an alarm 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:19.979
 camera and music 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.350
 I here have marked all the options, right? 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:28.970
 now in this video I will demonstrate only 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:28.970
 the last two being the camera and music 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:34.460
 Let's start with the camera. 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.840
 Let's go when you open the camera. 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:46.790
 to demonstrate the command the 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:51.180
 controls used on the camera 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:54.450
 the words the words that are already pre- 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:59.990
 configured for the firing of the 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:05.130
 photographs are the words shoot 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:10.250
 capture x-connect and smile 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:16.160
 Let's now demonstrate this in practice. 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:19.460
 here an object to be photographed with a 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.960
 charger is from the phone 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:25.600
 notice that I am going to speak now the first 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.600
 word shoot 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:48.850
 Let's go to the next one now, and 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:48.850
 next is smile and now finally connect x 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:59.230
 well now let's get out of here 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:03:02.739
 camera and test the voice commands to 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.739
 friends that play 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.750
 we have here our application 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.150
 Let's open a music folder here. 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:20.150
 an interesting thing to say here that 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:23.150
 some commands work best with the 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:26.780
 apparatus to sit playing playing 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:28.700
 no music i did some testing and and 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:32.120
 some commands like that with the player 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:36.160
 playing does not work so well is the 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:41.739
 sound of the sound of the device he 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:44.860
 it disturbs the to the voice command nÃ© 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:48.799
 here in case 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:50.920
 if I say to him is the right words 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:55.610
 increase volume 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:04:00.100
 notice it has already opened and request 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:04.630
 reduce volume reduce volume 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:09.590
 reduce volume reduce volume 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:12.049
 reduce the volume you realize that the 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:15.799
 volume has been reduced and is a 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:17.450
 environment is quiet and volume 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:19.250
 normally I will now do the 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:23.070
 converse, I 'm going to ask him to increase the 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:27.510
 volume increase volume 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:30.970
 increase volume increase volume 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:38.230
 increase volume ready now 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:40.030
 here with the volume at most one or the other 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:42.160
 command I'd like to show here 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:45.760
 huh 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:53.700
 here in blue is not the song that the 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:56.410
 people now if I ask next was already 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:57.580
 sometimes he catches very well he catches 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:59.740
 very good very good 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:04.330
 is the sound of our voice is sometimes 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:07.270
 This does not happen so easily. 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:10.320
 then the next command 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:13.320
 note he jumps to the next song 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.320
 next 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:23.950
 If I asked you to go back, huh? 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:25.570
 in the previous song I 'm not saying 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:31.540
 usually when he comes back already 

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:33.700
 back playing aaa music not only that 

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:36.700
 now with the sun the toucan will stay 

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:43.270
 It's difficult for us to ask that 

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:44.590
 public cause here is like me 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:46.870
 said with the sound playing is 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:48.100
 practically impossible to use the commands 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:50.290
 of voice, right? 

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:52.950
 with him here he is stopped he goes 

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:54.460
 work perfectly the next 

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:58.390
 next 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:06:02.320
 other word than the command that is also 

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:04.030
 by default already here in the same 

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:11.440
 application is not 

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:18.340
 It's the play I get that it was just me. 

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:23.800
 say play the sound has started aa 

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:26.500
 run has started playing compare 

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:28.210
 As I said, we are currently using the 

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:31.590
 with the sound playing and with the sound 

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:34.110
 playing gets a little harder than 

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:36.009
 get the result in the voice command 

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:39.939
 but 

00:06:36.009 --> 00:06:42.639
 It's already very interesting, what is already 

00:06:39.939 --> 00:06:46.029
 it's possible to do is very interesting 

00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:48.399
 I hope you have enjoyed 

00:06:46.029 --> 00:06:50.319
 I like both features right. 

00:06:48.399 --> 00:06:54.279
 I found it quite interesting despite 

00:06:50.319 --> 00:06:58.689
 not be totally functional for 

00:06:54.279 --> 00:07:02.529
 all the commands he is already working 

00:06:58.689 --> 00:07:05.469
 well is a good part of it is so much for the 

00:07:02.529 --> 00:07:06.309
 camera while here for our music 

00:07:05.469 --> 00:07:08.800
 player 

00:07:06.309 --> 00:07:11.289
 and in that case you're curious 

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:13.629
 want to ask some more 

00:07:11.289 --> 00:07:16.300
 something about the function of the 

00:07:13.629 --> 00:07:18.639
 voice control or even about the 

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:21.490
 of the player or some curiosity about the 

00:07:18.639 --> 00:07:23.680
 camera are free to request 

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:27.459
 there in the comments area on the website at ac 

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:31.020
 on android with and we'll be 

00:07:27.459 --> 00:07:37.289
 with the videos where the staff is 

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:37.289
 wanting until the next video
