 The following modes of transport are taxis. 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.340
 there are shuttle buses on the beaches we 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.230
 so they never drove anything 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.330
 I will not say about them unofficial 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.550

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.640
 driving on the meter is quite profitable 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:44.100
 economically taxi tuk-tuk with which you are on 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.230
 place an average price 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:51.510
 the price of traveling a short distance 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:54.570
 about 400 rubles and a motorbike that is you 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.879
 lucky thai guy on his bike enough 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.370
 very interesting maybe someone 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.460
 like even this is the most budget 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.840
 mode of transport on mototaksi further on 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.659
 rental can be rented 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.490
 car rental price 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.880
 from small cars will start anywhere from 10 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.400
 thousand 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.260
 basically there are any cars starting 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.930
 from small end up huge 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.930
 Jeeps can also be rented 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.939
 Motobike bikes are different naturally 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.830
 there are few cubes of urns and here you can 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.960
 take even a motorcycle and a motorcycle 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.210
 anyone can take a sport bike you can take 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.299
 chopper any motorcycle enduro beauty all 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.610
 what do you want me and sasha chose a motorbike and 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.920
 so why do we Sasha chose the bike all 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.200
 very simple the first reason is traffic jams 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:41.119
 they are here if you have a bike 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.119
 there are no traffic jams all just very 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:09.360
 the second reason is the rental price 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.910
 bike is cheaper than a car in 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.640
 average from 3 to 8 thousand rubles per month 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:17.040
 the third reason is fuel consumption is very 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.620
 Low fuel consumption average from 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.230
 three liters per 100 kilometers 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:24.000
 if you would choose to rent a bike either 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.450
 car you will need of course 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.410
 the rights 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.640
 if you have rights of category a or b 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.910
 international they are here really 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:35.040
 if you took a bike and you do not have a category 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.800
 and then we have two options either 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.780
 pay a fine here the police sometimes 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.150
 make such small raids then 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.280
 have everyone check do the barrage 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.739
 check everyone who drives for availability 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.360
 right if you fall for it 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:50.400
 barrage you get to 500 baht 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.320
 automatically or there is a second option 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.209
 get right in one day just 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:57.000
 link to how to get these rights 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.800
 will be under the video further what should 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.320
 pay attention when choosing a bike where 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.440
 choose his best bike choose of course 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.910
 what is the official office 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:10.080
 not some kind of garage there I don't know 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:13.950
 shaky you come ask you how 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:16.519
 rule such documents or pledge better 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:19.700
 leave a photocopy of your passport either 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:21.750
 cash deposit usually this month 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.390
 Well, the cost of this pledge 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.040
 equal to the cost of a month rent a bike not 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.170
 leave your passport later 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.030
 problems you can fool try with 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.610
 you download more money playing 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.320
 some scratches 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:36.630
 farther i recommend also when you 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.400
 chose a bike to take photos and video 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.799
 This bike is even more so if it is on it 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.739
 scratch but also pay attention 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:45.120
 on the appearance of your bike starts 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:47.400
 try it ride just here 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.820
 around the place where you take it to 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.890
 rent 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:53.250
 you will immediately understand this is a normal bike or 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:55.190
 no it happens so they give a bike he 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.500
 start up there from the third time plus 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:59.310
 edition does not cause any 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.890
 the pleasure you don't get from him 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.209
 no therefore worth a ride on 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.040
 any bikes that you rent 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:08.010
