so<00:00:00.329> I<00:00:00.690> hope<00:00:01.020> then<00:00:01.290> that<00:00:01.319> you've<00:00:01.530> seen<00:00:01.770> that

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
so I hope then that you've seen that

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.519 
so I hope then that you've seen that
these<00:00:02.460> group<00:00:03.120> one<00:00:03.360> metals<00:00:03.750> are<00:00:04.020> very<00:00:04.049> very

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
these group one metals are very very

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.249 
these group one metals are very very
reactive<00:00:04.740> their<00:00:05.640> reactivity<00:00:06.089> is<00:00:06.420> all<00:00:06.600> due<00:00:06.960> to

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
reactive their reactivity is all due to

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:08.960 
reactive their reactivity is all due to
this<00:00:07.379> outermost<00:00:07.890> electron<00:00:08.550> that's<00:00:08.700> very

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
this outermost electron that's very

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.209 
this outermost electron that's very
easily<00:00:09.179> lost<00:00:09.630> and<00:00:10.320> they<00:00:10.380> have<00:00:10.530> all<00:00:10.740> sorts<00:00:10.769> of

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
easily lost and they have all sorts of

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:11.900 
easily lost and they have all sorts of
uses

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
uses

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.150

we<00:00:12.420> saw<00:00:12.540> the<00:00:12.599> cesium<00:00:13.110> how<00:00:13.320> because<00:00:13.860> it's<00:00:13.980> so

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
we saw the cesium how because it's so

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.430 
we saw the cesium how because it's so
heavy<00:00:14.460> this<00:00:15.059> is<00:00:15.269> used<00:00:15.540> in<00:00:15.809> drilling<00:00:16.049> for

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
heavy this is used in drilling for

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.740 
heavy this is used in drilling for
instance<00:00:16.770> cesium<00:00:17.220> salts<00:00:17.670> we've<00:00:18.090> seen<00:00:18.390> how

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
instance cesium salts we've seen how

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.420 
instance cesium salts we've seen how
many<00:00:18.810> of<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.199> other<00:00:19.350> metals<00:00:19.890> such<00:00:20.070> as<00:00:20.100> lithium

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
many of the other metals such as lithium

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.060 
many of the other metals such as lithium
and<00:00:20.820> sodium<00:00:20.850> can<00:00:21.570> be<00:00:21.660> used<00:00:21.869> in<00:00:22.080> batteries<00:00:22.650> to

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
and sodium can be used in batteries to

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.980 
and sodium can be used in batteries to
generate<00:00:23.369> energy<00:00:23.580> but<00:00:24.480> one<00:00:24.630> of<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.810> reactions

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
generate energy but one of the reactions

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.080 
generate energy but one of the reactions
we've<00:00:25.230> seen<00:00:25.500> is<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.949> generation<00:00:26.310> of<00:00:26.519> hydrogen

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
we've seen is the generation of hydrogen

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.939 
we've seen is the generation of hydrogen
gas<00:00:27.119> which<00:00:27.689> of<00:00:27.810> course<00:00:27.840> is<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.289> top<00:00:28.529> of<00:00:28.560> Group

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
gas which of course is the top of Group

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.589 
gas which of course is the top of Group
one<00:00:29.250> and<00:00:29.429> we're<00:00:29.970> going<00:00:30.090> to<00:00:30.119> go<00:00:30.210> out<00:00:30.330> with<00:00:30.449> a<00:00:30.480> bit

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
one and we're going to go out with a bit

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.690 
one and we're going to go out with a bit
of<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:30.750> bang<00:00:30.990> now<00:00:31.260> so<00:00:31.890> I<00:00:31.920> thought<00:00:32.219> how<00:00:32.399> can<00:00:32.460> we

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
of a bang now so I thought how can we

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.900 
of a bang now so I thought how can we
combine<00:00:32.880> what<00:00:33.329> we've<00:00:33.510> learnt<00:00:34.640> well<00:00:35.640> we've

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
combine what we've learnt well we've

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.310 
combine what we've learnt well we've
seen<00:00:36.239> that<00:00:36.920> sodium<00:00:37.920> hydride<00:00:38.809> reacts<00:00:39.809> with

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
seen that sodium hydride reacts with

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.400 
seen that sodium hydride reacts with
water<00:00:40.559> to<00:00:40.829> produce<00:00:41.040> hydrogen<00:00:41.460> gas<00:00:42.079> we've<00:00:43.079> seen

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
water to produce hydrogen gas we've seen

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.520 
water to produce hydrogen gas we've seen
that<00:00:43.920> potassium<00:00:44.730> superoxide<00:00:45.350> reacts<00:00:46.350> with

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
that potassium superoxide reacts with

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.639 
that potassium superoxide reacts with
water<00:00:46.680> to<00:00:46.920> give<00:00:47.129> us<00:00:47.219> oxygen<00:00:47.460> gas<00:00:48.050> okay<00:00:49.050> so<00:00:49.469> well

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
water to give us oxygen gas okay so well

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.560 
water to give us oxygen gas okay so well
maybe<00:00:49.829> if<00:00:49.980> we<00:00:50.070> mix<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.370> two<00:00:50.489> together<00:00:50.640> we<00:00:51.449> get

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
maybe if we mix the two together we get

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.510 
maybe if we mix the two together we get
a<00:00:51.629> mixture<00:00:51.840> of<00:00:52.050> hydrogen<00:00:52.590> oxygen<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.190> that

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
a mixture of hydrogen oxygen and that

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.549 
a mixture of hydrogen oxygen and that
should<00:00:53.699> go<00:00:53.820> with<00:00:53.969> a<00:00:54.000> nice<00:00:54.180> loud<00:00:54.449> bang<00:00:54.780> well

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
should go with a nice loud bang well

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.260 
should go with a nice loud bang well
that's<00:00:55.710> what<00:00:55.890> we're<00:00:56.010> going<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.190> try<00:00:56.460> now<00:00:56.760> now<00:00:57.239> I

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
that's what we're going to try now now I

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.490 
that's what we're going to try now now I
need<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:57.539> take<00:00:57.660> one<00:00:57.719> glove<00:00:58.109> off<00:00:58.260> because<00:00:58.469> I

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
need to take one glove off because I

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.799 
need to take one glove off because I
need<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:58.920> finger<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.399> put<00:00:59.520> in<00:00:59.609> my<00:00:59.699> ear<00:00:59.969> okay

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
need a finger to put in my ear okay

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.229 
need a finger to put in my ear okay
alright<00:01:01.559> so<00:01:02.219> first<00:01:02.430> of<00:01:02.670> all<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:03.000> sodium

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
alright so first of all the sodium

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.740 
alright so first of all the sodium
hydride<00:01:04.519> there<00:01:05.519> we<00:01:05.610> are<00:01:05.760> hopefully<00:01:06.600> that's

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
hydride there we are hopefully that's

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:07.940 
hydride there we are hopefully that's
going<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:06.930> sink<00:01:07.110> yes

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
going to sink yes

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.469 
going to sink yes
that's<00:01:08.189> giving<00:01:08.400> hydrogen<00:01:08.880> gas<00:01:09.060> now<00:01:09.420> the

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
that's giving hydrogen gas now the

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.230 
that's giving hydrogen gas now the
potassium<00:01:10.350> superoxide<00:01:11.060> so<00:01:12.060> that's

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
potassium superoxide so that's

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.600 
potassium superoxide so that's
generating<00:01:12.900> oxygen<00:01:13.110> gas<00:01:13.619> maybe<00:01:14.189> won't<00:01:14.430> go

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
generating oxygen gas maybe won't go

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.020 
generating oxygen gas maybe won't go
bang<00:01:14.790> yet<00:01:15.000> well<00:01:15.240> let's<00:01:15.390> see<00:01:15.860> not<00:01:16.860> bad<00:01:17.130> but<00:01:17.909> I'm

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
bang yet well let's see not bad but I'm

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.700 
bang yet well let's see not bad but I'm
sure<00:01:18.420> we<00:01:18.570> can<00:01:18.659> get<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:18.780> louder<00:01:19.049> one<00:01:19.320> than<00:01:19.500> that's

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
sure we can get a louder one than that's

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.100 
sure we can get a louder one than that's
if<00:01:19.920> we<00:01:20.040> get<00:01:20.189> them<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.549> mix<00:01:20.700> properly<00:01:21.000> so<00:01:21.840> let's

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
if we get them to mix properly so let's

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.020 
if we get them to mix properly so let's
apply<00:01:22.470> light<00:01:22.890> now<00:01:23.100> if<00:01:23.340> you<00:01:23.430> don't<00:01:23.610> like<00:01:23.820> loud

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
apply light now if you don't like loud

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.609 
apply light now if you don't like loud
bangs<00:01:24.330> I<00:01:24.479> do<00:01:24.540> recommend<00:01:25.020> putting<00:01:25.500> your

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
bangs I do recommend putting your

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:26.539 
bangs I do recommend putting your
fingers<00:01:25.920> in<00:01:26.040> your<00:01:26.159> ears

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
fingers in your ears

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.039 
fingers in your ears
okay<00:01:27.360> so<00:01:27.840> this<00:01:27.990> could<00:01:28.200> get<00:01:28.350> quite<00:01:28.650> loud

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:30.049 
okay so this could get quite loud

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:32.719 
okay so this could get quite loud
getting<00:01:31.049> quite<00:01:31.290> loud<00:01:31.500> I'm<00:01:32.130> sure<00:01:32.369> we<00:01:32.520> can<00:01:32.640> get

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
getting quite loud I'm sure we can get

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.969 
getting quite loud I'm sure we can get
louder<00:01:32.939> than<00:01:33.210> that<00:01:36.530> okay<00:01:37.530> let's<00:01:37.740> just<00:01:37.860> wait

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
louder than that okay let's just wait

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.740 
louder than that okay let's just wait
for<00:01:38.040> a<00:01:38.159> few<00:01:38.460> more<00:01:38.670> bubbles<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.240> come<00:01:39.390> here<00:01:39.600> so

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
for a few more bubbles to come here so

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.870 
for a few more bubbles to come here so
this<00:01:39.900> is<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.110> mixture<00:01:40.439> of<00:01:40.590> hydrogen<00:01:41.280> gas<00:01:41.579> and

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
this is the mixture of hydrogen gas and

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.490 
this is the mixture of hydrogen gas and
oxygen<00:01:42.240> gas<00:01:42.600> mixed<00:01:43.110> up<00:01:43.200> in<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.380> right

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
oxygen gas mixed up in the right

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.440 
oxygen gas mixed up in the right
proportions<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.549> hydrogen<00:01:45.030> coming<00:01:45.240> from

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
proportions the hydrogen coming from

quite<00:01:53.880> loud<00:01:54.560> we<00:01:55.560> got<00:01:55.649> to<00:01:55.740> get<00:01:55.829> one<00:01:55.950> more<00:01:56.130> maybe

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
quite loud we got to get one more maybe

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.429 
quite loud we got to get one more maybe
one<00:01:56.640> more<00:01:56.759> bang<00:01:57.000> out<00:01:57.180> of<00:01:57.360> this<00:01:57.540> oh<00:02:00.110> I<00:02:01.110> would<00:02:01.320> let

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
one more bang out of this oh I would let

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.219 
one more bang out of this oh I would let
them<00:02:01.530> build<00:02:01.710> up<00:02:01.829> a<00:02:01.950> bit<00:02:02.100> shall<00:02:02.310> we<00:02:02.340> yes

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
them build up a bit shall we yes

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:06.249 
them build up a bit shall we yes
it's<00:02:04.009> not<00:02:04.189> quite<00:02:04.430> enough<00:02:04.670> yet<00:02:04.960> nearly<00:02:05.960> there

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:06.259 
it's not quite enough yet nearly there

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:08.729 
it's not quite enough yet nearly there
while<00:02:06.500> it<00:02:06.619> sets<00:02:06.829> give<00:02:07.100> that<00:02:07.219> one<00:02:07.310> a<00:02:07.369> go<00:02:07.509> okay

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:08.739 
while it sets give that one a go okay

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:09.850 
while it sets give that one a go okay
oops

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
oops

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.479 
oops
oh<00:02:09.950> yes<00:02:10.580> nearly<00:02:10.879> there<00:02:11.680> okay<00:02:12.680> well<00:02:13.220> I<00:02:13.250> hope

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
oh yes nearly there okay well I hope

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:21.759 
oh yes nearly there okay well I hope
you've<00:02:13.790> enjoyed<00:02:14.390> the<00:02:14.690> lecture<00:02:18.940> and<00:02:20.590> there<00:02:21.590> are

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:21.769 
you've enjoyed the lecture and there are

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:25.720 
you've enjoyed the lecture and there are
many<00:02:22.370> more<00:02:22.720> activities<00:02:23.720> taking<00:02:24.650> place<00:02:24.830> over

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
many more activities taking place over

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.550 
many more activities taking place over
the<00:02:25.849> Science<00:02:26.209> Week<00:02:26.390> so<00:02:26.599> do<00:02:26.840> go<00:02:27.110> and<00:02:27.260> see<00:02:27.410> what

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
the Science Week so do go and see what

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.729 
the Science Week so do go and see what
else<00:02:27.739> is<00:02:27.980> is<00:02:28.819> happening<00:02:29.239> and<00:02:29.660> finally<00:02:30.560> then

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
else is is happening and finally then

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:32.680 
else is is happening and finally then
the<00:02:31.040> last<00:02:31.220> reaction<00:02:31.549> of<00:02:31.940> hydrogen<00:02:32.239> with

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
the last reaction of hydrogen with

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.539 
the last reaction of hydrogen with
oxygen<00:02:32.739> just<00:02:33.739> in<00:02:33.860> case<00:02:34.040> you<00:02:34.220> missed<00:02:34.400> the

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:34.549 
oxygen just in case you missed the

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:35.860 
oxygen just in case you missed the
earlier<00:02:34.910> balloon<00:02:35.239> perhaps<00:02:35.630> we've<00:02:35.780> got

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
earlier balloon perhaps we've got

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:42.250 
earlier balloon perhaps we've got
another<00:02:36.080> one<00:02:40.030> so<00:02:41.030> here<00:02:41.209> we<00:02:41.329> have<00:02:41.540> reaction<00:02:42.110> of

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
another one so here we have reaction of

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.440 
another one so here we have reaction of
hydrogen<00:02:42.680> with<00:02:43.519> the<00:02:43.549> oxygen<00:02:43.670> from<00:02:44.239> the<00:02:44.329> air

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
hydrogen with the oxygen from the air

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:45.850 
hydrogen with the oxygen from the air
thank<00:02:44.870> you<00:02:45.049> very<00:02:45.230> much<00:02:45.470> indeed

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
thank you very much indeed

00:02:45.860 --> 00:04:07.390 
thank you very much indeed
thank<00:02:46.130> you
