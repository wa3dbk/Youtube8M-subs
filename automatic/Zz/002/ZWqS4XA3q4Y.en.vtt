what you do for us this place to
redstone<00:01:02.840> repeaters<00:01:03.350> an<00:01:03.500> oldie<00:01:04.150> it's<00:01:05.150> like

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449 
redstone repeaters an oldie it's like

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:10.900 
redstone repeaters an oldie it's like
this<00:01:06.550> and<00:01:07.550> place<00:01:07.790> redstone<00:01:08.060> dust<00:01:08.750> and<00:01:09.580> i'll<00:01:10.580> be

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:10.910 
this and place redstone dust and i'll be

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:15.400 
this and place redstone dust and i'll be
going<00:01:11.360> through<00:01:11.630> each<00:01:11.810> repeater<00:01:13.840> then<00:01:14.840> your

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:15.410 
going through each repeater then your

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:18.040 
going through each repeater then your
redstone<00:01:15.740> torch<00:01:16.220> so<00:01:16.580> and<00:01:16.820> then<00:01:16.940> paris<00:01:17.869> on

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:18.050 
redstone torch so and then paris on

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.520 
redstone torch so and then paris on
torch<00:01:18.320> and<00:01:19.100> then<00:01:19.220> break<00:01:19.460> it<00:01:19.670> so<00:01:20.540> this<00:01:20.780> so<00:01:21.229> the

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
torch and then break it so this so the

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.560 
torch and then break it so this so the
redstone<00:01:22.040> is<00:01:22.070> on<00:01:22.340> then<00:01:22.940> take<00:01:23.240> your<00:01:23.330> redstone

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
redstone is on then take your redstone

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.560 
redstone is on then take your redstone
out<00:01:23.840> break<00:01:24.500> one<00:01:24.740> side<00:01:25.070> and<00:01:25.430> then<00:01:26.270> place<00:01:26.539> it

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
out break one side and then place it

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:32.340 
out break one side and then place it
back<00:01:26.869> so<00:01:27.140> goes<00:01:27.289> like<00:01:27.440> this<00:01:27.590> off

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.340 

it's<00:01:33.250> the<00:01:33.400> hard<00:01:33.610> part<00:01:33.909> so<00:01:34.540> it<00:01:34.659> goes<00:01:34.810> like<00:01:34.869> this

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
it's the hard part so it goes like this

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.120 
it's the hard part so it goes like this
it<00:01:36.860> goes<00:01:37.189> from<00:01:37.280> side<00:01:37.580> to<00:01:37.760> side<00:01:38.080> now<00:01:39.080> build<00:01:39.979> on

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
it goes from side to side now build on

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.130 
it goes from side to side now build on
from<00:01:40.340> one<00:01:40.490> corner

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.620 

phone

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630

five<00:01:46.259> redstone<00:01:47.009> dust<00:01:47.219> including<00:01:47.789> the<00:01:47.909> one

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
five redstone dust including the one

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.819 
five redstone dust including the one
back<00:01:48.270> there<00:01:48.649> one<00:01:49.649> place<00:01:49.969> sticky<00:01:50.969> piston<00:01:51.829> like

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
back there one place sticky piston like

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.670 
back there one place sticky piston like
so

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
so

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:00.190 
so
and<00:01:55.220> good<00:01:56.500> let<00:01:57.500> the<00:01:57.680> blockley<00:01:58.130> wat<00:01:59.020> do<00:02:00.020> diving

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
and good let the blockley wat do diving

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.860 
and good let the blockley wat do diving
blocks<00:02:00.590> in<00:02:00.710> this<00:02:00.830> example<00:02:01.420> replace<00:02:02.420> the<00:02:02.660> lock

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:02.870 
blocks in this example replace the lock

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:04.480 
blocks in this example replace the lock
right<00:02:03.080> in<00:02:03.260> front<00:02:03.470> of<00:02:03.590> sticky<00:02:03.860> piston<00:02:04.250> so

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
right in front of sticky piston so

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.000 
right in front of sticky piston so
actually<00:02:04.970> two<00:02:05.120> blocks<00:02:05.410> so<00:02:06.410> it<00:02:06.470> goes<00:02:06.650> up<00:02:06.830> and

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.010 
actually two blocks so it goes up and

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:10.719 
actually two blocks so it goes up and
then<00:02:07.100> goes<00:02:07.310> up<00:02:08.140> which<00:02:09.140> performs<00:02:09.830> like<00:02:10.310> this<00:02:10.520> I

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
then goes up which performs like this I

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:20.490 
then goes up which performs like this I
know<00:02:10.789> the<00:02:11.090> food's<00:02:11.390> has<00:02:11.750> it<00:02:11.990> um

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:21.990 

whatever<00:02:21.280> I'll<00:02:21.400> just<00:02:21.430> do<00:02:21.700> the<00:02:21.730> way<00:02:21.940> I

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
whatever I'll just do the way I

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.070 
whatever I'll just do the way I
memorized<00:02:22.960> it<00:02:24.330> so<00:02:25.330> let's<00:02:25.600> just<00:02:25.840> put<00:02:26.050> that

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
memorized it so let's just put that

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.070 
memorized it so let's just put that
there<00:02:26.260> out<00:02:27.070> I<00:02:27.430> usually<00:02:27.790> dirt<00:02:28.270> box<00:02:28.570> it<00:02:28.870> works

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
there out I usually dirt box it works

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.900 
there out I usually dirt box it works
best<00:02:29.320> for<00:02:29.500> me<00:02:29.650> their<00:02:30.220> choice<00:02:30.430> though<00:02:30.640> if<00:02:30.790> you

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
best for me their choice though if you

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.850 
best for me their choice though if you
need<00:02:31.060> any<00:02:31.240> blog<00:02:31.480> to<00:02:31.750> duplicate<00:02:32.230> in<00:02:32.380> any<00:02:32.560> block

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
need any blog to duplicate in any block

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.580 
need any blog to duplicate in any block
to<00:02:33.070> use<00:02:33.340> to<00:02:33.700> duplicate<00:02:34.180> then<00:02:34.990> place<00:02:35.230> the<00:02:35.380> tip

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
to use to duplicate then place the tip

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.130 
to use to duplicate then place the tip
place<00:02:36.040> to<00:02:36.520> block<00:02:36.910> the<00:02:37.270> dirt<00:02:37.480> block<00:02:37.780> where<00:02:38.020> any

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
place to block the dirt block where any

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.990 
place to block the dirt block where any
block<00:02:38.500> right<00:02:38.830> where<00:02:39.190> the<00:02:39.280> steve<00:02:39.490> has<00:02:39.700> students

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000

going<00:02:40.150> up<00:02:40.300> and<00:02:40.480> down<00:02:40.600> like<00:02:40.840> so<00:02:42.240> and<00:02:43.240> then<00:02:43.270> it's

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
going up and down like so and then it's

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.170 
going up and down like so and then it's
got<00:02:44.050> it's<00:02:44.470> a<00:02:44.860> little<00:02:45.130> hard<00:02:45.370> at<00:02:45.550> first<00:02:45.580> but
