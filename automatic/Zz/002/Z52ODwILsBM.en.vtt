00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.090 
cole run the show and it's going to be
interesting<00:00:59.820> to<00:01:00.120> see<00:01:00.420> how<00:01:00.690> he<00:01:00.719> does<00:01:01.020> with<00:01:01.890> this

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
interesting to see how he does with this

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.039 
interesting to see how he does with this
offense<00:01:02.609> so<00:01:02.879> I<00:01:02.940> think<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.239> Eagles<00:01:03.449> were<00:01:03.780> top

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
offense so I think the Eagles were top

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.140 
offense so I think the Eagles were top
10<00:01:04.379> min<00:01:04.559> or<00:01:04.830> fence<00:01:05.100> last<00:01:05.309> year<00:01:05.580> they<00:01:05.700> had<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:06.030> be

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
10 min or fence last year they had to be

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.980 
10 min or fence last year they had to be
I<00:01:06.390> guess<00:01:07.320> maybe<00:01:07.560> like<00:01:07.890> a<00:01:08.210> seventh<00:01:09.210> or<00:01:09.390> sixth<00:01:09.840> or

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
I guess maybe like a seventh or sixth or

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.780 
I guess maybe like a seventh or sixth or
something<00:01:10.619> like<00:01:10.740> that<00:01:10.799> bottom<00:01:11.220> line<00:01:11.400> is<00:01:11.610> they

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
something like that bottom line is they

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.450 
something like that bottom line is they
were<00:01:11.850> one<00:01:12.090> of<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.299> top<00:01:12.650> offensive<00:01:13.650> teams<00:01:13.950> and

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460
