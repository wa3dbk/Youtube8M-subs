copyright<00:00:19.529> trouble<00:00:21.410> actually<00:00:22.410> I<00:00:22.590> might<00:00:22.920> do<00:00:23.039> it

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
copyright trouble actually I might do it

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.519 
copyright trouble actually I might do it
early<00:00:23.369> because<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.939> song<00:00:24.330> will<00:00:24.539> be<00:00:24.750> in<00:00:25.289> the

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
early because the song will be in the

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.740 
early because the song will be in the
video<00:00:25.650> so<00:00:26.160> I<00:00:26.189> might<00:00:26.580> just<00:00:26.760> do<00:00:26.939> that<00:00:28.490> but<00:00:29.750> anyway

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
video so I might just do that but anyway

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
in it with this type of you know

the<00:00:43.710> same<00:00:44.190> he<00:00:44.250> always<00:00:44.489> does<00:00:44.930> but<00:00:45.930> it's

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
the same he always does but it's

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.630 
the same he always does but it's
still<00:00:46.379> pretty<00:00:46.559> fun<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:46.920> play<00:00:47.070> I<00:00:47.100> like<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:47.489> play

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
still pretty fun to play I like to play

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.520 
still pretty fun to play I like to play
it<00:00:47.820> a<00:00:48.000> little<00:00:48.390> bit<00:00:48.600> differently<00:00:48.960> than<00:00:49.200> what's

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
it a little bit differently than what's

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:50.869 
it a little bit differently than what's
in<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.770> song<00:00:49.980> to<00:00:50.340> make<00:00:50.489> it<00:00:50.610> like<00:00:50.760> a<00:00:50.789> little

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
in the song to make it like a little

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.540 
in the song to make it like a little
more<00:00:51.149> rock<00:00:51.390> so<00:00:51.719> it's<00:00:51.870> more<00:00:52.170> fun<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.379> play<00:00:52.620> I

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
more rock so it's more fun to play I

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.110 
more rock so it's more fun to play I
played<00:00:54.120> with<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.300> capo<00:00:54.750> second<00:00:55.350> ring<00:00:55.590> so<00:00:56.250> it'll

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
played with a capo second ring so it'll

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:05.509 
played with a capo second ring so it'll
sound<00:00:57.300> like<00:01:02.329> it<00:01:03.329> starts<00:01:03.750> off<00:01:03.899> with<00:01:04.519> pretty

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
sound like it starts off with pretty

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.870 
sound like it starts off with pretty
lengthy<00:01:05.850> intro<00:01:06.450> but<00:01:07.260> once<00:01:07.619> that<00:01:07.830> goes<00:01:08.670> into

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
lengthy intro but once that goes into

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.130 
lengthy intro but once that goes into
the<00:01:09.000> guitar<00:01:09.299> it<00:01:09.420> sounds<00:01:09.689> like<00:01:09.780> this

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:24.360 

you

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:24.370 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:26.910 

so<00:01:25.360> that's<00:01:25.540> the<00:01:25.660> same<00:01:26.380> thing<00:01:26.410> four<00:01:26.890> times

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
so that's the same thing four times

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.800 
so that's the same thing four times
through<00:01:27.400> it's<00:01:27.610> just<00:01:27.850> the<00:01:28.060> three<00:01:28.360> different

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
through it's just the three different

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:35.700 
through it's just the three different
chords<00:01:32.670> so<00:01:33.670> um<00:01:34.060> I<00:01:34.540> won't<00:01:34.960> really<00:01:35.140> go<00:01:35.350> into<00:01:35.560> any

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
chords so um I won't really go into any

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.210 
chords so um I won't really go into any
lengthy<00:01:37.560> discussion<00:01:38.560> about<00:01:38.740> like<00:01:38.920> what<00:01:39.100> the

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
lengthy discussion about like what the

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:40.740 
lengthy discussion about like what the
courts<00:01:39.490> are<00:01:39.610> I'll<00:01:39.760> just<00:01:39.940> have<00:01:40.150> a<00:01:40.180> little<00:01:40.450> tab

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
courts are I'll just have a little tab

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.410 
courts are I'll just have a little tab
for<00:01:41.380> the<00:01:42.160> for<00:01:42.640> the<00:01:42.670> song<00:01:42.940> so<00:01:43.150> you<00:01:43.240> don't<00:01:43.360> really

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
for the for the song so you don't really

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.660 
for the for the song so you don't really
have<00:01:43.570> to<00:01:43.630> worry<00:01:43.720> about<00:01:43.900> it<00:01:44.340> then<00:01:45.340> comes<00:01:45.580> a

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
have to worry about it then comes a

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.100 
have to worry about it then comes a
second<00:01:46.060> part<00:01:46.240> after<00:01:46.360> doing<00:01:46.600> that<00:01:46.720> whole<00:01:46.960> thing

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
second part after doing that whole thing

00:01:47.110 --> 00:02:02.859 
second part after doing that whole thing
four<00:01:47.350> times<00:01:47.380> it<00:01:47.710> goes<00:01:47.800> like<00:01:47.950> this

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:06.230 

so<00:02:03.869> that<00:02:04.320> is<00:02:04.710> a<00:02:04.890> little<00:02:05.250> bit<00:02:05.400> more<00:02:06.060> difficult

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
so that is a little bit more difficult

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.419 
so that is a little bit more difficult
because<00:02:06.570> you<00:02:06.780> got<00:02:06.930> kind<00:02:07.229> of<00:02:07.259> a<00:02:07.380> stretch<00:02:07.710> to<00:02:07.979> do

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
because you got kind of a stretch to do

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.910 
because you got kind of a stretch to do
on<00:02:08.670> that<00:02:09.119> first<00:02:09.390> chord<00:02:09.840> while<00:02:10.140> going<00:02:10.619> to<00:02:10.830> the

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
on that first chord while going to the

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:18.280 
on that first chord while going to the
second<00:02:11.220> chord<00:02:11.370> really<00:02:11.640> so<00:02:11.880> it<00:02:12.000> goes<00:02:14.360> and<00:02:15.360> then

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.960 

I'm<00:02:19.290> not<00:02:19.410> entirely<00:02:19.650> sure<00:02:19.830> on<00:02:19.980> when<00:02:20.790> that

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
I'm not entirely sure on when that

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.630 
I'm not entirely sure on when that
changes<00:02:21.420> from<00:02:22.230> these<00:02:22.530> two<00:02:23.100> different<00:02:23.250> chords

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
changes from these two different chords

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.750 
changes from these two different chords
back<00:02:23.760> and<00:02:23.940> forth<00:02:25.310> because<00:02:26.310> I've<00:02:26.489> only<00:02:26.610> heard

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
back and forth because I've only heard

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.449 
back and forth because I've only heard
the<00:02:26.910> song<00:02:27.090> a<00:02:27.120> couple<00:02:27.630> times<00:02:27.780> so<00:02:28.260> it's<00:02:29.220> pretty

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
the song a couple times so it's pretty

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.070 
the song a couple times so it's pretty
pretty<00:02:29.910> easy<00:02:30.090> to<00:02:30.209> figure<00:02:30.239> out<00:02:30.480> its<00:02:30.780> that's

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
pretty easy to figure out its that's

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.979 
pretty easy to figure out its that's
what<00:02:31.290> I'm<00:02:31.410> hearing<00:02:31.739> anyway<00:02:32.600> and<00:02:33.600> it<00:02:33.690> goes<00:02:33.840> into

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
what I'm hearing anyway and it goes into

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:37.460 
what I'm hearing anyway and it goes into
a<00:02:34.110> verse<00:02:34.440> where<00:02:35.750> it's<00:02:36.750> kind<00:02:37.110> of<00:02:37.170> hard<00:02:37.410> to

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
a verse where it's kind of hard to

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.380 
a verse where it's kind of hard to
really<00:02:37.680> decide<00:02:38.040> what<00:02:38.280> to<00:02:38.370> play<00:02:38.550> I<00:02:38.790> mean<00:02:39.000> I<00:02:39.180> like

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
really decide what to play I mean I like

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.570 
really decide what to play I mean I like
to<00:02:39.540> play<00:02:39.690> it<00:02:39.900> a<00:02:40.019> certain<00:02:40.050> way<00:02:40.410> that<00:02:41.130> just<00:02:41.340> kind

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
to play it a certain way that just kind

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:52.110 
to play it a certain way that just kind
of<00:02:41.610> goes<00:02:41.760> like<00:02:41.819> this

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.380 

and<00:02:52.810> then<00:02:52.959> just<00:02:53.110> repeats<00:02:53.849> there<00:02:54.849> is<00:02:55.030> another

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390

probably playing that part but it's a

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:14.490 
probably playing that part but it's a
little<00:03:13.450> softer<00:03:13.900> it's<00:03:14.049> not<00:03:14.170> like<00:03:14.319> just

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
like that I don't really I don't really

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.380 
like that I don't really I don't really
like<00:03:41.409> playing<00:03:41.650> that<00:03:41.920> part<00:03:42.099> but<00:03:42.400> I<00:03:42.430> mean<00:03:42.670> it's<00:03:43.060> I

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
like playing that part but I mean it's I

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:44.490 
like playing that part but I mean it's I
don't<00:03:43.599> really<00:03:43.720> think<00:03:43.870> it'd<00:03:44.019> be<00:03:44.049> that<00:03:44.140> hard<00:03:44.409> to

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
don't really think it'd be that hard to

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.220 
don't really think it'd be that hard to
figure<00:03:44.650> out<00:03:45.480> maybe<00:03:46.480> I'll<00:03:46.629> end<00:03:46.870> up<00:03:46.959> making<00:03:47.200> a

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
figure out maybe I'll end up making a

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:48.690 
figure out maybe I'll end up making a
video<00:03:47.409> on<00:03:47.590> how<00:03:47.680> to<00:03:47.709> do<00:03:47.890> that<00:03:48.040> a<00:03:48.220> little<00:03:48.549> later

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
video on how to do that a little later

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.729 
video on how to do that a little later
on<00:03:49.090> but<00:03:49.750> I<00:03:49.810> like<00:03:50.109> playing<00:03:50.260> those<00:03:50.530> little

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:50.739 
on but I like playing those little

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:52.500 
on but I like playing those little
chords<00:03:51.010> because<00:03:51.159> it's<00:03:51.519> I<00:03:51.790> think<00:03:52.150> it's<00:03:52.329> more

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
chords because it's I think it's more

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.149 
chords because it's I think it's more
fun<00:03:52.840> to<00:03:52.870> play<00:03:53.109> than<00:03:53.379> just<00:03:53.590> like<00:03:53.769> a<00:03:53.799> kind<00:03:54.069> of

00:03:54.149 --> 00:03:54.159 
fun to play than just like a kind of

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:56.370 
fun to play than just like a kind of
picking<00:03:55.150> part<00:03:55.390> that<00:03:55.510> you<00:03:55.599> can't<00:03:55.810> really<00:03:55.989> hear

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
picking part that you can't really hear

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:01.020 
picking part that you can't really hear
anyway<00:03:58.200> anyway<00:03:59.200> it<00:03:59.560> goes<00:03:59.709> into<00:03:59.919> a<00:04:00.370> course

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
anyway anyway it goes into a course

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.309 
anyway anyway it goes into a course
which<00:04:01.989> at<00:04:02.260> the<00:04:02.349> same<00:04:02.380> time<00:04:03.419> has<00:04:04.419> like<00:04:05.139> to

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:05.319

mention before like

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.050 
mention before like
Dave<00:04:10.560> usually<00:04:10.980> does<00:04:11.159> like<00:04:11.370> the<00:04:11.519> rhythm<00:04:11.849> part

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
Dave usually does like the rhythm part

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.280 
Dave usually does like the rhythm part
where<00:04:12.239> he's<00:04:12.329> playing<00:04:12.540> like<00:04:12.569> the<00:04:12.750> chords<00:04:13.079> and

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
where he's playing like the chords and

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.319 
where he's playing like the chords and
if<00:04:13.439> tom<00:04:13.680> is<00:04:13.709> even<00:04:14.129> playing<00:04:14.310> guitar<00:04:14.700> in<00:04:14.909> the

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:15.329 
if tom is even playing guitar in the

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:17.749 
if tom is even playing guitar in the
song<00:04:15.569> at<00:04:15.750> all<00:04:15.900> it's<00:04:16.829> usually<00:04:17.009> like<00:04:17.220> just<00:04:17.669> a

00:04:17.749 --> 00:04:17.759 
song at all it's usually like just a

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:21.170 
song at all it's usually like just a
like<00:04:17.910> a<00:04:17.940> little<00:04:18.239> melody<00:04:18.600> or<00:04:18.750> something<00:04:19.139> so<00:04:20.180> as

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
like a little melody or something so as

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.040 
like a little melody or something so as
far<00:04:21.449> as<00:04:21.509> I<00:04:21.660> can<00:04:21.720> tell<00:04:22.009> in<00:04:23.300> the<00:04:24.300> chorus<00:04:24.690> it<00:04:24.900> goes

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
far as I can tell in the chorus it goes

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:39.310 
far as I can tell in the chorus it goes
like<00:04:25.229> this

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.620 

that<00:04:40.320> would<00:04:40.470> be<00:04:40.620> more<00:04:40.980> of<00:04:41.100> David's<00:04:41.520> type<00:04:42.420> of

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
that would be more of David's type of

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.890 
that would be more of David's type of
playing<00:04:43.440> I<00:04:43.740> would<00:04:43.890> say<00:04:44.100> so<00:04:44.340> it's<00:04:44.910> just<00:04:45.090> four

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
playing I would say so it's just four

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:52.220 
playing I would say so it's just four
different<00:04:46.200> chords<00:04:49.970> and<00:04:50.970> then<00:04:51.450> Tom's<00:04:51.780> kind<00:04:52.140> of

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:52.230 
different chords and then Tom's kind of

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:54.350 
different chords and then Tom's kind of
doing<00:04:52.640> pretty<00:04:53.640> much<00:04:53.700> the<00:04:53.880> same<00:04:54.090> thing<00:04:54.270> it

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
doing pretty much the same thing it

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.180 
doing pretty much the same thing it
usually<00:04:54.600> does<00:04:54.780> something<00:04:55.410> along<00:04:55.890> the<00:04:56.010> lines

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
usually does something along the lines

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:03.270 
usually does something along the lines
like<00:04:56.370> this

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.790 

nothing<00:05:04.280> really<00:05:04.400> complicated<00:05:05.390> there<00:05:05.800> and

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 
nothing really complicated there and

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.920 
nothing really complicated there and
then<00:05:06.920> it<00:05:07.040> goes<00:05:07.190> into<00:05:07.220> like<00:05:07.970> a<00:05:08.000> post<00:05:08.390> chorus

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:08.930 
then it goes into like a post chorus

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:10.900 
then it goes into like a post chorus
kind<00:05:09.830> of<00:05:09.920> thing<00:05:10.040> it's<00:05:10.190> like<00:05:10.310> right<00:05:10.550> after<00:05:10.700> the

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:10.910 
kind of thing it's like right after the

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:12.640 
kind of thing it's like right after the
first<00:05:11.120> course<00:05:11.420> I<00:05:11.600> believe<00:05:11.840> and<00:05:12.320> goes<00:05:12.500> like

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.650 
first course I believe and goes like

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:16.030 
first course I believe and goes like
this

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:16.040 

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:20.159 

Oh

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:20.169 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:26.380 

Oh

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:26.390 

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:28.270 

that<00:05:26.840> just<00:05:26.990> goes<00:05:27.140> right<00:05:27.350> back<00:05:27.530> into<00:05:27.770> the<00:05:28.010> first

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:28.280 
that just goes right back into the first

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:31.780 
that just goes right back into the first
verse<00:05:28.580> so<00:05:29.300> those<00:05:29.690> notes<00:05:29.990> slower<00:05:30.640> I'll<00:05:31.640> just

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:31.790 
verse so those notes slower I'll just

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:33.970 
verse so those notes slower I'll just
play<00:05:32.030> the<00:05:32.270> notes<00:05:32.480> I<00:05:32.660> will<00:05:32.810> play<00:05:32.960> like<00:05:33.170> all<00:05:33.680> the

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:33.980 
play the notes I will play like all the

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:34.960 
play the notes I will play like all the
notes<00:05:34.220> I'll<00:05:34.370> just<00:05:34.490> play<00:05:34.610> like<00:05:34.640> each

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:34.970 
notes I'll just play like each

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:48.939 
notes I'll just play like each
individual<00:05:35.540> one

00:05:48.939 --> 00:05:48.949 

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:51.650 

it's<00:05:49.949> really<00:05:50.130> not<00:05:50.310> that<00:05:50.370> hard<00:05:50.550> to<00:05:50.790> remember

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:51.660 
it's really not that hard to remember

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:53.030 
it's really not that hard to remember
that<00:05:51.900> when<00:05:52.050> I<00:05:52.080> figured<00:05:52.410> out<00:05:52.560> and<00:05:52.680> maybe<00:05:52.860> like

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:53.040 
that when I figured out and maybe like

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:56.570 
that when I figured out and maybe like
30<00:05:53.639> seconds<00:05:54.180> I<00:05:54.360> don't<00:05:54.540> know<00:05:55.220> and<00:05:56.220> then<00:05:56.460> just

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:56.580 
30 seconds I don't know and then just

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:58.360 
30 seconds I don't know and then just
kind<00:05:56.729> of<00:05:56.820> repeats<00:05:57.150> for<00:05:57.419> the<00:05:57.720> rest<00:05:57.960> of<00:05:58.050> the<00:05:58.139> song

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:58.370 
kind of repeats for the rest of the song

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:01.490 
kind of repeats for the rest of the song
I<00:05:59.750> don't<00:06:00.750> really<00:06:00.840> think<00:06:00.930> there's<00:06:01.169> too<00:06:01.380> much

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:01.500 
I don't really think there's too much

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.620 
I don't really think there's too much
going<00:06:01.740> on<00:06:01.919> that<00:06:02.220> I<00:06:02.699> haven't<00:06:03.060> really<00:06:03.389> talked

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:03.630 
going on that I haven't really talked

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:06.260 
going on that I haven't really talked
about<00:06:03.750> except<00:06:04.229> for<00:06:04.699> that<00:06:05.699> little<00:06:05.880> verse

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:06.270 
about except for that little verse

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:08.029 
about except for that little verse
picking<00:06:07.020> rip<00:06:07.229> that<00:06:07.410> you<00:06:07.500> can't<00:06:07.740> really<00:06:07.919> hear

00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:08.039 
picking rip that you can't really hear

00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:12.409 
picking rip that you can't really hear
that<00:06:08.100> well<00:06:08.430> anyway<00:06:10.220> the<00:06:11.220> bridge<00:06:11.520> is<00:06:11.880> like<00:06:12.090> all

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:12.419 
that well anyway the bridge is like all

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:13.909 
that well anyway the bridge is like all
synth<00:06:12.810> and<00:06:13.080> that<00:06:13.199> just<00:06:13.380> goes<00:06:13.530> right<00:06:13.680> back<00:06:13.860> into

00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:13.919 
synth and that just goes right back into

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:15.890 
synth and that just goes right back into
the<00:06:14.100> last<00:06:14.340> chorus<00:06:14.940> and<00:06:15.240> then<00:06:15.360> it<00:06:15.539> just<00:06:15.660> kind<00:06:15.810> of

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:15.900 
the last chorus and then it just kind of

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:19.240 
the last chorus and then it just kind of
ends<00:06:16.259> so<00:06:16.650> I'm<00:06:17.460> going<00:06:17.610> to<00:06:17.639> leave<00:06:17.789> it<00:06:17.850> at<00:06:18.210> that

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:19.250 
ends so I'm going to leave it at that

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:22.760 
ends so I'm going to leave it at that

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:05.510 
signs I did you covers for so that I

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:07.240 
signs I did you covers for so that I
don't<00:07:05.960> really<00:07:06.170> know<00:07:06.380> exactly<00:07:06.410> how<00:07:06.950> many<00:07:07.010> of

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:07.250 
don't really know exactly how many of

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:09.250 
don't really know exactly how many of
the<00:07:07.310> songs<00:07:07.490> i'm<00:07:07.700> going<00:07:07.850> to<00:07:07.910> do<00:07:08.090> I<00:07:08.330> already<00:07:09.050> did

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:09.260 
the songs i'm going to do I already did

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.330 
the songs i'm going to do I already did
anxiety<00:07:09.770> anxiety<00:07:09.920> I'll<00:07:10.790> probably<00:07:11.060> do<00:07:11.390> inertia

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:12.340 
anxiety anxiety I'll probably do inertia

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:15.610 
anxiety anxiety I'll probably do inertia
I<00:07:13.340> do<00:07:14.030> like<00:07:14.330> the<00:07:14.360> old<00:07:14.780> of<00:07:14.900> pale<00:07:15.110> horse<00:07:15.410> but<00:07:15.590> I

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:15.620 
I do like the old of pale horse but I

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:19.390 
I do like the old of pale horse but I
remember<00:07:16.010> how<00:07:16.190> the<00:07:16.250> guitar<00:07:16.610> isn't<00:07:16.760> a<00:07:16.940> song<00:07:18.400> the

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:19.400 
remember how the guitar isn't a song the

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.010 
remember how the guitar isn't a song the
last<00:07:19.670> song<00:07:19.910> although<00:07:20.240> we<00:07:20.480> are<00:07:20.510> the<00:07:20.750> guitar

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:21.020 
last song although we are the guitar

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:24.630 
last song although we are the guitar
that<00:07:21.200> is<00:07:21.860> awesome<00:07:22.040> so<00:07:22.760> I'll<00:07:23.150> probably

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:24.640 
that is awesome so I'll probably

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:27.010 
that is awesome so I'll probably
figure<00:07:25.640> out<00:07:25.760> how<00:07:25.850> to<00:07:25.910> do<00:07:26.120> that<00:07:26.150> it's<00:07:26.870> like

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:27.020 
figure out how to do that it's like

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:29.320 
figure out how to do that it's like
three<00:07:27.560> minute<00:07:27.920> guitar<00:07:28.370> thing<00:07:28.880> at<00:07:29.030> the<00:07:29.150> end<00:07:29.180> of

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:29.330 
three minute guitar thing at the end of

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:35.290 
three minute guitar thing at the end of
the<00:07:29.420> song<00:07:31.270> let's<00:07:32.270> see<00:07:32.920> dry<00:07:33.920> your<00:07:34.100> eyes<00:07:34.160> I<00:07:34.880> think

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:35.300 
the song let's see dry your eyes I think

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:39.460 
the song let's see dry your eyes I think
as<00:07:35.480> some<00:07:36.170> decent<00:07:36.650> guitar<00:07:36.710> in<00:07:37.100> it<00:07:38.080> so<00:07:39.080> I<00:07:39.110> don't

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:39.470 
as some decent guitar in it so I don't
