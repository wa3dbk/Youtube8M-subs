00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:10.049
 It is a form of self - expression 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.030
 I think this is about beyond clothing 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:13.710
 but of the people who use it and that a 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.070
 crime his personality with what he supposes 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.070
 at daytime 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:23.300
 now dressing is a daily exercise 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.640
 we all do it in the morning and the 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.440
 menus almost automatically but not 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.240
 because it is automatic stops having 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.950
 importance in everyone's life because 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.200
 finally we all continue dressed 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:35.890
 some way and we give a message to 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.890
 through rice 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.650
 the important thing to get to find the 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.010
 distinguishes is a bit first with the sun 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:52.250
 be yourself 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:54.949
 then accept it was accepted that he nor a 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:57.039
 fifty meter accepted that this my weight 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:59.750
 He accepted that I have slanted eyes 

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:01.670
 etcetera and work from dense 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.789
 to know how I want others to 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.789
 see 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:16.940
 and I think hair is important 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:19.790
 to make a balance between the look and the 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:22.580
 that you project, I think it's important if 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:26.020
 you want to do well to have everything and 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.020
 complete parts 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:39.370
 I would like you to feel them with a 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:41.800
 close block of a normal girl who 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:44.020
 live a daily life like all 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.840
 that has different ways of approaching 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.909
 to love 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.369
 and that they realize that you have to leave 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:53.030
 the complexes aside and motivate themselves to 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.030
 do what one wants 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.770
 my name is romina, she calls me 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.770
