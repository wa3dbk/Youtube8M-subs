in this video I'm going to be checking
out<00:00:04.410> the<00:00:04.620> crystal<00:00:04.980> hatchet<00:00:05.370> and<00:00:05.460> pickaxe

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
out the crystal hatchet and pickaxe

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:07.579 
out the crystal hatchet and pickaxe
showing<00:00:06.330> you<00:00:06.390> guys<00:00:06.509> how<00:00:06.569> to<00:00:06.779> get<00:00:06.990> them<00:00:07.140> tell

showing you guys how to get them tell

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.080 
showing you guys how to get them tell
you<00:00:07.710> what<00:00:07.830> the<00:00:07.919> requirements<00:00:08.429> are<00:00:08.519> and<00:00:08.700> also

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
you what the requirements are and also

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.120 
you what the requirements are and also
testing<00:00:09.780> them<00:00:09.900> versus<00:00:10.230> the<00:00:10.380> dragon<00:00:10.860> hatchet

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
testing them versus the dragon hatchet

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.499 
testing them versus the dragon hatchet
pickaxe<00:00:11.519> and<00:00:11.639> telling<00:00:11.910> you<00:00:11.969> if<00:00:12.150> it's<00:00:12.300> worth

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
pickaxe and telling you if it's worth

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.509 
pickaxe and telling you if it's worth
your<00:00:12.719> time<00:00:12.929> collecting<00:00:13.650> all<00:00:13.799> the<00:00:13.980> harmonic

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
your time collecting all the harmonic

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.129 
your time collecting all the harmonic
dust<00:00:14.790> and<00:00:15.000> needed<00:00:15.269> to<00:00:15.570> turn<00:00:15.809> them<00:00:15.990> into

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
dust and needed to turn them into

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.019 
dust and needed to turn them into
crystal<00:00:16.830> which<00:00:16.980> will<00:00:17.160> also<00:00:17.550> make<00:00:17.880> them

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
crystal which will also make them

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.429 
crystal which will also make them
untradable<00:00:18.330> so<00:00:18.630> you<00:00:18.720> can't<00:00:18.990> sell<00:00:19.199> them<00:00:19.320> back

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
untradable so you can't sell them back

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.230 
untradable so you can't sell them back
later<00:00:19.710> so<00:00:19.890> you<00:00:19.920> have<00:00:20.070> to<00:00:20.130> be<00:00:20.220> aware<00:00:20.369> of<00:00:20.430> that<00:00:20.640> so

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
later so you have to be aware of that so

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.490 
later so you have to be aware of that so
to<00:00:21.300> get<00:00:21.449> this<00:00:21.600> harmonic<00:00:22.050> dust<00:00:22.230> I've<00:00:22.380> been

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
to get this harmonic dust I've been

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.840 
to get this harmonic dust I've been
talking<00:00:22.769> about<00:00:22.859> you<00:00:23.250> need<00:00:23.400> to<00:00:23.490> have<00:00:23.580> a<00:00:23.640> level

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
talking about you need to have a level

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.060 
talking about you need to have a level

City<00:00:26.130> and<00:00:26.490> you<00:00:26.789> just<00:00:26.939> come<00:00:27.119> to<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.420> far

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
City and you just come to the far

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:28.939 
City and you just come to the far
western<00:00:28.050> part<00:00:28.109> of<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.410> city<00:00:28.560> and<00:00:28.830> there's

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
western part of the city and there's

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.370 
western part of the city and there's
these<00:00:29.160> four<00:00:29.220> harps<00:00:29.910> in<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.570> in<00:00:30.750> Saline<00:00:31.140> part

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
these four harps in the in Saline part

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.720 
these four harps in the in Saline part
of<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:31.949> city<00:00:32.130> I<00:00:32.189> believe<00:00:32.430> that's<00:00:32.610> how<00:00:32.700> you

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
of the city I believe that's how you

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.639 
of the city I believe that's how you
pronounce<00:00:32.850> it<00:00:33.270> and<00:00:33.390> then<00:00:33.930> you<00:00:34.020> just<00:00:34.230> have<00:00:34.500> to

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
pronounce it and then you just have to

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.020 
pronounce it and then you just have to
go<00:00:34.800> ham<00:00:35.010> on<00:00:35.160> those<00:00:35.309> harps<00:00:35.610> and<00:00:35.670> it<00:00:35.790> takes<00:00:35.940> a

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
go ham on those harps and it takes a

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.549 
go ham on those harps and it takes a
really<00:00:36.149> long<00:00:36.239> time<00:00:36.390> I<00:00:36.780> found<00:00:37.230> that<00:00:37.410> I<00:00:37.500> was

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
really long time I found that I was

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.010 
really long time I found that I was
getting<00:00:37.829> about<00:00:38.129> 800<00:00:38.670> dust<00:00:38.879> per<00:00:39.090> hour<00:00:39.239> so<00:00:39.750> it's

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
getting about 800 dust per hour so it's

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.810 
getting about 800 dust per hour so it's
going<00:00:40.410> to<00:00:40.530> take<00:00:40.710> you<00:00:40.890> a<00:00:40.920> full<00:00:41.160> 10<00:00:41.340> hours<00:00:41.610> to<00:00:41.730> get

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
going to take you a full 10 hours to get

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.150 
going to take you a full 10 hours to get
all<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.210> dust<00:00:42.420> but<00:00:42.840> it<00:00:42.930> is<00:00:43.050> super<00:00:43.260> afk<00:00:43.890> and<00:00:44.100> you

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
all the dust but it is super afk and you

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.100 
all the dust but it is super afk and you
get<00:00:44.280> crafting<00:00:44.640> xp<00:00:44.940> for<00:00:44.969> it<00:00:45.239> for<00:00:45.450> completely

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
get crafting xp for it for completely

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.440 
get crafting xp for it for completely
free<00:00:46.260> it's<00:00:46.770> not<00:00:47.070> very<00:00:47.460> good<00:00:47.670> crafting<00:00:48.090> XP<00:00:48.329> per

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
free it's not very good crafting XP per

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.600 
free it's not very good crafting XP per
hour<00:00:48.600> it's<00:00:48.809> only<00:00:48.930> about<00:00:49.079> 70<00:00:49.829> K<00:00:49.980> or<00:00:50.100> so<00:00:50.250> so<00:00:50.489> it's

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
hour it's only about 70 K or so so it's

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.729 
hour it's only about 70 K or so so it's
kind<00:00:50.940> of<00:00:51.000> similar<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.629> speed<00:00:51.840> of<00:00:52.020> IV<00:00:52.379> but

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
kind of similar to the speed of IV but

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.709 
kind of similar to the speed of IV but
again<00:00:52.980> just<00:00:53.219> like<00:00:53.309> IV<00:00:53.640> it's<00:00:53.760> also<00:00:53.910> super<00:00:54.270> afk

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
again just like IV it's also super afk

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.360 
again just like IV it's also super afk
and<00:00:54.840> really<00:00:55.050> easy<00:00:55.199> to<00:00:55.379> do<00:00:55.500> if<00:00:55.980> you're<00:00:56.219> watching

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
and really easy to do if you're watching

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.920 
and really easy to do if you're watching
a<00:00:56.670> movie<00:00:56.699> or<00:00:56.969> playing<00:00:57.390> on<00:00:57.510> your<00:00:57.600> Ironman

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
a movie or playing on your Ironman

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.110 
a movie or playing on your Ironman
encounter<00:00:58.289> water<00:00:58.469> you<00:00:58.890> can<00:00:59.129> just<00:00:59.309> go<00:00:59.609> ham<00:00:59.879> at

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
encounter water you can just go ham at

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.330 
encounter water you can just go ham at
that<00:01:00.449> harmonic<00:01:00.989> does<00:01:01.170> stuff<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:01.620> you'll<00:01:02.190> get

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
that harmonic does stuff and you'll get

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.299 
that harmonic does stuff and you'll get
it<00:01:02.460> done<00:01:02.579> eventually<00:01:03.239> so<00:01:03.719> I<00:01:03.750> got<00:01:04.140> 8k<00:01:04.559> so<00:01:04.949> that

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
it done eventually so I got 8k so that

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.250 
it done eventually so I got 8k so that
is<00:01:05.460> four<00:01:05.700> thousand<00:01:06.090> for<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.420> crystal<00:01:06.840> hatchet

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
is four thousand for the crystal hatchet

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.870 
is four thousand for the crystal hatchet
in<00:01:07.380> four<00:01:07.590> thousand<00:01:07.979> for<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.280> crystal<00:01:08.580> pickaxe

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
in four thousand for the crystal pickaxe

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.840 
in four thousand for the crystal pickaxe
you<00:01:09.360> just<00:01:09.540> talk<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:09.869> lady<00:01:10.170> ethylene<00:01:10.650> and<00:01:10.850> have

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
you just talk to lady ethylene and have

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.700 
you just talk to lady ethylene and have
her<00:01:12.030> turn<00:01:12.390> both<00:01:12.630> of<00:01:12.689> your<00:01:12.990> dragon<00:01:13.350> hatchet<00:01:13.619> in

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
her turn both of your dragon hatchet in

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.620 
her turn both of your dragon hatchet in
your<00:01:13.830> pickaxe<00:01:14.010> into<00:01:14.520> crystal<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:15.299> then<00:01:15.420> I<00:01:15.450> put

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
your pickaxe into crystal and then I put

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.359 
your pickaxe into crystal and then I put
them<00:01:15.750> both<00:01:15.840> in<00:01:16.049> my<00:01:16.229> tool<00:01:16.439> belt<00:01:16.590> so<00:01:17.159> where<00:01:17.340> I

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
them both in my tool belt so where I

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.280 
them both in my tool belt so where I
decided<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:17.909> test<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.210> crystal<00:01:18.600> pickaxe<00:01:18.990> was

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
decided to test the crystal pickaxe was

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.590 
decided to test the crystal pickaxe was
at<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.619> serán<00:01:20.009> stones<00:01:20.310> because<00:01:20.729> a<00:01:20.909> few<00:01:21.360> weeks

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
at the serán stones because a few weeks

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.510 
at the serán stones because a few weeks
ago<00:01:21.780> I<00:01:21.900> did<00:01:22.259> do<00:01:22.409> a<00:01:22.439> video<00:01:22.650> testing<00:01:23.280> out<00:01:23.400> the

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
ago I did do a video testing out the

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.340 
ago I did do a video testing out the
sarin<00:01:23.850> stones<00:01:24.119> as<00:01:24.360> well<00:01:24.689> as<00:01:24.810> elf<00:01:25.020> City

thieving<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:26.070> XP<00:01:26.520> rate<00:01:26.729> of<00:01:26.880> doing<00:01:27.180> that<00:01:27.299> so<00:01:27.689> I

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
thieving the XP rate of doing that so I

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.600 
thieving the XP rate of doing that so I
did<00:01:27.960> kind<00:01:28.200> of<00:01:28.290> know<00:01:28.409> a<00:01:28.439> rough<00:01:28.860> estimate<00:01:29.280> of<00:01:29.340> how

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
did kind of know a rough estimate of how

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.700 
did kind of know a rough estimate of how
much<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.240> Xperia<00:01:30.630> was<00:01:30.780> going<00:01:30.930> to<00:01:31.020> do<00:01:31.140> I<00:01:31.290> did<00:01:31.650> a

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
much the Xperia was going to do I did a

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.380 
much the Xperia was going to do I did a
test<00:01:31.890> of<00:01:32.070> one<00:01:32.220> hour<00:01:32.369> service<00:01:32.729> tones<00:01:32.939> using<00:01:33.180> a

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
the XP that I was getting I did a full

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.749 
the XP that I was getting I did a full
hour<00:01:46.020> at<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.590> sarahdan<00:01:46.950> stones<00:01:47.220> here<00:01:47.610> and

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
hour at the sarahdan stones here and

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.700 
hour at the sarahdan stones here and
with<00:01:48.329> my<00:01:48.479> lava<00:01:48.659> Titan<00:01:49.079> out<00:01:49.200> and<00:01:49.409> all<00:01:49.500> of<00:01:49.619> my

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
with my lava Titan out and all of my

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.170 
with my lava Titan out and all of my
crystal<00:01:50.100> pickaxe<00:01:50.399> which<00:01:50.579> looks<00:01:50.790> really<00:01:51.030> cool

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
crystal pickaxe which looks really cool

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.730 
crystal pickaxe which looks really cool
and<00:01:51.360> there's<00:01:51.509> a<00:01:51.630> lot<00:01:51.960> of<00:01:52.079> people<00:01:52.290> who<00:01:52.380> had<00:01:52.590> them

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
and there's a lot of people who had them

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.980 
and there's a lot of people who had them
already<00:01:53.009> so<00:01:53.460> this<00:01:53.640> was<00:01:53.820> pretty<00:01:53.970> AFK<00:01:54.420> I<00:01:54.659> tried

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
already so this was pretty AFK I tried

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.510 
already so this was pretty AFK I tried
my<00:01:55.110> best<00:01:55.140> to<00:01:55.500> make<00:01:55.740> sure<00:01:55.770> that<00:01:56.040> my<00:01:56.189> character

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
my best to make sure that my character

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.280 
my best to make sure that my character
was<00:01:56.610> mining<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.060> whole<00:01:57.270> time<00:01:57.540> and<00:01:57.780> didn't

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
was mining the whole time and didn't

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.440 
was mining the whole time and didn't
slack<00:01:58.560> off<00:01:58.740> too<00:01:59.009> much<00:01:59.159> in<00:01:59.369> terms<00:01:59.579> of<00:01:59.790> the<00:01:59.850> afk

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
slack off too much in terms of the afk

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.959 
slack off too much in terms of the afk
also<00:02:01.170> I<00:02:01.409> just<00:02:01.619> wanted<00:02:01.829> to<00:02:01.950> show<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.310> old<00:02:02.579> XP

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
also I just wanted to show the old XP

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.670 
also I just wanted to show the old XP
rate<00:02:03.270> that<00:02:03.420> I<00:02:03.509> got<00:02:03.719> this<00:02:03.930> was<00:02:04.200> from<00:02:04.500> the

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
rate that I got this was from the

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.520 
rate that I got this was from the
previous<00:02:05.219> video<00:02:05.549> of<00:02:05.729> doing<00:02:06.479> one<00:02:06.780> hour<00:02:07.020> of<00:02:07.290> mine

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
previous video of doing one hour of mine

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.800 
previous video of doing one hour of mine
at<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.799> Saren<00:02:08.160> stones<00:02:08.399> and<00:02:08.550> from<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.420> results

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
at the Saren stones and from the results

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.220 
at the Saren stones and from the results
of<00:02:09.899> that<00:02:10.080> video<00:02:10.379> I<00:02:10.440> got<00:02:10.679> 137<00:02:11.670> K<00:02:12.209> mining<00:02:12.660> XP<00:02:13.020> with

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
of that video I got 137 K mining XP with

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.830 
of that video I got 137 K mining XP with
my<00:02:13.410> dry

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
my dry

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.540 
my dry
pick<00:02:14.080> so<00:02:14.560> that<00:02:14.739> was<00:02:14.920> the<00:02:15.040> number<00:02:15.190> that<00:02:15.459> the

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
pick so that was the number that the

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.309 
pick so that was the number that the
crystal<00:02:15.880> pick<00:02:16.030> was<00:02:16.209> going<00:02:16.569> up<00:02:16.750> against<00:02:17.170> and

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
crystal pick was going up against and

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:19.979 
crystal pick was going up against and
seeing<00:02:17.920> how<00:02:18.130> fast<00:02:18.520> the<00:02:19.150> crystal<00:02:19.690> pick<00:02:19.840> is

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
seeing how fast the crystal pick is

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:22.140 
seeing how fast the crystal pick is
versus<00:02:20.530> the<00:02:20.650> old<00:02:20.830> dragon<00:02:21.220> pick<00:02:21.459> so<00:02:21.849> after

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
versus the old dragon pick so after

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.580 
versus the old dragon pick so after
doing<00:02:22.239> a<00:02:22.420> full<00:02:22.599> hour<00:02:22.780> at<00:02:22.959> the<00:02:23.080> CERN<00:02:23.290> stones

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.400 
faster they cut or you know chop logs is
15<00:02:48.400> percent<00:02:48.760> so<00:02:49.090> it<00:02:49.209> seems<00:02:49.480> that<00:02:49.750> the<00:02:49.959> crystal

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
15 percent so it seems that the crystal

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.190 
15 percent so it seems that the crystal
pick<00:02:50.590> and<00:02:50.799> the<00:02:50.980> dragon<00:02:51.489> have<00:02:51.850> the<00:02:52.120> same<00:02:52.360> 15%

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
pick and the dragon have the same 15%

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.809 
pick and the dragon have the same 15%
faster<00:02:53.440> difference<00:02:53.950> between<00:02:54.310> the<00:02:54.430> two<00:02:54.580> and

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:54.819 
faster difference between the two and

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:56.400 
faster difference between the two and
next<00:02:55.269> we<00:02:55.390> moved<00:02:55.569> on<00:02:55.750> to<00:02:55.780> the<00:02:55.930> wood<00:02:56.080> cutting

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
next we moved on to the wood cutting

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.140 
next we moved on to the wood cutting
unfortunately<00:02:57.160> I<00:02:57.190> didn't<00:02:57.489> have<00:02:57.519> any<00:02:57.790> videos

that I had made in the past testing out

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:02.130 
that I had made in the past testing out

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
the XP rates of wood cutting because you

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.390 
the XP rates of wood cutting because you
know<00:03:02.260> the<00:03:02.380> thought<00:03:02.530> really<00:03:02.739> never<00:03:03.010> crossed<00:03:03.280> my

hour<00:03:39.430> spent<00:03:40.060> at<00:03:40.239> crystal<00:03:40.690> trees<00:03:40.900> I<00:03:41.049> managed<00:03:41.410> to

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
hour spent at crystal trees I managed to

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.140 
hour spent at crystal trees I managed to
get<00:03:41.590> myself<00:03:41.739> just<00:03:42.160> about<00:03:42.370> exactly<00:03:42.700> a<00:03:42.880> hundred

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
get myself just about exactly a hundred

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.840 
get myself just about exactly a hundred
and<00:03:43.450> fifteen<00:03:43.870> K<00:03:44.139> wood<00:03:44.650> code<00:03:44.829> in<00:03:44.950> XP<00:03:45.280> which<00:03:45.700> is

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
and fifteen K wood code in XP which is

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:47.580 
and fifteen K wood code in XP which is
really<00:03:46.150> nice<00:03:46.299> because<00:03:46.359> that's<00:03:46.870> additionally

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
really nice because that's additionally

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.430 
really nice because that's additionally
15%<00:03:48.340> faster<00:03:48.579> then<00:03:49.180> it<00:03:49.540> was<00:03:49.720> with<00:03:49.959> the<00:03:50.079> dragon

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
15% faster then it was with the dragon

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.349 
15% faster then it was with the dragon
hatchet<00:03:50.769> so<00:03:51.010> that<00:03:51.370> means<00:03:51.730> that<00:03:52.000> both<00:03:52.209> the

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:52.359 
hatchet so that means that both the

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:54.210 
hatchet so that means that both the
crystal<00:03:52.690> hatchet<00:03:53.079> and<00:03:53.170> pickaxe<00:03:53.530> are<00:03:53.739> just

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
crystal hatchet and pickaxe are just

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.490 
crystal hatchet and pickaxe are just
about<00:03:54.370> 15%<00:03:54.700> faster<00:03:55.120> and<00:03:55.540> in<00:03:55.630> my<00:03:56.079> mind<00:03:56.350> that's

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
about 15% faster and in my mind that's

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.020 
about 15% faster and in my mind that's
really<00:03:56.920> really<00:03:57.130> worth<00:03:57.310> getting<00:03:57.519> even<00:03:57.940> though

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
really really worth getting even though

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.030 
really really worth getting even though
it<00:03:58.120> takes<00:03:58.299> about<00:03:58.420> five<00:03:58.810> hours<00:03:59.230> to<00:03:59.440> obtain<00:03:59.799> each

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
it takes about five hours to obtain each

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.190 
it takes about five hours to obtain each
of<00:04:00.250> them<00:04:00.430> because<00:04:01.000> getting<00:04:01.569> that<00:04:01.690> harmonic

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
of them because getting that harmonic

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.840 
of them because getting that harmonic
dust<00:04:02.470> from<00:04:02.650> the<00:04:02.769> elf<00:04:02.889> City<00:04:02.980> is<00:04:03.250> just<00:04:03.280> really

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:03.850 
dust from the elf City is just really

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:05.250 
dust from the elf City is just really
really<00:04:03.940> slow<00:04:04.299> so<00:04:04.510> you're<00:04:04.900> going<00:04:05.079> to<00:04:05.170> be

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
really slow so you're going to be

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.259 
really slow so you're going to be
spending<00:04:05.530> a<00:04:05.769> lot<00:04:06.010> of<00:04:06.069> time<00:04:06.250> at<00:04:06.609> those<00:04:06.730> harps<00:04:07.120> I

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:07.269 
spending a lot of time at those harps I

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:09.030 
spending a lot of time at those harps I
think<00:04:07.840> it's<00:04:07.959> worth<00:04:08.139> in<00:04:08.319> the<00:04:08.410> long<00:04:08.590> run<00:04:08.829> because

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
think it's worth in the long run because

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.770 
think it's worth in the long run because
you<00:04:09.370> do<00:04:09.579> get<00:04:09.700> the<00:04:09.819> free<00:04:09.970> crafting<00:04:10.359> XP<00:04:10.630> from

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
you do get the free crafting XP from

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.330 
you do get the free crafting XP from
them<00:04:10.989> of<00:04:11.170> course<00:04:11.350> and<00:04:11.650> it's<00:04:11.950> going<00:04:12.130> to<00:04:12.190> save

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
wood cutting to use these two tools and

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.000 
wood cutting to use these two tools and
I<00:04:22.990> mention<00:04:23.349> that<00:04:23.440> most<00:04:23.590> people<00:04:23.890> that<00:04:23.950> have

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.010 
I mention that most people that have

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:25.920 
I mention that most people that have
access<00:04:24.550> to<00:04:24.580> the<00:04:24.849> elf<00:04:25.000> City<00:04:25.090> are<00:04:25.390> going<00:04:25.690> to<00:04:25.780> have

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
access to the elf City are going to have

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.000 
access to the elf City are going to have
those<00:04:26.080> requirements<00:04:26.380> they're<00:04:26.770> not<00:04:26.890> too

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
those requirements they're not too

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.550 
those requirements they're not too
difficult

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
difficult

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.020 
difficult
so<00:04:27.800> that's<00:04:27.980> about<00:04:28.100> all<00:04:28.250> for<00:04:28.520> my<00:04:28.580> test<00:04:28.820> and

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
so that's about all for my test and

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:30.400 
so that's about all for my test and
review<00:04:29.270> of<00:04:29.420> the<00:04:29.510> two<00:04:29.690> new<00:04:29.870> crystal<00:04:30.260> tools

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
review of the two new crystal tools

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:32.379 
review of the two new crystal tools
looks<00:04:30.650> like<00:04:30.770> they're<00:04:30.889> about<00:04:31.070> 15%<00:04:31.460> faster<00:04:32.120> and

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:32.389 
looks like they're about 15% faster and

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:34.629 
looks like they're about 15% faster and
not<00:04:32.630> too<00:04:32.990> difficult<00:04:33.590> to<00:04:33.770> obtain<00:04:33.950> I<00:04:34.340> just

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:34.639 
not too difficult to obtain I just

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:35.800 
not too difficult to obtain I just
