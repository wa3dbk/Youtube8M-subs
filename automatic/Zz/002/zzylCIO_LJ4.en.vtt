here's<00:00:01.800> my<00:00:02.100> big<00:00:02.399> fiery<00:00:02.760> furnace<00:00:04.730> this<00:00:05.730> is<00:00:05.879> my

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
here's my big fiery furnace this is my

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.339 
here's my big fiery furnace this is my
wood<00:00:06.569> furnace<00:00:06.980> that's<00:00:07.980> my<00:00:08.160> cold<00:00:08.429> air<00:00:08.610> intake

00:00:09.339 --> 00:00:09.349 
wood furnace that's my cold air intake

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:12.560 
wood furnace that's my cold air intake
and<00:00:10.349> I<00:00:10.530> have<00:00:10.710> my<00:00:10.860> oil<00:00:11.070> furnace<00:00:11.700> back<00:00:11.910> up<00:00:12.150> right

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
and I have my oil furnace back up right

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.800 
and I have my oil furnace back up right
there<00:00:13.099> and<00:00:14.099> I'll<00:00:15.030> walk<00:00:15.299> over<00:00:15.570> him<00:00:15.900> so<00:00:16.590> here<00:00:17.580> is

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:17.810 
there and I'll walk over him so here is

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.750 
there and I'll walk over him so here is
my<00:00:18.810> brand<00:00:19.289> new<00:00:19.410> water<00:00:19.859> tank<00:00:20.160> on<00:00:20.460> that<00:00:20.730> I

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
my brand new water tank on that I

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.029 
my brand new water tank on that I
purchased<00:00:21.300> I<00:00:21.539> had<00:00:22.170> an<00:00:22.289> old<00:00:22.439> one<00:00:22.650> but<00:00:22.800> it<00:00:22.920> was

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
purchased I had an old one but it was

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.290 
purchased I had an old one but it was
all<00:00:23.189> rusty<00:00:23.550> and<00:00:23.580> it<00:00:23.730> wasn't<00:00:23.970> really<00:00:24.060> working

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
all rusty and it wasn't really working

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.390 
all rusty and it wasn't really working
very<00:00:24.539> well<00:00:24.660> so<00:00:25.410> I<00:00:25.439> just<00:00:25.590> brought<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:26.039> bought

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
very well so I just brought the bought

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.759 
very well so I just brought the bought
the<00:00:26.550> cheapest<00:00:26.960> lowest<00:00:27.960> bottom<00:00:28.199> of<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:28.470> barrel

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
the cheapest lowest bottom of the barrel

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.370 
the cheapest lowest bottom of the barrel
hot<00:00:29.730> water<00:00:29.910> tank<00:00:30.240> and<00:00:30.480> this<00:00:30.900> happens<00:00:31.230> to<00:00:31.260> be<00:00:31.320> a

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
hot water tank and this happens to be a

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.720 
hot water tank and this happens to be a
hotpoint<00:00:31.830> and<00:00:33.170> what<00:00:34.170> i<00:00:34.200> did<00:00:34.469> was<00:00:34.680> i<00:00:34.920> plumbed<00:00:35.520> it

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
hotpoint and what i did was i plumbed it

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.940 
hotpoint and what i did was i plumbed it
into<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:37.079> hot<00:00:37.260> water<00:00:37.469> coil<00:00:37.910> and<00:00:38.910> this<00:00:39.149> was<00:00:39.390> a

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:39.950 
into the hot water coil and this was a

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.280 
into the hot water coil and this was a
fun<00:00:40.950> puzzle<00:00:41.129> to<00:00:41.399> put<00:00:41.430> together<00:00:42.020> but<00:00:43.020> it<00:00:43.110> works

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
fun puzzle to put together but it works

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.170 
fun puzzle to put together but it works
so<00:00:44.270> basically<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.680> wood<00:00:46.680> furnace<00:00:47.160> heats<00:00:48.000> up

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
so basically the wood furnace heats up

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.110 
so basically the wood furnace heats up
the<00:00:48.210> water<00:00:48.570> in<00:00:48.840> it<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:48.989> it<00:00:49.800> flows<00:00:50.070> up<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.910> top

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
the water in it and it flows up the top

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.990 
the water in it and it flows up the top
tube<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.809> hot<00:00:52.739> water<00:00:52.860> goes<00:00:53.160> up<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.789> top

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
tube and hot water goes up to the top

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.790 
tube and hot water goes up to the top
and<00:00:54.239> into<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.600> top<00:00:54.780> of<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:54.960> hot<00:00:55.050> water<00:00:55.379> tank

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
and into the top of the hot water tank

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.040 
and into the top of the hot water tank
and<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.730> cold<00:00:56.969> air<00:00:57.180> that's<00:00:57.420> replenished<00:00:57.960> by

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
and the cold air that's replenished by

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.369 
and the cold air that's replenished by
the<00:00:58.199> white<00:00:58.739> pex<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.309> be<00:00:59.460> see<00:00:59.640> their<00:01:00.079> float<00:01:01.079> goes

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
the white pex to be see their float goes

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.700 
the white pex to be see their float goes
right<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.739> bottom<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.809> goes<00:01:03.809> into<00:01:04.500> the

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
right to the bottom and goes into the

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.399 
right to the bottom and goes into the
furnace<00:01:04.979> again<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.990> so<00:01:06.990> that's<00:01:07.140> the

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
furnace again and so that's the

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.330 
furnace again and so that's the
convection<00:01:07.950> cycle<00:01:08.540> so<00:01:09.540> from<00:01:10.080> this<00:01:10.340> boiler

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
convection cycle so from this boiler

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.780 
convection cycle so from this boiler
tank<00:01:11.630> via<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:13.200> White<00:01:13.470> pecks<00:01:13.830> tube<00:01:14.159> again<00:01:14.430> on

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
tank via the White pecks tube again on

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.960 
tank via the White pecks tube again on
the<00:01:14.880> other<00:01:14.909> side<00:01:15.299> it<00:01:15.869> goes<00:01:16.140> to<00:01:16.439> my<00:01:16.549> regular<00:01:17.549> hot

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
the other side it goes to my regular hot

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:28.969 
the other side it goes to my regular hot
water<00:01:18.210> tank

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.480 

and<00:01:29.979> on<00:01:30.820> this<00:01:30.969> side<00:01:31.210> you'll<00:01:32.110> see<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:33.310> white

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
and on this side you'll see the white

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.520 
and on this side you'll see the white
peck<00:01:33.759> so<00:01:33.969> it's<00:01:34.090> coming<00:01:34.360> over<00:01:34.570> from<00:01:34.780> my<00:01:34.990> boiler

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
peck so it's coming over from my boiler

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.700 
peck so it's coming over from my boiler
tank<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:37.060> it's<00:01:37.210> three<00:01:37.420> quarter<00:01:37.689> inch<00:01:37.869> and<00:01:38.170> it

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
tank and it's three quarter inch and it

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.980 
tank and it's three quarter inch and it
goes<00:01:38.950> right<00:01:40.530> into<00:01:41.530> the<00:01:41.970> cold<00:01:42.970> water<00:01:43.119> intake<00:01:43.689> of

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
goes right into the cold water intake of

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.169 
goes right into the cold water intake of
my<00:01:44.490> oil<00:01:45.490> fired<00:01:45.899> regular<00:01:46.899> hot<00:01:47.170> water<00:01:47.409> tank<00:01:47.740> and

00:01:48.169 --> 00:01:48.179 
my oil fired regular hot water tank and

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:51.120 
my oil fired regular hot water tank and
then<00:01:49.179> from<00:01:49.569> there<00:01:49.929> that<00:01:50.229> feeds<00:01:50.500> of<00:01:50.710> course<00:01:50.950> the

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
then from there that feeds of course the

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.330 
then from there that feeds of course the
rest<00:01:51.280> house<00:01:51.549> so<00:01:52.450> effectively<00:01:52.960> what<00:01:53.469> I<00:01:53.530> have<00:01:53.799> is

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
rest house so effectively what I have is

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.730 
rest house so effectively what I have is
a<00:01:54.369> system<00:01:54.909> that<00:01:54.939> pre<00:01:55.869> eats<00:01:56.049> all<00:01:56.229> the<00:01:56.259> water<00:01:56.500> and

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
a system that pre eats all the water and

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.770 
a system that pre eats all the water and
it<00:01:56.890> does<00:01:57.039> quite<00:01:57.310> well<00:01:57.369> when<00:01:58.179> it's<00:01:58.329> cold<00:01:58.600> out

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
it does quite well when it's cold out

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.010 
it does quite well when it's cold out
and<00:01:58.810> then<00:01:59.080> the<00:01:59.289> furnaces<00:01:59.679> roaring<00:02:00.039> and<00:02:01.020> we

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
and then the furnaces roaring and we

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.529 
and then the furnaces roaring and we
only<00:02:02.560> spend<00:02:02.979> about<00:02:03.179> twenty<00:02:04.179> dollars<00:02:04.420> a<00:02:04.450> month

00:02:04.529 --> 00:02:04.539 
only spend about twenty dollars a month

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:07.109 
only spend about twenty dollars a month
on<00:02:04.929> heating<00:02:05.679> oil<00:02:05.860> and<00:02:06.159> so<00:02:06.340> that<00:02:06.459> includes<00:02:06.610> hot

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
on heating oil and so that includes hot

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:11.250 
on heating oil and so that includes hot
water<00:02:07.390> and<00:02:07.659> any<00:02:08.549> furnace<00:02:09.660> we<00:02:10.660> use<00:02:10.899> during<00:02:11.230> the

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
water and any furnace we use during the

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.330 
water and any furnace we use during the
middle<00:02:11.500> of<00:02:11.530> the<00:02:11.620> night<00:02:11.769> when<00:02:11.920> the<00:02:12.040> fire<00:02:12.190> goes

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
middle of the night when the fire goes

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.880 
middle of the night when the fire goes
up<00:02:12.750> so<00:02:13.750> that's<00:02:14.019> my<00:02:14.880> project
