barely lose any manner because when

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.880

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
you're in spider for him you don't lose

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.520 
you're in spider for him you don't lose
any<00:01:23.100> mana<00:01:23.280> so<00:01:23.759> it's<00:01:23.909> great<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.330> um<00:01:24.689> but<00:01:25.259> like

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
any mana so it's great and um but like

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.289 
any mana so it's great and um but like
something<00:01:25.830> bad<00:01:26.159> about<00:01:26.340> at<00:01:26.610> least<00:01:26.729> she<00:01:26.939> kind<00:01:27.240> of

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
something bad about at least she kind of

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.300 
something bad about at least she kind of
falls<00:01:27.540> off<00:01:27.750> a<00:01:27.780> little<00:01:28.080> bit<00:01:28.259> late<00:01:28.439> game<00:01:28.619> she<00:01:29.070> can

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
falls off a little bit late game she can

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.740 
falls off a little bit late game she can
dominate<00:01:29.700> because<00:01:30.030> she<00:01:30.270> has<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.479> lot<00:01:30.689> of

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
dominate because she has a lot of

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.140 
dominate because she has a lot of
sustained<00:01:31.140> in<00:01:31.290> lane<00:01:31.500> but<00:01:32.280> you<00:01:32.820> got<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.000> be

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
sustained in lane but you got to be

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.160 
sustained in lane but you got to be
careful<00:01:33.240> with<00:01:33.540> that<00:01:34.100> like<00:01:35.100> fewer<00:01:35.820> so<00:01:36.750> you<00:01:36.810> want

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
careful with that like fewer so you want

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.859 
careful with that like fewer so you want
to<00:01:37.229> dominate<00:01:37.380> early<00:01:37.829> game<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:38.420> she<00:01:39.420> can<00:01:39.659> get

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
to dominate early game and she can get

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:46.470 
to dominate early game and she can get
counter<00:01:40.259> decently<00:01:40.740> easy<00:01:41.009> so<00:01:41.780> yeah

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:46.480 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:47.820 

and<00:01:46.660> we're<00:01:47.170> going<00:01:47.200> to<00:01:47.350> be<00:01:47.440> heading<00:01:47.560> into

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:47.830 
and we're going to be heading into

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:55.290 
and we're going to be heading into
number<00:01:48.130> eight<00:01:48.310> in<00:01:48.520> a<00:01:48.670> second<00:01:48.940> here<00:01:53.190> and<00:01:54.300> it's

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.300 
number eight in a second here and it's

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.720 
number eight in a second here and it's
going<00:01:55.390> to<00:01:55.480> be<00:01:55.570> singed<00:01:55.930> singed<00:01:56.920> is<00:01:57.070> just<00:01:57.340> a<00:01:57.460> pain

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:57.730 
going to be singed singed is just a pain

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:59.490 
going to be singed singed is just a pain
and<00:01:57.940> then<00:01:58.030> that<00:01:58.180> key<00:01:58.420> will<00:01:58.570> not<00:01:58.600> die<00:01:59.020> he's<00:01:59.290> an

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390 
late-game just saying that even though I

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:00.820 
late-game just saying that even though I
really<00:03:59.510> like<00:03:59.870> the<00:04:00.020> champion<00:04:00.410> I<00:04:00.620> wouldn't

her<00:04:04.610> and<00:04:04.850> passed<00:04:05.540> but<00:04:06.410> if<00:04:06.800> you<00:04:06.950> can<00:04:07.100> dominate

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
her and passed but if you can dominate

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:09.190 
her and passed but if you can dominate
early<00:04:07.700> game<00:04:07.850> I<00:04:07.880> mean<00:04:08.210> if<00:04:08.390> she's<00:04:08.540> fed<00:04:08.780> she<00:04:09.050> can

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
early game I mean if she's fed she can

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.780 
early game I mean if she's fed she can
