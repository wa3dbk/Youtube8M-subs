 americanas to the angels also that 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:23.210
 they were reporting and we're going to start 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:26.720
 with this crown because on this occasion 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.880
 I have defined certain certain 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.800
 parts of the wheel but let's go little 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.630
 to little destroying it so that they go 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:36.259
 understanding 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:38.659
 let's put the image with the notes and 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:40.189
 let's check also remember that 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:41.960
 this track is in the tone of D major 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:44.360
 for the sax 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:48.470
 that followed a fa for the bass accordion 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:51.380
 sixth and we are going to break down this crown the 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:54.080
 good mustache we're going to move 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.490
 around here now with the image one side by 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.020
 there I have several indications right now 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.960
 we are also checking 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:03.340
 that rola is also completely red but 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:06.400
 has some accidents out there the sun 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:10.960
 and we are getting closer with the first line 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:12.700
 that would be what he says there 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.310
 in the parentheses by two is marked 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:18.220
 with blue the notes f sharp king and the 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.770
 we will not touch the times and we would go to 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.100
 second line and you would hear this 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.100
 way 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:32.810
 and I already played the screed and 2 would be like that 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:43.010
 and already there the third bing would follow 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.010
 long that would be this way 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:51.260
 and we have the annotation again 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:53.380
 touch the parenthesis and the fourth line 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.860
 finally not 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:58.990
 here what is marked as output what 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.490
 let's play at the end of this sentence and 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:03.190
 we repeat the four lines 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:05.069
 and it would be heard in this way we are going to 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.530
 touch new bad exit 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:09.290
 mother 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:14.080
 and it is repeated again that it would be heard 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.080
 everything as everything together 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:27.810
 one 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:27.810
 and almost everything is repeated 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:39.100
 in the second part we no longer do the 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.500
 exit we do where where it says the 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.020
 end of phrase I have marked with blue or 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:47.640
 where were the purple parentheses and 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:47.640
 blue that would be that way 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:57.220
 according to the ine 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:57.220
 and let's start again 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:04.140
 ok I'm going to play all this again 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.650
 how should you listen 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.650
 yes 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:16.920
 but no 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.920
 all right 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:25.780
 once 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:30.070
 but 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:37.090
 that would be the first part that carries the 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:40.210
 attention and it would be the output and what 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:41.740
 led the way and we'll see what 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.920
 should be the parentheses that says there 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:47.350
 by three marked with blue if I would touch 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:49.360
 this way to the four regions we're going 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:51.720
 to do it slowly and then I do it more 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.720
 slow 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:05:01.380
 Panama is not sold to our best 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:04.020
 people are not well 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:06.560
 there we have everything marked by two and what 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.560
 we repeat again 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:20.320
 it would be all that leads to the rola let's go 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:23.140
 to do it once slowly that part 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:26.040
 so that the check-in as is marked and 

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:26.040
 how it should be heard 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:37.930
 good 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:47.340
 good race out there we see you I hope them 

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:49.470
 Like it 's broken out of the mustache of 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:51.060

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:54.310
