00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.710
 and light up seedorf your tennis is this 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.180
 effect 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.510
 today I'm making a video for you 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:31.170
 so introduce you mc camera so that's 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:35.880
 a storex chd doubled five months 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:37.710
 ligaments foldit 9 of slope and that I 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.140
 would I do you a little tour of the 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:49.140
 box and explain a little what he 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:55.110
 are therefore at the edge and therefore have a 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:58.399
 choice against day so it's a little bit 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:01.530
 we can do so full hd 1080p 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:04.229
 preaching and poor watar covers so 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.600
 separated in the water of course with the 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.570
 little protection so the battery and 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.479
 takes 110 minutes where you will need a 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.250
 micro sd she is not sold with so 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.470
 we can install the application for 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:21.600
 look what we do as a girl but 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:24.110
 to make you film the camera so here 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:28.490
 that's the little icon of the application 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.490
 the application called is imagines 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:37.640
 so there are little things that made the 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:43.100
 ski inside the box 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:46.670
 so they less and less cuse wait for the 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:49.300
 light right except so that's for the 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.610
 helmet he's on my helmet 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:54.830
 so that's to go in the water 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:57.220
 it's to connect one to recharge 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.930
 your camera this is the remote control 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:03.920
 so saas as a guide to settle on 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:05.720
 a helmet that is to fix on the 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:10.369
 handlebar is this enough to fix a little 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:14.709
 close anywhere so we move everything from 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.709
 following the opening of their boots 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.269
 so we end up so we'll open the 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.370
 box 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:27.769
 so in fact is not paying attention to the 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.830
 box and justin pechie quintella etc 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:32.720
 so we have the content so I know 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:37.370
 already this third party has made a little while 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:39.940
 I have it on the camera but it 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:44.060
 for now he does not care 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:49.220
 there you have there will be a little 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:52.849
 scotch you take it off like that so 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:57.049
 in front of you have a little bag with here there 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:03:02.829
 will have the battery the wire in the battery 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:02.829
 she's in the camera that was delivering 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:33.470
 then the task that we as I 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:35.829
 said plasters since it's more 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.829
 green 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:50.680
 and after we have full and apart map 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:58.180
 with world series and in addition free 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:04:07.299
 and we'll go to the camera so I'm going 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:09.390
 take it off at a little break so 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:11.290
 I forgot forgive me as 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:13.980
 accessory also the little box 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.980
 to go to the top 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:19.510
 so I leave it on for their 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:22.500
 account and I looked at the camera otherwise 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:22.500
 go like this 

00:04:29.249 --> 00:04:34.679
 so there is a small digital screen 

00:04:32.209 --> 00:04:35.009
 so the battery as I told you 

00:04:34.679 --> 00:04:42.259
 see you later 

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:42.259
 as I laid a door so 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.900
 he does not want to hold 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:59.960
 so here I am going to show you so 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:05:04.169
 for the drums it's a little trick 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.740
 we want to lift just kill 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:08.310
 like that 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:11.240
 the new open the little paw and there 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:11.240
 you have the battery 

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:18.270
 so the battery that has a battery life 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:20.680
 110 minutes 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:24.610
 we are ten minutes that makes a 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:26.800
 fifty-fifty body if you know well 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:33.090
 attack or the small battery box 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:33.090
 as the battery sucks here 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:42.840
 but so here 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:54.360
 we go the mines the camera presses a 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:58.770
 dozen of sight I go the road 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.770
