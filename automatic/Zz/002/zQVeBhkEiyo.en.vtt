00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.210
 I bring a very nice craft with 

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:35.940
 a lot of color and with a very thematic 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.430
 pretty is also this mini comic album 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.440
 that is very very beautiful and this is very 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.210
 simple to make I'll leave you the 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.339
 mold of this mini album on facebook 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.620
 and below good I hope you like it and 

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:49.489
 if you want to know how it is done 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.489
 in the next tutorial 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:01:01.079
 for this craft we are going to need 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:04.470
 tail scissors decorative elements cardboard 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:07.920
 a small ring like this one molds 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.900
 comic and pictures to start I'm going to 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.920
 take the cardboard and the molds that I'm going 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.229
 to leave on my facebook 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.360
 I'll put up cardboard and 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:17.920
 I will highlight with a pen in this case 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.080
 we're just going to use the mold 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.700
 big me the little mold almost did not 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.100
 I will use but if you want to use it you can 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.710
 use it 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:29.610
 and we are going to cut a few templates 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.170
 of cardboard like these now what we 're going 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.180
 to do is take our paper 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.130
 decorative and we will form by both 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.590
 sides 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:40.049
 our cardboard if you can get this 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.409
 paper ball is much better for 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.909
 that we have a more comic style one 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.770
 Once we have already formed all of our 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.770
 cartons in this way 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.750
 what we are going to do is let's go to the 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.460
 rules one by one let's start with 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.049
 this what we are going to do is take a 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.110
 colored sheet if you have a sheet of 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:00.880
 strong color much better and what we're going 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.670
 to do is with our volleyball miss a 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.170
 way like this similar I in 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.390
 this case I will use the mold that 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.240
 I have 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.430
 of my little comic book and I realize 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.170
 that fits me perfectly so that you 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.940
 I'm going to leave this mold also below in 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.410
 the facebook carries what we are going to do 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.410
 is to mark with the pen 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:24.130
 and we are going to cut it and inside this 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.370
 same in this way that we are going to do 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:29.349
 let's introduce one of our photos 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.390
 the photo we want in the same way 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:34.840
 what we have done is let's cut 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:37.989
 the photo with a kind of points like 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:40.660
 in this case we are going to paste everything together 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:42.460
 and we're going to stick it to our cardboard 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.070
 it does not have to be this way in the 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:48.650
 Photo inside cut of the same style with 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:52.060
 little tips and we will put it inside 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.060
 of our cardboard 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.980
 in this way 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:01.500
 the same thing we will do with the others 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:03.490
 covers once we've put all 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.380
 our pictures 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:07.450
 you can also put colored sheets 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.520
 to put pictures or put phrases or 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.470
 text of how others want to go to 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:14.710
 choosing a number is that one of our 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:16.420
 cartons and you are going to cut some letters of 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:19.120
 the word that you want that is 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.430
 more suitable for your album I'm going to 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.650
 put the word love but you 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.690
 you can put the friendship or the word that 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:30.170
 you want depending for who 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:32.990
 be the mini album we are going to put like this 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.640
 and more or less with black letters and 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:36.530
 you can download it in typography 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.660
 and copy more or less this letter but 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.640
 well more or less it would be like that and we're going to 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:43.880
 hit good once we have 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:47.360
 our four cartons more or less already 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:49.490
 lined and adorned let's put them together 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:54.500
 the way we want 

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:56.720
 and we're going to drill one side in all and 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.310
 then let's put our ring and 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.430
 this way we will have already achieved 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:03.550
 our mini comic album as you can see 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.550
 here 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.800
 you can put all the photos and all the 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.900
 phrases and all the words that you 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.550
 and wish , and that is that your 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.480
 imagination like this would be finished on 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:15.220
 mini soul 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.230
 Well I hope you liked this 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:19.930
 mini album the truth that is very simple 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:21.370
 to do does not have much difficulty if you 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.200
 he liked you can give him a little finger 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.780
