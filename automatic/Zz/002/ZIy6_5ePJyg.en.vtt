00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
the same thing there might be a little

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000 
the same thing there might be a little
bit<00:02:33.180> more<00:02:33.299> attention<00:02:33.720> and<00:02:33.840> the<00:02:34.380> teams<00:02:34.620> might

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
bit more attention and the teams might

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.080 
bit more attention and the teams might
have<00:02:35.160> the<00:02:35.310> two<00:02:35.459> sides<00:02:35.670> of<00:02:35.730> the<00:02:35.820> garage

to work on our career we're gonna work

to work on our career we're gonna work
on<00:02:38.489> our<00:02:38.549> car<00:02:38.760> but<00:02:39.390> truly<00:02:39.959> a<00:02:40.140> here<00:02:40.380> this<00:02:40.560> is

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
on our car but truly a here this is

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.410 
on our car but truly a here this is
we're<00:02:40.890> all<00:02:40.980> involved<00:02:41.400> in<00:02:41.670> the<00:02:41.760> same<00:02:41.940> project

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
we're all involved in the same project

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.120 
we're all involved in the same project
and<00:02:42.600> we're<00:02:42.690> hoping<00:02:42.989> that<00:02:43.140> we<00:02:43.260> both<00:02:43.410> do<00:02:43.650> great<00:02:43.890> I

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
and we're hoping that we both do great I

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.180 
and we're hoping that we both do great I
believe<00:02:44.880> as<00:02:45.209> much<00:02:45.900> as<00:02:46.110> there's<00:02:46.320> two<00:02:46.650> separate

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
believe as much as there's two separate

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.160 
believe as much as there's two separate
efforts<00:02:47.510> only<00:02:48.510> because<00:02:48.930> they're<00:02:49.049> two

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
efforts only because they're two

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.510 
efforts only because they're two
separate<00:02:49.470> cars<00:02:50.000> campaigning<00:02:51.000> in<00:02:51.060> pikes<00:02:51.360> peak

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:52.520 
separate cars campaigning in pikes peak

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.360 
separate cars campaigning in pikes peak
I<00:02:52.580> have<00:02:53.480> the<00:02:53.630> feeling<00:02:53.840> and<00:02:54.200> the<00:02:54.260> way<00:02:54.800> both

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
I have the feeling and the way both

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.430 
I have the feeling and the way both
teams<00:02:55.400> have<00:02:55.880> been<00:02:56.000> working<00:02:56.420> together<00:02:57.020> it

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
teams have been working together it

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.320 
teams have been working together it
seems<00:02:57.650> like<00:02:57.830> it's<00:02:58.010> one<00:02:58.310> total<00:02:58.820> ever<00:02:58.970> in<00:02:59.210> a

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
seems like it's one total ever in a

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.660 
seems like it's one total ever in a
sense<00:02:59.570> you<00:02:59.720> know<00:02:59.750> Kenji<00:03:00.740> Brian<00:03:01.010> indication<00:03:01.610> or
