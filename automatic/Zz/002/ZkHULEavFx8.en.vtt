00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.649 
your games you can add manually games
but<00:01:49.200> it<00:01:49.380> doesn't<00:01:49.890> actually<00:01:50.040> like<00:01:50.820> you<00:01:51.450> could

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
but it doesn't actually like you could

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.510 
but it doesn't actually like you could
actually<00:01:52.259> just<00:01:52.619> put<00:01:52.799> up<00:01:52.920> like<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.280> soap

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
actually just put up like the soap

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.010 
actually just put up like the soap
browser<00:01:53.850> and<00:01:54.210> then<00:01:54.299> actually<00:01:54.600> make<00:01:54.689> it<00:01:54.869> work

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
browser and then actually make it work

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.819 
browser and then actually make it work
faster<00:01:55.549> but<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.939> quality<00:01:57.479> ain't<00:01:57.689> too<00:01:58.049> nice<00:01:58.380> so

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
faster but the quality ain't too nice so

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:03.109
