00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.330 
to the proper place in the iPhone plug
so<00:01:30.810> you<00:01:30.900> need<00:01:31.020> one<00:01:31.170> of<00:01:31.200> these<00:01:31.290> now<00:01:31.560> these<00:01:32.130> work

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
so you need one of these now these work

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.370 
so you need one of these now these work
brilliantly<00:01:32.810> any<00:01:33.810> problem<00:01:34.110> is<00:01:34.200> they

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
brilliantly any problem is they

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.560 
brilliantly any problem is they
introduce<00:01:34.829> another<00:01:35.220> point<00:01:35.670> a<00:01:35.850> possible<00:01:36.270> point

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
introduce another point a possible point

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.060 
introduce another point a possible point
of<00:01:36.630> failure<00:01:37.079> because<00:01:37.590> you're<00:01:37.799> you<00:01:37.950> know

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
of failure because you're you know

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.170 
of failure because you're you know
you've<00:01:38.220> got<00:01:38.369> another<00:01:38.520> plug<00:01:38.759> there<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.090> two

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
you've got another plug there and two

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.310 
you've got another plug there and two
other<00:01:39.329> connections<00:01:39.689> to<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:39.990> plugs<00:01:40.200> and

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
other connections to the plugs and

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.749 
other connections to the plugs and
another<00:01:40.590> point<00:01:40.740> that<00:01:40.829> it's<00:01:41.040> just<00:01:41.189> you<00:01:41.670> know

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
another point that it's just you know

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.130 
another point that it's just you know
and<00:01:41.909> you<00:01:41.970> have<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.180> remember<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.509> take<00:01:42.720> it<00:01:42.899> with

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
and you have to remember to take it with

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.170 
and you have to remember to take it with
you<00:01:43.259> but<00:01:43.409> anyway<00:01:43.770> now<00:01:43.920> rode<00:01:44.280> have<00:01:44.579> this<00:01:44.880> cable

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
you but anyway now rode have this cable

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.520 
you but anyway now rode have this cable
add<00:01:45.360> I'm<00:01:45.479> not<00:01:45.570> sure<00:01:45.689> exactly<00:01:45.930> when<00:01:46.290> it<00:01:46.409> was

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
add I'm not sure exactly when it was

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:47.870 
add I'm not sure exactly when it was
released<00:01:46.979> I<00:01:47.310> don't<00:01:47.460> remember<00:01:47.640> seeing<00:01:47.790> any

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
press releases about it or anything like

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.200 
press releases about it or anything like
that<00:01:49.500> it<00:01:49.710> just<00:01:49.740> sort<00:01:50.009> of<00:01:50.040> appeared<00:01:50.430> in<00:01:51.090> a

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
they come unplugged or wear out or you

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:16.930 
they come unplugged or wear out or you
know<00:02:15.470> fatigue<00:02:15.950> or<00:02:16.250> anything<00:02:16.430> like<00:02:16.580> that<00:02:16.640> so

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
know fatigue or anything like that so

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.640 
know fatigue or anything like that so
let<00:02:17.540> me<00:02:17.630> switch<00:02:17.810> out<00:02:17.960> the<00:02:18.020> cables<00:02:18.380> and<00:02:18.560> we'll

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
let me switch out the cables and we'll

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:19.870 
let me switch out the cables and we'll
see<00:02:18.770> if<00:02:18.830> there's<00:02:18.980> any<00:02:19.070> sound<00:02:19.340> difference<00:02:19.670> to

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
see if there's any sound difference to

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.150 
see if there's any sound difference to
when<00:02:20.060> I'm<00:02:20.150> using<00:02:20.300> the<00:02:20.620> adapter<00:02:21.620> all<00:02:21.830> right

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
when I'm using the adapter all right

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.310 
when I'm using the adapter all right
then<00:02:22.340> so<00:02:22.610> in<00:02:22.850> theory<00:02:23.300> it<00:02:23.600> should<00:02:23.630> make<00:02:23.990> any

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320 
then so in theory it should make any

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.410 
then so in theory it should make any
difference<00:02:25.100> to<00:02:25.190> the<00:02:25.460> quality<00:02:25.580> of<00:02:25.880> sound

difference to the quality of sound

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.120 
difference to the quality of sound
itself<00:02:26.690> but<00:02:26.840> I<00:02:26.900> have<00:02:27.140> found<00:02:27.350> I<00:02:27.530> do<00:02:27.590> have<00:02:27.830> a

Vasiliy know what I was saying before
the<00:03:17.450> difference<00:03:17.750> between<00:03:18.500> these<00:03:18.680> two<00:03:18.920> cables

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
the difference between these two cables

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:20.530 
the difference between these two cables
here<00:03:19.459> there<00:03:19.550> is<00:03:19.670> a<00:03:19.700> volume<00:03:20.090> difference

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
here there is a volume difference

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.240 
here there is a volume difference
between<00:03:20.840> these<00:03:21.050> two<00:03:21.320> one<00:03:21.560> has<00:03:21.800> slightly

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
between these two one has slightly

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.070 
between these two one has slightly
higher<00:03:22.580> resistance<00:03:23.030> and<00:03:23.269> it<00:03:23.330> makes<00:03:23.480> the<00:03:23.630> sound

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 
higher resistance and it makes the sound

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.140 
higher resistance and it makes the sound
something<00:03:24.560> quieter<00:03:25.010> than<00:03:25.130> the<00:03:25.250> other<00:03:25.370> I<00:03:25.850> think

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
something quieter than the other I think

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:27.640 
something quieter than the other I think
that<00:03:26.450> single<00:03:26.720> one<00:03:26.810> is<00:03:26.900> the<00:03:27.019> quieter<00:03:27.320> one<00:03:27.440> and

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
that single one is the quieter one and

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.800 
that single one is the quieter one and
the<00:03:28.100> double<00:03:28.610> one<00:03:28.760> is<00:03:28.910> slightly<00:03:29.120> louder<00:03:29.450> again

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
the double one is slightly louder again

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.420 
the double one is slightly louder again
so<00:03:30.140> it's<00:03:30.709> something<00:03:30.860> to<00:03:30.950> be<00:03:31.070> aware<00:03:31.130> of<00:03:31.250> when

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
so it's something to be aware of when

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:32.590 
so it's something to be aware of when
you're<00:03:31.519> buying<00:03:31.730> this<00:03:31.850> adapter<00:03:32.180> so<00:03:32.330> there<00:03:32.480> can

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:34.850 
be variation but this is this is just
