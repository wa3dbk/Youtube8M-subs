doesn't<00:02:20.070> look<00:02:20.160> too<00:02:20.280> great<00:02:20.370> when<00:02:20.460> you<00:02:20.610> look<00:02:20.760> at

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
doesn't look too great when you look at

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.390 
doesn't look too great when you look at
it<00:02:20.970> like<00:02:21.030> that<00:02:21.090> I<00:02:21.480> but<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:22.020> glow<00:02:22.350> is<00:02:22.380> nice<00:02:22.830> if

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
it like that I but the glow is nice if

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.710 
it like that I but the glow is nice if
you're<00:02:23.610> looking<00:02:23.700> at<00:02:23.910> it<00:02:24.090> if<00:02:24.240> you're<00:02:24.630> just

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
you're looking at it if you're just

can actually change the color of the
lights<00:02:31.910> and<00:02:32.910> they<00:02:33.660> could<00:02:33.810> flash<00:02:34.050> into<00:02:34.380> all

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
lights and they could flash into all

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.960 
lights and they could flash into all
fancy<00:02:34.950> things<00:02:36.200> now<00:02:37.200> back<00:02:37.800> over<00:02:38.070> to<00:02:38.580> the<00:02:38.730> right

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
fancy things now back over to the right

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
behind the monitors I have a few things

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.090 
behind the monitors I have a few things
here<00:02:49.980> so<00:02:50.340> I<00:02:50.580> have<00:02:51.239> the<00:02:51.690> monitor<00:02:52.050> stand<00:02:52.440> which<00:02:52.800> I

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
here so I have the monitor stand which I

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.000 
here so I have the monitor stand which I
used<00:02:53.760> to<00:02:53.970> have<00:02:54.180> well<00:02:55.050> i<00:02:55.080> started<00:02:55.410> out<00:02:55.620> having

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
used to have well i started out having

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.070 
used to have well i started out having
all<00:02:56.190> the<00:02:56.430> monitors<00:02:56.670> on<00:02:56.910> there<00:02:57.120> then<00:02:57.690> i<00:02:57.720> decided

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
all the monitors on there then i decided

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.600 
all the monitors on there then i decided
that<00:02:58.350> that<00:02:58.380> didn't<00:02:58.739> look<00:02:58.830> very<00:02:59.010> good<00:02:59.160> with<00:02:59.459> the

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
that that didn't look very good with the

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.500 
that that didn't look very good with the
four<00:02:59.940> monitor<00:03:00.750> combination<00:03:01.380> with<00:03:02.160> like<00:03:02.510> one

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
four monitor combination with like one

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.790 
four monitor combination with like one
two<00:03:03.810> three<00:03:04.290> four<00:03:04.590> so<00:03:05.430> then<00:03:05.580> I<00:03:06.170> removed<00:03:07.170> the<00:03:07.590> two

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
two three four so then I removed the two

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.190 
two three four so then I removed the two
on<00:03:07.980> the<00:03:08.010> sides<00:03:08.280> and<00:03:08.670> then<00:03:09.360> recently<00:03:09.600> I<00:03:09.840> decided

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
on the sides and then recently I decided

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.650 
on the sides and then recently I decided
to<00:03:10.709> actually<00:03:11.070> remove<00:03:11.310> the<00:03:11.610> bottom<00:03:11.940> one<00:03:12.090> let's

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
to actually remove the bottom one let's

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:13.820 
to actually remove the bottom one let's
that<00:03:12.780> I<00:03:12.810> could<00:03:12.989> tilt<00:03:13.230> it<00:03:13.380> up<00:03:13.470> a<00:03:13.560> little<00:03:13.680> bit

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
that I could tilt it up a little bit

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.710 
that I could tilt it up a little bit
more<00:03:13.950> it's<00:03:14.130> a<00:03:14.160> little<00:03:14.340> easier<00:03:14.400> to<00:03:14.670> see<00:03:14.910> and<00:03:15.090> a

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
more it's a little easier to see and a

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.410 
more it's a little easier to see and a
little<00:03:15.930> bit<00:03:16.019> better<00:03:16.170> angle<00:03:16.980> also<00:03:17.850> guess<00:03:18.180> i

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
little bit better angle also guess i

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.090 
little bit better angle also guess i
tilted<00:03:18.930> that<00:03:19.140> and<00:03:19.380> now<00:03:19.560> there's<00:03:19.709> only<00:03:19.830> the<00:03:20.070> one

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
tilted that and now there's only the one

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.850 
tilted that and now there's only the one
top<00:03:20.549> one<00:03:20.580> on<00:03:20.790> it<00:03:21.060> but<00:03:21.840> that<00:03:21.989> is<00:03:22.380> probably<00:03:22.590> the

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
top one on it but that is probably the

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.130 
top one on it but that is probably the
best<00:03:23.100> configuration<00:03:23.340> here<00:03:24.060> with<00:03:24.750> the<00:03:24.900> four

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
best configuration here with the four

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:30.259 
best configuration here with the four
monitors<00:03:26.120> and<00:03:27.120> then<00:03:28.489> behind<00:03:29.489> that<00:03:29.940> is<00:03:30.209> a

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
monitors and then behind that is a

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:31.910 
monitors and then behind that is a
belkin<00:03:30.989> power<00:03:31.140> strip<00:03:31.380> it's<00:03:31.530> kind<00:03:31.680> of<00:03:31.709> hard<00:03:31.890> to

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
belkin power strip it's kind of hard to

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.430 
belkin power strip it's kind of hard to
see<00:03:32.070> a<00:03:32.100> little<00:03:32.310> dark<00:03:32.519> back<00:03:32.730> there<00:03:33.110> now<00:03:34.110> there's

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
see a little dark back there now there's

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.380 
see a little dark back there now there's
also<00:03:34.590> a<00:03:34.769> sony<00:03:35.220> center<00:03:35.580> channel<00:03:35.730> speaker<00:03:35.850> and

two<00:03:37.320> hard<00:03:38.190> drives<00:03:38.340> again<00:03:39.299> little<00:03:39.810> hard<00:03:39.930> to<00:03:40.019> see

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
two hard drives again little hard to see

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.380
