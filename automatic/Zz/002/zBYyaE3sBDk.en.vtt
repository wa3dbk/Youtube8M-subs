so<00:00:10.849> this<00:00:11.030> is<00:00:11.120> my<00:00:11.269> ID<00:00:11.420> my<00:00:11.780> industrial<00:00:12.259> descender

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:13.719 
so this is my ID my industrial descender

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:16.089 
so this is my ID my industrial descender
very<00:00:14.719> safe<00:00:14.990> piece<00:00:15.230> of<00:00:15.410> kit<00:00:15.590> it's<00:00:15.740> got<00:00:15.889> a<00:00:15.920> few

00:00:16.089 --> 00:00:16.099 
very safe piece of kit it's got a few

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:21.220 
very safe piece of kit it's got a few
functions<00:00:16.640> on<00:00:16.849> it<00:00:17.140> to<00:00:19.660> look<00:00:20.660> after<00:00:20.869> you<00:00:21.110> when

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:21.230 
functions on it to look after you when

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.710 
functions on it to look after you when
you're<00:00:21.349> on<00:00:21.439> the<00:00:21.529> ropes<00:00:22.720> so<00:00:23.720> to<00:00:23.750> open<00:00:24.050> it<00:00:24.259> up

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:25.720 
you're on the ropes so to open it up

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.159 
you're on the ropes so to open it up
open<00:00:26.720> the<00:00:26.930> black<00:00:27.169> catch<00:00:27.790> unhook<00:00:28.790> the<00:00:29.719> swinging

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:30.169 
open the black catch unhook the swinging

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:33.549 
open the black catch unhook the swinging
front<00:00:30.710> plate<00:00:30.980> and<00:00:31.910> I<00:00:32.509> can<00:00:32.689> see<00:00:32.870> inside<00:00:33.020> so<00:00:33.440> it

00:00:33.549 --> 00:00:33.559 
front plate and I can see inside so it

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:36.580 
front plate and I can see inside so it
tells<00:00:33.770> us<00:00:34.040> I<00:00:34.309> can<00:00:35.120> use<00:00:35.300> a<00:00:35.329> rope<00:00:35.600> from<00:00:35.809> 10<00:00:36.170> mil<00:00:36.379> to

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:36.590 
tells us I can use a rope from 10 mil to

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.729 
tells us I can use a rope from 10 mil to
11<00:00:36.920> and<00:00:36.980> a<00:00:37.040> half<00:00:37.100> mil<00:00:37.870> and<00:00:38.870> then<00:00:39.079> we've<00:00:39.230> got<00:00:39.469> a

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:39.739 
11 and a half mil and then we've got a

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:42.010 
11 and a half mil and then we've got a
symbol<00:00:40.550> saying<00:00:40.820> the<00:00:40.940> top<00:00:41.149> end<00:00:41.360> the<00:00:41.510> attachment

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.020 
symbol saying the top end the attachment

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.229 
symbol saying the top end the attachment
end<00:00:42.170> of<00:00:42.260> the<00:00:42.320> Rope<00:00:42.499> the<00:00:43.399> hand<00:00:43.730> on<00:00:44.089> the<00:00:44.120> other

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
end of the Rope the hand on the other

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:46.389 
end of the Rope the hand on the other
end<00:00:44.539> so<00:00:45.260> the<00:00:45.379> correct<00:00:45.649> way<00:00:45.739> to<00:00:45.769> load<00:00:46.100> the<00:00:46.249> rope

00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:46.399 
end so the correct way to load the rope

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:49.090 
end so the correct way to load the rope
from<00:00:46.879> the<00:00:47.059> anchor<00:00:47.329> point<00:00:47.570> to<00:00:47.920> the<00:00:48.920> base

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
from the anchor point to the base

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.430 
from the anchor point to the base
nearest<00:00:49.609> me<00:00:49.789> and<00:00:50.059> then<00:00:50.179> the<00:00:50.300> loosened<00:00:50.780> comes

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
nearest me and then the loosened comes

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.899 
nearest me and then the loosened comes
out<00:00:51.649> of<00:00:51.769> the<00:00:51.829> top<00:00:52.100> like<00:00:52.699> so<00:00:54.550> so<00:00:55.550> when<00:00:55.699> there's

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:55.909 
out of the top like so so when there's

00:00:55.909 --> 00:00:58.959 
out of the top like so so when there's
weight<00:00:56.839> on<00:00:57.140> it<00:00:57.289> the<00:00:58.129> friction<00:00:58.550> around<00:00:58.670> the

00:00:58.959 --> 00:00:58.969 
weight on it the friction around the

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:02.889 
weight on it the friction around the
bottom<00:00:59.300> traps<00:01:00.190> rotates<00:01:01.190> the<00:01:01.370> cam<00:01:01.579> and<00:01:01.899> traps

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:02.899 
bottom traps rotates the cam and traps

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:05.410 
bottom traps rotates the cam and traps
the<00:01:03.050> rope<00:01:03.199> at<00:01:03.409> the<00:01:03.440> top<00:01:04.030> when<00:01:05.030> the<00:01:05.150> handle

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
the rope at the top when the handle

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.640 
the rope at the top when the handle
comes<00:01:05.690> down<00:01:07.300> it<00:01:08.300> progressively<00:01:08.990> opens<00:01:09.470> that

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.650 
comes down it progressively opens that

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:10.990 
comes down it progressively opens that
up<00:01:09.830> and<00:01:09.979> gives<00:01:10.159> me<00:01:10.310> a<00:01:10.340> nice<00:01:10.490> controlled

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
up and gives me a nice controlled

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.940 
up and gives me a nice controlled
descent<00:01:11.180> if<00:01:11.600> I<00:01:11.750> pull<00:01:11.930> too<00:01:11.960> hard<00:01:12.170> on<00:01:12.530> the<00:01:12.620> handle

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
descent if I pull too hard on the handle

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.330 
descent if I pull too hard on the handle
it<00:01:13.580> disengages<00:01:14.710> but<00:01:15.710> take<00:01:15.890> the<00:01:15.979> handle<00:01:16.250> the

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
it disengages but take the handle the

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.010 
it disengages but take the handle the
other<00:01:16.460> way<00:01:16.700> you<00:01:17.030> can<00:01:17.180> see<00:01:17.420> it<00:01:17.509> actually<00:01:17.810> locks

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
other way you can see it actually locks

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:25.350 
other way you can see it actually locks
the<00:01:18.290> device<00:01:18.560> off<00:01:18.860> it<00:01:19.040> closes<00:01:19.490> that<00:01:19.640> gap<00:01:19.820> there

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.660 

the<00:01:26.110> other<00:01:26.260> safety<00:01:26.500> feature<00:01:26.830> of<00:01:26.980> the<00:01:27.040> ID<00:01:27.220> if<00:01:27.520> I

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
the other safety feature of the ID if I

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.240 
the other safety feature of the ID if I
manage<00:01:27.790> to<00:01:27.940> wrote<00:01:28.330> load<00:01:29.080> the<00:01:29.530> rope<00:01:29.770> in<00:01:30.010> the

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
manage to wrote load the rope in the

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.480 
manage to wrote load the rope in the
wrong<00:01:30.460> direction<00:01:30.870> like<00:01:31.870> that<00:01:32.190> when<00:01:33.190> I<00:01:33.220> pull

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
wrong direction like that when I pull

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.040 
wrong direction like that when I pull
the<00:01:33.610> rope<00:01:33.790> down<00:01:33.970> to<00:01:34.150> control<00:01:34.630> it

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.050 
the rope down to control it

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.580 
the rope down to control it
it<00:01:35.200> connects<00:01:36.100> on<00:01:36.280> these<00:01:36.430> teeth<00:01:36.760> here<00:01:37.030> and<00:01:37.900> that

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
it connects on these teeth here and that

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.130 
it connects on these teeth here and that
will<00:01:38.650> actually<00:01:39.100> lock<00:01:39.880> the<00:01:40.330> device<00:01:40.450> up<00:01:40.960> and

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
will actually lock the device up and

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:50.340 
will actually lock the device up and
prevent<00:01:41.650> me<00:01:41.800> from<00:01:41.830> descending<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.960> latest

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
prevent me from descending the latest

prevent me from descending the latest
IDs<00:01:51.070> have<00:01:51.280> got<00:01:51.490> another<00:01:52.030> feature<00:01:52.330> which<00:01:52.570> is

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
IDs have got another feature which is

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.180 
IDs have got another feature which is
this<00:01:52.870> button<00:01:53.170> on<00:01:53.350> the<00:01:53.440> end<00:01:53.560> of<00:01:53.650> the<00:01:53.710> handle<00:01:54.010> and

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.330 
this button on the end of the handle and
that's<00:01:54.760> just<00:01:55.060> for<00:01:55.210> when<00:01:55.330> I'm<00:01:55.710> not<00:01:56.710> got<00:01:56.890> my<00:01:57.040> full

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
that's just for when I'm not got my full

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.560 
that's just for when I'm not got my full
weight<00:01:57.370> on<00:01:57.970> the<00:01:58.360> device<00:01:58.690> it<00:01:59.650> just<00:01:59.680> aids
