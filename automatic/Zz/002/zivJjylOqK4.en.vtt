00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.270
 was to put together a table in there pulled 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.950
 your debut from simple, boring, boring face 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.980
 too talk about the first tournament 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.170
 female 50 complicated 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.470
 the chef part was good for the experience 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.570
 and how did he play flag and 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:21.420
 develop yourself and talk a little bit about 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.740
 a sense of looking with these cases at 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:29.179
 bored on the scale are read net po 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:31.920
 funny two years ago they still are 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:32.719
 bigger idols so I already told you this 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.680
 cool 

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:46.170
 the technician changed so much just took all stec 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:48.690
 but I noticed at least that you 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.149
 he was very calm because the young guy 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:55.620
 22 years old is the first tournament as soon as 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:58.800
 5k 8 max tournament with all the irons 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.780
 of the world poker there on the tables and I saw 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.140
 which was super quiet if you were 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.700
 playing well if pp has secrets there I 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.070
 I 'm not really 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.040
 It was a special day, I do not think 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.720
 secret has some rather non whispers 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.360
 some things they help with 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.670
 sure I've been working this out 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.210
 before you start before you start 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.869
 series to the three months I 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:27.299
 doing yoga everything else that helps 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:29.720
 much in this part of nervousness and 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.720
 anxiety 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.000
 I also think it's a bit of 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.710
 experience is time like the type you 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.979
 think they make four throws of the game 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:45.240
 professionally but - and played several 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:46.409
 tournaments carlos already then was type today 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.350
 I do not feel that pressure anymore 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.479
 of Bahia itself online store is a bit 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.829
 different in the beginning when hundreds more 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.229
 When I saw the guys, it's cold in the belly. 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.969
 it is obvious that it is different from what is 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.649
 accustomed to something that heard the 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.259
 same guys the same day online would not 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.640
 to be so worried that I'm accustomed to 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.590
 golden time issue 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.409
 things have been know that the staff of the 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.490
 hotel something of the type then in that 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.970
 point got a little nervous at first 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:15.360
 but after the first hour goes by 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:18.090
 be once there to stay there what he should 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.100
 stayed there for 56 hours with the guys 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.690
 Can you learn something to fish? 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.280
 some of their behavior on the 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.680
 month something is what it is 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.900
 different is true they behave like 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.800
 if it was any either ne 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:34.430
 they behave like they do not tell if it's expensive 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:37.739
 I knew how to talk about bracelet beth . 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.060
 home could speak to this contract is 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:41.519
 playing like a tournament 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:45.390
 any so israel 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:47.190
 I think this idea is not to create so much 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:51.570
 expectation over a tournament ever 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:55.500
 had nervous time almost something that 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:58.200
 It's only worse for you then too. 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.280
 It's that they do not need it so much, do not they? 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.650
 are accustomed to these neighborhoods 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.940
 I need something more quiet, too. 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.000
 for you 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:08.310
 the result in the heads up sorry to have 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.269
 some influence on your trust you 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:14.250
 is yes but safer your game a 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:15.299
 business that have so much to influence 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.160
 arrive in the series 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:19.170
 I think this whole year was very good. 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.709
 to arrive in the series however that this 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:26.040
 experience up to and in the 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:27.870
 comfort that this year also bringing the 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.730
 kind of punk rock but with 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.829
 sure helps when judging because 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.260
 if I do not have to talk, it was 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:37.680
 spectacular for me a lot happened 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:39.030
 thing online and this certainly gave me 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.920
 another thing that helped me a lot 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.739
 more tranquility here in the series with 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:46.410
 sure you came from the beginning I 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:47.480
 I imagine you will play many 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.940
 events still ours 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.340
 there I think that trust now only 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:54.890
 increases already removed the target boost 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.599
 that weight of the premiere and now I think 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:59.420
 tomorrow will have to accept more relaxed in 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:04:02.390
 table is a car with and between tomorrow and 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:05.120
 business is but one of the achievements 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:06.980
 should ever accept a little more awards 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.959
 houses to prepare the morning after 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:11.750
 I played so I put what I did 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:14.450
 play a wreck 13 000 chips will be for 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:17.600
 Let me tell you, sit down, Brazil. 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:20.690
 gigantic in this, it certainly was not 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.520
 much easier is cool is always with 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.740
 A good luck, I hope to make several 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.389
 interviews with you and take care and told me 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:30.910
 For me, I'm sure I was. 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:30.910
 after all beauty looks thanks for touch
