00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
it just like I would a normal hard drive

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.870 
it just like I would a normal hard drive
this<00:01:12.840> could<00:01:13.020> take<00:01:13.170> some<00:01:13.229> time<00:01:13.470> a<00:01:13.979> DVD<00:01:14.280> can<00:01:14.700> hold

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
this could take some time a DVD can hold

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.840 
this could take some time a DVD can hold
a<00:01:15.030> lot<00:01:15.299> of<00:01:15.360> data<00:01:15.710> so<00:01:16.710> formatting<00:01:17.369> that<00:01:17.400> space

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
a lot of data so formatting that space

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.130 
a lot of data so formatting that space
may<00:01:18.659> take<00:01:18.869> a<00:01:18.900> little<00:01:19.140> bit<00:01:19.229> of<00:01:19.320> time<00:01:19.560> but<00:01:21.140> it's

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
may take a little bit of time but it's

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.160 
may take a little bit of time but it's
actually<00:01:22.290> done<00:01:23.689> it<00:01:24.689> was<00:01:24.810> actually<00:01:25.110> pretty

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
actually done it was actually pretty

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.890
