00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.200
 as a pace, I start with a bright one 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.330
 eyeshadow color 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.490
 so that my eyes shine for it 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:21.500
 i'm the seventh six the brushes and 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.500
 blinds the color on my song 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.349
 my lidstick I take mine 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:35.649
 favorite opponent of mac in black jack 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:37.210
 and pull the sexy brush of sigma now 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:39.399
 I stuck my song a bit 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.530

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:43.390
 to work my eyelashes wreath I 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.360
 Even the brush in the middle of one 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.800
 song and draw me a little 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.610
 I stroke and work too hard 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.610

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.689
 the whole thing together 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.280
 after that I only correct mine 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.280
 eyeliner 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:42.690
 An elegant finish to the look 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.400
 I give myself the eyeliner directly 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.150
 under my eyelashes in which I mean 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.150
 leave your eyes open 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:09.050
 it continues with my liquid 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.970
 each other from l'orÃ©al in cables black 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.370

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.769
 song tight but catch at the beginning of my 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.269

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:20.050

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:20.050
 build up 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.040
 Now I create mine here too 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.610
 desired wing and connect now 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.610
 everything together 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.850
 born 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.680

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:29.020
 Extra long eyelashes of my mascara 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.820
 maybelline if their mascara applying 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:32.830
 then close your eyes and use 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.690
 the pressure against the best known and 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:42.520
 makes rotating movements for still 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:44.200
 fuller and longer eyelashes 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.000
 Neat lidstrich not only looks 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.460
