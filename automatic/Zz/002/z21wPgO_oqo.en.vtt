 It starts in the universe but it is also here 

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:19.060
 It's a deck I was thinking of using it for a while 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:22.570

00:00:53.660 --> 00:01:02.770
 Let alone go home instead of the other sound flcl 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:10.090

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:11.300
 First of all the first round I do one kill No. is it yes etc. after the city east you come to say that is spawning the road surface space-time transfer 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:17.150

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:19.650
 Third round of the axis transfer intends this I'm fine I crown 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:23.659
 8 roles as well but it is and the shaft 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:26.719
 It is really an attacking guy who is quite active 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:28.820
 It is recommended that it is it Supagu 

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:31.850

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.830

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:42.230
 It is power 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:45.950
 I guess there are 10,000 rivers at random 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:51.590
 If also form 2000 Tsuitere parts 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:57.250
 It is good that 15000 with high probability in the 2nd round is well overcoming 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:57.250
 Since I will escort the wall with my chosen eyes 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:05.990

 Why round 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:16.190

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:25.739

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.400
 It feels like it is yeah 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:24.190
