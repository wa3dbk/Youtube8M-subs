little<00:00:50.640> bit<00:00:50.850> of<00:00:50.940> kit<00:00:51.090> on<00:00:51.210> here<00:00:51.390> it's<00:00:51.570> a<00:00:51.660> leather

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
little bit of kit on here it's a leather

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.680 
little bit of kit on here it's a leather
jacket<00:00:51.960> with<00:00:52.739> a<00:00:52.770> waterproof<00:00:53.100> liner<00:00:53.550> so<00:00:54.300> when

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
jacket with a waterproof liner so when

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.600 
jacket with a waterproof liner so when
you<00:00:54.870> wearing<00:00:55.289> leather<00:00:55.469> gear<00:00:55.770> you<00:00:56.010> want<00:00:56.250> it<00:00:56.489> as

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
you wearing leather gear you want it as

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.670 
you wearing leather gear you want it as
safe<00:00:56.879> as<00:00:57.030> possible<00:00:57.210> that's<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.719> theory<00:00:57.930> so

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
safe as possible that's the theory so

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.139 
safe as possible that's the theory so
what<00:00:58.800> they've<00:00:58.920> done<00:00:58.949> on<00:00:59.219> this<00:00:59.430> with<00:00:59.910> their

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
what they've done on this with their

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.569 
what they've done on this with their
engineered<00:01:00.870> skin<00:01:01.260> principle<00:01:01.859> is<00:01:02.039> they've

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
engineered skin principle is they've

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.170 
engineered skin principle is they've
redirected<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.570> stitching<00:01:04.760> away<00:01:05.760> from

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
redirected the stitching away from

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.000 
redirected the stitching away from
vulnerable<00:01:06.780> areas<00:01:07.170> soft<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.650> explain

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
vulnerable areas soft to explain

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.280 
vulnerable areas soft to explain

normally on a sleeve if you check your
own<00:01:10.470> jackets<00:01:10.890> at<00:01:11.040> home<00:01:11.250> you'll<00:01:11.520> see<00:01:11.700> that<00:01:11.880> you

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
own jackets at home you'll see that you

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.670 
own jackets at home you'll see that you
have<00:01:12.030> a<00:01:12.090> stitch<00:01:12.510> all<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.840> way<00:01:13.200> down<00:01:13.500> the

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
have a stitch all the way down the

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.190 
have a stitch all the way down the
sleeve<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.130> down<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.850> elbow<00:01:15.000> down<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:16.080> the

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
sleeve and down the elbow down to the

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.920 
sleeve and down the elbow down to the
cuff<00:01:16.409> in<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:17.490> very<00:01:17.700> vulnerable<00:01:17.880> place<00:01:18.420> you<00:01:18.689> fall

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
cuff in a very vulnerable place you fall

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.109 
cuff in a very vulnerable place you fall
off<00:01:19.110> your<00:01:19.290> bike<00:01:19.439> that<00:01:19.920> bit<00:01:20.220> is<00:01:20.400> likely<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:21.000> go

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
off your bike that bit is likely to go

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.179 
off your bike that bit is likely to go
down<00:01:21.299> first<00:01:21.600> so<00:01:22.200> what<00:01:22.350> Revit<00:01:22.650> have<00:01:22.770> done<00:01:23.009> is

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
down first so what Revit have done is

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.160 
down first so what Revit have done is
positioned<00:01:24.090> it<00:01:24.270> in<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.720> different<00:01:25.080> position

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
positioned it in a different position

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.990 
positioned it in a different position
they've<00:01:25.950> stitched<00:01:26.340> it<00:01:26.430> all<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.640> way<00:01:26.729> up<00:01:26.850> this

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
they've stitched it all the way up this

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.020 
they've stitched it all the way up this
point<00:01:27.330> here<00:01:27.600> around<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.560> top<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:28.979> round<00:01:29.759> the

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
point here around the top and round the

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.929 
point here around the top and round the
bottom<00:01:30.390> underneath<00:01:30.810> so<00:01:31.530> this<00:01:31.799> area<00:01:32.100> is<00:01:32.490> one

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
bottom underneath so this area is one

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.240 
bottom underneath so this area is one
piece<00:01:33.180> of<00:01:33.329> leather<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:33.689> that<00:01:34.590> means<00:01:34.950> then

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
piece of leather and that means then

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.789 
piece of leather and that means then
it's<00:01:35.430> just<00:01:35.670> that<00:01:35.909> little<00:01:36.270> bit<00:01:36.659> safer<00:01:37.049> god

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
it's just that little bit safer god

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.830 
it's just that little bit safer god

in again but not only is it waterproof
it's<00:03:02.970> windproof<00:03:03.659> as<00:03:04.019> well<00:03:04.260> but<00:03:04.859> it<00:03:04.980> breathes

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
it's windproof as well but it breathes

so you it's nice and light to wear the

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:10.670 
so you it's nice and light to wear the
idea<00:03:08.879> of<00:03:09.060> the<00:03:09.209> breathability<00:03:09.629> and<00:03:10.109> the<00:03:10.439> wind

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
idea of the breathability and the wind

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.429 
idea of the breathability and the wind
proof<00:03:10.950> actor<00:03:11.430> is<00:03:11.579> for<00:03:11.909> example<00:03:12.359> if<00:03:12.510> it's<00:03:12.840> a

00:03:13.429 --> 00:03:13.439 
proof actor is for example if it's a

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:16.580 
proof actor is for example if it's a
chilly<00:03:13.829> day<00:03:13.920> this<00:03:14.730> front<00:03:15.000> piece<00:03:15.239> is<00:03:15.510> mesh<00:03:15.810> so

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
chilly day this front piece is mesh so

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.800 
chilly day this front piece is mesh so
that<00:03:16.620> lets<00:03:16.980> the<00:03:17.159> air<00:03:17.189> flow<00:03:17.579> in<00:03:17.760> by<00:03:18.419> putting

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
that lets the air flow in by putting

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.199 
that lets the air flow in by putting
that<00:03:18.930> liner<00:03:19.199> behind<00:03:19.739> it<00:03:19.980> stops<00:03:20.639> the<00:03:20.819> air<00:03:20.970> the

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
that liner behind it stops the air the

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.210 
that liner behind it stops the air the
cold<00:03:21.449> air<00:03:21.660> getting<00:03:21.930> it<00:03:22.139> in<00:03:22.530> see<00:03:22.769> scanning

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
cold air getting it in see scanning

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.430 
cold air getting it in see scanning
systems<00:03:23.579> it<00:03:23.849> makes<00:03:24.120> you<00:03:24.209> kill<00:03:24.389> it<00:03:24.510> so<00:03:24.959> that's

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
systems it makes you kill it so that's

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.680 
systems it makes you kill it so that's
quite<00:03:25.769> unique<00:03:25.799> quite<00:03:26.519> functional<00:03:27.150> so<00:03:27.480> because

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
quite unique quite functional so because

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.149 
quite unique quite functional so because
you<00:03:27.840> can<00:03:27.989> use<00:03:28.199> it<00:03:28.230> in<00:03:28.440> the<00:03:28.560> winter<00:03:28.829> you<00:03:28.859> can<00:03:28.980> use

00:03:29.149 --> 00:03:29.159 
you can use it in the winter you can use

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:30.229 
you can use it in the winter you can use
it<00:03:29.190> in<00:03:29.370> the<00:03:29.430> summer<00:03:29.609> all<00:03:29.849> year<00:03:29.909> round

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
it in the summer all year round

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.300 
it in the summer all year round
basically<00:03:30.930> there's<00:03:31.349> pants<00:03:31.739> to<00:03:31.859> go<00:03:32.010> with<00:03:32.040> that

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
basically there's pants to go with that

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.369 
basically there's pants to go with that
and<00:03:32.549> something<00:03:33.239> Revok<00:03:33.690> do<00:03:33.870> which<00:03:34.049> is<00:03:34.079> quite

00:03:34.369 --> 00:03:34.379 
and something Revok do which is quite
