00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.280 
in here of course you know you can see

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.480 
in here of course you know you can see
everything<00:00:36.910> is<00:00:37.030> carbon<00:00:37.420> fiber<00:00:38.340> some<00:00:39.340> of<00:00:39.430> the

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:39.490 
everything is carbon fiber some of the

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:40.680 
everything is carbon fiber some of the
first<00:00:39.700> things<00:00:39.880> you<00:00:40.000> notice<00:00:40.120> of<00:00:40.450> course<00:00:40.630> you

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:40.690 
first things you notice of course you

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.140 
first things you notice of course you
got<00:00:40.810> like<00:00:40.990> a<00:00:41.020> Racing<00:00:41.470> foot<00:00:41.710> box<00:00:41.980> the<00:00:42.730> steering

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:43.150 
got like a Racing foot box the steering

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.740 
got like a Racing foot box the steering
column

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:43.750 
column

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.720 
column
you've<00:00:44.470> got<00:00:44.650> the<00:00:44.770> shifter<00:00:45.160> right<00:00:45.310> here<00:00:45.580> so

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:45.730 
you've got the shifter right here so

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:47.220 
you've got the shifter right here so
this<00:00:45.850> is<00:00:46.030> actually<00:00:46.360> how<00:00:46.480> you<00:00:46.540> grab<00:00:46.870> gears

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:47.230 
this is actually how you grab gears

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.310 
this is actually how you grab gears
that's<00:00:48.220> first<00:00:48.520> gear<00:00:48.630> second<00:00:49.630> gear<00:00:49.660> and<00:00:49.840> so<00:00:50.140> on

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:50.320 
that's first gear second gear and so on

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.840 
that's first gear second gear and so on
and<00:00:50.770> then<00:00:50.920> you<00:00:50.950> go<00:00:51.070> down<00:00:51.250> like<00:00:51.280> that<00:00:51.670> it's

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:51.850 
and then you go down like that it's

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:52.920 
and then you go down like that it's
pretty<00:00:52.000> awesome<00:00:52.210> you<00:00:52.420> can<00:00:52.540> actually<00:00:52.690> keep

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:52.930 
pretty awesome you can actually keep

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.770 
pretty awesome you can actually keep
your<00:00:53.110> foot<00:00:53.290> full<00:00:53.530> throttle<00:00:54.100> and<00:00:54.540> grab<00:00:55.540> the

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
your foot full throttle and grab the

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.980 
your foot full throttle and grab the
gear<00:00:56.020> and<00:00:56.320> it<00:00:57.310> is<00:00:57.640> uh<00:00:57.670> it<00:00:58.450> doesn't<00:00:58.810> have<00:00:58.900> an

00:00:58.980 --> 00:00:58.990 
gear and it is uh it doesn't have an

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:00.479 
gear and it is uh it doesn't have an
electronic<00:00:59.470> shifting<00:00:59.620> or<00:00:59.920> anything<00:01:00.070> but<00:01:00.370> it

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 
electronic shifting or anything but it

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:02.580 
electronic shifting or anything but it
will<00:01:00.579> misfire<00:01:01.180> a<00:01:01.210> couple<00:01:01.810> cylinders<00:01:02.020> as<00:01:02.440> soon

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:02.590 
will misfire a couple cylinders as soon

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:04.170 
will misfire a couple cylinders as soon
as<00:01:02.680> you<00:01:02.770> pull<00:01:02.950> on<00:01:03.070> this<00:01:03.190> and<00:01:03.700> so<00:01:03.820> it<00:01:03.910> drops

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.180 
as you pull on this and so it drops

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.809 
as you pull on this and so it drops
right<00:01:04.420> into<00:01:04.600> the<00:01:04.689> next<00:01:04.900> gear<00:01:05.110> it's<00:01:05.259> so<00:01:05.439> awesome

00:01:05.809 --> 00:01:05.819 
right into the next gear it's so awesome

00:01:05.819 --> 00:01:08.279 
right into the next gear it's so awesome
this<00:01:06.819> is<00:01:06.880> the<00:01:07.149> hand<00:01:07.359> brake<00:01:07.539> so<00:01:07.780> what<00:01:07.960> this<00:01:08.109> does

00:01:08.279 --> 00:01:08.289 
this is the hand brake so what this does

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:11.010 
this is the hand brake so what this does
is<00:01:08.499> it<00:01:09.159> opens<00:01:09.670> up<00:01:09.850> the<00:01:09.999> center<00:01:10.299> diff<00:01:10.509> allows

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
is it opens up the center diff allows

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.899 
is it opens up the center diff allows
the<00:01:11.259> back<00:01:11.439> tires<00:01:11.740> to<00:01:12.009> lock<00:01:12.189> up<00:01:12.429> so<00:01:12.729> that<00:01:12.819> when

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:12.909 
the back tires to lock up so that when

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:14.249 
the back tires to lock up so that when
you<00:01:12.999> go<00:01:13.090> in<00:01:13.179> a<00:01:13.240> sharp<00:01:13.509> corner<00:01:13.689> you<00:01:13.960> can<00:01:14.109> turn

00:01:14.249 --> 00:01:14.259 
you go in a sharp corner you can turn

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:16.169 
you go in a sharp corner you can turn
pull<00:01:14.920> that<00:01:15.039> just<00:01:15.310> a<00:01:15.399> little<00:01:15.520> bit<00:01:15.670> and<00:01:15.880> the<00:01:15.999> car

00:01:16.169 --> 00:01:16.179 
pull that just a little bit and the car

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:17.730 
pull that just a little bit and the car
rotates<00:01:16.600> and<00:01:16.840> then<00:01:16.929> boom<00:01:17.170> you're<00:01:17.409> right<00:01:17.560> back

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
rotates and then boom you're right back

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.489 
rotates and then boom you're right back
on<00:01:17.889> the<00:01:18.009> gas<00:01:18.130> now<00:01:18.999> this<00:01:19.179> is<00:01:19.359> a<00:01:19.389> all-wheel<00:01:20.170> drive

00:01:20.489 --> 00:01:20.499 
on the gas now this is a all-wheel drive

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:22.709 
on the gas now this is a all-wheel drive
car<00:01:20.799> it's<00:01:21.310> not<00:01:21.579> the<00:01:21.850> front<00:01:22.149> to<00:01:22.329> rear<00:01:22.539> wheel

00:01:22.709 --> 00:01:22.719 
car it's not the front to rear wheel

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:24.660 
car it's not the front to rear wheel
drive<00:01:22.960> all<00:01:23.259> four<00:01:23.560> tires<00:01:23.920> are<00:01:24.130> doing<00:01:24.340> their<00:01:24.460> job

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
drive all four tires are doing their job

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.569 
drive all four tires are doing their job
which<00:01:24.850> helps<00:01:25.119> it<00:01:25.270> accelerate<00:01:26.579> especially

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:27.579 
which helps it accelerate especially

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:29.940 
which helps it accelerate especially
from<00:01:27.729> a<00:01:27.819> standstill<00:01:28.179> in<00:01:28.509> about<00:01:28.990> a<00:01:29.020> two-second

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
from a standstill in about a two-second

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.859 
from a standstill in about a two-second
zero<00:01:30.369> to<00:01:30.490> sixty<00:01:30.880> it's<00:01:31.149> actually<00:01:31.420> two<00:01:31.600> point

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869 
zero to sixty it's actually two point

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:34.590 
zero to sixty it's actually two point
two<00:01:32.020> seconds<00:01:32.439> it's<00:01:32.530> insane<00:01:33.249> the<00:01:33.600> acceleration

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
two seconds it's insane the acceleration

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:35.730 
two seconds it's insane the acceleration
off<00:01:34.719> the<00:01:34.840> line<00:01:35.020> is<00:01:35.200> just<00:01:35.350> awesome

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
off the line is just awesome

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.459 
off the line is just awesome
so<00:01:35.920> the<00:01:36.069> switches<00:01:36.490> we've<00:01:36.729> got<00:01:37.170> this<00:01:38.170> is<00:01:38.350> the

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:38.469 
so the switches we've got this is the

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:40.770 
so the switches we've got this is the
main<00:01:38.649> switch<00:01:38.979> as<00:01:39.609> you<00:01:39.789> can<00:01:39.909> see<00:01:40.090> that

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
main switch as you can see that

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.480 
main switch as you can see that
basically<00:01:41.049> turns<00:01:41.530> the<00:01:41.770> power<00:01:41.920> on<00:01:42.100> for

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
basically turns the power on for

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.230 
basically turns the power on for
everything<00:01:42.729> then<00:01:43.719> you've<00:01:43.840> got<00:01:43.959> the<00:01:44.079> ignition

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
everything then you've got the ignition

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.239 
everything then you've got the ignition
and<00:01:46.240> once<00:01:46.569> the<00:01:46.719> ignition<00:01:47.079> is<00:01:47.229> on<00:01:47.380> then<00:01:47.979> you<00:01:48.100> can

00:01:48.239 --> 00:01:48.249 
and once the ignition is on then you can

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:49.480 
and once the ignition is on then you can
start<00:01:48.609> it<00:01:48.759> up

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
start it up

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.880 
start it up
you<00:01:49.549> can<00:01:49.670> see<00:01:49.880> the<00:01:50.090> gear<00:01:50.600> that<00:01:50.840> I'm<00:01:50.960> in<00:01:51.200> and<00:01:51.409> now

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
you can see the gear that I'm in and now

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.910 
you can see the gear that I'm in and now
it's<00:01:52.070> a<00:01:52.189> number<00:01:52.700> two<00:01:52.909> I<00:01:53.149> can<00:01:54.049> go<00:01:54.200> back<00:01:54.409> down<00:01:54.439> to

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
it's a number two I can go back down to

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.789 
it's a number two I can go back down to
first<00:01:55.189> and<00:01:55.790> there's<00:01:55.939> neutral<00:01:56.560> then<00:01:57.560> you<00:01:57.649> have

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
first and there's neutral then you have

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:01.510

some<00:01:58.369> fans<00:01:59.270> this<00:01:59.659> ALS<00:02:00.470> is<00:02:00.740> actually<00:02:01.189> a<00:02:01.399> knee

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
some fans this ALS is actually a knee

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.749 
some fans this ALS is actually a knee
leg<00:02:01.909> and<00:02:02.180> any<00:02:02.840> leg<00:02:03.140> this<00:02:04.009> car<00:02:04.310> runs<00:02:04.610> a

turbocharger<00:02:05.570> that<00:02:05.689> makes<00:02:05.869> a<00:02:05.960> huge<00:02:06.289> amount<00:02:06.619> of

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
turbocharger that makes a huge amount of

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.249 
turbocharger that makes a huge amount of
boost<00:02:06.920> and<00:02:07.250> where<00:02:08.119> you<00:02:08.269> hear<00:02:08.420> like<00:02:08.660> turbo<00:02:09.050> lag

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
boost and where you hear like turbo lag

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.500 
boost and where you hear like turbo lag
happening<00:02:09.800> in<00:02:09.920> turbocharged<00:02:10.429> cars<00:02:10.700> this<00:02:11.360> one

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
happening in turbocharged cars this one

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:12.970 
happening in turbocharged cars this one
has<00:02:11.660> none<00:02:11.840> of<00:02:11.870> that<00:02:12.050> because<00:02:12.410> it<00:02:12.500> has<00:02:12.620> an<00:02:12.739> any

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
has none of that because it has an any

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.009 
has none of that because it has an any
lag<00:02:13.250> system<00:02:13.760> whenever<00:02:14.269> you<00:02:14.360> lift<00:02:14.540> off<00:02:14.690> the<00:02:14.840> gas

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:15.019 
lag system whenever you lift off the gas

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:17.470 
lag system whenever you lift off the gas
it<00:02:15.590> essentially<00:02:15.980> shoots<00:02:16.430> flame<00:02:16.819> through<00:02:17.239> the

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
it essentially shoots flame through the

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.690 
it essentially shoots flame through the
turbo<00:02:17.870> keeping<00:02:18.319> it<00:02:18.440> spinning<00:02:18.830> so<00:02:19.459> that<00:02:19.489> when

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
turbo keeping it spinning so that when

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.040 
turbo keeping it spinning so that when
you<00:02:19.760> go<00:02:19.849> back<00:02:20.090> to<00:02:20.360> the<00:02:20.480> throttle<00:02:20.690> you<00:02:20.870> have

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
you go back to the throttle you have

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.340 
you go back to the throttle you have
maximum<00:02:21.650> power<00:02:21.830> instantly<00:02:22.959> ridiculous<00:02:23.959> it<00:02:24.200> is

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
maximum power instantly ridiculous it is

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.410 
maximum power instantly ridiculous it is
it<00:02:25.130> is<00:02:25.250> awesome<00:02:25.670> of<00:02:25.790> course<00:02:25.819> there's<00:02:26.180> all<00:02:26.299> the

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
it is awesome of course there's all the

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.210 
it is awesome of course there's all the
safety<00:02:26.630> stuff<00:02:26.840> and<00:02:27.560> everything<00:02:28.040> like<00:02:28.160> that

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
safety stuff and everything like that

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.030 
safety stuff and everything like that
but<00:02:28.640> the<00:02:28.900> cool<00:02:29.900> stuff<00:02:30.170> in<00:02:30.319> this<00:02:30.440> machine<00:02:30.830> is

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
but the cool stuff in this machine is

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.430 
but the cool stuff in this machine is
all<00:02:31.519> about<00:02:31.819> speed<00:02:32.269> and<00:02:32.450> power<00:02:32.660> and<00:02:33.019> I<00:02:33.260> gotta

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
all about speed and power and I gotta

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.400 
all about speed and power and I gotta
say<00:02:33.680> it's<00:02:33.890> one<00:02:34.430> of<00:02:34.459> the<00:02:34.790> most<00:02:35.540> wicked<00:02:36.200> evil

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
say it's one of the most wicked evil

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.650 
say it's one of the most wicked evil
little<00:02:36.860> machines<00:02:37.370> I<00:02:37.580> have<00:02:37.700> ever<00:02:38.000> driven<00:02:38.330> in<00:02:38.510> my

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
little machines I have ever driven in my

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.050 
little machines I have ever driven in my
life<00:02:38.870> and<00:02:39.470> I<00:02:39.560> love<00:02:39.799> it

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.620 

under<00:02:42.750> the<00:02:42.840> hood<00:02:43.520> where<00:02:44.520> normal<00:02:45.060> Fiesta<00:02:45.510> has

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
under the hood where normal Fiesta has

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.150 
under the hood where normal Fiesta has
the<00:02:45.780> engine<00:02:46.110> turned<00:02:46.319> this<00:02:46.530> way<00:02:46.770> this<00:02:47.010> has

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
the engine turned this way this has

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.420 
the engine turned this way this has
actually<00:02:47.310> been<00:02:47.520> turned<00:02:47.790> longitudinally<00:02:48.720> so

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
actually been turned longitudinally so

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.510 
actually been turned longitudinally so
if<00:02:50.430> the<00:02:51.330> transmission<00:02:51.900> is<00:02:52.260> way<00:02:52.920> back<00:02:53.220> there

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
if the transmission is way back there

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:54.500 
if the transmission is way back there
and<00:02:53.550> it<00:02:53.819> gives<00:02:53.910> a<00:02:54.060> better<00:02:54.180> weight

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
and it gives a better weight

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.930 
and it gives a better weight
distribution<00:02:55.280> we've<00:02:56.280> got<00:02:56.430> a<00:02:56.459> big<00:02:56.640> giant

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
distribution we've got a big giant

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.390 
distribution we've got a big giant
Garrett<00:02:57.390> turbo<00:02:57.870> and<00:02:58.080> then<00:02:58.890> this<00:02:59.099> is<00:02:59.280> the

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
Garrett turbo and then this is the

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.780 
Garrett turbo and then this is the
intercooler<00:02:59.849> up<00:03:00.330> here<00:03:01.260> this<00:03:01.410> huge<00:03:01.920> cooler<00:03:02.610> is

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
intercooler up here this huge cooler is

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.120 
intercooler up here this huge cooler is
the<00:03:02.940> intercooler<00:03:03.480> that<00:03:04.110> is<00:03:04.230> the<00:03:04.380> duratec<00:03:04.800> Ford

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
two litre olds berg's has built it up to

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.850 
two litre olds berg's has built it up to
run<00:03:08.370> almost<00:03:08.880> 600<00:03:09.569> horsepower<00:03:09.900> from<00:03:10.590> two

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
run almost 600 horsepower from two

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.640 
run almost 600 horsepower from two
litres<00:03:11.250> but<00:03:12.090> there's<00:03:12.780> not<00:03:12.930> a<00:03:12.989> lot<00:03:13.110> of<00:03:13.230> room<00:03:13.500> up

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
litres but there's not a lot of room up

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.220 
litres but there's not a lot of room up
here<00:03:13.860> now<00:03:14.010> so<00:03:14.280> the<00:03:15.239> radiators<00:03:15.720> actually<00:03:16.110> in

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
here now so the radiators actually in

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.720 
here now so the radiators actually in
the<00:03:16.350> back<00:03:16.500> we<00:03:16.739> can<00:03:16.890> go<00:03:16.980> take<00:03:17.160> a<00:03:17.250> look<00:03:17.430> here<00:03:19.730> so

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
the back we can go take a look here so

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.000 
the back we can go take a look here so
if<00:03:20.819> you<00:03:20.910> take<00:03:21.030> a<00:03:21.090> look<00:03:21.299> back<00:03:21.450> here<00:03:21.810> or<00:03:22.620> normally

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
if you take a look back here or normally

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.009 
if you take a look back here or normally
you<00:03:23.100> might<00:03:23.130> find<00:03:23.549> some<00:03:24.299> back<00:03:24.510> seats<00:03:24.810> or

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
you might find some back seats or

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:26.990 
you might find some back seats or
something<00:03:25.100> here<00:03:26.100> you<00:03:26.220> can<00:03:26.370> see<00:03:26.549> the<00:03:26.670> radiator

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
something here you can see the radiator

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.910 
something here you can see the radiator
and<00:03:27.150> a<00:03:27.239> big<00:03:27.420> massive<00:03:27.720> fan<00:03:28.230> so<00:03:28.530> it<00:03:28.680> helps<00:03:28.890> with

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
and a big massive fan so it helps with

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:29.839 
and a big massive fan so it helps with
weight<00:03:29.130> distribution

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:29.849 
weight distribution

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:31.940 
weight distribution
it<00:03:30.269> keeps<00:03:30.540> the<00:03:30.690> radiator<00:03:31.049> protected<00:03:31.620> from<00:03:31.799> the

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
it keeps the radiator protected from the

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.470 
it keeps the radiator protected from the
rocks<00:03:32.160> and<00:03:32.400> mud<00:03:32.549> that<00:03:32.610> get<00:03:33.209> kicked<00:03:33.480> up<00:03:33.660> and<00:03:35.480> it

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
rocks and mud that get kicked up and it

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.020 
rocks and mud that get kicked up and it
makes<00:03:36.660> it<00:03:36.810> extra<00:03:37.140> hot<00:03:37.290> inside<00:03:37.500> the<00:03:37.860> car<00:03:38.069> just

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
makes it extra hot inside the car just

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.570 
makes it extra hot inside the car just
has<00:03:39.180> like<00:03:39.360> a<00:03:39.420> little<00:03:39.630> added<00:03:39.989> bonus<00:03:40.019> it<00:03:40.739> if<00:03:41.459> you

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
has like a little added bonus it if you

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.949 
has like a little added bonus it if you
look<00:03:41.730> underneath<00:03:42.030> here<00:03:42.569> you<00:03:44.510> can<00:03:45.510> see<00:03:45.690> all<00:03:45.840> the

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
look underneath here you can see all the
