bathroom<00:00:14.389> renovation<00:00:14.990> I<00:00:15.200> want<00:00:15.619> to<00:00:15.680> talk<00:00:15.830> about

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:15.980 
bathroom renovation I want to talk about

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:17.950 
bathroom renovation I want to talk about
some<00:00:16.280> of<00:00:16.309> the<00:00:16.460> things<00:00:16.640> that<00:00:16.880> well<00:00:17.300> if<00:00:17.539> I<00:00:17.690> had<00:00:17.840> it

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:17.960 
some of the things that well if I had it

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.850 
some of the things that well if I had it
to<00:00:18.110> do<00:00:18.260> over<00:00:18.289> again<00:00:18.650> I<00:00:19.100> would<00:00:19.640> probably<00:00:20.029> change

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:20.860 
to do over again I would probably change

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.080 
to do over again I would probably change
one<00:00:21.860> of<00:00:21.890> the<00:00:22.039> things<00:00:22.130> that<00:00:22.520> I<00:00:22.550> would<00:00:22.640> for<00:00:23.060> sure

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:23.090 
one of the things that I would for sure

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.030 
one of the things that I would for sure
change<00:00:23.810> is<00:00:24.080> the<00:00:24.200> way<00:00:24.320> that<00:00:24.500> I<00:00:24.530> did<00:00:24.770> the<00:00:24.860> light

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:25.040 
change is the way that I did the light

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.680 
change is the way that I did the light
switch<00:00:25.280> is<00:00:25.460> when<00:00:25.610> you<00:00:25.700> come<00:00:25.910> in<00:00:26.180> and<00:00:26.300> out<00:00:26.420> of

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:26.690 
switch is when you come in and out of

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:29.740 
switch is when you come in and out of
the<00:00:27.500> bathroom<00:00:27.800> I<00:00:28.070> was<00:00:28.640> sort<00:00:29.150> of<00:00:29.210> concerned

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:29.750 
the bathroom I was sort of concerned

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.729 
the bathroom I was sort of concerned
that<00:00:30.380> if<00:00:30.710> I<00:00:30.830> put<00:00:31.039> them<00:00:31.190> all<00:00:31.370> in<00:00:31.640> a<00:00:31.730> row<00:00:31.970> a<00:00:32.739> single

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:33.739 
that if I put them all in a row a single

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:35.950 
that if I put them all in a row a single
switches<00:00:34.250> it<00:00:35.059> would<00:00:35.239> be<00:00:35.360> like<00:00:35.510> too<00:00:35.840> many

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
switches it would be like too many

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.650 
switches it would be like too many
switches<00:00:36.350> and<00:00:36.710> so<00:00:37.460> when<00:00:37.579> what<00:00:37.969> I<00:00:38.000> did<00:00:38.270> instead

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660 
switches and so when what I did instead

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.180 
switches and so when what I did instead
is<00:00:38.719> there<00:00:39.079> here's<00:00:39.320> the<00:00:39.469> overhead<00:00:39.950> light

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190 
is there here's the overhead light

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.220 
is there here's the overhead light
here's<00:00:40.880> the<00:00:41.060> bathroom<00:00:41.210> light<00:00:41.720> here's<00:00:42.079> the

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:42.230 
here's the bathroom light here's the

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.150 
here's the bathroom light here's the
bathroom<00:00:42.680> fan<00:00:43.040> and<00:00:43.370> then<00:00:43.820> over<00:00:44.210> here<00:00:44.239> is<00:00:45.079> where

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.160 
bathroom fan and then over here is where

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.030 
bathroom fan and then over here is where
the<00:00:46.160> vanity<00:00:46.610> light<00:00:46.820> is<00:00:47.290> this<00:00:48.290> was<00:00:48.470> not<00:00:48.500> a<00:00:48.680> good

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:49.040 
the vanity light is this was not a good

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.310 
the vanity light is this was not a good
solution<00:00:49.700> ultimately<00:00:50.060> the<00:00:50.930> number<00:00:51.170> one

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 
solution ultimately the number one

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.380 
solution ultimately the number one
problem<00:00:51.829> I<00:00:51.980> have<00:00:52.250> the<00:00:52.489> first<00:00:52.640> problem<00:00:53.059> I<00:00:53.149> have

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
problem I have the first problem I have

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.690 
problem I have the first problem I have
is<00:00:53.630> that<00:00:54.050> when<00:00:54.410> I<00:00:54.470> gain<00:00:54.950> this<00:00:55.370> is<00:00:55.520> called

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:55.700 
is that when I gain this is called

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.819 
is that when I gain this is called
ganging<00:00:56.239> double<00:00:56.510> ganging<00:00:56.840> I<00:00:56.930> think<00:00:57.140> ganged

00:00:57.819 --> 00:00:57.829 
ganging double ganging I think ganged

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:01.810 
ganging double ganging I think ganged
the<00:00:58.750> exhaust<00:00:59.750> and<00:01:00.140> the<00:01:00.380> light<00:01:00.590> switch<00:01:00.980> it

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
the exhaust and the light switch it

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.119 
the exhaust and the light switch it
meant<00:01:02.149> that<00:01:02.270> I<00:01:02.480> could<00:01:02.630> not<00:01:02.930> put<00:01:03.469> a<00:01:03.500> timer<00:01:03.920> on

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
meant that I could not put a timer on

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.030 
meant that I could not put a timer on
the<00:01:04.430> exhaust<00:01:04.699> switch<00:01:05.149> and<00:01:05.449> we<00:01:05.659> have<00:01:05.869> found<00:01:06.860> I

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
the exhaust switch and we have found I

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.859 
the exhaust switch and we have found I
mean<00:01:07.159> you<00:01:07.280> need<00:01:07.399> a<00:01:07.460> whole<00:01:07.790> you<00:01:08.270> need<00:01:08.450> all<00:01:08.659> this

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 
mean you need a whole you need all this

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:11.739 
mean you need a whole you need all this
space<00:01:09.229> for<00:01:09.619> a<00:01:09.829> timer<00:01:10.219> that<00:01:10.640> means<00:01:11.509> that

00:01:11.739 --> 00:01:11.749 
space for a timer that means that

00:01:11.749 --> 00:01:13.959 
space for a timer that means that
sometimes<00:01:11.990> we<00:01:12.409> inadvertently<00:01:13.039> leave<00:01:13.340> the

00:01:13.959 --> 00:01:13.969 
sometimes we inadvertently leave the

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:15.849 
sometimes we inadvertently leave the
exhaust<00:01:14.270> fan<00:01:14.539> on<00:01:14.689> for<00:01:14.959> six<00:01:15.200> hours<00:01:15.619> in<00:01:15.799> the

00:01:15.849 --> 00:01:15.859 
exhaust fan on for six hours in the

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:17.980 
exhaust fan on for six hours in the
middle<00:01:16.039> of<00:01:16.189> the<00:01:16.310> winter<00:01:16.490> thereby<00:01:17.299> exhausting

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
middle of the winter thereby exhausting

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.739 
middle of the winter thereby exhausting
all<00:01:18.079> our<00:01:18.200> heat<00:01:18.380> into<00:01:18.679> the<00:01:18.709> environment<00:01:19.039> etc<00:01:19.999> so

00:01:20.739 --> 00:01:20.749 
all our heat into the environment etc so

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:24.999 
all our heat into the environment etc so
the<00:01:21.590> other<00:01:21.709> problem<00:01:22.159> is<00:01:22.280> that<00:01:22.479> honestly<00:01:24.009> when

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:25.009 
the other problem is that honestly when

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:26.440 
the other problem is that honestly when
you<00:01:25.100> first<00:01:25.279> come<00:01:25.459> into<00:01:25.609> the<00:01:25.670> bathroom<00:01:26.270> you

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
you first come into the bathroom you

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.389 
you first come into the bathroom you
pretty<00:01:27.020> much<00:01:27.200> want<00:01:27.409> to<00:01:27.529> put<00:01:27.679> on<00:01:27.770> the<00:01:27.889> overhead

00:01:28.389 --> 00:01:28.399 
pretty much want to put on the overhead

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:30.879 
pretty much want to put on the overhead
light<00:01:28.609> and<00:01:28.909> the<00:01:29.659> vanity<00:01:30.079> light<00:01:30.350> at<00:01:30.560> the<00:01:30.649> same

00:01:30.879 --> 00:01:30.889 
light and the vanity light at the same

00:01:30.889 --> 00:01:33.669 
light and the vanity light at the same
time<00:01:31.159> to<00:01:31.399> add<00:01:31.520> light<00:01:31.999> and<00:01:32.359> you<00:01:33.200> have<00:01:33.350> to<00:01:33.529> then

00:01:33.669 --> 00:01:33.679 
time to add light and you have to then

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:36.339 
time to add light and you have to then
go<00:01:33.920> to<00:01:34.159> two<00:01:34.459> light<00:01:34.700> switches<00:01:35.090> so<00:01:35.929> if<00:01:36.020> I<00:01:36.109> had<00:01:36.259> it

00:01:36.339 --> 00:01:36.349 
go to two light switches so if I had it

00:01:36.349 --> 00:01:38.789 
go to two light switches so if I had it
to<00:01:36.469> do<00:01:36.619> all<00:01:36.649> over<00:01:36.799> again<00:01:37.039> I<00:01:37.249> would<00:01:37.909> have

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:38.799 
to do all over again I would have

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:42.779 
to do all over again I would have
overhead<00:01:39.799> light<00:01:39.979> vanity<00:01:40.939> light<00:01:41.229> shower<00:01:42.229> light

00:01:42.779 --> 00:01:42.789 
overhead light vanity light shower light

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:47.830 
overhead light vanity light shower light
exhaust<00:01:43.789> fan<00:01:44.740> boom-boom-boom-boom<00:01:45.819> and<00:01:46.840> I'd

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
exhaust fan boom-boom-boom-boom and I'd

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.999 
exhaust fan boom-boom-boom-boom and I'd
have<00:01:48.020> a<00:01:48.049> timer<00:01:48.529> on<00:01:48.829> the<00:01:49.459> exhaust<00:01:49.819> fan<00:01:50.270> and<00:01:51.009> so

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
have a timer on the exhaust fan and so

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:53.769 
have a timer on the exhaust fan and so
what<00:01:52.219> if<00:01:52.340> I<00:01:52.429> have<00:01:52.609> four<00:01:52.880> switches<00:01:53.149> here<00:01:53.479> and

00:01:53.769 --> 00:01:53.779 
what if I have four switches here and

00:01:53.779 --> 00:01:54.999 
what if I have four switches here and
they're<00:01:53.929> kind<00:01:54.139> of<00:01:54.200> ugly<00:01:54.349> and<00:01:54.499> they<00:01:54.619> take<00:01:54.799> up<00:01:54.919> a

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 
they're kind of ugly and they take up a

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:58.349 
they're kind of ugly and they take up a
lot<00:01:55.159> of<00:01:55.189> room<00:01:55.399> it<00:01:55.759> would<00:01:56.090> work<00:01:56.329> a<00:01:56.569> lot<00:01:56.749> better

00:01:58.349 --> 00:01:58.359 
lot of room it would work a lot better

00:01:58.359 --> 00:02:03.039 
lot of room it would work a lot better
Here<00:01:59.359> I<00:01:59.389> am<00:01:59.509> in<00:01:59.779> the<00:01:59.869> shower<00:01:59.899> again<00:02:01.630> this<00:02:02.630> is<00:02:02.869> my

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:03.049 
Here I am in the shower again this is my

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:06.459 
Here I am in the shower again this is my
swan<00:02:03.560> stone<00:02:04.159> solid<00:02:05.060> surface<00:02:05.630> shower<00:02:06.109> base

had it to do over again I

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.929 
had it to do over again I
would<00:02:14.709> really<00:02:15.250> really<00:02:15.670> look<00:02:16.030> at<00:02:16.329> the<00:02:17.140> Kolar

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:17.939

which I didn't know existed at the time
or<00:02:25.510> I<00:02:25.569> would<00:02:26.110> look<00:02:26.290> at<00:02:26.530> one<00:02:27.159> of<00:02:27.189> the<00:02:27.489> terrazzo

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
or I would look at one of the terrazzo

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.520 
or I would look at one of the terrazzo
bases<00:02:28.930> that<00:02:29.590> I<00:02:29.650> subsequently<00:02:30.220> discovered<00:02:31.530> the

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
bases that I subsequently discovered the

bases that I subsequently discovered the
trade-offs<00:02:33.099> here<00:02:33.280> are<00:02:33.879> that<00:02:34.180> on<00:02:34.299> these<00:02:34.450> Swan

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
trade-offs here are that on these Swan

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.380 
trade-offs here are that on these Swan
stone<00:02:35.200> bases<00:02:35.799> they<00:02:36.370> offer<00:02:36.549> like<00:02:36.819> a<00:02:36.970> lot<00:02:37.359> of

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
stone bases they offer like a lot of

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.440 
stone bases they offer like a lot of
different<00:02:37.780> sizes<00:02:38.260> including<00:02:39.040> 34<00:02:39.849> inches<00:02:40.180> wide

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
different sizes including 34 inches wide

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.649 
different sizes including 34 inches wide
which<00:02:41.290> I<00:02:41.409> really<00:02:41.739> thought<00:02:41.920> I<00:02:41.980> wanted<00:02:42.549> I<00:02:42.730> think

00:02:43.649 --> 00:02:43.659 
which I really thought I wanted I think

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:46.530 
which I really thought I wanted I think
that<00:02:43.840> the<00:02:43.989> Kohler<00:02:44.459> forces<00:02:45.459> you<00:02:45.579> into<00:02:45.730> 36

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
that the Kohler forces you into 36

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.479 
that the Kohler forces you into 36
inches<00:02:47.049> wide<00:02:47.109> if<00:02:47.590> I<00:02:47.709> am<00:02:48.069> remembering

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
inches wide if I am remembering

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:51.059 
inches wide if I am remembering
correctly<00:02:48.790> and<00:02:49.359> they<00:02:50.230> might<00:02:50.440> not<00:02:50.590> have<00:02:50.650> like

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:51.069 
correctly and they might not have like

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:56.009 
correctly and they might not have like
54<00:02:51.730> inches<00:02:52.180> they<00:02:52.450> go<00:02:52.569> from<00:02:52.810> 48<00:02:53.379> to<00:02:53.799> 60<00:02:54.480> but<00:02:55.480> I'll

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.019 
54 inches they go from 48 to 60 but I'll

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:58.619 
54 inches they go from 48 to 60 but I'll
tell<00:02:56.319> you<00:02:56.530> these<00:02:56.680> Swan<00:02:57.220> stone<00:02:57.639> and<00:02:58.000> fiberglass

00:02:58.619 --> 00:02:58.629 
tell you these Swan stone and fiberglass

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:01.199 
tell you these Swan stone and fiberglass
bases<00:02:59.349> I<00:02:59.650> find<00:03:00.280> them<00:03:00.430> very<00:03:00.459> hard<00:03:00.849> to<00:03:01.030> keep

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
bases I find them very hard to keep

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:03.960 
bases I find them very hard to keep
clean<00:03:01.269> although<00:03:02.079> I<00:03:02.530> am<00:03:02.829> NOT<00:03:03.069> the<00:03:03.459> best<00:03:03.579> cleaner

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
clean although I am NOT the best cleaner

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.720 
clean although I am NOT the best cleaner
in<00:03:04.180> the<00:03:04.269> world<00:03:05.129> but<00:03:06.129> I<00:03:06.159> don't<00:03:06.250> really<00:03:06.489> have<00:03:06.609> a

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
in the world but I don't really have a

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.759 
in the world but I don't really have a
problem<00:03:06.970> with<00:03:07.180> it<00:03:07.480> it's<00:03:07.720> just<00:03:07.840> that<00:03:08.139> I<00:03:08.170> think<00:03:08.290> I

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
problem with it it's just that I think I

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:11.009 
problem with it it's just that I think I
would<00:03:09.159> like<00:03:09.310> the<00:03:09.459> Kohler<00:03:09.720> cast<00:03:10.720> iron

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
would like the Kohler cast iron

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:14.309 
would like the Kohler cast iron
porcelain<00:03:11.829> enamel<00:03:12.370> better<00:03:12.840> the<00:03:13.840> other<00:03:13.989> thing

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 
porcelain enamel better the other thing

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:16.800 
porcelain enamel better the other thing
that<00:03:14.349> I<00:03:14.709> would<00:03:14.859> really<00:03:15.069> look<00:03:15.310> at<00:03:15.810> doing

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
that I would really look at doing

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.650 
that I would really look at doing
differently<00:03:17.230> I<00:03:17.730> really<00:03:18.730> think<00:03:19.090> that<00:03:19.180> you<00:03:19.449> need

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
differently I really think that you need

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.069 
differently I really think that you need
at<00:03:20.019> least<00:03:20.530> 34<00:03:21.459> inches<00:03:22.000> within<00:03:22.599> these<00:03:22.930> spaces

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:23.079 
at least 34 inches within these spaces

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:26.659 
at least 34 inches within these spaces
which<00:03:23.680> is<00:03:23.829> what<00:03:24.010> this<00:03:24.129> is<00:03:24.510> it<00:03:25.510> would<00:03:25.750> be<00:03:25.810> better

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:26.669 
which is what this is it would be better

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:29.640 
which is what this is it would be better
definitely<00:03:27.669> better<00:03:28.000> to<00:03:28.180> have<00:03:28.389> 36<00:03:29.139> inches<00:03:29.349> of

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
definitely better to have 36 inches of

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.759 
definitely better to have 36 inches of
width<00:03:30.159> and<00:03:30.549> I<00:03:31.269> honestly<00:03:31.780> think<00:03:32.049> I<00:03:32.230> could<00:03:32.650> have

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
width and I honestly think I could have

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:34.740 
width and I honestly think I could have
done<00:03:32.949> it<00:03:33.159> I<00:03:33.310> could<00:03:33.549> have<00:03:33.669> fit<00:03:34.000> it<00:03:34.120> into<00:03:34.359> the<00:03:34.599> bat

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
done it I could have fit it into the bat

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.550 
done it I could have fit it into the bat
to<00:03:35.079> this<00:03:35.199> bathroom<00:03:36.269> reason<00:03:37.269> I<00:03:37.359> say<00:03:37.540> 36<00:03:38.139> inches

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
to this bathroom reason I say 36 inches

to this bathroom reason I say 36 inches

is not only elbow room for remember when

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:45.030 
is not only elbow room for remember when

grab bar here and you know what I

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.149 
grab bar here and you know what I
probably<00:03:49.209> should<00:03:49.989> have<00:03:50.139> just<00:03:50.260> went<00:03:50.709> ahead<00:03:50.829> and

00:03:51.149 --> 00:03:51.159 
probably should have just went ahead and

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:53.369 
probably should have just went ahead and
put<00:03:51.370> one<00:03:51.400> in<00:03:51.819> although<00:03:52.060> I<00:03:52.180> have<00:03:52.449> structure<00:03:53.109> for

00:03:53.369 --> 00:03:53.379 
put one in although I have structure for

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:55.770 
put one in although I have structure for
it<00:03:53.560> we<00:03:54.069> did<00:03:54.250> put<00:03:54.459> reinforcement<00:03:54.760> in<00:03:55.419> here<00:03:55.569> for

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
it we did put reinforcement in here for

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.969 
it we did put reinforcement in here for
a<00:03:55.810> grab<00:03:56.019> bar<00:03:56.260> you<00:03:57.220> know<00:03:57.340> I<00:03:58.060> might<00:03:58.780> I<00:03:59.079> have<00:03:59.829> to

00:03:59.969 --> 00:03:59.979 
a grab bar you know I might I have to

00:03:59.979 --> 00:04:01.619 
a grab bar you know I might I have to
think<00:04:00.159> about<00:04:00.250> it<00:04:00.519> I<00:04:00.609> might<00:04:00.909> maybe<00:04:01.209> should<00:04:01.599> I

00:04:01.619 --> 00:04:01.629 
think about it I might maybe should I

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:03.270 
think about it I might maybe should I
just<00:04:01.840> gone<00:04:02.049> ahead<00:04:02.199> and<00:04:02.349> put<00:04:02.530> the<00:04:02.650> grab<00:04:02.829> bar<00:04:03.069> in

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
just gone ahead and put the grab bar in

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.300 
just gone ahead and put the grab bar in
because<00:04:03.639> you<00:04:03.790> know<00:04:03.909> I<00:04:03.940> have<00:04:04.239> heard<00:04:04.479> my<00:04:04.690> back<00:04:04.930> in

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
because you know I have heard my back in

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.409 
because you know I have heard my back in
the<00:04:06.310> couple<00:04:06.669> years<00:04:06.699> since<00:04:07.000> we<00:04:07.180> did<00:04:07.299> these

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:07.419 
the couple years since we did these

00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:08.789 
the couple years since we did these
bathrooms<00:04:07.900> and<00:04:08.079> it's<00:04:08.199> nice<00:04:08.349> to<00:04:08.379> have<00:04:08.560> that

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:08.799

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.090 
if I had it to do over again I would

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:51.000 
if I had it to do over again I would
place<00:04:49.300> it<00:04:49.510> a<00:04:49.660> little<00:04:49.900> further<00:04:50.230> out<00:04:50.500> because

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.010 
place it a little further out because

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:53.880 
place it a little further out because
when<00:04:51.280> you're<00:04:51.760> you<00:04:52.240> know<00:04:52.470> hanging<00:04:53.470> out<00:04:53.590> it's

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:53.890 
when you're you know hanging out it's

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:56.820

like<00:04:54.010> a<00:04:54.070> little<00:04:54.400> too<00:04:54.640> scrunchie<00:04:55.600> I<00:04:55.870> think<00:04:56.710> it

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
like a little too scrunchie I think it

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.440 
like a little too scrunchie I think it
would<00:04:56.950> have<00:04:57.040> been<00:04:57.070> better<00:04:57.310> to<00:04:57.640> put<00:04:57.940> it<00:04:57.970> here

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:58.450 
would have been better to put it here

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:02.220 
would have been better to put it here
ideally<00:05:00.060> that's<00:05:01.060> where<00:05:01.420> your<00:05:01.540> teepee<00:05:01.930> holder
