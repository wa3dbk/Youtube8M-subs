00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.540 
horsepower on it it's dying well it's
running<00:00:26.189> it's<00:00:26.849> running<00:00:26.939> good<00:00:27.300> but<00:00:27.779> once<00:00:27.990> you

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:28.550 
running it's running good but once you

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.740 
running it's running good but once you
do<00:00:29.810> once<00:00:30.810> wot<00:00:31.679> which<00:00:32.640> stands<00:00:32.940> for<00:00:33.090> wide<00:00:33.450> open

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
do once wot which stands for wide open

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:40.819 
do once wot which stands for wide open
throttle<00:00:37.010> once<00:00:38.010> I<00:00:38.129> do<00:00:38.190> that<00:00:38.370> I<00:00:39.710> it'll<00:00:40.710> go

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
throttle once I do that I it'll go

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.540 
throttle once I do that I it'll go
around<00:00:40.980> 3035<00:00:41.879> you<00:00:42.510> know<00:00:42.660> I<00:00:43.590> get<00:00:44.219> to<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.430> other

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
around 3035 you know I get to the other

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.639 
around 3035 you know I get to the other
end<00:00:44.760> of<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:44.910> lake<00:00:45.030> in<00:00:45.270> it<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:45.719> I<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:46.110> I<00:00:46.230> stop

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
end of the lake in it and I and I stop

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.250 
end of the lake in it and I and I stop
for<00:00:46.950> a<00:00:47.010> minute<00:00:47.100> and<00:00:47.660> then<00:00:48.660> try<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:48.899> take<00:00:49.079> off

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
for a minute and then try to take off

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.319 
for a minute and then try to take off
and<00:00:49.530> it<00:00:50.430> just<00:00:51.000> misses<00:00:51.239> all<00:00:51.510> over<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.930> place

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:53.329 
and it just misses all over the place

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:57.950 
and it just misses all over the place
right<00:00:54.329> now<00:00:54.539> I'm<00:00:54.780> taking<00:00:55.350> I've<00:00:55.680> got<00:00:56.719> the<00:00:57.719> power

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
right now I'm taking I've got the power

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.380 
right now I'm taking I've got the power
pack<00:00:58.260> which<00:00:58.559> is<00:00:58.739> new<00:01:01.340> hopefully<00:01:02.340> that's<00:01:02.699> what

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
pack which is new hopefully that's what

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.600 
pack which is new hopefully that's what
it<00:01:03.539> is<00:01:03.570> it<00:01:04.019> could<00:01:04.170> be<00:01:04.229> a<00:01:04.350> background<00:01:04.920> -<00:01:05.280> it

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
it is it could be a background - it

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.030 
it is it could be a background - it
sounds<00:01:06.060> like<00:01:06.150> these<00:01:06.299> ignitions<00:01:06.869> are<00:01:07.049> good<00:01:07.860> for

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
sounds like these ignitions are good for

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.880 
sounds like these ignitions are good for
grounds<00:01:08.430> but<00:01:08.640> uh<00:01:08.670> I<00:01:09.119> do<00:01:09.689> have<00:01:09.810> one<00:01:10.290> bad<00:01:10.530> coil

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
grounds but uh I do have one bad coil

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.490 
grounds but uh I do have one bad coil
there's<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.250> coil<00:01:11.520> that<00:01:11.729> goes<00:01:11.880> here<00:01:12.320> here<00:01:13.320> and

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
there's a coil that goes here here and

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.620 
there's a coil that goes here here and
here

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:22.310 

three<00:01:16.049> cylinder<00:01:16.590> I<00:01:16.799> come<00:01:17.369> over<00:01:17.520> here<00:01:21.320> this

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
three cylinder I come over here this

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.780 
three cylinder I come over here this
coil<00:01:22.650> pack<00:01:22.950> here<00:01:25.130> will<00:01:26.130> not<00:01:26.310> get<00:01:26.520> an<00:01:26.610> ohms

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
coil pack here will not get an ohms

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.179 
coil pack here will not get an ohms
reading<00:01:27.330> off<00:01:27.780> of<00:01:28.110> here<00:01:28.470> off<00:01:29.009> of<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.759> spark<00:01:30.270> to

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:31.189 
reading off of here off of the spark to

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:38.749 
reading off of here off of the spark to
the<00:01:32.189> main<00:01:32.930> and<00:01:34.759> this<00:01:35.759> one<00:01:35.970> gets<00:01:36.270> about<00:01:36.840> I<00:01:37.759> think

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
the main and this one gets about I think

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.460 
the main and this one gets about I think
it's<00:01:38.909> around<00:01:39.030> eleven<00:01:39.570> hundred<00:01:39.689> ohms<00:01:39.990> from

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
it's around eleven hundred ohms from

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.950 
it's around eleven hundred ohms from
here<00:01:40.710> to<00:01:40.829> there<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.329> then<00:01:42.329> I<00:01:42.450> have<00:01:42.600> this<00:01:42.750> new

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
here to there and then I have this new

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.929 
here to there and then I have this new
one<00:01:43.170> made<00:01:43.409> by<00:01:43.439> CDI<00:01:44.479> electronics<00:01:45.479> corporation

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:46.939 
one made by CDI electronics corporation

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:51.679 
one made by CDI electronics corporation
and<00:01:48.350> by<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.409> way<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.829> specs<00:01:50.369> what<00:01:50.729> I<00:01:50.759> read<00:01:51.240> is

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
and by the way the specs what I read is

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.690 
and by the way the specs what I read is
they<00:01:51.990> should<00:01:52.320> be<00:01:52.530> around<00:01:52.890> two<00:01:53.189> to<00:01:53.369> three

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
they should be around two to three

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.350 
they should be around two to three
hundred<00:01:53.729> ohms<00:01:54.600> and<00:01:55.250> from<00:01:56.250> there<00:01:56.490> to<00:01:57.149> there

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
hundred ohms and from there to there

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.600 
hundred ohms and from there to there
which<00:01:57.689> is<00:01:57.899> an<00:01:58.140> aftermarket<00:01:58.590> so<00:01:59.159> don't<00:01:59.460> have

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
which is an aftermarket so don't have

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:00.920 
which is an aftermarket so don't have
the<00:01:59.729> wires<00:01:59.939> hanging<00:02:00.210> out<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:00.630> it's<00:02:00.719> a<00:02:00.810> lot

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
the wires hanging out and it's a lot

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.060 
the wires hanging out and it's a lot
nicer<00:02:02.450> it's<00:02:03.450> about<00:02:03.659> 200<00:02:04.530> and<00:02:04.619> something<00:02:04.860> ohms

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
nicer it's about 200 and something ohms

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.400 
nicer it's about 200 and something ohms
which<00:02:05.549> you<00:02:06.360> know<00:02:06.479> that<00:02:07.290> means<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:08.520> reason

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
which you know that means the reason

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.809 
which you know that means the reason
what<00:02:10.410> I'm<00:02:10.500> trying<00:02:10.709> to<00:02:10.800> get<00:02:11.009> at<00:02:11.220> is<00:02:11.400> I'm<00:02:11.520> trying

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
what I'm trying to get at is I'm trying

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.130 
what I'm trying to get at is I'm trying
to<00:02:11.910> troubleshoot<00:02:12.150> what

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
to troubleshoot what

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.220 
to troubleshoot what
going<00:02:13.470> on<00:02:13.650> here<00:02:14.190> and<00:02:14.310> I<00:02:15.210> think<00:02:15.510> we've<00:02:15.870> got<00:02:16.110> it

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
going on here and I think we've got it

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.600 
going on here and I think we've got it
figured<00:02:16.380> out<00:02:16.650> we're<00:02:16.890> going<00:02:16.980> to<00:02:17.040> do<00:02:17.130> some<00:02:17.340> tests

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
figured out we're going to do some tests

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.010 
figured out we're going to do some tests
if<00:02:17.790> it<00:02:17.880> don't<00:02:18.030> work<00:02:18.150> we'll<00:02:18.569> have<00:02:18.750> another

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
if it don't work we'll have another

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.090 
if it don't work we'll have another
video<00:02:19.440> if<00:02:20.130> not<00:02:20.220> we'll<00:02:20.670> be<00:02:20.700> on<00:02:20.970> the<00:02:21.000> water<00:02:21.360> I<00:02:22.100> got

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
video if not we'll be on the water I got

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.390 
video if not we'll be on the water I got
the<00:02:23.220> power<00:02:23.459> package<00:02:23.819> because<00:02:24.209> the<00:02:25.069> look<00:02:26.069> a

the power package because the look a
little<00:02:26.580> windy<00:02:26.970> out<00:02:27.060> today<00:02:28.160> in<00:02:29.160> turbines<00:02:29.580> up

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
little windy out today in turbines up

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:36.430 
little windy out today in turbines up
there's<00:02:30.060> been<00:02:30.330> in<00:02:30.450> pretty<00:02:30.630> good

fairly old there's no date stamps on it
or<00:02:43.730> anything<00:02:44.000> I<00:02:44.240> mean<00:02:44.600> it<00:02:44.900> might<00:02:45.710> be<00:02:45.740> a<00:02:46.010> date

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
or anything I mean it might be a date

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.170 
or anything I mean it might be a date
stamp<00:02:46.760> there<00:02:47.120> but<00:02:48.760> we're<00:02:49.760> going<00:02:49.880> to<00:02:50.000> give<00:02:50.090> her

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
stamp there but we're going to give her

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.060 
stamp there but we're going to give her
a<00:02:50.240> shot<00:02:50.570> and<00:02:50.750> see<00:02:50.930> if<00:02:50.990> we<00:02:51.080> can<00:02:51.230> get<00:02:51.350> that<00:02:51.680> puppy

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
a shot and see if we can get that puppy

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.780 
a shot and see if we can get that puppy
to<00:02:52.190> run<00:02:52.370> right<00:02:52.700> I<00:02:53.360> say<00:02:54.230> all<00:02:54.470> three<00:02:54.830> the<00:02:55.040> coils

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
to run right I say all three the coils

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.730 
to run right I say all three the coils
probably<00:02:56.330> need<00:02:56.480> to<00:02:56.540> replace<00:02:56.630> I've<00:02:57.110> got<00:02:57.290> two<00:02:57.530> of

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:57.740 
probably need to replace I've got two of

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:02.070 
probably need to replace I've got two of
them<00:02:57.890> so<00:02:58.190> far<00:02:58.460> I<00:02:59.000> just<00:02:59.180> got<00:02:59.480> to<00:02:59.570> get<00:02:59.630> one<00:02:59.810> more

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.640 

after<00:03:03.080> getting<00:03:03.230> the<00:03:03.410> reading<00:03:04.120> of<00:03:05.120> the<00:03:05.570> coil<00:03:06.410> is

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
after getting the reading of the coil is

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.650 
after getting the reading of the coil is
good<00:03:06.890> I'm<00:03:07.160> definitely<00:03:07.670> going<00:03:07.880> to<00:03:07.940> get<00:03:08.330> a<00:03:08.390> third

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
good I'm definitely going to get a third

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.900 
good I'm definitely going to get a third
one<00:03:08.690> so<00:03:09.170> that<00:03:09.350> way<00:03:09.500> we'll<00:03:09.680> be<00:03:09.860> good<00:03:10.310> to<00:03:10.370> go<00:03:10.490> and

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
one so that way we'll be good to go and

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:15.390 
one so that way we'll be good to go and
how<00:03:11.720> many<00:03:11.960> problems<00:03:12.910> later<00:03:13.910> in<00:03:14.090> the<00:03:14.150> future

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
how many problems later in the future

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.540 
how many problems later in the future
but<00:03:16.400> this<00:03:16.700> is<00:03:16.910> a<00:03:16.940> power<00:03:17.270> pack<00:03:17.660> right<00:03:18.050> here<00:03:18.550> this

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:19.550 
but this is a power pack right here this

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:23.410 
but this is a power pack right here this
thing<00:03:19.880> actually<00:03:20.350> the<00:03:21.350> coils<00:03:22.090> connect<00:03:23.090> to<00:03:23.210> one

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
thing actually the coils connect to one

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:28.150 
thing actually the coils connect to one
two<00:03:23.750> and<00:03:23.960> three<00:03:24.320> and<00:03:26.260> down<00:03:27.260> here<00:03:27.590> at<00:03:27.680> the<00:03:27.860> brown

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
two and three and down here at the brown

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:34.720 
two and three and down here at the brown
orange<00:03:29.920> the<00:03:30.920> stator<00:03:31.250> goes<00:03:31.640> into<00:03:32.090> it<00:03:33.730> charges

this<00:03:35.030> power<00:03:35.360> pack<00:03:35.750> up<00:03:36.080> and<00:03:36.850> then<00:03:37.850> the

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
this power pack up and then the

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.430 
this power pack up and then the
underneath<00:03:38.480> the<00:03:38.990> flywheel<00:03:39.740> is<00:03:40.280> a<00:03:40.340> timer<00:03:41.440> which

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
underneath the flywheel is a timer which

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.710 
underneath the flywheel is a timer which
plugs<00:03:42.830> into<00:03:43.010> over<00:03:43.580> here<00:03:43.850> I<00:03:43.880> believe<00:03:44.240> around

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
plugs into over here I believe around

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.350 
plugs into over here I believe around
the<00:03:44.900> black<00:03:45.200> or<00:03:45.500> so<00:03:45.740> over<00:03:46.520> here<00:03:46.700> the<00:03:46.820> cents<00:03:47.120> one

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 
the black or so over here the cents one

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.330 
the black or so over here the cents one
two<00:03:47.630> and<00:03:47.810> three<00:03:48.110> on<00:03:48.290> the<00:03:48.440> right<00:03:48.620> side<00:03:49.010> here

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
two and three on the right side here

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.570 
two and three on the right side here
right<00:03:49.700> below<00:03:49.880> the<00:03:50.180> vacant<00:03:50.980> the<00:03:51.980> timer<00:03:52.220> tells

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:52.580 
right below the vacant the timer tells

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:55.450 
right below the vacant the timer tells
the<00:03:53.060> power<00:03:53.270> pack<00:03:53.600> when<00:03:53.870> to<00:03:53.990> fire<00:03:54.230> off<00:03:54.530> as<00:03:54.860> the

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:55.460 
the power pack when to fire off as the

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:57.610 
the power pack when to fire off as the
magnets<00:03:55.940> going<00:03:56.420> around<00:03:56.720> the<00:03:56.900> flywheel<00:03:57.440> and

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
magnets going around the flywheel and

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.020 
magnets going around the flywheel and
hitting<00:03:58.040> the<00:03:58.480> timer<00:03:59.590> so<00:04:00.590> that's<00:04:01.370> one<00:04:01.610> reason

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
hitting the timer so that's one reason

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.180 
hitting the timer so that's one reason
it<00:04:02.210> was<00:04:02.420> missing<00:04:02.780> so<00:04:02.960> badly<00:04:03.230> that<00:04:03.470> I<00:04:03.680> wanted<00:04:04.130> to

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
it was missing so badly that I wanted to

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.880 
it was missing so badly that I wanted to
just<00:04:04.550> go<00:04:04.730> ahead<00:04:04.820> and<00:04:04.970> grab<00:04:05.270> a<00:04:05.300> timer<00:04:05.750> or<00:04:06.140> a<00:04:06.170> time

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:06.890 
just go ahead and grab a timer or a time

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:09.670 
just go ahead and grab a timer or a time
or<00:04:07.130> a<00:04:07.160> bit<00:04:07.310> of<00:04:07.459> a<00:04:08.300> pack<00:04:08.570> just<00:04:09.110> in<00:04:09.260> case<00:04:09.470> it

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
or a bit of a pack just in case it

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.400 
or a bit of a pack just in case it
was<00:04:09.709> faulty<00:04:10.390> but

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.500 

this<00:04:14.410> is<00:04:14.620> a<00:04:14.760> been<00:04:15.760> a<00:04:15.790> pretty<00:04:16.090> good<00:04:16.239> project

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
this is a been a pretty good project

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:25.500 
this is a been a pretty good project
here<00:04:17.200> I<00:04:17.230> guess<00:04:19.470> I've<00:04:23.070> done<00:04:24.070> ohms<00:04:24.400> test<00:04:24.970> on<00:04:25.300> the

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510 
here I guess I've done ohms test on the

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:28.770 
here I guess I've done ohms test on the
stator<00:04:26.290> and<00:04:27.150> took<00:04:28.150> all<00:04:28.330> three<00:04:28.600> of<00:04:28.690> the

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
stator and took all three of the

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.730 
stator and took all three of the
carburetors<00:04:29.380> apart<00:04:29.770> this<00:04:29.920> weekend<00:04:31.740> there's

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
carburetors apart this weekend there's

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:37.340 
carburetors apart this weekend there's
one<00:04:33.280> carburetor<00:04:34.290> one<00:04:35.290> down<00:04:35.530> in<00:04:35.740> air<00:04:35.920> one

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350 
one carburetor one down in air one

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:39.480 
one carburetor one down in air one
another<00:04:38.350> laundry<00:04:38.740> car<00:04:38.950> Barry<00:04:39.160> took<00:04:39.310> those

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
another laundry car Barry took those

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.280 
another laundry car Barry took those
part<00:04:39.850> cleaning<00:04:40.180> them<00:04:40.270> up<00:04:40.420> they<00:04:40.630> were<00:04:40.690> actually

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:41.290 
part cleaning them up they were actually

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:43.830 
part cleaning them up they were actually
really<00:04:41.500> clean<00:04:41.890> the<00:04:42.460> motor<00:04:42.670> runs<00:04:42.910> good<00:04:43.300> when<00:04:43.690> it

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 
really clean the motor runs good when it

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.620 
really clean the motor runs good when it
does<00:04:44.080> go<00:04:44.380> but<00:04:44.820> if<00:04:45.820> it's<00:04:46.060> done<00:04:46.150> for<00:04:46.540> the<00:04:46.600> day

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:46.630 
does go but if it's done for the day

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.330 
does go but if it's done for the day
it's<00:04:46.990> done<00:04:47.200> for<00:04:47.290> the<00:04:47.380> day<00:04:47.560> so<00:04:47.620> I<00:04:47.800> figured<00:04:48.220> it's

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
it's done for the day so I figured it's

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.560 
it's done for the day so I figured it's
the<00:04:48.400> ignition<00:04:49.380> and<00:04:50.700> with<00:04:51.700> all<00:04:51.880> meeting<00:04:52.240> I<00:04:52.360> got

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.570 
the ignition and with all meeting I got

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:56.310 
the ignition and with all meeting I got
reading<00:04:53.110> I<00:04:53.260> got<00:04:53.470> after<00:04:53.860> I<00:04:54.370> got<00:04:54.670> the<00:04:54.910> new<00:04:55.320> coil

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320 
reading I got after I got the new coil

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.410 
reading I got after I got the new coil
in<00:04:56.590> I'm<00:04:56.860> pretty<00:04:57.100> positive<00:04:57.490> it's<00:04:58.000> going<00:04:58.180> to<00:04:58.240> be

00:04:58.410 --> 00:04:58.420 
in I'm pretty positive it's going to be

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:01.080 
in I'm pretty positive it's going to be
a<00:04:58.450> really<00:04:59.290> bad<00:04:59.440> coil<00:04:59.860> is<00:05:00.280> what's<00:05:00.580> going<00:05:00.850> to<00:05:00.880> end

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.090 
a really bad coil is what's going to end

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:07.040 
a really bad coil is what's going to end
up<00:05:01.720> being<00:05:02.700> but<00:05:04.140> how<00:05:05.140> much<00:05:05.290> you<00:05:05.350> guys<00:05:05.860> thank

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.050 
up being but how much you guys thank

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.280 
up being but how much you guys thank
also<00:05:08.050> have<00:05:08.350> a<00:05:08.410> core<00:05:08.620> I<00:05:08.650> have<00:05:09.010> a<00:05:09.150> course<00:05:10.290> they

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:11.290 
also have a core I have a course they

got this black stuff on these not sure

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:16.890 
got this black stuff on these not sure
what<00:05:15.100> it's<00:05:15.250> called<00:05:15.310> where<00:05:15.790> you<00:05:15.910> get<00:05:16.150> it<00:05:16.300> it's

what it's called where you get it it's
for<00:05:17.170> the<00:05:17.290> ground<00:05:17.560> wires<00:05:17.860> and<00:05:18.220> it's<00:05:18.340> like<00:05:18.460> a

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:18.490 
for the ground wires and it's like a

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:23.520 
for the ground wires and it's like a
rubber<00:05:20.910> it's<00:05:21.910> like<00:05:22.090> a<00:05:22.120> rubber<00:05:22.480> on<00:05:22.570> there<00:05:23.020> and

rubber it's like a rubber on there and
they<00:05:24.040> put<00:05:24.250> that<00:05:24.280> on<00:05:24.430> there<00:05:24.730> a<00:05:24.760> little<00:05:24.940> moisture

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:25.630 
they put that on there a little moisture

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:28.290 
they put that on there a little moisture
won't<00:05:25.900> get<00:05:26.169> into<00:05:26.320> the<00:05:26.530> ground<00:05:26.940> I'm<00:05:27.940> trying<00:05:28.240> to

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.300 
won't get into the ground I'm trying to

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.390 
won't get into the ground I'm trying to
find<00:05:28.720> some<00:05:29.080> of<00:05:29.169> that<00:05:29.290> stuff<00:05:29.590> it's<00:05:29.830> all<00:05:29.950> over

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.400 
find some of that stuff it's all over

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.030 
find some of that stuff it's all over
the<00:05:30.490> motor<00:05:30.730> everywhere<00:05:31.630> so<00:05:32.560> you<00:05:32.650> can<00:05:32.770> even<00:05:32.919> see

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:33.040 
the motor everywhere so you can even see

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.409 
the motor everywhere so you can even see
a<00:05:33.220> little<00:05:33.430> bit<00:05:33.610> right<00:05:33.820> there<00:05:33.850> from<00:05:34.240> where

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:34.419 
a little bit right there from where

somebody got some on that and it's all
over<00:05:37.120> these<00:05:37.240> conductors<00:05:37.870> underneath<00:05:38.560> this

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:39.690 
over these conductors underneath this

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:42.120 
over these conductors underneath this
bus<00:05:40.690> right<00:05:41.260> here<00:05:41.440> this<00:05:41.620> is<00:05:41.830> the<00:05:41.919> bus

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:42.130 
bus right here this is the bus

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:44.640 
bus right here this is the bus
underneath<00:05:42.790> this<00:05:42.970> plastic<00:05:43.210> here<00:05:43.690> all<00:05:44.470> those

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:44.650 
underneath this plastic here all those

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:48.740 
underneath this plastic here all those
wires<00:05:44.919> plugged<00:05:45.370> in<00:05:45.580> their<00:05:45.790> regulator<00:05:47.640> but

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:48.750 
wires plugged in their regulator but

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:54.360 
wires plugged in their regulator but
yeah<00:05:50.070> it's<00:05:51.070> a<00:05:51.190> good<00:05:51.370> motor<00:05:51.730> a<00:05:53.010> lot<00:05:54.010> of<00:05:54.130> power

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:54.370 
yeah it's a good motor a lot of power

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:57.860 
yeah it's a good motor a lot of power
pushes<00:05:54.880> this<00:05:55.030> boat<00:05:55.240> along<00:05:55.540> really<00:05:56.050> well

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:57.870
