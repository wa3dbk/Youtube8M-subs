with an optimal gear with the fast

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.290 
with an optimal gear with the fast
startup<00:00:24.960> time<00:00:25.260> it's<00:00:25.619> pretty<00:00:26.099> light<00:00:26.279> it's<00:00:27.180> got

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
startup time it's pretty light it's got

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.599 
startup time it's pretty light it's got
a<00:00:27.330> proper<00:00:27.660> Intel<00:00:27.990> processor<00:00:28.619> in<00:00:28.740> it<00:00:28.800> but<00:00:29.279> then

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
a proper Intel processor in it but then

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:30.890 
a proper Intel processor in it but then
what<00:00:29.789> they've<00:00:29.939> gone<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:30.300> done<00:00:30.390> is<00:00:30.599> putting

your<00:01:19.080> files<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.890> interesting<00:01:20.280> thing<00:01:20.340> about

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
your files the interesting thing about

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.249 
your files the interesting thing about
at<00:01:20.790> those<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:21.150> goes<00:01:21.299> furthers<00:01:21.720> got<00:01:21.930> you<00:01:22.140> know

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
at those it goes furthers got you know

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.219 
at those it goes furthers got you know
an<00:01:22.350> HDMI<00:01:22.860> output<00:01:23.640> it's<00:01:23.850> got<00:01:24.090> USB<00:01:24.420> so<00:01:25.110> you're

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
an HDMI output it's got USB so you're

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.030 
an HDMI output it's got USB so you're
not<00:01:25.320> going<00:01:25.439> to<00:01:25.500> do<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:25.619> whole<00:01:25.710> bunch<00:01:25.770> of

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
not going to do a whole bunch of

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.890 
not going to do a whole bunch of
adapters<00:01:26.610> in<00:01:26.640> it<00:01:26.880> it's<00:01:27.060> also<00:01:27.270> got<00:01:27.509> got

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
adapters in it it's also got got

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.929 
adapters in it it's also got got
wide-eyed<00:01:28.380> built<00:01:28.770> into<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.310> actual<00:01:29.579> product

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
wide-eyed built into the actual product

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.510 
wide-eyed built into the actual product
so<00:01:30.030> you<00:01:30.090> can<00:01:30.329> wirelessly<00:01:30.979> project<00:01:31.979> what's<00:01:32.369> on

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
so you can wirelessly project what's on

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.399 
so you can wirelessly project what's on
your<00:01:32.549> screen<00:01:33.000> to<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.240> compatible<00:01:33.780> television

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
your screen to a compatible television

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.899 
your screen to a compatible television
as<00:01:34.530> well<00:01:34.560> so<00:01:35.040> that's<00:01:35.189> really<00:01:35.340> quite<00:01:35.549> clever

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
as well so that's really quite clever

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.850 
as well so that's really quite clever
