00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:12.920
 What is this? 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.920
 come on 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:20.490
 hello girls today I'm going to teach you 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.710
 how to make a hair tie i taught 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.600
 that bow in the ponytail 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.000
 today I'm going to teach a tie using everything 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.070
 hair super leno so let's go 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.830
 learn the first thing you have 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.690
 that make a ponytail high with 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.910
 the help of the pent you are putting the 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.430
 hair up and that's a lot 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.050
 important for the bond to appear but 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.640
 it goes when you look at it 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.410
 will stay in the back of your head 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.140
 and no one sees 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.020
 now you fasten like 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:53.190
 color of your hair gives about three laps 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:55.920
 depends on the volume and on the third turn 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:01:04.680
 more or less so you leave this 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:09.470
 party up so well done it 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.470
 straighten her hair from the back 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.060
 sprinkle a little water 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:24.299
 I tried it like that and if you want 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:26.460
 put some gel on the hair do 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:33.780
 with damp hair is cool 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:36.950
 now you go in the middle and open so looks 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:40.650
 It looks like a tie 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:44.360
 now let's do the middle of the good tie 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:52.049
 You take that part that's left behind. 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:59.299
 separates a small wick and divides 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:59.299
 in two parts to make the middle of the loop 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:07.920
 you carefully divide to stay 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:13.360
 very well, pass on to the front 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:15.790
 so to the side and on 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:19.860
 the color of your hair are you going to make 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.860
 Same thing on the other side 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.800
 I learned with grampinho to be well. 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.800
 firm 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:41.830
 Now you get another mechinha. 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:46.150
 passes forward to the side and 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:51.670
 with the big I have as you did 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:55.090
 on the other side and our super cute home 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:58.900
 super cute is almost ready 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:00.970
 now the details - you fix 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.250
 and so to be well formatted 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.260
 set very handsome 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:09.540
 Look how beautiful, this is one of mine. 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:12.730
 favorite hairstyles holds a grapinho 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.600
 in each dot and the loop to stay 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.730
 firm 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:19.150
 if you're going to be spending enough time outside 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:22.080
 home you can put spray to fix 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.080
 enough 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:30.610
 so now just tuck the back 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:33.010
 because I could have embedded it by 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.330
 within each part of me there of each 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.880
 side of the bow 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:39.400
 but I found it more beautiful to leave the party 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.650
 from behind as if it were the ends of the tie 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:46.750
 I thought it was pretty cool. 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:48.640
 so let's go to the end of it 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:52.330
 part that is left over will you divide 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:55.769
 half sprinkle some water or place 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:04:01.030
 gel or hair spray if you would like 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:04.060
 so and with the help of a comb you do 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:06.070
 a cachinho and it looks like it 's the 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.709
 lace tips I think it stays long 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:11.920
 It's beautiful, but if you prefer, too. 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:15.340
 You can take these dots and inlay them. 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:17.200
 there inside so there is to your 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.250
 The criterion you use the way you 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.019
 to prefer 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:23.710
 this is a hairstyle you can use 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:26.410
 for school shopping party and a super 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:28.840
 option to celebrate the day of the child 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:31.840
 this very special date is coming 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.700
 with mega fashion hair I hope 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.740
