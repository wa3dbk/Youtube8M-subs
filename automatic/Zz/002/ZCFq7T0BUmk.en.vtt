00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
really use his wheels up some have

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.010 
really use his wheels up some have
plunges<00:01:12.960> down<00:01:13.110> some<00:01:13.380> more<00:01:14.299> luckily<00:01:15.299> you<00:01:15.990> can

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
plunges down some more luckily you can

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.240 
plunges down some more luckily you can
also<00:01:16.320> do<00:01:16.680> some<00:01:16.920> core<00:01:17.159> scale<00:01:17.990> these<00:01:18.990> are<00:01:19.140> the

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
also do some core scale these are the

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.800 
also do some core scale these are the
language<00:01:20.250> just<00:01:20.580> about<00:01:20.790> fits<00:01:21.060> nicely<00:01:21.299> onto<00:01:21.659> the

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
language just about fits nicely onto the

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:28.070 
language just about fits nicely onto the
double-o<00:01:22.110> track<00:01:23.450> and<00:01:25.700> hopefully<00:01:26.960> and<00:01:27.960> this

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
double-o track and hopefully and this

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.660 
double-o track and hopefully and this
short<00:01:28.290> bit<00:01:28.500> of<00:01:28.590> film<00:01:28.799> now<00:01:28.979> you'll<00:01:29.369> be<00:01:29.460> able<00:01:29.549> to

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
short bit of film now you'll be able to

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.350 
short bit of film now you'll be able to
see<00:01:30.799> it<00:01:31.799> will<00:01:32.070> straight<00:01:32.400> down<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.790> slope<00:01:33.030> off

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
see it will straight down the slope off

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.109 
see it will straight down the slope off
the<00:01:33.869> end<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.320> put<00:01:34.590> it<00:01:34.680> back<00:01:34.770> on<00:01:34.890> again<00:01:35.040> this<00:01:35.970> is

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
the end and put it back on again this is
