00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
differentiate that a little bit later

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.610

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
cloak I'm doing this clotted red triad

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.330 
cloak I'm doing this clotted red triad
so<00:01:36.990> that's<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.350> blood<00:01:37.560> stained<00:01:37.829> red<00:01:38.100> base

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
so that's the blood stained red base

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.330 
so that's the blood stained red base
there<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:39.470> there<00:01:40.470> I<00:01:40.500> am<00:01:40.710> working<00:01:40.979> up<00:01:41.189> the

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
there and there I am working up the

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.399 
there and there I am working up the
colors<00:01:41.640> so<00:01:41.909> there's<00:01:42.119> clotted<00:01:42.869> red<00:01:43.049> on<00:01:43.200> there

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
colors so there's clotted red on there

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.060 
colors so there's clotted red on there
and<00:01:43.939> actually<00:01:44.939> I<00:01:45.090> was<00:01:45.180> probably<00:01:45.329> all<00:01:45.479> three

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
and actually I was probably all three

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.889 
and actually I was probably all three
okay<00:01:47.070> so<00:01:47.130> now<00:01:47.369> I'm<00:01:47.549> working<00:01:47.729> on<00:01:47.939> here<00:01:48.329> so<00:01:48.750> this

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
okay so now I'm working on here so this

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.850 
okay so now I'm working on here so this
is<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.200> bright<00:01:49.920> shadow<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.759> bright<00:01:51.030> skin

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
is the bright shadow and bright skin

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.800 
is the bright shadow and bright skin
it's<00:01:52.860> kind<00:01:53.100> of<00:01:53.159> an<00:01:53.280> orange<00:01:53.610> II<00:01:53.970> skin<00:01:54.299> tone<00:01:54.570> and

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
it's kind of an orange II skin tone and

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.569 
it's kind of an orange II skin tone and
I<00:01:55.649> thought<00:01:55.829> that<00:01:56.009> would<00:01:56.070> look<00:01:56.130> kind<00:01:56.460> of

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
I thought that would look kind of

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.380 
I thought that would look kind of
different<00:01:57.299> on<00:01:57.390> this<00:01:58.110> guy<00:01:58.939> so<00:01:59.939> you<00:02:00.030> can<00:02:00.119> see<00:02:00.240> how

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
different on this guy so you can see how

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.060 
different on this guy so you can see how
that<00:02:00.540> goes<00:02:00.810> and<00:02:01.020> I've<00:02:01.320> kind<00:02:01.590> of<00:02:01.680> layered<00:02:01.890> in

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
that goes and I've kind of layered in

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.340 
that goes and I've kind of layered in
some<00:02:02.310> red<00:02:03.030> washes<00:02:03.540> in<00:02:03.659> there<00:02:03.780> to<00:02:03.899> try<00:02:04.049> to<00:02:04.079> get<00:02:04.290> a

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
some red washes in there to try to get a

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.959 
some red washes in there to try to get a
bit<00:02:04.590> more<00:02:04.790> differentiation

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
bit more differentiation

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.809 
bit more differentiation

for for blonde hair as well I find that
it<00:02:45.870> works<00:02:46.040> decent<00:02:47.040> so<00:02:47.370> there's<00:02:47.549> a<00:02:47.669> the<00:02:48.180> base

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:48.359 
it works decent so there's a the base

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
to go all the way up to white at least

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:28.699 
to go all the way up to white at least
that's<00:03:26.010> what<00:03:26.159> I<00:03:26.250> find<00:03:27.139> and<00:03:28.139> I'm<00:03:28.290> using<00:03:28.470> a<00:03:28.590> bit

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
that's what I find and I'm using a bit

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:29.929 
that's what I find and I'm using a bit
of<00:03:28.769> those<00:03:28.859> degrees<00:03:28.979> to<00:03:29.370> highlight<00:03:29.669> some<00:03:29.909> of

00:03:29.929 --> 00:03:29.939 
of those degrees to highlight some of

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:33.770 
of those degrees to highlight some of
the<00:03:30.090> the<00:03:30.540> black<00:03:30.780> areas<00:03:31.199> as<00:03:31.349> well<00:03:32.689> there<00:03:33.689> you

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
the the black areas as well there you

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.659 
the the black areas as well there you
can<00:03:33.870> see<00:03:33.989> the<00:03:34.109> blond<00:03:34.379> hair<00:03:34.709> kind<00:03:35.280> of<00:03:35.340> coming

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:35.669 
can see the blond hair kind of coming

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:38.179 
can see the blond hair kind of coming
through<00:03:35.879> a<00:03:35.909> bit<00:03:36.150> and<00:03:36.599> that's<00:03:37.199> the<00:03:37.379> same<00:03:37.620> colors

00:03:38.179 --> 00:03:38.189 
through a bit and that's the same colors

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:40.939 
through a bit and that's the same colors
and<00:03:38.459> I<00:03:38.579> used<00:03:38.819> those<00:03:39.120> as<00:03:39.540> well<00:03:39.720> on<00:03:40.379> these<00:03:40.709> edges

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:40.949 
and I used those as well on these edges

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:42.920 
and I used those as well on these edges
here<00:03:41.549> just<00:03:41.939> kind<00:03:42.120> of<00:03:42.180> giving<00:03:42.449> it<00:03:42.569> a<00:03:42.599> bit<00:03:42.750> of<00:03:42.840> a

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
here just kind of giving it a bit of a

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.330 
here just kind of giving it a bit of a
gold<00:03:43.470> pseudo<00:03:43.859> gold<00:03:44.189> gold<00:03:44.729> look<00:03:46.069> and<00:03:47.069> there's

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
gold pseudo gold gold look and there's

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:48.589 
gold pseudo gold gold look and there's
that<00:03:47.609> I<00:03:47.759> think<00:03:47.939> that's<00:03:48.090> the<00:03:48.209> lightest<00:03:48.540> color

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:48.599 
that I think that's the lightest color

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:52.129 
that I think that's the lightest color
on<00:03:48.930> there<00:03:49.139> now<00:03:49.319> okay<00:03:50.419> so<00:03:51.419> now<00:03:51.659> I'm<00:03:51.750> working<00:03:51.900> on

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:52.139 
on there now okay so now I'm working on

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:55.099 
on there now okay so now I'm working on
the<00:03:52.319> power<00:03:52.530> sword<00:03:52.919> here<00:03:53.189> and<00:03:53.479> so<00:03:54.479> Meridian

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:55.109 
the power sword here and so Meridian

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:56.330 
the power sword here and so Meridian
blue<00:03:55.259> is<00:03:55.439> the<00:03:55.560> base<00:03:55.709> and<00:03:55.949> then<00:03:56.069> I'm<00:03:56.159> just<00:03:56.250> using

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
blue is the base and then I'm just using

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.929 
blue is the base and then I'm just using
these<00:03:56.879> blues<00:03:57.239> from<00:03:57.449> Reaper<00:03:57.959> and<00:03:58.430> this<00:03:59.430> ghost

00:03:59.929 --> 00:03:59.939 
these blues from Reaper and this ghost

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:01.490 
these blues from Reaper and this ghost
white<00:04:00.209> which<00:04:00.389> is<00:04:00.540> just<00:04:00.689> a<00:04:00.780> slight<00:04:01.079> off-white

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
white which is just a slight off-white

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.559 
white which is just a slight off-white
and<00:04:01.769> that'll<00:04:02.129> go<00:04:02.250> in<00:04:02.340> the<00:04:02.400> middle<00:04:02.639> so<00:04:02.819> I'm<00:04:03.299> just

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:03.569 
and that'll go in the middle so I'm just

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:05.300 
and that'll go in the middle so I'm just
building<00:04:03.750> each<00:04:04.109> color<00:04:04.379> up<00:04:04.620> in<00:04:04.799> sort<00:04:05.009> of<00:04:05.069> layers

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
building each color up in sort of layers

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:06.800 
building each color up in sort of layers
and<00:04:05.459> trying<00:04:05.759> to<00:04:05.819> blend<00:04:06.030> it<00:04:06.239> as<00:04:06.359> much<00:04:06.509> as<00:04:06.659> I<00:04:06.750> can
