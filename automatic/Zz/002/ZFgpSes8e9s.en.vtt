now<00:00:01.860> that<00:00:02.100> I've<00:00:02.220> split<00:00:02.520> my<00:00:02.639> hive<00:00:03.060> I<00:00:03.480> don't<00:00:04.200> want

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
now that I've split my hive I don't want

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.540 
now that I've split my hive I don't want
them<00:00:04.620> to<00:00:05.330> swarm<00:00:06.330> I<00:00:06.690> check<00:00:07.589> aborted<00:00:08.069> the<00:00:08.340> hive

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
them to swarm I check aborted the hive

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.180 
them to swarm I check aborted the hive
and<00:00:08.880> gave<00:00:09.540> them<00:00:09.719> twice<00:00:09.990> as<00:00:10.200> much<00:00:10.380> room<00:00:10.830> to<00:00:11.070> lay

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
and gave them twice as much room to lay

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.060 
and gave them twice as much room to lay
eggs<00:00:11.400> and<00:00:11.730> store<00:00:12.420> honey<00:00:12.630> I've<00:00:13.530> been<00:00:13.590> giving

them<00:00:14.219> sugar<00:00:14.460> water<00:00:14.730> for<00:00:15.059> the<00:00:15.120> last<00:00:15.179> several

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
them sugar water for the last several

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.050 
them sugar water for the last several
weeks<00:00:15.990> I<00:00:16.289> think<00:00:16.980> we're<00:00:17.070> probably<00:00:17.190> 10<00:00:17.580> to<00:00:17.699> 14

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.139 
sugar and to keep them still active I'm
going<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:33.140> remove<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.700> feeders<00:00:35.700> from<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:35.969> top

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
going to remove the feeders from the top

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.330 
going to remove the feeders from the top
the<00:00:36.329> hives<00:00:36.570> stop<00:00:37.380> giving<00:00:37.710> them<00:00:37.800> sugar<00:00:38.040> water

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
the hives stop giving them sugar water

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.030 
the hives stop giving them sugar water
I'm<00:00:39.180> going<00:00:39.329> to<00:00:39.420> scratch<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:40.050> honeycomb<00:00:40.860> that

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
I'm going to scratch the honeycomb that

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.310 
I'm going to scratch the honeycomb that
has<00:00:41.219> stored<00:00:41.760> honey<00:00:41.969> in<00:00:42.120> it<00:00:42.180> now<00:00:42.390> which<00:00:43.170> will

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
has stored honey in it now which will

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.170 
has stored honey in it now which will
keep<00:00:43.440> them<00:00:43.620> busy<00:00:43.680> moving<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.789> honey<00:00:45.000> around

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
keep them busy moving the honey around

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.729 
keep them busy moving the honey around
in<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.780> hive<00:00:45.989> which<00:00:46.320> will<00:00:46.469> keep<00:00:46.590> them

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
in the hive which will keep them

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.920 
in the hive which will keep them
stimulated<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.550> I'm<00:00:48.180> going<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.329> put<00:00:48.510> on<00:00:48.629> a<00:00:48.660> new

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
stimulated and I'm going to put on a new

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.520 
stimulated and I'm going to put on a new
super<00:00:49.730> just<00:00:50.730> in<00:00:50.850> case<00:00:51.110> just<00:00:52.110> so<00:00:52.260> they<00:00:52.379> have

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
super just in case just so they have

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.100 
super just in case just so they have
additional<00:00:52.800> room<00:00:53.539> so<00:00:54.539> when<00:00:54.690> they<00:00:54.809> start

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
additional room so when they start

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.950 
additional room so when they start
storing<00:00:55.530> honey<00:00:55.710> from<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.340> nectar<00:00:56.699> from<00:00:56.850> the

storing honey from the nectar from the
blooming<00:00:57.960> plants<00:00:58.440> that<00:00:58.770> they'll<00:00:58.980> have<00:00:59.160> plenty

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
blooming plants that they'll have plenty

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.790 
blooming plants that they'll have plenty
of<00:00:59.489> room<00:00:59.699> so<00:01:00.690> I'm<00:01:00.780> getting<00:01:00.960> my<00:01:01.170> boxes<00:01:01.620> out<00:01:01.770> of

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
of room so I'm getting my boxes out of

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.490 
of room so I'm getting my boxes out of
storage<00:01:02.250> I<00:01:02.579> keep<00:01:03.090> my<00:01:03.210> boxes<00:01:03.690> in<00:01:03.840> bags<00:01:04.110> and

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
storage I keep my boxes in bags and

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.480 
storage I keep my boxes in bags and
inside<00:01:05.400> these<00:01:05.630> garbage<00:01:06.630> bags<00:01:06.900> I<00:01:07.260> put<00:01:08.159> some

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
inside these garbage bags I put some

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.359 
inside these garbage bags I put some
moth<00:01:09.390> crystals<00:01:09.750> in<00:01:10.320> it<00:01:10.350> this<00:01:10.860> is<00:01:11.040> important

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
moth crystals in it this is important

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.010 
moth crystals in it this is important
you<00:01:11.430> get<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.640> right<00:01:11.820> kind<00:01:12.119> so<00:01:12.510> look<00:01:12.750> for<00:01:12.900> this

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
you get the right kind so look for this

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.530 
you get the right kind so look for this
kind<00:01:13.260> of<00:01:13.320> blue<00:01:13.530> can<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:14.159> I'll<00:01:14.939> take<00:01:15.180> some<00:01:15.330> moth

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
kind of blue can and I'll take some moth

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.890 
kind of blue can and I'll take some moth
crystals<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.979> sandwich<00:01:17.700> bag<00:01:18.000> punch<00:01:18.780> a

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
crystals and a sandwich bag punch a

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.359 
crystals and a sandwich bag punch a
bunch<00:01:19.110> of<00:01:19.200> holes<00:01:19.409> in<00:01:19.530> it<00:01:19.650> with<00:01:19.799> a<00:01:19.830> fork<00:01:20.189> or

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
bunch of holes in it with a fork or

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.399 
bunch of holes in it with a fork or
knife<00:01:20.400> and<00:01:20.939> then<00:01:21.450> we<00:01:21.509> just<00:01:21.689> put<00:01:21.810> some<00:01:21.960> crystals

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
knife and then we just put some crystals

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.670 
knife and then we just put some crystals
in<00:01:22.580> this<00:01:23.580> is<00:01:23.729> what<00:01:23.909> is<00:01:24.060> leftover<00:01:24.509> from<00:01:24.689> being<00:01:25.590> a

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
in this is what is leftover from being a

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.070 
in this is what is leftover from being a
storage<00:01:26.040> for<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.369> winter<00:01:26.640> so<00:01:27.540> that<00:01:27.720> keeps<00:01:27.930> the

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
storage for the winter so that keeps the

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.030 
storage for the winter so that keeps the
moths<00:01:28.380> out<00:01:29.130> from<00:01:29.670> getting<00:01:30.060> inside<00:01:30.210> my<00:01:31.040> frames

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
moths out from getting inside my frames

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.270 
moths out from getting inside my frames
and<00:01:32.400> destroying<00:01:32.869> the<00:01:33.869> wax<00:01:34.110> while<00:01:34.560> they're<00:01:34.799> in

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
and destroying the wax while they're in

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.880 
and destroying the wax while they're in
storage<00:01:35.820> so<00:01:36.750> these<00:01:36.960> are<00:01:37.140> already<00:01:37.290> polled

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
storage so these are already polled

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.929 
storage so these are already polled
so<00:01:38.670> I'll<00:01:38.729> give<00:01:38.909> these<00:01:39.360> a<00:01:39.390> nice<00:01:39.689> head<00:01:39.930> start<00:01:39.960> and

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:40.939 
so I'll give these a nice head start and

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:43.670 
so I'll give these a nice head start and
storing<00:01:41.939> honey<00:01:42.210> when<00:01:43.079> they<00:01:43.170> get<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.409> nectar

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
storing honey when they get the nectar

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.969 
storing honey when they get the nectar
from<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.360> blossoming<00:01:45.360> plants<00:01:45.810> so<00:01:46.530> let's<00:01:46.860> get

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
from the blossoming plants so let's get

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.359 
from the blossoming plants so let's get
in<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.130> hive<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:47.549> start<00:01:47.850> doing<00:01:48.060> some<00:01:48.210> work

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
in the hive and start doing some work

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:52.789 
in the hive and start doing some work

hive there are some bees in here so I'm

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.990 
hive there are some bees in here so I'm
just<00:01:55.500> going<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:55.770> take<00:01:55.979> this<00:01:56.130> feeder<00:01:56.399> off<00:01:56.640> and

out naturally here's an example of a

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.660 
out naturally here's an example of a
frame<00:02:02.850> that<00:02:03.119> I'm<00:02:03.240> going<00:02:03.420> to<00:02:03.509> scratch<00:02:04.340> so<00:02:05.340> that

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
frame that I'm going to scratch so that

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.809 
frame that I'm going to scratch so that
they'll<00:02:06.560> still<00:02:07.560> be<00:02:07.590> stimulated<00:02:08.369> by<00:02:08.550> moving

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
they'll still be stimulated by moving

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.660 
they'll still be stimulated by moving
honey<00:02:09.390> around<00:02:09.599> but<00:02:10.530> I<00:02:10.739> won't<00:02:10.920> be<00:02:11.069> giving<00:02:11.520> them

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
honey around but I won't be giving them

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
cells to do this I'm simply going to use

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.950

kitchen and that's what I'll be using to

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.500 
kitchen and that's what I'll be using to
scratch<00:02:40.410> these<00:02:40.680> and<00:02:40.950> the<00:02:41.610> bees<00:02:41.820> will<00:02:42.090> come<00:02:42.300> by

and<00:02:43.080> not<00:02:43.200> just<00:02:43.410> repair<00:02:43.800> the<00:02:44.040> cells<00:02:44.340> but

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
and not just repair the cells but

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.550 
and not just repair the cells but
they'll<00:02:45.210> move<00:02:45.360> the<00:02:45.420> honey<00:02:45.660> around<00:02:46.050> into<00:02:46.530> the

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
they'll move the honey around into the

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.860 
they'll move the honey around into the
new<00:02:46.860> frames<00:02:47.640> that<00:02:47.910> I'm<00:02:48.090> giving<00:02:48.600> them<00:02:48.660> at<00:02:48.780> the

same time here I've just scratched the

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:54.500 
same time here I've just scratched the
comb<00:02:51.510> there's<00:02:52.260> the<00:02:52.830> fork<00:02:53.100> I<00:02:53.220> use<00:02:53.490> and<00:02:53.730> now

as you can see I've scratched those
capped<00:03:04.230> cells<00:03:04.590> also<00:03:04.970> you<00:03:05.970> could<00:03:06.120> ask<00:03:06.300> well<00:03:06.600> why

water free I know that some beekeepers

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:22.130 
water free I know that some beekeepers
continue<00:03:20.850> to<00:03:20.940> feed<00:03:21.150> the<00:03:21.330> bees<00:03:21.540> sugar<00:03:21.870> water

year-round and get lots and lots of
honey<00:03:24.690> but<00:03:25.560> really<00:03:25.890> they're<00:03:26.040> just<00:03:26.070> getting

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
honey but really they're just getting

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.340 
honey but really they're just getting
honey<00:03:27.239> made<00:03:27.480> from<00:03:27.690> sugar<00:03:27.900> water

honey made from sugar water
I<00:03:28.380> want<00:03:28.709> my<00:03:28.860> honey<00:03:29.190> made<00:03:29.430> from<00:03:29.730> the<00:03:29.910> nectar<00:03:30.209> and

I want my honey made from the nectar and

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:33.410 
I want my honey made from the nectar and
it's<00:03:31.709> second<00:03:32.100> reason<00:03:32.250> is<00:03:32.489> I<00:03:32.700> never<00:03:32.940> take<00:03:33.209> honey

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
it's second reason is I never take honey

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.350 
it's second reason is I never take honey
