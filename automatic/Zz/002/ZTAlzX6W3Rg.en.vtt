grape flavored one is called grape frost

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:39.100 
grape flavored one is called grape frost
it's<00:01:34.759> sweetened<00:01:35.569> with<00:01:35.780> sucralose<00:01:36.530> so<00:01:38.110> anyways

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
it's sweetened with sucralose so anyways

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:40.779 
it's sweetened with sucralose so anyways
it's<00:01:39.440> the<00:01:39.740> light<00:01:39.950> one<00:01:40.190> there<00:01:40.399> is<00:01:40.490> a<00:01:40.520> another

00:01:40.779 --> 00:01:40.789 
it's the light one there is a another

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:42.370 
it's the light one there is a another
one<00:01:41.240> that<00:01:41.420> isn't<00:01:41.539> the<00:01:41.780> light<00:01:41.929> one<00:01:42.110> and<00:01:42.140> how

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
one that isn't the light one and how

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.800 
one that isn't the light one and how
sugar<00:01:42.679> in<00:01:42.979> it<00:01:43.130> so<00:01:43.429> i<00:01:43.670> bought<00:01:44.240> it<00:01:44.420> i'm<00:01:44.599> going<00:01:44.720> to

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
sugar in it so i bought it i'm going to

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.600 
sugar in it so i bought it i'm going to
try<00:01:45.050> it<00:01:45.170> i<00:01:45.470> thought<00:01:45.709> you<00:01:45.890> know<00:01:45.920> this<00:01:46.369> is<00:01:46.429> a

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
try it i thought you know this is a

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.859 
try it i thought you know this is a
great<00:01:47.440> alternative<00:01:49.090> because<00:01:50.090> we<00:01:50.330> can<00:01:50.509> eat<00:01:50.690> so

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
great alternative because we can eat so

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:52.809 
great alternative because we can eat so
little<00:01:51.050> what<00:01:51.349> I'm<00:01:51.470> finding<00:01:51.740> is<00:01:51.979> that<00:01:52.039> I've

00:01:52.809 --> 00:01:52.819 
little what I'm finding is that I've

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:55.540 
little what I'm finding is that I've
been<00:01:53.060> missing<00:01:53.300> having<00:01:53.860> fruits<00:01:54.860> and<00:01:55.130> veggies

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:55.550 
been missing having fruits and veggies

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.600 
been missing having fruits and veggies
much<00:01:55.789> because<00:01:56.330> I<00:01:56.660> my<00:01:57.500> protein<00:01:57.950> first<00:01:58.220> and<00:01:58.489> then

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
much because I my protein first and then

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.180 
much because I my protein first and then
I'm<00:01:58.729> full<00:01:59.030> so<00:01:59.539> I<00:01:59.840> talked<00:02:00.470> to<00:02:00.590> her<00:02:00.770> a<00:02:00.800> little<00:02:01.009> bit

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 
I'm full so I talked to her a little bit

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.430 
I'm full so I talked to her a little bit
about<00:02:01.489> supplementing<00:02:02.479> my<00:02:02.539> protein<00:02:03.140> with

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
about supplementing my protein with

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.350 
about supplementing my protein with
protein<00:02:04.280> shakes<00:02:04.580> I<00:02:04.700> haven't<00:02:05.030> really<00:02:05.149> been

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
protein shakes I haven't really been

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.680 
protein shakes I haven't really been
doing<00:02:05.420> protein<00:02:06.020> shakes<00:02:06.259> much<00:02:06.500> at<00:02:06.709> all

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
doing protein shakes much at all

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.960 
doing protein shakes much at all
because<00:02:09.560> their<00:02:10.010> goal<00:02:10.250> is<00:02:10.280> for<00:02:10.670> you<00:02:10.700> to<00:02:10.760> get

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
because their goal is for you to get

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.960 
because their goal is for you to get
back<00:02:11.000> to<00:02:11.390> eating<00:02:11.570> regularly<00:02:12.230> but<00:02:12.710> because<00:02:13.220> you

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
back to eating regularly but because you

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.790 
back to eating regularly but because you
have<00:02:14.000> to<00:02:14.360> meet<00:02:14.510> your<00:02:14.690> protein<00:02:15.080> requirements

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
have to meet your protein requirements

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.740 
have to meet your protein requirements
you<00:02:16.520> know<00:02:16.670> so<00:02:16.820> i<00:02:16.880> said<00:02:17.120> is<00:02:17.270> that<00:02:17.450> you<00:02:17.600> know<00:02:17.720> I

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
you know so i said is that you know I

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
you know so i said is that you know I
talked<00:02:18.350> to<00:02:18.440> her<00:02:18.620> about<00:02:18.740> the<00:02:19.010> fact<00:02:19.250> that<00:02:19.400> I<00:02:19.520> was

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
talked to her about the fact that I was

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.010 
talked to her about the fact that I was
going<00:02:21.770> to<00:02:21.890> do<00:02:22.190> I<00:02:22.490> think<00:02:22.850> more<00:02:23.120> protein<00:02:23.690> shakes

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
going to do I think more protein shakes

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.410 
going to do I think more protein shakes
to<00:02:24.470> allow<00:02:24.740> me<00:02:24.950> to<00:02:25.160> do<00:02:25.310> more<00:02:25.490> vegetables<00:02:26.120> and

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
to allow me to do more vegetables and

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.320 
to allow me to do more vegetables and
fruit<00:02:27.230> because<00:02:27.440> I<00:02:27.650> missed<00:02:28.040> that<00:02:28.760> I<00:02:29.000> miss

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
fruit because I missed that I miss

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.470 
fruit because I missed that I miss
having<00:02:29.950> fruits<00:02:30.950> and<00:02:31.160> vegetables<00:02:31.700> as<00:02:31.970> much<00:02:32.300> as

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
having fruits and vegetables as much as

for the six pack I can't remember the
exact<00:03:38.720> price<00:03:38.989> but<00:03:39.290> it<00:03:39.500> was<00:03:39.680> under<00:03:40.040> twenty

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400

dollars<00:03:40.790> and<00:03:41.450> over<00:03:41.810> fifteen<00:03:42.230> i<00:03:42.349> think<00:03:42.530> it<00:03:42.650> was

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
dollars and over fifteen i think it was

between<00:03:44.480> fifteen<00:03:44.930> and<00:03:44.959> twenty<00:03:45.139> dollars

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620
