00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:25.539
 and 

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:31.250
 Now we are in Moscow on bootcamp 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:34.040
 we are preparing for the lan-finals of season 4 which 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.840
 bulgaria Sofia will come she now we 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.490
 finished first in principle was 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.800
 just not enough countries what was 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:42.620
 new format but basically ok 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:45.080
 prepared for the lan final major 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.630
 rivals we will have a club cie dvp 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.730
 but I think that in principle we are ready 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:52.930
 ok and hopefully take first place 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.930
 count on 1 place 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.640
 preparation for the finals with us as always 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.880
 passes major this we come to 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:12.100
 bootcamp in Moscow we train hard 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.470
 for about a week this time it 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.770
 we have 5 full days not counting the arrivals 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.570
 counties agree with the teams we have 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.720
 get on the door of a workout a day 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.520
 about three hours probably in total 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.610
 plus another separate to the new rejected 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:30.159
 workouts training random we have the amount 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.560
 probably about 10 12 o'clock out 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:35.200
 day and it is the games that are in these five days 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.420
 we are going to prepare the maximum 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.940
 pick up the form and after that 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:43.060
 go to the finals sofia i will tell you 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:46.060
 about the new format 74 which led from this 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:48.610
 season main plus 100 format in volume 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.970
 what appeared for the base and appeared mode 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:54.640
 attack protection due to which 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.610
 impossible to start for it will add 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:00.010
 much more not on the dynamics in battles 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:03.430
 there were problems with two more players 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:05.770
 because the role of the t-10 format is no longer 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:08.590
 need all the players play on the tanks because 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:11.440
 this many teams broke up 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.900
 new strong teams like 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:17.440
 team us with entering the series which 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:22.780
 now takes from 4 russian golden lady 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:24.790
 but many European League teams 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:29.890
 pulled on level 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:31.570
 our team 3 format is quite cheerfully in 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.360
 this format is much more solve the fight 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:36.310
 than so now with this with this appeared 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.730
 slight difficulties on shelter with this 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.730
 cope
