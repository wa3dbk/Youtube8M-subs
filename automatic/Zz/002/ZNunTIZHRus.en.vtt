00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.900 
to be kind of light with it it vibrates
so<00:02:05.790> you<00:02:05.850> just<00:02:06.180> turn<00:02:06.479> this<00:02:06.660> button<00:02:07.020> on<00:02:07.820> and<00:02:08.820> I

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
so you just turn this button on and I

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.030 
so you just turn this button on and I
thought<00:02:09.149> it<00:02:09.270> was<00:02:09.330> easier<00:02:09.780> to<00:02:09.990> work<00:02:10.170> in<00:02:10.440> section

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.040 
thought it was easier to work in section

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.440 
thought it was easier to work in section
and<00:02:11.900> I<00:02:12.900> didn't<00:02:13.170> spend<00:02:13.470> more<00:02:13.740> than<00:02:13.970> 15<00:02:14.970> seconds

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
and I didn't spend more than 15 seconds

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.199 
and I didn't spend more than 15 seconds
on<00:02:15.660> each<00:02:16.140> section<00:02:17.100> I<00:02:17.370> think<00:02:17.820> this<00:02:18.000> will

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
on each section I think this will

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.150 
on each section I think this will
probably<00:02:18.510> do<00:02:18.720> a<00:02:18.750> better<00:02:18.810> job<00:02:19.080> than<00:02:19.560> our<00:02:19.830> hands

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
probably do a better job than our hands

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.590 
probably do a better job than our hands
can<00:02:20.400> do<00:02:20.490> I<00:02:20.520> mean<00:02:20.670> you<00:02:20.760> can<00:02:20.940> still<00:02:21.120> do<00:02:21.300> the<00:02:21.420> same

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
can do I mean you can still do the same

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.000 
can do I mean you can still do the same
thing<00:02:21.780> with<00:02:21.900> your<00:02:22.080> hands<00:02:22.350> massaging<00:02:22.830> your

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
thing with your hands massaging your

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.770 
thing with your hands massaging your
scalp<00:02:23.070> I<00:02:23.490> thought<00:02:24.030> this<00:02:24.209> is<00:02:24.360> really<00:02:24.390> good

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
scalp I thought this is really good

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.340 
scalp I thought this is really good
because<00:02:24.930> you<00:02:25.800> can<00:02:25.920> see<00:02:26.040> the<00:02:26.190> vibration<00:02:26.790> speed

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
because you can see the vibration speed

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.750 
because you can see the vibration speed
it's<00:02:28.350> a<00:02:28.500> little<00:02:28.620> more<00:02:28.830> faster<00:02:29.220> than<00:02:29.400> what<00:02:29.580> you

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
it's a little more faster than what you

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.400 
it's a little more faster than what you
know<00:02:29.910> we<00:02:30.240> would<00:02:30.360> be<00:02:30.480> doing<00:02:30.630> with<00:02:30.810> their<00:02:30.930> hands

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
know we would be doing with their hands

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.620 
know we would be doing with their hands
yes<00:02:31.590> got<00:02:31.830> it<00:02:31.860> I've<00:02:32.070> been<00:02:32.220> able<00:02:32.310> to<00:02:32.490> use<00:02:32.760> this<00:02:33.090> in
