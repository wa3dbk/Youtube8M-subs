started on the 17th of november when

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.519 
started on the 17th of november when
andreas<00:00:16.650> sent<00:00:17.160> me<00:00:17.310> an<00:00:17.369> email<00:00:17.930> and<00:00:18.930> you<00:00:19.050> can<00:00:19.289> see

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
andreas sent me an email and you can see

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.960 
andreas sent me an email and you can see
this<00:00:19.590> email<00:00:20.550> he<00:00:20.850> asked<00:00:21.180> me<00:00:21.330> to<00:00:21.600> make<00:00:22.140> a

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:22.970 
this email he asked me to make a

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.779 
this email he asked me to make a
tetrahedron<00:00:23.970> turns<00:00:24.390> like<00:00:24.630> soft<00:00:25.019> cube<00:00:25.789> you're

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
tetrahedron turns like soft cube you're

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.849 
tetrahedron turns like soft cube you're
hearing<00:00:27.210> my<00:00:27.420> love<00:00:27.930> birds<00:00:28.199> at<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.410> background

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
hearing my love birds at the background

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:34.100 
hearing my love birds at the background
so<00:00:29.640> what<00:00:29.820> I<00:00:29.849> did<00:00:30.000> is<00:00:30.570> I<00:00:31.340> drew<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:33.090> 3d<00:00:33.690> design

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
so what I did is I drew the 3d design

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:41.600 
so what I did is I drew the 3d design
which<00:00:34.710> you<00:00:34.860> can<00:00:35.070> see<00:00:35.309> her<00:00:38.000> and<00:00:40.129> I<00:00:41.129> so<00:00:41.370> slow

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
which you can see her and I so slow

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.490 
which you can see her and I so slow
that's<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.149> 3d<00:00:42.780> design<00:00:43.140> -<00:00:44.010> Shh<00:00:44.640> so<00:00:45.539> this<00:00:46.289> is

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
that's the 3d design - Shh so this is

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.190 
that's the 3d design - Shh so this is
the<00:00:47.010> functionality<00:00:47.460> of<00:00:47.730> softened<00:00:48.390> tetra<00:00:48.899> it

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
the functionality of softened tetra it

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.529 
the functionality of softened tetra it
has<00:00:49.440> is<00:00:49.680> an<00:00:49.860> edge<00:00:50.039> term<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:50.460> tetrahedron<00:00:51.059> and

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
has is an edge term and tetrahedron and

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.290 
has is an edge term and tetrahedron and
these<00:00:52.140> are<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.440> pieces<00:00:52.620> so<00:00:53.579> I<00:00:53.610> ordered<00:00:54.149> them

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
these are the pieces so I ordered them

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.619 
these are the pieces so I ordered them
from<00:00:54.629> shape<00:00:54.930> face<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.500> then<00:00:55.649> I<00:00:55.739> had<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:56.010> wake

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:03.650 

after<00:01:00.629> two<00:01:01.289> weeks<00:01:01.440> I<00:01:01.800> wish<00:01:02.340> his<00:01:02.550> parcel<00:01:03.210> from

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
after two weeks I wish his parcel from

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.770 
after two weeks I wish his parcel from
shake<00:01:03.960> place<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.530> let's<00:01:05.369> check<00:01:06.060> out<00:01:06.210> what's

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
shake place and let's check out what's

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.370 
shake place and let's check out what's
inside<00:01:07.140> this<00:01:07.260> parcel

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.490 

and<00:01:11.380> this<00:01:11.590> is<00:01:11.770> what<00:01:12.370> we<00:01:12.520> were<00:01:12.610> looking<00:01:12.910> for

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
and this is what we were looking for

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.130 
and this is what we were looking for
these<00:01:14.500> are<00:01:14.710> the<00:01:15.010> parts<00:01:15.580> of<00:01:15.700> the<00:01:15.880> half<00:01:16.090> turn<00:01:16.420> the

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
these are the parts of the half turn the

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:26.600 
these are the parts of the half turn the
track

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.500 

the<00:01:27.610> core<00:01:28.290> some<00:01:29.290> corners<00:01:29.790> some<00:01:30.790> edges<00:01:31.210> and

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:31.510 
the core some corners some edges and

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:32.609 
the core some corners some edges and
some<00:01:31.900> other<00:01:32.020> parts

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:32.619 
some other parts

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:35.910 
some other parts
I've<00:01:33.100> now<00:01:33.369> unpacked<00:01:33.909> the<00:01:34.270> pieces<00:01:34.840> and<00:01:35.110> I've

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
I've now unpacked the pieces and I've

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.410 
I've now unpacked the pieces and I've
made<00:01:36.159> the<00:01:36.280> count<00:01:36.490> you<00:01:36.640> can<00:01:36.909> see<00:01:37.119> that<00:01:37.299> the

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
made the count you can see that the

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.320 
made the count you can see that the
number<00:01:37.690> is<00:01:37.810> correct<00:01:38.440> we<00:01:38.890> have<00:01:38.920> one<00:01:39.190> core<00:01:39.490> we

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.330 
number is correct we have one core we

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.450 
number is correct we have one core we
have<00:01:40.450> eight<00:01:40.659> corners<00:01:41.080> we<00:01:41.590> have<00:01:41.680> twelve<00:01:41.979> edges

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
have eight corners we have twelve edges

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.300 
have eight corners we have twelve edges
and<00:01:42.700> we<00:01:43.090> have<00:01:43.180> six<00:01:43.570> centers<00:01:43.990> so<00:01:44.680> now<00:01:44.890> that<00:01:44.950> we

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
and we have six centers so now that we

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.760 
and we have six centers so now that we
know<00:01:45.670> that<00:01:45.700> the<00:01:46.030> number<00:01:46.450> is<00:01:46.570> correct<00:01:46.960> we<00:01:47.619> all

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
know that the number is correct we all

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.719 
know that the number is correct we all
put<00:01:47.979> them<00:01:48.100> in<00:01:48.220> a<00:01:48.250> pot<00:01:48.430> and<00:01:49.500> we<00:01:50.500> add<00:01:50.649> water<00:01:50.950> so

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
put them in a pot and we add water so

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:54.230 
put them in a pot and we add water so
they<00:01:51.909> can<00:01:51.940> soak<00:01:52.509> in<00:01:52.840> water<00:01:53.259> for<00:01:53.409> half<00:01:53.890> an<00:01:54.040> hour

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
they can soak in water for half an hour

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:08.120 
they can soak in water for half an hour
so<00:01:55.240> the<00:01:55.450> black<00:01:55.810> dye<00:01:56.049> will<00:01:56.800> hold<00:01:57.520> so

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.850 

and<00:02:09.130> now<00:02:09.550> the<00:02:09.610> pieces<00:02:10.330> can<00:02:10.660> soak<00:02:11.260> for<00:02:11.560> half<00:02:11.740> an

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
and now the pieces can soak for half an

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:17.690 
and now the pieces can soak for half an
hour

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.580 

somehow<00:02:18.700> the<00:02:18.850> pieces<00:02:19.510> are<00:02:19.720> properly<00:02:20.170> soaked

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
somehow the pieces are properly soaked

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.370 
somehow the pieces are properly soaked
for<00:02:20.950> the<00:02:21.070> dye<00:02:21.490> to<00:02:21.550> halt<00:02:21.970> as<00:02:22.840> you<00:02:23.020> can<00:02:23.170> see<00:02:23.350> I

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
for the dye to halt as you can see I

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.670 
for the dye to halt as you can see I
have<00:02:23.740> added<00:02:24.010> some<00:02:24.610> other<00:02:25.060> pieces<00:02:25.390> that<00:02:26.140> need

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
have added some other pieces that need

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.970 
have added some other pieces that need
to<00:02:26.950> be<00:02:27.070> dyed<00:02:27.280> as<00:02:27.670> well<00:02:27.880> so<00:02:28.630> for<00:02:29.440> efficiency

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
to be dyed as well so for efficiency

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.920 
to be dyed as well so for efficiency
here<00:02:30.400> there<00:02:30.850> are<00:02:30.940> now<00:02:31.090> three<00:02:31.780> different

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
here there are now three different

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.070 
here there are now three different
puzzles<00:02:32.500> in<00:02:32.680> this<00:02:33.130> panel<00:02:33.400> so<00:02:34.270> let's<00:02:34.480> get<00:02:34.870> the

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
puzzles in this panel so let's get the

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:55.490 
puzzles in this panel so let's get the
cold<00:02:35.950> water<00:02:49.020> and<00:02:50.670> here<00:02:51.670> we<00:02:51.760> go<00:02:51.910> to<00:02:51.940> the<00:02:52.210> stove

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:11.940 

I'm<00:02:56.500> entering<00:02:57.720> pieces<00:03:01.260> some<00:03:02.260> hot<00:03:02.440> water

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:17.500 

and<00:03:13.360> finally<00:03:14.709> Sunday<00:03:15.730> I'm<00:03:16.730> using<00:03:17.090> the<00:03:17.299> brand

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
and finally Sunday I'm using the brand

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.449 
and finally Sunday I'm using the brand
Thailand<00:03:18.110> but<00:03:18.590> I<00:03:18.650> assume<00:03:19.069> that<00:03:19.250> there<00:03:19.400> are

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
Thailand but I assume that there are

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:22.570 
Thailand but I assume that there are
many<00:03:19.670> other<00:03:20.269> brands<00:03:20.690> that<00:03:20.870> work<00:03:21.709> just<00:03:22.010> as<00:03:22.159> well

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580
