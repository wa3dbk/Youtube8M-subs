00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 certain welcome to a new 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.520
 random comments 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.200
 today I will speak to you one of the 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.910
 most recent series of cartoon network 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.040
 released very recently in Latin America 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:14.349
 before clamp also known for its 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.420
 quasi literal translation uncle uncle and 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:18.040
 created by peter brown garden the invías 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.990
 as part of cannes projects 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.690
 constitute the same one that would come out 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.820
 regular show 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:25.590
 the series is about the adventures of 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.570
 great uncle for a magical being that 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.580
 somehow says assertive and grandfather of 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.470
 everyone in the world good part of their 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.940
 episodes consist of him using his 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.920
 powers to help children and not so 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.270
 children with their problems although something 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.620
 remarkable is that despite being of 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.670
 apparently capable of altering the 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.200
 reality at will 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.580
 usually let them be their own 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.950
 children who solve the problems 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:46.470
 by themselves to help you in this 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.420
 task leaves his helpers pieces and 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.710
 a piece of egomaniac and narcissistic pizza 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.450
 that despite being totally 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.610
 obsessed with himself is always 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.930
 willing to help when needed 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.030
 the giant embroidery tigress 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.680
 realistic that as its name says it is 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.629
 an animated photograph of a tiger that 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.210
 is able to fly leaving a trail of 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.010
 rainbow in its path and mysterious a 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.990
 creature similar to godzilla that works 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.130
 like the uncle's bodyguard grampa and 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.750
 that by having more than one 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.490
 million years of age none of the 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.409
 strange things that forlán in the series 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.840
 seems to cause the slightest surprise 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.340
 as you can imagine this set of 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.840
 characters are as a result of a 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.760
 series of adventures that seem to lack 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.890
 of a logical structure focusing 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.420
 mainly in absurd humor the 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.160
 series has received several reviews already 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.930
 please they must agree with that 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.150
 the characters are not very nice 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.040
 usually the basic arguments are not 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.290
 extremely original and sometimes 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.790
 the jokes are somewhat forced clear 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.560
 that the voice of the main character in the 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.020
 Latin dubbing is not very nice 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.550
 does not help much however 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.530
 it seems that the strengths of this series 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.150
 they are much greater than their weaknesses and 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.100
 which makes very interesting use of 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.180
 humor of the classic cartoons and 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.619
 Athough it does not seems 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.210
 the writers manage to give it a touch 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.070
 unique to the episodes with scenes from 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.720
 humor legitimately funny and 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.430
 arguments that occasionally leave you 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.200
 doubtful to say the whole part of the plan 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.479
 the characters or if it just happened to 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.860
 do in my personal opinion really 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.300
 I appreciate the existence of this series 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.340
 within the offer of cartoons 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.960
 for children of today because I 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.119
 dare to say that from the cow and the 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.800
 Chick or even more behind with rangers 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.780
 tingui that you did not see a series that 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.150
 based on originality without limitations 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.980
 just as the mind works a child by 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.750
 supposed to be and how to adventure time and in 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.340
 special to fly show have shown 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.750
 an almost unlimited capacity for 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.550
 appreciate some original stories and 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.110
 crazy though I feel 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.330
 great goal for goes much further 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.250
 appealing is a younger audience and 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.420
 that can laugh at situations without 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.310
 enter a more detailed analysis 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.560
 since the series itself does not 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.440
 Worry about that although they can be read 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.030
 messages occasionally now well just 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.190
 Time will tell if this series is capable of 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.390
 endure in time but at least I think 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.430
 who deserves an opportunity 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:48.230
 -I'm reviewing in random and that has been my 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.230
 Comment on this until soon
