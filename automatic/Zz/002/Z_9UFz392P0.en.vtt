00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:08.990
 Why 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:28.529
 we have no briefing here made in 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:28.529

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.340
 18,000 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.070

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.510

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:50.240

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:27.000
 air is overrated but can still 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.340
 Quickly forget about breathing here 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.110

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:38.010
 Air is more, but because it is easy 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:40.100
