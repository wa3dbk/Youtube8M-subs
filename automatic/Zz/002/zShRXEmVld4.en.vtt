00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
less age type of shadow clone that can't

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.679 
less age type of shadow clone that can't
disappear<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.380> once<00:01:19.979> it<00:01:20.310> is<00:01:20.340> duplicated<00:01:21.210> it

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
disappear and once it is duplicated it

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.590 
disappear and once it is duplicated it
generates<00:01:22.229> its<00:01:22.380> own<00:01:22.500> consciousness

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
that's what we saw from that obviously

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.240 
that's what we saw from that obviously
going<00:01:33.390> inside<00:01:33.720> of<00:01:33.869> Orochimaru<00:01:34.079> layer<00:01:34.799> itself

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
going inside of Orochimaru layer itself

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.550
