going to be very bushy on all the way up

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.030 
going to be very bushy on all the way up
and<00:01:24.090> down<00:01:24.180> go<00:01:24.960> ahead<00:01:25.259> and<00:01:25.470> do<00:01:25.560> that<00:01:25.740> sort<00:01:25.950> of

and down go ahead and do that sort of

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.550 
and down go ahead and do that sort of
halfway<00:01:26.460> cut<00:01:26.729> here<00:01:27.119> but<00:01:27.299> what<00:01:27.840> that<00:01:28.049> does<00:01:28.320> if

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
halfway cut here but what that does if

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.340 
halfway cut here but what that does if
you<00:01:28.680> just<00:01:28.860> sort<00:01:29.009> of<00:01:29.070> nip<00:01:29.280> that<00:01:29.310> off<00:01:29.700> is

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
you just sort of nip that off is

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.010 
you just sort of nip that off is
I<00:01:30.380> heard<00:01:30.530> more<00:01:30.920> growth<00:01:31.280> from<00:01:32.060> these<00:01:32.330> side<00:01:32.689> bags

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
I heard more growth from these side bags

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:34.899 
I heard more growth from these side bags
right<00:01:33.650> here<00:01:33.979> so<00:01:34.220> you'll<00:01:34.369> end<00:01:34.549> up<00:01:34.700> with<00:01:34.850> a

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
right here so you'll end up with a

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:37.780 
right here so you'll end up with a
really<00:01:35.299> bushy<00:01:35.540> impact<00:01:36.080> now<00:01:36.770> what<00:01:37.220> I<00:01:37.430> wanted

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790 
really bushy impact now what I wanted

this one's broken so I'll just remove

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.740 
this one's broken so I'll just remove
that<00:02:03.440> now<00:02:04.340> this<00:02:04.550> one<00:02:04.759> is<00:02:05.000> just<00:02:05.149> hanging<00:02:05.509> on<00:02:05.600> the

that now this one is just hanging on the
ground<00:02:05.960> so<00:02:06.500> I'm<00:02:06.619> just<00:02:06.770> grabbing<00:02:07.250> hold<00:02:07.610> of<00:02:07.850> it

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
ground so I'm just grabbing hold of it

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.430 
ground so I'm just grabbing hold of it
and<00:02:08.479> crooning<00:02:09.410> it<00:02:09.649> off<00:02:09.769> entirely<00:02:11.380> now<00:02:12.380> the

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
within a foot or so of the ground is a

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.509 
within a foot or so of the ground is a
good<00:02:17.840> candidate<00:02:18.410> for<00:02:18.470> removing<00:02:19.130> it<00:02:19.250> entirely

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:19.519 
good candidate for removing it entirely

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:21.820 
good candidate for removing it entirely
if<00:02:19.940> you're<00:02:20.090> trying<00:02:20.360> to<00:02:20.450> train<00:02:20.780> to<00:02:21.500> have<00:02:21.650> that

side a little too much so I'm going to

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:55.300 
side a little too much so I'm going to
prune<00:02:45.200> that<00:02:45.230> right<00:02:45.709> off

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
pruning these off and you'll see from

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.370 
pruning these off and you'll see from
the<00:03:02.300> front<00:03:02.500> pretty<00:03:03.500> soon<00:03:04.660> what<00:03:05.660> impact<00:03:06.140> on

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
the front pretty soon what impact on

the front pretty soon what impact on
nothing<00:03:06.740> on<00:03:06.890> the<00:03:07.040> back<00:03:07.190> here

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.920 

I<00:03:13.920> like<00:03:14.460> to<00:03:14.580> sort<00:03:14.790> of<00:03:14.880> clear<00:03:15.180> up<00:03:15.360> the<00:03:15.540> trimmings

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
I like to sort of clear up the trimmings

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.600 
I like to sort of clear up the trimmings
as<00:03:16.050> I<00:03:16.260> go<00:03:16.440> so<00:03:16.470> that<00:03:16.830> you<00:03:16.920> can<00:03:17.070> see<00:03:17.310> what<00:03:17.490> you're

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
as I go so that you can see what you're

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.850 
as I go so that you can see what you're
doing<00:03:17.970> now<00:03:18.660> around<00:03:18.990> this<00:03:19.200> side<00:03:19.470> it's<00:03:19.740> now

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
doing now around this side it's now

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.070 
doing now around this side it's now
looking<00:03:20.250> a<00:03:20.340> little<00:03:20.460> bit<00:03:20.700> off-balance<00:03:20.960> you<00:03:21.960> can

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
looking a little bit off-balance you can

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.960 
looking a little bit off-balance you can
see<00:03:22.230> the<00:03:22.380> difference<00:03:22.800> here's<00:03:23.400> the<00:03:23.580> before<00:03:23.730> and

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
see the difference here's the before and

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.660 
see the difference here's the before and
here's<00:03:24.300> the<00:03:24.810> after<00:03:24.930> and<00:03:25.860> the<00:03:25.980> four<00:03:26.280> is<00:03:26.370> just<00:03:26.580> a

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
here's the after and the four is just a

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.340 
here's the after and the four is just a
lot<00:03:26.820> more<00:03:27.000> congestion<00:03:27.450> the<00:03:27.720> after<00:03:28.050> it's<00:03:28.170> just

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
lot more congestion the after it's just

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:29.930 
lot more congestion the after it's just
a<00:03:28.590> little<00:03:28.860> bit<00:03:29.070> more<00:03:29.250> upright<00:03:29.550> and<00:03:29.700> it

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
a little bit more upright and it

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.190 
a little bit more upright and it
provides<00:03:30.240> a<00:03:30.360> little<00:03:30.450> more<00:03:30.720> room<00:03:30.930> for<00:03:30.990> the

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
provides a little more room for the

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.650 
provides a little more room for the
ground<00:03:31.440> covers<00:03:31.890> and<00:03:32.130> small<00:03:32.940> shrubs<00:03:33.330> that<00:03:33.540> are

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
ground covers and small shrubs that are

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.190 
ground covers and small shrubs that are
in<00:03:33.840> here<00:03:34.110> to<00:03:34.620> really<00:03:34.890> do<00:03:35.130> their<00:03:35.310> thing<00:03:35.640> so<00:03:36.200> this

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
in here to really do their thing so this

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.310 
in here to really do their thing so this
guy<00:03:37.440> I<00:03:38.030> think<00:03:39.030> this<00:03:39.540> one's<00:03:39.780> just<00:03:39.900> coming

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
stem I don't recommend doing that unless

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.140 
stem I don't recommend doing that unless
you<00:04:22.019> really<00:04:22.169> need<00:04:22.410> to<00:04:22.650> if<00:04:22.890> you<00:04:23.370> do<00:04:23.610> prune<00:04:23.940> them

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
you really need to if you do prune them

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.270 
you really need to if you do prune them
to<00:04:24.540> hard<00:04:24.780> wood<00:04:25.110> make<00:04:25.440> sure<00:04:25.590> you<00:04:25.710> do<00:04:25.860> it<00:04:25.980> after

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:28.200 
the last threat of Frost has passed

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.659 
the last threat of Frost has passed
because<00:04:28.860> they<00:04:29.100> are<00:04:29.220> susceptible<00:04:29.520> across<00:04:31.669> so

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:32.669 
because they are susceptible across so

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:34.730 
because they are susceptible across so
this<00:04:32.880> guy<00:04:33.090> hates<00:04:33.600> prune<00:04:33.960> it<00:04:34.080> off<00:04:34.200> because<00:04:34.440> it's
