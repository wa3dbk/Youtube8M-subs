00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.970
 past empty talk and complaints 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.090

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.210
 if you talk wasted remember 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.320
 past complain to other people or 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.779
 support the complaint of other people 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.760
 chatting about the past and empty talk 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.350
 you will never be rich all the time 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.990
 will be at the bottom 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.880
 other people's complaints are killing us and 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.830

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.779

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.940
 dirt she says and who do not look 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.070
 please where do you understand the question here 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.079
 is that if they don't complain 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.550
 they will live and develop when they 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.260
 will complain will not kill you 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.690
 don't kill yourself then what they killed 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.940
 you but if you want to be a bomber 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.620
 because you want to be kind and after 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.090
 this lie in your life nothing 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.010
 it turns out you spend money on 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.049
 drugs and at the same time you die and you 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.670
 no this money 

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:07.950
 keep on being kind but it's kindness 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.130
 yours is actually a death sentence 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:14.040
 for you and the degradation of these people therefore 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.840
 when you start supporting complaints 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.060
 other people so you understand the bumper and 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.689
 always take offense at you if you donâ€™t 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.520
 always complain about bumper 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.420
 take offense because the one who wants 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.030
 develop 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.860
 he asks you what and you tell him 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.360
 what to do but you should never 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.220
 these do not recommend because when you 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.869
 advise recommend you take it away 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.520
 problems at work you can 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:39.600
 give only your opinion 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:43.110
 expressed he wanted wanted wanted not 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.509
 did but when someone comes clearly 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:49.140
 sex you drink it immediately he will feel 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.880
 says and here I want to build a house and you 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.939
 you understand that he doesn't want to build anything 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.399
 he came like to pump energy empty 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.200
 talking what do you advise me 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.270
 build a house always say you know 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.250
 I do not know that you need my eyes there 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.320
 kuna come on guys but my opinion on 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.290
 to build a five-story gray-brown-crimson 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.880
 with small com 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.729
 I would imagine such a spicy self 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.070
 do you want in this plan should immediately take 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.950
 and through humor through some hard 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:17.140
 moments and do so to this chip 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.570
 stopped thinking so because your 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.030
 attitude to himself is his attitude to you 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:23.680
 because when you are 80 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.050
 percent yourself 10 space ten 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.330
 intention and men feel men 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.250
 and women women do not come to you with 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.560
 empty talk does not come to you 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.670
 complaints and who come to me with 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:40.060
 talking about the past because you are not 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:42.760
 do not come under that area where there is 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.370
 mind because when you are alone 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.620
 in mind one hundred percent 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.670
 he is to destroy you creates 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.130
 many thoughtforms 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.840
 these thoughts form and create pull up 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.000
 people with empty talk 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.100
 they also create duality duality 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.050
 creates doubt the doubt begins 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.520
 take your life energy and it's still 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:04.090
 going on here are those empty talk 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:07.030
 the conversation passed and the complaint therefore if 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:10.090
 you just want to be healthy long 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:12.400
 be rich at least at least 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:16.170
 remember and put away the talk of the past 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.170
 empty talk and complaints of other people
