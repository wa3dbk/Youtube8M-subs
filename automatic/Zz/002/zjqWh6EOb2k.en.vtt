early<00:01:11.330> 70s<00:01:11.930> and<00:01:12.200> I<00:01:12.470> did<00:01:12.619> my<00:01:12.770> first<00:01:12.920> steps<00:01:13.250> in

00:01:13.389 --> 00:01:13.399 
early 70s and I did my first steps in

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:15.580 
early 70s and I did my first steps in
former<00:01:13.729> to<00:01:13.909> in<00:01:14.240> Formula<00:01:14.720> One<00:01:14.930> so<00:01:15.350> there<00:01:15.470> was

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
former to in Formula One so there was

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.800 
former to in Formula One so there was
very<00:01:15.800> little<00:01:16.060> race<00:01:17.060> control<00:01:17.360> Billy<00:01:17.630> was

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
very little race control Billy was

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.770 
very little race control Billy was
always<00:01:18.110> there<00:01:18.290> but<00:01:18.440> it<00:01:18.560> was<00:01:18.619> quite<00:01:18.890> run<00:01:19.100> down

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
always there but it was quite run down

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.410 
always there but it was quite run down
that<00:01:20.780> building<00:01:21.409> really<00:01:21.920> has<00:01:22.310> been<00:01:22.670> very<00:01:23.149> very

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
that building really has been very very

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.600 
that building really has been very very

building grayskin shows pretty important

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:55.480 
building grayskin shows pretty important
I<00:01:54.470> mean<00:01:54.619> they<00:01:54.770> do<00:01:54.830> all<00:01:55.039> the<00:01:55.220> stuff<00:01:55.460> that

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
I mean they do all the stuff that

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.370 
I mean they do all the stuff that
matters<00:01:55.909> around<00:01:56.240> left<00:01:56.479> times<00:01:56.780> at<00:01:57.020> all<00:01:57.110> thats

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380

rustling<00:01:57.770> and<00:01:58.310> if<00:01:58.580> my<00:01:58.819> time<00:01:59.119> were<00:01:59.390> certain

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
rustling and if my time were certain

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.660 
rustling and if my time were certain
things<00:01:59.899> I<00:02:00.110> thought<00:02:00.380> that<00:02:00.560> one<00:02:00.739> could<00:02:00.770> do<00:02:01.220> which

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
things I thought that one could do which

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.490 
things I thought that one could do which
were<00:02:01.849> against<00:02:02.119> the<00:02:02.300> rules<00:02:02.539> and<00:02:02.929> I<00:02:03.170> always<00:02:03.410> like

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
were against the rules and I always like

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.529 
were against the rules and I always like
to<00:02:03.679> argue<00:02:04.009> about<00:02:04.250> those<00:02:04.550> sort<00:02:04.819> of<00:02:04.849> things<00:02:04.940> this

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:05.539 
to argue about those sort of things this

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:09.490 
to argue about those sort of things this
good<00:02:05.810> place<00:02:06.020> have<00:02:06.259> an<00:02:06.349> argument<00:02:08.379> it's<00:02:09.379> an

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
good place have an argument it's an

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.650 
good place have an argument it's an
integral<00:02:10.129> part<00:02:10.310> of<00:02:10.700> the<00:02:10.789> Goodwood<00:02:11.420> motor

integral part of the Goodwood motor

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.900 
integral part of the Goodwood motor
circuit<00:02:12.230> and<00:02:12.410> it<00:02:13.010> would<00:02:13.129> be<00:02:13.280> like<00:02:13.459> trophyless

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
circuit and it would be like trophyless
