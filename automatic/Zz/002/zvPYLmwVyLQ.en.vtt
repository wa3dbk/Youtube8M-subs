00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:11.520
 a hi everyone knows and dar k 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:13.199
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.180
 new vacuum and glitch on call 

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:16.859
 of duty black ops 2 in zombie mode on 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.779
 the origins map to achieve 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.550
 sleeves to infinity you will do the 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.499
 two times the break method with this 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.779
 little robot there so it will take first 

00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:26.579
 brought me the robot right in front of you 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.429
 and that you place as you show 

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:31.349
 in the video and it will take that 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.970
 customers in front of you they need you 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.550
 note so I advise you to 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.560
 shift from left to right and very 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.840
 quickly after shifting against the 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.630
 wall all the way to the left for almost 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.460
 stick to the wall and normally it will 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:46.530
 will have noticed and he'll throw you the 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.780
 fat bread and as you will be shifting 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.610
 to the left and ben his gratin goes 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.960
 move ben where you are so he goes 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.270
 to go through all the walls 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.680
 transparencies to catch you and from 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.260
 that he will catch you and bring you back 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.120
 towards him it will take him thierry on his 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.950
 little arm as soon as you see you 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.810
 are at the top of the map and not 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.939
 now he will release you outside 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:07.289
 So the card shaped card 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.090
 you will have a lot of little things to 

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:11.310
 explore but it will still have to do 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.499
 watch out for the barrier bed and for 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.210
 shout sleeves to infinity and ben you 

00:01:13.499 --> 00:01:17.219
 will have to climb on the small wall as 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.799
 you show them in the video is by 

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:22.020
 following and 20 wanted to have to jump on 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.179
 the roof of a house in debris and I 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.159
 think you'll be at the spot the most 

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:28.619
 top of the map actually have a glitch 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.600
 so let's manage a very nice spot and you 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.310
 will have a beautiful view and so me 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.200
 as you say to go there 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.819
 Sunday to infinity and ben you will have 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.429
 just to let you down quickly 

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:39.539
 run in the little corner as I 

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:42.810
 wanted to show in the video 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:45.270
 and as to her see emma the enemies get 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.100
 block all right in front of me so at the 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.049
 passage it will be necessary to pay attention to not 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.069
 too much to shift to the right otherwise 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.840
 you will take one of 

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:54.179
 barriers advises you especially not to 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.979
 not move at all so as you 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:58.679
 10 to make sleeves to infinity 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.029
 you have to either be invincible and have the 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:03.270
 possibility of having ammunition at 

00:02:00.029 --> 00:02:04.920
 infinity but in this group this you 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.179
 do not even need to play so you 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.920
 you just have to leave your console 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:10.890
 on and whenever the big 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.530
 robots will arrive and bath with his big 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.970
 foot he will crush the zombies 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.590
 and that's what will allow you to 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.180
 make sleeves to infinity you 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.090
 will have just when you helped him to 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:24.120
 leave your console on and that's it 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.340
 will be the big robots that will take care of 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.510
 kill the zombies no for my part I 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.060
 think it's really a super 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.260
 audience that I present to you 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.330
 at the cross passage he was found 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.709
 by the avs said official gaming I 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.989
 will put their path description because 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:38.580
 they greatly deserve and not here 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:40.170
 I really hope this little glitch 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.120
 to make sleeves to infinity on 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.530
 the map or origin will have pleased you as 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.450
 I could see it is really hyper 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.220
 well you can pick up the trumps and 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.560
 you do not need to play because the 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.090
 robot will kill the zombies for you 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.830
 we throw before this video you will have liked 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.690

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.280
 green if the video will have helped you or you 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.480
