00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.500
 now in the closing win we're going to talk 

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:14.440
 about melasma that brown spot that 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:17.320
 usually appears on the face 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:19.480
 arm doctor, I said there, I'll put my arm 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.640
 but mainly on the face that appears 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:24.130
 but this is the place for another year at 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.410
 face in the frontal malar region on top 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.660
 of the lips but there is an extra one side 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.619
 against what may happen in the 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.449
 arms 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:33.790
 we always think that the sun is the 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:36.730
 main factor that triggers the 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.469
 melasma there are others also to have 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.210
 The melasma person needs already have a 

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:41.680
 genetic predisposition 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.230
 usually there is a hormonal change 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.440
 which may be due to the use of 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.140
 contraceptive 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.550
 postmenopausal hormone replacement and 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.829
 in pregnancy where hormone levels 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.750
 are higher then it is very common to 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:53.410
 person opens a picture of melasma during 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.739
 this time 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.600
 radiation is now the most common risk 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.460
 important both uv ae and uv b radiation 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.920
 visible light that also comes from 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.629
 then fluorescent light 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.210
 all radiation causes a change 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.710
 in the cell dna to produce a radical 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.150
 that will take both the 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.960
 aging of the skin in terms of production 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.930
 stain 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.940
 men also have melasma is not so 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.550
 common but melasma can affect men 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:21.490
 and less than 10% of the cases in general in them 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.260
 stains are more resistant to healing 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.750
 culture line or is a treatment 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.550
 constant for the rest of the life is short 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.310
 people do not have but we can 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:32.260
 lighten and even make the stain disappear 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.090
 but this person will always have to have 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.920
 particular care when exposing yourself to the 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.050
 sun and remember is always with 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.090
 sunscreen because the dampness it 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:43.030

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:00.490
 of these bleaching agents in the body 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.590

 quietly that it becomes a texture 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:41.989
 super machu this other lab 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.550
 vacation who already comes with sunscreen 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:45.860
 plus it comes with a sunscreen 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.810
 factor 20 it has a texture is a gel 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.180
 which is specific for oily skins with 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.070
 prone to acne and if you were me 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.709
 explaining that it can be used in all 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:57.200
 parts of the body but especially in the 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:59.030
 eyes that is also very safe 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.980
 it is very safe to use in the region of 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.890
 eyes for having this mantecorp complex 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:06.410
 which is the m5 complex that it will act on 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:09.230
 all factors of different degrees of 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:12.050
 melasma and this is a clear and wanted dermis 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:14.959
 that it is all-natural based on 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:17.000
 camomile extracts that do not have 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:19.670
 no act in super insurance composition 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.500
 also with sunscreen factor 18 and 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.480
 People are talking about bleaching 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.280
 important the dermatologist has already spoken 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.100
 this at the beginning of the story use the 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.739
 sunscreen is mainly when the 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.720
 person makes use of bleaching acids 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:35.090
 So what did you separate the one that has the 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.980
 factor without it is a specific filter 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.049
 for those who have stain problems 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.630
 melasma that it will provide a 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:43.670
 much greater protection and in addition it has 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:46.100
 tracker and the only vitamin that is going 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.380
 have an antioxidant function or 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:51.470
 treats skin in addition to protecting against 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:53.390
 the rays of the sun exactly and the cool 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.660
 for those with dark spots and 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:04:00.560
 melasma is to always use after the flow to 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:02.930
 to use a filter also a compact filter 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.859
 with pigmentation to give greater protection 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.420
 the skin 

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:08.450
 if you have separated this one from the episode 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:10.010
 and this is a factor 30 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:11.660
 only that although it has greater 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:13.910
 physical filter concentration it 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:17.380
 protects very well and also gives a 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:17.380
 very good skin coverage 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.450
 I use some of these products that 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:30.550

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:33.100
