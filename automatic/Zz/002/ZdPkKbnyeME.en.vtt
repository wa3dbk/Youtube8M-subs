00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:27.990 
actually am friend to the weapons dealer
so<00:03:25.959> it's<00:03:26.109> all<00:03:26.260> kind<00:03:26.500> of<00:03:26.650> this<00:03:26.799> big<00:03:27.130> web<00:03:27.639> of

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
so it's all kind of this big web of

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.509 
so it's all kind of this big web of
reactive<00:03:28.930> elements<00:03:29.470> that<00:03:29.650> you<00:03:29.950> never

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
reactive elements that you never

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:33.870 
reactive elements that you never
entirely<00:03:31.239> have<00:03:31.660> the<00:03:31.930> whole<00:03:32.109> picture<00:03:32.380> of<00:03:32.650> me<00:03:32.880> ok

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
entirely have the whole picture of me ok

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.120 
entirely have the whole picture of me ok

back to Z she's our handler now she's a

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:37.110 
back to Z she's our handler now she's a
bit<00:03:36.370> more<00:03:36.459> straightforward<00:03:37.090> than

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
bit more straightforward than

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.420

sneaky path that we took with albatros

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.650 
sneaky path that we took with albatros
is<00:03:44.650> still<00:03:44.859> there<00:03:45.160> the<00:03:45.880> Z<00:03:46.030> just<00:03:46.209> doesn't<00:03:46.540> know

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
is still there the Z just doesn't know

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.150 
is still there the Z just doesn't know
about<00:03:46.780> it<00:03:47.049> so<00:03:47.290> she<00:03:47.380> can't<00:03:47.650> they<00:03:47.739> tell<00:03:47.920> us<00:03:48.040> about

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
about it so she can't they tell us about

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.309 
about it so she can't they tell us about
it<00:03:48.310> since<00:03:48.730> i<00:03:48.880> have<00:03:49.000> chosen<00:03:49.180> z<00:03:49.599> is<00:03:49.750> my<00:03:49.930> handler
