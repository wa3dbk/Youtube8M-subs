 partner 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.089
 but what remains to give 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:41.170
 so bowling looks looks a whole color 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.170

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:49.309

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:16.760
 I put myself first 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.610
 here 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.520
 the back is fucking shit but something 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.240
 attracts 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.240
 paisa wood thrown in favor of 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.240
 infants 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.650

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:04.490
 perfect happened here what I said 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.490
 already 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:29.150
 what do you think you're not going to pay what the 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.150
 ramp 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.480
 do not 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:58.870
 worth vale and hollow vale 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.870
 but bad 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.360
 and here you have to go to the gas station 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:06.460
 of companions 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.460
 quiet man to me that does not happen to me 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.810
 and it shows that he does not throw 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.950
 this is the last 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:27.370
 but not 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.340
 to win that could not happen 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:41.760
 see what happens 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.180
 why 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.640
 Thank you 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.640
 we go 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:17.410
 but as you can see it is not slowed down by another 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.410
 thing 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:24.910
 why 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:24.910
 but it can bind one of the two 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:35.110
 or yes 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.199
 son of a bitch 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:41.469
 as vice 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.030
 Oh 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:55.550

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:55.550
