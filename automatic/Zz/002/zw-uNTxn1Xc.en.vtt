you<00:00:42.670> see<00:00:42.910> Walmart<00:00:43.510> are<00:00:43.660> using<00:00:44.020> them<00:00:44.230> to

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:44.410 
you see Walmart are using them to

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.070 
you see Walmart are using them to
identify<00:00:44.850> items<00:00:45.850> of<00:00:46.330> berm

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:47.080

within their store etc and it's

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.500 
within their store etc and it's
basically<00:00:49.870> used<00:00:50.260> as<00:00:50.590> a<00:00:50.770> wireless<00:00:51.190> barcode<00:00:51.670> and

generation handset are being built with
this<00:01:45.450> NFC<00:01:46.450> technology<00:01:46.690> or<00:01:47.290> RFID<00:01:47.799> technology

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580 
this NFC technology or RFID technology

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.740 
this NFC technology or RFID technology
initially<00:01:50.580> someone<00:01:51.120> to<00:01:51.240> take<00:01:51.450> something

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
initially someone to take something

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.710 
initially someone to take something
called<00:01:51.930> mobile<00:01:52.500> payments<00:01:53.190> so<00:01:53.760> the<00:01:54.120> idea<00:01:54.510> is

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
called mobile payments so the idea is

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.310 
called mobile payments so the idea is
just<00:01:55.020> like<00:01:55.830> over<00:01:56.340> here

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320

so<00:03:37.750> this<00:03:38.079> technology<00:03:38.980> is<00:03:39.730> going<00:03:40.120> to<00:03:40.239> be

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
so this technology is going to be

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:43.920 
so this technology is going to be
effectively<00:03:41.739> the<00:03:41.980> next<00:03:42.400> big<00:03:42.930> smartphone

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
effectively the next big smartphone

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.619 
effectively the next big smartphone
innovation<00:03:44.890> what<00:03:45.549> does<00:03:45.730> that<00:03:45.760> mean<00:03:46.180> for<00:03:46.540> the

00:03:46.619 --> 00:03:46.629 
innovation what does that mean for the

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:47.580 
innovation what does that mean for the

well consumerization of IT and there is

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.300 
well consumerization of IT and there is
a<00:03:50.170> big<00:03:50.590> big<00:03:50.920> phrase<00:03:51.280> and<00:03:51.640> a<00:03:51.670> big<00:03:52.150> strategy<00:03:52.720> that

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
a big big phrase and a big strategy that

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.580 
a big big phrase and a big strategy that
Microsoft<00:03:54.900> adopted<00:03:55.900> at<00:03:55.989> the<00:03:56.019> moment<00:03:56.470> is

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
Microsoft adopted at the moment is

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.390 
Microsoft adopted at the moment is
technology<00:03:57.579> that's<00:03:58.090> in<00:03:58.239> the<00:03:58.359> consumer<00:03:58.900> space

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400

percolating<00:04:00.400> down<00:04:00.430> into<00:04:00.970> the<00:04:01.030> enterprise

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:01.329 
percolating down into the enterprise

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:03.030 
percolating down into the enterprise
space<00:04:01.720> we're<00:04:02.049> going<00:04:02.079> to<00:04:02.230> see<00:04:02.379> a<00:04:02.409> lot<00:04:02.590> more<00:04:02.620> of

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
space we're going to see a lot more of

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.710 
space we're going to see a lot more of
that<00:04:03.069> so<00:04:03.519> you<00:04:03.609> need<00:04:03.790> to<00:04:03.909> start<00:04:04.209> thinking<00:04:04.599> about

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
that so you need to start thinking about

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.550 
that so you need to start thinking about
using<00:04:05.379> tags<00:04:06.370> like<00:04:06.639> this<00:04:07.000> to<00:04:07.629> identify<00:04:08.379> items

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
using tags like this to identify items

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.099 
using tags like this to identify items
instead<00:04:09.159> of<00:04:09.280> barcodes<00:04:09.959> storing<00:04:10.959> information

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:11.109 
instead of barcodes storing information

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:13.199 
instead of barcodes storing information
in<00:04:11.620> this<00:04:11.769> tag<00:04:12.010> so<00:04:12.040> when<00:04:12.340> you<00:04:12.430> tap<00:04:12.639> on<00:04:12.849> it<00:04:12.909> it

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:13.209 
in this tag so when you tap on it it

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:14.940 
in this tag so when you tap on it it
pulls<00:04:13.420> out<00:04:13.629> all<00:04:13.690> the<00:04:13.959> details<00:04:14.500> of<00:04:14.709> that

with<00:04:23.919> those<00:04:24.010> serial<00:04:24.520> numbers<00:04:24.550> we<00:04:24.940> can<00:04:25.090> answer

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
with those serial numbers we can answer

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:29.100

that information frequently we see this

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.620 
that information frequently we see this
as<00:04:29.380> a<00:04:29.440> very<00:04:29.650> exciting<00:04:30.280> development<00:04:30.460> we<00:04:31.449> can

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
as a very exciting development we can

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.570 
as a very exciting development we can
basically<00:04:31.810> start<00:04:32.380> taking<00:04:32.889> all<00:04:33.070> sorts<00:04:33.310> of

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
basically start taking all sorts of

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.310 
basically start taking all sorts of
things<00:04:33.820> what<00:04:34.120> that<00:04:34.270> actually<00:04:34.630> delivers<00:04:35.080> for

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
things what that actually delivers for

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.379 
things what that actually delivers for
us<00:04:35.470> obviously<00:04:36.240> ticketing<00:04:37.240> and

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:37.389 
us obviously ticketing and

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360 
transportation is the biggie in here and

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.879 
transportation is the biggie in here and
if<00:04:40.479> something<00:04:40.870> the<00:04:40.960> city<00:04:41.139> calorie<00:04:41.710> could

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:41.889 
if something the city calorie could

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:43.770 
if something the city calorie could
start<00:04:42.160> considering<00:04:42.639> that<00:04:43.000> using<00:04:43.419> mobile

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
start considering that using mobile

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.050 
start considering that using mobile
phones<00:04:44.080> to<00:04:44.289> write<00:04:44.590> it

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.540 

it's<00:04:47.480> a<00:04:47.570> barcode<00:04:47.990> enhancement<00:04:48.830> barcode<00:04:49.400> you

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.550 
it's a barcode enhancement barcode you

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.550 
it's a barcode enhancement barcode you

these<00:05:02.900> with<00:05:03.140> g4s<00:05:03.860> now<00:05:04.190> so<00:05:05.200> when<00:05:06.200> they<00:05:06.320> did

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:06.500 
these with g4s now so when they did

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.470 
these with g4s now so when they did
perimeter<00:05:07.190> checks<00:05:07.580> on<00:05:07.820> buildings<00:05:08.270> and

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:10.460 
campuses to actually prove that they're

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.070 
campuses to actually prove that they're
in<00:05:10.640> there<00:05:10.880> so<00:05:11.090> they<00:05:11.240> tap<00:05:11.450> the<00:05:11.630> wall<00:05:11.780> with<00:05:11.990> the

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 
in there so they tap the wall with the

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.500 
in there so they tap the wall with the
device<00:05:12.410> and<00:05:12.830> what<00:05:13.490> it<00:05:13.580> does<00:05:13.730> is<00:05:13.850> read<00:05:14.060> the<00:05:14.300> tag

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:14.510
