00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
see a couple queen cells that they've

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.749 
see a couple queen cells that they've
built<00:01:39.710> that's<00:01:40.710> good<00:01:40.920> I<00:01:40.950> got<00:01:41.250> three<00:01:41.549> of<00:01:41.579> them

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
built that's good I got three of them

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:51.710 
built that's good I got three of them
one<00:01:43.579> to<00:01:44.579> show<00:01:44.820> you<00:01:44.880> what<00:01:45.060> they<00:01:45.180> look<00:01:45.329> like

so here's a frame of brood that I put in
and<00:01:54.090> they've<00:01:54.180> capped<00:01:54.480> it<00:01:54.690> off<00:01:54.810> this<00:01:55.650> was<00:01:55.890> all

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
and they've capped it off this was all

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.430 
and they've capped it off this was all
eggs<00:01:56.280> and<00:01:56.550> larvae<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:57.120> you<00:01:57.930> can<00:01:58.080> see<00:01:58.230> there's

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.440 
eggs and larvae and you can see there's

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.550 
eggs and larvae and you can see there's
a<00:01:58.500> queen<00:01:58.740> self<00:01:59.070> here<00:01:59.900> there's<00:02:00.900> a<00:02:00.990> queen<00:02:01.260> cell

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
a queen self here there's a queen cell

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.190 
a queen self here there's a queen cell
here<00:02:02.010> and<00:02:02.190> they've<00:02:03.150> built<00:02:03.360> a<00:02:03.480> queen<00:02:03.720> cell<00:02:03.990> down

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
here and they've built a queen cell down

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.800 
here and they've built a queen cell down
here<00:02:04.620> so<00:02:05.610> they've<00:02:05.820> built<00:02:06.060> three<00:02:06.420> different

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
here so they've built three different

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.130 
here so they've built three different
clean<00:02:07.050> cells<00:02:07.320> on<00:02:07.590> this<00:02:08.149> with<00:02:09.149> anticipation<00:02:09.540> of

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
clean cells on this with anticipation of

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.260 
clean cells on this with anticipation of
raising<00:02:10.560> their<00:02:10.680> own<00:02:10.800> queen<00:02:13.910> so<00:02:14.910> that's<00:02:15.090> what

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
raising their own queen so that's what

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.000 
raising their own queen so that's what
we<00:02:15.450> were<00:02:15.540> looking<00:02:15.570> for<00:02:15.840> it's<00:02:16.620> been<00:02:16.770> eight<00:02:16.980> days

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
we were looking for it's been eight days

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.880 
we were looking for it's been eight days
and<00:02:17.840> that<00:02:18.840> should<00:02:19.050> be<00:02:19.170> good<00:02:19.380> I<00:02:19.410> see<00:02:19.620> a<00:02:19.650> couple

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
and that should be good I see a couple

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.680 
and that should be good I see a couple
larvae<00:02:20.460> in<00:02:20.670> here<00:02:20.880> that<00:02:21.030> need<00:02:21.180> to<00:02:21.300> be<00:02:21.330> capped

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
larvae in here that need to be capped

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.010 
larvae in here that need to be capped
off<00:02:21.930> so<00:02:23.090> they're<00:02:24.090> building<00:02:24.420> their<00:02:24.570> own<00:02:24.600> queen

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
off so they're building their own queen

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:43.920 
off so they're building their own queen
which<00:02:25.290> is<00:02:25.470> the<00:02:26.240> desired<00:02:27.240> behavior

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.550 

right<00:02:44.530> here<00:02:45.629> not<00:02:46.629> only<00:02:46.900> they<00:02:47.049> build<00:02:47.319> in<00:02:47.439> their

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
right here not only they build in their

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.440 
right here not only they build in their
own<00:02:47.709> clean<00:02:47.980> but<00:02:48.189> they're<00:02:48.370> literally<00:02:48.849> building

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
own clean but they're literally building

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:50.369 
own clean but they're literally building
their<00:02:49.629> own<00:02:49.659> Queens
