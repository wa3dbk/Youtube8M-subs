you know cam on this one you go to that
one<00:01:38.340> real<00:01:39.150> simple<00:01:39.360> process<00:01:39.869> really<00:01:40.140> easy<00:01:40.350> to

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
one real simple process really easy to

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.230 
one real simple process really easy to
do<00:01:40.560> just<00:01:41.159> got<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:41.400> have<00:01:41.520> some<00:01:41.640> communication

a<00:01:44.670> tree<00:01:44.939> starts<00:01:45.360> just<00:01:45.600> FYI<00:01:45.780> with<00:01:46.259> that<00:01:46.409> one<00:01:46.560> we

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
a tree starts just FYI with that one we

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.109 
a tree starts just FYI with that one we
messed<00:01:46.890> up<00:01:47.070> and<00:01:47.189> it<00:01:47.280> was<00:01:47.369> pretty<00:01:47.490> horrible<00:01:47.670> but

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
messed up and it was pretty horrible but

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.010 
messed up and it was pretty horrible but
just<00:01:48.840> on<00:01:48.960> that<00:01:49.020> one<00:01:50.390> that<00:01:51.390> was<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.570> last<00:01:51.720> one

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
just on that one that was the last one

just on that one that was the last one
or<00:01:52.409> this<00:01:52.560> one<00:01:52.619> is<00:01:52.829> up<00:01:52.979> here<00:01:53.189> it'll<00:01:54.060> disappear

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
or this one is up here it'll disappear

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.630 
or this one is up here it'll disappear
and<00:01:54.780> just<00:01:55.439> little<00:01:55.560> tip<00:01:55.890> if<00:01:56.040> you<00:01:56.250> know<00:01:56.369> you<00:01:56.430> did

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
and just little tip if you know you did

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.499 
and just little tip if you know you did
a<00:01:56.670> step<00:01:56.939> right<00:01:57.180> if<00:01:58.140> it<00:01:58.770> eclipses<00:01:59.520> in<00:01:59.700> you'll

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
a step right if it eclipses in you'll

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:01.910 
a step right if it eclipses in you'll
see<00:02:00.600> it<00:02:00.780> in<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.049> second<00:02:01.500> after<00:02:01.619> they<00:02:01.770> get<00:02:01.860> done

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
see it in the second after they get done

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.100 
see it in the second after they get done
talking<00:02:02.460> you<00:02:03.030> know<00:02:03.060> there's<00:02:03.600> crystal<00:02:03.990> ball

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
talking you know there's crystal ball

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.780 
talking you know there's crystal ball
that<00:02:04.140> pops<00:02:04.380> up<00:02:04.619> that's<00:02:04.829> also<00:02:05.100> another<00:02:05.219> sign<00:02:05.520> I

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
that pops up that's also another sign I

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.459 
that pops up that's also another sign I
doesn't<00:02:06.270> happen<00:02:06.360> after<00:02:06.659> every<00:02:06.930> step<00:02:07.140> but<00:02:07.259> only

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
doesn't happen after every step but only

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.529 
doesn't happen after every step but only
after<00:02:07.560> some<00:02:07.920> and<00:02:08.849> I<00:02:08.910> think<00:02:08.940> you<00:02:09.209> end<00:02:09.360> up<00:02:09.450> with

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
after some and I think you end up with

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.380 
after some and I think you end up with
five<00:02:10.200> or<00:02:10.440> six<00:02:10.739> I<00:02:11.039> think<00:02:11.250> six<00:02:11.610> crystal<00:02:12.090> balls<00:02:12.239> at

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
five or six I think six crystal balls at

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.190 
five or six I think six crystal balls at
the<00:02:12.480> end

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
the end

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.160 
the end
I<00:02:14.099> see<00:02:15.060> the<00:02:15.209> Eclipse<00:02:15.480> is<00:02:15.569> about<00:02:15.780> Tim<00:02:15.930> that's

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
I see the Eclipse is about Tim that's

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.890 
I see the Eclipse is about Tim that's
how<00:02:16.290> we<00:02:16.349> know<00:02:16.530> we<00:02:16.680> completed<00:02:17.040> that<00:02:17.280> step<00:02:17.900> it's

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
how we know we completed that step it's

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.900 
how we know we completed that step it's
right<00:02:18.959> there<00:02:19.230> another<00:02:20.010> FYI<00:02:20.190> you<00:02:20.700> have<00:02:20.819> to

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
waterslide and I that will activate it

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.839 
waterslide and I that will activate it
to<00:02:47.670> work<00:02:47.959> the<00:02:48.959> eclipse<00:02:49.290> will<00:02:49.380> end<00:02:49.650> and<00:02:49.950> then

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:50.849 
to work the eclipse will end and then

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:53.750 
to work the eclipse will end and then
you<00:02:50.970> have<00:02:51.120> to<00:02:51.209> make<00:02:51.329> a<00:02:51.360> nighttime<00:02:51.569> and<00:02:52.549> to<00:02:53.549> do

do need the gun that you know that we

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.000 
do need the gun that you know that we
call<00:02:57.750> up<00:02:57.870> a<00:02:57.930> midget<00:02:58.200> gun<00:02:58.349> or<00:02:58.500> the<00:02:58.530> baby<00:02:58.739> maker

call up a midget gun or the baby maker
i'm<00:02:59.340> not<00:02:59.819> sure<00:02:59.880> but<00:03:00.000> the<00:03:00.120> real<00:03:00.209> name<00:03:00.390> is<00:03:00.510> no

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
i'm not sure but the real name is no

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.750 
i'm not sure but the real name is no
it's<00:03:00.959> really<00:03:01.200> long<00:03:01.319> and<00:03:01.380> complicated<00:03:01.769> and

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
it's really long and complicated and

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.370 
it's really long and complicated and
then<00:03:02.880> once<00:03:03.060> you<00:03:03.150> get<00:03:03.269> with<00:03:03.390> that<00:03:03.420> you<00:03:04.140> can<00:03:04.290> look

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
then once you get with that you can look

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.559 
then once you get with that you can look
to<00:03:04.500> the<00:03:04.620> meteor<00:03:04.890> you<00:03:05.400> grenade<00:03:05.819> it<00:03:05.940> down<00:03:06.120> you

to the meteor you grenade it down you

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:07.550 
to the meteor you grenade it down you
can<00:03:06.690> use<00:03:06.810> the<00:03:06.930> ray<00:03:07.049> gun<00:03:07.230> or<00:03:07.319> whatever

can use the ray gun or whatever
something<00:03:07.860> to<00:03:07.950> explode<00:03:08.250> it<00:03:08.370> down<00:03:08.549> you<00:03:09.239> shrink

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
something to explode it down you shrink

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.600 
something to explode it down you shrink
it<00:03:09.780> and<00:03:10.049> then<00:03:10.440> you<00:03:10.530> knife<00:03:10.829> it<00:03:11.010> into<00:03:11.340> the<00:03:11.430> pool

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
it and then you knife it into the pool

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.479 
it and then you knife it into the pool
onto<00:03:12.150> the<00:03:12.239> slide<00:03:12.680> you<00:03:13.680> follow<00:03:13.920> it<00:03:14.040> down<00:03:14.220> it's

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
onto the slide you follow it down it's

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:17.590 
onto the slide you follow it down it's
just<00:03:14.640> just<00:03:14.790> more<00:03:15.000> fun<00:03:15.180> you<00:03:15.360> see<00:03:15.660> what<00:03:15.780> it<00:03:15.810> does

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
just just more fun you see what it does

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.030 
just just more fun you see what it does
going<00:03:18.600> down<00:03:18.750> the<00:03:18.780> slide<00:03:18.959> it<00:03:19.350> goes<00:03:19.620> all<00:03:19.859> the<00:03:19.889> way

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
going down the slide it goes all the way

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.259 
going down the slide it goes all the way
you<00:03:20.100> don't<00:03:20.250> have<00:03:20.280> to<00:03:20.400> worry<00:03:20.549> about<00:03:20.670> pushing<00:03:21.030> it

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
you don't have to worry about pushing it

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.420 
you don't have to worry about pushing it
at<00:03:21.359> all<00:03:21.510> it<00:03:21.630> goes<00:03:21.780> on<00:03:21.959> its<00:03:22.109> own<00:03:22.260> it<00:03:23.100> eventually

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
at all it goes on its own it eventually

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.129 
at all it goes on its own it eventually
comes<00:03:23.880> down<00:03:24.120> and<00:03:24.359> it<00:03:24.420> goes<00:03:24.510> straight<00:03:24.750> to<00:03:25.109> the

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:25.139 
comes down and it goes straight to the

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:27.650 
comes down and it goes straight to the
guys<00:03:25.350> on<00:03:25.590> its<00:03:25.709> own<00:03:25.829> pretty<00:03:26.100> cool<00:03:26.370> and<00:03:26.660> waiting

guys on its own pretty cool and waiting
to<00:03:27.720> shoot<00:03:28.049> up<00:03:28.230> you<00:03:29.040> go<00:03:29.250> up<00:03:29.370> with<00:03:29.549> it<00:03:29.670> if<00:03:29.760> you

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
to shoot up you go up with it if you

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.330 
to shoot up you go up with it if you
want<00:03:30.060> and<00:03:30.299> then<00:03:30.329> you<00:03:31.170> kind<00:03:31.769> of<00:03:31.799> icon<00:03:32.069> a<00:03:32.100> lost

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
here but I eventually just disappears

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.830 
here but I eventually just disappears
and<00:03:34.560> then<00:03:34.680> it<00:03:34.799> see<00:03:35.220> it<00:03:35.340> come<00:03:35.370> back<00:03:35.639> down<00:03:35.940> right

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
and then it see it come back down right

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.129 
and then it see it come back down right
onto<00:03:37.260> a<00:03:37.530> little<00:03:37.859> hole<00:03:38.010> there<00:03:38.040> perfect<00:03:38.579> landing

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:39.139 
onto a little hole there perfect landing

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:41.660 
onto a little hole there perfect landing
okay<00:03:40.139> that<00:03:40.380> stuff<00:03:40.590> was<00:03:40.680> pretty<00:03:40.829> simple<00:03:41.130> after

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
okay that stuff was pretty simple after

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:42.740 
okay that stuff was pretty simple after
this<00:03:41.760> one<00:03:41.940> there's<00:03:42.090> some<00:03:42.209> guys<00:03:42.389> in<00:03:42.600> there<00:03:42.720> I

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
this one there's some guys in there I

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.960 
this one there's some guys in there I
didn't<00:03:42.959> get<00:03:43.019> to<00:03:43.079> hear<00:03:43.260> the<00:03:43.380> audio<00:03:43.790> they<00:03:44.790> need

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
didn't get to hear the audio they need

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.430 
didn't get to hear the audio they need
air<00:03:45.120> so<00:03:45.359> you<00:03:45.450> turn<00:03:45.630> that<00:03:45.780> valve<00:03:45.989> I<00:03:46.200> looked<00:03:46.350> at

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
air so you turn that valve I looked at

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:47.990 
air so you turn that valve I looked at
you<00:03:46.530> just<00:03:46.650> hold<00:03:46.769> X<00:03:46.980> on<00:03:47.130> it<00:03:47.160> and<00:03:47.730> a<00:03:47.760> whole<00:03:47.970> bunch

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
you just hold X on it and a whole bunch

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.699 
you just hold X on it and a whole bunch
of<00:03:48.239> gas<00:03:48.389> starts<00:03:48.690> leaking<00:03:48.870> in<00:03:49.170> in<00:03:49.470> the

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
of gas starts leaking in in the

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:52.670 
of gas starts leaking in in the
underground<00:03:50.250> area<00:03:50.670> and<00:03:50.989> get<00:03:51.989> it<00:03:52.290> all<00:03:52.319> lit<00:03:52.650> up

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
underground area and get it all lit up

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:53.900 
underground area and get it all lit up
and<00:03:52.889> to<00:03:52.980> get<00:03:53.100> them<00:03:53.220> out<00:03:53.310> in<00:03:53.519> the<00:03:53.549> freedom<00:03:53.790> you

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
and to get them out in the freedom you

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.340 
and to get them out in the freedom you
have<00:03:54.090> to<00:03:54.209> get<00:03:54.329> the<00:03:54.420> Napalm<00:03:54.810> guy<00:03:55.049> and<00:03:55.230> then

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
have to get the Napalm guy and then

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.589 
have to get the Napalm guy and then
light<00:03:55.799> everything<00:03:56.130> on<00:03:56.250> fire<00:03:56.489> what<00:03:57.299> we<00:03:57.359> decide

00:03:57.589 --> 00:03:57.599 
light everything on fire what we decide

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:58.789 
light everything on fire what we decide
to<00:03:57.630> do<00:03:57.750> a<00:03:57.780> deal<00:03:57.930> was<00:03:58.049> just<00:03:58.230> kill<00:03:58.530> them<00:03:58.620> and<00:03:58.709> you

00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799 
to do a deal was just kill them and you

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:00.680 
to do a deal was just kill them and you
know<00:03:58.950> more<00:03:59.310> fire<00:03:59.519> the<00:03:59.819> better<00:03:59.970> I<00:04:00.150> was<00:04:00.569> just

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
know more fire the better I was just

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.330 
know more fire the better I was just
seemed<00:04:00.870> like<00:04:00.900> the<00:04:01.019> right<00:04:01.139> thing<00:04:01.260> to<00:04:01.530> do<00:04:01.650> I'm

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
seemed like the right thing to do I'm

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:03.949 
seemed like the right thing to do I'm
real<00:04:02.670> simple<00:04:03.000> part<00:04:03.180> well<00:04:03.389> actually<00:04:03.630> it's<00:04:03.840> kind

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
real simple part well actually it's kind

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:05.000 
real simple part well actually it's kind
of<00:04:03.989> difficult<00:04:04.139> because<00:04:04.440> you<00:04:04.560> got<00:04:04.680> to<00:04:04.769> Lou<00:04:04.889> the

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
of difficult because you got to Lou the

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.009 
of difficult because you got to Lou the
Napalm<00:04:05.310> guy<00:04:05.489> in<00:04:05.639> there<00:04:05.819> so<00:04:06.060> that's<00:04:06.750> probably

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:07.019 
Napalm guy in there so that's probably

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:08.870 
Napalm guy in there so that's probably
one<00:04:07.349> of<00:04:07.380> the<00:04:07.500> hardest<00:04:07.680> parts<00:04:07.980> after<00:04:08.609> that

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
one of the hardest parts after that

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.099 
one of the hardest parts after that
right<00:04:09.060> there<00:04:09.239> I<00:04:09.419> don't<00:04:09.660> you<00:04:09.720> see<00:04:09.840> if<00:04:09.930> there's<00:04:10.049> a

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:10.109 
right there I don't you see if there's a

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:11.720 
right there I don't you see if there's a
lever<00:04:10.319> after<00:04:10.950> you<00:04:11.010> get<00:04:11.099> the<00:04:11.160> Napalm<00:04:11.430> guy<00:04:11.609> in

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
lever after you get the Napalm guy in

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.280 
lever after you get the Napalm guy in
there<00:04:11.849> you<00:04:11.970> pull<00:04:12.150> that<00:04:12.239> lever<00:04:12.480> that's<00:04:13.019> the<00:04:13.169> end

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
there you pull that lever that's the end

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.830 
there you pull that lever that's the end
of<00:04:13.319> that<00:04:13.380> step<00:04:13.680> pretty<00:04:13.859> simple<00:04:14.510> then<00:04:15.510> they

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
of that step pretty simple then they

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.050 
of that step pretty simple then they
come<00:04:16.049> into<00:04:16.200> this<00:04:16.440> other<00:04:16.709> cave<00:04:17.039> and<00:04:17.400> see<00:04:17.910> that

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
come into this other cave and see that

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.789 
come into this other cave and see that
hole<00:04:18.209> right<00:04:18.299> there<00:04:18.359> you<00:04:19.019> put<00:04:19.169> spike<00:04:19.440> more<00:04:19.620> than

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
hole right there you put spike more than

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:21.649 
hole right there you put spike more than
each<00:04:19.979> one<00:04:20.190> of<00:04:20.220> the<00:04:20.340> holes<00:04:20.549> and<00:04:21.150> you<00:04:21.359> blow<00:04:21.570> them

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:21.659 
each one of the holes and you blow them

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:24.320 
each one of the holes and you blow them
up<00:04:21.810> and<00:04:22.039> they<00:04:23.039> cover<00:04:23.310> up<00:04:23.490> the<00:04:23.640> holes<00:04:23.820> that's

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
up and they cover up the holes that's

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:25.910 
up and they cover up the holes that's
how<00:04:24.419> you<00:04:24.479> fill<00:04:24.780> them<00:04:24.900> and<00:04:25.110> then

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:25.920 
how you fill them and then

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.470 
how you fill them and then
right<00:04:26.280> under<00:04:26.520> the<00:04:26.610> wat<00:04:26.730> fault<00:04:27.000> I<00:04:27.090> didn't<00:04:27.330> show

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480 
right under the wat fault I didn't show

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.810 
right under the wat fault I didn't show
this<00:04:27.660> there's<00:04:27.990> a<00:04:28.050> big<00:04:28.530> block<00:04:28.920> and<00:04:29.160> big<00:04:29.670> like

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
this there's a big block and big like

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.180 
this there's a big block and big like
rock<00:04:30.150> in<00:04:30.300> the<00:04:30.390> middle<00:04:30.540> and<00:04:30.720> there's<00:04:31.320> a<00:04:31.380> button

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
rock in the middle and there's a button

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:33.680 
rock in the middle and there's a button
that<00:04:32.280> says<00:04:32.490> do<00:04:32.640> not<00:04:32.670> hold<00:04:32.940> X<00:04:33.150> and<00:04:33.390> of<00:04:33.450> course

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
that says do not hold X and of course

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.000 
that says do not hold X and of course
you<00:04:33.780> hold<00:04:33.960> X<00:04:34.110> once<00:04:34.350> you<00:04:34.440> have<00:04:34.590> all<00:04:34.620> the<00:04:34.800> holes

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
you hold X once you have all the holes

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:36.920 
you hold X once you have all the holes
filled<00:04:35.220> and<00:04:35.460> that<00:04:35.880> gets<00:04:36.120> them<00:04:36.240> out<00:04:36.330> that's

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
filled and that gets them out that's

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:38.090 
filled and that gets them out that's
when<00:04:37.080> you<00:04:37.110> do<00:04:37.260> this<00:04:37.440> part<00:04:37.710> there's<00:04:37.830> a<00:04:37.950> whole

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
when you do this part there's a whole

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.070 
when you do this part there's a whole
bunch<00:04:38.220> tablets<00:04:38.880> are<00:04:39.000> on<00:04:39.120> the<00:04:39.180> wall<00:04:39.360> with<00:04:40.050> a

faded designs of what you did in the

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.850 
faded designs of what you did in the
second<00:04:41.910> step<00:04:42.060> and<00:04:42.300> to<00:04:43.050> activate<00:04:43.560> all<00:04:43.680> those

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
second step and to activate all those

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.680 
second step and to activate all those
you<00:04:44.010> just<00:04:44.040> nice<00:04:44.430> it<00:04:44.640> sometimes<00:04:45.000> it<00:04:45.390> takes<00:04:45.480> more

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
you just nice it sometimes it takes more

don't know if you see it right in the
middle<00:05:09.840> of<00:05:09.900> my<00:05:09.960> screen<00:05:10.080> it<00:05:10.590> looks<00:05:10.620> like<00:05:10.860> a

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:10.890

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:12.920 
middle of my screen it looks like a
little<00:05:11.190> hint<00:05:11.730> built<00:05:12.000> out<00:05:12.150> of<00:05:12.180> woods<00:05:12.510> looks

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:16.230 
anyone can do if you just throw out an

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:18.650 
anyone can do if you just throw out an
eight<00:05:16.320> at<00:05:16.470> it<00:05:16.560> and<00:05:16.680> build<00:05:17.040> up<00:05:17.130> really<00:05:18.090> easy<00:05:18.330> I

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:18.660 
eight at it and build up really easy I

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:22.130 
eight at it and build up really easy I
don't<00:05:19.080> know<00:05:19.200> what<00:05:20.040> it<00:05:20.130> has<00:05:20.250> to<00:05:20.280> do<00:05:20.550> with<00:05:20.700> it<00:05:21.140> um

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:22.140 
don't know what it has to do with it um

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:24.470 
don't know what it has to do with it um
but<00:05:23.040> yeah<00:05:23.160> it's<00:05:23.340> what<00:05:23.670> you<00:05:23.700> do<00:05:23.880> there<00:05:24.060> real

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:24.480 
but yeah it's what you do there real

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.710 
but yeah it's what you do there real
simple<00:05:24.690> and<00:05:25.050> that<00:05:25.160> step<00:05:26.160> is<00:05:26.280> over<00:05:26.630> after<00:05:27.630> that

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:27.720 
simple and that step is over after that

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:28.790 
simple and that step is over after that
step<00:05:27.930> you<00:05:28.050> know<00:05:28.140> they're<00:05:28.560> going<00:05:28.650> to<00:05:28.740> see

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 
step you know they're going to see

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.340 
step you know they're going to see
eclipse<00:05:28.890> you<00:05:29.850> got<00:05:30.000> to<00:05:30.060> do<00:05:30.120> the<00:05:30.210> dials<00:05:30.630> the

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:31.350 
eclipse you got to do the dials the

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:34.280 
eclipse you got to do the dials the
dials<00:05:31.740> were<00:05:32.010> of<00:05:32.550> the<00:05:32.820> trouble<00:05:33.330> but<00:05:34.080> you<00:05:34.200> have

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:34.290 
dials were of the trouble but you have

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:40.250 
dials were of the trouble but you have
to<00:05:34.410> have<00:05:34.530> 16<00:05:35.930> 13<00:05:36.930> for<00:05:37.560> for<00:05:38.490> the<00:05:38.610> dials<00:05:39.000> made<00:05:39.900> the

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:40.260 
to have 16 13 for for the dials made the

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.290 
to have 16 13 for for the dials made the
dots<00:05:40.620> and<00:05:40.950> lines<00:05:41.100> and<00:05:41.460> half<00:05:41.610> squares<00:05:42.030> or

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:42.300 
dots and lines and half squares or

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:43.400 
dots and lines and half squares or
rectangles<00:05:42.330> whatever<00:05:43.020> you<00:05:43.080> want<00:05:43.200> to<00:05:43.290> call

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:43.410 
rectangles whatever you want to call

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:45.050 
rectangles whatever you want to call
them<00:05:43.470> kind<00:05:44.070> of<00:05:44.160> won't<00:05:44.310> work<00:05:44.490> like<00:05:44.670> a<00:05:44.700> Roman

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:45.060 
them kind of won't work like a Roman

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:47.600 
them kind of won't work like a Roman
numeral<00:05:45.150> system<00:05:45.780> I'm<00:05:46.140> not<00:05:47.130> understand

numeral system I'm not understand

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:50.240 
numeral system I'm not understand
positive<00:05:47.940> I<00:05:48.000> know<00:05:48.060> what<00:05:48.300> that<00:05:48.330> is<00:05:48.510> one<00:05:48.960> a<00:05:49.250> line

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:50.250
