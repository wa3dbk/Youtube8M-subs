00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
Nintendo because they've always kind of

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.900

like<00:05:52.540> that<00:05:52.810> and<00:05:53.740> then<00:05:54.430> Hoople<00:05:55.060> was<00:05:55.270> revealed<00:05:56.230> i

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:56.620 
like that and then Hoople was revealed i

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:58.830 
like that and then Hoople was revealed i
guess<00:05:57.370> for<00:05:57.640> like<00:05:57.820> the<00:05:57.970> fifth<00:05:58.180> time<00:05:58.240> because<00:05:58.690> we

00:05:58.830 --> 00:05:58.840 
guess for like the fifth time because we

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:01.080 
guess for like the fifth time because we
knew<00:05:58.990> about<00:05:59.140> it<00:05:59.470> a<00:05:59.620> long<00:06:00.100> time<00:06:00.160> ago<00:06:00.460> and<00:06:01.000> then
