00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 today I feel like an old man at the bus stop 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.240
 of the bus you remember that period 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.820
 where when I watched an episode of 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.309
 texas walker ranger no one will break you i 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.349
 balls with no joke about chuck 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.580
 norris or the period in which to go to 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.740
 see a michael bay non movie 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.840
 involved lynching by the 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.150
 your friends followed you was the period 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.220
 before the internet or better the internet 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.080
 already existed but it was not a break of 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.060
 balls to visit it now everyone does 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.160
 jokes about chuck norris all hate 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.840
 michael bay because the internet in the end is 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.579
 like that friend of yours who continues to 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.110
 change the size of your penis by 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.640
 story in history so many times 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.260
 which in the end can no longer understand 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.510
 what is the truth and what is the lie e 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.969
 so I asked myself a question how many 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.950
 sometimes crilin died eh yes because if you 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.980
 go and see on the internet everyone does 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.660
 jokes about crilin who dies but loved 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.610
 resuscitate knows it but will also die in the 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.030
 new season of super dragon ball 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.640
 yes but how many actually know how many 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:00.030
 sometimes quite five or six a Krillin 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.350
 I was not even fifteen hundred thousand 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.170
 so sure so i went to 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.510
 check and I found out what crilin is 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:09.780
 officially dead five times five 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.780
 deaths yes but compared to 500 episodes eh 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.960
 yes because if we count 153 episodes of 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:19.380
 dragon ball of the original series 291 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:22.290
 of the z series and 64 of the gt do 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.770
 exactly 508 episodes in Italy 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.900
 obviously 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.580
 and fucking five dead names look like that 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.439
 many but we really want to go to 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.329
 look for the hair in the egg a death 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.979
 therefore it occurs in the alternative universe 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.890
 in theory for the main storyline 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.470
 does not count and then dies at the hands of super 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.119
 c 17 in dragon ball gt che 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.650
 universally no one takes in 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.570
 then consider the deaths that 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.820
 we can consider the effects of mine 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.040
 customer are three deaths against 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.899
 tambourine maybe younger if not 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.460
 remember but tambourine was the son of 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.650
 to the satan or great little wizard in evil 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.690
 where he is killed already dressed elegantly 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.790
 death ready for the coffin in the last one 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.619
 part of dragon ball z against burgo where 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.450
 crisis is transformed into a bar 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:03.040
 then chocolate is eaten 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.080
 most famous that everyone knows against 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.479
 freezer seen at the end are only 3 not 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.890
 it is so serious and in the end all three in 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:10.600
 one way or another have been 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.670
 important as dead right for 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.140
 remind you of death against frize door 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.880
 to the transformation of super cocoon 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.620
 sayan according to me there are characters who 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.260
 they would deserve much more to be 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.830
 I fucked one of them all fucking 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.080
 ref 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.630
 oh my god he dies making himself jump 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:28.750
 in the air against tassel sacrifices itself for 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:36.730
 kill him and not even one 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:39.220
 scratch and explosion and slutty pink 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.890
 whore rief how unnecessary you must be 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.950
 in short, livescribe has long 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.360
 there are much more serious things in my opinion 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.070
 like a 27-year-old who talks about 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.910
 dragon ball no I really am 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.910
 boring this summer
