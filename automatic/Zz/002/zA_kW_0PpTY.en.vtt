00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
probably do it but I like mine quite low

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.750 
probably do it but I like mine quite low
I<00:02:13.819> don't<00:02:14.689> so<00:02:14.870> you<00:02:14.930> pin<00:02:15.260> it<00:02:15.290> there<00:02:15.620> and<00:02:16.430> then

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
I don't so you pin it there and then

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.530 
I don't so you pin it there and then
down<00:02:17.480> to<00:02:17.870> you<00:02:18.799> pin<00:02:19.010> it<00:02:19.040> again<00:02:19.430> down<00:02:19.610> here<00:02:20.000> so

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
down to you pin it again down here so

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.000 
down to you pin it again down here so
that<00:02:20.689> you<00:02:20.780> know<00:02:20.959> which<00:02:21.080> bit<00:02:21.349> too<00:02:21.470> sir<00:02:21.680> so<00:02:21.980> you

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
that you know which bit too sir so you

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.040 
that you know which bit too sir so you
basically<00:02:22.310> and<00:02:22.790> which<00:02:22.940> is<00:02:23.060> confusing<00:02:23.420> you

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
basically and which is confusing you

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.500 
basically and which is confusing you
just<00:02:24.530> sew<00:02:24.800> it<00:02:24.830> all<00:02:25.250> this<00:02:25.730> bit

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
just sew it all this bit

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.500 
just sew it all this bit
and<00:02:26.930> then<00:02:27.200> you<00:02:27.349> stop<00:02:27.680> about<00:02:28.610> where<00:02:29.090> your<00:02:29.239> waste

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
and then you stop about where your waste

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.130 
and then you stop about where your waste
ends<00:02:30.849> or<00:02:31.849> whenever<00:02:32.239> you<00:02:32.480> want<00:02:32.599> your<00:02:32.900> dress<00:02:33.080> to

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
ends or whenever you want your dress to

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.360 
ends or whenever you want your dress to
start<00:02:33.379> flaring<00:02:33.860> out<00:02:34.180> you<00:02:35.180> stop<00:02:35.510> saying<00:02:35.780> no<00:02:36.370> and

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
start flaring out you stop saying no and

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.220 
start flaring out you stop saying no and
you<00:02:37.549> do<00:02:37.700> the<00:02:37.849> same<00:02:38.030> on<00:02:38.239> the<00:02:38.390> back<00:02:38.569> so<00:02:38.930> with<00:02:39.110> the

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
you do the same on the back so with the

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:40.780 
you do the same on the back so with the
back<00:02:39.379> you'll<00:02:39.620> probably<00:02:39.830> want<00:02:40.159> the<00:02:40.310> neck<00:02:40.489> a<00:02:40.760> bit

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
back you'll probably want the neck a bit

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.420 
back you'll probably want the neck a bit
higher<00:02:41.390> and<00:02:41.810> you<00:02:42.590> do<00:02:42.709> the<00:02:42.860> same<00:02:43.010> on<00:02:43.190> the<00:02:43.280> back

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
higher and you do the same on the back

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.630 
higher and you do the same on the back
you<00:02:43.700> measure<00:02:44.319> from<00:02:45.319> where<00:02:46.099> you<00:02:46.250> stopped

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
you measure from where you stopped

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.020 
you measure from where you stopped
sewing<00:02:47.120> to<00:02:47.840> the<00:02:48.830> end<00:02:48.980> of<00:02:49.160> your<00:02:49.310> dress<00:02:49.610> so<00:02:49.970> to

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
sewing to the end of your dress so to

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.069 
sewing to the end of your dress so to
meet<00:02:50.330> with<00:02:50.540> me<00:02:50.720> here<00:02:51.560> to<00:02:51.769> the<00:02:51.920> flower<00:02:52.190> and<00:02:53.079> you

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:54.079 
meet with me here to the flower and you

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:55.660 
meet with me here to the flower and you
measure<00:02:54.290> that<00:02:54.530> so<00:02:54.920> if<00:02:54.980> it's<00:02:55.220> I<00:02:55.459> don't<00:02:55.519> know

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
measure that so if it's I don't know

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.600 
measure that so if it's I don't know
five<00:02:56.000> to<00:02:56.150> five<00:02:56.299> inches<00:02:56.780> you<00:02:57.049> measure<00:02:57.400> five<00:02:58.400> to

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
five to five inches you measure five to

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.650 
five to five inches you measure five to
five<00:02:58.790> inches<00:02:59.239> on<00:02:59.299> some<00:02:59.660> cloth<00:02:59.930> and<00:03:00.280> then<00:03:01.660> you

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
five inches on some cloth and then you

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.289 
five inches on some cloth and then you
make<00:03:02.870> a<00:03:03.110> triangle<00:03:03.849> you<00:03:04.849> could<00:03:05.090> have<00:03:05.269> a

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:05.299 
make a triangle you could have a

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:09.460 
make a triangle you could have a
triangle<00:03:05.989> so<00:03:06.200> this<00:03:06.379> bits<00:03:06.650> 45<00:03:07.370> inches<00:03:07.940> and<00:03:08.470> then

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
triangle so this bits 45 inches and then

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:15.190 
triangle so this bits 45 inches and then
you<00:03:09.680> cut<00:03:09.950> a<00:03:10.250> triangle<00:03:11.030> like<00:03:11.890> that<00:03:13.359> if<00:03:14.359> my

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
you cut a triangle like that if my

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.220 
you cut a triangle like that if my
husband<00:03:15.560> Mona<00:03:15.769> if<00:03:16.459> I<00:03:16.670> make<00:03:16.849> sense<00:03:17.180> a<00:03:17.599> triangle

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
husband Mona if I make sense a triangle

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.490 
husband Mona if I make sense a triangle
here<00:03:18.890> for<00:03:19.099> them<00:03:19.220> that<00:03:19.459> you<00:03:19.489> just<00:03:19.760> pin<00:03:20.260> B<00:03:21.260> bits

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
here for them that you just pin B bits

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.069 
here for them that you just pin B bits
together<00:03:21.739> where<00:03:22.250> your<00:03:22.400> arm<00:03:22.609> with<00:03:22.819> me<00:03:23.030> so<00:03:23.840> down

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:24.079 
together where your arm with me so down

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:27.009 
together where your arm with me so down
stop<00:03:25.010> at<00:03:25.220> the<00:03:25.310> waist<00:03:25.519> just<00:03:26.000> like<00:03:26.599> you<00:03:26.720> did<00:03:26.900> with

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:27.019 
stop at the waist just like you did with

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:29.710 
stop at the waist just like you did with
the<00:03:27.079> front<00:03:27.379> and<00:03:27.500> back<00:03:27.680> and<00:03:28.359> then<00:03:29.359> when<00:03:29.569> you've

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
the front and back and then when you've

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.659 
the front and back and then when you've
caught<00:03:29.959> your<00:03:30.109> triangles<00:03:30.709> where<00:03:31.280> you<00:03:31.370> stop

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:31.669 
caught your triangles where you stop

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:38.650 
caught your triangles where you stop
saying<00:03:32.380> you<00:03:33.380> saw<00:03:33.680> the<00:03:34.639> triangles<00:03:35.709> in<00:03:37.660> like

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
saying you saw the triangles in like

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:44.050 
saying you saw the triangles in like
that<00:03:38.989> and<00:03:39.549> on<00:03:40.549> the<00:03:40.819> sides<00:03:41.169> and<00:03:42.370> on<00:03:43.370> the<00:03:43.519> back<00:03:43.669> so

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
that and on the sides and on the back so

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.530 
that and on the sides and on the back so
you're<00:03:44.209> there<00:03:44.389> for<00:03:44.690> triangle<00:03:45.319> panel<00:03:46.160> things

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
you're there for triangle panel things

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.960 
you're there for triangle panel things
and<00:03:47.540> they're<00:03:47.780> going<00:03:48.019> like<00:03:48.079> that<00:03:48.230> and

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
and they're going like that and

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.059 
and they're going like that and
obviously<00:03:49.970> when<00:03:50.720> your<00:03:50.870> side<00:03:51.139> address<00:03:51.500> is

00:03:52.059 --> 00:03:52.069 
obviously when your side address is

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:55.809 
obviously when your side address is
important<00:03:52.880> to<00:03:53.180> say<00:03:53.419> it<00:03:53.950> inside<00:03:54.950> outside<00:03:55.190> so<00:03:55.730> if

00:03:55.809 --> 00:03:55.819 
important to say it inside outside so if

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:58.930 
important to say it inside outside so if
you<00:03:55.940> say<00:03:56.180> it<00:03:56.239> here<00:03:56.829> it<00:03:57.829> will<00:03:57.980> be<00:03:58.130> like<00:03:58.160> that<00:03:58.609> on

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
you say it here it will be like that on

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.870 
you say it here it will be like that on
the<00:03:59.720> inside<00:04:00.169> but<00:04:00.980> then<00:04:01.160> when<00:04:01.310> you<00:04:01.430> turn<00:04:01.669> it

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 
the inside but then when you turn it

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.170 
the inside but then when you turn it
around<00:04:02.000> it<00:04:02.720> will<00:04:03.470> be<00:04:03.590> like<00:04:03.769> this<00:04:04.069> on<00:04:04.489> the

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
around it will be like this on the

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.960 
around it will be like this on the
outside<00:04:05.530> so<00:04:06.530> the<00:04:06.829> bit<00:04:07.010> the<00:04:07.310> fabric<00:04:07.730> that<00:04:07.849> you

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
outside so the bit the fabric that you

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.470 
outside so the bit the fabric that you
want<00:04:08.150> on<00:04:08.239> the<00:04:08.359> outside<00:04:09.340> should<00:04:10.340> be<00:04:10.639> like<00:04:11.180> that

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
want on the outside should be like that

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.869 
want on the outside should be like that
and<00:04:11.690> the<00:04:11.930> inside<00:04:12.290> should<00:04:13.129> be<00:04:13.220> like<00:04:13.370> that<00:04:13.400> I've

00:04:13.869 --> 00:04:13.879 
and the inside should be like that I've

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:16.599 
and the inside should be like that I've
done<00:04:14.030> it<00:04:14.150> back<00:04:14.299> to<00:04:14.450> front<00:04:14.629> it<00:04:14.810> yeah<00:04:14.959> and<00:04:15.609> then

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:16.609 
done it back to front it yeah and then

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:21.310 
done it back to front it yeah and then
um<00:04:18.400> that's<00:04:19.400> about<00:04:19.700> it<00:04:19.940> you're<00:04:20.150> obviously<00:04:20.450> the

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 
um that's about it you're obviously the

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.350 
um that's about it you're obviously the
finishing<00:04:21.769> touches<00:04:21.979> are<00:04:22.310> just<00:04:22.490> like<00:04:22.880> hemming

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
finishing touches are just like hemming

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.200 
finishing touches are just like hemming
and<00:04:23.570> stuff<00:04:24.289> like<00:04:24.470> that<00:04:24.830> which<00:04:25.669> you<00:04:25.820> can<00:04:26.030> just

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
and stuff like that which you can just

going to do so

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.850 
going to do so
my<00:04:39.980> dress<00:04:40.250> tutorials<00:04:40.880> there<00:04:41.210> which<00:04:42.110> are<00:04:42.500> a

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
my dress tutorials there which are a

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.750 
my dress tutorials there which are a
little<00:04:43.070> different<00:04:43.910> but<00:04:44.270> this<00:04:44.420> is<00:04:44.600> the<00:04:44.780> one

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:45.760 
little different but this is the one

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.130 
little different but this is the one
that<00:04:46.760> I<00:04:46.790> started<00:04:47.420> off<00:04:47.540> with<00:04:47.720> because<00:04:48.050> I've

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:48.140 
that I started off with because I've

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:50.350 
that I started off with because I've
never<00:04:48.500> had<00:04:48.710> so<00:04:48.980> unless<00:04:49.250> Enzo<00:04:49.730> anything<00:04:50.150> like

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
never had so unless Enzo anything like

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.190 
never had so unless Enzo anything like
that<00:04:50.390> and<00:04:51.140> I<00:04:51.740> figured<00:04:52.130> this<00:04:52.280> out<00:04:52.490> on<00:04:52.970> my<00:04:53.690> own<00:04:53.720> so

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:54.200 
that and I figured this out on my own so

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.050 
that and I figured this out on my own so
when<00:04:54.380> the<00:04:54.500> dress<00:04:54.710> is<00:04:54.860> done<00:04:55.130> you'll<00:04:55.760> probably

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:56.060 
when the dress is done you'll probably

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.920 
when the dress is done you'll probably
want<00:04:56.600> to<00:04:56.690> cinch<00:04:57.050> it<00:04:57.350> in<00:04:57.500> with<00:04:58.130> a<00:04:58.160> belt<00:04:58.930> that's

00:04:59.920 --> 00:04:59.930 
want to cinch it in with a belt that's

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:03.970 
want to cinch it in with a belt that's
why<00:05:00.230> I<00:05:00.290> do<00:05:00.410> and<00:05:01.870> say<00:05:02.870> it's<00:05:03.020> easier<00:05:03.350> to<00:05:03.410> take<00:05:03.740> on

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:03.980 
why I do and say it's easier to take on

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:06.130 
why I do and say it's easier to take on
impove<00:05:04.370> you<00:05:04.550> don't<00:05:04.790> need<00:05:04.940> a<00:05:05.030> zip<00:05:05.270> because<00:05:05.960> it's

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:06.140
