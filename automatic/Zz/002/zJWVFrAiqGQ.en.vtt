think it's nothing like that experience

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:06.050 
think it's nothing like that experience
exactly<00:01:02.670> that<00:01:02.850> energy<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:03.480> so<00:01:04.369> they<00:01:05.369> wanted

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
exactly that energy and so they wanted

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.760 
exactly that energy and so they wanted
me<00:01:06.149> to<00:01:06.180> do<00:01:06.390> an<00:01:06.509> interview<00:01:06.600> right<00:01:07.140> before<00:01:07.560> it
