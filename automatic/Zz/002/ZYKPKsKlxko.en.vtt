have our 3d scanner here behind us so

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.750 
have our 3d scanner here behind us so
you<00:00:52.649> would<00:00:52.800> step<00:00:52.980> into<00:00:53.160> it<00:00:53.370> just<00:00:53.430> takes<00:00:53.670> a

all around and we process the data
turned<00:00:59.550> into<00:00:59.699> this<00:00:59.820> 3d<00:01:00.059> file<00:01:00.300> and<00:01:00.449> then<00:01:00.539> we<00:01:00.660> 3d

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
turned into this 3d file and then we 3d

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.979 
turned into this 3d file and then we 3d
print<00:01:01.100> these<00:01:02.100> action<00:01:02.850> figures<00:01:03.120> of<00:01:03.270> you<00:01:03.359> people

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.080 
well it's not 3d printing for the sake
of<00:01:10.470> 3d<00:01:10.860> printing<00:01:11.189> is<00:01:11.280> you've<00:01:11.520> sort<00:01:11.729> of<00:01:11.790> seen<00:01:11.850> in

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
of 3d printing is you've sort of seen in

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.940 
of 3d printing is you've sort of seen in
the<00:01:12.180> past<00:01:12.420> ago<00:01:12.840> some<00:01:13.049> of<00:01:13.080> them<00:01:13.229> aren't<00:01:13.380> that<00:01:13.530> 3d

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
the past ago some of them aren't that 3d

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:14.630 
the past ago some of them aren't that 3d
printing<00:01:14.159> hasn't<00:01:14.430> been<00:01:14.520> that

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
printing hasn't been that

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.609 
printing hasn't been that
high-resolution<00:01:15.479> it's<00:01:16.020> hard<00:01:16.229> for<00:01:16.409> people<00:01:16.470> to

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619

this sounds fun

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.819 
this sounds fun
should<00:01:42.750> I<00:01:42.780> get<00:01:42.899> in<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.110> scanner<00:01:43.380> yeah

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
should I get in the scanner yeah

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.560 
should I get in the scanner yeah
absolutely<00:01:44.250> let's<00:01:44.820> make<00:01:44.939> these<00:01:45.060> super<00:01:45.240> gyro

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
absolutely let's make these super gyro

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.990 
absolutely let's make these super gyro
all<00:01:46.020> right<00:01:46.170> step<00:01:46.860> on<00:01:47.009> in<00:01:48.020> so<00:01:49.020> basically<00:01:50.000> you

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
all right step on in so basically you

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.020 
all right step on in so basically you
have<00:01:51.119> 54<00:01:51.659> cameras<00:01:52.140> from<00:01:53.100> all<00:01:53.220> angles<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:53.939> then

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
have 54 cameras from all angles and then

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.310 
have 54 cameras from all angles and then
you're<00:01:54.210> just<00:01:54.299> gonna<00:01:54.420> position<00:01:54.750> yourself<00:01:55.229> in

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
you're just gonna position yourself in

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.580 
you're just gonna position yourself in
the<00:01:55.380> center<00:01:55.680> of<00:01:55.710> this<00:01:55.890> circle<00:01:57.439> all<00:01:58.439> right

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
the center of this circle all right

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.469 
the center of this circle all right
let's<00:01:58.979> do<00:01:59.340> this

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:08.059 

three-two-one<00:02:06.259> in<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.380> process<00:02:07.890> called

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
three-two-one in the process called

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.290 
three-two-one in the process called
photogrammetry<00:02:08.840> we<00:02:09.840> take<00:02:10.019> the<00:02:10.140> 54<00:02:10.560> images

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
photogrammetry we take the 54 images

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.800 
photogrammetry we take the 54 images
process<00:02:12.300> it<00:02:12.420> through<00:02:12.510> a<00:02:12.569> proprietary

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
process it through a proprietary

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.930 
process it through a proprietary
software<00:02:13.349> which<00:02:13.769> turns<00:02:14.010> it<00:02:14.160> into<00:02:14.280> a<00:02:14.370> 3d<00:02:14.670> file

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
software which turns it into a 3d file

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.820 
software which turns it into a 3d file
and<00:02:15.569> we<00:02:15.780> send<00:02:15.959> it<00:02:16.019> to<00:02:16.050> our<00:02:16.140> production<00:02:16.379> Center

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
and we send it to our production Center

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.009 
and we send it to our production Center
in<00:02:16.950> Brooklyn<00:02:17.069> where<00:02:17.519> we<00:02:17.670> do<00:02:17.819> the<00:02:18.090> 3d<00:02:18.569> printing

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
in Brooklyn where we do the 3d printing

in Brooklyn where we do the 3d printing
that<00:02:19.440> process<00:02:20.010> actually<00:02:20.190> can<00:02:20.519> take<00:02:20.700> up<00:02:20.849> to

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
that process actually can take up to

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.440 
that process actually can take up to
about<00:02:21.150> a<00:02:21.209> day<00:02:21.540> it's<00:02:22.200> layers<00:02:22.709> of<00:02:23.390> thousands<00:02:24.390> of

by one built up glued together and then

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.280 
by one built up glued together and then
at<00:02:29.370> the<00:02:29.459> end<00:02:29.489> you're<00:02:29.790> sort<00:02:30.030> of<00:02:30.060> reaching<00:02:30.959> into

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
at the end you're sort of reaching into

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.470 
at the end you're sort of reaching into
this<00:02:31.410> printer<00:02:31.920> and<00:02:32.129> sort<00:02:32.610> of<00:02:32.670> excavating<00:02:33.390> out

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
this printer and sort of excavating out

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.530 
this printer and sort of excavating out
of<00:02:33.599> this<00:02:33.720> big<00:02:33.930> white<00:02:34.260> pile<00:02:34.769> of<00:02:34.980> powder<00:02:35.190> these

of this big white pile of powder these

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.150 
of this big white pile of powder these
individual<00:02:36.540> figures<00:02:36.870> from<00:02:37.590> there<00:02:37.799> we<00:02:37.950> clean

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
individual figures from there we clean

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.789 
individual figures from there we clean
them<00:02:38.280> off<00:02:38.690> do<00:02:39.690> some<00:02:39.840> post-processing<00:02:40.260> just

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
them off do some post-processing just

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:41.960 
them off do some post-processing just
make<00:02:40.950> sure<00:02:41.069> that<00:02:41.190> they<00:02:41.310> look<00:02:41.340> given<00:02:41.880> with

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
make sure that they look given with

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.050 
make sure that they look given with
their<00:02:42.060> clean<00:02:42.299> good<00:02:42.810> and<00:02:43.110> the<00:02:43.950> the<00:02:44.610> color<00:02:44.790> is

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
their clean good and the the color is

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.900 
their clean good and the the color is
included<00:02:45.599> so<00:02:45.799> it's<00:02:46.799> actually<00:02:47.099> from<00:02:47.489> a<00:02:47.610> printer

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
included so it's actually from a printer

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.699 
included so it's actually from a printer
that's<00:02:48.329> the<00:02:48.450> only<00:02:48.780> 3d<00:02:49.079> printer<00:02:49.319> that<00:02:49.349> does<00:02:49.590> the

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
that's the only 3d printer that does the

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.470 
that's the only 3d printer that does the
full<00:02:49.860> CMYK<00:02:50.340> range<00:02:50.730> of<00:02:50.849> colors<00:02:51.090> right<00:02:51.239> now
