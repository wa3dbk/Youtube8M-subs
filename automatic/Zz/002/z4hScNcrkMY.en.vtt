00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.309
 but the heart of the system from here we did not go to tinker with what we have 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:13.030
 at hand whoever is sometimes the most incredible they would not eat anymore 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.019
 nice cheese the same way after that 

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:19.839
 the heat the dust measures as the track opposite to the material the accidents 

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:23.429
 as many elements that make the mechanics suffer on a dakar problem 

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:26.889
 when the machine the champion 'deserted impossible to find a garage he 

00:00:26.889 --> 00:00:29.960
 has the necessary room then to rally the bivouac and be able to 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.589
 properly prepare competitors moving treasure 

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:35.589
 ingenuity 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.220
 how to fully rehabilitate a body with tape of a 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.220
 aesthetic but effective 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.860
 and even on the bivouac contacted this world 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.860
 you have to know how to manage with the means of the edge 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.190
 face of a bobbin run by the words of this meeting 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.860
 it's the Japanese technique 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.580
 to each culture its particular advantages in hacking 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.660
 we are talking about ten years ago that he concluded with the european commission 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:57.440
 worsen there is more to find something to repair the easy language is 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.440
 not to mention gorman common sense and so special 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.100
 happens to pass 

00:02:09.409 --> 00:02:11.959
 that is all 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:12.890
 so 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.890
 the fact that the most controversial nascent 

00:02:17.029 --> 00:02:20.029
 24 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:26.549
 especially in France 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:29.549
 so I think people stay on the ground 

00:02:31.249 --> 00:02:32.049
 it's more fun
