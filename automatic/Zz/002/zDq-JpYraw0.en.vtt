00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:36.000 
everything seemed way too difficult to
play<00:05:33.750> like<00:05:34.750> it<00:05:34.960> wasn't<00:05:35.260> registering<00:05:35.740> what<00:05:35.979> I

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.010 
play like it wasn't registering what I

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:38.670 
play like it wasn't registering what I
was<00:05:36.220> doing<00:05:36.690> that<00:05:37.690> may<00:05:37.810> be<00:05:37.840> because<00:05:37.960> that<00:05:38.500> at

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:38.680 
was doing that may be because that at

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.750 
was doing that may be because that at
the<00:05:38.830> time<00:05:38.979> I<00:05:39.039> rented<00:05:39.669> it<00:05:39.760> it<00:05:39.970> was<00:05:40.150> in<00:05:40.389> my<00:05:40.810> room

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:20.050 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:24.110 

i<00:06:20.110> also<00:06:20.800> have<00:06:21.099> super<00:06:21.550> mario<00:06:21.940> 64<00:06:22.539> for<00:06:23.169> the<00:06:23.259> d/s

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:24.120 
i also have super mario 64 for the d/s

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:27.480 
i also have super mario 64 for the d/s
not<00:06:25.120> very<00:06:25.360> far<00:06:25.690> and<00:06:25.840> it's<00:06:26.229> actually<00:06:26.949> harder

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:27.490 
not very far and it's actually harder

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:29.760 
not very far and it's actually harder
than<00:06:27.520> the<00:06:27.759> original<00:06:28.330> i<00:06:28.479> think<00:06:28.780> i<00:06:29.080> think<00:06:29.440> that's

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:29.770 
than the original i think i think that's

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:31.230 
than the original i think i think that's
because<00:06:29.860> of<00:06:29.979> the<00:06:30.099> DA's<00:06:30.430> controllers<00:06:30.909> and<00:06:31.120> that

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:31.240 
because of the DA's controllers and that

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:33.480 
because of the DA's controllers and that
you<00:06:31.930> have<00:06:32.080> to<00:06:32.229> have<00:06:32.379> different<00:06:33.159> characters

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:33.490 
you have to have different characters

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:34.589 
you have to have different characters
for<00:06:33.669> different<00:06:33.970> missions<00:06:34.300> stead<00:06:34.479> of<00:06:34.509> just

00:06:34.589 --> 00:06:34.599 
for different missions stead of just
