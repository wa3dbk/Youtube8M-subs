killed all our cats the only two or
three<00:00:57.020> of<00:00:57.170> them<00:00:57.289> survived<00:00:57.739> and<00:00:58.129> in<00:00:58.730> a<00:00:58.820> period

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 
three of them survived and in a period

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.500 
three of them survived and in a period
of<00:00:59.300> a<00:00:59.450> few<00:00:59.480> weeks<00:00:59.690> the<00:01:00.140> rat<00:01:00.350> population<00:01:00.590> just

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
of a few weeks the rat population just

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.719 
of a few weeks the rat population just
multiplied<00:01:02.510> and<00:01:03.140> I<00:01:03.320> would<00:01:03.530> go<00:01:04.160> in<00:01:04.339> the<00:01:04.489> barn

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729 
multiplied and I would go in the barn

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:07.630 
multiplied and I would go in the barn
and<00:01:05.630> when<00:01:05.780> the<00:01:05.810> rats<00:01:06.080> ran<00:01:06.350> down<00:01:06.649> I<00:01:06.860> track<00:01:07.340> over

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
and when the rats ran down I track over

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.359 
and when the rats ran down I track over
the<00:01:07.670> 22<00:01:08.240> and<00:01:08.270> shoot<00:01:09.080> him<00:01:09.110> we<00:01:09.770> have<00:01:09.979> in<00:01:10.250> the

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 
the 22 and shoot him we have in the

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:12.550 
the 22 and shoot him we have in the
house<00:01:10.550> to<00:01:10.910> the<00:01:11.149> from<00:01:11.509> time<00:01:11.720> to<00:01:11.869> time<00:01:11.899> I<00:01:12.289> just

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
house to the from time to time I just

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.020 
house to the from time to time I just
wasn't<00:01:12.740> allowed<00:01:13.070> to<00:01:13.100> shoot<00:01:13.430> him<00:01:13.610> in<00:01:13.700> the<00:01:13.729> house

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
wasn't allowed to shoot him in the house

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.510 
wasn't allowed to shoot him in the house
so<00:01:14.600> what<00:01:14.899> do<00:01:14.960> you<00:01:15.050> do<00:01:15.170> with<00:01:15.350> a<00:01:15.410> rat<00:01:15.830> well<00:01:16.190> first

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
so what do you do with a rat well first

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.820 
so what do you do with a rat well first
off<00:01:16.729> you<00:01:17.390> go<00:01:17.630> and<00:01:17.659> tell<00:01:17.900> your<00:01:18.170> dad<00:01:18.380> you<00:01:18.409> shot<00:01:18.799> a

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
off you go and tell your dad you shot a

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.250 
off you go and tell your dad you shot a
wrap<00:01:19.130> he'll<00:01:19.369> give<00:01:19.520> you<00:01:19.610> a<00:01:19.700> dime<00:01:19.909> so<00:01:20.720> I<00:01:20.750> decided

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:21.260 
wrap he'll give you a dime so I decided

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:22.990 
wrap he'll give you a dime so I decided
I'd<00:01:21.470> better<00:01:21.500> produce<00:01:21.950> proof<00:01:22.549> that<00:01:22.850> I<00:01:22.970> killed

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
I'd better produce proof that I killed

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.480 
I'd better produce proof that I killed
the<00:01:23.420> rats<00:01:23.659> I<00:01:24.049> looked<00:01:24.560> around<00:01:24.710> and<00:01:25.130> I<00:01:25.189> saw<00:01:25.460> a

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
the rats I looked around and I saw a

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.910 
the rats I looked around and I saw a
roll<00:01:25.820> of<00:01:26.030> binder<00:01:26.450> client<00:01:26.869> and<00:01:26.990> I<00:01:27.049> says<00:01:27.290> there's

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
roll of binder client and I says there's

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.210 
roll of binder client and I says there's
the<00:01:28.189> answer<00:01:28.509> make<00:01:29.509> Heinzman<00:01:30.049> Haven<00:01:30.710> noose<00:01:31.009> on

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
the answer make Heinzman Haven noose on

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.660 
the answer make Heinzman Haven noose on
one<00:01:31.520> end<00:01:31.840> reach<00:01:32.840> down<00:01:33.140> and<00:01:33.280> carefully<00:01:34.280> slip<00:01:34.549> it
