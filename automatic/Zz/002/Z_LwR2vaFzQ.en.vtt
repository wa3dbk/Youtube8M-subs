00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:09.549
 This is 

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:11.149
 there 

00:00:11.149 --> 00:00:15.779
 Hello I'm here anyway weighting in front of me members in front of me 

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:17.570
 is the new Ninety Nine 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.029
 our new weapon for the cross country race use 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.800
 he 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.640
 Dr 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.890
 the task at the construction of the new China was a 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.160
 anything but simple how can you be one of the best 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.720
 Weissenfels will make professionals in cross-country even better 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:41.150
 as strong as the layout of the market 6 scores in terms of weight and rigidity 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.390
 so clearly are the deficits in the field of cinematheque 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.560
 Markus Kranz will often not be able to maximize educational reforms 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.270
 Nevertheless, a foul should also make him excellent 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:53.190
 Federer 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.600
 and that's exactly where the new team starts 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.520
 as easy and as stiff as its predecessor but the 6 means clearly 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.520
 deform better suspension 

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.560
 r 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.180
 an important measure to improve the currency reform 1 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.550
 is the change in the position of the strut to the frame 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.550
 from May to 6 that would be at still below the euro 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.410
 Online there is a strut standing in front of the seat 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.320
 the bars location of the strut in front of the seat before guaranteed at all 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.320
 Frame heights a uniform kinematics 1

 I 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.420
 the play instinct and demanded from the position of the new piece behind the 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.610
 Bar order 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.920

 our raised significantly 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:49.120

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.910
 his 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:54.300
 a particularly effective measure to save weight is it components 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.230
 omit here therefore the lower strut intake with the 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.190
 swing Drepung summarized and could thus an attachment for 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:03.910
 Save strut 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:07.770
 the design that strives for is a part well managed at the front end 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.990
 All around, the 6 4 may possibly only be in contact with each other 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.559
 normally necessary to leave out 

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:17.709
 This allows us to achieve extremely four tire freedom 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:20.289
 to get enough clarity 

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:23.809

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:27.889
 with such a very strong spaces combined with excellent rigidity

 for an optimal constancy the and Martin Demichelis 

00:02:39.669 --> 00:02:43.090
 We worked with various test vehicles with different Blanco 

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:47.769

 Remote from the handlebars have brought the pay gap 

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:12.459
 this was our fat Steve on 19 9 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:15.199
 to put the fastest overall package on the wheels 

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:19.509
