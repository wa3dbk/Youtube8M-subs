freaking that was bad

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:44.090 
freaking that was bad
slippery<00:00:39.989> it<00:00:40.440> it<00:00:40.800> was<00:00:41.160> real<00:00:41.610> risky<00:00:42.230> so<00:00:43.230> I<00:00:43.620> put

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
this sucker on and big difference that's

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.840 
this sucker on and big difference that's
like<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.230> huge<00:00:49.680> table<00:00:50.690> to<00:00:51.690> put<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:52.020> trap<00:00:52.289> on<00:00:52.850> but

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
like a huge table to put the trap on but

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:15.440 
like a huge table to put the trap on but
basically<00:00:54.510> it's<00:00:54.870> just<00:01:11.150> and<00:01:12.590> I<00:01:14.060> did<00:01:15.060> two

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
basically it's just and I did two

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:27.800 
basically it's just and I did two
thicknesses<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:16.500> make<00:01:16.680> it<00:01:22.460> and<00:01:23.460> then<00:01:24.299> this<00:01:26.810> is

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
thicknesses to make it and then this is

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.740 
thicknesses to make it and then this is
actually<00:01:28.380> attached<00:01:28.770> with<00:01:29.220> some<00:01:29.430> metal<00:01:29.750> but

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
actually attached with some metal but

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.840 
actually attached with some metal but
the<00:01:30.900> edges<00:01:31.259> kept<00:01:31.530> cutting<00:01:31.829> my<00:01:32.040> hand<00:01:32.310> so<00:01:32.610> I<00:01:32.640> put

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
the edges kept cutting my hand so I put

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.660 
the edges kept cutting my hand so I put
the<00:01:32.939> duct<00:01:33.210> tape<00:01:33.299> on<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.810> protect<00:01:34.200> me<00:01:34.439> but<00:01:34.799> this

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
the duct tape on to protect me but this

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.249 
the duct tape on to protect me but this
is<00:01:35.880> actually<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:37.380> hook<00:01:38.100> onto<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.549> float<00:01:39.259> to

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
is actually to hook onto the float to

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:46.460 
is actually to hook onto the float to
hold<00:01:40.470> on<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:40.920> it<00:01:44.180> havin<00:01:45.180> comfort<00:01:45.810> while<00:01:46.259> you're

lickety-split cut your fate put it on

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:02.130 
lickety-split cut your fate put it on
the<00:03:55.340> float<00:03:55.840> and<00:03:57.520> it's<00:03:58.520> pretty<00:03:58.850> solid

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:11.910 

I<00:04:02.970> did<00:04:06.000> I<00:04:07.410> did<00:04:08.410> these<00:04:08.650> things<00:04:09.660> just<00:04:10.660> to<00:04:10.960> have<00:04:11.890> a

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 
I did I did these things just to have a

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.650 
I did I did these things just to have a
place<00:04:12.070> to<00:04:12.520> store<00:04:13.350> the<00:04:14.350> paddle<00:04:15.310> when<00:04:16.209> I<00:04:16.269> didn't

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
place to store the paddle when I didn't

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.160 
place to store the paddle when I didn't
need<00:04:16.810> it<00:04:16.870> like<00:04:17.290> when<00:04:17.530> I'm<00:04:17.650> dragging<00:04:17.950> it<00:04:18.400> or

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:19.170 
need it like when I'm dragging it or

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:22.200 
need it like when I'm dragging it or
when<00:04:20.170> it's<00:04:20.320> stored<00:04:20.739> or<00:04:21.100> you<00:04:21.609> know<00:04:21.760> actually

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
when it's stored or you know actually

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.410 
when it's stored or you know actually
when<00:04:22.420> I'm<00:04:22.540> fishing<00:04:22.870> on<00:04:23.830> an<00:04:24.040> anchor<00:04:24.400> and<00:04:25.240> I

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:25.420 
when I'm fishing on an anchor and I

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:28.410 
when I'm fishing on an anchor and I
don't<00:04:25.480> need<00:04:25.780> it<00:04:25.840> I<00:04:26.110> can<00:04:26.140> do<00:04:26.440> this<00:04:26.710> and<00:04:27.180> all<00:04:28.180> this

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:28.420 
don't need it I can do this and all this

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:30.990 
don't need it I can do this and all this
is<00:04:28.780> is<00:04:29.050> basically<00:04:29.620> I<00:04:29.740> think<00:04:30.100> it's<00:04:30.310> like<00:04:30.520> a<00:04:30.550> a

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
is is basically I think it's like a a

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.870 
is is basically I think it's like a a
broom<00:04:31.750> handle<00:04:32.290> or<00:04:32.440> something<00:04:32.500> mop<00:04:33.160> handle<00:04:33.700> for

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 
broom handle or something mop handle for

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.990 
broom handle or something mop handle for
the<00:04:36.880> closet<00:04:37.440> spring-loaded<00:04:38.440> dealer<00:04:38.830> at<00:04:39.820> the

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
the closet spring-loaded dealer at the

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.370 
the closet spring-loaded dealer at the
hardware<00:04:40.420> store<00:04:41.880> and<00:04:42.880> this<00:04:43.180> one<00:04:43.480> has<00:04:44.170> been

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:44.380 
hardware store and this one has been

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:45.390 
hardware store and this one has been
really<00:04:44.560> beat-up

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
really beat-up

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.840 
really beat-up
and<00:04:46.440> cut<00:04:47.440> the<00:04:47.590> crap<00:04:47.800> out<00:04:48.190> of<00:04:48.220> me<00:04:48.430> so<00:04:48.580> I<00:04:48.610> had<00:04:48.760> to

and cut the crap out of me so I had to

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:53.120 
and cut the crap out of me so I had to
put<00:04:49.000> duct<00:04:49.270> tape<00:04:49.300> on<00:04:49.810> it<00:04:50.790> it<00:04:51.790> still<00:04:52.150> works<00:04:52.420> so

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
put duct tape on it it still works so

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:59.700
