a<00:02:55.620> drone<00:02:56.280> strike<00:02:56.420> now<00:02:57.420> I<00:02:57.560> highly<00:02:58.560> highly

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
a drone strike now I highly highly

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.340 
a drone strike now I highly highly
highly<00:02:58.950> highly<00:02:59.370> highly<00:02:59.760> doubt<00:03:00.240> Rand<00:03:01.110> Paul<00:03:01.320> is

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
highly highly highly doubt Rand Paul is

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.410 
highly highly highly doubt Rand Paul is
talking<00:03:01.680> about<00:03:01.860> a<00:03:01.980> Hellfire<00:03:02.640> missile<00:03:02.670> drone

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
talking about a Hellfire missile drone

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.140 
talking about a Hellfire missile drone
strike<00:03:03.720> I'm<00:03:03.930> guessing<00:03:04.410> and<00:03:04.650> now<00:03:05.550> this<00:03:05.790> is<00:03:05.970> just

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
strike I'm guessing and now this is just

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.720 
strike I'm guessing and now this is just
my<00:03:06.300> speculation<00:03:06.540> and<00:03:07.320> a<00:03:07.650> lot<00:03:07.980> of<00:03:08.010> logic<00:03:08.550> I

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
my speculation and a lot of logic I

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.820 
my speculation and a lot of logic I
guess<00:03:09.060> Rand<00:03:09.780> Paul<00:03:09.960> is<00:03:09.990> talking<00:03:10.320> about<00:03:10.530> an

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
guess Rand Paul is talking about an

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.850 
guess Rand Paul is talking about an
armed<00:03:11.130> drones<00:03:11.550> say<00:03:11.910> with<00:03:12.150> a<00:03:12.420> rifle<00:03:12.990> some<00:03:13.620> type

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
armed drones say with a rifle some type

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.070 
armed drones say with a rifle some type
of<00:03:13.890> gun<00:03:14.520> or<00:03:14.760> firearm<00:03:15.270> on<00:03:15.420> the<00:03:15.540> front<00:03:15.810> of<00:03:15.930> it

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
of gun or firearm on the front of it

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.260 
of gun or firearm on the front of it
that<00:03:16.800> would<00:03:16.890> be<00:03:17.040> quite<00:03:17.250> a<00:03:17.340> bit<00:03:17.550> more<00:03:17.700> accurate

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.270 
that would be quite a bit more accurate

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:21.530 
that would be quite a bit more accurate
and<00:03:18.480> a<00:03:18.870> lot<00:03:19.050> less<00:03:19.080> collateral<00:03:19.800> damage<00:03:20.540> than

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
and a lot less collateral damage than

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.320 
and a lot less collateral damage than
say<00:03:22.170> a<00:03:22.200> Hellfire<00:03:22.710> missile<00:03:22.740> and<00:03:23.610> a<00:03:23.760> normal

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
say a Hellfire missile and a normal

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:25.670 
say a Hellfire missile and a normal
drone<00:03:24.600> strike<00:03:24.900> on<00:03:25.080> what<00:03:25.260> people<00:03:25.590> are

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
drone strike on what people are

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.620 
drone strike on what people are
programmed<00:03:26.160> to<00:03:26.370> think<00:03:26.400> in<00:03:26.850> their<00:03:27.000> head<00:03:27.180> when

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
programmed to think in their head when

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.690 
programmed to think in their head when
they<00:03:27.750> think<00:03:27.959> of<00:03:28.050> drone<00:03:28.320> strikes<00:03:28.350> and<00:03:28.950> Rand

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
they think of drone strikes and Rand

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.000 
they think of drone strikes and Rand
Paul<00:03:29.940> even<00:03:30.209> goes<00:03:30.540> on<00:03:30.810> to<00:03:31.050> talk<00:03:31.200> about<00:03:31.260> a<00:03:31.830> little

Paul even goes on to talk about a little
bit<00:03:32.130> more<00:03:32.490> about<00:03:32.760> how<00:03:33.600> he<00:03:33.660> doesn't<00:03:34.110> want

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
bit more about how he doesn't want

people that really do not have the right
to<00:03:43.950> do<00:03:44.070> it<00:03:44.220> because<00:03:44.370> the<00:03:44.640> fourth<00:03:44.880> man<00:03:45.060> protects

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
to do it because the fourth man protects

us<00:03:45.810> so<00:03:46.440> that<00:03:46.620> is<00:03:46.740> just<00:03:46.770> my<00:03:47.040> interpretation<00:03:47.190> of

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
us so that is just my interpretation of

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.100
