that's that's two four six eighty Watts
right<00:02:45.030> there<00:02:45.330> and<00:02:46.190> the<00:02:47.190> new<00:02:47.370> bulbs<00:02:47.940> these<00:02:48.360> new

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
right there and the new bulbs these new

00:02:48.600 --> 00:03:04.550 
right there and the new bulbs these new
LEDs<00:02:49.490> are<00:02:53.270> four<00:02:54.270> watt<00:03:00.530> so<00:03:01.530> that's<00:03:03.260> 80<00:03:04.260> Watts

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
LEDs are four watt so that's 80 Watts

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:11.950 
LEDs are four watt so that's 80 Watts
versus<00:03:05.340> 16<00:03:05.910> watts<00:03:06.830> with<00:03:07.830> the<00:03:08.010> LED<00:03:09.860> bulbs<00:03:10.860> and

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:11.960 
versus 16 watts with the LED bulbs and

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.390 
versus 16 watts with the LED bulbs and
I've<00:03:12.960> got<00:03:13.200> them<00:03:13.380> installed<00:03:13.740> I'm<00:03:14.040> installing

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
I've got them installed I'm installing

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.000 
I've got them installed I'm installing
them<00:03:14.700> in<00:03:14.790> the<00:03:14.880> dark<00:03:15.150> so<00:03:15.630> it'd<00:03:16.410> be<00:03:16.530> pretty<00:03:16.710> hard

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
them in the dark so it'd be pretty hard

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.920 
them in the dark so it'd be pretty hard
for<00:03:17.100> you<00:03:17.250> to<00:03:17.340> see<00:03:17.550> it<00:03:17.730> but<00:03:17.850> it's<00:03:18.000> just<00:03:18.060> a<00:03:18.330> it's

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
for you to see it but it's just a it's

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.340 
for you to see it but it's just a it's
just<00:03:19.110> two<00:03:19.290> wires<00:03:19.680> positive<00:03:20.340> and<00:03:20.490> a<00:03:20.520> negative

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
just two wires positive and a negative

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.980 
just two wires positive and a negative
these<00:03:22.350> incandescent<00:03:22.770> bulbs<00:03:23.460> are<00:03:23.670> not

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:23.990 
these incandescent bulbs are not

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:26.120 
these incandescent bulbs are not
polarity<00:03:24.990> sensitive<00:03:25.200> so<00:03:25.740> you<00:03:25.800> can<00:03:25.950> just

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
polarity sensitive so you can just

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.340 
polarity sensitive so you can just
install<00:03:26.310> them<00:03:26.730> either<00:03:26.880> way<00:03:27.180> but<00:03:27.900> the<00:03:28.560> LED

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
install them either way but the LED

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.710 
install them either way but the LED
bulbs<00:03:31.350> are<00:03:31.590> polarity<00:03:32.010> sensitive<00:03:32.460> so<00:03:33.330> there<00:03:33.570> is

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
bulbs are polarity sensitive so there is

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.300 
bulbs are polarity sensitive so there is
a<00:03:33.750> positive<00:03:34.290> and<00:03:34.410> a<00:03:34.470> negative<00:03:34.500> you<00:03:35.040> gotta<00:03:35.190> make

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
a positive and a negative you gotta make

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.640 
a positive and a negative you gotta make
sure<00:03:35.460> you<00:03:35.550> get<00:03:35.700> that<00:03:35.880> right

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:47.860 

do<00:03:40.650> it<00:03:40.770> before<00:03:40.890> shot<00:03:41.550> here

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.890 

okay<00:03:48.870> here's<00:03:49.110> an<00:03:49.230> after<00:03:49.650> shot<00:03:50.090> of<00:03:51.090> the<00:03:51.450> LED

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
okay here's an after shot of the LED

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.059 
okay here's an after shot of the LED
lights<00:03:52.170> I<00:03:52.790> can't<00:03:53.790> even<00:03:53.910> get<00:03:54.090> the<00:03:54.800> K<00:03:55.800> and<00:03:55.980> get

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 
lights I can't even get the K and get

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:58.970 
lights I can't even get the K and get
the<00:03:56.190> camera<00:03:56.520> to<00:03:56.550> focus<00:03:56.819> highly<00:03:57.650> because<00:03:58.650> these

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
the camera to focus highly because these

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.790 
the camera to focus highly because these
are<00:03:59.160> brighter<00:03:59.489> and<00:04:00.260> they're<00:04:01.260> regulating

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800 
are brighter and they're regulating

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.550 
are brighter and they're regulating
condensing<00:04:02.370> bulbs<00:04:02.640> I<00:04:02.730> just<00:04:02.940> took<00:04:03.060> out<00:04:03.560> so

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
condensing bulbs I just took out so

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.640 
condensing bulbs I just took out so
that's<00:04:04.739> awesome<00:04:04.890> I'm<00:04:05.370> a<00:04:05.400> little<00:04:05.700> afraid<00:04:05.910> that

are actually so bright that I was gonna

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.370 
are actually so bright that I was gonna
add<00:05:04.620> a<00:05:04.650> limit<00:05:04.979> light<00:05:05.310> under<00:05:06.000> the<00:05:06.030> shower<00:05:06.660> or

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 
add a limit light under the shower or

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.279 
add a limit light under the shower or
above<00:05:07.710> the<00:05:07.860> shower<00:05:08.070> and<00:05:08.630> I<00:05:09.630> don't<00:05:09.900> think<00:05:10.080> I'm

00:05:10.279 --> 00:05:10.289 
above the shower and I don't think I'm

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:11.210 
above the shower and I don't think I'm
gonna<00:05:10.410> do<00:05:10.590> that<00:05:10.770> now

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 
gonna do that now

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.370 
gonna do that now
I'm<00:05:11.970> just<00:05:12.180> gonna<00:05:12.300> save<00:05:12.600> that<00:05:12.960> the<00:05:13.200> eighth

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:13.380 
I'm just gonna save that the eighth

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:22.700 
I'm just gonna save that the eighth
light<00:05:14.840> for<00:05:16.880> an<00:05:17.880> extra<00:05:20.720> but<00:05:21.720> these<00:05:22.260> lights<00:05:22.500> are

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.710 
light for an extra but these lights are

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:28.460 
light for an extra but these lights are
way<00:05:22.860> better<00:05:23.510> way<00:05:24.510> better<00:05:25.640> they<00:05:26.640> are<00:05:27.200> they<00:05:28.200> run

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:28.470 
way better way better they are they run

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:33.250 
way better way better they are they run
cool<00:05:29.630> so<00:05:30.630> you<00:05:30.780> can<00:05:30.960> touch<00:05:31.140> you<00:05:32.090> ain't<00:05:33.090> gonna

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:33.260 
cool so you can touch you ain't gonna

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.930 
cool so you can touch you ain't gonna
burn<00:05:34.260> your<00:05:34.530> hand<00:05:34.770> like<00:05:35.100> those<00:05:35.340> incandescent

I<00:05:44.470> like<00:05:45.190> him<00:05:45.640> I<00:05:45.670> got<00:05:46.120> to<00:05:46.210> do<00:05:46.270> a<00:05:46.300> little<00:05:46.480> touch-up

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:46.810 
I like him I got to do a little touch-up

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:50.340 
I like him I got to do a little touch-up
with<00:05:47.800> the<00:05:47.890> paint<00:05:48.160> around<00:05:48.580> the<00:05:48.990> light<00:05:49.990> because

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:50.350 
with the paint around the light because

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:53.040 
with the paint around the light because
these<00:05:50.500> are<00:05:50.620> just<00:05:50.770> a<00:05:50.920> tiny<00:05:51.160> bit<00:05:51.550> smaller<00:05:52.540> in

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:53.050 
these are just a tiny bit smaller in

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:55.830 
these are just a tiny bit smaller in
diameter<00:05:53.230> than<00:05:53.740> the<00:05:53.980> I<00:05:54.460> went<00:05:55.120> ahead<00:05:55.300> in<00:05:55.480> there

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:55.840 
diameter than the I went ahead in there

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:03.590 
diameter than the I went ahead in there
and<00:05:57.150> this<00:05:58.150> warrior<00:06:01.080> not<00:06:02.080> even<00:06:02.350> getting<00:06:02.590> warm

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:03.600 
and this warrior not even getting warm

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.850 
and this warrior not even getting warm
before<00:06:04.600> it<00:06:04.750> was<00:06:04.840> getting<00:06:05.140> it<00:06:05.470> was<00:06:05.620> getting

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:05.860 
before it was getting it was getting

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:07.760 
before it was getting it was getting
pretty<00:06:06.010> warm<00:06:06.370> with<00:06:06.640> those<00:06:06.820> other<00:06:07.030> lights

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:07.770 
pretty warm with those other lights

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:14.520 
pretty warm with those other lights
actually<00:06:08.770> this<00:06:09.040> wire<00:06:09.280> is<00:06:09.520> cold<00:06:09.850> so<00:06:13.530> pretty

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:14.530 
actually this wire is cold so pretty

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:17.640 
actually this wire is cold so pretty
much<00:06:14.650> solved<00:06:15.070> all<00:06:15.220> my<00:06:15.250> problems<00:06:16.380> that<00:06:17.380> I

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:17.650 
much solved all my problems that I

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:22.250 
much solved all my problems that I
wanted<00:06:17.950> to<00:06:18.100> solve<00:06:18.310> and<00:06:19.320> I<00:06:20.320> got<00:06:20.800> brighter<00:06:21.130> light

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:22.260 
wanted to solve and I got brighter light

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:28.830 
wanted to solve and I got brighter light
so<00:06:23.260> I<00:06:24.180> guess<00:06:25.180> I<00:06:25.450> I<00:06:25.690> solve<00:06:26.200> problems<00:06:26.500> and<00:06:27.840> got

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:28.840 
so I guess I I solve problems and got

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:33.990 
so I guess I I solve problems and got
better<00:06:29.140> light<00:06:29.490> so<00:06:30.490> I<00:06:32.040> will<00:06:33.040> probably<00:06:33.640> end<00:06:33.760> up

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:34.000 
better light so I will probably end up

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.680 
better light so I will probably end up
selling<00:06:34.300> these<00:06:35.910> these<00:06:36.910> lights<00:06:37.240> I<00:06:37.390> got<00:06:37.570> I've

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:37.690 
selling these these lights I got I've

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:40.530 
selling these these lights I got I've
had<00:06:37.780> a<00:06:37.810> pretty<00:06:38.080> good<00:06:38.260> deal<00:06:38.500> and<00:06:39.330> they've<00:06:40.330> only

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:40.540 
had a pretty good deal and they've only

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:42.060 
had a pretty good deal and they've only
been<00:06:40.780> in<00:06:40.840> my<00:06:41.020> camper<00:06:41.530> here<00:06:41.710> while<00:06:41.890> I've<00:06:42.040> been

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:42.070 
been in my camper here while I've been

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:45.300 
been in my camper here while I've been
building<00:06:42.430> it<00:06:42.820> so<00:06:43.060> I<00:06:43.530> might<00:06:44.530> put<00:06:44.860> these<00:06:45.010> up<00:06:45.190> for

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:45.310 
building it so I might put these up for

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:48.900 
building it so I might put these up for
sale<00:06:45.580> and<00:06:45.880> pay<00:06:46.810> for<00:06:47.050> most<00:06:47.230> of<00:06:47.470> this<00:06:47.730> won't<00:06:48.730> did

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:48.910 
sale and pay for most of this won't did

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:57.680 
sale and pay for most of this won't did
he'd<00:06:49.000> LED<00:06:51.030> lights<00:06:52.030> that<00:06:52.330> I<00:06:52.420> put<00:06:52.660> in<00:06:55.800> so<00:06:56.800> I<00:06:56.830> guess

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:57.690 
he'd LED lights that I put in so I guess

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:01.590 
he'd LED lights that I put in so I guess
it's<00:06:58.690> on<00:06:58.840> to<00:06:58.870> the<00:06:59.080> next<00:06:59.320> thing
