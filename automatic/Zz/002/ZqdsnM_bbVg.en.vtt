I'll<00:00:48.890> just<00:00:49.040> be<00:00:49.159> concentrating<00:00:49.640> on<00:00:49.699> lean<00:00:49.909> lean

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
I'll just be concentrating on lean lean

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.380 
I'll just be concentrating on lean lean
the<00:00:50.690> bike<00:00:50.839> on<00:00:51.019> this<00:00:51.110> inside<00:00:51.470> leg<00:00:51.710> and<00:00:52.390> putting

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
the bike on this inside leg and putting

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:54.939 
the bike on this inside leg and putting
this<00:00:53.449> leg<00:00:53.690> out<00:00:53.900> at<00:00:54.110> a<00:00:54.140> slight<00:00:54.409> angle<00:00:54.440> so<00:00:54.799> you

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:54.949 
this leg out at a slight angle so you

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:56.740 
this leg out at a slight angle so you
can<00:00:55.100> lean<00:00:55.280> the<00:00:55.309> bike<00:00:55.549> all<00:00:56.210> the<00:00:56.269> way<00:00:56.479> through

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
can lean the bike all the way through

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.869 
can lean the bike all the way through
the<00:00:56.839> corner<00:00:57.199> if<00:00:57.739> your<00:00:58.010> body<00:00:58.159> leans<00:00:58.430> in<00:00:58.610> as<00:00:58.729> well

00:00:58.869 --> 00:00:58.879 
the corner if your body leans in as well

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:00.219 
the corner if your body leans in as well
he<00:00:59.030> ended<00:00:59.210> up<00:00:59.299> going<00:00:59.449> into<00:00:59.629> the<00:00:59.750> corner<00:01:00.110> and

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:00.229 
he ended up going into the corner and

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:02.200 
he ended up going into the corner and
carry<00:01:00.589> on<00:01:00.739> lean<00:01:00.920> in<00:01:01.129> and<00:01:01.430> just<00:01:01.699> do<00:01:01.820> one<00:01:02.089> big

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
carry on lean in and just do one big

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:03.969 
carry on lean in and just do one big
loop<00:01:02.510> and<00:01:02.690> going<00:01:02.869> back<00:01:03.019> down<00:01:03.229> so<00:01:03.710> you've<00:01:03.860> got

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:03.979 
loop and going back down so you've got

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:44.080 
standing right in the middle of bike and
just<00:01:40.759> feed<00:01:40.969> the<00:01:41.119> power<00:01:41.299> on<00:01:42.729> just<00:01:43.729> feed<00:01:43.909> it<00:01:43.999> in

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
just feed the power on just feed it in

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.120 
just feed the power on just feed it in
nice<00:01:44.270> and<00:01:44.479> easy<00:01:44.600> and<00:01:45.320> as<00:01:45.439> it<00:01:45.560> gets<00:01:45.679> to<00:01:45.829> the<00:01:45.920> top

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
nice and easy and as it gets to the top

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.370 
nice and easy and as it gets to the top
it<00:01:46.340> starts<00:01:46.520> getting<00:01:46.939> a<00:01:47.149> fair<00:01:47.780> bit<00:01:47.929> steeper<00:01:48.289> and

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
it starts getting a fair bit steeper and

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.919 
it starts getting a fair bit steeper and
stony<00:01:48.679> so<00:01:49.280> a<00:01:49.310> probably<00:01:49.609> start<00:01:49.819> spinning<00:01:50.119> so<00:01:50.840> if

00:01:50.919 --> 00:01:50.929 
stony so a probably start spinning so if

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:52.599 
stony so a probably start spinning so if
it<00:01:51.020> starts<00:01:51.109> spinning<00:01:51.530> there's<00:01:52.249> not<00:01:52.429> a<00:01:52.460> lot

00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:52.609 
it starts spinning there's not a lot

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:54.069 
it starts spinning there's not a lot
else<00:01:52.700> you<00:01:52.850> can<00:01:52.969> do<00:01:53.090> apart<00:01:53.210> from<00:01:53.420> increase<00:01:53.840> the

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:54.079 
else you can do apart from increase the

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:56.919 
else you can do apart from increase the
the<00:01:54.880> revs<00:01:55.880> and<00:01:56.060> start<00:01:56.329> bounced<00:01:56.630> up<00:01:56.689> and<00:01:56.780> down

00:01:56.919 --> 00:01:56.929 
the revs and start bounced up and down

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:58.840 
the revs and start bounced up and down
on<00:01:57.049> the<00:01:57.079> back<00:01:57.229> wheel<00:01:57.439> and<00:01:58.189> just<00:01:58.219> hope<00:01:58.520> it<00:01:58.670> digs

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
on the back wheel and just hope it digs

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.090 
on the back wheel and just hope it digs
in<00:01:58.999> somewhere<00:01:59.390> and<00:01:59.600> pushes<00:02:00.140> you<00:02:00.229> forward<00:02:00.439> then

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
in somewhere and pushes you forward then

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.010 
in somewhere and pushes you forward then
just<00:02:01.340> carry<00:02:01.579> on<00:02:01.640> out<00:02:01.819> to<00:02:01.939> the<00:02:02.030> top<00:02:02.240> all<00:02:02.960> the

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
just carry on out to the top all the

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.050 
just carry on out to the top all the
time<00:02:03.409> is<00:02:03.619> it<00:02:03.740> gets<00:02:03.889> a<00:02:03.950> little<00:02:04.039> lit<00:02:04.280> little

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
time is it gets a little lit little

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.249 
time is it gets a little lit little
steeper<00:02:05.479> the<00:02:05.600> foot<00:02:05.719> we<00:02:05.840> will<00:02:05.929> be<00:02:05.990> trying<00:02:06.200> to

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:06.259 
steeper the foot we will be trying to

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:08.169 
steeper the foot we will be trying to
come<00:02:06.409> off<00:02:06.560> so<00:02:07.189> I'll<00:02:07.340> be<00:02:07.460> just<00:02:07.579> pulling<00:02:07.880> myself

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
come off so I'll be just pulling myself

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
forward slightly on the handlebars

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:10.630 
forward slightly on the handlebars
trying<00:02:09.649> to<00:02:09.710> keep<00:02:09.830> the<00:02:09.890> foot<00:02:10.039> wheel<00:02:10.190> down

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
trying to keep the foot wheel down

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.390 
trying to keep the foot wheel down
we've<00:02:11.240> got<00:02:11.360> me<00:02:11.450> very<00:02:11.830> aware<00:02:12.830> that<00:02:13.010> if<00:02:13.160> you<00:02:13.250> do

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
we've got me very aware that if you do

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.550 
we've got me very aware that if you do
this<00:02:13.550> obviously<00:02:14.000> you<00:02:14.300> lose<00:02:14.450> a<00:02:14.480> little<00:02:15.349> bit<00:02:15.470> of

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
this obviously you lose a little bit of

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.170 
this obviously you lose a little bit of
grip<00:02:15.739> from<00:02:15.830> the<00:02:15.980> rear<00:02:16.099> wheel<00:02:16.280> so<00:02:16.459> all<00:02:16.580> the<00:02:16.700> time

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
grip from the rear wheel so all the time

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.640 
grip from the rear wheel so all the time
you<00:02:17.540> just<00:02:17.659> got<00:02:17.750> me<00:02:17.840> finding<00:02:18.080> the<00:02:18.170> compromise

leaning<00:02:44.740> let's<00:02:45.730> see<00:02:45.820> how<00:02:45.910> it<00:02:46.030> goes<00:02:46.120> this<00:02:46.300> time

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.590 

he<00:02:50.740> gets<00:02:50.860> his<00:02:51.040> speed<00:02:51.310> now<00:02:51.490> it<00:02:52.090> turns<00:02:52.300> into<00:02:52.510> the

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
he gets his speed now it turns into the

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.000 
he gets his speed now it turns into the
corner<00:02:53.460> that<00:02:54.460> was<00:02:54.550> a<00:02:54.580> lot<00:02:54.760> better<00:02:56.010> it's

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
corner that was a lot better it's

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.970 
corner that was a lot better it's
fighting<00:02:57.370> it<00:02:57.430> now<00:02:57.580> at<00:02:57.670> the<00:02:57.760> top
