00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019 
just haven't got around to it yet but

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:58.190 
just haven't got around to it yet but
this<00:02:55.019> is<00:02:55.370> control<00:02:56.370> and<00:02:56.820> it<00:02:56.880> has<00:02:56.970> a<00:02:57.019> custom<00:02:58.019> UI

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
this is control and it has a custom UI

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.199

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
that just glitched like that I think my

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.650 
that just glitched like that I think my
computer<00:03:05.310> just<00:03:06.110> maxed<00:03:07.110> out<00:03:07.200> CPU<00:03:07.739> so<00:03:08.120> um<00:03:09.120> that's

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
computer just maxed out CPU so um that's

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.170 
computer just maxed out CPU so um that's
really<00:03:10.019> I'm<00:03:10.230> gonna<00:03:10.350> change<00:03:10.620> the<00:03:10.940> level<00:03:11.940> quick
