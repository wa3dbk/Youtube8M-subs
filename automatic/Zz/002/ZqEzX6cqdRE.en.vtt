00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.260 

as<00:01:35.960> I<00:01:36.170> said<00:01:36.410> before<00:01:36.590> we're<00:01:37.520> going<00:01:37.790> to<00:01:37.880> be<00:01:38.030> using

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
as I said before we're going to be using

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.450 
as I said before we're going to be using
russets<00:01:39.020> to<00:01:39.230> make<00:01:39.410> our<00:01:39.560> left<00:01:39.920> such<00:01:40.130> a<00:01:40.160> day

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
russets to make our left such a day

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.510 
russets to make our left such a day
because<00:01:41.060> russets<00:01:41.690> are<00:01:41.870> high<00:01:42.200> in<00:01:42.590> starch<00:01:43.100> and

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
because russets are high in starch and

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.240 
because russets are high in starch and
low<00:01:43.940> in<00:01:44.270> moisture<00:01:44.570> and<00:01:45.020> that<00:01:45.590> gives<00:01:45.890> us<00:01:46.040> the

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
low in moisture and that gives us the

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.670 
low in moisture and that gives us the
nice<00:01:46.430> tender<00:01:46.940> quality<00:01:47.810> we<00:01:47.990> like<00:01:48.260> to<00:01:48.440> have

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 
nice tender quality we like to have

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.190 
nice tender quality we like to have
today<00:01:49.400> I'm<00:01:49.729> going<00:01:49.970> to<00:01:50.060> need<00:01:50.240> about<00:01:50.510> four

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
today I'm going to need about four

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.550 
today I'm going to need about four
pounds<00:01:51.500> of<00:01:51.950> potatoes<00:01:52.850> for<00:01:53.180> this<00:01:53.479> recipe<00:01:53.630> for

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
pounds of potatoes for this recipe for

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.530 
pounds of potatoes for this recipe for
those<00:01:54.710> of<00:01:54.890> you<00:01:55.010> keeping<00:01:55.220> score<00:01:55.430> that's<00:01:56.270> about

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
those of you keeping score that's about

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.160 
those of you keeping score that's about
10<00:01:56.869> to<00:01:57.080> 12<00:01:57.350> medium-sized<00:01:58.280> spuds<00:01:58.910> and<00:01:59.210> you<00:01:59.930> try

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
10 to 12 medium-sized spuds and you try

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.260 
10 to 12 medium-sized spuds and you try
to<00:02:00.229> cut<00:02:00.560> them<00:02:00.680> about<00:02:01.100> the<00:02:01.340> same<00:02:01.550> size<00:02:01.910> so<00:02:02.240> that

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
to cut them about the same size so that

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.150 
to cut them about the same size so that
they<00:02:02.570> get<00:02:02.869> done<00:02:03.080> cooking<00:02:03.320> at<00:02:03.619> the<00:02:03.740> same<00:02:03.890> time

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:04.160 
they get done cooking at the same time

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.040 
they get done cooking at the same time
and<00:02:04.340> that<00:02:04.369> makes<00:02:04.610> it<00:02:04.729> a<00:02:04.820> lot<00:02:05.030> easier<00:02:05.360> to<00:02:05.660> race

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.050 
and that makes it a lot easier to race

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.250 
and that makes it a lot easier to race
them

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:10.260 

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.620 

now<00:02:11.260> after<00:02:11.440> about<00:02:11.830> 15<00:02:12.460> minutes<00:02:12.490> you'll<00:02:13.390> need

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
now after about 15 minutes you'll need

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.930 
now after about 15 minutes you'll need
to<00:02:13.780> check<00:02:14.140> them<00:02:14.380> for<00:02:14.410> doneness<00:02:14.890> and<00:02:15.310> they

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
to check them for doneness and they

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.830 
to check them for doneness and they
should<00:02:16.330> be<00:02:16.660> about<00:02:17.500> fork-tender<00:02:18.540> but<00:02:19.540> don't

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
should be about fork-tender but don't

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.480 
should be about fork-tender but don't
let<00:02:20.050> them<00:02:20.200> cook<00:02:20.410> too<00:02:20.620> long<00:02:20.860> because<00:02:21.100> you<00:02:21.250> don't

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
let them cook too long because you don't

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.550 
let them cook too long because you don't
want<00:02:21.700> them<00:02:21.850> to<00:02:22.030> get<00:02:22.180> mushy<00:02:22.540> now<00:02:23.230> these<00:02:23.350> look

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
want them to get mushy now these look

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.740 
want them to get mushy now these look
about<00:02:23.830> right<00:02:24.100> so<00:02:24.970> I<00:02:25.000> think<00:02:25.120> it's<00:02:25.360> time<00:02:25.570> to

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
about right so I think it's time to

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:32.000 
about right so I think it's time to
drain<00:02:25.990> them

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.100 

it's<00:02:33.010> a<00:02:33.130> good<00:02:33.310> idea<00:02:33.700> to<00:02:33.970> let<00:02:34.150> the<00:02:34.209> potatoes<00:02:34.810> sit

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
it's a good idea to let the potatoes sit

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.680 
it's a good idea to let the potatoes sit
for<00:02:35.410> a<00:02:35.440> few<00:02:35.739> minutes<00:02:36.130> to<00:02:36.580> let<00:02:36.760> off<00:02:36.970> the<00:02:37.180> excess

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
for a few minutes to let off the excess

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.170 
for a few minutes to let off the excess
moisture<00:02:37.950> excess<00:02:38.950> moisture<00:02:39.220> is<00:02:39.670> the<00:02:39.819> death<00:02:40.000> of

good lefse don't you know that's for
sure<00:02:42.330> now<00:02:43.330> it's<00:02:43.569> time<00:02:43.840> to<00:02:44.140> begin<00:02:44.620> racing<00:02:45.430> your

sure now it's time to begin racing your

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.940 
sure now it's time to begin racing your
potatoes<00:02:46.060> it's<00:02:46.750> very<00:02:47.170> important<00:02:47.709> to<00:02:47.800> have<00:02:47.890> a

potatoes it's very important to have a

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.949 
potatoes it's very important to have a
good<00:02:48.370> quality<00:02:48.970> ricer

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
good quality ricer

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.920 
good quality ricer
because<00:02:50.500> racing<00:02:51.190> makes<00:02:51.910> the<00:02:52.090> potatoes<00:02:52.540> so

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
because racing makes the potatoes so

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.170 
because racing makes the potatoes so
much<00:02:53.170> smoother<00:02:53.680> than<00:02:53.709> mashing<00:02:54.430> and<00:02:54.760> it

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
much smoother than mashing and it

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.059 
much smoother than mashing and it
doesn't<00:02:55.540> shred<00:02:55.810> them<00:02:55.989> to<00:02:56.170> smithereens<00:02:56.440> like<00:02:57.040> a

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:57.069 
doesn't shred them to smithereens like a

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:59.850
