might<00:01:51.270> be<00:01:51.390> on<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.600> center<00:01:51.840> of<00:01:51.960> a<00:01:52.020> table<00:01:52.409> so

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
might be on the center of a table so

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.010 
might be on the center of a table so
imagine<00:01:53.729> walking<00:01:54.149> around<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.570> table<00:01:54.869> and

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
thing to do is to group them so here I

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.930 
thing to do is to group them so here I
already<00:02:20.420> have<00:02:20.600> one<00:02:20.840> completed<00:02:21.380> and<00:02:21.850> so<00:02:22.850> you

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
already have one completed and so you

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.180 
already have one completed and so you
can<00:02:23.090> see<00:02:23.270> we<00:02:23.390> have<00:02:23.510> two<00:02:23.840> and<00:02:24.170> then<00:02:24.590> mixing<00:02:25.010> in

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
can see we have two and then mixing in

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.250 
can see we have two and then mixing in
the<00:02:25.370> candle<00:02:25.730> lights<00:02:25.880> and<00:02:26.150> once<00:02:26.540> again<00:02:26.660> we're

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
the candle lights and once again we're

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:28.840 
the candle lights and once again we're
using<00:02:27.290> the<00:02:27.590> the<00:02:28.040> battery-powered<00:02:28.430> Electric

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
using the the battery-powered Electric

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.260 
using the the battery-powered Electric
so<00:02:29.840> just<00:02:30.110> staggering<00:02:30.920> those<00:02:31.190> and<00:02:31.520> this<00:02:32.060> we

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
so just staggering those and this we

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.090 
so just staggering those and this we
have<00:02:32.420> three<00:02:32.750> and<00:02:33.110> you<00:02:33.350> can<00:02:33.500> imagine<00:02:33.680> how<00:02:33.980> this

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
have three and you can imagine how this

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.070 
have three and you can imagine how this
would<00:02:34.310> look<00:02:34.550> on<00:02:34.730> a<00:02:34.760> mantel<00:02:35.330> or<00:02:35.570> right<00:02:35.780> down<00:02:35.960> the

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
would look on a mantel or right down the

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.060 
would look on a mantel or right down the
center<00:02:36.200> of<00:02:36.350> your<00:02:36.440> table

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
center of your table

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.250 
center of your table
I've<00:02:37.820> also<00:02:38.210> incorporated<00:02:38.780> again<00:02:39.020> with<00:02:39.170> the

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
I've also incorporated again with the

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.380 
I've also incorporated again with the
birch<00:02:39.440> wood<00:02:39.680> these<00:02:40.190> birch<00:02:40.550> wood<00:02:40.730> stacked<00:02:41.090> logs
