00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:27.890
 very bad it's raining it's all 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.750
 cold cloudy has made us make a 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.599
 which usually makes a lot of insurance 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.130
 in the Italian houses that is cooking and 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:36.680
 let's cook today I'm going to make you 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:39.920
 we are going to prepare some york and they are 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:42.680
 a kind of pasta but it's not pasta 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.179
 pasta is from arne de patata we are all going to 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.980
 to make it homemade at home we have not done it 

00:00:44.179 --> 00:00:48.289
 never in life that you had me 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.640
 little recipes that grandma has 

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:52.070
 my being paulson and what is sending 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.510
 online to see how it works and what 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.269
 let's do so that others also 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.460
 you see how it is done that does not seem to seem 

00:00:56.269 --> 00:01:00.499
 that is not that complicated but I guess 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.809
 that will have your little things so that 

00:01:00.499 --> 00:01:04.400
 know good but let's try it so 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:07.180
 you can implement at home so 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:10.210
 let's go with it let's start 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:14.200
 how to make them my ocher in another video 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:16.030
 I will show soon make the ragout to 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.460
 the sauce that will go with those niouky 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.680
 but today we are going to see how to make the pasta 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.450
 of the gnocchi that you can make then 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.090
 also at home then we go with these 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.940
 Niouky homemade four 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:34.510
 people who are going to need a kilo 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:37.060
 of potatoes flour and an egg we are going to 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:41.280
 start by putting the water to boil because 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.280
 let's go put the potatoes 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.770
 well that is boiling we put the 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.560
 potatoes be careful not to burn us 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:57.610
 hands with water jump 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:02:03.100
 we put them with skin we will leave it there 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:05.229
 until they are fully cooked one 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.600
 once we know them, we will take them out we will try 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:09.580
 remove the skin of the potato have a lot 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.290
 be careful because obviously they will burn like this 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:15.940
 that I help myself from a fork of 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:17.560
 we are going to let them cool because 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:21.730
 unless you are not going to be able to work the dough 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:24.670
 will be possible and once the 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.650
 we have to crush crumble 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:31.019
 grind as you want the mother to 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.019
 make like a kind of potato dough 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.739
 then we are going to add the flour I do not 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.299
 I added all the flour added a little and 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:39.099
 then I was adding more according to what 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:44.560
 dedicate the mass of the lid because if not 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:48.030
 afterwards it is very hard and we are also going 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.030
 to add that egg 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:55.510
 we started to knead that potato dough 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:58.810
 Carefully, delicately, you do not have to 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.910
 give you a lot of movement little by little 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.190
 will be integrated depends on enough 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.140
 a little done that is the potato what 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.640
 ideal is that it is enough so it is not 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.220
 you should have problems I had 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:12.810
 problems because I stayed a little 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.810
 Raw the potato into account after 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:18.700
 work it and knead it put the 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.150
 elements and there should be something like that 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.150
 that little ball 

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:32.359
 let's cut a piece of that dough and 

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:34.400
 we're going to do it and we're going to do it 

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:36.109
 roll on itself making a 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.409
 kind of cylinder like when you're 

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:42.260
 small to your country to have fun a lot 

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:44.209
 you roll it and roll it until you have 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:48.469
 Measure the size you want to 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:50.900
 your mine that once we have them 

00:03:48.469 --> 00:03:53.209
 you just have to cut the 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:04:02.239
 days if we already have our own ones that are 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:04:04.250
 like a few squares these we have to 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:06.379
 create that relief for me to take this 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.389
 relief so that the sauce gets better 

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:10.609
 inside me here as much more flavor 

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:12.199
 then I will do it with a 

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:13.699
 cheese grater I'll pass it by 

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:15.379
 what is rolling on itself 

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:17.989
 over the cheese grater here goes to 

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:20.120
 take that relief you can also 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:22.639
 use other variants such as press or 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:25.780
 a fork to give that relief and 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:25.780
 do turn on itself 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:05:15.160
 and because 

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:32.710
 an Italian Italian manuela so 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:37.060
 those photos more photos 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:37.060
 a kiss good weeks
