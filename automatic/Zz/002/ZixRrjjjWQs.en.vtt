got<00:00:27.119> this<00:00:27.240> end<00:00:27.449> put<00:00:27.539> together<00:00:27.869> and<00:00:28.670> then<00:00:29.670> let's

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
got this end put together and then let's

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.040 
got this end put together and then let's
just<00:00:30.119> go<00:00:30.240> ahead<00:00:30.269> and<00:00:30.449> we'll<00:00:30.689> connect<00:00:30.960> this

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
other end and then we will talk about

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.080 
other end and then we will talk about
the<00:00:34.050> other<00:00:34.200> chains<00:00:34.559> so<00:00:35.190> you<00:00:35.280> simply<00:00:35.579> just<00:00:35.880> take

the other chains so you simply just take

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.030 
the other chains so you simply just take
the<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.750> loops<00:00:36.989> that<00:00:37.140> are<00:00:37.200> already<00:00:37.380> come<00:00:37.649> onto

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
the the loops that are already come onto

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.160 
the the loops that are already come onto
the<00:00:38.280> bead<00:00:38.579> chain<00:00:39.000> and<00:00:39.300> stick<00:00:39.930> them<00:00:39.989> through

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
the bead chain and stick them through

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:47.420 
the bead chain and stick them through
the<00:00:40.260> jump<00:00:40.440> ring

so now you can see I've got one long

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.870 
so now you can see I've got one long
chain<00:02:36.400> from<00:02:37.060> those<00:02:37.240> pieces<00:02:37.510> and<00:02:38.670> the<00:02:39.670> cute

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
thing about this one too is that it's a

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:42.630 
thing about this one too is that it's a
little<00:02:41.320> bit<00:02:41.560> off-center<00:02:42.100> the<00:02:42.250> way<00:02:42.340> that<00:02:42.520> the

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
little bit off-center the way that the

twist on the design now the next thing

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.840 
twist on the design now the next thing
we're<00:02:50.110> going<00:02:50.140> to<00:02:50.260> do<00:02:50.410> is<00:02:50.560> take<00:02:50.770> our<00:02:50.980> extender

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
chain and we're going to connect it to

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.010 
chain and we're going to connect it to
each<00:02:54.370> end<00:02:54.760> of<00:02:55.060> the<00:02:55.150> brass<00:02:55.330> chain<00:02:55.600> so<00:02:55.810> you<00:02:55.900> can

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.020 
each end of the brass chain so you can

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:57.120 
each end of the brass chain so you can
see<00:02:56.170> how<00:02:56.200> it's<00:02:56.470> going<00:02:56.590> to<00:02:56.650> lay<00:02:56.800> out<00:02:56.950> right
