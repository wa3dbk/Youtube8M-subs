00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 then we will continue with rostock 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.810
 maybe they will become chemnitz and book 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.280
 say where is derby it is yes 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.360
 not really with hansa 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.269
 you can see that a little bit differently 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.580
 it is a very important ostduell and 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.230
 this is the top priority at rostock 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.210
 to-do list like a look at their 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.880
 homepage makes it clear that there is 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.260
 example red white erfurt listed 10 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.920
 you have won the pairing 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:28.500
 hook it then hall 2.1 rb leipzig 2 1 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.900
 both games ticked off so missing 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.210
 actually only in today's chemnitz 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.520
 the collection and that is a real one 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:39.380
 hook because meanwhile hansa seems 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.380
 Rostock lost his composure 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:45.690
 when a dream becomes a burden 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.579
 since then the evil word has risen in 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.379
 all mouth is missing the playful 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.420
 hansa trainer finds ease 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.440
 andreas miner just a victory out of the 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.410
 last six play 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.230
 So it goes easy on dream second 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.210
 league so the word must be out of your head 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.550
 today against chemnitz in the red 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.020
 jerseys the tables-18 free kick 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:09.280
 garbuschewski down 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.659
 1 0 for the guests in the tenth minute 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.060
 a gift for the weakest 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:16.789
 offensive of the league rupprecht rostocks 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.850
 defender kneels his own 

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:22.479
 team untenable for hansa-keeper 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.479
 trade 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:29.810
 195 tallest in the squad 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:32.130
 steven ruprecht unhappy successful 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.930
 Chemnitz earns in the wake of the 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.790
 defensively very strong now 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.720
 compact front now and then dangerous 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.720
 stenzel 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:48.880
 jÃ¶rg hamel with powerful machines 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.159
 just before the break hansa over a long way 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.150
 unbelievably unimaginative but up 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:54.150
 once something works 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:02.170
 Peter Wally wife suddenly football 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:08.590
 Suddenly the compensation suddenly succeeds 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:12.970
 in the 42 minute no offside bushel 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:15.480
 and with the 31 it picks up and then it is 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:20.230
 simply unfocused in the duel with 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:22.480
 fullback jan chabera the pure 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.849
 psychologically perfect time of this 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.830
 compensated for hansa after the 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:31.900
 page change much more self-confident 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:37.810
 purposeful pass from the back room with 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:39.730
 24 seconds after re-start Rostock 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.970
 has the part meanwhile firmly in the 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.970
 Handle 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:48.270
 because I also heartily fink between 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:52.980
 sounds with an idea sounds with the 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:55.230
 ingenious implementation the re-leadership 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:58.440
 for the chemnitz this time through 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:01.080
 anton finch the two-time scorer 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.000
 king of the third league but is back 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:07.230
 it's a present from hansas this time 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.010
 other defender of course two 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.520
 error 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:14.480
 two times bitter evil punished for 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.480
 utilize 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:23.990
 dana hansa in the duration attack mode of the 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:26.030
 chip on jacobs 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:28.510
 Pentke in between the chance for 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:32.150
 djokovic 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:35.660
 hofrat clarifies on the line chemnitz aid 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:38.540
 the leadership and that would be so important for 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:40.430
 him for the guest trainer almost my the 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.710
 bank in rostock is stuck but its 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.720
 chair wobbled the sports director was 

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:46.370
 already exchanged during the week one 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.780
 maybe already dependent on the job 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:53.660
 today's result 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:56.240
 72 minutes again college a half 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:58.790
 meter lacks the time for the 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:03.890
 table fourth again 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:06.740
 hansa ruprecht and back on the line 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:09.800
 saved this time through live shows 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:12.890
 past it remains at 1 2 of the first 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:15.340
 Three for Chemnitz in 2014. Rostock 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:17.600
 On the other hand loses the connection to the top 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.850
 So a chance to ascend comes 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.620
 not so often in life and that should 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:22.670
 should not take the ease 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.710
 but actually the looseness still 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:26.420
 Bring because I believe in when you are in 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.860
 chemnitz situation then is the 

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:28.910
 printing much much bigger than the pressure 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.800
 we do not have any 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.330
 but we have fun or we have fun 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.500
 should have fun but currently bring 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.870
 we are not in the square and that is 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.430
 that is the worst if a dream 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.860
 the burden is then lost 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.990
 just like that and 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:44.349
 of course, such games as today hansa 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:46.599
 rostock hansa got stuck somehow 

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:47.169
 Six games this year and only one 

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:49.180
 victory 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:50.379
 it will be very difficult up there 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.090
 to attack 

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:53.530
 after austria we will continue 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:55.689
 again with a real derby 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:59.250
 okay you have to say stuttgart and 

00:04:55.689 --> 00:04:59.250
 Heidenheim are still held
