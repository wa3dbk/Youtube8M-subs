00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:04.480
None of us want to be tied to a wall constantly
needing to charge our phone, but we want a

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:10.320
capable smartphone, the Xperia E4 that offers
a 5” display and 2 day battery life for

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.719
less than £100 sounds ideal.

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.480
At the budget end of the scale the E4 is ideal
as a first smartphone or if you are looking

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.210
for something that offers functionality without
the high price tag.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.380
If English is not your native language use

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.060
review that accompanys this video head to

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.840
Whilst the E4 might not be groundbreaking,
it has some desirable features which are shown

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.720
on screen now.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:43.220
In hand the E4 feels comfortable and solid
and the bezel around the screen and edge of

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:48.450
the device whilst slightly odd actually gives
something for your fingertips to grab onto.

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.730
Whilst I would have prefered to see the microUSB
port on the bottom, the power and volume keys

00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:00.210
are ideally placed and the inclusion of a
microSD card slot is great to see.

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.780
At 5” the screen allows you to see and do
more. Viewing web pages is better than a smaller

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:11.560
screen and working on documents is also easier,
especially if its a spreadsheet.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.300
The compromise is the resolution.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:21.910
A qHD IPS with a 960 x 540 resolution is perfectly
usable for the vast majority of tasks, but

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:27.850
watching back a Hollywood blockbuster is not
going to give you that cinema experience.

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.200
And because our phones usually go everywhere
with us the addition of scratch resistant

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:38.070
glass comes as some protection against the
elements such as keys and coins.

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.280
The ever popular Android operating system
is present on the E4.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.770
Sony do inevitably add some customisation
to the software.

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.350
Additions include amongst others, an Album,
Movies, Walkman and Xperia Lounge.

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:58.030
The key value added features for me are AVG
Protection, Garmin Navigation and Kobo an

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:05.049
e-book reader. You can even record a video
of your screen, no special apps needed.

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:11.120
Standard apps such as a calculator, FM radio,
chrome web browser, calendar are all present.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.689
There is everything to get you going and to
make the device feel personal. Change the

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:21.010
wallpapers, the number of home screens, the
ringtones and add shortcuts and widgets.

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.069
Pre-installed Google services such as Gmail,
YouTube and Drive are all present and if you

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:31.180
have an existing Google account you can be
setup and synchronised within a matter of

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.180
minutes.

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:37.410
During our testing we found performance to
be generally good, a little laggy at times.

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.709
If you want to play demanding games or be
doing lots of things at once then the E4 might

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:44.120
not be right for you.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.181
Of course being a phone you can make phone
calls over the network of your choice, if

00:02:48.181 --> 00:02:53.219
you purchase a SIM free variant. Just pop
in a micro SIM card and the phone will detect

00:02:53.219 --> 00:02:55.319
the relevant settings required.

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:00.120
If you are looking for the option of 2 SIM
cards, then the E4 does not tick that box.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:07.840
The E4 does not have 4G connectivity. If you
require this, then check out the Xperia E4g

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.180
which is essentially the E4 with 4G.

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:17.359
WiFi is common in most homes, offices, restaurants,
cafes and town centres now so if you do not

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:23.019
have a mobile data plan or want to benefit
from faster speeds use the WiFi connection

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:24.189
to get online.

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:30.489
On board the E4 is 8GB of internal memory,
of which about 5 is usable out of the box.

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:34.299
The Xperia E4 has a single speaker located
on the back of the phone.

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:39.920
It is not all bad though, whilst not the loudest
or the best quality, it was loud enough for

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.939
most and clear enough for what you are likely
to need to listen to on your phone.

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:48.909
Sony do also bring in some of their experience
from the audio space and have included software

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:54.290
additions that include Clear Audio, XLoud
and 3D Surround Sound technology to give a

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.249
better experience.

00:03:56.249 --> 00:04:01.439
Of course this is a phone too, so what is
the call quality like? Perfectly acceptable.

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:03.279
The E4 has two cameras.

00:04:03.279 --> 00:04:09.279
On the front is a 2 megapixel camera which
can record video at 720p HD resolution.

00:04:09.279 --> 00:04:15.040
On the back is a 5 megapixel camera with autofocus
and a single LED flash.

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:20.979
With both cameras you have a self timer and
a smile shutter (for both photos and video)

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:24.470
which as the name implies you can trigger
with a smile.

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.830
You can enable burst with a long press of
the on screen shutter button and whilst the

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:34.650
E4 does not have a dedicated shutter button
you can set the volume keys to be one.

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:40.389
The rear camera offers 4x digital zoom, HDR
and 1080p HD video recording.

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:45.150
It is also worth noting when recording video
you can pause the recording and commence the

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.289
same clip later and you can capture a still
whilst recording video.

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:53.729
There are lots of additional camera apps that
allow you to do lots of different things.

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:58.830
Check out our full written review in the description
below for this, but in short you have lots

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:02.280
of options to get creative and even stream
footage live.

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:07.440
So what are the image results like? You will
see some samples on screen now.

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:12.949
I think they are not bad, not spectacular
but certainly better than I had expected.

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:17.340
They are perfectly adequate for capturing
the moment and telling a story.

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:22.470
Whilst most images were ok the camera struggled
in situations where there was varying light.

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:28.530
The fixed internal battery is 2,300mAh in
capacity which may not seem much when there

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:35.110
are phones like the NGM Endurance that has
5,000mAh, it is certainly capable of lasting

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:38.280
2 days with light to moderate usage.

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:42.419
Whilst the screen is larger, the lower resolution
and other features ensure that battery is

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:44.630
not drained unnecessarily.

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:49.930
There are too a host of settings such as Ultra
STAMINA mode so you can perfect battery consumption

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:51.300
to suit you.

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:56.280
The Xperia E4 offers what is expected of a
smartphone in this category. Amongst tough

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:01.919
competition it is neither inferior nor does
it have that stand out feature that makes

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:04.129
it a champion amongst its peers.

00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:09.900
It is a solid, reliable and all round performer
for those who want or need a smartphone with

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:14.139
a large screen but do not need high end features
and functions.

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:19.910
I cannot fault the Xperia E4 from Sony. There
is a lot to like, and ultimately it will be

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:26.349
for you to decide how the E4 stacks up in
specifications and price against its competitors

00:06:26.349 --> 00:06:35.970
namely the Motorola Moto E and E 2nd Generation,
the Honor 3C and Sony’s very own E4g.

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:40.360
