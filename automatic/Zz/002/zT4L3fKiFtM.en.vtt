 slammed like a white roll she watches and then do this 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.340
 something happened Merkel to go into too much detail the whole he worked 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.359
 abstruse and at the moment where the original recording to come 

00:02:17.359 --> 00:02:19.089
 Fascher "The most important thing is

 Question of this one believes something like this one stands on the topic or 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.110
 how do you think about whether that researched a whole lot more so now 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.820
 these recordings are really what they themselves film 8 percent of the French

 GM employees last interested 

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:18.060
 to be able to watch by, this movie has it somehow in itself 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.549
 and the Frenchman has to do that as well, that's why it whistles 

00:03:22.089 --> 00:03:25.689
 on blu-ray, the whole thing is not particularly delivered and with a lot 

00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:27.169
 a lot of Luis while

00:03:30.499 --> 00:03:32.379
 from the year 2004 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:34.769
 also look like high-resolution photos 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:38.159
 and you see, you can see the people in the audience you like on DVD 

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:41.309
 we looked again over the khyber-pass is now also a small one 

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:42.849

 Animal what you need 

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:55.439

 around the steep rock slope 

00:03:57.539 --> 00:04:00.799

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:04.499
 truly great nomadic stroke, they should always do it 

00:04:04.499 --> 00:04:08.919
 because one after one investor for the majority of like almost no one else

 Do not tell that's a bit difficult to pack this all together 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.360
 Get informed says six out of ten possible points 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.229
 a really good movie does not have to be seen, he really does not have to 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:34.780
 but it is really interesting and makes you think about it 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.229
 its six out of ten possible points that's way 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:40.110
 a bit strange but it is just so many you can sure 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.889

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.980
 but Ochsenhausen moan a little text 

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:11.800
