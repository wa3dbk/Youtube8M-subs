is<00:00:31.020> what<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.350> rod<00:00:31.500> is<00:00:31.680> gonna<00:00:31.860> look<00:00:32.009> like<00:00:32.570> once

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
is what the rod is gonna look like once

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.030 
is what the rod is gonna look like once
we're<00:00:33.750> finished<00:00:33.870> with<00:00:34.170> it<00:00:34.320> so<00:00:34.680> I'm<00:00:34.770> taking<00:00:34.920> my

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
we're finished with it so I'm taking my

is gonna be but this does just tells me
exactly<00:00:47.190> how<00:00:47.790> far<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:48.270> slide<00:00:48.540> each<00:00:48.780> piece<00:00:49.079> down

razor wall these are included in the
deluxe<00:01:06.569> kit<00:01:07.249> I'm<00:01:08.249> constantly<00:01:08.759> rotating<00:01:09.329> the

00:01:09.739 --> 00:01:09.749 
deluxe kit I'm constantly rotating the

00:01:09.749 --> 00:01:12.080 
deluxe kit I'm constantly rotating the
reamer<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:10.350> actually<00:01:11.189> rotating<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.789> cork

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
reamer and actually rotating the cork

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.499 
reamer and actually rotating the cork
every<00:01:12.929> couple<00:01:13.259> reams<00:01:13.999> because<00:01:14.999> naturally

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
every couple reams because naturally

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.269 
every couple reams because naturally
your<00:01:16.020> hand<00:01:16.229> is<00:01:16.350> gonna<00:01:16.439> want<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:16.829> pull<00:01:17.039> to<00:01:17.249> one

00:01:17.269 --> 00:01:17.279 
your hand is gonna want to pull to one

00:01:17.279 --> 00:01:19.639 
your hand is gonna want to pull to one
side<00:01:17.490> or<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:17.880> other<00:01:17.939> without<00:01:18.749> even<00:01:19.109> knowing

00:01:19.639 --> 00:01:19.649 
side or the other without even knowing

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:22.519 
side or the other without even knowing
it<00:01:20.179> as<00:01:21.179> much<00:01:21.359> as<00:01:21.479> you<00:01:21.509> try<00:01:21.749> to<00:01:21.779> say<00:01:22.020> dead<00:01:22.229> center

00:01:22.519 --> 00:01:22.529 
it as much as you try to say dead center

00:01:22.529 --> 00:01:24.769 
it as much as you try to say dead center
it's<00:01:22.649> impossible<00:01:23.219> so<00:01:23.819> by<00:01:23.939> rotating<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.479> court

00:01:24.769 --> 00:01:24.779 
it's impossible so by rotating the court

00:01:24.779 --> 00:01:26.269 
it's impossible so by rotating the court
you're<00:01:25.350> actually<00:01:25.560> gonna<00:01:25.679> make<00:01:26.009> sure<00:01:26.159> that

00:01:26.269 --> 00:01:26.279 
you're actually gonna make sure that

00:01:26.279 --> 00:01:28.519 
you're actually gonna make sure that
that's<00:01:26.459> centered<00:01:26.729> at<00:01:26.850> all<00:01:26.939> times<00:01:27.409> you<00:01:28.409> don't

00:01:28.519 --> 00:01:28.529 
that's centered at all times you don't

00:01:28.529 --> 00:01:30.169 
that's centered at all times you don't
want<00:01:28.619> to<00:01:28.799> lay<00:01:29.219> these<00:01:29.369> on<00:01:29.459> your<00:01:29.579> blank<00:01:29.849> this<00:01:30.119> is

00:01:30.169 --> 00:01:30.179 
want to lay these on your blank this is

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:32.330 
want to lay these on your blank this is
silicon<00:01:30.689> carbide<00:01:31.079> it<00:01:31.590> will<00:01:31.740> scratch<00:01:32.009> pretty

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
silicon carbide it will scratch pretty

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.120 
silicon carbide it will scratch pretty
much<00:01:32.520> anything<00:01:32.849> and<00:01:33.060> everything<00:01:33.469> so<00:01:34.469> avoid

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
much anything and everything so avoid

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.399 
much anything and everything so avoid
laying<00:01:35.340> on<00:01:35.579> your<00:01:35.670> blank<00:01:35.939> I'm<00:01:36.869> gonna<00:01:37.049> take<00:01:37.259> this

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
laying on your blank I'm gonna take this

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.639 
laying on your blank I'm gonna take this
batch<00:01:37.649> and<00:01:37.920> dream<00:01:38.189> reamer<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:39.590> there's<00:01:40.590> a

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:40.649 
batch and dream reamer and there's a

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:42.859 
batch and dream reamer and there's a
couple<00:01:40.829> ways<00:01:41.039> to<00:01:41.099> use<00:01:41.459> these<00:01:41.670> products<00:01:42.119> you

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
couple ways to use these products you

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.620 
couple ways to use these products you
can<00:01:43.049> actually<00:01:43.490> screw<00:01:44.490> on<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:45.029> screwdriver

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
can actually screw on a screwdriver

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:51.289 
can actually screw on a screwdriver
handle<00:01:46.639> and<00:01:48.109> use<00:01:49.109> it<00:01:49.229> by<00:01:49.349> hand<00:01:49.939> now<00:01:50.939> once<00:01:51.179> I've

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
handle and use it by hand now once I've

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.269 
handle and use it by hand now once I've
used<00:01:51.539> this<00:01:51.659> small<00:01:51.929> size<00:01:52.200> which<00:01:52.799> I<00:01:52.889> you<00:01:52.950> can<00:01:53.130> see

00:01:53.269 --> 00:01:53.279 
used this small size which I you can see

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:57.800 
used this small size which I you can see
obviously<00:01:53.639> that's<00:01:54.179> done<00:01:55.939> step<00:01:56.939> up<00:01:57.149> to<00:01:57.719> the

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
obviously that's done step up to the

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.150 
obviously that's done step up to the
next<00:01:57.840> size

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:02.160 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.520 

again<00:02:03.160> script<00:02:03.880> in<00:02:04.060> there<00:02:04.210> and<00:02:04.530> continued

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
again script in there and continued

well knock this out so I'm gonna do is

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.320 
well knock this out so I'm gonna do is
just<00:02:30.670> slide<00:02:30.970> this<00:02:31.150> down<00:02:32.550> every<00:02:33.550> so<00:02:33.700> often<00:02:33.940> and

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
just slide this down every so often and

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.470 
just slide this down every so often and
check<00:02:35.490> see<00:02:36.490> how<00:02:36.550> far<00:02:36.730> obviously<00:02:37.030> I've<00:02:37.330> got<00:02:37.450> a

check see how far obviously I've got a

long ways to go but I'd rather keep

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.460 
long ways to go but I'd rather keep
checking<00:02:41.590> and<00:02:41.740> be<00:02:41.890> safe<00:02:42.510> then<00:02:43.510> go<00:02:43.660> too<00:02:43.720> far<00:02:44.110> and

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
checking and be safe then go too far and

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.310 
checking and be safe then go too far and
have<00:02:44.980> it<00:02:45.070> actually<00:02:45.460> be<00:02:46.450> reamed<00:02:46.660> out<00:02:46.810> too<00:02:47.050> large

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
have it actually be reamed out too large

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.500 
have it actually be reamed out too large
and<00:02:47.860> not<00:02:48.040> fit<00:02:48.310> snug<00:02:48.580> I<00:02:48.700> want<00:02:48.880> the<00:02:49.000> fit<00:02:49.210> just

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
and not fit snug I want the fit just

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.330 
and not fit snug I want the fit just

take this drill chuck the dream reamer
in<00:02:59.890> there<00:03:02.190> and<00:03:03.190> do<00:03:03.550> just<00:03:03.790> like<00:03:03.910> that<00:03:03.970> obviously

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
in there and do just like that obviously

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.620 
in there and do just like that obviously
it's<00:03:05.260> a<00:03:05.320> lot<00:03:05.470> quicker<00:03:05.770> I<00:03:06.670> believe<00:03:07.300> you<00:03:07.450> get<00:03:07.570> a

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
it's a lot quicker I believe you get a

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.080 
it's a lot quicker I believe you get a
better<00:03:07.900> REM<00:03:08.590> on<00:03:08.800> the<00:03:08.920> inside<00:03:09.220> it's<00:03:09.610> much<00:03:09.880> more

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
better REM on the inside it's much more

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.670 
better REM on the inside it's much more
consistent<00:03:10.720> and<00:03:10.810> smooth<00:03:11.080> as<00:03:11.260> opposed<00:03:11.560> to

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
consistent and smooth as opposed to

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.190 
consistent and smooth as opposed to
doing<00:03:11.830> it<00:03:11.980> by<00:03:12.100> hand<00:03:12.570> now<00:03:13.570> these<00:03:13.720> dream<00:03:13.930> rumors

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
doing it by hand now these dream rumors

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.250 
doing it by hand now these dream rumors
are<00:03:14.320> awesome<00:03:14.709> see<00:03:15.400> how<00:03:15.550> the<00:03:16.360> bottom<00:03:17.050> part<00:03:17.230> of

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
are awesome see how the bottom part of

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.110 
are awesome see how the bottom part of
this<00:03:17.380> grip<00:03:17.620> has<00:03:18.130> a<00:03:18.190> little<00:03:18.610> bit<00:03:18.700> of<00:03:18.820> a<00:03:18.940> wiggle

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
this grip has a little bit of a wiggle

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.330 
this grip has a little bit of a wiggle
in<00:03:19.390> there<00:03:19.600> it's<00:03:20.410> a<00:03:20.470> little<00:03:20.530> bit<00:03:20.709> loose<00:03:21.010> but

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
in there it's a little bit loose but

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.699 
in there it's a little bit loose but
we're<00:03:22.150> still<00:03:22.360> snug<00:03:22.660> so<00:03:23.110> what<00:03:23.230> that<00:03:23.350> tells<00:03:23.590> me

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
we're still snug so what that tells me

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:29.430 
we're still snug so what that tells me
is<00:03:24.130> that<00:03:24.820> the<00:03:24.940> front<00:03:25.330> of<00:03:25.780> the<00:03:26.560> grip<00:03:26.830> is<00:03:28.440> what's

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
is that the front of the grip is what's

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.710 
is that the front of the grip is what's
choking<00:03:29.860> it<00:03:29.950> at<00:03:30.040> this<00:03:30.160> point<00:03:30.519> so<00:03:31.300> rather<00:03:31.510> than

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
choking it at this point so rather than

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.600 
choking it at this point so rather than
continuing<00:03:31.840> to<00:03:32.260> ream<00:03:32.590> from<00:03:32.890> the<00:03:32.980> rear<00:03:33.280> and

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
continuing to ream from the rear and

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.440 
continuing to ream from the rear and
make<00:03:34.200> this<00:03:35.200> even<00:03:36.040> looser<00:03:36.340> in<00:03:36.430> the<00:03:36.519> rear<00:03:36.730> I'm

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
make this even looser in the rear I'm

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.420 
make this even looser in the rear I'm
going<00:03:37.600> to<00:03:37.660> go<00:03:37.780> ahead<00:03:37.870> and<00:03:38.080> take<00:03:38.260> that<00:03:38.430> same

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
going to go ahead and take that same

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.130 
going to go ahead and take that same
reamer<00:03:39.700> I<00:03:39.820> was<00:03:40.000> just<00:03:40.209> using<00:03:40.450> the<00:03:40.600> same<00:03:40.900> size

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
reamer I was just using the same size

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.220 
reamer I was just using the same size
and<00:03:41.790> actually<00:03:42.790> rain<00:03:43.209> from<00:03:43.450> the<00:03:43.570> front<00:03:43.930> of<00:03:44.140> the

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
and actually rain from the front of the

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.580 
and actually rain from the front of the
grip<00:03:44.500> a<00:03:44.709> little<00:03:45.100> bit

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
grip a little bit

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.380 
grip a little bit
again<00:03:47.280> it's<00:03:47.489> one<00:03:47.819> of<00:03:47.849> those<00:03:47.970> things<00:03:48.209> you<00:03:48.300> don't

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
again it's one of those things you don't

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.089 
again it's one of those things you don't
have<00:03:48.480> to<00:03:48.780> do<00:03:48.930> but<00:03:49.560> it<00:03:49.650> does<00:03:49.800> make<00:03:49.950> a<00:03:50.010> difference

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:50.099 
have to do but it does make a difference

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:54.650 
have to do but it does make a difference
you<00:03:50.610> try<00:03:50.790> to<00:03:50.849> get<00:03:51.060> that<00:03:51.590> fit<00:03:52.590> perfect<00:03:53.660> when

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
you try to get that fit perfect when

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.110 
you try to get that fit perfect when
Riemann<00:03:55.020> from<00:03:55.200> the<00:03:55.290> front<00:03:56.870> it's<00:03:57.870> much<00:03:58.260> easier

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
Riemann from the front it's much easier

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.140 
Riemann from the front it's much easier
it's<00:04:00.120> very<00:04:00.360> easy<00:04:00.630> to<00:04:01.040> go<00:04:02.040> too<00:04:02.099> far<00:04:02.489> and<00:04:02.760> end<00:04:03.030> up

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
it's very easy to go too far and end up

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.860 
it's very easy to go too far and end up
with<00:04:03.330> it<00:04:03.450> be<00:04:03.599> loose<00:04:04.319> in<00:04:04.470> the<00:04:04.560> front<00:04:05.810> all<00:04:06.810> right

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
with it be loose in the front all right

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.509 
with it be loose in the front all right
now<00:04:07.200> that<00:04:07.380> we've<00:04:07.500> got<00:04:07.709> this<00:04:07.860> thing<00:04:07.920> reamed<00:04:08.310> out

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
now that we've got this thing reamed out

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:13.250 
now that we've got this thing reamed out
and<00:04:09.300> see<00:04:09.540> that<00:04:10.069> it<00:04:11.069> fits<00:04:11.340> just<00:04:11.900> snug<00:04:12.900> right

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
and see that it fits just snug right

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.030 
and see that it fits just snug right
there<00:04:13.500> you<00:04:13.980> don't<00:04:14.130> want<00:04:14.280> to<00:04:14.340> go<00:04:14.430> too<00:04:14.489> tight

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:16.040 
there you don't want to go too tight

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.409 
there you don't want to go too tight
because<00:04:17.040> then<00:04:17.370> actually<00:04:17.790> when<00:04:18.060> you<00:04:18.120> push<00:04:18.299> it

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
because then actually when you push it

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:21.289 
because then actually when you push it
down<00:04:18.600> you<00:04:18.870> push<00:04:19.079> all<00:04:19.620> the<00:04:19.769> epoxy<00:04:20.310> out<00:04:20.489> it'll

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
down you push all the epoxy out it'll

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:23.270 
down you push all the epoxy out it'll
act<00:04:21.419> like<00:04:21.570> a<00:04:21.660> squeegee<00:04:21.959> and<00:04:22.740> just<00:04:22.919> push<00:04:23.100> all

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
act like a squeegee and just push all

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.340 
act like a squeegee and just push all
the<00:04:23.370> epoxy<00:04:23.760> out<00:04:23.910> in<00:04:24.030> a<00:04:24.090> way<00:04:24.240> but<00:04:25.139> you<00:04:25.229> don't

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350 
the epoxy out in a way but you don't

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:28.659 
the epoxy out in a way but you don't
want<00:04:25.470> to<00:04:25.530> be<00:04:25.620> too<00:04:25.800> loose<00:04:26.010> either<00:04:26.340> so<00:04:26.940> just<00:04:26.970> snug

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:28.669 
want to be too loose either so just snug

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:31.730 
want to be too loose either so just snug
it's<00:04:29.669> perfect<00:04:30.229> so<00:04:31.229> that's<00:04:31.320> where<00:04:31.530> the<00:04:31.590> rear

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
it's perfect so that's where the rear

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.310 
it's perfect so that's where the rear
grip<00:04:31.860> is<00:04:32.040> going<00:04:32.100> to<00:04:32.220> sit<00:04:32.930> and<00:04:33.930> you<00:04:34.020> can<00:04:34.169> see

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
grip is going to sit and you can see

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.659 
grip is going to sit and you can see
here<00:04:34.650> or<00:04:35.310> the<00:04:35.550> real<00:04:35.729> seats<00:04:35.970> going<00:04:36.240> to<00:04:36.300> go<00:04:36.450> and

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:37.669 
here or the real seats going to go and

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:39.620 
here or the real seats going to go and
then<00:04:38.669> our<00:04:38.760> four<00:04:38.970> grips<00:04:39.180> going<00:04:39.330> to<00:04:39.389> go<00:04:39.450> right

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
then our four grips going to go right

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:41.930 
then our four grips going to go right
here<00:04:39.740> so<00:04:40.740> we<00:04:40.919> know<00:04:41.070> that<00:04:41.190> the<00:04:41.250> real<00:04:41.460> seat<00:04:41.729> is

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
here so we know that the real seat is

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.930 
here so we know that the real seat is
going<00:04:42.120> we're<00:04:42.270> going<00:04:42.389> to<00:04:42.479> use<00:04:42.570> our<00:04:42.840> burs

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
going we're going to use our burs

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.570 
going we're going to use our burs
whether<00:04:44.940> we<00:04:45.120> use<00:04:45.150> graphite<00:04:45.960> arbors

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 
whether we use graphite arbors

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.180 
whether we use graphite arbors
polyurethane<00:04:47.580> arbors<00:04:47.940> or<00:04:48.150> in<00:04:48.360> this<00:04:48.479> case

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.190 
polyurethane arbors or in this case

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:52.310 
polyurethane arbors or in this case
masking<00:04:50.190> tape<00:04:50.630> we're<00:04:51.630> gonna<00:04:51.750> make<00:04:51.960> some<00:04:52.110> rings

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 
masking tape we're gonna make some rings

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
masking tape we're gonna make some rings
of<00:04:52.560> masking<00:04:53.220> tape<00:04:53.250> here<00:04:53.640> to<00:04:54.419> use<00:04:54.539> his<00:04:54.660> arbors

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340 
of masking tape here to use his arbors

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.890 
of masking tape here to use his arbors
but<00:04:56.340> we'll<00:04:56.729> go<00:04:56.850> ahead<00:04:56.940> and<00:04:57.060> remount<00:04:57.450> this<00:04:57.660> for

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 
but we'll go ahead and remount this for

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.020 
but we'll go ahead and remount this for
grip<00:04:58.140> first<00:04:58.470> so<00:04:59.310> we<00:04:59.400> get<00:04:59.520> this<00:04:59.610> to<00:04:59.789> the<00:04:59.880> point

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.030 
grip first so we get this to the point

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:02.840 
grip first so we get this to the point
where<00:05:00.300> it's<00:05:01.050> gonna<00:05:01.229> fit<00:05:01.440> on<00:05:01.560> there<00:05:01.650> we'll<00:05:01.919> then

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:02.850 
where it's gonna fit on there we'll then

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:04.279 
where it's gonna fit on there we'll then
we'll<00:05:02.940> actually<00:05:03.390> put<00:05:03.600> the<00:05:03.690> epoxy<00:05:03.930> on<00:05:04.169> the

00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:04.289 
we'll actually put the epoxy on the

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:07.520 
we'll actually put the epoxy on the
blank<00:05:04.640> put<00:05:05.640> our<00:05:05.729> rear<00:05:05.910> drip<00:05:06.120> on<00:05:06.330> with<00:05:07.260> the<00:05:07.380> real

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:07.530 
blank put our rear drip on with the real

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:16.860 
blank put our rear drip on with the real
seat<00:05:07.800> and<00:05:08.789> then<00:05:08.970> the<00:05:09.060> fore<00:05:09.270> grip

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:16.870
