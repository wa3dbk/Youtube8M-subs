 all those at school and those in kindergarten 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.210
 lorenzo goes to the nursery school he went to the 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.970
 kindergarten and you go in first 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.950

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:18.150

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.990

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:29.280

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:36.600
 man cook beautiful is also dad to do 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.390
 a few neighbors then we go sometimes 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.360
 fashion let's do some shoots 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:45.540
 out of town or go to Tuscany 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.290
 from my parents grandparents less 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:52.940
 and the opportunity to wait for the machine 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:55.690
 in train then the solution of the thing 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.690
 is behind it 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:07.310
 then the parents the grandparents on the other 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:11.000
 yes, mine are from Tuscany while 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:14.990
 Sicilian star and his parents 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.940
 add the accusation so it's a great one 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:21.380
 opportunity to make holidays 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:23.360
 native christmas and then describes the 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:26.810
 vacations we know where to go, let's say 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.970
 however in everyday life do not have i 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:32.240
 grandparents means having to manage everything 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:36.950
 possibly even guys up and do 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:44.989
 today representative baby sitter 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:48.459
 Italian family no no also just like 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:48.459
 number of children and more 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:56.680
 I only know one of my 200 colleagues 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.300
 people who know he has three children 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.740
 let's say in Italy they have been cut 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:05.370
 in my opinion essential services for 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:09.220
 to manage not trebins but also just one 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:12.850
 and this causes the expense to be spent 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.650
 the family is much higher 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.160
 how could it be because in addition to 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.520
 tax 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.440
 however there is this huge outlay of 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:23.670
 money for the vices that 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.670
 they should be basic
