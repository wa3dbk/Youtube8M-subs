I've<00:01:27.000> never<00:01:27.869> done<00:01:28.290> this<00:01:28.740> before<00:01:29.040> so<00:01:29.579> I'm<00:01:29.700> kind

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
I've never done this before so I'm kind

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.050 
I've never done this before so I'm kind
of<00:01:30.390> guessing<00:01:30.720> as<00:01:31.020> I<00:01:31.110> go<00:01:31.259> along<00:01:31.409> so<00:01:31.970> looks<00:01:32.970> like

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
of guessing as I go along so looks like

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:53.710 
of guessing as I go along so looks like
it's<00:01:33.150> seven<00:01:33.630> millimeter<00:01:51.320> all<00:01:52.320> right<00:01:52.530> so<00:01:53.040> I

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
it's seven millimeter all right so I

00:01:53.720 --> 00:02:00.109 
it's seven millimeter all right so I
have<00:01:55.520> this<00:01:56.520> break<00:01:57.090> or<00:01:57.390> release<00:01:57.710> handle<00:01:58.710> I<00:01:59.119> have

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
have this break or release handle I have

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.929 
have this break or release handle I have
a<00:02:00.149> stupid<00:02:00.899> switch<00:02:01.380> that's<00:02:01.770> obviously<00:02:02.280> doing<00:02:02.880> a

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
a stupid switch that's obviously doing a

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.010 
a stupid switch that's obviously doing a
whole<00:02:03.090> lot<00:02:03.119> here<00:02:03.630> um<00:02:04.729> then<00:02:05.729> I<00:02:05.869> have<00:02:06.869> to

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
whole lot here um then I have to

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.779 
whole lot here um then I have to
disconnect<00:02:07.469> it<00:02:07.710> looks<00:02:07.890> like<00:02:08.039> this<00:02:08.220> is<00:02:08.459> coming

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
disconnect it looks like this is coming

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.029 
disconnect it looks like this is coming
apart<00:02:09.030> so<00:02:09.300> I<00:02:09.360> can<00:02:09.479> put<00:02:09.599> that<00:02:09.750> back<00:02:09.899> up<00:02:10.140> anyway<00:02:10.890> I

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
apart so I can put that back up anyway I

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.590 
apart so I can put that back up anyway I
got<00:02:11.400> to<00:02:11.489> figure<00:02:11.670> out<00:02:11.760> how<00:02:11.819> to

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
got to figure out how to

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:21.770 
got to figure out how to
okay<00:02:12.840> so<00:02:13.170> you're<00:02:13.350> twisting<00:02:14.030> and<00:02:20.480> you<00:02:21.480> see<00:02:21.660> it

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
okay so you're twisting and you see it

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.890 
okay so you're twisting and you see it
right<00:02:22.230> there<00:02:22.730> there's<00:02:23.730> a<00:02:23.820> little<00:02:24.090> tab<00:02:24.680> and

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
right there there's a little tab and

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.410 
right there there's a little tab and
lame-o<00:02:27.900> there's<00:02:28.350> one<00:02:28.470> on<00:02:28.620> each<00:02:28.650> side<00:02:29.420> so

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
lame-o there's one on each side so

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.350 
lame-o there's one on each side so
there's<00:02:30.600> probably<00:02:30.720> a<00:02:30.930> special<00:02:31.470> tool<00:02:31.680> for<00:02:31.830> that

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
there's probably a special tool for that

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.030 
there's probably a special tool for that
anyway<00:02:33.360> there's<00:02:33.630> a<00:02:33.690> tab<00:02:33.900> on<00:02:33.930> either<00:02:34.260> side<00:02:34.620> and

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
anyway there's a tab on either side and

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.220 
anyway there's a tab on either side and
that<00:02:35.250> will<00:02:35.400> come<00:02:35.520> up<00:02:35.580> there<00:02:35.880> and<00:02:36.840> you<00:02:36.930> put<00:02:37.110> your

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
that will come up there and you put your

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:46.430 
that will come up there and you put your
part<00:02:37.410> right<00:02:39.110> so<00:02:44.450> ignore<00:02:45.450> all<00:02:45.660> these<00:02:45.840> extra

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
part right so ignore all these extra

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.160 
part right so ignore all these extra
wires<00:02:46.710> the<00:02:47.250> people<00:02:48.030> who<00:02:48.150> owned<00:02:48.390> this<00:02:48.600> before

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
wires the people who owned this before

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.560 
wires the people who owned this before
me<00:02:49.380> apparently<00:02:50.160> had<00:02:50.460> a<00:02:50.490> lift<00:02:50.760> kit<00:02:51.030> on<00:02:51.240> it<00:02:51.270> and

they put off they put a whole bunch of
special<00:02:55.980> things<00:02:57.560> so<00:02:58.560> now<00:02:58.740> I'm<00:02:58.920> going<00:02:59.220> to

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
special things so now I'm going to

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:04.540 
special things so now I'm going to
remove<00:02:59.580> the<00:03:00.450> gauge<00:03:00.780> cluster<00:03:00.810> I<00:03:01.800> believe<00:03:02.400> um

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
remove the gauge cluster I believe um

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.980 
remove the gauge cluster I believe um
one<00:03:05.550> thing<00:03:05.730> I<00:03:05.850> didn't<00:03:06.150> know<00:03:06.180> is<00:03:06.450> that<00:03:06.570> you

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:06.990 
one thing I didn't know is that you

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:09.070 
one thing I didn't know is that you
should<00:03:07.200> probably<00:03:07.580> disconnect<00:03:08.580> your<00:03:08.730> battery

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 
should probably disconnect your battery

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.710 
should probably disconnect your battery
which<00:03:10.080> I<00:03:10.350> haven't<00:03:10.650> done<00:03:11.390> so<00:03:12.390> I'm<00:03:12.450> going<00:03:12.600> to<00:03:12.630> do

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
which I haven't done so I'm going to do

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.290 
which I haven't done so I'm going to do
that<00:03:12.840> now<00:03:13.280> so<00:03:14.280> just<00:03:14.550> check<00:03:14.700> my<00:03:14.940> battery

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
that now so just check my battery

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.890 
that now so just check my battery
there's<00:03:15.930> a<00:03:16.080> bolt<00:03:16.590> there<00:03:16.890> bolt<00:03:17.640> there<00:03:17.940> on<00:03:18.660> there

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
there's a bolt there bolt there on there

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.810 
there's a bolt there bolt there on there
and<00:03:18.990> probably<00:03:19.230> on<00:03:19.470> there<00:03:19.650> too<00:03:19.860> okay<00:03:20.310> I<00:03:20.550> mean

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
and probably on there too okay I mean

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:26.120 
and probably on there too okay I mean
face<00:03:24.170> so<00:03:25.170> there's<00:03:25.320> probably<00:03:25.410> a<00:03:25.620> plug<00:03:25.890> on<00:03:26.040> the

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
face so there's probably a plug on the

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.130 
face so there's probably a plug on the
back<00:03:26.280> of<00:03:26.430> this<00:03:26.550> gauge<00:03:26.850> cluster<00:03:27.420> make<00:03:27.960> sure

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
back of this gauge cluster make sure

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:37.570 
back of this gauge cluster make sure
your<00:03:28.260> tilt<00:03:28.560> is<00:03:28.740> all<00:03:28.890> the<00:03:29.040> way<00:03:29.130> down<00:03:35.180> and

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580 
your tilt is all the way down and

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.220 
your tilt is all the way down and
another<00:03:38.580> isn't<00:03:38.910> wow<00:03:39.300> I<00:03:39.330> mean<00:03:39.540> there<00:03:39.720> is<00:03:39.930> but

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
another isn't wow I mean there is but

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.270 
another isn't wow I mean there is but
it's<00:03:40.380> an<00:03:40.620> interesting<00:03:40.800> design<00:03:41.310> actually

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
it's an interesting design actually

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:49.940 
it's an interesting design actually
there's<00:03:44.280> a<00:03:44.370> huge<00:03:44.700> plug<00:03:46.340> right<00:03:47.340> here<00:03:48.770> and<00:03:49.770> it

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
there's a huge plug right here and it

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.450 
there's a huge plug right here and it
just<00:03:49.980> plugs<00:03:50.460> in<00:03:50.720> back<00:03:51.720> there<00:03:51.990> so<00:03:52.310> anyway<00:03:53.310> I'm

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:53.460 
just plugs in back there so anyway I'm

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.160 
just plugs in back there so anyway I'm
going<00:03:53.490> to<00:03:53.640> take<00:03:53.790> these<00:03:53.940> four<00:03:54.180> screws<00:03:54.390> and<00:03:54.690> set

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
going to take these four screws and set

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.600 
going to take these four screws and set
them<00:03:55.320> aside<00:03:55.380> with<00:03:55.980> the<00:03:56.280> dash<00:03:57.260> so<00:03:58.260> next<00:03:58.920> step<00:03:59.340> no

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
them aside with the dash so next step no

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.730 
them aside with the dash so next step no
idea<00:04:00.000> but<00:04:00.390> I<00:04:00.660> know<00:04:00.870> the<00:04:01.080> steering<00:04:01.410> wheel<00:04:01.530> has

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:01.740 
idea but I know the steering wheel has

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:04.040 
idea but I know the steering wheel has
to<00:04:01.860> be<00:04:01.980> dropped<00:04:02.190> which<00:04:03.000> means<00:04:03.240> that<00:04:03.480> plate<00:04:03.780> has

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.050 
to be dropped which means that plate has

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:08.750 
to be dropped which means that plate has
to<00:04:04.170> be<00:04:04.200> dropped<00:04:04.470> so<00:04:05.810> I'm<00:04:06.810> going<00:04:06.990> to<00:04:07.760> remove

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
to be dropped so I'm going to remove

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.350 
to be dropped so I'm going to remove
that<00:04:08.820> metal<00:04:09.270> plate<00:04:10.820> looks<00:04:11.820> like<00:04:11.910> it's<00:04:12.120> ten

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
that metal plate looks like it's ten

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:20.909 
that metal plate looks like it's ten
millimeter

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:20.919 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:24.909 

wait<00:04:21.919> remove<00:04:22.720> and<00:04:23.720> then<00:04:24.650> there's<00:04:24.830> another

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:24.919 
wait remove and then there's another

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:28.000 
wait remove and then there's another
plate<00:04:25.400> here<00:04:25.900> which<00:04:26.900> has<00:04:27.139> a<00:04:27.169> screw<00:04:27.560> here<00:04:27.770> and<00:04:27.830> a

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.010 
plate here which has a screw here and a

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:44.820 
plate here which has a screw here and a
screw<00:04:28.250> here<00:04:28.639> and<00:04:30.699> possibly<00:04:31.699> more<00:04:40.210> must<00:04:41.210> be<00:04:43.180> yep

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
screw here and possibly more must be yep

00:04:44.830 --> 00:05:00.029 
screw here and possibly more must be yep
okay<00:04:45.830> so<00:04:46.520> I've<00:04:46.850> got<00:04:46.880> those<00:04:47.180> two<00:04:47.240> screws

00:05:00.029 --> 00:05:00.039 

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:02.710 

alright<00:05:01.039> so<00:05:01.340> what<00:05:01.669> I<00:05:01.699> think<00:05:01.820> needs<00:05:02.180> to<00:05:02.330> happen

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
is this central bar comes out if we

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:10.439 
is this central bar comes out if we
release<00:05:07.400> these<00:05:07.610> screws<00:05:08.090> oh<00:05:08.300> yeah<00:05:08.990> nuts<00:05:09.470> man

00:05:10.439 --> 00:05:10.449

awful time with that so I'm gonna do fun
right<00:05:22.000> now<00:05:23.000> this<00:05:23.150> little<00:05:23.419> piece<00:05:23.599> comes<00:05:23.870> out

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430 
right now this little piece comes out

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:26.620 
right now this little piece comes out
that's<00:05:25.430> going<00:05:25.610> to<00:05:25.669> let<00:05:25.760> us<00:05:25.880> drop<00:05:26.150> the<00:05:26.330> steering

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:26.630 
that's going to let us drop the steering

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:29.710 
that's going to let us drop the steering
wheel<00:05:26.750> down<00:05:28.510> okay

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:29.720 
wheel down okay

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:34.120 
wheel down okay
so<00:05:30.050> it<00:05:30.169> looks<00:05:30.349> like<00:05:31.570> this<00:05:32.570> bolt<00:05:32.960> this<00:05:33.380> nut<00:05:33.650> here

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:34.130 
so it looks like this bolt this nut here

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:38.440 
so it looks like this bolt this nut here
I<00:05:35.889> would<00:05:36.889> recommend<00:05:37.430> not<00:05:37.729> dropping<00:05:38.120> this

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:38.450 
I would recommend not dropping this

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:41.110 
I would recommend not dropping this
gentleman<00:05:38.750> on<00:05:38.930> your<00:05:39.110> face<00:05:39.460> like<00:05:40.460> I'm<00:05:40.669> about<00:05:40.910> to

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:41.120 
gentleman on your face like I'm about to

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.670 
gentleman on your face like I'm about to
do

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:42.680 
do

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:45.870 
do
looks<00:05:43.400> like<00:05:43.550> those<00:05:43.760> two<00:05:43.789> and<00:05:44.330> these<00:05:45.229> two

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:45.880 
looks like those two and these two

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:49.710 
looks like those two and these two
the<00:05:46.880> Stanwell<00:05:47.330> should<00:05:47.570> be<00:05:47.690> able<00:05:47.780> to<00:05:47.900> pivot

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:49.720 
the Stanwell should be able to pivot

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.620 
the Stanwell should be able to pivot
assuming<00:05:50.720> there's<00:05:50.930> a<00:05:50.990> some<00:05:51.530> sort<00:05:51.800> of<00:05:51.919> a

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:52.630 
assuming there's a some sort of a

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:56.370 
assuming there's a some sort of a
coupling<00:05:53.630> there<00:05:53.870> a<00:05:54.460> constant<00:05:55.460> velocity

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:56.380 
coupling there a constant velocity

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:14.429 
coupling there a constant velocity
coupling<00:05:57.669> be<00:05:58.669> nice<00:05:58.960> look

00:06:14.429 --> 00:06:14.439 

00:06:14.439 --> 00:06:28.709 

oh<00:06:26.639> I<00:06:27.639> don't<00:06:27.879> want<00:06:28.059> to<00:06:28.089> drop<00:06:28.269> them<00:06:28.419> all<00:06:28.539> the<00:06:28.629> way

00:06:28.709 --> 00:06:28.719 
oh I don't want to drop them all the way

00:06:28.719 --> 00:06:31.649 
oh I don't want to drop them all the way
down<00:06:28.749> until<00:06:29.110> it's<00:06:30.149> verified<00:06:31.149> it's<00:06:31.360> not<00:06:31.509> going

00:06:31.649 --> 00:06:31.659 
down until it's verified it's not going

00:06:31.659 --> 00:06:35.719 
down until it's verified it's not going
to<00:06:31.749> rip<00:06:31.959> anything<00:06:32.289> out<00:06:32.469> of<00:06:32.499> its<00:06:32.739> hole<00:06:33.610> in<00:06:33.789> me<00:06:33.969> no

00:06:35.719 --> 00:06:35.729 
to rip anything out of its hole in me no

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:55.639 
to rip anything out of its hole in me no
it<00:06:36.729> feels<00:06:36.999> like<00:06:37.239> it's<00:06:52.379> so<00:06:53.379> why<00:06:53.619> is<00:06:53.679> it<00:06:53.829> still

00:06:55.639 --> 00:06:55.649 
it feels like it's so why is it still
