so we're going to put this together into

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.860 
so we're going to put this together into
a<00:03:32.590> combination<00:03:33.400> it's<00:03:33.910> very<00:03:34.030> simply<00:03:34.570> going<00:03:34.750> to

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
a combination it's very simply going to

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.930 
a combination it's very simply going to
be<00:03:34.990> two<00:03:35.200> squats<00:03:35.530> down<00:03:35.770> and<00:03:36.010> up<00:03:36.130> with<00:03:36.400> pulses

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
be two squats down and up with pulses

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.180 
be two squats down and up with pulses
then<00:03:37.150> we'll<00:03:37.330> alternate<00:03:37.840> squat<00:03:38.710> down<00:03:38.740> and<00:03:38.980> up

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
then we'll alternate squat down and up

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.440 
then we'll alternate squat down and up
two<00:03:39.400> times<00:03:40.830> give<00:03:41.830> me<00:03:42.040> your<00:03:42.070> pulses<00:03:42.760> and<00:03:43.300> then
