part<00:01:03.809> of<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:03.989> plan<00:01:04.019> so<00:01:05.180> you<00:01:06.180> know<00:01:06.270> can<00:01:06.510> be<00:01:06.540> in

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
part of the plan so you know can be in

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.520 
part of the plan so you know can be in
words<00:01:07.049> it<00:01:07.260> can<00:01:07.439> be<00:01:07.619> it<00:01:07.860> can<00:01:07.890> be<00:01:08.130> in<00:01:08.990> that<00:01:09.990> indeed

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
words it can be it can be in that indeed

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.179 
words it can be it can be in that indeed
and<00:01:10.860> in<00:01:11.010> action<00:01:11.520> but<00:01:12.470> the<00:01:13.470> reality<00:01:13.890> is<00:01:13.920> people

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
and in action but the reality is people

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.499 
and in action but the reality is people
aren't<00:01:14.610> always<00:01:14.670> going<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.479> support<00:01:15.810> you<00:01:15.900> and

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:17.509 
aren't always going to support you and

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:21.469 
aren't always going to support you and
what<00:01:18.509> I<00:01:18.540> want<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:18.810> say<00:01:18.960> about<00:01:19.080> that<00:01:19.350> is<00:01:19.650> that<00:01:20.479> I

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
what I want to say about that is that I

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.420 
what I want to say about that is that I
think<00:01:21.810> it<00:01:21.930> helps<00:01:22.409> when<00:01:22.770> you<00:01:22.890> bring<00:01:23.159> awareness

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
think it helps when you bring awareness

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.609 
think it helps when you bring awareness
to<00:01:24.000> where<00:01:24.299> that<00:01:24.540> comes<00:01:24.810> from<00:01:24.960> in<00:01:25.320> those<00:01:25.470> other

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
to where that comes from in those other

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.940 
to where that comes from in those other
people<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.450> I<00:01:27.450> think<00:01:27.840> more<00:01:28.409> often<00:01:28.740> than<00:01:28.890> not

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
people and I think more often than not

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.109 
people and I think more often than not
it's<00:01:29.430> a<00:01:29.970> defense<00:01:30.180> mechanism<00:01:30.479> if<00:01:31.850> you<00:01:32.850> succeed

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
it's a defense mechanism if you succeed

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.859 
it's a defense mechanism if you succeed
in<00:01:33.689> achieving<00:01:34.320> your<00:01:34.799> goals<00:01:35.070> then<00:01:35.579> that<00:01:36.570> says

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
in achieving your goals then that says

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.109 
in achieving your goals then that says
something<00:01:37.049> about<00:01:37.530> their<00:01:38.250> lifestyle<00:01:38.790> they

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
something about their lifestyle they

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.080 
something about their lifestyle they
take<00:01:39.329> it<00:01:39.479> very<00:01:39.509> personally<00:01:40.220> it<00:01:41.220> isn't<00:01:41.850> about

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
take it very personally it isn't about

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.969 
take it very personally it isn't about
you<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:42.659> what<00:01:43.110> you're<00:01:43.229> doing<00:01:43.530> it's<00:01:43.680> really

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
you and what you're doing it's really

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.260 
you and what you're doing it's really
about<00:01:44.100> that<00:01:44.460> and<00:01:45.500> if<00:01:46.500> you<00:01:46.890> reject<00:01:47.100> a<00:01:47.670> sedentary

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
about that and if you reject a sedentary

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.190 
about that and if you reject a sedentary
lifestyle<00:01:48.930> that<00:01:49.200> they<00:01:49.259> may<00:01:49.590> be<00:01:49.649> living<00:01:50.310> then

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
lifestyle that they may be living then

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.350 
lifestyle that they may be living then
for<00:01:52.200> them<00:01:52.380> it's<00:01:52.860> a<00:01:53.340> push<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.909> make<00:01:54.000> a<00:01:54.060> change

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
for them it's a push to make a change

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.660 
for them it's a push to make a change
that<00:01:54.570> there<00:01:54.780> may<00:01:54.899> be<00:01:54.930> reluctant<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:55.680> to<00:01:56.520> make

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
that there may be reluctant to to make

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.690 
that there may be reluctant to to make
in<00:01:56.820> their<00:01:56.909> own<00:01:57.060> life<00:01:57.270> so<00:01:58.280> so<00:01:59.280> people<00:01:59.549> might

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
in their own life so so people might

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.899 
in their own life so so people might
take<00:01:59.939> your<00:02:00.119> decision<00:02:01.159> very<00:02:02.159> personally<00:02:02.700> in

attractive than they are is going to

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.309 
attractive than they are is going to
come<00:02:37.879> along<00:02:38.120> and<00:02:38.329> try<00:02:38.420> to<00:02:38.540> sweep<00:02:38.840> you<00:02:38.989> off<00:02:39.049> your

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 
come along and try to sweep you off your

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:43.930 
come along and try to sweep you off your
feet<00:02:40.180> so<00:02:41.180> in<00:02:41.569> either<00:02:42.379> event<00:02:42.700> in<00:02:43.700> either<00:02:43.819> case

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
feet so in either event in either case

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.160 
feet so in either event in either case
it<00:02:44.360> is<00:02:44.840> a<00:02:45.250> defense<00:02:46.250> mechanism<00:02:46.900> when<00:02:47.900> people

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
it is a defense mechanism when people

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.770 
it is a defense mechanism when people
react<00:02:48.530> to<00:02:49.129> your<00:02:49.430> decision<00:02:49.910> to<00:02:50.090> live<00:02:50.750> a

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
react to your decision to live a

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.800 
react to your decision to live a
healthier<00:02:51.200> lifestyle<00:02:51.650> that<00:02:51.950> way<00:02:52.129> so<00:02:53.000> I<00:02:53.359> think

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
healthier lifestyle that way so I think

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.110 
healthier lifestyle that way so I think
it<00:02:54.109> helps<00:02:54.379> to<00:02:54.500> bring<00:02:54.650> awareness<00:02:54.769> of<00:02:55.220> that<00:02:55.370> and

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
it helps to bring awareness of that and

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.839 
it helps to bring awareness of that and
to<00:02:56.150> know<00:02:56.660> that<00:02:56.690> what<00:02:57.319> they're<00:02:57.470> saying<00:02:57.849> really

00:02:58.839 --> 00:02:58.849 
to know that what they're saying really

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:01.589 
to know that what they're saying really
doesn't<00:02:59.060> say<00:03:00.049> a<00:03:00.079> lot<00:03:00.140> about<00:03:00.319> you<00:03:00.739> it's<00:03:01.129> just

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:01.599 
doesn't say a lot about you it's just

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:05.319 
doesn't say a lot about you it's just
more<00:03:02.599> about<00:03:02.720> them<00:03:03.170> and<00:03:03.819> what<00:03:04.819> it<00:03:04.940> does<00:03:05.060> happen

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:05.329 
more about them and what it does happen

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:07.839 
more about them and what it does happen
and<00:03:05.810> it<00:03:06.049> probably<00:03:06.290> will<00:03:06.709> to<00:03:07.459> just<00:03:07.640> kind<00:03:07.790> of

00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:07.849 
and it probably will to just kind of

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:10.270 
and it probably will to just kind of
brush<00:03:08.090> it<00:03:08.239> off<00:03:08.390> and<00:03:08.690> recognize<00:03:09.170> that<00:03:09.280> maybe

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
brush it off and recognize that maybe

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.539 
brush it off and recognize that maybe
it's<00:03:10.489> their<00:03:10.670> path<00:03:10.940> to<00:03:11.900> to<00:03:12.470> do<00:03:12.620> that<00:03:12.799> to<00:03:13.159> be<00:03:13.489> an

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:13.549 
it's their path to to do that to be an

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:17.190 
it's their path to to do that to be an
obstacle<00:03:14.260> but<00:03:15.260> that's<00:03:15.739> that's<00:03:16.310> not<00:03:16.489> the<00:03:16.970> way

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
obstacle but that's that's not the way

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.559 
obstacle but that's that's not the way
you<00:03:18.200> live<00:03:18.410> your<00:03:18.440> life<00:03:18.799> and<00:03:19.120> and<00:03:20.120> that's<00:03:20.299> fine

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:20.569 
you live your life and and that's fine

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:23.110 
you live your life and and that's fine
and<00:03:21.069> you're<00:03:22.069> probably<00:03:22.340> not<00:03:22.790> going<00:03:22.910> to<00:03:23.000> have

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
and you're probably not going to have

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.300 
and you're probably not going to have
success<00:03:23.569> and<00:03:23.810> changing<00:03:24.230> them<00:03:24.260> if<00:03:24.680> you<00:03:25.010> scream

success and changing them if you scream

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:26.620 
success and changing them if you scream
and<00:03:25.459> yell<00:03:25.609> at<00:03:25.760> them<00:03:25.790> and<00:03:25.940> tell<00:03:26.239> them<00:03:26.299> they<00:03:26.599> need

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
and yell at them and tell them they need

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.289 
and yell at them and tell them they need
to<00:03:26.900> support<00:03:27.230> you<00:03:27.380> that<00:03:28.040> probably<00:03:28.430> won't<00:03:28.849> won't

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:29.299 
to support you that probably won't won't

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:32.890 
to support you that probably won't won't
change<00:03:29.599> things<00:03:30.129> and<00:03:31.129> really<00:03:32.030> you<00:03:32.660> know<00:03:32.750> the

change things and really you know the

change things and really you know the
best<00:03:33.079> motivation<00:03:33.769> isn't<00:03:34.069> going<00:03:34.579> to<00:03:34.669> come<00:03:34.879> from

that's a position to come from that's

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.159 
that's a position to come from that's
