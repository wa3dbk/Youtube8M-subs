 now even as we can even say 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.060
 Don Quixote knows it as Slovenia 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.779
 street aspects 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.279
 I 'm crashing the day anyway 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:31.579
 however we are here on titan pole because 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:36.000
 because I wanted to do this commentary 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:38.040
 with sentences because I have to well I was not 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.750
 obviously we are play is really 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.640
 very strong and there are none 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.200
 inverted commas in this sentence 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.100
 brothers because we really have some 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:49.290
 really huge and frax play skills 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.719
 however we are here because I have it 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:54.090
 tried it on pc and he tried it on xbox 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.059
 one so I want to hear at the beginning 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.309
 the feeling of frachey on the xbox one is 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.660
 it was me and the xbox one we never have 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.340
 had a good feeling 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.870
 well if I throw plot it is always his own a 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.000
 console level for then changed type 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.340
 ventor dc power supplies however for the rest 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.950
 so when the gentleman wants him 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.799
 power supplies xbox one functions we are 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.270
 I managed to play this beta 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:15.750
 that I received the key and the first 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.729
 impressions 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.220
 let's say they were good on the level 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.710
 playability though as like 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.020
 let's say it's rumored a bit around 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.030
 I was a little disappointed with the textures 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.880
 even though I then heard that they did 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.470
 even the sum has quadrupled 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.630
 the definition of injured textures on 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.130
 definitive game is the thing that has me 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.979
 made to remain a little ill then I don't know if 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.770
 maybe you'll agree too about it is 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:44.369
 that you then praise the robottoni high well 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.659
 tor 10 meters always 28 dc is recurrent is 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.170
 But you can't destroy a single one 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.369
 sapling 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:52.350
 eh yes the thing the thing will be distributed 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.189
 is distributed calculate of 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.189
 distribution 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.439
 the thing you want to destroy the environment 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.570
 surrounding 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:03.270
 you know you can't destroy it 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:06.299
 felt a mess of boxing I had to be 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.890
 to be honest when I saw it 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:11.760
 the game for the first time in colony 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.360
 I thought that then type something also like 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.760
 of 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.400
 super programmed as an explosion of 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.670
 palace or the titan that crashes 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:23.850
 at a certain point everything collapses 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:25.710
 I thought to see him in the beta I don't know now 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.920
 if in the final game, however, it will be certain 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:31.380
 you imagine the frax that if that game 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.270
 like you take the robot and turn you 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.370
 crashing across the map practically 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:40.950
 tv after two minutes would be tabula rasa 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:42.840
 of 16 days type on the beach to the sea 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:47.550
 from you where there is no one there 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:51.570
 quiet, however , I must be honest 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:54.480
 I must admit that a little bit of that is 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:56.340
 of education in a game of ci must 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.430
 then be something that I think 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:02.700
 ago there were certainly the fact that 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:04.500
 I think the weapons against the titans for i 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.480
 soldiers for the pilots on foot in my opinion 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.270
 they must be a little stronger 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.980
 because yes there is the missile what to do one 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:13.320
 from yoko lake or three four missiles e 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:16.200
 thrown down and feasible though but of 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:18.209
 that problem if you are if you fly 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.450
 titane if near type at a junction a 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:23.670
 of the walls just what short type you or do 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:27.150
 the slide with the titan says it crashes 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.890
 against the neighboring building but oh well 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.590
 it also depends on the environment where you are 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.970
 however, destruction is true 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.920
 that also in the first I had said 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.660
 time I remember that I tried the game 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.150
 I immediately said type aromas speaks because 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:41.430
 he was there and shit lomi images I'm 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.019
 game so if it could be destroyed 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:47.190
 destroy everything serves a cool 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:49.410
 hallucinating but I must say that now 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.590
 kind of truck game I don't know about me 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.700
 he took a mess because I enjoy myself 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.640
 also because you know what was entrusted 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.500
 according to me they come from anybody 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.170
 point and to me the fact of running on the wall 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.269
 I went in from the window to the lupine is 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.890
 one very cool thing is pretty cool 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:07.110
 that is, personally he also took me 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:09.510
 quite later because we say anyway 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:12.000
 which also done by the same 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:14.640
 from a part of those of the spi year 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.030
 developed have also worked on the various 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.980
 cod 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.600
 and that apart from the first modern 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:21.390
 warfare yes yes no 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:24.570
 mv three tests you do n't remember anyway 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:27.300
 if we say that playability is one 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:28.740
 frantic shooter let's say 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.740
 captivating then there is this thing that 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:34.950
 take the crazy titan super type weapons 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.690
 big cocks, that is, immense things very cool from 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:38.160
 use and also nice to play then 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:39.750
 he also took a lot from me 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.520
 here is only that we hope that with 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:44.070
 surely then they will do the 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:46.020
 respondent chaman is pronounced 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:49.200
 ethically they will do it with the game then 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.669
 in short, the 70- euro final will be released 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.520
 not in my opinion a belgium with and 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:56.790
 especially for new consoles 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:59.040
 generation even if they say that from various 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:00.000
 tests they did will turn will turn 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:03.000
 this game also quite 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.150
 also powerfully on the consoles or 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.160
 genre 60 asked for three yes to 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:10.560
 end however they do because everywhere 360 ​​e 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:15.210
 ps3 I am still very used also because 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:18.570
 if he fears flex, that is on ps 4 juan again 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:21.360
 They are not those anticipated titles out there 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:23.580
 watch dog if more postponed than beautiful 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:25.380
 that 9 but also because now they are there 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.870
 that is to say they are still objectively 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:30.870
 few titles in place of pro cliffs 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:32.250
 there is little choice, that is, therefore, one 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:33.090
 can play those four games for 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:34.590
 consul 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:37.740
 enough then they don't already have nothing left 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:39.780
 there are more than 250 billion games 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:43.500
 it means yes also because we are kind 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:45.030
 at the beginning of the great career of 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.310
 these new consoles that in my opinion to the 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:49.169
 end will smash a mess and why you 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:50.970
 let it fuel for a moment then second 

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:53.130
 me will come out of the European countries 

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:55.500
 epic stuff that I am still me 

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:59.180
 I remember we did n't go digging rose 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:00.510
 having seen the division, I was left with it 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:03.390
 quite 

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:05.190
 seneca I go to see you some tra 

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:07.920

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:16.830
 of time and then type which frozen and 

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:19.320
 max known in Milan type has me 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:23.000
 dislocated any piece of body 

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:27.150
 when he tried to find me on the couch 

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:30.180
 therefore at my age I love it 

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:32.460
 we know we have a sundial 

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:36.540
 or esata speaks of something else 

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:38.820

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:08.670
 destruction of the surrounding environment but 

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.270
 all in all I enjoy a casino 

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:12.750
