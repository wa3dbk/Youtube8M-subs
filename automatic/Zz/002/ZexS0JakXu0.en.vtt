which are a rather plain woman that

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.839 
which are a rather plain woman that
didn't<00:00:09.960> look<00:00:10.050> anything<00:00:10.320> at<00:00:10.559> all<00:00:10.740> although<00:00:11.580> I

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
didn't look anything at all although I

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.700 
didn't look anything at all although I
tend<00:00:12.360> to<00:00:12.450> think<00:00:12.780> they<00:00:12.960> sort<00:00:13.230> of<00:00:13.349> looked<00:00:13.590> a

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
tend to think they sort of looked a

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.519 
tend to think they sort of looked a
little<00:00:13.950> bit<00:00:14.099> alike<00:00:14.400> in<00:00:14.839> some<00:00:15.839> ways<00:00:15.900> their

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
little bit alike in some ways their

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.609 
little bit alike in some ways their
height<00:00:16.740> their<00:00:16.770> features<00:00:17.580> the<00:00:17.880> hair<00:00:18.029> color

height their features the hair color

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:22.990 
height their features the hair color
because<00:00:19.619> there<00:00:20.100> was<00:00:20.220> some<00:00:20.900> to<00:00:21.900> impersonate

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:23.000 
because there was some to impersonate

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.490 
because there was some to impersonate
Kate<00:00:24.000> I<00:00:24.300> thought<00:00:24.630> there<00:00:24.810> had<00:00:24.930> to<00:00:24.960> be<00:00:25.140> some

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
Kate I thought there had to be some

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.830 
Kate I thought there had to be some
there<00:00:25.980> must<00:00:26.160> be<00:00:26.310> some<00:00:26.730> somewhere<00:00:27.510> some

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
there must be some somewhere some

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.929 
there must be some somewhere some
similarity<00:00:28.380> there<00:00:28.619> but<00:00:29.250> not<00:00:29.400> a<00:00:29.460> compelling

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
similarity there but not a compelling

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.139 
similarity there but not a compelling
issue<00:00:30.240> they<00:00:30.750> say<00:00:30.960> see<00:00:31.650> what<00:00:32.009> I<00:00:32.040> think<00:00:32.460> happened

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
issue they say see what I think happened

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.209 
issue they say see what I think happened
at<00:00:33.390> this<00:00:33.719> point<00:00:34.110> and<00:00:34.350> here's<00:00:34.559> why<00:00:34.739> I<00:00:34.770> think<00:00:34.890> it

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
at this point and here's why I think it

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.119 
at this point and here's why I think it
was<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.340> suicide<00:00:36.260> rather<00:00:37.260> than<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:37.590> murder<00:00:37.829> which

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
was a suicide rather than a murder which

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.680 
was a suicide rather than a murder which
has<00:00:38.160> been<00:00:38.460> brought<00:00:38.640> up<00:00:38.910> a<00:00:39.030> number<00:00:39.180> of<00:00:39.420> times

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
has been brought up a number of times

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.380 
has been brought up a number of times
and<00:00:40.020> we<00:00:40.079> can<00:00:40.110> talk<00:00:40.440> about<00:00:40.469> that<00:00:40.920> I<00:00:41.390> think

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
and we can talk about that I think

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.600 
and we can talk about that I think
Lizzie<00:00:42.870> was<00:00:43.050> feeling<00:00:43.440> terrible<00:00:43.680> remorse<00:00:44.309> I

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
Lizzie was feeling terrible remorse I

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.700 
Lizzie was feeling terrible remorse I
think<00:00:44.940> first<00:00:45.270> of<00:00:45.480> all<00:00:45.629> we<00:00:45.690> know<00:00:46.050> from<00:00:46.320> Mertz

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
think first of all we know from Mertz

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.250 
think first of all we know from Mertz
'men<00:00:47.010> dr.<00:00:47.370> Mertz<00:00:47.550> meant<00:00:47.910> that<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.750> woman<00:00:49.110> who

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
'men dr. Mertz meant that the woman who

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.860 
'men dr. Mertz meant that the woman who
is<00:00:49.410> dead<00:00:49.710> had<00:00:49.950> had<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.190> child<00:00:50.610> before<00:00:50.850> now<00:00:51.809> you

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
is dead had had a child before now you

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.810 
is dead had had a child before now you
could<00:00:52.110> say<00:00:52.350> well<00:00:52.590> Kate<00:00:52.829> Morgan<00:00:53.309> had<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.489> child

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
could say well Kate Morgan had a child

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.610 
could say well Kate Morgan had a child
before<00:00:54.059> Eddie<00:00:54.770> but<00:00:56.059> but<00:00:57.059> my<00:00:57.360> surmise<00:00:57.840> is<00:00:58.289> that

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
before Eddie but but my surmise is that

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.650 
before Eddie but but my surmise is that
Lizzie<00:00:59.280> had<00:00:59.579> been<00:00:59.760> in<00:00:59.879> trouble<00:01:00.059> once<00:01:00.420> before

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
Lizzie had been in trouble once before

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.229 
Lizzie had been in trouble once before
and<00:01:01.020> had<00:01:01.199> been<00:01:01.379> forced<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:02.039> give<00:01:02.609> a<00:01:02.640> child<00:01:03.030> up

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
and had been forced to give a child up

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.140 
and had been forced to give a child up
for<00:01:03.420> adoption<00:01:03.920> this<00:01:04.920> is<00:01:05.100> her<00:01:05.220> second<00:01:05.670> round<00:01:05.850> of

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
for adoption this is her second round of

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.020 
for adoption this is her second round of
this<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:07.049> that<00:01:07.830> she<00:01:08.040> was<00:01:08.159> feeling<00:01:08.430> terrible

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
this and that she was feeling terrible

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.630 
this and that she was feeling terrible
remorse<00:01:09.390> because<00:01:09.780> now<00:01:10.229> she<00:01:10.290> knew<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:11.070> jig<00:01:11.430> was

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
remorse because now she knew the jig was

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.000 
remorse because now she knew the jig was
up<00:01:11.700> speckles<00:01:12.600> wasn't<00:01:12.960> paying<00:01:13.229> that<00:01:13.350> must<00:01:13.860> have

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
up speckles wasn't paying that must have

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.200 
up speckles wasn't paying that must have
been<00:01:14.159> becoming<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.670> parent<00:01:15.560> so<00:01:16.909> Kate<00:01:17.909> was

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
been becoming a parent so Kate was

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.450 
been becoming a parent so Kate was
betraying<00:01:18.750> her<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.380> I<00:01:19.680> think<00:01:19.950> Kate<00:01:20.189> Morgan

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
betraying her and I think Kate Morgan

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.070 
betraying her and I think Kate Morgan
actually<00:01:20.850> had<00:01:21.000> an<00:01:21.119> affair<00:01:21.450> with<00:01:21.600> John<00:01:21.840> long

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
actually had an affair with John long

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.380 
actually had an affair with John long
Phil<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:22.500> I<00:01:22.560> have<00:01:22.680> reason<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.100> think<00:01:23.220> that<00:01:23.610> and

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
Phil and I have reason to think that and

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.950 
Phil and I have reason to think that and
she's<00:01:25.080> feeling<00:01:25.970> regret<00:01:26.970> she's<00:01:27.240> now<00:01:27.450> lost<00:01:27.780> her

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
she's feeling regret she's now lost her

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.690 
she's feeling regret she's now lost her
sister<00:01:28.229> and<00:01:28.560> her<00:01:28.619> mother<00:01:28.920> who<00:01:29.280> she's<00:01:29.520> no

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
sister and her mother who she's no

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.060 
sister and her mother who she's no
longer<00:01:30.000> in<00:01:30.119> touch<00:01:30.150> with<00:01:30.630> whom<00:01:31.380> she<00:01:31.530> loves<00:01:31.770> very

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
longer in touch with whom she loves very

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.830 
longer in touch with whom she loves very
much<00:01:32.159> and<00:01:32.729> that's<00:01:32.850> an<00:01:33.000> important<00:01:33.479> point<00:01:33.689> to

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
much and that's an important point to

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
much and that's an important point to
note<00:01:33.960> and<00:01:34.970> I<00:01:35.970> think<00:01:36.329> she<00:01:36.570> was<00:01:36.750> at<00:01:37.049> a<00:01:37.110> terminal

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
note and I think she was at a terminal

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.039 
note and I think she was at a terminal
point<00:01:38.280> of<00:01:38.369> despair<00:01:38.909> and<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.420> drugs<00:01:39.720> she<00:01:40.020> was

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
point of despair and the drugs she was

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.440 
point of despair and the drugs she was
taking<00:01:40.650> had<00:01:40.860> reduced<00:01:41.460> her<00:01:41.729> to<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:41.939> physical

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
taking had reduced her to a physical

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.020 
taking had reduced her to a physical
wreck<00:01:42.720> so<00:01:43.560> I<00:01:43.619> think<00:01:43.680> what<00:01:44.100> she<00:01:44.280> wanted<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.820> do

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
wreck so I think what she wanted to do

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.749 
wreck so I think what she wanted to do
was<00:01:45.689> to<00:01:45.869> kill<00:01:46.110> herself<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:47.009> thereby<00:01:47.310> kill<00:01:47.579> the

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
was to kill herself and thereby kill the

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.240 
was to kill herself and thereby kill the
baby<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.240> put<00:01:48.299> it<00:01:48.540> out<00:01:48.659> of<00:01:48.689> its<00:01:48.960> misery<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:49.590> to

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
baby and put it out of its misery and to

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.370 
baby and put it out of its misery and to
kill<00:01:50.490> John<00:01:50.759> long<00:01:51.000> Phil<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:51.540> Kate<00:01:51.840> Morgan<00:01:52.110> if

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
kill John long Phil and Kate Morgan if

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.069

brought up to my attention is that until

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.470 
brought up to my attention is that until
that<00:02:25.770> time<00:02:26.040> there<00:02:26.250> was<00:02:26.459> no<00:02:26.700> smokeless<00:02:27.180> powder

that time there was no smokeless powder

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.900 
that time there was no smokeless powder
it<00:02:28.349> was<00:02:28.560> all<00:02:28.739> gunpowder<00:02:29.310> and<00:02:29.550> it<00:02:29.670> was<00:02:29.790> all

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
it was all gunpowder and it was all

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.229 
it was all gunpowder and it was all
terribly<00:02:30.390> messy<00:02:30.569> and<00:02:31.050> their<00:02:31.800> hand<00:02:32.280> and<00:02:32.489> the

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
terribly messy and their hand and the

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:34.850 
terribly messy and their hand and the
left's<00:02:33.599> that<00:02:33.840> whatever<00:02:34.260> the<00:02:34.440> side<00:02:34.650> of<00:02:34.800> the

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
probably the powder or whatever residue

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.150 
probably the powder or whatever residue
there<00:02:39.690> had<00:02:39.840> been<00:02:40.050> was<00:02:40.290> washed<00:02:40.590> away<00:02:40.800> by<00:02:41.099> this

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
there had been was washed away by this

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.520 
there had been was washed away by this
terrible<00:02:41.580> storm<00:02:42.000> because<00:02:42.840> we<00:02:42.989> know<00:02:43.140> she<00:02:43.200> was

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
terrible storm because we know she was

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.110 
terrible storm because we know she was
soaking<00:02:43.739> wet<00:02:44.099> so<00:02:45.739> I<00:02:46.739> think<00:02:47.120> there's

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
soaking wet so I think there's

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.259 
soaking wet so I think there's
sufficient<00:02:48.810> reason<00:02:49.230> to<00:02:49.350> think<00:02:49.590> she<00:02:50.269> committed

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
sufficient reason to think she committed

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:53.479 
sufficient reason to think she committed
suicide<00:02:51.299> due<00:02:51.989> to<00:02:52.200> depression<00:02:52.799> the<00:02:52.980> medicine

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
suicide due to depression the medicine

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.130 
suicide due to depression the medicine
she<00:02:53.700> felt<00:02:54.600> betrayed

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
she felt betrayed

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.380 
she felt betrayed
she<00:02:55.590> felt<00:02:55.860> she<00:02:56.100> was<00:02:56.310> killing<00:02:56.730> her<00:02:57.060> unborn

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
she felt she was killing her unborn

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.720 
she felt she was killing her unborn
child<00:02:57.920> she<00:02:58.920> must<00:02:59.130> have<00:02:59.220> been<00:02:59.340> terribly

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
child she must have been terribly

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.729 
child she must have been terribly
depressed<00:03:00.269> and<00:03:00.569> wanted<00:03:01.019> to<00:03:01.140> end<00:03:01.319> it

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
depressed and wanted to end it

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:03.470 
depressed and wanted to end it
and<00:03:01.860> I<00:03:01.980> think<00:03:02.220> that<00:03:02.370> makes<00:03:02.640> a<00:03:02.790> compelling<00:03:03.150> case

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
and I think that makes a compelling case

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.509 
and I think that makes a compelling case
for<00:03:03.540> suicide<00:03:04.200> why<00:03:04.560> would<00:03:04.890> the<00:03:05.010> ghost<00:03:05.190> of

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
for suicide why would the ghost of

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:06.530 
for suicide why would the ghost of
Lizzie<00:03:05.849> Wiley

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
Lizzie Wiley

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.830 
Lizzie Wiley

still hot at the Hotel del Coronado you
know<00:03:09.959> it's<00:03:10.140> a<00:03:10.260> wonderful<00:03:10.530> question<00:03:10.799> and<00:03:11.930> if

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
know it's a wonderful question and if

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.589 
know it's a wonderful question and if
you<00:03:12.989> believe<00:03:13.319> in<00:03:13.440> ghosts<00:03:13.860> and<00:03:14.239> I'm<00:03:15.239> not<00:03:15.390> ruling

you believe in ghosts and I'm not ruling

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:20.390 
you believe in ghosts and I'm not ruling
him<00:03:15.780> out<00:03:15.930> I<00:03:16.940> think<00:03:18.200> in<00:03:19.200> a<00:03:19.320> really<00:03:19.620> compelling

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
him out I think in a really compelling

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.940 
him out I think in a really compelling
way<00:03:20.579> I<00:03:20.730> think<00:03:21.239> she's<00:03:21.510> trying<00:03:22.230> to<00:03:22.410> tell<00:03:22.739> us<00:03:22.799> the

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
way I think she's trying to tell us the

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.030 
way I think she's trying to tell us the
story<00:03:23.190> of<00:03:23.760> who<00:03:24.269> she<00:03:24.510> is<00:03:24.540> and<00:03:24.989> what<00:03:25.799> really

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
story of who she is and what really

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.670 
story of who she is and what really
happened<00:03:26.579> and<00:03:26.850> I<00:03:27.600> think<00:03:27.660> Lizzie<00:03:28.140> is<00:03:28.290> probably

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
happened and I think Lizzie is probably

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.770 
happened and I think Lizzie is probably
still<00:03:28.950> stuck<00:03:29.250> in<00:03:29.400> the<00:03:29.519> moment<00:03:29.700> of<00:03:30.120> 1892<00:03:31.019> of

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
that terrible time when she had all this

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.520 
that terrible time when she had all this
hope<00:03:37.260> that<00:03:37.799> Kate<00:03:38.100> was<00:03:38.130> gonna<00:03:38.519> you<00:03:39.269> know
