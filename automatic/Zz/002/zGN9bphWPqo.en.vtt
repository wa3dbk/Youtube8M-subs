00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.840
 we are going to need 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:14.799
 to prepare our recipe for 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:16.960
 Carbonara noodles as I tell you 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:19.509
 way we're going to prepare for three or 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:22.090
 four people and we're going to need some 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:22.599
 350 grams of good noodles 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.090
 quality 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:28.119
 We're going to need two slices of ham 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:31.000
 de york thick two slices of bacon 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:33.580
 smoked also thick about 300 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.800
 milliliters of cream for medium cooking 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:38.589
 onion let's put a little bit of 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:41.650
 freshly scratched nutmeg we will need 

00:00:38.589 --> 00:00:44.140
 salt our freshly ground pepper 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.970
 extra virgin olive oil and then what 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:49.290
 we finished off with a little bit of cheese 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.290
 freshly grated parmesan 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.770
 The first thing we have done has been to put 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.750
 a pot filled with water to heat 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.310
 when it's almost ready to break 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.250
 boil that you can already appreciate we're going 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:03.140
 to put a tablespoon of salt for 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.870
 know our noodles we will continue 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.750
 the manufacturer's instructions and by 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:12.290
 another part I have minced the average 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:14.780
 onion to sticks I cut the 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:17.090
 bacon and squared our ham 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.820
 york I have put a little oil in 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:22.729
 a large pan not much because it's going 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.830
 to release some fat and now 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:26.020
 we're going to heat it up to make 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.790
 our sauce 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:31.100
 let's wait here 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:34.480
 here just broke the water and wine 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.480
 we will put the noodles 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:41.120
 let's go, how are we going to make a recipe for 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.120
 34 people 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:47.429
 we will calculate approximately 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:50.179
 350 grams of noodles with the packages 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:50.179
 500 grams 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:57.210
 these will be enough now they are going to go 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.650
 going down and when ramping through the water 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.150
 to boil, as I told you 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:03.120
 we will follow the instructions of 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:05.240
 manufacturer we are going to put to heat the 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.240
 oil 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.700
 now let's listen first what does 

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.700
 returns 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.820
 as guaranteeing the water to break 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:20.000
 well we see that the pasta is going 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.740
 sinking in the water and now we will remove 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.330
 so that it does not hit us because if 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.280
 We let it cook without removing it 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.980
 would stick one noodle to the other and it would 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.790
 a paste and like a paste that does not 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.790
 we are interested 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:42.940
 and leave over medium heat for about 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.940
 eight to nine minutes 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:58.790
 here I already have the hot oil and go 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:02.469
 to go throwing our onion 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.469
 we are going to put a little salt 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.320
 and slowly he's going to tell what 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.850
 we see that we are owed because we are up 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.520
 carbonara interests us to come out 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:17.190
 blanquita then the onion we are going to 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.520
 lower the fire so that it puts the 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.520
 little steps 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.750
 we have the transparent onion 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:29.140
 medium fire has been throwing us in the 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:32.349
 doubles let's put the bacon and what 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:35.200
 sofreÃ­r we will also see that it will 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:39.420
 loose fat too, which is going to 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.420
 cut the oil that we need 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:47.640
 we already have golden our verb and the 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:53.940
 we are going to put as children only the 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:56.599
 devil and we will add the silver is pleasant 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.599
 to cook 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.879
 we already have we are going to put the much 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.980
 we are going to put 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:16.450
 a hit of freshly ground black pepper 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:21.750
 and a little bit of blood the salt we're going 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:24.750
 to always rectify at the end and if 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:27.630
 we are left bland and too thick in 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:29.430
 our sauce we can put a 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.860
 little water from the cooking of the 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:34.169
 noodles that thus lighten we have the 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:38.750
 salsa and we will give you a little more of 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:43.190
 more flavor that has salt 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:45.470
 we also give you the guide of your scale 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:48.290
 unrolled 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:53.390
 and the time you are going to cook the sauce 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:57.470
 it's going to be about 23 minutes 4 and maximum 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:05:00.400
 time that we have left to cook our 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:00.400
 our pasta 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:08.159
 Well, we have our pasta 

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:10.199
 cooked just tried the sauce that already 

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:13.349
 we have it as the cream reduces a lot 

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:15.150
 and it stays quite thick because I've 

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:17.039
 tried and it's bland because it just barely 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:20.400
 put to then I'm going to rectify 

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:23.039
 of salt with the own water to cook in 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:25.319
 our spaces that is salty 

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:28.169
 let's go putting what they have 

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:30.029
 humidity that's going to make our sauce 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:31.650
 stay a little lighter and if you want 

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:35.249
 it lacked a little more moisture 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:38.669
 we will add a spoonful of water from the 

00:05:35.249 --> 00:05:41.090
 own we're going to mix for about 

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:41.090
 seconds 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:50.009
 I'm going to put a couple of tablespoons of 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:51.930
 cooking water 

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:54.270
 as I say to you taken in the point of 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:56.510
 salting and that will wait a little bit 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:59.000
 our sauce 

00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:02.200
 and we already have it to use well 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.390
 we already have our 

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:06.280
 our noodles and we 're going to put 

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:08.730
 some fresh Parmesan cheese 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:08.730
 grated 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:18.180
 they smell wonderful 

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:18.180
 I'm going to put a little thread of oil 

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:27.330
 and a leaf of parsley and we have it 

00:06:23.819 --> 00:06:32.060
