didn't see some footage of Cayetano
instances<00:01:06.240> he's<00:01:06.600> ok<00:01:07.080> I<00:01:07.110> guess<00:01:07.200> I<00:01:07.530> could<00:01:07.680> see

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
instances he's ok I guess I could see

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.280 
instances he's ok I guess I could see
how<00:01:08.040> he<00:01:08.100> won<00:01:08.430> 17<00:01:08.670> fights<00:01:09.240> but<00:01:09.870> at<00:01:10.050> the<00:01:10.140> end<00:01:10.170> of

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
how he won 17 fights but at the end of

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.950 
how he won 17 fights but at the end of
the<00:01:10.380> day<00:01:10.530> he<00:01:10.830> seems<00:01:11.220> like<00:01:11.430> he<00:01:11.729> he's<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.510> little

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
the day he seems like he he's a little

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.140 
the day he seems like he he's a little
Cheney<00:01:13.290> in<00:01:13.470> my<00:01:13.680> opinion<00:01:13.980> I<00:01:14.280> feel<00:01:14.790> like<00:01:14.880> if<00:01:15.030> you

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
Cheney in my opinion I feel like if you

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.760 
Cheney in my opinion I feel like if you
touch<00:01:15.600> him<00:01:15.780> clean<00:01:16.080> on<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.290> chain<00:01:16.470> I<00:01:16.500> think

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
touch him clean on the chain I think

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.250 
touch him clean on the chain I think
he'll<00:01:16.920> go<00:01:17.070> down<00:01:17.570> he's<00:01:18.570> never<00:01:18.750> been<00:01:18.960> stopped

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:19.260 
he'll go down he's never been stopped

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:20.930 
he'll go down he's never been stopped
though<00:01:19.410> but<00:01:19.650> I<00:01:19.710> think<00:01:19.920> Leo<00:01:20.160> Santa<00:01:20.340> Cruz<00:01:20.520> will

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:20.940 
though but I think Leo Santa Cruz will

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.880 
though but I think Leo Santa Cruz will
stop<00:01:21.210> him<00:01:21.420> looking<00:01:22.410> at<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.560> love<00:01:22.740> of

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
stop him looking at the love of

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:27.120 
hasn't been the best so you know he

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.390 
hasn't been the best so you know he
should<00:01:27.750> be<00:01:27.870> an<00:01:27.960> easy<00:01:28.110> easy<00:01:28.620> fight<00:01:29.010> for<00:01:29.280> Leo

be an easy win for Leo Santa Cruz he

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.870 
be an easy win for Leo Santa Cruz he
should<00:01:42.690> take<00:01:43.020> care<00:01:43.320> of<00:01:43.440> him<00:01:43.650> I<00:01:43.890> think<00:01:44.730> within

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
should take care of him I think within

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.520 
should take care of him I think within
six<00:01:45.180> rounds<00:01:45.540> or<00:01:45.660> possibly<00:01:46.080> go<00:01:46.260> the<00:01:46.320> distance

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
six rounds or possibly go the distance

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.280 
six rounds or possibly go the distance
but<00:01:46.950> it<00:01:47.160> should<00:01:47.310> be<00:01:47.340> an<00:01:47.490> easy<00:01:47.610> fight<00:01:47.880> for<00:01:48.090> Leo
