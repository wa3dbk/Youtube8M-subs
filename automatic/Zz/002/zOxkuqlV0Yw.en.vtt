00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 what's up manuel today I'll be doing 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.779
 the definitive buki time today seemed to me 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.490
 does one because I almost never make tags 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.469
 so then why not make a 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.019
 truth this consists of some questions 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.969
 as to know more my habits of 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.590
 reading then let's start with the 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.590
 questions are ways of going by car 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.970
 no no way I love them in the car 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.970
 because you can be on the road 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.880
 may be going I do not know galleries or 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.080
 somewhere else I read with music and I 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.210
 love reading with music I always 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.420
 small music solution but with the 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.219
 I like high and strong car because I do not 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.630
 I know why I just concentrate more on the 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.270
 book and I like more how the 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.950
 environment the music i'm weird i 6 so 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.530
 leave in peace that car has a style 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:47.100
 unique and special for you definitely 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.379
 it has to be john hore and whale and he 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.760
 wrote this book without mauer tings 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.670
 comeback and right now I'm reading 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:57.829
 these others that I read it because I love 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:00.210
 and his writing style is 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:02.489
 awesome writes so beautiful and 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.870
 describes things super well I love 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.280
 how the characters write 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:10.010
 awesome I love it if you have not read 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.330
 this book have to read it go to 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.400
 buy them I do not know what they are doing well 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.690
 our full video harry potter o 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.550
 twilight are not really 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.930
 asking this of course that harry 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.550
 potter but he has not read any of the 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.650
 two series but all the films of 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.390
 the two laws then I prefer harry 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.280
 potter a thousand times because he is harry potter 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.260
 He usually carries backpacks and that's how 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.850
 in it part of books not only 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.070
 they carry in a backpack some part and if 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.510
 I have a book in my hand and 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.490
 I have my cell phone headsets 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:35.870
 books with or without illustrations to me 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.020
 they like more the drawings illustrations 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:40.250
 because if the drawings and social I am 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.710
 I imagine helps the basis of 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.420
 world things if I like when the book 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.940
 It is very complicated and has a lot of history 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.560
 but if I do not like to imagine it like me 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.869
 I do not want to see who else they put me 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.670
 the characters of mind or the scenario 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:54.140
 a book you have was and when it happened 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.330
 the time you realized that no 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.670
 it was worth nothing happened to me something similar with 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.860
 counter crispan this aleksandar bracken 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.240
 this at first he had given four 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.250
 stars and I thought it was like it is 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.200
 super father but I'll think about direct 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.660
 It's not so good and I gave it three stars 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.009
 but it's not like I say it but it does not 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.510
 best book that thinks you a 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.990
 funny story about some book of 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.160
 your childhood 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:18.600
 I do not believe my life is boring and not if not 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.550
 what is the finite book of your 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.310
 shelf will have to be from crate 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:26.610
 gatsby de scott fitzgerald this book 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:29.280
 it has about one hundred how many pages 115 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.290
 pages you have not read it I tried to read 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.230
 I'm not liking it, I think it's reading 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:37.890
 soon but with another vision because I do not 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.060
 I like how the pages look at me, not which 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.770
 It's the fattest book on your bookshelf 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.420
 I am between two because for example they are 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.700
 monsters of men of patterns that is the 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.709
 Last book in the trilogy of the 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:49.350
 walking siqueiros walking this same 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:51.060
 It has 610 pages but it took me three 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:55.800
 days of reading it and as you can see it has 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:57.989
 many letters on the page then I 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.820
 I read it super fast and such a book 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:02.790
 intense have to see those delights of 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:04.709
 Law 2 but I also have two leaders 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.840
 of the book breaker as you can see is 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:09.450
 longer than my head and bigger 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.010
 is super super fat but this book 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:15.180
 have in 577 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:18.930
 but it is super high and apart it has as 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.879
 that the lyrics are not that big and in this 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:24.060
 it took me two weeks to read it so 

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:25.530
 I do not know I do not know what you write if it's like that 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.329
 you see as a writer if I write in fact 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.519
 I'm writing a book right now and if 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:32.069
 not if I would like to be a big writer 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:33.870
 but as a second profession what is your 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:35.400
 classic favorite I do not have classic 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.220
 preferred because all the graphics that 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.500
 He read the hated ones but like that the 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.019
 I want to burn and not see them again 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.790
 they collide the ones that I have read I am not a 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:46.379
 person of classics the truth in the 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:50.549
 school you are good at 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:53.159
 language arts or ski literature and in 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:57.299
 As for the school, I am very bad at 

00:03:53.159 --> 00:04:01.680
 Spanish or in arts was x I say be every 8 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:03.870
 or 7 nothing like that wow if someone 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.269
 give a book you hate you love what 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.940
 I would accept, be it, yes, thank you very much 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:11.069
 super excited but in the end what 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.739
 I would sell and I bought a book that is yes 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:15.449
 I want to read that you have similar to Harry 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:17.680
 potter the bass to game that is not very 

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:19.930
 known and usually 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.240
 the first book in Spanish the second 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.750
 two no but all ways if they are in 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.680
 English 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:30.100
 and read it in English because I measurement 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:32.500
 sounds like a bad habit when it comes to 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:35.800
 record I have enough getting to try 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:37.810
 my fingers a lot and I look into space 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:40.120
 like five minutes and I'm running out of 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:40.810
 camera memory what is your word 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.539
 preferred 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:45.220
 the truth is that I know I have no idea I'm 

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:47.470
 of those people who change a lot of 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.340
 opinion every time then if a 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.780
 favorite word 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.979
 the recent ones already bring it later to the 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.020
 next jealous way and then without 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:54.580
 I have to do another then it is 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:58.050
 complicated thing you consider yourself 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:05:01.020
 net-worm other I do not know that that could have 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:03.690
 Well, I do not know 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:06.629
 and as a classification r I am not 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:10.020
 smart I do not know vampires or the fairies 

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:13.080
 100% I love the fairy urban fantasy 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:15.240
 and goblins and all that kind of stuff 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.879
 love more than vampires do not 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:20.009
 thanks ghosts men or ghosts 

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:22.169
 of course I love this kind of 

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:24.210
 things that scare me I love reading a 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:26.099
 book that was all ghosts but 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:28.050
 I have not found one that actually 

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:30.150
 be scary if I want to read a book that 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:32.340
 give fear so yes zombie ghosts 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:33.690
 zombie vampires of course I've had 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.130
 lots of dreams with zombies and 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:36.389
 zombie apocalypse I love the 

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:37.949
 zombies will one day pass a 

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:41.280
 apocalypse that open triangles

 amorous or forbidden love none here 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.539
 It's always a cabal, I catch it when I'm 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:48.389
 recording I do not understand romantic books or 

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:50.340
 of action with a romantic upset 

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:52.860
 I have never read a book if it is of 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:56.610
 romance romance romance the read the 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:58.080
 fantastic or fantastical fantasy that yes 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:00.240
 have a little love so I'm leaving 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.530
 with the little bit of love because I do not 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:04.819

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:04.819
