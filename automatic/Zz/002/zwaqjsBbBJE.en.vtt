inerrancy<00:00:07.720> has<00:00:07.960> been<00:00:08.050> a<00:00:08.080> hotbed<00:00:08.440> issue<00:00:08.620> for

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:08.920 
inerrancy has been a hotbed issue for

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.400 
inerrancy has been a hotbed issue for
evangelicals<00:00:09.760> for<00:00:10.000> a<00:00:10.030> long<00:00:10.270> time<00:00:10.570> and<00:00:10.930> there's

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:11.410 
evangelicals for a long time and there's

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:14.310 
evangelicals for a long time and there's
a<00:00:11.469> sense<00:00:11.799> in<00:00:11.980> which<00:00:12.010> this<00:00:12.870> volume<00:00:13.870> simply

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:14.320 
a sense in which this volume simply

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.560 
a sense in which this volume simply
continues<00:00:14.980> a<00:00:15.009> debate<00:00:15.490> that<00:00:15.849> really<00:00:16.119> hasn't

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:16.570 
continues a debate that really hasn't

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.190 
continues a debate that really hasn't
ever<00:00:16.990> stopped<00:00:17.650> and<00:00:18.210> in<00:00:19.210> a<00:00:19.300> nutshell<00:00:19.509> what<00:00:19.990> I'm

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:20.200 
ever stopped and in a nutshell what I'm

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.269 
ever stopped and in a nutshell what I'm
trying<00:00:20.680> to<00:00:20.740> argue<00:00:21.010> is<00:00:21.580> that<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:23.650> Bible<00:00:24.130> itself

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:24.279 
trying to argue is that the Bible itself

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:27.570 
trying to argue is that the Bible itself
contains<00:00:25.210> plurality<00:00:26.080> and<00:00:26.369> if<00:00:27.369> we're

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:27.580 
contains plurality and if we're

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.279 
contains plurality and if we're
committed<00:00:28.000> to<00:00:28.029> a<00:00:28.150> notion<00:00:28.570> of<00:00:28.630> an<00:00:28.750> air<00:00:28.900> and<00:00:29.080> sea

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:29.289 
committed to a notion of an air and sea

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:33.299 
committed to a notion of an air and sea
then<00:00:30.010> we<00:00:30.279> have<00:00:30.490> to<00:00:30.730> affirm<00:00:31.179> that<00:00:32.309> the

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:33.309 
then we have to affirm that the

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:35.280 
then we have to affirm that the
plurality<00:00:33.610> of<00:00:34.120> truth<00:00:34.420> is<00:00:34.690> part<00:00:34.960> of<00:00:35.050> God's

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:35.290 
plurality of truth is part of God's

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.490 
plurality of truth is part of God's
design<00:00:35.800> so<00:00:36.580> I<00:00:36.610> believe<00:00:37.000> as<00:00:37.330> inerrancy<00:00:37.989> has

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:38.500 
design so I believe as inerrancy has

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.820 
design so I believe as inerrancy has
traditionally<00:00:39.159> asserted<00:00:39.760> that<00:00:40.799> Scripture<00:00:41.799> is

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:41.830 
traditionally asserted that Scripture is

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:45.289 
traditionally asserted that Scripture is
true<00:00:42.370> and<00:00:42.670> and<00:00:43.390> we<00:00:44.049> can<00:00:44.170> even<00:00:44.350> say<00:00:44.620> inerrant

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:45.299 
true and and we can even say inerrant

00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:47.789 
true and and we can even say inerrant
but<00:00:46.299> if<00:00:46.449> this<00:00:46.600> is<00:00:46.780> the<00:00:46.900> case<00:00:47.110> then<00:00:47.470> what<00:00:47.620> we

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:47.799 
but if this is the case then what we

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:50.700 
but if this is the case then what we
learn<00:00:48.070> about<00:00:48.430> the<00:00:49.269> nature<00:00:49.720> of<00:00:49.750> truth<00:00:50.229> and<00:00:50.589> the

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:50.710 
learn about the nature of truth and the

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.359 
learn about the nature of truth and the
nature<00:00:51.100> of<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:52.570> God<00:00:52.750> we<00:00:53.019> serve<00:00:53.190> from<00:00:54.190> the

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:54.369 
nature of the God we serve from the

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:57.000 
nature of the God we serve from the
witness<00:00:54.729> of<00:00:54.850> Scripture<00:00:55.299> and<00:00:55.920> scripture<00:00:56.920> is

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.010 
witness of Scripture and scripture is

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.430 
witness of Scripture and scripture is
characterized<00:00:57.610> by<00:00:57.729> plurality<00:00:58.059> so<00:00:58.930> my<00:00:59.170> basic

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 
characterized by plurality so my basic

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.770 
characterized by plurality so my basic
thesis<00:00:59.890> would<00:01:00.309> be<00:01:00.519> if<00:01:00.790> Scripture<00:01:01.330> is<00:01:01.479> truth

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:01.780 
thesis would be if Scripture is truth

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.770 
thesis would be if Scripture is truth
written<00:01:02.199> even<00:01:03.070> inerrant<00:01:03.790> truth<00:01:04.150> written<00:01:04.600> and

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
written even inerrant truth written and

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.160 
written even inerrant truth written and
if<00:01:05.379> scripture<00:01:05.860> contains<00:01:06.150> plurality<00:01:07.170> then

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
if scripture contains plurality then

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.200 
if scripture contains plurality then
truth<00:01:08.790> must<00:01:09.790> be<00:01:10.060> a<00:01:10.660> plural<00:01:11.560> matter<00:01:11.970> this<00:01:12.970> has

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210 
truth must be a plural matter this has

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.570 
truth must be a plural matter this has
significance<00:01:13.900> because<00:01:14.140> if<00:01:14.920> we<00:01:15.310> think<00:01:15.430> about

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:15.580 
significance because if we think about

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.910 
significance because if we think about
theology<00:01:16.030> the<00:01:16.660> tendency<00:01:17.170> is<00:01:17.260> often<00:01:17.650> to<00:01:17.740> say

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
theology the tendency is often to say

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.800 
theology the tendency is often to say
well<00:01:18.130> what<00:01:18.280> do<00:01:18.430> we<00:01:18.460> do<00:01:18.760> with<00:01:18.970> statements<00:01:19.630> in

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
well what do we do with statements in

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.360 
well what do we do with statements in
Scripture<00:01:20.290> that<00:01:20.320> might<00:01:20.710> appear<00:01:21.130> to<00:01:21.160> be

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:21.370 
Scripture that might appear to be

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.000 
Scripture that might appear to be
intention<00:01:22.300> and<00:01:22.450> one<00:01:23.380> of<00:01:23.470> the<00:01:23.560> standard<00:01:23.980> ways

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.010 
intention and one of the standard ways

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:25.980 
intention and one of the standard ways
that<00:01:24.520> that's<00:01:25.180> been<00:01:25.420> worked<00:01:25.600> out<00:01:25.780> in<00:01:25.840> the

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
that that's been worked out in the

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:27.690 
that that's been worked out in the
theological<00:01:26.230> tradition<00:01:27.130> is<00:01:27.250> how<00:01:27.430> do<00:01:27.490> we

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
theological tradition is how do we

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.580 
theological tradition is how do we
resolve<00:01:28.300> the<00:01:28.510> tension<00:01:28.960> how<00:01:29.080> do<00:01:29.140> we<00:01:29.320> show<00:01:29.560> that

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
resolve the tension how do we show that

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.910 
resolve the tension how do we show that
the<00:01:29.980> texts<00:01:30.340> really<00:01:30.580> do<00:01:31.260> cohere<00:01:32.260> and<00:01:32.470> might<00:01:32.710> not

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
the texts really do cohere and might not

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.910 
the texts really do cohere and might not
say<00:01:33.909> what<00:01:34.270> they<00:01:34.480> it<00:01:35.020> might<00:01:35.200> appear<00:01:35.560> that<00:01:35.590> they

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
say what they it might appear that they

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.710 
say what they it might appear that they
say<00:01:36.420> and<00:01:37.420> I<00:01:37.810> would<00:01:38.110> suggest<00:01:38.290> rather<00:01:38.800> than

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
say and I would suggest rather than

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.990 
say and I would suggest rather than
trying<00:01:40.720> to<00:01:40.930> make<00:01:41.110> all<00:01:41.650> the<00:01:41.920> text<00:01:42.310> go<00:01:42.490> here<00:01:42.820> that

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
trying to make all the text go here that

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.840 
trying to make all the text go here that
we<00:01:43.180> respect<00:01:43.780> the<00:01:43.900> plurality<00:01:44.230> that<00:01:44.980> is

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
we respect the plurality that is

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.060 
we respect the plurality that is
inherent<00:01:46.510> in<00:01:46.630> these<00:01:46.810> texts<00:01:47.380> as<00:01:47.500> part<00:01:47.890> of<00:01:47.950> the

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
inherent in these texts as part of the

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.940 
inherent in these texts as part of the
inerrant<00:01:48.430> Word<00:01:48.580> of<00:01:48.729> God<00:01:49.200> when<00:01:50.200> this<00:01:50.350> volume<00:01:50.800> is

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
inerrant Word of God when this volume is

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.260 
inerrant Word of God when this volume is
published<00:01:51.370> I<00:01:51.490> expect<00:01:51.880> that<00:01:52.000> there<00:01:52.150> will<00:01:52.210> be

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
published I expect that there will be

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.810 
published I expect that there will be
people<00:01:52.570> that<00:01:52.750> will<00:01:53.080> be<00:01:53.370> excited<00:01:54.370> about<00:01:54.520> some

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
people that will be excited about some

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.820 
people that will be excited about some
of<00:01:54.850> the<00:01:55.000> views<00:01:55.300> and<00:01:55.510> open<00:01:55.900> to<00:01:56.110> the<00:01:56.229> diversity

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
of the views and open to the diversity

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.460 
of the views and open to the diversity
of<00:01:56.880> positions<00:01:57.880> at<00:01:58.150> a<00:01:58.180> discussion<00:01:58.659> and<00:01:58.990> other

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
of positions at a discussion and other

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.460 
of positions at a discussion and other
people<00:01:59.920> will<00:02:00.070> say<00:02:00.340> this<00:02:01.270> is<00:02:01.479> evidence<00:02:01.960> of<00:02:02.260> the

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
people will say this is evidence of the

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.800 
people will say this is evidence of the
slippage<00:02:02.979> of<00:02:03.220> a<00:02:03.280> commitment<00:02:03.640> to<00:02:03.880> inerrancy<00:02:04.420> in

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
slippage of a commitment to inerrancy in

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.140 
slippage of a commitment to inerrancy in
the<00:02:04.900> evangelical<00:02:05.680> community<00:02:05.890> and<00:02:06.520> so<00:02:06.760> we<00:02:06.940> have

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 
the evangelical community and so we have

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.050 
the evangelical community and so we have
to<00:02:07.390> hunker<00:02:08.110> down<00:02:08.140> again<00:02:08.830> and<00:02:09.129> reassert<00:02:09.819> the

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
to hunker down again and reassert the

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.699 
to hunker down again and reassert the
traditional<00:02:10.599> view<00:02:11.040> my<00:02:12.040> hope<00:02:12.310> would<00:02:12.610> be<00:02:12.670> that

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
traditional view my hope would be that

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:15.880 
traditional view my hope would be that
the<00:02:14.709> volume<00:02:15.220> can
