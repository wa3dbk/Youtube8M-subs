 Chichera power plants as 

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:06.810
 this california little by little becomes 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.089
 typical phenomenon of American cities 

00:00:09.089 --> 00:00:11.849
 according to the association legally office 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.099
 last year consumption 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:15.270
 renewable energy usa 

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:17.249
 grew by 45 percent 

00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:19.000
 equipping others 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.160
 giant projects doesn't make it possible 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.759
 application mainly 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:24.409
 Russian minister 

00:00:24.409 --> 00:00:26.939
 Present understands a little bit familiar 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.939
 with the materials present in the cashier 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.689
 when judge p 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:34.680
 until some step energy 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.539
 needs your home such a turbine 

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:39.250
 satisfies by 25 30 percent but if 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:40.359
 authenticate and 

00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:42.559
 kilowatt which is more powerful than traditional 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:44.010
 two times it will produce 100 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.940
 percent of required energy 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.820
 new system is part of 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.410
 exhibition environmentally friendly 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.170
 technology categorical garden 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:52.160

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.590
 exhibition organizers 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:54.840
 inspired the idea of ​​using 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.410
 medication front 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.060
 the police I'm grinding 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.100
 the company led to the loss of the test 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.220
 prototype to prove it 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:04.440
 ability to compete with 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.370
 traditional turbines 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:09.100
 but the huge parish of the holy cloister is often 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.740
 become 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.020
 the reason for the death of the bird is also pretty 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.630
 noisy so much how to move 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.000
 faster will not have a positive effect 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.470
 Kirgins fecal themselves let's say 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.780
 love heel analyzers please 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.640
 because the turbine speed in 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.439
 two and a half times the wind speed and 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:24.880
 birds can see her 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.140
 highly sensitive Smolensk all this 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:28.820
 lets out of the flotilla of children 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.480
 wind turbine so if you enter 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.030
 consumers who can check 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.190
 how much copper to get incompetence 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.810
 I'm sorry it turns out and not 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.870
 allows you to set the volume of the entire 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:40.660
 consumed energy authors 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:41.710
 wind speed 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.850
 energy that gets pinched 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:44.870
 computer 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:46.630
 new TV interview models 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.210
 attracts him from the attack 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.719
 bystanders detective count become 

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:52.960
