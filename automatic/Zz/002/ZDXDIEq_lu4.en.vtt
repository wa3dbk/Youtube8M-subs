of<00:05:42.189> them<00:05:42.370> are<00:05:43.330> really<00:05:43.840> overpowered<00:05:44.500> with

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:44.590 
of them are really overpowered with

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:49.529 
of them are really overpowered with
everyone<00:05:45.719> but<00:05:47.490> yeah<00:05:48.490> I<00:05:48.789> honestly<00:05:49.300> couldn't

00:05:49.529 --> 00:05:49.539 
everyone but yeah I honestly couldn't
