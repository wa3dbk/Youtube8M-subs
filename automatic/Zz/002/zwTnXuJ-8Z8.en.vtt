and it is I got it to wear with all my
corals<00:03:35.239> and<00:03:35.390> my<00:03:35.510> oranges<00:03:35.989> because<00:03:36.140> it<00:03:36.350> is<00:03:36.440> a

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
corals and my oranges because it is a

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.509 
corals and my oranges because it is a
really<00:03:36.860> true<00:03:37.760> coral<00:03:38.480> lip<00:03:39.410> liner<00:03:39.650> and<00:03:39.980> I

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519 
really true coral lip liner and I

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:42.759 
really true coral lip liner and I
actually<00:03:40.700> think<00:03:41.120> it's<00:03:41.239> a<00:03:41.390> soft<00:03:41.690> texture<00:03:42.260> these

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:42.769 
actually think it's a soft texture these

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:44.830 
actually think it's a soft texture these
are<00:03:42.920> all<00:03:43.070> the<00:03:43.370> same<00:03:43.400> formula<00:03:44.180> these<00:03:44.510> are<00:03:44.690> all

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
are all the same formula these are all

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.880 
are all the same formula these are all
of<00:03:45.110> the<00:03:45.430> just<00:03:46.430> their<00:03:46.489> lip<00:03:46.790> pencil<00:03:47.120> formula<00:03:47.890> but

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890 
of the just their lip pencil formula but

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:50.770 
of the just their lip pencil formula but
some<00:03:49.160> of<00:03:49.280> them<00:03:49.340> are<00:03:49.459> drier<00:03:50.060> than<00:03:50.390> the<00:03:50.510> others

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
some of them are drier than the others

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.300 
some of them are drier than the others
if<00:03:50.959> that<00:03:51.079> makes<00:03:51.230> any<00:03:51.290> sense<00:03:51.410> and<00:03:51.739> this<00:03:52.130> one's

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
if that makes any sense and this one's

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.390 
if that makes any sense and this one's
really<00:03:52.519> creamy<00:03:52.850> I<00:03:53.000> like<00:03:53.180> that<00:03:53.329> one<00:03:53.590> and<00:03:54.590> then<00:03:55.370> I

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:05.439 
she raves about this and she's right
it's<00:06:58.800> so<00:06:59.190> good<00:06:59.430> it's<00:06:59.460> a<00:06:59.669> twist<00:06:59.970> up<00:07:00.150> liner<00:07:04.130> and

00:07:05.439 --> 00:07:05.449 
it's so good it's a twist up liner and

00:07:05.449 --> 00:07:07.730 
it's so good it's a twist up liner and
it's<00:07:06.449> a<00:07:06.539> little<00:07:06.750> bit<00:07:06.870> more<00:07:06.990> of<00:07:07.050> that<00:07:07.169> peachy

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:07.740 
it's a little bit more of that peachy

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:11.270 
it's a little bit more of that peachy
toned<00:07:08.069> nude<00:07:08.520> and<00:07:08.940> it's<00:07:09.840> just<00:07:10.139> so<00:07:10.410> it's<00:07:10.650> so<00:07:11.069> nice

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:11.280 
toned nude and it's just so it's so nice

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:14.360 
toned nude and it's just so it's so nice
it's<00:07:11.550> really<00:07:12.000> soft<00:07:12.270> really<00:07:12.690> creamy<00:07:13.220> these<00:07:14.220> are

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:14.370 
it's really soft really creamy these are

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:17.149 
it's really soft really creamy these are
I<00:07:14.550> think<00:07:14.819> three<00:07:15.210> dollars<00:07:15.680> it's<00:07:16.680> the<00:07:16.830> lip<00:07:16.979> liner

00:07:17.149 --> 00:07:17.159 
I think three dollars it's the lip liner

00:07:17.159 --> 00:07:18.499 
I think three dollars it's the lip liner
on<00:07:17.280> one<00:07:17.430> side<00:07:17.639> and<00:07:17.669> then<00:07:17.970> on<00:07:18.030> the<00:07:18.150> other<00:07:18.180> side

00:07:18.499 --> 00:07:18.509 
on one side and then on the other side

00:07:18.509 --> 00:07:20.149 
on one side and then on the other side
is<00:07:18.630> a<00:07:18.659> brush<00:07:18.960> obviously<00:07:19.530> I've<00:07:19.650> never<00:07:19.830> used

00:07:20.149 --> 00:07:20.159 
is a brush obviously I've never used

00:07:20.159 --> 00:07:22.820

that<00:07:20.400> to<00:07:21.300> blend<00:07:21.539> it<00:07:21.690> but<00:07:21.930> you<00:07:22.259> certainly<00:07:22.440> could

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:22.830 
that to blend it but you certainly could

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:24.830 
that to blend it but you certainly could
or<00:07:23.430> you<00:07:23.460> could<00:07:23.699> use<00:07:23.880> it<00:07:24.000> as<00:07:24.060> a<00:07:24.120> lip<00:07:24.330> brush<00:07:24.449> so

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:24.840
