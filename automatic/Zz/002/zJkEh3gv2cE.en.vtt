00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.920
 and passing the time I started to start 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.040
 already 

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:08.000
 how inexorably time has passed 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.000
 of my face 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:15.830
 I'm going to meet 52 hours and one does not 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:18.470
 feels so I compare the 30 when one 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.330
 is young Lorraine thought what to do to 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.369
 hide dark circles or spots that the 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.770
 time had installed on his skin and 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.600
 she began to put on makeup until it came 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.580
 the possibility of injecting their own 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.769
 stem cells but what are the cells 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.930
 mother the medicine of the future explains to 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:35.210
 doctors raúl rivers and white guy 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:38.059
 part of the medical equipment of cord life and 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.710
 look at a controversial issue still for 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:41.540
 many because it borders the limits of 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.089
 human knowledge and open a universe 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:48.100
 of therapeutic possibilities that up 

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:48.100
 recently they were impossible to imagine 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.500
 the stem cells have returned the 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.990
 knees to rafael nadal has written the 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.910
 world press rafa spent long years of 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:59.590
 Stress and tendinitis stress fracture 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.300
 in the end the pains were made 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.310
 unbearable and he was forced to leave 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.260
 courts for long and endless months 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:08.050
 until now that you chose the cells 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.820
 mother and it's the first time I do not feel 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.070
 knee pain after two 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:15.280
 years he confessed to espanyol already back 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:18.340
 in glory majesty to the courts I 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.620
 I always assimilate here gave away some 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.780
 cells capable of going to recognize that in 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.670
 so sick places are cells so 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.470
 smart you can say here is 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.259
 the alarm that is the inflammatory focus 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.790
 I'm going to work here and turn off the 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:32.560
 fire in the first instance as 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.930
 an anti-inflammatory effect and after 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.430
 comes in the reconstruction stage the 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.020
 stem cells can be obtained from 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.479
 umbilical cord of the fat of the 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.220
 teeth and bone marrow for example and 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:44.380
 since they work like the best 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.390
 working to rebuild tissues 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.900
 can use to recover injuries 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:52.620
 and also for rejuvenation 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:57.210
 aesthetic cosmetic aesthetic alopecia 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:59.550
 facial acne scars we can also 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.090
 have an erectile dysfunction that are 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:07.200
 local and systemic treatments milos 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:09.090
 autism diabetes with parkinson from the 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.550
 most common degenerative diseases 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.260
 that we have mentioned until 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.820
 now surely you thought that the 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.040
 his body fat only brought him 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:19.290
 problems or it turns out that from the tissue 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.690
 adipose can be extracted stem cells 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.050
 and it is precisely what increasingly 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.340
 people use to rejuvenate their face 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:29.820
 are all areas that we are going to 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:32.700
 leave to reposition in with the fillings 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.530
 Facials with fat in mothers what 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.080
 The neck itself begins to 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.380
 mark much more has some signs of 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.290
 any 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:44.340
 and we will try to liberate and produce 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.110
 a cervical rejuvenation 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.599
 in the day of aging not 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:52.140
 it only consists of wrinkles but 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:54.569
 fundamentally in flac if it falls out 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.010
 the face because we lose volumes 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:58.709
 So what we do with the 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:01.170
 recognition procedures is 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:04.620
 recover volumes in the moral area 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:07.410
 malar already and as the doctor said 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.840
 Nasogenian sulcus above 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.390
 decided to undergo a liposuction of 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.590
 his abdomen received local anesthesia and 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.660
 out of a few minutes the doctors 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.390
 they extracted the amount of fat 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.950
 and required them to the uncomfortable roll 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.329
 centrifuges in a process that 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.130
 allows to separate the different 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:24.870
 blood components blood cells 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.760
 red blood cells and white blood cells 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.950
 platelets and have the factors of 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.110
 growth once the 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.549
 We are going to show you how to centrifuge 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.340
 the separation of the 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:36.840
 different components of the blood this 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.660
 procedure as they are realizing 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.400
 it's all from the patient nothing external so 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:45.510
 so there is no risk to and this 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:47.120
 is fat we have 50 ml of grease in 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.530
 this case that is what we are going to process 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.340
 We are going to process this fat now 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.340
 to get them 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:56.430
 stem cells meanwhile lorena 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.349
 wait without feeling any pain inside 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.550
 of this lithium are our cells 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:04.110
 mother if you see there what you see 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:08.300
 because stem cells tend to 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.300
 gluten ar we put it together 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:13.250
 and from this preparation that after a few 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:16.610
 moments will be what we are going to 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:18.170
 inject patients into the patient 

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:20.180
 they receive anesthesia on their face and when 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:22.250
 the effect begins to be noticed starts 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:24.530
 the application of formula one has 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.570
 stuffed these sectors with grease 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.790
 enriched with stem cells is 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:31.370
 recover those volumes and that makes 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:33.140
 the face looks more jovial 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.390
 tersa for example stimulate the 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:37.220
 production of fibroblast collagen and 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:39.440
 that makes even the 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:43.340
 spots of fact the applications of 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:45.980
 stem cells are just as we are 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:48.080
 we notice in spots but also in 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:49.880
 soleá cesc for example put a lot 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:52.520
 attention this is the process that lived 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:56.120
 lorena in only four days this was her 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:58.010
 at 52 years old the following days was 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.590
 with some slight bruises on his face 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:03.230
 that began to attenuate quickly 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:07.520
 on the fourth day he noticed that he had retreated 

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:10.520
 several years the change is evident but 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:13.280
 three weeks later the urine is another 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:17.509
 I always had faith in the cells 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:19.879
 mothers who could recover and who wanted to 

00:05:17.509 --> 00:05:21.470
 trying again was like it was before 

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:24.200
 grab 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:26.680
 I liked when I was younger 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.680
 I liked 

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:32.650
 but I put on clothes and javier and 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:34.780
 generally women are makeup and 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:37.300
 all of me, I did not like being natural 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:39.160
 and now I can endure again until 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.080
 the tissues of the heart after a 

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:43.060
 heart attack doctors say rivers and 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:44.740
 whites can be recovered with the 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:46.630
 stem cells and the truth is not 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:48.280
 has a contraindication the cells 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:50.410
 mother because we are talking cells 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:52.410
 that are our own from our 

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:54.100
 body therefore we are not 

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:56.080
 incorporating an external thing 

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:58.300
 unknown to your body not 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:00.520
 we run the risk of transmitting a 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:02.370
 infection that therefore the truth 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:06.040
 is that anyone who wants 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:07.870
 recover a tissue for example or that 

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:09.760
 want to look younger can be done 

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:12.740
 application of stem cells that return 

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:17.129
 like two or three days in 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:19.379
 unhappy bloated is so quick are 

00:06:17.129 --> 00:06:23.250
 as three hours of interventions would be 

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:25.729
 everything and then left the life for by 

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:25.729
 live it 

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:31.580
 let's go now the outside the separation 

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:33.919
 between private and public life is 

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:36.370
 being questioned in france where the 

00:06:33.919 --> 00:06:36.370
 supposed
