00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
this is not a live stream event so I

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.460 
this is not a live stream event so I
will<00:02:17.819> be<00:02:17.849> recording<00:02:18.120> it<00:02:18.510> when<00:02:18.659> my<00:02:18.750> PVR<00:02:19.110> and

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
uploading it later okay so this is not a

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:25.940 
uploading it later okay so this is not a
live<00:02:23.340> stream<00:02:23.549> event<00:02:23.720> so<00:02:24.720> it's<00:02:25.560> not<00:02:25.709> going<00:02:25.860> to

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
live stream event so it's not going to
