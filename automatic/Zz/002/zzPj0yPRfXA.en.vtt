00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.600 
well to look at this bike has been
around<00:00:29.550> since<00:00:29.850> 2005<00:00:30.830> the<00:00:31.830> original<00:00:32.279> Star<00:00:32.850> City

it's<00:00:35.610> more<00:00:36.030> or<00:00:36.150> less<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.480> same<00:00:36.690> to<00:00:37.380> look<00:00:37.590> at

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
it's more or less the same to look at

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.830 
it's more or less the same to look at
but<00:00:38.070> there's<00:00:38.280> a<00:00:38.340> lot<00:00:38.489> of<00:00:38.520> small<00:00:38.940> small<00:00:39.120> finer

good<00:01:05.339> switchgear<00:01:06.800> earlier<00:01:07.800> there<00:01:08.040> was<00:01:08.190> a

00:01:08.389 --> 00:01:08.399 
good switchgear earlier there was a

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:10.550 
good switchgear earlier there was a
little<00:01:08.700> bit<00:01:08.910> of<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:09.390> know<00:01:09.420> looks<00:01:09.780> one<00:01:10.080> so<00:01:10.350> good

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
little bit of you know looks one so good

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.320 
little bit of you know looks one so good
around<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.950> steering<00:01:11.280> clamp<00:01:11.670> but<00:01:11.880> that's<00:01:12.119> all

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
around the steering clamp but that's all

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.680 
around the steering clamp but that's all
taken<00:01:12.509> care<00:01:12.720> of

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:14.690 
taken care of

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:20.889 
taken care of
the<00:01:15.690> engine<00:01:16.140> basically<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.820> 110<00:01:18.509> CC<00:01:18.750> motor

00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:20.899 
the engine basically a a 110 CC motor

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:25.969 
the engine basically a a 110 CC motor
makes<00:01:21.899> about<00:01:22.259> 8<00:01:22.740> bhp<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:24.289> the<00:01:25.289> bike<00:01:25.500> is<00:01:25.530> is

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
makes about 8 bhp and the bike is is

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.779 
makes about 8 bhp and the bike is is
it's<00:01:26.550> not<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:27.210> fastest<00:01:27.720> in<00:01:27.869> segments<00:01:28.789> but

00:01:29.779 --> 00:01:29.789 
it's not the fastest in segments but

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:32.240 
it's not the fastest in segments but
it's<00:01:29.970> very<00:01:30.119> smooth<00:01:30.540> now<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:31.110> they've<00:01:32.010> done<00:01:32.220> a

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
it's very smooth now and they've done a

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.969 
it's very smooth now and they've done a
lot<00:01:32.340> of<00:01:32.490> work<00:01:32.790> to<00:01:33.090> optimize<00:01:33.979> induction

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
lot of work to optimize induction

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.870 
lot of work to optimize induction
optimize<00:01:35.580> the<00:01:35.970> exhaust<00:01:36.420> system<00:01:37.430> it<00:01:38.430> all<00:01:38.580> comes

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
optimize the exhaust system it all comes

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.859 
optimize the exhaust system it all comes
together<00:01:39.060> well<00:01:39.510> the<00:01:39.720> bike<00:01:39.869> runs<00:01:40.409> smoothly<00:01:40.799> and

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
together well the bike runs smoothly and

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:44.539 
together well the bike runs smoothly and
that's<00:01:42.869> what<00:01:43.140> you<00:01:43.619> know<00:01:43.770> a<00:01:43.920> commuter<00:01:44.430> is

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
that's what you know a commuter is

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:51.289 
that's what you know a commuter is
looking<00:01:44.909> for<00:01:47.869> the<00:01:48.869> star<00:01:49.460> spots<00:01:50.460> which<00:01:50.880> was<00:01:51.090> an

looking for the star spots which was an

looking for the star spots which was an
earlier<00:01:51.689> variant<00:01:52.140> of<00:01:52.320> this<00:01:52.500> game<00:01:52.799> with<00:01:53.010> a

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
earlier variant of this game with a

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.179 
earlier variant of this game with a

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
industry norm in this segment but

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:01.940 
industry norm in this segment but
they've<00:02:00.540> sorted<00:02:00.869> that<00:02:01.049> out<00:02:01.110> here<00:02:01.470> it's<00:02:01.710> got<00:02:01.920> a

segment<00:02:18.540> I<00:02:18.750> mean<00:02:19.380> it's<00:02:19.890> not<00:02:20.100> a<00:02:20.160> bike<00:02:20.910> for<00:02:21.120> the

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
segment I mean it's not a bike for the

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.910 
segment I mean it's not a bike for the
racetrack<00:02:21.690> but<00:02:21.720> it's<00:02:22.049> it's<00:02:22.440> still<00:02:22.680> pretty

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
racetrack but it's it's still pretty

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.400 
racetrack but it's it's still pretty
good<00:02:23.280> enough<00:02:23.549> for<00:02:23.790> your<00:02:24.269> everyday<00:02:24.870> traffic

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
good enough for your everyday traffic
