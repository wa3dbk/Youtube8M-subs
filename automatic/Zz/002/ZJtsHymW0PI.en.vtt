it<00:00:25.019> had<00:00:25.859> made<00:00:26.130> it<00:00:26.279> to<00:00:26.460> fit<00:00:26.759> the<00:00:26.970> hpi<00:00:27.480> baja

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
it had made it to fit the hpi baja

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:33.050 
it had made it to fit the hpi baja
shocks<00:00:28.320> and<00:00:28.740> it's<00:00:29.400> a<00:00:29.579> nice<00:00:30.380> heavy-duty<00:00:32.060> stand

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:33.060 
shocks and it's a nice heavy-duty stand

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.330 
shocks and it's a nice heavy-duty stand
made<00:00:33.480> out<00:00:33.630> of<00:00:33.750> 12<00:00:34.170> gauge<00:00:34.500> cold<00:00:34.980> rolled<00:00:35.220> steel

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
made out of 12 gauge cold rolled steel

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.420 
made out of 12 gauge cold rolled steel
that's<00:00:35.760> been<00:00:35.850> powder-coated<00:00:36.660> it<00:00:36.990> is<00:00:37.440> a<00:00:37.950> very

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
that's been powder-coated it is a very

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.670 
that's been powder-coated it is a very
sturdy<00:00:38.940> stand<00:00:39.630> so<00:00:39.990> that<00:00:40.020> it<00:00:40.260> doesn't<00:00:40.440> get

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
sturdy stand so that it doesn't get

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:41.840 
sturdy stand so that it doesn't get
knocked<00:00:40.890> over<00:00:41.070> while<00:00:41.400> you're<00:00:41.520> trying<00:00:41.730> to

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
knocked over while you're trying to

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.990 
knocked over while you're trying to
build<00:00:42.090> your<00:00:42.240> shocks<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:43.370> it<00:00:44.370> is<00:00:44.580> powder

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
build your shocks and it is powder

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.360 
build your shocks and it is powder
coated<00:00:45.150> too<00:00:45.690> so<00:00:45.900> that's<00:00:46.140> very<00:00:46.200> easy<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:46.860> wipe

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
coated too so that's very easy to wipe

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.030 
coated too so that's very easy to wipe
off<00:00:47.640> any<00:00:47.910> any<00:00:48.270> creases<00:00:48.750> or<00:00:48.840> oils<00:00:49.260> that<00:00:49.380> you<00:00:49.890> do

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:50.040 
off any any creases or oils that you do

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:55.130 
off any any creases or oils that you do
get<00:00:50.250> on<00:00:50.430> it<00:00:51.050> so<00:00:52.050> we<00:00:53.390> started<00:00:54.390> making<00:00:54.540> the<00:00:54.840> stand

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
get on it so we started making the stand

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.450 
get on it so we started making the stand
and<00:00:55.880> again<00:00:56.880> it<00:00:57.120> was<00:00:57.270> for<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.690> hpi<00:00:58.080> baja<00:00:58.460> shocks

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
and again it was for the hpi baja shocks

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.420 
and again it was for the hpi baja shocks
and<00:00:59.850> at<00:01:00.360> that<00:01:00.480> point<00:01:00.780> we<00:01:01.140> realized<00:01:01.560> that<00:01:01.980> most

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
and at that point we realized that most

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.450 
and at that point we realized that most
people<00:01:03.060> that<00:01:03.810> have<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.290> Baja<00:01:04.650> also<00:01:05.129> have

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
people that have the Baja also have

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.319 
people that have the Baja also have
other<00:01:06.380> are<00:01:07.380> seeds<00:01:07.799> that<00:01:08.040> they<00:01:08.189> work<00:01:08.400> on<00:01:08.640> so

00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:09.329 
other are seeds that they work on so

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:12.859 
other are seeds that they work on so
what<00:01:09.539> we<00:01:09.659> did<00:01:09.899> was<00:01:10.640> we<00:01:11.640> took<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:12.149> top<00:01:12.479> of<00:01:12.719> the

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
what we did was we took the top of the

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.639 
what we did was we took the top of the
stand<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.560> we<00:01:14.310> also<00:01:14.520> made<00:01:14.909> two<00:01:15.649> additional

00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:16.649 
stand and we also made two additional

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:19.639 
stand and we also made two additional
sized<00:01:17.009> holes<00:01:17.609> that<00:01:18.600> will<00:01:18.780> accommodate<00:01:19.140> I'm

00:01:19.639 --> 00:01:19.649 
sized holes that will accommodate I'm

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:22.249 
sized holes that will accommodate I'm
sure<00:01:19.890> probably<00:01:20.509> ninety<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:21.780> ninety<00:01:22.079> nine

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
sure probably ninety to ninety nine

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.109 
sure probably ninety to ninety nine
percent<00:01:22.499> of<00:01:22.950> all<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.280> shocks<00:01:23.549> that<00:01:23.759> are<00:01:23.969> on

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
percent of all the shocks that are on

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.989 
percent of all the shocks that are on
the<00:01:24.270> market<00:01:24.799> we<00:01:25.799> play<00:01:26.310> around<00:01:26.579> with<00:01:26.819> some

00:01:26.989 --> 00:01:26.999 
the market we play around with some

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:29.209 
the market we play around with some
buggies<00:01:27.359> here<00:01:27.990> at<00:01:28.079> the<00:01:28.200> shop<00:01:28.350> so<00:01:28.770> we<00:01:29.009> have<00:01:29.189> a

00:01:29.209 --> 00:01:29.219 
buggies here at the shop so we have a

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:31.550 
buggies here at the shop so we have a
buggy<00:01:29.520> shock<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.090> fits<00:01:30.329> right<00:01:30.509> in<00:01:30.719> there<00:01:30.929> they

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
buggy shock the fits right in there they

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.889 
buggy shock the fits right in there they
fit<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:31.979> shocks<00:01:32.249> for<00:01:32.490> our<00:01:32.700> revo<00:01:33.119> it<00:01:33.420> fits<00:01:33.719> the

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:33.899 
fit the shocks for our revo it fits the

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:38.929 
fit the shocks for our revo it fits the
shock<00:01:34.170> for<00:01:34.649> our<00:01:35.840> slashes<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:37.259> and<00:01:37.979> all<00:01:38.579> of<00:01:38.759> our

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
shock for our slashes and and all of our

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.289 
shock for our slashes and and all of our
other<00:01:39.179> trucks<00:01:39.899> that<00:01:40.079> we<00:01:40.229> have<00:01:40.409> and<00:01:40.880> then<00:01:41.880> we

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
other trucks that we have and then we

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.480 
other trucks that we have and then we
have<00:01:42.450> also<00:01:42.689> designed<00:01:43.319> we<00:01:43.560> have<00:01:43.770> an<00:01:44.219> race

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
have also designed we have an race

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.840 
have also designed we have an race
touring<00:01:45.149> cars<00:01:45.420> so<00:01:46.139> we<00:01:46.170> also<00:01:46.439> created<00:01:47.189> an<00:01:47.490> area

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
touring cars so we also created an area

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.449 
touring cars so we also created an area
here<00:01:48.179> that<00:01:48.780> will<00:01:48.929> fit<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.409> touring<00:01:50.249> car

00:01:50.449 --> 00:01:50.459 
here that will fit the touring car

00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:53.090 
here that will fit the touring car
shocks<00:01:50.819> because<00:01:51.630> we<00:01:51.810> tend<00:01:52.049> to<00:01:52.170> rebuild<00:01:52.619> all<00:01:52.859> of

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
shocks because we tend to rebuild all of

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.749 
shocks because we tend to rebuild all of
our<00:01:53.219> shocks<00:01:53.459> fairly<00:01:54.090> often<00:01:55.159> so<00:01:56.159> not<00:01:56.429> only<00:01:56.459> is

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
our shocks fairly often so not only is

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.059 
our shocks fairly often so not only is
it<00:01:56.969> a<00:01:57.179> stand<00:01:57.479> for<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.959> Baja<00:01:58.350> but<00:01:58.770> it<00:01:58.920> is<00:01:59.039> a

00:01:59.059 --> 00:01:59.069 
it a stand for the Baja but it is a

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:01.609 
it a stand for the Baja but it is a
universal<00:01:59.549> stand<00:02:00.329> for<00:02:00.719> almost<00:02:00.990> all<00:02:01.200> shocks

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
universal stand for almost all shocks

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.059 
universal stand for almost all shocks
that<00:02:01.799> are<00:02:02.069> out<00:02:02.429> on<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.819> market<00:02:03.560> the<00:02:04.560> shocks

00:02:05.059 --> 00:02:05.069 
that are out on the market the shocks

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:09.020 
that are out on the market the shocks
for<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.880> Baja<00:02:06.630> all<00:02:07.250> four<00:02:08.250> of<00:02:08.280> them<00:02:08.459> can<00:02:08.700> fit<00:02:08.910> in

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
for the Baja all four of them can fit in

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.790 
for the Baja all four of them can fit in
at<00:02:09.149> one<00:02:09.330> time<00:02:09.539> you<00:02:09.869> can<00:02:10.050> fit<00:02:10.229> them<00:02:10.289> in<00:02:10.440> upright

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
at one time you can fit them in upright

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.770 
at one time you can fit them in upright
like<00:02:11.069> this<00:02:11.340> if<00:02:11.610> you<00:02:11.910> want<00:02:12.090> to<00:02:12.180> work<00:02:12.300> on<00:02:12.450> the<00:02:12.569> top

like this if you want to work on the top

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.610 
like this if you want to work on the top
of<00:02:12.959> the<00:02:13.049> shocks<00:02:13.290> or<00:02:14.250> if<00:02:14.670> you're<00:02:15.299> going<00:02:15.480> to

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
of the shocks or if you're going to

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.809 
of the shocks or if you're going to
refill<00:02:16.620> the<00:02:16.739> shocks

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
refill the shocks

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.619 
refill the shocks
and<00:02:18.680> rebuild<00:02:19.680> them<00:02:19.890> they<00:02:20.760> will<00:02:20.879> also<00:02:21.090> fit<00:02:21.480> in

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:21.629 
and rebuild them they will also fit in

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:23.599 
and rebuild them they will also fit in
upside<00:02:22.200> down<00:02:22.409> so<00:02:22.889> that<00:02:22.920> you<00:02:23.159> can<00:02:23.280> put<00:02:23.459> your

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:23.609 
upside down so that you can put your

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:26.149 
upside down so that you can put your
fluid<00:02:24.030> in<00:02:24.150> it<00:02:24.389> just<00:02:25.139> so<00:02:25.290> happens<00:02:25.709> that<00:02:25.799> we<00:02:26.040> are

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:26.159 
fluid in it just so happens that we are

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:28.339 
fluid in it just so happens that we are
getting<00:02:26.430> ready<00:02:26.730> to<00:02:26.849> rebuild<00:02:27.299> some<00:02:27.599> shocks<00:02:27.870> so

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
getting ready to rebuild some shocks so

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:30.619 
getting ready to rebuild some shocks so
let's<00:02:29.219> go<00:02:29.370> ahead<00:02:29.489> and<00:02:29.670> show<00:02:29.999> you<00:02:30.030> a<00:02:30.180> couple<00:02:30.420> of

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:30.629 
let's go ahead and show you a couple of

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:32.899 
let's go ahead and show you a couple of
the<00:02:30.780> other<00:02:30.930> built-in<00:02:31.530> functions<00:02:32.219> and<00:02:32.489> things

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:32.909 
the other built-in functions and things

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:34.280 
the other built-in functions and things
that<00:02:33.060> we<00:02:33.150> thought<00:02:33.329> about<00:02:33.480> as<00:02:33.870> we<00:02:34.200> were

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
that we thought about as we were

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.860 
that we thought about as we were
building<00:02:34.469> the<00:02:34.799> stand<00:02:35.129> one<00:02:35.879> of<00:02:36.030> them<00:02:36.180> is<00:02:36.209> that

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
building the stand one of them is that

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.129 
building the stand one of them is that
we<00:02:37.170> tend<00:02:38.099> to<00:02:38.280> always<00:02:38.489> want<00:02:39.329> to<00:02:39.480> do<00:02:39.689> something

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:40.139 
we tend to always want to do something

00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:41.929 
we tend to always want to do something
you<00:02:40.680> know<00:02:40.769> through<00:02:41.010> the<00:02:41.099> front<00:02:41.310> of<00:02:41.489> the<00:02:41.639> stand

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:41.939 
you know through the front of the stand

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:44.030 
you know through the front of the stand
so<00:02:42.120> we<00:02:42.150> did<00:02:42.389> create<00:02:42.659> our<00:02:42.810> nice<00:02:43.019> wide<00:02:43.560> opening

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
so we did create our nice wide opening

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.869 
so we did create our nice wide opening
in<00:02:44.549> the<00:02:45.120> front<00:02:45.269> so<00:02:46.230> that<00:02:46.260> you<00:02:46.620> can<00:02:46.799> have<00:02:46.879> access

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:47.879 
in the front so that you can have access

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:50.449 
in the front so that you can have access
to<00:02:48.239> the<00:02:48.389> stand<00:02:48.659> firm<00:02:49.019> from<00:02:49.469> any<00:02:49.620> direction<00:02:49.919> to

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
to the stand firm from any direction to

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.069 
to the stand firm from any direction to
work<00:02:51.209> on<00:02:51.419> your<00:02:51.569> shocks<00:02:52.280> it<00:02:53.280> is<00:02:53.459> quite<00:02:53.730> stable

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:54.079 
work on your shocks it is quite stable

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:57.949 
work on your shocks it is quite stable
very<00:02:55.079> very<00:02:55.349> large<00:02:55.650> base<00:02:56.459> so<00:02:57.419> that<00:02:57.449> you're<00:02:57.780> not

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
very very large base so that you're not

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.770 
very very large base so that you're not
going<00:02:58.230> to<00:02:58.319> go<00:02:58.439> tipping<00:02:58.829> it<00:02:58.949> over<00:02:59.329> by<00:03:00.329> knocking

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
going to go tipping it over by knocking

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.050 
going to go tipping it over by knocking
on<00:03:00.930> it<00:03:01.079> and<00:03:01.319> when<00:03:01.829> all<00:03:01.980> four<00:03:02.310> shocks<00:03:02.699> are<00:03:02.969> in

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
on it and when all four shocks are in

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.209 
on it and when all four shocks are in
the<00:03:03.150> upright<00:03:03.419> position<00:03:03.560> it<00:03:04.560> still<00:03:04.829> has<00:03:05.040> plenty

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:05.219 
the upright position it still has plenty

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:07.069 
the upright position it still has plenty
of<00:03:05.430> stability<00:03:05.849> without<00:03:06.180> worrying<00:03:06.959> about

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.079 
of stability without worrying about

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:12.559 
of stability without worrying about
being<00:03:07.230> knocked<00:03:07.709> over<00:03:07.980> one<00:03:10.549> of<00:03:11.549> the<00:03:11.790> dilemmas

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
being knocked over one of the dilemmas

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:15.379 
being knocked over one of the dilemmas
that<00:03:12.930> that<00:03:13.469> we<00:03:13.650> tend<00:03:13.949> to<00:03:14.129> run<00:03:14.340> into<00:03:14.730> as<00:03:15.030> we're

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:15.389 
that that we tend to run into as we're

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:18.439 
that that we tend to run into as we're
rebuilding<00:03:15.989> shocks<00:03:16.500> is<00:03:17.150> somewhere<00:03:18.150> to<00:03:18.269> dump

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:18.449 
rebuilding shocks is somewhere to dump

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:21.229 
rebuilding shocks is somewhere to dump
the<00:03:18.689> fluid<00:03:19.199> and<00:03:19.469> let<00:03:20.340> them<00:03:20.519> sit<00:03:20.819> while<00:03:21.030> they're

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
the fluid and let them sit while they're

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:26.599 
the fluid and let them sit while they're
draining<00:03:23.389> so<00:03:24.389> what<00:03:24.720> we've<00:03:24.870> done<00:03:24.900> is<00:03:25.280> the<00:03:26.280> stand

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:26.609 
draining so what we've done is the stand

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:29.509 
draining so what we've done is the stand
we<00:03:27.540> increase<00:03:27.930> the<00:03:28.169> height<00:03:28.349> over<00:03:28.829> our<00:03:28.979> original

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
we increase the height over our original

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:32.059 
we increase the height over our original
design<00:03:29.879> so<00:03:30.540> that<00:03:30.569> you<00:03:30.840> can<00:03:31.019> put<00:03:31.259> a<00:03:31.439> Tupperware

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:32.069 
design so that you can put a Tupperware

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:35.479 
design so that you can put a Tupperware
container<00:03:32.099> or<00:03:33.000> cut<00:03:33.269> off<00:03:33.449> a<00:03:33.689> soda<00:03:34.379> bottle<00:03:34.500> or

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
container or cut off a soda bottle or

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:37.249 
container or cut off a soda bottle or
put<00:03:35.729> some<00:03:35.939> sort<00:03:36.180> of<00:03:36.269> a<00:03:36.359> container<00:03:36.720> underneath

00:03:37.249 --> 00:03:37.259 
put some sort of a container underneath

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:40.640 
put some sort of a container underneath
it<00:03:37.650> so<00:03:38.459> that<00:03:38.759> when<00:03:39.599> you<00:03:39.720> open<00:03:40.079> up<00:03:40.169> your<00:03:40.319> shocks

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
it so that when you open up your shocks

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:46.939 
it so that when you open up your shocks
to<00:03:40.919> drain<00:03:41.310> them<00:03:45.409> you<00:03:46.409> have<00:03:46.560> somewhere<00:03:46.889> for

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:46.949 
to drain them you have somewhere for

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:50.659 
to drain them you have somewhere for
that<00:03:47.250> shop<00:03:47.519> fluid<00:03:48.079> to<00:03:49.079> drip<00:03:49.319> out<00:03:49.500> and<00:03:50.400> we've

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:50.669 
that shop fluid to drip out and we've

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:53.629 
that shop fluid to drip out and we've
designed<00:03:50.909> it<00:03:51.329> so<00:03:51.569> that<00:03:51.599> you<00:03:52.470> can<00:03:52.620> do<00:03:52.709> all<00:03:52.739> four

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:53.639 
designed it so that you can do all four

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:57.409 
designed it so that you can do all four
of<00:03:53.669> your<00:03:53.939> shocks<00:03:54.620> at<00:03:55.620> one<00:03:55.949> time<00:03:56.220> so<00:03:56.609> we're

00:03:57.409 --> 00:03:57.419 
of your shocks at one time so we're

00:03:57.419 --> 00:03:59.809 
of your shocks at one time so we're
going<00:03:57.509> to<00:03:57.599> go<00:03:57.750> ahead<00:03:57.870> and<00:03:58.459> let<00:03:59.459> our<00:03:59.579> shock

00:03:59.809 --> 00:03:59.819 
going to go ahead and let our shock

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:02.349 
going to go ahead and let our shock
strain<00:04:00.209> out<00:04:00.419> here<00:04:00.769> we're<00:04:01.769> in<00:04:01.859> the<00:04:01.949> middle<00:04:02.129> of

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:02.359 
strain out here we're in the middle of

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:09.469 
strain out here we're in the middle of
of<00:04:03.359> doing<00:04:03.689> a<00:04:03.780> rebuilt<00:04:06.259> once<00:04:07.259> the<00:04:08.090> shocks<00:04:09.090> are

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:09.479 
of doing a rebuilt once the shocks are

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:13.039 
of doing a rebuilt once the shocks are
drained<00:04:09.870> out<00:04:10.139> and<00:04:10.879> you<00:04:11.879> go<00:04:12.090> to<00:04:12.150> refill<00:04:12.780> them

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049 
drained out and you go to refill them

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:17.120 
drained out and you go to refill them
again<00:04:14.689> we've<00:04:15.689> created<00:04:16.019> the<00:04:16.380> stand<00:04:16.680> so<00:04:17.099> that

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
again we've created the stand so that

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:22.189 
again we've created the stand so that
very<00:04:17.880> simply<00:04:18.209> you<00:04:19.190> can<00:04:20.190> turn<00:04:20.549> the<00:04:21.509> shock<00:04:21.780> over

00:04:22.189 --> 00:04:22.199 
very simply you can turn the shock over

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:24.170 
very simply you can turn the shock over
at<00:04:22.320> this<00:04:22.500> point<00:04:22.830> and<00:04:23.340> go<00:04:23.520> ahead<00:04:23.639> and<00:04:23.759> fill<00:04:24.030> it

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
at this point and go ahead and fill it

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.110 
at this point and go ahead and fill it
from<00:04:24.360> the<00:04:24.449> top<00:04:24.659> and<00:04:25.729> rebuild<00:04:26.729> the<00:04:26.880> shop

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
from the top and rebuild the shop

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.760 
from the top and rebuild the shop
without<00:04:27.719> having<00:04:28.199> to<00:04:28.289> leave<00:04:28.440> the<00:04:28.620> stand<00:04:28.889> and

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
without having to leave the stand and
