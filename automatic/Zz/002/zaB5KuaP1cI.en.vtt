that's<00:04:36.259> what<00:04:36.650> I<00:04:36.680> thought<00:04:36.979> when<00:04:37.729> it<00:04:37.849> happened

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.300 
that's what I thought when it happened

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.050 
that's what I thought when it happened
but<00:04:38.509> now<00:04:39.229> I<00:04:39.259> see<00:04:39.770> this<00:04:39.949> war<00:04:40.220> has<00:04:40.460> been<00:04:40.639> going<00:04:40.699> on

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060

for years we just haven't noticed it

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:45.610 
for years we just haven't noticed it
because<00:04:44.090> our<00:04:44.479> way<00:04:44.720> of<00:04:44.870> doing<00:04:45.169> things<00:04:45.349> is

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 
because our way of doing things is

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.749 
because our way of doing things is
broken<00:04:46.630> pretty<00:04:47.630> much<00:04:47.840> need<00:04:48.229> to<00:04:48.259> do<00:04:48.620> things<00:04:48.949> the
