 as a rule, they also answer all 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.580
 requirements over the process I would not 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.690
 wanted to spend more than two nights there 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.590

 nice kind of overnight thought glory 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.110
 this is a manifestation of a compact

 but ilchevsky roots 

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:23.339
 in 1970 the architect Kisho kurokawa 

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:26.259
 completed work on the tower at Kondinsky 

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:28.979
 ginza area 

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:30.889
 He despite past years this 

00:02:30.889 --> 00:02:32.189
 unique building still seems 

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:33.929
 mysterious alien from 

00:02:33.929 --> 00:02:35.919
 of the future 

00:02:35.919 --> 00:02:38.729
 milk is my first to absolute edition 

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:40.509
 I designed a lot of similar 

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:42.629
 houses 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:45.629
 at this time 

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:49.829
 in each of these one hundred and forty dwelling cells 

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:52.049
 was manufactured at the factory 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:54.870
 raised to its place with the help of a crane and 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.049
 attached to a central steel 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:02:58.739
 based on 4 me high strength 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:02:59.879
 chatted 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:01.540
 by Wednesday the life of the buildings in 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.930
 Tokyo is 25 years old but kurokawa 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.319
 created buildings in which capsules can 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:07.759
 delete replace 

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:10.889
 and reattaches to the steel frame 

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:12.519
 in essence this is architectural 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:15.669
 disposal methods 

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:18.049
 300-avalanche kurokawa capsule per 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:20.289
 two meters too small to be considered 

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:21.379
 ordinary housing 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:23.249
 they are intended for short term 

00:03:23.249 --> 00:03:24.719
 stay 

00:03:24.719 --> 00:03:26.589
 concept on 

00:03:26.589 --> 00:03:28.509
 besides the house you can equip here 

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:30.999
 studios or company can purchase three 

00:03:30.999 --> 00:03:32.719
 four capsules for guests 

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:35.789
 Kiev vena cava 

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:37.739
 she is visible 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:40.739
 in time to become full 

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:44.099
 but the inhabitants of the suburbs capsules allow 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:45.940
 take a break from everyday work 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.270
 Andrei average suburban residents 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:51.570
 lawyers road three hours thereby losing 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:54.570
 precious time 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:56.779
 architectural sample 

00:03:56.779 --> 00:03:58.469
 equipped used from 

00:03:58.469 --> 00:04:00.339
 who is not yet rooted 

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:02.759
 therefore this unique tower inspired on 

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:04.859
 creation of many capsule hotels 

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:06.930
 remains an irresistible structure 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.930
 ahead of time 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:22.960
 town planners are constantly changing 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.780
 street and sidewalk layout 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.449
