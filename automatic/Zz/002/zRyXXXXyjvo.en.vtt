00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:04.770
 Welcome to the dab timeout 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.359
 right after the match against russia 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.010
 here from the mixed zone and here 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.780
 is a very satisfied uwe 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.969
 gensheimer first tells us how 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.570
 much kilogram heavy the stone of 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:18.359
 hearts fell is extremely intense 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.740
 play many time penalties many 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.199
 situations that also discuss it 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.480
 gave wachenfeld and then at the end 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.880
 a gain in the last action 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.189
 I think we saw how we in the circle 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.179
 hopped in anticipation and that's it 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.130
 from warstein 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.510
 It was great in the second 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.500
 Halftime what has the coach Dagur 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.059
 sigurdsson in the half-time break 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.700
 threatened if she again today 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.200
 threatened he is saying I say 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.910
 pretty quiet but we have 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.530
 ourselves or we were ourselves 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.120
 Unhappy content because we do not 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.320
 what we have brought to the plate 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.670
 have us and what we have 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.070
 What we can do in the second half 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.719
 but have shown good German 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.070
 said that it does not matter what in the 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.989
 first half was but make 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.000
 continue our thing and try tor for 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.230
 The light will arrive faster then 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.760
 than expected is believed after five or 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.620
 six minutes we could already 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.870
 compensate again in the second 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.000
 half-time that was in the end also 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.460
 very important and a key that we 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.750
 so fast the advance of the Russians 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.760
 could equalize then itself also 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.049
 could pull away again goes away hand 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.310
 on the heart and very honestly there is 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.090
 a celebration goes to the reward today 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.530
 I think it's too expensive 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.759
 Thank you very much uwe gensheimer and we will listen 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.330
 let's see what his teammates are 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.650
 We say about this victory against Russia 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.750
 we can be very happy with 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.270
 Victory Two victories in a row 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.729
 It is also a cut you first 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.670
 Let's show some character 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:40.200
 started poorly were three 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:43.880
 rear 3 rear 44 and then also 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.750
 managed to be 34 goals ahead 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:49.950
 Nevertheless, this has become a to 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.680
 statements and and but we were now the 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.910
 a gate better 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.860
 There are many things we still have 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.120
 I also believe the things improve 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.920
 that went well there you can still 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.760
 but some improve in that 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.810
 about number game 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:04.060
 there we were divided to hectic 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.650
 then at some point then so 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.810
 simple dice taken without us 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:12.110
 I was really free to think there 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.610
 a little bit more patience around him 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.750
 just then the clear opportunities better 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.010
 to play in the second 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.750
 half a time better 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.550
 Everyone is playing such a great game 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.740
 players also experienced again white 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.390
 you can also play in such 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.010
 exist and yes we know that one 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.180
 fast group was thus very important 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.530
 now have four points on our page 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.420
 and now it goes on in two days 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.080
 of course, they'll get big ones one by one 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.550
 hearts are falling 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.390
 Overjoyed, I also saw that 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.750
 I hopped around and 214 points perfect 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.440
 begin 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.220
 and now not with a broad chest 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.930
 but nice 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.930
 he was with the big points 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.989
 man man man, ey, what a lot 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.640
 I am still completely euphoric 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:51.170
 and the boys after two starts 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.849
 Of course, too proud of yourself 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.930
 powered by german fans and 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:56.020
 they are right after hall today 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.950
 freaked 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:00.880
 full of anticipation 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:05.330
 I'm really excited 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:08.660
 highly motivated optimistic course the 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.200
 victory almost euphoric so semi-final 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.670
 definitely 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:15.830
 it's just another saying that 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.239
 german fans at the wm um die 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.250
 to cheer team together 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:22.280
 the trailers gathered on board 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:24.709
 entrance of the arena is welcomed and 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.200
 sworn in by dhb president bÃ¶rner 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:29.890
 Duration is just important if you like that 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.890
 a lot of black-red-gold 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:38.250
 meet with it too is device and then 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:45.140
 purely in the hall 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:45.140
 Cheer on the team cheering 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:48.530
 with trembling 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.770
 of euphoria with the German fans and 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:57.300
 also Stefan Kretschmer in the stands 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:58.590
 next to me has been trembling properly today 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.660
 This game I almost flipped out 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.890
 I must say on the tribune the first 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.600
 At half past time I was getting used to it 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.340
 that was difficult for us spoiled 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.980
 window the first game very clearly 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.810
 but then he won three times 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.520
 Great and then it went too 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.440
 So again with the euphoria ahead 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.700
 just as you departed for it 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.220
 stage I already thought about it briefly 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.620
 sit down in front of another 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:21.720
 Actually , in the end, that was actually the 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:24.000
 reason the game was shot 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.590
 I'm still looking forward to that 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.870
 I am now ever been asked 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.100
 I do not know the answer but you are 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.350
 but the expert if anyone knows 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.040
 you have to be yes, I'm an expert 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:34.020
 the belly out 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.790
 So I know what decisions 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.370
 but then has to meet in the end 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:40.200
 it is relatively difficult to analyze 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.810
 is that we covered much better 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.790
 I have been accused 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.560
 and it is also clear that the fortieth 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:48.720
 Your lyrics came and there came again 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.130
 new momentum purely the deciding factor for 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.330
 me in the whole story is that 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:53.610
 the guys that annoy reserve that is 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:57.030
 unusual and that leaves us 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:58.110
 euphoric make you more than me and 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.510
 looking forward to the next match 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.770
