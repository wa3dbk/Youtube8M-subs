 always when you are going to do any 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:35.660
 type of exhaust replacement 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:38.239
 replace the sealing rings is to do 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.790
 good the good seal and the block then 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:43.460

 I'll explain at the end of the video to 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.040
 Do you guys have any the tip that kind of 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:50.540
 system that I have chosen so that 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.100
 tools that we will use the 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.559
 silicone that even comes in the kit 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.179
 ready to install as 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:58.300
 follow the process and I hope that you 

00:00:56.179 --> 00:00:58.300
 like 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.370
 finally 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.350
 finally 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.960
 15 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.720
 good people there complete the process of 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:14.770
 wiring installation f 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.850
 he's 14 21 I went with the collectors 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.430
 individual 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:21.610
 so you join the four 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:24.250
 collectors leaving the engine gasket in 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:28.420
 bottom of 2001 here below 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:29.680
 they are fixed is by springs also not 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:36.870
 I'll put it down here for you to give 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:41.830
 look here for the right probe holder 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:43.960
 I opted to use the extension cord 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.900
 this extender that we call 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:50.460
 linkin park is there as an option 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:53.740
 you choose on the site with the tip 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:56.860
 is the entire gp carbon aluminum up to the 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:58.930
 brushed aluminum finish is as 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.460
 pretty matte black is the person can 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.490
 choose to end with the exhaust 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:05.830
 under the scale or use this 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:07.780
 clears pi any difference the difference 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.820
 is that it gets more elongated can see 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:13.150
 that he is here in cod he is 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:14.980
 stuck here behind by a support one 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.890
 steel plate practically 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:20.020
 imperceptible here at the time of you 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.239
 to look at the bike from far away has a 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.550
 spacer where you stay then the 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:26.770
 pedalboard works normal you take out the 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.750
 screw sets the screw that 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:29.560
 already in the kit for you to install the 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.420
 equipment 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.310
 I opted for this template with linkin park 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.110
 with this elongated one on the side 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.920
 because what else generates performance in the 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.660
 moto 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.120
 It's necessary that we're walking now. 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.290
 delivered on the track and makes a difference 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.510
 great 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:46.959
 now, yes, my love, totally 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:50.739
 mounted already with spoiler docked 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:55.670
 Let's get more important first. Let's go. 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:59.209
 connect the motorcycle with the bevel damper 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.209
 then without 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:26.979
 pro rock staff we remove the damper 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:30.070
 knows he is arrested 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:34.060
 the tip for a screw June and now 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:37.650
 Let's start the bike without him. 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.650
 obviously we will not use the 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:44.050
 my name but still a little bit of 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:47.470
 the evaporation of water from the 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:53.590
 silicone sealing help you have 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:55.680
 a notion of how he found the goal 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:55.680
 to 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:03.690
 if I like gold 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:13.800
 today 8 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:13.800
 Hi, I'm a sketch of the world of tui. 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:32.040
 I can not go twice and I hope 

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:34.890
 that you have liked is going to fall on 

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:38.630
 escape link video description 

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:38.630
