so I'm going to use my pocket graphics
my<00:00:13.469> ribbit<00:00:13.830> one<00:00:14.040> just<00:00:14.429> to<00:00:15.529> blow<00:00:16.529> in<00:00:16.650> a<00:00:16.710> few

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
my ribbit one just to blow in a few

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.179 
my ribbit one just to blow in a few
stencils<00:00:17.400> but<00:00:17.580> first<00:00:17.820> I'm<00:00:17.940> going<00:00:18.060> to<00:00:18.119> add<00:00:18.300> in

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:19.189 
stencils but first I'm going to add in

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:23.509 
stencils but first I'm going to add in
Geall<00:00:20.189> this<00:00:20.369> banding<00:00:20.970> and<00:00:21.090> give<00:00:21.449> it<00:00:21.480> a<00:00:22.519> little

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
Geall this banding and give it a little

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.779 
Geall this banding and give it a little
texture<00:00:24.529> it's<00:00:25.529> going<00:00:25.680> to<00:00:25.740> appear<00:00:25.830> to<00:00:26.160> have<00:00:26.279> you

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
texture it's going to appear to have you

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.089 
texture it's going to appear to have you
know<00:00:26.880> ribs<00:00:27.420> running<00:00:28.199> down<00:00:28.349> and<00:00:28.590> like<00:00:28.710> a<00:00:28.740> center

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
know ribs running down and like a center

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.189 
know ribs running down and like a center
strip<00:00:29.400> almost<00:00:30.150> like<00:00:30.240> a<00:00:30.330> banding<00:00:30.750> of<00:00:30.840> a<00:00:30.900> shield

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
strip almost like a banding of a shield

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:42.530 
strip almost like a banding of a shield
and<00:00:40.460> going<00:00:41.460> to<00:00:41.579> do<00:00:41.700> this<00:00:41.850> up<00:00:42.059> a<00:00:42.180> little<00:00:42.300> bit

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
and going to do this up a little bit

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.250 
and going to do this up a little bit
here<00:00:43.730> let's<00:00:44.730> tell<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.030> medium<00:00:45.360> sized<00:00:45.600> rivet

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.250 

so<00:00:49.260> we're<00:00:49.379> going<00:00:49.440> to<00:00:49.559> run<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.800> drop<00:00:50.039> shadow

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
so we're going to run the drop shadow

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.000 
so we're going to run the drop shadow
will<00:00:52.260> make<00:00:52.410> it<00:00:52.500> look<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.710> little<00:00:52.829> superior<00:00:53.670> ated

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
will make it look a little superior ated

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.569 
will make it look a little superior ated
and<00:00:56.010> then<00:00:57.590> make<00:00:58.590> it<00:00:58.680> look<00:00:58.829> punched<00:00:59.190> in<00:00:59.370> so

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
and then make it look punched in so

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:06.320 
and then make it look punched in so
we'll<00:00:59.670> use<00:00:59.699> the<00:01:02.030> positive<00:01:03.030> sides

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.429 

and<00:01:07.330> now<00:01:07.570> we're<00:01:07.689> going<00:01:07.780> to<00:01:07.869> go<00:01:07.960> right<00:01:08.080> down<00:01:08.290> the

00:01:08.429 --> 00:01:08.439 
and now we're going to go right down the

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:19.630 
and now we're going to go right down the
line<00:01:09.420> let's<00:01:10.420> do<00:01:10.570> a<00:01:10.600> smaller<00:01:11.020> one<00:01:11.259> below<00:01:11.500> it

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.520 

ok

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.500 

by<00:01:24.159> flipping<00:01:24.430> it<00:01:24.700> like<00:01:24.880> this<00:01:25.090> you're<00:01:25.360> going<00:01:25.450> to

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:25.510 
by flipping it like this you're going to

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:29.370 
by flipping it like this you're going to
give<00:01:25.750> it<00:01:25.840> a<00:01:25.900> punched<00:01:26.380> in<00:01:26.560> look<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:29.080> then<00:01:29.290> when

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
give it a punched in look and then when

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.050 
give it a punched in look and then when
i<00:01:29.440> run<00:01:29.590> the<00:01:29.680> highlight<00:01:30.100> they<00:01:30.700> look<00:01:30.850> really

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
i run the highlight they look really

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:38.620 
i run the highlight they look really
cool

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.539 

so<00:01:39.630> kind<00:01:40.110> of<00:01:40.229> that<00:01:40.350> descending<00:01:40.950> what's<00:01:41.189> going

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
so kind of that descending what's going

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.910 
so kind of that descending what's going
on<00:01:44.719> eat<00:01:45.719> it<00:01:45.840> up<00:01:45.930> a<00:01:46.049> little<00:01:46.170> bit<00:01:46.289> more<00:01:46.560> make<00:01:46.829> it

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
on eat it up a little bit more make it

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:54.340 
on eat it up a little bit more make it
look<00:01:47.039> a<00:01:47.100> little<00:01:47.219> hammered<00:01:50.060> drop<00:01:51.060> shadow<00:01:51.420> this

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:01.800 

staining<00:01:55.350> it

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.240 

punch<00:02:02.810> out<00:02:03.020> this<00:02:03.229> Lilith<00:02:03.560> shadow<00:02:03.829> a<00:02:03.950> little

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
punch out this Lilith shadow a little

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:12.100 
punch out this Lilith shadow a little
bit<00:02:04.340> more<00:02:04.579> on<00:02:05.030> each<00:02:05.180> one<00:02:10.720> switch<00:02:11.720> up<00:02:11.900> to<00:02:12.020> the

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
bit more on each one switch up to the

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.199 
bit more on each one switch up to the
White<00:02:13.810> no<00:02:14.810> heavy<00:02:15.080> masking<00:02:15.650> on<00:02:15.769> this<00:02:16.209> just

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
White no heavy masking on this just

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:25.020 
White no heavy masking on this just
freehand<00:02:18.190> for<00:02:19.190> the<00:02:19.250> most<00:02:19.430> part<00:02:21.880> little<00:02:22.880> gleam

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
freehand for the most part little gleam

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.589 
freehand for the most part little gleam
right<00:02:26.030> on<00:02:26.209> the<00:02:26.269> top<00:02:27.580> with<00:02:28.580> one<00:02:28.760> more<00:02:28.970> time<00:02:29.239> up

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:29.599 
right on the top with one more time up

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:32.920 
right on the top with one more time up
here<00:02:30.940> they<00:02:31.940> can<00:02:32.090> a<00:02:32.120> little<00:02:32.209> hammered<00:02:32.630> in<00:02:32.750> so

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
here they can a little hammered in so

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:38.340 
here they can a little hammered in so
I'm<00:02:33.049> not<00:02:33.260> trying<00:02:33.620> to<00:02:33.650> make<00:02:33.769> it<00:02:33.890> super<00:02:34.220> smooth

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:44.410 

pick<00:02:39.350> up<00:02:39.470> a<00:02:39.560> little<00:02:39.860> facets<00:02:40.370> and<00:02:40.549> stuff

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:51.290 

I<00:02:44.510> like<00:02:45.080> the<00:02:45.230> bottom

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:03:00.650 

same<00:02:52.300> thing

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:06.470 

well<00:03:01.660> I<00:03:02.200> think<00:03:02.260> we<00:03:02.560> pretty<00:03:02.830> much<00:03:02.950> got<00:03:03.250> it<00:03:03.310> there

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:12.840 

yeah<00:03:07.480> maybe<00:03:08.260> I'll<00:03:08.440> go<00:03:08.620> in<00:03:08.830> and<00:03:09.010> just<00:03:09.280> up<00:03:11.850> and

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
yeah maybe I'll go in and just up and

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:39.450 
yeah maybe I'll go in and just up and
run<00:03:12.910> it<00:03:13.210> up<00:03:13.300> a<00:03:13.420> little<00:03:13.600> bit<00:03:13.750> more

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:39.460 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:49.150 

and<00:03:46.930> and<00:03:47.930> those<00:03:48.140> look<00:03:48.350> like<00:03:48.380> some<00:03:48.710> rivets<00:03:49.040> I

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
and and those look like some rivets I

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:55.840 
and and those look like some rivets I
think<00:03:52.390> more<00:03:53.390> to<00:03:53.510> come<00:03:53.660> later
