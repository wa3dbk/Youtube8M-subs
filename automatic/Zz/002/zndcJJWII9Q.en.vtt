00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:18.260 
I'm not quite sure that this header is

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:19.930 
I'm not quite sure that this header is
going<00:00:18.410> to<00:00:18.470> fit<00:00:18.680> in<00:00:18.860> this<00:00:18.949> configuration<00:00:19.340> at

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:19.940 
going to fit in this configuration at

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:21.630 
going to fit in this configuration at
this<00:00:20.090> point<00:00:20.330> but<00:00:20.540> look<00:00:20.690> we<00:00:20.810> got<00:00:20.960> the<00:00:21.080> motor<00:00:21.290> in

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:21.640 
this point but look we got the motor in

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.730 
this point but look we got the motor in
the<00:00:22.640> motor<00:00:22.880> is<00:00:23.060> in<00:00:23.240> and<00:00:23.600> bolted<00:00:24.050> am<00:00:24.230> right<00:00:24.470> the

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:24.740 
the motor is in and bolted am right the

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.460 
the motor is in and bolted am right the
motors<00:00:25.100> in<00:00:25.310> bolted<00:00:26.030> in<00:00:26.180> I'll<00:00:26.870> tell<00:00:27.200> you<00:00:27.230> what

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.470 
motors in bolted in I'll tell you what

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.370 
motors in bolted in I'll tell you what
I'm<00:00:27.800> not<00:00:28.280> sure<00:00:28.520> it's<00:00:28.670> both<00:00:28.850> it<00:00:29.030> in<00:00:29.150> a<00:00:29.480> hundred

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.380 
I'm not sure it's both it in a hundred

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.470 
I'm not sure it's both it in a hundred
percent<00:00:30.530> yet<00:00:31.010> because<00:00:31.490> i<00:00:31.730> can<00:00:32.090> grab<00:00:32.300> that

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:32.480 
percent yet because i can grab that

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.739 
percent yet because i can grab that
other<00:00:32.539> motor<00:00:32.899> mount<00:00:33.140> bolt<00:00:33.379> and<00:00:33.620> pull<00:00:33.800> it<00:00:33.829> out

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:34.749 
other motor mount bolt and pull it out

00:00:34.749 --> 00:00:37.119 
other motor mount bolt and pull it out
that<00:00:35.749> doesn't<00:00:36.079> seem<00:00:36.230> right<00:00:36.260> but<00:00:36.620> it<00:00:36.800> doesn't

00:00:37.119 --> 00:00:37.129 
that doesn't seem right but it doesn't

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:38.919 
that doesn't seem right but it doesn't
and<00:00:37.280> that's<00:00:37.370> also<00:00:37.670> why<00:00:38.030> I<00:00:38.269> think<00:00:38.420> our<00:00:38.749> header

00:00:38.919 --> 00:00:38.929 
and that's also why I think our header

00:00:38.929 --> 00:00:41.169 
and that's also why I think our header
is<00:00:39.710> hitting<00:00:40.159> the<00:00:40.190> crossmember<00:00:40.850> here<00:00:40.999> a<00:00:41.030> little

00:00:41.169 --> 00:00:41.179 
is hitting the crossmember here a little

00:00:41.179 --> 00:00:44.229 
is hitting the crossmember here a little
bit<00:00:41.300> okay<00:00:42.249> and<00:00:43.249> it<00:00:43.460> was<00:00:43.550> a<00:00:43.579> little<00:00:43.730> difficult

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
bit okay and it was a little difficult

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:45.700 
bit okay and it was a little difficult
to<00:00:44.539> put<00:00:44.749> in<00:00:44.870> so<00:00:45.050> I<00:00:45.079> don't<00:00:45.260> really<00:00:45.289> feel<00:00:45.469> like

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710 
to put in so I don't really feel like

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.869 
to put in so I don't really feel like
taking<00:00:46.069> off<00:00:46.190> part<00:00:46.489> right<00:00:46.699> now<00:00:48.460> how's<00:00:49.460> it<00:00:49.489> going

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:49.879

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
there's going to have to

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.630 
there's going to have to
be<00:02:04.990> sure<00:02:05.200> to<00:02:05.380> make<00:02:05.560> that<00:02:05.770> because<00:02:06.399> right<00:02:06.609> now

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
be sure to make that because right now

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.869 
be sure to make that because right now
if<00:02:06.909> you<00:02:07.060> kick<00:02:07.899> open<00:02:08.080> the<00:02:08.340> secondaries<00:02:09.340> it

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:09.879 
if you kick open the secondaries it

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:11.460 
if you kick open the secondaries it
stands<00:02:10.209> up<00:02:10.390> carburetor<00:02:10.959> because<00:02:11.319> they're

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
stands up carburetor because they're

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.650 
stands up carburetor because they're
hitting<00:02:11.680> intake<00:02:12.069> now<00:02:12.400> the<00:02:12.459> intake<00:02:13.209> might<00:02:13.450> be

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
hitting intake now the intake might be

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.280 
hitting intake now the intake might be
able<00:02:13.810> to<00:02:14.110> be<00:02:14.879> massaged<00:02:15.879> a<00:02:16.239> little<00:02:16.420> bit<00:02:16.599> so<00:02:17.260> that

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
able to be massaged a little bit so that

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.920 
able to be massaged a little bit so that
that<00:02:17.620> fits<00:02:17.980> that<00:02:18.519> opens<00:02:19.000> no<00:02:19.360> no<00:02:19.629> it<00:02:19.750> might<00:02:19.870> be

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
that fits that opens no no it might be

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.869 
that fits that opens no no it might be
saved<00:02:20.319> but<00:02:20.530> I<00:02:20.590> would<00:02:20.980> like<00:02:21.010> to<00:02:21.160> have<00:02:21.340> a<00:02:21.400> spacer
