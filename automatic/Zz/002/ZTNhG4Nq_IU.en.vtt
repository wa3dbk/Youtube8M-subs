00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
proactive the more I think Bobby really

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.860 
proactive the more I think Bobby really
views<00:03:30.440> his<00:03:30.620> boxing<00:03:31.190> as<00:03:31.340> a<00:03:31.400> means<00:03:32.030> to<00:03:32.210> an<00:03:32.330> end

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
I think the end for him is really

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.660 
I think the end for him is really
providing<00:03:35.660> a<00:03:36.020> lifestyle<00:03:36.620> for<00:03:36.770> his<00:03:37.070> family<00:03:37.490> and
