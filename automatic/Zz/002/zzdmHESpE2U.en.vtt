impressions<00:03:53.580> and<00:03:53.790> my<00:03:53.940> first<00:03:54.240> quick<00:03:54.510> hands-on

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
impressions and my first quick hands-on

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.840 
impressions and my first quick hands-on
look<00:03:55.230> I<00:03:55.440> found<00:03:55.680> the<00:03:55.890> performance<00:03:56.460> as<00:03:56.640> well<00:03:56.790> as

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
look I found the performance as well as

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.210 
look I found the performance as well as
screen<00:03:57.330> resolution<00:03:57.990> to<00:03:58.440> be<00:03:58.530> lower<00:03:58.740> than<00:03:59.010> say

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
screen resolution to be lower than say

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.520 
screen resolution to be lower than say
the<00:03:59.400> pro<00:03:59.730> series<00:04:00.000> models<00:04:00.540> that's<00:04:01.110> of<00:04:01.320> course

the pro series models that's of course

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.320 
the pro series models that's of course
to<00:04:01.650> be<00:04:01.740> expected<00:04:02.250> as<00:04:02.400> these<00:04:02.580> come<00:04:02.820> in<00:04:02.970> at<00:04:03.150> a

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.330 
to be expected as these come in at a

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.390 
to be expected as these come in at a
cheaper<00:04:03.750> price<00:04:03.990> point<00:04:04.350> I'll<00:04:04.710> be<00:04:05.040> using<00:04:05.130> it

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
cheaper price point I'll be using it

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.890 
cheaper price point I'll be using it
more<00:04:05.610> in<00:04:05.820> depth<00:04:06.060> over<00:04:06.300> the<00:04:06.390> next<00:04:06.540> couple<00:04:06.750> days
