00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
good and the game places that I got that

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.500 
good and the game places that I got that
I<00:02:51.870> call<00:02:52.200> good<00:02:52.470> are<00:02:52.769> nowhere<00:02:53.069> near<00:02:53.510> these

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
I call good are nowhere near these

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.030 
I call good are nowhere near these
standards<00:02:54.930> of<00:02:55.049> today's<00:02:55.260> game<00:02:55.530> players<00:02:55.829> and<00:02:56.010> I

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
standards of today's game players and I

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.710 
standards of today's game players and I
kind<00:02:56.280> of<00:02:56.340> feel<00:02:56.489> embarrassed<00:02:56.970> but<00:02:57.150> what<00:02:57.599> can

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
kind of feel embarrassed but what can

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:58.809 
kind of feel embarrassed but what can
you<00:02:57.780> do<00:02:57.930> everybody<00:02:58.200> has<00:02:58.470> to<00:02:58.560> learn<00:02:58.620> eventually

00:02:58.809 --> 00:02:58.819 
you do everybody has to learn eventually

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:01.339 
you do everybody has to learn eventually
so<00:02:59.819> as<00:03:00.150> I<00:03:00.540> was<00:03:00.689> trying<00:03:00.900> to<00:03:00.989> go<00:03:01.139> for<00:03:01.260> these

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 
so as I was trying to go for these

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:03.770 
so as I was trying to go for these
gameplays<00:03:01.889> eventually<00:03:02.669> I<00:03:02.700> got<00:03:03.090> stressed<00:03:03.480> out

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
gameplays eventually I got stressed out

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.690 
gameplays eventually I got stressed out
and<00:03:03.989> then<00:03:04.200> called<00:03:04.439> Duty<00:03:04.739> became<00:03:05.069> less<00:03:05.669> and

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
and then called Duty became less and

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.220 
and then called Duty became less and
less<00:03:05.909> fun<00:03:06.180> because<00:03:06.480> I<00:03:06.510> was<00:03:06.689> always<00:03:06.870> stressing

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
less fun because I was always stressing

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.409 
less fun because I was always stressing
over<00:03:07.290> a<00:03:07.409> gameplays<00:03:07.769> for<00:03:07.980> YouTube<00:03:08.340> so<00:03:09.209> then<00:03:09.389> I

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:09.419 
over a gameplays for YouTube so then I

00:03:09.419 --> 00:03:11.390 
over a gameplays for YouTube so then I
made<00:03:09.689> a<00:03:09.720> choice<00:03:09.989> I<00:03:10.260> was<00:03:10.439> like<00:03:10.620> I<00:03:10.829> can<00:03:11.250> either

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
made a choice I was like I can either

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.670 
made a choice I was like I can either
continue<00:03:11.959> stressing<00:03:12.959> over<00:03:13.079> mediocre

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
continue stressing over mediocre

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.099 
continue stressing over mediocre
gameplays<00:03:14.129> or<00:03:14.400> I<00:03:15.180> could<00:03:15.389> become<00:03:15.480> more<00:03:15.959> the

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:16.109 
gameplays or I could become more the

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:17.569 
gameplays or I could become more the
commentary<00:03:16.590> based<00:03:16.799> channel<00:03:16.950> and<00:03:17.220> that's<00:03:17.400> the

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
commentary based channel and that's the

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:19.819 
commentary based channel and that's the
path<00:03:17.760> that<00:03:17.909> I<00:03:18.000> took<00:03:18.060> because<00:03:18.989> obviously<00:03:19.260> I'm<00:03:19.739> a

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
path that I took because obviously I'm a

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:21.229 
path that I took because obviously I'm a
commentator<00:03:20.159> for<00:03:20.430> carnage<00:03:20.790> and<00:03:20.909> I'm<00:03:21.030> not<00:03:21.209> a

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
commentator for carnage and I'm not a

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:23.300 
commentator for carnage and I'm not a
player<00:03:21.510> because<00:03:21.780> nobody<00:03:22.229> would<00:03:22.409> really<00:03:22.560> find

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
player because nobody would really find

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.430 
player because nobody would really find
my<00:03:23.489> single<00:03:23.970> Moab's<00:03:24.359> my<00:03:24.569> single<00:03:24.930> five-minute

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440

any<00:03:28.440> fun<00:03:29.159> because<00:03:29.400> there<00:03:29.519> are<00:03:29.579> people<00:03:29.669> that

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:29.819 
any fun because there are people that

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:31.399 
any fun because there are people that
can<00:03:30.060> do<00:03:30.180> that<00:03:30.329> in<00:03:30.479> like<00:03:30.659> one<00:03:30.900> tenth<00:03:31.229> of<00:03:31.349> the

00:03:31.399 --> 00:03:31.409 
can do that in like one tenth of the

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:34.550 
can do that in like one tenth of the
time<00:03:31.680> so<00:03:32.220> there's<00:03:32.909> always<00:03:33.120> that<00:03:33.319> once<00:03:34.319> I<00:03:34.409> got

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
time so there's always that once I got

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.020 
time so there's always that once I got
the<00:03:34.650> hang<00:03:34.680> of<00:03:34.919> doing<00:03:34.979> commentaries<00:03:35.879> and<00:03:35.940> I

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
the hang of doing commentaries and I

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.520 
the hang of doing commentaries and I
became<00:03:36.299> less<00:03:36.540> and<00:03:36.599> less<00:03:36.750> awkward<00:03:36.989> in<00:03:37.319> front<00:03:37.379> of

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
became less and less awkward in front of

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:38.719 
became less and less awkward in front of
the<00:03:37.590> mic<00:03:37.829> and<00:03:37.919> actually<00:03:38.190> became<00:03:38.370> somewhat

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:38.729 
the mic and actually became somewhat

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:40.339 
the mic and actually became somewhat
decent<00:03:39.090> at<00:03:39.150> doing<00:03:39.419> them<00:03:39.569> I<00:03:39.750> started<00:03:40.229> to

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:40.349 
decent at doing them I started to

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:41.930 
decent at doing them I started to
experiment<00:03:40.680> with<00:03:40.919> different<00:03:41.069> commentary

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
experiment with different commentary

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:42.920 
experiment with different commentary
styles<00:03:42.389> now<00:03:42.540> you<00:03:42.599> might<00:03:42.810> be<00:03:42.840> thinking

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
styles now you might be thinking

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.080 
styles now you might be thinking
yourself<00:03:43.500> isn't<00:03:44.129> a<00:03:44.310> commentary<00:03:44.760> just<00:03:44.940> a

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
yourself isn't a commentary just a

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.449 
yourself isn't a commentary just a
commentary<00:03:45.510> there's<00:03:45.750> no<00:03:45.930> Styles<00:03:46.889> in<00:03:47.069> my

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
commentary there's no Styles in my

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.369 
commentary there's no Styles in my
opinion<00:03:47.790> they're<00:03:47.909> kind<00:03:48.120> of<00:03:48.209> art<00:03:48.449> because<00:03:49.109> you

00:03:49.369 --> 00:03:49.379 
opinion they're kind of art because you

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:50.960 
opinion they're kind of art because you
have<00:03:49.590> your<00:03:49.799> standard<00:03:50.250> commentaries<00:03:50.819> which

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
have your standard commentaries which

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.699 
have your standard commentaries which
are<00:03:51.120> a<00:03:51.150> medium-paced<00:03:51.780> which<00:03:52.409> is<00:03:52.530> what<00:03:52.620> I'm

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
are a medium-paced which is what I'm

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.199 
are a medium-paced which is what I'm
doing<00:03:52.889> right<00:03:53.010> now<00:03:53.069> that<00:03:53.459> everybody<00:03:53.760> does<00:03:53.970> and

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
doing right now that everybody does and

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.599 
doing right now that everybody does and
then<00:03:54.690> you<00:03:54.780> have<00:03:55.019> these<00:03:55.560> faster<00:03:56.099> paced<00:03:56.340> more

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:56.609 
then you have these faster paced more

00:03:56.609 --> 00:03:58.280 
then you have these faster paced more
aggressive<00:03:57.239> kind<00:03:57.449> of<00:03:57.510> commentaries<00:03:58.109> that

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
aggressive kind of commentaries that

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:59.869 
aggressive kind of commentaries that
