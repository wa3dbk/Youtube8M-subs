00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.650
 [Applause] 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:43.480
 this is my friend who lives in the low 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:45.550
 the stone of my patio is fine so that 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.650
 make no mistake in the test folder is 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.930
 simulated as if it were the real folder 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.820
 of the game to find the files 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.769
 to install the mods have to go to 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:58.140
 data and find the two folders that 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:58.140
 they are pc ps3 one and pc ps3 their 2 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:07.059
 so if they have any problems 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.059
 let me know for your comments I will help you 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:13.869
 well we open the file how 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.869
 I said in my case it's from a point of kz 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.140
 when they appear if they want 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.149
 update do not do it for anything in your 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.490
 life will harm the program and you will not be able to 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:28.390
 never open again or reinstalling the 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.030
 program may 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.860
 well you will see something like that and if I add 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:36.520
 brings two files instead of one 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:38.320
 means that you use audios are going to go to 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.800
 patch and will apply patch on 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.200
 binder 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.330
 they will search for the local folder of the game and 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.130
 inside they will look for the data folder and 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.080
 they will accept and it will appear that the 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.300
 file is not found and that will have it 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.460
 to search manually you are looking for 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.320
 manually and put it and it will start 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.780
 to install the mod and if it appears again 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:00.110
 can because they are two parts one of the 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:02.060
 models and both is from the audios now 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.750
 We will do a test with another one that has 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.750
 Two parts 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.840
 in my case it will be virus 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:42.970
 see what kz bill says it is the same 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.970
 step that the previous 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.720
 they open the game folder they look for the 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.880
 folder data and put the files that you 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.220
 ask you see now they put two files 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.230
 then he will ask you two to the process 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:08.580
 some many that use one file 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.580
 and two others there are no more than two 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:23.990
 and that's all it 's very easy to do this ah 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.910
 by the way if you did not understand anything in the 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:27.740
 description of the video is the link that 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.570
 brings the necessary programs to 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:31.670
 install the mods and if you did not understand 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.350
 how to install the mods there is also a 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:36.310
 file that explains step by step 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.310
 regards
