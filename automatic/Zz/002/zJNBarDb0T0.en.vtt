00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
it does connect I don't think it

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.430 
it does connect I don't think it
connects<00:03:08.549> in<00:03:08.760> a<00:03:08.850> way<00:03:09.000> that<00:03:09.299> most<00:03:09.780> people<00:03:10.260> think

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
it does but it does connect I think

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.539 
it does but it does connect I think
there's<00:03:13.680> a<00:03:13.739> strong<00:03:14.700> delusion<00:03:15.239> coming<00:03:16.140> in<00:03:16.549> 2012
