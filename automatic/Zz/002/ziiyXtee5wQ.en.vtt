 sitges the manners and many of you 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.539

 equal size Tuesday and fashion and then 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:37.940
 then we will investigate the library to 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:40.670
 investigate and we already found the terms 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:43.970
 to differentiate trend and not as in 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.770
 all industry the industry is managed 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.270
 by people obviously and within the 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.210
 Fashion field is not the exception 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:55.640
 then practically'm not interested in 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:57.050
 fashion the fashion industry and so 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.210
 so much we are going to describe the 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:02.020
 characters that intervene within 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.020
 this industry 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.740

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.930
 you in love so 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.270
 let's start with them then we start 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.370
 with the precursors or initiators that 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.440
 are at the tip of the triangle that are 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:17.570
 the opposites who are traveling by 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.940
 everyone as the term says 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.070
 in English he is looking for style and 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.960
 are the ones who see ethnic cultures are 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.760
 seeing the styles there 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.830
 are singing then there's 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.250
 they grab this what are the colors what 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.600
 what are these structures the prints 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.940
 All the fabrics 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.280
 it's like putting the cards on the table 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.990
 for designers we also have what 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.930
 who are the designers of haute couture 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:45.170
 which are the rings that 332 laymen in 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:47.180
 walkways with very elaborate clothes and 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.430
 very artisanal then they are the 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.170
 initiators or precursors the seconds 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.750
 characters and participate in these are the 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.700
 first adopters by the when 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.110
 zone artists that do is very obvious 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.150
 see them because they are the first ones that 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.460
 they feel in the front rows in all 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.170
 the catwalks and be totally in 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.130
 contact with the industry those those 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.229
 who access everything 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.539
 exclusive of the trends are those that 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.789
 they put eggs they classify as 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.470
 opinion leaders celebrities all 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.470
 those people who have interference 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.569
 in the public if two steps or three 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.849
 steps forward of society in the 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:22.610
 third row we have the seconds to 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:24.440
 enough or modeled is already removing 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.810
 we have got celebrity 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.060
 amazing here is when we invite to 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.040
 that celebrity or those who impose 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.830
 fashion then this is when the brands 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.019
 as zara bershka two other brands that 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.630
 we see in branch stores here already 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:40.340
 we can access these brands because what 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.260
 do more quickly for the 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.090
 society and do their when we consume 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.280
 now we go with the third adopters 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.560
 by the laggards at this stage and the 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.900
 Fashion had them and now calls out 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.450
 this is already going very well in this segment of 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.650
 the population there is still an interest 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.540
 of com probably for example the 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.549
 doctors in the main markets something 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.769
 they are already practically already we see the 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:02.780
 they sell and often because of a tendency to 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:07.269
 what a fashion already practically in the 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:09.860
 Tianguis in the market are already flat 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:11.660
 in this very important segment 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.510
 they are not willing to pay an amount 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:16.190
 very strong for the clothes we see how 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.320
 the first segments spend millions 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.660
 for having them but they are already in this phase 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.460
 and it has become so popular that they do not 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.760
 they care about consuming or investing 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:28.460
 too generally the public of 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.140
 mexico we find ourselves inside this in 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:31.730
 most where there are already stores 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.790
 popular on youtube you can access 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.590
 that here generally and to the quality of the 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.690
 design and all that is already going down and 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.670
 last we have the others or 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.200
 traditional are those people who 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:44.209
 they are not as aware of what 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.400
 is an example to do the 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:48.410
 old people those people who dress 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.030
 sometimes very classic eg 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:52.190
 fewer people who are walking in the 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.739
 street we say something lacks city 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:57.290
 well and something I want to put him to his 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:58.790
 garments but if they exist very classic and 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.040
 they do not take much risks with love 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.660
 they generally do not care 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.550
 innovation stay these issues 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.739
 Sundays that those who dress like the 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:09.380
 too basic need is worth noting 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:10.870
 that this market segment is very 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.120
 interesting because 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.099
 this economic right that they do 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.350
 it is too much and as there is no investment 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:19.239
 in innovation and then not obviously 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.130
 for the rock producers it's very 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.990
 profitable so you will be able to 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.430
 identify that the character of fashion 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.080
 because your role is played 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.729
 within the process of fashion really wrong 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.530
 and that's why the important thing if you 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:31.300
 they want to do like these avant-garde 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:33.370
 as these initiators all those who are 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.110
 keep in contact employees in 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.940
 magazines and they are always nourishing 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:42.580
 about all these criminal as 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:45.780
 they cut sales of many magazines there are 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.780
 many books interested 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:05:01.580
 I'm not trendy or this is a 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:01.580
 trend then we already know difference
