the<00:00:00.240> last<00:00:00.480> type<00:00:00.690> of<00:00:00.719> canes<00:00:01.020> that<00:00:01.199> we<00:00:01.290> need<00:00:01.410> to

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:01.530 
the last type of canes that we need to

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:03.139 
the last type of canes that we need to
know<00:00:01.650> about<00:00:01.860> is<00:00:02.070> this<00:00:02.280> thing<00:00:02.550> called<00:00:02.850> the

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
know about is this thing called the

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.720 
know about is this thing called the
interrupted<00:00:03.929> cadence<00:00:05.899> interrupted<00:00:07.730> cadence

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
interrupted cadence interrupted cadence

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.850 
interrupted cadence interrupted cadence
and<00:00:08.880> why<00:00:09.000> do<00:00:09.059> we<00:00:09.179> call<00:00:09.480> it<00:00:09.540> the<00:00:10.050> interrupted

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
and why do we call it the interrupted

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.610 
and why do we call it the interrupted
cadence<00:00:11.219> well<00:00:11.370> it's<00:00:11.490> because<00:00:12.110> it's<00:00:13.110> a<00:00:13.230> cadence

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
cadence well it's because it's a cadence

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.980 
cadence well it's because it's a cadence
that<00:00:13.679> sets<00:00:14.040> us<00:00:14.250> up<00:00:14.280> expecting<00:00:15.269> one<00:00:15.480> thing<00:00:15.750> and

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
that sets us up expecting one thing and

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.930 
that sets us up expecting one thing and
in<00:00:16.230> fact<00:00:16.260> interrupts<00:00:17.160> that<00:00:17.190> thing<00:00:17.550> to<00:00:17.699> give<00:00:17.820> us

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
in fact interrupts that thing to give us

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.189 
in fact interrupts that thing to give us
something<00:00:18.240> else<00:00:18.359> so<00:00:18.510> the<00:00:18.630> thing<00:00:18.779> that<00:00:18.900> it<00:00:18.990> sets

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
something else so the thing that it sets

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.349 
something else so the thing that it sets
us<00:00:19.350> up<00:00:19.439> to<00:00:19.590> expect<00:00:20.010> is<00:00:20.220> a<00:00:20.250> perfect<00:00:20.820> cadence<00:00:21.210> and

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
us up to expect is a perfect cadence and

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.390 
us up to expect is a perfect cadence and
as<00:00:21.630> we<00:00:21.750> said<00:00:21.960> a<00:00:22.140> perfect<00:00:22.830> cadence<00:00:22.980> is<00:00:23.160> when<00:00:23.310> we

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
as we said a perfect cadence is when we

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.920 
as we said a perfect cadence is when we
move<00:00:23.609> from<00:00:23.850> chord<00:00:24.269> 5<00:00:24.539> to<00:00:25.320> chord<00:00:25.740> 1<00:00:26.010> now<00:00:26.880> in<00:00:27.570> an

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
move from chord 5 to chord 1 now in an

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.439 
move from chord 5 to chord 1 now in an
interrupted<00:00:28.740> cadence<00:00:29.070> what<00:00:29.250> happens<00:00:29.609> is<00:00:29.789> we

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
interrupted cadence what happens is we

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:31.429 
interrupted cadence what happens is we
say<00:00:30.630> well<00:00:30.810> we're<00:00:30.960> not<00:00:31.050> going<00:00:31.170> to<00:00:31.260> give<00:00:31.349> you

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
say well we're not going to give you

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:32.510 
say well we're not going to give you
what<00:00:31.560> you<00:00:31.650> expect<00:00:31.980> we're<00:00:32.099> not<00:00:32.189> going<00:00:32.340> to<00:00:32.369> give

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
what you expect we're not going to give

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.620 
what you expect we're not going to give
you<00:00:32.640> chord<00:00:32.880> 1<00:00:33.090> we're<00:00:33.270> going<00:00:33.300> to<00:00:33.450> give<00:00:33.600> you

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
you chord 1 we're going to give you

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.560 
you chord 1 we're going to give you
chord<00:00:33.989> six<00:00:34.290> instead<00:00:34.920> and<00:00:35.190> so<00:00:35.820> while<00:00:36.059> we<00:00:36.239> start

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
chord six instead and so while we start

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.510 
chord six instead and so while we start
the<00:00:36.690> cadence<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.079> same<00:00:37.290> way<00:00:37.500> on<00:00:37.710> chord<00:00:38.250> five

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
the cadence the same way on chord five

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.819 
the cadence the same way on chord five
we<00:00:38.850> change<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.660> path<00:00:39.899> we<00:00:40.230> change<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.590> course

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
we change the path we change the course

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.319 
we change the path we change the course
of<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.100> Harmony<00:00:41.460> so<00:00:41.640> that<00:00:41.760> we<00:00:41.850> finish<00:00:42.149> on

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
of the Harmony so that we finish on

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.959 
of the Harmony so that we finish on
chord<00:00:42.899> six<00:00:43.230> now<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.829> effect<00:00:44.190> of<00:00:44.370> that<00:00:44.520> is<00:00:44.579> a

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
chord six now the effect of that is a

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.150 
chord six now the effect of that is a
real<00:00:45.210> surprise<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:46.110> color<00:00:46.410> that<00:00:46.620> we<00:00:46.739> get<00:00:46.950> from

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
real surprise the color that we get from

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.549 
real surprise the color that we get from
chord<00:00:47.430> six<00:00:47.700> is<00:00:47.910> very<00:00:48.210> different<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.289> color

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
chord six is very different to the color

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:50.990 
chord six is very different to the color
of<00:00:49.770> harmony<00:00:50.190> we<00:00:50.309> would<00:00:50.399> expect<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:50.760> get<00:00:50.940> from

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
of harmony we would expect to get from

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.450 
of harmony we would expect to get from
chord<00:00:51.329> one<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:51.809> so<00:00:52.559> this<00:00:52.710> is<00:00:52.829> a<00:00:52.860> really<00:00:53.219> good

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
chord one and so this is a really good

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.450 
chord one and so this is a really good
tool<00:00:53.789> to<00:00:53.820> use<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.559> play<00:00:55.559> on<00:00:55.770> your<00:00:55.800> audience's

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
tool to use to play on your audience's

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.590 
tool to use to play on your audience's
expectations<00:00:56.760> where<00:00:57.270> they<00:00:57.360> might<00:00:57.570> be

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
expectations where they might be

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.779 
expectations where they might be
expecting<00:00:58.020> a<00:00:58.410> nice<00:00:58.590> finished<00:00:59.190> complete

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
expecting a nice finished complete

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.400 
expecting a nice finished complete
perfect<00:01:00.329> cadence<00:01:00.539> and<00:01:00.899> instead<00:01:01.230> you<00:01:01.379> just

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
perfect cadence and instead you just

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.160 
perfect cadence and instead you just
turn<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.129> corner<00:01:02.520> and<00:01:02.640> give<00:01:03.300> them<00:01:03.510> chord<00:01:03.840> six

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
turn the corner and give them chord six

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.960 
turn the corner and give them chord six
which<00:01:04.439> is<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:04.799> real<00:01:05.250> surprise<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:05.850> not

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
which is a real surprise and not

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.250 
which is a real surprise and not
something<00:01:06.180> they<00:01:06.360> would<00:01:06.510> have<00:01:06.540> been<00:01:06.689> expecting

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
something they would have been expecting

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.320 
something they would have been expecting
let's<00:01:08.189> just<00:01:08.310> have<00:01:08.430> a<00:01:08.460> listen<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:08.760> a<00:01:08.850> couple<00:01:09.240> of

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
let's just have a listen to a couple of

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.690 
let's just have a listen to a couple of
interrupted<00:01:09.990> Cadence's<00:01:10.500> one<00:01:10.740> in<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.130> major<00:01:11.369> key

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
interrupted Cadence's one in a major key

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.679 
interrupted Cadence's one in a major key
and<00:01:13.340> one<00:01:14.340> in<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:14.700> minor<00:01:14.939> key<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.420> reason

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
and one in a minor key and the reason

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.630 
and one in a minor key and the reason
that<00:01:15.720> I<00:01:15.840> I'm<00:01:16.530> going<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.799> do<00:01:16.860> two<00:01:17.040> examples<00:01:17.070> is

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
that I I'm going to do two examples is

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:18.679 
that I I'm going to do two examples is
because<00:01:17.880> they<00:01:17.970> have<00:01:18.119> a<00:01:18.150> slightly<00:01:18.479> different

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
because they have a slightly different

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.289 
because they have a slightly different
sound<00:01:19.110> in<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.439> major<00:01:19.680> key<00:01:19.860> we're<00:01:20.670> moving<00:01:21.090> from

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
sound in the major key we're moving from

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.880 
sound in the major key we're moving from
called<00:01:22.110> five<00:01:22.380> which<00:01:22.680> is<00:01:22.830> always<00:01:23.009> major<00:01:24.890> to

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
called five which is always major to

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.249 
called five which is always major to
chord<00:01:26.700> six<00:01:26.970> which<00:01:27.210> is<00:01:27.420> always<00:01:27.750> minor<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:30.110> in<00:01:31.110> a

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
chord six which is always minor and in a

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.120 
chord six which is always minor and in a
minor<00:01:31.530> key

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
minor key

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.399 
minor key
don't<00:01:32.400> forget<00:01:32.549> called<00:01:32.820> five<00:01:33.150> is<00:01:33.479> always<00:01:33.930> major

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
don't forget called five is always major

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.350 
don't forget called five is always major
because<00:01:34.799> we're<00:01:35.100> sharpening<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.880> seventh<00:01:36.210> of

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
because we're sharpening the seventh of

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.700 
because we're sharpening the seventh of
the<00:01:36.390> scale<00:01:36.720> to<00:01:36.900> give<00:01:37.020> us<00:01:37.140> our<00:01:37.290> called<00:01:38.070> five<00:01:38.369> and

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
the scale to give us our called five and

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.039 
the scale to give us our called five and
chord<00:01:40.710> six<00:01:40.979> is<00:01:41.189> also<00:01:41.640> major<00:01:41.909> but<00:01:42.810> because

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
chord six is also major but because

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.480 
chord six is also major but because
we've<00:01:43.200> been<00:01:43.380> working<00:01:43.740> in<00:01:43.799> a<00:01:43.890> minor<00:01:44.100> key<00:01:44.340> we've

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
we've been working in a minor key we've

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.780 
we've been working in a minor key we've
got<00:01:44.700> that<00:01:44.880> darker<00:01:45.479> minor<00:01:46.200> key<00:01:46.649> color<00:01:47.460> in<00:01:47.670> the

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
got that darker minor key color in the

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.090 
got that darker minor key color in the
music<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:48.240> so<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.570> arrival<00:01:49.110> of<00:01:49.200> this<00:01:49.470> major

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
music and so the arrival of this major

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.770 
music and so the arrival of this major
chord<00:01:50.549> where<00:01:50.820> we<00:01:50.909> would<00:01:51.060> have<00:01:51.149> been<00:01:51.270> expecting

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
chord where we would have been expecting

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.990 
chord where we would have been expecting
the<00:01:51.930> minor<00:01:52.200> chord<00:01:52.590> of<00:01:52.799> chord<00:01:53.369> wonks<00:01:53.759> because

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
the minor chord of chord wonks because

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.789 
the minor chord of chord wonks because
called<00:01:54.270> one<00:01:54.479> is<00:01:54.600> always<00:01:54.840> minor<00:01:55.170> in<00:01:55.439> a<00:01:55.530> minor

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
called one is always minor in a minor

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.609 
called one is always minor in a minor
key<00:01:56.100> that<00:01:56.759> just<00:01:57.030> is<00:01:57.119> another<00:01:57.240> way<00:01:57.600> of<00:01:57.780> changing

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
key that just is another way of changing

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.350 
key that just is another way of changing
the<00:01:58.920> color<00:01:59.159> of<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.430> music<00:01:59.700> and<00:01:59.820> giving<00:02:00.119> us<00:02:00.210> an

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
the color of the music and giving us an

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.149 
the color of the music and giving us an
unexpected<00:02:01.020> surprise<00:02:01.140> so<00:02:01.530> here<00:02:01.710> are<00:02:01.890> two

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
unexpected surprise so here are two

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.850 
unexpected surprise so here are two
examples<00:02:02.189> showing<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.570> surprise<00:02:04.409> of<00:02:04.710> an

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
examples showing the surprise of an

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:11.070 
examples showing the surprise of an
interrupted<00:02:05.399> cadence

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:21.660 

you

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.690 

and<00:02:23.770> so<00:02:24.770> I<00:02:24.800> hope<00:02:25.010> you'll<00:02:25.190> agree<00:02:25.370> that<00:02:25.459> the

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
and so I hope you'll agree that the

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.520 
and so I hope you'll agree that the
arrival<00:02:26.239> of<00:02:26.330> cord<00:02:26.569> 6<00:02:26.840> is<00:02:26.959> a<00:02:26.989> really<00:02:27.319> surprising

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
arrival of cord 6 is a really surprising

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.130 
arrival of cord 6 is a really surprising
sound<00:02:28.430> not<00:02:28.700> expected<00:02:29.390> and<00:02:29.540> it's<00:02:29.630> a<00:02:29.720> really

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
sound not expected and it's a really

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.780 
sound not expected and it's a really
good<00:02:30.319> way<00:02:30.500> for<00:02:30.800> us<00:02:30.830> to<00:02:31.010> play<00:02:31.370> with<00:02:31.400> the

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
good way for us to play with the

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.670 
good way for us to play with the
expectations<00:02:32.540> of<00:02:32.660> our<00:02:32.840> audience<00:02:33.230> and<00:02:33.410> fool

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
expectations of our audience and fool

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.290 
expectations of our audience and fool
them<00:02:33.920> into<00:02:34.069> thinking<00:02:34.550> that<00:02:35.000> we're<00:02:35.150> going<00:02:35.239> to

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
them into thinking that we're going to

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.330 
them into thinking that we're going to
give<00:02:35.480> them<00:02:35.660> a<00:02:35.750> normal<00:02:35.900> perfect<00:02:36.500> cadence<00:02:36.680> but

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
give them a normal perfect cadence but

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.479 
give them a normal perfect cadence but
instead<00:02:37.700> leave<00:02:38.390> the<00:02:38.750> phrase<00:02:39.250> incomplete<00:02:40.250> and

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
instead leave the phrase incomplete and

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:43.059 
instead leave the phrase incomplete and
slightly<00:02:41.200> derailed<00:02:42.200> if<00:02:42.500> you<00:02:42.590> like<00:02:42.800> and<00:02:43.010> then

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:43.069 
slightly derailed if you like and then

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:44.380 
slightly derailed if you like and then
we<00:02:43.250> can<00:02:43.280> put<00:02:43.640> in<00:02:43.760> something<00:02:44.090> that<00:02:44.120> does

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
we can put in something that does

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.089 
we can put in something that does
complete<00:02:44.840> the<00:02:44.959> phrase<00:02:45.170> so<00:02:45.380> I'll<00:02:45.650> just<00:02:45.890> play

00:02:46.089 --> 00:02:46.099 
complete the phrase so I'll just play

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:48.220 
complete the phrase so I'll just play
the<00:02:46.580> example<00:02:46.970> again<00:02:47.090> but<00:02:47.510> this<00:02:47.630> time<00:02:47.690> I<00:02:48.050> will

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
the example again but this time I will

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.110 
the example again but this time I will
add<00:02:48.410> after<00:02:48.830> my<00:02:49.130> interrupted<00:02:49.640> cadence<00:02:50.000> a

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
add after my interrupted cadence a

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.449 
add after my interrupted cadence a
completing<00:02:51.019> phrase<00:02:51.290> ending<00:02:51.950> in<00:02:52.040> a<00:02:52.099> perfect

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
completing phrase ending in a perfect

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:54.789 
completing phrase ending in a perfect
games<00:02:52.670> to<00:02:52.910> finish<00:02:53.120> off<00:02:53.510> the<00:02:54.049> phrase<00:02:54.350> in<00:02:54.560> a<00:02:54.620> kind

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:54.799 
games to finish off the phrase in a kind

00:02:54.799 --> 00:03:03.370 
games to finish off the phrase in a kind
of<00:02:54.860> satisfactory<00:02:55.549> way

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:09.210 

you

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.940 

and<00:03:10.030> so<00:03:10.180> there<00:03:10.420> are<00:03:10.450> the<00:03:10.810> four<00:03:11.050> Cadence's<00:03:11.710> that

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
and so there are the four Cadence's that

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.040 
and so there are the four Cadence's that
we're<00:03:12.070> most<00:03:12.340> likely<00:03:12.760> to<00:03:12.880> find<00:03:13.060> in<00:03:13.390> any<00:03:13.720> piece

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.050 
we're most likely to find in any piece

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:15.840 
we're most likely to find in any piece
of<00:03:14.080> music<00:03:14.410> we've<00:03:14.830> got<00:03:15.010> these<00:03:15.130> Cadence's<00:03:15.700> that

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
of music we've got these Cadence's that

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:17.730 
of music we've got these Cadence's that
help<00:03:16.060> complete<00:03:16.420> things<00:03:16.960> and<00:03:17.200> make<00:03:17.320> them<00:03:17.470> sound

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:17.740 
help complete things and make them sound

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.070 
help complete things and make them sound
finished<00:03:18.340> like<00:03:18.910> the<00:03:19.060> perfect<00:03:19.270> cadence<00:03:19.720> and

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
finished like the perfect cadence and

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.900 
finished like the perfect cadence and
the<00:03:20.140> plague<00:03:20.470> or<00:03:20.650> cadence<00:03:21.040> and<00:03:21.160> then<00:03:21.610> we've<00:03:21.730> got

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
the plague or cadence and then we've got

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.700 
the plague or cadence and then we've got
these<00:03:22.060> things<00:03:22.360> that<00:03:22.540> help<00:03:22.750> us<00:03:22.960> just<00:03:23.470> bring

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:23.710 
these things that help us just bring

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:25.170 
these things that help us just bring
something<00:03:23.890> to<00:03:24.070> a<00:03:24.100> close<00:03:24.370> but<00:03:24.550> not<00:03:24.820> in<00:03:24.940> such<00:03:25.150> a

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
something to a close but not in such a

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.060 
something to a close but not in such a
definitive<00:03:25.570> way<00:03:25.960> which<00:03:26.170> suggests<00:03:26.380> there's

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070 
definitive way which suggests there's

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:28.860 
definitive way which suggests there's
more<00:03:27.580> to<00:03:27.760> come<00:03:27.910> and<00:03:28.090> we<00:03:28.150> should<00:03:28.300> expect<00:03:28.540> the

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
more to come and we should expect the

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.360 
more to come and we should expect the
next<00:03:29.050> bit<00:03:29.320> of<00:03:29.410> music<00:03:29.500> to<00:03:29.800> come<00:03:29.950> along<00:03:30.190> pretty

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
next bit of music to come along pretty

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.910 
next bit of music to come along pretty
soon<00:03:30.490> those<00:03:31.090> are<00:03:31.360> the<00:03:31.780> imperfect<00:03:32.200> cadence<00:03:32.560> and

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
soon those are the imperfect cadence and

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.560 
soon those are the imperfect cadence and
this<00:03:33.070> interrupted<00:03:33.790> canes<00:03:34.000> that<00:03:34.150> we've<00:03:34.390> just

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:34.570 
this interrupted canes that we've just

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:36.780 
this interrupted canes that we've just
been<00:03:34.780> looking<00:03:34.900> at<00:03:35.260> so<00:03:35.920> hopefully<00:03:36.280> you'll<00:03:36.640> be

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
been looking at so hopefully you'll be

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.520 
been looking at so hopefully you'll be
able<00:03:36.910> to<00:03:37.210> start<00:03:37.480> listening<00:03:37.960> out<00:03:38.080> for<00:03:38.290> some<00:03:38.410> of

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
able to start listening out for some of

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.500 
able to start listening out for some of
these<00:03:38.620> Cadence's<00:03:39.220> in<00:03:39.400> music<00:03:39.880> most<00:03:40.150> of<00:03:40.330> them

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
these Cadence's in music most of them

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.540 
these Cadence's in music most of them
will<00:03:40.990> be<00:03:41.110> perfect<00:03:41.500> Cadence's<00:03:41.980> these<00:03:42.190> are<00:03:42.400> the

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:42.550 
will be perfect Cadence's these are the

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:44.880 
will be perfect Cadence's these are the
most<00:03:42.850> commonly<00:03:43.390> used<00:03:43.620> cadence<00:03:44.620> that<00:03:44.680> we'll

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
most commonly used cadence that we'll

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:46.620 
most commonly used cadence that we'll
find<00:03:45.130> but<00:03:45.310> you<00:03:45.340> may<00:03:45.550> hear<00:03:45.790> people<00:03:45.820> throwing<00:03:46.390> in

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
find but you may hear people throwing in
