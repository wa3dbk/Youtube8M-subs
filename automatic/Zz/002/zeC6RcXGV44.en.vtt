00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.330
 they have to download them all 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.960
 we have to open where we keep the 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.960
 emulator 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.820
 and we installed it 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:34.960

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:42.810
 description 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:45.870
 and a file that is the point 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:47.520
 there is that file point roll there 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.800
 copy it into the folder where we will have 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.800
 the throws that is our games 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:59.570
 now we proceed to open the emulator 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:05.640
 and here in my game we have to look 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.190
 the folder where we keep our 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.280
 games in my case I skirt it that breaks 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:13.310
 emulators try 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:16.310
 and here these are all the games that 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:19.119
 we can have for example is he 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.119
 radio 23 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:26.229
 the boy charly to that if I want 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:28.000
 continue and continue with the game in this 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:30.300
 case he says it to me because I kept my 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.780
 departure 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:36.240
 to save games is here 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.070
 gives us several slots now if we want 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:42.030
 a game save a quick game 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.310
 here we give it and it 's to load our 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:48.640
 departure 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.640
 is different this will tell us yes 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:59.780
 to change already this 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:01.250
 the position of the screen is here in 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.350
 auto is so that when we turn the 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.270
 screen the sensor does not detect me 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:09.610
 I recommend laws that because if we do not use 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.610
 the sensor and the sensor of this battery 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.440
 here it would be the size of the controls 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.960
 that we want, I leave it like that 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.950
 because it is also that as you will see the 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.950
 minor by the fast 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.020
 good friends that has been everything I hope that 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.690

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:37.270
