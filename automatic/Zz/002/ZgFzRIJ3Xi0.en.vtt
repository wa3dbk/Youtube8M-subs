00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:05.410
 a 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:18.199
 We see that the nature of most currently has turned positive on op 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:19.039
 other markets 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:22.029
 you often do not see any of the year that the analysts are positive 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:25.640
 partly justified in view of the improvement in economic activity in recent months 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:26.179
 Numbers 

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:28.350
 and that underlies that we too 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:30.130
 slowly become a positive 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.450
 on the other hand how are but still careful 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.850
 mainly due to a number of long-term structural problems 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:38.550
 that still have to be solved 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.070
 and they now seem to move more to the background 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.780
 as far as it prints on the headlines 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.830
 but it will certainly continue to play a role in the long term 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.990
 we expect an average of around 5 to 6 percent for the coming four years 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:51.190
 stock markets 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.170
 but that does not mean that the idea year will be reached exactly that level 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.950
 can very well be that this year will be a somewhat stronger year and that it will be over 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:02.190
 returns are achieved, but that in 2012 and 2013 most of them lived and lived 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.520
 example becomes that minus five and minus 10 percent and you come 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.540
 on average just to get the kids out of the neighborhood 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.170
 the reason that expect five to six percent 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.490
 is on the one hand that there is the long-term economic growth going on 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.550
 then act in the nineties 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:18.470
 on the other hand, the current share 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.560
 are not cheap 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.430
 in munich markesteijn there might even be a slight push 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.020
 Europe is just fine, just fine the price 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.190
 she is also going to mark it to have done it there are few people who are whole 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:30.790
 positive are provocations 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.680
 and I think that is a good strategic decision aid in the longer term, he expects 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:35.330
 also 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.830
 penn and no high efficiency or say 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.060
 for the next four years we think that government bond yields are around the 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.980
 zero will be 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.620
 it is mainly due to rising interest rates that friezes are made 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:46.340
 to become 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.510
 and that is why we are a bit more cautious with government bonds 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:50.200
 view 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.890
 I expect that we will go structurally in the long term and with high interest rates 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.680
 but that is accompanied by considerable fluctuations and I would not 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.660
 surprised as the interest rate wiser 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:01.190
 half a percent lower 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.450
 if your purely financial markets look like the euro dollar rate is very very stable 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.229
 has become put between 31 and 35 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.429
 and actually the unrest about the 

00:02:11.429 --> 00:02:13.789
 problem countries in europe ireland 

00:02:13.789 --> 00:02:17.199
 portugal spain greece it seems a bit like background companies 

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:19.729
 that that has to do with that 

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:24.369
 2 further this is part press centers approve the banks and rock there is therefore 

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:28.139
 also if criticized but who do you know what you are wearing and that ensures 

00:02:28.139 --> 00:02:30.989
 that there is a stable rate of the euro slowly 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:34.659
 the bad news from southern european countries that were a little less good for it 

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:36.849
 is without is all actually known and is 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:39.219
 as far as I am concerned has been included in the rates 

00:02:39.219 --> 00:02:42.669
 and as soon as the new information arrives, it goes like a pelÃ© 

00:02:42.669 --> 00:02:45.669
 at the moment there are no new developments and they remain 

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:50.209
 Those countries just need a very long-term recovery plan very good 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:51.299
 stories germany 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:53.919
 For example, unemployment in Germany is currently running out 

00:02:53.919 --> 00:02:55.609
 lowest level in 20 years 

00:02:55.609 --> 00:03:00.049
 and what I also like is that there is also Germany with negative 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:02.819
 way in the good location so after the 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:05.719
 that the Oostendestraat has arrived from Sam, unemployed people are waiting 20 percent 

00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:09.339
 Meanwhile, Germany has also fallen to less than 10 

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:11.099
 so that is quite a while that development 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:15.599
 so you also see that the German economy is very much there from a good strong man 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:16.329
 stand trial 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:19.719
 in terms of equity regions it might be nice to take a look at japan 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:23.949
 it's a market that served in December the end choose I have a better job 

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:26.960
 but in fact Japan did very badly in 2010 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:28.759
 so barely got out of place 

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:31.759
 they have all other scholarships clearly posted the title on its return 

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:33.729
 and it's a market that 

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:36.739
 nobody nobody owns 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:40.450
 but where slowly I also called here leaked and usually nature 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.450
 pretty good as the global economy also stronger 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:47.299
 it is it is a bit of a speculative 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:48.509
 it's a gamble 

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:51.789
 but Japan is a webcam, the moon is a very nice guy 

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:53.219
 the
