00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:32.750 
I said you don't have to use this side

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.390 
I said you don't have to use this side
this<00:00:33.020> is<00:00:33.079> the<00:00:33.320> more<00:00:33.470> flattering<00:00:33.829> side<00:00:34.100> but<00:00:34.280> you

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:34.400 
this is the more flattering side but you

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.840 
this is the more flattering side but you
can<00:00:34.430> use<00:00:34.850> this<00:00:35.030> side<00:00:36.070> okay<00:00:37.070> from<00:00:37.400> color<00:00:37.579> this

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
can use this side okay from color this

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.250 
can use this side okay from color this
would<00:00:38.030> be<00:00:38.210> how<00:00:38.540> you<00:00:38.600> go<00:00:38.780> do<00:00:38.960> it

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
would be how you go do it

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.910 
would be how you go do it
multi<00:00:40.190> colors<00:00:40.520> yes<00:00:41.090> okay<00:00:41.720> and<00:00:41.960> then<00:00:42.829> this

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
multi colors yes okay and then this

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.830 
multi colors yes okay and then this
would<00:00:43.100> be<00:00:43.220> a<00:00:43.250> seam<00:00:43.550> allowance<00:00:43.970> just<00:00:44.180> seam<00:00:44.600> line

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:44.840 
would be a seam allowance just seam line

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:53.650 
would be a seam allowance just seam line
and<00:00:48.730> this<00:00:49.730> is<00:00:49.940> also<00:00:50.150> you<00:00:50.420> assume<00:00:50.660> line<00:00:52.540> for<00:00:53.540> you

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 
and this is also you assume line for you

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.720 
and this is also you assume line for you
so<00:00:53.840> and<00:00:54.110> then<00:00:54.230> this<00:00:54.350> would<00:00:54.560> be<00:00:54.680> your<00:00:54.950> pattern

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:57.730 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:09.739 

there<00:00:58.730> you<00:00:58.820> know<00:00:58.940> got<00:00:59.120> big<00:00:59.300> hands

00:01:09.739 --> 00:01:09.749 

00:01:09.749 --> 00:01:14.279 

just<00:01:10.749> an<00:01:10.899> example<00:01:12.600> so<00:01:13.600> this<00:01:13.749> is<00:01:13.869> also<00:01:14.049> how<00:01:14.229> you

00:01:14.279 --> 00:01:14.289 
just an example so this is also how you

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:17.880 
just an example so this is also how you
create<00:01:14.590> your<00:01:14.649> own<00:01:14.740> print<00:01:15.299> why<00:01:16.299> not

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890 
create your own print why not

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.550 
create your own print why not
so<00:01:18.219> now<00:01:18.399> we'll<00:01:18.700> come<00:01:18.850> and<00:01:18.990> stitch<00:01:19.990> on<00:01:20.170> my<00:01:20.200> seam

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
so now we'll come and stitch on my seam

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.849 
so now we'll come and stitch on my seam
line<00:01:20.829> it's<00:01:21.520> just<00:01:21.729> three<00:01:21.880> foot<00:01:22.090> of<00:01:22.240> an<00:01:22.359> inch

00:01:22.849 --> 00:01:22.859 
line it's just three foot of an inch

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:27.859 
line it's just three foot of an inch
which<00:01:23.859> is<00:01:24.039> the<00:01:24.159> last<00:01:24.340> line<00:01:24.609> on<00:01:24.850> the<00:01:25.090> seam<00:01:25.299> guide

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:56.530 

actually<00:01:28.869> see<00:01:29.349> it

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.510 

and<00:01:56.750> then<00:01:57.230> you<00:01:57.380> would<00:01:57.500> also<00:01:57.530> so<00:01:58.070> yes<00:01:58.310> you<00:01:58.490> have

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
and then you would also so yes you have

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.090 
and then you would also so yes you have
to<00:01:58.760> so<00:01:58.940> from<00:01:59.210> that<00:01:59.360> side<00:01:59.690> and<00:01:59.930> the<00:02:00.620> same<00:02:00.860> for

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
to so from that side and the same for

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.680 
to so from that side and the same for
this<00:02:01.250> as<00:02:01.520> well<00:02:01.730> but<00:02:02.030> it<00:02:02.180> supposed<00:02:02.510> to<00:02:02.600> look

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690 
this as well but it supposed to look

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:09.889 
this as well but it supposed to look
like<00:02:02.840> a<00:02:02.990> book<00:02:06.550> this

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.410 

what<00:02:10.110> is<00:02:10.229> that<00:02:10.470> this<00:02:11.009> is<00:02:11.220> a<00:02:11.420> cheerleading

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
what is that this is a cheerleading

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:20.180 
what is that this is a cheerleading
skirt<00:02:17.030> this<00:02:18.030> is<00:02:18.090> a<00:02:18.239> different<00:02:18.629> color<00:02:18.980> so<00:02:19.980> this

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
skirt this is a different color so this

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.920 
skirt this is a different color so this
side<00:02:20.459> has<00:02:20.610> to<00:02:20.760> come<00:02:20.940> any<00:02:21.180> word<00:02:21.390> and<00:02:21.569> this<00:02:21.720> side

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
side has to come any word and this side

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.809 
side has to come any word and this side
also<00:02:21.959> has<00:02:22.290> to<00:02:22.470> come<00:02:22.650> inward<00:02:22.860> so<00:02:23.519> what's<00:02:23.760> that

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
also has to come inward so what's that

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.600 
also has to come inward so what's that
extra<00:02:24.060> she<00:02:24.530> is<00:02:25.530> one<00:02:25.709> of<00:02:25.739> this<00:02:25.950> this<00:02:26.190> is<00:02:26.580> a

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
extra she is one of this this is a

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:32.930 
extra she is one of this this is a
different<00:02:27.060> color<00:02:27.239> on<00:02:27.950> this<00:02:31.459> and<00:02:32.459> you'll<00:02:32.700> see<00:02:32.910> a

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
different color on this and you'll see a

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:40.070 
different color on this and you'll see a
much<00:02:33.330> clearer<00:02:33.629> what<00:02:33.870> it's<00:02:34.019> done

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.670 

doesn't<00:02:41.080> really<00:02:41.530> pretty<00:02:41.800> right<00:02:42.070> now

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
doesn't really pretty right now

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.589 
doesn't really pretty right now
it<00:02:44.280> doesn't<00:02:44.819> look<00:02:44.939> really<00:02:45.120> pretty<00:02:45.359> right<00:02:45.540> now

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 
it doesn't look really pretty right now

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:46.970 
it doesn't look really pretty right now
so<00:02:45.870> it's<00:02:45.989> a<00:02:46.019> little<00:02:46.170> hard<00:02:46.379> and<00:02:46.530> plus<00:02:46.709> it's<00:02:46.890> a

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
so it's a little hard and plus it's a

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.470 
so it's a little hard and plus it's a
sample<00:02:47.219> like<00:02:47.519> if<00:02:47.670> it<00:02:47.790> was<00:02:47.909> a<00:02:47.939> really<00:02:48.180> different

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
sample like if it was a really different

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:49.970 
sample like if it was a really different
color<00:02:48.750> fabric<00:02:49.109> you<00:02:49.230> guys<00:02:49.379> would<00:02:49.560> see<00:02:49.739> it's<00:02:49.859> so

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
color fabric you guys would see it's so

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.140 
color fabric you guys would see it's so
much<00:02:50.159> clearer<00:02:52.069> I'm<00:02:53.069> going<00:02:53.250> to<00:02:53.310> do<00:02:53.400> my<00:02:53.549> best<00:02:53.730> so

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
much clearer I'm going to do my best so

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.000 
much clearer I'm going to do my best so
once<00:02:54.450> again<00:02:54.599> this<00:02:54.870> is<00:02:54.930> your<00:02:55.200> center<00:02:55.530> line<00:02:55.560> of

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
once again this is your center line of

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.899 
once again this is your center line of
your<00:02:56.730> colored<00:02:57.090> fabric<00:02:57.680> right<00:02:58.680> so<00:02:59.549> now<00:02:59.700> what<00:02:59.879> I

00:02:59.899 --> 00:02:59.909 
your colored fabric right so now what I

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:02.300 
your colored fabric right so now what I
want<00:03:00.150> to<00:03:00.209> do<00:03:00.389> is<00:03:00.599> this<00:03:01.290> wicked<00:03:01.590> pressed<00:03:01.920> and

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
want to do is this wicked pressed and

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.080 
want to do is this wicked pressed and
now<00:03:03.090> this<00:03:03.329> actually<00:03:03.780> comes<00:03:04.019> here

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
now this actually comes here

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.339 
now this actually comes here
remember<00:03:06.090> those<00:03:06.239> lines<00:03:06.480> we<00:03:06.659> created<00:03:07.049> inside

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:07.349 
remember those lines we created inside

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:09.830 
remember those lines we created inside
so<00:03:07.560> these<00:03:07.709> are<00:03:07.859> actually<00:03:08.219> fold<00:03:08.489> lines<00:03:08.760> and<00:03:09.540> now

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
so these are actually fold lines and now

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.349 
so these are actually fold lines and now
this<00:03:10.079> line<00:03:10.409> it<00:03:11.159> still<00:03:11.489> comes<00:03:11.760> to<00:03:11.819> the<00:03:11.969> center

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:12.359 
this line it still comes to the center

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:15.099 
this line it still comes to the center
and<00:03:12.569> this<00:03:13.200> line<00:03:13.409> still<00:03:13.769> comes<00:03:14.040> to<00:03:14.159> the<00:03:14.250> center

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:15.109 
and this line still comes to the center
