00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
crate 30 and I know that that's probably

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.790 
crate 30 and I know that that's probably
gonna<00:02:56.220> plummet<00:02:56.880> in<00:02:57.090> value<00:02:57.120> so<00:02:58.110> it's<00:02:58.410> you<00:02:58.530> know

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.150 
at the strange up so who knows maybe
they're<00:03:11.850> making<00:03:12.210> it<00:03:12.330> even<00:03:12.870> more<00:03:13.140> rare<00:03:13.740> in<00:03:13.980> the

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
they're making it even more rare in the

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.400 
they're making it even more rare in the
crates<00:03:14.490> because<00:03:15.210> everybody<00:03:15.840> i<00:03:15.930> know<00:03:16.050> that's

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
crates because everybody i know that's

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.560 
crates because everybody i know that's
open<00:03:16.740> up<00:03:16.830> multiple<00:03:17.310> create<00:03:17.550> 90s<00:03:17.940> they<00:03:18.390> get

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
open up multiple create 90s they get

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.590 
open up multiple create 90s they get
like<00:03:18.780> the<00:03:19.680> axe<00:03:19.920> or<00:03:20.340> a<00:03:20.370> bunch<00:03:20.640> of<00:03:20.820> like<00:03:21.180> winger

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
like the axe or a bunch of like winger

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.600 
like the axe or a bunch of like winger
strange<00:03:22.170> of<00:03:22.320> fires<00:03:22.500> or<00:03:22.830> Strange's<00:03:23.310> whatever

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
strange of fires or Strange's whatever

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.510 
strange of fires or Strange's whatever
and<00:03:24.170> hardly<00:03:25.170> anybody<00:03:25.470> is<00:03:25.650> getting<00:03:25.950> the<00:03:26.040> op<00:03:26.190> so

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.520 
and hardly anybody is getting the op so

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.820 
and hardly anybody is getting the op so
maybe<00:03:26.850> they<00:03:27.000> actually<00:03:27.420> put<00:03:28.020> that<00:03:28.230> down<00:03:28.500> to

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
maybe they actually put that down to

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.000 
maybe they actually put that down to
like<00:03:29.010> unusual<00:03:30.230> percentages<00:03:31.230> or<00:03:31.290> whatnot<00:03:31.650> so

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
like unusual percentages or whatnot so

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.940 
like unusual percentages or whatnot so
it's<00:03:32.430> even<00:03:32.730> harder<00:03:33.180> to<00:03:33.360> get<00:03:33.510> but<00:03:34.140> who<00:03:34.350> knows<00:03:34.530> i

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
it's even harder to get but who knows i

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.710 
it's even harder to get but who knows i
don't<00:03:35.040> know<00:03:35.250> i'm<00:03:35.550> just<00:03:35.820> making<00:03:36.090> this<00:03:36.180> video<00:03:36.330> to

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720
