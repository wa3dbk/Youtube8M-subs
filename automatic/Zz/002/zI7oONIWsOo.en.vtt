00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.210
 Hello guys 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.759
 we created this alert with the objective of 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.219
 show absurd situations that we are 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.529
 receiving in our company that which 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.560
 these practices and we want to show only 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.340
 we can conclude that they are companies 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.699
 dance distributors 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.170
 look well when we get cases to 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.779
 data recovery 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.630
 some customers always say 'please' 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.320
 retrieve the data because there is my 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.050
 life 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.210
 now see what happens when you 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.430
 ends up sending your life to your disk 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.770
 for these companies 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.530
 first case you send to the 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.660
 recovery does not approve the budget knows 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.030
 what happens 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.899
 simply the company returns your HD 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:52.590
 totally disassembled 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.960
 This is absurd if the company 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.960
 returned the hd without the 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:01.350
 and the customer does not even know his 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.270
 it is really his third case 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.070
 that the company that manipulated hard drive 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.549
 performed the procedure completely 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.770
 without the use of the clean room and very 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:14.040
 less than special gloves 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:17.070
 see the fingerprints on the magnetic plate and 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:20.189
 even when the client is in the budget 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.770
 they simply damage the dish 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.330
 magnetic personal now before 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.759
 to choose a recovery company from 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.310
 data to enter the site and 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.710
 view some photos of the lab 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.299
 and especially if the company has some 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.329
 photo that indicates that they have a 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.189
 room clean classes have because that is the 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.320
 only correct location to open in the 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:43.170
 hard disk for handling dishes 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.869
 reading heads before 7 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.909
 so the staff if you enter the site 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.479
 company and can not find a 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:53.000
 Proper infrastructure does not send your HD 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:58.159
 in no case 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.159
 careful with the data distributor
