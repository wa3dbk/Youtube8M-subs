00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
to solve this problem of those kids we

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.660 
to solve this problem of those kids we
know<00:01:15.420> so<00:01:16.229> is<00:01:16.290> it<00:01:16.439> maybe<00:01:16.650> you've<00:01:17.369> got<00:01:17.520> these

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
know so is it maybe you've got these

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.280 
know so is it maybe you've got these
laser<00:01:18.119> beam<00:01:18.450> fingers<00:01:18.900> maybe<00:01:19.080> we<00:01:19.170> could

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
laser beam fingers maybe we could

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.410 
laser beam fingers maybe we could
reflect<00:01:19.590> them<00:01:19.890> back<00:01:20.040> oh<00:01:20.280> yes<00:01:21.000> said<00:01:21.360> the

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
reflect them back oh yes said the

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.249 
reflect them back oh yes said the
children<00:01:21.630> so<00:01:22.970> how<00:01:23.970> are<00:01:24.090> we<00:01:24.180> going<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.630> do<00:01:25.080> that

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
children so how are we going to do that

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.020 
children so how are we going to do that
eventually<00:01:26.009> Zoey<00:01:26.400> says<00:01:26.610> with<00:01:26.820> some

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
eventually Zoey says with some

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.359 
eventually Zoey says with some
reflective<00:01:27.600> material<00:01:28.170> like<00:01:28.380> broke<00:01:29.070> a<00:01:29.100> window

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
reflective material like broke a window

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.219 
reflective material like broke a window
or<00:01:29.700> something<00:01:29.820> I<00:01:30.150> said<00:01:30.630> no<00:01:30.960> you<00:01:31.020> need

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
or something I said no you need

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.380 
or something I said no you need
something<00:01:31.590> maybe<00:01:31.799> about<00:01:31.950> that<00:01:32.369> size<00:01:32.759> you<00:01:33.270> know

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
something maybe about that size you know

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.569 
something maybe about that size you know
that<00:01:33.540> reflects<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:34.470> where<00:01:35.159> could<00:01:35.280> we<00:01:35.400> get

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
that reflects and where could we get

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.550 
that reflects and where could we get
something<00:01:35.790> like<00:01:36.060> that<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:36.450> so<00:01:37.079> I<00:01:37.110> had<00:01:37.350> very

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
something like that and so I had very

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.120 
something like that and so I had very
suggested<00:01:38.100> try<00:01:38.340> eBay<00:01:38.880> or<00:01:39.210> Amazon<00:01:39.979> oh<00:01:40.979> you've

the<00:06:34.150> head<00:06:34.330> is<00:06:34.480> kind<00:06:34.660> of<00:06:34.810> squished<00:06:35.110> a<00:06:35.260> bit<00:06:35.440> and

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:35.710 
the head is kind of squished a bit and

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:39.360 
the head is kind of squished a bit and
then<00:06:35.830> kinda<00:06:36.100> makes<00:06:36.280> her<00:06:36.460> a<00:06:36.520> bit<00:06:36.760> older<00:06:38.370> and

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:39.370 
then kinda makes her a bit older and

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:40.830 
then kinda makes her a bit older and
something<00:06:39.970> I<00:06:40.060> kind<00:06:40.300> of<00:06:40.330> work<00:06:40.480> out<00:06:40.690> there's

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:40.840 
something I kind of work out there's

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:42.690 
something I kind of work out there's
something<00:06:41.020> similar<00:06:41.920> here<00:06:42.100> but<00:06:42.310> very<00:06:42.550> very

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:42.700 
something similar here but very very

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:44.400 
something similar here but very very
different<00:06:43.240> again<00:06:43.840> I<00:06:43.900> think<00:06:44.050> it's<00:06:44.260> because

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:44.410 
different again I think it's because

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:46.140 
different again I think it's because
she's<00:06:44.560> got<00:06:44.710> very<00:06:44.980> small<00:06:45.100> glasses<00:06:45.910> and<00:06:46.030> she's

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:46.150 
she's got very small glasses and she's

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:47.820 
she's got very small glasses and she's
got<00:06:46.330> quite<00:06:46.540> big<00:06:46.750> ones<00:06:46.960> but<00:06:47.200> they're<00:06:47.410> kind<00:06:47.680> of

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:47.830 
got quite big ones but they're kind of

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:50.430 
got quite big ones but they're kind of
similar<00:06:48.420> but<00:06:49.420> it<00:06:49.540> makes<00:06:49.720> them<00:06:49.870> look<00:06:49.990> so<00:06:50.050> very

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:50.440
