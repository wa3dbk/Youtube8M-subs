 pay attention and you see that we are not 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.320

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.580
 good results 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.379
 Be careful what you are looking for is very difficult 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.000
 explain our search history 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:09.709
 of the internet is special when you're 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.420
 investigating a topic and found by 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:13.760
 chance pages that do not mean 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.379
 nothing separately but together they are a 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.480
 explosion something similar happened to 

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:19.700
 Catalan michelle or a writer of the 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.650
 mediums magazine that counted in a series 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.450
 of articles like a morning woke up to 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.849
 a group of armed men who 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.470
 interrogated her husband searched her house and 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:28.970
 almost what was 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.980
 past is that the husband of michelle 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.569
 he used his google chrome account so much 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.299
 in the office at home on the one hand 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:37.280
 Miller looked at home pressure cookers one 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:38.930
 pretty common kitchen element for the 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.430
 another her husband investigated what was the 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.620
 best backpack to take from 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.569
 camp and finally the son of the 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.400
 two read about the recent bombing of 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:48.260
 boston that happened to be made with 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.150
 improvised pumps in pressure cookers 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.459
 that the culprits arrived in backpacks 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:54.530
 very resistant the police added two more 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:56.810
 two and convinced that they would find 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:59.030
 a terrorist sent a command group that 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.210
 he had to apologize to all 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.790
 possible languages 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:05.860
 and dale dale with the living dead between 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.480
 seas of rumors and goings and turns 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.700
 continue 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.320
 geimer creative director of dead island 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.630
 announced that it is very difficult for the 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:15.340
 franchise come to an end just in this 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.470
 instance beyond that dead island 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.060
 rival has not been a resounding success in 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.920
 Jaime answered this question in a 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.960
 question and answer session Network 

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:25.030
 and I clarify it with a smiley emoticon 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.379
 smiling and against that you can not 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:29.419
 argue 

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:30.979
 nintendo nac &amp; pop a campaign is 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:32.569
 traveling the internet to get that 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:34.699
 the nintendo consoles stop being 

00:04:32.569 --> 00:04:36.169
 restricted by region is to say that 

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:38.180
 they can use games from any area 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:40.460
 on any machine already achieved more than 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.949
 17,000 adepts or signatures and they hope to arrive 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.599
 at 25 thousand however he got stuck iwata 

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:46.849
 president of the company gave the 

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:48.349
 reasons for this decision explaining that 

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:50.389
 they sell their products throughout the 

00:04:48.349 --> 00:04:51.860
 world adapting them to each territory and 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:54.110
 it is precisely that work 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:56.210
 individualized what makes them have 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:58.789
 that close or block your machines between 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:00.229
 regions according to iwata there are several types of 

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:02.120
 these regions around the world and every 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:04.279
 one has its legal restrictions and 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.139
 even cultural acceptances maybe what 

00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:08.840
 more important besides systems 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:10.699
 different descatalogación by ages 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.529
 each region asks to make certain 

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:14.569
 restrictions and guardians expects 

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:16.009
 fans of video games can understand 

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:18.229
 that the industry does not do this for its 

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:19.789
 own ego but the sound of the people 

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:22.620
 signing the petition may have arrived 

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:25.260
 to cover his explanation 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:27.720
 also in the most viewed even though 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:29.940
 google sells itself as the most futuristic and 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:31.380
 smart of modern companies huge 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:33.120
 Most of your income comes from the 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:35.070
 most classic source of all medium the 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:37.050
 old and dear advertising that in these 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:39.360
 times of elections threatened to return 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:41.490
 crazy to more than one on youtube and any 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.320
 page that uses adsense and advertising 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:44.790
 it's not going to disappear is because the google 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.680
 it was announced that invade one of the 

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:48.570
 most loved services cartography 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.040
 virtual google maps the company already 

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:52.139
 is testing the ads in the version 

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:53.790
 of iphone and android service and 

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:55.860
 although it's not as annoying as the channel 

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:57.630
 video is equally prone to confusion 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:59.520
 if you want to find a restaurant in your 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:01.080
 zone the first search result 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:03.389
 it's going to be promoted and it's not going to be 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:05.160
 necessarily the best and most popular nor 

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:06.990
 the closest the same happens when you 

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:08.490
 does the google search but in this 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:10.320
 case the results of payments are more 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:12.630
 easy to ignore because of its yellow edge 

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:14.910
 and different typeface in google maps 

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:18.120
 for now there is only one marquita almost 

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:20.820
 imperceptible that says ads 

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:23.520
 the important thing is to share shuhei 

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:24.900
 yoshida president of worldwide studios 

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:27.330
 claimed that playstation players 

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:29.490
 4 will not need an account of plus is 

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:31.199
 say a paid membership to be able to 

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:32.490
 share your gameplay videos or 

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:34.160
 screenshots 

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:37.080
 unlike the software that is 

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:39.540
 users of xbox live gold will require 

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:41.310
 of small 4 can share their 

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:43.199
 favorite moments without paying but not with 

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:45.030
 total freedom will be the programmers 

00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:46.949
 of each game who decide what 

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:49.350
 fragments can be shared for 

00:06:46.949 --> 00:06:52.020
 avoid spoilers or unveil secrets 

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:53.100
 of the massive games and cautious elmer 

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:56.520
 it's worth two 

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:58.830
 mandata in www.dgt.es and Wednesday at 

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:01.100
 23 in Madrid the nerds here in border and 

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:04.229
 only in connection with vorterix dotcom 

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:08.900
 the misfits inherit a land and 

00:07:04.229 --> 00:07:08.900
 for that they need to be informed
