I<00:03:05.160> bet<00:03:06.160> you<00:03:06.250> this<00:03:06.370> comes<00:03:06.610> out<00:03:06.849> right<00:03:07.690> here<00:03:07.930> yep

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
I bet you this comes out right here yep

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.220 
I bet you this comes out right here yep
now<00:03:09.489> where<00:03:09.819> was<00:03:09.940> that<00:03:09.970> mirror<00:03:10.480> guess<00:03:10.870> I<00:03:10.989> must

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
now where was that mirror guess I must

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.580 
now where was that mirror guess I must
press<00:03:11.530> on<00:03:11.680> there<00:03:12.069> it<00:03:12.160> is<00:03:12.540> so<00:03:13.540> I<00:03:13.930> think<00:03:14.140> this<00:03:14.379> is

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
press on there it is so I think this is

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.050 
press on there it is so I think this is
different<00:03:15.040> than<00:03:15.099> the<00:03:15.160> original<00:03:15.640> game<00:03:15.670> because

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
different than the original game because

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.460 
different than the original game because
in<00:03:16.180> the<00:03:16.239> original<00:03:16.569> game<00:03:16.750> in<00:03:16.870> order<00:03:17.080> to<00:03:17.170> proceed

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
in the original game in order to proceed

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.259 
in the original game in order to proceed
in<00:03:17.650> this<00:03:17.739> stage<00:03:18.010> you<00:03:18.040> had<00:03:18.370> to<00:03:18.489> get<00:03:18.640> a<00:03:18.790> jam<00:03:19.239> or

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
in this stage you had to get a jam or

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:21.509 
in this stage you had to get a jam or
something<00:03:19.450> from<00:03:19.989> another<00:03:20.050> stage<00:03:20.739> and<00:03:21.099> then

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 
something from another stage and then

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:23.220 
something from another stage and then
come<00:03:21.700> back<00:03:21.730> here<00:03:22.239> but<00:03:22.390> I<00:03:22.450> think<00:03:22.510> they<00:03:22.720> changed

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
come back here but I think they changed

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:28.220 
come back here but I think they changed
it<00:03:23.410> I'm<00:03:23.530> not<00:03:23.650> sure<00:03:23.709> that<00:03:24.190> let's<00:03:24.370> find<00:03:24.519> out
