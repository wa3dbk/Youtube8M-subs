00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.630
 Hi guys 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.570
 welcome back to this latest episode 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.400
 of the blog dog fucking of furlo 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.380
 surely you are wondering why 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.480
 you are people with the spirit of 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.359
 particularly acute observation 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.039
 because there is this background is because I have one 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.430
 pipe in my left hand 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:35.850
 and because I'm dressed in sherlock holmes 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.100
 the answer is very simple I was bored 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.020
 I had to do this blog but I could n't 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.510
 to find reasons beyond 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.829
 your beautiful company and therefore me 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.629
 I'm called fuck 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.079
 we open the wardrobe and see what it is 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.579
 I find in particular why how you 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.399
 you will notice it is not the location 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:56.070
 usual in which I find myself I am 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.559
 moved I traveled I changed him 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.760
 city and this brought me 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:02.550
 to the topic I would like to discuss 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:06.659
 with you today or video games 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.549
 for mobile where the mobile does not 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.020
 necessarily refers to the market 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.020
 of portable consoles 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:18.740
 indeed I static for furniture mean 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:23.369
 video games that are played with tablets 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:25.520
 smartphone and what else and mp3 player mi 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.869
 I clearly refer to the iPhone 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:31.200
 actually all the gamers 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:34.740
 most hardened tend to rage 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.409
 especially against this market here 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.049
 you always go to the catone mode 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:43.110
 the old men regret their regrets 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:45.600
 times to play a game of 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.880
 video game meant to sit on 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.649
 sofa perhaps with a joypad in hand 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.810
 play or stand in front of a 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.570
 computer 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.270
 to make games like christ commands 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:59.000
 as many say 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:01.780
 Well I'll do the opposite bastian today 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.869
 I just want to emphasize a point 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:09.739
 in this we say diatribe that sees i 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:13.400
 raw and tough gamers naked or hard 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:15.590
 and pure against the so-called casual gamers 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.230
 as you know it even goes down 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:21.950
 become an insult in many communities on 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:26.510
 internet in fines board and in many forums 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:30.799
 Well guys what was the prospect indeed 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:34.100
 What he has served up the past 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:38.470
 past was also made of a 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:43.010
 mobile market represented however by 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:46.040
 of the tools that represent it 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.920
 just the death of the soul and in my opinion 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:53.019
 even the games know what I'm doing 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:57.320
 referring I am referring to the tiger 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:59.720
 fuck the tiger sucked and 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:02.930
 it was they who represented the 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.340
 mobile market at the time the tiger ones 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.769
 fucking games they did 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.900
 practically two tones only that 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:10.819
 they cost something like 15 thousand lire a 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:14.950
 time if I don't remember transposes the cloth 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:18.079
 practically in 15 euros now so 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:21.560
 imagine these little objects 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:23.660
 roughly more or less like that with five keys 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.840
 on the cross they didn't even have gods 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:29.180
 pixels they simply could not have been 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:32.709
 of the liquid crystal displays are 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:35.780
 I remember badly with lights that are 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:39.440
 they turned on depending on which key 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:40.860
 press you now look for what the fuck was a 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.500
 tiger 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:46.170
 moral of the story dear friends because 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:51.420
 I don't want to take it too long 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:54.300
 yes ok I realize that in front of gods 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:57.500
 games whose depths come from 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:04:01.050
 excellent levels like half life 2 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:03.810
 portal or any other is yours 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:09.410
 favorite game had it happened on 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:14.420
 console and computer compared to games 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:18.359
 on mobile platforms 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:21.630
 well certainly the comparison between these two 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:24.720
 universes is quite ugly though of which 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:27.180
 to make it a mess 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:30.720
 it doesn't seem to me so much the case also because 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:32.790
 hand up who has a smartphone not 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:36.240
 disdains the classic mini-match 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:39.810
 access to the game that is more fashionable or 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:42.510
 to the game for the twins that we leave 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:45.870
 play well 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:49.620
 at this point I do something from 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:52.530
 sherlock holmes ie type I take a a 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:56.540
 Gianni book I put the pipe in my mouth 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:56.540
 I take a book 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:05.860
 let's think about the next one
