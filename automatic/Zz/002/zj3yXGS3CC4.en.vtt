 hello everyone I'm being 15 750 and now I'm going to show you how to download the 

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:07.999
 pokÃ©mon black a little translated into Spanish 

00:00:07.999 --> 00:00:11.629
 besides that I will teach you how to solve some problems something 

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:16.029
 simple in emulation sometimes we'll say goodbye to that fucking smu me 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:17.820
 always go slow 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.470
 we started 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.199
 problem of the blue screen bitch 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.960
 That fucking problem always fucks you 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.470
 there is a solution that is to use exon replays that I will leave them in the 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.429
 Description with name blush crime fix 

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:33.360
 storage problem 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.230
 when we want to keep our fucking game a damn message appears in 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.000
 Japanese that says it could not be saved 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.330
 it is solved using two made a challenge country that I will leave them in the 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:47.100
 description of the video with the name games lacras ficci sabe fix then 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.420
 reboots and you can save normally while you leave these two activated to 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.580
 save 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.480
 loading problem 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.330
 when we closed and then opened again he did not hunt number and we used the 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.870
 blue screen code only our heading does not appear for 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.820
 solve it you have to activate all three codes at the same time and restart 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.850
 emulator and it will appear as if by magic 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.960
 problem of shadows 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.409
 they say they are annoying but for some they are simple problem the truth 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:17.760
 this is not mandatory but if you want to do it 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.760
 there are two ways 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.950
 do not change the 3d render eren cnooc options your zoom was open gl but maybe 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.610
 have a graphic problem like this 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.020
 I did a screenshot showing where is the 3d render eriel open gl then 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.440

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.190
 use the warrant and play that I will leave in the description of the video with the name 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:38.740

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.980
 problem of experience 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:44.870
 the most well-known problem of all is solved activating etxea that is in 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:48.940
 the emulator wings proia mado disable is not paco using elche calls 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.410
 disable is not peace that will be in the description of the video but it is more 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.710
 I recommend using the wings pro to avoid a ride for now I do not know 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.480
 more emulation problems the link of the emulator in addition to the pokÃ©mon black

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.479
