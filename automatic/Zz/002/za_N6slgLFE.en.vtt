00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.870
 we make a rhythm for it 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:13.130
 we need astgabel just from the 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:19.920
 garden brought trimmed 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:21.840
 Then we need beer lids ten pieces 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:26.420
 if you want you can still do that 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:30.840
 others did not do it now 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:33.980
 Human collects a lot of needs 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:38.820
 you punch a can 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:46.710
 With that you just do it in the middle 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:49.399
 a hole that makes you with the 10 6 2 4 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.399
 6 8 10 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:01:05.360
 as I said the astgabel as well as cut 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:09.439
 a piece am with the wire puller 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:15.799
 then you can ever have a string 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:20.750
 it must last longer 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:20.750
 we offer it first and then cut 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:36.650
 turn these props together 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:02:08.440
 then leave my longer piece of the 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:12.480
 Cover the wire so we plug it in 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:18.930
 We are stuck in front and the other way 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.930
 so that they are so opposite 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:57.450
 We make the rest the other side 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.650
 made of pure from a fork
