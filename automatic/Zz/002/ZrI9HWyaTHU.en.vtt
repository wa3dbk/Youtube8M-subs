is not the best way to measure fitness
at<00:00:11.730> all<00:00:11.940> what's<00:00:12.389> the<00:00:12.480> gap<00:00:12.690> freely<00:00:13.070> we<00:00:14.070> weren't

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
at all what's the gap freely we weren't

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.160 
at all what's the gap freely we weren't
talking<00:00:14.580> about<00:00:14.790> they<00:00:14.940> show<00:00:15.780> us<00:00:15.870> again

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
the gap is could you fit together hand

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:22.910 
the gap is could you fit together hand
goes<00:00:21.539> straight<00:00:21.840> up<00:00:21.900> straight<00:00:22.529> up<00:00:22.650> and<00:00:22.859> down

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
like that so someone said we used to

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.410 
like that so someone said we used to
dance<00:00:26.400> to<00:00:26.580> measurement<00:00:26.939> of<00:00:27.000> fitness<00:00:27.269> there's

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
dance to measurement of fitness there's

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.759 
dance to measurement of fitness there's
no<00:00:27.539> measure<00:00:27.779> if<00:00:27.900> it's<00:00:28.109> a<00:00:28.140> measure<00:00:28.320> of<00:00:28.410> fitness

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
no measure if it's a measure of fitness

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.700 
no measure if it's a measure of fitness
