00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
there so I get spawned on this head in

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.260 
there so I get spawned on this head in
the<00:00:56.129> map<00:00:56.309> because<00:00:56.579> that's<00:00:56.789> where<00:00:57.030> all<00:00:57.239> the

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
the map because that's where all the

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.349 
the map because that's where all the
action<00:00:57.539> is<00:00:57.899> happening<00:00:58.109> so<00:00:59.070> I<00:00:59.430> sometimes<00:01:00.149> do

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
action is happening so I sometimes do

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.790

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
that when I'm fed up with the game I

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.529 
that when I'm fed up with the game I
just<00:01:01.980> kill<00:01:02.190> myself<00:01:02.370> to<00:01:02.789> get<00:01:02.879> a<00:01:02.940> better<00:01:03.090> spawn

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
just kill myself to get a better spawn

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.270 
just kill myself to get a better spawn
um<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.850> so<00:01:05.850> back<00:01:06.630> in<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.840> story<00:01:07.080> it<00:01:07.650> was<00:01:08.010> in

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
um and so back in the story it was in

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.920 
um and so back in the story it was in
second<00:01:08.640> grade<00:01:08.670> this<00:01:09.060> might<00:01:09.240> be<00:01:09.360> later<00:01:09.630> than

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930

second grade this might be later than
some<00:01:10.200> of<00:01:10.290> you<00:01:10.439> most<00:01:10.710> of<00:01:10.920> you<00:01:11.040> might<00:01:11.220> have<00:01:11.340> been

classroom you're in a pretty bad

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:38.060 
classroom you're in a pretty bad
situation<00:07:35.970> the<00:07:36.900> best<00:07:37.080> idea<00:07:37.410> is<00:07:37.590> just<00:07:37.740> to<00:07:37.860> get

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:38.070 
situation the best idea is just to get

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:40.909 
situation the best idea is just to get
up<00:07:38.220> and<00:07:38.430> get<00:07:38.880> out<00:07:38.940> of<00:07:39.090> the<00:07:39.570> classroom<00:07:39.919> because

00:07:40.909 --> 00:07:40.919 
up and get out of the classroom because

00:07:40.919 --> 00:07:43.279 
up and get out of the classroom because
more<00:07:41.850> than<00:07:41.880> likely<00:07:42.060> people<00:07:42.570> are<00:07:42.780> gonna<00:07:42.870> smell

00:07:43.279 --> 00:07:43.289 
more than likely people are gonna smell

00:07:43.289 --> 00:07:46.100 
more than likely people are gonna smell
it<00:07:43.500> but<00:07:44.460> they're<00:07:44.699> less<00:07:44.970> likely<00:07:45.000> to<00:07:45.570> correlate

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:46.110 
it but they're less likely to correlate
