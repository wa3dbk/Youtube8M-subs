00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.840
 hello dear tankers 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:13.080
 when the Americans entered the second 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.940
 World War was considered that caliber 75 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.049
 millimeters is enough to fight 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.279
 German tanks 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.660
 but by the end of the year 42 it turned out that 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:24.330
 armor penetration of such guns still 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.849
 not enough and the weapons committee launched 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.980
 process of introduction into the army 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:29.660
 anti-tank guns with caliber 90 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.170
 millimeters 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:37.200
 m36 jackson became such a machine 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.450
 April 44 and began to deliver in 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.120
 the army in just the years of the war was released 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.670
 over two thousand such machines of different 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.219
 modifications by itself we could not 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.489
 get around it then constructed a tree 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:53.280
 American pt see what we have 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.410
 turned out for strength jackson not 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.250
 inferior to its fellow similar 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:01.050
 level 590 hit points allow at 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.239
 imperative to join 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.000
 open duel not only spt opponent 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.700
 but with medium tanks it helps 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.549
 and a rotating tower but not worth it 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.159
 to get involved in such duels after all 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.830
 rather than a heavy side and back tank 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.060
 booked unfortunately very weak and 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.790
 can be pierced 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:24.240
 even by landmines frontal armor rates 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:27.509
 principle not bad for Fri-Sau level 6 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.400
 but there is one caveat that may seem 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.400
 booking a forehead case with her 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.520
 Much better than towers 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.479
 114 mm versus 76 but on the case 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.549
 such protection 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.560
 has only transmission cover 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.899
 block and mask gun covers 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.360
 virtually the entire forehead of the tower and quite 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.280
 not bad keep hitting true hit 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.369
 kind of fraught with damage 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:53.820
 tools and boeukladki Jackson very 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.530
 A good overview for pt 370 meters that 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.619
 let and shoot not only by 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.790
 a stranger's light but also in his own way 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:02.790
 rotating tower helps not to lose 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:05.100
 disguise when maintaining or changing targets 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.409
 which quite redeems not very fat 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.860
 armor on the tower radio station us 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:12.890
 got one of the best on our level 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.350
 communication radius of 615 meters is quite 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.540
 enough for comfortable combat 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:20.840
 Especially since the mobility of Jackson 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.470
 noticeably inferior to the neighbor in the m18 tree 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.020
 hellcat 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.210
 it is enough to take in 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.430
 the beginning of the battle advantageous position may 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:30.950
 enough to leap to base defense or 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.730
 artillery but constantly run from the flank 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.000
 on the flank and 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.920
 from 1 lines to the rear you can not jackson 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.870
 satisfied high what is also not 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.260
 promotes frequent jogging across the field 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:44.959
 battlefield but the high tower allows you to lead 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.360
 fire because of the low stones from the rubble to 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:49.100
 Unfortunately, the corners of the vertical alignment are not 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.650
 allow you to shoot from behind the hills 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.630
 Jackson's top gun has an average 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.890
 damage and armor penetration options 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.550
 among his colleagues 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.670
 equal to the level of 160 millimeters 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.130
 armor penetration 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:04.700
 very good figure for the sixth 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:07.310
 level a 240 damage sensitive 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.230
 for anyone the accuracy of this gun 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:12.020
 enough for shooting with 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:14.360
 comfortable distance of 300 350 meters 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:16.519
 and quick mixing and rate of fire 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.310
 allow you to safely carry the fire with 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:21.830
 flank to flank best m36 jackson 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.049
 feels on the second third line 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:26.570
 behind tt attackers 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:29.180
 or st allies but disguised or 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:31.430
 at least the closed position from which she 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.030
 can fire without fear for their 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.070
 health 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.590
 now that we know the strong and the weak 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:39.380
 Jackson side think about what modules 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.400
 we are best suited so we have 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.980
 good review 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.610
 high accuracy and rate of fire but 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.760
 weak armor and medium mobility 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.070
 Consequently 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.830
 the most advantageous tactic for us will be 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:54.019
 take a comfortable position and shoot 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:56.420
 all who try to get us out of there 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:58.910
 the ideal option for such a game would be 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:01.250
 the next set of gun modules 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:04.250
 Medium gauge rammer will allow us 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:06.079
 shoot a little more often the stereo tube will give 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.540
 the opportunity to see the enemy earlier and 

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:11.120
 earlier open fire camouflage net 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.470
 make it harder to detect so for us 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.980
 will start shooting later 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:15.989
 such modules 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.530
 either come in handy and why are we from them 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:20.549
 refuse reinforced aiming drives 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.760
 reduce aiming time 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:25.320
 but she is in Jackson and so small 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:27.120
 branched optics gives less 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:30.000
 review gain than stereo tube 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:32.490
 but to move a lot is bad for us as follows 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.690
 increment jackson will be the choice 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.910
 crew perks 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.750
 in order to maximize 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.350
 overview 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:41.910
 we take the eagle eye to the commander and 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:43.919
 radio interceptor and inventor radio operator 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:46.949
 to be noticed as late as possible 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:48.870
 the crew must learn disguise to 

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:51.360
 don't miss the moment when noticed and 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.960
 need to flee commander need sixth 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.760
 feeling 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.440
 if we want more efficiently 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:58.560
 damage enemy equipment modules 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.430
 the sniper gunner will also help us 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.729
 will be helpful 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:04.680
 smooth turn of the gunnerâ€™s tower and 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:07.199
 virtuoso mechanic and to 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:10.560
 quickly get to the desired position can be 

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:12.690
 take the king off-road skills too 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:15.500
 loader most useful desperate 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:17.490
 also useless contact ammunition 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.620
 what can I advise 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:21.690
 Jackson driver to 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:24.450
 make the most of its merits 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:25.169
 you need to know the cards at the beginning of the battle 

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:27.300
 select 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:30.000
 masked position allowing 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:32.820
 block one and better two directions 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.770
 possible enemy attack classic 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:37.620
 example alley on prokhorovka 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:39.870
 if you get up in the bushes from the inside 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:42.270
 side of the road you can cover fire 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:44.490
 those who go on shooting at 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:46.889
 enemy tanks scout them a field and 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:48.810
 if necessary, protect the base from 

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:51.630
 crossing the railway 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:53.310
 try not to shoot your offhand 

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:55.979
 the gun allows you to target vulnerable 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:59.010
 enemy points eg turret 

00:05:55.979 --> 00:05:59.849
 radio operator on apt-5 or shoot under the tower 

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:02.639
 square-2 

00:05:59.849 --> 00:06:03.060
 if you need to transfer fire to another 

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:05.310
 target 

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:07.349
 try not to turn the case 

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:09.810
 of course it's faster but go out 

00:06:07.349 --> 00:06:11.820
 masking the car and you still need to 

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:14.820
 in the face try as much as possible 

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:17.099
 don't shoot your head in the forehead with horns 

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:19.770
 First, your forehead will most likely be 

00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:21.000
 thinner second artillery loves 

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:24.040
 standing pt 

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.260
 Beware of light and medium tanks in 

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:27.820
 messi that even that armor which you have 

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:31.150
 there is only the front 

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:33.220
 measure their ability to not 

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:36.220
 try to punch in the forehead of 3 

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:38.140
 it's too complicated but you are fine 

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:40.510
 can punch him in board or knock down 

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:42.820
 caterpillars substituting for artillery and 

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:45.340
 Last track 

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:47.110
 minimap your dynamics will allow 

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:49.570
 you leave with the direction of where it becomes 

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:51.460
 too hot or move to where 

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:53.830
 your allies need help 

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:56.590
 for example, you should not stand to the last 

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:58.660
 on the crest of el hulluf 

00:06:56.590 --> 00:07:00.910
 moved into enemy territory and 

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:02.770
 all enemies hid behind the rocks you 

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:06.220
 you can go round them well 

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:08.680
 shoot jackson beautiful car not 

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:11.290
 requiring any sophisticated skills 

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:13.990
 and forgiving the player many mistakes 

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:15.910
 play it nice and pleasant it 

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:18.250
 a great option for a beginner 

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:20.530
 and we all sincerely hope that 

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:25.080
 helped you and look forward to your feedback on gas 

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:25.080
 on the world forum of tanks to new meetings
