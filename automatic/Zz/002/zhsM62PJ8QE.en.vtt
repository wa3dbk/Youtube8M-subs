he<00:05:26.680> buys<00:05:26.919> a<00:05:27.360> pretty<00:05:28.360> strong<00:05:28.600> shield<00:05:28.930> and<00:05:29.169> just

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:29.320 
he buys a pretty strong shield and just

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:30.960 
he buys a pretty strong shield and just
hides<00:05:29.500> behind<00:05:29.740> that<00:05:29.919> which<00:05:30.310> is<00:05:30.460> something<00:05:30.729> I

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:30.970 
hides behind that which is something I

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:33.529 
hides behind that which is something I
don't<00:05:31.030> like<00:05:31.330> that<00:05:31.840> it's<00:05:32.110> an<00:05:32.380> multiplayer<00:05:33.010> I

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:33.539 
don't like that it's an multiplayer I

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:35.850 
don't like that it's an multiplayer I
mean<00:05:34.539> the<00:05:34.660> knight<00:05:34.810> has<00:05:35.050> plenty<00:05:35.470> of<00:05:35.500> advantages

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:35.860 
mean the knight has plenty of advantages

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.080 
mean the knight has plenty of advantages
already<00:05:36.720> might<00:05:37.720> as<00:05:37.810> well<00:05:37.930> not<00:05:38.139> add<00:05:38.320> that<00:05:38.350> I

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:39.090 
already might as well not add that I

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:41.700 
already might as well not add that I
guess<00:05:40.090> it's<00:05:40.300> good<00:05:40.479> for<00:05:40.690> like<00:05:40.720> fast<00:05:41.289> enemies

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:41.710 
guess it's good for like fast enemies

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:43.980 
guess it's good for like fast enemies
like<00:05:41.830> the<00:05:41.950> god<00:05:42.099> king<00:05:42.400> but<00:05:42.750> starts<00:05:43.750> hiding

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:43.990 
like the god king but starts hiding

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:47.700 
like the god king but starts hiding
behind<00:05:44.080> his<00:05:44.260> shield<00:05:44.530> and<00:05:46.349> no<00:05:47.349> more<00:05:47.530> chat

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:47.710
