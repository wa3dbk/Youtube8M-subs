00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
memory card in the device so what you

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.019 
memory card in the device so what you
need<00:00:21.779> to<00:00:21.840> do<00:00:21.960> is<00:00:22.170> that<00:00:22.470> we<00:00:23.460> have<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:23.670> end<00:00:23.850> end

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
need to do is that we have the end end

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
with the micro SD card and as you can

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.980 
with the micro SD card and as you can
see<00:01:08.159> how<00:01:08.400> about<00:01:09.650> sensing<00:01:10.650> micro<00:01:10.890> SD<00:01:11.100> card<00:01:11.990> so

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
see how about sensing micro SD card so

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.899 
see how about sensing micro SD card so
when<00:01:13.140> you<00:01:13.290> have<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.439> click<00:01:13.770> that<00:01:14.159> means<00:01:14.369> both<00:01:14.880> of

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
these cards are inserted so now you can

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:24.320 
these cards are inserted so now you can
just<00:01:18.450> simply<00:01:22.040> put<00:01:23.040> it<00:01:23.189> back<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:23.729> you<00:01:24.119> need<00:01:24.210> to

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:50.079 
transfer media to SD card act that means

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:54.330 
transfer media to SD card act that means
it<00:01:50.880> recognized<00:01:51.880> or<00:01:52.090> SD<00:01:52.420> card<00:01:52.630> and<00:01:52.810> SIM<00:01:53.049> card<00:01:53.340> so

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
it recognized or SD card and SIM card so

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.999 
it recognized or SD card and SIM card so
that<00:01:55.149> we<00:01:55.390> need<00:01:55.539> for<00:01:55.750> this<00:01:55.869> video<00:01:56.170> again<00:01:56.560> I<00:01:56.770> hope
