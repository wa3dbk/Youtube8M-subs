00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.730
 hello such good afternoon I am 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:15.660
 movement and the theme of today is 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:21.080
 news reporters always have 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.080
 problems ahead 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:31.830
 when we get to Carlos, you never hear 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:35.510
 we have a bit of technical problems and 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.510
 We returned with Carlos in a little while 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.010
 not my favorite is the reporter who 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.290
 misinformed is always wrong 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.660
 Carlos we have the information of how many 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.560
 injured there 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:49.690
 because there are several are several between 66 and 22 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:52.570
 and how high was the derailment 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:55.629
 of the train because it was like flush with the floor 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.850
 for good floor flush well more or less 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:00.309
 a little bit higher because this is the 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.170
 way and the little bit louder and 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:05.080
 just in the framework of a very 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:07.960
 important carlos which which will be

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.710
 can give the note because all the time 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:17.619
 what interrupts people is my information 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:20.160

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:20.160
