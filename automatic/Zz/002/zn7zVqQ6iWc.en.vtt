00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
stock so any water getting through so

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:15.780 
stock so any water getting through so
there's<00:01:14.590> really<00:01:14.740> no<00:01:14.980> chance<00:01:15.310> of<00:01:15.430> any<00:01:15.580> water

getting through there duraflex on the

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.290 
getting through there duraflex on the
knees<00:01:18.070> it's<00:01:18.460> the<00:01:18.580> material<00:01:18.970> with<00:01:19.060> all<00:01:19.210> the

wetsuit<00:01:19.630> companies<00:01:19.990> are<00:01:20.110> using<00:01:20.230> now<00:01:20.530> to

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
wetsuit companies are using now to

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.290 
wetsuit companies are using now to
really<00:01:20.920> hard-wearing<00:01:21.400> and<00:01:21.760> stops<00:01:21.970> the<00:01:22.090> knees

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:22.300 
really hard-wearing and stops the knees

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.240 
really hard-wearing and stops the knees
wearing<00:01:22.690> through<00:01:22.960> makes<00:01:23.560> the<00:01:23.680> suit<00:01:23.890> more

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
wearing through makes the suit more

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.190 
wearing through makes the suit more
robust<00:01:24.640> and<00:01:24.940> it<00:01:25.150> basically<00:01:25.450> increases<00:01:25.840> the

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
robust and it basically increases the

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.890 
robust and it basically increases the
longevity<00:01:26.380> of<00:01:26.830> the<00:01:27.010> suit<00:01:27.220> it's<00:01:28.120> a<00:01:28.300> 5-3<00:01:28.870> so

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:28.900 
longevity of the suit it's a 5-3 so

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.210 
longevity of the suit it's a 5-3 so
you've<00:01:29.110> got<00:01:29.140> a<00:01:29.230> real<00:01:29.350> thick<00:01:29.590> neoprene<00:01:29.770> on<00:01:30.130> the

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
legs and on the core but they do use the

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.650 
legs and on the core but they do use the
III<00:01:33.370> neoprene<00:01:33.730> on<00:01:33.880> the<00:01:33.970> suit<00:01:34.210> as<00:01:34.360> with<00:01:34.630> the

III neoprene on the suit as with the
e-bomb<00:01:35.050> as<00:01:35.170> well<00:01:35.350> so<00:01:35.980> you<00:01:36.070> still<00:01:36.220> get<00:01:36.700> the

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:36.760 
e-bomb as well so you still get the

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.340 
e-bomb as well so you still get the
benefits<00:01:37.180> of<00:01:37.300> all<00:01:37.450> that<00:01:37.600> flexibility<00:01:38.230> a

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
benefits of all that flexibility a

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.920 
benefits of all that flexibility a
little<00:01:38.770> look<00:01:38.890> on<00:01:39.010> the<00:01:39.100> armor<00:01:39.400> suit<00:01:39.930> really

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:40.930 
little look on the armor suit really

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.290 
little look on the armor suit really
loads<00:01:41.170> of<00:01:41.320> flexibility<00:01:41.890> in<00:01:42.100> that<00:01:42.280> the<00:01:42.700> III

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.300 
loads of flexibility in that the III

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.060 
loads of flexibility in that the III
neoprene<00:01:43.780> that<00:01:43.960> red<00:01:44.110> brick<00:01:44.350> coal<00:01:44.560> use<00:01:44.770> is

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
neoprene that red brick coal use is

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.800 
neoprene that red brick coal use is
really<00:01:45.370> the<00:01:45.430> most<00:01:45.460> flexible<00:01:46.150> neoprene

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
really the most flexible neoprene

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.410 
really the most flexible neoprene
available<00:01:47.380> and<00:01:47.760> the<00:01:48.760> benefits<00:01:49.240> of<00:01:49.360> that

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
available and the benefits of that

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.450 
available and the benefits of that
basically<00:01:49.990> is<00:01:50.110> obviously<00:01:50.440> flexibility<00:01:51.250> so

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
basically is obviously flexibility so

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.460 
basically is obviously flexibility so
you're<00:01:51.610> going<00:01:51.700> to<00:01:51.760> get<00:01:51.909> a<00:01:51.970> more<00:01:52.930> flex<00:01:53.200> in<00:01:53.380> the

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
you're going to get a more flex in the

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.130 
you're going to get a more flex in the
water<00:01:53.650> I'm<00:01:54.190> going<00:01:54.400> to<00:01:54.460> feel<00:01:54.610> real<00:01:54.730> loser<00:01:55.140> but

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
water I'm going to feel real loser but

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.570 
water I'm going to feel real loser but
also<00:01:56.320> the<00:01:56.590> neoprene<00:01:56.890> fits<00:01:57.130> better<00:01:57.310> to<00:01:57.460> your

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 
also the neoprene fits better to your

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.370 
also the neoprene fits better to your
body<00:01:57.760> especially<00:01:58.240> around<00:01:58.540> your<00:01:58.780> armpits<00:01:59.260> and

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
body especially around your armpits and

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:00.990 
body especially around your armpits and
all<00:01:59.470> sort<00:01:59.710> of<00:01:59.740> nooks<00:01:59.950> and<00:02:00.070> crannies<00:02:00.460> basically

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
all sort of nooks and crannies basically

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.450 
all sort of nooks and crannies basically
which<00:02:01.600> means<00:02:01.840> that<00:02:02.050> the<00:02:02.409> wetsuits<00:02:02.800> material

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
which means that the wetsuits material

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.250 
which means that the wetsuits material
holds<00:02:03.790> better<00:02:03.970> to<00:02:04.150> your<00:02:04.270> skin<00:02:04.540> and<00:02:04.720> I<00:02:05.080> will

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.260 
holds better to your skin and I will

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:06.690 
holds better to your skin and I will
keep<00:02:05.380> you<00:02:05.500> warmer<00:02:05.800> essentially<00:02:06.310> that's<00:02:06.490> the

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
keep you warmer essentially that's the

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.850 
keep you warmer essentially that's the
theory<00:02:06.909> on<00:02:07.780> the<00:02:08.170> neck<00:02:08.289> of<00:02:08.440> the<00:02:08.470> suit<00:02:08.709> you've

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
theory on the neck of the suit you've

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.429 
theory on the neck of the suit you've
got<00:02:09.009> smooth<00:02:09.280> skin<00:02:09.640> around<00:02:10.239> the<00:02:10.390> neck<00:02:10.599> and

00:02:11.429 --> 00:02:11.439 
got smooth skin around the neck and

00:02:11.439 --> 00:02:13.259 
got smooth skin around the neck and
basically<00:02:11.739> that<00:02:11.889> stops<00:02:12.129> any<00:02:12.340> wetsuit<00:02:12.730> rub<00:02:12.969> any

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:13.269 
basically that stops any wetsuit rub any

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:14.260 
basically that stops any wetsuit rub any
chafing<00:02:13.659> around<00:02:13.900> your<00:02:13.989> neck

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
chafing around your neck

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.420 
chafing around your neck
and<00:02:14.810> just<00:02:15.350> before<00:02:15.470> we<00:02:15.680> look<00:02:15.800> inside<00:02:16.010> then

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
and just before we look inside then

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:17.980 
and just before we look inside then
basically<00:02:16.970> have<00:02:17.360> a<00:02:17.390> little<00:02:17.570> look<00:02:17.690> at<00:02:17.750> the<00:02:17.840> back

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
basically have a little look at the back

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:19.390 
basically have a little look at the back
of<00:02:18.020> the<00:02:18.200> sit<00:02:18.350> you've<00:02:18.500> got<00:02:18.650> more<00:02:18.800> of<00:02:18.860> the<00:02:18.980> taping

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
of the sit you've got more of the taping

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.620 
of the sit you've got more of the taping
on<00:02:19.490> the<00:02:19.580> back<00:02:19.760> to<00:02:20.030> stop<00:02:20.210> the<00:02:20.330> water<00:02:20.480> coming

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
on the back to stop the water coming

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.350 
on the back to stop the water coming
through<00:02:21.160> minimal<00:02:22.160> amount<00:02:22.520> of<00:02:22.610> wetsuit<00:02:23.000> panels

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
through minimal amount of wetsuit panels

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.030 
through minimal amount of wetsuit panels
there's<00:02:23.600> hardly<00:02:23.900> any<00:02:24.110> panels<00:02:24.440> toll<00:02:24.770> on<00:02:24.950> the

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
there's hardly any panels toll on the

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.190 
there's hardly any panels toll on the
suit<00:02:25.310> which<00:02:25.700> a<00:02:25.790> game<00:02:25.970> decreasing<00:02:26.600> about<00:02:26.870> seams

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
suit which a game decreasing about seams

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.420 
suit which a game decreasing about seams
and<00:02:27.500> decreases<00:02:27.950> the<00:02:28.040> amount<00:02:28.160> of<00:02:28.310> water

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
and decreases the amount of water

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.330 
and decreases the amount of water
penetration<00:02:29.030> in<00:02:29.300> the<00:02:29.360> suit<00:02:29.920> also<00:02:30.920> makes<00:02:31.220> it

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
penetration in the suit also makes it

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:32.740 
penetration in the suit also makes it
more<00:02:31.430> flexible<00:02:31.670> less<00:02:32.150> seems<00:02:32.420> more

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
more flexible less seems more

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.630 
more flexible less seems more
flexibility<00:02:33.290> basically<00:02:33.860> so<00:02:34.130> you're<00:02:34.550> getting

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
flexibility basically so you're getting

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.360 
flexibility basically so you're getting
all<00:02:34.910> of<00:02:35.120> those<00:02:35.270> benefits<00:02:35.780> with<00:02:35.930> the<00:02:36.020> suit

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
all of those benefits with the suit

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.250 
all of those benefits with the suit
lastly<00:02:37.370> on<00:02:37.460> the<00:02:37.520> outside<00:02:37.910> you<00:02:38.360> go<00:02:38.510> look<00:02:39.020> at<00:02:39.170> the

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
lastly on the outside you go look at the

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:40.840 
lastly on the outside you go look at the
zip<00:02:39.500> here<00:02:39.680> basically<00:02:39.890> this<00:02:40.190> is<00:02:40.340> only<00:02:40.520> because

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
zip here basically this is only because

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.060 
zip here basically this is only because
patients<00:02:41.120> of<00:02:41.480> technology<00:02:42.110> they've<00:02:42.650> got<00:02:42.830> to

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
patients of technology they've got to

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.470 
patients of technology they've got to
what<00:02:43.880> we<00:02:43.970> call<00:02:44.210> a<00:02:45.340> interlocking<00:02:46.340> zip<00:02:46.610> it's<00:02:47.360> the

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
what we call a interlocking zip it's the

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.880 
what we call a interlocking zip it's the
blue<00:02:47.660> zip<00:02:47.840> here<00:02:47.990> basically<00:02:48.230> what<00:02:48.710> that<00:02:48.740> means

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
blue zip here basically what that means

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.580 
blue zip here basically what that means
that<00:02:49.250> the<00:02:49.340> teeth<00:02:49.640> Mary<00:02:50.390> up<00:02:50.570> so<00:02:50.900> well<00:02:51.170> they<00:02:51.440> sort

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
that the teeth Mary up so well they sort

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.680 
that the teeth Mary up so well they sort
of<00:02:51.650> interlock<00:02:52.100> on<00:02:52.250> the<00:02:52.370> Sioux<00:02:52.610> fill<00:02:53.390> it<00:02:53.480> with<00:02:53.630> a

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
of interlock on the Sioux fill it with a

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.950 
of interlock on the Sioux fill it with a
chrome<00:02:53.960> lip<00:02:54.110> Bob<00:02:55.360> basically<00:02:56.360> that's<00:02:56.570> lamb

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:56.960 
chrome lip Bob basically that's lamb

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.780 
chrome lip Bob basically that's lamb
this<00:02:57.560> highly<00:02:57.890> and<00:02:58.040> water<00:02:58.190> will<00:02:58.370> come<00:02:58.550> through

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
this highly and water will come through

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.610 
this highly and water will come through
the<00:02:58.940> zip<00:02:59.120> at<00:02:59.240> the<00:02:59.300> back<00:02:59.450> of<00:02:59.480> the<00:02:59.660> suit<00:02:59.870> okay

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
the zip at the back of the suit okay

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.560 
the zip at the back of the suit okay
you've<00:03:01.040> got<00:03:01.220> the<00:03:01.520> batwing<00:03:01.820> technology<00:03:02.390> on<00:03:02.510> the

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.570 
you've got the batwing technology on the

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:04.090 
you've got the batwing technology on the
suit<00:03:02.780> as<00:03:02.900> well<00:03:02.930> so<00:03:03.260> you<00:03:03.350> can<00:03:03.380> be<00:03:03.530> a<00:03:03.560> behold<00:03:03.830> flap

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
suit as well so you can be a behold flap

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.070 
suit as well so you can be a behold flap
so<00:03:04.700> any<00:03:04.850> cold<00:03:05.120> water<00:03:05.330> flushes<00:03:05.780> that<00:03:05.930> come

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
so any cold water flushes that come

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.900 
so any cold water flushes that come
through<00:03:06.110> the<00:03:06.380> suit<00:03:06.620> the<00:03:07.130> water<00:03:07.370> is<00:03:07.550> basically

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
through the suit the water is basically

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:09.370 
through the suit the water is basically
guided<00:03:08.360> through<00:03:08.570> the<00:03:08.660> back<00:03:08.840> of<00:03:08.870> the<00:03:09.050> bat<00:03:09.200> wing

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:10.540 
guided through the back of the bat wing
and<00:03:09.590> out<00:03:09.680> of<00:03:09.770> the<00:03:09.830> back<00:03:09.950> of<00:03:09.980> the<00:03:10.190> suit<00:03:10.370> at<00:03:10.520> the

and out of the back of the suit at the
bottom<00:03:10.820> here<00:03:10.970> so<00:03:11.510> the<00:03:11.810> idea<00:03:11.930> is<00:03:12.140> that<00:03:12.230> you

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350 
bottom here so the idea is that you

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:13.750

don't get when you duck diving or going

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.910 
don't get when you duck diving or going
under<00:03:13.970> the<00:03:14.030> water<00:03:14.060> you<00:03:14.930> don't<00:03:15.110> have<00:03:15.290> as<00:03:15.590> much

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
under the water you don't have as much

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.560 
under the water you don't have as much
as<00:03:16.190> a<00:03:16.340> water<00:03:16.550> flushing<00:03:17.060> through<00:03:17.180> the<00:03:17.300> suit

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
as a water flushing through the suit

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.080 
it makes a marked really noticeable

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.780 
it makes a marked really noticeable
difference<00:04:06.560> two<00:04:07.070> wet<00:04:07.250> suits<00:04:07.280> that<00:04:07.580> don't

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
difference two wet suits that don't

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.030 
difference two wet suits that don't
actually<00:04:07.940> have<00:04:08.300> that<00:04:08.330> on<00:04:09.230> the<00:04:09.350> inside<00:04:09.680> you<00:04:09.890> can

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
actually have that on the inside you can

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.860 
actually have that on the inside you can
see<00:04:10.070> that<00:04:10.220> we've<00:04:10.430> got<00:04:10.580> the<00:04:10.700> liquid<00:04:11.209> taping<00:04:11.600> as

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
see that we've got the liquid taping as

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.930 
see that we've got the liquid taping as
well<00:04:12.080> which<00:04:12.650> just<00:04:12.890> reinforces<00:04:13.550> the<00:04:13.670> scenes

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
well which just reinforces the scenes

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.810 
well which just reinforces the scenes
again<00:04:14.120> so<00:04:14.570> in<00:04:14.780> theory<00:04:15.709> basically<00:04:16.070> the<00:04:16.580> seams

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
again so in theory basically the seams

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.370 
again so in theory basically the seams
have<00:04:17.000> just<00:04:17.180> been<00:04:17.330> totally<00:04:17.600> blocked<00:04:18.080> off<00:04:18.230> from
