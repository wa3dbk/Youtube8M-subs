coffee is a combination of three
components<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.980> first<00:01:08.430> one<00:01:08.610> is<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:09.120> quality

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
components the first one is the quality

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.910 
components the first one is the quality
of<00:01:09.600> our<00:01:09.750> beans<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.260> way<00:01:10.380> we<00:01:10.530> source<00:01:10.770> our

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
of our beans and the way we source our

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.910 
of our beans and the way we source our
beans<00:01:11.190> in<00:01:11.550> the<00:01:11.910> direct<00:01:12.240> trade<00:01:12.480> model<00:01:12.920> the

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
beans in the direct trade model the

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.100 
beans in the direct trade model the
second<00:01:14.670> important<00:01:15.240> factor<00:01:15.540> is<00:01:15.630> our<00:01:15.750> roasting

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
second important factor is our roasting

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.960 
second important factor is our roasting
process<00:01:16.230> or<00:01:16.710> micro<00:01:17.190> roaster<00:01:17.580> we're<00:01:17.820> not<00:01:17.940> a

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
process or micro roaster we're not a

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.880 
process or micro roaster we're not a
mass-produced<00:01:18.510> roaster<00:01:18.960> so<00:01:19.560> we're<00:01:19.710> roasting

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
mass-produced roaster so we're roasting

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.070 
mass-produced roaster so we're roasting
small<00:01:20.340> batches<00:01:20.580> and<00:01:21.030> it's<00:01:21.540> a<00:01:21.600> very<00:01:21.630> tightly

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
small batches and it's a very tightly

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.050 
small batches and it's a very tightly
controlled<00:01:22.530> process<00:01:22.980> and<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.700> third<00:01:23.910> most

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
controlled process and the third most

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.850 
controlled process and the third most
important<00:01:24.450> thing<00:01:24.600> is<00:01:24.690> the<00:01:24.810> freshness<00:01:25.050> and<00:01:25.380> all

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
important thing is the freshness and all

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.650 
important thing is the freshness and all
our<00:01:26.040> coffee<00:01:26.310> is<00:01:26.520> delivered<00:01:26.910> within<00:01:27.150> 24<00:01:27.420> hours

our coffee is delivered within 24 hours

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.420 
our coffee is delivered within 24 hours
of<00:01:27.930> roasting<00:01:28.350> whether<00:01:28.650> it's<00:01:28.830> consumers<00:01:29.310> or

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
of roasting whether it's consumers or

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.240 
of roasting whether it's consumers or
stores<00:01:29.700> so<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.870> coffee<00:01:31.080> are<00:01:31.260> getting<00:01:31.530> is<00:01:31.710> at

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
stores so the coffee are getting is at

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.160 
stores so the coffee are getting is at
its<00:01:32.460> peak<00:01:32.670> flavor<00:01:33.030> potential<00:01:33.600> when<00:01:33.930> you<00:01:34.020> get

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
its peak flavor potential when you get

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.700 
its peak flavor potential when you get
it

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.260 

so<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.800> first<00:01:41.040> thing<00:01:41.130> we're<00:01:41.400> looking<00:01:41.430> at<00:01:41.850> is<00:01:42.120> a

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
so the first thing we're looking at is a

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.110 
so the first thing we're looking at is a
green<00:01:42.660> colombian<00:01:43.290> supremo<00:01:43.470> and<00:01:44.040> this<00:01:44.790> is<00:01:44.940> its

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
unroasted state the next stage we're

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.730 
unroasted state the next stage we're
looking<00:01:48.120> at<00:01:48.300> is<00:01:48.570> just<00:01:49.200> as<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.500> beam<00:01:49.710> is

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
looking at is just as the beam is

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.260

starting to caramelize on the outside

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.670 
starting to caramelize on the outside
then<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.630> coffee<00:01:51.810> is<00:01:51.960> just<00:01:52.200> starting<00:01:52.440> to<00:01:52.470> turn

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680
