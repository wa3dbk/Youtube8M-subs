00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:05.809
 There are a whole lot of luxury hotels in Vienna 

00:00:05.209 --> 00:00:07.490
 amount 

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:09.139
 there the visitors have our beautiful 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:10.820
 City already the agony of choice 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:12.830
 now it will be a lot 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:16.039
 harder than the new five stars like that 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.690
 susi hotel has opened and we are 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:19.730
 today at the opening gala 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:22.010
 and ask the celebrity it was one 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:34.580
 Hotel needs to be more than 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:37.130
 only at home that meant without 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:38.930
 one has no worries here when 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:42.350
 you spend the night here how does it look like 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.970
 that is of course the purpose of this name 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.370
 to make the program 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:49.520
 We want to create an oasis for ours 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.530
 guests got pleasure and lifestyle in the 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.440
 our cinemas, so to speak 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.940
 and we try that to the best of our ability 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.160
 Vienna gives you a whole lot of luxury 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.559
 hotels what is the striking argument 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.350
 that makes you the best hotel in vienna 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:05.840
 makes 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:09.050
 I think that's the combination 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:11.930
 a generous spa of art 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:14.119
 lifestyle very personal service because 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.670
 he is a small house with 63 rooms 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:18.770
 where we are very individual on the 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.500
 wishes of our guests 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.810
 and with the gastronomy with the stretcher 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.560
 It is a very deining with the freewheel 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.560
 round story 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.950
 you are certainly someone very much 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.320
 what is your travel at a hotel 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.670
 So important in a model is important 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.369
 that you feel at home and me 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.560
 I think the decor is very important 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.360
 but that's what a hotel really is 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.460
 the crown is the 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.100
 personal care speaks that 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:01.340
 personnel when the the desire of the 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.619
 Eyes are read and discretion is 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.390
 also very important and that is the 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:08.090
 Factors of a good hotel but how 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.310
 said the office staff in the first one 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:13.640
 home 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.110
 As I said, something personal and evening 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.180
 I think a model has to be somewhere 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.530
 So personal touch have one 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.780
 modern and with the last 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.330
 or whatever I think now 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.100
 it is a model of it personally 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.450
 makes or pleases to me and 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.030
 makes domestic or where I am then 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.860
 right at home, where you feel something 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.380
 Must have a hotel for you to like 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:38.340
 at home or better still more than 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:40.080
 At home the hotel does not feel like it 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.680
 to be as good as that, i can not do more than 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:46.319
 at home feel that I am afraid to say 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:49.410
 but there's just where I replace 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:51.180
 say that can have a hotel room that 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.170
 I'm not at home so here to 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:57.690
 for example, there is a fabulous 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.820
 interesting bathtub a pretty 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.250
 big round black bathtub that too 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:04.860
 then directly with the window 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:07.230
 look out to historical such museum 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.300
 The region is that's something I have 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:12.019
 I at home not that it's something 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:14.700
 you can then already volume 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:16.260
 have a lot of water his hotel 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.370
 they have more than just at home 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.909
 feel 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:24.120
 must have a flair the teaching game that 

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:25.860
 must be a good big must 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.930
 be more friendly board 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:32.120
 They are experts in beauty when they are 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.120
 to look around here they are a lot of beautiful 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:42.650
 it reminds me of because only professionally 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.840
 He has grown the prominence sparkle of 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.400
 hotel ever to be thrilled yet 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.450
 I have to say the ambiente can be 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.670
 really let see 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.260

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.270
