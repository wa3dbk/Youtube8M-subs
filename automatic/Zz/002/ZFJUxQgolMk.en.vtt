00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
think that I think the cavils thinking

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:43.730 
think that I think the cavils thinking
you<00:01:42.630> know<00:01:42.750> what<00:01:42.930> I'm<00:01:43.049> not<00:01:43.229> gonna<00:01:43.380> go<00:01:43.619> the

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.020 
you know what I'm not gonna go the
Brandon<00:01:44.100> Ralph<00:01:44.310> through<00:01:44.460> out<00:01:44.549> here<00:01:44.759> again<00:01:44.850> I

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
Brandon Ralph through out here again I

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.399 
Brandon Ralph through out here again I
don't<00:01:45.149> want<00:01:45.509> because<00:01:45.689> Brandon<00:01:45.990> Rawe<00:01:46.110> probably

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
don't want because Brandon Rawe probably

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.660 
don't want because Brandon Rawe probably
would<00:01:46.500> have<00:01:46.590> loved<00:01:46.770> within<00:01:47.040> super<00:01:47.280> innoGames

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
would have loved within super innoGames

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.310 
would have loved within super innoGames
or<00:01:47.880> had<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.180> opportunity<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:48.840> I<00:01:48.899> think<00:01:48.960> that

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
or had the opportunity and I think that

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.219 
or had the opportunity and I think that
he<00:01:49.530> knows<00:01:49.799> what<00:01:50.369> is<00:01:50.549> what<00:01:51.030> he<00:01:51.360> can<00:01:51.600> be<00:01:52.049> with

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
he knows what is what he can be with

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.200 
he knows what is what he can be with
this<00:01:52.380> now<00:01:52.590> even<00:01:52.829> if<00:01:53.130> Superman<00:01:53.790> doesn't<00:01:53.970> end<00:01:54.149> up

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
this now even if Superman doesn't end up

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.609 
this now even if Superman doesn't end up
being<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.450> star<00:01:54.689> of<00:01:54.780> all<00:01:54.899> these<00:01:55.020> films<00:01:55.350> he

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
being the star of all these films he

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:56.810 
being the star of all these films he
still<00:01:55.829> gets<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.070> make<00:01:56.219> an<00:01:56.340> appearance

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
still gets to make an appearance

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.730 
still gets to make an appearance
and<00:01:56.939> he<00:01:57.119> still<00:01:57.360> gets<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:57.600> work<00:01:57.869> as<00:01:58.140> an<00:01:58.350> actor<00:01:58.710> I

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
and he still gets to work as an actor I

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.380 
and he still gets to work as an actor I
mean<00:01:58.890> I<00:01:58.979> think<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.219> cool<00:01:59.430> part<00:01:59.790> is<00:01:59.909> when<00:02:00.299> you

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
mean I think the cool part is when you

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.300 
mean I think the cool part is when you
see<00:02:00.570> somebody<00:02:00.780> like<00:02:00.960> Hugh<00:02:01.290> Jackman<00:02:01.799> who<00:02:02.100> does

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
see somebody like Hugh Jackman who does

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.920 
see somebody like Hugh Jackman who does
have<00:02:02.490> all<00:02:02.640> these<00:02:02.759> different<00:02:02.909> options<00:02:03.450> oh<00:02:03.509> it's

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
have all these different options oh it's

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.840 
have all these different options oh it's
embrace<00:02:04.320> playing<00:02:04.710> Wolverine<00:02:05.310> so<00:02:05.579> I<00:02:05.610> don't

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
embrace playing Wolverine so I don't

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.490 
embrace playing Wolverine so I don't
think<00:02:06.000> it's<00:02:06.119> to<00:02:06.390> that<00:02:06.540> level<00:02:06.780> of<00:02:06.990> all<00:02:07.170> coolly

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
think it's to that level of all coolly

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.990 
think it's to that level of all coolly
saying<00:02:07.829> no<00:02:07.979> to<00:02:08.039> everything<00:02:08.250> else<00:02:08.550> so<00:02:08.700> he<00:02:08.879> can

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
saying no to everything else so he can

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.249 
saying no to everything else so he can
still<00:02:09.179> be<00:02:09.270> Superman<00:02:09.690> he<00:02:09.959> wants<00:02:10.110> to<00:02:10.170> be

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
still be Superman he wants to be

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.630 
still be Superman he wants to be
Superman<00:02:10.649> because<00:02:10.950> he<00:02:11.069> wants<00:02:11.250> to<00:02:11.340> pay<00:02:11.520> his

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
Superman because he wants to pay his

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.640 
Superman because he wants to pay his
rent<00:02:11.879> but<00:02:12.390> I<00:02:12.420> think<00:02:12.660> that<00:02:12.750> it's<00:02:12.900> also<00:02:13.080> nice

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650
