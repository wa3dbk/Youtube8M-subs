okay here's here's a baby cascade plant

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.670 
okay here's here's a baby cascade plant
and<00:00:37.880> I'm<00:00:38.090> trying<00:00:38.750> to<00:00:38.810> show<00:00:39.080> you<00:00:39.110> guys<00:00:39.410> how<00:00:39.650> to

and I'm trying to show you guys how to

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.180 
and I'm trying to show you guys how to
train<00:00:40.280> and<00:00:40.520> take<00:00:40.670> care<00:00:40.940> of<00:00:41.059> this<00:00:41.590> plant<00:00:42.590> and

train and take care of this plant and
why<00:00:43.370> we<00:00:43.520> call<00:00:43.760> it<00:00:43.790> a<00:00:43.970> baby<00:00:44.150> plan<00:00:44.570> is<00:00:44.809> it's<00:00:45.050> the

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 
why we call it a baby plan is it's the

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.950 
why we call it a baby plan is it's the
first<00:00:45.559> year<00:00:45.770> that<00:00:46.670> it's<00:00:47.239> come<00:00:47.660> out<00:00:47.809> of<00:00:47.900> the

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
first year that it's come out of the

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.530 
first year that it's come out of the
ground<00:00:48.140> from<00:00:48.500> rhizomes<00:00:49.070> if<00:00:49.820> you've<00:00:50.090> got<00:00:50.300> these

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:50.540 
ground from rhizomes if you've got these

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.400 
ground from rhizomes if you've got these
runners<00:00:51.260> which<00:00:51.530> we<00:00:51.680> call<00:00:51.920> vines<00:00:52.989> we<00:00:53.989> like<00:00:54.199> to

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.410 
runners which we call vines we like to

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.799 
runners which we call vines we like to
take<00:00:54.680> and<00:00:55.280> start<00:00:55.610> at<00:00:55.790> the<00:00:55.879> bottom<00:00:56.270> as<00:00:56.390> close<00:00:56.600> as

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:56.809 
take and start at the bottom as close as

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:00.009 
take and start at the bottom as close as
you<00:00:56.900> can<00:00:57.140> and<00:00:57.500> train<00:00:58.280> them<00:00:58.430> up<00:00:58.670> and<00:00:58.910> we<00:00:59.660> go<00:00:59.840> the

00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:00.019 
you can and train them up and we go the

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:02.470 
you can and train them up and we go the
same<00:01:00.230> way<00:01:00.440> as<00:01:00.590> the<00:01:00.739> Sun<00:01:01.010> goes<00:01:01.790> because<00:01:02.090> that's

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:02.480 
same way as the Sun goes because that's

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.899 
same way as the Sun goes because that's
the<00:01:02.600> way<00:01:02.720> the<00:01:02.870> plant<00:01:03.140> grows<00:01:03.580> and<00:01:04.580> you<00:01:04.729> just

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:04.909 
the way the plant grows and you just

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:08.080 
the way the plant grows and you just
wrap<00:01:05.180> it<00:01:05.210> around<00:01:06.280> and<00:01:07.280> you<00:01:07.340> kind<00:01:07.670> of<00:01:07.760> be

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
wrap it around and you kind of be

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.070 
wrap it around and you kind of be
careful<00:01:08.600> with<00:01:08.840> this<00:01:09.280> ahead<00:01:10.280> of<00:01:10.880> the<00:01:11.090> hop<00:01:11.270> which

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
careful with this ahead of the hop which

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.050 
careful with this ahead of the hop which
if<00:01:12.229> you<00:01:12.320> break<00:01:12.590> it<00:01:12.799> off<00:01:13.010> it<00:01:13.310> slows<00:01:13.640> the<00:01:13.880> growth

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
if you break it off it slows the growth

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.840 
if you break it off it slows the growth
down<00:01:14.510> it<00:01:15.260> won't<00:01:15.470> kill<00:01:15.770> it<00:01:15.979> but<00:01:16.190> it<00:01:16.340> slows<00:01:16.670> the

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
down it won't kill it but it slows the

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.940 
down it won't kill it but it slows the
growth<00:01:17.060> and<00:01:17.479> it<00:01:17.570> will<00:01:17.659> have<00:01:17.810> to<00:01:18.020> shoot<00:01:18.500> arms

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
growth and it will have to shoot arms

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.480 
growth and it will have to shoot arms
it's<00:01:19.340> not<00:01:19.549> good<00:01:19.729> for<00:01:19.760> a<00:01:20.000> baby<00:01:20.150> plant<00:01:20.830> and<00:01:21.830> we<00:01:21.979> we

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
it's not good for a baby plant and we we

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.510 
it's not good for a baby plant and we we
train<00:01:22.909> all<00:01:23.570> the<00:01:24.380> vines<00:01:24.619> that<00:01:24.860> come<00:01:25.100> out<00:01:25.250> of<00:01:25.280> a

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
baby as long as we got an empty string

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.399 
baby as long as we got an empty string
and<00:01:28.280> we<00:01:28.340> call<00:01:28.549> out<00:01:28.729> an<00:01:28.850> empty<00:01:29.119> string<00:01:29.540> and<00:01:29.840> we

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
and we call out an empty string and we

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:34.030 
and we call out an empty string and we
like<00:01:30.619> to<00:01:30.830> put<00:01:31.130> three<00:01:31.970> vines<00:01:32.240> per<00:01:32.780> string<00:01:33.560> if<00:01:33.890> we

like to put three vines per string if we

like to put three vines per string if we
can<00:01:34.510> sometimes<00:01:35.510> we<00:01:35.689> can<00:01:35.930> sometimes<00:01:36.560> we<00:01:36.740> can't

00:01:58.539 --> 00:01:58.549 
weather that we'll be ready to train to

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:02.620 
weather that we'll be ready to train to
go<00:01:58.729> to<00:01:58.789> this<00:01:59.060> string<00:01:59.509> and<00:02:00.880> as<00:02:01.880> far<00:02:02.149> as<00:02:02.210> water

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
go to this string and as far as water

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.529 
go to this string and as far as water
goes<00:02:02.990> pop<00:02:03.740> plants<00:02:04.189> like<00:02:04.549> a<00:02:04.579> lot<00:02:04.969> of<00:02:05.119> water<00:02:05.299> but

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:05.539 
goes pop plants like a lot of water but

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:07.899 
goes pop plants like a lot of water but
they<00:02:05.719> don't<00:02:05.899> like<00:02:06.049> to<00:02:06.200> be<00:02:06.229> drowned<00:02:07.100> so<00:02:07.850> you

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:07.909 
they don't like to be drowned so you

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:10.719 
they don't like to be drowned so you
kind<00:02:08.390> of<00:02:08.479> just<00:02:08.690> keep<00:02:08.960> them<00:02:09.200> moist<00:02:10.039> if<00:02:10.399> you<00:02:10.550> can

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
kind of just keep them moist if you can

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.470 
kind of just keep them moist if you can
come<00:02:10.940> out<00:02:11.200> make<00:02:12.200> a<00:02:12.230> lot<00:02:12.590> like<00:02:13.010> that<00:02:13.310> you<00:02:14.270> got

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
come out make a lot like that you got

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.720 
come out make a lot like that you got
plenty<00:02:14.690> of<00:02:14.900> moisture<00:02:15.080> so<00:02:16.040> you<00:02:16.100> just<00:02:16.370> kind<00:02:16.640> of

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
plenty of moisture so you just kind of

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.110 
plenty of moisture so you just kind of
watch<00:02:16.970> it<00:02:17.300> and<00:02:17.830> when<00:02:18.830> this<00:02:19.040> when<00:02:19.730> you<00:02:19.850> can't

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
watch it and when this when you can't

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.400 
watch it and when this when you can't
make<00:02:20.330> a<00:02:20.360> ball<00:02:20.720> like<00:02:21.080> that<00:02:21.110> we<00:02:22.069> irrigate<00:02:22.490> again

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
make a ball like that we irrigate again

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.960 
make a ball like that we irrigate again
dependent<00:02:24.410> on<00:02:24.500> the<00:02:24.650> weather<00:02:24.860> it<00:02:25.220> really

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
dependent on the weather it really

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.250 
dependent on the weather it really
changes<00:02:26.540> how<00:02:27.110> much<00:02:27.380> water<00:02:27.650> how<00:02:28.280> much<00:02:28.569> not<00:02:29.569> but

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
changes how much water how much not but

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.550 
changes how much water how much not but
it's<00:02:30.410> pretty<00:02:30.860> important<00:02:31.550> to<00:02:31.760> keep<00:02:32.000> the<00:02:32.560> ground

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
it's pretty important to keep the ground

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.180 
it's pretty important to keep the ground
around<00:02:34.490> the<00:02:34.730> hop<00:02:34.940> clean<00:02:35.330> because<00:02:36.260> of<00:02:36.500> moisture

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
around the hop clean because of moisture

think<00:02:52.120> full-year<00:02:52.990> spray<00:02:54.420> would<00:02:55.420> be<00:02:55.630> fine<00:02:55.930> if

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
think full-year spray would be fine if

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.440 
think full-year spray would be fine if
you<00:02:56.440> get<00:02:56.650> into<00:02:56.920> more<00:02:57.190> heavier<00:02:57.700> chemicals<00:02:58.300> you

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
you get into more heavier chemicals you

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.490 
you get into more heavier chemicals you
got<00:02:58.600> a<00:02:58.630> chance<00:02:59.020> of<00:02:59.260> burning<00:02:59.680> the<00:03:00.280> spray<00:03:00.640> but<00:03:01.540> or

burning the hop but if you miracle-gro

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.120 
burning the hop but if you miracle-gro
is<00:03:06.490> pretty<00:03:06.790> safe<00:03:07.090> and<00:03:07.390> most<00:03:08.230> people<00:03:08.770> have<00:03:08.950> it

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
is pretty safe and most people have it

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.810 
is pretty safe and most people have it
and<00:03:09.310> you<00:03:09.490> can<00:03:09.520> get<00:03:09.850> it<00:03:09.970> pretty<00:03:10.080> easy<00:03:11.080> and<00:03:11.820> this

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
and you can get it pretty easy and this

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:17.310 
and you can get it pretty easy and this
is<00:03:13.380> string<00:03:14.380> is<00:03:15.160> made<00:03:15.520> from<00:03:15.970> coconut<00:03:16.540> husk<00:03:17.020> and

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
is string is made from coconut husk and

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:22.620 
is string is made from coconut husk and
it's<00:03:17.950> kind<00:03:18.190> of<00:03:18.280> rough<00:03:18.640> in<00:03:19.120> in<00:03:19.830> and<00:03:21.240> coarse<00:03:22.240> and

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
it's kind of rough in in and coarse and

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.480 
it's kind of rough in in and coarse and
the<00:03:22.840> hop<00:03:23.020> likes<00:03:23.440> it<00:03:23.680> because<00:03:23.800> it<00:03:24.190> kind<00:03:24.430> of

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:24.490 
the hop likes it because it kind of

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:27.900 
the hop likes it because it kind of
holds<00:03:24.670> on<00:03:24.970> to<00:03:25.270> it<00:03:25.450> so<00:03:26.050> the<00:03:26.260> head<00:03:26.640> right<00:03:27.640> here

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
holds on to it so the head right here

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.400 
holds on to it so the head right here
doesn't<00:03:28.660> pop<00:03:29.080> off<00:03:29.350> and<00:03:30.040> it<00:03:30.280> will<00:03:30.400> climb<00:03:30.760> and

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
doesn't pop off and it will climb and

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.370 
doesn't pop off and it will climb and
then<00:03:32.410> on<00:03:32.709> a<00:03:32.770> good<00:03:33.250> day<00:03:33.600> what<00:03:34.600> these<00:03:34.840> will<00:03:35.200> grow

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
then on a good day what these will grow

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.090 
then on a good day what these will grow
so<00:03:36.250> they<00:03:37.120> can<00:03:37.450> grow<00:03:37.720> six<00:03:38.050> to<00:03:38.230> eight<00:03:38.290> inches<00:03:38.740> but

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
so they can grow six to eight inches but

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.940 
so they can grow six to eight inches but
normally<00:03:39.790> probably<00:03:40.360> an<00:03:40.810> inch<00:03:41.140> or<00:03:41.320> two<00:03:41.530> a<00:03:41.560> day

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
normally probably an inch or two a day

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.600 
normally probably an inch or two a day
and<00:03:41.980> and<00:03:43.560> then<00:03:44.560> they'll<00:03:44.800> do<00:03:44.950> a<00:03:44.980> lot<00:03:45.190> of<00:03:45.250> growing

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610 
and and then they'll do a lot of growing

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:47.430 
and and then they'll do a lot of growing
at<00:03:45.850> night<00:03:46.060> when<00:03:46.360> it's<00:03:46.510> cool<00:03:46.780> but<00:03:47.080> they<00:03:47.230> want

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
at night when it's cool but they want

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.699 
at night when it's cool but they want
the<00:03:47.560> temperatures<00:03:48.190> around<00:03:48.850> 50<00:03:49.350> to<00:03:50.350> grow

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
the temperatures around 50 to grow

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:56.970 
the temperatures around 50 to grow
through<00:03:51.070> the<00:03:51.220> night<00:03:51.660> 85<00:03:52.660> to<00:03:55.019> 80<00:03:56.019> to<00:03:56.290> 85<00:03:56.769> is

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
through the night 85 to 80 to 85 is

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.320 
through the night 85 to 80 to 85 is
pretty<00:03:57.280> pretty<00:03:57.880> nice<00:03:58.120> growing<00:03:59.050> weather
