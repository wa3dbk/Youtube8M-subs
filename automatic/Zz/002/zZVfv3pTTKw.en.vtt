segment on legendaries this time around

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.029 
segment on legendaries this time around
were<00:00:13.150> going<00:00:13.270> to<00:00:13.330> be<00:00:13.389> going<00:00:13.540> over<00:00:13.690> shields<00:00:14.200> so

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:15.039 
were going to be going over shields so

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:17.730 
were going to be going over shields so
first<00:00:15.459> up<00:00:15.670> in<00:00:15.820> our<00:00:15.910> lineup<00:00:16.120> we<00:00:16.450> have<00:00:16.630> the<00:00:17.350> B

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:17.740 
first up in our lineup we have the B

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.700 
first up in our lineup we have the B
which<00:00:18.460> is<00:00:19.289> possibly<00:00:20.289> one<00:00:20.410> of<00:00:20.440> the<00:00:20.530> hottest

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:20.710 
which is possibly one of the hottest

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.130 
which is possibly one of the hottest
items<00:00:20.920> on<00:00:21.220> the<00:00:21.279> market<00:00:21.580> right<00:00:21.670> now<00:00:21.730> and<00:00:22.109> for<00:00:23.109> a

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:23.140 
items on the market right now and for a

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.160 
items on the market right now and for a
very<00:00:23.320> obvious<00:00:23.740> reason<00:00:24.099> as<00:00:24.910> you<00:00:25.119> can<00:00:25.269> see<00:00:25.509> with

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:26.170 
very obvious reason as you can see with

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:29.960 
very obvious reason as you can see with
this<00:00:26.560> B<00:00:26.710> we<00:00:26.890> get<00:00:27.039> an<00:00:27.160> extra<00:00:27.490> 50<00:00:27.849> tooth<00:00:28.890> 502

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
this B we get an extra 50 tooth 502

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.750 
this B we get an extra 50 tooth 502
damage<00:00:30.970> per<00:00:31.179> shot<00:00:31.210> with<00:00:32.140> a<00:00:32.410> zero<00:00:33.190> amp<00:00:33.520> shot

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:33.760 
damage per shot with a zero amp shot

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.020 
damage per shot with a zero amp shot
drain<00:00:34.060> and<00:00:34.890> well<00:00:35.890> basically<00:00:36.190> it<00:00:36.550> allows<00:00:36.760> you

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:37.030 
drain and well basically it allows you

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:42.529 
drain and well basically it allows you
to<00:00:37.379> destroy<00:00:38.379> everything<00:00:39.660> so<00:00:40.950> as<00:00:41.950> you<00:00:42.129> can<00:00:42.250> see

00:00:42.529 --> 00:00:42.539 
to destroy everything so as you can see

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:45.630 
to destroy everything so as you can see
80,000<00:00:43.539> on<00:00:43.899> one<00:00:44.289> bullet<00:00:44.530> from<00:00:44.770> an<00:00:44.920> SMG<00:00:45.250> that

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:45.640 
80,000 on one bullet from an SMG that

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.250 
80,000 on one bullet from an SMG that
normally<00:00:46.000> does<00:00:46.649> 3000<00:00:47.760> yeah<00:00:48.760> it's<00:00:49.359> a<00:00:49.449> pretty

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:50.260 
normally does 3000 yeah it's a pretty

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.010 
normally does 3000 yeah it's a pretty
brutal<00:00:50.530> but<00:00:51.390> don't<00:00:52.390> want<00:00:52.510> to<00:00:52.600> destroy

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:53.020 
brutal but don't want to destroy

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.110 
brutal but don't want to destroy
everything<00:00:53.199> too<00:00:53.530> fast<00:00:53.829> so<00:00:54.190> let's<00:00:54.699> move<00:00:54.850> on<00:00:55.000> to

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.120 
everything too fast so let's move on to

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.479 
everything too fast so let's move on to
our<00:00:55.149> next<00:00:55.300> shield<00:00:55.600> which<00:00:56.320> is<00:00:56.350> the<00:00:56.739> neo<00:00:57.039> janitor

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:57.489 
our next shield which is the neo janitor

00:00:57.489 --> 00:00:59.700 
our next shield which is the neo janitor
and<00:00:57.730> this<00:00:58.300> is<00:00:58.480> a<00:00:58.510> your<00:00:58.870> typical<00:00:59.050> Anson<00:00:59.469> shield

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
and this is a your typical Anson shield

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.110 
and this is a your typical Anson shield
and<00:01:00.010> she<00:01:00.100> comes<00:01:00.250> with<00:01:00.430> you<00:01:00.640> know<00:01:00.730> increased

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120 
and she comes with you know increased

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.720 
and she comes with you know increased
health<00:01:01.329> elemental<00:01:01.809> resistance<00:01:02.730> in

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.730 
health elemental resistance in

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.430 
health elemental resistance in
particular<00:01:04.239> I<00:01:04.269> took<00:01:04.540> one<00:01:04.750> that<00:01:04.930> had<00:01:05.080> a<00:01:05.110> lower

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.440 
particular I took one that had a lower

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.300 
particular I took one that had a lower
capacity<00:01:05.650> but<00:01:06.160> a<00:01:06.220> fast<00:01:06.490> recharge<00:01:06.880> delay<00:01:07.120> and

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
capacity but a fast recharge delay and

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.230 
capacity but a fast recharge delay and
the<00:01:09.310> other<00:01:09.430> nice<00:01:09.670> thing<00:01:09.850> about<00:01:09.880> the<00:01:10.119> new

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
the other nice thing about the new

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.060 
the other nice thing about the new
generator<00:01:10.570> is<00:01:10.750> that<00:01:10.930> as<00:01:11.080> you<00:01:11.229> can<00:01:11.350> see<00:01:11.409> my

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.070 
generator is that as you can see my

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.640 
generator is that as you can see my
health<00:01:12.280> is<00:01:12.460> regenerating<00:01:13.119> and<00:01:13.299> not<00:01:14.290> only<00:01:14.409> will

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:14.650 
health is regenerating and not only will

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:16.590 
health is regenerating and not only will
health<00:01:14.799> regenerate<00:01:15.400> with<00:01:15.549> this<00:01:15.729> gun<00:01:15.939> but<00:01:16.270> the

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
health regenerate with this gun but the

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.469 
health regenerate with this gun but the
lower<00:01:17.290> your<00:01:17.560> shield<00:01:17.830> is<00:01:18.009> the<00:01:18.270> faster<00:01:19.270> your

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:19.479 
lower your shield is the faster your

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:21.450 
lower your shield is the faster your
health<00:01:19.659> regeneration<00:01:20.110> until<00:01:21.100> your<00:01:21.250> shield

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
health regeneration until your shield

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.520 
health regeneration until your shield
runs<00:01:21.640> out<00:01:21.850> basically<00:01:22.840> once<00:01:22.990> your<00:01:23.140> shield<00:01:23.320> gets

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
runs out basically once your shield gets

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.760 
runs out basically once your shield gets
empty<00:01:23.860> the<00:01:24.430> healthy<00:01:24.700> generation<00:01:25.119> will<00:01:25.240> stop

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
empty the healthy generation will stop

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.410 
empty the healthy generation will stop
as<00:01:26.770> you<00:01:26.860> can<00:01:26.979> see<00:01:27.189> now<00:01:27.640> that<00:01:27.670> my<00:01:27.880> shields<00:01:28.240> low

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
as you can see now that my shields low

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.740 
as you can see now that my shields low
my<00:01:28.869> health<00:01:29.079> is<00:01:29.259> relying<00:01:29.920> on<00:01:30.130> it<00:01:30.369> okay<00:01:31.360> luckily

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
my health is relying on it okay luckily

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:32.910 
my health is relying on it okay luckily
you<00:01:32.020> know<00:01:32.079> I<00:01:32.140> have<00:01:32.290> a<00:01:32.320> nice<00:01:32.439> shield<00:01:32.740> recharge

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
you know I have a nice shield recharge

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.520 
you know I have a nice shield recharge
rate<00:01:33.340> too<00:01:33.520> so<00:01:33.790> helps<00:01:34.750> to<00:01:34.840> bounce<00:01:35.049> things<00:01:35.259> out

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
rate too so helps to bounce things out

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.910 
rate too so helps to bounce things out
when<00:01:35.680> using<00:01:35.860> that<00:01:35.979> one<00:01:37.200> next<00:01:38.200> in<00:01:38.500> our<00:01:38.590> lineup

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
when using that one next in our lineup

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.389 
when using that one next in our lineup
we<00:01:39.399> have<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:40.750> hide<00:01:41.170> of<00:01:41.409> tear<00:01:41.680> amorphous<00:01:42.130> which

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:42.399 
we have the hide of tear amorphous which

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:44.789 
we have the hide of tear amorphous which
as<00:01:43.180> you<00:01:43.360> can<00:01:43.390> guess<00:01:43.689> is<00:01:43.930> a<00:01:43.960> terramortis<00:01:44.409> drop

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:44.799 
as you can guess is a terramortis drop

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:47.910 
as you can guess is a terramortis drop
and<00:01:45.130> this<00:01:45.850> is<00:01:46.030> a<00:01:46.060> two<00:01:46.869> part<00:01:47.020> shield<00:01:47.320> basically

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
and this is a two part shield basically

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.679 
and this is a two part shield basically
when<00:01:48.100> it<00:01:48.189> gets<00:01:48.340> depleted<00:01:48.579> not<00:01:49.119> only<00:01:49.420> do<00:01:49.600> you

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:49.689 
when it gets depleted not only do you

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:53.209 
when it gets depleted not only do you
get<00:01:49.840> a<00:01:50.219> ridiculous<00:01:51.219> amount<00:01:51.490> of<00:01:51.670> void<00:01:51.820> damage

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:53.219 
get a ridiculous amount of void damage

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:56.310 
get a ridiculous amount of void damage
36,000<00:01:54.219> but<00:01:54.880> you<00:01:55.030> also<00:01:55.240> get<00:01:55.600> a<00:01:55.630> fire<00:01:56.049> Nova

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 
36,000 but you also get a fire Nova

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.109 
36,000 but you also get a fire Nova
blast<00:01:56.560> that<00:01:56.740> goes<00:01:56.890> off<00:01:57.100> which<00:01:57.369> you<00:01:57.670> can<00:01:57.939> see

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:58.119 
blast that goes off which you can see

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.010 
blast that goes off which you can see
this<00:01:58.329> one<00:01:58.540> is<00:01:58.780> a<00:01:59.110> ninety<00:02:00.040> one<00:02:00.219> 590<00:02:00.939> so<00:02:01.329> it's<00:02:01.719> a

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
this one is a ninety one 590 so it's a

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.170 
this one is a ninety one 590 so it's a
lot<00:02:02.469> of<00:02:02.500> Nova<00:02:02.890> damage<00:02:03.189> going<00:02:03.399> out<00:02:03.670> usually

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
lot of Nova damage going out usually

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.810 
lot of Nova damage going out usually
enough<00:02:04.360> to<00:02:04.390> kill<00:02:05.200> just<00:02:05.409> about<00:02:05.469> everything<00:02:05.920> and

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
enough to kill just about everything and

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.580 
enough to kill just about everything and
if<00:02:06.969> that's<00:02:07.180> not<00:02:07.509> enough<00:02:07.689> of<00:02:08.050> course<00:02:08.110> you<00:02:08.470> get

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
if that's not enough of course you get

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.310 
if that's not enough of course you get
spike<00:02:09.070> damage<00:02:09.430> as<00:02:09.580> well<00:02:09.759> so<00:02:10.479> if<00:02:10.990> you<00:02:11.140> like

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.320 
spike damage as well so if you like

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.770 
spike damage as well so if you like
running<00:02:11.590> around<00:02:11.940> basically<00:02:12.940> blank<00:02:13.510> range

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
running around basically blank range

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.510 
running around basically blank range
with<00:02:14.050> people<00:02:14.380> and<00:02:14.500> fighting<00:02:14.890> them<00:02:15.100> and

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
with people and fighting them and

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.940 
with people and fighting them and
you<00:02:16.150> know<00:02:16.270> seeing<00:02:16.660> Nova's<00:02:17.110> go<00:02:17.260> off<00:02:17.440> and<00:02:17.680> spike

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
you know seeing Nova's go off and spike

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.220 
you know seeing Nova's go off and spike
damage<00:02:18.430> and<00:02:18.760> punching<00:02:19.090> stuff<00:02:19.330> and<00:02:19.690> so<00:02:20.200> it's

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
damage and punching stuff and so it's

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.050

about<00:03:52.600> 30,000<00:03:53.320> so<00:03:54.100> it's<00:03:54.459> another<00:03:54.640> fun<00:03:54.850> one

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
about 30,000 so it's another fun one

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.640 
about 30,000 so it's another fun one
especially<00:03:55.600> for<00:03:55.780> you<00:03:56.170> know<00:03:56.260> something<00:03:56.530> like<00:03:56.620> a

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
especially for you know something like a

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.040 
especially for you know something like a
siren<00:03:57.100> where<00:03:57.220> you<00:03:57.370> got<00:03:57.520> a<00:03:57.690> large<00:03:58.690> amount<00:03:58.990> of

00:03:59.040 --> 00:03:59.050 
siren where you got a large amount of

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:00.720 
siren where you got a large amount of
elemental<00:03:59.470> damage<00:03:59.620> and<00:04:00.040> you<00:04:00.370> know<00:04:00.459> you<00:04:00.580> like

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
elemental damage and you know you like

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:01.830 
elemental damage and you know you like
elemental<00:04:01.150> damage<00:04:01.240> I<00:04:01.600> think<00:04:01.630> it's

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
elemental damage I think it's

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.350 
elemental damage I think it's
entertaining<00:04:02.610> next<00:04:03.610> in<00:04:03.730> our<00:04:03.820> lineup<00:04:04.030> we<00:04:04.330> have

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:04.360 
entertaining next in our lineup we have

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.040 
entertaining next in our lineup we have
the<00:04:05.250> inflammable<00:04:06.250> flame<00:04:06.760> of<00:04:07.120> the<00:04:07.480> fire<00:04:07.510> hawk

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:08.050 
the inflammable flame of the fire hawk

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:11.040 
the inflammable flame of the fire hawk
and<00:04:09.209> not<00:04:10.209> only<00:04:10.390> is<00:04:10.480> it<00:04:10.510> a<00:04:10.600> nova<00:04:10.840> shield

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.050 
and not only is it a nova shield

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:12.780 
and not only is it a nova shield
possibly<00:04:11.590> one<00:04:11.770> of<00:04:11.800> the<00:04:11.890> coolest<00:04:12.220> nova<00:04:12.489> shields

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
possibly one of the coolest nova shields

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:14.880 
possibly one of the coolest nova shields
because<00:04:12.910> when<00:04:13.300> your<00:04:13.420> shield<00:04:13.660> goes<00:04:13.840> down<00:04:14.110> as

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:14.890 
because when your shield goes down as

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:16.740 
because when your shield goes down as
long<00:04:15.070> as<00:04:15.220> it's<00:04:15.370> at<00:04:15.489> zero<00:04:15.760> you<00:04:16.180> will

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
long as it's at zero you will

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.470 
long as it's at zero you will
continually<00:04:17.320> dropping<00:04:17.769> OVAs<00:04:18.010> out<00:04:18.190> and<00:04:18.579> Nova's

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:19.480 
continually dropping OVAs out and Nova's

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.680 
continually dropping OVAs out and Nova's
that<00:04:19.630> are<00:04:19.750> quite<00:04:19.989> brutal<00:04:20.260> at<00:04:20.440> that<00:04:21.510> you<00:04:22.510> can

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
that are quite brutal at that you can

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.660 
that are quite brutal at that you can
see<00:04:22.840> my<00:04:23.020> she<00:04:23.380> went<00:04:23.650> back<00:04:23.770> up<00:04:24.010> so<00:04:24.220> I<00:04:24.250> got<00:04:24.490> one

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:24.670 
see my she went back up so I got one

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:27.270 
see my she went back up so I got one
Nova<00:04:25.030> but<00:04:25.210> trust<00:04:25.720> me<00:04:25.870> it'll<00:04:26.560> keep<00:04:26.800> going<00:04:26.980> off

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
Nova but trust me it'll keep going off

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.460 
Nova but trust me it'll keep going off
as<00:04:27.490> long<00:04:27.730> as<00:04:27.880> your<00:04:28.000> shields<00:04:28.300> at<00:04:28.390> empty<00:04:28.600> I<00:04:28.960> mean

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
as long as your shields at empty I mean

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:30.960 
as long as your shields at empty I mean
you<00:04:29.830> can<00:04:29.950> manage<00:04:30.130> to<00:04:30.220> somehow<00:04:30.400> keep<00:04:30.760> your

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
you can manage to somehow keep your

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.690 
you can manage to somehow keep your
shield<00:04:31.260> empty<00:04:32.260> for<00:04:32.590> an<00:04:32.890> indefinite<00:04:33.130> period<00:04:33.430> of

shield empty for an indefinite period of
time<00:04:33.760> while<00:04:34.240> your<00:04:34.390> health<00:04:34.540> stays<00:04:34.780> up<00:04:35.020> it'd<00:04:35.710> be

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:35.950 
time while your health stays up it'd be

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:38.130 
time while your health stays up it'd be
a<00:04:35.980> pretty<00:04:36.460> baller<00:04:36.820> combination<00:04:37.540> considering

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:38.140 
a pretty baller combination considering

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.200 
a pretty baller combination considering
you'd<00:04:38.320> be<00:04:38.440> constantly<00:04:38.950> doing<00:04:39.250> a<00:04:39.400> you<00:04:40.120> know

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
you'd be constantly doing a you know

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.840 
you'd be constantly doing a you know
close<00:04:40.540> to<00:04:40.690> 90,000<00:04:41.320> AoE<00:04:41.530> so<00:04:42.070> you<00:04:42.610> know<00:04:42.700> if<00:04:42.760> you

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:42.850 
close to 90,000 AoE so you know if you

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:44.460 
close to 90,000 AoE so you know if you
can<00:04:42.970> find<00:04:43.360> a<00:04:43.450> way<00:04:43.540> to<00:04:43.600> do<00:04:43.750> it<00:04:43.870> try<00:04:44.080> it<00:04:44.110> out<00:04:44.230> tell

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
can find a way to do it try it out tell

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.830 
can find a way to do it try it out tell
me<00:04:44.530> how<00:04:44.620> it<00:04:44.710> goes<00:04:44.940> next<00:04:45.940> up<00:04:46.060> we<00:04:46.210> have<00:04:46.240> the<00:04:46.630> black

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
me how it goes next up we have the black

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.530 
me how it goes next up we have the black
hole<00:04:47.170> and<00:04:47.650> this<00:04:48.100> is<00:04:48.250> another<00:04:48.460> fun<00:04:48.730> one<00:04:48.970> telling

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:49.540 
hole and this is another fun one telling

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:50.850 
hole and this is another fun one telling
you<00:04:49.570> some<00:04:49.780> about<00:04:49.960> Molly<00:04:50.170> way<00:04:50.410> and<00:04:50.530> all<00:04:50.680> their

stuff is just so much fun but as you can
guess<00:04:54.220> from<00:04:54.250> the<00:04:54.460> flavor<00:04:54.670> test<00:04:55.200> flavor<00:04:56.200> text

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
guess from the flavor test flavor text

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.040 
guess from the flavor test flavor text
you<00:04:57.130> are<00:04:57.310> the<00:04:57.430> center<00:04:57.730> of<00:04:57.760> the<00:04:57.910> universe<00:04:58.180> the

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
you are the center of the universe the

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:00.480 
you are the center of the universe the
shields<00:04:59.440> basically<00:04:59.890> going<00:05:00.040> to<00:05:00.250> cause<00:05:00.460> a

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490 
shields basically going to cause a

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.790 
shields basically going to cause a
singularity<00:05:01.300> effect<00:05:01.810> when<00:05:02.230> it<00:05:02.350> gets<00:05:02.530> depleted

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 
singularity effect when it gets depleted

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.100 
singularity effect when it gets depleted
that's<00:05:03.280> going<00:05:03.520> to<00:05:03.610> draw<00:05:03.850> a<00:05:04.090> line<00:05:04.150> amis<00:05:04.570> in<00:05:04.720> and

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110 
that's going to draw a line amis in and

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.830 
that's going to draw a line amis in and
then<00:05:05.320> a<00:05:05.350> much<00:05:05.620> cute<00:05:05.920> look<00:05:06.070> so<00:05:06.910> let's<00:05:07.210> uh<00:05:07.300> get

then a much cute look so let's uh get

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.950 
then a much cute look so let's uh get
our<00:05:07.990> friendly<00:05:08.320> bandits<00:05:08.800> to<00:05:08.919> shoot<00:05:09.190> us<00:05:09.960> tell

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 
our friendly bandits to shoot us tell

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.390 
our friendly bandits to shoot us tell
you<00:05:11.080> these<00:05:11.230> bandits<00:05:11.650> are<00:05:11.830> like<00:05:12.040> let's<00:05:12.190> look<00:05:12.280> at

you these bandits are like let's look at
this<00:05:12.520> guy<00:05:12.730> took<00:05:13.270> them<00:05:13.419> like<00:05:13.710> minute<00:05:14.710> to<00:05:14.770> see<00:05:14.919> it

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:15.040 
this guy took them like minute to see it

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:19.430 
as you can see the singularity effect

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:21.490 
as you can see the singularity effect
went<00:05:19.639> off<00:05:19.729> a<00:05:19.759> little<00:05:20.060> bit<00:05:20.180> late<00:05:20.389> but<00:05:20.690> now<00:05:21.410> it

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:21.500 
went off a little bit late but now it

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:22.870 
went off a little bit late but now it
pulls<00:05:21.710> them<00:05:21.860> all<00:05:21.979> in<00:05:22.160> and<00:05:22.310> then<00:05:22.400> the<00:05:22.460> Nova<00:05:22.729> goes

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:22.880 
pulls them all in and then the Nova goes

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.090 
pulls them all in and then the Nova goes
off<00:05:23.090> so<00:05:23.360> in<00:05:24.259> that<00:05:24.410> regard<00:05:24.590> you<00:05:24.860> know<00:05:24.949> it's<00:05:25.070> a

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:25.100 
off so in that regard you know it's a

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:27.430 
off so in that regard you know it's a
nice<00:05:25.250> shield<00:05:25.490> cuz<00:05:25.789> it's<00:05:26.000> gonna<00:05:26.150> you<00:05:26.870> know<00:05:26.930> when

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.440 
nice shield cuz it's gonna you know when

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:28.960 
nice shield cuz it's gonna you know when
you<00:05:27.530> go<00:05:27.680> down<00:05:27.889> if<00:05:28.190> there's<00:05:28.370> enemies<00:05:28.520> nearby

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:28.970 
you go down if there's enemies nearby

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:30.249 
you go down if there's enemies nearby
it's<00:05:29.150> gonna<00:05:29.240> yank<00:05:29.539> them<00:05:29.720> over<00:05:29.930> and<00:05:30.050> then<00:05:30.139> it'll

00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:32.499 
it's gonna yank them over and then it'll
probably<00:05:30.650> kill<00:05:30.889> them<00:05:30.979> for<00:05:31.220> you<00:05:31.370> so<00:05:31.509> that's

00:05:32.499 --> 00:05:32.509 
probably kill them for you so that's

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:34.450 
probably kill them for you so that's
pretty<00:05:32.690> legit<00:05:33.110> and<00:05:33.590> on<00:05:33.830> top<00:05:34.009> of<00:05:34.039> that<00:05:34.190> if<00:05:34.370> it

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:34.460 
pretty legit and on top of that if it

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.550 
pretty legit and on top of that if it
doesn't<00:05:34.820> I<00:05:34.880> mean<00:05:35.120> everybody<00:05:36.110> hates<00:05:36.380> those

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:36.560 
doesn't I mean everybody hates those

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.200 
doesn't I mean everybody hates those
enemies<00:05:36.919> that<00:05:37.009> just<00:05:37.190> run<00:05:37.400> away<00:05:37.490> so<00:05:37.669> having

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:38.210 
enemies that just run away so having

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:39.700 
enemies that just run away so having
your<00:05:38.449> shield<00:05:38.720> you<00:05:38.840> can<00:05:39.050> come<00:05:39.199> back<00:05:39.350> to<00:05:39.560> you

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:39.710 
your shield you can come back to you

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:43.120 
your shield you can come back to you
when<00:05:39.830> you<00:05:39.949> go<00:05:40.070> down<00:05:40.250> is<00:05:40.490> pretty<00:05:41.240> handy<00:05:42.130> let's

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:43.130 
when you go down is pretty handy let's

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:45.189 
when you go down is pretty handy let's
see<00:05:43.340> we<00:05:43.490> got<00:05:43.610> two<00:05:43.940> left<00:05:44.240> in<00:05:44.449> our<00:05:44.539> series<00:05:44.900> here

00:05:45.189 --> 00:05:45.199 
see we got two left in our series here

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:47.770 
see we got two left in our series here
we<00:05:45.440> have<00:05:45.590> the<00:05:45.770> fabled<00:05:46.190> tortoise<00:05:46.449> which<00:05:47.449> as<00:05:47.660> you

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:47.780 
we have the fabled tortoise which as you

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:50.320 
we have the fabled tortoise which as you
can<00:05:47.810> see<00:05:47.960> is<00:05:48.350> a<00:05:48.820> ridiculous<00:05:49.820> shield<00:05:50.180> capacity

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:50.330 
can see is a ridiculous shield capacity

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:55.810 
can see is a ridiculous shield capacity
and<00:05:52.270> only<00:05:53.270> 15,000<00:05:53.990> max<00:05:54.139> health<00:05:54.380> but<00:05:55.160> uh<00:05:55.190> as<00:05:55.639> you

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:55.820 
and only 15,000 max health but uh as you

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:57.490 
and only 15,000 max health but uh as you
can<00:05:56.000> guess<00:05:56.150> from<00:05:56.180> the<00:05:56.479> tortoise<00:05:56.810> your

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:57.500 
can guess from the tortoise your

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.640 
can guess from the tortoise your
movement<00:05:58.039> speed<00:05:58.990> so<00:05:59.990> this<00:06:00.110> is<00:06:00.229> the<00:06:00.320> walking

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:00.650 
movement speed so this is the walking

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:03.270 
movement speed so this is the walking
speed<00:06:00.800> with<00:06:01.039> it<00:06:01.220> this<00:06:02.000> is<00:06:02.060> the<00:06:02.300> running<00:06:02.840> speed

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:03.280 
speed with it this is the running speed

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:06.430 
speed with it this is the running speed
as<00:06:04.280> you<00:06:04.460> can<00:06:04.610> see<00:06:04.820> I'm<00:06:04.970> quite<00:06:05.330> slow<00:06:05.750> but<00:06:06.080> I<00:06:06.229> mean

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:06.440 
as you can see I'm quite slow but I mean

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:07.629 
as you can see I'm quite slow but I mean
hey<00:06:06.590> that's<00:06:06.740> the<00:06:06.830> price<00:06:06.979> you<00:06:07.100> gotta<00:06:07.250> pay<00:06:07.310> for
