this<00:00:01.209> marks<00:00:01.630> a<00:00:01.839> somewhat<00:00:02.350> exciting<00:00:02.920> milestone

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:03.100 
this marks a somewhat exciting milestone

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.510 
this marks a somewhat exciting milestone
in<00:00:03.489> my<00:00:03.520> life<00:00:03.639> in<00:00:04.350> one<00:00:05.350> sense<00:00:05.650> it's<00:00:06.280> no

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:06.520 
in my life in one sense it's no

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.460 
in my life in one sense it's no
different<00:00:06.940> than<00:00:06.970> pulling<00:00:07.840> an<00:00:08.049> engine<00:00:08.350> out<00:00:08.440> of

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:08.470 
different than pulling an engine out of

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:13.169 
different than pulling an engine out of
other<00:00:08.680> vehicles<00:00:09.210> but<00:00:10.260> this<00:00:11.260> is<00:00:11.410> my<00:00:11.650> first<00:00:12.179> it's

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:13.179 
other vehicles but this is my first it's

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:15.720 
other vehicles but this is my first it's
actually<00:00:13.300> a<00:00:13.510> milestone<00:00:13.840> in<00:00:14.110> two<00:00:14.380> ways<00:00:14.590> to<00:00:15.400> sex

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:15.730 
actually a milestone in two ways to sex

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.229 
actually a milestone in two ways to sex
um<00:00:16.230> my<00:00:17.230> first<00:00:17.470> time<00:00:17.679> pulling<00:00:18.099> an<00:00:18.310> engine<00:00:18.909> from

00:00:19.229 --> 00:00:19.239 
um my first time pulling an engine from

00:00:19.239 --> 00:00:22.739 
um my first time pulling an engine from
a<00:00:19.800> transversely<00:00:20.800> mounted<00:00:20.890> vehicle<00:00:21.640> this<00:00:22.509> is<00:00:22.720> a

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:22.749 
a transversely mounted vehicle this is a

00:00:22.749 --> 00:00:27.149 
a transversely mounted vehicle this is a
99<00:00:23.349> Chevy<00:00:24.039> Malibu<00:00:24.699> no<00:00:25.149> a<00:00:25.179> 98<00:00:25.659> Chevy<00:00:25.689> Malibu<00:00:26.289> you

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:27.159 
99 Chevy Malibu no a 98 Chevy Malibu you

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:28.829 
99 Chevy Malibu no a 98 Chevy Malibu you
could<00:00:27.310> see<00:00:27.489> my<00:00:27.609> breath<00:00:27.759> coming<00:00:28.329> across<00:00:28.539> the

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:28.839 
could see my breath coming across the

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:33.390 
could see my breath coming across the
front<00:00:29.079> of<00:00:29.169> the<00:00:29.259> camera<00:00:29.640> anyway<00:00:30.989> um<00:00:32.250> yeah<00:00:33.250> it's

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:33.400 
front of the camera anyway um yeah it's

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.810 
front of the camera anyway um yeah it's
cold<00:00:33.610> out<00:00:33.760> so<00:00:35.190> first<00:00:36.190> of<00:00:36.310> all<00:00:36.370> is<00:00:36.490> my<00:00:36.580> first

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:36.820 
cold out so first of all is my first

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:37.950 
cold out so first of all is my first
time<00:00:36.910> pulling<00:00:37.240> a<00:00:37.300> transversely<00:00:37.840> mounted

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:37.960 
time pulling a transversely mounted

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.680 
time pulling a transversely mounted
engine<00:00:38.620> it<00:00:39.250> is<00:00:39.310> also<00:00:39.790> my<00:00:39.940> first<00:00:40.120> time<00:00:40.270> pulling

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:40.690 
engine it is also my first time pulling

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.890 
engine it is also my first time pulling
an<00:00:40.750> engine<00:00:41.050> from<00:00:41.170> an<00:00:41.350> automatic<00:00:41.770> transmission

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:42.900 
an engine from an automatic transmission

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.360 
an engine from an automatic transmission
fortunately<00:00:43.900> it<00:00:44.050> isn't<00:00:44.410> automatic<00:00:44.860> because<00:00:45.310> I

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:45.370 
fortunately it isn't automatic because I

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.840 
fortunately it isn't automatic because I
needed<00:00:45.850> to<00:00:45.970> get<00:00:46.150> that<00:00:47.080> much<00:00:47.890> clearance<00:00:48.430> away

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:48.850 
needed to get that much clearance away

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.150 
needed to get that much clearance away
from<00:00:49.090> the<00:00:49.210> transmission<00:00:49.630> that's<00:00:50.350> my<00:00:50.680> space<00:00:50.920> on

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:51.160 
from the transmission that's my space on

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.530 
from the transmission that's my space on
the<00:00:51.280> side<00:00:51.490> you<00:00:51.610> can<00:00:51.700> see<00:00:51.760> how<00:00:51.880> tight<00:00:52.000> that<00:00:52.329> is

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:52.540 
the side you can see how tight that is

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.290 
the side you can see how tight that is
it<00:00:53.050> just<00:00:53.290> got<00:00:53.440> space<00:00:53.680> for<00:00:53.710> the<00:00:53.950> Flex<00:00:54.190> joint<00:00:54.460> and

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:55.300 
it just got space for the Flex joint and

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.740 
it just got space for the Flex joint and
on<00:00:55.810> the<00:00:55.960> other<00:00:56.230> side<00:00:56.530> of<00:00:56.650> the<00:00:56.740> engine<00:00:56.890> all<00:00:57.850> of

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:58.750 
on the other side of the engine all of

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.910 
on the other side of the engine all of
my<00:00:58.960> clearance<00:00:59.940> right<00:01:00.940> there<00:01:01.500> so<00:01:02.500> if<00:01:02.590> this<00:01:02.710> was

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
my clearance right there so if this was

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.639 
my clearance right there so if this was
a<00:01:02.950> manual<00:01:03.310> and<00:01:03.749> transmission<00:01:04.749> I<00:01:04.929> would<00:01:05.560> have

00:01:05.639 --> 00:01:05.649 
a manual and transmission I would have

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:07.770 
a manual and transmission I would have
had<00:01:05.799> to<00:01:05.920> pull<00:01:06.130> both<00:01:06.579> the<00:01:06.640> engine<00:01:07.179> and<00:01:07.210> the

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:07.780 
had to pull both the engine and the

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:08.459 
had to pull both the engine and the
transmission

00:01:08.459 --> 00:01:08.469 
transmission

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:11.069 
transmission
to<00:01:09.159> get<00:01:09.280> this<00:01:09.429> thing<00:01:09.640> out<00:01:09.819> but<00:01:10.210> it's<00:01:10.569> not<00:01:10.780> it's

00:01:11.069 --> 00:01:11.079 
to get this thing out but it's not it's

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:15.300 
to get this thing out but it's not it's
an<00:01:11.140> automatic<00:01:12.420> so<00:01:13.420> that's<00:01:13.719> my<00:01:14.619> accomplishment

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
an automatic so that's my accomplishment

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.209 
an automatic so that's my accomplishment
first<00:01:15.639> time<00:01:15.880> with<00:01:16.659> the<00:01:16.780> transverse<00:01:17.560> axle

00:01:18.209 --> 00:01:18.219 
first time with the transverse axle

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:19.620 
first time with the transverse axle
first<00:01:18.579> time<00:01:18.850> with<00:01:19.210> an<00:01:19.299> automatic

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
first time with an automatic

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:28.510 
first time with an automatic
transmission<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:21.340> it's<00:01:22.090> coming<00:01:22.450> out<00:01:25.829> that<00:01:26.829> is

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
transmission and it's coming out that is

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:35.649 
transmission and it's coming out that is
engine<00:01:29.360> removal<00:01:29.870> inaction<00:01:30.890> I<00:01:34.540> think<00:01:35.540> I'm

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
engine removal inaction I think I'm

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:37.270 
engine removal inaction I think I'm
hooked<00:01:35.869> on<00:01:35.990> a<00:01:36.049> wire<00:01:36.260> so<00:01:36.500> I<00:01:36.530> better<00:01:36.740> let<00:01:36.920> you<00:01:36.979> go

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
hooked on a wire so I better let you go

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.430 
hooked on a wire so I better let you go
make<00:01:38.180> sure<00:01:38.210> that<00:01:38.420> this<00:01:38.600> comes<00:01:38.869> out<00:01:39.020> properly

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.440 
make sure that this comes out properly

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.510 
make sure that this comes out properly
it's<00:01:40.369> gone<00:01:41.200> yeah<00:01:42.200> I<00:01:42.440> forgot<00:01:42.920> to<00:01:43.100> disconnect

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
it's gone yeah I forgot to disconnect

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.230 
it's gone yeah I forgot to disconnect
the<00:01:43.700> fuel<00:01:43.909> lines<00:01:44.180> so<00:01:44.630> there<00:01:45.619> it<00:01:45.770> is<00:01:45.890> these<00:01:46.820> are

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
the fuel lines so there it is these are

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.030 
the fuel lines so there it is these are
the<00:01:47.360> bolts<00:01:47.540> that<00:01:47.780> are<00:01:47.930> hard<00:01:48.110> to<00:01:48.200> get<00:01:48.440> and<00:01:48.740> I'll

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
the bolts that are hard to get and I'll

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.940 
the bolts that are hard to get and I'll
show<00:01:49.759> this<00:01:50.060> to<00:01:50.330> you<00:01:50.479> so<00:01:51.470> that<00:01:51.619> if<00:01:51.710> you're<00:01:51.830> doing

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
it yourself you know where these are

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.190 
it yourself you know where these are
there's<00:01:54.080> these<00:01:54.290> two<00:01:54.350> here<00:01:55.659> to<00:01:56.659> get<00:01:56.869> these<00:01:57.140> I

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
there's these two here to get these I

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.260 
there's these two here to get these I
crawled<00:01:57.680> down<00:01:57.860> underneath<00:01:58.220> and<00:01:59.530> I<00:02:01.270> don't

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
crawled down underneath and I don't

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.200 
crawled down underneath and I don't
remember<00:02:02.509> I<00:02:02.810> think<00:02:03.050> I<00:02:03.380> used<00:02:03.649> oh<00:02:04.250> yeah<00:02:04.970> I<00:02:05.000> use

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
remember I think I used oh yeah I use

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.380 
remember I think I used oh yeah I use
sockets<00:02:05.750> on<00:02:05.899> these<00:02:06.110> with<00:02:06.770> a<00:02:07.070> swivel<00:02:07.490> joint<00:02:07.700> so

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
sockets on these with a swivel joint so

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.779 
sockets on these with a swivel joint so
I<00:02:08.450> can<00:02:08.630> just<00:02:08.810> slightly<00:02:09.080> deflect<00:02:09.679> up<00:02:09.920> over<00:02:10.429> this

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
I can just slightly deflect up over this

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.180 
I can just slightly deflect up over this
boot<00:02:11.720> and<00:02:12.050> I<00:02:12.230> was<00:02:12.560> able<00:02:12.650> to<00:02:12.739> get<00:02:12.860> in<00:02:12.980> from<00:02:13.160> the

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
boot and I was able to get in from the

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.040 
boot and I was able to get in from the
other<00:02:13.310> end<00:02:13.550> and<00:02:13.640> get<00:02:13.790> both<00:02:13.970> of<00:02:14.000> these<00:02:14.239> and<00:02:14.570> then

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
other end and get both of these and then

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.630 
other end and get both of these and then
there's<00:02:15.260> this<00:02:15.470> one<00:02:15.680> down<00:02:15.860> here<00:02:15.920> and<00:02:16.370> that<00:02:16.489> was

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
there's this one down here and that was

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.759 
there's this one down here and that was
an<00:02:16.760> easy<00:02:16.970> shot<00:02:17.330> up<00:02:17.510> from<00:02:17.540> the<00:02:17.780> bottom<00:02:17.900> the

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:18.769 
an easy shot up from the bottom the

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:20.740 
an easy shot up from the bottom the
other<00:02:18.800> one<00:02:19.160> that's<00:02:19.250> difficult<00:02:19.550> is<00:02:20.000> this<00:02:20.510> one

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
other one that's difficult is this one

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.740 
other one that's difficult is this one
right<00:02:21.050> here<00:02:21.110> at<00:02:21.380> the<00:02:21.470> bottom<00:02:22.420> on<00:02:23.420> the<00:02:23.720> bottom

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
right here at the bottom on the bottom

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.270 
right here at the bottom on the bottom
side<00:02:24.400> right<00:02:25.400> where<00:02:25.820> my<00:02:26.239> fingers<00:02:26.480> right<00:02:26.569> there

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
side right where my fingers right there

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.500 
side right where my fingers right there
what<00:02:28.280> I<00:02:28.310> did<00:02:28.610> is<00:02:29.600> I<00:02:30.110> got<00:02:30.260> extensions<00:02:30.769> and<00:02:31.510> I

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
what I did is I got extensions and I

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.300 
what I did is I got extensions and I
went<00:02:33.200> down<00:02:33.380> in<00:02:33.500> the<00:02:33.560> wheel<00:02:33.709> well<00:02:33.920> over<00:02:34.160> there

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
went down in the wheel well over there

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.729 
went down in the wheel well over there
and<00:02:34.489> sent<00:02:35.450> the<00:02:35.570> extensions<00:02:36.140> all<00:02:36.410> the<00:02:36.650> way

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:36.739 
and sent the extensions all the way

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:39.250 
and sent the extensions all the way
across<00:02:37.070> the<00:02:37.310> back<00:02:37.430> of<00:02:37.489> the<00:02:37.730> engine<00:02:37.910> to<00:02:38.329> that

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
across the back of the engine to that

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:40.840 
across the back of the engine to that
bolt<00:02:39.530> because<00:02:39.769> this<00:02:39.920> one<00:02:40.100> bolts<00:02:40.370> in<00:02:40.489> from<00:02:40.670> this

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
bolt because this one bolts in from this

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.330 
bolt because this one bolts in from this
side<00:02:40.930> obviously<00:02:41.930> can't<00:02:42.680> from<00:02:42.890> the<00:02:42.980> other<00:02:43.100> side

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
side obviously can't from the other side

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.520 
side obviously can't from the other side
there's<00:02:43.579> a<00:02:43.640> transmission<00:02:44.060> so<00:02:45.049> I<00:02:45.079> ran<00:02:45.380> the

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
there's a transmission so I ran the

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.310 
there's a transmission so I ran the
extension<00:02:45.980> across<00:02:46.340> this<00:02:46.840> right<00:02:47.840> through<00:02:48.019> here

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
extension across this right through here

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.840 
extension across this right through here
along<00:02:48.980> this<00:02:49.220> valley<00:02:49.519> and<00:02:50.290> to<00:02:51.290> the<00:02:51.410> bolt<00:02:51.850> so

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
along this valley and to the bolt so

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.030 
along this valley and to the bolt so
it's<00:02:53.120> actually<00:02:53.510> not<00:02:53.630> a<00:02:53.690> hard<00:02:53.959> one<00:02:54.500> to<00:02:54.560> feed

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
it's actually not a hard one to feed

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.740 
it's actually not a hard one to feed
through<00:02:55.430> because<00:02:55.820> of<00:02:55.910> that<00:02:56.030> valley<00:02:56.329> it's

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
through because of that valley it's

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.500 
through because of that valley it's
fairly<00:02:57.200> easy<00:02:57.500> to<00:02:57.620> find<00:02:57.920> and<00:02:58.280> you<00:02:59.030> do<00:02:59.150> it<00:02:59.269> all<00:02:59.360> by

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
fairly easy to find and you do it all by

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:00.910 
fairly easy to find and you do it all by
faith<00:02:59.750> just<00:03:00.110> feeling<00:03:00.440> around<00:03:00.530> with<00:03:00.799> your

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
faith just feeling around with your

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.640 
faith just feeling around with your
fingers

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
fingers

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.759 
fingers
these<00:03:03.650> two<00:03:04.310> are<00:03:04.640> fairly<00:03:04.970> easy<00:03:05.269> to<00:03:05.420> get<00:03:05.769> those

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:06.769 
these two are fairly easy to get those

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:10.960 
these two are fairly easy to get those
two<00:03:06.829> in<00:03:07.640> from<00:03:07.970> this<00:03:08.120> side<00:03:09.459> these<00:03:10.459> two<00:03:10.519> are<00:03:10.850> not

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
two in from this side these two are not

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.580 
two in from this side these two are not
too<00:03:11.090> bad<00:03:11.299> this<00:03:11.630> one<00:03:11.840> right<00:03:11.959> here<00:03:12.200> is<00:03:12.320> hard

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
too bad this one right here is hard

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.830 
too bad this one right here is hard
because<00:03:12.799> of<00:03:12.950> the<00:03:13.100> trans<00:03:13.910> bracket<00:03:14.329> here<00:03:14.540> that

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
because of the trans bracket here that

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.870 
because of the trans bracket here that
you<00:03:14.959> just<00:03:14.989> remove<00:03:15.440> that<00:03:15.519> and<00:03:16.519> then<00:03:16.609> you've<00:03:16.730> got

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
you just remove that and then you've got

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.789 
you just remove that and then you've got
an<00:03:17.000> easy<00:03:17.230> shot<00:03:18.230> to<00:03:18.440> that<00:03:18.620> so<00:03:19.549> there's<00:03:19.790> the

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
an easy shot to that so there's the

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:25.120 
an easy shot to that so there's the
torque<00:03:21.799> converter<00:03:21.950> and<00:03:22.340> all<00:03:22.700> that<00:03:23.709> but<00:03:24.709> it's

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
torque converter and all that but it's

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.949 
torque converter and all that but it's
out<00:03:25.459> and<00:03:26.440> here's<00:03:27.440> where<00:03:27.829> I<00:03:27.859> start<00:03:28.190> tomorrow

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
out and here's where I start tomorrow

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.539 
out and here's where I start tomorrow
there's<00:03:29.959> the<00:03:30.320> engine<00:03:30.560> I<00:03:30.620> just<00:03:30.829> pulled<00:03:31.100> there's

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:31.549 
there's the engine I just pulled there's

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:33.699 
there's the engine I just pulled there's
the<00:03:31.760> engine<00:03:32.000> it's<00:03:32.150> going<00:03:32.480> in<00:03:32.600> it<00:03:32.750> and<00:03:32.900> I<00:03:33.470> got<00:03:33.620> to

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
the engine it's going in it and I got to

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:36.520 
the engine it's going in it and I got to
start<00:03:33.920> pulling<00:03:34.220> parts<00:03:34.700> from<00:03:34.940> this<00:03:35.720> guy<00:03:36.019> and

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
start pulling parts from this guy and

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:37.509 
start pulling parts from this guy and
put<00:03:36.560> them<00:03:36.799> on<00:03:36.889> there<00:03:37.100> soft

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:37.519 
put them on there soft

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:39.460 
put them on there soft
bring<00:03:37.880> them<00:03:37.970> both<00:03:38.090> up<00:03:38.359> on<00:03:38.449> the<00:03:38.600> bench<00:03:38.989> side<00:03:39.320> by

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
bring them both up on the bench side by

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.680 
bring them both up on the bench side by
side
