00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 welcome to another 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:06.359
 dismantling as it is already so far again 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.519
 the third already for august and says 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.010
 is the new player profile for us 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.870
 have been presented and also can 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.759
 Now we are sure this is one 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.350
 singleplayer a singleplayer 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.119
 Expansion is there but I climb 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.220
 just started the first day with the 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.189
 player profile on the player profile 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.840
 recognizable is the clear so the 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.490
 clear status if you clear member small 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.710
 oldest or clear leader is then 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.119
 once the cup points the league symbol 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.859
 then we can fight you in how many 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.690
 who has won as many 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.980
 defenses he has won as many 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.899
 donated troops and how many troops 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.160
 We also received 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.899
 from there directly to his clear 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.719
 Watch and directly to his village to 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.190
 grab also will be displayed there as 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.690
 he achieved his accomplishments 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.730
 means how far is he at the 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.100
 Achievement because gold camp on stage 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.899
 10 to give up that one sees the 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.460
 case he already has three stars and 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.079
 quite cool to recognize is the bottom 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.300
 gray text if now the lower left 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.329
 lower left achievement looks at the 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:03.480
 big and better and there is upgrade town 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.430
 hall to level aid that means one should 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.080
 his his town hall on level eight 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.430
 upgrade and then you get right here 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.159
 the third star below underneath stands 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.080
 current townhall level ten coals 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.299
 means means the current or the 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.790
 the player just has the town hall 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.560
 or the town hall level is just level 10 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.920
 is quite interesting as to see whether the 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.409
 then in the things like the total 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.450
 gold talked or total elixir talked 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.570
 if then there is displayed as well 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.340
 a lot of gold I completely elixir 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.960
 he fought he plays r rated though 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.850
 I already had the three stars that was 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.799
 so far not to be recognized by whom 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.619
 you can see this player profiles the 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.450
 At the moment I think I only know 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.399
 its own clan members if it is then 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.200
 at some point applies to everyone else 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.310
 that I look at other people like that 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.509
 I do not know that as far as I can 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.610
 that's right now 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.409
 First only on clan members 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.729
 limited as you there to this 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.590
 menu comes see you right again 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.420
 simply the plan the clan member 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.399
 press then comes either profile or 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.890
 visit that means visit once or 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.540
 just stood on the player profile earlier 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.930
 just listen as well as visit him 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.250
 Often I have already announced 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.370
 read before me this before 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.220
 we noticed that we have a new one 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.740
 single more with singleplayer 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.060
 or maps and quite 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.100
 can recognize this by the new 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.540
 orleans was an example 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:24.110
 take out a firefighter I have it 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:26.930
 that's why firefighter destroy 5000 circles 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.270
 removed house in multiplayer battles was 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:32.000
 that means 5000 in from 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:34.760
 the inferno towers in multiplayer so 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.560
 destroy in online fight 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.090
 and of course the 5000 m are the 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.990
 to get third star and there must 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.120
 to notice once 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:43.940
 There are currently in the single player 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.580
 no distance gate that means that 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.200
 that they write inferno great that one 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.300
 the distance gate in the multiplayer 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.550
 it can mean destroy it now 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:55.010
 single player must come out where it is 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.260
 The same applies inferno tor 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.970
 by the way, below also for the xbox 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.959
 terminator there is the same thing with the 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.280
 multiplayer again 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:03.440
 that means we can be very excited 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.750
 how will get 100 percent new 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.750
 singleplayer i dont know if in this one 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.160
 update but I 'm afraid of it 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.680
 Now I come to the famous question 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.820
 yes single player or player profile what 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.830
 you find better living in the 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.209
 Comments comment line is that's 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.640
 place for that and otherwise you can 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:22.580
 Of course, always follow on twitter 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.950

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.700
 video as soon as I know more and up 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.560
 I also wish one for that 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:31.099
 beautiful day matthew 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.099
