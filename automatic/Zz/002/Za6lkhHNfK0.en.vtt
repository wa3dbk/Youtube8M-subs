00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:13.890
 although we are going to make some chips for 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:17.640
 accompany a chicken not happen here I have 

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:22.560
 four legs cut in 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:26.960
 in small squares and this to this 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.960
 let's add onion equal 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:34.800
 let's add tomato we're going to 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:37.620
 add a pp and we will add 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.870
 one onion 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.620
 as I said a little while ago and then we're going 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:48.000
 to accompany with a salad of lettuce 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.980
 with fresh broccoli and with another one this 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.890
 from Jamaica dear we will be watching 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.310
 there good I'm going to then it's starting 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:01:00.290
 of this and right now I teach you 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:02.750
 and here why are we going to talk a little bit and 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:05.309
 now we are going to put the chips 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:10.860
 the taste will also come 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:14.670
 although now to remove potatoes onions in 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.979
 this Julian style and then the success 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.170
 that we had put him after a year 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.939
 we're going to be here a little bit longer 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.820
 then to add to the other things 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:27.610
 what would be the pp and the tomato 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:32.290
 now it's now I'm breaking the tomato 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:35.260
 and we're breaking it in halves 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:37.570
 for example we split half that would be 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:40.900
 One half of this we will start again 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:43.900
 about another half and then we do the 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.280
 cuts depends on you and then so 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.930
 because I like this presentation in 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.509
 particular but you can use 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:53.070
 any cut that you like that does not go 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:53.070
 to alter the product 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:59.700
 Now let's put a part of that 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:02.470
 after it has been cut we are going to put 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:06.580
 here to her husband 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:08.050
 this nothing else later I'm going to wear this 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.240
 parked 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:14.350
 and this fact there is already a minute to show 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:17.830
 why then obviously this has salt 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:21.880
 well one's taste and we're also going to 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:24.130
 put pepper and I can put 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.850
 be ground you have the normal 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.850
 this way 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:37.440
 now I have put on and you put a 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:37.440
 little bit and this green is dry parsley 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.480
 so let's go now just wait 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.370
 that the parents are soft and well 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.990
 I'm up to eternity 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.660
 now we only put cheese and 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:53.290
 let's hope it melts and then this already 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:55.180
 is and well, as I said, I'm going to 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.240
 accompany with a chicken and salad 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.040
 He's wearing jamaica and this is not 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.590
 It is necessary to make rice because 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.080
 the potatoes are the same 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.490
 carbohydrates that rice has 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.900
 so then I hope you have a good 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:10.090
 profit and says more than that is a good 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.870
 Accompaniment for some main dish 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.870
 that they are going to do
