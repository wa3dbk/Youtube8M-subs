00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.340
 good morning everyone review today 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:12.240
 it's about the rom line, or some kind of leak 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:14.730
 ping pot only of max however multi-purpose 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.010
 they are therefore part of the pro line 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.140
 found exclusively in the pro stores 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.420
 you can then order them too 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.590
 by phone because but what how 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:29.369
 you know it even sends via phone enough 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:32.130
 pay cash on delivery through 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:36.450
 bartolini there are new colors and 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:41.040
 13 Their price is 21 euro each and 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:43.170
 there are 5 milliliters of product are 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.020
 products designed for professionals 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.660
 so they are meant for those who can 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.190
 use them on the eyes on the cheeks 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.180
 on the lips 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.469
 we also say how or products for 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:01:00.000
 use them point to do face painting 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:02.609
 all a little more creative versatile 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:07.350
 in short, unfortunately, in the shooting that comes out 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:09.420
 along with this sort of ping pot there is 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.570
 written that many colors cannot be 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.380
 use neither on the eyes put on 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:20.070
 lips probably also because they are 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:22.799
 stain you see a little stain though 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.700
 however with a two-phase make-up remover the 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.340
 everything goes away 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.950
 I asked a mac make-up artist 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.320
 because you sure do 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.990
 possible use this sort of a 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.180
 eyeshadow on the eyes 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.729
 she told me that anyway she does exercise 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.820
 own allergy but kingmax advice 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:46.320
 to the use of these these days 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:48.720
 of this chroma line the eyes on 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.509
 lips some colors are less opaque 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.600
 the others for example blue as you can 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.380
 see also how to line 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:59.030
 it is not covering most people 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:02.690
 they use black black that is 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:06.280
 the mere neck for highland and why 3 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:09.950
 liner because it costs less respect 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:13.370
 to the other to the beautiful black trek at the eyeliner 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:16.459
 real but there are more mld blacks 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:19.100
 then set once dry 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:21.380
 these too are ultimately fixed 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:24.110
 I don't recommend them because they are 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:27.319
 difficult to use are excellent 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.209
 professionally but until now I have 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:31.160
 found it difficult to use them 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:34.100
 simply because I'm afraid that 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:37.280
 can give allergy to the person who 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:42.170
 make-up therefore excellent for making drawings 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:44.569
 artistic but poor, that is they do not go 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.209
 good for other uses then as a basis 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:48.530
 makeup etcetera and all I hope 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:49.850
 that this video was helpful to you 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.510
 today we see to the next 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.510
 Hello
