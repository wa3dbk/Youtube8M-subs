very versatile
it's<00:04:57.010> very<00:04:57.280> versatile<00:04:57.790> in<00:04:58.510> that<00:04:58.720> situation<00:04:59.350> in

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
it's very versatile in that situation in

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:01.800 
it's very versatile in that situation in
the<00:05:00.010> bigger<00:05:00.190> one<00:05:00.460> you<00:05:00.730> have<00:05:00.880> your<00:05:01.060> pliers<00:05:01.360> yeah

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:03.550 
if your metal saw so you're pretty much

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.510 
if your metal saw so you're pretty much
set<00:05:04.180> for<00:05:04.510> like<00:05:04.750> beginning<00:05:05.680> tools<00:05:05.890> or<00:05:06.160> tools<00:05:06.400> to

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
set up your camp with you could go from

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.990 
set up your camp with you could go from
there<00:05:10.480> and<00:05:10.510> expand<00:05:11.290> you<00:05:11.920> can<00:05:12.100> after<00:05:12.640> that

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.000 
there and expand you can after that

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.940 
there and expand you can after that
you're<00:05:13.450> settled<00:05:13.960> you<00:05:14.350> know<00:05:14.380> you<00:05:14.560> can<00:05:14.710> find

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:14.950 
you're settled you know you can find

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:17.550 
you're settled you know you can find
your<00:05:15.130> stuff<00:05:15.400> I<00:05:16.180> think<00:05:16.600> it's<00:05:17.020> a<00:05:17.140> little<00:05:17.380> better

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560 
your stuff I think it's a little better

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.100 
your stuff I think it's a little better
I<00:05:17.800> mean<00:05:18.400> I<00:05:18.550> would<00:05:18.790> still<00:05:19.120> prefer<00:05:19.390> at<00:05:19.750> least<00:05:19.960> a

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.110 
I mean I would still prefer at least a

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:22.610 
I mean I would still prefer at least a
fixed<00:05:20.380> blade<00:05:20.530> or<00:05:20.770> maybe<00:05:21.040> my<00:05:21.250> endure<00:05:21.550> afore<00:05:21.910> but

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:22.620 
fixed blade or maybe my endure afore but

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:24.510 
fixed blade or maybe my endure afore but
you<00:05:23.620> know<00:05:23.710> it's<00:05:23.830> better<00:05:24.010> than<00:05:24.190> just<00:05:24.370> having

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:24.520 
you know it's better than just having

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:27.330 
you know it's better than just having
like<00:05:24.730> a<00:05:24.790> single<00:05:25.150> blade<00:05:25.300> for<00:05:25.570> example<00:05:25.930> this<00:05:26.340> you

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:27.340 
like a single blade for example this you

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:29.360 
like a single blade for example this you
know<00:05:27.460> there's<00:05:27.670> a<00:05:27.760> philosophy<00:05:28.300> do<00:05:28.420> this<00:05:28.600> but

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.370 
know there's a philosophy do this but

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:33.000 
know there's a philosophy do this but
this<00:05:30.370> thing<00:05:30.610> is<00:05:30.880> short<00:05:31.390> reached<00:05:31.660> I<00:05:32.020> I<00:05:32.500> would

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:33.010 
this thing is short reached I I would

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:34.770 
this thing is short reached I I would
definitely<00:05:33.400> support<00:05:33.520> this<00:05:33.910> over<00:05:34.210> this<00:05:34.330> this

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:34.780 
definitely support this over this this

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:37.200 
definitely support this over this this
thing<00:05:34.930> can<00:05:35.050> only<00:05:35.200> do<00:05:35.560> one<00:05:36.370> function<00:05:36.850> which<00:05:36.880> is

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:37.210 
thing can only do one function which is

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:38.880 
thing can only do one function which is
cut<00:05:37.480> stuff<00:05:37.810> like<00:05:37.960> a<00:05:37.990> knife<00:05:38.200> I<00:05:38.440> mean<00:05:38.710> I<00:05:38.830> know

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:40.230 
cut stuff like a knife I mean I know
knives<00:05:39.250> can<00:05:39.400> do<00:05:39.520> a<00:05:39.550> bunch<00:05:39.700> of<00:05:39.820> functions<00:05:40.060> but

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240 
knives can do a bunch of functions but

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:48.190 
tree down and again back to the tree I'm

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:49.680 
tree down and again back to the tree I'm
probably<00:05:48.520> not<00:05:48.700> gonna<00:05:48.820> be<00:05:48.940> able<00:05:49.030> to<00:05:49.150> put<00:05:49.330> onto<00:05:49.510> a

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:49.690 
probably not gonna be able to put onto a

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:52.470 
probably not gonna be able to put onto a
tree<00:05:49.930> with<00:05:50.110> this<00:05:50.290> but<00:05:50.640> with<00:05:51.640> some<00:05:51.880> time<00:05:52.150> and<00:05:52.420> I

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:52.480 
tree with this but with some time and I

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:53.910 
tree with this but with some time and I
have<00:05:52.720> done<00:05:52.960> this<00:05:53.080> before<00:05:53.230> I've<00:05:53.620> gotten

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:53.920 
have done this before I've gotten

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.460 
have done this before I've gotten
through<00:05:54.070> tree<00:05:54.370> about<00:05:54.940> this<00:05:55.180> big<00:05:55.450> with<00:05:55.990> this

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:56.470 
through tree about this big with this

00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:01.500 
through tree about this big with this
saw<00:05:56.770> and<00:05:58.410> guys<00:05:59.410> you<00:05:59.830> see<00:06:00.040> what<00:06:00.220> I'm<00:06:00.340> saying<00:06:00.670> you

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:01.510 
saw and guys you see what I'm saying you

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:03.060 
saw and guys you see what I'm saying you
could<00:06:01.660> get<00:06:01.840> through<00:06:02.110> you<00:06:02.590> just<00:06:02.620> have<00:06:02.860> to<00:06:02.950> be

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:03.070 
could get through you just have to be

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:04.530 
could get through you just have to be
creative<00:06:03.220> I<00:06:03.610> mean<00:06:03.880> you're<00:06:04.000> not<00:06:04.180> gonna<00:06:04.330> be

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:04.540 
creative I mean you're not gonna be

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:06.210 
creative I mean you're not gonna be
baton<00:06:04.930> through<00:06:05.230> this<00:06:05.350> like<00:06:05.680> if<00:06:05.860> I<00:06:05.950> had<00:06:06.070> my

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:06.220 
baton through this like if I had my

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:07.530 
baton through this like if I had my
endure<00:06:06.460> I<00:06:06.670> could<00:06:06.820> probably<00:06:06.970> beat<00:06:07.150> on<00:06:07.300> through

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:07.540 
endure I could probably beat on through

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:09.480 
endure I could probably beat on through
that<00:06:07.690> tree<00:06:07.900> but<00:06:08.170> since<00:06:09.040> I<00:06:09.160> don't

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:09.490 
that tree but since I don't

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:11.160 
that tree but since I don't
I<00:06:09.550> could<00:06:09.820> probably<00:06:09.910> sorceress<00:06:10.540> so<00:06:10.780> it's<00:06:11.020> very

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:11.170 
I could probably sorceress so it's very

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:13.530 
I could probably sorceress so it's very
versatile<00:06:11.680> best<00:06:11.950> and<00:06:12.400> you<00:06:13.030> know<00:06:13.120> don't<00:06:13.300> laugh

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:13.540 
versatile best and you know don't laugh

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:16.890 
versatile best and you know don't laugh
at<00:06:13.810> it<00:06:13.960> and<00:06:14.250> if<00:06:15.250> you<00:06:15.760> have<00:06:16.000> it<00:06:16.210> it's<00:06:16.690> better

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:16.900 
at it and if you have it it's better

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:20.550 
at it and if you have it it's better
than<00:06:17.020> nothing<00:06:17.530> in<00:06:17.680> fact<00:06:17.950> I<00:06:18.660> I<00:06:19.660> wouldn't<00:06:20.050> say<00:06:20.320> I
