me

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.640 

wishing<00:00:41.480> that<00:00:41.600> you<00:00:41.720> never<00:00:41.930> asked<00:00:42.200> me<00:00:42.260> bring<00:00:42.560> it

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:42.650 
wishing that you never asked me bring it

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:48.610 
wishing that you never asked me bring it
on<00:00:46.420> maybe<00:00:47.420> the<00:00:47.600> head<00:00:47.810> is<00:00:47.990> actually<00:00:48.170> the<00:00:48.470> best

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 
on maybe the head is actually the best

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.930 
on maybe the head is actually the best
place<00:00:48.860> to<00:00:48.890> attack<00:00:49.280> there

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:53.970 

it<00:00:52.420> seems<00:00:52.629> like<00:00:52.750> it<00:00:52.870> makes<00:00:53.079> sense<00:00:53.140> but<00:00:53.530> I

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:53.980 
it seems like it makes sense but I

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.369 
it seems like it makes sense but I
usually<00:00:54.399> want<00:00:54.820> to<00:00:54.879> not<00:00:55.629> attack<00:00:55.960> the<00:00:56.140> thing

00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:56.379 
usually want to not attack the thing

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:59.759 
usually want to not attack the thing
that<00:00:57.250> should<00:00:58.180> scoop<00:00:58.480> me<00:00:58.629> up<00:00:58.660> in<00:00:58.930> its<00:00:59.050> mouth<00:00:59.199> but

00:00:59.759 --> 00:00:59.769 
that should scoop me up in its mouth but

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:02.369 
that should scoop me up in its mouth but
it<00:00:59.829> seems<00:01:00.010> like<00:01:00.190> the<00:01:00.309> easiest<00:01:00.579> place<00:01:00.879> to<00:01:01.379> avoid

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:02.379 
it seems like the easiest place to avoid

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:20.440 
it seems like the easiest place to avoid
getting<00:01:02.559> hit

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.060 

I<00:01:20.509> don't<00:01:20.990> think<00:01:21.020> that's<00:01:21.289> doing<00:01:21.560> anything<00:01:21.680> so

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
I don't think that's doing anything so

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.230 
I don't think that's doing anything so
I'm<00:01:22.159> gonna<00:01:22.250> stop<00:01:22.549> doing<00:01:22.729> it<00:01:24.610> okay<00:01:25.610> maybe<00:01:25.909> maybe

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
I'm gonna stop doing it okay maybe maybe

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:34.230 
I'm gonna stop doing it okay maybe maybe
that<00:01:26.299> last<00:01:26.570> one

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:47.830 

yeah<00:01:35.270> back<00:01:35.990> away

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.520 

back<00:01:48.840> away

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
back away

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:57.070

move these back up that get him I don't

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.680 
move these back up that get him I don't
think<00:02:07.700> so

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
think so

this guy's telling me my swords not
gonna<00:02:48.570> work<00:02:48.720> but<00:02:48.900> really<00:02:49.170> I<00:02:49.350> mean<00:02:49.860> I<00:02:49.950> don't

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
gonna work but really I mean I don't

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:51.800 
gonna work but really I mean I don't
think<00:02:50.250> that's<00:02:50.430> gonna<00:02:50.610> work<00:02:50.670> and<00:02:51.030> that's<00:02:51.150> that

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
think that's gonna work and that's that

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.740 
think that's gonna work and that's that
my<00:02:52.020> bow<00:02:52.200> is<00:02:52.350> all<00:02:52.500> I<00:02:52.530> have

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
my bow is all I have

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.800 
my bow is all I have
it<00:02:54.750> looks<00:02:54.930> like<00:02:55.050> it's<00:02:55.200> doing<00:02:55.320> fine<00:02:56.570> there<00:02:57.570> we

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
it looks like it's doing fine there we

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:58.220 
it looks like it's doing fine there we
go

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
go

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.280 
go
he<00:02:58.350> was<00:02:58.470> just<00:02:58.650> trying<00:02:58.860> to<00:02:58.890> trick<00:02:59.160> me<00:03:01.310> local

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
he was just trying to trick me local

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:17.059 
he was just trying to trick me local
time<00:03:04.290> to<00:03:04.470> run

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:19.009 

okay<00:03:17.730> so<00:03:17.790> it<00:03:17.969> looks<00:03:18.150> like<00:03:18.209> if<00:03:18.420> you<00:03:18.540> just<00:03:18.719> run

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
okay so it looks like if you just run

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:21.589 
okay so it looks like if you just run
it's<00:03:19.950> better<00:03:20.189> than<00:03:20.430> just<00:03:20.610> doing<00:03:20.700> the<00:03:20.939> dash

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:21.599 
it's better than just doing the dash

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:23.209 
it's better than just doing the dash
jump<00:03:21.870> but<00:03:22.079> it<00:03:22.319> doesn't<00:03:22.620> make<00:03:22.680> sense<00:03:22.739> to<00:03:23.069> me

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:23.219 
jump but it doesn't make sense to me

00:03:23.219 --> 00:03:25.490 
jump but it doesn't make sense to me
because<00:03:23.750> when<00:03:24.750> you're<00:03:24.959> when<00:03:25.260> you're<00:03:25.379> not

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
because when you're when you're not

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.679 
because when you're when you're not
doing<00:03:25.709> these<00:03:25.920> chase<00:03:26.159> scenes<00:03:26.400> -<00:03:27.000> jumping<00:03:27.480> is

00:03:27.679 --> 00:03:27.689 
doing these chase scenes - jumping is

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:31.539 
doing these chase scenes - jumping is
much<00:03:28.049> faster<00:03:28.319> than<00:03:28.620> uh<00:03:29.120> and<00:03:30.120> just<00:03:30.180> regular

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:31.549 
much faster than uh and just regular

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:34.190 
much faster than uh and just regular
regular<00:03:32.549> running<00:03:32.790> but<00:03:33.450> it<00:03:33.599> seems<00:03:33.840> like<00:03:34.049> that's

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
regular running but it seems like that's

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:43.110 
regular running but it seems like that's
how<00:03:34.409> you<00:03:34.470> do<00:03:34.709> it<00:03:38.510> -<00:03:39.510> under

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:50.690 

and<00:03:43.360> let's<00:03:44.110> blow<00:03:44.440> your<00:03:44.620> ass<00:03:44.769> up

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:04:01.070 

go<00:03:51.700> back<00:03:51.909> to<00:03:52.090> Jurassic<00:03:52.629> Park<00:03:57.569> so<00:03:58.569> you<00:03:58.720> know

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.080 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:07.030 

all<00:04:02.080> right<00:04:02.200> we<00:04:02.320> we<00:04:02.680> out<00:04:02.800> of<00:04:02.890> here<00:04:03.630> here

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:13.530 

Oh<00:04:08.680> God<00:04:10.329> he<00:04:11.329> is<00:04:11.360> not<00:04:11.599> done<00:04:12.170> yet

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
Oh God he is not done yet

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.910 
Oh God he is not done yet
that's<00:04:14.540> okay<00:04:14.930> no<00:04:14.959> because<00:04:15.349> I'm<00:04:15.470> not<00:04:15.500> done

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.920 
that's okay no because I'm not done

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:26.730 
that's okay no because I'm not done
