okay it's very little but I think it's

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.840 
okay it's very little but I think it's
on<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.560> inside<00:01:55.920> because<00:01:56.219> I<00:01:56.310> did<00:01:56.490> have<00:01:56.610> another

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.500 
on the inside because I did have another
color<00:01:57.149> on<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:58.350> bottom

00:01:59.500 --> 00:01:59.510

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:18.669 
so I don't want nobody to struggle the

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:20.430 
so I don't want nobody to struggle the
way<00:05:18.790> I<00:05:18.820> did<00:05:19.210> when<00:05:19.630> I<00:05:19.690> didn't<00:05:20.050> know<00:05:20.110> how<00:05:20.200> to<00:05:20.290> take

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:20.440 
way I did when I didn't know how to take

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.700 
way I did when I didn't know how to take
it<00:05:20.470> out<00:05:20.620> so<00:05:20.970> I<00:05:21.970> do<00:05:22.480> have<00:05:22.810> makeup<00:05:23.020> remover<00:05:23.440> but<00:05:23.650> I

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:23.710 
it out so I do have makeup remover but I

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:25.080 
it out so I do have makeup remover but I
thought<00:05:23.980> that<00:05:24.040> was<00:05:24.280> really<00:05:24.580> neat<00:05:24.760> and<00:05:24.910> it's

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:25.090 
thought that was really neat and it's

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:26.700 
thought that was really neat and it's
much<00:05:25.270> faster<00:05:25.510> and<00:05:25.930> you<00:05:25.990> don't<00:05:26.140> struggle<00:05:26.440> at

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:26.710 
much faster and you don't struggle at

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:28.530 
much faster and you don't struggle at
all<00:05:26.830> it's<00:05:27.040> like<00:05:27.190> the<00:05:27.550> other<00:05:27.730> it<00:05:28.030> sounds<00:05:28.330> like

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:28.540 
all it's like the other it sounds like

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:29.880 
all it's like the other it sounds like
other<00:05:28.780> lipsticks<00:05:29.230> have<00:05:29.380> something<00:05:29.620> at<00:05:29.770> that

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:29.890 
other lipsticks have something at that

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:33.030 
other lipsticks have something at that
24<00:05:30.669> hour<00:05:30.760> long<00:05:31.000> thing<00:05:31.330> does<00:05:31.630> not<00:05:31.870> have<00:05:32.080> doesn't

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:41.850 
want to mention I do recommend the
long-lasting<00:05:41.020> lipstick<00:05:41.350> because<00:05:41.470> it<00:05:41.710> does

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:41.860 
long-lasting lipstick because it does

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:44.460 
long-lasting lipstick because it does
work<00:05:42.070> if<00:05:42.520> you<00:05:42.729> have<00:05:42.970> dry<00:05:43.210> lips<00:05:43.240> so<00:05:43.660> I<00:05:43.840> probably

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:44.470 
work if you have dry lips so I probably

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:46.380

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:46.390 
won't recommend it because if you don't

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:47.730 
won't recommend it because if you don't
like<00:05:46.540> that<00:05:46.660> dry<00:05:46.840> feeling<00:05:47.229> you<00:05:47.350> probably<00:05:47.380> won't

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:49.650 
like that dry feeling you probably won't
