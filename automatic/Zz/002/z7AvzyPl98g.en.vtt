00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.510
 it goes on with porsche I have the 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:12.200
 rest with things in again 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:15.719
 the pond is done by my mail 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:18.930
 what was salt and have it to one 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:21.449
 dough kneaded and then half an hour 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:25.460
 let it stand a bit too 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:30.380
 agitated so the dough looks like 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:38.850
 We take a piece of the dough 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:41.700
 now make a bun so to speak, the 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:01:00.440
 Add a little flour to it 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:01:00.440
 if it sticks a bit of pasta roll 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:20.729
 Do not study when it starts on topics 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:34.009
 always try a bit of flour in 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:39.680
 around the time really fast with that 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:44.220
 there are other things that cross here 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:47.299
 Triangles had our children already 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:52.280
 prepared with parsley and then 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:55.280
 we feel the pieces with a bit 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.280
 cheese 

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:10.080
 You can preheat the oven to 180 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:10.080
 Degree 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:30.920
 then we do that so we take that 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:36.430
 pages keep it in the middle and from 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:36.430
 above, we start to wince 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:44.450
 and then we have such a piece of that 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:49.720
 So let's go with the side now 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:53.170
 inside fold this up and together 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.170
 very easily 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:08.109
 on our baking tray once baking paper 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:11.859
 then our little ones come 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:11.859
 Rochester on it 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:36.840
 We will do that with the whole day 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:40.769
 a baking sheet window is not enough 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:43.739
 next to the new maybe so and that 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:56.640
 now my whole pieces what you now 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:04:02.370
 I have also separated my only here 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:06.569
 the yolk and me my ambassadors 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:16.169
 with a bit bit of golden brown we 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:21.200
 would have broken the euro for 20 in the oven 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:21.200
 until 30 minutes until golden brown 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:42.990
 then she kind of likes it 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:50.000
 it was like that and yours we have 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:50.000
 already here already finished 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:05:02.030
 they still need some absinthe 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:02.030
 the out 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.440
 8:15 pm a bit golden brown 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:12.380
 become 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:16.430
 that's filled in our little one 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:16.430
 bun with feta cheese
