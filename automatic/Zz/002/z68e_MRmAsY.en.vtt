00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.710
 do not 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.369
 I write again to the folio to narrate 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.950
 each episode to expel rabies by 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.020

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.780
 more than pain in letters letters with goals 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:43.079
 fictitious I'll never get them and maybe 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.570
 be semifinal although I never give up with 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.400
 everything that has gone wrong I remember people 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.170

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:56.450
 I write again to the folio to narrate 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.390
 each episode to expel rabies by 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:01.250
 everything that hurt that if time passes 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.250
 is to warn me not to miss 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:06.440
 you want effort and the illusion is spilled 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.300
 tears of blood and sweat to express what 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.300
 what I think and feel in chrono channel and 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:13.400
 rhythm by and with and for the heart to 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.830
 debug my soul until my engine stops 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.600
 unlike the rest I remove verses with 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.610
 since I put it up well are 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.070
 phrases until I lie down and go crazy 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.410
 prey for the gift that won me just 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.450
 listening to this you give me your hand for 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:28.910
 fill that empty gap accept the challenge 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.470
 that what was yours was rhyming everything is 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.570
 what have been lethal I did not do more 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.020
 big in clear river my wings I will make 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:38.060
 worth it if they say they are worth nothing 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.920
 I write again to the folio with letters of 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.080
 love against hatred knowing who I am 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.360
 I climbing podiums immune like a god 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.580
 I stay here fighting against my 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.920
 demons even if it's the end of the 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:51.590
 time has made me improve and if it has 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.310

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.530

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.399
 brave and more milestone the way is 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.350

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.149
 courage to express what I feel 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.460
