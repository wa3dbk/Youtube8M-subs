00:00:00.659 --> 00:00:02.828
- Hi, this is Jason with Revant Optics.

00:00:02.828 --> 00:00:05.372
Today I have the Ray-Ban Justin frame.

00:00:05.372 --> 00:00:07.457
It's more of a lifestyle frame.

00:00:07.457 --> 00:00:09.251
Super comfortable.

00:00:09.251 --> 00:00:10.669
Feel like it looks good on me.

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:11.878
Hope it does,

00:00:11.878 --> 00:00:13.130
but fits me well

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:14.297
and today we're gonna show you

00:00:14.297 --> 00:00:15.633
how to just change up the look

00:00:15.633 --> 00:00:17.801
or the functionality of these sunglasses

00:00:17.801 --> 00:00:19.428
with some different lenses,

00:00:19.428 --> 00:00:22.016
and we hope you enjoy the video.

00:00:33.024 --> 00:00:35.402
Today I'm gonna show you how to remove

00:00:35.402 --> 00:00:38.614
and install lenses in your
Ray-Ban Justin frames.

00:00:38.614 --> 00:00:41.534
This is the 54mm version.

00:00:41.534 --> 00:00:43.327
It's an all plastic frame

00:00:43.327 --> 00:00:45.078
and the way to remove the lenses

00:00:45.078 --> 00:00:48.039
is go ahead and pull up
on the top edge here,

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:49.249
and pull down on the bottom

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:52.002
and then push through with
your fingers just like that.

00:00:52.002 --> 00:00:53.467
It'll pop right out,

00:00:53.467 --> 00:00:55.756
and then you can do the
same on this side as well.

00:00:55.756 --> 00:00:57.007
So, you pull up on this edge

00:00:57.007 --> 00:00:58.592
and down on this edge,

00:00:58.592 --> 00:01:00.719
and then push through with your fingers.

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.429
You might hear a little
bit of a popping noise

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:03.930
or cracking noise, that's fine.

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.056
That just means the lens

00:01:05.056 --> 00:01:07.642
is coming out of the groove there.

00:01:07.642 --> 00:01:08.810
These particular lenses

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.273
are the Stealth Black
Polarized lenses by Revant.

00:01:12.273 --> 00:01:14.442
There are a variety of
different mirror coated colors

00:01:14.442 --> 00:01:18.529
or tints available at
revantoptics.com for this frame.

00:01:18.529 --> 00:01:20.864
So, you can go ahead and check those out.

00:01:20.864 --> 00:01:23.242
They're precision cut to
fit in here perfectly,

00:01:23.242 --> 00:01:26.244
so when you're ready to
install your new lenses,

00:01:26.244 --> 00:01:28.747
you go ahead and slide them...

00:01:28.747 --> 00:01:30.624
The nose piece in the groove first

00:01:30.624 --> 00:01:32.793
and then just use your thumbs

00:01:32.793 --> 00:01:35.969
to go ahead and push the
outside edge into place

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:38.298
just like that, pop right in,

00:01:38.298 --> 00:01:41.386
and then it should be pretty flush there.

00:01:41.386 --> 00:01:43.762
Go ahead and do that with this as well.

00:01:43.762 --> 00:01:45.472
Slide that in and then use your thumbs

00:01:45.472 --> 00:01:47.224
to push it into place.

00:01:47.224 --> 00:01:48.725
That popped right into place,

00:01:48.725 --> 00:01:51.686
so that's how easy it is to remove

00:01:51.686 --> 00:01:54.022
and install lenses in this frame.

00:01:54.022 --> 00:01:55.398
Once you install your new lenses,

00:01:55.398 --> 00:01:57.442
we'd love to see how they look.

00:01:57.442 --> 00:01:58.986
So, go ahead and post a picture

00:01:58.986 --> 00:02:00.862
to Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter

00:02:00.862 --> 00:02:03.683
and hashtag RevantOptics.

00:02:03.683 --> 00:02:04.912
Also, if you have any questions

00:02:04.912 --> 00:02:08.036
just about this process,
your frames, or the lenses,

00:02:08.036 --> 00:02:09.579
feel free to shoot us an email

00:02:09.579 --> 00:02:11.790
