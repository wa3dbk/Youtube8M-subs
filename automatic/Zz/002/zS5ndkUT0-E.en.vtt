there<00:00:51.059> was<00:00:51.149> a<00:00:51.210> new<00:00:51.390> region<00:00:51.600> coming<00:00:52.050> up<00:00:52.170> in<00:00:52.350> the

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
there was a new region coming up in the

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.639 
there was a new region coming up in the
northwest<00:00:52.739> ahead<00:00:53.610> of<00:00:53.730> region<00:00:54.180> 1260<00:00:54.870> it<00:00:55.500> has

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
northwest ahead of region 1260 it has

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.560 
northwest ahead of region 1260 it has
actually<00:00:55.920> grown<00:00:56.070> overnight<00:00:56.520> but<00:00:57.270> is<00:00:57.390> still

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
actually grown overnight but is still

actually grown overnight but is still
not<00:00:57.750> yet<00:00:57.930> been<00:00:58.050> numbered<00:00:58.469> there<00:00:59.399> are<00:00:59.460> also<00:00:59.550> two

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
not yet been numbered there are also two

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.610 
not yet been numbered there are also two
new<00:01:00.059> regions<00:01:00.449> coming<00:01:00.780> over<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.140> southeast

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
new regions coming over the southeast

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.020 
new regions coming over the southeast
limb<00:01:01.890> which<00:01:02.370> may<00:01:02.520> turn<00:01:02.730> out<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.879> be

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
limb which may turn out to be

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.210 
limb which may turn out to be
substantial<00:01:03.660> so<00:01:04.530> let's<00:01:04.710> take<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:04.890> look<00:01:05.070> at<00:01:05.129> the

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
substantial so let's take a look at the

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.679 
substantial so let's take a look at the
evolution<00:01:05.430> of<00:01:05.729> these<00:01:05.880> regions<00:01:06.270> over<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.540> last

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
evolution of these regions over the last

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.170 
evolution of these regions over the last
48<00:01:07.140> hours<00:01:07.290> first<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.189> sun<00:01:08.369> spots<00:01:08.670> from<00:01:09.060> the

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
48 hours first the sun spots from the

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.850 
48 hours first the sun spots from the

HMI instrument on the Solar Dynamics

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.920 
HMI instrument on the Solar Dynamics
Observatory<00:01:11.420> and<00:01:12.420> I<00:01:12.450> would<00:01:12.570> like<00:01:12.689> you<00:01:12.750> to

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
Observatory and I would like you to

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.260 
Observatory and I would like you to
concentrate<00:01:13.200> on<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:14.100> northeast<00:01:14.520> with<00:01:15.150> those

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
concentrate on the northeast with those

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.780 
concentrate on the northeast with those
two<00:01:15.509> major<00:01:15.750> regions<00:01:16.259> first<00:01:16.860> 1260<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:17.700> then

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
two major regions first 1260 and then

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.929 
two major regions first 1260 and then
they're<00:01:17.939> even<00:01:18.150> bigger<00:01:18.330> region<00:01:18.780> which<00:01:18.869> is<00:01:18.990> 1261

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:19.939 
they're even bigger region which is 1261

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:22.460 
they're even bigger region which is 1261
I've<00:01:20.939> made<00:01:21.150> a<00:01:21.180> much<00:01:21.390> more<00:01:21.509> detailed<00:01:21.689> movie<00:01:22.290> of

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
I've made a much more detailed movie of

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.770 
I've made a much more detailed movie of
these<00:01:22.710> two<00:01:22.950> regions<00:01:23.360> first<00:01:24.360> take<00:01:24.509> a<00:01:24.570> look<00:01:24.600> at

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
these two regions first take a look at

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.630 
these two regions first take a look at
region<00:01:25.049> 1260<00:01:25.619> where<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:25.950> number<00:01:26.220> of<00:01:26.340> spots

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
region 1260 where the number of spots

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.690 
region 1260 where the number of spots
grows<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:27.720> becomes<00:01:27.900> more<00:01:28.229> complex<00:01:28.710> as<00:01:28.979> time

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
grows and becomes more complex as time

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.230 
grows and becomes more complex as time
goes<00:01:29.909> by<00:01:30.530> now<00:01:31.530> whether<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:31.829> region<00:01:32.159> 1261<00:01:32.790> is

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
goes by now whether a region 1261 is

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.030 
goes by now whether a region 1261 is
growing<00:01:33.689> or<00:01:33.869> just<00:01:34.079> becoming<00:01:34.380> more<00:01:34.470> visible<00:01:34.710> as

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
growing or just becoming more visible as

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.890 
growing or just becoming more visible as
it<00:01:35.159> rotates<00:01:35.310> onto<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.820> disk<00:01:35.970> is<00:01:36.210> a<00:01:36.509> matter<00:01:36.780> of

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
it rotates onto the disk is a matter of

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.330 
it rotates onto the disk is a matter of
debate<00:01:37.049> and<00:01:37.439> we<00:01:37.560> have<00:01:37.680> to<00:01:37.770> wait<00:01:37.890> for<00:01:38.070> a<00:01:38.100> day<00:01:38.220> or

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
debate and we have to wait for a day or

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.180 
debate and we have to wait for a day or
two<00:01:38.369> to<00:01:39.090> see<00:01:39.270> what<00:01:39.509> is<00:01:39.630> going<00:01:39.689> on

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.190 
two to see what is going on

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.560

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
polarity which is a good sign for

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.240

because<00:03:50.659> since<00:03:50.989> I<00:03:51.079> started<00:03:51.379> doing<00:03:51.590> this<00:03:51.980> video

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
because since I started doing this video

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.399 
because since I started doing this video
I<00:03:53.030> noticed<00:03:53.569> we've<00:03:53.719> had<00:03:53.840> a<00:03:53.870> couple<00:03:54.049> more<00:03:54.379> of

00:03:54.399 --> 00:03:54.409 
I noticed we've had a couple more of

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:57.399 
I noticed we've had a couple more of
them<00:03:55.060> the<00:03:56.060> chance<00:03:56.329> of<00:03:56.450> getting<00:03:56.689> em<00:03:56.840> flares<00:03:57.170> is

00:03:57.399 --> 00:03:57.409 
them the chance of getting em flares is

00:03:57.409 --> 00:03:59.580 
them the chance of getting em flares is
been<00:03:57.620> proved<00:03:57.950> but<00:03:58.219> still<00:03:58.459> is<00:03:58.609> relatively<00:03:59.000> poor

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
been proved but still is relatively poor

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.129 
been proved but still is relatively poor
just<00:04:00.590> getting<00:04:00.859> ex-players<00:04:01.250> is<00:04:01.459> very<00:04:01.670> remote

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:02.139 
just getting ex-players is very remote

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:04.059 
just getting ex-players is very remote
that's<00:04:03.139> what<00:04:03.290> number<00:04:03.530> should<00:04:03.680> go<00:04:03.829> a<00:04:03.859> lot

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:04.069 
that's what number should go a lot

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:06.759 
that's what number should go a lot

ejections<00:04:07.159> is<00:04:07.280> still<00:04:07.489> good<00:04:07.750> so<00:04:08.750> the<00:04:08.870> wind

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:09.019 
ejections is still good so the wind

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:11.229 
ejections is still good so the wind
speed<00:04:09.139> should<00:04:09.439> remain<00:04:09.739> low<00:04:10.010> but<00:04:10.879> the<00:04:10.969> chances

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239 
speed should remain low but the chances

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:13.360 
speed should remain low but the chances
getting<00:04:11.480> a<00:04:11.599> geomagnetic<00:04:11.930> storm<00:04:12.099> in<00:04:13.099> the<00:04:13.189> next

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
getting a geomagnetic storm in the next

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.610 
getting a geomagnetic storm in the next
24<00:04:13.700> hours<00:04:13.730> is<00:04:14.180> very<00:04:14.450> poor<00:04:14.720> in<00:04:15.200> the<00:04:15.319> longer<00:04:15.590> term

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
24 hours is very poor in the longer term

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.589

we<00:04:15.950> have<00:04:16.099> nothing<00:04:16.400> new<00:04:16.579> coming<00:04:16.849> of<00:04:17.030> the<00:04:17.120> slim

in the next couple of days so we're

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.279
