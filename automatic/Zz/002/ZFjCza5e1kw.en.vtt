00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
make a turn practice this in a parking

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.720 
make a turn practice this in a parking
lot<00:02:33.750> or<00:02:34.110> empty<00:02:34.500> street<00:02:34.770> until<00:02:35.070> you<00:02:35.220> can<00:02:35.370> scan

I<00:02:38.850> think<00:02:38.940> we<00:02:39.240> should<00:02:39.420> review<00:02:39.600> hand<00:02:40.080> signals

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
I think we should review hand signals

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:41.990 
I think we should review hand signals
and<00:02:40.739> other<00:02:40.890> ways<00:02:41.070> to<00:02:41.310> communicate<00:02:41.489> your
