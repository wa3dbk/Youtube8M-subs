00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:41.330
 a jet of cold air drying the hair root 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.769
 then pass the iron one step 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:49.200
 once and in the second I'll go and 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:50.910

 I will doing all this process we 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:02.579
 I repeat only with the hair after the step is 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:04.890
 give a cool air and dry root 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:06.690

 day after the ankle brush has to stay 

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:33.969
