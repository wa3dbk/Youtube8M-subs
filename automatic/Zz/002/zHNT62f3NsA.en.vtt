00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:34.870
 Freeman's Mind episode 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:41.590
 46 you are cool i would bur the letter p 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:44.080
 when I sang the genesis general I don't 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:46.300
 I can probably that's why I don't 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.580
 real general they're sure all 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:51.489
 know how to drink right that the us me again 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:53.710
 waiting for passing literally it seems 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:57.250
 it 's still got my new job 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:59.860
 killing people and worse fine 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:04.000
 no tanks and cleaned the sump 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:05.470
 only aces up like gravity 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.650
 cool please 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.960
 hey plane here the plane i have 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.700
 ignored maybe air force 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.470
 the forces are not conspiring with those who 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.300
 trying to kill me but i have him 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.130
 shot because it does 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.860
 to attract the attention of rescuers right 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:24.520
 or do it only in the south in florida 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:30.400
 and louisians are doing exactly that 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:32.320
 minefield sign of damage if any option 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.870
 sideways, they generally took the time to all 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.540
 here they are sure to mine 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:44.350
 in a hurry it probably did not draw 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:45.850
 no card before and ready to bet on 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.450
 anything that mines nowhere 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:51.250
 documented that means years 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.900
 in twenty will come here any 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.070
 documentaries to him during filming 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:59.440
 will tear many of you for the future 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.750
 lava is here jesus 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.730
 because these fragments boutiques work 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.830
 laser mine we were a little ordinary 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:08.280
 men's of this side so we set 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.720
 visible next to falling debris 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.560
 we are not all here yet 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:17.050
 bombed 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:24.580
 such a god idea there on the covers 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:25.480
 squirrel what is it possible payback I'm 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.819
 can't see anything 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:31.740
 I do not understand why we need all these laser 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:36.160
 mine is a type if the alien will go here 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:37.160
 then we blow it up and part of the building is tricky 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.430
 what did you think 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:45.830
 Lead that substitute 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:47.390
 oh god no just not now that's what 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.990
 probably old people are experiencing 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:53.240
 stairs 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:56.260
 about another dead body as a cute what killed him 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:03:06.710
 anime well he has all the limbs in place 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:09.680
 perhaps my god almost hit the feet 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:15.290
 this is the same sniper from last night he 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:17.150
 haunts me and knew how angry he was 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:21.010
 shot me i almost got under 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.010
 this laser well here's the villain 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:31.190
 hi why is this door to nowhere closed 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.630
 they are afraid that people will pass in new and 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.310
 will park in a minefield 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:36.800
 this is really a good reason for 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.870
 worry but i'm not going or through 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.030
 mine field so i have a problem and 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.490
 so I do not crawl cattle 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:46.070
 sniper shoot me accurately and in a suit 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:47.959
 me still bright though orange in 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:48.700
 I still had little to shoot all the paint 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:51.440
 got off 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.270
 It seems there is only this door even in 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:57.280
 I have no reason to think that it is open 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:57.280
 if it doesn't work I will improvise 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.959
 wake up and now i have that period 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.450
 life when i know my best 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:08.840
 option won't work 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:13.070
 okay we go break off and the door is closed 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:15.380
 zigzag zigzag zigzag zigzag could be 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:18.080
 worse if your brains are not smeared by 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.190
 the wall then it is not the worst day you 

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:21.770
 understand what I mean 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:23.860
 so well, the sniper clearly will not be able to get into 

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:29.060
 moving target 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:31.240
 fine yes better not go there i don't 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.830
 guessed it was a sniper reserve 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:36.400
 probably for this here all these mines to 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:38.690
 they did not enter residential areas 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.850
 This as for their so and for our 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:42.290
 security if they escaped then 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:44.990
 would shoot everyone in sight 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:50.360
 would be left without ammunition it would break 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:55.159
 offend the ecosystem or 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:57.259
 they hear about it looks like I made the right 

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:59.689
 decision when not tiptoeing 

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:01.819
 minefield is unlikely I will jump from here 

00:04:59.689 --> 00:05:03.919
 on this fence and be smart that 

00:05:01.819 --> 00:05:06.229
 extremely unlikely but still be 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:08.419
 as such they are you buried mines right 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:10.400
 taking along my landing I would 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:12.169
 did exactly that okay and what 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.270
 now do besides it's time 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:16.550
 stop burning oh come down for this 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:20.659
 don't even need to be jackie chan and this 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:22.639
 good for obvious reasons so 

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:24.560
 the aliens did not come for the swamp planet 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:28.039
 but the force of attraction they obviously should 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:29.830
 be smaller than ours this flyer abandoned 

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:33.020
 aliens from the second floor 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:35.479
 free fall and they considered it for 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:38.479
 problems means they have it ok and 

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:41.150
 absolutely safe height of them dick 

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:43.039
 so if I went through a mine 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:45.169
 the field then I would have only through 

00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:45.979
 barbed wire just to get me 

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:47.930
 electrocuted 

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:52.189
 my gosh hardly worth worrying about 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:53.599
 coyotes will dig in the trash here I 

00:05:52.189 --> 00:05:56.089
 sure that this door leads to the room 

00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:56.690
 full of candy treasure but i'm not there 

00:05:56.089 --> 00:05:58.610
 I will get 

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:00.800
 I bet that the soldiers at 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:02.240
 opportunities and on the roof would set min 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:06.050
 clean just in case 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:07.400
 what is this one like the entrance to me 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:09.800
 acetylene torch 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:12.020
 I still can not forget about jumping 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:14.419
 aliens from a height they have a hard time with 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:16.969
 Math I think it is possible for them 

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:18.800
 only three fingers we have 5 nobody to me 

00:06:16.969 --> 00:06:20.779
 believes but I am convinced that we would go where 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:23.089
 would be more successful in technology 

00:06:20.779 --> 00:06:24.650
 we have six fingers on each hand and well 

00:06:23.089 --> 00:06:26.569
 man's sticks 

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:29.150
 polydactyly dominates no doubt 

00:06:26.569 --> 00:06:30.139
 what he doing what i try not to please 

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:35.750
 under the bullets that's what 

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:39.139
 and there are people who can jinx still 

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:41.360
 there are snipers big difference but yes I 

00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:44.089
 I am sure that the work in the 12 river system 

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:45.710
 would make us better think we would 

00:06:44.089 --> 00:06:47.779
 surprised how much could it be 

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:50.870
 solve the problem if we have 12 fingers 

00:06:47.779 --> 00:06:53.870
 so it looks like this is my ticket inside and we 

00:06:50.870 --> 00:07:00.500
 there is someone alive one sharp movement i 

00:06:53.870 --> 00:07:02.899
 I'll shoot you clearly what are you 

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:03.380
 complex lambda let's change june i have 

00:07:02.899 --> 00:07:05.750
 also 

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:07.820
 reached until I was here and just 

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:10.820
 not chickened out look behind the door and you 

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:13.190
 understand what i have boxes i will wait out all 

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:15.650
 disasters here if you're going 

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:18.770
 go further then pray you be utterly 

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:21.680
 careful to be there worse than 

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:24.410
 what I have already seen there must be males 

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:26.420
 carrels with flamethrowers dish with you 

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:29.090
 frankly I thought just in case 

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:31.160
 shoot you but decided that the murder on 

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:33.710
 the corner of an unarmed person is not the most 

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:35.600
 heroic act but since you wait and 

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:36.110
 maybe you have a deck of cards or a little 

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:44.990
 such a 

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:47.330
 oh how many fingers do you have on 

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:50.780
