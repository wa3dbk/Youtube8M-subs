00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:05.210
 hello everyone here I am for a new 

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:06.770
 magic trick the trick that I'm going to 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:10.900
 perform today is called the 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:13.120
 trick of color change 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.870
 a quite visual and surprising group 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.670
 by bauza 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:18.470
 the trick is the fifth way 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.580
 we take the letter that we have in the part 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.439
 top of Havana 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.910
 in this case the 8 of clubs and 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:26.450
 simply passing your hand gently 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.259
 we see how he becomes a king of 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:28.939
 clover 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:31.560
 but of course what happens if now the 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:33.700
 hand back above 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.480
 that becomes a hole 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.399
 of end the again 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.440
 I hope you liked the trick and 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:44.989
 now I will explain how it is done 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.360
 for this we will first of all carry out a 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:50.790
 double that is to pass a letter and then 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.500
 another in this case there are two 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.420
 keep the voucher by making a small 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.160
 break I could organize it from these notes 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.990
 virtual but family in this area 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.780
 for this case it is more comfortable 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:02.910
 we come and we download the part of him in the 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.860
 rotate as if it were only a letter 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.130
 and we put it 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.530
 but if they are two houses once they 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.200
 we have thus placed 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.210
 with this part of our hands what 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.490
 only thing we have to do is 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.250
 push the failure to place this part 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.120
 here and move the portfolio to who from 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.760
 way 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:28.130
 and ready the letter I have it here 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.140
 the lid and yourself I'm moving your hand 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.940
 OK 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.159
 make this move with care already 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:37.260
 that you only realize far back there will be seen 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:39.840
 the wax letter and the letter 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.790
 with a little practice you will know the 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.640
 quiet and once we have the 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:48.970
 part well hidden with the little finger 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:53.200
 there are two worth there we will place 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:55.710
 then of course the letter is again worth 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.060
 and there the box is placed we are going to 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.520
 pass your hand gently 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.320
 we have already changed the letter with your finger 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.460
 small we start to move on to 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.880
 happen 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:10.009
 in squares with him with these fingers the 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.930
 I hope you liked a trick 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.420
 quite visual a change of color 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:17.709
 surprising to subscribe to the channel and 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.709
 I like to say hello
