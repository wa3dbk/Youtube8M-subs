before<00:01:34.619> I<00:01:34.680> open<00:01:34.950> it<00:01:40.939> now<00:01:41.939> this<00:01:42.150> I<00:01:42.360> saw<00:01:42.630> this<00:01:42.810> on

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
before I open it now this I saw this on

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.590 
before I open it now this I saw this on
blu-ray<00:01:43.350> calm<00:01:44.000> but<00:01:45.000> they<00:01:45.149> only<00:01:45.329> have<00:01:45.570> a

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
blu-ray calm but they only have a

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.219 
blu-ray calm but they only have a
listing<00:01:46.079> for<00:01:46.350> an<00:01:47.600> german<00:01:48.600> version<00:01:48.750> of<00:01:48.990> it<00:01:49.140> I

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
listing for an german version of it I

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.380 
listing for an german version of it I
think<00:01:49.290> of<00:01:49.530> French<00:01:49.829> and<00:01:50.070> a<00:01:50.430> Brazilian<00:01:51.149> version

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
think of French and a Brazilian version

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.480 
think of French and a Brazilian version
of<00:01:51.689> it<00:01:52.220> now<00:01:54.049> looking<00:01:55.049> at<00:01:55.200> this<00:01:55.409> when<00:01:55.829> I<00:01:55.860> first

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
of it now looking at this when I first

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.389 
of it now looking at this when I first
opened<00:01:56.790> it<00:01:57.600> I<00:01:57.840> saw<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.350> Canadian<00:01:59.219> version

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
opened it I saw the Canadian version

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.090 
opened it I saw the Canadian version
that<00:01:59.700> they<00:01:59.909> do<00:01:59.969> have<00:02:00.329> here<00:02:00.719> there's<00:02:01.590> only<00:02:01.740> five

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
that they do have here there's only five

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.459 
that they do have here there's only five
discs<00:02:03.799> the<00:02:04.799> German<00:02:05.280> version<00:02:05.430> is<00:02:05.960> six<00:02:06.960> discs

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
discs the German version is six discs

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.669 
discs the German version is six discs
and<00:02:07.729> I<00:02:08.729> think<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:09.000> Brazilian<00:02:09.509> version<00:02:09.569> is<00:02:09.989> ten

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
and I think the Brazilian version is ten

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.100 
and I think the Brazilian version is ten
discs<00:02:11.160> so<00:02:11.819> I'm<00:02:11.879> not<00:02:12.030> too<00:02:12.209> sure<00:02:12.420> exactly<00:02:12.569> what

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
discs so I'm not too sure exactly what

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.850 
discs so I'm not too sure exactly what
those<00:02:13.290> X

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
those X

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.180 
those X
your<00:02:13.980> disks<00:02:14.310> consist<00:02:14.850> of<00:02:15.530> what<00:02:16.530> I<00:02:16.560> do<00:02:16.680> know<00:02:16.950> is

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
your disks consist of what I do know is

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.240 
your disks consist of what I do know is
that<00:02:17.220> it's<00:02:18.030> the<00:02:18.420> German<00:02:18.990> version<00:02:19.140> is<00:02:19.530> all<00:02:20.010> the

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
that it's the German version is all the

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.970 
that it's the German version is all the
same<00:02:20.400> x-men<00:02:20.820> movies<00:02:21.150> except<00:02:21.510> the<00:02:21.870> six<00:02:22.560> disc<00:02:22.800> is

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
same x-men movies except the six disc is

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.570 
same x-men movies except the six disc is
just<00:02:23.220> the<00:02:23.310> DVD<00:02:24.650> with<00:02:25.650> I<00:02:25.830> think<00:02:25.890> some<00:02:26.250> bonus

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
just the DVD with I think some bonus

there<00:06:47.530> thanks<00:06:48.530> a<00:06:48.590> lot<00:06:49.180> really<00:06:50.180> appreciate<00:06:50.750> it

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:52.030 
there thanks a lot really appreciate it

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:54.909 
there thanks a lot really appreciate it
but<00:06:53.030> yeah<00:06:53.240> so<00:06:53.990> I<00:06:54.020> guess<00:06:54.320> that's<00:06:54.560> the<00:06:54.770> reason

00:06:54.909 --> 00:06:54.919 
but yeah so I guess that's the reason

00:06:54.919 --> 00:07:01.940 
but yeah so I guess that's the reason
why<00:06:55.220> the<00:06:55.360> Canadian<00:06:56.360> release<00:06:56.630> does<00:06:57.020> not

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:01.950 

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:04.610 

so<00:07:02.100> the<00:07:02.220> Brazilian<00:07:02.640> release<00:07:03.000> has<00:07:03.180> ten<00:07:04.110> discs

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:04.620 
so the Brazilian release has ten discs

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:06.350 
so the Brazilian release has ten discs
two<00:07:04.920> DVDs<00:07:05.340> eight<00:07:05.520> blu-ray<00:07:05.820> so<00:07:06.000> I'm<00:07:06.060> not<00:07:06.180> too

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:06.360 
two DVDs eight blu-ray so I'm not too

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:07.730 
two DVDs eight blu-ray so I'm not too
sure<00:07:06.510> exactly<00:07:06.630> what<00:07:07.050> those<00:07:07.170> blu-rays<00:07:07.560> are

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:07.740 
sure exactly what those blu-rays are

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:10.670 
sure exactly what those blu-rays are
assuming<00:07:08.430> a<00:07:08.580> lot<00:07:08.730> more<00:07:08.880> special<00:07:09.210> features<00:07:09.680> but

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:10.680 
assuming a lot more special features but

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:13.880 
assuming a lot more special features but
for<00:07:10.860> the<00:07:10.920> price<00:07:11.130> I<00:07:11.280> paid<00:07:11.550> $59.99<00:07:12.540> for<00:07:13.080> five

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:13.890 
for the price I paid $59.99 for five

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:17.150 
for the price I paid $59.99 for five
movies<00:07:14.310> and<00:07:14.700> the<00:07:15.210> casing<00:07:15.630> is<00:07:15.660> really<00:07:16.020> cool<00:07:16.200> it

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:17.160 
movies and the casing is really cool it

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:19.520 
movies and the casing is really cool it
was<00:07:17.280> definitely<00:07:17.610> worth<00:07:17.760> it<00:07:17.990> $12.50<00:07:18.990> a<00:07:19.110> movie<00:07:19.380> I

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:19.530 
was definitely worth it $12.50 a movie I

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:25.310 
was definitely worth it $12.50 a movie I
mean<00:07:19.800> you<00:07:19.920> can't<00:07:20.130> go<00:07:20.220> wrong<00:07:23.990> don't<00:07:24.990> even<00:07:25.200> wanna
