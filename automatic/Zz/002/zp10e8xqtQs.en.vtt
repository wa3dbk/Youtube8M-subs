 at least there I learned quite recently 

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:59.379
 this is a crossover 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:02.610
 but there are single blocks and a constant 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:06.210

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:23.010
 extension and did not live as they do 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:25.030
 most 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.760
 see what is extension 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:31.810
 fixed the bow in one position more 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.970
 they don't go up and down always 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:37.060
 in place 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:40.420
 took a breath broke up your hands tightened and 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:43.480
 slowly bring back stretching 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.170
 triceps but leaving elbows in one 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.230
 position 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:50.340
 it's very important brad in the field 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:55.079
 sprayed your arms eg triceps slowly 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:58.260
 return the gnits quickly up slowly 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:03:01.879
 positive movement phase fast 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.879
 negative controllable 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:09.640
 negative phase of movement is performed 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:13.300
 always in any exercise two or three times 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:15.690
 slower than positive it is very important 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.430
 and more than once said not only for 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.069
 fitness for good leveling and 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.400
 first of all to preserve health 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:27.489
 the health of your joints ligaments and 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.170
 specifically muscles how do most 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:31.450
 guys 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:34.870
 bend don't start doing 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:38.459
 no living we need to stand straight 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:41.459
 fixing your elbows and doing only 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:41.459
 extension 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:49.420
 you can work here as with the cable car 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:51.430
 a hilt so here are modern technologies 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:54.370
 why did you advise everyone to advise it 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:58.319
 equipment for those who train and 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:04:02.110
 engaged in arm sports specifically these 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:04.810
 shadows peak sports anyone interested can 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:08.170
 look on the site order better 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:10.420
 data handles from simple cable 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:13.359
 handles you see that the pen itself 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:16.989
 made as a cone and when you 

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:19.959
 hold on to her she is maximum 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:23.610
 anatomical conveniently located in 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:27.220
 your hand you can more concentrated 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:30.100
 work out your triceps with cable car 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:32.620
 a handle too not bad but who tried 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:35.110
 these handles are more like a rope grip for me 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:37.440
 return can be done with 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:41.320
 metal handles 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:43.889
 like either slightly curved it 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.889
 never mind 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:51.370
 find for yourself the handle in which you 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:55.890
 will feel your triceps 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:59.980
 but the technique remains elbow points in place 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:03.700
 we only move our forearms 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:06.450
 don't lean forward don't create a semblance 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:11.670
 bench sprains stretched out and 

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:14.520
 straightened stretched straightened 

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:17.260
 sprained warmed up 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:21.070
 what do I like this exercise 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:23.230
 so this is the degree of concentration at the bottom 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:25.750
 the point when you hands broke up completely 

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:28.510
 you can additionally one or two 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:31.720
 seconds perform peak reduction this 

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:34.660
 very good and you will immediately feel it 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:37.240
 from the first workout write 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:40.260
 comments inquire none 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:40.260
 the question does not remain without attention 

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:51.500
 follow the technique and you will always be healthy 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:57.120
 and strong 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:06:00.150
 This is the basis of the pledge the base of the long literate 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:02.940
 workouts this channel believe in a must 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:04.890
 especially for you if you need something 

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:08.250
 it is not clear and you have any 

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:11.160
 questions write them in the comments I'm on 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:15.140
