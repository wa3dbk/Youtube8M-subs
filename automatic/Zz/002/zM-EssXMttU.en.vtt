00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 
I think there's so much hate on the

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.030 
I think there's so much hate on the
internet<00:05:17.760> right<00:05:17.880> now<00:05:17.940> especially<00:05:18.330> since<00:05:19.290> we

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:20.040 
internet right now especially since we

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.550 
internet right now especially since we
have<00:05:20.400> the<00:05:21.240> power<00:05:21.510> to<00:05:21.690> do<00:05:22.020> so<00:05:22.230> without<00:05:22.500> being

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 
have the power to do so without being

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.040 
have the power to do so without being
caught<00:05:23.040> because<00:05:23.550> we<00:05:23.910> have<00:05:24.120> all<00:05:24.690> of<00:05:24.930> these

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
caught because we have all of these

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.080 
caught because we have all of these
technological<00:05:25.470> devices<00:05:26.130> where<00:05:26.610> we<00:05:26.760> can<00:05:26.910> just

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:27.090 
technological devices where we can just

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:29.420 
technological devices where we can just
go<00:05:27.660> on<00:05:27.690> a<00:05:27.870> website<00:05:28.140> the<00:05:28.680> anonymous<00:05:29.220> and

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:29.430 
go on a website the anonymous and

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:32.840 
go on a website the anonymous and
comment<00:05:30.300> on<00:05:30.420> things<00:05:31.130> which<00:05:32.130> are<00:05:32.250> so<00:05:32.430> profound

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:32.850 
comment on things which are so profound

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:35.270 
comment on things which are so profound
and<00:05:33.240> can<00:05:33.480> affect<00:05:33.720> somebody<00:05:34.140> and<00:05:34.410> just<00:05:34.440> walk

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.280 
and can affect somebody and just walk

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.240 
and can affect somebody and just walk
away<00:05:35.460> because<00:05:35.820> we<00:05:36.210> wanted<00:05:36.480> to<00:05:36.540> get<00:05:36.930> that<00:05:36.990> out

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:37.250 
away because we wanted to get that out

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:40.460 
away because we wanted to get that out
for<00:05:38.250> no<00:05:38.520> reason<00:05:38.550> so<00:05:39.510> I<00:05:39.540> think<00:05:40.170> what<00:05:40.350> we<00:05:40.440> should

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:40.470 
for no reason so I think what we should

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:43.430 
for no reason so I think what we should
all<00:05:40.770> do<00:05:41.010> for<00:05:41.280> 2014<00:05:42.000> is<00:05:42.300> take<00:05:42.930> a<00:05:42.960> step<00:05:43.230> back<00:05:43.410> and

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:43.440 
all do for 2014 is take a step back and

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.400 
all do for 2014 is take a step back and
before<00:05:43.920> we<00:05:44.130> post<00:05:44.430> anything<00:05:44.850> online<00:05:45.540> I've<00:05:46.200> send
