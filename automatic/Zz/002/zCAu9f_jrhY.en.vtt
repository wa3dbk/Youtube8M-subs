this is Chris and Boise in this video
we're<00:00:07.809> going<00:00:07.899> to<00:00:07.959> be<00:00:08.109> prepping<00:00:08.590> an<00:00:09.039> epoxy

00:00:09.449 --> 00:00:09.459 
we're going to be prepping an epoxy

00:00:09.459 --> 00:00:13.349 
we're going to be prepping an epoxy
floor<00:00:10.030> to<00:00:10.959> get<00:00:11.379> it<00:00:11.469> ready<00:00:11.709> to<00:00:12.039> put<00:00:12.369> calcloud

floor to get it ready to put calcloud
high<00:00:13.600> solids<00:00:13.900> epoxy<00:00:14.500> on<00:00:14.619> it<00:00:14.799> and<00:00:15.010> we've<00:00:15.279> been

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:15.309 
high solids epoxy on it and we've been

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:18.509 
high solids epoxy on it and we've been
spraying<00:00:16.000> the<00:00:16.960> muriatic<00:00:17.470> acid<00:00:17.619> on<00:00:18.160> the<00:00:18.250> floor

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:18.519 
spraying the muriatic acid on the floor

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:20.940 
spraying the muriatic acid on the floor
to<00:00:18.789> acid<00:00:19.359> etch<00:00:19.480> the<00:00:19.689> floor<00:00:19.960> you<00:00:20.680> want<00:00:20.800> the

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:20.950 
to acid etch the floor you want the

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.880 
to acid etch the floor you want the
floor<00:00:21.220> to<00:00:21.550> be<00:00:21.750> acid<00:00:22.750> etched<00:00:22.930> well<00:00:23.260> so<00:00:23.560> it<00:00:23.680> has<00:00:23.860> a

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:23.890 
floor to be acid etched well so it has a

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.060 
floor to be acid etched well so it has a
good<00:00:24.250> profile<00:00:24.820> and<00:00:25.210> be<00:00:25.990> rough<00:00:26.260> enough<00:00:26.289> for<00:00:26.830> the

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:27.070 
good profile and be rough enough for the

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.380 
good profile and be rough enough for the
epoxy<00:00:28.029> to<00:00:28.449> bond<00:00:28.779> to<00:00:29.140> the<00:00:30.010> concrete<00:00:30.670> if<00:00:31.119> the

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:31.390 
epoxy to bond to the concrete if the

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.340 
epoxy to bond to the concrete if the
floor<00:00:31.690> is<00:00:31.720> too<00:00:32.020> smooth<00:00:32.529> then<00:00:33.370> the<00:00:33.850> epoxy<00:00:34.480> will

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:35.350 
floor is too smooth then the epoxy will

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.349 
floor is too smooth then the epoxy will
get<00:00:35.620> a<00:00:35.649> good<00:00:35.859> bite<00:00:36.129> to<00:00:36.190> the<00:00:36.609> concrete<00:00:37.059> and

00:00:37.349 --> 00:00:37.359 
get a good bite to the concrete and

00:00:37.359 --> 00:00:40.049 
get a good bite to the concrete and
there's<00:00:37.510> a<00:00:37.569> good<00:00:37.690> chance<00:00:37.960> that<00:00:38.170> a<00:00:38.679> car<00:00:39.670> pulling

00:00:40.049 --> 00:00:40.059 
there's a good chance that a car pulling

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:42.719 
there's a good chance that a car pulling
into<00:00:40.359> the<00:00:41.019> garage<00:00:41.050> could<00:00:41.859> actually<00:00:42.039> lift<00:00:42.550> up

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:42.729 
into the garage could actually lift up

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:44.969 
into the garage could actually lift up
and<00:00:42.940> peel<00:00:43.149> up<00:00:43.359> the<00:00:43.809> epoxy<00:00:44.350> if<00:00:44.440> the<00:00:44.530> tires<00:00:44.769> are

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:44.979 
and peel up the epoxy if the tires are

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:50.069 
and peel up the epoxy if the tires are
too<00:00:45.010> hot<00:00:45.339> and<00:00:45.809> in<00:00:46.809> order<00:00:47.350> to<00:00:47.789> spray<00:00:48.789> this<00:00:49.089> floor

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:50.079 
too hot and in order to spray this floor

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:53.459 
too hot and in order to spray this floor
with<00:00:50.350> muriatic<00:00:51.010> acid<00:00:51.100> we<00:00:51.639> use<00:00:51.850> just<00:00:52.210> a<00:00:52.510> regular

really really smooth I'll use it a

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.150 
really really smooth I'll use it a

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:37.690 
itching to get it rough I'll just use

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.140 
itching to get it rough I'll just use
100%<00:01:38.080> of<00:01:38.650> muriatic<00:01:38.980> acid<00:01:39.130> and<00:01:39.730> you<00:01:39.820> can<00:01:39.970> see

we've sprayed this muriatic acid and
it's<00:01:43.510> still<00:01:43.720> yellow<00:01:44.080> where<00:01:44.440> it's<00:01:44.560> actually

driveway<00:01:59.140> before<00:01:59.770> it<00:01:59.860> diluted<00:02:00.490> you<00:02:01.060> could

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
driveway before it diluted you could

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.040

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:07.900 
this is a brick pavers driveway so we

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:08.440 
this is a brick pavers driveway so we
want<00:02:08.110> to

power washed out of the pores of the

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:40.430 
power washed out of the pores of the
concrete<00:07:38.070> will<00:07:38.760> cause<00:07:39.000> an<00:07:39.210> adhesion<00:07:39.630> problem

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:40.440 
concrete will cause an adhesion problem

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:44.630 
concrete will cause an adhesion problem
with<00:07:41.220> the<00:07:41.760> epoxy<00:07:42.390> adhering<00:07:43.140> to<00:07:43.320> the<00:07:44.130> concrete

with the epoxy adhering to the concrete
so<00:07:44.970> you<00:07:45.030> got<00:07:45.180> to<00:07:45.270> make<00:07:45.360> sure<00:07:45.630> you<00:07:46.290> take<00:07:46.530> your

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:46.560 
so you got to make sure you take your

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:51.170 
so you got to make sure you take your
time<00:07:46.740> and<00:07:47.250> power<00:07:47.700> wash<00:07:48.030> it<00:07:48.300> extremely<00:07:48.960> well
