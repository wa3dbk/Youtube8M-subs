guys<00:01:37.740> catch<00:01:37.980> my<00:01:38.190> drift<00:01:38.570> okay<00:01:39.570> now<00:01:40.320> we<00:01:41.070> want<00:01:41.280> to

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:41.870 
guys catch my drift okay now we want to

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.920 
guys catch my drift okay now we want to
do<00:01:42.870> the<00:01:43.500> spreading<00:01:43.860> one<00:01:44.130> so<00:01:44.310> basically<00:01:44.930> you

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
do the spreading one so basically you

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.240 
do the spreading one so basically you
have<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.080> get<00:01:46.290> out<00:01:46.320> like<00:01:46.680> a<00:01:46.710> good<00:01:46.950> angle

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
have to get out like a good angle

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.100 
have to get out like a good angle
because<00:01:47.850> sometimes<00:01:48.420> doesn't<00:01:48.810> work<00:01:48.840> and<00:01:49.050> you

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
because sometimes doesn't work and you

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.900 
because sometimes doesn't work and you
just<00:01:49.290> want<00:01:49.470> to<00:01:49.530> spread<00:01:49.680> into<00:01:50.010> it<00:01:50.190> and<00:01:50.340> then

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:50.910 
just want to spread into it and then

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:52.370 
just want to spread into it and then
hopefully<00:01:51.150> you<00:01:51.480> bounce<00:01:51.690> back<00:01:51.990> from<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.260> other

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
hopefully you bounce back from the other

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.190 
hopefully you bounce back from the other
cows<00:01:52.620> so<00:01:53.070> you'd<00:01:53.220> only<00:01:53.280> push<00:01:53.580> me<00:01:53.730> a<00:01:53.760> little<00:01:53.820> bit

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
cows so you'd only push me a little bit
