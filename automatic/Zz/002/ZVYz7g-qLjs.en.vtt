00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:15.041
We have designed and built an

00:00:15.041 --> 00:00:17.233
origami robot that gets up and

00:00:17.233 --> 00:00:19.174
goes. In other words, the robot

00:00:19.174 --> 00:00:21.270
forms itself, on the spot,

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.364
accomplishes tasks and then it

00:00:23.364 --> 00:00:25.966
disappears by degradation.

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:28.722
The robot self-assembles using a

00:00:28.722 --> 00:00:30.378
folding process that is triggered

00:00:30.378 --> 00:00:33.042
by heating. After this the robot

00:00:33.042 --> 00:00:35.234
can run along designated

00:00:35.234 --> 00:00:37.112
trajectories, it can carry

00:00:37.112 --> 00:00:39.276
objects, it can clear obstacles

00:00:39.276 --> 00:00:42.247
and it can swim. It can execute

00:00:42.247 --> 00:00:44.567
a variety of tasks and when

00:00:44.567 --> 00:00:46.694
these tasks are done the robot

00:00:46.694 --> 00:00:49.267
can recycle itself by dissolving

00:00:49.267 --> 00:00:51.129
its body into a liquid.

00:00:53.307 --> 00:00:55.155
This is the first robotic device

00:00:55.155 --> 00:00:57.283
that completes a full life-cycle

00:00:57.283 --> 00:00:59.605
from birth to its death.

00:00:59.605 --> 00:01:01.264
Typical robots consists of

00:01:01.264 --> 00:01:04.270
electronic devices. Our robot

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:06.555
is made based on controllable

00:01:06.555 --> 00:01:08.381
materials; this is the biggest

00:01:08.381 --> 00:01:10.946
difference. The robots body has

00:01:10.946 --> 00:01:13.512
embedded in it a small magnet.

00:01:13.512 --> 00:01:15.332
This allows us to control the

00:01:15.332 --> 00:01:17.740
robot by programming a magnetic

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.933
field. In other words, the robot

00:01:19.933 --> 00:01:22.684
has external, programmable

00:01:22.684 --> 00:01:24.468
actuation. Currently the robot

00:01:24.468 --> 00:01:26.251
is controlled remotely by a

00:01:26.251 --> 00:01:28.133
person. We'd like to advance

00:01:28.133 --> 00:01:30.201
this robot and make it more

00:01:30.201 --> 00:01:32.261
intelligent. Such that it can

00:01:32.261 --> 00:01:34.422
make decisions by itself.

00:01:34.422 --> 00:01:36.678
Origami inspired robot designs

00:01:36.678 --> 00:01:38.395
have the potential to be faster,

00:01:38.395 --> 00:01:40.303
cheaper, and easier to fabricate

00:01:40.303 --> 00:01:42.373
than robots created using

00:01:42.373 --> 00:01:44.070
traditional manufacturing

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.883
processes.

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:47.826
It is easier for such a system

00:01:47.826 --> 00:01:49.799
to be used closer to humans such

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.426
as in the human body. For example

00:01:52.426 --> 00:01:54.807
you could regard this robot as a

00:01:54.807 --> 00:01:57.064
controllable drug capsule or a

00:01:57.064 --> 00:01:59.164
surgical tool which can be

00:01:59.164 --> 00:02:01.167
removed after its used in the

00:02:01.167 --> 00:02:03.367
body. You can imagine ingesting

00:02:03.367 --> 00:02:05.211
these robots and then controlling

00:02:05.211 --> 00:02:07.427
where they travel in the body.

00:02:07.427 --> 00:02:09.766
Once they arrive at the correct

00:02:09.766 --> 00:02:11.608
location they could form

00:02:11.608 --> 00:02:13.517
themselves into active instruments

00:02:13.517 --> 00:02:15.484
that can actually manipulate and

00:02:15.484 --> 00:02:17.082
help through the healing

00:02:17.082 --> 00:02:19.087
processes. For the short-term

00:02:19.087 --> 00:02:20.532
we see these robots as

00:02:20.532 --> 00:02:22.230
potentially extremely useful

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.016
in inspection tasks because they

00:02:24.016 --> 00:02:26.270
are small and they can travel

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:27.742
through very intricate and small

00:02:27.742 --> 00:02:29.637
narrow pipelines that are

00:02:29.637 --> 00:02:31.450
difficult to inspect with today's

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:32.705
technology.
