00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
I usually roll it right on up to the

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.750 
I usually roll it right on up to the
peat<00:00:48.210> moss<00:00:48.239> bag<00:00:48.840> and<00:00:49.140> then<00:00:49.950> start<00:00:50.280> loading<00:00:50.520> it

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
peat moss bag and then start loading it

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:51.709 
peat moss bag and then start loading it
up<00:00:50.850> with<00:00:51.090> a<00:00:51.120> shovel

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
up with a shovel

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.319 
up with a shovel
and<00:00:52.710> what<00:00:53.100> this<00:00:53.219> does<00:00:53.430> it's<00:00:53.670> got<00:00:53.850> expanded

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
and what this does it's got expanded

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.689 
and what this does it's got expanded
diamond<00:00:54.870> cut<00:00:55.079> metal<00:00:55.289> on<00:00:55.530> there<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:55.860> it<00:00:56.520> keeps

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
diamond cut metal on there and it keeps

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.200 
diamond cut metal on there and it keeps
the<00:00:57.420> very<00:00:57.660> large<00:00:57.960> chunks<00:00:58.440> of<00:00:58.530> peat<00:00:58.739> moss<00:00:59.210> from

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
the very large chunks of peat moss from

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.360 
the very large chunks of peat moss from
getting<00:01:00.600> onto<00:01:00.750> your<00:01:01.020> lawn<00:01:01.260> one<00:01:02.219> of<00:01:02.309> the

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
getting onto your lawn one of the

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.520 
getting onto your lawn one of the
problems<00:01:02.730> I<00:01:02.879> I<00:01:03.120> see<00:01:03.570> mostly<00:01:03.870> with<00:01:04.080> homeowners

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
problems I I see mostly with homeowners

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.609 
problems I I see mostly with homeowners
is<00:01:04.920> they<00:01:05.400> put<00:01:05.580> on<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.790> peat<00:01:05.970> moss<00:01:06.229> too<00:01:07.229> thick

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
is they put on the peat moss too thick

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.399 
is they put on the peat moss too thick
then<00:01:08.159> it<00:01:08.310> locks<00:01:08.580> or<00:01:08.820> binds<00:01:09.240> together<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:10.170> seed

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
then it locks or binds together the seed

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:11.929 
then it locks or binds together the seed
will<00:01:10.590> germinate<00:01:10.619> underneath<00:01:11.430> and<00:01:11.729> it<00:01:11.820> will

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
will germinate underneath and it will

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.850 
will germinate underneath and it will
die<00:01:12.180> because<00:01:12.450> it<00:01:12.659> cannot<00:01:12.900> cannot<00:01:13.380> get<00:01:13.590> through

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
die because it cannot cannot get through

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.030 
die because it cannot cannot get through
there<00:01:14.159> so<00:01:15.170> the<00:01:16.170> peat<00:01:16.290> moss<00:01:16.320> rubber<00:01:16.770> really

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
there so the peat moss rubber really

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.609 
there so the peat moss rubber really
helps<00:01:17.340> I<00:01:17.549> keep<00:01:17.939> it<00:01:18.060> a<00:01:18.150> little<00:01:18.390> thin<00:01:18.659> I<00:01:18.869> did<00:01:19.590> a

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
helps I keep it a little thin I did a

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.050 
helps I keep it a little thin I did a
couple<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:19.979> little<00:01:20.070> strips<00:01:20.430> here<00:01:20.640> as<00:01:20.880> an

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
couple of little strips here as an

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.660 
couple of little strips here as an
example<00:01:21.450> for<00:01:21.630> him<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.680> like<00:01:23.220> I<00:01:23.340> say<00:01:23.520> this

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
example for him and like I say this

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.249
