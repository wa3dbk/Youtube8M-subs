00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.550
 we just launched to the market yap money 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.380
 money is an application for 

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:17.270
 different types of smartphones that makes 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:19.220
 a very simple thing 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.680
 allow money to be sent from a 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.790
 telephone to another the individuals to the 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.800
 just like today any 

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:26.270
 You can send me a message from 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.880
 text from a smartphone to all smartphone 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:30.980
 the same thing instantaneously and free 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.870
 but with money that is perhaps the best 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.059
 way to briefly summarize what is already 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.040
 already put a 'joint venture' person formed 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:38.840
 by caixabank banco santander and 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.120
 phone with the objective of 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.710
 develop digital business these 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.480
 three large corporations have decided 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.699
 join forces to create a company 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.710
 independent that allows to combine the 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:50.930
 force to the great ones and the agility of 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.340
 a startup of a small company the 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.900
 main advantage that has the use of the 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.340
 currency is that it solves a need 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.170
 basic that we have all that are those 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.940
 small payments that person who owes you 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.590
 three euros and you do not agree with her that 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.270
 you end up forgetting that he owes you three 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.610
 euros solves it in a very easy way 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.350
 and that's why we believe that very quickly 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.259
 that pretty much the Spanish population 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:12.380
 already mont and has many possible uses for 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:14.270
 example yesterday we had dinner two people and 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.530
 I owe twenty euros and we're not going to 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.810
 see physically I send them with the 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.310
 mobile for example let's buy a 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.289
 Gift seven people buy me 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.170
 and I ask each of the other six 

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:24.939
 those seven euros 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.700
 that kind of examples are the most 

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:28.799
 natural 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.299
 the future in the digital realm is never 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.280
 He knows where he goes what does that 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.600
 I am very clear that we are going to go 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.770
 evolving from there that every time 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.840
 we will use more devices 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.140
 digital for the different types of 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.450
 transactions and that in that battle there 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.740
 to try to learn and evolve very 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.740
 quickly to accompany the market 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.130
 for joining us in a day 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.650
 that combination of forces 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.230
 are those who are going 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.700
 ah 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:34.300
 for the moment the objective 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.480
 he did not want to explain porn together 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.780
 but you can say things about people 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.970
 either manual or automatic 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.270
 let's die 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:47.890
 good 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.890
 right now he's living 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.580
 with the money from us 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.580
 I'm going to talk 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.720
 alexia please 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.920
 quite 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:35.810
 as soon as
