want the dog's head to be controlled so

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.270 
want the dog's head to be controlled so
that<00:00:11.550> we're<00:00:12.179> able<00:00:12.360> to<00:00:12.540> have<00:00:13.380> him<00:00:13.650> not<00:00:13.679> reach

that we're able to have him not reach

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.970 
that we're able to have him not reach
the<00:00:14.490> part<00:00:14.730> of<00:00:14.820> his<00:00:14.910> body<00:00:15.179> by<00:00:15.780> either<00:00:15.960> flank<00:00:16.650> or

an incision or bandage and he can't lick
or<00:00:21.660> chew<00:00:22.260> on<00:00:22.500> it<00:00:22.710> or<00:00:22.920> remove<00:00:23.250> stitches<00:00:23.869> so<00:00:24.869> this

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
or chew on it or remove stitches so this

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.519 
or chew on it or remove stitches so this
is<00:00:25.140> why<00:00:25.260> we<00:00:25.439> put<00:00:25.619> them<00:00:25.740> on<00:00:25.859> a<00:00:26.869> dog<00:00:27.869> they<00:00:28.140> come<00:00:28.380> in

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
is why we put them on a dog they come in

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.349 
is why we put them on a dog they come in
two<00:00:28.710> types<00:00:28.740> they<00:00:29.250> come<00:00:29.460> in<00:00:29.580> two<00:00:29.670> clear<00:00:29.970> and<00:00:30.240> the

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
two types they come in two clear and the

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.799 
two types they come in two clear and the
frosty<00:00:31.489> this<00:00:32.489> one<00:00:32.730> is<00:00:32.820> a<00:00:32.940> clear<00:00:33.210> so<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.600> dog

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
frosty this one is a clear so the dog

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.810 
frosty this one is a clear so the dog
can<00:00:34.020> see<00:00:34.320> he<00:00:34.500> doesn't<00:00:34.860> lose<00:00:35.010> his<00:00:35.309> peripheral

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
can see he doesn't lose his peripheral

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.630 
can see he doesn't lose his peripheral
vision<00:00:36.329> as<00:00:36.480> much<00:00:36.690> with<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.710> frosty<00:00:38.250> you<00:00:38.399> can't

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
vision as much with the frosty you can't

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.340 
vision as much with the frosty you can't
see<00:00:38.879> what<00:00:39.030> straight<00:00:39.300> ahead<00:00:39.480> and<00:00:39.899> goes<00:00:40.079> into<00:00:40.320> a

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
see what straight ahead and goes into a

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.180 
see what straight ahead and goes into a
tunnel<00:00:40.710> vision<00:00:40.829> situation<00:00:42.469> by<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.950> water

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
tunnel vision situation by the water

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.350 
tunnel vision situation by the water
step<00:00:45.590> to<00:00:46.590> put<00:00:46.770> one<00:00:46.920> together<00:00:47.149> and<00:00:48.149> take<00:00:48.329> the

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
step to put one together and take the

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.660 
step to put one together and take the
measurement<00:00:48.840> of<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:48.960> dog<00:00:49.200> and<00:00:49.500> then<00:00:50.280> you<00:00:50.309> just

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
measurement of the dog and then you just

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.660 
measurement of the dog and then you just
loop<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:50.910> loops<00:00:51.270> through<00:00:51.629> in<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.410> out

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
loop the loops through in and out

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.250 
loop the loops through in and out
according<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.879> size<00:00:54.090> this<00:00:54.449> has<00:00:54.660> one<00:00:54.989> size

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
according to the size this has one size

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.580 
according to the size this has one size
to<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:55.649> size<00:00:55.920> three<00:00:56.760> sizes<00:00:57.140> the<00:00:58.140> size<00:00:58.379> your

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
to a size three sizes the size your

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.849 
to a size three sizes the size your
first<00:00:58.829> of<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.070> neck<00:00:59.690> the<00:01:00.690> this<00:01:01.199> is<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.590> part

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
first of the neck the this is the part

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.170 
first of the neck the this is the part
that's<00:01:01.920> important<00:01:02.579> that<00:01:02.730> it's<00:01:02.850> going<00:01:03.030> to<00:01:03.090> be

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
that's important that it's going to be

this is a little large for him would you
see<00:01:38.880> that<00:01:38.909> it's<00:01:39.150> much<00:01:39.270> clearer<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:39.990> you<00:01:40.259> can

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
see that it's much clearer and you can

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.310 
see that it's much clearer and you can
see<00:01:40.650> through<00:01:40.920> it<00:01:41.479> it's<00:01:42.479> not<00:01:42.659> a<00:01:42.720> model<00:01:42.990> that<00:01:43.200> I

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
see through it it's not a model that I
