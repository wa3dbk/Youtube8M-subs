00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:06.540
 hello i have the new assortment of 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.220
 patrice spotted and the same 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.540
 of course struck and I want 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.160
 Just show me what I do 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.930
 took what I am on 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.120
 Most were curious about this clinic 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:17.010
 statistics tubes that are here 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.480
 I have a calypso license there 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.750
 Immediately four pieces of taken 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:25.800
 once the 0.20 rest in peace 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:30.840
 then the 0 30 do not think just pink then 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:33.510
 the 0 60 go flamingo and the 0 80 shears 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.690
 yes these are the four pieces that I have 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.820
 I did not take anything with me and I did not 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.890
 so great was the patrice was 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.930
 simply that you have no test data that 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.520
 means I could not see if that 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.960
 now really the color is because of me 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.700
 on the basis of the packaging, you can find that 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.829
 actually do not always say it right 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.270
 and that's because I like that a bit 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.829
 pity, but I have this now 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.600
 drive taken you see now too 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.110
 these lip switches I made 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.090
 have 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.710
 a review on this is yet to come 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.309
 That's why I'm not going to do anything about it 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.329
 say 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.100
 Of course, then I have the new one 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.289
 foundation taken away this is the 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.630
 mail plus tja this former 

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:08.790
 feels matt foundation very similar 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.070
 looks from the packaging and me 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.030
 now have the color 0 30 so have 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.680
 I have not tried it yet 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.690
 I can say that the color 0 10 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.640
 So she is really very bright 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.979
 is on my skin already knows 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.689
 so I am hopeful that 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.080
 Maybe you like the color 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.549
 here 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.170
 Of course I will again 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.880
 extra view then I have two more 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.189
 Oscars taken once the 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.560
 glamor doll in waterproof and the 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:34.140
 leaves then full flashes mascara too 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.460
 stuck in water I think there I am 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.170
 also to make an extra video 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.770
 but yes, I'm already saying she has 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.810
 a pretty big brush and I'm wearing it 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.220
 today and two new ones 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.500
 eyeshadows namely those of these 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.860
 Liquid metal shadows were also allowed 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.360
 first the color 0 20 golden rules and 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.670
 I think that's a really great one 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.340
 color so a real yes so a rosÃ© 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.159
 just gold and yes that 's really all 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.869
 great is shimmering really intense and 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.490
 yes it is really a very complete one 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:06.170
 nice color and then I still have 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:09.780
 taken color 0 90 negative 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.400
 and yes, our dark brown and me 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.779
 the palettes also fit great 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.950
 igniter took it with me too 

00:02:12.779 --> 00:02:16.709
 today's eye make up 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.970
 painted make-up who have I for it 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.379
 not used now and I think that 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.300
 Both are in perfect harmony with each other 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:22.980
 And as I said so this color gold 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.300
 Big is really great in any case 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.830
 and three of the new ones 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.910
 monolith shadows were allowed too 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:32.459
 namely the 670 vanilla in scarves 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.650
 yes, I have to blind synonymous today 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:40.140
 used before sometime the colors then 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:43.849
 the 660 eyes wide open and the color 680 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:47.310
 sign on greig yes so they are now 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:49.370
 all matte statements now here the 680th 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.500
 stands on greig this has that is one 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:55.680
 more monstrous and the others will 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.390
 I certainly use it as a highlighter 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.530
 or just to prime 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.019
 before I eyeball the others 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.250
 use or just to blind 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:02.819
 So I find the two quite 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.900
 really great 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:06.120
 then , of course, was also the new 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.250
 eyeliner with the promise quite 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.599
 to draw fine lines and me 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.280
 have that now the waterproof 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:13.890
 version and I have to say 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.989
 So from the order I found them 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.389
 now really very easy to 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:21.690
 So it really is a very complete one 

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:25.260
 thin point and the hairs are 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:27.000
 even so are too hard so now are 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.920
 not so true i do not think that now 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.290
 so good that you otherwise they are tough you 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.810
 are tied up and that's what I think 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.519
 That's really easy to do with it then 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.049
 just this very very fine line 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:38.010
 I can pull that too today 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:39.930
 used now 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.519
 whether he holds this long now I can 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.720
 of course not say but of the 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:44.970
 the application is really great 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.280
 then a really curious about this 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.870
 insight a highlight and I have 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.730
 of course also taken and I have 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.859
 applied it twice now 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.079
 and I have to say so it has now 

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:57.720
 both times not really good 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:04:00.480
 looked because he has so dropped off 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.950
 from the inner eyelid yes he has himself 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.530
 me was the same 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.730
 somehow merged with it and looked good 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.420
 I do not know maybe it lies 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.349
 because he is waterproof 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.910
 Maybe it is because of it in any case 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:13.590
 was not so good with me and now 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.190
 I honestly have more of them 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.299
 promised 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.099
 but I'll get him one more time 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:20.549
 Four more were allowed to test a little further 

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:24.030
 from the new multi color lipsticks 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:26.460
 with and once the color 0.20 red 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:31.110
 the 0 40 0 40 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:33.690
 here the new 60 doping power amp and the 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:35.099
 0 70 license to pack yes these are the 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.479
 colors that I have taken me there 

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:38.550
 there were a few more 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:39.840
 I think about it now again 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.880
 That's why I say extra video 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.800
 now nothing to it but you can you 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.539
 ever look at the lip switches 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.220
 the last lip product is likely to 

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:50.520
 is the new one from the ultimate shine 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:52.800
 row and although the 250 yes we can the 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:55.949
 and that is actually a very nice one 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:59.610
 So a really bright pink color 

00:04:55.949 --> 00:05:01.410
 and the problem is just that he 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.940
 Somehow not on my lips 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:04.680
 right to the validity comes so I have 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:08.250
 already very heavily pigmented 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:09.630
 lips and then he can not do that 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:11.970
 properly enforce because he of course 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:14.520
 Also this coupon series comes and 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:15.570
 not really covering power, so I have 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.070
 I think I would have hit me now 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:20.430
 He can now work on me really 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:21.930
 why normal labello so yes but yes 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:24.360
 if you're that bright guy maybe 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:26.159
 then you can see better on you 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.690
 the only product that works with lips 

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:30.509
 it is probably this nail polish in the 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:34.229
 color 45 catch me if you can 

00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:37.080
 and yes, that's one with a lot of music 

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:38.099
 and silver glitter and I wanted that 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.500
 just try it 

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:42.419
 For these, eat stage at home products 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:44.219
 that I just put it on the fashion 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:45.719
 make days on it and it just so so 

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:46.949
 as a talker used for it 

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:49.380
 Just try it out and what 

00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:51.330
 Of course, absolutely absolutely on everyone 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:53.639
 Case with pattern is the new cover 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:57.509
 namely the color 0 70 pinka bell 

00:05:53.639 --> 00:06:00.090
 yes that's that extreme pink 

00:05:57.509 --> 00:06:01.560
 and yes I already had it on now 

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:03.240
 you really have to be very careful with the 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:05.490
 dosage is really very strong 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:06.719
 pigmented and try just such a 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:08.280
 have already looked for color then much 

00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:09.630
 seems to be in any case to the 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.820
 So the things I get out of the 

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:13.139
 got new patrick assortment too 

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:15.180
 most products will come again 

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:16.169
 an extra detailed review that 

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:17.789
 Should only be one 

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:19.289
 Overview what I already thought 

00:06:17.789 --> 00:06:20.729
 I also like to have brought 

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:23.009
 Maybe you also write something 

00:06:20.729 --> 00:06:24.810
 have already secured and then I hope 

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:27.979
 of course the video has fallen and in 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:27.979
 We'll be back next time
