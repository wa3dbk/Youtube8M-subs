00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
so where the night the no longer using

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.799 
so where the night the no longer using
prestige<00:00:43.710> tokens<00:00:44.220> you<00:00:44.820> automatically<00:00:45.360> get

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
prestige tokens you automatically get

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.540 
prestige tokens you automatically get
them<00:00:46.020> like<00:00:46.200> every<00:00:46.739> time<00:00:46.860> you<00:00:46.980> prestige<00:00:47.190> was

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
them like every time you prestige was

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:48.979 
them like every time you prestige was
probably<00:00:47.790> get<00:00:48.000> one<00:00:48.090> so<00:00:48.480> it's<00:00:48.630> sort<00:00:48.720> of<00:00:48.840> similar

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
probably get one so it's sort of similar

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.750 
probably get one so it's sort of similar
to<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.260> prestige<00:00:49.559> token<00:00:49.980> be<00:00:50.100> cut<00:00:50.399> but<00:00:50.670> you<00:00:50.730> I

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
to the prestige token be cut but you I

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.110 
to the prestige token be cut but you I
think<00:00:51.000> you<00:00:51.059> only<00:00:51.180> get<00:00:51.329> one<00:00:52.460> each<00:00:53.460> tiny

think you only get one each tiny

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.060 
think you only get one each tiny
prestige<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:54.989> obviously<00:00:55.500> there<00:00:55.680> you<00:00:55.800> can<00:00:55.950> buy

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070

know made it how they wanted to make it
and<00:01:52.350> it<00:01:52.470> was<00:01:53.009> a<00:01:53.040> very<00:01:53.130> good<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:53.729> I<00:01:54.119> think<00:01:54.900> it's

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
and it was a very good and I think it's

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.539 
and it was a very good and I think it's
so<00:01:55.290> for<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.470> consequences<00:01:55.770> of<00:01:56.070> that<00:01:56.159> because

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
so for the consequences of that because

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.149 
so for the consequences of that because
almost<00:01:57.090> raided<00:01:57.509> in<00:01:57.630> game<00:01:57.780> or<00:01:57.990> so<00:01:58.079> another<00:01:58.290> so

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
almost raided in game or so another so

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.840 
almost raided in game or so another so

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
yeah that's pretty much it really also

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.190

quickly<00:02:04.409> now<00:02:05.329> it's<00:02:06.329> over<00:02:06.509> than<00:02:06.630> it<00:02:06.750> is<00:02:06.869> of<00:02:07.290> a

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
quickly now it's over than it is of a

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.009 
quickly now it's over than it is of a
gun<00:02:07.799> obviously<00:02:08.579> to<00:02:08.640> reload<00:02:08.939> and<00:02:09.209> but<00:02:09.420> what<00:02:09.959> I'm

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:10.019 
gun obviously to reload and but what I'm

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:11.899 
gun obviously to reload and but what I'm
interested<00:02:10.079> in<00:02:10.470> it<00:02:10.649> we're<00:02:11.039> interested<00:02:11.400> in<00:02:11.700> is

00:02:11.899 --> 00:02:11.909 
interested in it we're interested in is

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:14.179 
interested in it we're interested in is
the<00:02:12.120> camo<00:02:12.390> it<00:02:13.109> looks<00:02:13.290> like<00:02:13.379> a<00:02:13.469> red<00:02:13.709> camo<00:02:13.980> a

00:02:14.179 --> 00:02:14.189 
the camo it looks like a red camo a

00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:17.210 
the camo it looks like a red camo a
really<00:02:14.400> high<00:02:14.549> detailed<00:02:15.349> camo

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
really high detailed camo

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.160 
really high detailed camo
so<00:02:17.400> it<00:02:18.120> does<00:02:18.330> suggest<00:02:18.450> that<00:02:18.780> there'll<00:02:19.110> be

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
so it does suggest that there'll be

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.240 
so it does suggest that there'll be
quite<00:02:19.350> a<00:02:19.410> few<00:02:19.590> cameras<00:02:19.890> coming<00:02:20.070> back

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
quite a few cameras coming back

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.540 
quite a few cameras coming back
obviously<00:02:20.430> read<00:02:20.880> was<00:02:21.150> in<00:02:22.130> the<00:02:23.130> first<00:02:23.340> black

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
obviously read was in the first black

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.700 
obviously read was in the first black
ops<00:02:23.730> wasn't<00:02:24.030> it<00:02:24.150> and<00:02:24.360> we<00:02:24.540> free<00:02:24.690> or<00:02:24.780> anything<00:02:25.140> so

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
ops wasn't it and we free or anything so

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.260 
ops wasn't it and we free or anything so
I<00:02:25.740> think<00:02:26.340> they<00:02:26.400> were<00:02:26.550> going<00:02:26.850> to<00:02:26.910> be<00:02:26.970> bringing

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
I think they were going to be bringing

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:28.640 
I think they were going to be bringing
back<00:02:27.360> a<00:02:27.390> hell<00:02:27.780> of<00:02:27.810> a<00:02:27.900> lot<00:02:28.020> of<00:02:28.110> cameras<00:02:28.410> rather
