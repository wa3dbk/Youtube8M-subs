so<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:24.810> first<00:00:25.019> thing<00:00:25.410> that<00:00:26.220> I<00:00:26.550> suggest<00:00:27.210> is<00:00:27.420> um

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.220 
so the first thing that I suggest is um

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.620 
so the first thing that I suggest is um
always<00:00:29.220> always<00:00:29.519> change<00:00:30.000> your<00:00:30.090> pillowcases

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
always always change your pillowcases

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.310 
always always change your pillowcases
when<00:00:31.349> you<00:00:31.800> can<00:00:32.099> or<00:00:32.550> when<00:00:33.360> they're<00:00:33.480> just<00:00:33.690> you

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
when you can or when they're just you

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.540 
when you can or when they're just you
just<00:00:34.500> feel<00:00:34.710> like<00:00:34.890> they're<00:00:35.100> getting<00:00:35.219> kind<00:00:35.430> of

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
just feel like they're getting kind of

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.650 
just feel like they're getting kind of
dirty<00:00:35.790> because<00:00:36.290> if<00:00:37.290> you<00:00:38.129> don't<00:00:39.059> change<00:00:39.390> them

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
dirty because if you don't change them

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.950 
dirty because if you don't change them
then<00:00:40.079> all<00:00:40.469> of<00:00:40.980> your<00:00:41.190> oils<00:00:41.610> every<00:00:42.420> night<00:00:42.600> go<00:00:42.809> on

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
then all of your oils every night go on

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.200 
then all of your oils every night go on
to<00:00:43.110> your<00:00:43.200> pillow<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:43.590> then<00:00:44.340> that<00:00:44.550> will<00:00:44.820> create

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
to your pillow and then that will create

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.440 
to your pillow and then that will create
worst<00:00:46.110> breakouts<00:00:46.649> so<00:00:47.309> I<00:00:47.370> highly<00:00:47.850> suggest<00:00:48.149> that

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
worst breakouts so I highly suggest that

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.450 
worst breakouts so I highly suggest that
because<00:00:48.690> I<00:00:49.260> even<00:00:49.829> mentioned<00:00:50.160> in<00:00:50.219> my<00:00:50.250> video

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
because I even mentioned in my video

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.580 
because I even mentioned in my video
before<00:00:50.879> that<00:00:51.449> if<00:00:51.750> I<00:00:52.140> don't<00:00:52.320> change<00:00:52.469> my

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
before that if I don't change my

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.350 
before that if I don't change my
pillowcases<00:00:53.070> I<00:00:53.309> nervous<00:00:53.610> on<00:00:53.820> more<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.239> more

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
pillowcases I nervous on more and more

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.420 
pillowcases I nervous on more and more
breakouts<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:55.079> I<00:00:55.320> don't<00:00:55.500> have<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:56.250> most

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
breakouts and I don't have the most

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.340 
breakouts and I don't have the most
perfect<00:00:56.730> skin<00:00:57.149> in<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.360> world<00:00:57.570> but<00:00:57.899> that<00:00:58.170> just

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
perfect skin in the world but that just

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.920 
perfect skin in the world but that just
helps<00:00:58.770> reduce<00:00:59.250> it<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.820> second<00:01:00.480> thing<00:01:00.629> that<00:01:00.690> I

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
helps reduce it the second thing that I

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.560 
helps reduce it the second thing that I
suggest<00:01:01.379> is<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:02.039> clear<00:01:02.640> all<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.180> stress<00:01:03.420> out

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
suggest is to clear all the stress out

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.780 
suggest is to clear all the stress out
of<00:01:03.629> your<00:01:03.840> life<00:01:03.989> or<00:01:04.260> some<00:01:04.530> of<00:01:04.559> it<00:01:04.769> because<00:01:05.549> if

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
of your life or some of it because if

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.399 
of your life or some of it because if
you<00:01:05.939> have<00:01:06.150> a<00:01:06.180> lot<00:01:06.479> of<00:01:06.510> stress<00:01:06.780> in<00:01:06.930> your<00:01:06.960> life<00:01:07.140> it

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
you have a lot of stress in your life it

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.490 
you have a lot of stress in your life it
leads<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:08.460> more<00:01:08.580> breakouts<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.390> I<00:01:09.960> know<00:01:10.229> this

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
leads to more breakouts and I know this

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.100 
leads to more breakouts and I know this
can<00:01:10.860> be<00:01:11.010> hard<00:01:11.189> as<00:01:11.340> like<00:01:11.520> a<00:01:11.700> teenager<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.689> young
