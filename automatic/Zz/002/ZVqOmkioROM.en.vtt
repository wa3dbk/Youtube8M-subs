and<00:01:02.960> you<00:01:03.140> realize<00:01:03.410> if<00:01:03.560> it<00:01:03.680> takes<00:01:03.920> batteries

00:01:04.179 --> 00:01:04.189 
and you realize if it takes batteries

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:06.010 
and you realize if it takes batteries
well<00:01:04.850> it<00:01:05.089> must<00:01:05.269> make<00:01:05.420> some<00:01:05.570> noise<00:01:05.750> and<00:01:05.869> do

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
well it must make some noise and do

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.140 
well it must make some noise and do
something<00:01:06.350> so<00:01:06.560> let's<00:01:07.369> check<00:01:07.640> it<00:01:07.759> out<00:01:07.820> Shelley

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.150 
something so let's check it out Shelley
