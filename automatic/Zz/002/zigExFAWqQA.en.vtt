as<00:01:03.290> they<00:01:03.470> can<00:01:03.620> go

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:14.929 

that

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.700 

it's<00:01:15.270> not<00:01:15.509> really<00:01:15.810> big<00:01:16.020> into<00:01:16.049> like<00:01:16.500> group

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
it's not really big into like group

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.230 
it's not really big into like group
activities<00:01:17.280> even<00:01:17.850> though<00:01:17.939> he<00:01:18.060> likes

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
activities even though he likes

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.240 
activities even though he likes
attention<00:01:18.750> he<00:01:19.229> also<00:01:19.380> likes<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:19.740> be<00:01:19.890> left<00:01:20.039> alone

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
attention he also likes to be left alone

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.039 
attention he also likes to be left alone
so<00:01:20.310> I<00:01:20.520> think<00:01:20.579> it'd<00:01:20.909> be<00:01:20.939> a<00:01:21.060> good<00:01:21.299> good<00:01:21.719> way<00:01:21.780> for

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
so I think it'd be a good good way for

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.950 
so I think it'd be a good good way for
him<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.229> build<00:01:22.829> confidence<00:01:23.070> and<00:01:23.640> also<00:01:24.570> learn
