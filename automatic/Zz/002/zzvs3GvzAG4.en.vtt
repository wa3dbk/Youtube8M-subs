00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
definitely great for younger girls that

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.219 
definitely great for younger girls that
have<00:01:43.350> been<00:01:43.560> wanting<00:01:43.950> fake<00:01:44.100> nails<00:01:44.310> forever<00:01:44.670> and

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
have been wanting fake nails forever and

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:48.410 
have been wanting fake nails forever and
moms<00:01:46.229> always<00:01:46.560> say<00:01:46.890> no<00:01:47.100> so<00:01:47.850> these<00:01:48.000> are<00:01:48.060> great

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
moms always say no so these are great

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.620 
moms always say no so these are great
they're<00:01:48.780> really<00:01:49.680> easy<00:01:49.710> to<00:01:50.040> take<00:01:50.280> off<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:50.850> you

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
they're really easy to take off and you

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.679 
they're really easy to take off and you
don't<00:01:51.659> have<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.320> all<00:01:52.470> nail<00:01:52.860> glue<00:01:53.130> mess<00:01:53.689> now

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
don't have the all nail glue mess now

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.539 
don't have the all nail glue mess now
for<00:01:54.899> these<00:01:55.049> you<00:01:55.409> actually<00:01:55.439> do<00:01:56.040> need<00:01:56.219> to<00:01:56.280> use

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
for these you actually do need to use

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.700 
for these you actually do need to use
some<00:01:56.759> nail<00:01:56.939> glue<00:01:57.149> and<00:01:57.390> there's<00:01:58.079> a<00:01:58.170> couple<00:01:58.409> more

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
some nail glue and there's a couple more

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.730 
some nail glue and there's a couple more
steps<00:01:59.070> to<00:01:59.280> them<00:01:59.549> but<00:02:00.240> i<00:02:00.450> think<00:02:00.810> that<00:02:00.869> they<00:02:01.200> come

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
steps to them but i think that they come

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.620 
steps to them but i think that they come
out<00:02:01.950> nicer<00:02:02.430> and<00:02:02.640> they<00:02:02.790> will<00:02:02.969> last<00:02:03.210> a<00:02:03.479> little

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
out nicer and they will last a little

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.920 
out nicer and they will last a little
bit<00:02:03.750> longer<00:02:04.079> because<00:02:04.469> they<00:02:04.829> are<00:02:05.040> more<00:02:05.700> durable

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
bit longer because they are more durable

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.619 
bit longer because they are more durable
so<00:02:06.930> anyway<00:02:07.280> basically<00:02:08.280> you<00:02:08.940> have<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.420> nails

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
so anyway basically you have the nails

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:10.510 
so anyway basically you have the nails
and<00:02:10.020> then<00:02:10.170> there's

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
and then there's

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.270 
and then there's
more<00:02:11.450> back<00:02:11.660> here<00:02:11.690> too<00:02:12.080> if<00:02:12.200> you<00:02:12.350> need<00:02:12.500> them<00:02:12.680> and

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
more back here too if you need them and

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.250 
more back here too if you need them and
you're<00:02:13.700> just<00:02:13.820> going<00:02:14.000> to<00:02:14.090> find<00:02:14.360> the<00:02:14.690> size<00:02:14.930> that

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
you're just going to find the size that

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.240 
you're just going to find the size that
fits<00:02:15.710> best<00:02:16.010> just<00:02:16.790> like<00:02:16.940> the<00:02:17.120> other<00:02:17.300> ones<00:02:18.250> see

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
fits best just like the other ones see

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.140 
fits best just like the other ones see
that<00:02:19.460> lines<00:02:19.700> were<00:02:20.090> too<00:02:20.300> small<00:02:22.030> so<00:02:23.030> one<00:02:23.120> should

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
that lines were too small so one should

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.480 
that lines were too small so one should
fit<00:02:23.510> and<00:02:24.080> what<00:02:24.320> I<00:02:24.350> love<00:02:24.560> about<00:02:24.620> these<00:02:25.130> is<00:02:25.460> that

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.490 
fit and what I love about these is that

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:27.640 
fit and what I love about these is that
they<00:02:26.060> have<00:02:26.240> this<00:02:26.420> little<00:02:26.570> tab<00:02:26.930> so<00:02:27.350> that<00:02:27.530> you

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
they have this little tab so that you

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:28.990 
they have this little tab so that you
can<00:02:27.830> turn<00:02:28.010> them<00:02:28.130> over<00:02:28.250> and<00:02:28.550> put<00:02:28.700> the<00:02:28.790> glue<00:02:28.970> on

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
can turn them over and put the glue on

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.210 
can turn them over and put the glue on
without<00:02:29.570> getting<00:02:30.050> the<00:02:30.170> glue<00:02:30.380> on<00:02:30.620> your<00:02:30.680> fingers

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
without getting the glue on your fingers

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.160 
without getting the glue on your fingers
because<00:02:31.400> I<00:02:31.550> know<00:02:31.610> it's<00:02:32.300> hard<00:02:32.480> to<00:02:32.660> like<00:02:32.750> hold<00:02:32.990> it

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
because I know it's hard to like hold it

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:34.960 
because I know it's hard to like hold it
like<00:02:33.290> this<00:02:33.320> and<00:02:33.500> put<00:02:33.800> the<00:02:33.890> glue<00:02:34.070> on<00:02:34.100> so

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
like this and put the glue on so

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.520 
like this and put the glue on so
basically<00:02:35.360> all<00:02:35.510> I'm<00:02:35.840> going<00:02:36.020> to<00:02:36.110> do<00:02:36.290> is<00:02:36.500> just

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
basically all I'm going to do is just

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.520 
basically all I'm going to do is just
twist<00:02:37.100> the<00:02:37.430> cap<00:02:37.460> off<00:02:38.000> of<00:02:38.540> this<00:02:38.720> glue<00:02:39.080> that<00:02:39.260> came

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
twist the cap off of this glue that came

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.000 
twist the cap off of this glue that came
with<00:02:39.740> it<00:02:39.770> and<00:02:40.270> this<00:02:41.270> might<00:02:41.450> take<00:02:41.570> a<00:02:41.630> little<00:02:41.810> bit

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
with it and this might take a little bit

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.220 
with it and this might take a little bit
to<00:02:43.010> get<00:02:43.100> the<00:02:43.220> glue<00:02:43.400> to<00:02:43.520> come<00:02:43.730> out<00:02:43.970> but<00:02:44.960> you<00:02:45.020> just

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
to get the glue to come out but you just

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.460 
to get the glue to come out but you just
hold<00:02:45.440> the<00:02:45.590> tab<00:02:45.830> and<00:02:46.160> then<00:02:47.000> you<00:02:47.210> just<00:02:47.510> put<00:02:48.440> a

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
hold the tab and then you just put a

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:54.340 
hold the tab and then you just put a
little<00:02:48.560> dot<00:02:51.280> probably<00:02:52.280> about<00:02:52.690> that<00:02:53.690> much<00:02:53.750> if

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
little dot probably about that much if

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.280 
little dot probably about that much if
you<00:02:54.470> can<00:02:54.620> even<00:02:54.800> see<00:02:55.190> it<00:02:55.700> and<00:02:56.080> then<00:02:57.080> I'm<00:02:57.260> just

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
you can even see it and then I'm just

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:02.890 
you can even see it and then I'm just
going<00:02:57.770> to<00:02:58.150> go<00:02:59.150> ahead<00:02:59.300> and<00:02:59.680> place<00:03:00.680> it<00:03:01.100> right<00:03:01.900> on

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
going to go ahead and place it right on

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.080 
going to go ahead and place it right on
to<00:03:03.500> my<00:03:03.860> nail<00:03:04.040> and<00:03:04.070> hold<00:03:04.430> it<00:03:04.550> down<00:03:04.640> for<00:03:04.910> a<00:03:04.940> couple

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
to my nail and hold it down for a couple

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.980 
to my nail and hold it down for a couple
seconds<00:03:05.600> just<00:03:06.230> uh<00:03:06.440> oh<00:03:06.710> popped<00:03:07.610> up<00:03:07.840> get<00:03:08.840> the
