video<00:01:36.679> and<00:01:36.979> I'm<00:01:37.340> going<00:01:37.490> to<00:01:37.549> take<00:01:37.700> you<00:01:37.789> through

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:37.939 
video and I'm going to take you through

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:42.300 
video and I'm going to take you through
the<00:01:38.029> technique<00:01:38.389> so<00:01:38.420> go<00:01:38.840> do<00:01:38.990> that<00:01:39.109> right<00:01:39.289> now

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.740 

okay<00:01:43.310> hopefully<00:01:43.970> you<00:01:44.150> have<00:01:44.330> something<00:01:44.660> in

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
okay hopefully you have something in

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:45.760 
okay hopefully you have something in
front<00:01:44.930> of<00:01:44.990> you<00:01:45.050> because<00:01:45.140> this<00:01:45.410> technique

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
front of you because this technique

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.530 
front of you because this technique
works<00:01:45.980> a<00:01:46.100> lot<00:01:46.400> better<00:01:46.460> if<00:01:46.850> you<00:01:46.940> actually<00:01:47.390> have

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
works a lot better if you actually have

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:48.880 
works a lot better if you actually have
food<00:01:47.780> in<00:01:47.870> front<00:01:48.020> of<00:01:48.110> you<00:01:48.230> so<00:01:48.350> that<00:01:48.470> you<00:01:48.530> can<00:01:48.650> see

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
food in front of you so that you can see

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.730 
food in front of you so that you can see
measurable<00:01:49.400> results<00:01:50.150> so<00:01:51.020> what<00:01:51.560> you're<00:01:51.650> going

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
measurable results so what you're going

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.120 
measurable results so what you're going
to<00:01:51.800> do<00:01:51.950> is<00:01:52.070> you're<00:01:52.190> going<00:01:52.310> to<00:01:52.370> start<00:01:52.820> by

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
to do is you're going to start by

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.590 
to do is you're going to start by
noticing<00:01:55.130> how<00:01:55.430> much<00:01:55.790> you<00:01:56.030> want<00:01:56.300> the<00:01:56.420> food

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
noticing how much you want the food

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.080 
noticing how much you want the food
right<00:01:56.840> now<00:01:56.990> so<00:01:57.770> we<00:01:57.890> always<00:01:58.070> use<00:01:58.280> with<00:01:58.730> tapping

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
right now so we always use with tapping

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.270 
right now so we always use with tapping
we<00:01:59.210> use<00:01:59.330> a<00:01:59.360> scale<00:01:59.720> from<00:01:59.900> zero<00:02:00.230> to<00:02:00.260> ten<00:02:00.440> zero<00:02:01.070> is

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
we use a scale from zero to ten zero is

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.460 
we use a scale from zero to ten zero is
no<00:02:01.460> craving<00:02:01.850> at<00:02:01.940> all<00:02:02.090> and<00:02:02.330> 10<00:02:02.720> is<00:02:02.900> oh<00:02:03.020> my<00:02:03.290> god<00:02:03.440> I

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
we say three times and the reason that

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.199

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
because our unconscious mind actually

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.560 
because our unconscious mind actually
doesn't<00:03:04.489> like<00:03:04.760> the<00:03:04.970> fact<00:03:05.150> that<00:03:05.239> we<00:03:05.390> have

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
doesn't like the fact that we have

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.270 
doesn't like the fact that we have
problems<00:03:06.050> or<00:03:06.260> that<00:03:06.380> we<00:03:06.470> have<00:03:06.500> good<00:03:06.830> cravings

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
problems or that we have good cravings

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.640 
problems or that we have good cravings
and<00:03:07.459> so<00:03:07.850> it<00:03:08.000> neutralizes<00:03:08.840> any<00:03:08.870> subconscious

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
and so it neutralizes any subconscious

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.470 
and so it neutralizes any subconscious
judgement<00:03:10.100> that<00:03:10.130> we<00:03:10.280> have<00:03:10.459> about<00:03:11.330> ourselves

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
judgement that we have about ourselves

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.330 
judgement that we have about ourselves
and<00:03:11.900> the<00:03:11.959> fact<00:03:12.110> that<00:03:12.200> we're<00:03:12.350> not<00:03:12.470> perfect<00:03:12.680> okay

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
and the fact that we're not perfect okay

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.820 
and the fact that we're not perfect okay
so<00:03:14.239> that's<00:03:14.750> what<00:03:14.930> you<00:03:14.989> do<00:03:15.080> you<00:03:15.110> do<00:03:15.320> three<00:03:15.590> times

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
so that's what you do you do three times

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:17.530 
so that's what you do you do three times
and<00:03:16.160> while<00:03:16.430> you're<00:03:16.670> saying<00:03:16.940> that<00:03:17.150> I<00:03:17.209> really

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
and while you're saying that I really

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:18.940 
and while you're saying that I really
want<00:03:17.720> you<00:03:17.840> to<00:03:17.870> tune<00:03:18.200> into<00:03:18.440> your<00:03:18.470> body<00:03:18.739> and

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
want you to tune into your body and

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:20.770 
want you to tune into your body and
focus<00:03:19.459> on<00:03:19.640> your<00:03:19.850> food<00:03:20.090> craving<00:03:20.450> and<00:03:20.570> really

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
focus on your food craving and really

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.510 
focus on your food craving and really
allow<00:03:20.989> yourself<00:03:21.410> to<00:03:21.500> feel<00:03:21.650> how<00:03:21.860> badly<00:03:22.190> you

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:22.520 
allow yourself to feel how badly you

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.040 
allow yourself to feel how badly you
want<00:03:22.760> it<00:03:22.910> because<00:03:23.120> what<00:03:23.330> we're<00:03:23.480> doing<00:03:23.870> with

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.050 
want it because what we're doing with

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:25.440 
want it because what we're doing with
the<00:03:24.170> tapping<00:03:24.590> so<00:03:24.920> we're<00:03:25.010> actually

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
the tapping so we're actually

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.699 
the tapping so we're actually
reprogramming<00:03:26.450> that<00:03:26.600> memory

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709 
reprogramming that memory

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:30.370 
reprogramming that memory
we're<00:03:28.640> telling<00:03:28.820> your<00:03:29.330> brain<00:03:29.540> that<00:03:29.810> this<00:03:30.170> is

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
we're telling your brain that this is

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.400 
we're telling your brain that this is
just<00:03:30.709> um<00:03:30.950> this<00:03:31.280> is<00:03:31.459> just<00:03:31.760> food<00:03:32.090> it<00:03:32.420> has<00:03:32.930> nothing

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
just um this is just food it has nothing

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:36.280 
just um this is just food it has nothing
to<00:03:33.440> do<00:03:33.709> with<00:03:34.310> your<00:03:34.640> mom<00:03:34.910> who<00:03:35.630> gave<00:03:35.930> it<00:03:36.080> to<00:03:36.200> you

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
to do with your mom who gave it to you

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:37.479 
to do with your mom who gave it to you
when<00:03:36.440> you<00:03:36.530> were<00:03:36.620> eight<00:03:36.770> years<00:03:36.800> old<00:03:37.160> it's

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489 
when you were eight years old it's

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:39.580 
when you were eight years old it's
actually<00:03:37.970> just<00:03:38.239> food<00:03:38.600> and<00:03:38.870> so<00:03:39.080> that's<00:03:39.440> what

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
actually just food and so that's what

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:40.540 
actually just food and so that's what
we're<00:03:39.709> doing<00:03:39.920> while<00:03:40.100> we're<00:03:40.250> doing<00:03:40.340> this

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:40.550 
we're doing while we're doing this

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:41.470 
we're doing while we're doing this
tapping<00:03:40.880> is<00:03:41.000> we're<00:03:41.120> just<00:03:41.150> kind<00:03:41.450> of

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
tapping is we're just kind of

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.660 
tapping is we're just kind of
reprogramming<00:03:42.019> that<00:03:42.050> so<00:03:42.380> the<00:03:43.280> next<00:03:43.459> thing

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
reprogramming that so the next thing

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.490 
reprogramming that so the next thing
that<00:03:43.700> you<00:03:43.910> do<00:03:44.090> is<00:03:44.269> you<00:03:44.750> tap<00:03:44.930> the<00:03:45.110> beginning<00:03:45.410> of
