00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.799
 today we are going to do the retouching of the root of 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.559
 this red color the first thing we're going to 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.110
 to do then is to look at what color she 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:16.440
 has means to ends states I 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:19.590
 gave is that she has a height 6 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:22.050
 and it has an intense stealing height 6 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.900
 So that's what I'm going to 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.390
 apply at the root a height 6 but with 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.630
 Very intense red to the mixture I put 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.669
 then height 6 intense red and for 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.380
 that I left more red like the one that 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.500
 has reach his adds about 10 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.360
 centimeters of intensified reddish and 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.180
 actually has as centimeter and 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.520
 medium root is very little then we go 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.950
 to use a 20-volume peroxide 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.559
 because if we use one of 30 the root 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.500
 we will be too clear then 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.810
 let's do it with 20 peroxide 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.150
 volumes 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.800
 we necessarily have to apply root 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.350
 and then pass a little color to 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.450
 tips because red anyway 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.160
 the first thing that is always falling 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:07.700
 let's do is apply a cream 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:10.580
 protective around the perimeter of the 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:13.790
 hair growth because as it is 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.950
 a reddish tint then so you do not 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.590
 stain the skin we 're going to put some 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.980
 gloves to follow the hair in four 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.980
 parts 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:29.909
 let's apply the color in the root 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:32.450
 as to define those four parts 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.450
 we apply 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.250
 now let's make an exception for 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:43.750
 ear to ear here I'm going to have two 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:46.780
 parts and uncritical to the other section 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.960
 and I'm going to start applying this part of 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.960
 ahead 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:58.450
 we make a thin hair division 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.450
 we eat it by the hand and apply root 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.550
 we are going to apply 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:05.010
 good as we can see this is the 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:07.049
 final result of our color 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:10.170
 you can see that the red 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:13.200
 a deeper red was more intense 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:17.510
 the root was completely covered and is 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.510
 totally even for all the 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:22.310
 friends, I hope you have them 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:26.140
 liked then our root retouching 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.140
 see you in a next video
