is the place that you want to
trim<00:02:37.170> it's<00:02:38.170> safe<00:02:38.470> there<00:02:38.770> because<00:02:39.069> it's<00:02:39.250> not

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
trim it's safe there because it's not

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:45.780 
trim it's safe there because it's not

blood supply in it it's just like

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:58.350 
blood supply in it it's just like
trimming<00:02:53.500> your<00:02:53.650> own<00:02:53.830> nails<00:02:57.090> there<00:02:58.090> are<00:02:58.209> other

trimming your own nails there are other

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.979 
trimming your own nails there are other
positions<00:02:59.110> that<00:02:59.530> your<00:03:00.310> cat<00:03:00.610> might<00:03:01.360> feel<00:03:01.630> more

positions that your cat might feel more
comfortable<00:03:02.590> in<00:03:03.090> this<00:03:04.090> position<00:03:04.150> is

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
comfortable in this position is

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.470 
comfortable in this position is
particularly<00:03:05.920> good<00:03:06.370> for<00:03:06.760> the<00:03:06.910> back<00:03:07.120> nails

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
particularly good for the back nails

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.690 
particularly good for the back nails
which<00:03:08.440> are<00:03:08.620> hard<00:03:08.830> to<00:03:08.980> get<00:03:09.160> in<00:03:09.220> any<00:03:09.610> other

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
which are hard to get in any other

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.360 
which are hard to get in any other
position<00:03:10.630> without<00:03:10.930> your<00:03:11.230> cat<00:03:11.440> trying<00:03:11.799> to<00:03:11.920> get

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
position without your cat trying to get

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.509 
position without your cat trying to get
away<00:03:12.489> from<00:03:12.670> you<00:03:13.620> but<00:03:14.620> you<00:03:14.650> have<00:03:14.920> to<00:03:15.069> experiment

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
away from you but you have to experiment

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:18.780 
away from you but you have to experiment
and<00:03:15.910> try<00:03:16.150> different<00:03:16.230> positions<00:03:17.230> to<00:03:17.549> find<00:03:18.549> what

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
and try different positions to find what

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.509 
and try different positions to find what
works<00:03:18.970> best<00:03:19.180> for<00:03:19.510> you<00:03:19.840> and<00:03:19.870> your<00:03:20.260> cat<00:03:20.650> the

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 
works best for you and your cat the

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:23.400 
works best for you and your cat the
procedure<00:03:21.910> on<00:03:22.150> the<00:03:22.269> back<00:03:22.480> nails<00:03:22.720> is<00:03:23.019> just<00:03:23.290> the

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
procedure on the back nails is just the

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:30.390 
procedure on the back nails is just the
same<00:03:27.660> if<00:03:28.660> your<00:03:28.900> cat's<00:03:29.170> difficult<00:03:29.890> and<00:03:30.099> doesn't

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
same if your cat's difficult and doesn't

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.690 
same if your cat's difficult and doesn't
really<00:03:30.610> like<00:03:30.940> this<00:03:31.239> you<00:03:32.140> can<00:03:32.380> do<00:03:32.680> one<00:03:33.549> or<00:03:33.670> two

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
really like this you can do one or two

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.229 
really like this you can do one or two
nails<00:03:34.030> a<00:03:34.239> day<00:03:34.480> and<00:03:35.489> by<00:03:36.489> the<00:03:36.549> time<00:03:36.849> the<00:03:37.000> weeks

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
nails a day and by the time the weeks

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:38.819 
nails a day and by the time the weeks
over<00:03:37.599> you've<00:03:37.780> done<00:03:38.019> them<00:03:38.140> all<00:03:38.319> and<00:03:38.590> you<00:03:38.650> can

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:38.829 
over you've done them all and you can

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:41.250 
over you've done them all and you can
start<00:03:39.099> over<00:03:39.280> because<00:03:40.120> they<00:03:40.239> do<00:03:40.299> grow<00:03:40.690> quickly

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
start over because they do grow quickly

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:42.449 
start over because they do grow quickly
and<00:03:41.470> you<00:03:41.590> will<00:03:41.680> want<00:03:41.889> to<00:03:41.950> trim<00:03:42.220> the<00:03:42.310> nails

and you will want to trim the nails

00:03:42.459 --> 00:04:03.559 
and you will want to trim the nails
every<00:03:43.030> two<00:03:43.060> weeks<00:03:43.810> probably<00:03:44.139> at<00:03:44.680> least

another position that you can use is

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.209 
another position that you can use is
