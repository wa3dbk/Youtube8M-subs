00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:08.639
 for all of them I did was like in the 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.250
 97 I think with all my best friends 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.559
 Dear people, it is a very 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:17.070
 nice that I have comments raquel night and 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:19.110
 walesa and wedge of varela 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.840
 I made a cover when I was 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:25.590
 competing in my group and sperm 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:29.220
 another when after just before leaving 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:32.669
 to the Miss Universe and join me for my 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.140
 favorite cover when the 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.059
 Income Oscar parade on palmas 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.839
 the opportunity to wear a dress 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:43.050
 princess for a cover and I also did 

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:45.530
 another with michelle dress of chance more 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.120
 recent I think that whatever the last 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.579
 so if nothing is slipping away 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.090
 around 5 maybe there is some other 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.360
 that's why I've done 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:59.260
 that is always something very special because 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.430
 do not be very often and hilarious 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.820
 because I have the opportunity to work 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:05.950
 with my dear friend roberto put that 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.500
 we love each other but we also fight each 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:11.860
 Once we make a cover together like this 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:14.320
 how good is it is something special 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.570
 definitely and always always 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.460
 They carry nice memories of each cover 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.619
 when I made my first cover of them 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.100
 I already met Roberto, we had already 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:26.270
 previously worked together 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:29.420
 we will make friends so 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.340
 our short express friendship is now to 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.980
 the covers of them that we have made 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.830
 together 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:37.360
 and well I think that while more time 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:40.890
 passes are two agreements more tests 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:43.240
 opinions there is more confidence and we are 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.510
 we have a relationship like old people 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:50.410
 married if we do not fight each 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:51.880
 cover every experience is part of 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:55.130
 your development as a model so 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:58.960
 effectively that on every occasion 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:03.640
 Every occasion that is performed is better 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.640
 do a little about a role of mom 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:13.709
 and right now I, as a mom , had 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:16.380
 forgot to mention that I also made a 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:19.040
 photo for the edition of moms when 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:23.069
 I was pregnant and it was obviously something 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:26.069
 super special because share that 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:27.850
 that stage so beautiful and so 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:30.390
 personal 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.390
 It was 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:37.100
 It was very special to me and now that I'm 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:41.120
 good mom but when I have a chance 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:44.150
 to make another cover and how it will be and how 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.730
 be now that you are a mom like how is your 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.950
 role of mom that I have learned and sting 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:52.410
 since she is a mom and what things she can 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:54.240
 give to other moms or moms-to-be 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.780
 well since I'm a mom I've learned 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.780
 what 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.170
 who are you 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.720
 you 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.430
 the structure of your enea still not 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.920
 it has finished developing until the 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:11.950
 moment until the moment you get 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:15.569
 you become more I feel that it has been a 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:17.579
 experience of discovering me 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:20.490
 in this new stage in this new role in 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:23.370
 my life and what 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:24.960
 that for now is the most important thing for 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.720
 my 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:31.470
 and I'm enjoying it immensely 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:35.200
 I imagine you can see 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:37.290
 I do not imagine I am without being a mom 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.290
 ah
