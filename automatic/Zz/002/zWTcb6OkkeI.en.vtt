 must remember the angles the easy 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:51.520
 easy more than 90 degrees 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.830
 he seems straight ahead of it 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.960
 and then there are two more in the winter and 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.400
 A riot behind and was now on hold 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.610
 more a smooth one 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:03.310
 always good marco lisi chord location 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.960
 on steering wheel also religion and is green and 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:06.520

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.040
 And you must know that your bakery is that big 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.930
 and our rough location is green 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.670
 for the people taking the day course 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.710

 am machine medium i want together i have 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:23.740
 there is already a traffic light top it is white and the 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.570
 that is paramount but it is necessary 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.729
 not by you but also in the middle or 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.590
 On the back assembly important if you are good

 looks at the village and the murder 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.460
 direction then you will see the corner of it 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.930
 lights up the same angle as drilled in 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:38.440
 the together and why is it for 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:40.540
 done I will show'll get 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.940
 of this code collision you will see it 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:45.460
 grub up lumpy and you will see that you are white lumpy 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.680
 you come from this side to pairs 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.750
 then you see the green one and it is you 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:53.170

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.820
 that means white lights i see 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:16.810

 green light the white light small 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:51.140
 motor ship but you also know which side 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:53.780
 he goes that boat he goes it on 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:57.560

 red individual white see the time exactly 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.990
 at the boat 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:30.260
 With Tony Sight invasions only is from 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.469
 top to bottom 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.150
 you look from top to bottom you are standing 

00:03:33.469 --> 00:03:37.400
 with the back to basel you are watching with the 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:40.099
 nose to round on that is the left bank 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.870
 and that is the right bank 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:44.599
 there are now barrels on the right bank 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.099
 runs where ever its form blunt 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:48.439
 the states number and is an even 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:50.120
 number on the left bank 

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:52.010
 are the oil green green tommic 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.919
 a speech of form so that the number on 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:04:00.109
 and is an odd number so sick time 

00:03:54.919 --> 00:04:03.169
 red red red green green green 

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:06.290
 ladies gentlemen if you soak this picture then 

00:04:03.169 --> 00:04:08.810
 can you solve all questions 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:11.449
 you must know last direction towards 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:13.879
 is from top to bottom of a channel 

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:16.639
 are asked the exam but of it 

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:19.940
 channel is a high building but a lower one 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:20.479
 because it is always towards the sea ​​that is the 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.789
 left bank 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:23.930
 that is the right bank on the 

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:25.789
 being on the right bank to tony's is one 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:28.190
 red ones are blunt 

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:30.889
 there is an even number on the left bank 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.990
 they are green its peak is the one 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:33.830
 even number on I recently had a boy 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.330
 on the course 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:38.270
 you have a bridge that is very simple 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.860
 makes no sense at all and you try 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.479
 then he really is my red blunt 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.400
 they form the four corners that are 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:46.340
 widow but he focused on a quadrangle 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:48.800
 in one two three four 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:50.000
 for a moment you'll never forget he tells me 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.720
 the green pointed by slopes be it the 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.770
 triangles 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:57.710
 conscience but only on triangle from 123 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:58.940
 You will never forget odd again 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:01.070
 nice and easy to keep 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:04.159
 the number you start down at rotterdam 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:08.090
 that is one ton two to three tons v 

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:11.900
 now what basaltina 131 is a 10.102 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:14.690
 lunettes better picture 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:17.030
 would be upstream and you look at it 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:19.190
 release is not against wieke 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:20.240
 A camera telling you bubbles your app 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:22.130
 but we are so you joke ego 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:24.380
 but she sails upstream 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:28.280
 and you look left to look well 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:30.190
 to the right bank you know 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:32.020
 ok exam question 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:35.080
 a sail on one of the above virus 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:37.840
 flow up you still go straight 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:39.610
 ahead you see a red blunt barrel 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:41.889
 questions are on which side with you 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:43.900
 could not keep getting into the main weapon 

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:46.419
 stay there we go look 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:49.180
 you go so tired you see a red one 

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:50.979
 blunt barrel if she means his brother 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:51.569
 much clearer in that is the 

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:53.979
 left bank 

00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:55.690
 that's really how we stand there 

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:59.530
 ever oils 

00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:03.759
 so you are going that way 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:05.979
 well tyton ali start thinking 

00:06:03.759 --> 00:06:08.110
 I love this to have 9 tons on starboard 

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:11.020
 no words will side my boat though 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:14.560
 you keep that ton of port around it 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:16.599
 remain one oval layer 

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:18.880
 their often on one of the above the fourth 

00:06:16.599 --> 00:06:21.340
 downstream you're going to think straight 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:23.139
 forward green pointed barrel into the 

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:25.449
 to stay vague should take that tom approach 

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:26.860
 keep board or starboard then it goes 

00:06:25.449 --> 00:06:30.639
 see 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:32.500
 press the direction that is the left bank 

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:34.449
 cabinets do justice if I have them brother 

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:36.820
 to be looked at again they are clearly no 

00:06:34.449 --> 00:06:41.880
 you go that way 

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:41.880
 so journal that ton of port
