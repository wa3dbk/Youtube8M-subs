00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:17.249
 his defeat with a score of 3 1 defeat on 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:19.960
 last minute we got 

00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:22.810
 no points we have after this meeting but 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.909
 no injuries what matters to us in the first 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.560
 time created many moments but not 

00:00:24.909 --> 00:00:28.289
 probably enough some composure 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.880
 to implement them 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.190
 missed a rather strange goal after 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.560
 uncoordinated action by side judges 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.840
 the main arbiter of the match then managed 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:41.140
 win back in the second half already played 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:44.590
 less organized missed 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:48.750
 two counterattacks and lost but moving 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.750
 think further about the next game you 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:54.640
 have learned 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:01:00.469
 the assumption that yourself and the service deck 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:02.899
 bound and pollinated couture lousy 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:05.570
 you know a lot of players have been 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:07.400
 it is important to get a game practice because 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.710
 that all the same today is still thursday on 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.420
 monday of course there is time though they 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.550
 all the strongest played today for example 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.009
 bussufa and zhirkov not played at the same time 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:17.330
 players like 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:20.119
 ahmed dior they turned out from him 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.710
 long playing time after those injuries 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:24.080
 which they missed was important for 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.520
 they rummaged replaced most particular 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.500
 to increase the next very 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.119
 recover fully therefore 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.470
 today we use this match too 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:32.470
 so for functional balance 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.930
 instead of the thunder that can be created 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.640
 decisions how to treat these rich 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.670
 pisa 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.920
 I almost blister. clothing as for 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.540
 remove mourning it really 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.280
 probably I always need them very 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.080
 happy because you need to remember when 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.150
 You already have one yellow card that 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.310
 in such situations you can always get 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.470
 and the second one in this situation it over 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.330
 led I think he should have it what it is 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.070
 and remember this therefore 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.840
 unhappy no need to learn what in 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.520
 such situations do not get how much they cost 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.970
 the fact that we took second place in the group 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:13.540
 then I think it will not affect us 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:15.160
 rather than an advantage to her then for us 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.930
 because in all the teams that 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.360
 fall and from the Champions League strong 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.130
 the teams that took everything and the first two 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.350
 places in the group in the league of Europe too 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.940
 today is the team so I do not consider them 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:28.209
 benefits we will play the first match 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:32.580
 at home or away February still talked 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:34.020
 about what will be the cry replacement 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.030
 use what you had before 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.319
 not at all to save 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.900
 players raftel current replace itself 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:43.079
 and this is the decision during the match 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:47.139
 matured because it did not like 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:48.819
 but there would be and we might be thinking about them 

00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:51.129
 replacing also two other players 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:53.349
 ahmedov and dior although needed a game on 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:55.329
 their first practice but converged only 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:56.739
 there was a match if I already in 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:58.510
 break I will replace someone else except 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:59.829
 Itself would limit my 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.810
 tactical new in the second half 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:03.810
 so leave them but have
