comes the aim is to ensure the
hemorrhoid<00:01:14.830> heals<00:01:15.280> without<00:01:15.640> rupturing<00:01:16.120> again

for<00:01:17.770> some<00:01:18.010> it<00:01:18.190> works<00:01:18.490> well<00:01:18.909> for<00:01:19.180> others<00:01:19.810> not<00:01:20.049> so

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.080 
for some it works well for others not so

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.219 
for some it works well for others not so
but<00:01:20.770> it's<00:01:20.950> worth<00:01:21.220> seeing<00:01:21.549> the<00:01:22.479> third<00:01:22.750> type<00:01:23.080> is

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:23.229 
but it's worth seeing the third type is

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:25.560 
but it's worth seeing the third type is

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:28.150 
some blood pressure in the system this

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.450 
some blood pressure in the system this

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
can have its side effects but overall

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.520 
can have its side effects but overall
it's<00:01:30.670> used<00:01:30.940> to<00:01:31.150> tighten<00:01:31.420> vein<00:01:31.750> tissue<00:01:32.080> so<00:01:32.500> that

it's used to tighten vein tissue so that

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.530 
it's used to tighten vein tissue so that
the<00:01:32.740> hemorrhoid<00:01:33.189> is<00:01:33.400> less<00:01:33.700> susceptible<00:01:34.479> to

the hemorrhoid is less susceptible to
problems<00:01:34.830> it's<00:01:35.830> a<00:01:36.100> very<00:01:36.310> top-down<00:01:36.909> approach

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360
