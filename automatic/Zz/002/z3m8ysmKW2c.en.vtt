00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:04.770
 Hello friends 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.359
 the math course today brings a 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.750
 issue involving multiplication 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.309
 happens more or also multiplication 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.000
 with commas 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.350
 I have here two numbers 3.78 6425 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.240
 multiplied 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.410
 then for multiplication normally 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.570
 I put it on the side it's interesting 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.519
 We put the number that has the most 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.050
 ten more on top and the hot pepper 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.130
 down 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.519
 how do we know the number of 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:32.910
 image dance is the following we tell 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.640
 how many positions how many houses 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.670
 records after the bible or number of 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:42.899
 Up there, I have the village here. 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:45.270
 so I have 1 7815 three tenths in the 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.450
 number did not train more than 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.550
 down the village is here but is on 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.149
 right of the village a couple and I do not have 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:57.090
 doubts if baxter made the following me 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:02.940
 I put it on the side, I'm going to make a 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:04.500
 education here รณ 3,785 multiplies 425 in 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.060
 First of all, let's make a 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.040
 application in the normal way as 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.110
 would have multiplied integers and 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.360
 In the end, I'll say you got the 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:18.689
 Fireworks TRUCO good technique employed 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:21.000
 to parliamentary us about the crazy 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:25.710
 then two will be left over than the one written down in 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:39.869
 top 1840 plus 2 42 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:41.939
 47 3439 3 note here 33 18 as 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:46.200
 there is nothing else we spoke with eight 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:48.329
 and also put on the air an explanation 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.790
 now we both use 15 now we go 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.590
 to 225 since he did not come to fall 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.170
 as well as being in the second position of 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:02:04.590
 work of this second position 11 in 12 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:10.950
 position 25 10 real season 28 16 in 17 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:16.019
 so there is one again in 2014 plus 1 15 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:20.190
 vote 5 here under 8 goes one year and 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:22.879
 twice 36 plus a site made then 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.879
 stay below 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:29.519
 continuing 4 4 2 25 21 in 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.680
 third position with 12 13 and which have 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:36.330
 2 30 until I'm down here 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:40.890
 there are 4 and 5 2010 and there are two left 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:50.130
 not using attack 428 44 times 8 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:52.860
 32 plus 2 34 goes 3 put 4 17 and 28 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:03:02.010
 plus 31 so three left in the then school 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:03:04.680
 three over here four times three 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.390
 of three pounds and amount as with 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:10.680
 15 points and there's nothing left to have 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:14.280
 who stay 15 even then here we 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:16.739
 will now add up to each hour in the 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:22.139
 street that button is adding to the symbol 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:25.049
 has nothing but two plus 10 out of 29 

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:31.350
 seven more normal 70 was not worth 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:43.280
 nothing will be more 89 9 5 14 14 but with the 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:43.280
 18 on the human plus 129 10 56 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:55.620
 he is exactly the play an artifice to 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:59.639
 good technique used in all the 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:02.099
 two numbers 3 and the second number 

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:05.609
 two of those means that in 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:09.510
 together they have 5 of the most 

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:13.260
 right if positions from it 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:15.000
 23 45 and puts life after this 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.310
 fifth position 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.930
 perfect then the staff what we 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:22.800
 we had was that our answer is 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:25.830
 This one from here and continues to 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:28.139
 up to our favorite channel and 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.009
 subscribe to our channel gratefully 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:31.729

 to the next
