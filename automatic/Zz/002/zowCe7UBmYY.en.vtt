00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:10.109
 i 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:16.710
 hello very good i am tejeiro bi we are 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.200
 in a new gta iv video this time it's 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.720
 a snow mode a few days ago I 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.720
 you gave in a comment that if I could 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.790
 teach how to install the previous mod of 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.210
 snow that I went up because they had added 

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:32.700
 more things and it was more difficult to install it 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.920
 now it's not going to be necessary, it's not going to 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.530
 Missing because I found another 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.320
 way that also serves to put them the 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.659
 snow but that is much simpler 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.179
 to install in the game that the previous 

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:47.489
 to upload this we're just going to 

00:00:45.179 --> 00:00:50.489
 have to go to the game folder and 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.800
 we are going to have the snow and also not 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.679
 as in the previous mode with this mode 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.319
 we are going to have snow in everything all everything 

00:00:55.679 --> 00:01:01.109
 the game I'm going to give you to activate it and 

00:00:58.319 --> 00:01:04.080
 there you are seeing it in the whole map of the 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.760
 game everything everything is snowed even 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.920
 as you see the cars are also a 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.080
 little snowfall with the character even 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.640
 also has hair a little white 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.900
 that the one that has been falling snow in the 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.020
 head 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.190
 Well forgive that as I tell you what 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.740
 good that has this mod 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:22.980
 is that we automatically go to a 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.510
 button and we fill everything all the whole map 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:27.990
 as you have been able to see all things 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:29.910
 that the whole map fills us with 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.490
 snow as you are seeing now in 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.920
 screen and the good is that which is not 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.380
 nothing complicated to install it simply 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.090
 you will need the script hop the writing 5 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.790
 and you know what we load the mods with 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.410
 and you'll have how these reindeer go 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.280
 them and you have chosen me a good day 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:50.040
 to take the bike from a day of snow not 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.380
 get along good as you see is beautiful 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.940
 really this as I told you in the 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.800
 another snow video 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.650
 this for people who were like me 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.360
 that at Christmas he will not see the snow 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.460
 for whatever reason or because no 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.280
 you had the game because you could not play 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.200
 in those days for the reason that it was not 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.450
 you could see the snow because thanks to this 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.459
 so you can see the snow and as I say 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.480
 that's not like the previous one is that now 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.120
 is 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.310
 then if we go to the mountains like 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.769
 you see the mountains are also snowy 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:23.069
 that is all all ar is completely 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:24.870
 everything at one hundred percent is to see everything 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:28.080
 that is the map I know that you look where 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.849
 You see everything is snowed which is very 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.099
 very cool as I tell you but you are 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:34.049
 able to see the snow at the time 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:36.450
 so big in this way you can see it 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:38.400
 and enjoy the game with snow and 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.280
 explore a bit by the areas to see 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.170
 how they have changed by having snow like 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.209
 I tell you , it's not difficult to install it and 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.680
 that's how good this mod has 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.720
 I will leave you as always in the 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.879
 description so that you can 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.829
 download if you want and I have nothing left 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:54.989
 more to say because it really is that not 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:57.269
 there is much more is all elevated is super 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:59.459
 Easy to install and nothing I hope you 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:01.560
 have liked this video and the person 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.859
 who put the comment because I hope that 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.480
 I have served you this way to be able 

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:08.129
 to be able to have the snow in all the 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.900
 game I hope you liked the 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:14.420
