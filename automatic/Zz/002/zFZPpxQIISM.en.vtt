00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:08.220
 this story is about the sower it is 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:10.620
 a story that Jesus himself told 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.300
 one day jesus went to the lake 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.000
 to sit 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.940
 many people came to him 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.760
 therefore he went in one leg from there 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.949
 he addressed the people on the shore 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.470
 stood listening 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:30.240
 among other things, he told them 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:33.120
 next story was a farmer and that 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.000
 Zydeco's crazy because it's boring 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.190
 file the seed along the way and the birds 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.989
 it came up one 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:44.010
 many also put some seed on stony 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.629
 ground because there was little earth day it came 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.010
 quickly 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.780
 makes him shine without 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.180
 scorched it 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.489
 it died because it wasn't much deep 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.160
 had roots too 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:59.670
 they came thistles and there 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.480
 it choked the rest of the seed 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:07.290
 Vision good ground and go from rich harvest 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:11.549
 that 30 60 and 100 times as many as there was 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:15.270
 sown in from the smooth of jesus went 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:19.259
 to Jesus and asked what do you mean 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:21.830
 with that story with the example 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.450
 from the farmer who went boring I mean this 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.970
 if you people who do about it 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:30.180
 hear the kingdom of god tell 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:33.000
 don't understand anything in their hearts 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.650
 is sown the is immediately by the table 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.170
 extinguished again 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:40.890
 people like this on the hard ground 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.630
 along the way there are also people who are about it 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.450
 tell the kingdom of god 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.950
 and being very happy about it immediately 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:52.680
 enthusiastic but they are superficial 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:55.560
 if they get in trouble or if they do 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.869
 be bullied because they believe they must 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.060
 suddenly have none of it 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.250
 because the seed had barely 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.990
 shot up 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.409
 these kind of people look like the 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.450
 stony ground then there are people 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.940
 who hear the good news but it 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.020
 suffocated by the worries of it 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.200
 life 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.850
 the craving for money they actually do 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.260
 nothing with the good news they have 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.870
 heard 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.300
 This kind of people seems like the ground that 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.950
 missing or standing 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.190
 Finally, there are people who do the right thing 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.090
 hear the news and understand the good 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.640
 news 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.910
 their heart changed there is going themselves 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.990
 behaving differently with him carries the seed 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:41.310
 fruit 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:43.650
 sometimes 100, about 60 and sometimes 30 times 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.060
 this kind of people seems to be on good ground 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:49.320
 but the seed 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:51.960
 can stand up nicely and bear fruit 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:54.380
 This story can be read by the following 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.380
 fresh
