00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.380 

so<00:00:01.500> you<00:00:01.560> can<00:00:01.740> see<00:00:01.979> this<00:00:02.340> is<00:00:03.710> the<00:00:04.710> huts<00:00:04.950> all

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:05.390 
so you can see this is the huts all

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:07.550 
so you can see this is the huts all
covered<00:00:06.390> with<00:00:06.450> wood<00:00:06.690> ashes<00:00:06.870> and<00:00:07.200> then<00:00:07.290> this<00:00:07.410> is

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
covered with wood ashes and then this is

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.500 
covered with wood ashes and then this is
the<00:00:07.620> part<00:00:07.799> I<00:00:07.919> started<00:00:08.340> stripping<00:00:08.519> there<00:00:09.450> are

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
the part I started stripping there are

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.330 
the part I started stripping there are
lots<00:00:09.780> of<00:00:09.900> layers<00:00:10.050> on<00:00:10.290> paint<00:00:10.530> of<00:00:10.800> paint<00:00:11.070> on<00:00:11.219> this

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
lots of layers on paint of paint on this

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:11.600 
lots of layers on paint of paint on this
thing

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
thing

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.670 
thing
I<00:00:11.870> don't<00:00:12.870> know<00:00:13.110> if<00:00:15.289> there's<00:00:16.289> just<00:00:16.470> too<00:00:16.590> many

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
I don't know if there's just too many

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.439 
I don't know if there's just too many
for<00:00:16.949> it<00:00:17.010> to<00:00:17.100> penetrate<00:00:17.520> all<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:17.670> way<00:00:17.789> but<00:00:18.300> not

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
for it to penetrate all the way but not

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.240 
for it to penetrate all the way but not
all<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.990> layers<00:00:19.199> are<00:00:19.350> coming<00:00:19.650> off<00:00:19.770> easily

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
all the layers are coming off easily

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.029 
all the layers are coming off easily
probably<00:00:21.180> like<00:00:21.510> three<00:00:21.990> layers<00:00:22.199> of<00:00:22.560> paint<00:00:22.740> came

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
probably like three layers of paint came

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.160 
probably like three layers of paint came
off<00:00:23.250> this<00:00:23.970> section<00:00:24.510> and<00:00:24.689> these<00:00:24.779> are<00:00:24.960> just<00:00:25.050> the

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
off this section and these are just the

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.859 
off this section and these are just the
bottom<00:00:25.560> two<00:00:25.800> layers<00:00:26.039> um<00:00:26.849> you<00:00:27.330> can<00:00:27.449> see<00:00:27.599> there's

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
bottom two layers um you can see there's

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.689 
bottom two layers um you can see there's
some<00:00:28.019> Reds<00:00:28.260> in<00:00:28.500> there<00:00:28.680> and<00:00:29.070> there's<00:00:29.220> a<00:00:29.310> higher

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
some Reds in there and there's a higher

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.720 
some Reds in there and there's a higher
and<00:00:30.029> stuff<00:00:30.470> the<00:00:31.470> side<00:00:31.710> stripped<00:00:32.070> easier<00:00:32.460> so<00:00:32.640> it

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
and stuff the side stripped easier so it

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.069 
and stuff the side stripped easier so it
must<00:00:32.880> depend<00:00:33.120> on<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.390> paint<00:00:33.630> and<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.809> number

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
must depend on the paint and the number

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.840 
must depend on the paint and the number
of<00:00:34.170> layers<00:00:34.320> and<00:00:34.620> stuff<00:00:34.829> but<00:00:35.610> this<00:00:35.969> is<00:00:36.210> then<00:00:37.850> how

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
of layers and stuff but this is then how

00:00:38.850 --> 00:01:19.399 
of layers and stuff but this is then how
it's<00:01:17.509> so<00:01:18.509> I<00:01:18.540> guess<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.900> moral<00:01:19.080> of<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.380> story

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
it's so I guess the moral of the story

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.850 
it's so I guess the moral of the story
is<00:01:20.180> the<00:01:21.180> amount<00:01:21.420> of<00:01:21.509> water<00:01:21.689> you<00:01:21.869> put<00:01:22.080> on<00:01:22.229> and

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
is the amount of water you put on and

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.140 
is the amount of water you put on and
thickness<00:01:23.310> of<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.520> ashes<00:01:23.670> makes<00:01:24.030> a

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
thickness of the ashes makes a

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.840 
thickness of the ashes makes a
difference<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.960> high<00:01:25.110> spots<00:01:25.530> I<00:01:25.920> didn't

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
difference to the high spots I didn't

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.910 
difference to the high spots I didn't
put<00:01:27.000> his<00:01:27.090> money<00:01:27.299> ashes<00:01:27.840> like<00:01:28.290> this<00:01:28.530> drawers

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
put his money ashes like this drawers

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.890 
put his money ashes like this drawers
higher<00:01:29.250> a<00:01:29.549> little<00:01:29.729> over<00:01:30.000> here<00:01:30.240> that<00:01:30.570> was<00:01:30.659> hard

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
higher a little over here that was hard

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.260 
higher a little over here that was hard
there<00:01:31.079> stripped<00:01:34.130> and<00:01:35.130> then<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.759> spots<00:01:36.030> but<00:01:36.150> I

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
there stripped and then the spots but I

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.969 
there stripped and then the spots but I
didn't<00:01:36.509> spray<00:01:36.750> it<00:01:36.810> enough<00:01:37.079> like<00:01:37.530> down<00:01:37.710> there

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
didn't spray it enough like down there

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:43.780 
didn't spray it enough like down there
the<00:01:38.159> ashes<00:01:38.549> were<00:01:38.670> a<00:01:38.700> little<00:01:38.939> dry<00:01:39.270> some<00:01:42.649> free

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 
the ashes were a little dry some free

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.010 
the ashes were a little dry some free
free<00:01:44.790> wood<00:01:45.030> stripping<00:01:45.450> stuff<00:01:45.689> I've<00:01:45.869> also

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
free wood stripping stuff I've also

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.080 
free wood stripping stuff I've also
heard<00:01:46.259> people<00:01:46.320> using<00:01:46.799> drain<00:01:47.159> cleaner<00:01:47.490> and

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.880 

then<00:01:51.090> I've<00:01:51.750> read<00:01:51.990> on<00:01:52.110> some<00:01:52.320> of<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.470> commercial

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
then I've read on some of the commercial

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.170 
then I've read on some of the commercial
ones<00:01:53.070> where<00:01:53.280> you're<00:01:53.340> supposed<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.670> neutralize

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
ones where you're supposed to neutralize

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.450 
ones where you're supposed to neutralize
it<00:01:54.360> with<00:01:54.390> an<00:01:54.630> acid<00:01:55.020> like<00:01:55.200> vinegar<00:01:55.229> and<00:01:56.130> so<00:01:56.340> I'm

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
it with an acid like vinegar and so I'm

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.459 
it with an acid like vinegar and so I'm
going<00:01:56.610> to<00:01:56.670> probably<00:01:57.000> do<00:01:57.390> that<00:01:57.570> just<00:01:57.869> put<00:01:58.049> some

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
going to probably do that just put some

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.219 
going to probably do that just put some
vinegar<00:01:58.619> and<00:01:59.070> maybe<00:01:59.460> a<00:01:59.549> water<00:01:59.759> solution<00:02:00.689> in<00:02:01.200> a

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
vinegar and maybe a water solution in a

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:08.029 
vinegar and maybe a water solution in a
spray<00:02:01.770> bottle<00:02:01.799> just<00:02:02.640> to<00:02:02.729> be<00:02:02.850> safe<00:02:03.920> so<00:02:06.920> for<00:02:07.920> you

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
spray bottle just to be safe so for you

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.610 
spray bottle just to be safe so for you
would<00:02:08.190> stripper
