it's<00:00:14.370> something<00:00:14.790> i<00:00:14.940> came<00:00:15.000> up<00:00:15.210> with<00:00:15.360> when<00:00:15.719> i<00:00:15.750> was

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
it's something i came up with when i was

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.720 
it's something i came up with when i was
doing<00:00:16.230> my<00:00:16.260> research<00:00:16.560> into<00:00:17.190> sight-reading

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
doing my research into sight-reading

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.359 
doing my research into sight-reading
when<00:00:18.390> i<00:00:18.420> was<00:00:18.630> a<00:00:18.660> student<00:00:18.779> i<00:00:19.289> was<00:00:19.650> looking<00:00:20.160> for

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
when i was a student i was looking for

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.460 
when i was a student i was looking for
ways<00:00:20.520> to<00:00:20.850> understand<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.630> fingerboard<00:00:21.960> or<00:00:22.380> at

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
ways to understand the fingerboard or at

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.950 
ways to understand the fingerboard or at
least<00:00:22.619> mnemonic<00:00:23.039> devices<00:00:23.369> first<00:00:24.119> to<00:00:24.570> help<00:00:24.750> us

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
least mnemonic devices first to help us

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.779 
least mnemonic devices first to help us
understand<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.590> fingerboard<00:00:25.890> because<00:00:26.609> it's

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
understand the fingerboard because it's

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.580 
understand the fingerboard because it's
such<00:00:26.910> a<00:00:26.939> maze<00:00:27.330> and<00:00:27.750> it's<00:00:27.869> such<00:00:28.019> a<00:00:28.050> mystery<00:00:28.470> to

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
such a maze and it's such a mystery to

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.620 
such a maze and it's such a mystery to
so<00:00:28.710> many<00:00:28.890> of<00:00:29.099> us<00:00:29.189> so<00:00:30.000> i<00:00:30.029> came<00:00:30.119> up<00:00:30.390> with<00:00:30.539> this

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
so many of us so i came up with this

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.540 
so many of us so i came up with this
idea<00:00:30.990> of<00:00:31.320> playing<00:00:31.500> scales<00:00:31.859> it<00:00:32.130> was<00:00:32.250> really

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
idea of playing scales it was really

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.250 
idea of playing scales it was really
helpful<00:00:32.790> and<00:00:33.120> it's<00:00:33.239> really<00:00:33.540> quite<00:00:33.780> an<00:00:33.989> eye

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
helpful and it's really quite an eye

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.130 
helpful and it's really quite an eye
opener<00:00:34.649> as<00:00:34.770> well<00:00:35.300> the<00:00:36.300> idea<00:00:36.540> is<00:00:36.660> very<00:00:36.960> very

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
opener as well the idea is very very

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:37.549 
opener as well the idea is very very
simple

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
simple

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.440 
simple
we<00:00:38.010> take<00:00:38.190> a<00:00:38.219> scale<00:00:38.489> any<00:00:38.790> scale<00:00:39.090> could<00:00:39.300> be<00:00:39.420> a

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
we take a scale any scale could be a

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.450 
we take a scale any scale could be a
mode<00:00:39.750> even<00:00:40.020> could<00:00:40.350> be<00:00:40.440> chromatic<00:00:40.920> it<00:00:41.100> could<00:00:41.250> be

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
mode even could be chromatic it could be

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.880 
mode even could be chromatic it could be
major<00:00:42.239> Maya<00:00:42.570> doesn't<00:00:42.899> matter<00:00:43.110> just<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.620> scale

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
major Maya doesn't matter just a scale

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.000 
major Maya doesn't matter just a scale
let's<00:00:44.579> say<00:00:44.789> G<00:00:45.090> major<00:00:45.329> and<00:00:45.629> instead<00:00:46.559> of<00:00:46.829> just

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
let's say G major and instead of just

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.940 
let's say G major and instead of just
playing<00:00:47.250> one<00:00:47.520> note<00:00:47.700> per<00:00:47.760> time<00:00:48.180> as<00:00:48.390> we<00:00:48.570> are<00:00:49.079> used

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
playing one note per time as we are used

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.590 
playing one note per time as we are used
to<00:00:52.610> over<00:00:53.610> different<00:00:53.879> strings<00:00:54.149> crossing

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
to over different strings crossing

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.750 
to over different strings crossing
though<00:00:54.660> different<00:00:54.840> strings<00:00:55.199> take<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.399> first

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
though different strings take the first

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.770 
though different strings take the first
note<00:00:58.789> played<00:00:59.789> on<00:00:59.940> that<00:01:00.090> string<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.539> sixth

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
note played on that string the sixth

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.680 
note played on that string the sixth
string<00:01:00.930> then<00:01:01.469> play<00:01:01.500> that<00:01:01.949> same<00:01:02.219> note<00:01:02.539> on<00:01:03.539> the

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
string then play that same note on the

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.219 
string then play that same note on the
fifth<00:01:03.899> string<00:01:07.100> and<00:01:08.100> then<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.700> first<00:01:08.939> string

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 
fifth string and then the first string

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.830 
fifth string and then the first string
easy<00:01:10.229> enough<00:01:10.560> then<00:01:11.460> take<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.210> second<00:01:12.540> note<00:01:12.659> a

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
easy enough then take the second note a

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:21.170 
easy enough then take the second note a
and<00:01:17.119> B<00:01:18.119> and<00:01:18.479> C<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:19.170> so<00:01:19.619> on<00:01:20.009> so<00:01:20.850> what<00:01:21.030> this

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
and B and C and so on so what this

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.980 
and B and C and so on so what this
forces<00:01:21.720> you<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:21.990> do<00:01:22.229> is<00:01:23.119> it<00:01:24.119> forces<00:01:24.540> you<00:01:24.960> to

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
forces you to do is it forces you to

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.990 
forces you to do is it forces you to
think<00:01:25.710> about<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.130> notes<00:01:26.310> you're<00:01:26.460> playing<00:01:26.520> you

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
think about the notes you're playing you

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.510 
think about the notes you're playing you
don't<00:01:27.210> get<00:01:27.450> away<00:01:27.570> with<00:01:27.869> being<00:01:28.170> lazy<00:01:29.070> and

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
don't get away with being lazy and

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.490 
don't get away with being lazy and
playing<00:01:29.759> shapes<00:01:30.210> because<00:01:30.840> on<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.020> guitar<00:01:31.290> one

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
playing shapes because on the guitar one

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.020 
playing shapes because on the guitar one
of<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.650> beautiful<00:01:31.920> things<00:01:32.220> that<00:01:32.400> we<00:01:32.579> get<00:01:32.759> is

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
of the beautiful things that we get is

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:39.140 
of the beautiful things that we get is
shapes<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:33.840> patterns<00:01:34.049> like<00:01:34.590> this<00:01:38.000> take<00:01:39.000> that

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
shapes and patterns like this take that

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.940 
shapes and patterns like this take that
major<00:01:39.420> scale<00:01:39.780> shape

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.139 

so<00:01:43.100> many<00:01:43.310> of<00:01:43.399> it<00:01:43.520> as<00:01:43.700> it<00:01:43.850> used<00:01:44.030> to<00:01:45.729> just<00:01:46.729> put<00:01:47.060> it

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:47.149 
so many of it as it used to just put it

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:49.749 
so many of it as it used to just put it
up<00:01:47.240> a<00:01:47.329> friend<00:01:47.890> will<00:01:48.890> get<00:01:49.039> a<00:01:49.070> whole<00:01:49.250> new<00:01:49.430> set<00:01:49.729> of

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 
up a friend will get a whole new set of

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:51.999 
up a friend will get a whole new set of
notes<00:01:50.390> to<00:01:50.570> make<00:01:50.689> a<00:01:50.750> different<00:01:51.049> scale<00:01:51.289> which<00:01:51.890> is

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
notes to make a different scale which is

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:53.440 
notes to make a different scale which is
wonderful<00:01:52.310> but<00:01:52.700> we<00:01:52.820> don't<00:01:52.969> have<00:01:53.119> to<00:01:53.210> think

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
wonderful but we don't have to think

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.539 
wonderful but we don't have to think
about<00:01:53.780> it<00:01:53.899> the<00:01:54.229> same<00:01:54.259> goes<00:01:54.619> for<00:01:54.649> chords<00:01:55.369> let's

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:55.549 
about it the same goes for chords let's

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:58.209 
about it the same goes for chords let's
say<00:01:55.700> we've<00:01:55.850> got<00:01:55.969> this<00:01:56.060> nice<00:01:56.289> C<00:01:57.289> major<00:01:57.530> seven

00:01:58.209 --> 00:01:58.219 
say we've got this nice C major seven

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:04.450 
say we've got this nice C major seven
chord<00:01:58.250> we<00:01:58.909> take<00:01:59.119> that<00:01:59.270> shape<00:02:02.350> and<00:02:03.350> we<00:02:03.470> get<00:02:03.649> job

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
chord we take that shape and we get job

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.209 
chord we take that shape and we get job
D<00:02:05.090> d<00:02:05.990> sharp<00:02:06.020> major<00:02:06.590> 7

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:07.219 
D d sharp major 7

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:09.070 
D d sharp major 7
without<00:02:07.700> even<00:02:07.880> thinking<00:02:08.000> of<00:02:08.330> what<00:02:08.539> notes<00:02:08.869> go

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
without even thinking of what notes go

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
clever ones out there will just start to

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
think in patterns again rather than

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.759

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
simple well give it a try first and see

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.020 
simple well give it a try first and see
how<00:03:17.630> well<00:03:17.810> you<00:03:17.840> go<00:03:18.280> put<00:03:19.280> on<00:03:19.400> a<00:03:19.430> metronome<00:03:19.790> and

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
how well you go put on a metronome and

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:21.640 
how well you go put on a metronome and
see<00:03:20.150> if<00:03:20.239> you<00:03:20.329> can<00:03:20.450> keep<00:03:20.569> up<00:03:20.720> but<00:03:21.170> if<00:03:21.350> you<00:03:21.470> want

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
see if you can keep up but if you want

that for instance four notes per note of
the<00:03:41.800> scale<00:03:41.890> you<00:03:42.280> could<00:03:43.090> do<00:03:43.180> triplets<00:03:43.570> that<00:03:43.660> way

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
the scale you could do triplets that way

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:51.120 
the scale you could do triplets that way
you're<00:03:44.110> exercising<00:03:44.410> string<00:03:45.040> crossing<00:03:45.430> I<00:03:49.890> am<00:03:50.890> I

am I am etc you could challenge your
brain<00:03:54.910> you<00:03:55.390> can<00:03:55.540> add<00:03:55.750> a<00:03:55.990> third<00:03:56.040> interval<00:03:57.040> the

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130 
brain you can add a third interval the

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:05.370 
brain you can add a third interval the
third<00:03:57.400> is<00:03:57.640> note<00:04:04.080> or<00:04:05.080> if<00:04:05.170> you'd<00:04:05.290> even

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380 
third is note or if you'd even

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.590 
third is note or if you'd even
harmonized<00:04:06.040> an<00:04:06.310> entire<00:04:06.640> chord<00:04:07.090> out<00:04:07.360> of<00:04:07.390> these

harmonized an entire chord out of these

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.500 
harmonized an entire chord out of these
notes<00:04:07.900> so<00:04:08.740> you<00:04:08.830> can<00:04:09.040> see<00:04:09.250> that<00:04:09.490> you<00:04:10.090> could<00:04:10.330> be

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
notes so you can see that you could be

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.090 
notes so you can see that you could be
quite<00:04:10.780> creative<00:04:11.140> with<00:04:11.470> what<00:04:11.650> you<00:04:11.740> do<00:04:11.920> with
