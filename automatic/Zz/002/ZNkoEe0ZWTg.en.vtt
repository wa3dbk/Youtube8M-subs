saying that basically you know if you
run<00:02:06.149> in<00:02:06.240> your<00:02:06.360> quad<00:02:06.570> like<00:02:06.960> this<00:02:07.140> you<00:02:07.290> it's

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
run in your quad like this you it's

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.330 
run in your quad like this you it's
running<00:02:07.829> dangerously<00:02:07.979> lean<00:02:09.500> and<00:02:10.500> as<00:02:11.039> soon<00:02:11.250> as

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
running dangerously lean and as soon as

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.270 
running dangerously lean and as soon as
you<00:02:11.459> plug<00:02:11.670> in<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:12.800> Yoshimura<00:02:13.800> cherry<00:02:14.010> bomb

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
you plug in the Yoshimura cherry bomb

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.340 
you plug in the Yoshimura cherry bomb
everything<00:02:14.910> starts<00:02:15.300> working<00:02:15.600> itself<00:02:15.840> out<00:02:16.080> and

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
everything starts working itself out and

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.010 
everything starts working itself out and
the<00:02:16.440> quad<00:02:16.680> just<00:02:17.040> basically<00:02:17.640> comes<00:02:17.850> alive<00:02:18.120> so

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
the quad just basically comes alive so

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.870 
the quad just basically comes alive so
here<00:02:19.260> here<00:02:19.560> it<00:02:19.620> is<00:02:19.710> again<00:02:19.920> you<00:02:19.980> guys<00:02:20.190> showing

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
gonna show you the the power gains so

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.310 
gonna show you the the power gains so
right<00:03:17.820> away<00:03:17.940> as<00:03:18.269> you<00:03:18.300> guys<00:03:18.540> can<00:03:18.750> see<00:03:18.810> just<00:03:19.260> from
