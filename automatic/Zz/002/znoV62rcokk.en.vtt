00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
see once you take the lid off it

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.540 
see once you take the lid off it
actually<00:00:51.390> holds<00:00:51.750> some<00:00:52.680> mini<00:00:52.860> pencils<00:00:53.399> in

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
actually holds some mini pencils in

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.310 
actually holds some mini pencils in
there<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:53.969> these<00:00:54.300> are<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.510> sort<00:00:54.750> of<00:00:54.780> pencils

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
there and these are the sort of pencils

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.600 
there and these are the sort of pencils
I<00:00:55.379> guess<00:00:55.559> that<00:00:55.739> children<00:00:56.039> also<00:00:56.190> trying<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.520> get

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
I guess that children also trying to get

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:57.950 
I guess that children also trying to get
at<00:00:56.699> restaurants<00:00:57.180> if<00:00:57.270> their<00:00:57.420> parents<00:00:57.809> are

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
at restaurants if their parents are

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.939 
at restaurants if their parents are
waiting<00:00:59.629> eating<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:00.899> wining<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:01.530> dining<00:01:01.620> and

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
waiting eating and wining and dining and

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.319 
waiting eating and wining and dining and
the<00:01:02.010> children<00:01:02.309> waiting<00:01:02.789> for<00:01:02.820> something<00:01:03.059> to<00:01:03.149> do

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
the children waiting for something to do

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.030 
the children waiting for something to do
it<00:01:03.420> fits<00:01:03.629> in<00:01:03.780> those<00:01:03.960> kind<00:01:04.290> of<00:01:04.409> little<00:01:04.650> little

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
it fits in those kind of little little

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.219 
it fits in those kind of little little
pencils<00:01:05.640> so<00:01:05.880> if<00:01:06.210> it's<00:01:06.479> quite<00:01:06.720> a<00:01:06.750> few<00:01:07.020> in<00:01:07.140> the

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
pencils so if it's quite a few in the

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.810 
pencils so if it's quite a few in the
little<00:01:07.470> box<00:01:07.790> but<00:01:08.790> you<00:01:08.909> also<00:01:09.119> can<00:01:09.990> fit<00:01:10.380> in<00:01:10.500> those

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
little box but you also can fit in those

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.270 
little box but you also can fit in those
small<00:01:11.820> by<00:01:12.420> rows<00:01:12.720> that<00:01:13.020> you<00:01:13.170> can<00:01:13.380> get<00:01:13.650> these

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
small by rows that you can get these

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.249

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
ones are scented I think but about five

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.960 
ones are scented I think but about five
of<00:01:16.290> those<00:01:16.590> little<00:01:16.860> mini<00:01:17.040> barrows<00:01:17.490> will<00:01:17.759> easily

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
of those little mini barrows will easily

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.870 
of those little mini barrows will easily
fit<00:01:18.390> in<00:01:18.540> there<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:19.189> you<00:01:20.189> can<00:01:20.369> put<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.729> lid

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
fit in there and you can put the lid

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.240 
fit in there and you can put the lid
back<00:01:20.909> on<00:01:21.210> like<00:01:21.360> that<00:01:21.630> um<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.619> would<00:01:23.070> make<00:01:23.189> a

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
back on like that um and would make a

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.340 
back on like that um and would make a
great<00:01:23.490> back-to-school<00:01:24.060> gift<00:01:24.479> for<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:24.840> teacher
