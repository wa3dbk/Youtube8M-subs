but uh yeah there you go
the<00:00:50.239> top<00:00:50.780> screws<00:00:51.050> were<00:00:51.170> actually<00:00:51.470> removed

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:52.660 
the top screws were actually removed

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.850 
the top screws were actually removed
because<00:00:53.660> there's<00:00:54.020> no<00:00:54.320> need<00:00:54.500> for<00:00:54.530> them<00:00:54.770> because

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 
because there's no need for them because

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.260 
because there's no need for them because
we're<00:00:55.070> the<00:00:55.160> two<00:00:55.309> by<00:00:55.430> fours<00:00:55.670> rat<00:00:55.910> right<00:00:56.090> now<00:00:56.239> I

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:56.270 
we're the two by fours rat right now I

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:57.340 
we're the two by fours rat right now I
think<00:00:56.420> I<00:00:56.660> may<00:00:56.780> just<00:00:56.809> put<00:00:57.080> some<00:00:57.260> like

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
think I may just put some like

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.440 
think I may just put some like
heavy-duty<00:00:57.680> screws<00:00:58.100> in<00:00:58.250> there<00:00:58.370> but<00:00:58.970> uh<00:00:59.000> right

00:00:59.440 --> 00:00:59.450 
heavy-duty screws in there but uh right

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.990 
heavy-duty screws in there but uh right
now<00:00:59.800> there's<00:01:00.800> no<00:01:00.980> point<00:01:01.220> it's<00:01:01.520> pretty<00:01:01.730> secure

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
now there's no point it's pretty secure

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:10.490 
now there's no point it's pretty secure
so<00:01:02.540> you<00:01:02.810> know<00:01:03.290> we<00:01:03.410> show<00:01:03.560> you<00:01:03.650> the<00:01:03.740> back

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.030 

we're<00:01:10.980> moving<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:11.580> we're<00:01:11.700> moving<00:01:12.620> and<00:01:13.620> here

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
we're moving and we're moving and here

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.300 
we're moving and we're moving and here
we<00:01:14.160> go<00:01:14.310> I<00:01:15.440> think<00:01:16.440> this<00:01:16.770> looks<00:01:16.980> a<00:01:17.040> little<00:01:17.100> bit

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
we go I think this looks a little bit

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.870 
we go I think this looks a little bit
better<00:01:17.460> now<00:01:17.760> I<00:01:18.950> want<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.010> move<00:01:20.130> these<00:01:20.370> amps

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
better now I want to move these amps

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.520 
better now I want to move these amps
actually<00:01:21.450> I<00:01:21.480> want<00:01:21.630> to<00:01:21.690> replace<00:01:21.930> these<00:01:22.110> hoops

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
actually I want to replace these hoops

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.740 
actually I want to replace these hoops
but<00:01:23.310> I<00:01:23.340> want<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:23.850> move<00:01:23.940> everything<00:01:24.210> up<00:01:24.420> front

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
but I want to move everything up front

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.650 
but I want to move everything up front
so<00:01:25.530> they'll<00:01:26.490> basically<00:01:26.640> be<00:01:26.970> hovering<00:01:27.210> over

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:27.660 
so they'll basically be hovering over

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.980 
so they'll basically be hovering over
the<00:01:27.750> top<00:01:27.930> of<00:01:28.050> the<00:01:28.140> 15th<00:01:28.500> in<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.770> front<00:01:29.070> but<00:01:29.310> I
