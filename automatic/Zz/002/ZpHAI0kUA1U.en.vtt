00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:14.009
 after the investigation it appeared that the 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.320
 differentiated after a general or one 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.940
 joint instruction 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.920
 that it is just very essential at 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.449
 the maths education you start with each other 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.980
 and your kids trying to run out is half 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.060
 possible level 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:29.160
 continue to be met in the method and 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:31.140
 then you have the support of the 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.239
 a good calculators to the lesser 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.210
 do n't count it you see very clearly 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.129
 walk with the other children 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.770
 and then you separate the groups 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.230
 the 2 and 3 star kimbra 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.660
 they may continue independently and the 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.280
 a star children who come to the 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.559
 teacher then sit the instruction table 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.600
 So I find it very pleasant the whole 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.090
 align with the differentiation 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.160
 two the ones that use one in blue 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.070
 book that is textbook in you turn it over 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.940
 you get the red part tasks and if 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.859
 additional 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.300
 it offers to the workbook at the 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.830
 are already orange book and the can the 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.299
 children at the instruction table with you 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.580
 sit down 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.670
 we have broadening and for floor 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.970
 the green book plus workbook and leave 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.950
 stand next to solid assignments in the 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.320
 children really like it there 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.540
 extended instruction is given what 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.060
 they very much enjoy materials work themselves then 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.100
 at instruction table and they do have it 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.299
 feeling of hey i understood and 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.310
 I can now do it myself 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.900
 and find the fun of that weekly task 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.700
 myself that is the children very well 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.869
 self can go on there 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.630
 to work 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.220
 and with little instruction sensitive or 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.479
 need little instruction from the 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.030
 teacher 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.140
 so it's actually a success experience 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.600
 for the children 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.580
 I had a boy in class 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.140
 last year in that 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.909
 crop was in the instruction group with me 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.440
 on a star level 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.450
 it and did it program off and oh 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.340
 program on the computer and it jumped 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.440
 suddenly behind the computer I frills 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.390
 got it off at two star level and that 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.570
 was so proud of himself and you could and 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.430
 give compliments about it 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.670
 so that is a whole for the child itself 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.590
 very positive experience what the feels 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.270
 quite challenging if it's not that good 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.650
 did that the cracks is a 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.110
 red 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.750
 the percentage and liquid peace whole 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.100
 to motivate groups it is necessary 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.110
 not to be but it can be that orange 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.780
 words and an orange you can find one 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.850
 turn green and 80 percent can 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.370
 100% are going to see if that is yet 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.959
 succeeds when your time is up 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.269
 I would definitely use this method the other 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:37.310
 recommend schools because daily 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:37.310
 instruction is very important for child
