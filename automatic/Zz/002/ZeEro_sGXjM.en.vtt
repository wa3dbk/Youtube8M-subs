00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 and almost welcome to the channel this 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:06.240
 again with you and in this video 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:09.150
 I'm going to show you a pretty 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.639
 simple to organize our 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.980
 labials in our cabinet what 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:17.880
 we are going to use for this project that 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:20.430
 it's super simple are these spacers 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.070
 I got myself in the kia if I did not 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.580
 I'm wrong like three or four dollars 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:29.460
 6 come in each packet there are also 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.489
 who has this other one but how do you see this 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:36.180
 wider this one already serves for the drawers 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:40.530
 wider than the cabinets and 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:43.079
 healthy and quite logical hepatic 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.329
 This is weaker than the one that shows you 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.870
 that these are wider and more 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:51.329
 small is a little weaker this 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.370
 I have nothing else how many separate in 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.770
 our head does not necessarily have 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.930
 to be for our makeup but 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.690
 for our clothes for which we 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.640
 we want in our follow up is super 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.070
 simple girls what I do is 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.390
 do it separately and then as I already have 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.450
 measure 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:14.940
 the parts that I'm putting in my 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:18.420
 Cabinet, let's do all 4 6 8 10 11 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:21.390
 and see how simple this is to cut yourself 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.670
 it's cut like that easy and let's go 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.160
 keeping these parts because also the 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.830
 we are going to use we are not going to throw them 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:32.940
 nothing but we're going to have then 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:38.140
 this would happen to be 1 let's see 2 4 6 8 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:43.479
 10 11 we also try 2 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:46.000
 2 4 6 8 10 11 we cut it back too 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:48.729
 we already have here no stress for the 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.830
 wide are obviously more but nothing more 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:52.900
 the sample that I am doing that 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:55.450
 this side use for along the 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.280
 drawer and nothing else is used 14 girls 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.680
 because if we leave it to the bottom 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.869
 of the drawer then we will not be able to 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.300
 take out the products so I am 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:08.909
 doing that way I'm just going to 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.909
 use 14 squares of these 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:20.830
 he took off 3 then then let's move on 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:24.310
 on the side of which they have two spaces one 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:26.830
 smaller here and another higher then 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:31.540
 from high to high is where we are going to go 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:34.950
 putting our our separators 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:39.840
 in this way, and so on 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.840
 let's go do all the rest 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.360
 can put these too 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:55.250
 so doing the way that easier 

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:55.250
 they are made 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:06.550
 for example the parts that we have cut 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:10.150
 does not have six spaces we're going to 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:12.760
 give back to see what we have done and 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:15.850
 we 're going to put it like that and then we're going 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.740
 to go putting the other long and not 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:20.710
 they will move for nothing will be very 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:24.370
 well we can also do separator 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:26.650
 flushes and it's super easy too like 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:30.160
 this would already be the final result 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:33.220
 it would be this way girls very easy 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.140
 here I made a little mistake but this 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:38.140
 I'm not going to use it in my cabinet 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:40.060
 because I treat it and problem if I put this 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:43.120
 other lip lines or blush is what 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.010
 I'm going to put it is not going to make it easy to 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.290
 get it out of the drawer so that's why 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.930
 I decided to leave it like that right now I cut him 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:53.680
 this so that it is not even and it is 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:56.470
 so you see that it is a kind of truth that 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:59.590
 I 'm super excited about this and 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:01.630
 each space of three and in this area of 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.180
 here I will put rumors and right now 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.270
 shows in the video how is it going 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.480
 staying 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:12.910
 see how they will be artistic super good

 drawer nothing more for lipsticks and other 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:36.250
 drawer nothing more for the rumors that what 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:38.770
 that I 'm going to do later because 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:41.530
 I do not have any more separators, that's why it was 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:44.680
 that I left this to this part so then 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:47.170
 but observe, it looks really good 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:50.650
