00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
to maintain the vehicles it's a pretty

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.590

serious event there are injuries and

finishing rate is somewhere around 40%
of<00:01:43.619> starting<00:01:43.979> so<00:01:44.460> 60%<00:01:45.090> of<00:01:45.149> people<00:01:45.210> don't

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
of starting so 60% of people don't

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.539 
of starting so 60% of people don't
finished<00:01:45.960> I'm<00:01:46.470> guessing<00:01:46.829> a<00:01:47.070> ton<00:01:47.369> for<00:01:47.460> you

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
finished I'm guessing a ton for you

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.130 
finished I'm guessing a ton for you
telling<00:01:47.880> you<00:01:48.030> odds<00:01:48.299> like<00:01:48.630> that<00:01:48.659> probably

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
telling you odds like that probably

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.219 
telling you odds like that probably
makes<00:01:49.350> little<00:01:49.530> difference<00:01:49.710> to<00:01:50.070> your<00:01:51.020> I'm<00:01:52.020> used

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
makes little difference to your I'm used

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.050 
makes little difference to your I'm used
to<00:01:52.320> succeed<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:52.890> in<00:01:53.040> things<00:01:53.250> like<00:01:53.369> save<00:01:53.790> that

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
to succeed and in things like save that

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.899 
to succeed and in things like save that
I<00:01:54.380> I've<00:01:55.380> got<00:01:55.560> a<00:01:55.590> feeling<00:01:55.979> my<00:01:56.009> car<00:01:56.520> with<00:01:56.640> us<00:01:56.700> I

to do which is completely not

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.690 
to do which is completely not
necessarily<00:02:01.229> wouldn't<00:02:01.439> it<00:02:01.619> but<00:02:01.860> it's<00:02:02.579> all

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
necessarily wouldn't it but it's all

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.520 
necessarily wouldn't it but it's all
about<00:02:02.850> finishing<00:02:03.090> it<00:02:03.390> with<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.899> duct<00:02:04.110> also

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
about finishing it with the duct also

going to be thrown up by competing

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.940 
going to be thrown up by competing
firstly<00:02:12.900> is<00:02:13.020> it<00:02:13.230> like<00:02:13.379> it's

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
firstly is it like it's

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.410 
firstly is it like it's
literally<00:02:14.400> getting<00:02:14.520> in<00:02:14.640> another<00:02:14.879> vehicle<00:02:15.180> I

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
literally getting in another vehicle I

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.320 
literally getting in another vehicle I
do<00:02:15.480> I've<00:02:16.470> found<00:02:16.830> I've<00:02:17.220> adapted<00:02:17.520> a<00:02:17.849> way<00:02:17.970> to<00:02:18.030> get

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
do I've found I've adapted a way to get

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.869 
do I've found I've adapted a way to get
in<00:02:18.420> another<00:02:18.599> vehicle<00:02:18.900> so<00:02:19.470> there<00:02:20.340> was<00:02:20.459> that<00:02:20.489> and

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:20.879 
in another vehicle so there was that and

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:23.690 
in another vehicle so there was that and
then<00:02:21.000> it's<00:02:21.560> being<00:02:22.560> in<00:02:22.739> that<00:02:22.860> vehicle<00:02:23.040> it's<00:02:23.400> hot

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
then it's being in that vehicle it's hot

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.350 
then it's being in that vehicle it's hot
humid<00:02:25.190> my<00:02:26.190> legs<00:02:26.370> get<00:02:26.610> sweating<00:02:27.090> and<00:02:27.239> my

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
humid my legs get sweating and my

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.170 
humid my legs get sweating and my
prostate<00:02:27.780> starts<00:02:28.260> to<00:02:28.379> slip<00:02:28.830> and<00:02:29.190> then<00:02:29.370> they

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
prostate starts to slip and then they

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.120 
prostate starts to slip and then they
start<00:02:30.480> to<00:02:30.599> rub<00:02:30.870> and<00:02:31.200> it<00:02:31.319> says<00:02:31.530> the<00:02:31.739> general

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
start to rub and it says the general

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.650 
start to rub and it says the general
maintenance<00:02:32.250> of<00:02:32.580> my<00:02:32.730> body<00:02:32.940> and<00:02:33.120> then<00:02:33.300> then

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
maintenance of my body and then then

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.089 
maintenance of my body and then then
it's<00:02:33.840> the<00:02:33.930> maintenance<00:02:34.110> of<00:02:34.380> the<00:02:34.470> prosthetics

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
it's the maintenance of the prosthetics

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:37.040 
it's the maintenance of the prosthetics
so<00:02:35.430> if<00:02:35.550> you<00:02:35.700> get<00:02:35.849> water<00:02:36.120> or<00:02:36.390> sand<00:02:36.660> or<00:02:36.870> anything

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
so if you get water or sand or anything

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.039 
so if you get water or sand or anything
in<00:02:37.260> them<00:02:37.500> I<00:02:37.800> mean<00:02:38.489> they<00:02:38.940> could<00:02:39.150> mess<00:02:39.870> up

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049 
in them I mean they could mess up

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:42.530 
in them I mean they could mess up
basically<00:02:40.590> so<00:02:40.890> it's<00:02:41.400> it's<00:02:41.730> all<00:02:41.910> about<00:02:42.150> looking

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
basically so it's it's all about looking

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.119 
basically so it's it's all about looking
after<00:02:42.900> ourselves<00:02:43.080> and<00:02:43.560> the<00:02:43.650> two<00:02:43.799> hours<00:02:43.920> sleep

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:44.129 
after ourselves and the two hours sleep

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:48.380 
after ourselves and the two hours sleep
and<00:02:44.670> the<00:02:44.849> six<00:02:45.209> thousand<00:02:45.480> mile<00:02:45.629> spider<00:02:46.410> by<00:02:47.390> I

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
and the six thousand mile spider by I

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.350 
and the six thousand mile spider by I
guess<00:02:49.140> those<00:02:49.290> both<00:02:49.560> both<00:02:50.250> as<00:02:50.430> co-drivers

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
guess those both both as co-drivers

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.210 
guess those both both as co-drivers
doing<00:02:51.630> the<00:02:51.989> same<00:02:52.140> job<00:02:52.349> in<00:02:52.440> different<00:02:52.709> cars<00:02:52.920> in

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
doing the same job in different cars in

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.920 
doing the same job in different cars in
some<00:02:53.819> ways<00:02:53.910> that's<00:02:54.209> a<00:02:54.390> level<00:02:54.720> up<00:02:54.810> because

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
some ways that's a level up because

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.050 
some ways that's a level up because
there's<00:02:55.200> nothing<00:02:55.349> that<00:02:55.500> you<00:02:55.769> can't<00:02:56.640> do<00:02:56.880> that

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
there's nothing that you can't do that

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.330 
there's nothing that you can't do that
mat<00:02:57.390> can<00:02:57.540> do<00:02:57.660> and<00:02:57.900> vice<00:02:57.989> versa<00:02:58.260> yeah<00:02:58.799> this<00:02:59.190> is

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
mat can do and vice versa yeah this is

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.550 
mat can do and vice versa yeah this is
it<00:02:59.459> exactly<00:03:00.150> like<00:03:00.239> you<00:03:00.360> said<00:03:00.540> I<00:03:00.569> when<00:03:01.290> we're<00:03:01.440> in

with<00:03:33.840> a<00:03:33.930> new<00:03:34.019> gearbox<00:03:34.260> and<00:03:34.709> a<00:03:34.769> different

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:35.069 
with a new gearbox and a different

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:36.470 
with a new gearbox and a different
clutch<00:03:35.250> and<00:03:35.549> it's<00:03:35.670> been<00:03:35.850> slightly<00:03:36.120> tweaked

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
clutch and it's been slightly tweaked

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.150 
clutch and it's been slightly tweaked
there<00:03:37.139> on<00:03:37.230> the<00:03:37.319> level<00:03:37.530> playing<00:03:37.709> field<00:03:37.950> which<00:03:38.100> i

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
there on the level playing field which i

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.410 
there on the level playing field which i
think<00:03:38.220> is<00:03:38.400> a<00:03:38.430> beauty<00:03:38.730> of<00:03:38.790> Motorsports<00:03:39.209> but

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
think is a beauty of Motorsports but

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.449 
think is a beauty of Motorsports but
yeah<00:03:39.569> he's<00:03:40.260> unlike<00:03:40.530> any<00:03:40.709> other<00:03:40.889> sport<00:03:41.250> and

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
yeah he's unlike any other sport and

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:42.979 
yeah he's unlike any other sport and
that's<00:03:41.549> that<00:03:42.239> I<00:03:42.299> can<00:03:42.480> think<00:03:42.630> of<00:03:42.750> in<00:03:42.900> that

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
that's that I can think of in that

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:44.629 
that's that I can think of in that
respect<00:03:43.319> so<00:03:43.829> I'm<00:03:43.920> just<00:03:44.040> give<00:03:44.190> us<00:03:44.280> a<00:03:44.340> feeling<00:03:44.519> of

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:44.639 
respect so I'm just give us a feeling of

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:46.099 
respect so I'm just give us a feeling of
how<00:03:45.239> much<00:03:45.420> you<00:03:45.569> think<00:03:45.720> your<00:03:45.810> military

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:46.109 
how much you think your military

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:47.449 
how much you think your military
training<00:03:46.200> is<00:03:46.620> gonna<00:03:46.769> is<00:03:47.010> going<00:03:47.130> to<00:03:47.190> help<00:03:47.340> you

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
training is gonna is going to help you

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.789 
training is gonna is going to help you
when<00:03:47.579> you<00:03:47.639> actually<00:03:47.730> get<00:03:47.970> out<00:03:48.090> there<00:03:48.200> I<00:03:49.200> always

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
when you actually get out there I always

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:51.259 
when you actually get out there I always
think<00:03:50.010> a<00:03:50.100> fair<00:03:50.310> bit<00:03:50.489> I<00:03:50.519> think<00:03:50.790> we've<00:03:50.880> got<00:03:51.060> a<00:03:51.090> bit

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
think a fair bit I think we've got a bit

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:52.879 
think a fair bit I think we've got a bit
of<00:03:51.329> an<00:03:51.389> advantage<00:03:51.810> when<00:03:51.959> it<00:03:52.019> comes<00:03:52.260> to<00:03:52.560> like

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:52.889 
of an advantage when it comes to like

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:54.920 
of an advantage when it comes to like
sleep<00:03:53.160> deprivation<00:03:53.340> and<00:03:54.209> looking<00:03:54.690> after

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
sleep deprivation and looking after

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.629 
sleep deprivation and looking after
ourselves<00:03:55.049> and<00:03:55.500> we've<00:03:55.859> got<00:03:56.069> a<00:03:56.100> big<00:03:56.340> advance

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:56.639 
ourselves and we've got a big advance

00:03:56.639 --> 00:03:57.800 
ourselves and we've got a big advance
when<00:03:56.819> it<00:03:56.880> comes<00:03:57.000> out<00:03:57.180> so<00:03:57.209> it's<00:03:57.359> a<00:03:57.480> day-to-day

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
when it comes out so it's a day-to-day

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.890 
when it comes out so it's a day-to-day
thing<00:03:57.930> with<00:03:58.290> us<00:03:58.500> but<00:03:59.420> yeah<00:04:00.420> I<00:04:00.450> think<00:04:00.510> we<00:04:00.750> can

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
thing with us but yeah I think we can

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.170 
thing with us but yeah I think we can
use<00:04:01.349> that<00:04:01.560> and<00:04:01.739> put<00:04:02.340> that<00:04:02.400> into<00:04:02.639> the<00:04:02.760> actual

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
use that and put that into the actual

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.660 
use that and put that into the actual
vehicle<00:04:03.389> side<00:04:03.959> of<00:04:04.079> things<00:04:04.260> and<00:04:04.470> that<00:04:04.590> I<00:04:05.160> know

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
vehicle side of things and that I know

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.550 
vehicle side of things and that I know
the<00:04:05.760> mechanics<00:04:06.030> will<00:04:06.389> be<00:04:06.510> working<00:04:06.870> hard<00:04:07.079> like

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
the mechanics will be working hard like

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.080 
the mechanics will be working hard like
they<00:04:07.709> would<00:04:07.920> do<00:04:08.069> on<00:04:08.190> a<00:04:08.310> day<00:04:08.430> to<00:04:08.489> day<00:04:08.609> basis

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
they would do on a day to day basis

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.259 
they would do on a day to day basis
anyway<00:04:09.359> and<00:04:09.599> it's<00:04:10.160> it's<00:04:11.160> I<00:04:11.459> think<00:04:11.519> it's<00:04:12.150> gonna

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
anyway and it's it's I think it's gonna

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:14.809 
anyway and it's it's I think it's gonna
be<00:04:12.450> a<00:04:12.690> brilliant<00:04:13.650> thing<00:04:13.919> you<00:04:13.980> know<00:04:14.099> of<00:04:14.489> the

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:14.819 
be a brilliant thing you know of the

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:16.400 
be a brilliant thing you know of the
experience<00:04:15.180> that<00:04:15.239> we<00:04:15.359> go<00:04:15.480> you<00:04:15.959> wore<00:04:16.109> it<00:04:16.200> at<00:04:16.289> all

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
experience that we go you wore it at all

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:17.629 
experience that we go you wore it at all
that<00:04:16.440> the<00:04:16.620> organizers<00:04:17.099> might<00:04:17.250> have<00:04:17.400> an<00:04:17.489> issue

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:17.639 
that the organizers might have an issue

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:18.949 
that the organizers might have an issue
with<00:04:17.940> the<00:04:18.060> fact<00:04:18.209> that<00:04:18.269> the<00:04:18.389> race<00:04:18.539> basically

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
with the fact that the race basically

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.479 
with the fact that the race basically
won't<00:04:19.139> be<00:04:19.289> fair<00:04:19.560> because<00:04:19.919> your<00:04:20.190> British

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
won't be fair because your British

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.300 
won't be fair because your British
forces<00:04:21.019> well<00:04:22.019> it<00:04:22.109> starts<00:04:22.530> in<00:04:22.590> Argentina<00:04:23.039> so

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
forces well it starts in Argentina so

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:24.680 
forces well it starts in Argentina so
maybe<00:04:23.550> yeah

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
maybe yeah

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.440 
maybe yeah
