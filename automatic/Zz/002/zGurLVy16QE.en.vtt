00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:13.469
 who have these five bottles in common 

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:17.040
 good a priori it seems like nothing but 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:21.590
 if we pay a little attention to the 

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.590
 container let's find an icon 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:29.000
 who share all is this 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:31.960
 here we find it too 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.960
 here too 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:37.450
 and here too and that is the subject of 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:40.870
 we will talk about recycling 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:42.430
 and this in germany is the symbol that 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.430
 indicates that a bottle can be 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:48.660
 returnable and is refundable and therefore 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.660
 so much will be recyclable 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.899
 And here we are this is the place where 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:57.559
 They recycle plastic bottles with 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:59.960
 symbol of funk we go there and this is the 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:02.809
 machine 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.330
 we use to recycle the 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:07.820
 plastic bottles in germany here 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.070
 there is a small explanation of how 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:13.700
 it works and here they have to end 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:16.310
 a ticket will come out if you choose the function 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.600
 of money to be able to reimburse him or her 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.690
 it can be donated to the ship of 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.530
 food let's start are introduced 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.530
 here the bottles 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.120
 The truth is that for each of the 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:31.430
 containers irrespective of 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:34.960
 We will reimburse a total of 25 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.960
 cents per container 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.170
 we carry a few can be recycled 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:44.710
 as much beer bottles as you could 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:48.630
 of water plastic as days of 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:53.189
 soda bottles 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:56.130
 big small bottles to this one says 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:59.110
 you do not know it go sometimes you can 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.870
 happen that some of you think that 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:04.060
 you can reimburse but it's not like that 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:06.010
 because it has been precisely cast 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.180
 without the symbol 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.180
 of recycling 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:16.190
 and how have we stopped before chopping has 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:19.610
 the ticket came out and here we have two 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.980
 euros to be able to reimburse in the box 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.990
 today we have two tickets of two and three 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.230
 euros and reaching the box we are going to 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:29.519
 exchange 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.519
 and pay in the purchase
