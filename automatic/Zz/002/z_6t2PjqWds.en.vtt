00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:13.329
 hi lorllys is approaching halloween and already 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:14.950
 you know that you are going to disguise in 

00:00:13.329 --> 00:00:17.080
 this video I'm going to show you a 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.780
 spooky makeup for this 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:23.620
 halloween 2013 

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:26.380
 I personally adore this makeup on 

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:28.750
 purple I love the truth and it's 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:32.379
 inspired by the rapunzel doll of the 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:35.469
 collection one stopper zombie two so 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:37.030
 let's start for this makeup I'm going to 

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:39.590
 use those contact lenses that are 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.540
 moraditas 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.210
 The first thing we are going to do is cover 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:47.270
 our tiles with glue boy a 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:50.090
 life-long bar glue 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:52.850
 it will seem weird but it works very well 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:56.090
 and it looks very good then the tiles on 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.370
 everything if your hair is more finite I'm going to 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.710
 use a pre-base to prepare 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:04.210
 me the eyes and with corrector I will cover 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:06.100
 I eyebrows with care 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.080
 I'm going to correct all the 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.150
 imperfections that I want to cover because 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.060
 being a wrist makeup we want 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:15.820
 have perfectly perfect skin for 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.010
 that gives the impression of the skin of a 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.550
 porcelain doll 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:23.260
 and with little touches as you see we are going like this 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:25.080
 Blurring the eyebrow corrector for 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.830
 that is not so 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.840
 so so I'm going to use a base 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.870
 blade that I am using now but 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.250
 if you have makeup a little bit more 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:38.640
 pale that the tone of your skin would be 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:41.190
 much better but I did not have it and I'm going 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.580
 putting on my whole face and blew it 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.920
 well and to have that pale shade of 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.560
 doll what I'm going to do is instead of 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.480
 normal compact powders to give the 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.570
 for the face I'm going to use a shadow 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:58.260
 white now what we are going to do is 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.760
 draw our eyebrows especially if the 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.640
 you have like me who does not look like anything 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.920
 when making the doll I'm going to use 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.780
 this eyebrow template that is the one 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:11.060
 I found it more similar to that of the 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:13.350
 doll and I'm filling it with shadow 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.920
 Brown 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:20.220
 that is consistent with the tone of my hair and 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.020
 I will correct the entire edge with shadow 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.510
 white as I have done with the rest of my 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.580
 face and now yes we go with the 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.700
 makeup of the eyes first I'm going to 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.500
 draw a line as if it were the 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.170
 fold my eye but a little bit more 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.730
 up with gray shadow just in case 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.690
 We mistake that we can erase it 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.480
 easily 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:43.600
 and it is very easy to simply have the 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.550
 image of the doll in sight so that 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.640
 you may guide you as I have done well 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.470
 during all the makeup so I could see 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.560
 If I was wrong about something or not 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:55.480
 had to correct something whatever and 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.700
 now just like on the wrist I'm going to 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.380
 put a little shadow to brown 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.870
 more or less 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.960
 from the fold up to 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.940
 the eyebrow that is how she has it and why 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.920
 under the entire eyelid let's say 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.110
 under the fold of that line that 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:14.290
 we have done what we are going to put with shadow 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:17.800
 white then let's put that little bit 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:20.080
 of purple shadow there that is as if 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.450
 just look at the wrist try 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.970
 imitate your makeup as much as possible 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.800
 As you can see, he shares the line with me 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.320
 black eyeliner and Medellin and in the 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.000
 top part of the tabs now what 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:34.090
 what we are going to do is with a little bit of 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.700
 gray shadow let's review us for the 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.620
 bottom part of the tabs following 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.640
 the little pug I made with the eyeliner 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.470
 black on the top of the eyelashes 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.420
 and we're going to get castilla-the mental 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.940
 eye a little bit more now I'm 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.890
 outlining the whole part of the line of 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:53.160
 water with black eyeliner on top and 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.959
 below and now important part I 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.880
 I'm going to put on the false eyelashes that 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:59.340
 that's what is going to make my eyes 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:02.040
 look more like doll for 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.480
 look bigger we take mascara 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.130
 being careful not to spoil the 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.070
 makeup as you see I use a 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:10.950
 card or something because that's the truth 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:13.530
 which is much easier and above 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.959
 and down below as the eyelashes 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:20.040
 False seemed too well 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:22.230
 I do not know I did not see it well I preferred 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.570
 paint my eyelashes with eyeliner 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:26.910
 black and I think it resembled more 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:30.360
 wrist makeup did not fit me very 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:32.280
 good but good is decent and now 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:35.580
 we move to the lips that already have them 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:37.730
 so purple is a darker purple the 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:41.130
 true but good I just got this 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:42.630
 and has the little pits a little apart and 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:45.840
 rounded which is what I'm going to try 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:48.330
 imitate as you are watching in the video and 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.849
 I'm going to outline all my lips 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.800
 you have them bigger because to make it a 

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:56.039
 little little one but how my lips are 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:58.620
 pretty little ones I did not need and 

00:04:56.039 --> 00:05:00.840
 now I'm going to delineate all that seam of 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:03.629
 the mouth with a little bit of gray shadow already 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:06.870
 that does not have it very marked, I think 

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:09.530
 so it was much better and drawing me 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:11.909
 those lines that make it look stitched 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:14.189
 the truth is that I find a makeup 

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:16.050
 very simple and very easy to do and that 

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:19.439
 it is very very good especially for the 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:21.259
 eyes I think it is very original and good 

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:23.789
 I hope you like you too 

00:05:21.259 --> 00:05:25.319
 As you can see on my lips, I put on a little 

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:27.870
 of gloss because you already have and 

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:29.610
 very bright and with the gloss I was 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:31.409
 a little color but good if 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:34.710
 you get a purple lipstick a lot 

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:36.629
 better now we go with the hairstyle what 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:39.270
 let's do is take a lock of the 

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:41.159
 part of below and with that lock we are going to 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:43.060
 make us a normal braid of those of 

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:45.430
 all life 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:47.990
 which is with which we are going to surround all the 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:50.060
 pigtail as she has 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:55.200
 you already know how to make a braid 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:58.620
 simply link link 

00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:00.570
 we miss with a rubber band at the end and now 

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:02.250
 As I do not have long bangs like 

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:04.760
 has already what I'm going to do is make myself 

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:07.590
 the line a little bit more to the side to 

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:10.140
 the lock catch me next and 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:12.630
 look like I had the long flex 

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:15.330
 as you are seeing there I thistle me one 

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:17.580
 little bit to make it look a little bit more 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:19.740
 of volume 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:21.449
 and now we put all the hair to a 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:24.930
 side and with that braid let's go 

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:27.419
 surrounding all the hair 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:30.000
 that is just how he has the hairstyle 

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:33.570
 obviously with much more volume of hair 

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:38.470
 but I do not have that much and we treat each other 

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:40.120
 so a pigtail at the end and ready 

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:41.860
 I hope you liked this one 

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:43.930
 makeup as much as me and that 

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:46.150
 use this halloween for sure 

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:47.950
 will draw a lot of attention 

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:51.870
 thanks for watching the video and happy 

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:51.870
 halloween dance
