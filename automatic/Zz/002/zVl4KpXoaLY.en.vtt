00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:07.049
 the research that helped to discover 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.110
 one of the fundamental causes of 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.880
 aging won the Nobel Prize 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.799
 the answer can not be seen with the naked eye 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.470
 it's something called 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.840
 lots sea ​​telomeres are 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.430
 repetitive adr segments that become 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.289
 capsules or extremities 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.710
 protectors are our chromosomes 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:28.080
 their task is to protect our DNA from 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.480
 birth telomeres are slow 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.990
 but with time it starts to 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.090
 shorten so short indeed that there 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:37.290
 pinch like the pudding the scene and the 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.260
 process called the 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.360
 cellular aging goals when 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.710
 telomeres are becoming too short 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.640
 cells can no longer do their 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.490
 crucial functions 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.130
 she begins to self-destruct and 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:51.440
 end up dying 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.330
 scientists call this phenomenon 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.280
 apoptosis cell death is a 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.440
 thing but when she simply 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.540
 to operate they can relax 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.280
 dangerous free radicals and 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.540
 inflammatory molecules that damage 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.470
 basically the cells 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.930
 surrounding 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.340
 so how do we fight this 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.080
 process called aging 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.460
 cellular 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.440
 it has been shown that a nutrient 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.540
 could naturally improve launched 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.660
 needed to lengthen the telomeres 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.250
 courses thus adding a healthy life to our 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.170
 cell 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.150
 thousands of studies show the link 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.380
 between the telomere course and the 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.400
 natural aging process 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.410
 cellular 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.300
 even more fascinating is that it 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:33.580
 this is the only known substance in 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:38.440
 the whole history of humanity that can 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:39.690
 have this effect get ready for 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.490
 the future 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:44.790
 cellular aging stops 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.790
 right here 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:13.220
 finity advanced technology in 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.520
 rejuvenation an exclusivity of 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.520
 youth
