00:00:01.649 --> 00:00:04.370
 but of course take into account the fact that Tavria 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:06.759
 got into such a situation what were 

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:08.969
 we are in the last days 

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:10.549
 six 

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:12.999
 when the game goes on the third fourth day 

00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:14.419
 of course it's hard 

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:15.909
 office is the first 

00:00:15.909 --> 00:00:18.029
 rub and we almost all games play 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.029
 practically in this mode 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:24.079
 but still even against the backdrop 

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:26.429
 same to receive june 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:27.939
 showed quite a lot 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:30.710
 good player player result 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.140
 but still the speed we require 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.690
 which else 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.910
 district and those that we wanted 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.440
 win and yes interaction 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.660
 some players it leaves much to be desired 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:42.490
 the best 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:45.120
 we have planned more after the game Mariupol 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.430
 what he 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.430
 regional give a chance to express themselves and 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.980
 aruna therefore it was such a planned 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.590
 plan believe in what we continue 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.790
 worry could the football players 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.540
 marginal speaking at such in time trouble we are not 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:03.190
 we have 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:04.220
 opportunity to experiment 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.010
 here they are for a longer time when 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.060
 they worked with the team when we 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.920
 we saw their potential and we try to 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.590
 also can also be manifested in the fact that 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:14.630
 workout 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.480
 Thursday will not replace them in credit 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:18.590
 in the shelter 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.280
 true values ​​to the players they are all the same 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.220
 show 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.680
 it is very important that the project we did not give 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.650
 brands to creators 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.650
 in some less dangerous moments 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.730
 quite clearly played in defense and in 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:34.960
 as a result of the shoulder blades it is very important though 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.050
 Of course, the opponent’s bringing is available 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.020
 bring back the euro is not like 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.149
 showed Tavriya 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:43.209
 all the same speed for hacking is not so 

00:01:43.209 --> 00:01:44.570
 defense needed 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.500
 of course much higher and using its barely 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.080
 craftsmanship 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.050
 say again that 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.220
 now she herself is important what we have achieved 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.220
 result 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.320
 despite the korean revealed 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.160
 sliska pressure which was on 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.560
 team all teams especially after 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.810
 by the sum of two games files sport weekend 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.029
 or chelsea when 

00:02:13.029 --> 00:02:15.149
 in any case 

00:02:15.149 --> 00:02:17.769
 we were obliged to take it 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:19.779
 hone what we took 

00:02:19.779 --> 00:02:21.690
 and of course further 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.629
 when there was nowhere to retreat 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:26.439
 I think in this area is not easy 

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:28.579
 situation but still showed this game and 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:30.609
 the result that from us 

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:32.289
 we are very important 

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:35.089
 after this story nikolai baskov 

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:38.349
 a.enchenko alexis turn from customs 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:40.389
 than fifty lack even 

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:43.029
 question about the demolition of the case of the judge who what he 

00:02:43.029 --> 00:02:43.450
 will be 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.089
 This result is a match with the port 

00:02:46.089 --> 00:02:47.719
 banal 

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:49.849
 this problem is command equipment 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:51.989
 just on the eve of the game a little poisoned 7 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:53.839
 Odessa 

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:55.989
 recently that the moment he is already in 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:57.609
 alright just rubbish solution 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:02:58.409
 purely 

00:02:58.409 --> 00:02:59.879
 but also 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:02.299
 we have enough football players 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:04.499
 especially on those positions that we 

00:03:04.499 --> 00:03:05.309
 can we 

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:07.369
 using russia can 

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:08.219
 ignore 

00:03:08.219 --> 00:03:10.099
 various midfield options 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:11.699
 in place therefore 

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:14.579
 ii we manage to stage human rights defenders 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:16.299
 who has always performed for a second 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:18.969
 this 

00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:21.409
 what speech and crown will he handle with this 

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:23.029
 task 

00:03:23.029 --> 00:03:24.459
 many questions 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:27.809
 Aleksey Aleksandrovich 

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:30.809
 issued 2 watts per channel 

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:35.679
 decorated apparently remembering your installations 

00:03:35.679 --> 00:03:38.739
 native mother 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:40.449
 as if hard 

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:42.679
 and still very much 

00:03:42.679 --> 00:03:45.009
 his words he himself 

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:47.499
 the biggest responsibility and 

00:03:47.499 --> 00:03:50.499
 complicated by it 

00:03:51.499 --> 00:03:54.499
 now i 

00:03:56.439 --> 00:03:59.489
 of course she 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.489
 thank you right 

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:09.180
 although now he has come
