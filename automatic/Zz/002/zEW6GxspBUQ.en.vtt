00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:35.000 

one<00:00:33.600> of<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.809> most<00:00:33.989> important<00:00:34.499> parts<00:00:34.739> of<00:00:34.859> the

one of the most important parts of the

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.029 
one of the most important parts of the
scenery<00:00:35.370> is<00:00:35.609> your<00:00:36.480> base<00:00:36.659> texture<00:00:37.109> this<00:00:37.679> is<00:00:37.859> the

00:00:38.029 --> 00:00:38.039 
scenery is your base texture this is the

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:39.560 
scenery is your base texture this is the
difference<00:00:38.370> between<00:00:38.460> good<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.149> great

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
difference between good and great

scooped up from the riverbank it's

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.000 
scooped up from the riverbank it's
important<00:00:45.719> to<00:00:45.780> note<00:00:45.929> that<00:00:45.960> this<00:00:46.260> is<00:00:46.469> not<00:00:46.679> sound

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
important to note that this is not sound

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.130 
important to note that this is not sound
it's<00:00:47.219> clay<00:00:47.519> and<00:00:47.760> this<00:00:48.329> is<00:00:48.570> just<00:00:48.869> what<00:00:49.019> I'm

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
it's clay and this is just what I'm

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.549 
it's clay and this is just what I'm
after<00:00:49.549> it<00:00:50.549> needs<00:00:50.729> to<00:00:50.850> be<00:00:50.969> dry<00:00:51.539> before<00:00:51.930> sifting

after it needs to be dry before sifting

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.259 
after it needs to be dry before sifting
you<00:00:53.070> could<00:00:53.250> just<00:00:53.460> leave<00:00:53.579> it<00:00:53.760> for<00:00:53.909> a<00:00:53.969> couple<00:00:54.239> of

00:00:54.259 --> 00:00:54.269 
you could just leave it for a couple of

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:56.179 
you could just leave it for a couple of
days<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.600> dry<00:00:54.839> or<00:00:55.260> you<00:00:55.320> could<00:00:55.680> cook<00:00:55.829> it<00:00:55.979> in<00:00:56.100> the

00:00:56.179 --> 00:00:56.189 
days to dry or you could cook it in the

days to dry or you could cook it in the
oven<00:00:56.219> but<00:00:57.059> you<00:00:57.180> better<00:00:57.329> check<00:00:57.570> with<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:57.750> chef
