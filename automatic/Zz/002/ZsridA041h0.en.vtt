I<00:00:03.939> believe<00:00:04.939> everybody's<00:00:05.420> familiar<00:00:05.630> with<00:00:05.990> a

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:06.140 
I believe everybody's familiar with a

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:10.750 
I believe everybody's familiar with a
stock<00:00:06.500> airbox<00:00:07.149> on<00:00:08.149> the<00:00:08.450> v-max<00:00:09.309> when<00:00:10.309> you<00:00:10.430> open

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:10.760 
stock airbox on the v-max when you open

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.549 
stock airbox on the v-max when you open
that<00:00:10.789> up<00:00:11.559> or<00:00:12.559> search<00:00:12.770> the<00:00:12.949> stock<00:00:13.279> filter<00:00:14.559> when

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:15.559 
that up or search the stock filter when

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:19.180 
that up or search the stock filter when
you<00:00:15.680> take<00:00:15.889> that<00:00:16.100> stock<00:00:16.369> filter<00:00:16.850> out<00:00:18.190> this

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:19.190 
you take that stock filter out this

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:24.430 
you take that stock filter out this
opening<00:00:19.790> is<00:00:19.940> what's<00:00:20.210> restricting<00:00:22.150> the<00:00:23.440> v-max

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:24.440 
opening is what's restricting the v-max

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.080 
opening is what's restricting the v-max
for<00:00:24.680> making<00:00:24.950> the<00:00:25.039> most<00:00:25.250> horsepower<00:00:25.490> on<00:00:25.940> the

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:26.090 
for making the most horsepower on the

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:30.160 
for making the most horsepower on the
dyno<00:00:28.119> when<00:00:29.119> you<00:00:29.210> take<00:00:29.420> the<00:00:29.539> top<00:00:29.690> of<00:00:29.869> this<00:00:29.960> there

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:30.170 
dyno when you take the top of this there

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:31.810 
dyno when you take the top of this there
you<00:00:30.440> can<00:00:30.650> take<00:00:30.800> this<00:00:30.949> filter<00:00:31.369> out<00:00:31.520> and<00:00:31.699> get

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:31.820 
you can take this filter out and get

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.340 
you can take this filter out and get
about<00:00:32.029> five<00:00:32.270> horsepower<00:00:32.570> when<00:00:32.989> you<00:00:33.079> take<00:00:33.260> the

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.350 
about five horsepower when you take the

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.649 
about five horsepower when you take the
top<00:00:33.500> the<00:00:33.680> box<00:00:33.890> off<00:00:34.129> you<00:00:34.309> get<00:00:34.430> about<00:00:35.210> five<00:00:35.420> or

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:35.659 
top the box off you get about five or

00:00:35.659 --> 00:00:38.049 
top the box off you get about five or
five<00:00:35.899> more<00:00:36.140> depending<00:00:36.920> on<00:00:37.039> what<00:00:37.819> kind<00:00:37.940> of

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:38.059 
five more depending on what kind of

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:41.290 
five more depending on what kind of
exhaust<00:00:38.420> system<00:00:38.839> you<00:00:38.960> might<00:00:39.140> get<00:00:39.350> more<00:00:40.059> so<00:00:41.059> I

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
exhaust system you might get more so I

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.040 
exhaust system you might get more so I
was<00:00:41.809> going<00:00:42.019> to<00:00:42.109> cut<00:00:42.289> this<00:00:42.469> out<00:00:42.710> to<00:00:43.699> see<00:00:43.809> if<00:00:44.809> I

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050 
was going to cut this out to see if I

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.250 
was going to cut this out to see if I
could<00:00:45.969> get<00:00:46.969> some<00:00:47.420> of<00:00:47.539> that<00:00:47.569> five<00:00:47.899> horsepower

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 
could get some of that five horsepower

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.879 
could get some of that five horsepower
but<00:00:48.649> still<00:00:48.949> have<00:00:49.219> the<00:00:49.780> top<00:00:50.780> of<00:00:50.899> the<00:00:50.960> box<00:00:51.170> on<00:00:51.499> I

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:51.889 
but still have the top of the box on I

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:55.840 
but still have the top of the box on I
preferred<00:00:52.639> leave<00:00:52.969> all<00:00:53.269> my<00:00:53.739> air<00:00:54.739> box<00:00:55.069> and<00:00:55.489> the

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
preferred leave all my air box and the

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.289 
preferred leave all my air box and the
YCC<00:00:56.600> T's<00:00:57.079> and<00:00:57.679> Y<00:00:57.799> CCI<00:00:58.219> and<00:00:58.699> all<00:00:58.789> that<00:00:58.999> still

00:00:59.289 --> 00:00:59.299 
YCC T's and Y CCI and all that still

00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:00.969 
YCC T's and Y CCI and all that still
intact<00:00:59.719> I<00:00:59.960> found<00:01:00.289> it<00:01:00.499> and<00:01:00.620> leaving<00:01:00.799> the

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:00.979 
intact I found it and leaving the

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:02.590 
intact I found it and leaving the
induction<00:01:01.309> system<00:01:01.760> intact<00:01:02.089> gives<00:01:02.420> it<00:01:02.569> a

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 
induction system intact gives it a

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.350 
induction system intact gives it a
little<00:01:02.809> more<00:01:02.959> horsepower<00:01:03.170> and<00:01:04.000> torque<00:01:05.000> on<00:01:05.239> the

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
little more horsepower and torque on the

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.020 
little more horsepower and torque on the
bottom<00:01:05.630> in<00:01:06.039> so<00:01:07.039> I<00:01:07.070> got<00:01:07.310> to<00:01:07.490> looking<00:01:07.729> at<00:01:07.880> this

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
bottom in so I got to looking at this

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:14.370 
bottom in so I got to looking at this
box<00:01:10.060> and<00:01:11.060> let<00:01:11.719> me<00:01:11.840> zoom<00:01:11.869> in<00:01:12.320> here<00:01:12.350> a<00:01:12.649> little<00:01:12.799> bit

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
box and let me zoom in here a little bit

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.749 
box and let me zoom in here a little bit
hopefully<00:01:15.380> you<00:01:15.500> can<00:01:15.649> see<00:01:15.920> that<00:01:16.780> that<00:01:18.759> slides

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:19.759 
hopefully you can see that that slides

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:27.370 
hopefully you can see that that slides
down<00:01:20.119> into<00:01:20.799> a<00:01:21.799> track<00:01:23.890> so<00:01:24.890> this<00:01:25.159> piece<00:01:26.259> has<00:01:27.259> got

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
down into a track so this piece has got

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.670 
down into a track so this piece has got
some<00:01:27.799> melted<00:01:28.399> plastic<00:01:29.259> studs

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
some melted plastic studs

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:36.870 
some melted plastic studs
I<00:01:30.710> guess<00:01:31.429> they<00:01:31.609> melt<00:01:31.850> it<00:01:31.969> over<00:01:32.090> to<00:01:32.359> retain<00:01:35.500> I

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
I guess they melt it over to retain I

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.130 
I guess they melt it over to retain I
think<00:01:37.880> you've<00:01:38.030> got<00:01:38.240> grind<00:01:38.539> those<00:01:38.780> little

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
think you've got grind those little

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.330 
think you've got grind those little
studs<00:01:39.439> on<00:01:39.740> off<00:01:39.859> those<00:01:40.130> three<00:01:40.429> little<00:01:40.670> studs

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
studs on off those three little studs

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.279 
studs on off those three little studs
this<00:01:43.340> whole<00:01:43.640> little<00:01:44.119> window<00:01:44.659> will<00:01:44.960> come<00:01:45.109> out

00:01:45.279 --> 00:01:45.289 
this whole little window will come out

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:47.010 
this whole little window will come out
of<00:01:45.439> there

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
of there

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.469 
of there
and<00:01:48.020> open<00:01:48.350> up<00:01:48.820> the<00:01:49.820> back<00:01:50.030> of<00:01:50.060> this<00:01:50.920> air<00:01:51.920> box<00:01:52.130> up

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 
and open up the back of this air box up

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:55.270 
and open up the back of this air box up
find<00:01:53.479> enough<00:01:53.749> for<00:01:53.960> this<00:01:54.079> whole<00:01:54.289> filter<00:01:55.100> to

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
find enough for this whole filter to

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.919 
find enough for this whole filter to
actually<00:01:57.009> this<00:01:58.009> seems<00:01:58.249> like<00:01:58.340> it's<00:01:58.929> very

00:01:59.919 --> 00:01:59.929 
actually this seems like it's very

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:01.200 
actually this seems like it's very
restrictive

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
restrictive

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:41.210 
restrictive
grind<00:02:02.210> it<00:02:02.450> and<00:02:02.600> see<00:02:02.689> what<00:02:02.840> happened

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:57.120 

getting<00:02:42.220> right<00:02:42.370> out<00:02:44.730> it<00:02:45.730> is<00:02:48.330> now<00:02:53.820> in<00:02:56.130> first

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
getting right out it is now in first

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.170 
getting right out it is now in first
year<00:02:57.310> wheel<00:02:58.470> there<00:02:59.470> you<00:02:59.620> go

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
year wheel there you go

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.080 
year wheel there you go
and<00:03:01.180> you'll<00:03:01.600> still<00:03:01.810> have<00:03:02.280> ram<00:03:03.280> air<00:03:03.610> from<00:03:03.940> the

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
and you'll still have ram air from the

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.770 
and you'll still have ram air from the
outside<00:03:05.160> still<00:03:06.160> have<00:03:06.370> your<00:03:06.610> Yamaha<00:03:07.420> chip

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
outside still have your Yamaha chip

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.480 
outside still have your Yamaha chip
controlled<00:03:08.170> in<00:03:08.350> taking<00:03:08.830> it<00:03:08.980> to<00:03:11.400> you<00:03:12.400> to

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:12.490 
controlled in taking it to you to

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:17.670 
controlled in taking it to you to
control<00:03:12.760> intake<00:03:14.190> yeah<00:03:15.870> that's<00:03:16.870> a<00:03:17.020> big-ass<00:03:17.380> air

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
control intake yeah that's a big-ass air

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.520 
control intake yeah that's a big-ass air
box<00:03:17.950> I<00:03:18.280> guess
