hey guys I'm back again so where it's
time<00:00:03.210> here<00:00:03.480> to<00:00:03.659> unbox<00:00:03.810> the<00:00:04.350> Asus<00:00:04.980> zenfone<00:00:05.339> 2

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:06.410 
time here to unbox the Asus zenfone 2

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:09.740 
time here to unbox the Asus zenfone 2

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
which no you're not having deja vu I

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.310 
which no you're not having deja vu I
know<00:00:09.870> that<00:00:10.200> I've<00:00:10.260> already<00:00:10.410> unboxed<00:00:10.880> zenfone<00:00:11.880> 2

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:12.320 
know that I've already unboxed zenfone 2

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.589 
know that I've already unboxed zenfone 2
but<00:00:13.320> this<00:00:13.500> is<00:00:13.740> the<00:00:13.889> actual<00:00:14.070> 4<00:00:14.580> gig<00:00:14.849> RAM<00:00:15.240> model

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
but this is the actual 4 gig RAM model

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.980 
but this is the actual 4 gig RAM model
now<00:00:15.929> not<00:00:16.379> the<00:00:16.560> 2<00:00:16.800> gig<00:00:17.070> ram<00:00:17.570> which<00:00:18.570> I<00:00:18.720> didn't

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
now not the 2 gig ram which I didn't

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.950 
now not the 2 gig ram which I didn't
actually<00:00:19.140> mean<00:00:19.560> to<00:00:19.619> buy<00:00:19.980> but<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:21.119> brand<00:00:21.689> name

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
actually mean to buy but the brand name

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.019 
actually mean to buy but the brand name
kind<00:00:22.920> of<00:00:22.980> confused<00:00:23.490> me<00:00:23.670> a<00:00:23.699> bit

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
kind of confused me a bit

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.000 
kind of confused me a bit
I<00:00:24.180> do<00:00:24.570> think<00:00:24.869> Asus<00:00:25.199> could<00:00:25.380> be<00:00:25.470> a<00:00:25.500> bit<00:00:25.710> more

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
I do think Asus could be a bit more

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.570 
I do think Asus could be a bit more
clearer<00:00:26.519> here<00:00:27.390> what<00:00:27.720> you're<00:00:27.900> getting<00:00:28.400> we<00:00:29.400> can

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
clearer here what you're getting we can

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.490 
clearer here what you're getting we can
see<00:00:29.820> we're<00:00:30.000> getting<00:00:30.060> a<00:00:30.210> full<00:00:30.480> HD<00:00:30.660> panel<00:00:31.199> with

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
see we're getting a full HD panel with

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.819 
see we're getting a full HD panel with
this<00:00:31.710> particular<00:00:32.180> variant<00:00:33.180> as<00:00:33.420> well<00:00:34.410> as<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.559> 4

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
this particular variant as well as the 4

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.430 
this particular variant as well as the 4
gigs<00:00:35.130> of<00:00:35.309> ram<00:00:35.640> so<00:00:36.059> multitasking<00:00:37.020> should<00:00:37.260> be

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
gigs of ram so multitasking should be

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.069 
gigs of ram so multitasking should be
quite<00:00:38.280> immense<00:00:38.640> really<00:00:39.270> I<00:00:39.510> don't<00:00:39.690> think

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
quite immense really I don't think

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.610 
quite immense really I don't think
there's<00:00:40.290> any<00:00:40.410> other<00:00:40.530> 4<00:00:41.010> gig<00:00:41.390> ram<00:00:42.390> devices<00:00:43.350> on

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
there's any other 4 gig ram devices on

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.630 
there's any other 4 gig ram devices on
the<00:00:43.860> market<00:00:44.989> so<00:00:45.989> we<00:00:46.020> can<00:00:46.350> just<00:00:46.649> get<00:00:46.860> open<00:00:47.309> here

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
the market so we can just get open here

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.200 
the market so we can just get open here
and<00:00:48.510> see<00:00:49.260> if<00:00:50.100> we<00:00:50.399> can<00:00:50.579> see<00:00:50.760> any<00:00:50.910> other

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
and see if we can see any other

00:00:51.210 --> 00:01:03.680 
and see if we can see any other
differences<00:00:51.899> I<00:01:00.980> have<00:01:01.980> to<00:01:02.280> say<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.850> 2<00:01:03.090> gig<00:01:03.420> Ram

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
differences I have to say the 2 gig Ram

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.090 
differences I have to say the 2 gig Ram
model<00:01:04.470> gives<00:01:05.100> very<00:01:05.400> good<00:01:05.640> performance<00:01:06.060> I<00:01:07.100> was

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
model gives very good performance I was

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.890 
model gives very good performance I was
very<00:01:08.280> interested<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:09.000> see<00:01:09.180> if<00:01:09.299> we<00:01:09.420> can<00:01:09.570> see<00:01:09.780> any

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
very interested to see if we can see any

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.929 
very interested to see if we can see any
major<00:01:10.229> gains<00:01:10.979> in<00:01:11.250> terms<00:01:11.549> of<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.760> performance

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
major gains in terms of the performance

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:19.969 
major gains in terms of the performance
here<00:01:12.750> with<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.979> 4<00:01:14.640> gig<00:01:14.939> one<00:01:17.030> and<00:01:18.650> also<00:01:19.650> as<00:01:19.830> you

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
here with the 4 gig one and also as you

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.880 
here with the 4 gig one and also as you
can<00:01:20.009> see<00:01:20.220> this<00:01:20.970> is<00:01:21.299> a<00:01:21.740> slightly<00:01:22.740> different

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
can see this is a slightly different

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.819 
can see this is a slightly different
color<00:01:23.490> now<00:01:23.990> so<00:01:24.990> we<00:01:25.710> can<00:01:26.009> just<00:01:27.409> already<00:01:28.409> seen

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
color now so we can just already seen

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.740 
color now so we can just already seen
what's<00:01:29.070> in<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.369> box<00:01:29.640> I<00:01:29.939> think<00:01:30.240> with<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.720> last

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
what's in the box I think with the last

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.819 
what's in the box I think with the last
one<00:01:31.259> but<00:01:31.680> in<00:01:32.430> case<00:01:32.840> you<00:01:33.840> forgot<00:01:34.290> or<00:01:34.500> are

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
one but in case you forgot or are

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.670 
one but in case you forgot or are
curious<00:01:35.630> pretty<00:01:36.630> much<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:37.110> same<00:01:37.290> kind<00:01:37.530> of

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
curious pretty much the same kind of

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.560 
curious pretty much the same kind of
thing<00:01:37.890> here<00:01:38.250> so<00:01:38.700> you're<00:01:38.820> getting<00:01:39.000> your<00:01:39.030> manual

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
thing here so you're getting your manual

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.950 
thing here so you're getting your manual
a<00:01:40.070> new<00:01:41.070> charger<00:01:41.790> as<00:01:41.970> well<00:01:42.329> as<00:01:42.390> your<00:01:42.479> charging

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
a new charger as well as your charging

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.620 
a new charger as well as your charging
cable<00:01:43.200> no<00:01:44.159> headphones<00:01:44.460> though<00:01:45.149> which<00:01:45.600> is

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
cable no headphones though which is

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.440 
cable no headphones though which is
quite<00:01:46.049> weird<00:01:46.350> for<00:01:47.130> saying<00:01:47.399> that<00:01:47.610> you<00:01:48.270> know

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
quite weird for saying that you know

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.530 
quite weird for saying that you know
these<00:01:49.439> are<00:01:49.770> a<00:01:50.070> bit<00:01:50.430> more<00:01:50.579> expensive<00:01:50.729> than<00:01:51.360> the

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
these are a bit more expensive than the

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.870 
these are a bit more expensive than the
2<00:01:52.229> gig<00:01:52.560> RAM<00:01:52.829> model<00:01:53.810> so<00:01:54.810> we<00:01:55.460> can<00:01:56.460> just<00:01:56.640> have<00:01:56.850> a

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
2 gig RAM model so we can just have a

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.569 
2 gig RAM model so we can just have a
look<00:01:57.090> here<00:01:57.829> what<00:01:58.829> we're<00:01:58.979> getting<00:01:59.840> so<00:02:00.840> where

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:01.579 
look here what we're getting so where

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:05.039 
look here what we're getting so where
you<00:02:02.579> can<00:02:02.610> see

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:05.049 
you can see

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:08.729 
you can see
Wow<00:02:06.460> this<00:02:07.090> feels<00:02:07.420> very<00:02:07.509> nice<00:02:07.929> high<00:02:08.679> quality

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:08.739 
Wow this feels very nice high quality

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:16.410 
Wow this feels very nice high quality
here<00:02:13.830> so<00:02:14.830> it's<00:02:15.010> the<00:02:15.040> same<00:02:15.340> dimensions<00:02:16.180> as

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
here so it's the same dimensions as

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:22.650 
here so it's the same dimensions as
before<00:02:16.959> and<00:02:20.489> obviously<00:02:21.489> we<00:02:21.670> have<00:02:21.910> a<00:02:21.940> very<00:02:22.209> nice

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
before and obviously we have a very nice

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:28.680 
before and obviously we have a very nice
brushed<00:02:23.580> appearance<00:02:24.580> here<00:02:25.709> which<00:02:26.709> is<00:02:27.690> feels

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
brushed appearance here which is feels

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.860 
brushed appearance here which is feels
quite<00:02:28.959> solid<00:02:29.260> actually<00:02:29.920> I<00:02:30.129> do<00:02:30.879> think<00:02:31.030> it's<00:02:31.540> a

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
quite solid actually I do think it's a

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.089 
quite solid actually I do think it's a
full<00:02:32.440> metal<00:02:32.879> so<00:02:33.879> not<00:02:34.120> real<00:02:35.110> but<00:02:35.530> it<00:02:35.650> does<00:02:35.830> feel

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099 
full metal so not real but it does feel

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:41.430 
full metal so not real but it does feel
very<00:02:36.160> solid<00:02:36.970> more<00:02:37.750> solid<00:02:38.200> than<00:02:38.470> the<00:02:40.230> g3s

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
very solid more solid than the g3s

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.199 
very solid more solid than the g3s
kind<00:02:42.010> of<00:02:42.190> fall<00:02:42.489> metal<00:02:42.970> if<00:02:43.870> I've<00:02:44.140> got<00:02:44.349> that<00:02:44.530> here

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
kind of fall metal if I've got that here

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.199 
kind of fall metal if I've got that here
while<00:02:46.209> you<00:02:46.480> can<00:02:46.720> barely<00:02:47.019> tell<00:02:47.260> them<00:02:47.410> apart<00:02:48.209> but

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
while you can barely tell them apart but

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:54.839 
while you can barely tell them apart but
you<00:02:49.390> can<00:02:49.569> definitely<00:02:49.720> see<00:02:50.110> here<00:02:52.799> the<00:02:53.799> it<00:02:54.549> feels

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:54.849 
you can definitely see here the it feels

00:02:54.849 --> 00:03:00.990 
you can definitely see here the it feels
a<00:02:54.970> lot<00:02:55.120> more<00:02:55.180> premium<00:02:56.049> here<00:02:58.890> so<00:03:00.000> very

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
a lot more premium here so very

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.770 
a lot more premium here so very
interesting<00:03:02.129> indeed<00:03:03.129> and<00:03:03.519> I've<00:03:04.030> also<00:03:04.239> got<00:03:04.420> the

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
interesting indeed and I've also got the

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.530 
interesting indeed and I've also got the
white<00:03:05.019> one<00:03:05.049> here<00:03:05.590> which<00:03:05.739> is<00:03:05.769> a<00:03:05.920> 2gig<00:03:06.430> RAM<00:03:07.239> model

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
white one here which is a 2gig RAM model

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.069 
white one here which is a 2gig RAM model
and<00:03:08.400> we<00:03:09.400> can<00:03:09.579> see<00:03:09.910> we<00:03:10.209> have<00:03:10.239> pretty<00:03:10.870> much<00:03:10.930> the

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:11.079 
and we can see we have pretty much the

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:13.259 
and we can see we have pretty much the
same<00:03:11.350> setup<00:03:11.709> here<00:03:12.160> when<00:03:12.459> it<00:03:12.579> comes<00:03:12.609> to<00:03:13.150> the

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:13.269 
same setup here when it comes to the

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:16.199 
same setup here when it comes to the
camera<00:03:13.780> the<00:03:14.470> back<00:03:14.739> volume<00:03:15.340> buttons<00:03:15.790> as<00:03:16.180> well

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
camera the back volume buttons as well

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:20.069 
camera the back volume buttons as well
as<00:03:16.569> the<00:03:16.900> speak<00:03:17.410> arrangement<00:03:18.370> as<00:03:18.810> well<00:03:19.810> as<00:03:19.930> the

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:20.079 
as the speak arrangement as well as the

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:24.780 
as the speak arrangement as well as the
USB<00:03:20.380> at<00:03:20.709> the<00:03:20.799> bottom<00:03:21.780> so<00:03:23.160> not<00:03:24.160> too<00:03:24.370> much<00:03:24.519> in<00:03:24.700> the

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
USB at the bottom so not too much in the

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.449 
USB at the bottom so not too much in the
way<00:03:24.880> of<00:03:24.910> differences<00:03:25.569> there<00:03:25.870> I<00:03:26.139> think<00:03:27.130> you<00:03:27.250> can

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
way of differences there I think you can

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:29.940 
way of differences there I think you can
get<00:03:27.639> interchangeable<00:03:28.630> back<00:03:28.810> covers<00:03:29.290> here<00:03:29.620> so

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
get interchangeable back covers here so

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:31.800 
get interchangeable back covers here so
if<00:03:30.040> you're<00:03:30.220> not<00:03:30.340> keen<00:03:30.609> on<00:03:30.639> the<00:03:31.030> actual<00:03:31.540> color

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
if you're not keen on the actual color

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.289 
if you're not keen on the actual color
you<00:03:32.769> can<00:03:33.069> always<00:03:33.250> swap<00:03:33.609> it<00:03:33.819> out<00:03:33.970> which<00:03:34.150> is

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299 
you can always swap it out which is

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:36.750 
you can always swap it out which is
pretty<00:03:34.510> cool<00:03:34.840> so<00:03:35.709> let's<00:03:35.739> just<00:03:36.040> get<00:03:36.160> powered<00:03:36.609> on

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
pretty cool so let's just get powered on

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.349 
pretty cool so let's just get powered on
here<00:03:37.120> and<00:03:37.209> see<00:03:38.040> if<00:03:39.040> it<00:03:39.250> boots<00:03:39.940> up<00:03:40.060> a<00:03:40.180> bit

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:40.359 
here and see if it boots up a bit

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:53.030 
here and see if it boots up a bit
quicker

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.050 

and<00:03:54.040> they're<00:03:54.250> still<00:03:54.520> searching<00:03:54.819> for

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
and they're still searching for

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:10.500 
and they're still searching for
incredible

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:18.390 

so<00:04:11.510> we<00:04:11.750> do<00:04:11.930> have<00:04:12.140> some<00:04:12.580> seems<00:04:13.600> Mandarin<00:04:14.600> here

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:27.400 

so<00:04:19.400> we<00:04:19.640> can<00:04:19.970> change<00:04:20.360> this<00:04:20.810> to<00:04:24.130> local<00:04:25.420> and<00:04:26.420> we

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410 
so we can change this to local and we

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:40.390 
so we can change this to local and we
can<00:04:27.650> go<00:04:28.690> forward<00:04:29.690> here<00:04:33.220> both<00:04:34.220> I<00:04:39.130> just<00:04:40.130> type

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 
can go forward here both I just type

00:04:40.400 --> 00:05:19.950 
can go forward here both I just type
this<00:04:40.610> in<00:04:55.780> is<00:04:56.780> a<00:04:57.380> bit<00:04:57.740> of<00:04:57.800> a<00:04:57.860> wobbler<00:04:58.340> this<00:04:58.520> one

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:19.960 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.750 

there<00:05:20.960> we<00:05:21.140> go

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:21.760 
there we go

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.610 
there we go
so<00:05:22.760> let's<00:05:22.940> boost<00:05:23.240> this<00:05:23.510> brightness<00:05:24.080> here<00:05:24.350> this

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:24.620 
so let's boost this brightness here this

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:28.990 
so let's boost this brightness here this
is<00:05:24.770> a<00:05:24.800> full<00:05:25.160> HD<00:05:25.430> panel<00:05:26.210> now<00:05:27.520> which<00:05:28.520> should<00:05:28.550> be

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 
is a full HD panel now which should be

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.720 
is a full HD panel now which should be
quite<00:05:29.150> interesting<00:05:29.930> here<00:05:30.320> to<00:05:31.160> see<00:05:31.370> if<00:05:31.460> we<00:05:31.550> can

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:31.730 
quite interesting here to see if we can

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:37.570 
quite interesting here to see if we can
see<00:05:32.030> any<00:05:32.410> major<00:05:33.410> differences<00:05:34.900> with<00:05:35.900> the<00:05:36.580> 2gig

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:37.580 
see any major differences with the 2gig

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:49.379 
see any major differences with the 2gig
one

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:49.389 

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:52.649 

and<00:05:50.400> it<00:05:51.400> looks<00:05:51.550> like<00:05:51.759> we<00:05:51.879> get<00:05:52.030> different<00:05:52.509> apps

00:05:52.649 --> 00:05:52.659 
and it looks like we get different apps

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:58.980 
and it looks like we get different apps
on<00:05:52.930> this<00:05:53.139> one<00:05:53.409> which<00:05:53.650> is<00:05:53.800> interesting<00:05:57.990> screen

00:05:58.980 --> 00:05:58.990 
on this one which is interesting screen

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:11.320 
on this one which is interesting screen
does<00:05:59.229> look<00:05:59.439> very<00:05:59.710> nice<00:06:00.340> and<00:06:00.400> clear<00:06:01.030> here

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:11.330 

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:14.860 

see<00:06:11.930> if<00:06:12.020> we<00:06:12.139> can<00:06:12.349> see<00:06:13.330> the<00:06:14.330> hardware

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:14.870 
see if we can see the hardware

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:31.959 
see if we can see the hardware
information<00:06:16.300> No

00:06:31.959 --> 00:06:31.969 

00:06:31.969 --> 00:06:34.549 

definitely<00:06:32.969> looks<00:06:33.449> a<00:06:33.599> little<00:06:33.839> bit<00:06:33.960> snappier

00:06:34.549 --> 00:06:34.559 
definitely looks a little bit snappier

00:06:34.559 --> 00:06:35.179 
definitely looks a little bit snappier
here

00:06:35.179 --> 00:06:35.189 
here

00:06:35.189 --> 00:06:39.040 
here
I<00:06:35.219> think<00:06:35.849> the<00:06:36.029> processor<00:06:36.689> is<00:06:36.809> also<00:06:37.199> better

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:39.050 
I think the processor is also better

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:43.399 
I think the processor is also better
still<00:06:40.050> the<00:06:40.229> Intel<00:06:40.710> one<00:06:41.449> but<00:06:42.449> yeah<00:06:43.169> I'll

00:06:43.399 --> 00:06:43.409 
still the Intel one but yeah I'll

00:06:43.409 --> 00:06:46.040 
still the Intel one but yeah I'll
definitely<00:06:43.619> do<00:06:44.189> some<00:06:44.610> comparisons<00:06:45.389> here<00:06:45.839> with

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:46.050 
definitely do some comparisons here with

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:49.459 
definitely do some comparisons here with
this<00:06:46.849> device<00:06:47.849> to<00:06:48.599> see<00:06:48.839> if<00:06:48.869> it's<00:06:49.199> worthwhile

00:06:49.459 --> 00:06:49.469 
this device to see if it's worthwhile

00:06:49.469 --> 00:06:53.389 
this device to see if it's worthwhile
spending<00:06:49.919> the<00:06:50.309> extra<00:06:50.729> 100<00:06:51.240> on<00:06:51.589> this<00:06:52.589> version

00:06:53.389 --> 00:06:53.399 
spending the extra 100 on this version

00:06:53.399 --> 00:06:56.809 
spending the extra 100 on this version
or<00:06:53.849> not<00:06:54.409> so<00:06:55.409> we're<00:06:55.740> just<00:06:56.009> a<00:06:56.460> quick<00:06:56.669> little

00:06:56.809 --> 00:06:56.819 
or not so we're just a quick little

00:06:56.819 --> 00:06:59.119 
or not so we're just a quick little
video<00:06:56.969> here<00:06:57.569> doing<00:06:57.869> the<00:06:58.020> unboxing<00:06:58.169> of<00:06:58.889> the

00:06:59.119 --> 00:06:59.129 
video here doing the unboxing of the

00:06:59.129 --> 00:07:02.269 
video here doing the unboxing of the
four<00:06:59.460> gig<00:06:59.729> ram<00:07:00.379> zenfone<00:07:01.379> 2<00:07:01.680> hope<00:07:02.009> you<00:07:02.159> did

00:07:02.269 --> 00:07:02.279 
four gig ram zenfone 2 hope you did

00:07:02.279 --> 00:07:04.790 
four gig ram zenfone 2 hope you did
enjoy<00:07:02.369> and<00:07:03.059> if<00:07:03.719> you've<00:07:03.869> got<00:07:03.990> any<00:07:04.050> requests<00:07:04.559> you

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:04.800 
enjoy and if you've got any requests you

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:06.739 
enjoy and if you've got any requests you
send<00:07:05.099> it<00:07:05.249> through<00:07:05.520> and<00:07:05.789> if<00:07:05.849> we've<00:07:05.969> got<00:07:06.119> time<00:07:06.419> I

00:07:06.739 --> 00:07:06.749 
send it through and if we've got time I

00:07:06.749 --> 00:07:09.049 
send it through and if we've got time I
will<00:07:07.439> certainly<00:07:07.740> take<00:07:08.159> a<00:07:08.219> look<00:07:08.490> at<00:07:08.639> it

00:07:09.049 --> 00:07:09.059 
will certainly take a look at it

00:07:09.059 --> 00:07:11.599 
will certainly take a look at it
Cheers
