00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.069
 the story of the juice series began at 9 years ago 

00:00:22.069 --> 00:00:24.159
 when studio sweater is online she 

00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:26.619
 released on the train and decide 2 tactical 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:28.119
 third person shooter 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:30.369
 juice juice 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:32.649
 although at first glance the game represented 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:35.489
 an ordinary military action 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:36.970
 special inspiration 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.650
 for her emergency and the platform she was 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:41.820
 under the present forecast 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.390
 so juice she supported 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.140
 voice commands and on the box among 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.840
 other badges and logos 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.060
 flaunted the city online 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.270
 Perhaps network multiplayer and was 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:54.810
 the main chip of fur seals 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:57.010
 recall that it was on the console 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.340
 which is up to a certain 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.500
 the moment did not even have a connector insulator 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.700
 mention luxury 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.700
 prolongs its model 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.840
 in less than a decade in the world 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.270
 much has changed 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.010
 console multiplayer committed 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.410
 umbrellas and turned into familiar elements 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:16.150
 industrial landscape 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.770
 networking technology has penetrated everywhere 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.980
 so soon even the coffee makers will 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:22.420
 entertain us somehow 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.259
 multiplayer game 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:27.430
 while we wait for a sotra cup of fresh cappuccino 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.090
 and the juice would keep going 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.920
 at some point, publishers apparently 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.820
 understand that in the forehead and advertise 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.780
 balloons when everything is flying for a long time 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.440
 airliners and began to come up as if 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.230
 so change the game so that consumers it 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:44.359
 seemed the most fresh greens 

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:47.359
 some fans 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.150
 first thing equally high added 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.900
 Already the trouble is that he seeps through 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.700
 gyrus as described without leaving after 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.460
 yourself they are wednesday 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.340
 what kind of special adria will your leave on base with 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.950
 rebel group however 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.829
 and I'm at the very beginning one of the characters 

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:08.560
 calls the absences of peasants with trunks 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.879
 but pretty quickly it turns out that 

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:12.720
 rebel grain-growers 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.390
 besides rifles there is still talk to 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:16.669
 shevka technique 

00:02:16.669 --> 00:02:18.949
 at a certain point you start seriously 

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:21.669
 wait what the peasants are now and how 

00:02:21.669 --> 00:02:23.899
 something orbital lazar hot 

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:24.739
 for what 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:27.049
 tanks they have from somewhere 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:29.809
 New kudato run something you are looking for 

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:31.989
 defend a warship 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:34.349
 examine the place of the fall of some kind 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:37.139
 the plane and you yourself can not understand why 

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:38.989
 all this mess should you 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:39.999
 to attend to 

00:02:39.999 --> 00:02:42.449
 no character gets stuck in your head 

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:44.859
 no scene is remembered any longer 

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:46.219
 than two minutes 

00:02:46.219 --> 00:02:47.649
 everything is written in the worst traditions 

00:02:47.649 --> 00:02:50.189
 modern and generic action movies 

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:51.099
 a hole 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:53.319
 even large-scale plot scenes on 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:55.049
 checking is not so 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:57.859
 scale 

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:00.729
 on the day of the astastov plan os x represents from 

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:02.719
 self textbook tactical shooter 

00:03:02.719 --> 00:03:04.399
 console version 

00:03:04.399 --> 00:03:06.319
 all tact lies in 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:07.959
 ability to manage a squad 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:10.359
 divided into two pairs of soldiers 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:12.169
 commanded by the way convenient 

00:03:12.169 --> 00:03:14.479
 while about each deuce assigned 

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:16.609
 however, Conakry is aging 

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:19.059
 give the order not only to move forward 

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:21.739
 a certain position but let's say in advance 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:23.929
 set goals to synchronously open 

00:03:23.929 --> 00:03:25.279
 signal fire 

00:03:25.279 --> 00:03:27.539
 very useful if you like sitting in 

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:30.549
 ambush 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:32.650
 from another country and at times being created 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.879
 feeling like you would do fine 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:36.899
 and without four helpers 

00:03:36.899 --> 00:03:38.849
 your enemies are aggressive and not 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:40.819
 hesitate to manage the strap 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:43.579
 but in principle, special intelligence does not shine 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:44.930
 sometimes they forget that 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:46.349
 olympic allowed 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:48.219
 command so weak 

00:03:48.219 --> 00:03:51.219
 demand this opportunity 

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:55.219
 at times the usual gameplay interrupts 

00:03:55.219 --> 00:03:56.639
 took place missions 

00:03:56.639 --> 00:03:58.119
 in which you play the role 

00:03:58.119 --> 00:04:00.219
 South Korean guaranteed in 

00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:02.199
 difference from 45g 

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:04.819
 here you have no command 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:07.059
 but there is a rifle Svd muffler and 

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:09.870
 Cochin attendant set conventions 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.090
 kind of indicator of visibility and 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:13.680
 needing to hide on 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.680
 made during the mission by the troupe 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.970
 so that they do not catch the eye of the patrol 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.209
 after the very first alarm you between 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:22.509
 others are killed after which every time 

00:04:22.509 --> 00:04:23.810
 have to replay 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:25.830
 quite a long episode because 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.100
 save points 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.100
 left a shame niche issue 

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:35.029
 but as for multiplayer, we all 

00:04:35.029 --> 00:04:36.699
 already said at the beginning 

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:38.580
 what nine years ago seemed 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.669
 revelation is now something by itself 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:42.240
 for granted 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.729
 those who played nokia c3 are interested 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:47.319
 multiplayer jester orvi already seen 

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:50.020
 scale battles mate so juice 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.220
 hurried force with 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.080
 and in this sense hardly people
