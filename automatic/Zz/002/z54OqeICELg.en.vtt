and<00:02:34.560> stuff<00:02:34.830> like<00:02:34.980> that<00:02:35.040> so<00:02:35.690> that<00:02:36.690> kind<00:02:37.050> of

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
and stuff like that so that kind of

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.530 
and stuff like that so that kind of
didn't<00:02:37.650> happen<00:02:38.010> and<00:02:38.250> then<00:02:38.820> am<00:02:39.150> I<00:02:39.270> going<00:02:39.450> to

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
didn't happen and then am I going to

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.200 
didn't happen and then am I going to
redo<00:02:39.900> it<00:02:39.930> I<00:02:40.230> don't<00:02:40.500> know<00:02:40.590> at<00:02:41.520> first<00:02:41.790> I<00:02:41.970> was<00:02:42.150> like

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
redo it I don't know at first I was like

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:43.790 
redo it I don't know at first I was like
yes<00:02:42.420> I<00:02:42.600> was<00:02:42.810> but<00:02:43.080> now<00:02:43.230> I'm<00:02:43.350> kind<00:02:43.530> of<00:02:43.650> thinking

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
yes I was but now I'm kind of thinking

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.980 
yes I was but now I'm kind of thinking
maybe<00:02:44.220> not<00:02:44.490> just<00:02:44.910> because<00:02:45.060> it<00:02:45.480> really<00:02:45.690> took<00:02:45.870> a

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
maybe not just because it really took a

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.450 
maybe not just because it really took a
toll<00:02:46.020> on<00:02:46.200> my<00:02:46.380> skin<00:02:46.710> and<00:02:46.860> I<00:02:46.950> wasn't<00:02:47.130> feeling

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
toll on my skin and I wasn't feeling

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.210 
toll on my skin and I wasn't feeling
very<00:02:47.640> good<00:02:48.030> like<00:02:48.270> when<00:02:48.840> you<00:02:48.930> eat<00:02:49.140> bad<00:02:49.740> food<00:02:49.770> and

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
very good like when you eat bad food and

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.620 
very good like when you eat bad food and
when<00:02:50.310> you<00:02:50.400> don't<00:02:50.610> drink<00:02:50.910> water<00:02:51.150> like<00:02:51.450> your

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
when you don't drink water like your

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.520 
when you don't drink water like your
