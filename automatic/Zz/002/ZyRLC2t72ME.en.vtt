00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.879
 the virtual world but the danger is real and 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:10.130
 good book 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.130
 joinville everything soon after the environment 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.050
 recently recorded a talking video 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.599
 about meeting I had thanks for 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.160
 all pick up on file with china jeans 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.619
 who is well known for writing the 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.510
 saga my choice at least last 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.329
 chance to get a new book from him. 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.340
 The game is infinite and to check this 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.110
 interview you can stay here while 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.550
 I make this move that will have a 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.190
 thing you click 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.110
 As I said in this interview video, you have 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.390
 a fascination and nine by stories that 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.920
 if they happen in a virtual reality I 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.750
 I know you have some examples like 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.550
 player number 1 that has already been criticized 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.100
 previously and also a series 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:00.600
 Japanese call dot net that encompasses 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:04.019
 encompasses that who lomba mangas 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.030
 anime books games played and a lot of 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.159
 other things and is by far the best 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.299
 thing that I have already experienced in terms of 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.010
 virtual reality 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.869
 many of these stories that involve 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.090
 virtual reality premise ends 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.820
 falling into issues such as dependence on 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.170
 humans with machines the escapism that is 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.890
 You'd rather live a reality. 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.470
 virtual versus the real and so on 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.659
 and an infinite does not escape this premise 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.780
 however much it gets super second 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.250
 plan against the madness that is native to 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.130
 book folks accompany michael in one 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.799
 adventure on the third person radio and the 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.450
 virtual world there is called fortinet and the 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.280
 players play in the following way they 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.740
 they enter a coffin that is nothing more than 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.619
 that a dry air box is asleep and the 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.210
 body is turned off and the mind raised to 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.909
 this reality of the palm trees can make 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.250
 of everything and everything is recorded by the 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.920
 coffin and give stimuli to the body 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:02:02.240
 then they do center be 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:04.250
 pleasure pain food and read they have notion 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.200
 with the body is basically quality of the 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.399
 current situation but also a reality almost 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.739
 real 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:11.599
 the book use and abuse of jesus invented 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:14.630
 as the author himself 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:18.230
 coffin things like wake sound of 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.849
 immersion emer are tangents are words 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.470
 that appear in the narrative world that 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:23.480
 may cause a certain strangeness in the 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.310
 start but after the player is 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.220
 The player is not accustomed to being 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.290
 accustomed to air-conditioned is the 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.840
 normal and even helps the reader to 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:36.200
 Best essence the story and the world 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.060
 leave and is threatened by something 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.489
 called the doctrine of death, which is also the 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:43.280
 name adopted knowing it here will be a 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:45.920
 technology to several players entering 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.780
 in a state of brain death and everything 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.660
 must to actions of a player also 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:53.120
 cyber terrorist called key 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.730
 and where most of them my friends are 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.890
 super - versed in what is without code 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.349
 of the game in virtual reality are 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.420
 called by the security agency that 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:04.280
 take care of the website for me 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.380
 arrive this case and for the whole time 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.720
 I wondered why the hell this life of 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.920
 would rely on children and 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.380
 teenagers 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.269
 To investigate something that is so serious. 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.500
 the characters in question to 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:18.230
 respect but has come to the conclusion 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.120
 that's because they know a game 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.380
 better than anyone else 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.049
 so players not 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.579
 But administrators, but not better. 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:29.000
 knows the game with its programmers 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:31.430
 I did so objectively type 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.040
 because they do not hire more senators 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.829
 until ray a matter of days why to do 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.319
 put teaching where teens 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:40.340
 players and this has had an impact 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:43.519
 superactive nor a matter of mere 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:45.400
 similarity and this issue was 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:47.989
 explained when he had an average 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:51.560
 revelation at the end of the book only that 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:54.650
 revelation makes the slightest sense 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:56.630
 It's hard to stay with you like this because 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.519
 it does not make so much sense without the stories 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:00.590
 but suffice it to say that along the 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:02.420
 their narrative of china will give clues 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.160
 of what this relationship can be but only 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.300
 has prevented it from reaching this 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.280
 obvious conclusion he 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:10.200
 dreams information information coming 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.060
 asking we come to this conclusion 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.580
 because it makes this conclusion a 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:17.010
 thing totally is that it does not make sense 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:20.040
 that once you have this information 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.750
 what's being said in the end you speak 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.400
 but this is a big lie because 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.780
 You told me before you did not 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.850
 could not happen 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.130
 it makes sense knows where a person is 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:31.080
 specialized in check the facts and read the 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.910
 book and see everything that is being said in 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.160
 end of day 17 and talk look I think is the 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:37.140
 next in the end for you do this 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.400
 relation to not making sense because 

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:40.950
 this goes against the information you 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.260
 gave it before he does not remember you change 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:47.010
 information but do not destroy 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:48.930
 happened then i stayed like this the best 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:50.760
 example I can give in this case 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:53.010
 of the son of the wife of a son director 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.870
 of the ritual that has a specific series 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:57.360
 in which the percy jackson is there all 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:59.040
 and will enter a place where he does not 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.750
 Can you stop but not anyway? 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.070
 can have guns can not betray the 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:04.500
 state can not be supporting can 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:06.570
 enter any type of weapon that anyone 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.460
 with it will suffer severe consequences 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:10.530
 and the next week you have a 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:13.400
 character inside with the dagger 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:16.650
 doing things a dagger cohen siaca de 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:18.660
 suffering suffered at most games are super 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:21.450
 poorly constructed and meaningless 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:23.580
 these character actions are in the 

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:25.200
 book of temptation and so many dangers 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.990
 updated and a character doing 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:30.330
 jokes and raising questions 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.980
 in the midst of a battle of 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.930
 one thing they can either be 

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:35.220
 mainly talk after a friend 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:37.110
 them away in a horrible way 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:38.910
 same as digitally but let's remember 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:40.470
 that the selection feeling that it is 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:42.900
 happening then if you suffer a 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:45.030
 show the game book did you feel this 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:48.480
 horrible death they forget about it two 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:51.030
 seconds later, coherence people and 

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:52.050
 world is very badly harnessed 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:54.660
 today we are talking about a 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:56.310
 virtual reality there are no limits 

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:59.250
 the author 's imagination and can do 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:59.860
 basically what you want but if not with 

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:01.449
 all this 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:02.889
 the disposition of Zetti failed 

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:05.530
 creating a tokyo city became more 

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:08.590
 boring than the bag there those numbers 

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:11.379
 then present an example that I can 

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:14.469
 give it to you from an author who knew 

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:16.780
 use the opportunity reality reality 

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:18.340
 virtual and create an amazing person was 

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:20.860
 the year but of course the player was a 

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:23.139
 Seriously the matter of zeal looks I went with 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:26.139
 much thirst for the pot of the virtual network of 

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:30.159
 Age and I ended up passing cb the game 

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:32.439
 infinite will take two toninho the two 

00:06:30.159 --> 00:06:34.120
 nephews and a desire that in the 

00:06:32.439 --> 00:06:35.469
 Proceedings can catch them think 

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:38.889
 this idea is to take something really 

00:06:35.469 --> 00:06:40.870
 athletic because for now the country is 

00:06:38.889 --> 00:06:42.969
 that people the old partner can already 

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:44.500
 Start cursing me down here. 

00:06:42.969 --> 00:06:46.389
