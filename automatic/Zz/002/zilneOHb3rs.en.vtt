00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.969

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.289
 downstairs that starts 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:23.429
 I have the heart that speaks 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.439
 actually boom was born about a year ago 

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:28.169
 year 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:32.239
 it's a title that's already its first 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:34.559
 titles that I did on the album and is 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:37.290
 in fact I did with gary fico and 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.339
 from alvin we did a lot of 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.199
 the album in short we just finished 

00:00:38.339 --> 00:00:42.239
 the album yesterday so 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:43.920
 so we're happy it's a bit 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.809
 title track of the rest of the album 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.010
 it's the first one we've done and it's 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.149
 the first we said that one and 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.049
 enter the album it's safe and certain 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:59.089
 and here is a story about 

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:59.089
 a month a little a little fallen but now 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.860
 that thinks 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.880
 no 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.990
 well what we see in the clip 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:15.010
 it's a bit of a story 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.230
 who has already arrived I am sure 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:20.010
 a lot of people that already happened to me it's 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:23.800
 in fact the story is a young man 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:28.450
 who who ends up going out with a 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:33.520
 young girl and it goes bad but 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:35.860
 it's her fault she's actually there 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.450
 finishes the time passes etc 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.610
 they end up crossing each other in a 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.810
 boxing fight we wanted to 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.750
 wanted to put some boxing for 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.850
 make the thing a little bit more 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.130
 urban and enjoy everything that is 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.840
 beautiful mouzoun to make small 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.780
 effects there really is a real 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.390
 metaphor between the box part and is the 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:58.440
 part love relationships and I think 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.440
 that he is quite successful 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.700
 17 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.729
 in fact I will deliver more and more 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.619
 sure on this album is growing 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.070
 in my career I begin to discover 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.660
 my identity enormously this from the 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:18.030
 2nd 3rd album that you really find 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.070
 your music is what you like to do and 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.320
 I really felt on this album my 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.610
 first French album that I have 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.310
 really found what I like to do and 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:29.430
 this mix of tomorrow french culture 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.480
 Portuguese with the culture us which is 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.670
 who represents me a lot 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.310
 so that's why there are 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.440
 leaks with with dogg snoop with wiz 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.100
 Khalifa 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:41.760
 it's the people I like 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:43.920
 a lot so there really is this mixture 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.350
 of cultures and I even think that in 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.510
 the clips in the musical tone 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.540
 we can find this is the mix of 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:57.710
 the French variety of the end 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:57.710
 Portuguese and hip hop us 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:03.880
 I play 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:06.930
 I was just faking fear 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.930
 Savard is born
