and a little bit of fun texture because

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.380 
and a little bit of fun texture because
he's<00:01:33.320> young<00:01:33.650> so<00:01:34.010> it's<00:01:34.160> like<00:01:34.310> a<00:01:34.390> perfect

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390

celebration<00:01:35.600> but<00:01:36.530> we<00:01:36.650> actually<00:01:36.830> removed<00:01:37.460> a

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
celebration but we actually removed a

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.580 
celebration but we actually removed a
lot<00:01:37.910> of<00:01:38.090> hair<00:01:38.270> from<00:01:38.480> him<00:01:38.750> and<00:01:38.930> all<00:01:39.440> the

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
lot of hair from him and all the

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.680 
lot of hair from him and all the
heaviness<00:01:39.920> was<00:01:40.430> laying<00:01:40.730> here<00:01:40.910> and<00:01:41.300> it<00:01:41.540> was

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.690 
heaviness was laying here and it was

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:44.170 
heaviness was laying here and it was
really<00:01:41.960> flat<00:01:42.380> so<00:01:42.650> there<00:01:42.800> was<00:01:42.950> nothing<00:01:43.460> that<00:01:43.700> he

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
really flat so there was nothing that he

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.330 
really flat so there was nothing that he
could<00:01:44.360> do<00:01:44.540> style<00:01:45.020> wise<00:01:45.230> or<00:01:45.500> any<00:01:45.770> product

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
could do style wise or any product

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:47.980 
could do style wise or any product
unless<00:01:46.520> he<00:01:46.790> really<00:01:47.030> gunked<00:01:47.450> it<00:01:47.600> up<00:01:47.720> which<00:01:47.960> is

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
unless he really gunked it up which is

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.270 
unless he really gunked it up which is
unnecessary<00:01:50.170> we<00:01:51.170> just<00:01:51.380> removed<00:01:51.710> a<00:01:51.800> lot<00:01:51.980> and<00:01:52.220> it

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
unnecessary we just removed a lot and it

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.830 
unnecessary we just removed a lot and it
was<00:01:52.430> very<00:01:52.580> much<00:01:52.880> geared<00:01:53.180> towards<00:01:53.510> his<00:01:53.630> head

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
was very much geared towards his head

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.870 
was very much geared towards his head
shape<00:01:54.110> we<00:01:54.350> wanted<00:01:54.680> to<00:01:54.830> create<00:01:55.400> it<00:01:55.700> more

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
shape we wanted to create it more

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.850 
shape we wanted to create it more
rounded<00:01:56.150> in<00:01:56.600> on<00:01:56.780> the<00:01:56.960> sides<00:01:57.200> and<00:01:57.560> create<00:01:57.830> a

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
rounded in on the sides and create a

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.040 
rounded in on the sides and create a
little<00:01:58.100> bit<00:01:58.190> more<00:01:58.310> height<00:01:58.700> up<00:01:58.880> on<00:01:59.060> top<00:01:59.300> and<00:01:59.630> it

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.050 
little bit more height up on top and it

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.940 
little bit more height up on top and it
totally<00:02:00.740> opened<00:02:01.340> and<00:02:01.580> broadened<00:02:02.120> his<00:02:02.240> face

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
totally opened and broadened his face

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.500 
totally opened and broadened his face
and<00:02:03.950> this<00:02:04.070> will<00:02:04.220> grow<00:02:04.400> in<00:02:04.580> really<00:02:05.030> great<00:02:05.270> -

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:05.510 
and this will grow in really great -

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.570 
and this will grow in really great -
it'll<00:02:05.810> have<00:02:05.960> some<00:02:06.200> long<00:02:06.470> lots<00:02:07.040> of<00:02:07.190> different

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
it'll have some long lots of different

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.390 
it'll have some long lots of different
textures<00:02:07.940> in<00:02:08.240> it
