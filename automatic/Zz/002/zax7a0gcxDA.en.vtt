00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.450
 even professionals are wrong 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.490

 for the distribution of anabolic steroids and 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.140
 steroid relevant law was 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.000
 adopted last year a list of 80 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.890
 drugs hit first of all so 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.350
 called anabolic steroids this 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.000
 drugs for rapid increase 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.920
 muscle under the new law, these 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.590
 drugs are now equated to drugs 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.350

 drugs in the last 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.230
 for example tranquilizers but the punishment for 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.299
 their storage of use is essential 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.519
 spread the most that neither is 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:47.130

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:48.600
 plus not limited monetary penalty in 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.370
 present moment steroids can 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.380
 purchase in Brittany by prescription only 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.510

 mail order medications due 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.980
 boundaries but it's at risk 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:01.620
 buyer since besides what it is 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.360
 illegal it is also life threatening 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.370
 since the ban as experts say 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.900
 provoked a surge in production 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.329
 clandestine laboratories which 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.430
 prey on addictions of athletes and 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:13.440
 just people who sat down on these 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:16.500
 miracle preparations 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.900
 force the red pill and you Schwarzenegger

 a completely different life make a movie 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.870
 I take part in the show even though the governor 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:27.030
 california become many of the time 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.590

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.110
 cooler than schwarzenegger 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.180
 it didnâ€™t bring them much success 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.340

 it seemed that someone has good health 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.400
 any training is stimulation rubai 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.620
 any stimulation requires additional 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.980
 that's all you need to fear 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.960
 these amino acid protein vitamins 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:57.420

 norm of drugs at different in general 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:12.240
 unknown together such a correct scheme 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:14.640
 use of food additives to not 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:16.489
 cause no damage to health 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:19.049
