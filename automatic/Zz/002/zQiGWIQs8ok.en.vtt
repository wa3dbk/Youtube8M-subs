here on a chevrolet pickup now its
diesel<00:00:11.470> power<00:00:11.830> so<00:00:12.160> what<00:00:12.340> we<00:00:12.460> want<00:00:12.639> to<00:00:12.700> do<00:00:12.880> we're

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:13.630 
diesel power so what we want to do we're

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:15.240 
diesel power so what we want to do we're
increasing<00:00:14.170> the<00:00:14.259> horsepower<00:00:14.679> on<00:00:14.920> it<00:00:15.040> but<00:00:15.160> the

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:15.250 
increasing the horsepower on it but the

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:16.830 
increasing the horsepower on it but the
first<00:00:15.400> thing<00:00:15.610> we've<00:00:15.820> done<00:00:15.849> is<00:00:16.059> go<00:00:16.390> ahead<00:00:16.509> and

first thing we've done is go ahead and
put<00:00:17.080> an<00:00:17.230> exhaust<00:00:17.619> brake<00:00:17.950> on<00:00:18.220> it<00:00:18.340> and<00:00:18.490> it<00:00:18.820> really

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:19.090 
put an exhaust brake on it and it really

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:21.540 
put an exhaust brake on it and it really
fits<00:00:19.390> in<00:00:19.539> here<00:00:19.570> very<00:00:19.900> nicely<00:00:20.170> it<00:00:20.710> does<00:00:20.949> bolts

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:21.550 
fits in here very nicely it does bolts

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.340 
fits in here very nicely it does bolts
right<00:00:21.670> up<00:00:21.880> nice<00:00:22.090> now<00:00:22.660> in<00:00:22.810> this<00:00:22.900> little<00:00:23.170> adapter

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:23.350 
right up nice now in this little adapter

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:25.980 
right up nice now in this little adapter
that<00:00:23.680> goes<00:00:23.740> to<00:00:24.189> make<00:00:24.400> the<00:00:24.810> intermediate<00:00:25.810> pipe

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:25.990 
that goes to make the intermediate pipe

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.529 
that goes to make the intermediate pipe
to<00:00:26.170> the<00:00:26.260> back<00:00:26.439> of<00:00:26.650> the<00:00:26.740> brake<00:00:27.130> is<00:00:28.119> a<00:00:28.180> clamp

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:28.539 
to the back of the brake is a clamp

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:30.420 
to the back of the brake is a clamp
supplied<00:00:28.960> and<00:00:29.349> the<00:00:29.650> clamp<00:00:29.859> will<00:00:30.010> work<00:00:30.130> fine<00:00:30.400> in

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:30.430 
supplied and the clamp will work fine in

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.369 
supplied and the clamp will work fine in
fact<00:00:30.820> I<00:00:30.970> put<00:00:31.150> it<00:00:31.240> on<00:00:31.330> here<00:00:31.539> but<00:00:31.630> some<00:00:32.080> point<00:00:32.320> I

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:32.379 
fact I put it on here but some point I

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:34.049 
fact I put it on here but some point I
might<00:00:32.590> get<00:00:32.739> real<00:00:32.920> ambitious<00:00:33.430> tear<00:00:33.910> it<00:00:33.940> down

00:00:34.049 --> 00:00:34.059 
might get real ambitious tear it down

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:35.639 
might get real ambitious tear it down
and<00:00:34.239> well<00:00:34.570> that<00:00:34.719> make<00:00:34.870> a<00:00:34.899> little<00:00:35.140> screen<00:00:35.350> a<00:00:35.380> job

00:00:35.639 --> 00:00:35.649 
and well that make a little screen a job

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:38.340 
and well that make a little screen a job
well<00:00:36.579> one<00:00:37.120> thing<00:00:37.300> about<00:00:37.540> this<00:00:37.719> exhaust<00:00:38.140> brake

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.350 
well one thing about this exhaust brake

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:39.569 
well one thing about this exhaust brake
is<00:00:38.530> a<00:00:38.559> little<00:00:38.770> bit<00:00:38.860> different<00:00:39.190> than<00:00:39.280> others

00:00:39.569 --> 00:00:39.579 
is a little bit different than others

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:41.850 
is a little bit different than others
that<00:00:39.730> you<00:00:39.850> might<00:00:40.000> find<00:00:40.239> that<00:00:40.540> this<00:00:41.050> is<00:00:41.260> from<00:00:41.530> BD

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:41.860 
that you might find that this is from BD

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.470 
that you might find that this is from BD
power<00:00:42.100> and<00:00:42.309> what<00:00:42.430> they've<00:00:42.610> done<00:00:42.820> with<00:00:43.030> this<00:00:43.270> is

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:43.480 
power and what they've done with this is

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.630 
power and what they've done with this is
they've<00:00:43.899> got<00:00:44.079> an<00:00:44.230> air<00:00:44.379> cylinder<00:00:44.680> here<00:00:45.219> now

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:45.640 
they've got an air cylinder here now

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.220 
they've got an air cylinder here now
this<00:00:45.760> works<00:00:45.940> off<00:00:46.149> compressed<00:00:46.629> air<00:00:46.870> you<00:00:46.989> got<00:00:47.110> in

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:47.230 
this works off compressed air you got in

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.619 
this works off compressed air you got in
line<00:00:47.469> going<00:00:48.190> up<00:00:48.370> across<00:00:48.789> the<00:00:49.239> top<00:00:49.420> of<00:00:49.450> our

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:49.629 
line going up across the top of our

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:52.110 
line going up across the top of our
truck<00:00:49.930> over<00:00:50.230> here<00:00:50.260> to<00:00:50.649> a<00:00:50.680> solenoid<00:00:51.399> and<00:00:51.640> then

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.120 
truck over here to a solenoid and then

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.670 
truck over here to a solenoid and then
into<00:00:52.480> an<00:00:52.600> air<00:00:52.750> compressor<00:00:52.960> and<00:00:53.320> we<00:00:53.410> got<00:00:53.530> to

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:53.680 
into an air compressor and we got to

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:54.689 
into an air compressor and we got to
mount<00:00:53.860> that<00:00:53.949> in<00:00:54.160> just<00:00:54.250> a<00:00:54.399> minute<00:00:54.579> but

00:00:54.689 --> 00:00:54.699 
mount that in just a minute but

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:56.310 
mount that in just a minute but
something<00:00:55.090> else<00:00:55.239> that<00:00:55.449> they<00:00:55.539> have<00:00:55.750> here<00:00:56.050> if

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.320 
something else that they have here if

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.360 
something else that they have here if
you<00:00:56.440> notice<00:00:56.620> right<00:00:56.860> here<00:00:56.920> there's<00:00:57.309> a

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 
you notice right here there's a

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.670 
you notice right here there's a
stainless<00:00:57.850> steel<00:00:57.879> tube<00:00:58.360> what<00:00:59.020> this<00:00:59.230> does<00:00:59.440> is

00:00:59.670 --> 00:00:59.680 
stainless steel tube what this does is

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.110 
stainless steel tube what this does is
this<00:00:59.710> picks<00:01:00.129> up<00:01:00.309> the<00:01:00.460> exhaust<00:01:00.730> backpressure

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120 
this picks up the exhaust backpressure

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.660 
this picks up the exhaust backpressure
so<00:01:01.690> we<00:01:01.840> can<00:01:01.989> monitor<00:01:02.170> that<00:01:02.649> so<00:01:02.890> you<00:01:03.250> can<00:01:03.399> see

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
so we can monitor that so you can see

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.430 
so we can monitor that so you can see
what's<00:01:03.910> going<00:01:04.000> on<00:01:04.420> but<00:01:04.600> this<00:01:04.780> is<00:01:04.960> a<00:01:04.989> real<00:01:05.259> nice

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.440 
what's going on but this is a real nice

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.410 
what's going on but this is a real nice
insulation<00:01:06.070> but<00:01:06.190> the<00:01:06.280> next<00:01:06.490> step<00:01:06.670> is<00:01:07.180> to<00:01:07.330> go

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
insulation but the next step is to go

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:08.760 
insulation but the next step is to go
ahead<00:01:07.450> and<00:01:07.659> put<00:01:07.780> on<00:01:07.900> our<00:01:08.020> air<00:01:08.080> compressor<00:01:08.530> okay

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
ahead and put on our air compressor okay

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.020 
ahead and put on our air compressor okay
let's<00:01:09.130> clear<00:01:09.340> out<00:01:09.430> some<00:01:09.580> of<00:01:09.670> these<00:01:09.729> tools<00:01:09.939> and

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
let's clear out some of these tools and

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.039 
let's clear out some of these tools and
put<00:01:10.210> this<00:01:10.299> truck<00:01:10.510> down<00:01:12.570> okay<00:01:13.570> now<00:01:13.780> we've<00:01:13.930> got

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:14.049 
put this truck down okay now we've got

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:15.240 
put this truck down okay now we've got
the<00:01:14.170> truck<00:01:14.380> down<00:01:14.560> here<00:01:14.590> on<00:01:14.799> the<00:01:14.830> ground<00:01:14.920> where

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:30.189 
second now here's what we have this is

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:32.249 
second now here's what we have this is
where<00:01:30.670> you<00:01:30.790> hook<00:01:30.970> in<00:01:31.150> the<00:01:31.329> plastic<00:01:31.869> line<00:01:32.049> that

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:32.259 
where you hook in the plastic line that

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:34.590 
where you hook in the plastic line that
goes<00:01:32.290> to<00:01:32.619> our<00:01:32.650> exhaust<00:01:33.220> brake<00:01:33.549> also<00:01:34.390> have<00:01:34.570> a

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
goes to our exhaust brake also have a

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.450 
goes to our exhaust brake also have a
little<00:01:34.840> adjustment<00:01:35.259> valve<00:01:35.650> right<00:01:35.890> here<00:01:35.950> so<00:01:36.340> we

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
little adjustment valve right here so we

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.819 
little adjustment valve right here so we
can<00:01:36.579> adjust<00:01:36.939> the<00:01:37.060> back<00:01:37.240> pressure<00:01:37.540> on<00:01:37.869> here<00:01:38.170> and

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:38.829 
can adjust the back pressure on here and

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:41.130 
can adjust the back pressure on here and
here's<00:01:39.670> the<00:01:39.850> wiring<00:01:40.180> harness<00:01:40.540> comes<00:01:40.689> complete

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
here's the wiring harness comes complete

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.200 
here's the wiring harness comes complete
with<00:01:41.170> an<00:01:41.560> inline<00:01:41.890> fuse<00:01:42.280> all<00:01:42.820> you<00:01:42.939> have<00:01:43.060> to<00:01:43.119> do

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
with an inline fuse all you have to do

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.300 
with an inline fuse all you have to do
is<00:01:43.299> go<00:01:43.420> down<00:01:43.450> here<00:01:43.900> hook<00:01:44.530> this<00:01:44.680> into<00:01:44.740> battery

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
is go down here hook this into battery

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.460 
is go down here hook this into battery
voltage<00:01:45.520> that's<00:01:46.299> where<00:01:46.509> the<00:01:46.659> nut<00:01:46.840> goes<00:01:47.049> BTW

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
voltage that's where the nut goes BTW

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.530 
voltage that's where the nut goes BTW
even<00:01:47.740> supplies<00:01:48.100> that<00:01:48.490> and<00:01:48.970> there's<00:01:49.299> also

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:49.540 
even supplies that and there's also

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.749 
even supplies that and there's also
terminals<00:01:50.170> down<00:01:50.320> here<00:01:50.619> for<00:01:51.070> your<00:01:51.220> ground<00:01:51.460> so

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
we do that one of the things you have to

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.200 
we do that one of the things you have to
do<00:02:05.350> is<00:02:05.710> run<00:02:06.040> your<00:02:06.070> wires<00:02:06.460> down<00:02:06.820> through<00:02:07.119> the

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
do is run your wires down through the

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.240 
do is run your wires down through the
grommet<00:02:07.420> here<00:02:07.810> that<00:02:08.290> goes<00:02:08.500> through<00:02:08.829> for<00:02:09.100> your

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
grommet here that goes through for your

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.910 
grommet here that goes through for your
hood<00:02:09.790> release<00:02:10.119> run<00:02:10.840> those<00:02:11.020> into<00:02:11.349> the<00:02:11.379> cabin

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
hood release run those into the cabin

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.380 
hood release run those into the cabin
and<00:02:11.950> then<00:02:12.550> you're<00:02:12.730> set<00:02:12.910> makes<00:02:13.150> it<00:02:13.270> a<00:02:13.300> lot

and then you're set makes it a lot
easier<00:02:13.450> sure<00:02:14.290> once<00:02:14.530> that's<00:02:14.709> in<00:02:14.860> place<00:02:14.890> you

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
easier sure once that's in place you

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.960 
easier sure once that's in place you
sure<00:02:15.459> can't<00:02:15.700> put<00:02:15.849> the

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
sure can't put the

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.640 
sure can't put the
wires<00:02:16.150> were<00:02:16.420> there<00:02:16.600> this<00:02:17.200> is<00:02:17.320> what<00:02:17.410> I'm<00:02:17.530> going

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
wires were there this is what I'm going

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.380 
wires were there this is what I'm going
to<00:02:17.710> install<00:02:17.950> this<00:02:18.160> is<00:02:18.280> a<00:02:18.310> little<00:02:18.580> tea<00:02:18.760> and

to install this is a little tea and
we'll<00:02:19.540> install<00:02:19.870> this<00:02:20.110> in<00:02:20.320> a<00:02:20.440> manifold<00:02:21.010> line

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
we'll install this in a manifold line

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.040 
we'll install this in a manifold line
that<00:02:21.850> will<00:02:21.940> read<00:02:22.120> manifold<00:02:22.570> pressure<00:02:22.810> that

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
that will read manifold pressure that

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:24.420 
that will read manifold pressure that
way<00:02:23.170> we'll<00:02:23.320> be<00:02:23.350> able<00:02:23.470> to<00:02:23.620> monitor<00:02:24.100> the<00:02:24.220> boost

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
way we'll be able to monitor the boost

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.430 
way we'll be able to monitor the boost
all<00:02:25.360> right<00:02:25.480> don't<00:02:25.630> you<00:02:25.750> take<00:02:25.870> this<00:02:25.960> error<00:02:26.200> air

i got a throttle pedal right here that

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.279 
i got a throttle pedal right here that
you<00:04:46.580> can<00:04:46.729> see<00:04:47.030> because<00:04:47.240> you<00:04:47.630> can't<00:04:47.900> see<00:04:48.110> up

00:04:48.279 --> 00:04:48.289 
you can see because you can't see up

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:50.890 
you can see because you can't see up
under<00:04:48.410> the<00:04:48.770> dash<00:04:48.979> where<00:04:49.220> he<00:04:49.460> is<00:04:49.610> now<00:04:50.539> this<00:04:50.750> is

00:04:59.560 --> 00:04:59.570 
turn it back around here here you can

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:02.500 
turn it back around here here you can
see<00:04:59.630> the<00:05:00.169> microswitch<00:05:00.889> now<00:05:01.130> once<00:05:01.910> it's<00:05:02.120> armed

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:02.510 
see the microswitch now once it's armed

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:04.270 
see the microswitch now once it's armed
and<00:05:02.660> you<00:05:02.750> push<00:05:02.960> down<00:05:02.990> on<00:05:03.169> the<00:05:03.410> throttle<00:05:03.650> that

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.280 
and you push down on the throttle that

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.340 
and you push down on the throttle that
disarms<00:05:04.760> the<00:05:04.970> system<00:05:05.449> momentarily<00:05:05.990> but<00:05:06.199> when

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:06.350 
disarms the system momentarily but when

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:08.920 
disarms the system momentarily but when
you<00:05:06.470> let<00:05:06.650> go<00:05:06.680> of<00:05:06.889> it<00:05:07.160> like<00:05:07.340> that<00:05:07.580> that<00:05:08.479> engages

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:08.930 
you let go of it like that that engages

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.140 
you let go of it like that that engages
your<00:05:09.350> exhaust<00:05:09.889> brake<00:05:10.220> and<00:05:10.490> then<00:05:10.910> you<00:05:11.030> get

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.150 
your exhaust brake and then you get

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.300 
your exhaust brake and then you get
