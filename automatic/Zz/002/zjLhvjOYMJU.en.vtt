he's invincible he can't be shot but at

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.020 
he's invincible he can't be shot but at

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
the same time he can't shoot me so I'm a

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.940 
the same time he can't shoot me so I'm a
little<00:00:45.239> confused<00:00:45.750> okay<00:00:46.649> now<00:00:46.800> I'm<00:00:46.890> gonna

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
little confused okay now I'm gonna

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.709 
little confused okay now I'm gonna
freeze<00:00:47.340> it<00:00:47.520> here<00:00:47.700> because<00:00:47.850> he<00:00:48.120> does<00:00:48.390> actually

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
freeze it here because he does actually

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.910 
freeze it here because he does actually
die<00:00:49.050> now<00:00:49.860> look<00:00:50.660> his<00:00:51.660> own<00:00:51.840> teammate<00:00:52.410> killed<00:00:52.739> him

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
die now look his own teammate killed him

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.180 
die now look his own teammate killed him
I<00:00:53.149> think<00:00:54.149> he<00:00:54.239> was<00:00:54.329> trying<00:00:54.480> to<00:00:54.600> shoot<00:00:54.809> me<00:00:55.190> the

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
I think he was trying to shoot me the

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.569 
I think he was trying to shoot me the
only<00:00:56.520> thing<00:00:56.760> I<00:00:56.879> can<00:00:56.940> think<00:00:57.090> is<00:00:57.739> either<00:00:58.739> well

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
only thing I can think is either well

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.910 
only thing I can think is either well
the<00:00:59.969> obvious<00:01:00.090> one<00:01:00.480> he's<00:01:00.989> cheating<00:01:01.410> but

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
the obvious one he's cheating but

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.939 
the obvious one he's cheating but
secondly<00:01:02.430> I<00:01:02.789> think<00:01:03.390> he<00:01:04.049> may<00:01:04.260> be<00:01:04.290> one<00:01:04.710> of<00:01:04.830> my

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
secondly I think he may be one of my

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.929 
secondly I think he may be one of my
teammates<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:05.820> I<00:01:06.119> couldn't<00:01:06.420> I<00:01:06.659> didn't<00:01:06.900> have

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:07.939 
teammates and I couldn't I didn't have

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:10.520 
teammates and I couldn't I didn't have
the<00:01:08.939> ability<00:01:09.360> to<00:01:09.390> go<00:01:09.570> through<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.140> look<00:01:10.200> at

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
the ability to go through and look at

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.080 
the ability to go through and look at
the<00:01:10.650> video<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.070> see<00:01:11.189> if<00:01:11.250> he<00:01:11.340> was<00:01:11.490> on<00:01:11.580> my<00:01:11.610> team<00:01:11.729> I

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.000 
the video and see if he was on my team I
tried<00:01:12.299> to<00:01:12.390> freeze<00:01:12.570> it<00:01:12.720> a<00:01:12.780> few<00:01:12.930> times<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.830> see<00:01:13.979> if

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
tried to freeze it a few times to see if

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.980
