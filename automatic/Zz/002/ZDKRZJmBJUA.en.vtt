this<00:02:14.010> truck<00:02:14.220> here<00:02:14.400> also<00:02:14.610> has<00:02:15.030> four-wheel

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
this truck here also has four-wheel

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.920 
this truck here also has four-wheel
drive<00:02:16.170> low<00:02:17.090> now<00:02:18.090> to<00:02:18.150> get<00:02:18.420> it<00:02:18.540> in<00:02:18.660> four-wheel

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
drive low now to get it in four-wheel

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.810 
drive low now to get it in four-wheel
drive<00:02:19.320> low<00:02:19.350> you<00:02:19.620> have<00:02:19.830> to<00:02:19.920> have<00:02:20.010> it<00:02:20.130> in<00:02:20.250> neutral

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
drive low you have to have it in neutral

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.790 
drive low you have to have it in neutral
I'm<00:02:20.970> also<00:02:21.240> used<00:02:21.510> to<00:02:21.750> wheel<00:02:21.930> drive<00:02:22.260> but<00:02:22.290> here<00:02:22.740> in

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
I'm also used to wheel drive but here in

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.230 
I'm also used to wheel drive but here in
the<00:02:22.890> wintertime<00:02:23.130> it's<00:02:23.550> pretty<00:02:23.790> bad

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
the wintertime it's pretty bad

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.240 
the wintertime it's pretty bad
so<00:02:24.750> the<00:02:24.900> four-wheel<00:02:25.260> drive<00:02:25.500> does<00:02:25.800> come<00:02:26.100> in

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
so the four-wheel drive does come in

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.610 
so the four-wheel drive does come in
very<00:02:26.490> handy<00:02:26.580> and<00:02:27.120> you<00:02:27.690> can<00:02:27.840> actually<00:02:28.080> shift

make sure that the previous owners or
owner<00:04:56.630> looked<00:04:57.080> after<00:04:57.260> it<00:04:57.650> this<00:04:57.980> one<00:04:58.190> had<00:04:58.340> low

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
owner looked after it this one had low

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.580 
owner looked after it this one had low
kilometers<00:04:59.150> which<00:04:59.420> made<00:04:59.660> it<00:04:59.780> even<00:04:59.900> better

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:00.590 
kilometers which made it even better

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:02.410 
kilometers which made it even better
it<00:05:00.920> had<00:05:01.130> no<00:05:01.340> warranty<00:05:01.730> when<00:05:01.790> I<00:05:01.910> bought<00:05:02.090> it<00:05:02.270> so<00:05:02.390> I

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:02.420 
it had no warranty when I bought it so I

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:04.480 
it had no warranty when I bought it so I
took<00:05:02.630> my<00:05:02.780> chances<00:05:03.290> and<00:05:03.500> it's<00:05:04.010> got<00:05:04.160> lots<00:05:04.370> of

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.490 
took my chances and it's got lots of

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:07.210 
took my chances and it's got lots of
power<00:05:04.670> it's<00:05:05.210> good<00:05:05.480> on<00:05:05.630> gas<00:05:05.930> it's<00:05:06.680> not<00:05:06.890> as<00:05:07.040> good

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:07.220 
power it's good on gas it's not as good

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.000 
power it's good on gas it's not as good
as<00:05:07.340> a<00:05:07.370> car<00:05:07.730> but<00:05:08.270> it's<00:05:08.450> fairly<00:05:08.690> good<00:05:09.020> in<00:05:09.260> town

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.010 
as a car but it's fairly good in town

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:11.500 
as a car but it's fairly good in town
the<00:05:10.190> mileage<00:05:10.550> isn't<00:05:10.910> that<00:05:11.030> good<00:05:11.300> because

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:11.510 
the mileage isn't that good because

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:12.820 
the mileage isn't that good because
you're<00:05:11.660> stopping<00:05:12.110> and<00:05:12.260> going<00:05:12.530> all<00:05:12.650> the<00:05:12.800> time

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:12.830 
you're stopping and going all the time

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:14.860 
you're stopping and going all the time
but<00:05:13.250> on<00:05:13.340> the<00:05:13.460> highway<00:05:13.760> it's<00:05:13.940> really<00:05:14.210> good<00:05:14.390> if

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:14.870 
but on the highway it's really good if

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:16.690 
but on the highway it's really good if
you<00:05:15.020> go<00:05:15.170> to<00:05:15.230> speed<00:05:15.590> limit<00:05:15.890> they<00:05:16.280> are<00:05:16.400> a<00:05:16.430> bit

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:16.700 
you go to speed limit they are a bit

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.430 
you go to speed limit they are a bit
hard<00:05:16.910> to<00:05:16.970> find<00:05:17.330> though<00:05:17.600> I<00:05:17.630> had<00:05:17.780> to<00:05:17.810> look<00:05:18.050> a<00:05:18.230> long

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:18.440 
hard to find though I had to look a long

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.680 
hard to find though I had to look a long
time<00:05:18.740> before<00:05:19.070> I<00:05:19.310> found<00:05:19.550> a<00:05:19.730> small<00:05:20.000> Canyon<00:05:20.540> or

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:20.690 
time before I found a small Canyon or

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:22.990 
time before I found a small Canyon or
Colorado<00:05:21.170> like<00:05:21.470> this<00:05:21.740> every<00:05:22.310> time<00:05:22.490> I<00:05:22.520> go<00:05:22.790> look

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000 
Colorado like this every time I go look

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.760 
Colorado like this every time I go look
at<00:05:23.120> when<00:05:23.300> they'd<00:05:23.450> be<00:05:23.630> sold<00:05:23.930> or<00:05:24.200> they<00:05:24.470> would<00:05:24.650> be

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:24.770 
at when they'd be sold or they would be

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:27.820 
at when they'd be sold or they would be
overpriced<00:05:25.340> and<00:05:26.270> now<00:05:26.630> there's<00:05:26.840> a<00:05:26.900> 2015<00:05:27.440> model

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:27.830 
overpriced and now there's a 2015 model

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:29.890 
overpriced and now there's a 2015 model
of<00:05:28.220> the<00:05:28.370> Colorado<00:05:28.820> and<00:05:29.000> Canyon<00:05:29.360> that<00:05:29.480> has<00:05:29.660> come

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:29.900 
of the Colorado and Canyon that has come

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.570 
of the Colorado and Canyon that has come
out<00:05:29.990> it's<00:05:30.230> completely<00:05:30.800> different<00:05:31.250> than<00:05:31.430> this

little truck to have you might need a
trailer<00:05:42.920> though<00:05:43.100> I<00:05:43.340> use<00:05:43.640> a<00:05:43.670> trailer<00:05:44.180> because

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:44.360 
trailer though I use a trailer because

it's hard to put lawn tractors in the

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:49.090 
it's hard to put lawn tractors in the
box<00:05:46.630> because<00:05:47.630> it's<00:05:47.810> the<00:05:47.960> crew<00:05:48.170> cab<00:05:48.410> the<00:05:48.620> box<00:05:48.830> is

from<00:05:55.700> side<00:05:56.030> to<00:05:56.060> side<00:05:56.240> like<00:05:56.630> this<00:05:56.810> it's<00:05:57.080> about

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:57.200 
from side to side like this it's about

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:01.660

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:12.170 
that is over three feet wide that's why

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:14.770 
that is over three feet wide that's why
I<00:06:12.200> use<00:06:12.410> that<00:06:12.620> trailer<00:06:13.130> over<00:06:13.370> there<00:06:13.600> the<00:06:14.600> main

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:14.780 
I use that trailer over there the main

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:16.660 
I use that trailer over there the main
reason<00:06:15.170> why<00:06:15.350> I<00:06:15.380> bought<00:06:15.590> a<00:06:15.650> smaller<00:06:16.070> truck<00:06:16.460> is

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:16.670 
reason why I bought a smaller truck is

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:18.400 
reason why I bought a smaller truck is
because<00:06:16.970> I'm<00:06:17.120> a<00:06:17.210> caregiver<00:06:17.450> to<00:06:17.720> my<00:06:17.960> wife<00:06:18.170> as

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:18.410 
because I'm a caregiver to my wife as

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:20.440 
because I'm a caregiver to my wife as
many<00:06:18.620> of<00:06:18.740> you<00:06:18.830> guys<00:06:18.980> already<00:06:19.250> know<00:06:19.520> that<00:06:19.550> and<00:06:19.970> I

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:20.450 
many of you guys already know that and I

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:22.000 
many of you guys already know that and I
was<00:06:20.600> going<00:06:20.840> to<00:06:20.960> buy<00:06:21.080> a<00:06:21.110> half-ton<00:06:21.530> truck<00:06:21.740> but

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:22.010 
was going to buy a half-ton truck but

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:23.770 
was going to buy a half-ton truck but
then<00:06:22.130> I<00:06:22.250> realize<00:06:22.610> it<00:06:22.790> might<00:06:22.910> be<00:06:23.090> too<00:06:23.330> hard<00:06:23.540> to

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:23.780 
then I realize it might be too hard to

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:26.140 
then I realize it might be too hard to
lift<00:06:23.960> her<00:06:24.110> into<00:06:24.140> a<00:06:24.650> full-size<00:06:25.370> pickup<00:06:25.670> truck

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:26.150 
lift her into a full-size pickup truck

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:28.120 
lift her into a full-size pickup truck
whereas<00:06:26.960> with<00:06:27.170> this<00:06:27.320> one<00:06:27.530> here<00:06:27.740> it's<00:06:27.830> quite

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:28.130 
whereas with this one here it's quite

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:30.010 
whereas with this one here it's quite
easy<00:06:28.310> to<00:06:28.490> just<00:06:28.880> get<00:06:29.030> her<00:06:29.120> into<00:06:29.450> the<00:06:29.480> seat<00:06:29.840> on

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:30.020 
easy to just get her into the seat on

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:31.870 
easy to just get her into the seat on
the<00:06:30.200> other<00:06:30.350> side<00:06:30.590> but<00:06:31.160> I<00:06:31.220> don't<00:06:31.520> regret<00:06:31.850> my

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:31.880 
the other side but I don't regret my

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.360

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:34.370 
purchase I can go in the bush in places

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:36.340 
purchase I can go in the bush in places
where<00:06:34.490> bigger<00:06:34.760> trucks<00:06:35.120> can<00:06:35.360> go<00:06:35.570> and<00:06:35.780> it<00:06:36.229> will

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:36.350 
where bigger trucks can go and it will

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:37.239 
where bigger trucks can go and it will
be<00:06:36.470> better<00:06:36.650> on<00:06:36.890> fuel

00:06:37.239 --> 00:06:37.249 
be better on fuel

00:06:37.249 --> 00:06:39.609 
be better on fuel
economy<00:06:37.669> as<00:06:37.789> well<00:06:37.969> and<00:06:38.269> I<00:06:38.959> almost<00:06:39.109> forgot<00:06:39.469> to

00:06:39.609 --> 00:06:39.619 
economy as well and I almost forgot to

00:06:39.619 --> 00:06:41.769 
economy as well and I almost forgot to
mention<00:06:39.799> that<00:06:40.069> there<00:06:40.369> is<00:06:40.639> a<00:06:40.849> remote<00:06:41.329> power

00:06:45.369 --> 00:06:45.379 
door lock on the keychain so this will

00:06:45.379 --> 00:06:46.449
