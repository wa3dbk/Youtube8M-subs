00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:13.589
 I got varied tv x 2 traces 

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:16.630
 it differs from the vast majority of drives 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:21.239
 because we can connect 

00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:24.599
 up to both engines at once 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:26.509
 we can connect 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:29.599
 up to 2 batteries 

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:31.460
 both 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.710
 we can make use of a fairly high voltage 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.140
 3d up to 16 as 8 volts 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.409
 It has preprogrammed 

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:44.300
 train game mode 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.910
 that the truth is that they come pretty well 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.020
 I a very very interesting option 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.240
 is to carry 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.240
 the gu protection of the pro 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.960
 dc varied as negative together we can say 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.520
 percent and that Nov 23 does not do anything else that was the problem 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.070
 and you have to solve it by putting 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.700
 another beck one external 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:17.850
 we can say 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.450
 a hundred too 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.460
 that the consumption that occurs 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.080
 to the battery that we connect to the side where we have the sticker 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.270
 It is much older 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.730
 that the battery 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:33.100
 that we connect to the other part precisely because of issues of internal beck 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.810
 if we eliminate sbk consumption in amber 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.920
 percent are equal 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.630
 and also as part of the people let's say negative 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.969
 percent is not to be negative is to clarify 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:53.380
 this varied has no power cut and to say if we put and connect very 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:54.070
 little bit 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.830
 well so that we do not get kissed after volt that is recommended per cell 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.600
 we will have to make use of external material 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.950
 to avoid that drop in voltage to the homeland 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:15.069
 It is worth remembering that the motorhead connect 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:17.289
 he can not exceed the limit 

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:20.289
 d percent and the twelve laps teaching 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.459
 for engines of size 550 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:29.339
 while we are making use of the inner valley 

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:35.219
 it is always good to be first the battery on the side that does not have the 

00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:36.829
 sticker 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:40.489
 and finally the side that has it 

00:02:41.889 --> 00:02:44.889
 the important one that when we 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:47.410
 we want 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:48.729
 to turn off 

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:50.099
 our ally 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:52.819
 let's not do it of the button 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:54.919
 never 

00:02:54.919 --> 00:02:58.009
 always connecting the battery 

00:02:58.009 --> 00:03:01.649
 of the main collector that they carry 

00:03:01.649 --> 00:03:03.979
 the notice on the sticker 

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:06.359
 disconnect 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:07.999
 turns off 

00:03:07.999 --> 00:03:10.499
 i 

00:03:10.499 --> 00:03:13.499
 we no longer have any problem 

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:21.179
 the first thing is to make sure 

00:03:21.179 --> 00:03:24.469
 that the two potentiometer the tormette 

00:03:24.469 --> 00:03:27.889
 that we have from our command are pointing 

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:31.479
 it was 0 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:37.599
 pique side positions 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:39.299
 what we have here 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:42.329
 we have selected the one of fifty 50 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:45.989
 to do tests we will have time now what we are going to do 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:48.989
 see what works correctly 

00:03:50.529 --> 00:03:53.739
 we take out our antenna completely 

00:03:58.029 --> 00:04:01.349
 we light our command 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:05.259
 Then what we will do is understand our inverter 

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:08.849
 and calibrate the position of the trigger 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:10.339
 all right 

00:04:10.339 --> 00:04:14.939
 let's understand and let's keep pressing the button until we see a 

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:17.919
 red light and both they will let go 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:19.090
 we press 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.090
 we expect something red and soldier 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:25.669
 dad once and we accelerate 

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:28.740
 when starting from adobe efe 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.669
 completely reverse gear 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:33.389
 and being green let's go 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:37.000
 also valverde intermittent its meaning that everything is and has 

00:04:36.999 --> 00:04:40.289
 correctly configured 

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:43.469
 if we accelerate I started paying and when we arrived 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.550
 butt 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.969
 light green let go 

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:53.489
 green light will remain on if we start from MazatlÃ¡n it turns off and when 

00:04:53.489 --> 00:04:54.190
 let's get there 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:55.740
 to the top 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.710
 sheen has something to lose 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:58.939
 scout master 

00:04:58.939 --> 00:05:01.939
 and again business we have continuous green light 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.120
 we have already calibrated our neighborhood 

00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:18.919
 I hit the power button and I keep pushing 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.499
 a flicker int released 

00:05:26.499 --> 00:05:30.229
 I already programmed my neighborhood funnel 

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:38.979
 we press the power button 

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:41.979
 warning torroja 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.650
 a blink 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:47.650
 two flickers loose 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:51.000
 and I have already programmed very varied career mode 

00:05:57.309 --> 00:05:59.309
 we press the power button 

00:05:59.309 --> 00:06:02.309
 memo red warning light 

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:06.819
 a blink 

00:06:06.819 --> 00:06:09.180
 for paleo i 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:11.330
 three for Pablo loose 

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:15.420
 and I have already programmed my modem m training mode
