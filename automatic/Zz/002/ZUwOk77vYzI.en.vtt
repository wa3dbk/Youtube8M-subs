sort of a glitch but it's I don't know

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:17.420 
sort of a glitch but it's I don't know
anyway

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
anyway

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.290 
anyway
this<00:00:17.670> glitch<00:00:18.390> last<00:00:18.630> trick<00:00:19.020> will<00:00:20.000> make<00:00:21.000> it<00:00:21.150> so

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
this glitch last trick will make it so

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.840 
this glitch last trick will make it so
that<00:00:21.330> you<00:00:21.600> can<00:00:21.750> escape<00:00:21.990> on<00:00:22.529> platinum<00:00:23.279> every

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
that you can escape on platinum every

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.640 
that you can escape on platinum every
single<00:00:24.119> time<00:00:24.269> so<00:00:24.960> once<00:00:25.140> you<00:00:25.260> make<00:00:25.350> it<00:00:25.500> to<00:00:25.560> the

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
single time so once you make it to the

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.439 
single time so once you make it to the
last<00:00:25.830> time<00:00:26.070> and<00:00:26.340> you<00:00:26.430> activate<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:26.910> bomb<00:00:27.150> of

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
last time and you activate the bomb of

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.779 
last time and you activate the bomb of
course<00:00:27.830> if<00:00:28.830> you've<00:00:29.010> done<00:00:29.189> this<00:00:29.310> before<00:00:29.460> you'll

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
course if you've done this before you'll

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.659 
course if you've done this before you'll
know<00:00:29.970> that<00:00:30.170> there<00:00:31.170> is<00:00:31.349> a<00:00:31.500> there's<00:00:32.130> a<00:00:32.219> stop

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
know that there is a there's a stop

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.590 
know that there is a there's a stop
there's<00:00:33.540> two<00:00:33.840> stops<00:00:34.170> if<00:00:34.469> one<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:35.910> then<00:00:36.030> like

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
there's two stops if one and then like

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.110 
there's two stops if one and then like
as<00:00:36.989> you<00:00:37.590> go<00:00:37.710> to<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:37.950> town<00:00:38.129> and<00:00:38.160> there's<00:00:38.579> one<00:00:38.820> as

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
as you go to the town and there's one as

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.150 
as you go to the town and there's one as
you<00:00:39.360> at<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:40.020> top<00:00:40.230> of<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.469> motel<00:00:40.829> like

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
you at the top of the motel like

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.160 
you at the top of the motel like
basically<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.239> two<00:00:42.390> barrier<00:00:42.719> hives<00:00:42.930> long

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
basically the two barrier hives long

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.380 
basically the two barrier hives long
about<00:00:43.440> anyway<00:00:43.860> that's<00:00:44.489> not<00:00:44.760> important

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
about anyway that's not important

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.160 
about anyway that's not important
basically<00:00:46.140> this<00:00:46.649> glitch<00:00:46.950> /<00:00:47.850> trick<00:00:48.239> will<00:00:48.870> allow

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
basically this glitch / trick will allow

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.549 
basically this glitch / trick will allow
you<00:00:49.230> to<00:00:49.489> skip<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.730> second<00:00:51.149> hive<00:00:51.329> without<00:00:52.199> it

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
you to skip the second hive without it

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.799 
you to skip the second hive without it
even<00:00:52.680> being<00:00:53.010> created<00:00:53.460> so<00:00:53.640> see<00:00:54.090> how<00:00:54.300> like<00:00:54.539> this

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
even being created so see how like this

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.770 
even being created so see how like this
just<00:00:55.110> blocked<00:00:55.469> my<00:00:55.680> way<00:00:56.180> that'll<00:00:57.180> happen<00:00:57.210> a

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
just blocked my way that'll happen a

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.830 
just blocked my way that'll happen a
second<00:00:58.230> time<00:00:58.460> usually<00:00:59.460> so<00:01:00.180> what<00:01:00.539> you<00:01:00.600> have<00:01:00.719> to

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
second time usually so what you have to

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.619 
second time usually so what you have to
do<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:01.079> get<00:01:01.199> past<00:01:01.379> it<00:01:01.680> is<00:01:01.829> kill<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.219> two<00:01:02.370> riders

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 
do to get past it is kill the two riders

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:04.789 
do to get past it is kill the two riders
well<00:01:03.629> I<00:01:03.660> don't<00:01:03.899> think<00:01:04.110> you<00:01:04.199> have<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.530> kill<00:01:04.680> the

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
well I don't think you have to kill the

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.450 
well I don't think you have to kill the
riders<00:01:05.129> but<00:01:05.420> you<00:01:06.420> might<00:01:06.869> want<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.290> but<00:01:07.920> we've

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
revives you make sure the hive is like

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.380 
revives you make sure the hive is like
destroyed<00:01:37.680> like<00:01:37.950> it<00:01:38.100> is<00:01:38.189> there<00:01:38.400> once<00:01:39.180> there

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
destroyed like it is there once there

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.719 
destroyed like it is there once there
you<00:01:39.479> provide<00:01:39.780> you<00:01:39.960> is<00:01:40.110> that's<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.799> glitch<00:01:41.100> the

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
you provide you is that's the glitch the

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.480 
you provide you is that's the glitch the
second<00:01:42.210> hive<00:01:42.390> will<00:01:42.720> now<00:01:42.960> no<00:01:43.380> longer<00:01:43.619> spawn

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
second hive will now no longer spawn

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.889 
second hive will now no longer spawn
there<00:01:44.790> so<00:01:45.299> you<00:01:45.390> can<00:01:45.540> just<00:01:45.659> keep<00:01:45.840> running

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
there so you can just keep running

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.780 
there so you can just keep running
straight<00:01:46.500> into<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.740> helicopter<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:47.369> escape

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
straight into the helicopter and escape

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.109 
straight into the helicopter and escape
this<00:01:48.659> glitch<00:01:49.290> last<00:01:49.890> trick<00:01:50.369> i<00:01:50.610> don't<00:01:50.820> know<00:01:50.939> what

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
this glitch last trick i don't know what

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:51.499 
this glitch last trick i don't know what
to<00:01:51.180> call<00:01:51.210> it

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
to call it

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.389 
to call it
I<00:01:51.600> guess<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:52.049> glitch<00:01:52.259> really<00:01:52.680> because<00:01:53.280> I

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
I guess the glitch really because I

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:54.950 
I guess the glitch really because I
