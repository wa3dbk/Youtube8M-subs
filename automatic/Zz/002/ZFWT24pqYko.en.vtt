rocker<00:00:44.840> it<00:00:45.840> feels<00:00:46.710> like<00:00:46.920> it<00:00:47.070> would<00:00:47.160> be<00:00:47.309> out<00:00:47.399> of

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
rocker it feels like it would be out of

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.369 
rocker it feels like it would be out of
metal<00:00:47.700> it's<00:00:47.910> probably<00:00:48.210> also<00:00:48.329> it<00:00:48.510> is<00:00:48.930> also<00:00:49.140> out

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
metal it's probably also it is also out

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.020 
metal it's probably also it is also out
of<00:00:49.440> metal<00:00:49.710> it's<00:00:49.980> not<00:00:50.129> that<00:00:50.309> slim<00:00:50.579> but<00:00:50.789> at<00:00:50.879> least

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
of metal it's not that slim but at least

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.880 
of metal it's not that slim but at least
it<00:00:51.210> doesn't<00:00:51.390> have<00:00:51.930> a<00:00:51.960> fan<00:00:52.289> so<00:00:52.530> that's<00:00:52.739> of

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
it doesn't have a fan so that's of

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.319
