00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 or 

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:18.540
 their gap we already know that the 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.419
 still thing do not want to move 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:23.640
 it takes a force to move them 

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:26.160
 force is equal to the mass multiplied 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.769
 by acceleration and those measuring 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.300
 newton when a force moves something 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.000
 thing about a certain distance 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.760
 a job is done the job gets done 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.589
 measure in joules a joule corresponds to 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.629
 the amount of work done when 

00:00:37.589 --> 00:00:43.909
 a force of a newton is applied on 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:47.989
 a distance of one meter and now 

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:51.000
 the kinetic energy 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:53.430
 because of the inertia of laziness 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.460
 this billiard ball does not want to 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.350
 actually move it would stay there 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.979
 all day doing nothing if a 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:06.600
 another ball was going to hit her and 

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:13.890
 send it into the hole at the second 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:15.299
 ball forces the first to move all 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.039
 whenever a force acts on a 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.429
 distance you know that a certain 

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:23.549
 work was done good but where from 

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:25.740
 comes this work 6 2 the second ball 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.850
 of billiards naturally but what is it 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.520
 that this ball is so extraordinary 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.770
 to be able to move the other 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.350
 they both have the same mass 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.479
 is it not and laterite draws all 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.780
 two with exactly the same strength of 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.859
 gravity so what is the second 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.280
 last night the first one had 

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:46.229
 not the movement 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.780
 she was moving while 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.429
 the other was not and when you 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.799
 have both mass and speed 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:53.549
 you have the ability to make a 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.439
 job 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.759
 you can use it your movement 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.210
 to print a movement to others 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.249
 things 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.810
 in a sense we shoot that you have some 

00:01:59.249 --> 00:02:02.670
 work in reserve 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.229
 physicists always running after 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.509
 the words of other languages ​​are 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.429
 this time headed to greece and 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:13.350
 discover that the Greek word for the 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:16.350
 French proposal in and is only the 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:19.630
 word that you work and spurs 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:23.800
 when we juxtapose hate and ergo 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:25.300
 gets energo work into what in 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.990
 reserve what gives us the word 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:30.490
 french nrj and physicists read themselves 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:33.130
 agree to use that word in the 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:35.709
 sense of ability to do a job 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.060
 so the billiard ball moving to 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.340
 say the energy 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:42.280
 of course the origin of this energy 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:45.160
 comes from the billiard player gives levrat 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.790
 had some work in reserve or 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:50.770
 energy through its movement 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.370
 this energy has been transmitted to the tail 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:54.400
 billiards 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.590
 when the arm actuate it in turn the 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.850
 tail transmitted the energy to the ball of 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:02.650
 billiard by moving it and sending it 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:05.320
 hit the other bull forcing her as well 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.940
 go into the hole of the table of 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.590
 billiards at each stage 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.830
 a number of working days has been 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.959
 spent the arm actuating the that the 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:16.650
 tail hitting the ball the ball 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:19.450
 hitting the other bull 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.790
 but since the work is only 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.860
 energy in action and there is no 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.630
 work possible without energy as much 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.720
 say that a number of joules of energy has 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:30.820
 been spent each time and that's 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.530
 precisely what to say that the 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:35.470
 work and energy are measured all 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:37.780
 two in joules imagine jails 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:40.450
 transferred from a box of energy to a 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:44.350
 work box then to a box of 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:46.060
 force x distance of joules of energy 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.709
 are spent not only by the 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:51.700
 billiard players but by the players 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:54.760
 hockey players and football players 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.140
 carpenters and diggers and all 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.720
 the energy expended in this work 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:01.150
 exists only thanks to the movement 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.410
 that's when physicists in order to 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.600
 do not forget this discovery 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.579
 important returned once again 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.170
 to their Greek dictionary and that they 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:10.750
 found that the word for movement 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:12.489
 was clean emma a word that the 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.170
 film producers also used 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:16.690
 to designate moving images 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:19.150
 ie the cinema is a physicist 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:23.280
 they on their side have called the energy of 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.280
 motion kinetic energy
