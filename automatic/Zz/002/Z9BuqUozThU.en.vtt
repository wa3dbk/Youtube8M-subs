so the difference between a note and a
core<00:02:23.690> is<00:02:24.050> anytime<00:02:24.440> you<00:02:24.680> play<00:02:25.130> just<00:02:25.400> one<00:02:25.790> string

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
core is anytime you play just one string

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.110 
core is anytime you play just one string
or<00:02:26.570> one<00:02:27.080> have<00:02:27.440> one<00:02:27.710> sound<00:02:28.100> it's<00:02:28.370> called<00:02:28.670> a<00:02:28.820> note

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
or one have one sound it's called a note

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.480

when<00:02:29.570> you<00:02:29.630> play<00:02:29.840> more<00:02:30.230> than<00:02:30.500> one<00:02:30.560> sound<00:02:31.160> at<00:02:31.430> a

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.490 
when you play more than one sound at a

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.090 
when you play more than one sound at a
time<00:02:31.700> it's<00:02:32.210> called<00:02:32.510> a<00:02:32.660> chord<00:02:32.930> for<00:02:33.440> example<00:02:33.470> I

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
time it's called a chord for example I

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.770 
time it's called a chord for example I
can<00:02:34.340> have<00:02:34.370> my<00:02:34.670> B<00:02:34.910> strength<00:02:36.610> and<00:02:37.610> my<00:02:37.970> high<00:02:38.510> E

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
can have my B strength and my high E

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.490 
can have my B strength and my high E
string<00:02:39.130> and<00:02:40.300> if<00:02:41.300> I<00:02:41.390> play<00:02:41.660> those<00:02:41.930> two<00:02:41.960> together

string and if I play those two together
at<00:02:42.890> the<00:02:42.980> same<00:02:43.160> time<00:02:44.740> that's<00:02:45.740> a<00:02:45.920> chord

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
at the same time that's a chord

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:48.370 
at the same time that's a chord
here's<00:02:47.390> another<00:02:47.540> chord<00:02:47.930> here's<00:02:48.140> three
