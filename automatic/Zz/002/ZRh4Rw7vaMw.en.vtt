00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.630 
that's good now just put a little bit of
white<00:01:07.870> into<00:01:08.560> it<00:01:08.710> the<00:01:08.860> reason<00:01:09.010> I<00:01:09.159> put<00:01:09.310> ivory

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
white into it the reason I put ivory

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.160 
white into it the reason I put ivory
first<00:01:09.970> is<00:01:10.240> because<00:01:10.860> it's<00:01:12.630> white<00:01:13.630> on<00:01:13.659> its<00:01:13.990> own

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
first is because it's white on its own

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.210 
first is because it's white on its own
good<00:01:14.770> a<00:01:14.830> bit<00:01:15.010> it<00:01:15.280> would<00:01:15.520> be<00:01:15.810> $30<00:01:16.920> but<00:01:17.920> with<00:01:18.070> the

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.220 
good a bit it would be $30 but with the

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.030 
good a bit it would be $30 but with the
ivory<00:01:18.490> as<00:01:18.850> well<00:01:19.060> and<00:01:19.420> also<00:01:19.780> really<00:01:20.040> sparkly

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.190 

everything<00:02:11.460> that<00:02:11.490> later<00:02:11.850> okay<00:02:12.840> and<00:02:12.990> then<00:02:13.080> the

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
everything that later okay and then the

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.480 
everything that later okay and then the
other<00:02:13.260> thing<00:02:13.530> we<00:02:13.620> can<00:02:13.650> do<00:02:13.890> is<00:02:14.010> boots<00:02:14.250> in<00:02:14.460> a

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
other thing we can do is boots in a

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.840 
other thing we can do is boots in a
little<00:02:14.790> bit<00:02:15.410> because<00:02:16.410> we<00:02:16.709> felt<00:02:17.010> lovely<00:02:17.490> glow

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
little bit because we felt lovely glow

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.490 
little bit because we felt lovely glow
there<00:02:18.120> I<00:02:18.150> think<00:02:18.420> we<00:02:18.630> can<00:02:18.780> purple<00:02:19.140> just<00:02:19.319> a

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
there I think we can purple just a

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.610 
there I think we can purple just a
little<00:02:19.770> bit<00:02:19.890> of<00:02:19.980> that<00:02:20.069> you<00:02:20.459> dance<00:02:20.670> waivers<00:02:21.150> no

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
little bit of that you dance waivers no

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.559 
little bit of that you dance waivers no

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
it's the little bit of yellow in this is

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:36.020 
it's the little bit of yellow in this is
one<00:02:24.750> over<00:02:24.959> six<00:02:25.440> music

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.330 

it's<00:02:36.780> mixing<00:02:37.140> with<00:02:37.320> the<00:02:37.440> red<00:02:37.620> you<00:02:37.980> get<00:02:38.190> that

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.610 
it's mixing with the red you get that
orange<00:02:38.700> look<00:02:39.660> to<00:02:39.900> it<00:02:40.020> without<00:02:40.200> actually

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
orange look to it without actually

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.020

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
really now we're going to look at the

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.120 
really now we're going to look at the
dark<00:02:57.270> color<00:02:57.570> and<00:02:57.900> what<00:02:58.770> I'm<00:02:58.860> going<00:02:59.010> to<00:02:59.070> use

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
dark color and what I'm going to use

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.220 
dark color and what I'm going to use
here<00:02:59.580> is<00:02:59.820> I<00:02:59.880> think<00:03:00.180> I<00:03:00.420> believe<00:03:00.570> one<00:03:00.930> one<00:03:01.110> eight

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
here is I think I believe one one eight

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.290 
here is I think I believe one one eight
which<00:03:01.470> used<00:03:01.680> to<00:03:01.740> be<00:03:01.920> quite<00:03:02.459> a<00:03:02.580> strong<00:03:05.300> always

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
which used to be quite a strong always

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.020 
which used to be quite a strong always
worth<00:03:06.620> trying<00:03:07.620> it<00:03:07.890> first<00:03:08.100> if<00:03:08.459> it<00:03:08.580> doesn't<00:03:08.910> work

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
worth trying it first if it doesn't work

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.840 
worth trying it first if it doesn't work
you<00:03:09.239> can<00:03:09.390> this<00:03:10.250> you've<00:03:11.250> only<00:03:11.370> got<00:03:11.550> one<00:03:11.580> little

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
you can this you've only got one little

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.880 
you can this you've only got one little
bit<00:03:12.090> to<00:03:12.270> worry<00:03:12.660> about<00:03:12.780> but<00:03:13.260> I'll<00:03:13.440> put<00:03:13.590> that<00:03:13.770> on

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
bit to worry about but I'll put that on

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.430 
bit to worry about but I'll put that on
and<00:03:14.580> then<00:03:14.610> we're<00:03:14.940> use<00:03:15.090> of<00:03:15.330> one<00:03:15.540> one<00:03:15.690> eight<00:03:15.840> one

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
and then we're use of one one eight one

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.190 
and then we're use of one one eight one
one<00:03:17.100> eight<00:03:17.600> got<00:03:18.600> it<00:03:18.690> here<00:03:18.810> somewhere

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
one eight got it here somewhere

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.410 
one eight got it here somewhere
here<00:03:19.500> we<00:03:19.590> go<00:03:19.709> in<00:03:20.700> a<00:03:20.760> bit<00:03:20.910> of<00:03:20.940> one<00:03:21.120> one<00:03:21.270> eight

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
here we go in a bit of one one eight

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.100 
here we go in a bit of one one eight
yeah<00:03:22.200> that's<00:03:22.380> quite<00:03:22.500> a<00:03:22.620> strong<00:03:22.860> color<00:03:23.989> but<00:03:24.989> I'm

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
yeah that's quite a strong color but I'm

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:32.510 
yeah that's quite a strong color but I'm
hoping<00:03:25.410> it<00:03:25.650> mixed<00:03:25.950> with<00:03:26.250> thee<00:03:30.770> one<00:03:31.770> three

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520 
hoping it mixed with thee one three

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.070 
hoping it mixed with thee one three
eight<00:03:32.550> which<00:03:32.970> I<00:03:33.150> was<00:03:33.270> just<00:03:33.300> using<00:03:33.600> would<00:03:33.930> be

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
eight which I was just using would be

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:40.210 
eight which I was just using would be
okay<00:03:34.950> and<00:03:35.730> the<00:03:36.060> other<00:03:36.120> thing<00:03:36.420> when<00:03:36.630> it<00:03:36.750> is<00:03:36.870> is

work because we're using the 119 as a
link<00:04:10.590> color<00:04:14.030> yeah<00:04:15.030> that's<00:04:15.269> all<00:04:15.480> right<00:04:15.600> isn't

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
link color yeah that's all right isn't

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:22.430

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
will be the color that I will use and

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:26.810 
will be the color that I will use and
your<00:04:25.380> choices<00:04:25.830> are<00:04:26.070> the<00:04:26.220> bottom<00:04:26.430> you<00:04:26.490> see<00:04:26.550> this

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
your choices are the bottom you see this

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:32.230 
your choices are the bottom you see this
bottom<00:04:27.210> area<00:04:27.390> well<00:04:27.780> if<00:04:28.520> you<00:04:29.520> um<00:04:30.290> just<00:04:31.290> gently

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
bottom area well if you um just gently

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.050 
bottom area well if you um just gently
don't<00:04:33.240> you<00:04:33.560> you<00:04:34.560> get<00:04:34.770> the<00:04:35.490> colors<00:04:35.880> from

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
don't you you get the colors from

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.610 
don't you you get the colors from
underneath

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
underneath

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.510 
underneath
mixing<00:04:37.620> with<00:04:37.650> that<00:04:38.100> you<00:04:39.060> get<00:04:39.180> a<00:04:39.210> lot<00:04:39.510> softer

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520 
mixing with that you get a lot softer

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.010 
mixing with that you get a lot softer
sometimes<00:04:41.520> you<00:04:41.940> don't<00:04:42.180> want<00:04:42.300> to<00:04:42.510> softer<00:04:42.870> like

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020
