00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:17.340
 fresh announced new samsung 

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:19.770
 belongs to the galaxy family and wears 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.800
 proud alpha name first letter of greek 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.870
 alphabet for the first device perhaps 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.780
 galactic ruler charged 

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:30.600
 no-image full alpha review already available 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:32.730
 on the site and our videos are nice 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.640
 supplement for those who are serious 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.580
 got interested in the new galaxy background 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.680
 s5 alpha looks more compact and 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.690
 noble smartphone from the novelty 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.589
 the screen diagonal is smaller by four 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.170
 tenths of an inch 

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:48.000
 other dimensions are also proportional 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.159
 changed due to 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.199
 the device significantly better falls in hand 

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:54.780
 it is absolutely comfortable to operate 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:58.170
 No matter how big your hand is 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.750
 or miniature external change is not 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.150
 such striking but sufficient for 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.659
 order to design began to cause pleasant 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:08.640
 emotions instead of plastic which looks like 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.790
 pretty cheap smartphone case 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.770
 placed in a matte metal frame 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.539
 decorated with shiny brushed 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.880
 facets and relief 

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:19.170
 the projections cover material is the same 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.539
 rubberized plastic 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.310
 but drawing another instead of not loved 

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:26.939
 many squeezed them all over the surface 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.100
 dots here the texture is smoother with barely 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.619
 prominent mesh made up of 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.899
 crosses or pluses whom any analogy 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.299
 I like the same pattern more 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:38.429
 repeated on the front surface 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.570
 only under the glass version 

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:42.719
 operating system 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.369
 Alpha has a more recent 8th processor dash 

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:46.829
 in copies by two gigabytes of operative 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.000
 memory allow you to get in 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:51.240
 synthetic tests 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.729
 rating is excellent with resource - intensive games and 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.820
 heavy content problems should not be 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:59.549
 unlike galaxy resolution 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:02.549
 super amoled screen alpha not foul go 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:04.590
 just go but on such a diagonal you 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.990
 hardly feel the difference 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.420
 in general, we appreciate the screen very much 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.150
 optimistic detailed expertise you 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.760
 will find in the text review and we will highlight 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.950
 The main thing at the screen of alpha is excellent 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.770
 luminance characteristics worthy 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.810
 color accuracy improved angles 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.640
 review and quality 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.310
 warm image looks 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.920
 truly deep and realistic with 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.530
 very accurate shadow processing module 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.780
 cameras are simpler here than with case 5 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.120
 image quality most likely you 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.709
 suit but the top five for this indicator 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.680
 yet far ahead 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:42.360
 but there is a nice bonus video shooting 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.150
 4k resolution 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:48.000
 alpha battery which is nice removable but 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.700
 its capacity is significantly less than 5 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.850
 galaxy saves economical super amoled 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:57.030
 screen processor made by the new 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:59.010
 20 nanometer process technology and good 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.560
 optimized software that allows 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.900
 babies live more than 11 hours in mode 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:07.500
 watching ideas video at maximum 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:09.989
 brightness with active Wi-Fi from galaxy s5 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.849
 such things as a sensor moved here 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:14.310
 heart rhythm which at the same time 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:17.040
 used for hypothetical metering 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.709
 the level of your stress right there and the scanner 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.819
 fingerprint and extreme mode 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:23.970
 energy saving 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:25.980
 which we showed in the review from 5 and here 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:29.040
 from the onslaught of water in contrast to the five 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:31.709
 alpha is not protected is not in the device 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.540
 and memory card slots too bad 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:35.459
 all the time you have to choose either 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.650
 functional either beautiful 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:40.230
 offensively somehow you could have done 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.660
 image version of the flagship galaxy s5 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.579
 with the same good water protection chamber 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.489
 with memory card slot 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:49.950
 but no samsung company came up to the task 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:50.850
 making an iPhone killer perfectly 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.609
 straightforward 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:55.709
 that is, they added a metal frame that 

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:58.079
 good and nice led weight 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:01.170
 devices to indicator close iphone 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:03.569
 5s but removed the important and necessary 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.560
 many users thing in the slot for 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:07.230
 memory cards 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.660
 next to alpha last year's iphone 5s 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:12.269
 looks like a very small 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:14.819
 the increase in screen diagonal is something that 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:17.400
 It has long been waiting for requests apple lovers 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:19.739
 with almost identical weight indicators 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.720
 alpha nonetheless seems like an apparatus in 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:24.750
 lighter overall dimensions more 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:27.210
 weight distribution is different everything is logical but 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:29.700
 I will not say that this is an absolute plus with 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:32.250
 iphone you feel a pleasant weight in your hand 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.000
 Is there really almost no galaxy alpha? 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.610
 felt 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.100
 if in the case of alpha we are dealing with 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.330
 matrix super amoled by iphone 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.740
 recall this 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:45.030
 and ps for my taste it is the hilt of the matrix 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:47.610
 demonstrates a more realistic and 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:50.040
 natural image of the same stock 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:52.170
 iphone screen brightness is significantly higher 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:55.140
 than alpha but the whole thing 

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:57.300
 individual color perception of samsung 

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:59.700
 by the way you can still choose one of 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:02.370
 Modes to taste iphone battery 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:05.250
 smaller than alpha capacity so if 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:07.530
 samsung stand 11 hours of video about 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:09.290
 iphone only seven and a half module 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:11.880
 iphone cameras and how we remember 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:14.160
 8 megapixel from over it does not bother her 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:17.280
 still considered one of the best on 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:19.830
 market but video resolution 4k iphone 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:22.320
 of course it would not write iron 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:24.960
 Samsung more powerful his family shooting range 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.530
 processor and 2 gigabytes of operative 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.890
 of memory 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:31.290
 iphone has two cores and one gigabyte with 

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:33.300
 This iphone not only does not lose in 

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:35.310
 the plan of smoothness of work but also in some places 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:38.100
 manifests itself significantly better 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:39.990
 there is a logical explanation for this 

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.550
 android is designed to work on 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:43.830
 devices very different 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:44.669
 characteristics from here problems with 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:47.729
 compatibility 

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:48.900
 ios has absolute compatibility 

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:51.570
 iron set 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:53.060
 verified everything is optimized and targeted 

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:55.800
 for maximum performance 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:57.120
 actually that's why android 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.910
 smartphones and tablets 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:02.479
 often much more powerful 

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:05.610
 Filling than iPhones and iPads 

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:07.650
 besides alpha got not the most 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:10.200
 good interface and very sorry that 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:12.600
 samsung does not provide opportunities 

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:15.330
 operational transition to clean android 

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:18.650
 how it is well guessed to do in 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:21.240
 Lenovo's whole smartphone turned out 

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:24.030
 pleasant pretty balanced and 

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:26.370
 harmonious if you love the operating room 

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:28.440
 android system and do not confuse 

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:30.000
 compromise moments such as and 

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:33.020
 no memory card slot 

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.500
 The timer is weaker than the galaxy s5 and 

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:36.840
 insecurity from water 

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:38.640
 the machine will make you happy with him 

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:40.890
 good screen good time 

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:42.430
 battery life and it looks very 

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:44.380
 OK 

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:47.290
 galaxy alpha should go on sale 

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:50.290
 in mid-September, the time was chosen right 

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:50.800
 let's say not the best of rumors 9 

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:53.080
 September 

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:55.240
 Apple will show your new iphone which 

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:57.610
 traditionally absorb all the attention 

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:58.180
 lovers of new gadgets but in favor 

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:01.210
 samsung 

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:04.180
 plays such a factor as the price if now 

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:07.330
 The price of the official iphone 5s with volume 

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:10.120
 32 gigabytes of memory starts at 31 

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:13.900
 thousands of rubles alpha at the start of sales 

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:15.610
 promise over 25,000 even if 5s 

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:17.680
 traditionally cheaper with the coming 

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:20.620
 new model it will still be 

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:23.950
 more expensive samsung alpha so that samsung 

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:25.840
 there is a small but still for a review 

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:28.030
