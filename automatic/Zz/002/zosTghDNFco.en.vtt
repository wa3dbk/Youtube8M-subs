00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.350
 notifications work in a somewhat 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:31.210
 different one of the main 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:33.220
 differences is that now you can 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.559
 reply to a message directly 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.629
 since the apolo notification is 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:39.519
 calling action a ball notifications 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:41.979
 interactive notifications in Spanish 

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:46.210
 on the locked screen if you get a 

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:48.820
 dale message to respond and now what 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.159
 you have if you prefer to leave it for more 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.920
 late you can close it and you'll have it later 

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:56.199
 saved in your messages when the 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:59.110
 phone is unlocked if it reaches you 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:01.720
 a notification drags down and 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:04.390
 you will see an option to answer you will see 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.159
 as a novelty ios 8 makes it easy 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.630
 to write the answers more 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:09.759
 frequent 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.340
 for other types of notifications like 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:14.219
 appointments or reminders you can swipe 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.750
 to respond with the appropriate option 

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:18.110
 for example if you have to postpone a 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.450
 meeting 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.130
 as more applications go 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.050
 updating to take advantage of this option 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.150
 you can respond to another type of 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.040
 favorite notifications in a tweet 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.770
 I like it in a facebook photo 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.510
 or whatever to edit the way in the 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.000
 that the notifications appear or 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:37.280
 simply disable the seat and this 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.580
 it does not convince you too much you can go to 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:43.160
 Settings notifications and change your 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.200
 preferences for example I'll put that 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:48.110
 the messages appear to me in the middle of the 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.390
 screen instead of up so so 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.970
