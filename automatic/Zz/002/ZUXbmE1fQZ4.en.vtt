progress on the winch bumper I got the

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.890 
progress on the winch bumper I got the
ends<00:00:09.290> all<00:00:09.440> closed<00:00:09.800> in<00:00:10.070> ice<00:00:10.879> at<00:00:11.120> one<00:00:11.360> side<00:00:11.629> on

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:11.900 
ends all closed in ice at one side on

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.799 
ends all closed in ice at one side on
and<00:00:12.469> it<00:00:12.620> wasn't<00:00:12.950> closed<00:00:13.299> now<00:00:14.299> I've<00:00:14.450> got<00:00:14.629> this

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:25.699 
the winch in there I got the expanded

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:28.779 
the winch in there I got the expanded
metal<00:00:26.240> in<00:00:26.420> through<00:00:27.140> in<00:00:27.259> the<00:00:27.380> old<00:00:27.560> lights<00:00:27.859> I<00:00:28.220> had

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:34.090 
in these hella lights the 500 series and

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.340 
in these hella lights the 500 series and
they<00:00:35.090> filled<00:00:35.420> the<00:00:35.539> whole<00:00:35.660> thing<00:00:35.930> that<00:00:36.170> looked

they filled the whole thing that looked
really<00:00:36.530> cool<00:00:36.829> and<00:00:37.190> I<00:00:37.940> went<00:00:38.149> to<00:00:38.239> pull<00:00:38.450> one<00:00:38.690> of

00:00:38.709 --> 00:00:38.719 
really cool and I went to pull one of

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:40.090 
really cool and I went to pull one of
them<00:00:38.870> out<00:00:39.050> and<00:00:39.260> I<00:00:39.289> had<00:00:39.440> the<00:00:39.530> wires<00:00:39.739> hanging

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
them out and I had the wires hanging

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.040 
them out and I had the wires hanging
down<00:00:40.250> got<00:00:40.730> stuck<00:00:41.030> in<00:00:41.180> the<00:00:41.270> expanded<00:00:41.840> metal

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 
down got stuck in the expanded metal

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.619 
down got stuck in the expanded metal
yanked<00:00:42.980> it<00:00:43.100> out<00:00:43.190> of<00:00:43.250> my<00:00:43.460> hand<00:00:43.730> so<00:00:44.210> it<00:00:44.239> goes<00:00:44.449> to

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:44.629 
yanked it out of my hand so it goes to

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:46.810 
yanked it out of my hand so it goes to
flop<00:00:44.899> down<00:00:45.170> as<00:00:45.559> soon<00:00:45.770> as<00:00:45.890> it<00:00:46.070> goes<00:00:46.309> to<00:00:46.520> the<00:00:46.640> down

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
flop down as soon as it goes to the down

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.090 
flop down as soon as it goes to the down
angle<00:00:47.120> wire<00:00:47.899> goes<00:00:48.230> out<00:00:48.440> it<00:00:48.590> just<00:00:48.770> hits<00:00:48.949> the

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
angle wire goes out it just hits the

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.790 
angle wire goes out it just hits the
ground<00:00:49.370> just<00:00:49.699> exploded<00:00:50.390> so<00:00:51.320> I<00:00:51.350> got<00:00:51.530> glass

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
ground just exploded so I got glass

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.200 
ground just exploded so I got glass
lenses<00:00:52.370> so<00:00:53.210> I<00:00:53.270> was<00:00:53.480> a<00:00:53.510> bummer<00:00:54.160> anyway<00:00:55.160> I<00:00:55.370> just

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
lenses so I was a bummer anyway I just

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.180 
lenses so I was a bummer anyway I just
stuck<00:00:56.719> the<00:00:56.870> old<00:00:57.079> ones<00:00:57.350> in<00:00:57.559> these<00:00:57.920> are<00:00:58.100> the

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
stuck the old ones in these are the

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.430 
stuck the old ones in these are the
stock<00:00:58.489> dodge<00:00:58.820> ones<00:00:59.269> and<00:00:59.660> they're<00:00:59.960> mounted<00:01:00.320> at

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
stock dodge ones and they're mounted at

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.319 
stock dodge ones and they're mounted at
kind<00:01:00.679> of<00:01:00.769> an<00:01:00.890> angle<00:01:01.039> because<00:01:01.519> the<00:01:01.879> bumper<00:01:02.269> is

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:02.329 
kind of an angle because the bumper is

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:04.420 
kind of an angle because the bumper is
curved<00:01:02.690> and<00:01:03.320> because<00:01:03.649> of<00:01:03.800> the<00:01:03.890> curve<00:01:04.129> of<00:01:04.309> the

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
curved and because of the curve of the

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.480 
curved and because of the curve of the
bumper<00:01:05.350> you<00:01:06.350> know<00:01:06.500> they're<00:01:06.799> set<00:01:07.130> up<00:01:07.159> this

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
bumper you know they're set up this

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.160 
bumper you know they're set up this
shoot<00:01:07.729> straight<00:01:08.060> ahead<00:01:08.210> but<00:01:08.630> with<00:01:08.780> this<00:01:08.930> being

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
shoot straight ahead but with this being

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.560 
shoot straight ahead but with this being
at<00:01:09.890> an<00:01:10.100> angle<00:01:10.430> this<00:01:10.580> way<00:01:10.850> it<00:01:11.060> made<00:01:11.210> the<00:01:11.360> lights

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
at an angle this way it made the lights

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.420 
at an angle this way it made the lights
that<00:01:11.780> work<00:01:11.990> out<00:01:12.170> really<00:01:12.380> nice<00:01:12.650> they're

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
that work out really nice they're

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.300 
that work out really nice they're
slightly<00:01:14.170> rotated<00:01:15.170> but<00:01:15.350> you<00:01:15.530> can<00:01:15.710> change<00:01:15.979> that

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
slightly rotated but you can change that

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.740 
slightly rotated but you can change that
adjustment<00:01:17.060> here<00:01:18.729> then<00:01:19.729> I<00:01:19.850> got<00:01:20.030> the<00:01:20.240> strobe

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
adjustment here then I got the strobe

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.420 
adjustment here then I got the strobe
ones<00:01:20.990> underneath<00:01:21.350> of<00:01:21.650> that<00:01:21.829> and<00:01:22.130> the<00:01:22.220> winch

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
ones underneath of that and the winch

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.030 
ones underneath of that and the winch
works<00:01:22.759> awesome<00:01:23.030> it<00:01:23.869> works<00:01:24.049> really<00:01:24.409> good<00:01:24.560> it's

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
works awesome it works really good it's

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.520 
works awesome it works really good it's
really<00:01:25.250> smooth<00:01:25.670> works<00:01:26.210> like<00:01:26.420> brand<00:01:26.720> new<00:01:26.840> you

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
really smooth works like brand new you

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.310 
really smooth works like brand new you
could<00:01:27.680> say<00:01:27.970> so<00:01:28.970> I<00:01:29.000> haven't<00:01:29.509> closed<00:01:29.750> in<00:01:30.049> these

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
could say so I haven't closed in these

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.530 
could say so I haven't closed in these
somebody's<00:01:30.950> going<00:01:31.159> to<00:01:31.189> notice<00:01:31.520> that<00:01:31.549> I'm

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
somebody's going to notice that I'm

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.600 
somebody's going to notice that I'm
debating<00:01:32.899> whether<00:01:33.320> I'm<00:01:33.530> going<00:01:33.860> to<00:01:34.040> or<00:01:34.189> not<00:01:34.399> it

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
debating whether I'm going to or not it

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.600 
debating whether I'm going to or not it
probably<00:01:35.360> will<00:01:35.570> I<00:01:35.890> might<00:01:36.890> end<00:01:36.979> up<00:01:37.100> doing<00:01:37.310> these

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
probably will I might end up doing these

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.179 
probably will I might end up doing these
with<00:01:37.909> a<00:01:38.180> quarter<00:01:38.810> inch<00:01:38.960> steel<00:01:39.170> just<00:01:39.770> like<00:01:40.009> the

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189 
with a quarter inch steel just like the

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:44.170 
with a quarter inch steel just like the
rest<00:01:40.340> of<00:01:40.520> all<00:01:40.610> of<00:01:40.759> this<00:01:40.909> is<00:01:41.210> and<00:01:42.909> had<00:01:43.909> a<00:01:43.939> little

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
rest of all of this is and had a little

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.630 
rest of all of this is and had a little
gap<00:01:44.390> here<00:01:44.420> so<00:01:44.960> I<00:01:44.990> just<00:01:45.020> filled<00:01:45.530> it<00:01:45.710> just<00:01:46.310> put<00:01:46.520> it

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
gap here so I just filled it just put it

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.130 
gap here so I just filled it just put it
in<00:01:46.700> another<00:01:46.790> plate<00:01:47.270> it's<00:01:47.450> all<00:01:47.570> quarter<00:01:47.960> inch

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
in another plate it's all quarter inch

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.260 
in another plate it's all quarter inch
so<00:01:48.979> these<00:01:49.310> turned<00:01:49.579> out<00:01:49.729> really<00:01:50.060> really

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
so these turned out really really

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.980 
so these turned out really really
heavy-duty<00:01:50.869> because<00:01:51.799> of<00:01:51.979> this<00:01:52.100> being<00:01:52.340> the<00:01:52.990> 2

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
heavy-duty because of this being the 2

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.969 
heavy-duty because of this being the 2
by<00:01:54.170> 6<00:01:54.500> box<00:01:55.310> it<00:01:56.030> really<00:01:56.540> is<00:01:56.689> strong<00:01:57.020> and<00:01:57.409> then

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
up on the one side these don't last very

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.330 
up on the one side these don't last very
long<00:03:16.080> they're<00:03:16.380> pretty<00:03:16.650> they're<00:03:16.770> great<00:03:17.190> and

long they're pretty they're great and
everything<00:03:17.850> but<00:03:18.290> they<00:03:19.290> usually<00:03:19.470> fade<00:03:19.950> out

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
everything but they usually fade out

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:26.509

good<00:03:28.380> I<00:03:28.410> was<00:03:28.560> thinking<00:03:28.769> about<00:03:28.920> painting<00:03:29.190> this

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
good I was thinking about painting this

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:33.320 
good I was thinking about painting this
silver<00:03:30.530> because<00:03:31.530> the<00:03:31.560> silver<00:03:32.160> would<00:03:32.970> kind<00:03:33.239> of

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
silver because the silver would kind of

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.020 
silver because the silver would kind of
hide<00:03:33.540> everything<00:03:33.930> behind<00:03:34.410> it<00:03:34.650> better<00:03:34.860> but<00:03:35.760> I

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
hide everything behind it better but I

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.300 
hide everything behind it better but I
can't<00:03:36.420> tell<00:03:36.600> if<00:03:36.780> I<00:03:36.870> care<00:03:37.110> or<00:03:37.290> not<00:03:37.440> it's<00:03:38.160> not

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
can't tell if I care or not it's not

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.990 
can't tell if I care or not it's not
that<00:03:38.370> critical<00:03:38.730> to<00:03:39.150> me<00:03:39.300> and<00:03:39.950> then<00:03:40.950> she'll<00:03:41.820> show

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
that critical to me and then she'll show

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.900 
that critical to me and then she'll show
you<00:03:42.090> the<00:03:42.209> winch<00:03:42.390> operating<00:03:43.459> this<00:03:44.459> is<00:03:44.700> the

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
as myself you can just switch it to free

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 
if you just take your switch put it back

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.560 
if you just take your switch put it back
to<00:04:54.510> that<00:04:55.070> stand<00:04:56.070> on<00:04:56.340> it<00:04:56.550> so<00:04:57.060> you<00:04:57.120> got<00:04:57.270> a<00:04:57.300> little

00:06:52.279 --> 00:06:55.390 
perfect first try and then when I went
to<00:06:52.400> do<00:06:52.580> this<00:06:52.759> one<00:06:53.000> I<00:06:53.240> cut<00:06:53.930> it<00:06:54.139> okay<00:06:54.529> but<00:06:55.250> it's

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:55.400 
to do this one I cut it okay but it's

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:59.350 
to do this one I cut it okay but it's
got<00:06:55.550> a<00:06:55.580> heavy<00:06:55.909> seam<00:06:56.449> line<00:06:57.080> in<00:06:57.349> it<00:06:57.529> and<00:06:58.039> so<00:06:58.490> I<00:06:58.849> had

00:06:59.350 --> 00:06:59.360 
got a heavy seam line in it and so I had

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:01.689 
got a heavy seam line in it and so I had
it<00:06:59.509> the<00:06:59.629> wrong<00:06:59.839> way<00:06:59.870> and<00:07:00.469> it<00:07:00.979> was<00:07:01.129> too<00:07:01.279> short<00:07:01.550> to

00:07:01.689 --> 00:07:01.699 
it the wrong way and it was too short to

00:07:01.699 --> 00:07:04.240 
it the wrong way and it was too short to
correct<00:07:02.089> so<00:07:02.779> I<00:07:02.810> wound<00:07:03.110> up<00:07:03.289> you<00:07:03.440> chopping<00:07:03.800> it<00:07:04.099> up

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:04.250 
correct so I wound up you chopping it up

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:06.329 
correct so I wound up you chopping it up
and<00:07:04.400> making<00:07:04.490> these<00:07:05.000> little<00:07:05.210> things<00:07:05.569> out<00:07:05.810> of<00:07:05.839> it

00:07:06.329 --> 00:07:06.339 
and making these little things out of it

00:07:06.339 --> 00:07:10.930 
and making these little things out of it
but<00:07:07.339> I<00:07:07.789> had<00:07:08.029> to<00:07:08.150> do<00:07:08.270> that<00:07:08.419> one<00:07:08.659> twice
