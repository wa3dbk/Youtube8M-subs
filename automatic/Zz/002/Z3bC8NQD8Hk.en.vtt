00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430 
suppose that the league this american

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.670 
suppose that the league this american
years<00:01:10.430> is<00:01:11.060> it<00:01:11.330> better<00:01:11.600> if<00:01:11.750> it<00:01:12.020> comes<00:01:12.229> from<00:01:12.440> a

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
years is it better if it comes from a

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.290 
years is it better if it comes from a
coach<00:01:12.979> rather<00:01:13.400> than<00:01:13.580> a<00:01:13.640> player<00:01:13.820> James<00:01:14.060> Worthy

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:14.300 
coach rather than a player James Worthy

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:15.490 
coach rather than a player James Worthy
made<00:01:14.540> the<00:01:14.660> point<00:01:14.810> on<00:01:14.930> TV<00:01:15.229> the<00:01:15.350> other<00:01:15.380> night

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
made the point on TV the other night

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.740 
made the point on TV the other night
that<00:01:15.800> if<00:01:15.950> a<00:01:16.250> player<00:01:16.550> does<00:01:16.790> it<00:01:16.970> always<00:01:17.240> runs<00:01:17.540> the

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
that if a player does it always runs the

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.750 
that if a player does it always runs the
risk<00:01:17.900> that<00:01:18.110> they<00:01:18.410> the<00:01:18.979> officials<00:01:19.460> might<00:01:19.610> have

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:19.760 
risk that they the officials might have

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.000 
risk that they the officials might have
a<00:01:19.790> vendetta<00:01:20.000> and<00:01:20.270> so<00:01:20.540> would<00:01:20.630> you<00:01:20.750> rather<00:01:21.010> that

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.010 
a vendetta and so would you rather that

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.109 
a vendetta and so would you rather that
just<00:01:22.280> comes<00:01:22.490> from<00:01:22.670> you<00:01:24.400> you<00:01:25.400> know<00:01:25.520> I<00:01:25.580> actually

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
just comes from you you know I actually

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:28.030 
just comes from you you know I actually
told<00:01:26.900> the<00:01:27.050> team<00:01:27.229> you<00:01:27.470> know<00:01:27.590> i<00:01:27.619> rue<00:01:27.710> the<00:01:27.860> fact

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.040 
told the team you know i rue the fact

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.880 
told the team you know i rue the fact
that<00:01:28.400> perhaps<00:01:28.670> I<00:01:28.970> don't<00:01:29.690> get<00:01:30.080> in<00:01:30.229> the<00:01:30.380> referees

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.370 
that perhaps I don't get in the referees
and<00:01:31.070> get<00:01:31.280> tacticals<00:01:31.940> I<00:01:32.240> don't<00:01:32.840> think<00:01:33.140> it<00:01:33.229> does

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
and get tacticals I don't think it does

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.760 
and get tacticals I don't think it does
