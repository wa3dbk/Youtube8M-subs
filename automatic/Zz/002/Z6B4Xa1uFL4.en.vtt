00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:05.140
 hi all honest planet gt i'm 

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:07.000
 driving the new 308 gti 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:08.530
 we had a little time with 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.300
 the chance to ride with Gregory 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:12.430
 guilvert to take a ride on the 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.420
 goodwood circuit end the track and even 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:15.100
 if I have no right to give you 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.990
 print on the driving I can 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.250
 you introduce the car a bit and I 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.840
 can you say that aesthetically it's 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.400
 very successful we had not yet had 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.110
 the opportunity to see a white version 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.180
 pearly and I could see it and frankly 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.560
 for me it's the most beautiful 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.570
 interesting also to see that the 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.310
 version quickly we walk pretty well that's 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.410
 not like if we at 208 gti 30 it's a 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.909
 little less flashy because there the 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.289
 textures are the same on both 

00:00:33.909 --> 00:00:37.269
 colors so that's it's a point 

00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:38.679
 which is very very interesting here we are 

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:40.749
 obviously in a sporting spirit so 

00:00:38.679 --> 00:00:43.359
 the more wraparound seats for you 

00:00:40.749 --> 00:00:44.979
 maintain sport driving on alcantara 

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:46.749
 the leather the red stitching that gives 

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:48.969
 a very nice effect and the cabin 

00:00:46.749 --> 00:00:50.679
 black works rather very well 

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:52.899
 also note the sport steering wheel with 

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:55.629
 obviously the signature gti the lever of 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:58.059
 speeds well done and proves that it 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:59.350
 walk pretty much another thing that we 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:00.789
 must note is especially the style 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.039
 outside because the inside does not have 

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:05.019
 necessarily big thing that changes the 

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:07.450
 grille was slightly modified with 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:09.370
 a nice new 3d effect 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.870
 I like it even though obviously we would have 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.700
 wanted something more aggressive 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.320
 again to mark the side gti 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.400
 we also have the deflectors at the bottom of 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.830
 bumpers that come add a 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.940
 small difference to sion with the gt the 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.170
 car is even lower and 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.000
 frankly it gives him a little bit of a side 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.620
 more muscular and especially on the face 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.880
 back you have the diffuser that 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.710
 integrates double outputs 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.960
 exhaust a little in the way of the 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.910
 rcz air that works very very well 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.100
 especially on the pearly white version 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:35.050
 frankly it's excellent to have that him 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.490
 give a real style and we would like 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.020
 see even more muscles but 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.450
 obviously it's not us who decide 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:44.140
 here we are in the 270 horsepower version 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:46.630
 with the torsen the rims 19 inches and 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.640
 on the 250 version the bucket seats 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.470
 for example are optional rims 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.120
 are 18 inches and you have 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.590
 possibility also to take 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.760
 option the rims 19 inches and 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.290
 now it's time to ask 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:59.740
 some questions to gregory guilvert 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:01.090
 tester driver for peugeot sport so 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.550
 the first thing I can ask 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.190
 what are the changes that 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:08.190
 were made on the 308 gti by 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:11.260
 example compared to a 308 I was 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.939
 So the big job that has was 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.530
 to try to limit this phase a 

00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:16.900
 little bit of roll therefore to lower the 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.989
 the masses suspended in quotation marks 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.220
 that's it was lowered the car put 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:23.590
 a few tiles for his outfit 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.720
 route the torsen system that is of a 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.970
 curve entry so when motricity 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.739
 a lot of that it was the big ones 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.790
 points that were worked for 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:34.299
 make a car relatively 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:37.810
 competitive on circuit and while being 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:39.489
 pleasant on road uncomfortable so 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.870
 it's clearly a car that should 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:43.239
 satisfy those who want to do 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.470
 of the circuit here I think that's the 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:46.450
 specification was to make a 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.129
 product type is relatively circuit 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.900
 for the pilots to warn a little 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:53.530
 like me can find their 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:56.049
 counters and then for we do not like the 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:59.590
 term and the housewife she can 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:03:01.540
 also have fun in a 308 gti 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.870
 like that and he can use it at 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:07.409
 daily how would you define in 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.970
 a word the 308 is in this version 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:13.989
 you had to give because only one 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:17.250
 word but I think in one word we're going 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:20.410
 to say the relatively bestial yeah 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:22.720
 bestial and soft at once and 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:26.770
 so we have a spirit of sportsmanship 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:29.140
 which convey in this 308 gti that 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:30.520
 easily found at his wheel so 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.170
 it is theoretically a car that 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.300
 should please the press and even the 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.400
 final clientele when she will be 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.530
 available in late September for the 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.140
 press in the essays in October in 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:44.320
 the trade but I am persuaded and 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:46.060
 even if I have to be there to 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.290
 that they can use 100% of this 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.910
 car in my opinion it's okay 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.100
 the couple is more damage I hope 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.470
 that it will be so it is often the case 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:55.930
 it's before saying here under 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.580
 all that already makes for me for the 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.380
 push to push to push seven 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.150
 vehicles this vehicle in its 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.890
 entrenchments they go I give them some 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.150
 Courage from good bah agreements 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:06.370
 I hope we can do a lot 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.620
 september and then thank you very much for the 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.720
 climb because it was super nice and 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:14.160
 I tell you all to an upcoming 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.160
 I'll see you soon hello
