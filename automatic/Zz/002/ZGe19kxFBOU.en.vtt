for<00:00:05.400> me<00:00:05.520> this<00:00:05.670> exhibition<00:00:06.060> captures<00:00:06.990> that

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
for me this exhibition captures that

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.759 
for me this exhibition captures that
very<00:00:08.030> exploratory<00:00:09.030> character<00:00:09.929> of<00:00:10.139> the

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
very exploratory character of the

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.249 
very exploratory character of the
post-war<00:00:11.219> period<00:00:11.460> just<00:00:12.240> after<00:00:12.450> the<00:00:12.780> war<00:00:12.990> when

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
post-war period just after the war when

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.289 
post-war period just after the war when
artists<00:00:13.769> were<00:00:13.799> looking<00:00:14.160> for<00:00:14.370> new<00:00:14.639> forms<00:00:15.210> of

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
artists were looking for new forms of

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.439 
artists were looking for new forms of
expression<00:00:16.160> trying<00:00:17.160> to<00:00:17.310> incorporate<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:18.300> new

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
expression trying to incorporate the new

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.480 
expression trying to incorporate the new
materials<00:00:19.020> and<00:00:19.140> technologies<00:00:19.830> which<00:00:20.310> were

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
materials and technologies which were

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.580 
materials and technologies which were
developed<00:00:20.910> during<00:00:20.939> that<00:00:21.270> time<00:00:21.539> in<00:00:21.990> order<00:00:22.380> for

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
developed during that time in order for

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.349 
developed during that time in order for
them<00:00:22.740> to<00:00:22.980> expand<00:00:23.880> beyond<00:00:24.269> the

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
them to expand beyond the

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.410 
them to expand beyond the
two-dimensional<00:00:25.170> picture<00:00:25.320> plane<00:00:25.769> and<00:00:26.420> extend

two-dimensional picture plane and extend

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.769 
two-dimensional picture plane and extend
their<00:00:27.630> ideas<00:00:28.019> onto<00:00:28.380> art<00:00:29.220> that<00:00:29.640> moves<00:00:30.000> that

turns<00:00:31.189> that<00:00:32.189> lights<00:00:32.520> up<00:00:36.590> we<00:00:37.590> have<00:00:37.800> works<00:00:38.250> which

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
turns that lights up we have works which

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.670 
turns that lights up we have works which
are<00:00:38.610> working<00:00:38.910> with<00:00:39.059> electricity<00:00:39.680> electrical

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
are working with electricity electrical

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.470 
are working with electricity electrical
motors<00:00:41.010> we<00:00:41.550> have<00:00:41.640> works<00:00:41.850> which<00:00:42.090> work<00:00:42.300> with

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
motors we have works which work with

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.510 
motors we have works which work with
light<00:00:42.719> so<00:00:43.440> basically<00:00:43.920> there<00:00:44.219> is<00:00:44.250> lights

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
light so basically there is lights

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.610 
light so basically there is lights
flickering<00:00:45.059> on<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.300> off<00:00:45.510> and<00:00:45.840> we<00:00:46.289> have<00:00:46.410> works

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
flickering on and off and we have works

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.979 
flickering on and off and we have works
which<00:00:46.860> worked<00:00:47.520> with<00:00:47.730> no<00:00:48.149> electrical<00:00:48.539> motors

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
which worked with no electrical motors

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.930 
which worked with no electrical motors

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.780 
very simple in a way it's interesting to
say<00:02:14.840> art<00:02:15.050> historically<00:02:15.590> how<00:02:16.069> these<00:02:16.340> artists

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
say art historically how these artists

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.720 
say art historically how these artists
were<00:02:16.880> able<00:02:17.630> to<00:02:17.660> create<00:02:18.080> these<00:02:18.260> amazing<00:02:18.730> visual

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
were able to create these amazing visual

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.020 
were able to create these amazing visual
effects<00:02:20.150> with<00:02:20.480> such<00:02:20.750> simple<00:02:21.230> materials<00:02:22.030> and

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
effects with such simple materials and

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.250 
effects with such simple materials and
it's<00:02:23.150> important<00:02:23.630> to<00:02:23.660> understand<00:02:24.140> that

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
it's important to understand that

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.589 
it's important to understand that
contemporary<00:02:24.860> artists<00:02:25.190> working<00:02:25.340> today<00:02:25.700> are

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:26.599 
contemporary artists working today are

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:28.780 
contemporary artists working today are
very<00:02:27.080> much<00:02:27.260> inspired<00:02:27.680> by<00:02:28.099> these<00:02:28.489> kind<00:02:28.730> of

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
very much inspired by these kind of

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.970 
very much inspired by these kind of
artworks<00:02:32.230> since<00:02:33.230> the<00:02:33.380> exhibition<00:02:33.830> at<00:02:33.950> the

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
artworks since the exhibition at the

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.820 
artworks since the exhibition at the
Hayward<00:02:34.819> Gallery<00:02:35.049> 1970<00:02:36.049> there<00:02:36.470> has<00:02:36.590> not<00:02:36.769> been

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
Hayward Gallery 1970 there has not been

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.370 
Hayward Gallery 1970 there has not been
a<00:02:37.069> kinetic<00:02:37.459> exhibition<00:02:38.000> within<00:02:38.360> the<00:02:38.540> UK<00:02:38.930> and

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
a kinetic exhibition within the UK and

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.350 
a kinetic exhibition within the UK and
especially<00:02:39.709> focusing<00:02:40.340> on<00:02:40.459> European<00:02:41.209> and

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
especially focusing on European and

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.680 
especially focusing on European and
Latin<00:02:41.390> American<00:02:42.110> kinetic<00:02:42.769> artists<00:02:43.250> I<00:02:43.690> think

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
Latin American kinetic artists I think

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.330 
Latin American kinetic artists I think
anybody<00:02:45.019> who<00:02:45.140> comes<00:02:45.380> to<00:02:45.500> this<00:02:45.739> exhibition

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
anybody who comes to this exhibition

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.740 
anybody who comes to this exhibition
will<00:02:46.459> find<00:02:46.700> that<00:02:47.090> there's<00:02:47.299> not<00:02:47.420> only<00:02:47.599> a

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
will find that there's not only a

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.660 
will find that there's not only a
certain<00:02:47.959> playfulness<00:02:48.680> to<00:02:49.130> the<00:02:49.280> works<00:02:49.459> in<00:02:49.610> this

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
certain playfulness to the works in this

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.430 
certain playfulness to the works in this
exhibition<00:02:49.849> but<00:02:50.569> it<00:02:50.660> also<00:02:50.780> challenges<00:02:51.410> the

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
exhibition but it also challenges the

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.590 
exhibition but it also challenges the
very<00:02:51.560> notion<00:02:51.890> of<00:02:52.280> what<00:02:52.430> artists<00:02:52.880> so<00:02:53.299> I<00:02:53.329> defy

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
very notion of what artists so I defy

00:02:53.600 --> 00:03:05.050 
very notion of what artists so I defy
you<00:02:53.660> not<00:02:53.780> to<00:02:54.019> enjoy<00:02:54.260> yourself

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.120
