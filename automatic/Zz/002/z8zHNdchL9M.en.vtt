for reasons that aren't explained yet

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.610 
for reasons that aren't explained yet
having<00:01:15.060> a<00:01:15.210> me<00:01:15.270> around<00:01:15.660> makes<00:01:16.050> you<00:01:16.260> able<00:01:16.590> to

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:16.620 
having a me around makes you able to

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.710 
having a me around makes you able to
temporarily<00:01:17.370> heal<00:01:17.820> yourself<00:01:18.270> from<00:01:18.540> your

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
temporarily heal yourself from your

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:27.820 
temporarily heal yourself from your
infection<00:01:19.290> and<00:01:19.440> return<00:01:20.160> to<00:01:20.370> a<00:01:20.400> normal<00:01:20.610> state

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:27.830 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.170 

another<00:01:28.830> way<00:01:28.980> to<00:01:29.040> hold<00:01:29.220> back<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.640> infection

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
another way to hold back the infection

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.270 
another way to hold back the infection
is<00:01:30.330> to<00:01:30.930> find<00:01:31.170> these<00:01:31.290> sort<00:01:31.530> of<00:01:31.590> syringes<00:01:32.220> you

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
is to find these sort of syringes you

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.610 
is to find these sort of syringes you
can<00:01:32.580> use<00:01:32.790> a<00:01:35.420> third<00:01:36.420> way<00:01:36.630> is<00:01:36.930> by<00:01:37.200> finding

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:37.620 
can use a third way is by finding

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.760 
can use a third way is by finding
special<00:01:38.070> oxygen<00:01:38.610> masks<00:01:39.060> for<00:01:39.990> example<00:01:40.320> on<00:01:40.530> the

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
special oxygen masks for example on the

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.810 
special oxygen masks for example on the
bodies<00:01:41.130> of<00:01:41.430> dead<00:01:41.700> soldiers<00:01:43.460> here's<00:01:44.460> one<00:01:44.670> right

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
bodies of dead soldiers here's one right

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.630 
bodies of dead soldiers here's one right
here

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.240 

but<00:01:50.640> as<00:01:50.760> we'll<00:01:50.940> see<00:01:51.260> being<00:01:52.260> a<00:01:52.410> zombie<00:01:52.650> can<00:01:53.100> also

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
but as we'll see being a zombie can also

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.820 
but as we'll see being a zombie can also
have<00:01:53.700> its<00:01:53.970> advantages<00:01:54.230> especially<00:01:55.230> during

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830 
have its advantages especially during

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.830 
have its advantages especially during
infiltration<00:01:56.640> phases<00:01:57.180> like<00:01:57.600> here<00:01:57.810> for

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
infiltration phases like here for

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:58.460 
infiltration phases like here for
example

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
example

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.920 
example
Lana<00:01:58.770> decides<00:01:59.190> to<00:01:59.430> stay<00:01:59.670> infected<00:02:00.270> that<00:02:00.690> way

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
Lana decides to stay infected that way

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.810 
Lana decides to stay infected that way
the<00:02:01.200> other<00:02:01.380> zombies<00:02:01.680> think<00:02:02.310> she's<00:02:02.520> one<00:02:02.700> of

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
the other zombies think she's one of

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.250 
the other zombies think she's one of
them<00:02:03.030> and<00:02:03.270> she<00:02:03.300> can<00:02:03.870> avoid<00:02:04.050> a<00:02:04.229> fight<00:02:06.260> that's

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:07.260 
them and she can avoid a fight that's

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.990 
them and she can avoid a fight that's
all<00:02:07.470> for<00:02:07.650> now<00:02:07.680> we'll<00:02:08.310> see<00:02:08.490> you<00:02:08.640> for<00:02:08.850> the<00:02:08.910> next
