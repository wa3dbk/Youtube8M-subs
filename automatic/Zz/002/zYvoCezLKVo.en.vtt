00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
skin now this is where the problems

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.190 
skin now this is where the problems
coming<00:01:08.580> first<00:01:08.790> of<00:01:08.940> all<00:01:09.090> compared<00:01:09.930> to<00:01:10.080> the

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
coming first of all compared to the

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.770 
coming first of all compared to the
Clarisonic<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:11.400> brush<00:01:11.640> head<00:01:11.910> is<00:01:12.360> much

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
Clarisonic the brush head is much

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.260 
Clarisonic the brush head is much
smaller<00:01:13.230> it's<00:01:13.830> also<00:01:13.950> much<00:01:14.220> cheaper<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:15.060> brush

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
smaller it's also much cheaper the brush

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.540 
smaller it's also much cheaper the brush
head<00:01:15.540> but<00:01:15.990> it's<00:01:16.140> much<00:01:16.290> smaller<00:01:16.590> it<00:01:17.160> takes

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:17.550 
head but it's much smaller it takes

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:19.640 
head but it's much smaller it takes
approximately<00:01:17.700> two<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:18.750> three<00:01:19.080> minutes<00:01:19.440> not

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
approximately two to three minutes not

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.740 
approximately two to three minutes not
the<00:01:19.830> one<00:01:20.040> minute<00:01:20.370> to<00:01:20.760> actually<00:01:21.270> clean<00:01:21.570> the

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
the one minute to actually clean the

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.600 
the one minute to actually clean the
entire<00:01:22.110> face<00:01:22.440> with<00:01:22.650> this<00:01:22.770> because<00:01:23.010> it's<00:01:23.460> so

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
entire face with this because it's so

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.520 
entire face with this because it's so
much<00:01:23.760> smaller<00:01:24.000> so<00:01:24.870> it's<00:01:25.140> going<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.350> take

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
much smaller so it's going to take

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.920 
much smaller so it's going to take
longer<00:01:25.830> for<00:01:26.520> those<00:01:26.700> of<00:01:26.880> you<00:01:27.000> with<00:01:27.180> very<00:01:27.570> very

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
longer for those of you with very very

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.200 
longer for those of you with very very
dry<00:01:28.290> skin<00:01:28.350> very<00:01:28.830> sensitive<00:01:29.400> skin<00:01:29.520> you<00:01:30.090> will

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
dry skin very sensitive skin you will

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.810 
dry skin very sensitive skin you will
prefer<00:01:30.660> I<00:01:30.690> think<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.260> visi<00:01:31.470> pure<00:01:31.770> because<00:01:32.070> the

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
prefer I think the visi pure because the

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.700 
prefer I think the visi pure because the
brushes<00:01:33.300> are<00:01:33.450> much<00:01:33.720> softer<00:01:34.170> particularly

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
brushes are much softer particularly

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.050 
brushes are much softer particularly
this<00:01:34.860> soft<00:01:35.160> this<00:01:35.340> one<00:01:35.550> that<00:01:35.790> for<00:01:36.000> the

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
this soft this one that for the

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.420 
this soft this one that for the
sensitive<00:01:36.540> skin<00:01:36.630> is<00:01:36.870> very<00:01:37.260> very<00:01:37.590> soft<00:01:37.830> in

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
sensitive skin is very very soft in

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.370 
sensitive skin is very very soft in
comparison<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.420> one<00:01:39.570> that<00:01:39.780> Clarisonic

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
comparison to the one that Clarisonic

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.620 
comparison to the one that Clarisonic
has<00:01:40.560> so<00:01:41.010> in<00:01:41.400> that<00:01:41.700> regard<00:01:41.940> if<00:01:42.270> you've<00:01:42.390> tried

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
has so in that regard if you've tried

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.300 
has so in that regard if you've tried
the<00:01:42.810> Clarisonic<00:01:43.380> you<00:01:43.590> didn't<00:01:43.890> really<00:01:44.100> work

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
the Clarisonic you didn't really work

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.920 
the Clarisonic you didn't really work
for<00:01:44.640> you<00:01:44.730> then<00:01:45.150> this<00:01:45.330> would<00:01:45.540> be<00:01:45.660> a<00:01:45.690> great

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
for you then this would be a great

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.920 
for you then this would be a great
option<00:01:46.140> because<00:01:46.440> it's<00:01:46.800> much<00:01:47.070> more<00:01:47.340> gentle<00:01:47.930> but

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
option because it's much more gentle but

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.990 
option because it's much more gentle but
it<00:01:49.170> just<00:01:49.470> rotates<00:01:49.710> and<00:01:50.250> for<00:01:50.430> 150<00:01:51.210> pounds

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
it just rotates and for 150 pounds

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000 
it just rotates and for 150 pounds
it<00:01:52.300> really<00:01:52.600> is<00:01:52.870> not<00:01:53.050> worth<00:01:53.320> the<00:01:53.530> money<00:01:53.560> because

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.010 
it really is not worth the money because

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.280 
it really is not worth the money because
all<00:01:54.220> it<00:01:54.460> does<00:01:54.700> is<00:01:55.090> rotate<00:01:55.570> it<00:01:55.930> doesn't<00:01:56.200> do

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 
all it does is rotate it doesn't do

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.950 
all it does is rotate it doesn't do
anything<00:01:56.680> scientific<00:01:57.100> the<00:01:58.000> Clarisonic<00:01:58.810> will

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
anything scientific the Clarisonic will

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.719 
anything scientific the Clarisonic will
give<00:01:59.110> you<00:01:59.200> a<00:01:59.380> much<00:01:59.680> better<00:01:59.920> clean<00:02:00.280> for<00:02:00.640> your

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
give you a much better clean for your

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:03.030 
give you a much better clean for your
money<00:02:00.940> it<00:02:01.420> will<00:02:01.720> exfoliate<00:02:02.200> the<00:02:02.620> skin<00:02:02.650> much

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 
money it will exfoliate the skin much

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.580 
money it will exfoliate the skin much
easier<00:02:03.640> and<00:02:03.820> this<00:02:04.420> I<00:02:04.570> mean<00:02:04.840> Clarisonic<00:02:05.380> claim

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
easier and this I mean Clarisonic claim

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.010 
easier and this I mean Clarisonic claim
that<00:02:05.830> there<00:02:06.640> is<00:02:06.820> a<00:02:06.850> cleansing<00:02:07.330> device<00:02:07.570> it's<00:02:07.840> a

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
that there is a cleansing device it's a

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.529 
that there is a cleansing device it's a
cleansing<00:02:08.380> and<00:02:08.709> exfoliating<00:02:08.830> device<00:02:09.789> this<00:02:10.479> is

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
cleansing and exfoliating device this is

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.400 
cleansing and exfoliating device this is
purely<00:02:11.140> an<00:02:11.980> exfoliant<00:02:12.970> device<00:02:13.209> because<00:02:13.630> it

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
purely an exfoliant device because it

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.580 
purely an exfoliant device because it
just<00:02:14.980> rotates<00:02:15.220> wears<00:02:16.180> Clarisonic<00:02:16.810> has<00:02:17.350> that

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
just rotates wears Clarisonic has that

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.860 
just rotates wears Clarisonic has that
kind<00:02:17.830> of<00:02:17.890> pulse<00:02:18.220> but<00:02:19.180> to<00:02:19.510> each<00:02:19.630> their<00:02:19.810> own

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
kind of pulse but to each their own

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.720 
kind of pulse but to each their own
generally<00:02:20.800> speaking<00:02:21.040> I<00:02:21.310> prefer<00:02:21.340> the

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
generally speaking I prefer the

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.640 
generally speaking I prefer the
Clarisonic<00:02:22.270> I<00:02:22.360> still<00:02:22.690> use<00:02:22.930> the<00:02:23.020> Clarisonic<00:02:23.530> I

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
Clarisonic I still use the Clarisonic I

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.449 
Clarisonic I still use the Clarisonic I
use<00:02:23.830> the<00:02:23.980> delicate<00:02:24.489> and<00:02:25.739> normal<00:02:26.739> head<00:02:26.980> I<00:02:27.220> don't

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
use the delicate and normal head I don't

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:28.920 
use the delicate and normal head I don't
tend<00:02:27.880> to<00:02:27.970> use<00:02:28.150> the<00:02:28.300> others<00:02:28.510> because<00:02:28.780> they're

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
tend to use the others because they're

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.870 
tend to use the others because they're
too<00:02:29.080> stimulating<00:02:29.770> for<00:02:29.920> my<00:02:30.070> skin<00:02:30.370> the

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
too stimulating for my skin the

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.870 
too stimulating for my skin the
difference<00:02:31.270> you<00:02:31.810> can<00:02:32.020> hear<00:02:32.760> with<00:02:33.760> the

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
difference you can hear with the

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.150 
difference you can hear with the
Clarisonic<00:02:34.480> is<00:02:34.600> this<00:02:34.780> kind<00:02:35.020> of<00:02:35.160> real

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
Clarisonic is this kind of real

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.520 
Clarisonic is this kind of real
vibration<00:02:36.940> whereas<00:02:37.630> with<00:02:38.020> this<00:02:38.170> it's<00:02:38.440> just

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
vibration whereas with this it's just

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.160 
vibration whereas with this it's just
that<00:02:38.950> rotation<00:02:39.550> this<00:02:39.910> also<00:02:40.120> feels<00:02:40.480> cheap<00:02:40.930> and

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
that rotation this also feels cheap and

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.890 
that rotation this also feels cheap and
for<00:02:41.410> 150<00:02:42.130> pounds<00:02:42.459> I<00:02:42.580> really<00:02:42.940> think<00:02:43.180> it<00:02:43.480> should

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
for 150 pounds I really think it should

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.510 
for 150 pounds I really think it should
have<00:02:43.989> been<00:02:44.140> a<00:02:44.320> lot<00:02:44.680> better<00:02:44.709> made<00:02:45.130> because<00:02:45.340> you

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
have been a lot better made because you

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.990 
have been a lot better made because you
can<00:02:45.730> get<00:02:45.850> the<00:02:45.970> Clarisonic<00:02:46.570> Mya<00:02:46.810> for<00:02:47.680> like<00:02:48.370> 120

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
can get the Clarisonic Mya for like 120

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.590 
can get the Clarisonic Mya for like 120
pounds<00:02:49.570> so<00:02:49.780> it<00:02:50.080> really<00:02:50.489> you<00:02:51.489> know<00:02:51.640> Philips<00:02:52.209> are

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
pounds so it really you know Philips are

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.120 
pounds so it really you know Philips are
really<00:02:53.020> kind<00:02:53.260> of<00:02:53.350> trying<00:02:53.620> to<00:02:53.650> push<00:02:53.860> the<00:02:54.010> boat

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
really kind of trying to push the boat

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.100 
really kind of trying to push the boat
out<00:02:54.190> and<00:02:54.520> bringing<00:02:54.790> us<00:02:54.910> an<00:02:55.270> inferior<00:02:55.870> product

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
out and bringing us an inferior product

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.350 
out and bringing us an inferior product
for<00:02:56.440> too<00:02:56.680> much<00:02:56.860> money<00:02:57.190> well<00:02:57.880> I<00:02:57.910> think<00:02:58.060> is<00:02:58.330> a

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
for too much money well I think is a

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.240 
for too much money well I think is a
relatively<00:02:59.260> good<00:02:59.350> product<00:02:59.830> this<00:02:59.980> really

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
relatively good product this really

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.650 
relatively good product this really
should<00:03:00.430> be<00:03:00.459> charged<00:03:00.790> it<00:03:00.970> around<00:03:01.180> about<00:03:01.330> 50

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
should be charged it around about 50

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.870 
should be charged it around about 50
pounds<00:03:02.049> and<00:03:02.230> that's<00:03:02.950> you<00:03:03.370> know<00:03:03.459> that<00:03:03.489> would<00:03:03.850> be

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
pounds and that's you know that would be

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.460 
pounds and that's you know that would be
enough<00:03:04.420> money<00:03:04.630> and<00:03:04.870> it<00:03:04.930> would<00:03:05.019> be<00:03:05.170> pretty<00:03:05.320> good

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
enough money and it would be pretty good

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.170 
enough money and it would be pretty good
for<00:03:05.769> that<00:03:05.890> price<00:03:06.160> it<00:03:06.549> looks<00:03:06.730> actually<00:03:06.880> like

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
for that price it looks actually like

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.030 
for that price it looks actually like
your<00:03:07.330> sexual<00:03:07.660> device<00:03:07.959> really<00:03:08.290> doesn't<00:03:08.560> it<00:03:08.620> it

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
your sexual device really doesn't it it
