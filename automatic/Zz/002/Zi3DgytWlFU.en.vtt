00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:19.750 
three for learning arm vibrato for

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.019

so we just learned the parts of lightly

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.210 
so we just learned the parts of lightly
row<00:00:25.419> that<00:00:26.050> we're<00:00:26.140> going<00:00:26.230> to<00:00:26.320> add<00:00:26.470> vibrato<00:00:26.770> to

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:27.220 
row that we're going to add vibrato to

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.790 
row that we're going to add vibrato to
the<00:00:27.369> half<00:00:27.550> notes<00:00:27.820> and<00:00:28.270> one<00:00:29.259> whole<00:00:29.469> note<00:00:29.680> we

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:29.800 
the half notes and one whole note we

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.650 
the half notes and one whole note we
learned<00:00:30.009> on<00:00:30.189> f-sharp<00:00:30.369> where<00:00:30.790> we<00:00:30.880> do<00:00:31.059> the

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:31.660 
learned on f-sharp where we do the

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.030 
learned on f-sharp where we do the
reverb<00:00:32.110> rata<00:00:32.320> wobbles

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:33.040 
reverb rata wobbles

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.860 
reverb rata wobbles
so<00:00:33.700> now<00:00:33.820> I'm<00:00:33.880> going<00:00:34.000> to<00:00:34.059> show<00:00:34.270> you<00:00:34.300> how<00:00:34.540> to<00:00:34.600> do<00:00:34.840> a

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:34.870 
so now I'm going to show you how to do a

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.360 
so now I'm going to show you how to do a
wobble<00:00:35.290> on<00:00:35.469> the<00:00:35.620> last<00:00:35.860> note<00:00:36.160> of<00:00:36.190> the<00:00:36.309> song

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:36.370 
wobble on the last note of the song

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.750 
wobble on the last note of the song
which<00:00:36.790> happened<00:00:37.180> to<00:00:37.210> be<00:00:37.420> an<00:00:37.510> open<00:00:38.050> D<00:00:38.290> string

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
which happened to be an open D string

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.549 
which happened to be an open D string
say<00:00:39.760> but<00:00:39.910> I<00:00:39.940> don't<00:00:40.210> use<00:00:40.420> any<00:00:40.600> fingers<00:00:41.110> how<00:00:41.350> can

00:00:41.549 --> 00:00:41.559 
say but I don't use any fingers how can

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:44.520 
say but I don't use any fingers how can
I<00:00:41.620> do<00:00:41.680> the<00:00:41.920> broto<00:00:42.160> in<00:00:42.370> an<00:00:42.489> open<00:00:42.850> string<00:00:43.410> it's<00:00:44.410> a

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:44.530 
I do the broto in an open string it's a

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.740 
I do the broto in an open string it's a
really<00:00:44.770> sneaky<00:00:45.010> trick<00:00:45.400> but<00:00:46.090> what<00:00:46.270> you<00:00:46.390> do<00:00:46.570> is

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:46.750 
really sneaky trick but what you do is

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.890 
really sneaky trick but what you do is
you<00:00:46.900> take<00:00:47.140> a<00:00:47.410> note<00:00:47.680> that's<00:00:47.860> named<00:00:48.220> the<00:00:48.490> same<00:00:48.730> as

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:48.900 
you take a note that's named the same as

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.810 
you take a note that's named the same as
your<00:00:49.900> open<00:00:50.230> string<00:00:50.620> so<00:00:51.130> since<00:00:51.340> we're<00:00:51.520> doing<00:00:51.550> a

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:51.820 
your open string so since we're doing a

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.569 
your open string so since we're doing a
D<00:00:52.030> we<00:00:52.690> need<00:00:52.870> to<00:00:53.050> find<00:00:53.320> a<00:00:53.560> different<00:00:53.739> D<00:00:54.130> that

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:54.579 
D we need to find a different D that

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:56.910 
D we need to find a different D that
we're<00:00:54.700> going<00:00:54.820> to<00:00:54.910> use<00:00:55.060> a<00:00:55.090> finger<00:00:55.630> on<00:00:55.780> the<00:00:56.649> best

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:56.920 
we're going to use a finger on the best

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.910 
we're going to use a finger on the best
one<00:00:57.130> to<00:00:57.190> do<00:00:57.550> is<00:00:57.850> to<00:00:57.970> go<00:00:58.149> an<00:00:58.360> octave<00:00:59.050> higher<00:00:59.290> so

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 
one to do is to go an octave higher so

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.310 
one to do is to go an octave higher so
when<00:01:00.070> we're<00:01:00.220> going<00:01:00.340> for<00:01:00.640> an<00:01:00.730> open<00:01:01.149> D<00:01:01.360> string<00:01:01.390> we

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.320 
when we're going for an open D string we

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:03.720 
when we're going for an open D string we
can<00:01:02.500> play<00:01:02.649> the<00:01:02.710> third<00:01:03.070> finger<00:01:03.309> on<00:01:03.430> the<00:01:03.700> a

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.730 
can play the third finger on the a

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:04.469 
can play the third finger on the a
string

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:04.479 
string

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:06.179 
string
remember<00:01:05.019> this<00:01:05.140> works<00:01:05.379> for<00:01:05.590> violas<00:01:06.009> and

00:01:06.179 --> 00:01:06.189 
remember this works for violas and

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:09.389 
remember this works for violas and
violins<00:01:06.750> play<00:01:07.750> your<00:01:07.930> third<00:01:08.110> finger<00:01:08.320> D<00:01:08.950> on<00:01:09.250> the

00:01:09.389 --> 00:01:09.399 
violins play your third finger D on the

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:13.770 
violins play your third finger D on the
a<00:01:09.430> string<00:01:10.000> and<00:01:10.240> do<00:01:11.020> a<00:01:11.049> vibrato<00:01:11.500> on<00:01:11.890> it<00:01:12.780> it's

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
a string and do a vibrato on it it's

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.530 
a string and do a vibrato on it it's
gonna<00:01:14.020> pick<00:01:14.350> up<00:01:14.560> the<00:01:15.460> frequencies<00:01:16.210> that<00:01:16.240> make

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:16.540 
gonna pick up the frequencies that make

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.320 
gonna pick up the frequencies that make
addy<00:01:17.020> addy<00:01:17.320> and<00:01:17.890> it's<00:01:18.820> going<00:01:19.000> to<00:01:19.090> vibrate

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.330 
addy addy and it's going to vibrate

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.800 
addy addy and it's going to vibrate
those<00:01:19.900> a<00:01:20.229> little<00:01:20.500> bit<00:01:20.799> it's<00:01:21.010> not<00:01:21.159> like<00:01:21.400> doing

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
those a little bit it's not like doing

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.930 
those a little bit it's not like doing
vibrato<00:01:22.810> on<00:01:23.229> that<00:01:23.500> note<00:01:23.799> with<00:01:24.310> a<00:01:24.340> finger<00:01:24.729> it's

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:24.940 
vibrato on that note with a finger it's

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:26.460 
vibrato on that note with a finger it's
not<00:01:25.090> gonna<00:01:25.210> be<00:01:25.420> that<00:01:25.450> intense<00:01:25.960> but<00:01:26.200> it's<00:01:26.350> gonna

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.470 
not gonna be that intense but it's gonna

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.859 
not gonna be that intense but it's gonna
do<00:01:26.740> a<00:01:26.770> little<00:01:27.010> something<00:01:27.549> to<00:01:27.820> it<00:01:27.970> let<00:01:28.600> me<00:01:28.690> show

open D while we vibrate the third finger

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:03.420 
open D while we vibrate the third finger
so<00:02:02.229> I<00:02:02.290> got<00:02:02.409> to<00:02:02.500> make<00:02:02.590> sure<00:02:02.770> that<00:02:02.950> my<00:02:03.100> fingers

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
so I got to make sure that my fingers

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.840 
so I got to make sure that my fingers
are<00:02:03.460> not<00:02:03.790> touching<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:05.799> D<00:02:05.979> string<00:02:06.280> and<00:02:06.460> make

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
are not touching the D string and make

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.749 
are not touching the D string and make
sure<00:02:07.000> they're<00:02:07.150> not<00:02:07.299> on<00:02:07.479> there<00:02:07.720> okay<00:02:08.579> so<00:02:09.579> here's

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
sure they're not on there okay so here's

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.089 
sure they're not on there okay so here's
a<00:02:09.819> note<00:02:10.119> again<00:02:10.470> okay<00:02:11.470> so<00:02:11.530> I'm<00:02:11.650> gonna<00:02:11.769> vibrate

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:12.099 
a note again okay so I'm gonna vibrate

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:14.880 
a note again okay so I'm gonna vibrate
on<00:02:12.340> that<00:02:12.760> while<00:02:13.060> I<00:02:13.090> play<00:02:13.329> my<00:02:13.450> open<00:02:13.930> D<00:02:14.409> string<00:02:14.439> so

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
on that while I play my open D string so

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.429 
on that while I play my open D string so
this<00:02:15.010> is<00:02:15.159> to<00:02:15.220> know<00:02:15.340> what<00:02:15.400> I'm<00:02:15.519> playing

00:02:18.429 --> 00:02:18.439 

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:21.530 

now<00:02:19.439> I'm<00:02:19.590> gonna<00:02:19.739> wobble<00:02:20.040> on<00:02:20.640> my<00:02:21.060> third<00:02:21.329> finger

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
now I'm gonna wobble on my third finger

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:27.110 
now I'm gonna wobble on my third finger
a<00:02:21.810> listen<00:02:22.230> to<00:02:22.319> the<00:02:22.439> sound<00:02:25.700> might<00:02:26.700> not<00:02:26.849> hear<00:02:27.000> it

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
a listen to the sound might not hear it

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.699 
a listen to the sound might not hear it
at<00:02:27.239> that<00:02:27.359> slow<00:02:27.569> tempo<00:02:27.959> I'm<00:02:28.379> going<00:02:28.500> to<00:02:28.560> show<00:02:28.650> you

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
at that slow tempo I'm going to show you

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:36.210 
at that slow tempo I'm going to show you
quick<00:02:29.159> tempo

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.160 

you're<00:02:37.220> shaking<00:02:37.520> a<00:02:37.760> little<00:02:37.910> bit<00:02:38.360> blood

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
you're shaking a little bit blood

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:40.870 
you're shaking a little bit blood
intense<00:02:39.560> that's<00:02:39.860> still<00:02:40.160> living<00:02:40.400> in<00:02:40.520> a<00:02:40.610> tent

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
intense that's still living in a tent

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.390 
intense that's still living in a tent
for<00:02:41.150> brought<00:02:41.330> up

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.949 

it's<00:02:46.390> definitely<00:02:46.510> more<00:02:46.900> than<00:02:46.959> this

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.870 

okay<00:02:50.959> so<00:02:51.620> that's<00:02:51.740> a<00:02:51.890> little<00:02:52.010> sneaky<00:02:52.459> trick<00:02:52.670> so

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
okay so that's a little sneaky trick so

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.420 
okay so that's a little sneaky trick so
when<00:02:53.000> we're<00:02:53.180> doing<00:02:53.270> lightly<00:02:53.690> rub<00:02:53.870> now<00:02:54.280> this<00:02:55.280> is

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
when we're doing lightly rub now this is

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.850 
when we're doing lightly rub now this is
adding<00:02:55.760> vibrato<00:02:56.030> all<00:02:56.390> the<00:02:56.630> way<00:02:56.750> through<00:02:57.080> so

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
adding vibrato all the way through so

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.559 
adding vibrato all the way through so
when<00:02:58.010> we<00:02:58.130> get<00:02:58.250> to<00:02:58.400> the<00:02:58.520> end<00:02:58.670> we're<00:02:59.030> gonna<00:02:59.120> do<00:02:59.420> an

00:02:59.559 --> 00:02:59.569 
when we get to the end we're gonna do an

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:02.470 
when we get to the end we're gonna do an
open<00:03:00.080> string<00:03:00.650> vibrato<00:03:01.099> and<00:03:01.849> we're<00:03:02.150> gonna<00:03:02.270> do

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
open string vibrato and we're gonna do

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.240 
open string vibrato and we're gonna do
the<00:03:02.630> same<00:03:02.840> way<00:03:02.989> that<00:03:03.170> we<00:03:03.260> just<00:03:03.290> did<00:03:03.770> it<00:03:03.920> in<00:03:04.040> the

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
the same way that we just did it in the

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.610 
the same way that we just did it in the
other<00:03:04.400> ones<00:03:04.670> with<00:03:04.819> a<00:03:04.880> slow<00:03:05.270> controlled<00:03:06.080> level

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
other ones with a slow controlled level

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.979 
other ones with a slow controlled level
three<00:03:07.040> wobbles<00:03:07.489> on<00:03:07.760> that<00:03:08.600> note<00:03:08.780> it's<00:03:08.930> not

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
three wobbles on that note it's not

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:10.870 
three wobbles on that note it's not
going<00:03:09.230> to<00:03:09.290> sound<00:03:09.410> like<00:03:09.650> anything<00:03:10.010> yet<00:03:10.370> but

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
going to sound like anything yet but

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.059 
going to sound like anything yet but
this<00:03:11.000> is<00:03:11.150> the<00:03:11.300> technique<00:03:11.750> to<00:03:12.080> learn<00:03:12.260> so<00:03:12.920> that

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:13.069 
this is the technique to learn so that

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:14.979 
this is the technique to learn so that
you<00:03:13.160> can<00:03:13.340> start<00:03:13.610> adding<00:03:13.819> it<00:03:14.090> later<00:03:14.300> on<00:03:14.390> once

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
you can start adding it later on once

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:16.720 
you can start adding it later on once
you<00:03:15.170> start<00:03:15.440> increasing<00:03:15.680> the<00:03:15.950> speed<00:03:16.340> of<00:03:16.580> your

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
you start increasing the speed of your

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.750 
you start increasing the speed of your
vibrato<00:03:17.030> which<00:03:17.390> we're<00:03:17.600> going<00:03:17.780> to<00:03:17.870> do<00:03:17.989> soon

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
vibrato which we're going to do soon

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.970 
vibrato which we're going to do soon
okay<00:03:19.760> so<00:03:19.819> here<00:03:20.209> we<00:03:20.239> go<00:03:20.420> this<00:03:21.260> is<00:03:21.440> how<00:03:21.470> the<00:03:21.650> last

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
okay so here we go this is how the last

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:27.690 
okay so here we go this is how the last
parts<00:03:22.430> gonna<00:03:22.700> go<00:03:22.850> so<00:03:23.060> you're<00:03:23.150> gonna<00:03:23.239> go<00:03:23.450> deep

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.490 

never<00:03:28.700> comes<00:03:29.000> the<00:03:29.120> open<00:03:29.510> D<00:03:29.690> notice<00:03:30.110> I<00:03:30.260> switch

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
never comes the open D notice I switch

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:42.990 
never comes the open D notice I switch
my<00:03:30.620> fingers<00:03:30.920> over<00:03:31.040> to<00:03:31.220> the<00:03:31.310> a<00:03:31.340> string

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.030 

okay<00:03:44.050> see<00:03:45.050> what<00:03:45.170> I<00:03:45.200> did<00:03:45.440> it's<00:03:45.620> the<00:03:45.830> third

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
okay see what I did it's the third

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.650 
okay see what I did it's the third
finger<00:03:46.340> on<00:03:46.490> the<00:03:46.550> a<00:03:46.730> string<00:03:46.880> that's<00:03:47.300> doing<00:03:47.600> the

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
finger on the a string that's doing the

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.320 
finger on the a string that's doing the
wobbles<00:03:48.050> while<00:03:48.980> you're<00:03:49.130> playing<00:03:49.490> the<00:03:49.790> open<00:03:50.150> D

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:50.330 
wobbles while you're playing the open D

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.780 
wobbles while you're playing the open D
string<00:03:50.360> called<00:03:50.930> open<00:03:51.380> string<00:03:51.680> vibrato<00:03:51.980> kind

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
string called open string vibrato kind

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:54.310 
string called open string vibrato kind
of<00:03:52.850> fun<00:03:53.000> so<00:03:53.450> now<00:03:53.570> that<00:03:53.630> you've<00:03:53.840> got<00:03:54.140> that

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:54.320 
of fun so now that you've got that

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.020 
of fun so now that you've got that
little<00:03:54.560> technique<00:03:55.070> that<00:03:55.100> little<00:03:55.610> trick<00:03:55.790> there

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
little technique that little trick there

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:57.850 
little technique that little trick there
to<00:03:56.240> learn<00:03:56.360> we're<00:03:56.840> gonna<00:03:56.930> do<00:03:57.140> the<00:03:57.260> whole<00:03:57.470> song

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:57.860 
to learn we're gonna do the whole song

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:00.460 
to learn we're gonna do the whole song
lightly<00:03:58.400> row<00:03:58.550> with<00:03:58.730> that<00:03:58.880> slow<00:03:59.290> quarter<00:04:00.290> note

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
lightly row with that slow quarter note

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.190 
lightly row with that slow quarter note
250<00:04:01.220> tempo<00:04:02.090> and<00:04:02.540> we're<00:04:02.690> going<00:04:02.840> to<00:04:02.900> add<00:04:03.020> the

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
250 tempo and we're going to add the

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.110 
250 tempo and we're going to add the
vibrato<00:04:03.470> all<00:04:03.980> the<00:04:04.310> way<00:04:04.400> through<00:04:04.670> so<00:04:04.910> learn

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
vibrato all the way through so learn

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.550 
vibrato all the way through so learn
those<00:04:05.450> little<00:04:05.720> techniques<00:04:06.020> and<00:04:06.260> then<00:04:06.350> play

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
those little techniques and then play

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.620 
those little techniques and then play
this<00:04:06.710> along<00:04:07.040> with<00:04:07.070> me<00:04:07.400> over<00:04:08.090> and<00:04:08.270> over<00:04:08.540> and

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:08.630 
this along with me over and over and

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:10.450 
this along with me over and over and
over<00:04:08.780> till<00:04:09.260> you're<00:04:09.410> super<00:04:09.830> good<00:04:10.010> at<00:04:10.130> it<00:04:10.280> and

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:10.460 
over till you're super good at it and
