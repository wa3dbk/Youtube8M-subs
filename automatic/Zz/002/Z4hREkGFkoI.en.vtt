not<00:03:33.810> always<00:03:33.870> available<00:03:34.590> so<00:03:34.890> I<00:03:35.370> think<00:03:35.610> we<00:03:35.880> can

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
not always available so I think we can

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.930

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:06.890 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:09.210 

you

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.700 

so<00:04:10.120> how<00:04:10.570> does<00:04:10.630> it<00:04:10.840> work<00:04:10.960> well<00:04:11.170> basically<00:04:11.350> the

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:11.710 
so how does it work well basically the

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:14.160 
so how does it work well basically the
travel<00:04:12.010> tap<00:04:12.250> is<00:04:12.490> a<00:04:12.820> big<00:04:13.120> plastic<00:04:13.330> bottle<00:04:13.810> with

travel tap is a big plastic bottle with
a<00:04:14.200> filter<00:04:14.440> in<00:04:14.770> it<00:04:14.830> you<00:04:15.040> can<00:04:15.160> just<00:04:15.190> see<00:04:15.430> the

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:15.520 
a filter in it you can just see the

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:21.810 
a filter in it you can just see the
filter<00:04:15.850> that<00:04:16.000> there's<00:04:16.660> a<00:04:16.870> top<00:04:20.580> and<00:04:21.580> if<00:04:21.730> you

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
filter that there's a top and if you

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.730 
filter that there's a top and if you
drink<00:04:22.030> straight<00:04:22.390> out<00:04:22.570> of<00:04:22.600> the<00:04:22.750> bottle<00:04:22.900> I<00:04:23.290> found

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
drink straight out of the bottle I found

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.830 
drink straight out of the bottle I found
that<00:04:24.310> it<00:04:24.520> tastes<00:04:24.880> be<00:04:25.000> weird<00:04:25.270> if<00:04:25.450> you<00:04:25.540> do<00:04:25.660> that

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
that it tastes be weird if you do that

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.770 
that it tastes be weird if you do that
so<00:04:26.410> what<00:04:26.560> I<00:04:26.590> prefer<00:04:26.920> to<00:04:27.070> do<00:04:27.250> is<00:04:27.460> filter<00:04:28.240> it<00:04:28.480> into

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
so what I prefer to do is filter it into

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.540 
so what I prefer to do is filter it into
another<00:04:28.870> bottle<00:04:29.350> and<00:04:29.380> I've<00:04:29.620> got<00:04:29.860> a<00:04:29.890> clear

been<00:04:45.550> rava<00:04:45.790> brown<00:04:47.880> this<00:04:48.880> is<00:04:49.090> very<00:04:49.270> hard<00:04:49.420> to<00:04:49.510> do

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:49.660 
been rava brown this is very hard to do

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.670 
been rava brown this is very hard to do
while<00:04:49.870> holding<00:04:50.200> the<00:04:50.500> camera<00:04:50.770> and<00:04:51.450> so<00:04:52.450> we<00:04:53.110> put

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
while holding the camera and so we put

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:58.470 
while holding the camera and so we put
the<00:04:53.800> feed<00:04:54.070> you<00:04:55.060> can<00:04:55.200> there<00:04:56.910> as<00:04:57.910> well<00:04:58.150> as<00:04:58.240> taking

00:04:58.470 --> 00:04:58.480 
the feed you can there as well as taking

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.200 
the feed you can there as well as taking
it<00:04:58.630> straight<00:04:58.870> out<00:04:59.140> of<00:04:59.320> the<00:04:59.470> bottle<00:05:00.030> which<00:05:01.030> I

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210 
it straight out of the bottle which I

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:03.390 
it straight out of the bottle which I
found<00:05:01.480> a<00:05:01.540> bit<00:05:01.660> slow<00:05:02.020> you<00:05:02.290> can<00:05:02.560> decant<00:05:02.950> it<00:05:03.160> into

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:03.400 
found a bit slow you can decant it into

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.360 
found a bit slow you can decant it into
another<00:05:03.460> bottle<00:05:03.880> so<00:05:04.300> here<00:05:04.450> goes<00:05:05.340> you<00:05:06.340> just

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
another bottle so here goes you just

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:09.900 
another bottle so here goes you just
squeeze<00:05:06.910> we<00:05:07.330> do<00:05:07.510> two<00:05:07.660> squeeze<00:05:08.050> and<00:05:08.860> the<00:05:09.730> water

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:09.910 
squeeze we do two squeeze and the water

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:13.440 
squeeze we do two squeeze and the water
comes<00:05:10.210> trick<00:05:10.480> fall<00:05:10.660> through<00:05:11.790> we<00:05:12.790> should<00:05:13.090> just

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:13.450 
comes trick fall through we should just

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:15.030 
comes trick fall through we should just
be<00:05:13.660> able<00:05:13.690> to<00:05:13.840> see<00:05:14.050> probably<00:05:14.440> not<00:05:14.530> very<00:05:14.560> clearly

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:15.040 
be able to see probably not very clearly

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:19.050 
be able to see probably not very clearly
but<00:05:15.340> you<00:05:16.240> can<00:05:16.480> see<00:05:17.190> one<00:05:18.190> of<00:05:18.280> the<00:05:18.370> problems<00:05:18.760> is

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.060 
but you can see one of the problems is

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:24.140 
but you can see one of the problems is
this<00:05:19.510> is<00:05:19.720> quite<00:05:20.050> slow<00:05:21.210> at<00:05:22.210> about<00:05:22.540> 5<00:05:22.810> minutes<00:05:23.110> to

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150 
this is quite slow at about 5 minutes to

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:33.080 
this is quite slow at about 5 minutes to
to<00:05:25.150> dew<00:05:26.550> point<00:05:27.550> about<00:05:27.700> half<00:05:28.090> a<00:05:28.300> liter<00:05:28.480> so<00:05:29.730> and

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:35.700 

that<00:05:34.090> means<00:05:34.360> generally<00:05:34.600> what<00:05:34.960> I've<00:05:35.169> been

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:35.710 
that means generally what I've been

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:38.570 
that means generally what I've been
doing<00:05:35.950> where<00:05:36.070> needed<00:05:36.490> water<00:05:36.669> is<00:05:37.000> I've<00:05:37.180> been

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 
doing where needed water is I've been

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.720 
doing where needed water is I've been
waiting<00:05:39.840> so<00:05:40.840> to<00:05:40.900> Philip<00:05:41.370> having<00:05:42.370> a<00:05:42.430> break

waiting so to Philip having a break
outside<00:05:43.540> stream<00:05:43.960> and<00:05:45.450> filtering<00:05:46.450> there

00:05:48.439 --> 00:05:48.449 
outside stream and filtering there

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:50.959

that way killing two birds with one
stone<00:05:52.279> as<00:05:53.279> you<00:05:53.370> can<00:05:53.520> see<00:05:53.759> you<00:05:54.509> just<00:05:54.689> get

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:54.840 
stone as you can see you just get

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:57.079 
stone as you can see you just get
squeezed<00:05:55.199> and<00:05:55.620> at<00:05:55.889> some<00:05:56.069> point<00:05:56.340> it<00:05:56.789> will

00:05:57.079 --> 00:05:57.089 
squeezed and at some point it will

00:05:57.089 --> 00:06:00.170 
squeezed and at some point it will
generally<00:05:57.900> stop<00:05:58.520> trickling<00:05:59.520> or<00:05:59.699> slow<00:05:59.999> down

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.180 
generally stop trickling or slow down

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:04.999 
generally stop trickling or slow down
trickling<00:06:00.710> a<00:06:01.710> rich<00:06:02.069> case<00:06:02.339> just<00:06:02.729> releasing<00:06:04.009> the

trickling a rich case just releasing the

00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:12.290 
trickling a rich case just releasing the
bottle<00:06:10.069> helps<00:06:11.069> get<00:06:11.279> the<00:06:11.400> air<00:06:11.550> back<00:06:11.819> in<00:06:12.059> so

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:12.300 
bottle helps get the air back in so
