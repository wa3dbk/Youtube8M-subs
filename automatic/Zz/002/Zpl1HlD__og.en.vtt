00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:07.640
 today to teach you how to make this collected 

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:09.850
 it's super easy and simple so if 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:13.130
 are you ready let's do 

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:19.670
 we are going to need a brush 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:22.110
 quotes and hairpins now let's 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:25.789
 divert over it 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:28.250
 Rodriguez in two equal parts 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:32.210
 and what we are going to do with each strand 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:34.100
 It is a braid alone that instead of passing 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.040
 the ends forward we're going 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.690
 going back in this way os 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.510
 I will upload videos of techniques 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.600
 braided and remember that with any 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.820
 of them you can make this hairstyle 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.589
 continues working normally 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:51.110
 until you have more or less in half 

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:53.540
 where are you going to compare 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:56.330
 and you're going to start opening it like I'm 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.580
 doing me in this procedure is 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:01.100
 super simple will not cost you any 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:04.730
 work and with it you're going to get 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:07.580
 the size of your braids in play that yes 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:10.729
 You do not get it in no way proves 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:13.220
 to use some texturizers like 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:16.160
 example the dry shampoo that although not 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.720
 you believe it is fantastic to provide 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:22.390
 to the hair that volume that you need 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:24.220
 to get that finish you want 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.470
 when you have finished opening the 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:29.650
 braid you're happy you're still doing 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:31.810
 the part that you lack and you repeat again 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:35.050
 the same procedure as soon as you finish 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:37.850
 those tied with a ring and we're going 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:40.100
 on the other side 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.340
 let's repeat exactly the same 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.340
 operation 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:53.130
 we hold the burner and now we're going to 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:56.610
 start riding we take our 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:59.250
 braid with your finger right at the base and 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.720
 take it to the other extreme and now what 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.860
 what you have to do is simply 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.860
 fix it with a 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.840
 we repeat the same operation in the other 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:11.300
 side puts the finger you wear the braid towards 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.860
 the other end hides the humilia 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.670
 under the braid that we already have 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:21.380
 subject and fixed with forks now is 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:23.660
 possible that it has happened to you is not happening 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:26.120
 nothing do not worry you just have to 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.459
 pick it up with your finger in this way and 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.430
 fix it with a good fork who 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:34.360
 says a fork also says' the 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.360
 what do you need? 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.019
 and once done this if you have bangs 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.739
 all you have to do is adapt it to your 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:47.060
 how do you like me in this case I'm going 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:47.060
 to hold it with a fork 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.840
