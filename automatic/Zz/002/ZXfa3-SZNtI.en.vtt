00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:49.659 
attempt who worked with him a little bit

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:53.130 
attempt who worked with him a little bit
cued<00:01:50.500> him<00:01:50.619> back<00:01:50.770> to<00:01:50.950> neutral<00:01:51.250> posture<00:01:51.990> so<00:01:52.990> what

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
cued him back to neutral posture so what

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.070 
cued him back to neutral posture so what
we<00:01:53.259> did<00:01:53.470> was<00:01:53.740> we<00:01:54.159> always<00:01:55.090> teach<00:01:55.330> it<00:01:55.630> with

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 
we did was we always teach it with

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.080 
we did was we always teach it with
neutral<00:01:56.590> posture<00:01:56.830> then<00:01:57.310> we<00:01:57.429> move<00:01:57.670> into<00:01:57.850> the

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
neutral posture then we move into the

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.359 
neutral posture then we move into the
hip<00:01:58.270> hinge<00:01:58.539> with<00:01:58.810> neutral<00:01:59.170> posture<00:01:59.380> and<00:01:59.830> then

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
hip hinge with neutral posture and then

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:03.419 
hip hinge with neutral posture and then
we<00:02:00.549> can<00:02:00.700> overload<00:02:01.149> that<00:02:01.179> movement<00:02:01.899> so<00:02:02.429> we

00:02:03.419 --> 00:02:03.429 
we can overload that movement so we

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:05.520 
we can overload that movement so we
moved<00:02:03.610> to<00:02:03.729> stance<00:02:04.000> out<00:02:04.179> a<00:02:04.240> little<00:02:04.600> bit<00:02:04.780> just

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
moved to stance out a little bit just

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.770 
moved to stance out a little bit just
because<00:02:05.860> he<00:02:05.979> has<00:02:06.100> such<00:02:06.340> big<00:02:06.549> legs<00:02:06.940> and<00:02:07.270> we<00:02:07.600> want

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
because he has such big legs and we want

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.600 
because he has such big legs and we want
to<00:02:07.869> make<00:02:08.019> sure<00:02:08.259> you<00:02:08.440> can<00:02:08.649> get<00:02:08.890> in<00:02:09.009> a<00:02:09.100> good<00:02:09.340> set

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
to make sure you can get in a good set

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.130 
to make sure you can get in a good set

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
up position we moved him off the bar a

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.680 
up position we moved him off the bar a
little<00:02:11.319> bit<00:02:11.620> so<00:02:12.340> he<00:02:12.549> can<00:02:12.580> translate<00:02:13.239> his<00:02:13.420> knees

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
motion too we can see that neutral spine

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.050 
motion too we can see that neutral spine
let's<00:02:48.410> look<00:02:48.650> at<00:02:48.800> this<00:02:48.950> right<00:02:49.250> there<00:02:49.520> that's

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
let's look at this right there that's

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.540 
let's look at this right there that's
exactly<00:02:50.660> what<00:02:50.810> I<00:02:50.900> want<00:02:51.110> to<00:02:51.200> see<00:02:51.410> his<00:02:52.130> shoulders

exactly what I want to see his shoulders

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.220 
exactly what I want to see his shoulders
are<00:02:52.730> slightly<00:02:53.060> ahead<00:02:53.209> of<00:02:53.510> the<00:02:53.600> bar<00:02:53.840> that<00:02:54.110> means

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
are slightly ahead of the bar that means

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.190 
are slightly ahead of the bar that means
he<00:02:54.470> can<00:02:54.650> pull<00:02:55.190> up<00:02:55.459> and<00:02:55.700> pull<00:02:55.910> back<00:02:56.050> during<00:02:57.050> the

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
lockout he's got a lot more potential to

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.640 
lockout he's got a lot more potential to
stay<00:03:00.950> injury-free<00:03:01.490> and<00:03:02.140> he's<00:03:03.140> gonna<00:03:03.290> be<00:03:03.500> able

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
stay injury-free and he's gonna be able

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.210 
stay injury-free and he's gonna be able
to<00:03:03.740> pull<00:03:03.980> a<00:03:04.010> lot<00:03:04.310> more<00:03:04.780> here<00:03:05.830> once<00:03:06.830> he<00:03:07.010> gets

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
to pull a lot more here once he gets

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.190 
to pull a lot more here once he gets
used<00:03:07.459> to<00:03:07.670> bracing<00:03:08.270> in<00:03:08.420> that<00:03:08.569> neutral<00:03:08.810> posture

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
used to bracing in that neutral posture

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.270 
used to bracing in that neutral posture
