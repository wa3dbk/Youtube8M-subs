series graphics card launch you might be
thinking<00:00:13.080> that<00:00:13.530> this<00:00:13.679> is<00:00:13.740> the<00:00:14.009> 290x<00:00:14.700> but<00:00:15.030> know

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
thinking that this is the 290x but know

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.080 
thinking that this is the 290x but know
that<00:00:15.540> my<00:00:16.230> friends<00:00:16.560> is<00:00:16.680> the<00:00:16.800> 290x<00:00:17.460> and<00:00:17.760> you<00:00:17.850> can

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
that my friends is the 290x and you can

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.760 
that my friends is the 290x and you can
clearly<00:00:18.330> see<00:00:18.660> that<00:00:18.690> it's<00:00:18.990> quite<00:00:19.500> different

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
clearly see that it's quite different

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.830 
clearly see that it's quite different
you<00:00:20.100> would<00:00:20.250> be<00:00:20.369> wrong<00:00:20.550> to<00:00:20.609> think<00:00:20.970> that<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.300> 290

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
you would be wrong to think that the 290

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.840 
you would be wrong to think that the 290
is<00:00:21.930> the<00:00:22.050> 290x<00:00:22.650> no<00:00:22.890> I'm<00:00:23.039> good<00:00:23.279> thank<00:00:23.550> you

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
is the 290x no I'm good thank you

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.849 
is the 290x no I'm good thank you
we<00:00:24.180> are<00:00:24.300> going<00:00:24.420> to<00:00:24.510> be<00:00:24.570> talking<00:00:24.960> about<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.289> 290

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
we are going to be talking about the 290

we are going to be talking about the 290
I'm<00:00:25.949> what<00:00:26.220> it<00:00:26.310> brings<00:00:26.490> to<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:26.849> table<00:00:27.029> versus

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
I'm what it brings to the table versus

this<00:00:48.390> is<00:00:48.570> called<00:00:48.809> Hawaii<00:00:48.989> Pro<00:00:49.649> so<00:00:50.160> they<00:00:50.309> both

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
this is called Hawaii Pro so they both

the<00:02:39.640> GPU<00:02:40.030> space<00:02:40.269> right<00:02:40.540> now<00:02:40.690> so<00:02:40.900> it<00:02:41.019> did<00:02:41.170> get

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:41.349 
the GPU space right now so it did get

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:42.750 
the GPU space right now so it did get
pushed<00:02:41.590> back<00:02:41.739> a<00:02:41.800> little<00:02:42.040> bit<00:02:42.220> in<00:02:42.340> the<00:02:42.430> rumor<00:02:42.730> I

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
pushed back a little bit in the rumor I

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.300 
pushed back a little bit in the rumor I
heard<00:02:43.269> was<00:02:43.330> that<00:02:43.959> AMD<00:02:44.290> was<00:02:44.590> tuning<00:02:45.069> driver

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
heard was that AMD was tuning driver

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.300 
heard was that AMD was tuning driver
performance<00:02:45.640> to<00:02:46.450> make<00:02:46.630> the<00:02:46.810> 290<00:02:47.380> even<00:02:47.920> more

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
performance to make the 290 even more

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.009 
performance to make the 290 even more
competitive<00:02:48.819> right<00:02:49.299> up<00:02:49.450> to<00:02:49.600> the<00:02:49.720> very<00:02:49.750> last

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
competitive right up to the very last

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:50.699 
competitive right up to the very last
minute

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
minute

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:52.559 
minute
so<00:02:50.920> in<00:02:51.069> conclusion<00:02:51.250> there's<00:02:51.850> not<00:02:52.030> too<00:02:52.299> much<00:02:52.510> to

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:52.569 
so in conclusion there's not too much to

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:55.259 
so in conclusion there's not too much to
say<00:02:52.959> about<00:02:53.110> the<00:02:53.380> 290<00:02:53.920> it's<00:02:54.130> more<00:02:54.519> of<00:02:54.790> the<00:02:55.030> same

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.269 
say about the 290 it's more of the same

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:57.930 
say about the 290 it's more of the same
that<00:02:55.630> was<00:02:55.750> already<00:02:56.290> quite<00:02:56.680> excellent<00:02:57.160> so<00:02:57.790> it's

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
that was already quite excellent so it's

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.240 
that was already quite excellent so it's
