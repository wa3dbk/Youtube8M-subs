00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.390
 dad why are we atleti that are 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.940
 this phrase 

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:13.860
 this child is jose miguÃ©lez is 12 years old 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.290
 and it was the inspiration that gave rise to 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.000
 Atletico famous announcement that 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:21.420
 put in the mouth of everyone the already 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:26.070
 famous phrase since I was born that the aleti 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:29.820
 already won the doublet there already I think already 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:32.340
 I put on the first the first shirt 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.350
 Atleti but I imagine that just like me 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.900
 everyone will be wanting to know the story 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:40.440
 in the mouth of its protagonist this was the 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:42.720
 day of my birthday and my father then I 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.840
 got inside the field 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:49.640
 I take with the players Antonio 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:53.040
 antonio you know I took a photo with saved 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:56.400
 then the aleti played against the 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:59.070
 murcia I came here to sit in 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:05.760
 where I used to sit every Sunday 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:09.330
 and then they started falling 123 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.600
 until the 30th and then I what started 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:18.440
 to be the best day of my day of my life 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:21.930
 it ended up being a disgrace then I 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:24.450
 My father turned me around and I told him my dad 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.010
 what are we atleti and how did it feel 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:30.150
 this child to see that they had made a 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:31.890
 announcement about it because I was amused to 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.470
 see that I did not imagine what was going to happen 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.590
 this and finally we reveal the 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.869
 incognita what was the answer I 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.320
 he thought and then he told me we were going to do 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.650
 the madrid 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:47.800
 years at a meal with jose miguel 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:50.170
 then we were talking about how difficult 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.540
 that today's children find 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.240
 of the athletic one in that food 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:57.310
 indeed, what he told me 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.530
 then my position was that of head of 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.200
 press of the athletic one of madrid then 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.630
 He told a little about his son and a 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.340
 little the unanswered question that 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.830
 had done well since I was 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.840
 happened to say this is like children 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.150
 now that it's hard to explain by 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.310
 what when they ask their parents because 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.500
 they are from the athleti they would not be there 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.330
 that idea is ripe that idea 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.860
 I clearly understand that 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.320
 would move to the best was already 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.820
 transferred to the appropriate agency to the 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.230
 agency that brilliantly performs 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:28.360
 the commercial spots of the athletic 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.250
 madrid and good because in the end they did 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.630
 that creation that I believe was 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.630
 quite relevant
