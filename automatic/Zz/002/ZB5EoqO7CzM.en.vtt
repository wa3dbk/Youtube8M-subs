to<00:01:02.850> us<00:01:02.940> if<00:01:03.059> we<00:01:03.149> could<00:01:03.300> see<00:01:03.449> full<00:01:03.629> of<00:01:03.780> war<00:01:03.989> but<00:01:04.379> we

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
to us if we could see full of war but we

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.219

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
can't tell without going for the front

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.270 
can't tell without going for the front
door<00:01:08.990> as<00:01:09.990> you<00:01:10.200> can<00:01:10.320> imagine<00:01:10.409> these<00:01:10.710> units<00:01:11.130> are

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
door as you can imagine these units are

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.630 
door as you can imagine these units are
incredibly<00:01:12.270> powerful<00:01:12.689> army<00:01:12.930> commandos<00:01:13.640> when

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
incredibly powerful army commandos when

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.039 
incredibly powerful army commandos when
you're<00:01:14.790> playing<00:01:15.000> normal<00:01:15.390> levels<00:01:15.659> because

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
you're playing normal levels because

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.480 
you're playing normal levels because
then<00:01:16.170> you<00:01:16.259> can<00:01:16.409> always<00:01:16.530> just<00:01:16.979> spare<00:01:17.250> alive

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
then you can always just spare alive

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.950 
then you can always just spare alive
we'll<00:01:17.820> just<00:01:17.939> sneak<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.210> commando<00:01:18.689> in<00:01:18.810> around

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
we'll just sneak a commando in around

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.149 
we'll just sneak a commando in around
the<00:01:19.049> back<00:01:19.170> of<00:01:19.320> a<00:01:19.409> so<00:01:19.470> it's<00:01:19.710> even<00:01:19.830> better<00:01:20.070> than

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159

I'm<00:01:36.780> on<00:01:36.990> it<00:01:37.020> or<00:01:37.980> take<00:01:38.220> advantage<00:01:38.340> of<00:01:38.760> a<00:01:38.820> little

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
I'm on it or take advantage of a little

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.600 
I'm on it or take advantage of a little

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
bit of fur on the AI the light tank will

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.340 
bit of fur on the AI the light tank will
shoot<00:01:41.790> at<00:01:41.970> you<00:01:42.210> that's<00:01:42.570> what<00:01:42.780> it<00:01:42.900> will<00:01:42.990> do<00:01:43.170> it

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
shoot at you that's what it will do it

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.560

all<00:01:43.590> it<00:01:43.890> can<00:01:44.040> understand<00:01:44.520> is<00:01:44.790> shoot<00:01:45.240> at<00:01:45.420> the

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
all it can understand is shoot at the

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.860 
all it can understand is shoot at the
target<00:01:45.990> to<00:01:46.110> bring<00:01:46.380> it<00:01:46.500> down<00:01:47.000> it<00:01:48.000> has<00:01:48.360> a<00:01:48.570> heavy

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:48.870 
target to bring it down it has a heavy

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:50.600 
target to bring it down it has a heavy
wall<00:01:49.170> we<00:01:49.320> haven't<00:01:49.530> in<00:01:49.590> heavy<00:01:49.830> walls<00:01:50.040> furry

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
wall we haven't in heavy walls furry

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.290 
wall we haven't in heavy walls furry
walls<00:01:50.640> are<00:01:50.970> taller<00:01:51.240> than<00:01:51.540> sandbags<00:01:53.300> main

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:54.300 
walls are taller than sandbags main

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.840 
walls are taller than sandbags main
upshot<00:01:54.660> of<00:01:54.690> this<00:01:54.810> is<00:01:55.230> that<00:01:55.350> they<00:01:55.920> stop<00:01:56.310> all

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
upshot of this is that they stop all

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.700 
upshot of this is that they stop all
weaponry<00:01:57.360> and<00:01:57.720> not<00:01:57.870> all<00:01:58.050> weaponry<00:01:58.410> most

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:51.460 
yes how sneaky we are you got clearly

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:52.830 
yes how sneaky we are you got clearly
there<00:03:51.580> was<00:03:51.640> some<00:03:51.850> building<00:03:52.180> in<00:03:52.300> this<00:03:52.450> base<00:03:52.660> we

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
there was some building in this base we

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.420 
there was some building in this base we
have<00:03:52.959> to<00:03:53.080> describe<00:03:53.350> that<00:03:53.680> must<00:03:53.920> surely<00:03:53.980> be<00:03:54.340> the

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
have to describe that must surely be the

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.480 
have to describe that must surely be the
purpose<00:03:54.850> of<00:03:54.940> the<00:03:55.060> level<00:03:55.330> I'm<00:03:55.840> on<00:03:56.020> it<00:03:56.230> I<00:03:56.530> don't

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:57.490 
purpose of the level I'm on it I don't

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:58.980 
purpose of the level I'm on it I don't
know<00:03:57.580> how<00:03:57.730> it's<00:03:57.910> so<00:03:58.120> hard<00:03:58.360> to<00:03:58.480> work<00:03:58.690> out<00:03:58.840> with

00:03:58.980 --> 00:03:58.990 
know how it's so hard to work out with

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:00.540 
know how it's so hard to work out with
try<00:03:59.140> this<00:03:59.200> hopefully<00:03:59.830> with<00:03:59.950> it<00:04:00.070> up<00:04:00.220> my<00:04:00.340> three

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800 
win come on in that's the plan the funny

would<00:05:12.010> be<00:05:12.100> a<00:05:12.130> rather<00:05:12.280> odd<00:05:12.550> target<00:05:13.090> if<00:05:13.210> that's

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 
would be a rather odd target if that's

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.880 
would be a rather odd target if that's
what<00:05:13.510> the<00:05:13.600> game<00:05:13.750> wants<00:05:14.080> these<00:05:14.560> are<00:05:14.710> the<00:05:14.770> most

what the game wants these are the most

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:16.920 
what the game wants these are the most
