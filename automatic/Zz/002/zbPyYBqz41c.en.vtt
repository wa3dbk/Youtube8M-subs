00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.040 

there's

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.050 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.250 

and<00:01:38.340> there's<00:01:39.340> no<00:01:39.430> battery<00:01:39.930> it<00:01:40.930> works<00:01:41.170> with

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:41.260 
and there's no battery it works with

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.710 
and there's no battery it works with
that<00:01:41.410> battery<00:01:41.790> so<00:01:42.790> basically<00:01:43.330> the<00:01:43.420> battery<00:01:43.660> is

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
that battery so basically the battery is

00:01:43.720 --> 00:02:19.400 
that battery so basically the battery is
not<00:01:43.840> removable<00:01:43.870> right<00:01:47.640> behind<00:01:48.640> here<00:01:49.050> so<00:02:17.910> i

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
not removable right behind here so i

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:26.450 
not removable right behind here so i
