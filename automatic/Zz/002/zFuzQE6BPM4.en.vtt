00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
this stuff the monomer by itself the

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.359 
this stuff the monomer by itself the
cheapest<00:01:48.180> I've<00:01:48.420> seen<00:01:48.930> an<00:01:49.200> 8<00:01:49.439> ounce<00:01:49.680> bottle<00:01:50.189> at

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
cheapest I've seen an 8 ounce bottle at

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.010 
cheapest I've seen an 8 ounce bottle at
I<00:01:50.610> think<00:01:50.729> is<00:01:51.149> like<00:01:51.890> $24<00:01:52.890> and<00:01:53.750> the<00:01:54.750> clear

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
I think is like $24 and the clear

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.330 
I think is like $24 and the clear
acrylic<00:01:55.350> for<00:01:55.860> in<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:56.280> 4<00:01:56.790> ounce<00:01:57.409> it<00:01:58.409> varies<00:01:59.009> I

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
acrylic for in a 4 ounce it varies I

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.249 
acrylic for in a 4 ounce it varies I
think<00:01:59.759> the<00:01:59.909> cheapest<00:02:00.329> I've<00:02:00.509> seen<00:02:00.719> for<00:02:00.899> that<00:02:01.049> is

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
think the cheapest I've seen for that is

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.109 
think the cheapest I've seen for that is
around<00:02:01.590> 22<00:02:02.310> to<00:02:02.969> 25<00:02:03.450> it<00:02:03.840> depends<00:02:04.700> and<00:02:05.700> that's

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
around 22 to 25 it depends and that's

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.660 
around 22 to 25 it depends and that's
like<00:02:06.360> on<00:02:06.630> eBay<00:02:07.170> and<00:02:07.409> stuff<00:02:07.829> and

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
like on eBay and stuff and

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.580 
like on eBay and stuff and
I<00:02:08.729> haven't<00:02:09.720> seen<00:02:09.929> it<00:02:09.959> pretty<00:02:10.289> much<00:02:10.410> anywhere

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
I haven't seen it pretty much anywhere

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.580 
I haven't seen it pretty much anywhere

there too but anyway like I said I have

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.860 
there too but anyway like I said I have
monomer<00:02:19.530> and<00:02:19.739> I<00:02:19.860> have<00:02:20.130> powder<00:02:20.700> that's<00:02:21.599> not<00:02:21.840> a

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870
