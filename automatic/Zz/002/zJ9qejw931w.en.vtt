00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
plugged into an electric amplifier of

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.219 
plugged into an electric amplifier of
course<00:04:15.180> you<00:04:15.239> can<00:04:15.359> do<00:04:15.450> more<00:04:15.660> embellishments

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:16.229 
course you can do more embellishments

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:17.449

and<00:04:16.289> things<00:04:16.560> with<00:04:16.739> an<00:04:16.829> electric<00:04:17.130> than<00:04:17.250> you<00:04:17.340> can

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
and things with an electric than you can

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.000 
and things with an electric than you can
with<00:04:17.579> an<00:04:17.700> acoustic<00:04:17.910> but<00:04:18.810> that<00:04:19.019> there's

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
with an acoustic but that there's

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.140 
with an acoustic but that there's
something<00:04:20.250> about<00:04:20.340> an<00:04:20.459> acoustic<00:04:20.820> that<00:04:20.910> I<00:04:20.940> think

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
something about an acoustic that I think

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.330 
something about an acoustic that I think
is<00:04:21.209> very<00:04:21.239> cool<00:04:21.690> and<00:04:21.930> when<00:04:22.830> it<00:04:22.919> comes<00:04:23.099> to

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
is very cool and when it comes to

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.710 
is very cool and when it comes to
writing<00:04:25.760> that's<00:04:26.760> a<00:04:26.880> very<00:04:27.060> powerful<00:04:27.270> tool

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
writing that's a very powerful tool

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.780 
writing that's a very powerful tool
is<00:04:27.930> to<00:04:28.440> use<00:04:28.620> acoustic<00:04:29.160> so<00:04:29.400> if<00:04:29.610> it's<00:04:29.730> a

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:29.790 
is to use acoustic so if it's a

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.270 
is to use acoustic so if it's a
songwriting<00:04:30.270> thing<00:04:30.360> use<00:04:31.020> acoustic<00:04:31.590> even<00:04:32.190> if

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
songwriting thing use acoustic even if

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.670 
songwriting thing use acoustic even if
it's<00:04:32.400> a<00:04:32.490> death<00:04:32.700> metal<00:04:32.850> thing<00:04:33.210> right<00:04:33.680> cucak

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
it's a death metal thing right cucak

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.580 
it's a death metal thing right cucak
might<00:04:34.890> be<00:04:35.010> the<00:04:35.100> way<00:04:35.220> to<00:04:35.250> go<00:04:35.370> man<00:04:36.350> if<00:04:37.350> you<00:04:37.470> can

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
might be the way to go man if you can

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.710 
might be the way to go man if you can
afford<00:04:37.680> it<00:04:38.010> also<00:04:38.550> within<00:04:38.730> it<00:04:38.880> within<00:04:39.090> electric

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
afford it also within it within electric

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:40.760 
afford it also within it within electric
you're<00:04:39.840> gonna<00:04:39.960> have<00:04:40.080> to<00:04:40.170> get<00:04:40.260> an<00:04:40.410> amplifier

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
you're gonna have to get an amplifier

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:42.800 
you're gonna have to get an amplifier
too<00:04:41.010> and<00:04:41.280> then<00:04:41.760> there's<00:04:41.940> pedals<00:04:42.300> and<00:04:42.480> things<00:04:42.690> I
