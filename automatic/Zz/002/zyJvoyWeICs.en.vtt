00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
to your protein for example let's say

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.960 
to your protein for example let's say
that<00:00:16.080> you<00:00:16.379> have<00:00:16.590> her<00:00:16.800> protein<00:00:17.310> sequence<00:00:17.760> and

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
that you have her protein sequence and

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.330 
that you have her protein sequence and
you<00:00:18.779> don't<00:00:19.020> know<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.380> origin<00:00:19.890> of<00:00:19.920> further

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:04.300 
sequences that are similar to our
protein<00:03:00.819> we<00:03:01.819> can<00:03:01.909> see<00:03:02.269> the<00:03:02.480> first<00:03:03.200> ones<00:03:03.560> in<00:03:04.250> the

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
protein we can see the first ones in the

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:10.589 
protein we can see the first ones in the
most<00:03:04.700> of<00:03:05.030> them<00:03:05.659> are<00:03:05.959> and<00:03:06.349> so<00:03:06.530> interceptor<00:03:08.560> that

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:10.599 
most of them are and so interceptor that

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:16.089 
most of them are and so interceptor that
give<00:03:11.599> us<00:03:13.000> precious<00:03:14.000> information<00:03:14.889> but<00:03:15.889> our

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:16.099 
give us precious information but our

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:19.979 
give us precious information but our
sequence<00:03:16.879> maybe<00:03:17.150> it's<00:03:17.750> an<00:03:17.930> insulin<00:03:18.379> receptor

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
sequence maybe it's an insulin receptor

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:26.259 
sequence maybe it's an insulin receptor
okay<00:03:20.989> you<00:03:21.260> scroll<00:03:21.650> down<00:03:24.700> you<00:03:25.700> see<00:03:25.760> here<00:03:26.090> the

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
okay you scroll down you see here the

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:31.059 
okay you scroll down you see here the
the<00:03:26.659> degree<00:03:27.109> of<00:03:27.319> similarity<00:03:29.500> for<00:03:30.500> example<00:03:30.919> if

00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:31.069 
the degree of similarity for example if

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:36.970 
the degree of similarity for example if
it's<00:03:31.489> green<00:03:32.389> it's<00:03:33.049> 100%<00:03:33.709> a<00:03:34.629> pity<00:03:35.629> if<00:03:36.139> it's<00:03:36.650> red

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
it's green it's 100% a pity if it's red

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:43.629 
it's green it's 100% a pity if it's red
it's<00:03:38.500> 0%<00:03:39.500> almost<00:03:40.540> okay<00:03:42.159> example<00:03:43.159> can<00:03:43.310> see<00:03:43.459> here

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:43.639 
it's 0% almost okay example can see here

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:48.849 
it's 0% almost okay example can see here
the<00:03:43.760> first<00:03:44.379> hits<00:03:46.150> it's<00:03:47.150> a<00:03:47.419> human<00:03:47.930> right<00:03:48.379> we

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:48.859 
the first hits it's a human right we

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:54.369 
the first hits it's a human right we
have<00:03:49.040> mouse<00:03:49.340> and<00:03:49.909> rabbit<00:03:50.329> etc<00:03:53.049> which<00:03:54.049> means

00:03:54.369 --> 00:03:54.379 
have mouse and rabbit etc which means

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:59.949 
have mouse and rabbit etc which means
that<00:03:54.680> this<00:03:55.540> sequence<00:03:58.569> there's<00:03:59.569> not<00:03:59.750> only

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
that this sequence there's not only

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:04.059 
that this sequence there's not only
promise<00:04:00.620> it<00:04:00.829> is<00:04:01.010> a<00:04:01.159> sequence<00:04:02.680> okay<00:04:03.680> you<00:04:03.919> can

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:04.069 
promise it is a sequence okay you can

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:06.759 
promise it is a sequence okay you can
see<00:04:04.250> here<00:04:04.459> that<00:04:04.669> the<00:04:05.120> degree<00:04:05.720> of<00:04:05.810> identities

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:06.769 
see here that the degree of identities

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:11.649 
see here that the degree of identities
it's<00:04:07.069> a<00:04:07.250> 95<00:04:08.000> percent<00:04:09.159> this<00:04:10.159> will<00:04:10.639> give<00:04:10.819> us<00:04:11.060> very

00:04:11.649 --> 00:04:11.659 
it's a 95 percent this will give us very

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:17.170 
it's a 95 percent this will give us very
good<00:04:11.870> information<00:04:12.650> about<00:04:13.190> our<00:04:14.030> sequence<00:04:15.820> okay

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
good information about our sequence okay

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:22.180 
good information about our sequence okay
a<00:04:17.209> for<00:04:18.049> example<00:04:18.470> it's<00:04:18.650> 94<00:04:19.630> etc<00:04:20.630> here<00:04:21.440> it's<00:04:21.889> the

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
a for example it's 94 etc here it's the

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:26.529
