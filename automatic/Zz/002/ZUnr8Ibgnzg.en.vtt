00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 I'm talking about vehicular management and not 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:11.790
 simply from an installed tracker 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:14.370
 in the company vehicle recently 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.680
 wrote the story on our blog that 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.390
 shows the monthly cost and if I do not have to see 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.830
 with a company and the numbers are 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.689
 very high 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.910
 this means that the company needs to 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.150
 maximize productivity in this 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:30.390
 vehicle and for this it must have a 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:34.980
 tool accurate and reliable one 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:36.719
 management system is not only tracker 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.160
 it's all about intelligence 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.160
 in company logistics 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:52.489
 many companies are having difficulty in 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:54.620
 installation and good service and we 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:56.930
 practical and easy way. 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:00.050
 to install in relation to the service 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.579
 we have a specific service here 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.040
 corporate 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:06.049
 we do not work with individuals and 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.360
 professionals are 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:11.270
 qualified to deal with entrepreneurs 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:14.000
 and with managers any equipment 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.920
 connected to the internet can access the 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.710
 our system and beyond the resources 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.710
 patterns and any crawler 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:24.409
 we have two more functionalities that 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.690
 identification of the driver and 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:29.380
 control online consumption of 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.380
 fuel 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.509
 of course it is feasible our solution it 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.399
 costs less than half a tank of 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:42.939
 fuel of a popular car 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:45.229
 the company will save on maintenance 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:47.450

 in the market 

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:59.060
 it is important to look beyond the system to 

00:01:55.329 --> 00:02:03.020
 quality of equipment and the cost of 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:05.690
