tutorial<00:00:33.000> and<00:00:33.450> we<00:00:33.540> already<00:00:33.719> have<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.079> basic

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
tutorial and we already have the basic

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.530 
tutorial and we already have the basic
idea<00:00:34.680> of<00:00:34.860> what<00:00:34.950> a<00:00:35.250> switch<00:00:35.460> is<00:00:35.730> but<00:00:36.270> for<00:00:36.450> those

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
idea of what a switch is but for those

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.180 
idea of what a switch is but for those
of<00:00:36.719> you<00:00:36.809> who<00:00:36.989> haven't<00:00:37.230> you<00:00:37.739> should<00:00:37.920> go<00:00:38.040> watch

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
of you who haven't you should go watch

that<00:00:38.219> first<00:00:38.520> as<00:00:39.059> this<00:00:39.300> one<00:00:39.480> will<00:00:39.600> be<00:00:39.690> more

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
that first as this one will be more

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.420 
that first as this one will be more
in-depth<00:00:40.260> and<00:00:40.440> explaining<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:41.070> difference

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
in-depth and explaining the difference

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.010 
in-depth and explaining the difference
between<00:00:41.489> a<00:00:41.940> normal<00:00:42.180> switch<00:00:42.540> and<00:00:42.840> a<00:00:42.989> router

see<00:00:55.559> how<00:00:55.680> we<00:00:55.739> switch<00:00:56.100> in<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.340> video<00:00:56.640> but

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
see how we switch in the video but

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.639 
see how we switch in the video but
you'll<00:00:57.180> have<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.480> practice<00:00:57.660> an<00:00:58.020> experiment<00:00:58.530> to

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
you'll have to practice an experiment to

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.849 
you'll have to practice an experiment to
learn<00:00:58.800> them<00:00:58.980> on<00:00:59.100> your<00:00:59.280> own<00:00:59.309> a<00:01:00.350> rotor<00:01:01.350> switch<00:01:01.620> is

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
learn them on your own a rotor switch is

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.799 
learn them on your own a rotor switch is
also<00:01:02.100> a<00:01:02.309> sudden<00:01:02.699> change<00:01:02.910> of<00:01:03.059> direction<00:01:03.180> like<00:01:03.780> a

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
also a sudden change of direction like a

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.840 
also a sudden change of direction like a
normal<00:01:04.229> switch<00:01:04.439> but<00:01:04.860> you<00:01:04.979> also<00:01:05.280> swap<00:01:05.460> rudders

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
normal switch but you also swap rudders

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.940 
normal switch but you also swap rudders
as<00:01:06.060> for<00:01:06.750> example<00:01:06.840> you<00:01:07.380> are<00:01:07.470> turning<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:07.830> the

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
as for example you are turning to the

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.770 
as for example you are turning to the
right<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.310> then<00:01:08.580> you<00:01:08.700> Selim<00:01:09.030> roll<00:01:09.299> your<00:01:09.510> craft

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
right and then you Selim roll your craft

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:10.899 
right and then you Selim roll your craft
to<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:09.960> left<00:01:10.110> while<00:01:10.290> simultaneously

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909 
to the left while simultaneously

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:14.270 
to the left while simultaneously
swapping<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.210> left<00:01:12.390> rudder<00:01:12.659> as<00:01:13.159> simple<00:01:14.159> as

swapping to the left rudder as simple as
it<00:01:14.400> sounds<00:01:14.909> is<00:01:15.060> actually<00:01:15.810> quite<00:01:15.990> difficult<00:01:16.200> to

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
it sounds is actually quite difficult to

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.620 
it sounds is actually quite difficult to
perform<00:01:16.799> as<00:01:17.310> timing<00:01:17.610> is<00:01:17.820> crucial<00:01:18.000> as<00:01:18.360> well<00:01:18.540> as
