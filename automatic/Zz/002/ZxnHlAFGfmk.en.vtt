and I'm going to do an overview of the

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:07.519 
and I'm going to do an overview of the
magnifier<00:00:05.130> so<00:00:05.940> open<00:00:06.420> up<00:00:06.509> control<00:00:06.960> panel<00:00:07.379> and

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
magnifier so open up control panel and

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.589 
magnifier so open up control panel and
from<00:00:07.980> here<00:00:08.220> just<00:00:08.490> go<00:00:08.610> ahead<00:00:08.730> and<00:00:08.880> click<00:00:09.269> on<00:00:09.450> the

ease of access center from here we'll
click<00:00:12.630> on<00:00:12.840> start<00:00:13.410> magnifier<00:00:14.219> so<00:00:14.549> by<00:00:14.759> default

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
click on start magnifier so by default

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.970 
click on start magnifier so by default
it'll<00:00:15.750> be<00:00:15.839> at<00:00:15.929> one<00:00:16.020> hundred<00:00:16.080> percent<00:00:16.260> if<00:00:16.859> we

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
it'll be at one hundred percent if we

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.019 
it'll be at one hundred percent if we
want<00:00:17.190> we<00:00:17.250> can<00:00:17.900> jump<00:00:18.900> that<00:00:19.050> to<00:00:19.199> 200<00:00:19.770> 300<00:00:20.460> and<00:00:20.939> it

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
want we can jump that to 200 300 and it

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.279 
want we can jump that to 200 300 and it
just<00:00:21.180> keeps<00:00:21.300> going<00:00:21.570> and<00:00:21.810> going<00:00:21.900> and<00:00:22.199> going

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
just keeps going and going and going

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.060 
just keeps going and going and going
until<00:00:22.710> it<00:00:23.550> becomes<00:00:23.880> very<00:00:24.000> difficult<00:00:24.210> to<00:00:24.660> see

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:25.070 
until it becomes very difficult to see

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.160 
until it becomes very difficult to see
we<00:00:26.070> can<00:00:26.220> also<00:00:26.340> change<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:26.939> views<00:00:27.480> by<00:00:27.900> in<00:00:28.050> the

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
we can also change the views by in the

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.189 
we can also change the views by in the
drop<00:00:28.410> down<00:00:28.609> this<00:00:29.609> is<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:30.060> full<00:00:30.269> screen<00:00:30.599> which

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
drop down this is the full screen which

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.049 
drop down this is the full screen which
we<00:00:31.320> just<00:00:31.560> saw<00:00:31.740> if<00:00:32.009> we<00:00:32.130> want<00:00:32.369> we<00:00:32.430> can<00:00:32.610> also<00:00:32.759> do<00:00:33.030> a

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
we just saw if we want we can also do a

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.310 
we just saw if we want we can also do a
lens<00:00:33.829> lens<00:00:34.829> just<00:00:35.160> magnifies<00:00:35.670> an<00:00:35.910> area<00:00:36.360> that<00:00:36.600> we

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
lens lens just magnifies an area that we

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.780 
lens lens just magnifies an area that we
want<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:37.920> see<00:00:38.309> rather<00:00:38.610> than<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:39.090> entire<00:00:39.540> area

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:40.790 
want to see rather than the entire area

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.799 
want to see rather than the entire area
so<00:00:41.930> if<00:00:42.930> we<00:00:43.230> change<00:00:43.890> that<00:00:44.160> to<00:00:44.579> a<00:00:44.969> higher<00:00:45.629> amount

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
so if we change that to a higher amount

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.920 
so if we change that to a higher amount
it<00:00:46.289> gets<00:00:46.649> bigger<00:00:46.890> in<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.309> magnified<00:00:48.239> area<00:00:48.750> as

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
it gets bigger in the magnified area as

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.100 
it gets bigger in the magnified area as
well<00:00:49.219> the<00:00:50.219> other<00:00:50.280> option<00:00:50.460> is<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.239> go<00:00:51.570> with<00:00:51.870> a

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
well the other option is to go with a

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.740 
well the other option is to go with a
docked<00:00:52.879> magnifier<00:00:53.879> which<00:00:54.239> just<00:00:54.570> basically

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
docked magnifier which just basically

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.740 
docked magnifier which just basically
takes<00:00:55.199> over<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.590> top<00:00:56.399> half<00:00:56.760> of<00:00:56.969> your<00:00:57.239> computer

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
takes over the top half of your computer

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.029 
takes over the top half of your computer
and<00:00:57.870> you<00:00:57.989> can<00:00:58.050> change<00:00:58.710> that<00:00:59.039> by<00:01:00.109> going<00:01:01.109> up<00:01:01.649> like

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
and you can change that by going up like

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.799 
and you can change that by going up like
that<00:01:02.309> and<00:01:02.760> you<00:01:03.059> can<00:01:03.180> make<00:01:03.329> it<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.510> smaller

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
that and you can make it a smaller

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.210 
that and you can make it a smaller
amount<00:01:03.960> or<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.350> large<00:01:04.589> amount<00:01:04.949> just<00:01:05.040> by

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
amount or a large amount just by

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.850 
amount or a large amount just by
dragging<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:06.450> bar<00:01:06.659> different<00:01:07.080> direction<00:01:07.439> so

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
dragging the bar different direction so

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.080 
dragging the bar different direction so
when<00:01:07.979> you<00:01:08.070> move<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.310> mouse<00:01:08.430> around<00:01:08.640> you<00:01:08.909> see

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
when you move the mouse around you see

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.420 
when you move the mouse around you see
the<00:01:09.240> magnified<00:01:09.740> area<00:01:10.740> moves<00:01:11.159> along<00:01:11.610> with<00:01:11.909> it

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
the magnified area moves along with it

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.280 
the magnified area moves along with it
you<00:01:14.430> can<00:01:14.460> also<00:01:14.880> click<00:01:15.299> on<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.689> options<00:01:16.080> button

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
you can also click on the options button

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.100 
you can also click on the options button
and<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:17.070> options<00:01:17.540> gives<00:01:18.540> you<00:01:18.810> some

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
and the options gives you some

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.420 
and the options gives you some
additional<00:01:19.320> options<00:01:19.770> that<00:01:19.920> you<00:01:20.040> don't<00:01:20.250> have

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
additional options that you don't have

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.640 
additional options that you don't have
by<00:01:20.880> default<00:01:21.270> such<00:01:21.600> as<00:01:21.840> turning<00:01:22.020> on<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.409> color

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
by default such as turning on the color

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.940 
by default such as turning on the color
inversion<00:01:23.600> so<00:01:24.600> that<00:01:24.930> makes<00:01:25.170> things<00:01:25.439> easier<00:01:25.890> to

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
inversion so that makes things easier to

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.149 
inversion so that makes things easier to
read<00:01:26.100> for<00:01:26.250> some<00:01:26.460> people<00:01:26.790> you<00:01:27.570> can<00:01:27.810> uncheck<00:01:28.710> the

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
read for some people you can uncheck the

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.499 
read for some people you can uncheck the
follow<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.520> mouse<00:01:29.700> pointer<00:01:29.729> then<00:01:30.270> when<00:01:30.420> you

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
follow the mouse pointer then when you

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:31.749 
follow the mouse pointer then when you
move<00:01:30.659> around<00:01:30.780> you<00:01:31.049> won't<00:01:31.229> see<00:01:31.470> the

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
move around you won't see the

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:34.310 
move around you won't see the
magnification<00:01:32.759> following<00:01:33.180> it<00:01:33.329> you<00:01:34.049> can<00:01:34.200> also

that we're typing that's where to be

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.920 
that we're typing that's where to be
magnified<00:01:37.740> or<00:01:38.549> have<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.939> magnifier<00:01:39.450> follow

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
magnified or have the magnifier follow

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.510 
magnified or have the magnifier follow
the<00:01:40.140> text<00:01:40.439> insertion<00:01:40.710> point<00:01:41.040> which<00:01:41.189> is<00:01:41.340> the

box that you may be filling in and you
can<00:01:44.130> also<00:01:44.450> see<00:01:45.450> how<00:01:45.570> much<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:46.020> view<00:01:46.259> changes

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
can also see how much the view changes

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.200 
can also see how much the view changes
by<00:01:47.009> default<00:01:47.369> it<00:01:47.549> changes<00:01:47.850> at<00:01:47.970> a<00:01:48.000> hundred

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
by default it changes at a hundred

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.420 
by default it changes at a hundred
percent<00:01:48.390> at<00:01:48.720> a<00:01:48.810> time<00:01:49.110> but<00:01:49.799> you<00:01:49.979> can<00:01:50.100> make<00:01:50.250> that

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
percent at a time but you can make that

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.240 
percent at a time but you can make that
higher<00:01:50.759> or<00:01:50.790> lower<00:01:51.560> every<00:01:52.560> time<00:01:52.770> you<00:01:52.890> click<00:01:53.100> the
