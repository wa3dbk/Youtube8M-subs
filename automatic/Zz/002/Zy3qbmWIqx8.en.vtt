00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
goes on from there and this is the story

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.330 
goes on from there and this is the story
really<00:01:31.020> of<00:01:31.320> what<00:01:31.939> happens<00:01:33.439> to<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.560> dynamic<00:01:35.189> of

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
really of what happens to the dynamic of

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.880 
really of what happens to the dynamic of
this<00:01:35.490> sort<00:01:35.759> of<00:01:35.850> group<00:01:36.090> of<00:01:36.299> women<00:01:37.170> friends

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
this sort of group of women friends

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.240 
this sort of group of women friends
particularly<00:01:38.369> when<00:01:38.729> you<00:01:38.909> just<00:01:39.329> drop<00:01:39.950> one<00:01:40.950> man

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
particularly when you just drop one man

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.219 
particularly when you just drop one man
into<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.000> mix<00:01:42.270> there<00:01:42.600> had<00:01:42.750> to<00:01:42.780> be<00:01:42.899> a<00:01:43.020> man

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
into the mix there had to be a man

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.249 
into the mix there had to be a man
somewhere<00:01:43.710> didn't<00:01:44.040> there<00:01:44.689> so<00:01:45.689> this<00:01:46.110> is

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
somewhere didn't there so this is

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.389 
somewhere didn't there so this is
basically<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.890> story<00:01:47.189> of<00:01:47.340> Friday<00:01:47.579> nights<00:01:47.880> and

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:49.399 
basically the story of Friday nights and

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:52.069 
basically the story of Friday nights and
the<00:01:50.399> research<00:01:50.759> for<00:01:51.119> it<00:01:51.210> took<00:01:51.420> me<00:01:51.600> into<00:01:51.780> two

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
the research for it took me into two

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.920 
the research for it took me into two
areas<00:01:52.560> of<00:01:52.590> life<00:01:52.920> I'd<00:01:53.549> never<00:01:53.880> really<00:01:54.390> taken<00:01:54.659> on

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
areas of life I'd never really taken on

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.899 
areas of life I'd never really taken on
