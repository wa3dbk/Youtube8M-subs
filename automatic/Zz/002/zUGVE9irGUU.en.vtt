00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.490 
ID for a firework entity or rocket we
also<00:01:44.520> have<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.150> tag<00:01:45.540> tag<00:01:45.840> which<00:01:46.080> is<00:01:46.110> used<00:01:46.440> to

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
also have the tag tag which is used to

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.890 
also have the tag tag which is used to
punch<00:01:46.799> into<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.250> next<00:01:47.490> set<00:01:47.610> of<00:01:47.640> tags<00:01:47.909> after

punch into the next set of tags after

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.300 
punch into the next set of tags after
that<00:01:49.049> we<00:01:49.200> branched<00:01:49.590> through<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.860> firework

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
that we branched through the firework

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.700 
that we branched through the firework
then<00:01:50.549> open<00:01:50.820> up<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:50.970> explosions<00:01:51.600> now<00:01:52.409> this<00:01:52.590> is

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
then open up the explosions now this is

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:53.930 
then open up the explosions now this is
where<00:01:52.890> things<00:01:52.920> get<00:01:53.400> a<00:01:53.460> little<00:01:53.610> bit<00:01:53.820> more

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:53.940 
where things get a little bit more

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.300 
where things get a little bit more
complicated<00:01:54.390> if<00:01:54.900> we<00:01:55.380> have<00:01:55.470> a<00:01:55.500> look<00:01:55.680> at<00:01:55.770> MCA<00:01:56.070> we

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
complicated if we have a look at MCA we

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.980 
complicated if we have a look at MCA we
can<00:01:56.460> see<00:01:56.670> that<00:01:56.880> when<00:01:57.240> we<00:01:57.270> get<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:57.630> here<00:01:57.840> we

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
can see that when we get to here we

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.080 
can see that when we get to here we
reach<00:01:58.200> a<00:01:58.350> series<00:01:58.830> of<00:01:58.860> unnamed<00:01:59.460> tags<00:01:59.820> which

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
reach a series of unnamed tags which

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.430 
reach a series of unnamed tags which
were<00:02:00.270> very<00:02:00.390> difficult<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:00.900> format<00:02:01.260> income

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:01.440 
were very difficult to format income

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.649 
were very difficult to format income
onwards<00:02:01.890> but<00:02:02.520> before<00:02:02.909> I<00:02:02.940> go<00:02:03.090> into<00:02:03.150> that<00:02:03.299> I<00:02:03.420> want

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
onwards but before I go into that I want

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.450 
onwards but before I go into that I want
to<00:02:03.780> explain<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:04.229> explosion<00:02:04.470> tag<00:02:04.950> data<00:02:05.159> in

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
to explain the explosion tag data in

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.730 
to explain the explosion tag data in
there<00:02:06.240> we<00:02:06.390> have<00:02:06.540> the<00:02:06.659> various<00:02:07.080> tags<00:02:07.439> and

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
there we have the various tags and

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.190 
there we have the various tags and
effects<00:02:08.310> such<00:02:08.459> as<00:02:08.489> Flickr<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:09.509> trail<00:02:09.899> which

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
effects such as Flickr and trail which

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.380 
effects such as Flickr and trail which
not<00:02:10.439> to<00:02:10.649> be<00:02:10.769> shed<00:02:11.039> and<00:02:11.220> if<00:02:11.879> they<00:02:12.030> are<00:02:12.120> said<00:02:12.269> to

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
not to be shed and if they are said to

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.020 
not to be shed and if they are said to
one<00:02:12.569> its<00:02:12.870> active<00:02:13.290> and<00:02:13.439> as<00:02:13.530> I<00:02:13.680> said<00:02:13.860> to<00:02:13.920> zero<00:02:14.819> is

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
one its active and as I said to zero is

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.930 
one its active and as I said to zero is
the<00:02:15.209> active<00:02:15.800> then<00:02:16.800> we<00:02:16.920> have<00:02:17.069> the<00:02:17.280> type<00:02:17.610> tag

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
the active then we have the type tag

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.820 
the active then we have the type tag
which<00:02:18.180> is<00:02:18.209> an<00:02:18.480> integer<00:02:18.780> to<00:02:19.080> tell<00:02:19.260> the<00:02:19.349> firework

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
which is an integer to tell the firework

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.120 
which is an integer to tell the firework
if<00:02:19.980> it's<00:02:20.099> creeper<00:02:20.459> shaved

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130

ball or style etc however what we really

ball or style etc however what we really
want<00:02:25.450> to<00:02:25.480> have<00:02:25.630> a<00:02:25.660> record<00:02:25.960> right<00:02:26.110> now<00:02:26.140> is<00:02:26.260> the

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
want to have a record right now is the

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.130 
want to have a record right now is the
colors<00:02:27.070> tag<00:02:27.490> because<00:02:28.420> they<00:02:28.840> are<00:02:28.960> very

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
colors tag because they are very

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.650 
colors tag because they are very
difficult<00:02:29.380> to<00:02:29.650> understand<00:02:30.070> so<00:02:30.910> if<00:02:31.270> you've

little bit more complicated than that in

little bit more complicated than that in

such<00:03:26.320> a<00:03:26.440> paint<00:03:26.860> to<00:03:27.100> find<00:03:27.310> them<00:03:27.840> great<00:03:28.840> so<00:03:29.050> now

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
such a paint to find them great so now

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.230 
such a paint to find them great so now
we<00:03:29.260> have<00:03:29.500> the<00:03:29.620> RGB<00:03:30.040> values<00:03:30.370> we<00:03:30.520> want<00:03:30.700> should

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:31.240 
we have the RGB values we want should

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.880 
we have the RGB values we want should
it's<00:03:31.450> as<00:03:31.570> simple<00:03:31.900> as<00:03:31.990> plugging<00:03:32.230> them<00:03:32.620> straight

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
it's as simple as plugging them straight

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:34.800 
it's as simple as plugging them straight
into<00:03:33.160> a<00:03:33.190> command<00:03:33.550> block<00:03:33.730> and<00:03:33.850> hey<00:03:34.240> first<00:03:34.510> it'll

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
into a command block and hey first it'll

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:35.390 
into a command block and hey first it'll
work

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
work

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.950 
work
well<00:03:36.400> I'm<00:03:36.640> sorry<00:03:37.240> but<00:03:37.480> you're<00:03:37.600> gonna<00:03:37.690> have<00:03:37.810> to

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:37.960 
well I'm sorry but you're gonna have to

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.780 
well I'm sorry but you're gonna have to
think<00:03:38.170> again<00:03:38.260> because<00:03:38.770> it<00:03:39.010> just<00:03:39.370> gets<00:03:39.580> more

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
think again because it just gets more

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.640 
think again because it just gets more
complicated<00:03:40.390> in<00:03:40.840> order<00:03:41.200> to<00:03:41.260> use<00:03:41.410> them<00:03:41.530> in

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
complicated in order to use them in

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:42.690 
complicated in order to use them in
Minecraft<00:03:42.010> you're<00:03:42.130> gonna<00:03:42.220> have<00:03:42.340> to<00:03:42.430> convert

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
Minecraft you're gonna have to convert

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.190 
Minecraft you're gonna have to convert
them<00:03:42.850> into<00:03:42.940> a<00:03:43.090> single<00:03:43.330> number<00:03:43.840> using<00:03:44.020> this

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
them into a single number using this

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.890 
them into a single number using this
complicated<00:03:44.770> looking<00:03:45.070> formula<00:03:45.600> in<00:03:46.600> order<00:03:46.720> to

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
complicated looking formula in order to

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.300 
complicated looking formula in order to
explain<00:03:47.170> this<00:03:47.440> I<00:03:47.650> think<00:03:47.710> it's<00:03:47.920> best<00:03:48.040> we<00:03:48.160> have

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
explain this I think it's best we have

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:49.860 
explain this I think it's best we have
working<00:03:48.550> example<00:03:49.030> so<00:03:49.330> I'm<00:03:49.420> gonna<00:03:49.540> hop<00:03:49.720> out

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
working example so I'm gonna hop out

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.690 
working example so I'm gonna hop out
over<00:03:50.170> to<00:03:50.290> paint<00:03:50.500> and<00:03:50.890> grab<00:03:51.100> the<00:03:51.220> RGB<00:03:51.520> values

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
over to paint and grab the RGB values

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.320 
over to paint and grab the RGB values
for<00:03:52.120> its<00:03:52.210> orangey<00:03:52.660> color<00:03:53.880> so<00:03:54.880> if<00:03:54.940> we<00:03:55.030> plug<00:03:55.180> this

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:55.330 
for its orangey color so if we plug this

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:58.850 
for its orangey color so if we plug this
into<00:03:55.540> our<00:03:55.660> formula<00:03:55.960> we<00:03:56.170> get<00:03:56.350> 1<00:03:56.680> plus<00:03:57.000> 256<00:03:58.000> times

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
into our formula we get 1 plus 256 times

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:04.230 
into our formula we get 1 plus 256 times
129<00:03:59.860> plus<00:04:00.930> 6550<00:04:01.930> three<00:04:02.140> times<00:04:02.700> 243<00:04:03.700> which

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:04.240 
129 plus 6550 three times 243 which

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:08.430 
129 plus 6550 three times 243 which
resolves<00:04:04.750> to<00:04:04.810> 1<00:04:05.560> plus<00:04:06.220> a<00:04:06.400> 33,000<00:04:07.240> and<00:04:07.360> 24<00:04:07.750> plus

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
resolves to 1 plus a 33,000 and 24 plus

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:15.150 
resolves to 1 plus a 33,000 and 24 plus
50<00:04:08.890> million<00:04:09.750> 935,000<00:04:12.780> 248<00:04:13.780> and<00:04:14.080> in<00:04:14.590> total<00:04:14.980> this

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
50 million 935,000 248 and in total this

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.820 
50 million 935,000 248 and in total this
gives

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:16.830 
gives

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:20.210 
gives
15950<00:04:17.830> 8,000

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
15950 8,000

15950 8,000
273<00:04:21.220> which<00:04:21.670> is<00:04:21.790> the<00:04:21.910> final<00:04:22.270> value<00:04:22.360> that<00:04:22.600> we<00:04:22.690> can

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
273 which is the final value that we can

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:24.420 
273 which is the final value that we can
put<00:04:22.930> into<00:04:23.050> the<00:04:23.170> command<00:04:23.470> block<00:04:23.680> and<00:04:23.770> it's<00:04:24.160> also

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
put into the command block and it's also

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.210 
put into the command block and it's also
a<00:04:24.640> massive<00:04:25.090> number<00:04:25.480> which<00:04:25.630> is<00:04:25.840> painful<00:04:26.740> to<00:04:26.950> say

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
a massive number which is painful to say

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.770 
a massive number which is painful to say
out<00:04:27.340> loud

out loud

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.870 
out loud
however<00:04:28.780> I<00:04:29.080> also<00:04:30.070> want<00:04:30.370> to<00:04:30.400> give<00:04:30.550> you<00:04:30.580> a<00:04:30.700> little

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 
however I also want to give you a little

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.210 
however I also want to give you a little
intuition<00:04:31.120> to<00:04:31.750> how<00:04:31.930> this<00:04:32.080> actually<00:04:32.260> works<00:04:32.410> now

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 
intuition to how this actually works now

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:34.200 
intuition to how this actually works now
when<00:04:33.400> I<00:04:33.460> was<00:04:33.610> actually<00:04:33.700> trying<00:04:33.940> to<00:04:34.030> figure

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
when I was actually trying to figure

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.890 
when I was actually trying to figure
this<00:04:34.300> out<00:04:34.479> I<00:04:34.540> thought

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
this out I thought

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.230 
this out I thought
to<00:04:34.960> myself<00:04:35.259> how<00:04:35.500> I<00:04:35.850> personally<00:04:36.850> go<00:04:37.030> about

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
to myself how I personally go about

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.939 
to myself how I personally go about
bringing<00:04:37.660> three<00:04:37.930> numbers<00:04:38.229> together<00:04:38.380> without

00:04:38.939 --> 00:04:38.949 
bringing three numbers together without

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:41.790 
bringing three numbers together without
losing<00:04:39.430> any<00:04:39.639> of<00:04:39.759> the<00:04:39.850> data<00:04:40.150> well<00:04:41.080> I<00:04:41.320> would<00:04:41.770> just

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
losing any of the data well I would just

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.950 
losing any of the data well I would just
timed<00:04:42.190> once<00:04:42.430> than<00:04:42.580> by<00:04:42.699> a<00:04:42.729> thousand<00:04:43.210> another<00:04:43.750> by

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:43.960 
timed once than by a thousand another by

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.300 
timed once than by a thousand another by
a<00:04:43.990> million<00:04:44.410> and<00:04:44.500> then<00:04:44.770> just<00:04:44.949> add<00:04:45.070> them<00:04:45.190> all

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:45.310 
a million and then just add them all

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:47.430 
a million and then just add them all
together<00:04:45.460> meaning<00:04:46.360> that<00:04:46.570> the<00:04:46.750> first<00:04:46.780> three

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
together meaning that the first three

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.020 
together meaning that the first three
digit<00:04:47.830> who<00:04:47.979> represent<00:04:48.400> one<00:04:48.610> of<00:04:48.669> the<00:04:48.759> colors

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
digit who represent one of the colors

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:50.909 
digit who represent one of the colors
next<00:04:49.449> we<00:04:49.660> have<00:04:49.750> represent<00:04:50.199> another<00:04:50.470> and<00:04:50.830> the

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:50.919 
next we have represent another and the

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:53.370 
next we have represent another and the
lastly<00:04:51.280> we<00:04:51.520> represent<00:04:51.970> a<00:04:52.060> third<00:04:52.210> color<00:04:52.479> this

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:53.380 
lastly we represent a third color this

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.020 
lastly we represent a third color this
allow<00:04:53.650> me<00:04:53.830> to<00:04:53.949> use<00:04:54.009> my<00:04:54.220> knowledge<00:04:54.370> of<00:04:54.580> binary

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:57.180 
allow me to use my knowledge of binary
to<00:04:55.210> realize<00:04:55.479> this<00:04:55.630> exactly<00:04:56.410> what<00:04:56.650> the<00:04:56.770> formula

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
to realize this exactly what the formula

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:58.800 
to realize this exactly what the formula
is<00:04:57.220> doing<00:04:57.639> because<00:04:58.090> you're<00:04:58.360> probably<00:04:58.630> aware

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
is doing because you're probably aware

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:00.779 
is doing because you're probably aware
computers<00:04:59.650> use<00:04:59.800> binary<00:05:00.070> to<00:05:00.280> calculate<00:05:00.639> things

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:00.789 
computers use binary to calculate things

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:02.760 
computers use binary to calculate things
and<00:05:01.210> we<00:05:01.300> convert<00:05:01.660> things<00:05:01.870> in<00:05:01.990> the<00:05:02.080> binary<00:05:02.289> this

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:02.770 
and we convert things in the binary this

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:04.200 
and we convert things in the binary this
does<00:05:03.190> exactly<00:05:03.340> the<00:05:03.699> same<00:05:03.820> thing<00:05:03.970> as<00:05:04.060> before

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:04.210 
does exactly the same thing as before

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:05.700 
does exactly the same thing as before
but<00:05:04.750> that's<00:05:04.900> why<00:05:05.020> we<00:05:05.139> have<00:05:05.229> some<00:05:05.380> funky

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
but that's why we have some funky

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:08.010 
but that's why we have some funky
numbers<00:05:06.070> as<00:05:06.460> opposed<00:05:06.970> to<00:05:07.240> maybe<00:05:07.419> a<00:05:07.539> million

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020 
numbers as opposed to maybe a million

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.200 
numbers as opposed to maybe a million
and<00:05:08.440> a<00:05:08.530> hundred<00:05:08.860> thousand<00:05:09.250> because<00:05:09.639> binary

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
and a hundred thousand because binary

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.810 
and a hundred thousand because binary
just<00:05:10.449> uses<00:05:10.900> a<00:05:10.930> different<00:05:11.320> base<00:05:11.889> every<00:05:12.669> don't

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:12.820 
just uses a different base every don't

that don't worry yourself or you

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:18.900 
that don't worry yourself or you

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:20.710 
your color and how to use it in the

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:22.080 
your color and how to use it in the
formula<00:05:20.979> because<00:05:21.400> that's<00:05:21.550> really<00:05:21.850> the<00:05:21.970> most

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.090 
formula because that's really the most

it should be fairly straightforward up
until<00:05:34.419> the<00:05:34.690> part<00:05:35.020> where<00:05:35.289> you<00:05:35.380> get<00:05:35.530> to<00:05:35.590> the

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:46.150 
it are for long tags so as I'm sure you

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:47.939 
it are for long tags so as I'm sure you
remember<00:05:46.270> the<00:05:46.720> list<00:05:46.930> is<00:05:47.199> structured<00:05:47.680> within

00:05:47.939 --> 00:05:47.949 
remember the list is structured within

00:05:47.949 --> 00:05:49.860 
remember the list is structured within
square<00:05:48.400> brackets<00:05:48.880> and<00:05:49.030> the<00:05:49.240> elements<00:05:49.690> within

square brackets and the elements within
the<00:05:50.139> list<00:05:50.289> are<00:05:50.500> separated<00:05:51.010> by<00:05:51.130> commas<00:05:51.389> now<00:05:52.389> the

the list are separated by commas now the

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:54.570 
the list are separated by commas now the
way<00:05:53.020> you<00:05:53.080> do<00:05:53.289> this<00:05:53.440> is<00:05:53.680> after<00:05:54.039> the<00:05:54.130> explosion

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:54.580 
way you do this is after the explosion

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:56.460 
way you do this is after the explosion
you<00:05:54.610> put<00:05:54.820> a<00:05:54.849> semicolon<00:05:55.240> then<00:05:56.080> you<00:05:56.229> square

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:56.470 
you put a semicolon then you square

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:58.469 
you put a semicolon then you square
brackets<00:05:56.919> and<00:05:57.099> then<00:05:57.340> the<00:05:57.490> various<00:05:57.849> tags<00:05:58.210> with

00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:11.919 
thing I want to mention is the color tag

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:13.379 
thing I want to mention is the color tag
again<00:06:12.190> you're<00:06:12.520> never<00:06:12.639> gonna<00:06:12.849> hear<00:06:13.060> the<00:06:13.090> end<00:06:13.180> of

00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:13.389 
again you're never gonna hear the end of

00:06:13.389 --> 00:06:15.000 
again you're never gonna hear the end of
it<00:06:13.479> and<00:06:13.659> the<00:06:14.050> way<00:06:14.169> it's<00:06:14.349> structured<00:06:14.620> is<00:06:14.889> you

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:15.010 
it and the way it's structured is you

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:17.070 
it and the way it's structured is you
say<00:06:15.190> color<00:06:15.550> with<00:06:15.880> the<00:06:16.030> American<00:06:16.539> spelling<00:06:16.930> so

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:17.080 
say color with the American spelling so

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:18.960 
say color with the American spelling so
there's<00:06:17.229> no<00:06:17.320> u<00:06:17.380> in<00:06:17.590> it<00:06:17.830> then<00:06:18.370> you<00:06:18.400> put<00:06:18.580> a<00:06:18.610> colon

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:18.970 
there's no u in it then you put a colon

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:21.300 
there's no u in it then you put a colon
then<00:06:19.479> within<00:06:19.810> square<00:06:20.229> brackets<00:06:20.680> off<00:06:20.830> that<00:06:21.159> you

then within square brackets off that you

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:23.580 
then within square brackets off that you
have<00:06:21.340> the<00:06:21.849> color<00:06:22.180> values<00:06:22.570> you<00:06:22.960> found<00:06:23.229> using

have the color values you found using
the<00:06:23.620> formula<00:06:24.099> the<00:06:24.699> reason<00:06:24.970> it's<00:06:25.090> done<00:06:25.210> like

that<00:06:25.479> excuse<00:06:25.720> you<00:06:25.810> can<00:06:25.930> have<00:06:26.050> multiple<00:06:26.260> colors

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:26.710 
that excuse you can have multiple colors

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:28.500 
that excuse you can have multiple colors
in<00:06:26.979> the<00:06:27.099> same<00:06:27.280> firework<00:06:27.760> for<00:06:28.030> extra

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:28.510 
in the same firework for extra

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:31.350 
in the same firework for extra
customizable<00:06:29.440> effects<00:06:29.909> however<00:06:30.909> the<00:06:31.180> very

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:31.360 
customizable effects however the very

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:32.610 
customizable effects however the very
last<00:06:31.539> thing<00:06:31.780> I<00:06:31.840> want<00:06:32.020> to<00:06:32.110> touch<00:06:32.229> on<00:06:32.380> is<00:06:32.500> the

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:32.620 
last thing I want to touch on is the

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:34.080 
last thing I want to touch on is the
fact<00:06:32.740> that<00:06:32.860> a<00:06:32.949> firework<00:06:33.430> and<00:06:33.580> have<00:06:33.699> more<00:06:33.940> than

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:34.090 
fact that a firework and have more than

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:36.570 
fact that a firework and have more than
one<00:06:34.240> explosion<00:06:34.659> the<00:06:35.349> way<00:06:35.470> you<00:06:35.530> do<00:06:35.770> this<00:06:35.949> is<00:06:36.159> in

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:36.580 
one explosion the way you do this is in

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:38.010 
one explosion the way you do this is in
the<00:06:36.699> square<00:06:36.909> brackets<00:06:37.120> you<00:06:37.510> open<00:06:37.780> from<00:06:37.840> the

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:38.020 
the square brackets you open from the

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:39.510 
the square brackets you open from the
original<00:06:38.380> explosion<00:06:38.590> now<00:06:38.979> you<00:06:39.039> have<00:06:39.310> multiple

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:39.520 
original explosion now you have multiple

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:42.600 
original explosion now you have multiple
curly<00:06:40.270> bracket<00:06:40.750> data<00:06:41.139> tags<00:06:41.530> like<00:06:42.099> the<00:06:42.280> ones<00:06:42.430> we

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:42.610 
curly bracket data tags like the ones we

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:45.120 
curly bracket data tags like the ones we
had<00:06:42.760> before<00:06:43.320> however<00:06:44.320> that's<00:06:44.770> all<00:06:44.919> I'm<00:06:45.099> really

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:49.420 
remember if you want examples of the

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:50.670 
remember if you want examples of the
commands<00:06:49.720> that<00:06:49.870> I've<00:06:49.930> been<00:06:50.140> using<00:06:50.440> and

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:50.680 
commands that I've been using and

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:52.290 
commands that I've been using and
talking<00:06:51.070> about<00:06:51.280> and<00:06:51.730> have<00:06:51.880> a<00:06:51.910> look<00:06:52.090> at<00:06:52.210> the

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:52.300 
talking about and have a look at the

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:54.210 
talking about and have a look at the
video<00:06:52.570> description<00:06:52.750> for<00:06:53.560> a<00:06:53.620> link<00:06:53.680> to<00:06:53.890> a<00:06:53.980> bunch

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:54.220 
video description for a link to a bunch

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:55.410 
video description for a link to a bunch
of<00:06:54.310> example<00:06:54.760> commands<00:06:55.000> that<00:06:55.150> you<00:06:55.240> can<00:06:55.300> use

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:55.420 
of example commands that you can use

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:57.390 
of example commands that you can use
with<00:06:55.750> an<00:06:55.870> experiment<00:06:56.350> for<00:06:56.440> yourself<00:06:56.530> because

00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:57.400 
with an experiment for yourself because

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:59.670 
with an experiment for yourself because
personally<00:06:57.910> I<00:06:58.120> think<00:06:58.180> that<00:06:58.510> it<00:06:59.230> will<00:06:59.350> be<00:06:59.440> much

00:06:59.670 --> 00:06:59.680 
personally I think that it will be much

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.980 
personally I think that it will be much
easier<00:06:59.710> for<00:07:00.130> you<00:07:00.370> guys<00:07:00.400> to<00:07:00.610> actually<00:07:01.480> get<00:07:01.960> a

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:01.990 
easier for you guys to actually get a

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:03.780 
easier for you guys to actually get a
grasp<00:07:02.380> of<00:07:02.710> how<00:07:02.890> to<00:07:02.950> use<00:07:03.190> these<00:07:03.370> things<00:07:03.610> if<00:07:03.730> you

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:03.790 
grasp of how to use these things if you

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:06.030 
grasp of how to use these things if you
actually<00:07:03.970> see<00:07:04.420> the<00:07:04.570> command<00:07:04.900> lay<00:07:05.590> it<00:07:05.710> all<00:07:05.860> out

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:06.040 
actually see the command lay it all out

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:08.250 
actually see the command lay it all out
in<00:07:06.220> front<00:07:06.460> of<00:07:06.610> you<00:07:06.790> and<00:07:06.970> see<00:07:07.630> how<00:07:07.840> the<00:07:07.900> things

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:08.260 
in front of you and see how the things

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:09.870 
in front of you and see how the things
are<00:07:08.410> structured<00:07:08.680> so<00:07:09.310> that<00:07:09.340> you<00:07:09.520> can<00:07:09.670> sort<00:07:09.790> of

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:09.880 
are structured so that you can sort of

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:11.760 
are structured so that you can sort of
pick<00:07:10.120> it<00:07:10.240> out<00:07:10.330> yourself<00:07:10.390> and<00:07:10.900> see<00:07:10.990> how<00:07:11.620> it

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:11.770 
pick it out yourself and see how it

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:14.310 
pick it out yourself and see how it
works<00:07:12.040> so<00:07:12.910> if<00:07:13.390> you've<00:07:13.570> enjoyed<00:07:13.720> a<00:07:13.930> rate<00:07:14.170> you'll

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:14.320 
works so if you've enjoyed a rate you'll

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:15.570 
works so if you've enjoyed a rate you'll
