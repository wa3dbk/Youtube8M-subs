00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.100 
here shooting rockets at you and there's
a<00:03:55.940> Ledge<00:03:56.120> up<00:03:56.270> there<00:03:56.420> you<00:03:56.540> can't<00:03:56.720> reach<00:03:56.930> because

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110 
a Ledge up there you can't reach because

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:00.910 
a Ledge up there you can't reach because
you<00:03:57.320> can't<00:03:57.530> grab<00:03:57.770> onto<00:03:58.010> anything<00:03:58.510> what<00:03:59.920> what

the heck

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.310 
the heck
so<00:04:01.940> I<00:04:01.970> figure<00:04:02.240> I'd<00:04:02.360> let<00:04:02.570> this<00:04:02.690> thing<00:04:02.930> shoot<00:04:03.170> me

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:03.320

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:05.630 
up onto there that worked but still

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.030

supposed<00:04:07.310> to<00:04:07.370> do<00:04:07.550> I<00:04:07.910> don't<00:04:08.420> know<00:04:08.570> that<00:04:09.500> was<00:04:09.620> the

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
supposed to do I don't know that was the

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.070 
supposed to do I don't know that was the
most<00:04:09.709> frustrating<00:04:10.520> moment<00:04:10.790> of<00:04:10.850> my<00:04:10.970> life

most frustrating moment of my life
honestly<00:04:12.080> I<00:04:13.239> guess<00:04:14.239> I'm<00:04:14.420> supposed<00:04:14.660> to<00:04:14.690> go<00:04:14.810> back

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:15.020

honestly I guess I'm supposed to go back
track<00:04:15.320> in<00:04:15.440> the<00:04:15.530> levels<00:04:15.830> or<00:04:15.950> something<00:04:16.250> I<00:04:16.370> don't

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
track in the levels or something I don't

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:18.460 
track in the levels or something I don't
know<00:04:16.700> was<00:04:17.269> I<00:04:17.390> supposed<00:04:17.600> to<00:04:17.630> have<00:04:17.750> the<00:04:17.810> keycard

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470

I<00:04:18.500> don't<00:04:19.190> know<00:04:19.870> you<00:04:20.870> have<00:04:20.989> the<00:04:21.079> game<00:04:21.230> is<00:04:21.380> hard

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
I don't know you have the game is hard

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.260 
I don't know you have the game is hard
sometimes<00:04:21.799> it<00:04:22.550> makes<00:04:22.730> you<00:04:22.820> have<00:04:23.000> to<00:04:23.120> have<00:04:23.240> a

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
sometimes it makes you have to have a

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.950 
sometimes it makes you have to have a
strategy

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
strategy

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.020 
strategy
I<00:04:24.140> like<00:04:24.530> that<00:04:24.680> negate<00:04:25.070> I<00:04:25.280> like<00:04:25.520> it<00:04:25.640> when<00:04:25.760> a<00:04:25.790> game

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
I like that negate I like it when a game

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:28.480 
I like that negate I like it when a game
makes<00:04:26.330> you<00:04:26.390> have<00:04:26.570> to<00:04:26.720> think<00:04:27.020> it's<00:04:27.919> really<00:04:28.010> fun

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 
makes you have to think it's really fun

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:30.610 
makes you have to think it's really fun
but<00:04:28.880> sometimes<00:04:29.300> it's<00:04:29.480> hard<00:04:29.540> for<00:04:29.960> the<00:04:30.380> wrong

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 
but sometimes it's hard for the wrong

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.560 
but sometimes it's hard for the wrong
reasons<00:04:31.190> sometimes<00:04:31.580> I<00:04:31.880> get<00:04:32.030> lost<00:04:32.240> and<00:04:32.419> don't

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
reasons sometimes I get lost and don't

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:33.400 
reasons sometimes I get lost and don't

some points and it could get a little
confusing<00:05:30.260> and<00:05:30.500> frustrating<00:05:30.770> since<00:05:31.430> you<00:05:31.550> have
