00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 Hello dear friends to you today 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.089
 I'll tell you how to make a video bank light 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.250
 Dr. Bieber is no longer useful for me 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.349
 because I originally wanted to cook 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.130
 of her reflector but now 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.130
 do without him 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.490
 I will use a power LED 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.800
 3 watts 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.930
 200 lumens of light output and 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.809
 700 milliamp LED is consumed 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:35.059
 the most important parameter of the photo and 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:36.530
 filming is color temperature 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:39.410
 because it depends on him 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.390
 white balance for clarity suggested 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.520
 scale on which is demonstrated 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.410
 how much does the color change 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.150
 coloring the image when changing 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.010
 color temperature lighting 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.870
 actually value which is necessary 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.630
 strive is of course natural 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:56.540
 white color when white color is visually 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:58.579
 it looks white they are yellow or blue 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.710
 Of course there is a separate case when 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:02.420
 I need to style the image, but I 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.810
 I think that this should be done on the post 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:08.330
 processing and when shooting images 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.979
 should be as natural as possible 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.990
 on professional light 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:14.990
 equipment is possible 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.700
 color temperature changes but we 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.619
 we will not have such an opportunity 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.630
 just better choose LED with 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:22.850
 temperature a little more than 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.009
 natural white color and stay at 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.140
 interval that's 4 and a half to five with 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:29.030
 half thousand kelvin and here is my 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.450
 personal example now the lighting is coming from 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.450
 window 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:35.119
 the white anthem on the left has a picture from 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.160
 incandescent and right here 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:38.050
 led downlight with cold 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.490
 shade 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.530
 for me for some reason the most difficult here 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.310
 step was to find a case for my 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.890
 homemade 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.050
 I bought one for $ 100 black 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.300
 colors of suitable sizes I never 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.700
 found so I had to take white 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:55.700
 he has this dented plane 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.530
 where the plate fits perfectly 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.720
 will play the role of a radiator for 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.270
 cooling plate plate i 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.310
 I will make from a piece of aluminum 2 thick 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.310
 millimeter internet I found information 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:10.250
 that for 1 watt the power of the LED should 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.260
 have about 25-30 square 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.630
 centimeters square and radiator 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.090
 LED on the plate secured of course 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.610
 through thermopaste for my purposes it is important 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:22.890
 for the light to be scattered by the point 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:25.560
 to shade more precisely the contours of shadows had 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.300
 and soft smoothed character i took 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.670
 LED bulbs 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.160
 but to fix it on the body i 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.530
 used my favorite caps from 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.840
 cool they are not exactly one cap for 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.220
 this made a hole like this 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.410
 hexagon 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.270
 and bolted to the plate and 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.890
 the shell will be powered by a lantern 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.020
 lithium ion battery can 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.940
 use almost any one i took from 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.100
 Nokii per thousand milliamps and when bought 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.890
 on ebay here is such a charging module for 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.239
 1 dollar just connect directly 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.370
 it goes no batteries need 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.640
 limit current resistor for this purpose 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.440
 also not suitable because at least 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.750
 battery discharge then brightness drops 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.910
 the stars accordingly too therefore 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.860
 the same ebay for only 100 rubles I 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.190
 I bought 5 of these microcircuits 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.000
 LED power drivers 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:15.000
 called a microcircuit 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.610
 and mc 7135 can also be found under 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.700
 name ale 7135 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:23.310
 circuit for extremely simple 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.110
 one chip provides 350 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.329
 milliamperes stable current this 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.920
 corresponds to 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:31.350
 consumes 1 wadded LED but 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.980
 us 3 wadded LED it consumes 700 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.920
 milliampere 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.750
 so to build a driver for 700 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.269
 milliampere respectively need just 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:42.000
 just connect the chips in parallel 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:44.910
 Two things we guessed output 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.890
 current can be increased multiple of 3 150 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:49.470
 milliampere just connecting 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.239
 parallel to the chip but if you put 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.340
 breaker in the circuit 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:55.079
 realize two brightness modes 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:57.329
 the LED closes opening it to receive 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:58.200
 either one hundred percent light or about 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:00.650
 equal to half 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:04.110
 I collected the driver in the collective farm way 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:06.000
 let's say so did not rule the boards cut out 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.269
 a cutter track inside the case 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.370
 put it this way 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:14.569
 stuck on the glue through the bar 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:18.079
 wood just cut a hole for 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:20.120
 mini-usb connector for two switches 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:23.120
 one of which includes power a 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.800
 another changes the brightness mode but it 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.960
 already later frames here already 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.449
 the battery is installed I fixed it on 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:32.240
 double-sided tape and as shown 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:34.810
 practice you can install any 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:38.210
 battery packs that have similar 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:39.860
 The connection method is the connector on 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.930
 charging controller there are two LEDs 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:44.389
 which signals the end 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:46.699
 charging them outside I haven't taken out my hands yet 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:48.830
 this did not happen unfortunately but in general 

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:51.620
 video light can be considered complete 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:54.080
 he works and copes with 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:56.990
 your task is to demonstrate how you work 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:05:00.280
 see a little bit later on like this 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:02.479
 switch brightness modes and only 2 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:04.400
 350 and 700 milliamps 

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:06.320
 well friends it is necessary that I wanted 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:09.080
 tell you today subscribe to 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:12.729
 channel and then see the demonstration 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.729
 video light works as promised 

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.130
 and
