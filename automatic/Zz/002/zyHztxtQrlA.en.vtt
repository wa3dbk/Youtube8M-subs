game play and designing for the game you

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.950 
game play and designing for the game you
have<00:01:47.610> to<00:01:47.640> account<00:01:48.060> for<00:01:48.210> that<00:01:48.480> the<00:01:48.600> fact<00:01:48.840> that

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.050 
players can transform at any time so we

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:53.810 
players can transform at any time so we
on<00:01:52.140> put<00:01:52.350> one<00:01:52.530> moment<00:01:52.890> maybe<00:01:53.010> transform<00:01:53.550> into<00:01:53.700> a
