00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
Reese not really a nice barrier but has

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.800 
Reese not really a nice barrier but has
a<00:02:01.140> good<00:02:01.410> effect<00:02:01.500> and<00:02:02.780> she's<00:02:03.780> a<00:02:04.110> good<00:02:04.350> tuner

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810

a good effect and she's a good tuner
medium<00:02:06.810> I<00:02:07.099> considering<00:02:08.099> taking<00:02:08.399> her<00:02:08.670> out<00:02:08.849> but

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
medium I considering taking her out but

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.940 
medium I considering taking her out but
the<00:02:09.360> reason<00:02:09.509> why<00:02:09.780> I'm<00:02:09.929> still<00:02:10.229> keeping<00:02:10.440> her<00:02:10.769> in

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
the reason why I'm still keeping her in

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.130 
the reason why I'm still keeping her in
is<00:02:11.220> because<00:02:11.460> she<00:02:11.940> could<00:02:12.090> still<00:02:12.420> be<00:02:12.480> special

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
is because she could still be special

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.370 
is because she could still be special
summoned<00:02:13.170> by<00:02:13.620> her<00:02:13.800> effect<00:02:14.160> so<00:02:15.000> that's<00:02:15.330> why<00:02:15.570> on

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
summoned by her effect so that's why on

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.550 
summoned by her effect so that's why on
still<00:02:16.590> keeping<00:02:16.920> her<00:02:16.950> and<00:02:17.280> I<00:02:17.370> rarely<00:02:17.610> draw<00:02:17.970> her

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
still keeping her and I rarely draw her

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.500 
still keeping her and I rarely draw her
spell<00:02:19.560> breaker<00:02:19.800> I'm<00:02:20.160> if<00:02:20.520> he<00:02:20.700> on<00:02:20.820> keeping<00:02:21.270> her

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
spell breaker I'm if he on keeping her

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.620 
spell breaker I'm if he on keeping her
but<00:02:21.840> I<00:02:22.290> guess<00:02:23.010> she's<00:02:23.400> just<00:02:23.490> good<00:02:23.910> because<00:02:24.270> of

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
but I guess she's just good because of

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.930 
but I guess she's just good because of
her<00:02:24.810> high<00:02:25.280> 2000<00:02:26.280> defense<00:02:27.210> and<00:02:28.790> who<00:02:29.790> knows

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
her high 2000 defense and who knows

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.990 
her high 2000 defense and who knows
maybe<00:02:30.000> I'll<00:02:31.040> need<00:02:32.040> her<00:02:32.250> effect<00:02:32.580> one<00:02:32.790> day<00:02:32.970> I

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
maybe I'll need her effect one day I

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.250 
maybe I'll need her effect one day I
guess<00:02:33.300> it<00:02:33.870> already<00:02:34.290> happened<00:02:34.500> once<00:02:35.150> pilgrim

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
guess it already happened once pilgrim

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
Gungor near here gunga near you pitch to

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.330 
Gungor near here gunga near you pitch to
ice<00:02:59.370> barriers<00:03:00.200> caravan<00:03:01.200> you<00:03:01.650> pit<00:03:01.950> you<00:03:02.130> put

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
ice barriers caravan you pit you put

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.550 
ice barriers caravan you pit you put
them<00:03:02.430> back<00:03:02.640> into<00:03:02.850> the<00:03:03.060> deck<00:03:03.240> the<00:03:03.930> only<00:03:04.230> if<00:03:04.410> be

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
them back into the deck the only if be

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.890 
them back into the deck the only if be
part<00:03:04.800> is<00:03:04.980> that<00:03:05.010> your<00:03:05.820> opponent<00:03:06.120> draws<00:03:06.480> a<00:03:06.510> card

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
part is that your opponent draws a card

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.250 
part is that your opponent draws a card
but<00:03:07.650> if<00:03:07.830> you're<00:03:08.010> going<00:03:08.490> to<00:03:08.640> do<00:03:08.760> really<00:03:09.150> well<00:03:09.330> by

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
but if you're going to do really well by

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.160 
but if you're going to do really well by
using<00:03:11.220> this<00:03:11.520> combination<00:03:12.240> I<00:03:12.420> probably

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
using this combination I probably

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:18.440 
using this combination I probably
wouldn't<00:03:13.590> worry<00:03:13.770> about<00:03:13.860> it<00:03:14.070> so<00:03:14.340> much<00:03:17.450> yeah

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
wouldn't worry about it so much yeah

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.860 
wouldn't worry about it so much yeah
that<00:03:18.890> general<00:03:19.890> grenard<00:03:20.310> you<00:03:20.970> always<00:03:21.480> need<00:03:21.720> the

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
that general grenard you always need the

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.460 
that general grenard you always need the
general<00:03:22.260> um<00:03:23.360> basically<00:03:24.360> the<00:03:25.020> main<00:03:25.200> goal<00:03:25.440> of

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
general um basically the main goal of

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.470 
general um basically the main goal of
ice<00:03:25.710> barriers<00:03:26.130> is<00:03:26.370> to<00:03:26.550> bring<00:03:26.700> three<00:03:27.090> generals

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
ice barriers is to bring three generals

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.070 
ice barriers is to bring three generals
but<00:03:27.750> dollar<00:03:28.080> tour<00:03:28.410> yet<00:03:29.100> do<00:03:29.970> dark<00:03:30.330> great

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
but dollar tour yet do dark great

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:36.790 
but dollar tour yet do dark great
combination<00:03:31.680> with<00:03:31.920> cryomancer<00:03:32.520> and<00:03:34.100> I

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:36.800 
combination with cryomancer and I

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.860 
combination with cryomancer and I
basically<00:03:37.800> made<00:03:38.130> a<00:03:38.610> second<00:03:39.030> ice<00:03:39.180> barrier<00:03:39.570> deck

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
basically made a second ice barrier deck

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:48.020 
basically made a second ice barrier deck
out<00:03:40.080> of<00:03:40.260> my<00:03:40.380> doubles<00:03:42.620> and<00:03:43.620> I<00:03:44.160> call<00:03:44.610> it<00:03:44.640> a<00:03:47.030> frog

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
out of my doubles and I call it a frog

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.880 
out of my doubles and I call it a frog
barriers<00:03:48.480> I'm<00:03:48.720> using<00:03:49.320> toad<00:03:50.959> frogs<00:03:51.959> and<00:03:52.410> ice

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
barriers I'm using toad frogs and ice

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.010 
barriers I'm using toad frogs and ice
barriers<00:03:53.430> I'm<00:03:53.730> going<00:03:53.970> to<00:03:54.030> use<00:03:54.150> the<00:03:54.390> wetlands

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:55.020 
barriers I'm going to use the wetlands

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:58.100 
barriers I'm going to use the wetlands
do<00:03:55.680> it<00:03:55.800> our<00:03:55.950> combo<00:03:56.400> where<00:03:57.240> do<00:03:57.660> door<00:03:57.900> could

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
do it our combo where do door could

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:05.750 
do it our combo where do door could
attack<00:03:58.410> directly<00:03:58.830> for<00:04:01.070> 24<00:04:02.070> um<00:04:02.690> yep<00:04:04.640> let's<00:04:05.640> move

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
attack directly for 24 um yep let's move

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.590 
attack directly for 24 um yep let's move
on<00:04:05.970> to<00:04:06.200> spells<00:04:07.670> three<00:04:08.670> magic<00:04:09.030> triangles<00:04:09.480> of

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
on to spells three magic triangles of

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.630 
on to spells three magic triangles of
the<00:04:09.660> ice<00:04:09.900> barriers<00:04:10.350> on<00:04:10.620> considering<00:04:11.370> taking

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
the ice barriers on considering taking

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.870 
the ice barriers on considering taking
it<00:04:11.940> one<00:04:12.120> or<00:04:12.270> two<00:04:12.420> but<00:04:12.780> since<00:04:13.260> it's<00:04:13.470> a<00:04:13.880> really

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
it one or two but since it's a really

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.760 
it one or two but since it's a really
good<00:04:15.120> card<00:04:15.360> blows<00:04:15.750> up<00:04:15.959> something<00:04:16.380> and<00:04:16.530> it's

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:16.770 
good card blows up something and it's

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:19.370 
good card blows up something and it's
swarms<00:04:17.280> and<00:04:17.540> that's<00:04:18.540> the<00:04:18.660> reason<00:04:18.750> why<00:04:18.959> I<00:04:19.049> have

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
swarms and that's the reason why I have

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.710 
swarms and that's the reason why I have
so<00:04:19.890> many<00:04:20.100> ice<00:04:20.370> barriers<00:04:20.880> with<00:04:21.299> different

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
so many ice barriers with different

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.410 
so many ice barriers with different
names<00:04:21.870> it<00:04:22.650> just<00:04:23.310> makes<00:04:23.490> it<00:04:23.610> really<00:04:23.820> good

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:26.420 

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:29.080
