00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:05.390 
hey guys my name is Betty mio and today
I<00:00:03.149> decided<00:00:03.689> to<00:00:03.929> try<00:00:04.140> something<00:00:04.170> out<00:00:04.680> a<00:00:04.859> little

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
I decided to try something out a little

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.860 
I decided to try something out a little
different<00:00:05.819> a<00:00:05.940> while<00:00:06.240> back<00:00:06.270> when<00:00:06.750> you

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
different a while back when you

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.500 
different a while back when you
recommended<00:00:07.529> or<00:00:07.710> challenged<00:00:08.400> me<00:00:08.610> to<00:00:08.820> never

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
recommended or challenged me to never

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.200 
recommended or challenged me to never
reload<00:00:10.110> my<00:00:10.500> weapons<00:00:10.950> ever<00:00:11.250> and<00:00:11.790> the<00:00:11.880> only<00:00:12.030> way

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
reload my weapons ever and the only way

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.150 
reload my weapons ever and the only way
for<00:00:12.389> me<00:00:12.420> to<00:00:12.509> get<00:00:12.599> more<00:00:12.780> ammunition<00:00:13.139> was<00:00:13.980> to

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
for me to get more ammunition was to

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.070 
for me to get more ammunition was to
pick<00:00:14.340> up<00:00:14.490> pick<00:00:14.849> up<00:00:14.940> another<00:00:15.210> gun<00:00:15.480> off<00:00:15.690> of<00:00:15.960> the

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
pick up pick up another gun off of the

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.109 
pick up pick up another gun off of the
ground<00:00:16.260> and<00:00:16.619> even<00:00:16.859> if<00:00:16.980> that<00:00:17.010> only<00:00:17.430> had<00:00:17.699> two<00:00:17.970> to

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
ground and even if that only had two to

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.880 
ground and even if that only had two to
three<00:00:18.300> rounds<00:00:18.690> in<00:00:18.779> it<00:00:18.869> I<00:00:19.050> still<00:00:19.619> couldn't

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
three rounds in it I still couldn't

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.320 
three rounds in it I still couldn't
reload<00:00:20.250> it<00:00:20.369> and<00:00:20.490> I'd<00:00:20.550> have<00:00:20.730> to<00:00:20.850> switch<00:00:21.029> on<00:00:21.150> over

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
reload it and I'd have to switch on over

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.000 
reload it and I'd have to switch on over
to<00:00:21.480> their<00:00:21.600> secondary<00:00:22.080> to<00:00:22.289> find<00:00:22.560> my<00:00:22.740> next

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
to their secondary to find my next

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.130 
to their secondary to find my next
victim<00:00:23.160> and<00:00:23.490> then<00:00:23.789> hopefully<00:00:24.029> pick<00:00:24.779> up<00:00:24.960> their

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
victim and then hopefully pick up their

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.620 
victim and then hopefully pick up their
primary<00:00:25.619> which<00:00:25.859> would<00:00:26.039> have<00:00:26.220> more<00:00:27.060> than<00:00:27.330> just

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
primary which would have more than just

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.900 
primary which would have more than just
a<00:00:27.750> couple<00:00:27.900> of<00:00:28.109> bullets<00:00:28.380> and<00:00:28.670> initially<00:00:29.670> going

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
a couple of bullets and initially going

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.220 
a couple of bullets and initially going
into<00:00:30.060> this<00:00:30.150> I<00:00:30.449> thought<00:00:30.630> this<00:00:30.779> would<00:00:30.960> be<00:00:30.990> a<00:00:31.080> lot

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
into this I thought this would be a lot

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.590 
into this I thought this would be a lot
of<00:00:31.260> fun<00:00:31.380> and<00:00:31.710> it<00:00:32.279> was<00:00:32.309> I<00:00:32.610> mean<00:00:32.759> there<00:00:33.090> was<00:00:33.239> a<00:00:33.270> lot

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
of fun and it was I mean there was a lot

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.150 
of fun and it was I mean there was a lot
of<00:00:33.630> cool<00:00:33.930> moments<00:00:34.380> trying<00:00:34.590> to<00:00:34.649> find<00:00:34.800> gameplay

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
of cool moments trying to find gameplay

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.310 
of cool moments trying to find gameplay
for<00:00:35.370> this<00:00:35.489> but<00:00:36.149> it<00:00:36.239> was<00:00:36.360> also<00:00:36.600> extremely

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
for this but it was also extremely

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.590 
for this but it was also extremely
difficult<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:38.700> one<00:00:38.879> of<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.030> reasons<00:00:39.329> why<00:00:39.540> it

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
difficult and one of the reasons why it

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.799 
difficult and one of the reasons why it
was<00:00:40.170> so<00:00:40.410> hard<00:00:40.620> is<00:00:40.860> that<00:00:41.219> when<00:00:41.730> you<00:00:41.940> do<00:00:42.180> go<00:00:42.600> pick

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
was so hard is that when you do go pick

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.080 
was so hard is that when you do go pick
up<00:00:42.899> someone<00:00:43.170> else's<00:00:43.230> gun<00:00:43.680> a<00:00:43.920> lot<00:00:44.640> of<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.820> times

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
up someone else's gun a lot of the times

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.729 
up someone else's gun a lot of the times
it<00:00:45.360> only<00:00:45.480> had<00:00:45.719> a<00:00:45.750> couple<00:00:45.840> of<00:00:46.230> rounds<00:00:46.530> in<00:00:46.649> it

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
it only had a couple of rounds in it

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.440 
it only had a couple of rounds in it
when<00:00:46.980> I<00:00:47.010> was<00:00:47.280> getting<00:00:47.460> into<00:00:47.700> fire<00:00:47.969> fights<00:00:48.270> with

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
when I was getting into fire fights with

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.299 
when I was getting into fire fights with
people<00:00:48.480> they<00:00:49.230> were<00:00:49.289> firing<00:00:49.710> back<00:00:50.070> I<00:00:50.100> mean

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
people they were firing back I mean

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:51.650 
people they were firing back I mean
that's<00:00:50.460> just<00:00:50.610> kind<00:00:50.789> of<00:00:50.850> how<00:00:50.910> firefight

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
that's just kind of how firefight

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.660 
that's just kind of how firefight
firefights<00:00:52.230> work<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:52.739> then<00:00:53.129> when<00:00:53.309> I<00:00:53.340> finally

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
firefights work and then when I finally

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.119 
firefights work and then when I finally
was<00:00:54.090> able<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.690> kill<00:00:54.899> them<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:55.289> run<00:00:55.680> over<00:00:55.710> to

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
was able to kill them and run over to

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.189 
was able to kill them and run over to
their<00:00:56.370> you<00:00:56.640> know<00:00:56.670> their<00:00:56.760> corpse<00:00:57.539> their<00:00:57.780> their

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
their you know their corpse their their

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.680 
their you know their corpse their their
carcass<00:00:58.590> I<00:00:58.800> would<00:00:59.340> pick<00:00:59.640> up<00:00:59.670> their<00:01:00.059> gun<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:00.570> it

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
carcass I would pick up their gun and it

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.569 
carcass I would pick up their gun and it
would<00:01:01.109> only<00:01:01.260> have<00:01:01.590> a<00:01:01.620> couple<00:01:01.829> of<00:01:02.129> rounds<00:01:02.430> left

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
would only have a couple of rounds left

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.340 
would only have a couple of rounds left
in<00:01:02.730> it<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:03.000> so<00:01:03.120> I<00:01:03.149> would<00:01:03.300> either<00:01:03.750> have<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:04.170> make

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
in it and so I would either have to make

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.770 
in it and so I would either have to make
do<00:01:04.589> with<00:01:05.040> using<00:01:05.610> only<00:01:05.760> ten<00:01:06.119> bullets<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.630> take

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
do with using only ten bullets to take

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.990 
do with using only ten bullets to take
out<00:01:06.900> my<00:01:06.930> next<00:01:07.080> target<00:01:07.409> or<00:01:07.680> switch<00:01:08.400> on<00:01:08.549> over<00:01:08.850> to

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
out my next target or switch on over to

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.179 
out my next target or switch on over to
their<00:01:09.119> secondary<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:09.900> that's<00:01:10.290> where<00:01:10.619> things

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
their secondary and that's where things

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.710 
their secondary and that's where things
really<00:01:11.520> start<00:01:11.939> to<00:01:12.030> get<00:01:12.150> interesting<00:01:12.330> because

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
really start to get interesting because

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.390 
really start to get interesting because
people<00:01:13.350> would<00:01:13.530> run<00:01:13.740> with<00:01:13.950> some<00:01:14.159> pretty

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
people would run with some pretty

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.999 
people would run with some pretty
interesting<00:01:15.150> secondaries<00:01:16.049> that<00:01:16.290> usually

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
interesting secondaries that usually

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.649 
interesting secondaries that usually
aren't<00:01:17.189> very<00:01:17.400> good<00:01:17.520> for<00:01:18.000> finishing<00:01:18.420> off

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
aren't very good for finishing off

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.080 
aren't very good for finishing off
someone<00:01:19.049> from<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.530> hundred<00:01:19.830> percent<00:01:20.070> 20<00:01:20.820> and

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
someone from a hundred percent 20 and

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.990 
someone from a hundred percent 20 and
not<00:01:21.840> only<00:01:21.990> that<00:01:22.110> but<00:01:22.500> when<00:01:22.830> you<00:01:23.250> do<00:01:23.490> play<00:01:23.790> like

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
not only that but when you do play like

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.210 
not only that but when you do play like
this<00:01:24.180> you're<00:01:24.450> always<00:01:24.479> having<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.500> be<00:01:25.860> very

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
this you're always having to be very

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.920 
this you're always having to be very
aggressive<00:01:26.580> you're<00:01:26.939> always<00:01:27.180> having<00:01:27.450> to<00:01:27.630> move

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
aggressive you're always having to move

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.560 
aggressive you're always having to move
from<00:01:28.439> from<00:01:29.159> place<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.549> place<00:01:29.579> to<00:01:29.970> find<00:01:30.210> more

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
from from place to place to find more

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.510 
from from place to place to find more
ammunition<00:01:31.020> and<00:01:31.470> when<00:01:31.740> you<00:01:31.920> do<00:01:32.100> that<00:01:32.369> you

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
ammunition and when you do that you

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.580 
ammunition and when you do that you
leave<00:01:32.759> yourself<00:01:32.880> exposed<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:33.810> lot<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:34.200> i

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
leave yourself exposed a lot and i

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.280 
leave yourself exposed a lot and i
notice<00:01:34.979> that<00:01:35.009> i<00:01:35.220> never<00:01:36.210> really<00:01:36.630> play<00:01:36.900> this

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
notice that i never really play this

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.039 
notice that i never really play this
aggressively<00:01:37.829> when<00:01:38.310> I<00:01:38.549> normally<00:01:39.270> play<00:01:39.450> the

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
aggressively when I normally play the

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.660 
aggressively when I normally play the
game<00:01:40.229> I<00:01:40.470> mean<00:01:40.650> I'm<00:01:40.770> kind<00:01:41.159> of<00:01:41.250> playing<00:01:41.490> a<00:01:41.579> little

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
game I mean I'm kind of playing a little

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.280 
game I mean I'm kind of playing a little
bit<00:01:41.850> more<00:01:41.970> passively<00:01:42.509> I'm<00:01:42.810> kind<00:01:43.079> of<00:01:43.140> in<00:01:43.259> the

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
bit more passively I'm kind of in the

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.160 
bit more passively I'm kind of in the
backfield<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:43.979> I<00:01:44.490> feel<00:01:45.030> like<00:01:45.060> I<00:01:45.240> myself<00:01:45.840> am

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
backfield and I feel like I myself am

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.109 
backfield and I feel like I myself am
more<00:01:46.409> of<00:01:46.500> an<00:01:46.590> aggressive<00:01:46.710> player<00:01:47.220> but<00:01:47.729> not<00:01:47.909> to

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
more of an aggressive player but not to

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.030 
more of an aggressive player but not to
the<00:01:48.210> extent<00:01:48.600> that<00:01:48.750> I<00:01:48.899> had<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.409> in<00:01:49.649> today's

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
the extent that I had to in today's

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.859 
the extent that I had to in today's
video<00:01:50.220> because<00:01:50.729> if<00:01:51.149> you<00:01:51.299> do<00:01:51.420> see<00:01:51.630> a<00:01:51.659> couple

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
video because if you do see a couple

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.749 
video because if you do see a couple
people<00:01:52.140> off<00:01:52.470> in<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.710> distance<00:01:52.860> you're<00:01:53.610> gonna

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
people off in the distance you're gonna

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.340 
people off in the distance you're gonna
take<00:01:54.149> some<00:01:54.329> pot<00:01:54.540> shots<00:01:54.840> at<00:01:54.960> them<00:01:55.110> you're<00:01:55.229> going

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
take some pot shots at them you're going

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.690 
take some pot shots at them you're going
to<00:01:55.409> try<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.560> see<00:01:55.799> if<00:01:55.950> you<00:01:56.040> can<00:01:56.189> take<00:01:56.340> them<00:01:56.549> out

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
to try to see if you can take them out

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.399 
to try to see if you can take them out
you're<00:01:56.850> going<00:01:56.969> to<00:01:57.030> try<00:01:57.240> and<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:57.600> maybe

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
you're going to try and and maybe

00:01:58.409 --> 00:01:59.870 
you're going to try and and maybe
Whittle<00:01:58.740> them<00:01:58.770> down<00:01:58.950> and<00:01:59.340> so<00:01:59.399> that<00:01:59.579> you<00:01:59.610> can

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
Whittle them down and so that you can

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.459 
Whittle them down and so that you can
maybe<00:02:00.149> push<00:02:00.420> up<00:02:00.600> a<00:02:00.630> little<00:02:00.780> bit<00:02:00.869> closer<00:02:01.079> and

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
maybe push up a little bit closer and

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.469 
maybe push up a little bit closer and
then<00:02:01.829> take<00:02:02.040> out<00:02:02.159> everyone<00:02:02.549> else<00:02:02.700> but<00:02:03.119> because

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
then take out everyone else but because

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.340 
then take out everyone else but because
i<00:02:03.810> only<00:02:04.380> had<00:02:04.979> what<00:02:05.520> was<00:02:05.670> in<00:02:05.909> my<00:02:06.140> primary<00:02:07.140> the

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
might that first magazine i didn't have

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.479 
might that first magazine i didn't have
that<00:02:09.840> luxury<00:02:09.869> you<00:02:10.440> know<00:02:10.530> i<00:02:10.560> could<00:02:10.890> maybe<00:02:11.069> try

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
that luxury you know i could maybe try

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.080 
that luxury you know i could maybe try
to<00:02:11.640> take<00:02:11.910> someone<00:02:12.180> out<00:02:12.270> a<00:02:12.330> disc

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
to take someone out a disc

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.990 
to take someone out a disc

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
myself I basically had to force myself

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.080

got me killed which you know doesn't

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.680 
got me killed which you know doesn't
happen<00:02:27.010> when<00:02:27.340> you<00:02:27.459> normally<00:02:27.670> play<00:02:28.090> battle<00:02:28.569> for

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
happen when you normally play battle for

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.320 
happen when you normally play battle for
three<00:02:28.900> and<00:02:29.440> not<00:02:30.099> only<00:02:30.340> that<00:02:30.549> but<00:02:30.849> something

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
three and not only that but something

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.030 
three and not only that but something
else<00:02:31.480> that<00:02:31.780> was<00:02:32.019> pretty<00:02:32.470> challenging<00:02:32.709> but

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
else that was pretty challenging but

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.280 
else that was pretty challenging but
also<00:02:33.190> kind<00:02:33.730> of<00:02:33.849> really<00:02:34.120> cool<00:02:34.269> about<00:02:34.390> this<00:02:34.720> was

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
also kind of really cool about this was

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.199 
also kind of really cool about this was
that<00:02:35.319> I<00:02:35.530> had<00:02:35.950> to<00:02:36.220> adapt<00:02:36.580> to<00:02:36.760> the<00:02:36.849> weapon<00:02:37.180> that

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
that I had to adapt to the weapon that

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.110 
that I had to adapt to the weapon that
people<00:02:37.870> were<00:02:38.140> dropping<00:02:38.620> I<00:02:38.980> people<00:02:39.580> were<00:02:39.730> using

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120

the infrared night vision scope a lot

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.820 
the infrared night vision scope a lot
more<00:02:42.340> than<00:02:43.120> I<00:02:43.150> would<00:02:43.810> ever<00:02:43.840> have<00:02:44.260> imagined<00:02:44.769> I

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
more than I would ever have imagined I

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.470 
more than I would ever have imagined I
picked<00:02:45.040> that<00:02:45.130> up<00:02:45.190> a<00:02:45.430> lot<00:02:45.670> people<00:02:46.239> were<00:02:46.329> also

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
picked that up a lot people were also

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.479 
picked that up a lot people were also
using<00:02:46.750> high<00:02:47.049> optic<00:02:47.500> scope<00:02:47.650> scopes<00:02:48.220> on

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
using high optic scope scopes on

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:50.789 
using high optic scope scopes on
close-quarter<00:02:49.120> maps<00:02:49.299> and<00:02:49.569> I<00:02:50.290> had<00:02:50.500> to<00:02:50.769> use

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:50.799 
close-quarter maps and I had to use

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:52.319 
close-quarter maps and I had to use
those<00:02:51.160> guns<00:02:51.400> I<00:02:51.549> couldn't<00:02:51.819> just<00:02:51.849> you<00:02:52.209> know

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:52.329 
those guns I couldn't just you know

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:53.670 
those guns I couldn't just you know
throw<00:02:52.540> it<00:02:52.720> on<00:02:52.810> the<00:02:52.900> ground<00:02:53.049> of<00:02:53.230> course<00:02:53.410> if<00:02:53.590> i

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
throw it on the ground of course if i

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.589 
throw it on the ground of course if i
did<00:02:53.860> find<00:02:54.130> another<00:02:54.400> weapon<00:02:54.610> that<00:02:55.209> was<00:02:55.360> right

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:55.599 
did find another weapon that was right

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:57.960 
did find another weapon that was right
next<00:02:55.720> by<00:02:55.930> i<00:02:55.959> would<00:02:56.500> pick<00:02:56.650> that<00:02:56.890> up<00:02:56.920> but<00:02:57.640> I<00:02:57.670> was

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
next by i would pick that up but I was

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:59.910 
next by i would pick that up but I was
just<00:02:58.090> I<00:02:58.209> couldn't<00:02:58.720> pick<00:02:58.840> and<00:02:59.049> choose<00:02:59.230> I<00:02:59.379> had<00:02:59.709> to

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
just I couldn't pick and choose I had to

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.250 
just I couldn't pick and choose I had to
use<00:03:00.069> the<00:03:00.099> weapon<00:03:00.700> that<00:03:00.849> they<00:03:01.450> dropped<00:03:01.810> and<00:03:02.079> it

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
use the weapon that they dropped and it

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.069 
use the weapon that they dropped and it
really<00:03:02.500> required<00:03:03.160> me<00:03:03.400> to<00:03:03.430> adapt<00:03:04.420> I<00:03:04.629> had<00:03:04.810> to

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:05.079 
really required me to adapt I had to

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:07.199 
really required me to adapt I had to
adjust<00:03:05.379> my<00:03:05.590> play<00:03:05.860> style<00:03:06.099> for<00:03:06.489> that<00:03:06.670> weapon<00:03:06.849> if

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
adjust my play style for that weapon if

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:09.569 
adjust my play style for that weapon if
it<00:03:07.690> was<00:03:07.900> a<00:03:07.930> gun<00:03:08.260> that<00:03:08.290> that<00:03:08.560> had<00:03:08.739> a<00:03:09.040> low<00:03:09.340> rate<00:03:09.519> of

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:09.579 
it was a gun that that had a low rate of

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:11.729 
it was a gun that that had a low rate of
fire<00:03:09.849> that<00:03:10.090> I<00:03:10.180> needed<00:03:10.360> to<00:03:10.480> make<00:03:10.569> sure<00:03:10.629> that<00:03:11.319> the

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
fire that I needed to make sure that the

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:13.800 
fire that I needed to make sure that the
person<00:03:11.890> or<00:03:12.280> my<00:03:12.430> next<00:03:12.700> target<00:03:12.879> was<00:03:13.180> at<00:03:13.390> least<00:03:13.569> at

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
person or my next target was at least at

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.539 
person or my next target was at least at
a<00:03:13.840> medium<00:03:14.290> distance<00:03:14.709> so<00:03:14.860> that<00:03:14.980> I<00:03:15.040> would<00:03:15.370> have

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:15.549 
a medium distance so that I would have

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:17.789 
a medium distance so that I would have
at<00:03:15.700> least<00:03:15.730> some<00:03:16.060> slight<00:03:16.480> advantage<00:03:16.690> or<00:03:17.139> if<00:03:17.620> I

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
at least some slight advantage or if I

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:19.770 
at least some slight advantage or if I
was<00:03:18.040> using<00:03:18.280> a<00:03:18.670> high<00:03:19.030> right<00:03:19.269> of<00:03:19.389> you<00:03:19.540> know<00:03:19.630> high

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
was using a high right of you know high

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.449 
was using a high right of you know high
rate<00:03:19.959> of<00:03:19.989> fire<00:03:20.109> then<00:03:20.709> play<00:03:20.950> a<00:03:20.980> little<00:03:21.190> bit<00:03:21.340> more

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
rate of fire then play a little bit more

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:23.759 
rate of fire then play a little bit more
aggressively<00:03:21.970> and<00:03:22.540> it<00:03:22.690> was<00:03:22.810> it<00:03:23.139> was<00:03:23.200> that<00:03:23.440> type

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:23.769 
aggressively and it was it was that type

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:26.640 
aggressively and it was it was that type
of<00:03:23.799> thought<00:03:24.579> process<00:03:25.150> that<00:03:25.329> was<00:03:25.870> not<00:03:26.410> only

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
of thought process that was not only

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.069 
of thought process that was not only
difficult<00:03:26.859> but<00:03:27.519> also<00:03:27.700> a<00:03:27.880> lot<00:03:28.359> of<00:03:28.599> fun<00:03:28.840> but

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:29.079 
difficult but also a lot of fun but

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:32.220 
difficult but also a lot of fun but
probably<00:03:29.950> the<00:03:30.459> coolest<00:03:30.880> aspect<00:03:31.720> of<00:03:31.870> this<00:03:32.019> is

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
probably the coolest aspect of this is

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.949 
probably the coolest aspect of this is
that<00:03:32.260> I<00:03:32.470> had<00:03:32.829> so<00:03:33.549> many<00:03:33.849> rambo<00:03:34.359> moments<00:03:34.750> where<00:03:34.930> I

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
that I had so many rambo moments where I

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:37.680 
that I had so many rambo moments where I
take<00:03:35.380> out<00:03:35.560> 12<00:03:36.400> targets<00:03:36.670> with<00:03:37.030> my<00:03:37.180> primary

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
take out 12 targets with my primary

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:39.330 
take out 12 targets with my primary
switching<00:03:38.079> over<00:03:38.139> to<00:03:38.260> my<00:03:38.349> secondary<00:03:38.829> take<00:03:39.190> out

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
switching over to my secondary take out

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.099 
switching over to my secondary take out
the<00:03:39.489> final<00:03:39.880> third<00:03:40.030> guy<00:03:40.269> pick<00:03:40.630> up<00:03:40.750> one<00:03:40.930> of<00:03:40.959> their

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:41.109 
the final third guy pick up one of their

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:42.930 
the final third guy pick up one of their
weapons<00:03:41.590> another<00:03:42.130> person<00:03:42.489> rounds<00:03:42.819> the<00:03:42.910> corner

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
weapons another person rounds the corner

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.479 
weapons another person rounds the corner
take<00:03:43.510> them<00:03:43.750> out<00:03:43.989> pick<00:03:44.380> up<00:03:44.530> their<00:03:44.709> gun<00:03:44.919> and<00:03:45.160> take

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:45.489 
take them out pick up their gun and take

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:47.909 
take them out pick up their gun and take
out<00:03:45.639> two<00:03:45.880> more<00:03:46.209> it<00:03:46.540> was<00:03:46.870> just<00:03:47.109> so<00:03:47.440> cool<00:03:47.859> to

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:47.919 
out two more it was just so cool to

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:50.550 
out two more it was just so cool to
never<00:03:48.459> have<00:03:48.790> to<00:03:48.819> reload<00:03:49.450> and<00:03:49.720> you<00:03:50.139> felt<00:03:50.410> like

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
never have to reload and you felt like

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.069 
never have to reload and you felt like
such<00:03:50.919> a<00:03:51.099> badass<00:03:51.519> when<00:03:52.120> those<00:03:52.419> moments<00:03:52.720> did

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:53.079 
such a badass when those moments did

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:54.449 
such a badass when those moments did
happen<00:03:53.319> they<00:03:53.620> didn't<00:03:53.799> happen<00:03:54.069> very<00:03:54.190> often

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
happen they didn't happen very often

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:55.949 
happen they didn't happen very often
because<00:03:54.790> of<00:03:55.120> all<00:03:55.269> the<00:03:55.450> other<00:03:55.569> stuff<00:03:55.660> I<00:03:55.930> just
