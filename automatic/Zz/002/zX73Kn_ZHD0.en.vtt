from<00:02:25.030> the<00:02:25.120> delt<00:02:26.069> and<00:02:27.069> just<00:02:27.430> open<00:02:28.060> up<00:02:28.150> and<00:02:28.330> try

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
from the delt and just open up and try

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:29.880 
from the delt and just open up and try
and<00:02:28.480> get<00:02:28.599> elbows<00:02:28.959> a<00:02:28.989> little<00:02:29.050> higher

and get elbows a little higher
yeah<00:02:30.730> great<00:02:30.970> there<00:02:31.180> how<00:02:31.510> often<00:02:32.080> would<00:02:32.290> you

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
yeah great there how often would you

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:33.839 
yeah great there how often would you
have<00:02:32.530> somebody<00:02:32.860> do<00:02:32.980> this<00:02:33.099> and<00:02:33.310> about<00:02:33.489> how<00:02:33.670> many

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:33.849 
have somebody do this and about how many

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:35.850 
have somebody do this and about how many
reps<00:02:34.150> would<00:02:34.330> you<00:02:34.420> have<00:02:34.510> them<00:02:34.599> do<00:02:34.780> a<00:02:35.170> lot<00:02:35.680> of<00:02:35.709> it

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
reps would you have them do a lot of it

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.550 
reps would you have them do a lot of it
would<00:02:35.920> depend<00:02:36.160> on<00:02:36.280> how<00:02:36.459> bad<00:02:37.390> the<00:02:37.420> design<00:02:38.349> is

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
would depend on how bad the design is

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.860 
would depend on how bad the design is
you<00:02:39.160> know<00:02:39.280> what<00:02:39.910> guys<00:02:40.060> if<00:02:40.360> they<00:02:40.510> can't<00:02:40.720> get

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
you know what guys if they can't get

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.630 
you know what guys if they can't get
their<00:02:41.019> hands<00:02:41.200> inside<00:02:41.470> the<00:02:41.530> colors<00:02:41.920> like<00:02:42.190> Jake

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
their hands inside the colors like Jake

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.850 
their hands inside the colors like Jake
and<00:02:42.670> myself<00:02:43.330> yeah<00:02:43.780> this<00:02:44.410> would<00:02:44.530> probably<00:02:44.620> be<00:02:44.799> a

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
and myself yeah this would probably be a

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.530 
and myself yeah this would probably be a
daily<00:02:45.099> thing<00:02:45.430> maybe<00:02:45.640> a<00:02:45.760> two<00:02:46.150> time<00:02:46.330> of<00:02:46.450> day

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
daily thing maybe a two time of day

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.990 
daily thing maybe a two time of day
thing<00:02:46.780> for<00:02:47.019> a<00:02:47.440> while<00:02:47.709> it's<00:02:47.890> 15<00:02:48.250> to<00:02:48.340> 20<00:02:48.579> reps<00:02:48.760> and

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
thing for a while it's 15 to 20 reps and

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.420 
thing for a while it's 15 to 20 reps and
then<00:02:49.569> as<00:02:49.750> you<00:02:49.989> kind<00:02:50.739> of<00:02:50.799> improve<00:02:51.190> your

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
then as you kind of improve your

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.250 
then as you kind of improve your
positioning<00:02:52.060> and<00:02:52.180> movement<00:02:52.239> with<00:02:52.660> it<00:02:52.810> they

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
positioning and movement with it they

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.890 
positioning and movement with it they
can<00:02:53.290> just<00:02:53.440> be<00:02:53.650> a<00:02:53.680> pre<00:02:53.950> squat<00:02:54.780> something<00:02:55.780> that
