go so I'm just gonna set it up to 200

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.649 
go so I'm just gonna set it up to 200
yeah<00:01:13.450> okay

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 
yeah okay

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.670 
want to turn without using your yoke you
can<00:01:21.640> head<00:01:22.640> it<00:01:22.820> so<00:01:23.150> it<00:01:23.240> goes<00:01:23.420> like<00:01:23.690> that<00:01:23.900> or<00:01:24.470> the

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
can head it so it goes like that or the

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.230 
can head it so it goes like that or the
other<00:01:24.710> way<00:01:25.010> around<00:01:25.190> and<00:01:25.670> you<00:01:25.729> can<00:01:25.760> see<00:01:25.940> on<00:01:26.210> your

other way around and you can see on your

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.390 
other way around and you can see on your
ethos<00:01:26.810> right<00:01:27.440> there<00:01:27.680> you<00:01:27.860> can<00:01:28.130> see<00:01:28.310> this

ethos right there you can see this

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.620 
ethos right there you can see this
purple<00:01:28.850> line<00:01:29.000> moving<00:01:29.299> around<00:01:30.760> so<00:01:31.760> the<00:01:32.420> next

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
purple line moving around so the next

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.300 
purple line moving around so the next
one<00:01:32.840> is<00:01:32.990> the<00:01:33.110> altitude<00:01:33.380> so<00:01:33.770> like<00:01:33.890> if<00:01:34.010> you<00:01:34.130> want

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
one is the altitude so like if you want

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.760 
one is the altitude so like if you want
to<00:01:34.430> go<00:01:35.240> any<00:01:35.390> higher<00:01:35.420> so<00:01:36.170> I'm<00:01:36.320> gonna<00:01:36.560> today

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
to go any higher so I'm gonna today

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:43.240 
to go any higher so I'm gonna today
about<00:01:37.010> five<00:01:38.170> five<00:01:39.170> thousand<00:01:39.710> and<00:01:40.510> then<00:01:42.250> so

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
about five five thousand and then so

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:44.680 
about five five thousand and then so
let's<00:01:43.400> get<00:01:43.550> taxiing<00:01:44.000> to<00:01:44.240> the<00:01:44.270> runway<00:01:44.390> and

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
let's get taxiing to the runway and

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.530 
let's get taxiing to the runway and
we'll<00:01:45.110> see<00:01:45.350> how<00:01:46.190> this<00:01:46.580> turns<00:01:46.880> out<00:01:47.120> right<00:01:47.390> now

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
we'll see how this turns out right now

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.530 
we'll see how this turns out right now
I'm<00:01:47.690> using<00:01:47.840> an<00:01:48.200> air<00:01:48.410> Bruin<00:01:48.920> and<00:01:49.180> USA<00:01:50.180> I<00:01:50.210> don't

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:50.540 
I'm using an air Bruin and USA I don't

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.010 
I'm using an air Bruin and USA I don't
know<00:01:50.630> why<00:01:50.840> it's<00:01:51.590> just<00:01:51.650> delivery<00:01:52.540> so<00:01:53.540> let's

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
know why it's just delivery so let's

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:00.130 
know why it's just delivery so let's
change<00:01:54.350> that<00:01:55.720> Southwest<00:01:58.480> alright<00:01:59.480> so<00:01:59.780> when<00:02:00.050> I

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
change that Southwest alright so when I

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.140 
change that Southwest alright so when I
get<00:02:00.200> to<00:02:00.350> the<00:02:00.500> runway<00:02:00.650> I<00:02:01.070> will<00:02:01.310> show<00:02:01.730> you<00:02:01.790> how<00:02:02.030> to

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.150 
get to the runway I will show you how to

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:03.480 
get to the runway I will show you how to
use<00:02:02.270> it

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
use it

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.610 
use it
alrighty<00:02:04.490> then<00:02:04.760> so<00:02:05.030> now<00:02:05.240> we<00:02:05.300> have<00:02:05.690> all<00:02:05.990> of<00:02:06.050> our

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:06.620 
alrighty then so now we have all of our

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.820 
alrighty then so now we have all of our
explained<00:02:07.269> autopilot<00:02:08.269> setup<00:02:08.929> and<00:02:09.170> we<00:02:09.500> are<00:02:09.619> now

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
explained autopilot setup and we are now

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.670 
explained autopilot setup and we are now
on<00:02:10.190> the<00:02:10.220> runway<00:02:10.700> 25<00:02:11.209> left<00:02:11.239> of<00:02:11.810> Los<00:02:12.709> Angeles<00:02:13.209> so

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
on the runway 25 left of Los Angeles so

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.040 
on the runway 25 left of Los Angeles so
let's<00:02:15.680> start<00:02:16.040> off<00:02:16.220> by<00:02:16.750> turning<00:02:17.750> up<00:02:17.780> full

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
let's start off by turning up full

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:34.150 
let's start off by turning up full
throttle<00:02:18.610> so<00:02:19.610> let's<00:02:20.000> do<00:02:20.180> that

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.059 

okay<00:02:35.160> now<00:02:35.490> we<00:02:35.550> can<00:02:35.700> take<00:02:36.209> off<00:02:36.390> by<00:02:36.930> that<00:02:37.860> got

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
okay now we can take off by that got

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:42.050 
okay now we can take off by that got
letting<00:02:38.490> go<00:02:38.610> of<00:02:38.640> the<00:02:38.850> brakes<00:02:39.120> and<00:02:40.850> now<00:02:41.850> we're

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
letting go of the brakes and now we're

00:02:42.060 --> 00:03:06.280 
letting go of the brakes and now we're
off<00:02:42.209> a<00:02:45.350> little<00:02:46.350> foggy<00:02:46.680> here<00:02:47.040> so

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:11.050 

all<00:03:07.040> right<00:03:07.360> so<00:03:08.360> now<00:03:08.750> we're<00:03:08.959> taking<00:03:09.409> off<00:03:10.060> we're

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
all right so now we're taking off we're

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.240 
all right so now we're taking off we're
coming<00:03:11.329> up<00:03:11.420> any<00:03:11.599> concentrate<00:03:12.260> of<00:03:12.439> climbing<00:03:12.950> um

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
coming up any concentrate of climbing um

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.960 
coming up any concentrate of climbing um
I<00:03:14.110> guess<00:03:15.110> it's<00:03:15.140> time<00:03:15.500> to<00:03:15.739> pull<00:03:16.430> up<00:03:16.459> our<00:03:16.700> gear

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
I guess it's time to pull up our gear

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.520 
I guess it's time to pull up our gear
and<00:03:18.040> right<00:03:19.040> here<00:03:19.310> is<00:03:19.519> the<00:03:19.640> CMD<00:03:20.269> so<00:03:20.959> you<00:03:21.019> gotta

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
and right here is the CMD so you gotta

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.819 
and right here is the CMD so you gotta
click<00:03:21.829> that<00:03:22.010> button<00:03:22.189> and<00:03:23.180> click<00:03:23.450> speed<00:03:23.900> so

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:24.829 
click that button and click speed so

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:27.460 
click that button and click speed so
