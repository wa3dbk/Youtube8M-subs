 But I do not have my own psp 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.450

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.450
 Say 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:25.260
 I was originally planning to buy a psp by summer vacation 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.260
 At that time 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:32.150

 I was going to face this too 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:49.380
 It was a bit easier to go to the old burial mound today and it was 500 yen 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.640
 It is also higher or a I 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:55.260

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:59.090
