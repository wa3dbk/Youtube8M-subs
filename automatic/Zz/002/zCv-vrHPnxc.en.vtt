hundred and twelve square feet of garden

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.729 
hundred and twelve square feet of garden
that<00:00:35.579> I<00:00:35.640> grow<00:00:36.030> everything<00:00:36.570> that<00:00:37.020> I<00:00:37.170> need<00:00:37.440> for

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
that I grow everything that I need for

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.670 
that I grow everything that I need for
my<00:00:37.890> family<00:00:38.309> of<00:00:38.460> four<00:00:38.700> for<00:00:39.120> an<00:00:39.239> entire<00:00:39.600> year<00:00:39.680> so

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
my family of four for an entire year so

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.080 
my family of four for an entire year so
as<00:00:40.980> you<00:00:41.129> can<00:00:41.250> imagine<00:00:41.780> space<00:00:42.780> is<00:00:43.050> a<00:00:43.079> premium

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.090 
as you can imagine space is a premium

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.690 
as you can imagine space is a premium
you<00:00:45.090> can<00:00:45.270> only<00:00:45.420> have<00:00:46.410> so<00:00:46.829> many<00:00:46.980> things<00:00:47.340> growing

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
you can only have so many things growing

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.229 
you can only have so many things growing
horizontally<00:00:48.770> across<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:50.160> raised<00:00:50.489> bed<00:00:50.520> garden

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
horizontally across a raised bed garden

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.360 
horizontally across a raised bed garden
so<00:00:51.809> one<00:00:52.020> of<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.199> concepts<00:00:52.770> that's<00:00:53.010> really

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
so one of the concepts that's really

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.549 
so one of the concepts that's really
important<00:00:53.910> when<00:00:54.120> you<00:00:54.270> get<00:00:54.420> into<00:00:54.629> risky<00:00:55.140> bet

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
important when you get into risky bet

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.439 
important when you get into risky bet
gardening<00:00:56.010> is<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.370> learn<00:00:56.550> how<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:56.940> grow<00:00:57.300> as

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
gardening is to learn how to grow as

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.810 
gardening is to learn how to grow as
many<00:00:57.690> things<00:00:57.930> as<00:00:58.140> you<00:00:58.199> can<00:00:58.530> vertically<00:00:59.070> so<00:00:59.789> I

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
many things as you can vertically so I

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.720 
many things as you can vertically so I
wanted<00:01:00.180> to<00:01:00.270> put<00:01:00.449> together<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.870> video<00:01:01.379> today<00:01:01.739> to

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
wanted to put together a video today to

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.969 
wanted to put together a video today to
let<00:01:02.940> you<00:01:02.969> see<00:01:03.480> a<00:01:03.840> few<00:01:04.170> of<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.379> things<00:01:04.559> that<00:01:04.890> are

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
let you see a few of the things that are

out in my garden right now that's
transitioning<00:01:07.680> out<00:01:07.890> of<00:01:07.920> springing<00:01:08.460> into<00:01:08.820> the

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
transitioning out of springing into the

you to be able to see what some of the

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.700 
you to be able to see what some of the
things<00:01:15.390> look<00:01:15.750> like<00:01:15.780> that<00:01:16.320> are<00:01:16.470> growing

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
things look like that are growing

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.800 
things look like that are growing
vertically<00:01:17.310> in<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.610> garden<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.210> some<00:01:18.630> of<00:01:18.720> the

the<00:01:24.450> air<00:01:24.540> instead<00:01:25.140> of<00:01:25.170> across<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.619> ground<00:01:26.070> so

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
the air instead of across the ground so

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.149 
the air instead of across the ground so
let's<00:01:27.240> go<00:01:27.570> ahead<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:27.900> get<00:01:28.229> ourselves<00:01:28.409> on<00:01:28.920> out

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
let's go ahead and get ourselves on out

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.690 
let's go ahead and get ourselves on out
to<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.430> garden

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
see this is a picture of a cucumber that

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.630 
see this is a picture of a cucumber that
it<00:01:44.600> started<00:01:45.170> to<00:01:45.289> grow<00:01:45.439> and<00:01:45.799> eventually<00:01:45.979> it<00:01:46.490> got

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
it started to grow and eventually it got

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.929 
it started to grow and eventually it got
tall<00:01:47.000> enough<00:01:47.390> to<00:01:47.630> be<00:01:48.409> able<00:01:48.679> to<00:01:49.039> hook<00:01:49.700> it<00:01:49.909> right

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:49.939 
tall enough to be able to hook it right

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:55.749 
tall enough to be able to hook it right
onto<00:01:50.450> the<00:01:50.750> fence<00:01:51.049> and<00:01:51.799> allow<00:01:52.579> the<00:01:54.759> cucumber's

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
onto the fence and allow the cucumber's

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:58.779 
onto the fence and allow the cucumber's
to<00:01:55.939> go<00:01:56.090> directly<00:01:56.840> up<00:01:57.110> the<00:01:57.259> fence<00:01:57.619> I'm<00:01:58.429> going<00:01:58.700> to

00:01:58.779 --> 00:01:58.789 
to go directly up the fence I'm going to

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:03.309 
to go directly up the fence I'm going to
just<00:01:59.060> walk<00:01:59.420> in<00:01:59.719> here<00:01:59.750> for<00:02:00.319> just<00:02:00.530> a<00:02:00.649> moment<00:02:02.319> so

00:02:03.309 --> 00:02:03.319 
just walk in here for just a moment so

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:05.260 
just walk in here for just a moment so
you<00:02:03.409> can<00:02:03.679> begin<00:02:03.799> to<00:02:03.979> see<00:02:04.340> the<00:02:04.369> nice<00:02:04.849> little

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
you can begin to see the nice little

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.389 
you can begin to see the nice little
connections<00:02:05.899> they'll<00:02:06.170> just<00:02:06.470> naturally<00:02:07.159> start

you could kind of get an idea of how
I've<00:03:21.620> built<00:03:21.980> some<00:03:22.130> of<00:03:22.400> this<00:03:22.519> piping<00:03:23.060> into<00:03:23.420> my

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:23.569

00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:28.599 
garden I have just regular one by two

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:31.390 
garden I have just regular one by two
rectangular<00:03:29.599> garden<00:03:30.049> fencing<00:03:30.769> run<00:03:31.010> up<00:03:31.190> in

so that I can tear all this down for the
winter<00:03:41.130> time<00:03:41.430> and<00:03:41.760> you<00:03:42.360> see<00:03:42.630> I<00:03:42.660> use<00:03:42.989> just<00:03:43.230> a

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:43.349 
winter time and you see I use just a

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:45.770 
winter time and you see I use just a
series<00:03:43.590> of<00:03:43.739> little<00:03:44.640> bits<00:03:44.819> of<00:03:44.940> string<00:03:45.180> or<00:03:45.510> duct
