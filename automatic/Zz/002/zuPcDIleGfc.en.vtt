need that pretty much no matter what um
so<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.090> settings<00:00:27.510> you<00:00:27.689> need<00:00:28.340> to<00:00:29.340> get<00:00:29.519> it<00:00:29.640> just

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
so the settings you need to get it just

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
low that's um how sensitive the exposure

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.650 
low that's um how sensitive the exposure
is<00:00:39.350> so<00:00:40.350> I'm<00:00:40.500> that<00:00:40.649> low<00:00:40.879> next<00:00:41.879> is<00:00:42.000> shutter<00:00:42.270> speed

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
is so I'm that low next is shutter speed

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.860 
is so I'm that low next is shutter speed
you<00:00:43.020> want<00:00:43.260> that<00:00:43.500> really<00:00:43.829> really<00:00:44.370> long<00:00:45.030> mindset

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
you want that really really long mindset

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.740 
you want that really really long mindset

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
20 seconds so I'll take a nice long

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.040 
20 seconds so I'll take a nice long
picture<00:00:49.230> which<00:00:49.590> allows<00:00:49.890> me<00:00:50.070> to<00:00:50.219> do<00:00:50.370> things

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
picture which allows me to do things

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.350 
picture which allows me to do things
then<00:00:52.050> you're<00:00:52.289> going<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:52.500> want<00:00:52.879> this<00:00:53.879> this<00:00:54.210> is

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
then you're going to want this this is

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.069 
then you're going to want this this is
the<00:00:54.780> f-stop<00:00:55.430> the<00:00:56.430> f-stop<00:00:56.820> is<00:00:57.000> how<00:00:57.180> small<00:00:57.690> or

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
the f-stop the f-stop is how small or

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.810 
the f-stop the f-stop is how small or
big<00:00:58.309> the<00:00:59.309> UM<00:01:00.500> aperture<00:01:01.500> is<00:01:01.649> which<00:01:01.920> is<00:01:02.100> how<00:01:02.579> big

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
big the UM aperture is which is how big

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.109 
big the UM aperture is which is how big
the<00:01:02.940> hole<00:01:03.059> is<00:01:03.530> so<00:01:04.530> you<00:01:05.220> can't<00:01:05.430> see<00:01:05.610> on<00:01:05.640> digital

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
the hole is so you can't see on digital

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.260 
the hole is so you can't see on digital
cameras<00:01:06.390> but<00:01:06.570> there's<00:01:06.810> actually<00:01:07.200> a<00:01:07.229> hole<00:01:07.530> in

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
cameras but there's actually a hole in

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.460 
cameras but there's actually a hole in
there<00:01:09.270> which<00:01:09.930> is<00:01:10.110> determined<00:01:10.590> by<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.820> f-stop

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
there which is determined by the f-stop

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.160 
there which is determined by the f-stop
which<00:01:13.470> makes<00:01:13.710> it<00:01:13.860> bigger<00:01:14.100> or<00:01:14.250> smaller<00:01:15.170> it's

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
which makes it bigger or smaller it's

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.480 
which makes it bigger or smaller it's
really<00:01:16.320> quite<00:01:16.439> handy<00:01:17.070> sometimes<00:01:17.960> and<00:01:19.100> I<00:01:20.100> don't

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
really quite handy sometimes and I don't

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.950 
really quite handy sometimes and I don't
know<00:01:20.580> why<00:01:20.729> I<00:01:20.759> have<00:01:20.880> that<00:01:21.090> said<00:01:21.299> to<00:01:21.420> them<00:01:21.630> why<00:01:23.960> I
