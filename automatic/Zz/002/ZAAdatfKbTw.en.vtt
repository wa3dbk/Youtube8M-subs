00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.110 
them and again my opponents defense is

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.950 
them and again my opponents defense is
just<00:04:57.440> all<00:04:58.009> over<00:04:58.400> Barry<00:04:58.879> Sanders<00:04:59.360> I<00:04:59.479> expected

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
just all over Barry Sanders I expected

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.300 
just all over Barry Sanders I expected
on<00:05:00.080> the<00:05:00.139> breakout<00:05:00.530> this<00:05:00.680> game<00:05:00.889> here<00:05:01.069> on<00:05:01.129> third

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:01.310 
on the breakout this game here on third

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:03.430 
on the breakout this game here on third
and<00:05:01.460> six<00:05:01.699> I<00:05:01.940> thought<00:05:02.449> this<00:05:02.629> was<00:05:02.810> Barry<00:05:03.020> Sanders

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440 
and six I thought this was Barry Sanders

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.860 
and six I thought this was Barry Sanders
and<00:05:03.680> said<00:05:03.949> it's<00:05:04.129> Trey<00:05:04.340> Mason<00:05:04.550> but<00:05:05.449> it<00:05:05.569> doesn't

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:05.870 
and said it's Trey Mason but it doesn't

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:07.719 
and said it's Trey Mason but it doesn't
matter<00:05:06.020> he<00:05:06.409> is<00:05:06.440> nowhere<00:05:06.740> to<00:05:06.919> go<00:05:07.099> either<00:05:07.310> so<00:05:07.580> my

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:07.729 
matter he is nowhere to go either so my

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:10.330 
matter he is nowhere to go either so my
opponent<00:05:07.969> takes<00:05:08.719> over<00:05:09.169> looking<00:05:09.530> right<00:05:09.949> side

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:10.340 
opponent takes over looking right side

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.189 
opponent takes over looking right side
but<00:05:10.639> Richard<00:05:11.090> Sherman<00:05:11.599> is<00:05:11.750> there<00:05:11.990> in<00:05:12.110> the

00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:12.199 
but Richard Sherman is there in the

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:14.409 
but Richard Sherman is there in the
coverage<00:05:12.560> so<00:05:13.550> it's<00:05:13.699> gonna<00:05:13.849> set<00:05:14.090> him<00:05:14.150> up<00:05:14.270> in

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:14.419 
coverage so it's gonna set him up in

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:17.170 
coverage so it's gonna set him up in
second<00:05:14.810> intent<00:05:15.789> Manning<00:05:16.789> feeling<00:05:17.090> the

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:17.180 
second intent Manning feeling the

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:18.790 
second intent Manning feeling the
pressure<00:05:17.419> gets<00:05:17.780> this<00:05:17.900> one<00:05:18.080> away<00:05:18.229> finds<00:05:18.620> his

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 
pressure gets this one away finds his

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.439 
pressure gets this one away finds his
receiver<00:05:18.949> he's<00:05:19.550> able<00:05:19.879> to<00:05:19.940> make<00:05:20.060> a<00:05:20.090> Juke<00:05:20.419> move

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:20.449 
receiver he's able to make a Juke move

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:23.050 
receiver he's able to make a Juke move
and<00:05:21.020> that<00:05:21.530> is<00:05:21.590> enough<00:05:22.280> for<00:05:22.550> another<00:05:22.729> first

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.060
