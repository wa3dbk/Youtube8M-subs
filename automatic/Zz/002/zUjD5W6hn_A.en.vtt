out and kind of go a little bit more in

out and kind of go a little bit more in
depth<00:00:30.539> with<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.900> testing<00:00:31.439> that<00:00:31.560> he<00:00:31.740> did<00:00:31.949> with

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
especially with the ASM one you you have

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.359 
especially with the ASM one you you have
no<00:01:16.049> chance<00:01:16.320> you're<00:01:16.590> going<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:16.770> get<00:01:16.890> melted

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
no chance you're going to get melted

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
half a second built-in lag I mean I'm on

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.990 
half a second built-in lag I mean I'm on
split<00:01:22.619> screen<00:01:22.950> for<00:01:23.159> God's<00:01:23.340> sakes<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:23.850> there's

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
split screen for God's sakes and there's

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.010 
split screen for God's sakes and there's
a<00:01:24.060> five<00:01:24.390> half<00:01:24.990> a<00:01:25.110> point<00:01:25.710> five<00:01:25.950> second<00:01:26.939> lag<00:01:27.720> I

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
a five half a point five second lag I

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.249 
a five half a point five second lag I
mean<00:01:28.200> there's<00:01:29.189> so<00:01:29.579> many<00:01:29.880> factors<00:01:30.810> that

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
mean there's so many factors that

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.499 
mean there's so many factors that
determine<00:01:32.100> how<00:01:32.250> much<00:01:32.700> you're<00:01:32.939> gonna<00:01:33.030> lag<00:01:33.329> and

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
determine how much you're gonna lag and

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:34.819 
determine how much you're gonna lag and
there's<00:01:33.659> always<00:01:33.930> going<00:01:34.049> to<00:01:34.110> be<00:01:34.200> that<00:01:34.439> delay

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
there's always going to be that delay

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.969 
there's always going to be that delay
and<00:01:35.790> you<00:01:36.090> know<00:01:36.210> there's<00:01:36.509> obviously<00:01:37.259> no<00:01:37.590> ping

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
and you know there's obviously no ping

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.219 
and you know there's obviously no ping
as<00:01:38.280> far<00:01:38.520> as<00:01:38.700> split<00:01:39.000> screen<00:01:39.270> goes<00:01:39.479> so<00:01:39.750> I<00:01:39.780> mean<00:01:40.049> I

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
as far as split screen goes so I mean I

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.889 
as far as split screen goes so I mean I
can't<00:01:40.619> imagine<00:01:41.100> what<00:01:41.729> it's<00:01:41.850> like<00:01:41.970> online<00:01:42.600> how

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
can't imagine what it's like online how

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.200 
can't imagine what it's like online how
big<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.380> delay<00:01:43.740> is<00:01:43.950> there's<00:01:44.520> really<00:01:44.640> no<00:01:45.060> way

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
big the delay is there's really no way

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.969 
big the delay is there's really no way
of<00:01:45.240> testing<00:01:45.630> that<00:01:45.990> because<00:01:46.470> you<00:01:46.829> would<00:01:46.950> have

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
of testing that because you would have

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.450 
of testing that because you would have
to<00:01:47.220> have<00:01:47.810> perfectly<00:01:48.810> aligned<00:01:49.740> like<00:01:50.159> to

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
to have perfectly aligned like to

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.359 
to have perfectly aligned like to
people's<00:01:51.030> like<00:01:51.270> point<00:01:51.570> of<00:01:51.720> view<00:01:51.930> but<00:01:52.590> um<00:01:52.860> I

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
people's like point of view but um I

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.630 
people's like point of view but um I
mean<00:01:54.299> there'd<00:01:54.659> be<00:01:55.140> no<00:01:55.380> exact<00:01:55.950> measurement<00:01:56.490> for

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
mean there'd be no exact measurement for

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.730 
mean there'd be no exact measurement for
that<00:01:56.759> but<00:01:57.000> either<00:01:57.329> way<00:01:57.540> either<00:01:57.899> way<00:01:58.170> you<00:01:58.409> guys

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
that but either way either way you guys

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.069 
that but either way either way you guys
get<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.130> gist<00:01:59.460> of<00:01:59.579> this<00:01:59.759> um<00:02:00.090> there's<00:02:00.600> a<00:02:00.689> pretty

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
get the gist of this um there's a pretty

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.350 
get the gist of this um there's a pretty
much<00:02:01.259> of<00:02:01.409> built-in<00:02:01.829> lag<00:02:02.130> into<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.610> game<00:02:02.790> so

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
much of built-in lag into the game so

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.580 
much of built-in lag into the game so
that's<00:02:03.630> going<00:02:03.750> to<00:02:03.810> be<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:04.079> reasoning<00:02:04.560> behind

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
that's going to be the reasoning behind

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.520 
that's going to be the reasoning behind
a<00:02:05.189> lot<00:02:05.369> of<00:02:05.520> your<00:02:05.670> BS<00:02:05.969> deaths<00:02:06.299> every<00:02:06.570> single

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
a lot of your BS deaths every single

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.109 
a lot of your BS deaths every single
call<00:02:07.740> of<00:02:07.890> duty<00:02:08.129> has<00:02:08.310> this<00:02:08.520> call<00:02:08.759> of<00:02:08.879> duty

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
call of duty has this call of duty

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.300 
call of duty has this call of duty
ghosts<00:02:09.360> at<00:02:09.599> it<00:02:09.810> call<00:02:10.140> especially<00:02:10.500> cod<00:02:11.009> ghosts

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
ghosts at it call especially cod ghosts

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.940 
ghosts at it call especially cod ghosts
everybody<00:02:11.819> knows<00:02:12.000> that<00:02:12.030> right<00:02:12.510> black<00:02:13.349> ops<00:02:13.590> 2

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
everybody knows that right black ops 2

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.089 
everybody knows that right black ops 2
of<00:02:14.129> course<00:02:14.840> every<00:02:15.840> single<00:02:16.140> cod<00:02:16.319> in<00:02:16.590> recent

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
of course every single cod in recent

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:19.130 
of course every single cod in recent
years<00:02:17.129> probably<00:02:17.580> since<00:02:17.849> like<00:02:18.300> cod<00:02:18.510> four<00:02:18.840> maybe

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
years probably since like cod four maybe

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.930 
years probably since like cod four maybe
even<00:02:19.230> older<00:02:19.769> every<00:02:20.069> single<00:02:20.340> call<00:02:20.550> of<00:02:20.670> duty

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
even older every single call of duty

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.550 
even older every single call of duty
they<00:02:21.060> probably<00:02:21.450> played<00:02:21.750> has<00:02:21.930> had<00:02:22.080> this<00:02:22.319> and

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
they probably played has had this and

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.220 
they probably played has had this and
that's<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:23.970> main<00:02:24.180> reason<00:02:24.209> you<00:02:24.660> probably<00:02:24.810> get

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
that's the main reason you probably get

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.660 
that's the main reason you probably get
melted<00:02:25.620> around<00:02:25.890> corners<00:02:26.340> and<00:02:26.519> that's

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
melted around corners and that's

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.430 
melted around corners and that's
probably<00:02:26.879> the<00:02:27.180> main<00:02:27.209> reason<00:02:27.420> you<00:02:27.870> get<00:02:27.989> melted

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
probably the main reason you get melted

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.410 
probably the main reason you get melted
when<00:02:28.680> your<00:02:28.830> pre<00:02:29.069> aiming<00:02:29.370> something<00:02:29.760> so<00:02:29.970> either

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420
