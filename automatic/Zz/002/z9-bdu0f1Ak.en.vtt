00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.689
 after determining it aythami see a lot of secondary characters 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:34.450

 during the game as well as a nursery for your innocent pines 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.600

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.480
 beat this one three years ago 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:03.280
 In the game you will meet Isaac and you will face him 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.310
 during the game you will go through different scenarios like the abandoned castle 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.960
 through the mountains the aqueduct and the gardens among others which are 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:15.520
 well elaborated each map has its own percentage of discovered to 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:21.069
 as well as secrets and a fixed and cozumel varied enemies something that stand out from 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:25.340
 the scenarios is that they keep secrets where you least expect them, which is a 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.139
 challenge for any to see the map 100% and level up or find and have here 

00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:34.120
 unlike the previous castlevania we do not find arms ourselves 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.530
 we do them in the following way this rotating enemies will drop pieces of 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.579
 Elements such as aluminum bronze 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:45.369
 fossil rock coal which, when combined, generates a new weapon that is 

00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:50.560
 they divide into swords as spears melee weapons as special claws 

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:53.529
 This is created if you create certain birds 

00:02:53.529 --> 00:02:58.029
 create if you create certain weapons armor and helmets this system is a 

00:02:58.029 --> 00:03:01.799
 of the best things in the game the graphics of the game are acceptable 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:05.969
 although they do not get to exaggerate or when they are the best of the game but neither 

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:09.919
 worse it is worth noting that the effects of light in also facts although some 

00:03:09.919 --> 00:03:12.749
 The enemies are well designed as well 

00:03:12.749 --> 00:03:16.059
 that other characters fall a bit in the scenarios that 

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:19.979
 some are empty there is still a benefit they can see up to 15 types of 

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:24.219
 different enemies each with their mode of skills and appearance on a 

00:03:24.219 --> 00:03:28.589
 same screen without suffering any kind of graphical slowness some point ccoo 

00:03:29.369 --> 00:03:31.629
 positive in the gameplay and speaking 

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:34.370
 of it is the best of the game from the types of music 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.260
 2 that appear in the game that they get to be more than 50 types including bosses with 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:39.709
 his fingers 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:40.909
 gades and strengths 

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:44.330
 the hector combos system that your movie the best of the game is 

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:48.510
 simply impressive from the different combos with the different weapons 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.559
 of the different types the way to defend themselves agile jumps to dodge 

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:56.349
 and combining with the dodging movements and the best among more 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:57.169
 southeast level from 

00:03:57.169 --> 00:04:00.919
 follies more comfortable for weapons the one that is more impressed me was the one of 

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:04.119
 body to body with claws leaves you breathless 

00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:08.229
 dante is small with the office xp in addition to having the innocent of 

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:11.509
 vinyl which you can make them evolve learn skills 

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:15.609
 cure that fee and the returns system is collecting crystals 

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:19.709
 evolutionary that some enemies leave depending on what weapons you used to 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.779
 kill him my final verdict for the game is 9 

00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:26.769
 besides that the long game has secret challenges and endless things 

00:04:26.769 --> 00:04:30.939
 more I admit the first time you see it the graphics do not look good 

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:34.869
 it happened to me and when I got bored levy an opportunity is one of the few 

00:04:34.869 --> 00:04:37.779
 game in which the tragic ones do not matter 

00:04:37.779 --> 00:04:40.779
 the most curious thing yesterday was handcuffed 

00:04:44.559 --> 00:04:47.559
 3 I adore you 

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:50.289
 and ugt and ccoo is opposed
