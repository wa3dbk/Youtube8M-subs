description and again this is for the

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.080 
description and again this is for the
samsung<00:00:26.849> galaxy<00:00:27.210> s2<00:00:27.330> and<00:00:28.400> this<00:00:29.400> is<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.699> luxury

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
samsung galaxy s2 and this is the luxury

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.990 
samsung galaxy s2 and this is the luxury
silicon<00:00:30.869> case<00:00:31.109> so<00:00:32.040> what<00:00:32.399> we're<00:00:32.489> gonna<00:00:32.610> do<00:00:32.730> is

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
silicon case so what we're gonna do is

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.549 
silicon case so what we're gonna do is
we're<00:00:33.120> gonna<00:00:33.239> have<00:00:33.390> a<00:00:33.420> quick<00:00:33.540> look<00:00:33.600> it<00:00:33.870> put<00:00:34.530> on

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
we're gonna have a quick look it put on

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.160 
we're gonna have a quick look it put on
the<00:00:34.739> farm<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.219> we<00:00:35.309> shall<00:00:35.730> see<00:00:36.480> what<00:00:36.630> it's<00:00:36.780> like

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.170 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.880 

so<00:00:40.170> then<00:00:40.469> I<00:00:41.149> was<00:00:42.149> inside<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.690> box<00:00:42.899> we<00:00:43.260> do<00:00:43.680> get

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
so then I was inside the box we do get

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.729 
so then I was inside the box we do get
the<00:00:44.059> nice<00:00:45.059> luxury<00:00:45.510> silicon<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:46.260> I<00:00:46.350> must<00:00:46.500> say

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
the nice luxury silicon and I must say

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.069 
the nice luxury silicon and I must say
it<00:00:47.340> does<00:00:47.370> actually<00:00:47.640> feel<00:00:48.030> you<00:00:48.210> know<00:00:48.360> it<00:00:48.840> feels

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
it does actually feel you know it feels

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.979 
it does actually feel you know it feels
premium<00:00:49.649> it<00:00:49.739> just<00:00:49.860> feel<00:00:50.010> really<00:00:50.190> nice<00:00:50.690> and<00:00:51.690> you

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
premium it just feel really nice and you

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.840 
premium it just feel really nice and you
get<00:00:52.140> this<00:00:52.289> which<00:00:52.829> I<00:00:52.920> think's<00:00:53.129> a<00:00:53.250> nice<00:00:53.610> little

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
get this which I think's a nice little

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.209 
get this which I think's a nice little
touch<00:00:54.170> so<00:00:55.170> much<00:00:55.440> pop<00:00:55.649> these<00:00:55.770> off<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:56.070> one<00:00:56.190> side

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
touch so much pop these off to one side

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.569 
touch so much pop these off to one side
really<00:00:56.610> quickly<00:00:58.039> and<00:00:59.039> we'll<00:00:59.219> just<00:00:59.309> show<00:00:59.520> you

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
really quickly and we'll just show you

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:00.740 
really quickly and we'll just show you
how<00:00:59.699> to<00:00:59.760> what<00:00:59.910> you<00:01:00.000> get<00:01:00.149> started<00:01:00.359> you<00:01:00.480> get<00:01:00.600> that

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
how to what you get started you get that

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.900 
how to what you get started you get that
and<00:01:01.289> you're<00:01:01.379> thinking<00:01:01.469> what's<00:01:01.859> this<00:01:02.070> now<00:01:02.820> if

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
and you're thinking what's this now if

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.039 
and you're thinking what's this now if
you<00:01:03.030> don't<00:01:03.180> realize<00:01:03.270> what<00:01:03.420> this<00:01:03.539> is<00:01:03.690> basically

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
you don't realize what this is basically

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.039 
you don't realize what this is basically
this<00:01:04.199> is<00:01:04.260> a<00:01:04.379> cleaning<00:01:04.830> cloth<00:01:04.920> on<00:01:05.250> here<00:01:06.240> is<00:01:06.689> I

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
this is a cleaning cloth on here is I

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.020 
this is a cleaning cloth on here is I
think<00:01:07.110> it's<00:01:07.380> microfiber<00:01:07.950> which<00:01:08.549> like<00:01:08.729> all<00:01:08.880> the

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
think it's microfiber which like all the

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.870 
think it's microfiber which like all the
cleaning<00:01:09.240> cloths<00:01:09.540> and<00:01:10.250> with<00:01:11.250> my<00:01:11.430> navi<00:01:11.670> I've

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
cleaning cloths and with my navi I've

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.179 
cleaning cloths and with my navi I've
got<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.150> skin<00:01:12.420> on<00:01:12.450> mine<00:01:12.659> still<00:01:12.960> right<00:01:13.799> on<00:01:13.830> now

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
got the skin on mine still right on now

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.460 
got the skin on mine still right on now
so<00:01:14.580> you<00:01:15.240> can<00:01:15.420> see<00:01:15.570> there<00:01:15.780> you<00:01:15.990> can<00:01:16.140> just<00:01:16.170> clean

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
so you can see there you can just clean

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.280 
so you can see there you can just clean
it<00:01:16.500> up<00:01:19.700> ticularly<00:01:20.700> screen<00:01:21.020> just<00:01:22.020> think<00:01:22.170> is<00:01:22.259> a

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
it up ticularly screen just think is a

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.010 
it up ticularly screen just think is a
pretty<00:01:23.070> cool<00:01:23.340> inclusion<00:01:23.820> in<00:01:23.909> there<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:24.750> what

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
pretty cool inclusion in there and what

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.080 
pretty cool inclusion in there and what
you<00:01:25.080> cook<00:01:25.229> tends<00:01:25.470> to<00:01:25.650> do<00:01:25.799> is<00:01:26.009> add<00:01:26.460> that<00:01:26.759> as<00:01:26.909> the

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
you cook tends to do is add that as the

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.420 
you cook tends to do is add that as the
may<00:01:27.450> beat<00:01:27.600> with<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:27.810> phone<00:01:28.049> charm<00:01:28.439> or<00:01:28.770> know

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
may beat with the phone charm or know

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.950 
may beat with the phone charm or know
what<00:01:29.579> if<00:01:29.670> you<00:01:29.729> may<00:01:29.880> want<00:01:30.150> up<00:01:30.299> on<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:30.509> keyring

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
what if you may want up on a keyring

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.219 
what if you may want up on a keyring
your<00:01:31.799> choice<00:01:32.119> so<00:01:33.119> that's<00:01:33.450> nice<00:01:33.630> little<00:01:33.900> extra

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
but what we're here to see is this here

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.330 
but what we're here to see is this here
so<00:01:38.450> as<00:01:39.450> I<00:01:39.570> said<00:01:39.780> is<00:01:39.990> a<00:01:40.020> nice<00:01:40.710> very<00:01:40.979> very<00:01:41.040> nice

so as I said is a nice very very nice

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.580 
so as I said is a nice very very nice
feeling<00:01:41.790> you<00:01:42.000> know<00:01:42.090> kind<00:01:42.390> of<00:01:42.420> silicon<00:01:42.930> obvious

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
feeling you know kind of silicon obvious

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.080 
feeling you know kind of silicon obvious
you<00:01:43.649> can<00:01:43.770> scrunch<00:01:44.040> it<00:01:44.220> up<00:01:44.250> and<00:01:44.610> it<00:01:44.670> was<00:01:44.790> goes

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
you can scrunch it up and it was goes

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.330 
you can scrunch it up and it was goes
back<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.570> exact<00:01:45.810> same<00:01:46.049> ship<00:01:46.380> so<00:01:47.220> we're

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
back to the exact same ship so we're

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.920 
back to the exact same ship so we're
just<00:01:47.369> going<00:01:47.579> to<00:01:47.670> put<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:47.909> galaxy<00:01:48.360> s2<00:01:48.479> in<00:01:48.750> there

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
just going to put the galaxy s2 in there

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.560 
just going to put the galaxy s2 in there
now<00:01:49.460> so<00:01:50.460> I<00:01:50.520> see<00:01:50.640> it<00:01:50.759> look<00:01:50.850> a<00:01:50.880> little<00:01:51.119> different

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
now so I see it look a little different

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.630 
now so I see it look a little different
with<00:01:51.720> a<00:01:51.750> bear<00:01:51.990> one<00:01:52.259> which<00:01:53.070> is<00:01:53.100> to<00:01:53.399> show<00:01:53.579> you

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
with a bear one which is to show you

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.160 
with a bear one which is to show you
that<00:01:53.700> you<00:01:53.820> can<00:01:53.880> have<00:01:54.180> a<00:01:54.210> skin<00:01:54.570> on<00:01:54.689> there<00:01:54.899> and

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
that you can have a skin on there and
