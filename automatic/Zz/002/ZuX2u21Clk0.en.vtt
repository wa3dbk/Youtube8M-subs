00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
strike map pack one and we're looking at

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.040 
strike map pack one and we're looking at
discovery<00:00:16.470> which<00:00:17.070> is<00:00:17.250> easily<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:18.240> the

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
discovery which is easily the the

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.439 
discovery which is easily the the
favorite<00:00:19.410> I<00:00:19.500> have<00:00:19.740> of<00:00:19.949> the<00:00:20.100> four<00:00:20.400> so<00:00:20.670> far<00:00:21.029> it's

favorite I have of the four so far it's

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.870 
favorite I have of the four so far it's
got<00:00:21.930> multiple<00:00:22.410> layers<00:00:22.650> here<00:00:23.430> and<00:00:23.550> there<00:00:23.670> I<00:00:23.699> got

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
got multiple layers here and there I got

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.640 
got multiple layers here and there I got
bubble<00:00:24.269> paths<00:00:24.510> as<00:00:25.019> you<00:00:25.109> can<00:00:25.199> see<00:00:25.350> here

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
bubble paths as you can see here

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.250 
bubble paths as you can see here
starting<00:00:26.400> out<00:00:26.490> from<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.730> spawn<00:00:27.060> point<00:00:27.390> going

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
starting out from the spawn point going

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.870 
starting out from the spawn point going
out<00:00:28.470> just<00:00:28.500> ways<00:00:28.890> you<00:00:29.189> know<00:00:29.310> I<00:00:29.340> guess<00:00:29.490> bad<00:00:29.730> guys

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
out just ways you know I guess bad guys

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.540 
out just ways you know I guess bad guys
coming<00:00:30.210> take<00:00:31.019> them<00:00:31.140> out<00:00:31.340> flipping<00:00:32.340> that

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
coming take them out flipping that

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.340 
coming take them out flipping that
around<00:00:32.610> and<00:00:33.480> imagining<00:00:33.960> coming<00:00:34.140> from<00:00:34.230> the

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
around and imagining coming from the

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.110 
around and imagining coming from the
other<00:00:34.380> side<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:35.040> map<00:00:35.370> pretty<00:00:35.640> much<00:00:35.790> works<00:00:36.000> the

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
other side the map pretty much works the

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.819 
other side the map pretty much works the
same<00:00:36.149> way<00:00:36.360> where<00:00:36.690> you<00:00:36.750> come<00:00:36.930> and<00:00:37.110> it's<00:00:37.620> pretty

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
same way where you come and it's pretty

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.590 
same way where you come and it's pretty
much<00:00:37.980> kind<00:00:38.219> of<00:00:38.340> these<00:00:38.520> these<00:00:38.940> past<00:00:39.360> these

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
much kind of these these past these

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.119 
much kind of these these past these
alleys<00:00:40.079> these<00:00:40.230> lanes<00:00:40.469> kind<00:00:40.829> of<00:00:40.890> come<00:00:40.980> around

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
alleys these lanes kind of come around

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.760 
alleys these lanes kind of come around
side<00:00:41.430> these<00:00:41.610> these<00:00:41.850> buildings<00:00:42.329> and<00:00:42.770> obviously

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
side these these buildings and obviously

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.200 
side these these buildings and obviously
we're<00:00:43.920> taking<00:00:44.129> a<00:00:44.160> look<00:00:44.309> at<00:00:44.370> this<00:00:44.489> one<00:00:44.670> here<00:00:44.700> and

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
we're taking a look at this one here and

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.970 
we're taking a look at this one here and
as<00:00:45.690> will<00:00:45.899> sneak<00:00:46.140> up<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.350> little<00:00:46.530> further<00:00:46.739> we'll

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
as will sneak up a little further we'll

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.200 
as will sneak up a little further we'll
take<00:00:47.160> a<00:00:47.190> look<00:00:47.370> across<00:00:47.610> obviously<00:00:48.090> I'm

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
take a look across obviously I'm

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.639 
take a look across obviously I'm
standing<00:00:48.840> out<00:00:48.960> in<00:00:49.079> front<00:00:49.140> of<00:00:49.350> God<00:00:49.620> and

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
standing out in front of God and

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.010 
standing out in front of God and
everybody<00:00:49.829> so<00:00:50.370> this<00:00:51.239> is<00:00:51.360> not<00:00:51.510> not<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:51.840> way<00:00:51.989> to

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
everybody so this is not not the way to

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.450 
everybody so this is not not the way to
play<00:00:52.260> I'm<00:00:52.379> just<00:00:52.500> kind<00:00:52.649> of<00:00:52.680> giving<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:52.920> idea<00:00:53.280> of

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
play I'm just kind of giving the idea of

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.340 
play I'm just kind of giving the idea of
visibility<00:00:54.420> in<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.780> different<00:00:55.020> areas<00:00:55.110> you

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
visibility in the different areas you

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.260 
visibility in the different areas you
have<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.590> see<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:55.949> look<00:00:56.129> so<00:00:56.730> right<00:00:56.910> here

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
have to see and look so right here

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.900 
have to see and look so right here
looking<00:00:57.690> across<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:58.079> map<00:00:58.320> for<00:00:58.649> folks<00:00:59.160> that's

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
looking across the map for folks that's

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.160 
looking across the map for folks that's
actually<00:01:00.210> one<00:01:00.329> of<00:01:00.359> my<00:01:00.420> favorite<00:01:00.480> spots<00:01:01.050> right

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170

over that of a little head you know
here's<00:01:57.479> another<00:01:57.630> spot<00:01:58.020> what<00:01:58.259> you'll<00:01:58.380> see<00:01:58.619> is

that destructible terrain

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.410 
that destructible terrain
now<00:02:01.410> right<00:02:01.620> there<00:02:01.860> you<00:02:02.640> know<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:03.090> teammate

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
now right there you know the teammate

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.090 
now right there you know the teammate
comes<00:02:03.630> and<00:02:03.810> takes<00:02:03.930> a<00:02:04.050> look<00:02:04.170> at<00:02:04.350> what<00:02:04.560> that<00:02:04.770> is

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
comes and takes a look at what that is

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.800

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
doing I still got to figure out exactly

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.900 
doing I still got to figure out exactly
the<00:02:06.960> best<00:02:07.290> most<00:02:07.650> effective<00:02:07.800> way<00:02:08.250> to<00:02:08.280> use<00:02:08.520> that

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
the best most effective way to use that

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.870 
the best most effective way to use that
here<00:02:09.690> you<00:02:09.899> can<00:02:10.050> see<00:02:10.430> this<00:02:11.430> is<00:02:11.550> actually<00:02:11.850> a

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
here you can see this is actually a

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.060 
here you can see this is actually a
pretty<00:02:12.300> good<00:02:12.480> spot<00:02:12.780> right<00:02:12.990> here<00:02:13.110> on<00:02:13.680> the<00:02:13.830> map

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.070 
pretty good spot right here on the map

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.280 
pretty good spot right here on the map
that<00:02:14.370> is<00:02:14.490> kind<00:02:14.730> of<00:02:14.880> like<00:02:14.970> a<00:02:15.030> you<00:02:15.930> know<00:02:15.960> if<00:02:16.200> you

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:26.470 
thing I'll say is I just like I'm
discovery<00:04:25.880> I<00:04:25.910> showed<00:04:26.090> you<00:04:26.180> a<00:04:26.210> second<00:04:26.450> ago

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:26.480 
discovery I showed you a second ago

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.450 
discovery I showed you a second ago
there<00:04:27.080> are<00:04:27.110> places<00:04:27.560> I<00:04:27.890> mean<00:04:28.040> obviously<00:04:28.340> you're

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
there are places I mean obviously you're

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.160 
there are places I mean obviously you're
fighting<00:04:28.850> on<00:04:28.940> the<00:04:29.060> rooftops<00:04:29.480> of<00:04:29.720> a<00:04:29.780> lot<00:04:30.080> of

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:30.170 
fighting on the rooftops of a lot of

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:32.860 
fighting on the rooftops of a lot of
these<00:04:30.260> these<00:04:30.800> these<00:04:31.160> structures<00:04:31.730> so<00:04:31.760> it<00:04:32.420> makes

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
these these these structures so it makes

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.240 
these these these structures so it makes
sense<00:04:32.990> that<00:04:33.200> there<00:04:33.470> are<00:04:33.590> places<00:04:33.860> where<00:04:34.040> you

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 
sense that there are places where you

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.120 
sense that there are places where you
could<00:04:34.400> fall<00:04:34.670> off<00:04:34.880> an<00:04:35.180> edge<00:04:35.390> or<00:04:35.630> two<00:04:36.100> here<00:04:37.100> you

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130 
could fall off an edge or two here you

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:40.750 
could fall off an edge or two here you
can<00:04:37.340> see<00:04:37.550> I<00:04:37.580> got<00:04:37.880> my<00:04:38.750> little<00:04:38.900> rc-xd<00:04:39.770> and<00:04:40.430> I<00:04:40.550> am

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:40.760 
can see I got my little rc-xd and I am

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.360 
can see I got my little rc-xd and I am
basically<00:04:41.720> riding<00:04:42.500> it<00:04:42.590> around<00:04:42.680> looking<00:04:43.190> for<00:04:43.220> a

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
basically riding it around looking for a

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.750 
basically riding it around looking for a
bad<00:04:43.490> guy<00:04:43.670> to<00:04:43.700> get<00:04:44.000> and<00:04:44.840> I<00:04:45.440> see<00:04:46.130> one<00:04:46.370> right<00:04:46.610> up

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:46.760 
bad guy to get and I see one right up

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.340 
bad guy to get and I see one right up
here<00:04:47.000> but<00:04:47.360> unfortunately<00:04:48.050> well

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.350 
here but unfortunately well

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:49.960 
here but unfortunately well
unfortunately<00:04:48.770> make<00:04:49.310> it<00:04:49.460> up<00:04:49.550> but<00:04:49.700> you'll<00:04:49.820> see

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:52.640 
whoo boom where's that here's a look at

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:55.480 
whoo boom where's that here's a look at
Stadium<00:04:53.180> a<00:04:53.590> third<00:04:54.590> map<00:04:54.980> that<00:04:55.190> we're<00:04:55.280> taking<00:04:55.460> a

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490 
Stadium a third map that we're taking a

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.580 
Stadium a third map that we're taking a
look<00:04:55.610> at<00:04:55.820> stadium<00:04:56.240> and<00:04:56.300> domination<00:04:56.720> I<00:04:57.110> will

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
look at stadium and domination I will

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:58.930 
look at stadium and domination I will
say<00:04:57.800> I<00:04:57.830> played<00:04:58.220> this<00:04:58.340> map<00:04:58.490> a<00:04:58.550> couple<00:04:58.880> different

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:58.940 
say I played this map a couple different

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.060 
say I played this map a couple different
ways<00:04:59.180> team<00:04:59.840> deathmatch<00:05:00.200> obviously<00:05:00.770> and

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:01.070 
ways team deathmatch obviously and

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:04.000 
ways team deathmatch obviously and
domination<00:05:01.970> domination<00:05:02.930> of<00:05:03.110> the<00:05:03.169> two<00:05:03.350> I<00:05:03.650> will

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.010 
domination domination of the two I will

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:06.100 
domination domination of the two I will
say<00:05:04.190> that<00:05:04.370> it<00:05:04.550> this<00:05:05.030> map<00:05:05.180> I<00:05:05.330> like<00:05:05.540> a<00:05:05.720> lot<00:05:05.930> in

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.110 
say that it this map I like a lot in

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.920 
say that it this map I like a lot in
domination<00:05:07.390> because<00:05:08.390> kind<00:05:08.600> of<00:05:08.660> the<00:05:08.720> way<00:05:08.780> it's

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:08.930 
domination because kind of the way it's

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:10.150 
domination because kind of the way it's
structured<00:05:09.260> you<00:05:09.470> can<00:05:09.560> see<00:05:09.710> here<00:05:10.010> the

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.160 
structured you can see here the

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.070 
structured you can see here the
scaffolding<00:05:10.730> getting<00:05:11.360> out<00:05:11.480> looking<00:05:11.900> right

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 
scaffolding getting out looking right

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.390 
scaffolding getting out looking right
over<00:05:12.110> the<00:05:12.560> top<00:05:12.710> of<00:05:12.770> me<00:05:13.010> and<00:05:13.040> you<00:05:13.310> know

anybody's played with him at all you
know<00:05:15.230> you<00:05:15.710> know<00:05:15.800> domination<00:05:16.460> kind<00:05:17.180> of<00:05:17.390> about

know to your team there's a little while

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:25.390 
know to your team there's a little while
to<00:05:23.840> realize<00:05:24.320> what's<00:05:24.590> happening<00:05:24.980> across<00:05:25.160> the

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:25.400 
to realize what's happening across the

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.190 
to realize what's happening across the
way<00:05:25.520> here<00:05:25.780> going<00:05:26.780> through<00:05:26.810> this<00:05:27.050> a<00:05:27.110> few

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:27.200 
way here going through this a few

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:28.600 
way here going through this a few
different<00:05:27.590> times<00:05:27.740> that<00:05:28.220> you<00:05:28.310> know<00:05:28.370> people

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:28.610 
different times that you know people

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:30.310 
different times that you know people
that<00:05:28.700> new<00:05:28.880> kind<00:05:29.270> of<00:05:29.300> catching<00:05:29.810> on<00:05:29.930> how<00:05:30.110> to<00:05:30.169> play

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:30.320 
that new kind of catching on how to play

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:31.360 
that new kind of catching on how to play
this<00:05:30.410> map<00:05:30.590> you<00:05:30.710> can<00:05:30.770> see<00:05:30.830> right<00:05:30.950> there<00:05:31.250> we're

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.370 
this map you can see right there we're

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:33.280 
this map you can see right there we're
getting<00:05:31.550> smoke<00:05:31.640> from<00:05:31.820> up<00:05:32.000> top<00:05:32.180> but<00:05:33.140> that's

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:33.290 
getting smoke from up top but that's

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:34.750 
getting smoke from up top but that's
kind<00:05:33.470> of<00:05:33.500> the<00:05:33.590> trick<00:05:34.040> that<00:05:34.220> we<00:05:34.310> learned<00:05:34.520> so<00:05:34.669> you

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:34.760 
kind of the trick that we learned so you

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.280 
kind of the trick that we learned so you
can<00:05:34.880> see<00:05:35.000> in<00:05:35.120> this<00:05:35.210> portion<00:05:35.510> of<00:05:35.630> the<00:05:35.690> game<00:05:35.870> and

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:36.290 
can see in this portion of the game and

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:39.400 
can see in this portion of the game and
we<00:05:36.380> got<00:05:36.530> be<00:05:36.740> here<00:05:37.010> we're<00:05:37.190> down<00:05:37.340> 49<00:05:37.790> 110<00:05:38.419> making

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:39.410 
we got be here we're down 49 110 making

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:40.600 
we got be here we're down 49 110 making
our<00:05:39.500> way<00:05:39.680> up<00:05:39.710> that<00:05:40.010> we<00:05:40.160> got

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:40.610 
our way up that we got

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:43.089 
our way up that we got
and<00:05:40.879> we<00:05:41.030> got<00:05:41.270> C<00:05:41.599> and<00:05:41.900> then<00:05:42.319> once<00:05:42.620> we<00:05:42.740> got<00:05:42.889> the

00:05:43.089 --> 00:05:43.099 
and we got C and then once we got the

00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:44.469 
and we got C and then once we got the
high<00:05:43.310> ground<00:05:43.340> as<00:05:43.939> you<00:05:44.000> can<00:05:44.090> see<00:05:44.240> some<00:05:44.360> of<00:05:44.389> my

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:44.479 
high ground as you can see some of my

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:46.029 
high ground as you can see some of my
teammates<00:05:44.719> around<00:05:45.139> you<00:05:45.530> know<00:05:45.620> the<00:05:45.770> different

teammates around you know the different

00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:49.179 
teammates around you know the different
spots<00:05:46.870> up<00:05:47.870> top<00:05:48.199> and<00:05:48.379> kept<00:05:48.560> that<00:05:48.680> vantage<00:05:48.949> point

00:05:49.179 --> 00:05:49.189 
spots up top and kept that vantage point

00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:50.860 
spots up top and kept that vantage point
once<00:05:49.370> we<00:05:49.460> got<00:05:49.550> the<00:05:49.639> vantage<00:05:49.939> point<00:05:49.969> and<00:05:50.479> then

00:06:57.129 --> 00:06:57.139 
tight choke points if you look at the

00:06:57.139 --> 00:06:59.019 
tight choke points if you look at the
map<00:06:57.349> and<00:06:57.409> you<00:06:58.039> might<00:06:58.190> imagine<00:06:58.370> berlin<00:06:58.849> wall

00:06:59.019 --> 00:06:59.029 
map and you might imagine berlin wall

00:06:59.029 --> 00:07:00.760 
map and you might imagine berlin wall
right<00:06:59.270> a<00:06:59.300> big<00:06:59.539> wall<00:06:59.779> kind<00:07:00.080> of<00:07:00.169> separating<00:07:00.680> the

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:00.770 
right a big wall kind of separating the

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:03.249 
right a big wall kind of separating the
map<00:07:00.979> but<00:07:01.639> there's<00:07:02.300> a<00:07:02.360> couple<00:07:02.509> breakpoints<00:07:03.199> in

00:07:03.249 --> 00:07:03.259 
map but there's a couple breakpoints in

00:07:03.259 --> 00:07:04.899 
map but there's a couple breakpoints in
it<00:07:03.409> and<00:07:03.560> you'll<00:07:03.740> see<00:07:03.979> at<00:07:04.460> the<00:07:04.550> start<00:07:04.819> of<00:07:04.849> the

00:07:04.899 --> 00:07:04.909 
it and you'll see at the start of the

00:07:04.909 --> 00:07:06.879 
it and you'll see at the start of the
map<00:07:05.060> everybody<00:07:05.389> again<00:07:05.599> filtering<00:07:06.110> out<00:07:06.229> going

00:07:06.879 --> 00:07:06.889 
map everybody again filtering out going

00:07:06.889 --> 00:07:09.459 
map everybody again filtering out going
their<00:07:07.009> separate<00:07:07.250> ways<00:07:07.960> kind<00:07:08.960> of<00:07:08.990> kind<00:07:09.259> of<00:07:09.379> get

00:07:09.459 --> 00:07:09.469 
their separate ways kind of kind of get

00:07:09.469 --> 00:07:10.510 
their separate ways kind of kind of get
in<00:07:09.529> the<00:07:09.620> position<00:07:09.680> but<00:07:09.949> here's<00:07:10.099> that<00:07:10.279> one<00:07:10.460> of

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:10.520 
in the position but here's that one of

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:11.829 
in the position but here's that one of
the<00:07:10.610> breakpoints<00:07:11.029> in<00:07:11.060> the<00:07:11.150> wall<00:07:11.330> so<00:07:11.569> you<00:07:11.689> go

00:07:11.829 --> 00:07:11.839 
the breakpoints in the wall so you go

00:07:11.839 --> 00:07:13.149 
the breakpoints in the wall so you go
through<00:07:12.110> here<00:07:12.319> and<00:07:12.439> there's<00:07:12.589> just<00:07:12.770> like<00:07:12.919> no

00:07:13.149 --> 00:07:13.159 
through here and there's just like no

00:07:13.159 --> 00:07:15.040 
through here and there's just like no
man's<00:07:13.400> land<00:07:13.550> that<00:07:14.029> is<00:07:14.060> that<00:07:14.689> exists<00:07:14.990> between

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:15.050 
man's land that is that exists between

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:17.079 
man's land that is that exists between
the<00:07:15.610> breakpoints<00:07:16.610> and<00:07:16.639> you'll<00:07:16.819> see<00:07:16.969> it's

00:07:17.079 --> 00:07:17.089 
the breakpoints and you'll see it's

00:07:17.089 --> 00:07:18.640 
the breakpoints and you'll see it's
represented<00:07:17.479> by<00:07:17.539> red<00:07:17.750> but<00:07:18.139> if<00:07:18.229> you<00:07:18.289> try<00:07:18.439> to<00:07:18.469> go

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:18.650 
represented by red but if you try to go

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:20.320 
represented by red but if you try to go
through<00:07:18.889> it<00:07:19.069> this<00:07:19.279> alarm<00:07:19.610> sound<00:07:19.909> and<00:07:20.210> there's

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:20.330
