into<00:01:36.030> those<00:01:36.119> electronics<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:36.930> I<00:01:37.110> just<00:01:37.320> use<00:01:37.439> a

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
into those electronics and I just use a

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.960 
into those electronics and I just use a
little<00:01:37.590> bit<00:01:37.860> of<00:01:37.890> a<00:01:38.009> rag<00:01:38.189> on<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.430> side<00:01:38.670> to<00:01:38.700> kind

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
little bit of a rag on the side to kind

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.060 
little bit of a rag on the side to kind

of mop up the mess of the liquid that
comes<00:01:41.280> out<00:01:41.579> now<00:01:42.240> what<00:01:42.420> I<00:01:42.450> did<00:01:42.720> do<00:01:42.899> for<00:01:43.140> this<00:01:43.229> is

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
comes out now what I did do for this is

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.170 
comes out now what I did do for this is
I<00:01:43.530> did<00:01:43.710> take<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:43.950> hair<00:01:44.280> dryer<00:01:44.549> to<00:01:44.579> speed<00:01:44.729> up<00:01:45.090> the

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
I did take a hair dryer to speed up the

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.120 
I did take a hair dryer to speed up the
process<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:45.869> i<00:01:46.049> run<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.380> hair<00:01:46.590> dryer<00:01:46.799> on<00:01:46.979> it

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
process and i run the hair dryer on it

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.039 
process and i run the hair dryer on it
to<00:01:47.220> kind<00:01:47.369> of<00:01:47.549> get<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:47.970> liquid<00:01:48.450> dried<00:01:48.780> on<00:01:48.960> the

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
to kind of get the liquid dried on the

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.929 
to kind of get the liquid dried on the
inside<00:01:49.350> that<00:01:49.530> way<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.799> material<00:01:50.549> will<00:01:50.640> stick

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
inside that way the material will stick

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.569 
inside that way the material will stick
faster<00:01:51.420> but<00:01:51.810> it<00:01:51.899> does<00:01:52.079> take<00:01:52.409> about<00:01:52.680> 48<00:01:53.490> hours

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
faster but it does take about 48 hours

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.330 
faster but it does take about 48 hours
to<00:01:53.970> fully<00:01:54.329> cure<00:01:54.720> but<00:01:55.170> in<00:01:55.290> about<00:01:55.530> maybe<00:01:55.799> an<00:01:56.100> hour

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
to fully cure but in about maybe an hour

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.830 
to fully cure but in about maybe an hour
it<00:01:56.759> will<00:01:56.909> be<00:01:57.030> stuck<00:01:57.270> down<00:01:57.420> enough<00:01:57.689> to<00:01:57.719> where

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
it will be stuck down enough to where

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.120 
it will be stuck down enough to where
you<00:01:57.960> not<00:01:58.079> to<00:01:58.200> worry<00:01:58.259> about<00:01:58.409> sliding<00:01:58.740> around
