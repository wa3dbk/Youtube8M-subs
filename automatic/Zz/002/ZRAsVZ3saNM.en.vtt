likely something she's stepping in in
the<00:01:42.390> yard<00:01:42.960> because<00:01:43.710> halo<00:01:44.280> does<00:01:44.490> have

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
meat it gets really bad and that's when

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.000 
meat it gets really bad and that's when
I<00:02:42.760> know<00:02:42.909> when<00:02:43.299> it<00:02:43.569> gets<00:02:43.750> at<00:02:43.900> that<00:02:43.930> point<00:02:44.379> that

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
I know when it gets at that point that

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.210 
I know when it gets at that point that
she<00:02:45.069> has<00:02:45.670> a<00:02:46.170> secondary<00:02:47.170> infection<00:02:47.409> so<00:02:47.950> at<00:02:48.069> that

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
she has a secondary infection so at that

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.729 
she has a secondary infection so at that
point<00:02:48.549> I'll<00:02:49.150> use<00:02:49.510> my<00:02:49.720> two<00:02:49.780> medicines<00:02:50.290> that<00:02:50.680> I

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
point I'll use my two medicines that I

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.309 
point I'll use my two medicines that I
have<00:02:51.069> for<00:02:51.459> her<00:02:51.730> as<00:02:52.030> well<00:02:52.359> as<00:02:52.540> an<00:02:52.659> antibiotic

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:53.319 
have for her as well as an antibiotic

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:59.129 
have for her as well as an antibiotic
but<00:02:54.569> if<00:02:55.569> it<00:02:55.780> doesn't<00:02:56.169> turn<00:02:56.739> into<00:02:56.799> a<00:02:58.139> secondary

00:02:59.129 --> 00:02:59.139 
but if it doesn't turn into a secondary

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:01.289 
but if it doesn't turn into a secondary
infection<00:02:59.379> like<00:02:59.950> obviously<00:03:00.700> it's<00:03:00.790> not<00:03:01.060> right

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:01.299 
infection like obviously it's not right

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:03.599 
infection like obviously it's not right
now<00:03:01.510> because<00:03:01.840> it's<00:03:02.439> just<00:03:02.680> little<00:03:03.099> raw<00:03:03.340> it's

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:03.609 
now because it's just little raw it's

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:06.300 
now because it's just little raw it's
just<00:03:03.790> the<00:03:03.879> beginning<00:03:04.060> I<00:03:04.739> can<00:03:05.739> treat<00:03:06.099> it<00:03:06.250> with

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
just the beginning I can treat it with

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.720 
just the beginning I can treat it with
without<00:03:07.060> an<00:03:07.180> antibiotic<00:03:07.840> but<00:03:08.250> halo<00:03:09.250> has<00:03:09.489> some

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730

some that I've healed over and that is

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:52.289 
some that I've healed over and that is
