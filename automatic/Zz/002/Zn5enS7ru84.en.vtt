00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.309
 that he is but now it is time again 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.830
 world of warplanes holds again 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:19.420
 move in on this channel and of course 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:23.560
 It is also a special occasion there 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:26.320
 patch 1.8 has now been released in 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.210
 Endspurt with patch 1.8 are a few 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.859
 new great things are coming and that 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:33.010
 Let's start with the three new ones 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:36.640
 premium aircraft and that's it 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:38.559
 at the German bm 109 tl 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.570
 multipurpose hunter and you see over here 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:42.370
 already the values ​​the airspeed 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.890
 is pretty respectable 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.869
 maneuverability could therefore be better 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.790
 of that , please do not claus 

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:49.600
 kombat or not on dogfights there 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:54.940
 let in 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:57.790
 There are bombs at the start and rockets 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:01.059
 So something for everyone here commanded 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:04.269
 this is a 48 premium 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:07.210
 and you see the model you have to over 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:09.159
 tokens free games or 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.930
 I have new stamps on it 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:14.400
 but still the same, we remain first in 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:17.700
 the new eighth premium aircraft 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.140
 because then it goes on with the a-eleven 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.760
 a bus and here we have the whole 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.050
 classic but still the whole 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.880
 classic hunter you see 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.950
 maneuverability excellent 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.840
 performance is not so high and the 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.690
 Flight speed could also be something 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.120
 be more but just in close combat in the 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.800
 dog was for that I certainly very 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:40.090
 well 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:46.479
 and last but not least, the japanese have 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:47.979
 also one and that the j 8 m in the 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:50.200
 fall again a hunter though 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:51.700
 How to kyte in g-ba is here very much 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.170
 low for an incredibly high 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.090
 flight speed and a high 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.460
 performance so boom in zoom is here 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.040
 announced from that 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.820
 here again about these stamps 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:05.380
 to play freely 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.110
 In addition , we are now bringing value stamps 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.500
 They are now brand new 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.390
 here 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.750
 You can value these stamps 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:16.120
 buy that means for every club for 50 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.060
 gold gives it a value you can 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.499
 Also the value marks he plays over 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.510
 the orders you can see here 

00:02:20.499 --> 00:02:24.129
 that means for example with me it would be 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.210
 Now you make a counter-attack 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:27.430
 plane or a 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:29.470
 opposing multipurpose hunters and then 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.850
 the additional task assumes you three 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.800
 different types opposing 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.570
 planes in a battle when you 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.940
 then this is fulfilled then I am here 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:39.460
 you see, I do not have it yet 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.180
 I'll have him there soon 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:42.070
 what to do 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.140
 But I got for every login 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.730
 you currently have two stamps that means 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.500
 Let us look at the times that because there 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.910
 happens 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.250
 You can see the stamps here 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:54.790
 buy premium planes for cheap 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:58.150
 until accessories until real planes then 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.380
 since the turn gets the wheel a 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.720
 Consumables still and 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.850
 Consumable material and a long surfaces 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.800
 adjusting accessories in the case my 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:08.440
 happiness improves above 3% that is 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.060
 quite cool that is because both zack and 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.150
 I still have a world mark and then 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:16.480
 then look at the whole thing again 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:19.570
 happiness is a value brand and 9000 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.340
 credits and the received value stamp 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:24.490
 You can play the whole game again 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:27.550
 Incidentally, I think that's a great thing to do 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:28.720
 very, very nice, very yes that 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:32.070
 also promotes a bit the 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:36.270
 incentive to gamble I find cool 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:39.220
 So there are also in the patch and 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:40.630
 another news here 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.900
 brought new life 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:45.250
 consumables and accessories 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.350
 There are also aircraft anniversaries 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.790
 that means there are additional ones 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.250
 Rewards for the elders and 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.410
 most experienced aircraft which you 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.150
 Celebrate the anniversary so be careful 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:56.710
 because if he then one of these planes 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.430
 you can do something then again 

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:00.400
 dust off 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.710
 the last and even more drastic 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.020
 Changes in my opinion is that 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:07.210
 only currently rotten from two people 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:10.120
 and not as before from three 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:12.700
 So people can exist so from here 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.210
 of course, a point too 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.030
 respect, think highly of 

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:18.010
 but on the whole I think a lot 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:19.480
 nice and interesting patch and 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.310
 maybe once again for one 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.660
 or other interesting 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.160
 I will definitely do that 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.440
 will be one or the other let's play 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.240
 I hope you follow me again 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:31.110
 and I wish you all the best, see you soon 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.110
 caramba
