00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
because I'm just about ready to go off

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.309 
because I'm just about ready to go off
to<00:03:49.049> work<00:03:49.489> but<00:03:50.489> with<00:03:50.849> all<00:03:51.000> that<00:03:51.209> said<00:03:51.479> the

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 
to work but with all that said the

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:54.140 
to work but with all that said the
dynamics<00:03:52.859> have<00:03:52.979> changed<00:03:53.009> back<00:03:53.489> to<00:03:53.519> silver<00:03:53.970> for

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
dynamics have changed back to silver for

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.379 
dynamics have changed back to silver for
bargain<00:03:54.569> hunting<00:03:54.870> buying<00:03:55.139> now<00:03:55.409> okay<00:03:55.859> um<00:03:56.819> I

00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:57.389 
bargain hunting buying now okay um I

00:03:57.389 --> 00:03:59.270 
bargain hunting buying now okay um I
wish<00:03:57.780> I<00:03:57.900> would<00:03:58.079> have<00:03:58.109> made<00:03:58.290> this<00:03:58.439> video<00:03:58.739> back

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
wish I would have made this video back

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.899 
wish I would have made this video back
around<00:03:59.639> 35<00:04:00.209> but<00:04:01.199> I<00:04:01.470> guess<00:04:01.889> you<00:04:02.220> can't<00:04:02.699> hit<00:04:02.879> it

00:04:02.899 --> 00:04:02.909 
around 35 but I guess you can't hit it

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:04.490 
around 35 but I guess you can't hit it
any<00:04:03.060> better<00:04:03.299> than<00:04:03.569> hitting<00:04:03.720> hitting<00:04:04.379> the

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
any better than hitting hitting the

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.050 
any better than hitting hitting the
all-time<00:04:04.829> low<00:04:05.040> and<00:04:05.220> everyone<00:04:05.549> else<00:04:05.699> is<00:04:05.879> saying

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
all-time low and everyone else is saying

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.580 
all-time low and everyone else is saying
lots<00:04:06.269> can<00:04:06.540> go<00:04:06.659> a<00:04:06.689> little<00:04:06.870> bit<00:04:07.049> farther<00:04:07.290> down

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
lots can go a little bit farther down

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.860 
lots can go a little bit farther down
all<00:04:08.370> these<00:04:08.519> gurus<00:04:08.819> and<00:04:09.180> stuff<00:04:09.419> oh<00:04:09.599> it's<00:04:09.750> going

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
all these gurus and stuff oh it's going

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.629 
all these gurus and stuff oh it's going
to<00:04:09.989> be<00:04:10.049> going<00:04:10.379> a<00:04:10.409> little<00:04:10.799> bit<00:04:10.949> lower<00:04:11.189> innocent

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:11.639 
to be going a little bit lower innocent

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:12.979 
to be going a little bit lower innocent
and<00:04:11.879> I<00:04:11.909> figured<00:04:12.359> that<00:04:12.479> it<00:04:12.599> was<00:04:12.659> going<00:04:12.780> to<00:04:12.870> be

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
and I figured that it was going to be

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:15.050 
and I figured that it was going to be
right<00:04:13.139> around<00:04:13.259> where<00:04:13.590> it<00:04:13.650> was<00:04:13.799> and<00:04:14.040> it<00:04:14.819> looks

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
right around where it was and it looks

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.379 
right around where it was and it looks
as<00:04:15.209> if<00:04:15.269> now<00:04:15.629> that's<00:04:15.930> pretty<00:04:16.259> much<00:04:16.440> the<00:04:16.500> case<00:04:17.389> so

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:18.389 
as if now that's pretty much the case so

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:22.940 
as if now that's pretty much the case so
that's<00:04:19.079> it<00:04:20.030> here's<00:04:21.030> my<00:04:21.209> wall<00:04:22.049> street<00:04:22.349> meant<00:04:22.560> to

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
that's it here's my wall street meant to

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:24.129 
that's it here's my wall street meant to
10<00:04:23.159> ounce

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:24.139

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
pretty nice huh it's uh it's not like a

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.269 
pretty nice huh it's uh it's not like a
flat<00:04:34.159> finish<00:04:34.639> like<00:04:35.060> a<00:04:35.090> like<00:04:35.509> a<00:04:35.539> flat<00:04:36.279> struck

00:04:37.269 --> 00:04:37.279 
flat finish like a like a flat struck

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:41.140 
flat finish like a like a flat struck
finish<00:04:37.789> it's<00:04:38.599> not<00:04:38.749> a<00:04:38.810> proof<00:04:39.139> finish<00:04:39.939> it's<00:04:40.939> more

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150

00:04:43.269 --> 00:04:43.279 
like a frosty pearl type finish and

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:45.129 
like a frosty pearl type finish and
these<00:04:43.370> are<00:04:43.550> actually<00:04:43.849> pretty<00:04:44.060> unique<00:04:44.479> on<00:04:44.779> the

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:45.139 
these are actually pretty unique on the

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:48.070 
these are actually pretty unique on the
way<00:04:45.229> they've<00:04:45.409> been<00:04:45.439> struck<00:04:45.889> I<00:04:46.689> really<00:04:47.689> wish<00:04:47.870> my

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.080 
way they've been struck I really wish my

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.260 
way they've been struck I really wish my
web<00:04:48.289> cam<00:04:48.529> would<00:04:48.710> pick<00:04:48.919> that<00:04:49.129> up<00:04:49.159> but<00:04:49.699> it<00:04:49.849> really

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:50.270 
web cam would pick that up but it really

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.459 
web cam would pick that up but it really
does<00:04:50.479> not<00:04:50.659> serve<00:04:50.960> justice<00:04:52.960> he<00:04:53.960> really<00:04:54.199> can't

00:04:54.459 --> 00:04:54.469 
does not serve justice he really can't

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:58.119 
does not serve justice he really can't
see<00:04:54.740> it<00:04:54.830> very<00:04:54.889> well<00:04:55.270> well<00:04:56.620> but<00:04:57.620> I<00:04:57.650> was<00:04:57.889> debating

00:04:58.119 --> 00:04:58.129 
see it very well well but I was debating

00:04:58.129 --> 00:05:00.070 
see it very well well but I was debating
about<00:04:58.460> making<00:04:58.939> this<00:04:59.060> on<00:04:59.240> my<00:04:59.419> digital<00:04:59.810> camera

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 
about making this on my digital camera

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.450 
about making this on my digital camera
because<00:05:00.560> it<00:05:00.650> would<00:05:00.740> pick<00:05:00.889> up<00:05:01.009> the<00:05:01.099> quality

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460 
because it would pick up the quality

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:02.740 
because it would pick up the quality
better<00:05:01.580> but<00:05:01.879> I<00:05:01.909> don't<00:05:02.120> have<00:05:02.210> the<00:05:02.300> time<00:05:02.479> to<00:05:02.539> do

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:02.750 
better but I don't have the time to do

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:05.309 
better but I don't have the time to do
that<00:05:02.930> right<00:05:02.990> now<00:05:03.139> so<00:05:03.439> um<00:05:04.430> so<00:05:04.849> that's<00:05:05.090> my

00:05:05.309 --> 00:05:05.319 
that right now so um so that's my

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:08.409 
that right now so um so that's my
purchase<00:05:06.319> i<00:05:06.439> just<00:05:06.650> did<00:05:06.800> today<00:05:07.099> so<00:05:07.159> to<00:05:08.090> 10<00:05:08.270> ounce

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:08.419 
purchase i just did today so to 10 ounce

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:11.529 
purchase i just did today so to 10 ounce
bars<00:05:08.750> so<00:05:09.259> i<00:05:09.580> would<00:05:10.580> say<00:05:10.789> if<00:05:11.029> you<00:05:11.180> want<00:05:11.330> to<00:05:11.419> do

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:11.539 
bars so i would say if you want to do

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:13.540 
bars so i would say if you want to do
some<00:05:11.750> bargain<00:05:12.050> buying<00:05:12.259> at<00:05:12.529> these<00:05:12.770> prices<00:05:13.069> I

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550 
some bargain buying at these prices I

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:15.309 
some bargain buying at these prices I
would<00:05:14.210> say<00:05:14.360> silvers<00:05:14.719> probably<00:05:15.050> a<00:05:15.080> better<00:05:15.229> bet

00:05:15.309 --> 00:05:15.319 
would say silvers probably a better bet

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:17.619 
would say silvers probably a better bet
and<00:05:15.770> I<00:05:16.430> think<00:05:16.789> at<00:05:16.939> this<00:05:17.060> point<00:05:17.150> in<00:05:17.449> time

00:05:17.619 --> 00:05:17.629 
and I think at this point in time

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:20.409 
and I think at this point in time
Silver's<00:05:18.199> dynamics<00:05:18.740> have<00:05:18.889> changed<00:05:19.120> so<00:05:20.120> with

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:20.419 
Silver's dynamics have changed so with

that said I'll keep you updated um if

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:25.669 
that does change based upon what I'm

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:29.050
