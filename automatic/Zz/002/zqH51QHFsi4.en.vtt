00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
got their feet all the way out and what

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.490 
got their feet all the way out and what
that<00:01:53.820> does<00:01:54.000> it<00:01:54.240> makes<00:01:54.450> it<00:01:54.600> a<00:01:54.690> very<00:01:54.720> very<00:01:55.170> loose

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
that does it makes it a very very loose

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.850 
that does it makes it a very very loose
position<00:01:56.190> we<00:01:56.850> want<00:01:57.180> to<00:01:57.810> get<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.140> feet<00:01:58.440> pull

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
position we want to get the feet pull

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.399 
position we want to get the feet pull
back<00:01:59.190> and<00:01:59.909> we<00:01:59.970> want<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.390> feet<00:02:00.600> pull<00:02:00.869> back<00:02:01.110> I

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
back and we want the feet pull back I

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.469 
back and we want the feet pull back I
think<00:02:02.100> a<00:02:02.190> good<00:02:02.220> starting<00:02:02.760> point<00:02:02.970> is<00:02:03.210> when<00:02:03.390> the

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
think a good starting point is when the

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.109 
think a good starting point is when the
athlete<00:02:03.990> can<00:02:04.200> barely<00:02:05.070> get<00:02:05.250> their<00:02:05.460> ankle<00:02:05.880> or

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
athlete can barely get their ankle or

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.419 
athlete can barely get their ankle or
their<00:02:06.299> heel<00:02:06.659> to<00:02:07.140> touch<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.590> ground<00:02:07.799> so

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
their heel to touch the ground so

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:09.889 
their heel to touch the ground so
whether<00:02:08.789> these<00:02:09.030> we<00:02:09.239> might<00:02:09.420> actually<00:02:09.629> move

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
whether these we might actually move

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.140 
whether these we might actually move
them<00:02:10.080> back<00:02:10.110> maybe<00:02:10.470> another<00:02:10.830> inch<00:02:11.190> you<00:02:11.849> can<00:02:11.970> see

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
them back maybe another inch you can see

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.030 
them back maybe another inch you can see
how<00:02:12.269> his<00:02:12.420> foots<00:02:12.719> off<00:02:12.930> the<00:02:13.079> ground<00:02:13.319> and<00:02:13.560> then

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
how his foots off the ground and then

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.410 
how his foots off the ground and then
we're<00:02:14.129> going<00:02:14.219> to<00:02:14.310> have<00:02:14.459> them<00:02:14.609> smash<00:02:14.969> his<00:02:15.209> feet

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:06.879 
inches off that range of motion making a

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:09.000 
inches off that range of motion making a
