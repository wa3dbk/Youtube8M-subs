00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.580
 revolverlab.com with an eye on technology 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.240
 hello friends my name is Nikita 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.590
 Potap with you knowledge base from 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.590
 revolverlab.com today we'll talk about 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.859
 two companions aji sensory and hera 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.270
 sensors either in other words 

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:21.029
 accelerometers and gyros so 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.619
 turn on everybody loves the fairing 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.300
 to have a good rest you usually need 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.920
 fly so as not to overpay for the flight 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.720
 install on your phone or tablet 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.179
 elm applications to find cheap 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.740
 flight tickets 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:33.540
 First let's talk about the principle of work 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.000
 both sensors and so 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.010
 accelerometer is the simplest accelerometer 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.460
 is a weight suspended on 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.809
 a spring which is located in the housing and 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.090
 attached to the damper which extinguishes 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.100
 load oscillation during acceleration 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.170
 moving and somehow annoying 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.600
 spring these oscillations can be represented 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.399
 in the form of data and three such vessels 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.329
 perpendicular to each other 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.210
 can give us an idea 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.340
 as to how the subject is located 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.989
 in space but you understand what 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.180
 no one would shove such 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.820
 your iphone design 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.950
 harder principle of action of the same legs 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.619
 the load is replaced by the inertial mass which 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.990
 located in a very small chip of her 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.610
 position changes during acceleration and so 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.470
 you can determine the position of your 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.840
 smartphone in space gyroscope 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.790
 There are two types of mechanical and 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.040
 Optical interests us exactly 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.560
 mechanical and he turn more often 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.780
 Totally represented by a rotor gyro 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.670
 if it's very easy to explain his principle 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.320
 actions then imagine a spinning top 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.720
 which is very fast spinning and he 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.030
 placed in a frame of three rings at 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.220
 the movement of such a gyroscope top itself 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.070
 stay in place but the rings will start 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.259
 you can just move out of them 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.570
 this data and understand how is 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.149
 devices in space in order to 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.890
 determine position in space 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:52.229
 whether your device is a smartphone or 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.000
 gamepad manufacturers use different 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.759
 sensors for example in nintendo 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.219
 fanned from using three accelerometers 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.920
 but now manufacturers are doing so 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.780
 the way they take and the g-sensor and 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.290
 sensors use them in pairs then 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.970
 amazing results are obtained 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:11.790
 friends for today all in the comments 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.950
 leave your smart 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.690
 sometimes not very questions will try on 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.970
 Like they say put this video 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.950
 if you learned something useful and not 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.410
 forget to subscribe to our channel 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.650
 we have so much interesting ahead 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.650
 until
