nice<00:00:32.430> boots<00:00:32.759> I<00:00:33.000> would<00:00:33.180> definitely<00:00:33.360> say<00:00:33.660> these

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
nice boots I would definitely say these

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.340 
nice boots I would definitely say these
are<00:00:34.050> these<00:00:34.620> are<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.980> 2011<00:00:35.610> so<00:00:36.059> these<00:00:36.989> will

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
are these are the 2011 so these will

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.250 
are these are the 2011 so these will
probably<00:00:37.739> match<00:00:37.920> up<00:00:38.190> in<00:00:38.730> quality<00:00:39.030> to<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.690> 09

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
probably match up in quality to the 09

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.470 
probably match up in quality to the 09
hails<00:00:40.579> all<00:00:41.579> right<00:00:41.730> they<00:00:41.910> both<00:00:42.059> have<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.329> air

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
hails all right they both have the air

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.520 
hails all right they both have the air
coming<00:00:42.780> on<00:00:42.960> down<00:00:43.200> here<00:00:44.450> both<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.840> ruler

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
coming on down here both the ruler

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.850 
coming on down here both the ruler
definitely<00:00:46.980> has<00:00:47.100> better<00:00:47.840> calf<00:00:48.840> leg<00:00:49.500> support

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
definitely has better calf leg support

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.939 
definitely has better calf leg support
and<00:00:50.629> this<00:00:51.629> is<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.960> infant<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:54.379> liner<00:00:55.379> you<00:00:55.680> can

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
and this is the infant to liner you can

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.130 
and this is the infant to liner you can
get<00:00:56.160> a<00:00:56.190> better<00:00:56.430> view<00:00:56.699> that<00:00:56.910> darken<00:00:57.780> it<00:00:57.899> up<00:00:58.020> a

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
get a better view that darken it up a

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.299 
get a better view that darken it up a
little<00:00:58.260> so<00:00:58.379> you<00:00:58.440> can<00:00:58.559> say<00:00:58.710> yeah<00:00:58.890> there<00:00:59.129> it<00:00:59.219> is

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
little so you can say yeah there it is

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.250 
little so you can say yeah there it is
imprint<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.710> hold<00:01:01.710> over<00:01:01.890> here<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:03.260> imprint

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
imprint to hold over here the imprint

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.760 
imprint to hold over here the imprint
three<00:01:04.850> simple<00:01:05.930> just<00:01:06.930> one<00:01:07.080> step<00:01:07.290> up<00:01:07.470> from<00:01:07.500> each

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
three simple just one step up from each

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.750 
three simple just one step up from each
other<00:01:07.950> but<00:01:09.500> now<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.799> main<00:01:10.979> difference<00:01:11.520> in

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
other but now the main difference in

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.260 
other but now the main difference in
these<00:01:11.939> boots<00:01:12.530> probably<00:01:13.530> not<00:01:13.680> a<00:01:13.740> lot<00:01:13.830> actually

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
these boots probably not a lot actually

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.330 
these boots probably not a lot actually
since<00:01:15.270> these<00:01:15.540> are<00:01:15.600> these<00:01:16.409> Hales<00:01:16.710> are<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.220> own

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
since these are these Hales are the own

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.179 
since these are these Hales are the own
lines<00:01:17.960> you<00:01:18.960> can't<00:01:19.290> really<00:01:19.470> compare<00:01:19.920> them<00:01:20.159> to

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
lines you can't really compare them to

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.510 
lines you can't really compare them to
the<00:01:20.340> rulers<00:01:20.790> as<00:01:21.409> they<00:01:22.409> are<00:01:22.619> just<00:01:22.920> basically

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
the rulers as they are just basically

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.690 
the rulers as they are just basically
same<00:01:23.820> thing<00:01:24.000> with<00:01:24.119> laces<00:01:24.890> major<00:01:25.890> upgrade<00:01:26.490> to

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
same thing with laces major upgrade to

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.210 
same thing with laces major upgrade to
most<00:01:27.030> of<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.180> boots<00:01:27.360> now<00:01:27.570> on<00:01:27.810> toggle<00:01:28.560> the

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
most of the boots now on toggle the

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.710 
most of the boots now on toggle the
toggle<00:01:29.640> instead<00:01:30.030> of<00:01:30.119> having<00:01:30.240> this<00:01:30.390> yellow

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
toggle instead of having this yellow

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.980 
toggle instead of having this yellow
pull<00:01:31.020> and<00:01:31.290> push<00:01:31.680> push<00:01:32.369> being<00:01:32.640> locked<00:01:32.820> it<00:01:33.750> could

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
pull and push push being locked it could

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.170 
pull and push push being locked it could
have<00:01:34.320> it<00:01:34.560> was<00:01:35.040> a<00:01:35.070> little<00:01:35.369> difficult<00:01:35.670> out<00:01:36.030> of

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
have it was a little difficult out of

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.359 
have it was a little difficult out of
times<00:01:36.420> but<00:01:37.320> it's<00:01:37.860> much<00:01:38.220> much<00:01:38.460> easier<00:01:38.520> now<00:01:40.369> the

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
times but it's much much easier now the

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.469 
times but it's much much easier now the
new<00:01:41.549> one<00:01:41.810> let's<00:01:42.810> even<00:01:43.020> grab<00:01:43.290> these<00:01:43.409> out

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
new one let's even grab these out

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:49.730 
new one let's even grab these out
earlier<00:01:45.479> okay<00:01:47.540> this<00:01:48.540> is<00:01:48.720> much<00:01:49.079> stronger<00:01:49.409> time

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
earlier okay this is much stronger time

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.940 
earlier okay this is much stronger time
all<00:01:50.520> right<00:01:50.640> here<00:01:50.759> it<00:01:50.850> is<00:01:51.229> basically<00:01:52.229> you<00:01:52.860> would

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
all right here it is basically you would

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.039 
all right here it is basically you would
tighten<00:01:53.159> your<00:01:53.340> boot<00:01:53.520> with<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:54.000> string<00:01:54.240> push

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
tighten your boot with the string push

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.359 
tighten your boot with the string push
this<00:01:55.229> down<00:01:55.439> and<00:01:55.680> then<00:01:55.829> you<00:01:55.920> push<00:01:56.159> down<00:01:56.189> the

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
this down and then you push down the

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.280 
this down and then you push down the
black<00:01:56.640> part<00:01:56.909> and<00:01:57.119> it's<00:01:57.570> much<00:01:57.780> much<00:01:57.960> stronger

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
black part and it's much much stronger

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.649 
black part and it's much much stronger
and<00:01:58.619> doesn't<00:01:58.950> loosen<00:01:59.100> up<00:01:59.280> at<00:01:59.399> all<00:01:59.520> the<00:02:00.360> bet

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
and doesn't loosen up at all the bet

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.459 
and doesn't loosen up at all the bet
better<00:02:01.140> design<00:02:01.500> works<00:02:02.040> fantastic<00:02:03.049> alright<00:02:04.049> so

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
better design works fantastic alright so

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.660 
better design works fantastic alright so
reviewing<00:02:05.369> these<00:02:05.490> boots<00:02:06.229> Hales<00:02:07.229> I<00:02:07.560> would<00:02:08.459> give

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
reviewing these boots Hales I would give

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.020 
reviewing these boots Hales I would give
these

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
these

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:16.740 
these
a<00:02:12.780> four<00:02:13.780> to<00:02:14.020> five<00:02:14.260> stars<00:02:14.819> for<00:02:15.819> the<00:02:15.880> price<00:02:16.450> I

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
a four to five stars for the price I

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.510 
a four to five stars for the price I
think<00:02:16.990> they<00:02:17.650> could<00:02:17.800> have<00:02:17.920> gone<00:02:18.010> a<00:02:18.069> little<00:02:18.280> bit

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
think they could have gone a little bit

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.199 
think they could have gone a little bit
