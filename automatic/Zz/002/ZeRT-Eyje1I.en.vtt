00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.250 
controls are very nice the application
it<00:03:22.160> works<00:03:22.370> fine<00:03:22.760> as<00:03:22.970> well<00:03:23.120> the<00:03:23.570> works<00:03:23.810> of<00:03:23.959> most

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
it works fine as well the works of most

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.099 
it works fine as well the works of most
TVs<00:03:24.709> there's<00:03:24.980> a<00:03:25.070> huge<00:03:25.340> list<00:03:25.640> of<00:03:25.790> them<00:03:26.030> TV<00:03:26.900> Brad

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:27.109 
TVs there's a huge list of them TV Brad

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:30.250 
TVs there's a huge list of them TV Brad
so<00:03:27.400> more<00:03:28.400> than<00:03:28.430> likely<00:03:28.579> that<00:03:29.180> it<00:03:30.049> will<00:03:30.109> be

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
so more than likely that it will be

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:31.960 
so more than likely that it will be
compatible<00:03:30.920> with<00:03:31.100> your<00:03:31.280> TV<00:03:31.609> if<00:03:31.670> you<00:03:31.760> have<00:03:31.880> an

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
compatible with your TV if you have an

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.370 
compatible with your TV if you have an
unbranded<00:03:32.890> TV<00:03:33.890> it<00:03:34.519> may<00:03:34.850> not<00:03:34.880> work<00:03:35.120> but<00:03:35.600> for<00:03:36.320> the

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
unbranded TV it may not work but for the

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.259 
unbranded TV it may not work but for the
most<00:03:36.560> part<00:03:36.680> it<00:03:37.010> does<00:03:37.160> work<00:03:37.430> just<00:03:37.730> fine<00:03:37.910> on<00:03:38.120> my

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:38.269 
most part it does work just fine on my

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:41.680 
most part it does work just fine on my
