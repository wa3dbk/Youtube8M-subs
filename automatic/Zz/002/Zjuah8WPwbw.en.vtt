00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.500
 beautiful and the otters and the seals 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.120
 will fly, maybe not, but you can see 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.990
 way to jump three meters above 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:19.920
 of water and enough is enough for me to get out of here 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.920

 everything that is in that tree 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:40.660
 squirrel any squirrel is a 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.660
 fan 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:50.940
 I know how I'm going to say this friend 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:56.390
 my wine does not work that she sees you follow 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:56.390
 something fantastic something that can be 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.660
 it's an animal that flies in earnest I have 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.740
 lots of creatures that can 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:08.340
 fly 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:11.319
 a hummingbird or butterflies that have dream 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.700
 but I still understand how it is with an owl 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:18.450
 to a wasp 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:21.450

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.450
 Thank you 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.550
 so it is so that it is a small world and 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.490
 evil 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:30.290
 that's how it is spoken but now instead of having 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:34.700
 one that stands out we have too many 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:37.000
 so many options all beautiful no 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.700
 it's a problem if you want to know my life 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.060
 emotional and sight is also 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:46.670
 do you have any bat scratched but not 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:51.400
 I have a flamenco that wants to greet you 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.400
 that was for the time the art 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:00.540

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.540
 force 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.550
