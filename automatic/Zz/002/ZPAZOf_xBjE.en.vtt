00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 in nurseries brochen in vain with 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.540
 edith rosierists we will you 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:10.940
 explain how to prune a rose bush 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.940
 shrubs or landscape 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.609
 let's start with the explanation of 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.160
 rose bushes or shrubs 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.330
 I said this then actually rose 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.369
 going back so it's a rose bush that 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.500
 blooming not a climbing rose on 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.400
 people amalgamate between measure 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.199
 my time I think this is going to be 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.599
 important is a rosé that flourishes again 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:34.230
 who took over several times in the year 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.910
 and a rose bush so shrubs are called 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.460
 arbus as opposed to so-called 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.809
 the dwarf roses that can be pretty 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.250
 high actually a lady worker at meilhan 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.700
 which can easily go up to one meter 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.399
 fifty 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.059
 but by contrast its dwarf roses 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:46.829
 obligatorily it is necessary to detail at 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.660
 three eyes every year while at 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.760
 shrub roses and ben we take it back 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.190
 size it as a referee so here we have 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.960
 deal with this kind of rosières to 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.640
 airbus and we can see it well since it has 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.289
 a certain volume it is practically 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.940
 one meter to one meter fifty in height 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.070
 for there is already a pre size has it 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.840
 already been cut then you will us 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.030
 explain now or should we size 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.340
 and what kind of roses then so the 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.140
 principle it's always the same as a 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.880
 shrub so the goal is every time 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.979
 to rejuvenate the foot 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.600
 well there we see for example the two 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.759
 branches a little parallel we say good 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.189
 there is one too good one cuts of 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.990
 preferably the oldest one here is 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:27.500
 avoid the branches I think that's it 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.500
 exactly so normally we try 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:35.189
 here is forgiveness but we always saw the 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.130
 little twigs a little dead wood 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:40.520
 both competitions always on 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.649
 healthy foundations 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.579
 this rose is going to age it starts to 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.740
 to grow old is what we must suppress 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.869
 a few twigs at the base when he 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.119
 start a little but here's sent as 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.040
 it has already been done on average saddle 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.049
 wake we cut it was detail of 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.909
 last year we cut the woods and 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.610
 see this is the young shoots of 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.680
 this year is so here it was 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.570
 re-cut and see each time the 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.479
 young shoots in fact so 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.890
 actually it's really the thing the 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.300
 most important to do is always 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.220
 cut from old wood but completely 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.090
 at the base and not avoid all 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.580
 sizes and as sometimes we see 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.980
 homogeneously on all 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.640
 actors here and then after the announced it 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.200
 must rejuvenate 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.989
 then this rose will go up to what 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.670
 height me I maintain it pretty much 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:26.530
 good this rose bush this variety is called 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.420
 rush a dock it's a flower variety 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.250
 simple very floriferous which blooms 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.200
 practically until big frosts 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.849
 single pink french rose flowers with 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.260
 a white heart and it's a rose tree that 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:37.780
 goes up about that height there and 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.010
 then who makes us a beautiful tuft 40 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.709
 is the right size and the 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.180
 roses when he is in bloom good me 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:44.709
 I normally find roses 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.810
 it was to stay in the garden but 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.280
 why not cut a little button 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.690
 remember the name of the variety so 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.910
 where this time the latter it is called 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:55.920
 rock rock and it's a rose bush 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.920
 shrubs
