00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:07.710
 hello everybody I'm the blog mona lisa 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.480
 Daily lactose recipe and today came 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.490
 show you how you do it 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.500
 coconut condensed milk brigadeiro 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.929
 in two versions with coconut milk 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.929
 coconut milk and industrialized coconut milk 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.740
 the recipe of the brigadier contains only 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:36.329
 two ingredients and contains no milk 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:38.250
 soy gluten or eggs to prepare the 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:42.770
 homemade coconut milk you will need 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.770
 of 300 grams of dry coconut pulp 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:53.730
 beat the pulp in the blender with 500ml 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:56.809
 of warm water and kohl on a flight to or on 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.809
 fine mesh cloth 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.750
 close well to make the most of the 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.909
 milk 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.740
 pour the milk into a saucepan and heat 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.740
 until it starts to form balls 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:16.590
 put one-half cup of demerara sugar 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:20.370
 From now on, there 's no fire. 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.680
 low and stirring nonstop you need 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:24.600
 waiting for the milk to halve and 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.990
 This will take about 30 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.990
 minutes 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:35.160
 just look at the 500 ml of milk that people 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:44.910
 put it all about it then you mean 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:46.830
 that my milk is ready 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:57.360
 the condensate became golden because I 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:02:01.590
 I used the demerara sugar after 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:03.450
 We took the fire he gets that way the 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.940
 homemade coconut milk he has less 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.690
 fat than coconut milk and 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.360
 industrialized then it will end 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:12.720
 yielding a little less than my yielded 200 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:15.060
 ml to make the brigadier the growing 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.340
 50 grams of medium bar chocolate 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.870
 bitter or bitter to condensed milk 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:23.239
 still warm coconut 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.239
 stir until melting fire 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:39.040
 When melting will get this way. 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:40.989
 then we return to the pot the people there 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.030
 Just fiddle with a maximum of three 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:45.370
 minutes to school at the bottom of the pan 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.470
 like this 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.950
 careful not to overcook if not 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:55.390
 chocolate will burn 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:03:09.160
 pour into a glass refractory and 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:11.590
 I need to refrigerate until the 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.360
 brigadeiro is very firm even is 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.860
 leave a little bit outside the 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:22.150
 refrigerator to get to the 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:24.459
 balls pass the balls and passinho 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:28.230
 you will realize that the 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:28.230
 granulate does not stick so easily 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:33.790
 I passed a different granulate to 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.440
 to differentiate for you the 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.620
 brigadeiro made with coconut milk 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.130
 natural and with coconut milk 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.650
 industrialized 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:45.640
 then I 'll leave it in the video is the mark 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:48.100
 of all the products I used that 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.540
 There is no secret, and now we are going. 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.760
 make the coconut milk version 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:54.510
 industrialized because this sim can be 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.510
 treacherous 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:02.410
 Coconut milk for this recipe does not 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.329
 can be in the light version choose a 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.190
 brand that has the coconut law as the 

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:08.410
 first ingredient in the listing of 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.510
 ingredients and do not forget that you 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.790
 is taking all these 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:13.750
 preservatives not present in milk 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.910
 natural coconut 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.750
 then, whenever possible, make your 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.750
 home bound 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:24.030
 from now on the procedure is the 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.190
 same 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.900
 pour the coconut milk into the pan and 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.680
 let it warm up to start with a 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.680
 marbles 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:38.220
 add half a cup of sugar 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:45.810
 demerara and stir without stopping to reduce 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:48.030
 the difference in the amount of 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:50.420
 fat is very visible and you can see a 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:53.100
 puddle of fat in the pan 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:55.610
 do not forget to always keep the fire 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.610
 low 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:03.080
 the texture is also more creamy 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.590
 now the milk is ready 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:23.039
 in God 50 more 250 ml 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.809
 Now I'll tell you a problem that is 

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:26.699
 very common to happen 

00:05:24.809 --> 00:05:29.309
 coconut milk it can drop a lot 

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:31.830
 fat then when we continue with 

00:05:29.309 --> 00:05:34.409
 the recipe would usually add 50 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:37.409
 grams of chocolate in milk bar 

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:43.889
 Hot condensate stirs until melted 

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:45.300
 chocolate and then we go back to 

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:47.699
 pan on the fire 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:50.159
 Look what a horrible thing you've seen not 

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:52.710
 will never turn bombs right because 

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:55.169
 fat it 's all out of the mix 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:57.930
 so to solve this we need 

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:59.969
 hit this mix as was I will not 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:02.159
 I get back to you beating 

00:05:59.969 --> 00:06:03.899
 ex could not hold the camera and 

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:05.789
 hit it at the same time, right? 

00:06:03.899 --> 00:06:07.409
 but so after hitting a little 

00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:09.330
 Look how he looks 

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:11.219
 it comes back with the normal texture stay 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:13.529
 more like the brigadeiro 

00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:16.229
 So, once you got nekemte, you got it. 

00:06:13.529 --> 00:06:18.810
 to hit this mix is â€‹â€‹just to go back to the 

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:21.509
 fire and continuity 

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:25.339
 leaving a maximum of three minutes and 

00:06:21.509 --> 00:06:25.339
 stirring until school from the bottom of the pan 

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:39.770
 that way , just pour a 

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:42.340
 Video refractory and lead to refrigerator 

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:42.340
 to sign 

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:52.850
 look how much creamier it gets and if 

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:59.870
 me to portray yuan before taking 

00:06:52.850 --> 00:07:01.700
 refrigerator and after firing you 

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:04.430
 can find white dots 

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:11.330
 equal to these and second dura and should be 

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:13.220
 removed and pass the polka dots 

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:15.500
 You'll realize it 's a little more 

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:18.190
 easy because it is a little softer 

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:18.190
 to do 

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:23.070
 ah 

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:31.490
 and pass the balls in the granulate 

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:44.320
 so this is it this is our version of 

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:46.270
 brigadier without lactose 

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:48.790
 stay like that with coconut milk 

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:50.800
 in the background but is delicious mainly 

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:52.750
 if you use a great chocolate 

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:55.650
 quality 

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:55.650
 a big kiss
