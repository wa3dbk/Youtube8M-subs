00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
cats or my hamstrings over back until

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
cats or my hamstrings over back until
lower<00:02:47.400> back<00:02:47.730> should<00:02:48.330> be<00:02:48.980> flexible<00:02:49.980> because<00:02:50.520> if

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
lower back should be flexible because if

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.040 
lower back should be flexible because if
it<00:02:51.120> isn't<00:02:51.690> you're<00:02:52.410> not<00:02:52.560> able<00:02:52.890> to<00:02:53.600> tilt<00:02:54.600> your

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
it isn't you're not able to tilt your

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.310 
it isn't you're not able to tilt your
pelvis<00:02:55.110> to<00:02:55.860> the<00:02:55.890> front<00:02:56.280> okay<00:02:56.910> which<00:02:57.630> is<00:02:57.840> which

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
pelvis to the front okay which is which

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.009 
pelvis to the front okay which is which
is<00:02:58.350> very<00:02:58.530> very<00:02:59.010> important<00:02:59.519> here<00:02:59.840> to<00:03:00.840> have

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
is very very important here to have

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:04.729 
is very very important here to have
tension<00:03:01.459> in<00:03:02.459> your<00:03:02.850> back<00:03:03.300> muscles<00:03:03.360> and<00:03:04.200> if<00:03:04.650> you

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
tension in your back muscles and if you

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:06.500 
tension in your back muscles and if you
have<00:03:04.860> tension<00:03:05.130> here<00:03:05.489> you<00:03:05.640> have<00:03:05.790> more<00:03:06.060> tension

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
have tension here you have more tension

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.220 
have tension here you have more tension
in<00:03:06.660> the<00:03:07.530> muscles<00:03:07.920> of<00:03:08.190> you<00:03:08.940> but<00:03:09.150> me<00:03:09.390> relax<00:03:09.690> too

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
in the muscles of you but me relax too

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.880 
in the muscles of you but me relax too
so<00:03:10.739> this<00:03:10.950> is<00:03:11.100> very<00:03:11.250> very<00:03:11.489> important<00:03:12.590> that<00:03:13.590> you

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
so this is very very important that you

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.390 
so this is very very important that you
are<00:03:13.920> able<00:03:14.280> to<00:03:14.519> talk<00:03:15.000> about<00:03:15.120> the<00:03:15.570> back<00:03:16.040> to<00:03:17.040> the

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
are able to talk about the back to the

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.960 
are able to talk about the back to the
front<00:03:17.670> and<00:03:18.590> starting<00:03:19.590> from<00:03:19.890> your<00:03:20.100> pelvis<00:03:20.610> take

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
front and starting from your pelvis take

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.740 
front and starting from your pelvis take
care<00:03:21.360> that<00:03:21.780> you<00:03:21.930> have<00:03:22.350> the<00:03:22.799> tension<00:03:23.760> in<00:03:24.690> your

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
care that you have the tension in your

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.810 
care that you have the tension in your
the<00:03:25.620> the<00:03:25.650> whole<00:03:26.160> back

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
the the whole back

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.270 
the the whole back
so<00:03:27.150> what<00:03:27.690> is<00:03:27.810> very<00:03:28.019> important<00:03:28.530> here<00:03:28.829> is<00:03:29.010> that

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
so what is very important here is that

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.449 
so what is very important here is that
you<00:03:29.579> push<00:03:30.299> your<00:03:30.810> chest<00:03:31.079> to<00:03:31.290> the<00:03:31.320> front<00:03:31.560> maybe

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
you push your chest to the front maybe

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:35.390 
you push your chest to the front maybe
by<00:03:32.790> breathing<00:03:33.090> in<00:03:33.360> you<00:03:33.480> lift<00:03:34.170> your<00:03:34.500> chest<00:03:34.709> up

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
by breathing in you lift your chest up

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.360 
by breathing in you lift your chest up
and<00:03:35.640> then<00:03:36.420> let<00:03:36.840> your<00:03:37.049> shoulders<00:03:37.620> sing<00:03:38.010> down

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
and then let your shoulders sing down

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.060 
and then let your shoulders sing down
and<00:03:38.730> now<00:03:39.450> if<00:03:39.750> you<00:03:39.900> if<00:03:40.170> you<00:03:40.260> perform<00:03:40.799> the

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
and now if you if you perform the

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.120 
and now if you if you perform the
exercise<00:03:41.610> always<00:03:42.269> push<00:03:42.630> your<00:03:42.870> chest<00:03:43.130> hardly

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
exercise always push your chest hardly

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
when I go down

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.749 
when I go down
in<00:04:25.479> a<00:04:25.780> breeze<00:04:25.960> out<00:04:26.819> when<00:04:27.819> I<00:04:27.849> go<00:04:28.030> up<00:04:29.400> if<00:04:30.400> you<00:04:30.729> are

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
not that exhausts already maybe you want

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.270 
not that exhausts already maybe you want
to<00:04:34.419> prefer<00:04:34.780> it<00:04:34.810> to<00:04:34.960> to<00:04:35.289> Berlin<00:04:35.650> which<00:04:35.979> means

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 
to prefer it to to Berlin which means

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.360 
to prefer it to to Berlin which means
you<00:04:36.940> inhale<00:04:37.419> by<00:04:38.319> going<00:04:38.620> down<00:04:38.770> and<00:04:38.979> up<00:04:39.069> and<00:04:39.129> you

you inhale by going down and up and you

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.899
