intercession was about 18 years ago I
felt<00:02:11.800> like<00:02:11.920> the<00:02:12.040> Lord<00:02:12.250> spoke<00:02:12.550> to<00:02:12.580> me<00:02:12.819> one

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
felt like the Lord spoke to me one

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.339 
felt like the Lord spoke to me one
morning<00:02:13.209> when<00:02:13.390> I<00:02:13.450> woke<00:02:13.659> up<00:02:13.870> and<00:02:14.019> he<00:02:14.110> said<00:02:14.319> I

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349 
morning when I woke up and he said I

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:16.320 
morning when I woke up and he said I
want<00:02:14.680> you<00:02:14.739> to<00:02:14.860> carry<00:02:15.159> joy<00:02:15.519> and<00:02:15.730> intercession

I feel like we're in such an incredible
season<00:07:13.580> I<00:07:13.759> feel<00:07:13.789> like<00:07:14.659> God<00:07:14.869> is<00:07:14.899> taking<00:07:15.439> his

00:07:15.579 --> 00:07:15.589 
season I feel like God is taking his

00:07:15.589 --> 00:07:17.589 
season I feel like God is taking his
champions<00:07:16.219> his<00:07:16.399> children<00:07:16.849> and<00:07:16.969> he's<00:07:17.089> parading

00:07:17.589 --> 00:07:17.599 
champions his children and he's parading

00:07:17.599 --> 00:07:19.689 
champions his children and he's parading
them<00:07:17.749> before<00:07:18.019> the<00:07:18.169> world<00:07:18.349> right<00:07:18.649> now<00:07:18.830> so<00:07:19.669> I

00:07:19.689 --> 00:07:19.699 
them before the world right now so I

00:07:19.699 --> 00:07:21.759 
them before the world right now so I
think<00:07:19.789> it's<00:07:20.059> a<00:07:20.179> real<00:07:20.389> mindset<00:07:21.139> that<00:07:21.379> we<00:07:21.529> need

00:07:21.759 --> 00:07:21.769 
think it's a real mindset that we need

00:07:21.769 --> 00:07:23.529 
think it's a real mindset that we need
to<00:07:21.889> become<00:07:22.039> who<00:07:22.669> we<00:07:22.909> really<00:07:23.149> are

00:07:23.529 --> 00:07:23.539 
to become who we really are

00:07:23.539 --> 00:07:26.499 
to become who we really are
and<00:07:24.319> not<00:07:24.529> focus<00:07:24.979> on<00:07:25.129> the<00:07:25.279> world<00:07:25.490> matters<00:07:25.879> but

00:07:26.499 --> 00:07:26.509 
and not focus on the world matters but

00:07:26.509 --> 00:07:28.989 
and not focus on the world matters but
focus<00:07:26.869> on<00:07:27.050> who<00:07:27.349> we<00:07:27.529> are<00:07:27.800> and<00:07:28.009> what<00:07:28.459> he<00:07:28.580> wants<00:07:28.879> us

00:07:28.989 --> 00:07:28.999 
focus on who we are and what he wants us

00:07:28.999 --> 00:07:32.049 
focus on who we are and what he wants us
