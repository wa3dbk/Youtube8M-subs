00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.540 

so<00:02:18.020> a<00:02:18.050> lot<00:02:18.440> of<00:02:18.590> things<00:02:18.860> that<00:02:19.010> you<00:02:19.100> read<00:02:19.310> will

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
so a lot of things that you read will

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.420 
so a lot of things that you read will
say<00:02:19.790> stay<00:02:20.270> away<00:02:20.569> from<00:02:21.069> oil-based<00:02:22.069> paint

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
say stay away from oil-based paint

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.480 
say stay away from oil-based paint
lead-based<00:02:22.910> paint<00:02:23.510> etc<00:02:23.750> I<00:02:24.470> think<00:02:25.130> the<00:02:25.250> worst

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.490 
lead-based paint etc I think the worst

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.000 
lead-based paint etc I think the worst
paint<00:02:25.819> you<00:02:25.970> can<00:02:26.150> use<00:02:26.300> is<00:02:26.510> spray<00:02:26.840> paint<00:02:27.170> because

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
paint you can use is spray paint because

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.520 
paint you can use is spray paint because
it's<00:02:28.220> just<00:02:28.840> in<00:02:29.840> the<00:02:30.140> air<00:02:30.430> so<00:02:31.480> I<00:02:32.480> took<00:02:33.230> that

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
it's just in the air so I took that

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.040 
it's just in the air so I took that
advice<00:02:33.680> and<00:02:34.190> I<00:02:34.730> started<00:02:35.090> for<00:02:35.300> looking<00:02:35.870> for

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
advice and I started for looking for

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.140 
advice and I started for looking for
different<00:02:36.320> paints<00:02:36.740> that<00:02:36.800> I<00:02:36.920> could<00:02:37.190> use<00:02:37.520> and

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
different paints that I could use and

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.860 
different paints that I could use and
materials<00:02:38.810> and<00:02:38.959> whatnot<00:02:39.320> and<00:02:39.590> what<00:02:40.160> I<00:02:40.190> found

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
materials and whatnot and what I found

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.740 
materials and whatnot and what I found
was<00:02:41.870> that<00:02:42.200> there's<00:02:43.130> not<00:02:43.459> a<00:02:43.790> lot<00:02:44.090> of<00:02:44.120> paints

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
was that there's not a lot of paints

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.490 
was that there's not a lot of paints

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
watercolors are okay but really when it

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.650 
watercolors are okay but really when it
