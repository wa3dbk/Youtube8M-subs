 Hi everyone Thank you for always watching videos and homepage 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:14.929
 This guitar course is how to hold the chord of c 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:17.180
 It is the basics of the basics on starting guitar, but about how to hold the chord of c 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:22.250
 I will talk 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:24.630
 Very, very basic for those who say standing began guitar from its previous little it is today 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.230
 Introduce you to 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.160
 First of all 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:33.540
 1 fret per fret 3 fret 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.410
 I think some people don't know what it means, so let me enter from there 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:40.230
 You will receive 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:45.449
 Pressing Kedomo the 1 fret I I mean Tsu fret that of the border but it is here 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:47.140
 When counting from the part 1 fret per fret 3 frets 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:56.079
 In the manner of 4 frets 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:01:01.270
 Counting will continue in addition but is about the matter even one string 2 string from the thinner 3-string 4-string 5-string 6 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:06.430
 While we are counted two Tteyuu string will be based on it 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:07.740
 I will enter the commentary of the code, but everyone tuning is fine 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.820
 Is not it 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:16.820
 Tuning and the now count from the direction of the 6-string 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.820
 Scene Tsu it's 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:25.950
 How many years ago 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.760
 If this tuning is not properly done, the correct chord gold is also suppressed 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:32.440
 I can not remember 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:35.830
 We First I would like to enter from the firm Â¥ tuning Now of c 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:39.180
 I will enter the commentary of how to hold the code of 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.180
 First forefinger 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:49.470
 1 fret of 3 strings 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:49.470
 It is 1 fret of 2 strings, so the middle finger is 4 frets of 4 strings 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:58.960
 The middle finger is a 2 fret with 4 strings 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.630
 5 frets 3 frets 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:05.329
 Then 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.329
 In the case of this code of c, it plays from the word source 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.390
 Yup 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.290
 This sound 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.410
 Yup 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:20.480
 However, did it come out 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:24.970
 The important thing is that the way you hold it down, but whether it sounds properly 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:31.260
 The very first is still got to touch the matter of somewhere of sound next 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:32.330
 Often there because is possible to Toka or ended up with a sound like I was also so 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:38.490
 this 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:42.620
 Please try to challenge while checking whether the correct sound comes out 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:43.580
 Playing chords of even c I was easy 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.750
 was 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.750
 Thank you for your viewing
