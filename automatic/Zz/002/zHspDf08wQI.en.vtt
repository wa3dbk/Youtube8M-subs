 the detox diet enough the new trendy diet that advocates the 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:08.079
 healthy and natural food 

00:00:08.079 --> 00:00:12.799
 caroline jolivot nutritionist doctor tells us more about this method with 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:15.019
 eight minutes to do it's a curious term 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:18.819
 she prepares a little aggressive to renÃ© and her cars parked on last year 

00:00:18.819 --> 00:00:21.820
 that at the moment in the law the situation especially in the cities 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:22.890
 even though 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.640
 mastery addicted reasons 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.619
 a click inside by the food for all hope a lot 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:30.509
 of chemistry in a food that is not a few light 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:33.179
 can also be explained by the atmosphere that makes a lot of 

00:00:33.179 --> 00:00:36.100
 pollution at the party with heavy metals industry or two 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.950
 it's with dioxin in some places 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.140
 % and the arfa food chemistry is plethora especially in France with the 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.530
 derivatives and phytosanitary products on food 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.519
 % intoxicated it also makes by some drug treatments a fight 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:51.079
 we took for hundreds of years that we took to the agreement 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:54.960
 so the toxins so exist in our body was not so much fun to 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.010
 consider 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.620
 so beta it's going to be remove the toxins that we are aware of so much 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.470
 that a first diagram made aware that we are fed up and we will 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.620
 do things to remove them to do a little cleaning of 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:06.450
 spring 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.880
 the body to its own detoxification system but it happens that the 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:10.590
 organs 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.740
 who intervene in this mechanism like iran the intestines or the 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.370
 lungs so powerful that they are too busy 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:20.990
 the detox diet a rebalancing floods the body eliminate these 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.580
 toxins this new balance helps to return to its weight of form when 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.530
 we have some extra pounds 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.159
 so we will limit the chemistry the exemption not eat quality foods 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:32.410
 biological will mark as happiness 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.960
 if we can eat but sickly we think of vegetables in priority free 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.110
 to dad things too passive a priority the vintage troyes activity 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.990
 not go up too much in starchy foods very digestible cereals so I 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.100
 think more shouting I think more about kinois I think they will see sarrazin 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.990
 I think of things that have a little less of what are called goals 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.230
 a burst is too much in the wheat in the couscous and all that for a little bit 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:54.770
 relieved his bowels 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.140
 I tend to say one of our priorities think omega-3 makes you 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.220
 very well that at the level of digestion at the level of the cardiovascular level 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.700
 certainly cerebral capital to serve as a kolkata of the girls of 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.570
 black add to that the drainage drink of a liter and a half on board in 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:09.319
 the day 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:12.920
 the massage with essential oils performed twice a day and well 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.599
 sure a physical activity to properly eliminate 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:19.829
 net thierry follows this detox method and gives us his experience I am 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:23.139
 persuaded that the body also needs to be fafn and 

00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:26.969
 rid of toxins accumulated by stress 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:28.759
 work place 

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:32.109
 the republican meg that allows the team that I lost anyway 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.189
 from 4 to 3 pounds 

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:37.379
 he is a little late not without promising 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:39.999
 an adult would have carved for him 

00:02:39.999 --> 00:02:43.179
 the one and the same product 

00:02:43.179 --> 00:02:46.449
 it allowed to refine the silhouette and anne-marie does a little more in the 

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:47.249
 middle 

00:02:47.249 --> 00:02:48.639
 finally I'm doing the training 

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:51.429
 and there I feel good as a rule 

00:02:51.429 --> 00:02:53.280
 while many of the diets 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.500
 this is what our specialist thinks every day are not in the process of 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:57.030
 search 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.180
 what is the scheme that to be fashionable this year this year the 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.829
 departure and that its sisters safe the good health the biological 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:06.799
 all natural that means that we will use elements that a 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:08.129
 symbolic international 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:09.250
 white foods 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:10.709
 it means dairy products 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:11.809
 white fish 

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:14.549
 why because they are virgin high since we are in purity we are 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:15.530
 use 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.069
 the zen side to that means 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:22.099
 the emotional side so let's take a step back from gold by taking soybeans putting back a 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:24.379
 early diggers on this pasta price at the bottom 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:27.769
