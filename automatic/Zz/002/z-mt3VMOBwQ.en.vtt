00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
but I have a problem I have the birds

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.160

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
them so I really got to think about

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.029 
them so I really got to think about
putting<00:00:54.629> some<00:00:54.750> kind<00:00:54.840> of<00:00:54.930> net<00:00:55.199> or<00:00:55.739> something

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
I did with my strawberries when I first

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.630 
I did with my strawberries when I first
planted<00:01:49.439> these<00:01:49.560> I<00:01:49.619> had<00:01:49.979> them<00:01:50.100> about<00:01:50.280> a<00:01:50.310> foot

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
planted these I had them about a foot

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.179 
planted these I had them about a foot
apart<00:01:50.790> that's<00:01:51.360> why<00:01:51.659> I<00:01:51.689> planted<00:01:52.079> them<00:01:52.200> but<00:01:52.829> from

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
apart that's why I planted them but from

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.160 
apart that's why I planted them but from
seeing<00:01:53.490> other<00:01:53.729> other<00:01:54.450> people<00:01:54.509> plant<00:01:55.020> the

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
seeing other other people plant the

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.389 
seeing other other people plant the
strawberries<00:01:55.320> and<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:55.860> way<00:01:55.950> they<00:01:56.070> did<00:01:56.280> it

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
strawberries and the way they did it

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.280 
strawberries and the way they did it
they<00:01:56.759> did<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:57.030> square<00:01:57.240> foot<00:01:57.479> method<00:01:57.899> which

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
they did the square foot method which

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.789 
they did the square foot method which
you<00:01:58.439> could<00:01:58.590> put<00:01:58.740> four<00:01:59.700> per<00:02:00.540> square<00:02:00.990> foot<00:02:01.290> so<00:02:01.560> I

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
you could put four per square foot so I

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.789 
you could put four per square foot so I
think<00:02:02.100> next<00:02:02.939> time<00:02:03.210> around<00:02:03.390> or<00:02:03.869> what<00:02:04.560> I'm<00:02:04.649> going

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
think next time around or what I'm going

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.469 
think next time around or what I'm going
to<00:02:04.829> probably<00:02:04.979> do<00:02:05.280> you<00:02:05.850> know<00:02:05.969> in<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.240> fall<00:02:06.450> or

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
to probably do you know in the fall or

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.389 
to probably do you know in the fall or

strawberry plants by a or per square
foot<00:02:15.330> that<00:02:15.810> where<00:02:16.080> they're<00:02:16.319> the<00:02:16.950> more<00:02:17.220> compact

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
foot that where they're the more compact

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.699 
foot that where they're the more compact
and<00:02:18.180> it<00:02:19.140> be<00:02:19.290> let<00:02:19.530> harder<00:02:20.459> for<00:02:20.670> these<00:02:20.790> for<00:02:21.330> the

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
and it be let harder for these for the

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:24.080 
and it be let harder for these for the
birds<00:02:22.709> to<00:02:22.830> come<00:02:23.010> down<00:02:23.220> and<00:02:23.580> just<00:02:23.849> start

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
the strawberries so that's pretty much

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.330 
the strawberries so that's pretty much
it<00:02:27.959> for<00:02:28.050> the<00:02:28.140> strawberries<00:02:28.620> let's<00:02:29.040> go<00:02:29.190> check

spots and these are three blackberry
bushes<00:02:35.190> that<00:02:35.340> I<00:02:35.459> put<00:02:35.760> two<00:02:35.970> here<00:02:36.300> about<00:02:36.540> two

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
bushes that I put two here about two

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.059 
bushes that I put two here about two
years<00:02:37.290> ago<00:02:37.620> and<00:02:38.390> everything<00:02:39.390> is<00:02:39.510> growing

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
years ago and everything is growing

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:43.100 
years ago and everything is growing
beautifully<00:02:41.069> and<00:02:41.580> what<00:02:41.790> I<00:02:41.819> did<00:02:42.060> was<00:02:42.269> early<00:02:42.870> in

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
beautifully and what I did was early in

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.000 
beautifully and what I did was early in
the<00:02:43.830> frost<00:02:44.870> or<00:02:45.870> before<00:02:46.170> the<00:02:46.290> frost<00:02:46.500> was<00:02:46.739> over<00:02:46.980> I

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
the frost or before the frost was over I

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.540 
the frost or before the frost was over I
actually<00:02:47.340> pruned<00:02:47.700> a<00:02:48.000> lot<00:02:48.629> of<00:02:48.750> the<00:02:49.280> this<00:02:50.280> bush

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
actually pruned a lot of the this bush

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.320 
actually pruned a lot of the this bush
down<00:02:50.849> and<00:02:51.209> they<00:02:51.750> actually<00:02:51.959> made<00:02:52.379> it<00:02:52.500> grow<00:02:52.739> even

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
down and they actually made it grow even

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.570 
down and they actually made it grow even
bigger<00:02:54.590> and<00:02:55.590> as<00:02:55.769> you<00:02:55.890> can<00:02:56.040> see<00:02:56.250> these<00:02:56.400> are

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
bigger and as you can see these are

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.699 
bigger and as you can see these are
going<00:02:56.670> to<00:02:56.760> be<00:02:56.970> the<00:02:57.720> actual<00:02:57.900> blackberries

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
going to be the actual blackberries

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.800 
going to be the actual blackberries
they're<00:02:59.280> not<00:02:59.430> ripen<00:02:59.819> yet<00:03:00.120> but<00:03:00.659> they're

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
they're not ripen yet but they're

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.570 
they're not ripen yet but they're
actually<00:03:01.140> they're<00:03:01.739> definitely<00:03:02.010> starting<00:03:02.519> to

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
actually they're definitely starting to

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.850 
actually they're definitely starting to
ripen<00:03:02.849> now<00:03:03.209> and<00:03:03.480> they've<00:03:04.290> gotten<00:03:04.590> they're

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
getting a lot taller and before I had

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.670 
getting a lot taller and before I had
cut<00:03:07.950> these<00:03:08.129> two<00:03:08.849> about<00:03:09.030> here<00:03:09.690> and<00:03:09.840> now<00:03:09.900> they've

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
cut these two about here and now they've

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.199 
cut these two about here and now they've
grown<00:03:10.950> about<00:03:11.459> another<00:03:11.870> 3<00:03:12.870> feet<00:03:13.110> or<00:03:13.260> so

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
grown about another 3 feet or so

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:17.860 
grown about another 3 feet or so
and<00:03:15.489> so<00:03:16.489> I'm<00:03:16.579> going<00:03:16.700> to<00:03:16.730> be<00:03:16.819> getting<00:03:17.060> a<00:03:17.209> lot<00:03:17.569> of

now<00:03:42.469> they're<00:03:42.620> still<00:03:42.889> in<00:03:43.159> their<00:03:44.150> young<00:03:44.989> stage

00:03:45.399 --> 00:03:45.409 
now they're still in their young stage

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:47.679 
now they're still in their young stage
but<00:03:46.250> after<00:03:46.790> a<00:03:46.819> little<00:03:46.970> while<00:03:47.060> I<00:03:47.209> started

00:03:47.679 --> 00:03:47.689 
but after a little while I started

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:50.050 
but after a little while I started
getting<00:03:47.900> more<00:03:48.379> red<00:03:48.680> like<00:03:48.950> that<00:03:48.980> in<00:03:49.430> this<00:03:49.730> and

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
getting more red like that in this and

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.000 
getting more red like that in this and
probably<00:03:51.019> in<00:03:51.109> the<00:03:51.169> next<00:03:51.500> couple<00:03:51.769> of<00:03:51.950> weeks

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
probably in the next couple of weeks

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:53.890 
probably in the next couple of weeks
that<00:03:52.489> will<00:03:52.849> actually<00:03:53.150> really<00:03:53.299> start<00:03:53.599> to<00:03:53.720> ripen

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900
