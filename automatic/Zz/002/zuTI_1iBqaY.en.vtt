place<00:00:13.419> nowadays<00:00:14.309> cell<00:00:15.309> phones<00:00:15.519> were<00:00:15.639> actually

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:16.030 
place nowadays cell phones were actually

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:20.630 
place nowadays cell phones were actually
invented<00:00:16.450> in<00:00:16.619> 1973<00:00:17.619> and<00:00:17.890> much<00:00:18.130> like<00:00:18.160> this

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.700 

today<00:00:21.640> they've<00:00:22.060> changed<00:00:22.330> a<00:00:22.570> lot<00:00:22.750> while<00:00:23.560> in

today they've changed a lot while in
1973<00:00:24.610> cell<00:00:24.940> phones<00:00:25.120> are<00:00:25.270> few<00:00:25.450> and<00:00:25.480> far<00:00:25.600> between

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
1973 cell phones are few and far between

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.470 
1973 cell phones are few and far between
today<00:00:26.890> it<00:00:27.070> seems<00:00:27.280> like<00:00:27.460> everybody<00:00:28.000> has<00:00:28.210> a<00:00:28.240> cell

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:28.480 
today it seems like everybody has a cell

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.590 
today it seems like everybody has a cell
phone<00:00:28.860> so<00:00:29.860> what<00:00:29.980> makes<00:00:30.220> these<00:00:30.520> phones<00:00:30.970> so

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:31.600 
phone so what makes these phones so

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:36.060 
phone so what makes these phones so
different<00:00:31.930> from<00:00:32.050> these<00:00:32.259> bones<00:00:33.629> and<00:00:35.010> how<00:00:36.010> the

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.070 
different from these bones and how the

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:41.430 
different from these bones and how the
heck<00:00:36.460> do<00:00:36.640> they<00:00:36.699> work<00:00:36.969> without<00:00:37.149> the<00:00:37.449> cables<00:00:40.440> huh

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:41.440 
heck do they work without the cables huh

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.579 
heck do they work without the cables huh
well<00:00:42.429> let's<00:00:42.820> go<00:00:42.999> figure<00:00:43.239> it<00:00:43.420> out<00:00:43.589> hopefully

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:44.589 
well let's go figure it out hopefully

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:47.250 
well let's go figure it out hopefully
it's<00:00:44.710> not<00:00:44.800> too<00:00:45.010> complicated<00:00:45.399> but<00:00:46.149> that's<00:00:47.019> okay

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.260 
it's not too complicated but that's okay

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.309 
it's not too complicated but that's okay
if<00:00:47.409> it<00:00:47.530> is<00:00:47.649> cuz<00:00:47.949> I<00:00:48.069> think<00:00:48.370> you're<00:00:48.489> pretty<00:00:48.609> smart

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:49.319 
if it is cuz I think you're pretty smart

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:57.809 
if it is cuz I think you're pretty smart
except<00:00:50.319> maybe<00:00:50.440> you<00:00:51.629> just<00:00:52.629> kidding<00:00:56.819> okay

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:57.819 
except maybe you just kidding okay

00:00:57.819 --> 00:01:00.270 
except maybe you just kidding okay
wasting<00:00:58.780> time<00:00:58.809> let's<00:00:59.649> go<00:00:59.800> figure<00:01:00.039> out<00:01:00.129> how

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
wasting time let's go figure out how

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.099 
wasting time let's go figure out how
this<00:01:00.399> tiny<00:01:00.760> little<00:01:00.969> gadget<00:01:01.510> lets<00:01:01.690> you<00:01:01.780> talk<00:01:01.989> to

00:01:02.099 --> 00:01:02.109 
this tiny little gadget lets you talk to

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:09.760 
this tiny little gadget lets you talk to
people<00:01:02.170> all<00:01:02.530> over<00:01:02.589> the<00:01:03.039> world

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.569 

nothing<00:01:10.369> from<00:01:10.490> this<00:01:10.729> angle<00:01:11.920> SuperBass<00:01:12.920> focus

00:01:13.569 --> 00:01:13.579 
nothing from this angle SuperBass focus

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:20.440 
nothing from this angle SuperBass focus
one<00:01:13.789> will

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:39.180 

I<00:01:28.960> don't<00:01:29.960> feel<00:01:30.229> so<00:01:30.469> good

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.190 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.710

well<00:02:03.530> I<00:02:03.860> think<00:02:04.220> I<00:02:04.310> figured<00:02:04.640> it<00:02:04.700> out<00:02:07.450> first<00:02:08.450> in

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:08.930 
well I think I figured it out first in

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:13.720 
well I think I figured it out first in
person<00:02:11.260> talking<00:02:12.260> on<00:02:12.680> their<00:02:12.860> cell<00:02:12.920> phone<00:02:13.430> and

person talking on their cell phone and
that<00:02:14.570> goes<00:02:16.390> to<00:02:17.390> this<00:02:17.540> tower<00:02:18.610> but<00:02:19.610> then<00:02:19.820> sends

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:20.210 
that goes to this tower but then sends

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:24.700 
that goes to this tower but then sends
it<00:02:20.270> to<00:02:20.420> the<00:02:20.480> other<00:02:20.690> person<00:02:22.930> also<00:02:23.930> on<00:02:24.290> the<00:02:24.500> cell

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:24.710 
it to the other person also on the cell

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:29.380 
it to the other person also on the cell
phone<00:02:26.950> well<00:02:27.950> I'll<00:02:28.760> give<00:02:29.030> you<00:02:29.150> a<00:02:29.240> better

phone is sent to a cell phone tower
these<00:02:37.370> towers<00:02:37.850> are<00:02:38.090> usually<00:02:38.420> paired<00:02:38.630> up<00:02:38.810> with

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
these towers are usually paired up with

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.380 
these towers are usually paired up with
different<00:02:39.140> areas<00:02:39.620> of<00:02:39.650> a<00:02:39.950> city<00:02:40.160> or<00:02:40.400> town<00:02:40.700> these

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:42.640 
different areas of a city or town these
are<00:02:41.540> called<00:02:41.780> cells<00:02:42.110> and<00:02:42.410> they're<00:02:42.500> usually

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
are called cells and they're usually

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.130 
are called cells and they're usually
about<00:02:42.980> 10<00:02:43.340> square<00:02:43.760> miles<00:02:44.030> they<00:02:44.930> look<00:02:45.110> like

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
about 10 square miles they look like

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.900 
about 10 square miles they look like
this<00:02:47.620> when<00:02:48.620> a<00:02:48.680> tower<00:02:48.920> gets<00:02:49.190> a<00:02:49.280> signal<00:02:49.490> from<00:02:49.820> a

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
this when a tower gets a signal from a

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.730 
this when a tower gets a signal from a
cell<00:02:50.120> phone<00:02:50.360> the<00:02:50.840> signals<00:02:51.200> tell<00:02:51.410> the<00:02:51.560> tower

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:51.740 
cell phone the signals tell the tower

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.310 
cell phone the signals tell the tower
which<00:02:52.280> phone<00:02:52.640> is<00:02:52.670> trying<00:02:53.150> to<00:02:53.240> contact<00:02:53.660> the
