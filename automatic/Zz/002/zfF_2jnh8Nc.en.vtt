00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.280 
I do like this blue as I said and the
other<00:01:06.180> one<00:01:06.360> very<00:01:06.570> fashionable<00:01:07.110> with<00:01:07.229> the

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
other one very fashionable with the

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
cobalt blue and sky blue looks really

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.410 
cobalt blue and sky blue looks really
good<00:01:09.810> so<00:01:10.189> basically<00:01:11.189> this<00:01:11.400> is<00:01:11.610> grade<00:01:11.880> one<00:01:12.119> plus

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
good so basically this is grade one plus

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.120 
good so basically this is grade one plus
English<00:01:12.810> whether<00:01:13.049> it's<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.350> same<00:01:13.590> grade<00:01:13.920> as<00:01:13.950> a

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
English whether it's the same grade as a

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.820 
English whether it's the same grade as a
short<00:01:14.430> hand<00:01:14.490> or<00:01:14.909> just<00:01:15.119> in<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.110> shorter<00:01:16.590> a

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
short hand or just in the shorter a

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.399 
short hand or just in the shorter a
small<00:01:17.189> men's<00:01:17.430> size<00:01:17.759> which<00:01:18.540> you'd<00:01:18.720> see<00:01:18.960> denoted

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
small men's size which you'd see denoted

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.740 
small men's size which you'd see denoted
on<00:01:19.680> top<00:01:19.890> of<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.040> hand<00:01:20.250> alone<00:01:20.430> SM<00:01:21.000> was

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
on top of the hand alone SM was

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.280 
on top of the hand alone SM was
obviously<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.170> short<00:01:22.470> handle<00:01:22.920> you<00:01:23.250> get<00:01:23.460> SH

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
obviously the short handle you get SH

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.030 
obviously the short handle you get SH
but<00:01:25.290> let's<00:01:25.470> just<00:01:25.560> do<00:01:25.710> a<00:01:25.740> quick<00:01:25.920> comparison

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
but let's just do a quick comparison

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.700 
but let's just do a quick comparison
shop<00:01:26.729> now<00:01:26.880> so<00:01:26.939> you<00:01:27.119> can<00:01:27.270> see<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:28.380> exact

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
shop now so you can see the exact

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.030 
shop now so you can see the exact
differences<00:01:29.280> in<00:01:29.400> size<00:01:30.140> so<00:01:31.140> there's<00:01:31.770> really

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
differences in size so there's really

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.249 
differences in size so there's really
not<00:01:32.400> that<00:01:32.460> much<00:01:32.790> in<00:01:33.060> it<00:01:33.180> if<00:01:33.570> you<00:01:33.630> can<00:01:33.780> look<00:01:34.049> that

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
not that much in it if you can look that

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.929 
not that much in it if you can look that
obviously<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:34.950> blade<00:01:35.189> is<00:01:35.430> just<00:01:35.790> very

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
obviously the blade is just very

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.260 
obviously the blade is just very
slightly<00:01:36.659> shorter<00:01:37.579> and<00:01:38.579> of<00:01:38.729> course<00:01:38.970> at<00:01:39.210> the

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
slightly shorter and of course at the

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.490 
slightly shorter and of course at the
top<00:01:39.450> of<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.630> handle<00:01:39.960> you<00:01:40.049> can<00:01:40.200> see<00:01:40.350> they're

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
top of the handle you can see they're

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.980 
top of the handle you can see they're
not<00:01:40.619> quite<00:01:40.860> level<00:01:41.070> either<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:41.759> so<00:01:42.540> basically

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
not quite level either and so basically

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.670 
not quite level either and so basically
a<00:01:43.409> small<00:01:44.009> men's<00:01:44.399> is<00:01:44.880> if<00:01:45.750> you're<00:01:46.290> a<00:01:46.320> junior

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
a small men's is if you're a junior

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.039 
a small men's is if you're a junior
player<00:01:47.100> like<00:01:47.670> that's<00:01:48.329> been<00:01:48.479> using<00:01:48.630> a<00:01:48.750> Harrow

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
player like that's been using a Harrow

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.170 
player like that's been using a Harrow
but<00:01:49.380> don't<00:01:49.590> think<00:01:49.950> you're<00:01:50.130> quite<00:01:50.399> tall<00:01:50.850> or

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
but don't think you're quite tall or

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.969 
but don't think you're quite tall or
strong<00:01:51.540> enough<00:01:51.570> to<00:01:52.049> be<00:01:52.170> jumping<00:01:52.710> up<00:01:52.829> the

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
strong enough to be jumping up the

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.039 
strong enough to be jumping up the
straightaway<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.820> short<00:01:54.060> handle<00:01:54.479> then

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
straightaway to the short handle then

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.560 
straightaway to the short handle then
this<00:01:55.200> is<00:01:55.320> a<00:01:55.350> great<00:01:55.500> option<00:01:56.040> as<00:01:56.250> is<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.790> new<00:01:56.939> b7

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
this is a great option as is the new b7

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:58.850 
this is a great option as is the new b7
which<00:01:57.719> I've<00:01:57.869> mentioned<00:01:58.020> or<00:01:58.350> just<00:01:58.500> to<00:01:58.560> prove<00:01:58.799> to

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
which I've mentioned or just to prove to

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.620 
which I've mentioned or just to prove to
you<00:01:59.070> here<00:01:59.340> it's<00:01:59.700> actually<00:01:59.820> exactly<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.450> same

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
you here it's actually exactly the same

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.280 
you here it's actually exactly the same
size<00:02:01.250> but<00:02:02.250> I<00:02:02.280> think<00:02:02.640> because<00:02:03.240> smart<00:02:03.719> Spartan

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
size but I think because smart Spartan

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.109 
size but I think because smart Spartan
have<00:02:04.409> actually<00:02:04.680> called<00:02:04.950> a<00:02:05.100> small<00:02:05.490> men's<00:02:05.759> bear

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
have actually called a small men's bear

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.270 
have actually called a small men's bear
it's<00:02:06.780> really<00:02:07.259> a<00:02:07.290> bit<00:02:07.469> more<00:02:07.649> appropriate<00:02:08.009> for

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
it's really a bit more appropriate for

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.290 
it's really a bit more appropriate for
the<00:02:08.520> shorter<00:02:08.910> adult<00:02:09.270> player

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
the shorter adult player

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.810 
the shorter adult player
who<00:02:10.780> is<00:02:10.960> about<00:02:11.260> five<00:02:11.680> foot<00:02:11.950> six<00:02:12.220> five<00:02:12.610> foot

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:12.820 
who is about five foot six five foot

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.080 
who is about five foot six five foot
seven<00:02:13.090> maybe<00:02:13.480> five<00:02:13.810> four<00:02:14.020> eight<00:02:14.170> maximum<00:02:15.090> and

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
seven maybe five four eight maximum and

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.330 
seven maybe five four eight maximum and
a<00:02:16.210> short-handled<00:02:16.870> isn't<00:02:17.290> quite<00:02:17.680> doesn't<00:02:18.160> feel

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
a short-handled isn't quite doesn't feel

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.880 
a short-handled isn't quite doesn't feel
quite<00:02:18.610> right<00:02:19.150> for<00:02:19.210> you<00:02:19.570> maybe<00:02:20.350> a<00:02:20.500> little<00:02:20.680> bit

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
quite right for you maybe a little bit

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.680 
quite right for you maybe a little bit
too<00:02:21.100> long<00:02:21.340> effective<00:02:21.910> technique<00:02:22.330> maybe<00:02:22.540> that

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
too long effective technique maybe that

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.080 
too long effective technique maybe that
handles<00:02:23.170> getting<00:02:23.770> in<00:02:23.860> the<00:02:23.950> way<00:02:24.100> a<00:02:24.130> bit<00:02:24.460> and<00:02:24.670> you

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
handles getting in the way a bit and you

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.449 
handles getting in the way a bit and you
know<00:02:25.210> those<00:02:25.570> kind<00:02:25.870> of<00:02:25.960> considerations<00:02:26.709> if<00:02:27.280> you

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
know those kind of considerations if you

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:29.370 
know those kind of considerations if you
want<00:02:27.640> to<00:02:27.700> play<00:02:27.910> more<00:02:28.390> technically<00:02:28.840> solidly

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
want to play more technically solidly

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.290 
want to play more technically solidly
through<00:02:29.590> the<00:02:29.680> V<00:02:29.860> is<00:02:30.400> a<00:02:30.459> little<00:02:30.850> bit<00:02:30.970> easier<00:02:31.240> the

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
through the V is a little bit easier the

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.420 
through the V is a little bit easier the
slight<00:02:31.540> short<00:02:31.810> handle<00:02:32.230> and<00:02:32.410> a<00:02:32.500> blade<00:02:33.130> that's

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
slight short handle and a blade that's

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.699 
slight short handle and a blade that's
more<00:02:33.640> in<00:02:33.730> keeping<00:02:33.940> with<00:02:34.209> your<00:02:34.360> height<00:02:34.709> so

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
more in keeping with your height so

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:37.890 
more in keeping with your height so
definitely<00:02:36.070> bear<00:02:36.250> that<00:02:36.459> in<00:02:36.580> mind<00:02:36.660> the<00:02:37.660> weight

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
definitely bear that in mind the weight

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.199 
definitely bear that in mind the weight
of<00:02:38.620> these<00:02:38.800> small<00:02:39.190> mens<00:02:39.400> bats<00:02:39.700> we<00:02:39.850> have<00:02:39.970> another

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
of these small mens bats we have another

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:42.630 
of these small mens bats we have another
one<00:02:40.420> that's<00:02:40.510> two<00:02:40.750> pound<00:02:41.050> five<00:02:41.350> this<00:02:42.250> one<00:02:42.550> I

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
one that's two pound five this one I

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.280 
one that's two pound five this one I
believe<00:02:42.730> is<00:02:43.150> the<00:02:43.330> same<00:02:43.360> way<00:02:43.870> it<00:02:44.020> will<00:02:44.140> just

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
believe is the same way it will just

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.460 
believe is the same way it will just
confirm<00:02:45.010> that<00:02:45.040> for<00:02:45.370> you<00:02:45.459> here<00:02:46.320> there<00:02:47.320> you<00:02:47.380> go

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
confirm that for you here there you go

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.250 
confirm that for you here there you go
two<00:02:47.739> pound<00:02:48.040> five<00:02:48.370> point<00:02:48.730> six<00:02:49.060> so<00:02:49.870> it's<00:02:50.020> very

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
two pound five point six so it's very

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.170 
two pound five point six so it's very
nice<00:02:50.470> light<00:02:50.860> weight<00:02:50.890> and<00:02:51.760> that's<00:02:51.940> another

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
nice light weight and that's another

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.340 
nice light weight and that's another
thing<00:02:52.390> to<00:02:52.540> think<00:02:52.570> about<00:02:52.810> especially<00:02:53.080> if

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
thing to think about especially if

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.110 
thing to think about especially if
you're<00:02:53.530> a<00:02:53.800> junior<00:02:54.070> player<00:02:54.340> like<00:02:54.790> I<00:02:54.820> said

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
you're a junior player like I said

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.180 
you're a junior player like I said
looking<00:02:55.480> to<00:02:55.660> make<00:02:55.780> this<00:02:55.870> step<00:02:56.140> up<00:02:56.350> you<00:02:56.950> don't

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
looking to make this step up you don't

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:58.710 
looking to make this step up you don't
want<00:02:57.370> that<00:02:57.550> weight<00:02:57.790> difference<00:02:58.300> to<00:02:58.420> be<00:02:58.510> so

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
want that weight difference to be so

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.540 
want that weight difference to be so
extreme<00:02:58.959> from<00:02:59.410> Harrow<00:02:59.650> to<00:02:59.860> short<00:03:00.100> handles

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
extreme from Harrow to short handles

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.160 
extreme from Harrow to short handles
sometimes<00:03:01.030> that<00:03:01.239> can<00:03:01.360> be<00:03:01.480> a<00:03:01.510> good<00:03:01.750> four<00:03:02.080> or

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
sometimes that can be a good four or

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.710 
sometimes that can be a good four or
five<00:03:02.380> ounces<00:03:02.650> difference<00:03:03.510> between<00:03:04.510> those<00:03:04.660> two

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
five ounces difference between those two

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.229 
five ounces difference between those two
sizes<00:03:05.380> or<00:03:05.470> even<00:03:05.680> more<00:03:05.860> and<00:03:06.250> in<00:03:06.790> this<00:03:06.970> case

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
sizes or even more and in this case

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:09.030 
sizes or even more and in this case
you're<00:03:07.600> not<00:03:07.630> really<00:03:07.900> getting<00:03:08.080> any<00:03:08.290> weight

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
you're not really getting any weight

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.310 
you're not really getting any weight
difference<00:03:09.550> because<00:03:09.850> to<00:03:10.120> power<00:03:10.300> five<00:03:10.570> is<00:03:10.840> the

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
difference because to power five is the

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.310 
difference because to power five is the
same<00:03:11.890> weight<00:03:12.130> a<00:03:12.160> lot<00:03:12.670> of<00:03:12.820> Harrow<00:03:13.060> bats<00:03:13.390> so<00:03:13.870> keep

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
same weight a lot of Harrow bats so keep

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.650 
same weight a lot of Harrow bats so keep
that<00:03:14.470> in<00:03:14.680> mind<00:03:14.769> for<00:03:15.459> a<00:03:15.489> two<00:03:15.640> pound<00:03:15.880> five<00:03:16.209> but<00:03:16.480> it

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
that in mind for a two pound five but it

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.650 
that in mind for a two pound five but it
is<00:03:16.780> very<00:03:17.110> very<00:03:17.260> big<00:03:17.709> this<00:03:17.920> one<00:03:18.160> I<00:03:18.190> must<00:03:18.370> say

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
is very very big this one I must say

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.300 
is very very big this one I must say
you're<00:03:19.660> looking<00:03:19.690> at<00:03:19.930> edges<00:03:20.230> of<00:03:20.380> about<00:03:20.560> 35

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
you're looking at edges of about 35

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.710 
you're looking at edges of about 35
maybe<00:03:21.940> 36<00:03:22.330> Mills<00:03:23.580> spine<00:03:24.580> I<00:03:25.090> didn't<00:03:25.510> know<00:03:25.570> was

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
maybe 36 Mills spine I didn't know was

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.940 
maybe 36 Mills spine I didn't know was
there<00:03:25.810> about<00:03:26.080> 58<00:03:26.590> 59<00:03:27.330> so<00:03:28.330> yeah<00:03:28.540> it's<00:03:28.720> it's<00:03:29.110> big

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
there about 58 59 so yeah it's it's big

a to poppy you look at the shape you see
damn<00:03:35.739> much<00:03:36.070> like<00:03:36.430> on<00:03:36.640> the<00:03:36.700> short<00:03:36.970> hand<00:03:37.180> version

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
like with a short handle you get that

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.770 
like with a short handle you get that
duckbill<00:03:47.829> toe<00:03:48.190> with<00:03:48.940> the<00:03:49.000> spine<00:03:49.329> sort<00:03:49.720> of

through<00:03:51.430> through<00:03:52.269> the<00:03:52.420> toe<00:03:52.660> it<00:03:53.410> is<00:03:53.560> the<00:03:53.709> same

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
through through the toe it is the same

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.340 
through through the toe it is the same
shape<00:03:54.310> of<00:03:54.340> course<00:03:54.700> as<00:03:55.060> the<00:03:55.329> short<00:03:55.840> handle<00:03:56.200> and

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:56.350 
shape of course as the short handle and

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:59.069 
shape of course as the short handle and
also<00:03:56.500> as<00:03:56.890> Michael<00:03:57.489> Clark<00:03:57.760> spa<00:03:58.090> he<00:03:58.660> likes<00:03:58.840> this

00:03:59.069 --> 00:03:59.079 
also as Michael Clark spa he likes this

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:01.979 
also as Michael Clark spa he likes this
mid<00:03:59.410> to<00:03:59.620> low<00:03:59.769> middle<00:04:00.239> exactly<00:04:01.239> this<00:04:01.390> shape<00:04:01.750> and

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:01.989 
mid to low middle exactly this shape and

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:05.130 
mid to low middle exactly this shape and
it's<00:04:02.769> great<00:04:03.100> for<00:04:03.280> front<00:04:03.579> foot<00:04:03.790> players<00:04:04.060> or<00:04:04.930> use

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
it's great for front foot players or use

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:06.630 
it's great for front foot players or use
some<00:04:05.290> slow<00:04:05.590> and<00:04:05.739> low<00:04:05.829> pitches<00:04:06.100> so<00:04:06.400> you<00:04:06.519> don't

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
some slow and low pitches so you don't

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:07.830 
some slow and low pitches so you don't
you<00:04:06.700> get<00:04:06.820> here<00:04:07.060> in<00:04:07.120> England<00:04:07.420> with<00:04:07.540> that<00:04:07.660> middle

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
you get here in England with that middle

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.380 
you get here in England with that middle
being<00:04:08.110> quite<00:04:08.320> low<00:04:08.590> but<00:04:09.489> it<00:04:09.579> picks<00:04:09.850> up<00:04:10.090> really

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
being quite low but it picks up really

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:11.850 
being quite low but it picks up really
nice<00:04:10.510> and<00:04:10.750> balanced<00:04:11.170> as<00:04:11.440> well<00:04:11.470> like<00:04:11.829> a

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:11.860 
nice and balanced as well like a

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.830 
nice and balanced as well like a
certainly<00:04:12.280> short<00:04:12.549> handle<00:04:12.880> video<00:04:13.209> and<00:04:13.660> this

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
certainly short handle video and this

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.509 
certainly short handle video and this
bat<00:04:14.110> obviously<00:04:14.680> it's<00:04:14.799> gonna<00:04:14.920> feel<00:04:15.100> incredibly

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:15.519 
bat obviously it's gonna feel incredibly

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:18.420 
bat obviously it's gonna feel incredibly
light<00:04:15.760> to<00:04:16.299> pound<00:04:16.570> five<00:04:16.870> and<00:04:17.320> the<00:04:17.859> balance<00:04:18.310> is

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
light to pound five and the balance is

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.910 
light to pound five and the balance is
the<00:04:18.580> key

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:18.920 
the key

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.190 
the key
really<00:04:19.460> really<00:04:19.790> nicely<00:04:20.060> balanced<00:04:20.720> and<00:04:21.110> you

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.200 
really really nicely balanced and you

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
really really nicely balanced and you
know<00:04:21.260> it<00:04:21.350> certainly<00:04:21.530> doesn't<00:04:21.800> feel<00:04:22.070> them<00:04:22.190> you

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220 
know it certainly doesn't feel them you

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.300 
know it certainly doesn't feel them you
any<00:04:22.580> heavier<00:04:22.940> than<00:04:23.060> it<00:04:23.240> feels<00:04:23.450> me<00:04:24.130> hard<00:04:25.130> at

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
any heavier than it feels me hard at

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:27.100 
any heavier than it feels me hard at
this<00:04:25.430> weight<00:04:25.700> but<00:04:25.940> yeah<00:04:26.120> certainly<00:04:26.720> feels

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
this weight but yeah certainly feels

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.940 
this weight but yeah certainly feels
lighter<00:04:27.470> than<00:04:27.710> to<00:04:27.920> five<00:04:28.220> for<00:04:28.550> me<00:04:28.700> and<00:04:29.710> the<00:04:30.710> bow

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:30.950 
lighter than to five for me and the bow

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:32.950 
lighter than to five for me and the bow
haven't<00:04:31.460> shown<00:04:31.670> you<00:04:31.820> yet<00:04:31.850> like<00:04:32.420> with<00:04:32.750> the

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
haven't shown you yet like with the

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.170 
haven't shown you yet like with the
short<00:04:33.860> handle<00:04:34.280> one<00:04:34.460> there's<00:04:34.640> a<00:04:34.700> fairly

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
short handle one there's a fairly

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:36.880 
short handle one there's a fairly
significant<00:04:35.930> even<00:04:36.140> bow<00:04:36.440> there<00:04:36.740> that

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:36.890 
significant even bow there that

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:39.010 
significant even bow there that
certainly<00:04:37.130> helps<00:04:37.550> that<00:04:37.700> pick<00:04:37.910> up<00:04:38.120> and<00:04:38.600> helps

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
certainly helps that pick up and helps

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:40.570 
certainly helps that pick up and helps
you<00:04:39.110> play<00:04:39.320> over<00:04:39.470> the<00:04:39.590> top<00:04:39.860> and<00:04:40.070> clear<00:04:40.460> the

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
you play over the top and clear the

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:41.500 
you play over the top and clear the
infield<00:04:40.940> as<00:04:41.060> well

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:41.510 
infield as well

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:44.020 
infield as well
one<00:04:42.080> quirk<00:04:42.470> I<00:04:42.800> will<00:04:43.100> mention<00:04:43.460> about<00:04:43.850> these

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.030 
one quirk I will mention about these

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:45.520 
one quirk I will mention about these
small<00:04:44.600> men's<00:04:44.870> is<00:04:45.080> they've<00:04:45.230> got<00:04:45.350> a<00:04:45.380> different

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 
small men's is they've got a different

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:48.340 
small men's is they've got a different
grip<00:04:46.040> to<00:04:46.790> the<00:04:46.820> short<00:04:47.570> hand<00:04:47.810> I<00:04:47.930> don't<00:04:48.140> know<00:04:48.260> if

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.350 
grip to the short hand I don't know if

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:51.490 
grip to the short hand I don't know if
this<00:04:48.500> is<00:04:48.620> true<00:04:48.800> across<00:04:49.100> the<00:04:49.220> board<00:04:49.960> but<00:04:50.960> I<00:04:51.050> find

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
this is true across the board but I find

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:52.600 
this is true across the board but I find
this<00:04:51.590> a<00:04:51.650> little<00:04:51.770> bit<00:04:51.920> stranger<00:04:52.250> but<00:04:52.370> she<00:04:52.430> got

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
this a little bit stranger but she got

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:54.730 
this a little bit stranger but she got
there<00:04:52.760> at<00:04:52.820> the<00:04:52.940> same<00:04:53.120> color<00:04:53.390> scheme<00:04:53.720> but<00:04:54.650> this

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
there at the same color scheme but this

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.800 
there at the same color scheme but this
is<00:04:54.860> a<00:04:54.890> Chevron<00:04:55.460> grip<00:04:55.700> all<00:04:55.940> the<00:04:56.120> way<00:04:56.240> up<00:04:56.450> rather

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:56.810 
is a Chevron grip all the way up rather

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:58.840 
is a Chevron grip all the way up rather
than<00:04:56.930> this<00:04:57.140> multi<00:04:57.710> grip<00:04:57.950> which<00:04:58.130> has<00:04:58.340> the<00:04:58.520> snake

00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:58.850 
than this multi grip which has the snake

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:02.200 
than this multi grip which has the snake
and<00:04:59.390> the<00:04:59.540> octopus<00:04:59.990> there<00:05:00.320> so<00:05:01.280> yeah<00:05:01.670> that<00:05:01.880> seems

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:02.210 
and the octopus there so yeah that seems

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:03.460 
and the octopus there so yeah that seems
to<00:05:02.300> be<00:05:02.420> a<00:05:02.450> little<00:05:02.600> bit<00:05:02.750> stressed<00:05:03.050> only<00:05:03.290> helps

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:03.470 
to be a little bit stressed only helps

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:04.750 
to be a little bit stressed only helps
to<00:05:03.530> keep<00:05:03.620> the<00:05:03.740> weight<00:05:03.890> down<00:05:03.950> a<00:05:04.190> bit<00:05:04.430> of<00:05:04.520> course

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:04.760 
to keep the weight down a bit of course

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.550 
to keep the weight down a bit of course
because<00:05:04.970> he<00:05:05.060> Chevron's<00:05:05.510> a<00:05:05.660> bit<00:05:05.780> lighter<00:05:06.020> maybe

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:06.560 
because he Chevron's a bit lighter maybe
