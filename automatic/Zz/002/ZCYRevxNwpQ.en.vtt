markers for the Pokedex application so
what<00:00:12.210> I<00:00:12.240> did<00:00:12.719> was<00:00:13.880> I<00:00:14.880> scanned<00:00:15.870> it<00:00:17.869> at<00:00:18.869> the

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
what I did was I scanned it at the

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.550 
what I did was I scanned it at the
Pokedex<00:00:19.590> app<00:00:20.029> the<00:00:21.029> iar<00:00:21.500> markers<00:00:22.500> I<00:00:23.279> scanned

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:24.560 
Pokedex app the iar markers I scanned

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.519 
Pokedex app the iar markers I scanned
Phyllis<00:00:25.560> female<00:00:26.099> form

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:27.529 
Phyllis female form

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:33.440 
Phyllis female form
Jellison<00:00:28.550> female<00:00:29.550> form<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:30.199> Joel<00:00:31.199> tick<00:00:32.450> and

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
Jellison female form and Joel tick and

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.540 
Jellison female form and Joel tick and
once<00:00:34.200> you<00:00:34.380> scan<00:00:34.649> it<00:00:34.860> it<00:00:35.040> increases<00:00:35.309> your

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
once you scan it it increases your

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.690 
once you scan it it increases your
chances<00:00:36.059> of<00:00:36.120> getting<00:00:36.390> it<00:00:36.750> on<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:39.320> Pokedex

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:40.700 
chances of getting it on the Pokedex

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:50.270 
chances of getting it on the Pokedex
so<00:00:42.860> I<00:00:44.180> did<00:00:45.180> it<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:47.960> I<00:00:48.960> skipped<00:00:49.920> a<00:00:50.010> day<00:00:50.160> ahead
