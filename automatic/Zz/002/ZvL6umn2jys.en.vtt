00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:19.330 
working spritz and why I like using this
instead<00:04:17.870> of<00:04:17.930> gel<00:04:18.200> that's<00:04:18.410> because<00:04:18.829> it<00:04:19.160> does

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
instead of gel that's because it does

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:21.610 
instead of gel that's because it does
get<00:04:19.789> slightly<00:04:20.060> harder<00:04:20.630> so<00:04:20.930> it<00:04:21.109> helps<00:04:21.409> my

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
get slightly harder so it helps my

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:26.529 
get slightly harder so it helps my
