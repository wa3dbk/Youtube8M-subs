00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 Welcome to existing 

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:06.180
 with the greens they have none 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.090
 be prepared or are now a few 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.019
 to ask questions you know we are yes 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.759
 at the gamescom we are at 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.540
 team-event yes you can sometimes look like 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.370
 that looks like this 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.410
 that looks very nice with the roccat 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.500
 to choose the reason i love the whole 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:23.279
 honest i want to marry you but all 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.580
 of them and martin gamescom 2005 are 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.619
 what you two days your highlights here 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:32.759
 I did not see him, so to speak 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.710
 have - gambled was quite cool you can 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.390
 can buy but so on the big 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.950
 We did not do much more 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.390
 more so press things expired and yes 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.219
 little sense results center gave now 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.270
 some changes what do you mean yes 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:51.120
 a cool hesse league gwa www.ne na.de 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.250
 yes yes we all know what innovations 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.379
 which we now learn from those aids 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.789
 you think you are going to be great 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.190
 play role in the online reader of 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.469
 so you definitely that one now 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.789
 no longer permanently counter each book 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.260
 So you can still do every move 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:08.400
 counter but you have only a limited 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:10.110
 number of possible counter and that is 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.950
 I think very very good thing 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.630
 otherwise for us 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.039
 maybe there is still some here 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.509
 More information about how to 

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:20.939
 important we do not get here 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.799
 At the very most, there are more people 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.420
 for the rossa but he is not allowed 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:28.259
 raushauen from therefore you want to do 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.820
 If you want 120 people, that's it 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.610
 actually almost all of the currently 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.899
 in the wwe is that she really is the one 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.689
 focus on the current wants, at least 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:38.310
 link and not because they are not 80 80 80 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.990
 Slap on legend, yes, you can too 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.030
 but they have to somehow 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.560
 These scans can arrive from therefore 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.759
 they also have for years we 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.619
 For years also already built or 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.869
 even they can be on the mat too 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.979
 scans rely therefore would be the 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.670
 Of course, a possibility 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:02:00.929
 You have to see Germany otherwise 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:02.429
 channel water came and so www.news and us 

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:04.890
 have been here a year ago too 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:07.289
 times gathered building I gathered 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.390
 Both would have gathered on the 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:11.849
 gamescom and there's a lot happening in 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.709
 a time as youtube what do you mean what 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:15.030

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:16.799
 and what the possibility now as 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.019
 youtube within twelve months 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:21.569
 have ever been given was pretty cool so good 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:23.010
 the biggest highlight today was me 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.989
 was allowed to interview the Rhine, the 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.750
 really the madness video gives up 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:29.190
 a channel other so well so the 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.900
 was just awesome crud and stop 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.970

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.769
 the whole car boom the hero with us 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:38.040

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:39.930
 yes this stone the ball rolling came the 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.370
 It's really awesome to see it like that 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.440
 stop more and more and more and always 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.650
 more, more and more people come ran the 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.269

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.840

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:53.549
 beautiful place the optics can then 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.500
 out you mean you will still be the same 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:57.030
 video strategy driving with www news and 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.859
 extra videos or think or have 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:02.370
 you already plan how we stay 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:04.260
 content will expand so the news the 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.970
 will of course stay very clear and 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.590
 I have now also after I have one 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.970
 I did not do anything for a while 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.130
 also the saturdays videos again 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.349
 introduced where I always new 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.700
 Things have started now, too 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:16.829
 to put manchester online 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.630
 that he will be a next part 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:19.760
 if I have already 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:22.430
 then of course I want you too 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.840
 show and yes just the development 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.090
 to that effect may be whole 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:30.950
 interesting how to become a wrestler or 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:33.320
 the way to wrestling you are yourself 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.420
 Wrestler with meanwhile you have that 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:37.880
 gimmick and in principle his 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.260
 youtube channel of the walkway was something 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:43.220
 would have been pretty stupid too 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:45.050
 klick klick klick is so normal so 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.940
 would you people what I also quite 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:49.430
 to give young spectators on the way 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:50.660
 if you say yes I am wrestling 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.190
 actually like to make a curve yourself 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.050
 Cheap rates you should go home 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.150
 Try the button or she said 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:57.740
 be really worth the walk in the 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.210
 Wrestling school or get her there 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:03.410
 in principle only what you have learned 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:05.510
 the autopresse so this home 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:07.670
 even make the first leads so 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:09.980
 Anyone who believes he can can yes 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.270
 just record what he is doing 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:15.920
 I used to do it like that earlier 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:17.270
 Apart from that, shit if you really 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.570
 the rest in school or a wrestling 

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:22.640
 club goes if one just really 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:25.130
 right and no matter how you believe 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:27.380
 that you can do it right you can do it 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:29.360
 not right if you are not in one 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.700
 club and a rest school that right 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.770
 therefore has always learned from there 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.570
 try it out for the people 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.580
 just flirt with it 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:39.800
 that merz enough to train and unite in 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.480
 Germany since the since such a 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.460
 just offer training sessions 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:45.100
 go forth 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:47.350
 ask how that works and then see if 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:49.300
 one is talented in that regard 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:51.699
 Frequent question you will get how 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.720
 I also like that as a baby in youtube martin 

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:54.789
 guerrero 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:58.389
 who is your favorite wrestler my 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:05:00.699
 favorite rösler is therefore also the 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:02.830
 Otherwise you will get name for frequent 

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:04.449
 ask that you constantly read and the 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:07.449
 now answer for all times 

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:10.060
 certainly as far as where you can not 

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:12.009
 see or when will the www news or 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:14.110
 there is something for that and actually 

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:15.550
 there is that it so when the news comes 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.880
 it's always monday thursday 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:20.680
 should be clear to everyone 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:23.440
 Otherwise you know how are you ? One is 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:29.650
 very common question the gema like me 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:31.060
 it always goes well always yes yes and how to 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:33.190
 So in this rest of history 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:35.080
 come in so many have what you have now 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:36.729
 already said many questions high-tech 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:40.240
 I also want to get rösler how does it work 

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:41.680
 and yes that is common and so is 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:44.349
 just a school and in mößling 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:46.300
 are developed and above 

00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:48.490
 which questions are frequently asked 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:50.050
 Do you get a question that you already have 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:52.120
 always wanted to get asked 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.470
 but somehow wanted to get it is 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:57.659
 did not get asked and was 

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:57.659
 on what you have a perfect answer 

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:02.980
 because now comes in Canada or too bad 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:04.360
 well he does not remember anything 

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:09.400
 or do you still ask me the 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:11.650

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:13.510

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:16.960

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:22.210
 on your channel that's very important to me 

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:24.670
