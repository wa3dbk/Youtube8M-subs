ill Spyros up into this wire into this
little<00:01:07.530> gun<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.880> idea<00:01:09.240> was<00:01:09.420> that<00:01:09.450> this<00:01:09.720> guy

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
little gun the idea was that this guy

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.840 
little gun the idea was that this guy
can<00:01:09.990> create<00:01:10.380> any<00:01:10.530> color<00:01:10.770> bite<00:01:11.070> he<00:01:11.340> wants<00:01:11.729> and

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
can create any color bite he wants and

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.730 
can create any color bite he wants and
just<00:01:11.880> mass-produced<00:01:12.630> them<00:01:12.899> it's<00:01:13.440> like<00:01:13.530> oh<00:01:13.619> you

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
just mass-produced them it's like oh you

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.230 
just mass-produced them it's like oh you
want<00:01:13.890> is<00:01:13.950> a<00:01:14.039> 2-byte<00:01:14.280> here<00:01:14.759> I<00:01:14.820> make<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.090> color

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
want is a 2-byte here I make the color

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.160 
want is a 2-byte here I make the color
because<00:01:15.479> he<00:01:15.570> can<00:01:15.660> mix<00:01:15.840> them<00:01:15.930> all<00:01:16.020> together

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
because he can mix them all together

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.779 
because he can mix them all together
we're<00:01:16.619> have<00:01:16.710> an<00:01:16.800> absence<00:01:17.190> of<00:01:17.310> it<00:01:17.460> you<00:01:17.700> know

00:01:17.779 --> 00:01:17.789 
we're have an absence of it you know

we're have an absence of it you know
that<00:01:18.000> type<00:01:18.180> of<00:01:18.210> deal<00:01:19.160> but<00:01:20.160> it's<00:01:20.369> just<00:01:20.520> kind<00:01:20.820> of

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
that type of deal but it's just kind of

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.639 
that type of deal but it's just kind of
a<00:01:20.970> brick<00:01:21.210> it's<00:01:21.869> just<00:01:22.050> more<00:01:22.289> of<00:01:22.350> a<00:01:22.410> display

00:01:22.639 --> 00:01:22.649 
a brick it's just more of a display

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:24.139 
a brick it's just more of a display
piece<00:01:23.009> you<00:01:23.220> can't<00:01:23.460> really<00:01:23.640> do<00:01:23.850> all<00:01:23.970> that<00:01:24.030> much

00:01:24.139 --> 00:01:24.149 
piece you can't really do all that much

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:26.510 
piece you can't really do all that much
I<00:01:24.539> love<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.110> way<00:01:25.200> I<00:01:25.229> use<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.560> pieces<00:01:26.039> but<00:01:26.280> it

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
I love the way I use the pieces but it

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.820 
I love the way I use the pieces but it
doesn't<00:01:26.820> really<00:01:27.000> work<00:01:27.140> that<00:01:28.140> well<00:01:28.440> at<00:01:28.649> the<00:01:28.740> end

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:28.830 
doesn't really work that well at the end

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.600 
doesn't really work that well at the end
of<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.009> day<00:01:29.210> also<00:01:30.210> this<00:01:31.200> wire<00:01:31.530> these<00:01:32.220> wires

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
of the day also this wire these wires

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.850 
of the day also this wire these wires
aren't<00:01:33.240> poseable<00:01:33.900> if<00:01:33.990> ever<00:01:34.140> poseable<00:01:34.650> I<00:01:34.710> can

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
aren't poseable if ever poseable I can

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.070 
aren't poseable if ever poseable I can
make<00:01:34.979> it<00:01:35.100> look<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.310> little<00:01:35.430> cooler<00:01:35.790> but<00:01:36.210> I<00:01:36.510> can't

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.080 
make it look a little cooler but I can't

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.230 
make it look a little cooler but I can't
without<00:01:37.979> like<00:01:38.250> a<00:01:38.280> stepping<00:01:38.490> arm<00:01:38.729> attachment

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
without like a stepping arm attachment

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.020 
without like a stepping arm attachment
using<00:01:39.479> a<00:01:39.540> different<00:01:39.840> type<00:01:39.960> of<00:01:39.990> wire<00:01:40.760> also<00:01:41.760> this

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
using a different type of wire also this

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.370 
using a different type of wire also this
gun<00:01:42.240> bit<00:01:42.420> I<00:01:42.450> used<00:01:42.750> it's<00:01:43.049> not<00:01:43.200> all<00:01:43.350> that

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
gun bit I used it's not all that

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.609 
gun bit I used it's not all that
creative<00:01:43.860> at<00:01:44.759> all<00:01:44.939> I<00:01:45.150> just<00:01:45.210> want<00:01:45.689> to<00:01:45.810> use<00:01:46.080> the

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
creative at all I just want to use the

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.679 
creative at all I just want to use the
concept<00:01:47.189> of<00:01:48.320> creating<00:01:50.180> bites<00:01:51.180> out<00:01:51.420> of<00:01:51.540> just

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
concept of creating bites out of just

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.210 
concept of creating bites out of just
three<00:01:51.930> primary<00:01:52.290> colors<00:01:52.619> and<00:01:52.830> I<00:01:52.890> want<00:01:53.100> an

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
three primary colors and I want an

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.460 
three primary colors and I want an
excuse<00:01:53.670> to<00:01:53.820> use<00:01:53.850> three<00:01:54.330> opaque<00:01:54.720> primary

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
excuse to use three opaque primary

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.730 
excuse to use three opaque primary
colors<00:01:55.799> amorous<00:01:56.310> fears<00:01:57.290> but<00:01:58.290> it<00:01:58.380> looks<00:01:58.560> it

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
colors amorous fears but it looks it

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.340 
colors amorous fears but it looks it
looks<00:01:58.829> all<00:01:59.130> right<00:01:59.159> for<00:01:59.610> what<00:01:59.729> it<00:01:59.820> is<00:02:00.200> but<00:02:01.200> I'm

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
looks all right for what it is but I'm
