00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
introduced the 5c at a cheaper price

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:36.740 
introduced the 5c at a cheaper price
point<00:02:33.359> perhaps<00:02:34.170> around<00:02:34.409> 400<00:02:35.280> 450<00:02:36.030> dollars<00:02:36.540> and

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
point perhaps around 400 450 dollars and

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.780 
point perhaps around 400 450 dollars and
remember<00:02:37.469> you<00:02:37.650> can<00:02:37.829> no<00:02:38.010> longer<00:02:38.280> buy<00:02:38.730> the

remember you can no longer buy the

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.879 
remember you can no longer buy the
iphone<00:02:39.359> 5<00:02:39.659> and<00:02:39.900> this<00:02:40.319> is<00:02:40.469> essentially

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:40.889 
iphone 5 and this is essentially

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:43.550 
iphone 5 and this is essentially
replacing<00:02:41.670> the<00:02:41.939> iPhone<00:02:42.269> 5<00:02:42.510> is<00:02:42.540> the<00:02:42.930> exact<00:02:43.319> same

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
replacing the iPhone 5 is the exact same

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.759 
replacing the iPhone 5 is the exact same
thing<00:02:43.829> with<00:02:44.280> a<00:02:44.310> cheaper<00:02:44.819> plastic<00:02:45.090> design<00:02:45.769> so

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
thing with a cheaper plastic design so

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:48.649 
thing with a cheaper plastic design so
in<00:02:46.889> my<00:02:47.010> opinion<00:02:47.129> if<00:02:47.549> you<00:02:47.730> happen<00:02:48.180> to<00:02:48.269> find<00:02:48.419> an

00:02:48.649 --> 00:02:48.659 
in my opinion if you happen to find an

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:50.210 
in my opinion if you happen to find an
iphone<00:02:48.989> 5<00:02:49.230> through<00:02:49.530> your<00:02:49.680> carrier<00:02:50.069> or

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
iphone 5 through your carrier or

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.009 
iphone 5 through your carrier or
provider<00:02:50.579> and<00:02:50.849> you<00:02:50.939> can<00:02:51.060> get<00:02:51.150> a<00:02:51.209> sweet<00:02:51.629> deal<00:02:51.659> on

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
provider and you can get a sweet deal on

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:53.809 
provider and you can get a sweet deal on
an<00:02:52.169> iPhone<00:02:52.530> 5<00:02:52.799> I<00:02:53.010> would<00:02:53.280> definitely<00:02:53.489> recommend

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
an iPhone 5 I would definitely recommend

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:57.409 
an iPhone 5 I would definitely recommend
this<00:02:54.209> over<00:02:54.810> the<00:02:55.139> iphone<00:02:55.470> 5c<00:02:56.010> and<00:02:56.189> I<00:02:57.090> really

00:02:57.409 --> 00:02:57.419 
this over the iphone 5c and I really

00:02:57.419 --> 00:02:59.030 
this over the iphone 5c and I really
think<00:02:57.540> Apple<00:02:57.989> needs<00:02:58.109> to<00:02:58.290> take<00:02:58.500> a<00:02:58.530> look<00:02:58.769> at<00:02:58.950> the

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
think Apple needs to take a look at the

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.800 
think Apple needs to take a look at the
pricing<00:02:59.459> of<00:02:59.519> the<00:02:59.639> five-seat<00:03:00.150> and<00:03:00.329> adjust<00:03:00.689> it

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
pricing of the five-seat and adjust it

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.869 
pricing of the five-seat and adjust it
accordingly<00:03:01.290> if<00:03:01.530> you<00:03:01.950> compare<00:03:02.310> this<00:03:02.459> to<00:03:02.669> say

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:02.879 
accordingly if you compare this to say

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:05.149 
accordingly if you compare this to say
the<00:03:03.120> nexus<00:03:03.510> 4<00:03:03.810> which<00:03:04.079> is<00:03:04.260> less<00:03:04.709> than<00:03:04.739> half<00:03:04.980> the

00:03:05.149 --> 00:03:05.159 
the nexus 4 which is less than half the

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:07.759 
the nexus 4 which is less than half the
price<00:03:05.340> or<00:03:05.760> if<00:03:06.750> you<00:03:06.870> happen<00:03:07.169> to<00:03:07.260> add<00:03:07.379> an<00:03:07.500> extra
