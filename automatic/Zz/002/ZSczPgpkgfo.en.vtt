this using Smart Objects so here we go
here's<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.600> background<00:00:55.110> I'm<00:00:55.260> going<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:55.469> drag

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
here's the background I'm going to drag

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.689 
here's the background I'm going to drag
the<00:00:56.010> background<00:00:56.629> of<00:00:57.629> this<00:00:57.870> image<00:00:58.230> down<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:59.250> the

create new in the layers palette and

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.799 
create new in the layers palette and
this<00:01:02.370> gives<00:01:02.579> me<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:02.969> copy<00:01:03.270> of<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.690> background

this gives me a copy of the background
that<00:01:04.350> I'm<00:01:04.619> gonna<00:01:04.739> call<00:01:04.979> duotone<00:01:05.840> there<00:01:06.840> you<00:01:06.930> go

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
that I'm gonna call duotone there you go

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.800 
that I'm gonna call duotone there you go
duotone<00:01:07.790> I'm<00:01:08.790> going<00:01:09.000> to<00:01:09.060> convert<00:01:09.420> this<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.659> a

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
duotone I'm going to convert this to a

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.609 
duotone I'm going to convert this to a
smart<00:01:09.869> object<00:01:10.229> by<00:01:10.740> left-clicking<00:01:11.340> it<00:01:12.619> convert

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
smart object by left-clicking it convert

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.080 
smart object by left-clicking it convert
to<00:01:13.770> smart<00:01:14.040> object<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.610> it's<00:01:14.700> going<00:01:14.790> to<00:01:14.850> create

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
to smart object and it's going to create

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.230 
to smart object and it's going to create
my<00:01:15.270> smart<00:01:15.570> object<00:01:16.130> important<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.460> see<00:01:17.670> here<00:01:18.060> is

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
my smart object important to see here is

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.719 
my smart object important to see here is
the<00:01:18.659> tone<00:01:18.900> curve<00:01:19.170> there's<00:01:19.979> a<00:01:20.100> lot<00:01:20.310> kind<00:01:20.640> of

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
the tone curve there's a lot kind of

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.080 
the tone curve there's a lot kind of
pushing<00:01:21.119> up<00:01:21.210> on<00:01:21.740> the<00:01:22.740> pure<00:01:22.950> black<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.610> I'll

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
pushing up on the pure black and I'll

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.719 
pushing up on the pure black and I'll
probably<00:01:24.330> take<00:01:24.869> this<00:01:24.990> image<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.560> reduce<00:01:26.220> some

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
probably take this image and reduce some

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.880 
probably take this image and reduce some
of<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:27.000> contrast<00:01:27.600> using<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.170> duo<00:01:28.350> tone<00:01:28.680> so

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
of the contrast using the duo tone so

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.410 
of the contrast using the duo tone so
I'm<00:01:29.189> going<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.460> double<00:01:29.729> click<00:01:29.759> on<00:01:30.030> this<00:01:30.210> layer

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
I'm going to double click on this layer

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.069 
I'm going to double click on this layer
it<00:01:31.320> opens<00:01:31.650> up<00:01:31.799> my<00:01:31.920> smart<00:01:32.250> object<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:32.930> this<00:01:33.930> is

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
it opens up my smart object and this is

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.160 
it opens up my smart object and this is
what<00:01:34.229> I'm<00:01:34.320> going<00:01:34.500> to<00:01:34.560> do<00:01:34.710> next<00:01:35.180> go<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.240> just<00:01:36.990> two

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
what I'm going to do next go to just two

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.460 
what I'm going to do next go to just two
steps<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.619> do<00:01:37.740> this<00:01:37.890> image<00:01:38.430> mode<00:01:39.470> grayscale

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
steps to do this image mode grayscale

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.770 
steps to do this image mode grayscale
this<00:01:40.860> will<00:01:41.070> discard<00:01:42.000> all<00:01:42.329> of<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.570> color

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
this will discard all of the color

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.990 
this will discard all of the color
information<00:01:43.110> in<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.619> image<00:01:43.890> if<00:01:44.579> you<00:01:44.670> want<00:01:44.790> to

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
do your black and white conversion first

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.440 
do your black and white conversion first
using<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.040> method<00:01:47.610> of<00:01:47.700> your<00:01:47.820> choice<00:01:47.880> you<00:01:48.299> can

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
using the method of your choice you can

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.319 
using the method of your choice you can
also<00:01:48.600> do<00:01:48.869> that<00:01:49.460> you<00:01:50.460> still<00:01:50.729> have<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:51.030> convert

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
also do that you still have to convert

here warm gray with blacks
I<00:02:43.010> like<00:02:44.010> the<00:02:44.310> warm<00:02:44.670> Gray's<00:02:44.970> at<00:02:45.660> 8<00:02:45.930> and<00:02:46.170> 11<00:02:46.740> with

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
I like the warm Gray's at 8 and 11 with

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.650 
I like the warm Gray's at 8 and 11 with
black<00:02:47.900> the<00:02:48.900> cool<00:02:49.440> gray<00:02:49.910> 7<00:02:50.910> with<00:02:51.360> black

black the cool gray 7 with black
depending<00:02:52.050> on<00:02:52.290> how<00:02:52.410> much<00:02:52.590> contrast<00:02:53.070> you<00:02:53.430> want

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
depending on how much contrast you want

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.640 
depending on how much contrast you want
cool<00:02:56.640> gray<00:02:56.850> 9<00:02:57.150> is<00:02:57.480> nice<00:02:57.840> and<00:02:58.140> then<00:02:58.380> they<00:02:58.500> have

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
cool gray 9 is nice and then they have

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.760 
cool gray 9 is nice and then they have
some<00:02:58.860> of<00:02:58.980> these<00:02:59.070> up<00:02:59.310> here<00:02:59.700> also<00:03:00.660> that<00:03:01.530> bought

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
some of these up here also that bought

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:06.290 
some of these up here also that bought
that<00:03:01.800> can<00:03:02.190> be<00:03:02.310> really<00:03:02.700> nice<00:03:02.850> I<00:03:04.910> think<00:03:05.910> this<00:03:06.150> is

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
that can be really nice I think this is

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.140 
that can be really nice I think this is
pretty<00:03:06.450> nice<00:03:06.720> and<00:03:06.870> you<00:03:06.960> can<00:03:07.110> use<00:03:07.640> preview<00:03:08.640> to

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
pretty nice and you can use preview to

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.750 
pretty nice and you can use preview to
kind<00:03:09.630> of<00:03:09.720> see<00:03:09.900> the<00:03:10.350> effect<00:03:10.980> that's<00:03:11.250> occurring

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
kind of see the effect that's occurring

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.150 
kind of see the effect that's occurring
here<00:03:12.020> some<00:03:13.020> of<00:03:13.050> these<00:03:13.290> will<00:03:13.710> increase

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
here some of these will increase

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.010 
here some of these will increase
contrast<00:03:14.910> some<00:03:15.210> of<00:03:15.330> them<00:03:15.420> will<00:03:15.540> decrease

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
contrast some of them will decrease

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.960 
contrast some of them will decrease
contrast<00:03:16.680> and<00:03:17.100> if<00:03:17.370> you're<00:03:17.520> printing<00:03:17.790> on

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
contrast and if you're printing on

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.030 
contrast and if you're printing on
something<00:03:18.390> like<00:03:18.510> rag<00:03:18.840> paper<00:03:19.170> this<00:03:19.530> is<00:03:19.680> really

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
something like rag paper this is really

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.850 
something like rag paper this is really
it<00:03:20.100> can<00:03:20.250> be<00:03:20.370> it<00:03:20.610> can<00:03:20.670> be<00:03:20.790> absolutely<00:03:21.420> beautiful

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
it can be it can be absolutely beautiful

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.250 
it can be it can be absolutely beautiful
if<00:03:22.860> you<00:03:22.920> do<00:03:23.220> it<00:03:23.340> right<00:03:23.490> so<00:03:23.730> again<00:03:24.330> I<00:03:24.720> think<00:03:24.930> this

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
if you do it right so again I think this

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.810 
if you do it right so again I think this
looks<00:03:25.500> pretty<00:03:25.560> nice<00:03:25.950> it<00:03:26.190> reduces<00:03:26.640> the

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
looks pretty nice it reduces the

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.850 
looks pretty nice it reduces the
contrast<00:03:27.360> a<00:03:27.540> little<00:03:27.570> bit<00:03:27.960> it's<00:03:28.200> a<00:03:28.290> tried<00:03:28.560> tone

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
contrast a little bit it's a tried tone

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.370 
contrast a little bit it's a tried tone
it's<00:03:29.490> fairly<00:03:29.940> subtle<00:03:30.210> so<00:03:30.930> I'm<00:03:31.020> going<00:03:31.140> to<00:03:31.170> click

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
it's fairly subtle so I'm going to click

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.310 
it's fairly subtle so I'm going to click
okay<00:03:31.800> it<00:03:31.830> applies<00:03:32.250> it<00:03:32.460> to<00:03:32.580> the<00:03:32.670> image<00:03:33.320> I'm

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
okay it applies it to the image I'm

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.800 
okay it applies it to the image I'm
going<00:03:34.380> to<00:03:34.620> go<00:03:35.100> to<00:03:35.160> file<00:03:35.550> and<00:03:35.910> save<00:03:36.240> what<00:03:36.660> this

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
going to go to file and save what this

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.570 
going to go to file and save what this
will<00:03:36.960> do<00:03:37.080> is<00:03:37.230> save<00:03:37.470> your<00:03:37.500> smart<00:03:37.950> object<00:03:38.400> which

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
will do is save your smart object which

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.940 
will do is save your smart object which
is<00:03:38.730> what<00:03:38.880> you<00:03:39.000> got<00:03:39.120> to<00:03:39.270> do<00:03:39.390> when<00:03:40.380> I<00:03:40.410> close<00:03:40.770> it

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
is what you got to do when I close it

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.820 
is what you got to do when I close it
you<00:03:41.460> see<00:03:41.670> here<00:03:42.090> in<00:03:42.210> your<00:03:42.630> layer<00:03:42.870> you're<00:03:43.620> now

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
you see here in your layer you're now

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.370 
you see here in your layer you're now
viewing<00:03:44.220> the<00:03:44.250> image<00:03:44.610> and<00:03:44.820> RGB<00:03:45.390> mode<00:03:45.780> the<00:03:46.140> whole

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.650 
adjustment layers and different things
to<00:03:55.770> that<00:03:56.010> what<00:03:56.580> you'll<00:03:56.730> see<00:03:56.970> is<00:03:57.120> the<00:03:57.450> low

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
to that what you'll see is the low

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.160 
to that what you'll see is the low
contrast<00:03:58.520> if<00:03:59.520> you<00:04:00.210> look<00:04:00.390> at<00:04:00.510> the<00:04:00.690> tone<00:04:00.930> curve

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
contrast if you look at the tone curve

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.360 
contrast if you look at the tone curve
here<00:04:01.590> that<00:04:02.250> the<00:04:03.110> the<00:04:04.110> lowest<00:04:04.350> tone<00:04:04.770> is<00:04:05.100> no

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
here that the the lowest tone is no

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.640 
here that the the lowest tone is no
longer<00:04:05.640> pure<00:04:06.000> black<00:04:06.300> and<00:04:06.630> for<00:04:07.230> printing<00:04:07.530> that

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
longer pure black and for printing that

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.220 
longer pure black and for printing that
might<00:04:07.890> work<00:04:08.160> if<00:04:08.490> you're<00:04:08.900> showing<00:04:09.900> it<00:04:10.110> online

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
might work if you're showing it online

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:11.900 
might work if you're showing it online
you<00:04:10.620> might<00:04:10.770> want<00:04:11.010> to<00:04:11.040> create<00:04:11.220> a<00:04:11.490> levels

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
you might want to create a levels

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.650 
you might want to create a levels
adjustment<00:04:12.090> layer<00:04:12.540> and<00:04:13.460> close<00:04:14.460> that<00:04:14.490> up<00:04:14.820> but<00:04:15.390> I

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
adjustment layer and close that up but I

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.390 
adjustment layer and close that up but I
actually<00:04:15.840> like<00:04:16.230> the<00:04:16.380> low<00:04:16.500> contrast<00:04:17.010> look<00:04:17.280> so

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
actually like the low contrast look so

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.530 
actually like the low contrast look so
I'm<00:04:17.460> going<00:04:17.609> to<00:04:17.670> keep<00:04:17.820> it<00:04:17.970> the<00:04:18.060> way<00:04:18.090> it<00:04:18.299> is<00:04:18.359> I

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:18.540 
I'm going to keep it the way it is I
