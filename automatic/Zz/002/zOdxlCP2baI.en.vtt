00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
and what we found was that drivers

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.389 
and what we found was that drivers
mounted<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:54.270> a<00:00:54.300> front<00:00:54.600> baffle<00:00:55.100> continue<00:00:56.100> to

electrical energy ceases from the
amplifier<00:01:05.570> and<00:01:06.570> that<00:01:06.750> creates<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.830> phenomenon

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
amplifier and that creates a phenomenon

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.240 
amplifier and that creates a phenomenon
called<00:01:08.520> baffle<00:01:09.479> running<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:11.040> actually

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
called baffle running and it actually

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.450 
called baffle running and it actually
distorts<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.240> smears<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.840> sound<00:01:13.220> so<00:01:14.220> our

very expensive and wonderful products
and<00:02:27.280> they<00:02:28.030> to<00:02:28.290> eliminate<00:02:29.290> the<00:02:29.650> woofer<00:02:30.340> from

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
and they to eliminate the woofer from

and they to eliminate the woofer from
the<00:02:31.000> tweeter<00:02:31.270> but<00:02:31.690> they<00:02:31.810> do<00:02:31.870> it<00:02:32.080> in<00:02:32.200> a<00:02:32.230> little

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.040 
the tweeter but they do it in a little
bit<00:02:32.620> different<00:02:33.010> way<00:02:33.510> we<00:02:34.510> found<00:02:34.780> that<00:02:34.900> this

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
bit different way we found that this

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.790 
bit different way we found that this
offers<00:02:35.530> a<00:02:35.620> much<00:02:36.040> much<00:02:36.460> more<00:02:36.850> satisfactory

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
offers a much much more satisfactory

offers a much much more satisfactory
sound<00:02:38.800> presence<00:02:39.640> if<00:02:39.820> you<00:02:39.970> will<00:02:40.180> for<00:02:40.510> the

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
sound presence if you will for the

with our new crossover external
crossover<00:02:51.670> we<00:02:52.300> can<00:02:52.480> actually<00:02:52.720> now<00:02:53.380> create<00:02:53.950> a

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
crossover we can actually now create a

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.180

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
much better sound stage in a room

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.460 
much better sound stage in a room
because<00:02:57.790> we<00:02:57.940> can<00:02:58.209> tailor<00:02:58.480> the<00:02:58.780> sound<00:02:58.990> to<00:02:59.260> suit

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
because we can tailor the sound to suit

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.400 
because we can tailor the sound to suit
the<00:02:59.620> particular<00:02:59.770> environment<00:03:01.410> environments

the particular environment environments
are<00:03:02.560> clearly<00:03:02.980> the<00:03:03.220> most<00:03:03.340> difficult<00:03:04.060> things

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
are clearly the most difficult things

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.199 
are clearly the most difficult things
for<00:03:04.720> the<00:03:05.080> audio<00:03:05.530> engineer<00:03:05.830> and<00:03:06.250> specifically

for the audio engineer and specifically

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:09.900 
for the audio engineer and specifically
a<00:03:07.270> speaker<00:03:07.840> engineer<00:03:08.290> because<00:03:08.890> every<00:03:09.430> room<00:03:09.640> is

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
a speaker engineer because every room is

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.510 
a speaker engineer because every room is
different<00:03:10.120> and<00:03:10.800> every<00:03:11.800> engineer<00:03:12.340> and

is a pentacle to the next one we put an

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.880 

I'd<00:03:42.860> like<00:03:43.010> to<00:03:43.159> point<00:03:43.459> out<00:03:43.700> that<00:03:43.840> this<00:03:44.890> speaker

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 
I'd like to point out that this speaker

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.580 
I'd like to point out that this speaker
here<00:03:46.099> is<00:03:46.250> not<00:03:46.519> a<00:03:46.930> traditional<00:03:47.930> what<00:03:48.290> you<00:03:48.409> would

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
here is not a traditional what you would

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.149 
here is not a traditional what you would
call<00:03:48.799> sub<00:03:49.280> woofer<00:03:49.849> in<00:03:50.540> fact<00:03:51.109> there<00:03:51.379> is<00:03:51.530> no<00:03:51.739> such

00:03:52.149 --> 00:03:52.159 
call sub woofer in fact there is no such

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:55.360 
call sub woofer in fact there is no such
thing<00:03:52.459> as<00:03:52.760> sub<00:03:53.480> bass<00:03:54.049> there's<00:03:54.680> bass<00:03:54.980> but

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
thing as sub bass there's bass but

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.949 
thing as sub bass there's bass but
there's<00:03:55.549> no<00:03:55.670> sub<00:03:56.180> bass<00:03:56.450> the<00:03:57.849> terminology<00:03:58.849> that

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
there's no sub bass the terminology that

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:01.149 
there's no sub bass the terminology that
created<00:03:59.959> quote<00:04:00.140> the<00:04:00.319> sub<00:04:00.530> woofer<00:04:00.829> came<00:04:01.040> in

we manufacture low frequency transducers
and<00:04:10.540> what<00:04:11.540> we<00:04:11.689> do<00:04:11.900> is<00:04:12.139> we<00:04:12.349> try<00:04:12.650> to<00:04:12.709> make<00:04:13.670> sure

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 
and what we do is we try to make sure

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.539 
and what we do is we try to make sure
that<00:04:13.969> all<00:04:14.540> of<00:04:14.599> the<00:04:14.959> loudspeaker<00:04:15.829> systems<00:04:16.280> that

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
that all of the loudspeaker systems that

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:20.080 
that all of the loudspeaker systems that
we<00:04:16.699> may<00:04:16.880> have<00:04:17.660> a<00:04:18.039> frequency<00:04:19.039> range<00:04:19.400> not

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
we may have a frequency range not

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.379 
we may have a frequency range not
response<00:04:20.599> that<00:04:21.199> is<00:04:21.380> extremely<00:04:22.099> linear<00:04:22.430> which

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:23.389 
response that is extremely linear which

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:25.680 
response that is extremely linear which
means<00:04:23.690> that<00:04:23.960> the<00:04:24.080> output<00:04:24.620> at<00:04:24.800> each<00:04:25.039> or<00:04:25.310> any

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
means that the output at each or any

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.680 
means that the output at each or any
individual<00:04:26.690> frequency<00:04:27.410> is<00:04:27.590> the<00:04:28.099> same<00:04:28.400> or<00:04:28.849> flat

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
individual frequency is the same or flat

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:32.320 
individual frequency is the same or flat
so<00:04:30.380> the<00:04:30.500> frequency<00:04:31.070> range<00:04:31.310> about<00:04:31.729> products<00:04:32.180> we

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
so the frequency range about products we

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.870 
so the frequency range about products we
try<00:04:32.570> to<00:04:32.630> make<00:04:32.900> it<00:04:33.050> flat<00:04:33.380> a<00:04:33.770> lot<00:04:34.310> of<00:04:34.400> engineers

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
try to make it flat a lot of engineers

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.029 
try to make it flat a lot of engineers
because<00:04:35.360> of<00:04:35.570> the<00:04:35.720> room<00:04:35.930> problems<00:04:36.380> I<00:04:36.560> told<00:04:36.860> you

because of the room problems I told you

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:38.920 
because of the room problems I told you
about<00:04:37.130> before<00:04:37.570> actually<00:04:38.570> create

about before actually create

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.170 
about before actually create
loudspeakers<00:04:39.620> with<00:04:39.860> response<00:04:40.580> curves<00:04:40.970> our

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
loudspeakers with response curves our

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.260 
loudspeakers with response curves our
frequency<00:04:41.750> range<00:04:42.020> and<00:04:42.710> is<00:04:42.889> actually<00:04:43.270> elevated

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 
frequency range and is actually elevated

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.210 
frequency range and is actually elevated
at<00:04:44.360> both<00:04:44.599> ends<00:04:45.020> the<00:04:45.169> high<00:04:45.320> frequency<00:04:45.919> and<00:04:46.130> the

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.220 
at both ends the high frequency and the

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.850 
at both ends the high frequency and the
low<00:04:46.400> frequency<00:04:47.090> and<00:04:47.449> what<00:04:48.020> this<00:04:48.229> does<00:04:48.500> for<00:04:48.530> the

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:48.860 
low frequency and what this does for the

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.149 
low frequency and what this does for the
most<00:04:49.010> part<00:04:49.370> is<00:04:50.150> give<00:04:50.780> these<00:04:51.080> speakers<00:04:51.830> that

00:04:52.149 --> 00:04:52.159 
most part is give these speakers that

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:53.860 
most part is give these speakers that
you're<00:04:52.310> listening<00:04:52.490> to<00:04:52.909> with<00:04:53.180> this<00:04:53.330> response

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:53.870 
you're listening to with this response

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:56.080 
you're listening to with this response
curve<00:04:54.199> when<00:04:54.470> they<00:04:54.620> say<00:04:54.830> it's<00:04:55.159> really<00:04:55.460> flat<00:04:55.729> a

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090 
curve when they say it's really flat a

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:58.300 
curve when they say it's really flat a
little<00:04:56.870> bit<00:04:56.990> of<00:04:57.139> a<00:04:57.229> bottom<00:04:57.560> end<00:04:57.740> that<00:04:57.979> sounds

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.310 
little bit of a bottom end that sounds

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.610 
little bit of a bottom end that sounds
nice<00:04:58.520> and<00:04:58.550> booming<00:04:59.180> and<00:04:59.360> almost<00:04:59.900> sounds<00:05:00.169> great

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:00.620 
nice and booming and almost sounds great

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.070 
nice and booming and almost sounds great
also<00:05:01.070> nice<00:05:01.280> tingly<00:05:01.880> high<00:05:02.120> frequencies<00:05:02.840> and

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 
also nice tingly high frequencies and

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.200 
also nice tingly high frequencies and
it's<00:05:03.199> all<00:05:03.349> very<00:05:03.560> wonderful<00:05:04.099> but<00:05:04.280> then<00:05:04.789> if<00:05:04.940> in

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210 
it's all very wonderful but then if in

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:08.620 
it's all very wonderful but then if in
reality<00:05:05.720> it<00:05:06.229> is<00:05:06.440> an<00:05:06.830> artificial<00:05:07.630> enhancement

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:08.630 
reality it is an artificial enhancement

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:11.140 
reality it is an artificial enhancement
because<00:05:09.320> some<00:05:09.830> of<00:05:09.979> the<00:05:10.039> music<00:05:10.430> that<00:05:10.580> you're

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.150 
because some of the music that you're

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:12.700 
because some of the music that you're
listening<00:05:11.210> to<00:05:11.840> or<00:05:11.960> that<00:05:12.080> you're<00:05:12.199> playing<00:05:12.409> back

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:12.710 
listening to or that you're playing back

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:15.550 
listening to or that you're playing back
does<00:05:13.220> not<00:05:13.250> have<00:05:13.699> any<00:05:14.090> bass<00:05:14.419> and<00:05:14.780> it<00:05:15.229> doesn't

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:15.560 
does not have any bass and it doesn't

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.469 
does not have any bass and it doesn't
have<00:05:15.740> all<00:05:15.979> these<00:05:16.159> tingly<00:05:16.639> high<00:05:16.849> frequencies

00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:17.479 
have all these tingly high frequencies

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:19.870 
have all these tingly high frequencies
so<00:05:18.320> what<00:05:18.560> happens<00:05:18.919> is<00:05:19.099> you're<00:05:19.220> not<00:05:19.370> listening

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:19.880 
so what happens is you're not listening

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.399 
so what happens is you're not listening
to<00:05:20.090> the<00:05:20.270> real<00:05:20.449> music<00:05:20.720> the<00:05:21.050> way<00:05:21.169> it<00:05:21.199> was

00:05:21.399 --> 00:05:21.409 
to the real music the way it was

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:23.409 
to the real music the way it was
recorded<00:05:22.039> you're<00:05:22.460> actually<00:05:22.820> listening<00:05:23.240> to

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:23.419 
recorded you're actually listening to

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:25.120 
recorded you're actually listening to
the<00:05:23.510> music<00:05:23.630> the<00:05:23.990> way<00:05:24.139> the<00:05:24.289> speaker<00:05:24.560> engineer

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:25.130 
the music the way the speaker engineer

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:27.640 
the music the way the speaker engineer
decided<00:05:25.669> that<00:05:25.820> you<00:05:26.030> should<00:05:26.240> listen<00:05:26.449> to<00:05:26.599> it<00:05:26.900> we

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:27.650 
decided that you should listen to it we

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:29.710 
decided that you should listen to it we
don't<00:05:27.800> do<00:05:28.010> that<00:05:28.220> we<00:05:28.669> don't<00:05:28.909> have<00:05:29.300> anything

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:29.720 
don't do that we don't have anything

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.290 
don't do that we don't have anything
that<00:05:29.960> artificially<00:05:30.919> influences<00:05:31.880> the<00:05:32.060> bass

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:32.300 
that artificially influences the bass

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.560 
that artificially influences the bass
response<00:05:32.780> or<00:05:33.440> the<00:05:33.470> high<00:05:33.889> frequency<00:05:34.490> response

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:34.570 
response or the high frequency response

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:37.420 
response or the high frequency response
we<00:05:35.570> try<00:05:35.750> to<00:05:35.810> make<00:05:36.020> that<00:05:36.169> frequency<00:05:36.680> range<00:05:36.830> as

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:37.430 
we try to make that frequency range as

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:40.360 
we try to make that frequency range as
linear<00:05:37.699> as<00:05:38.060> possible<00:05:38.630> so<00:05:38.810> if<00:05:39.620> there<00:05:39.800> is<00:05:40.009> bass

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:40.370 
linear as possible so if there is bass

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:42.999 
linear as possible so if there is bass
in<00:05:40.729> the<00:05:41.000> program<00:05:41.419> you<00:05:41.930> hear<00:05:42.169> it<00:05:42.259> and<00:05:42.440> if<00:05:42.800> there

00:05:42.999 --> 00:05:43.009 
in the program you hear it and if there

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:46.860 
in the program you hear it and if there
isn't<00:05:43.250> we<00:05:43.909> don't<00:05:44.150> make<00:05:44.360> it<00:05:44.539> for<00:05:44.720> you<00:05:45.009> so

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:46.870 
isn't we don't make it for you so

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:48.750 
isn't we don't make it for you so
all<00:05:47.440> of<00:05:47.620> the<00:05:47.710> products<00:05:48.100> that<00:05:48.130> we<00:05:48.250> try<00:05:48.550> to<00:05:48.580> make

all of the products that we try to make

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.870 
all of the products that we try to make
have<00:05:49.300> clearly<00:05:49.750> one<00:05:50.230> one<00:05:50.740> grand<00:05:51.160> thing<00:05:51.460> in<00:05:51.610> mind

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:53.890 
and that is to make the response as

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:56.580 
and that is to make the response as

take a look at this little speaker here

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.610 
take a look at this little speaker here
which<00:06:33.880> is<00:06:34.030> a<00:06:34.150> bookshelf<00:06:34.600> version<00:06:35.290> but<00:06:35.470> you

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:35.620 
which is a bookshelf version but you

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:36.960 
which is a bookshelf version but you
could<00:06:35.800> put<00:06:35.920> it<00:06:36.070> on<00:06:36.160> the<00:06:36.340> stand<00:06:36.580> as<00:06:36.790> its

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:36.970 
could put it on the stand as its

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:39.600 
could put it on the stand as its
displayed<00:06:37.240> here<00:06:37.770> these<00:06:38.770> loudspeakers<00:06:39.460> are

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:39.610 
displayed here these loudspeakers are

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:41.430 
displayed here these loudspeakers are
the<00:06:39.700> ones<00:06:39.910> that<00:06:40.180> most<00:06:40.420> loud<00:06:41.110> speaker

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:41.440 
the ones that most loud speaker

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:43.860 
the ones that most loud speaker
engineers<00:06:41.920> try<00:06:42.190> to<00:06:42.250> get<00:06:42.610> lots<00:06:42.880> of<00:06:43.120> bass<00:06:43.420> from

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:43.870 
engineers try to get lots of bass from

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:46.290 
engineers try to get lots of bass from
so<00:06:44.620> these<00:06:44.860> are<00:06:45.040> the<00:06:45.130> ones<00:06:45.340> that<00:06:45.580> really<00:06:45.910> have

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:46.300 
so these are the ones that really have

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:49.110 
so these are the ones that really have
an<00:06:46.420> artificial<00:06:46.930> frequency<00:06:47.800> range<00:06:48.130> and<00:06:48.400> they

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:49.120 
an artificial frequency range and they

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.600 
an artificial frequency range and they
produce<00:06:49.360> old<00:06:49.870> fantastic<00:06:50.740> bass<00:06:50.950> when<00:06:51.250> indeed

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:51.610 
produce old fantastic bass when indeed

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:53.550 
produce old fantastic bass when indeed
they<00:06:51.790> don't<00:06:52.000> produce<00:06:52.180> fantastic<00:06:52.540> bass<00:06:53.140> at<00:06:53.350> all

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:53.560 
they don't produce fantastic bass at all

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:57.840 
they don't produce fantastic bass at all
it's<00:06:54.300> artificially<00:06:55.300> induced<00:06:55.830> so<00:06:56.830> when<00:06:57.700> our

00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:57.850 
it's artificially induced so when our

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:00.180 
it's artificially induced so when our
products<00:06:58.270> are<00:06:58.690> playing<00:06:58.990> back<00:06:59.230> bass<00:06:59.530> there<00:07:00.040> is
