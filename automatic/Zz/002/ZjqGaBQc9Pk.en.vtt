the<00:00:46.670> nice<00:00:46.850> thing<00:00:46.879> about<00:00:47.149> aluminum<00:00:48.140> is<00:00:48.320> that

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559 
the nice thing about aluminum is that

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:51.369 
the nice thing about aluminum is that
you<00:00:48.769> can<00:00:49.039> well<00:00:49.429> this<00:00:49.699> you<00:00:50.000> can<00:00:50.210> bend<00:00:51.109> it<00:00:51.320> you

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:51.379 
you can well this you can bend it you

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:53.529 
you can well this you can bend it you
can<00:00:51.920> cost<00:00:52.250> it<00:00:52.579> you<00:00:52.699> can<00:00:52.879> do<00:00:53.059> everything<00:00:53.390> with

00:00:53.529 --> 00:00:53.539 
can cost it you can do everything with

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:55.990 
can cost it you can do everything with
it<00:00:53.690> and<00:00:54.109> it's<00:00:54.589> light<00:00:54.859> material<00:00:55.399> and<00:00:55.670> we<00:00:55.820> can

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
it and it's light material and we can

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000 
it and it's light material and we can
reuse<00:00:56.539> it<00:00:56.719> very<00:00:56.960> easily<00:00:57.199> now<00:00:57.710> we<00:00:57.800> start

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
reuse it very easily now we start

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.469 
reuse it very easily now we start
looking<00:00:58.100> into<00:00:58.309> robotics<00:00:58.850> because<00:00:58.969> we<00:00:59.329> got

00:00:59.469 --> 00:00:59.479 
looking into robotics because we got

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:02.259 
looking into robotics because we got
mass<00:01:00.229> production<00:01:00.739> series<00:01:01.489> of<00:01:01.820> 2<00:01:01.969> million

00:01:02.259 --> 00:01:02.269 
mass production series of 2 million

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:06.249 
mass production series of 2 million
pieces<00:01:02.899> and<00:01:03.970> well<00:01:04.970> there's<00:01:05.299> a<00:01:05.420> large

00:01:06.249 --> 00:01:06.259 
pieces and well there's a large

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:08.830 
pieces and well there's a large
competitive<00:01:07.100> issue<00:01:07.310> although<00:01:07.909> we're<00:01:08.299> very<00:01:08.539> a

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
competitive issue although we're very a

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.240 
competitive issue although we're very a
very<00:01:09.229> mass<00:01:09.830> production<00:01:10.689> type<00:01:11.689> of<00:01:11.840> Industry<00:01:12.320> we

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
very mass production type of Industry we

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.520 
very mass production type of Industry we
start<00:01:13.549> with<00:01:13.700> creative<00:01:14.119> thinking<00:01:14.439> when<00:01:15.439> we

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
start with creative thinking when we

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.200 
start with creative thinking when we
calculate<00:01:16.070> the<00:01:16.280> improvement<00:01:16.880> of<00:01:16.970> the

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
calculate the improvement of the

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.690 
calculate the improvement of the
production<00:01:17.780> it's<00:01:18.259> around<00:01:18.649> 20<00:01:19.069> to<00:01:19.130> 25<00:01:19.490> percent

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
production it's around 20 to 25 percent

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.120 
production it's around 20 to 25 percent
maybe<00:01:20.149> 30<00:01:20.450> percent<00:01:20.840> the<00:01:21.050> efficiency<00:01:21.679> is<00:01:21.890> have

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
maybe 30 percent the efficiency is have

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.639 
maybe 30 percent the efficiency is have
increased<00:01:22.550> now<00:01:23.119> one<00:01:23.479> guy<00:01:23.690> is<00:01:23.990> running<00:01:24.440> two

00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:24.649 
increased now one guy is running two

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:27.399 
increased now one guy is running two
cells<00:01:25.250> together<00:01:26.090> with<00:01:26.390> a<00:01:26.420> robot<00:01:26.810> before<00:01:27.289> they

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
cells together with a robot before they

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:30.100 
cells together with a robot before they
were<00:01:27.619> using<00:01:27.830> two<00:01:28.610> guys<00:01:28.819> to<00:01:29.299> run<00:01:29.509> two<00:01:29.840> cells

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
were using two guys to run two cells

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.590 
were using two guys to run two cells
later<00:01:30.799> on<00:01:30.979> we<00:01:31.130> found<00:01:31.640> out<00:01:31.850> that<00:01:32.179> their<00:01:32.330> elbows

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
later on we found out that their elbows

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.990 
later on we found out that their elbows
can<00:01:32.780> help<00:01:33.020> us<00:01:33.170> to<00:01:33.500> get<00:01:34.009> a<00:01:34.039> higher<00:01:34.280> quality<00:01:34.700> and

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
can help us to get a higher quality and

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.899 
can help us to get a higher quality and
have<00:01:35.450> a<00:01:35.479> stable<00:01:35.899> production<00:01:36.799> the<00:01:37.250> costing<00:01:37.759> of

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
have a stable production the costing of

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:40.930 
have a stable production the costing of
this<00:01:38.090> type<00:01:38.479> of<00:01:38.509> process<00:01:38.869> is<00:01:39.229> very<00:01:39.940> important

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940 
this type of process is very important

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.210 
this type of process is very important
that<00:01:41.030> you<00:01:41.179> have<00:01:41.360> a<00:01:41.390> qualified<00:01:42.319> operator<00:01:42.830> to<00:01:43.100> do

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
that you have a qualified operator to do

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.399 
that you have a qualified operator to do
the<00:01:43.340> costing<00:01:43.789> movements<00:01:44.270> and<00:01:44.450> to<00:01:45.020> reproduce

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:45.409 
the costing movements and to reproduce

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:48.580 
the costing movements and to reproduce
it<00:01:46.130> every<00:01:46.640> time<00:01:46.850> at<00:01:47.090> the<00:01:47.179> same<00:01:47.390> way<00:01:47.600> with<00:01:48.470> the

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
it every time at the same way with the

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.429 
it every time at the same way with the
robot<00:01:48.979> you<00:01:49.969> are<00:01:50.149> more<00:01:50.450> independent<00:01:50.869> of<00:01:51.320> the

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:51.439 
robot you are more independent of the

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:53.170 
robot you are more independent of the
people<00:01:51.590> there<00:01:52.039> all<00:01:52.189> were<00:01:52.310> doing<00:01:52.460> exactly<00:01:53.000> the

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 
people there all were doing exactly the

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.970 
people there all were doing exactly the
same<00:01:53.210> every<00:01:53.840> time

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:57.980 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:02.180 

one<00:01:58.980> of<00:01:59.190> the<00:01:59.600> most<00:02:00.600> difficult<00:02:01.080> part<00:02:01.290> was<00:02:01.380> the

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.190 
one of the most difficult part was the

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.160 
one of the most difficult part was the
people<00:02:02.550> who<00:02:02.580> was<00:02:02.850> working<00:02:03.210> before<00:02:03.540> by<00:02:03.960> him

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
people who was working before by him

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.820 
people who was working before by him
because<00:02:04.950> they<00:02:05.310> feel<00:02:05.640> some<00:02:05.940> kind<00:02:06.210> of

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
because they feel some kind of

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.190 
because they feel some kind of
competition<00:02:07.830> with<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.340> robot<00:02:08.700> and<00:02:09.000> they<00:02:09.990> know

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
competition with the robot and they know

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.350 
competition with the robot and they know
their<00:02:10.560> process<00:02:11.070> was<00:02:11.250> very<00:02:11.430> difficult<00:02:11.790> so<00:02:12.240> they

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
their process was very difficult so they

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.450 
their process was very difficult so they
say<00:02:12.510> you<00:02:12.600> can<00:02:12.780> never<00:02:12.990> do<00:02:13.260> it<00:02:13.410> with<00:02:13.560> a<00:02:13.590> robot<00:02:13.950> as

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.460 
say you can never do it with a robot as

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.790 
say you can never do it with a robot as
soon<00:02:14.670> as<00:02:14.820> people<00:02:15.150> get<00:02:15.300> measured<00:02:15.750> they<00:02:16.530> think

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
soon as people get measured they think

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.950 
soon as people get measured they think
oh<00:02:17.040> that's<00:02:17.790> gonna<00:02:17.910> happen<00:02:18.180> with<00:02:18.300> my<00:02:18.390> job<00:02:18.630> and

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
oh that's gonna happen with my job and

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.370 
oh that's gonna happen with my job and
then<00:02:19.890> we<00:02:19.980> say<00:02:20.130> well<00:02:20.340> we<00:02:21.330> want<00:02:21.480> to<00:02:21.660> produce<00:02:21.810> more

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
then we say well we want to produce more

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.410 
then we say well we want to produce more
with<00:02:22.560> the<00:02:22.680> same<00:02:22.890> group<00:02:23.130> better<00:02:23.970> with<00:02:24.150> the<00:02:24.240> same

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
with the same group better with the same

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.870 
with the same group better with the same
group<00:02:24.630> higher<00:02:25.200> quality<00:02:25.830> with<00:02:26.010> same<00:02:26.250> group<00:02:26.490> and

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
group higher quality with same group and

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.330 
group higher quality with same group and
when<00:02:27.390> you<00:02:27.570> feel<00:02:27.870> good<00:02:28.110> that's<00:02:28.530> okay

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
when you feel good that's okay

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.490 
when you feel good that's okay
you<00:02:30.030> feel<00:02:30.390> good<00:02:30.630> it's<00:02:30.810> then<00:02:31.140> then<00:02:31.380> your

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
you feel good it's then then your

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.620 
you feel good it's then then your
production<00:02:31.920> process<00:02:32.250> is<00:02:32.400> better<00:02:32.610> so<00:02:33.390> our

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
production process is better so our

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.130 
production process is better so our
illness<00:02:34.170> rate<00:02:34.380> is<00:02:34.560> going<00:02:34.860> down<00:02:35.010> like<00:02:36.140> it's

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
illness rate is going down like it's

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.680 
illness rate is going down like it's
almost<00:02:37.380> zero<00:02:37.560> they're<00:02:38.490> happy<00:02:38.760> and<00:02:39.390> happy

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
almost zero they're happy and happy

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.630 
almost zero they're happy and happy
people<00:02:40.080> produce<00:02:40.290> beautiful<00:02:40.950> products

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
people produce beautiful products

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.670 
people produce beautiful products
actually<00:02:42.300> from<00:02:42.720> the<00:02:42.810> beginning<00:02:43.200> we<00:02:43.290> put<00:02:43.470> it<00:02:43.560> in

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
actually from the beginning we put it in

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.560 
actually from the beginning we put it in
production<00:02:44.190> I<00:02:44.310> saw<00:02:44.790> the<00:02:44.850> changement<00:02:45.390> of<00:02:45.480> the

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
production I saw the changement of the

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.780 
production I saw the changement of the
people<00:02:45.930> and<00:02:46.260> that<00:02:47.040> was<00:02:47.190> a<00:02:47.220> very<00:02:47.520> nice

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
people and that was a very nice

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.470 
people and that was a very nice
experience<00:02:48.060> for<00:02:48.600> me<00:02:48.720> as<00:02:48.900> well<00:02:49.050> because

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
experience for me as well because

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.260 
experience for me as well because
programming<00:02:51.480> is<00:02:51.600> not<00:02:51.930> a<00:02:51.960> problem<00:02:52.230> but<00:02:53.270> winning

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
programming is not a problem but winning

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.110 
programming is not a problem but winning
the<00:02:54.890> the<00:02:55.890> fate<00:02:56.190> of<00:02:56.220> the<00:02:56.460> people<00:02:56.640> that's<00:02:57.060> very

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
the the fate of the people that's very

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.190 
the the fate of the people that's very
important<00:02:57.840> that<00:02:58.440> they<00:02:58.590> have<00:02:58.620> faded<00:02:59.240> and<00:03:00.240> I

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
important that they have faded and I

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.740 
important that they have faded and I
think<00:03:01.470> that's<00:03:01.650> also<00:03:02.180> the<00:03:03.180> people<00:03:03.510> must

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
think that's also the people must

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.020 
think that's also the people must
believe<00:03:04.320> in<00:03:04.739> the<00:03:04.830> robot<00:03:05.190> otherwise<00:03:05.489> it<00:03:05.700> never

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
believe in the robot otherwise it never

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:13.550 
believe in the robot otherwise it never
can<00:03:06.209> be<00:03:06.360> a<00:03:06.390> success

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.440 

from<00:03:14.560> my<00:03:14.709> point<00:03:14.950> of<00:03:15.069> view<00:03:15.129> a<00:03:15.310> will<00:03:15.580> be<00:03:15.700> is<00:03:15.970> the

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
from my point of view a will be is the

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.289 
from my point of view a will be is the
best<00:03:17.099> especially<00:03:18.099> the<00:03:18.670> software

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
best especially the software

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:22.350 
best especially the software

of making the program but help make the

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:26.940 
of making the program but help make the
intervention<00:03:25.180> with<00:03:25.329> the<00:03:25.360> operator<00:03:25.920> ABB<00:03:26.920> is

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
intervention with the operator ABB is

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.729 
intervention with the operator ABB is
far<00:03:27.430> away<00:03:27.519> the<00:03:27.640> best<00:03:27.959> in<00:03:28.959> our<00:03:29.079> philosophy<00:03:29.200> we

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
far away the best in our philosophy we

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:32.250 
far away the best in our philosophy we
put<00:03:30.280> in<00:03:30.459> specialists<00:03:31.239> and<00:03:31.480> what<00:03:31.750> we<00:03:31.900> see<00:03:32.110> is

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
put in specialists and what we see is

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.530 
put in specialists and what we see is
that<00:03:32.290> we've<00:03:32.590> got<00:03:32.829> a<00:03:33.099> to<00:03:33.370> be<00:03:33.549> robotics<00:03:34.120> as<00:03:34.360> a

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
that we've got a to be robotics as a

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.699 
that we've got a to be robotics as a
very<00:03:35.290> well<00:03:35.920> founded<00:03:36.810> company<00:03:37.810> who<00:03:37.989> delivers

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
very well founded company who delivers

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:42.000 
very well founded company who delivers
and<00:03:38.920> supplies<00:03:39.959> robots<00:03:40.959> for<00:03:41.170> years<00:03:41.530> and<00:03:41.739> years

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
and supplies robots for years and years

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.429 
and supplies robots for years and years
so<00:03:42.099> there's<00:03:42.459> a<00:03:42.519> huge<00:03:42.849> experience<00:03:43.390> and<00:03:44.260> we've

00:03:44.429 --> 00:03:44.439 
so there's a huge experience and we've

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:47.460 
so there's a huge experience and we've
got<00:03:44.650> robots<00:03:45.430> who<00:03:45.870> implemented<00:03:46.870> the<00:03:46.989> rubbles

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
got robots who implemented the rubbles

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.460 
got robots who implemented the rubbles
so<00:03:47.950> we<00:03:48.040> gots<00:03:48.250> to<00:03:48.849> specialists<00:03:49.540> combined<00:03:50.319> with

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
so we gots to specialists combined with

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.849 
so we gots to specialists combined with
our<00:03:50.590> specialism<00:03:51.389> and<00:03:52.389> when<00:03:52.659> two<00:03:52.810> minds<00:03:53.139> cross

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:53.859 
our specialism and when two minds cross

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:56.940 
our specialism and when two minds cross
and<00:03:54.220> have<00:03:54.519> a<00:03:54.549> click<00:03:54.909> then<00:03:55.470> extra<00:03:56.470> energy<00:03:56.590> comes

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
and have a click then extra energy comes

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.160 
and have a click then extra energy comes
in<00:03:57.099> so<00:03:57.849> that's<00:03:57.970> nothing<00:03:58.269> that's<00:03:58.659> innovation

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
in so that's nothing that's innovation

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.129 
in so that's nothing that's innovation
it's<00:03:59.709> creative
