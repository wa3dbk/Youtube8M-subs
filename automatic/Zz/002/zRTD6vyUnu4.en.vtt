york normally do for the normal you get
right<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:55.320> that<00:00:56.160> just<00:00:56.399> brings<00:00:56.850> them<00:00:57.059> tour<00:00:57.270> to

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
right and that just brings them tour to

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.220 
right and that just brings them tour to
the<00:00:57.449> right<00:00:57.719> you<00:00:57.930> know<00:00:58.969> then<00:00:59.969> let<00:01:00.840> me<00:01:00.870> just<00:01:01.109> go

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
platform's move so let's just do a

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.420 
platform's move so let's just do a
normal<00:01:17.040> game<00:01:17.930> now<00:01:18.930> let's<00:01:19.110> start<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.409> game<00:01:20.960> and
