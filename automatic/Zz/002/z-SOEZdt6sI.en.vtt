00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.130 
every time we hit somebody with our body
just<00:02:05.520> from<00:02:05.850> visual<00:02:06.270> or<00:02:06.479> all<00:02:06.630> different<00:02:06.840> ways

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
just from visual or all different ways

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.180 
just from visual or all different ways
we<00:02:07.439> attack<00:02:07.770> with

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
we attack with

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.560 
we attack with
we're<00:02:08.340> hitting<00:02:08.490> their<00:02:08.729> senses<00:02:09.090> in<00:02:09.119> every<00:02:09.420> way

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:09.570 
we're hitting their senses in every way

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:12.410 
we're hitting their senses in every way
but<00:02:09.830> at<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:10.950> same<00:02:11.220> time<00:02:11.550> at<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:11.880> note<00:02:12.060> that<00:02:12.270> we

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
but at the same time at the note that we

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.980 
but at the same time at the note that we
are<00:02:12.570> becoming<00:02:12.720> the<00:02:13.200> self<00:02:13.500> as<00:02:13.710> we<00:02:14.400> evolve<00:02:14.840> so<00:02:15.840> we

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
are becoming the self as we evolve so we

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.890 
are becoming the self as we evolve so we
become<00:02:16.350> invisible<00:02:16.650> in<00:02:17.040> a<00:02:17.070> sense<00:02:17.480> because<00:02:18.480> the

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
become invisible in a sense because the

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.590 
become invisible in a sense because the
self<00:02:19.260> is<00:02:19.500> buoyed<00:02:19.890> so<00:02:20.820> we<00:02:20.970> have<00:02:21.090> to<00:02:21.180> understand

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
self is buoyed so we have to understand

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.900 
self is buoyed so we have to understand
that<00:02:21.690> we<00:02:21.870> do<00:02:22.020> not<00:02:22.050> our<00:02:22.380> inner<00:02:22.620> stand<00:02:23.040> that<00:02:23.760> we

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
that we do not our inner stand that we

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.100 
that we do not our inner stand that we
do<00:02:24.090> not<00:02:24.360> exist<00:02:25.080> the<00:02:26.040> body<00:02:26.340> exists<00:02:27.090> we<00:02:27.330> insist

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
do not exist the body exists we insist

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.070 
do not exist the body exists we insist
that<00:02:28.470> we<00:02:29.010> exist

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
that we exist

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.590 
that we exist

you<00:03:06.630> become<00:03:06.930> more<00:03:06.990> void<00:03:07.460> you<00:03:08.460> become<00:03:08.760> let<00:03:08.970> you

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
you become more void you become let you

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.880 
you become more void you become let you
have<00:03:09.210> less<00:03:09.720> disturbance<00:03:10.230> within<00:03:10.530> you<00:03:10.680> so<00:03:10.830> you

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
have less disturbance within you so you

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.830 
have less disturbance within you so you

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
have less disturbance out win so within

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.270 
have less disturbance out win so within
as<00:03:13.220> without<00:03:14.390> so<00:03:15.390> you<00:03:16.260> become<00:03:16.590> even<00:03:16.620> more<00:03:16.890> void

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
as without so you become even more void

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.130 
as without so you become even more void
in<00:03:17.459> that<00:03:17.580> sense<00:03:17.850> your<00:03:18.180> footprints<00:03:18.810> your
