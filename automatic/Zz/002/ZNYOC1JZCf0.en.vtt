 I want to introduce the new glove 

00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:13.690

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.049

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:16.119
 euros 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:17.199
 I will keep every quarter of an hour 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:19.450
 who are looking for a first camp 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:20.890
 good quality workout so that 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:27.190
 going to be there it's really the top 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:30.400
 to start at this position so that's it 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:32.590
 moss so flu goes head one a 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.300
 correct foam with a good 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:39.120
 grip for youth 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:41.350
 beginners who who starts so as said 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.909
 she may still be at risk 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.469
 still to get damaged quickly enough 

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:46.809
 if you use it frequently 

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:50.559
 so that's why I think for 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:52.659
 beginners it's perfect are on it 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:54.760
 of the glove we find a latex back hand 

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:59.889
 early really allow us a good 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:02.829
 correct adhesion a textile a textile 

00:00:59.889 --> 00:01:05.229
 end here at this level to the body of the glove at 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:07.600
 thumb level also between 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:11.110
 fingers here paramat a better 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:16.990
 flexibility we find seams 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:18.490
 flat on this big basically at 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:22.509
 level of the bench of aston and one finds a 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.399
 classic editing with a scratch here 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:25.240
 for a better support 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:27.280
 on the other hand at the personalization level 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.549
 we will not be able to do the marking because 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:34.659
 that it's a plastic material that 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:36.310
 risk of heating and therefore sticking and 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:38.229
 to leave with 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.939
 on the other hand I can not go back nantes 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:42.030

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:42.030
 me 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:47.960

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:49.820
 near all thankfully it's a glove a 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:53.620
 twenty euros a very price 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:55.700
 reasonable for a glove first point 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.510
 it's really ideal for young people 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.310
