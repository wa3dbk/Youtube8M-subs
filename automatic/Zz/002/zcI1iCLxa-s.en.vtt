00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:16.630
 let's see two simple examples of how 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:19.119
 wake up or what orders do we have to 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.070
 run to wake up a computer to 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:23.380
 come through internet 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.660
 previous videotutorials we have already 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.460
 everything is ready then well let's 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.099
 see the example both from a system 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.349
 windows as from a linux system that 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:34.780
 we should run to be able 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:37.630
 wake up that computer that for example 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:40.660
 is in our house and wake him up from 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:42.910
 for example the institute as well if 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.140
 we had the windows case what 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.199
 we have done has been download from 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:49.179
 internet one of the many 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:53.780
 applications that there are to be able to perform 

00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:55.840
 this mission that is in this case world we 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:59.090
 that I downloaded from this page 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.980
 I repeat there are quite a few types of 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.960
 applications of this type we have worth 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.690
 chosen is how we could have 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.659
 chosen anybody well we have 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.790
 entered on this page and here to the 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:14.060
 left we have the option of world 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:17.240
 for windows we click and what 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.430
 we have done basically is there is a 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.810
 application in graphical environment where 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:25.670
 we just fill in the data and 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.050
 wake up the computer as well you can 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.630
 simply check in this image 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:31.790
 it draws attention where we will place 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.550
 the mac address 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:37.040
 the internet address that either 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:41.750
 We use the public ip address of the 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:44.900
 router or if we're playing with the 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:47.030
 team dns or non-ip options inside 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:51.790
 of the router so we can use a 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.790
 domain name then the mask 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:58.530
 the shipping options 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:01.380
 and the port that in this case we want 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.360
 use in the same way that you have 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.760
 seen before we have played with the 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.909
 port number 7 that the one that defines in 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.739
 this case with this application 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:12.190
 download and masters with the button that 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:15.310
 appears below 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:18.640
 the file and what we would get would be 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:22.360
 a compressed file called world 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:26.230
 What we do is extract the 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:29.170
 folder and we would simply do what 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:31.360
 next we open the folder here is 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:35.350
 the application that simply a small 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:37.000
 executable we double click and in this 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:40.180
 case what we would have is on the one hand 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.780
 that fill the mac from the remote computer 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.670
 for example 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.660
 I'm just using an example 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.660
 for you to see 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.730
 then the internet address is 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.150
 well I said before it could be a 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.150
 address 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:05.579
 how is this 80 81 80 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:12.739
 75 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.739
 then the mask that belonged 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:24.960
 then shipping options if in this case 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:27.360
 is to a local network or through the internet 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:30.030
 and then the port where we want 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.730
 trip in this case the port number 7 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.950
 then we would simply have to do 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:39.090
 one click 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:42.390
 to get up and I click send to 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:46.860
 the order of the magic pack would be 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:50.520
 sent to that address according 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:52.620
 While this is graphically from the 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:56.480
 Windows environment as we could do 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.480
 from a linux environment 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.840
 the screen saver has gone 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:15.519
 well we have not started the session 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.430
 and in this case, we should 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:20.859
 execute then let's use the 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:23.440
 wake on lan tool that already in this 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:25.030
 case is installed as we saw in the 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.460
 simple examples when we were 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:29.620
 waking up a computer through the 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:32.949
 local network because in this case with the 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:35.070
 wake on line application that previously 

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:38.410
 as I said before we had installed 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:41.650
 what we would do would be the following with 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:44.710
 the parameter - and we define the address 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:48.250
 ip or in this case the domain of the 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:51.490
 remote machine could well be a 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:53.550
 typical 8080 as about 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:57.200
 before 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:59.790
 the public ip address then less 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:05.810
 space the port where we are not going to 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:05.810
 connect the 7 and the computer mac 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:17.260
 in agreement 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:20.560
 simply press enter 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:22.810
 and I would send the packet to that ip address 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:25.600
 in the same way as I said before 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:30.100
 the place if we have defined the router 

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:34.600
 with dyn dns so we can use a 

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:38.520
 domain name instead of 80 81 80 

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.520
 75 we could use for example 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:43.780
 Well, names like for example 

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:50.180
 this other agree that we have 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:51.919
 defined in this case on the router 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:54.600
 remember with interests what 

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:58.680
 we do is link 

00:05:54.600 --> 00:06:03.060
 this ip address we link it with this 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:04.770
 domain name is worth with that with that 

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:07.680
 Internet adress 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:10.259
 agree well and in this other way 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:12.060
 Well, we could also awaken the 

00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:16.440
 computer as long as I repeat 

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:18.539
 we have configured interest or not ip in 

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:20.669
 our router well of these two 

00:06:18.539 --> 00:06:23.159
 so simple ways we can wake up 

00:06:20.669 --> 00:06:25.500
 a good internet computer with the 

00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:28.039
 command or in graphic mode as we have 

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:28.039
 seen in windows 

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:35.680
 here you have it or on the other hand with 

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:37.599
 a name with a command or the environment 

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:41.919
 graphic as in this case we have seen 

00:06:37.599 --> 00:06:44.849
 with a linux system of agreement come 

00:06:41.919 --> 00:06:44.849
 see you later
