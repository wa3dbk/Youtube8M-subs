about an exciting new product that we

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.760 
about an exciting new product that we
have<00:00:24.490> was<00:00:25.119> actually<00:00:25.539> inspired<00:00:25.840> by<00:00:26.200> a<00:00:26.410> friend

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:26.770 
have was actually inspired by a friend

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.850 
have was actually inspired by a friend
of<00:00:26.890> ours<00:00:27.300> named<00:00:28.300> vlad<00:00:28.689> giovanna<00:00:29.259> bitch<00:00:29.529> and

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:29.860 
of ours named vlad giovanna bitch and

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.670 
of ours named vlad giovanna bitch and
flat<00:00:30.489> came<00:00:30.880> up<00:00:31.060> with<00:00:31.240> this<00:00:31.359> great<00:00:31.689> idea<00:00:31.720> called

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:32.680 
flat came up with this great idea called

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.090 
flat came up with this great idea called
dual<00:00:33.220> root<00:00:33.790> zoning<00:00:34.390> and<00:00:34.660> what<00:00:35.230> this<00:00:35.470> is<00:00:35.890> you

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.100 
dual root zoning and what this is you

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.610 
dual root zoning and what this is you
can<00:00:36.280> kind<00:00:36.489> of<00:00:36.670> see<00:00:36.970> over<00:00:37.239> here<00:00:37.809> we've<00:00:38.080> got<00:00:38.110> it

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:38.620 
can kind of see over here we've got it

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.009 
can kind of see over here we've got it
going<00:00:39.010> without<00:00:39.699> the<00:00:39.940> dual<00:00:40.120> root<00:00:40.449> zone<00:00:40.720> and

00:00:41.009 --> 00:00:41.019 
going without the dual root zone and

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:43.650 
going without the dual root zone and
with<00:00:41.410> the<00:00:41.680> dual<00:00:41.890> root<00:00:42.190> zone<00:00:42.489> and<00:00:42.910> I'm<00:00:43.210> betting

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:43.660 
with the dual root zone and I'm betting

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.450 
with the dual root zone and I'm betting
that<00:00:43.690> you<00:00:43.839> can<00:00:44.110> probably<00:00:44.379> see<00:00:44.949> the<00:00:44.980> amazing

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.460 
that you can probably see the amazing

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.180 
that you can probably see the amazing
difference<00:00:46.180> between<00:00:46.600> these<00:00:46.780> two<00:00:47.080> what<00:00:47.799> it<00:00:47.949> is

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.190 
difference between these two what it is

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.660 
difference between these two what it is
is<00:00:48.519> you<00:00:48.699> take<00:00:48.970> a<00:00:49.000> pot<00:00:49.540> and<00:00:50.260> in<00:00:50.949> the<00:00:51.070> bottom<00:00:51.280> half

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:51.670 
is you take a pot and in the bottom half

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.910 
is you take a pot and in the bottom half
of<00:00:51.940> the<00:00:52.030> pot<00:00:52.239> you<00:00:52.809> just<00:00:53.049> have<00:00:53.199> your<00:00:53.409> standard

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920 
of the pot you just have your standard

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.969 
of the pot you just have your standard
grow<00:00:54.159> media<00:00:54.629> then<00:00:55.629> you<00:00:55.780> put<00:00:55.989> down<00:00:56.170> a<00:00:56.229> layer<00:00:56.650> of

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:56.979 
grow media then you put down a layer of

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:59.189 
grow media then you put down a layer of
fabric<00:00:57.879> that<00:00:57.909> the<00:00:58.180> roots<00:00:58.420> can<00:00:58.540> actually<00:00:58.989> get

00:00:59.189 --> 00:00:59.199 
fabric that the roots can actually get

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:03.090 
fabric that the roots can actually get
through<00:00:59.500> and<00:01:00.000> soil<00:01:01.000> on<00:01:01.360> top<00:01:01.390> of<00:01:01.839> that<00:01:02.049> the<00:01:02.680> idea

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
through and soil on top of that the idea

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.580 
through and soil on top of that the idea
being<00:01:03.430> that<00:01:03.580> the<00:01:03.760> media<00:01:04.299> part<00:01:04.689> is<00:01:04.960> sunk<00:01:05.350> down

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
being that the media part is sunk down

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.310 
being that the media part is sunk down
into<00:01:06.189> your<00:01:06.310> grow<00:01:06.580> bed<00:01:06.610> so<00:01:07.510> it's<00:01:07.720> actually<00:01:08.020> a

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 
into your grow bed so it's actually a

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.950 
into your grow bed so it's actually a
part<00:01:08.710> of<00:01:08.860> your<00:01:09.010> aquaponic<00:01:09.369> system<00:01:10.210> but<00:01:10.810> the

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
part of your aquaponic system but the

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.249 
part of your aquaponic system but the
top<00:01:11.320> half<00:01:11.710> with<00:01:12.490> the<00:01:12.670> soil<00:01:13.090> you<00:01:13.810> can<00:01:14.020> actually

00:01:14.249 --> 00:01:14.259 
top half with the soil you can actually

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:18.149 
top half with the soil you can actually
treat<00:01:15.100> outside<00:01:15.759> the<00:01:16.090> system<00:01:16.420> with<00:01:17.259> fertilizer

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:18.159 
treat outside the system with fertilizer

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:20.670 
treat outside the system with fertilizer
for<00:01:18.670> really<00:01:19.360> pushing<00:01:19.750> the<00:01:20.140> growth<00:01:20.410> of

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:20.680 
for really pushing the growth of

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.510 
for really pushing the growth of
especially<00:01:21.430> your<00:01:21.820> bigger<00:01:22.180> fruiting<00:01:22.870> plants
