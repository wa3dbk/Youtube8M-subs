00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
work on it for a long time to get to

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.650 
work on it for a long time to get to
where<00:02:04.620> you<00:02:04.860> can<00:02:05.010> effortlessly<00:02:05.390> go<00:02:06.390> through

where you can effortlessly go through

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.450 
where you can effortlessly go through
that<00:02:06.840> and<00:02:07.080> once<00:02:07.320> you<00:02:07.470> could<00:02:07.620> do<00:02:07.740> that<00:02:07.950> then<00:02:08.310> you

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.020 

on<00:02:19.860> the<00:02:19.980> first<00:02:20.190> beat<00:02:20.370> of<00:02:20.400> the<00:02:20.550> second<00:02:20.910> measure

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
on the first beat of the second measure

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.490 
on the first beat of the second measure
when<00:02:21.330> it<00:02:21.420> gets<00:02:21.570> the<00:02:21.720> fifth<00:02:21.960> string<00:02:22.260> in<00:02:22.410> the

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.190 
when it gets the fifth string in the
bass<00:02:22.710> so<00:02:23.340> our<00:02:23.520> to<00:02:23.760> measure<00:02:23.970> a<00:02:24.240> bass<00:02:24.600> pattern<00:02:25.050> is

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
bass so our to measure a bass pattern is

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:31.790 
bass so our to measure a bass pattern is
actually<00:02:25.350> six<00:02:26.310> four<00:02:27.120> six<00:02:27.930> four<00:02:28.800> five<00:02:29.810> four<00:02:30.810> six

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
actually six four six four five four six

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.210 
actually six four six four five four six
four<00:02:32.730> and<00:02:33.410> when<00:02:34.410> you<00:02:34.560> go<00:02:34.680> to<00:02:34.710> the<00:02:34.830> fifth<00:02:35.010> string
