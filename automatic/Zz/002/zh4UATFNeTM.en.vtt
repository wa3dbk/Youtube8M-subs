device is at eighty-five percent or if
it's<00:05:28.770> a<00:05:28.830> ninety-five<00:05:29.340> percent<00:05:29.550> it's<00:05:29.850> hard<00:05:30.030> to

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:30.090 
it's a ninety-five percent it's hard to

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:32.390 
it's a ninety-five percent it's hard to
tell<00:05:30.270> the<00:05:30.360> difference<00:05:30.389> right<00:05:30.770> anyways<00:05:31.770> so

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 
tell the difference right anyways so

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.969 
tell the difference right anyways so
that's<00:05:32.940> basically<00:05:33.150> it<00:05:33.560> now<00:05:34.560> this<00:05:34.830> particular

fast<00:05:38.310> I'm<00:05:39.090> kind<00:05:39.479> of<00:05:39.570> digging<00:05:39.750> the<00:05:39.990> theming

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:40.350 
fast I'm kind of digging the theming

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:42.050 
fast I'm kind of digging the theming
although<00:05:40.560> I'm<00:05:40.680> not<00:05:40.710> sure<00:05:41.310> if<00:05:41.640> I'm<00:05:41.789> going<00:05:41.970> to

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:44.330 
although I'm not sure if I'm going to
stick<00:05:42.300> around<00:05:42.330> with<00:05:42.780> it<00:05:43.039> it's<00:05:44.039> almost<00:05:44.190> a

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:44.340 
stick around with it it's almost a

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:45.950 
stick around with it it's almost a
little<00:05:44.400> bit<00:05:44.610> too<00:05:44.760> heavy<00:05:45.030> for<00:05:45.360> me<00:05:45.510> personally

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960 
little bit too heavy for me personally
