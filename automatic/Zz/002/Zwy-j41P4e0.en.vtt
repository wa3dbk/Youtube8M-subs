00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.559
 Greetings to all this time I bring 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.969
 a video tutorial about the 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.969
 Turtle lighting 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.150
 not many know what I started 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.970
 without anything practically two weeks 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.550
 I was with an island tortuguero 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.690
 and later the control of 20 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.550
 liters a fish tank 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.859
 tortuguero after I did not like the 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.710
 heater that and I changed it for a 

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:48.280
 automatic thermostat and I was 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:50.710
 investigating a lot the last thing I could 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.829
 buy by the pocket then because they are 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.390
 many things to have a perfect kit 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:58.950
 for your possible turtle you have to 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:01.740
 invest easy about a thousand pesos 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:04.500
 and little by little you do it by putting together what 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:07.290
 last I had was the 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.780
 the lighting that many say no 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:13.290
 It is necessary that while you remove it 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.360
 in the sun they assimilate the calcium but 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.870
 the truth is that not every day are 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:22.200
 sunny and then it's cold and it's 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:25.580
 you need to have a lamp 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.290
 heat and a ray lamp 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.680
 you 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:33.380
 so that they digest and assimilate the 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:36.650
 calcium in their shells and they're in 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.730
 large structures grew up since 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.310
 I put the lighting 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:43.500
 now they have 7 months and see that they are 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.760
 very large bigger than any 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.760
 turtle of his age 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.010
 what I did was get into the forums 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.190
 from exo earth 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:57.410
 because I did not know if you do not know what 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.240
 do with your turtle I suggest you 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.910
 apart from watching videos on youtube there are 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.710
 others very good 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:05.960
 investigate what kind of 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:09.320
 lighting that focus is go to 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:12.800
 specialized pages and they will give them 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:15.560
 there are very useful tips I read a guide 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:20.090
 exo terra lighting guide 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:22.250
 completely and really the turtles like 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.810
 part of the reptiles do not need more 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.510
 illumination 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:30.560
 that's why the focus is 13 watts 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:33.170
 of a radiation is average 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:37.280
 we see that other types of reptiles use 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:39.110
 more power and more heat and another kind of 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.200
 conditions like desert but in 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.810
 this case 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.580
 this kind of animals do not and the lamp 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.580
 of the heat that I had already told you about 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.590
 50 watts to warm up well I 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.840
 I have at night because the 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.069
 palm trees I saw many things with that 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.850
 illumination 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:59.490
 Y 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:01.790
 Well basically that's all investigate 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:04.270
 look for him 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:07.990
 the lighting this 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:12.680
 of radiation uv-b is called reptil loud 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:16.130
 of 5.0 v is the level of radiation 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:19.190
 after a year of having 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:21.760
 with you that focus in use they have it 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.760
 what to change 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:28.120
 and then that would be everything here again is 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.790
 our good will be my turtles right now 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.220
 I just removed you style 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:36.700
 talking to them also about filtration 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:40.000
 It is very important that you have a filter 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.740
 quite powerful 4 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.650
 yes they can up to ten times bigger 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:47.290
 for your presents in this case I was 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:51.129
 this head of power that I have 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:54.159
 is for a fish tank of 400 to 500 liters and 

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:57.910
 If you see this fish tank then you will have about 85 

00:03:54.159 --> 00:04:01.560
 liters nothing more than water 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:04.520
 It's like about 130 liters in total 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.520
 this aquarium 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:11.400
 I do not need to make tubes or put bbc or 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:15.359
 make external filters like many others 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:19.530
 users keeps it very well every 

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:21.269
 week I change 25% of water right now 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:24.479
 I just changed it looks a little 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:27.760
 cloudy but in a short time it is clear not 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:30.250
 I had no problem the filter 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.430
 with very little society was cleaned every two 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.430
 weeks 

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:38.330
 of anti chlorine doubts that have 

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:41.330
 it really is not necessary if the water 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:43.860
 Chlorine flies 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:46.849
 and that would be all 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:49.119
 see you in another video 

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:49.119
 ah
