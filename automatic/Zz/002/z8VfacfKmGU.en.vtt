00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:12.190
 develop a video game for the 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.530
 mobile phone is pretty much like 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.599
 develop a video game for pc or for 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.400
 portable console you just have to have in 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:20.770
 account then the differences at the level of 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.110
 interface and the operating system that 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:25.270
 offer mobile phones years ago 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:27.580
 when we were still in the time of 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.980
 j2me with the first mobiles of nokia 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.660
 color that kind of thing looked like 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.489
 much to how they were programming the 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.739
 8-bit microcomputers because they were 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:38.199
 very little powerful systems with games in 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:40.780
 two very small dimensions as well 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:42.879
 say it today the power that has 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.650
 a mobile smartphone last generation 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:47.739
 it's practically the same as a 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:50.589
 xbox 360 with which then there is no need 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:52.720
 be chained by little memory or 

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:54.879
 because little power really a game 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:58.150
 mobile can be equally powerful equal 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:59.979
 of eye-catching that a years of war that a 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.180
 mass efect no there is no problem 

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:03.070
 On it 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.220
 design a video game for mobile 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:10.450
 it means thinking a lot about the audience 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:13.030
 goal is not the same the player more or 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.100
 less casual that plays on a mobile as 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:18.550
 better for 90 seconds for three 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:21.100
 short bursts of game and not 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.740
 He wants very complicated life than 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.090
 super hardcore gamer that is in front of 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.100
 the console and want an experience 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.020
 triple to also have to take into account 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.610
 unfortunately the systems of 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.590
 control in mobile phones and in 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.350
 the tablets are not very accurate 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.899
 we only have touch as interface 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.880
 main we just have to do 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:41.350
 very intuitive interfaces 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.479
 well, that limits the 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.130
 game possibilities at the level of 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:47.229
 interface and interaction level not to 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.030
 power level or graphics level 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:51.220
 for example with which you have to think 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.200
 a lot in this player who wants to be 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.360
 a little while playing a game that 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.300
 hook immediately you do not have to put 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.550
 a very long intro you do not have to put a 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.010
 argument 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.390
 very messy you do not have to put something that 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.920
 complicate life to a player because 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.050
 wants something a direct spice and a 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.610
 Easy to digest experience as well 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.950
 say it with which the games have 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.800
 to be simpler at that level more 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:16.140
 entertained in short bursts of 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.880
 time and thinking a lot about a player 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.510
 who wants to entertain himself with something 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.780
 very casual and very direct 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.489
 well what is the programming of a 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.470
 video game for mobile phones are three legs 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:30.560
 that are very clearly marked is a 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.569
 model that is model view driver 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.640
 so in these cases what we do 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:36.950
 is having on the one hand what is the 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.590
 game dynamics that would be what 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.629
 we would call the model after 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.849
 we would have the controller that what 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:46.640
 would do would it manage how are we going to 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:48.260
 represent that model on screen and 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.140
 after the views that would be all 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:54.379
 those icons drawings that of some 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:56.720
 way they will capture our video game in 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:58.730
 the mobile device to get the 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.280
 adaptation to those of the different 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.620
 touch screens and thanks to the model 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.950
 that we commented before the model seen 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:10.250
 controller what we do is that when 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:12.709
 we move a mobile phone in 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.500
 different positions automatically 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:17.389
 we can load different views that 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.829
 will be managed by the controller 

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:20.900
 so that if I put my phone in 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:24.319
 a vertical upward position 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:26.910
 we can load a certain view if 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:28.980
 I broken that monitor another view 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.080
 way I can go placing those 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.970
 icons that we mentioned before 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.680
 example in the case of apple are some 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.630
 views that are already predefined and 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.510
 that we can not modify 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:41.940
 I can represent both the buttons of 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.890
 action as the movement buttons in 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.990
 the screen position that I want what 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.360
 what is important is that logically the 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:50.220
 adaptation is easy because what is the 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.600
 code what is what is called the 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.420
 model can be totally 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:56.310
 invariable and it is the controller who in 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:59.610
 Function of the position of your device 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:02.100
 mobile because it adapts to all those icons in 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:03.690
 the graphic part to the position that most 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:06.600
 may interest you 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:09.330
 every mobile phone manufacturer has 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:12.630
 your own store your own way to 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:14.490
 distribute the games each of its 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:16.769
 father and his mother here every manufacturer 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:18.660
 has decided to go his way which 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:20.010
 because it makes things difficult for us 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:23.520
 when we can do videogames 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:25.950
 the worst case by far is the world 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.120
 of android where unfortunately there is no 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:29.790
 an android 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:32.280
 there are 400,000 and that means that 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:35.040
 you have to make 400 thousand versions 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.990
 different from your game and many times it's 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.610
 physically impossible for a company 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.760
 of development develop for all 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:43.500
 terminals in the market because no 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:44.790
 we can try it on all mobile phones 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.430
 we can try it on all tablets 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:48.960
 whereupon it is a distribution 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:51.360
 difficult to make versions 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.570
 specific for htc phones for 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:56.730
 samsung mobiles for Chinese mobiles 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:59.220
 it's hell when it comes to distributing and 

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:01.680
 then there is that in the case of android 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:04.050
 you simply upload your game to a system 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.830
 automated there is a robot it or a 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.230
 Program 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:09.600
 that verifies that the game is correct and 

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:11.310
 immediately upload it to the store in the 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.380
 case of the other major mobile market 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:16.200
 which is the apple is the opposite 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:18.210
 everything is very unified apple cares 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:21.380
 very much the developer much more than 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:23.600
 what google does for example and 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:24.710
 It makes everything very easy for both the teacher 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:27.080
 of testing the process of 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:28.850
 compatibilization all devices 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.230
 They are perfectly compatible between 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:32.900
 yes there is not much problem of 

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:34.670
 fragmentation and then distribute the 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:36.320
 game is much simpler besides apple 

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:38.240
 have a team of people in a 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.650
 entire building on its campus full of 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:41.270
 people who dedicate themselves to look at the 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:42.880
 quality controls of games with 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:45.800
 which if there is a problem then I will 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:47.060
 notify and is more is more like 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.720
 work with a console manufacturer 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:52.090
 what to make with a 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:54.940
 anonymous robot that you do not know very well if 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:56.440
 is accepting you because you are not 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:57.820
 accepting or doing something weird with 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:00.300
 your game in the middle that we can not 

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:00.300
 know very well
