different ways and what inspired me to

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.080 
different ways and what inspired me to
make<00:00:28.900> these<00:00:29.200> ones<00:00:29.560> was<00:00:30.009> a<00:00:30.040> video<00:00:30.340> I<00:00:30.369> saw<00:00:30.820> on

Grant<00:00:31.599> Thompson's<00:00:32.169> the<00:00:32.500> king<00:00:32.710> of<00:00:32.860> random

00:00:33.479 --> 00:00:33.489 
Grant Thompson's the king of random

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:36.810 
Grant Thompson's the king of random
channel<00:00:33.910> where<00:00:34.540> he<00:00:34.570> makes<00:00:34.920> gummy<00:00:35.920> Lego<00:00:36.280> blocks

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:36.820 
channel where he makes gummy Lego blocks

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.459 
channel where he makes gummy Lego blocks
and<00:00:37.239> I<00:00:37.420> thought<00:00:37.660> they<00:00:37.840> were<00:00:37.899> just<00:00:38.140> amazing

00:00:38.459 --> 00:00:38.469 
and I thought they were just amazing

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:40.709 
and I thought they were just amazing
they<00:00:38.800> turned<00:00:39.040> out<00:00:39.160> so<00:00:39.520> well<00:00:39.730> that<00:00:40.270> I<00:00:40.300> wanted<00:00:40.600> to

00:00:40.709 --> 00:00:40.719 
they turned out so well that I wanted to

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:42.510 
they turned out so well that I wanted to
use<00:00:40.899> his<00:00:41.140> recipe<00:00:41.649> so<00:00:42.100> that's<00:00:42.250> what<00:00:42.399> I'm<00:00:42.489> doing

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:42.520 
use his recipe so that's what I'm doing

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.270 
use his recipe so that's what I'm doing
here<00:00:43.149> I<00:00:43.300> put<00:00:43.899> half<00:00:44.050> a<00:00:44.230> cup<00:00:44.260> of<00:00:44.559> very<00:00:44.800> cold<00:00:45.040> water

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.280 
here I put half a cup of very cold water

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.430 
here I put half a cup of very cold water
in<00:00:45.550> a<00:00:45.640> measuring<00:00:45.969> cup<00:00:45.999> and<00:00:46.390> then<00:00:46.839> I<00:00:46.929> added<00:00:47.140> a

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:47.440 
in a measuring cup and then I added a

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.669 
in a measuring cup and then I added a
quarter<00:00:47.800> cup<00:00:48.129> of<00:00:48.160> white<00:00:49.030> corn<00:00:49.809> syrup<00:00:50.350> now

00:00:50.669 --> 00:00:50.679 
quarter cup of white corn syrup now

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:52.380 
quarter cup of white corn syrup now
apparently<00:00:51.039> the<00:00:51.190> corn<00:00:51.460> syrup<00:00:51.760> helps<00:00:52.030> make<00:00:52.210> the

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:52.390 
apparently the corn syrup helps make the

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.509 
apparently the corn syrup helps make the
candies<00:00:52.780> smoother<00:00:53.559> I'm<00:00:53.800> sure<00:00:54.309> there<00:00:54.489> are

00:00:54.509 --> 00:00:54.519 
candies smoother I'm sure there are

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:56.340 
candies smoother I'm sure there are
recipes<00:00:54.940> out<00:00:55.089> there<00:00:55.149> that<00:00:55.510> do<00:00:55.600> not<00:00:55.629> use<00:00:56.019> corn

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350 
recipes out there that do not use corn

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.439 
recipes out there that do not use corn
syrup<00:00:56.559> so<00:00:57.399> basically<00:00:57.789> you're<00:00:58.210> going<00:00:58.329> to

00:00:58.439 --> 00:00:58.449 
syrup so basically you're going to

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:00.450 
syrup so basically you're going to
combine<00:00:58.659> the<00:00:59.289> corn<00:00:59.559> syrup<00:00:59.739> with<00:00:59.949> the<00:00:59.980> water<00:01:00.249> by

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
combine the corn syrup with the water by

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.189 
combine the corn syrup with the water by
stirring<00:01:00.789> it<00:01:00.969> together<00:01:01.300> and<00:01:01.539> you'll<00:01:01.989> know

00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:02.199 
stirring it together and you'll know

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:04.560 
stirring it together and you'll know
it's<00:01:02.409> completely<00:01:02.920> dissolved<00:01:03.429> when<00:01:03.850> the<00:01:04.330> water

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
it's completely dissolved when the water

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.200 
it's completely dissolved when the water
becomes<00:01:05.019> clear<00:01:05.470> again<00:01:05.940> then<00:01:06.940> you're<00:01:07.060> going<00:01:07.150> to

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
becomes clear again then you're going to

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:08.340 
becomes clear again then you're going to
take<00:01:07.360> this<00:01:07.510> mixture<00:01:07.750> and<00:01:08.080> you're<00:01:08.140> going<00:01:08.290> to

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
take this mixture and you're going to

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.010 
take this mixture and you're going to
pour<00:01:08.530> it<00:01:08.650> into<00:01:08.770> a<00:01:09.370> small<00:01:10.090> saucepan<00:01:10.390> on<00:01:10.960> the

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
pour it into a small saucepan on the

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.990 
pour it into a small saucepan on the
stove<00:01:11.229> now<00:01:11.740> don't<00:01:12.010> turn<00:01:12.220> the<00:01:12.400> heat<00:01:12.580> on<00:01:12.610> quite

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
stove now don't turn the heat on quite

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.410 
stove now don't turn the heat on quite

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.510 
medium low and you're going to be able
to<00:01:56.109> heat<00:01:56.229> the<00:01:56.380> mixture<00:01:56.560> stirring<00:01:57.130> every

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
to heat the mixture stirring every

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.080 
to heat the mixture stirring every
minute<00:01:57.909> or<00:01:58.060> two<00:01:58.859> for<00:01:59.859> about<00:02:00.130> ten<00:02:00.549> minutes

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
minute or two for about ten minutes

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.660 
minute or two for about ten minutes
heating<00:02:02.020> very<00:02:02.289> slowly<00:02:02.770> and<00:02:03.100> stirring<00:02:03.549> until

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
heating very slowly and stirring until

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.779 
heating very slowly and stirring until
all<00:02:04.270> the<00:02:04.659> gelatin<00:02:04.869> is<00:02:05.229> dissolved<00:02:05.259> and<00:02:05.950> at<00:02:06.670> this

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:06.789 
all the gelatin is dissolved and at this

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:08.249 
all the gelatin is dissolved and at this
point<00:02:07.000> you<00:02:07.149> shouldn't<00:02:07.420> have<00:02:07.539> any<00:02:07.689> more<00:02:07.719> lumps

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
point you shouldn't have any more lumps

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.499 
point you shouldn't have any more lumps
in<00:02:08.500> there<00:02:08.710> now<00:02:09.550> it'll<00:02:09.759> become<00:02:09.910> kind<00:02:10.330> of<00:02:10.450> a

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
in there now it'll become kind of a

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.180 
in there now it'll become kind of a
liquid<00:02:10.690> and<00:02:11.080> it'll<00:02:11.320> get<00:02:11.530> a<00:02:11.560> little<00:02:11.800> bit<00:02:11.920> more

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
liquid and it'll get a little bit more

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.030 
liquid and it'll get a little bit more
clear<00:02:12.940> once<00:02:13.690> you<00:02:13.810> get<00:02:13.960> to<00:02:14.080> that<00:02:14.200> point<00:02:14.530> pour<00:02:14.980> it

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
clear once you get to that point pour it

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.160 
clear once you get to that point pour it
into<00:02:15.160> a<00:02:15.340> drinking<00:02:15.610> glass<00:02:15.940> let<00:02:16.780> it<00:02:16.900> sit<00:02:17.140> for

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
into a drinking glass let it sit for

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.500 
into a drinking glass let it sit for
about<00:02:17.290> ten<00:02:17.650> or<00:02:17.680> fifteen<00:02:17.920> minutes<00:02:18.310> and<00:02:18.730> then

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
about ten or fifteen minutes and then

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.199 
about ten or fifteen minutes and then
you<00:02:19.960> can<00:02:19.990> just<00:02:20.320> skim<00:02:21.070> off<00:02:21.250> the<00:02:21.550> stuff<00:02:22.000> that's

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
you can just skim off the stuff that's

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:23.369 
you can just skim off the stuff that's
floated<00:02:22.629> to<00:02:22.720> the<00:02:22.750> surface

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:23.379 
floated to the surface

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:25.350 
floated to the surface
that'll<00:02:24.010> be<00:02:24.129> all<00:02:24.280> the<00:02:24.430> gelatin<00:02:25.030> that<00:02:25.060> didn't

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
that'll be all the gelatin that didn't

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.059 
that'll be all the gelatin that didn't
dissolve<00:02:25.659> and<00:02:25.870> all<00:02:26.290> the<00:02:26.500> bubbles<00:02:26.650> that<00:02:26.890> might

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
dissolve and all the bubbles that might

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:27.600 
dissolve and all the bubbles that might
be<00:02:27.250> in<00:02:27.340> the

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
be in the

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.450 
be in the
mr.<00:02:27.850> just<00:02:28.540> scoop<00:02:28.930> it<00:02:29.050> out<00:02:29.170> and<00:02:29.410> then<00:02:29.890> pour<00:02:30.190> this

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:30.460 
mr. just scoop it out and then pour this

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.000 
mr. just scoop it out and then pour this
into<00:02:30.730> a<00:02:31.240> condiment<00:02:31.900> bottle<00:02:32.230> if<00:02:32.380> you'd<00:02:32.560> like<00:02:32.800> it

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
into a condiment bottle if you'd like it

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.730 
into a condiment bottle if you'd like it
just<00:02:33.160> makes<00:02:33.370> it<00:02:33.490> easier<00:02:33.850> to<00:02:33.910> pour<00:02:34.440> now<00:02:35.440> you<00:02:35.500> can

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740 
just makes it easier to pour now you can

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.680 
just makes it easier to pour now you can
use<00:02:35.890> whatever<00:02:36.040> you<00:02:36.370> want<00:02:36.730> as<00:02:36.910> a<00:02:36.940> mold<00:02:37.360> this<00:02:37.630> is

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
use whatever you want as a mold this is

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.480 
use whatever you want as a mold this is
an<00:02:37.930> ice<00:02:38.080> cube<00:02:38.350> mold<00:02:38.650> that<00:02:38.800> I<00:02:38.890> received<00:02:39.250> in<00:02:39.400> a

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.490 
an ice cube mold that I received in a

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.640 
an ice cube mold that I received in a
loot<00:02:39.760> crate<00:02:39.790> and<00:02:40.300> it<00:02:40.450> is<00:02:40.570> Marvel<00:02:41.020> characters

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
loot crate and it is Marvel characters

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.380 
loot crate and it is Marvel characters
so<00:02:41.830> I<00:02:41.890> thought<00:02:42.100> I<00:02:42.130> would<00:02:42.310> give<00:02:42.550> this<00:02:42.730> one<00:02:42.970> a<00:02:43.030> try

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
so I thought I would give this one a try

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.050 
so I thought I would give this one a try
and<00:02:43.830> you<00:02:44.830> just<00:02:44.980> basically<00:02:45.130> fill<00:02:45.670> up<00:02:45.790> the<00:02:45.910> mold

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
and you just basically fill up the mold

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.540 
and you just basically fill up the mold
now<00:02:46.810> the<00:02:47.230> gelatin<00:02:47.590> has<00:02:47.650> a<00:02:47.800> tendency<00:02:48.190> to<00:02:48.310> shrink

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
now the gelatin has a tendency to shrink

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.240 
now the gelatin has a tendency to shrink
a<00:02:48.610> little<00:02:48.730> bit<00:02:48.880> as<00:02:49.410> it<00:02:50.410> solidifies<00:02:50.920> so<00:02:51.160> you

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
a little bit as it solidifies so you

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:52.680 
a little bit as it solidifies so you
might<00:02:51.430> want<00:02:51.700> to<00:02:51.760> fill<00:02:51.940> it<00:02:52.030> right<00:02:52.300> up<00:02:52.360> to<00:02:52.600> the

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
might want to fill it right up to the

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.810 
might want to fill it right up to the
top<00:02:52.900> I<00:02:53.140> tried<00:02:53.800> these<00:02:53.950> little<00:02:54.220> mini<00:02:54.430> muffin

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 
top I tried these little mini muffin

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.670 
top I tried these little mini muffin
tins<00:02:55.060> I<00:02:55.360> tried<00:02:55.720> these<00:02:55.900> little<00:02:56.200> gingerbread

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
tins I tried these little gingerbread

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.870 
tins I tried these little gingerbread
men<00:02:57.100> mold<00:02:57.490> and<00:02:57.730> I<00:02:58.330> have<00:02:58.570> a<00:02:58.780> pile<00:02:59.230> of<00:02:59.590> candy<00:03:00.490> melt

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
men mold and I have a pile of candy melt

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.340 
men mold and I have a pile of candy melt
molds<00:03:01.210> oh<00:03:01.270> these<00:03:01.420> are<00:03:01.600> for<00:03:01.780> molding<00:03:02.140> chocolate

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
molds oh these are for molding chocolate

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.260 
molds oh these are for molding chocolate
but<00:03:03.130> I<00:03:03.160> thought<00:03:03.370> I<00:03:03.520> would<00:03:03.670> give<00:03:03.820> these<00:03:03.940> a<00:03:04.000> try

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.270 
but I thought I would give these a try

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.390 
but I thought I would give these a try
out<00:03:04.360> as<00:03:04.750> well<00:03:05.110> and<00:03:05.500> what<00:03:05.860> I<00:03:05.890> did<00:03:06.100> with<00:03:06.220> these

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
out as well and what I did with these

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.010 
out as well and what I did with these
because<00:03:06.850> they're<00:03:07.060> not<00:03:07.180> flexible<00:03:07.450> like<00:03:07.930> the

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 
because they're not flexible like the

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.290 
because they're not flexible like the
silicone<00:03:08.320> molds<00:03:08.920> I<00:03:09.070> lightly<00:03:09.640> sprayed<00:03:10.120> them

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300 
silicone molds I lightly sprayed them

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.510 
silicone molds I lightly sprayed them
with<00:03:10.330> cooking<00:03:10.750> spray<00:03:10.930> before<00:03:11.410> filling<00:03:12.400> them

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:12.520 
with cooking spray before filling them

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.850 
with cooking spray before filling them
so<00:03:12.730> that<00:03:12.880> they<00:03:12.970> would<00:03:13.090> come<00:03:13.300> out<00:03:13.330> easier<00:03:13.959> then

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
so that they would come out easier then

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.180 
so that they would come out easier then
you're<00:03:15.010> going<00:03:15.100> to<00:03:15.160> let<00:03:15.370> these<00:03:15.580> sit<00:03:15.850> for<00:03:17.190> about

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
you're going to let these sit for about

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.390 
you're going to let these sit for about
four<00:03:19.000> or<00:03:19.270> five<00:03:19.660> hours<00:03:20.440> probably<00:03:20.830> overnight

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
four or five hours probably overnight

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.090 
four or five hours probably overnight
would<00:03:21.580> be<00:03:21.760> best<00:03:22.090> and<00:03:22.480> you<00:03:23.140> can<00:03:23.290> see<00:03:23.440> all<00:03:23.620> the

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
would be best and you can see all the

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.040 
would be best and you can see all the
different<00:03:24.220> ones<00:03:24.580> that<00:03:24.670> I<00:03:24.760> made<00:03:25.060> and<00:03:25.330> I<00:03:25.600> did<00:03:25.810> all

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.050 
different ones that I made and I did all

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:28.860 
different ones that I made and I did all
six<00:03:26.500> colors<00:03:26.950> of<00:03:27.130> the<00:03:27.910> rainbow<00:03:28.120> with<00:03:28.630> six

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
six colors of the rainbow with six

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.480 
six colors of the rainbow with six
different<00:03:28.990> packages<00:03:29.590> of<00:03:29.740> jell-o<00:03:29.950> just<00:03:30.340> by

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:30.490 
different packages of jell-o just by

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:33.300 
different packages of jell-o just by
following<00:03:30.940> the<00:03:31.120> same<00:03:31.300> procedure<00:03:31.780> I<00:03:32.170> let<00:03:33.100> mine

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
following the same procedure I let mine

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.280 
following the same procedure I let mine
sit<00:03:33.340> at<00:03:33.790> room<00:03:33.820> temperature<00:03:34.000> for<00:03:34.480> about<00:03:34.930> four

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
sit at room temperature for about four

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.170 
sit at room temperature for about four
or<00:03:35.320> five<00:03:35.920> hours<00:03:36.190> and<00:03:36.790> you'll<00:03:36.910> know<00:03:37.150> that
