I'm<00:01:21.600> Kansas<00:01:22.080> discovered<00:01:22.560> that<00:01:22.620> his<00:01:22.740> radio

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
I'm Kansas discovered that his radio

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.160 
I'm Kansas discovered that his radio

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
frequency generator could release the

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.170 
frequency generator could release the
oxygen<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.830> hydrogen<00:01:26.010> from<00:01:26.460> salt<00:01:26.790> water<00:01:26.850> and

oxygen and hydrogen from salt water and

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.170 
oxygen and hydrogen from salt water and
create<00:01:27.840> an<00:01:28.020> incredibly<00:01:28.590> intense<00:01:29.070> flame<00:01:29.460> just

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
create an incredibly intense flame just
