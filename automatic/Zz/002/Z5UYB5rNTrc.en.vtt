done with this again it looks beautiful
it's<00:01:52.470> big<00:01:52.829> if<00:01:53.490> you<00:01:54.060> can't<00:01:54.299> get<00:01:54.509> two<00:01:54.780> monitors

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
it's big if you can't get two monitors

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.639 
it's big if you can't get two monitors
and<00:01:55.649> if<00:01:55.740> you<00:01:55.860> can<00:01:56.040> only<00:01:56.130> get<00:01:56.340> one<00:01:56.610> this<00:01:57.509> is<00:01:57.780> one

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
and if you can only get one this is one

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.380
