thin it's pretty lights but a little
over<00:00:38.550> three<00:00:38.910> pounds<00:00:39.980> it<00:00:40.980> is<00:00:41.309> very<00:00:41.610> high

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
over three pounds it is very high

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.569 
over three pounds it is very high
performance<00:00:42.840> and<00:00:43.050> it<00:00:43.200> does<00:00:43.440> that<00:00:43.800> because<00:00:44.160> it

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
performance and it does that because it

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:50.020 
performance and it does that because it
is<00:00:44.760> equipped<00:00:45.600> with<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:46.379> an<00:00:47.090> AMD<00:00:48.090> dual<00:00:49.050> core

Athlon<00:00:51.030> 64<00:00:51.390> bit<00:00:51.930> processor<00:00:51.960> I<00:00:52.620> think<00:00:52.920> it's

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
Athlon 64 bit processor I think it's

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.810 
Athlon 64 bit processor I think it's
going<00:00:53.250> to<00:00:53.280> point<00:00:53.699> to<00:00:53.820> gigahertz<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:55.820> it's

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
going to point to gigahertz and it's

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.080 
going to point to gigahertz and it's
also<00:00:57.000> coupled<00:00:57.600> that<00:00:57.780> with<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:58.379> ATI<00:00:58.829> Radeon

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.090 
also coupled that with the ATI Radeon

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.450 
also coupled that with the ATI Radeon
graphics<00:01:00.500> which<00:01:01.500> means<00:01:01.800> that<00:01:02.039> it<00:01:02.190> does<00:01:02.430> a

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
graphics which means that it does a

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.609 
graphics which means that it does a
pretty<00:01:02.940> decent<00:01:03.000> job<00:01:03.600> for<00:01:04.080> an<00:01:04.140> ultra<00:01:04.379> portable

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
pretty decent job for an ultra portable

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:14.050 
pretty decent job for an ultra portable

anyway let's take a quick tour around

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.580 
anyway let's take a quick tour around
because<00:01:34.680> you<00:01:34.829> got<00:01:35.040> a<00:01:35.070> lot<00:01:35.340> of<00:01:36.229> ports<00:01:37.229> on<00:01:37.409> the

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
because you got a lot of ports on the

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.490 
because you got a lot of ports on the
side<00:01:37.860> we<00:01:38.579> have<00:01:39.380> over<00:01:40.380> here<00:01:40.740> two<00:01:41.400> USBs<00:01:42.329> audio<00:01:43.110> in

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
side we have over here two USBs audio in

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.179 
side we have over here two USBs audio in
and<00:01:43.680> out<00:01:43.890> and<00:01:44.310> then<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.360> power<00:01:45.570> jack<00:01:46.159> as<00:01:47.159> well

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
and out and then the power jack as well

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.749 
and out and then the power jack as well
as<00:01:47.700> an<00:01:47.850> Ethernet<00:01:48.360> port<00:01:48.619> in<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:50.159> little<00:01:50.430> slide

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.639 
as an Ethernet port in the little slide
there<00:01:51.180> then<00:01:51.750> over<00:01:52.020> here<00:01:52.460> we<00:01:53.460> have<00:01:53.759> another<00:01:54.649> USB

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
there then over here we have another USB

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.620 
there then over here we have another USB
port<00:01:56.100> then<00:01:56.759> over<00:01:57.000> here<00:01:57.030> we've<00:01:57.390> got<00:01:57.420> a

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630

that but this is clearly delineated so

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:52.399 
that but this is clearly delineated so
that<00:03:50.040> you<00:03:50.190> can<00:03:50.400> see<00:03:50.729> exactly<00:03:51.120> where<00:03:51.810> it<00:03:51.930> ends

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:52.409

that you can see exactly where it ends
and<00:03:53.340> begins<00:03:55.280> it's<00:03:56.280> also<00:03:56.489> got<00:03:56.819> one<00:03:57.239> single

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:01.889 
giant button which I really don't like

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:03.830 
giant button which I really don't like
although<00:04:02.519> I<00:04:02.549> have<00:04:02.819> to<00:04:02.849> admit<00:04:03.180> this<00:04:03.419> one<00:04:03.659> is

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
although I have to admit this one is

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.659 
although I have to admit this one is
pretty<00:04:04.489> clear<00:04:05.489> left<00:04:06.060> and<00:04:06.389> right<00:04:07.370> for<00:04:08.370> left<00:04:08.549> and

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:08.669 
pretty clear left and right for left and

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:13.219 
pretty clear left and right for left and
right<00:04:08.759> click<00:04:11.030> so<00:04:12.030> it<00:04:12.269> works<00:04:12.509> better<00:04:12.780> than<00:04:12.900> most

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:13.229 
right click so it works better than most

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:15.339 
right click so it works better than most
of<00:04:13.470> those<00:04:13.650> but<00:04:14.009> normally<00:04:14.430> I<00:04:14.459> don't<00:04:14.729> like<00:04:14.939> that

00:04:15.339 --> 00:04:15.349 
of those but normally I don't like that

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:20.569 
of those but normally I don't like that
