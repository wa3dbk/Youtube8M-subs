problem Jen what are we what are we what
did<00:00:46.590> we<00:00:46.680> fix<00:00:46.860> here<00:00:47.100> we<00:00:47.760> fixed<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.120> tire

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
did we fix here we fixed the tire

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.270 
did we fix here we fixed the tire
pressure<00:00:48.629> on<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.140> on<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.890> mower

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
pressure on the on the mower

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.520 
pressure on the on the mower
we<00:00:50.940> had<00:00:51.030> a<00:00:51.090> big<00:00:51.270> discrepancy<00:00:51.570> entire<00:00:52.289> pressure

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
we had a big discrepancy entire pressure

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.950 
we had a big discrepancy entire pressure
one<00:00:52.949> tire<00:00:53.820> looked<00:00:54.149> like<00:00:54.300> it<00:00:54.449> was<00:00:54.570> on<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.780> verge

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
one tire looked like it was on the verge

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.600 
one tire looked like it was on the verge
of<00:00:55.079> being<00:00:55.320> flat<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.770> other<00:00:55.920> one<00:00:56.100> had<00:00:56.309> pressure

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
of being flat the other one had pressure

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:57.860 
of being flat the other one had pressure
that<00:00:56.850> was<00:00:56.969> too<00:00:57.210> high

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
that was too high

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.130 
that was too high
so<00:00:58.410> use<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.800> fix-a-flat<00:00:59.399> on<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.850> one<00:01:00.000> tire<00:01:00.329> to

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
so use the fix-a-flat on the one tire to

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.280 
so use the fix-a-flat on the one tire to
get<00:01:01.320> it<00:01:01.559> filled<00:01:02.489> back<00:01:02.760> up<00:01:02.969> to<00:01:03.149> 20<00:01:03.510> psi<00:01:03.690> which<00:01:04.170> is

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
get it filled back up to 20 psi which is

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.719 
get it filled back up to 20 psi which is
where<00:01:04.470> it<00:01:04.530> should<00:01:04.710> be<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.070> other<00:01:05.220> tire<00:01:05.489> was

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
where it should be the other tire was

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.600 
where it should be the other tire was
registering<00:01:06.240> 24<00:01:06.840> psi<00:01:07.350> so<00:01:07.979> he<00:01:08.040> took<00:01:08.189> some<00:01:08.250> arrow

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
registering 24 psi so he took some arrow

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.990 
registering 24 psi so he took some arrow
that's<00:01:08.939> or<00:01:09.270> even<00:01:09.689> out<00:01:09.869> 20<00:01:10.260> psi<00:01:10.640> fix<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.790> flat

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
that's or even out 20 psi fix the flat

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.190 
that's or even out 20 psi fix the flat
Mysteria<00:01:12.720> should<00:01:12.960> be<00:01:13.549> very<00:01:14.549> improved<00:01:14.939> now

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
Mysteria should be very improved now

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.859 
Mysteria should be very improved now
great<00:01:16.200> great<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:17.009> what<00:01:17.970> did<00:01:18.119> you<00:01:18.240> use<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:18.689> fill

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
great great and what did you use to fill

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.450 
great great and what did you use to fill
up<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.110> tars<00:01:20.150> ah<00:01:21.150> well<00:01:22.049> we<00:01:22.229> fixed<00:01:22.650> flat<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:23.189> fix

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
up the tars ah well we fixed flat to fix

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.820 
up the tars ah well we fixed flat to fix
the<00:01:23.640> one<00:01:23.790> and<00:01:24.030> then<00:01:24.119> we<00:01:24.240> use<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.689> jump<00:01:25.200> box<00:01:25.409> to

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
the one and then we use the jump box to

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.330 
the one and then we use the jump box to
to<00:01:26.250> get<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.240> air<00:01:27.390> filled<00:01:28.140> up<00:01:28.350> in<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:29.100> tar<00:01:29.310> that

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
to get the air filled up in the tar that

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.210 
to get the air filled up in the tar that
we<00:01:29.820> saw<00:01:30.119> what<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.869> jump<00:01:31.350> box<00:01:31.530> has<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.040> air

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
we saw what the jump box has the air

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.440 
we saw what the jump box has the air
compressor<00:01:32.700> built<00:01:32.909> in<00:01:33.060> yes<00:01:33.450> pretty<00:01:33.960> handy<00:01:34.290> huh

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.930 
turn easily but sometimes they don't the
problem<00:02:09.979> is<00:02:10.130> that<00:02:10.489> this<00:02:11.480> plastic<00:02:12.170> bearing

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
problem is that this plastic bearing

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.460 
problem is that this plastic bearing
that<00:02:13.940> is<00:02:14.150> internal<00:02:14.510> here<00:02:14.870> it's<00:02:15.019> a<00:02:15.080> plastic

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
that is internal here it's a plastic

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.570 
that is internal here it's a plastic
sleeve<00:02:15.739> bearing<00:02:16.220> is<00:02:16.959> too<00:02:17.959> narrow<00:02:18.560> for<00:02:18.950> this

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
sleeve bearing is too narrow for this

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.970 
sleeve bearing is too narrow for this
spindle<00:02:19.910> to<00:02:20.209> pass<00:02:20.390> through<00:02:20.750> and<00:02:20.959> the<00:02:21.560> spindle

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
spindle to pass through and the spindle

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.509 
spindle to pass through and the spindle
10<00:02:22.190> tends<00:02:22.610> to<00:02:22.819> get<00:02:22.910> locked<00:02:23.239> up<00:02:23.620> so<00:02:24.620> the<00:02:25.130> fix<00:02:25.430> for

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:25.519 
10 tends to get locked up so the fix for

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:28.809 
10 tends to get locked up so the fix for
that<00:02:25.670> at<00:02:26.209> least<00:02:26.420> my<00:02:26.690> fix<00:02:27.049> for<00:02:27.200> that<00:02:27.230> is<00:02:27.819> to

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 
that at least my fix for that is to

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:32.080 
that at least my fix for that is to
remove<00:02:29.180> the<00:02:30.049> spindle<00:02:30.400> take<00:02:31.400> off<00:02:31.580> this<00:02:31.790> bolt

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
remove the spindle take off this bolt

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.550 
remove the spindle take off this bolt
the<00:02:32.750> caster<00:02:33.230> will<00:02:33.349> fall<00:02:33.560> away<00:02:35.290> get<00:02:36.290> a<00:02:36.319> three

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
the caster will fall away get a three

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.770 
the caster will fall away get a three
quarter<00:02:36.920> inch<00:02:36.950> spade<00:02:37.370> bit<00:02:37.400> a<00:02:37.910> three<00:02:38.420> quarter

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
quarter inch spade bit a three quarter

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.970 
quarter inch spade bit a three quarter
inch<00:02:38.810> spade<00:02:39.410> bit<00:02:39.440> and<00:02:40.269> once<00:02:41.269> you<00:02:41.420> have<00:02:41.980> the

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
inch spade bit and once you have the

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.789 
inch spade bit and once you have the
spindle<00:02:43.370> out<00:02:43.489> run<00:02:44.269> that<00:02:44.420> spade<00:02:44.690> bit<00:02:44.799> directly

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:45.799 
spindle out run that spade bit directly

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:49.660 
spindle out run that spade bit directly
down<00:02:46.040> one<00:02:46.850> pass<00:02:47.090> in<00:02:47.510> and<00:02:48.109> out<00:02:48.859> and<00:02:49.069> you'll<00:02:49.430> pull

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
down one pass in and out and you'll pull

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.569 
down one pass in and out and you'll pull
out<00:02:49.700> some<00:02:50.060> plastic<00:02:50.540> not<00:02:50.780> too<00:02:50.989> much<00:02:51.200> and<00:02:51.579> one

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:52.579 
out some plastic not too much and one

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:55.120 
out some plastic not too much and one
pass<00:02:52.850> is<00:02:53.150> typically<00:02:53.480> all<00:02:53.690> you<00:02:53.840> need<00:02:54.049> and<00:02:55.040> then

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
pass is typically all you need and then

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:56.380 
pass is typically all you need and then
put<00:02:55.340> the<00:02:55.430> assembly<00:02:55.790> back<00:02:55.940> together<00:02:56.150> and

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
put the assembly back together and

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.390 
put the assembly back together and
you'll<00:02:56.480> find<00:02:56.660> the<00:02:56.750> wheels<00:02:56.930> will<00:02:57.140> spin<00:02:57.400> very

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
you'll find the wheels will spin very

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.000 
you'll find the wheels will spin very
well<00:02:58.639> and<00:02:58.850> you'll<00:02:59.420> track<00:02:59.630> a<00:02:59.660> lot<00:02:59.870> easier<00:03:00.290> but

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
well and you'll track a lot easier but

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.069 
well and you'll track a lot easier but
it's<00:03:01.190> those<00:03:01.430> front<00:03:01.970> wheel<00:03:02.180> spindles<00:03:02.690> and<00:03:02.870> the

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:03.079 
it's those front wheel spindles and the
