00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:06.279
 Now that you are welcome, thanks for 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.559
 the tune on this occasion I bring what 

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:11.350
 that in the last work of tron that is 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:13.420
 the custom rom bazan android 4.4 point 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:15.700
 two tracks for this terminal the 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.590
 samsung galaxy s3 of 9,300 we are 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.300
 testing two days and it really goes very 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:20.830
 alright so I recommend that the 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.660
 download and try it as long as 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.030
 do the backup of your fs folder is 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.910
 also your android backup is rom 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:29.920
 called investment tax 3 for this 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.810
 terminal that is being this Rome 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.390
 comes completely clean it does not bring 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:37.300
 additional functions only brings what 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.039
 that the optimal functions so that 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.050
 work properly terminal other 

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:44.710
 Hercules of the s5 but we can install it 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:46.420
 by means of a mod that can 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.190
 find what are the videos of 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.629
 our community but I will show you a 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.949
 little about what is being 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:53.170
 can see here we have what is the 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:54.489
 totally clean launcher not as well 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.139
 I told them bring us what is the widget 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:58.569
 let's keep pressing the screen 

00:00:56.139 --> 00:01:00.579
 let's enter the widgets if what 

00:00:58.569 --> 00:01:03.839
 they want to install with a light is a 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:06.250
 excellent option since it is simple but and 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:08.050
 minimalist as you can see here very 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.550
 good what you take care of really I what 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:11.650
 I use a lot what has been 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.910
 pure android versions since I do not 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.740
 overload what has been the 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:17.530
 memory like what are the widgets of the 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.160
 s5 or the dlc 4 or the personaciÃ³n del 2 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.780
 guys 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.870
 let's see what are the funds coming 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:25.300
 countless wallpapers that 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:28.090
 that have added to this rom we 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:30.190
 you can see they are really very very 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.380
 very nice 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.510
 all this we can customize it as 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.860
 we want , we are going to select it 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:39.840
 one define 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.820
 and you can see here we have what is the 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.430
 customization without adding we enter 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.580
 to what is still the status bar 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.320
 like having the milk doubles 5 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:51.570
 also brings the function of ultra savings 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.150
 of energy also saving energy 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.390
 that we have in the android versions 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:02:00.580
 that we have seen 4.3 but I also know 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.530
 leave this new version of android 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.510
 these are the functions that the 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.000
 it also brings what is the box of 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.380
 tools we will access as they can 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.600
 see here we have the applications with 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.890
 shortcuts if we want to modify or 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.470
 add some function only 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.150
 we drag and we give you are to edit that 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.680
 will open what has been what 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.030
 are the applications that we can add 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.400
 there we can add what has been 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.930
 the music we give you save and we go to 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.970
 open as you can see here I get the 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.440
 music funding if we enter what 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.420
 which is case of word applications not 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.940
 we can notice that it comes completely 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.580
 empty what is of applications that 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.320
 you can add the ones in another rom to this one 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.570
 as I told you that this rom comes 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.280
 completely clean comes with the 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:41.920
 functions necessary for its performance 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.709
 since this can be or start as 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.930
 less than 600 megs and really it 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.340
 will be a little more fluid to the terminal 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.190
 since it does not come with features that do not 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.900
 we want or come by default from the area 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.850
 as you can see here we have what 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:58.510
 is the necessary applications 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:02.010
 the most used the psm 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:04.980
 as an administrator for the battery 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.269
 we can select what they are in the 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.329
 which are the applications here that 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:12.060
 we can put to hibernate let's see what 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:14.069
 that is being in the adjustments that we 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.560
 adjust as you can see the change what 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:20.250
 comes being the icons of the 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.750
 personalization we focus what is 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.550
 what is being about me 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.860
 device in the screen lock 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:29.670
 they only come with two effects that the 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:31.770
 Undulating effect and light effect but 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.780
 they can also modify or add it 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:36.570
 that are another effect this rom we can 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:39.690
 use for a base rom to install 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:41.940
 what's been the mods for the 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.370
 s5 if we want to customize it much more 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:47.600
 let's go where it says more let's 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:49.430
 give him about the device 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:53.000
 can not observe since we have between 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:54.800
 4 points 4.2 kitkat this terminal number 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.480
 of the compilation we have to pay and 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.910
 version 3 is a job that has done 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.910
 s trump for 3 so all 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:03.380
 copyright for him also he 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:04.880
 We thank you because we do not always 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.440
 facilitates what has been the rom of 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:09.080
 first hand to approve in this 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:11.060
 community and I recommend this rom for 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.890
 that you can try it on your terminal and 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.180
 how are we going to see what is being the 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:17.220
 camera 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.480
 the camera works correctly I do not 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.430
 I had no problem 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:24.100
 this that I have restarted the finish 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.970
 once in three days and I have not had 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.760
 no problem 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.020
 a curious close or some other some 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.640
 another problem with the rom 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.560
 but for daily use it works 

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:34.240
 correctly what what is being 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.310
 this rice in the battery aspect 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.840
 that many of us are interested let me tell you 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:40.360
 which is one of the rom that I have tried that 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.220
 it has more optimized what has been 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.850
 of the battery part since this one 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:47.950
 is the load this material is used 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:51.070
 like it's six hours six or seven 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:53.110
 hours but with a lot of work and the 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:55.870
 terminal has rendered me correctly no 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.760
 I was downloaded quickly so in the 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:00.110
 section the battery is red is one of 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.760
 the best I've tried 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:03.500
 as well I said well English is 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:05.780
 We can use it as a rom 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:08.570
 base also the form used for use 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:10.430
 daily as it comes if not the 

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:12.830
 we want to personalize more also brings 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:14.600
 the energy saving mode that 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.100
 disable the radio and put the screen 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:18.380
 in black and white that we can also 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:20.600
 try and it works very well I have 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:22.670
 tested in this custom roll party 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:24.860
 application of music because we have 

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:28.250
 what is the same as we have seen 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:30.140
 we 're always going to leave you this does not bring the 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:32.690
 configuration of the s5 in what is the 

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:35.060
 white the visual aspect of the player 

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:36.560
 of the s5 but it really works 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:38.450
 correctly if we can see what they are 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:41.630
 the folders that it brings now that 

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:43.790
 incorporated into the s5 and really 

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:45.080
 the rom is very good, this is what 

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:47.540
