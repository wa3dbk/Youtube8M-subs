00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:43.060

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:45.010
 a small size where it's for the decoration 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.790
 and sadi lexington and that's where 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.910
 I live 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:53.340
 my parents live or play I lived 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:58.239
 for most of life and that's 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:04:02.049
 so it's to put in like deco 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:05.680
 here and it's very close olic so that 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:08.170
 that's all for what my 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:13.329
 parents were giving me level of this 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:15.940
 that was given to me by xx before 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:17.769
 will doubt come to lexington because they 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.680
 were here for a few days to 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:23.440
 meet my parents and it was a 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.920
 good experience but before that to new 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:29.350
 york 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:33.220
 he invited me to ballet and it was too much 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:36.040
 all too well we had it with a dinner 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:40.840
 extraordinary it was a perfect one because 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:44.410
 that for me I want I have what I jeans 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:46.840
 hosting I do not want anything so for 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:49.420
 me the experiences are super expensive my 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:53.920
 body then I prefer them instead of 

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:56.800
 gifts here and it was the same 

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:57.480
 reason that my parents are just 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.730
 Something 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:03.700
 that's because being together is 

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:05.590
 more important to us then that's it 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.360
 everything for this little beast to the point that 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:10.919
