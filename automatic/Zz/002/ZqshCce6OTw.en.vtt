 255 and asked in a nutshell just 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:15.250
 to tell what can this bread maker as 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.380

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.790
 she bakes the main diet razuin

 french bread and gluten free bread 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:26.080
 gluten free to use 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.280
 special flour and also it can 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.989
 make jam 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:33.580
 dough for ravioli pizza dough and 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:35.440
 baking if you think me many 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.420
 ask here you can bake a pizza of course 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.280
 imagine yourself as in such 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.070
 pail can bake no pizza he is here 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:45.760
 don't bake it exclusively dough on 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:47.590
 dumplings and dough for pizza and by the way I 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.769
 I often resort 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.630
 here to this mode of pizza that is doing 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:55.540
 here is the dough when I just have 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:58.989
 no time or no kefir on hand what 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.310
 he cook a miracle dough also me 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:03.340
 like that you can choose 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:06.280
 the size of the bread that is from small to 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.380
 very large and vary color 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.500
 crusts someone likes bright someone 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:15.010
 loves dark but i usually choose gold 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:18.010
 the middle has a snooze timer 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:21.360
 well in general, that's all and also in my either 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:25.000
 the stove there is such a clinic for 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:27.550
 dried fruits for raisins for nuts viz . 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.220
 I use it too often when I bake 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:33.430
 bread for example with raisins or candied fruit 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.470
 when I bake cakes, there is a dispensary 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.290
 is right here right here under this cover 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:40.600
 and when 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:43.900
 according to the bread machine program 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:47.110
 squeals out from there automatically get enough sleep 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.790
 nuts and raisins and go to the dough this 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:51.820
 very comfortable, that is not necessary 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:54.360
 track time to fill them 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:56.770
 independently manually 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:59.050
 some time later for the stove itself 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:01.720
 proceed to kneading the dough at me 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:02.530
 By the way often ask Pikul I bread in 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.350
 multicooker 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:07.420
 I always answer no if available 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:09.880
 breadmakers speech play off multicookers 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:12.280
 counting is just unwise but because 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:14.500
 there will need to be laid is not like this 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:17.769
 products because I just fell asleep and 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:20.769
 forgot you need to go there will be ready and 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:23.800
 puts the dough just exactly on 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:27.280
 baking here is how you will just 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:30.130
 fell asleep food and forgot until bread maker 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.940
 she did not squeak did not say it was time 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.940
 take out bread 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:39.840
 and here's how you see the process started 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:43.120
 baking 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:46.090
 teng is heated to red and here by 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.290
 after four hours fragrant 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.900
 ruddy loaf 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:52.240
 white bread is ready and just want you 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:55.080

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.080
 it turns out inside 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:02.290
 if you have a bread maker 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:05.230

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:09.330
