00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:11.150
 we can divide the development of tilapia into three plots 

00:00:11.689 --> 00:00:15.379
 juvenile fry growing or fattening 

00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:21.859
 the fry stage goes from metamorphosis to washing up to about ten 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:23.810
 weight grams 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.230
 the juvenile stage vahidi 10 up to 50 grams 

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:32.259
 above 50 grams the fattening growth phase 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.390
 the tilapia can weigh more than six kilos but from the point of view 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.390
 trade will hardly be compensated 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.150
 above 800 grams there are 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:51.150
 after this phase the best rate of growth and conversion is achieved 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.630
 to feed 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:58.030
 this means that the fish grow fast and every pound of feed 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.880
 is practically transformed no pound of live weight 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.750
 tilapia is considered a filter fish, ie 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.040
 feeds also on duty have found in the water 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.430
 your stomach compared to other species 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.720
 it's pretty acidic 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.190
 this causes better management of the cell walls of algae 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.690
 improving the use of phytoplankton nutrients 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.560
 stability allows for good production and fertilized tanks therefore rich in 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.220
 on duty 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:41.350
 In this situation it is possible to use cheaper ingredients by 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.840
 cost per share 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.610
 tilapia is to create very high densities as is the case with 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:48.830
 tanks-net 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.830
 the use of on-call almost does not exist 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:53.600
 in this case 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.810
 the ration should be complete and of good quality 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.130
 because the fish depends on the mind of the feed provided
