the vault provides you with 60
kilometers<00:00:11.790> of<00:00:12.030> pure<00:00:12.389> electric<00:00:12.900> range<00:00:13.170> and

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
kilometers of pure electric range and

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.020 
kilometers of pure electric range and
this<00:00:13.650> means<00:00:13.889> you<00:00:14.040> don't<00:00:14.219> need<00:00:14.280> any<00:00:14.490> combustion

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
this means you don't need any combustion

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.310 
this means you don't need any combustion
engines<00:00:15.360> you<00:00:15.480> will<00:00:15.629> not<00:00:15.750> consume<00:00:16.110> any

and<00:00:21.390> how<00:00:21.630> to<00:00:21.689> plug<00:00:22.020> in<00:00:22.170> this<00:00:22.349> vehicle<00:00:22.590> so<00:00:23.490> here

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:23.790 
and how to plug in this vehicle so here

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.849 
and how to plug in this vehicle so here
you<00:00:24.540> plug<00:00:24.810> it<00:00:24.930> into<00:00:25.080> a<00:00:25.230> conventional

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
household outlet and then you plug it

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.759 
household outlet and then you plug it
into<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:29.130> car<00:00:29.660> you<00:00:30.660> will<00:00:30.840> charge<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.320> vehicle

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
into the car you will charge the vehicle

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.009

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
that the car actually will deliver only

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.070 
that the car actually will deliver only
in<00:02:07.260> limited<00:02:07.680> performance<00:02:08.239> for<00:02:09.239> your<00:02:09.659> thermal

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
in limited performance for your thermal

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.050 
in limited performance for your thermal
systems<00:02:10.530> this<00:02:10.830> will<00:02:11.009> allow<00:02:11.280> you<00:02:11.340> to<00:02:11.730> maximize

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
systems this will allow you to maximize

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.899 
systems this will allow you to maximize
the<00:02:12.780> electric<00:02:13.170> range<00:02:13.409> in<00:02:13.709> the<00:02:13.920> car<00:02:14.159> so<00:02:14.700> this

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:14.909 
the electric range in the car so this

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:17.059 
the electric range in the car so this
overall<00:02:15.330> makes<00:02:16.110> the<00:02:16.500> ambien

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
overall makes the ambien

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:21.379 
overall makes the ambien
in<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.609> vault<00:02:17.849> a<00:02:18.150> very<00:02:18.659> modern<00:02:19.439> car<00:02:20.209> and<00:02:21.209> where

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:21.389 
in the vault a very modern car and where

00:02:21.389 --> 00:02:23.809 
in the vault a very modern car and where
we<00:02:21.510> see<00:02:21.719> the<00:02:21.840> opportunity<00:02:22.530> for<00:02:23.280> the<00:02:23.370> electric

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
we see the opportunity for the electric

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:25.339 
we see the opportunity for the electric
standard<00:02:24.299> range<00:02:24.540> vehicle<00:02:24.959> is<00:02:25.079> for<00:02:25.260> those

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:25.349 
standard range vehicle is for those

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:27.589 
standard range vehicle is for those
consumers<00:02:25.920> we<00:02:26.639> have<00:02:26.760> short<00:02:27.030> commuting<00:02:27.389> time

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 
consumers we have short commuting time

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:29.360 
consumers we have short commuting time
periods<00:02:27.959> so<00:02:28.079> we're<00:02:28.200> going<00:02:28.290> to<00:02:28.409> see<00:02:28.499> metro

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
periods so we're going to see metro

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.729 
periods so we're going to see metro
markets<00:02:29.760> or<00:02:29.939> suburban<00:02:30.749> markets<00:02:31.319> where<00:02:31.590> the
