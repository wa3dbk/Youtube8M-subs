perfect<00:02:54.390> so<00:02:55.110> let's<00:02:55.260> go<00:02:55.350> into<00:02:55.530> detail<00:02:55.830> and

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
perfect so let's go into detail and

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.410 
perfect so let's go into detail and
maybe<00:02:56.130> tweak<00:02:56.430> this<00:02:56.580> rate<00:02:56.820> a<00:02:56.850> little<00:02:57.030> bit<00:02:57.270> and

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
maybe tweak this rate a little bit and

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.330 
maybe tweak this rate a little bit and
kind<00:02:57.570> of<00:02:57.720> explain<00:02:58.080> it<00:02:58.230> so<00:02:58.380> first<00:02:59.130> thing<00:02:59.250> you

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
kind of explain it so first thing you

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:00.920 
kind of explain it so first thing you
need<00:02:59.430> to<00:02:59.490> do<00:02:59.670> is<00:02:59.790> obviously<00:02:59.940> try<00:03:00.450> to<00:03:00.510> lure<00:03:00.750> the

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
need to do is obviously try to lure the

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.720 
need to do is obviously try to lure the
clan<00:03:01.080> castle<00:03:01.230> troops<00:03:01.380> what<00:03:02.250> he<00:03:02.370> did<00:03:02.550> was<00:03:02.700> he

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
clan castle troops what he did was he

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.670 
clan castle troops what he did was he
destroyed<00:03:03.300> this<00:03:03.420> was<00:03:03.600> a<00:03:03.630> tower<00:03:03.900> with<00:03:04.650> the

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680

balloons<00:03:05.070> which<00:03:05.310> was<00:03:05.460> actually<00:03:05.820> a<00:03:05.850> great

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
balloons which was actually a great

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.790 
balloons which was actually a great
thing<00:03:06.330> because<00:03:06.480> wizard<00:03:06.900> towers<00:03:07.170> are<00:03:07.350> annoying

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
thing because wizard towers are annoying

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.070 
thing because wizard towers are annoying
and<00:03:08.310> he<00:03:08.850> actually<00:03:09.030> lured<00:03:09.570> out<00:03:09.630> most<00:03:09.900> of<00:03:09.990> the

and he actually lured out most of the
troops<00:03:10.230> now<00:03:10.440> if<00:03:10.560> this<00:03:10.800> guy<00:03:10.920> had<00:03:11.130> maybe<00:03:11.700> a<00:03:11.850> witch

those balloons but unfortunately for him
he<00:03:16.650> had<00:03:16.800> a<00:03:16.830> lot<00:03:17.160> of<00:03:17.190> archers<00:03:17.760> so<00:03:18.420> he<00:03:18.570> had<00:03:18.690> to<00:03:18.840> go

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
he had a lot of archers so he had to go

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.710 
he had a lot of archers so he had to go
in<00:03:19.320> another<00:03:19.710> route<00:03:20.040> and<00:03:20.340> destroy<00:03:20.940> them<00:03:21.180> so<00:03:21.480> as

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
in another route and destroy them so as

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.270 
in another route and destroy them so as

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.100 
you guys can see his Queen goes down
here<00:03:23.520> as<00:03:24.270> soon<00:03:24.390> as<00:03:24.540> the<00:03:24.660> archer<00:03:24.900> start

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
here as soon as the archer start

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:26.720 
here as soon as the archer start
targeting<00:03:25.290> the<00:03:25.620> Queen<00:03:25.830> he<00:03:26.010> uses<00:03:26.220> her<00:03:26.340> ability

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
targeting the Queen he uses her ability

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.630 
targeting the Queen he uses her ability
and<00:03:26.910> then<00:03:27.750> he<00:03:27.990> drops<00:03:28.230> his<00:03:28.380> King<00:03:28.590> his<00:03:28.710> wall<00:03:28.950> so

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
and then he drops his King his wall so

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.190 
and then he drops his King his wall so
that's<00:03:29.820> pretty<00:03:30.000> good<00:03:30.210> now<00:03:30.630> he<00:03:30.690> really<00:03:30.960> wanted

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
that's pretty good now he really wanted

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.420 
that's pretty good now he really wanted
to<00:03:31.320> lure<00:03:31.470> out<00:03:31.590> the<00:03:31.620> clan<00:03:31.860> castle<00:03:31.890> troops<00:03:32.160> so

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
to lure out the clan castle troops so

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.190 
to lure out the clan castle troops so
they<00:03:32.550> don't<00:03:32.730> get<00:03:32.850> in<00:03:32.970> the<00:03:33.090> way<00:03:33.120> so<00:03:33.960> I<00:03:33.990> think

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
they don't get in the way so I think

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.840 
they don't get in the way so I think
what<00:03:34.530> he<00:03:34.650> did<00:03:34.680> was<00:03:34.860> he<00:03:35.010> dropped<00:03:35.370> a<00:03:35.520> balloon

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
what he did was he dropped a balloon

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:36.950 
what he did was he dropped a balloon
right<00:03:36.060> here<00:03:36.210> which<00:03:36.390> is<00:03:36.510> what<00:03:36.690> I<00:03:36.720> would<00:03:36.840> have

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:36.960 
right here which is what I would have

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.260 
right here which is what I would have
probably<00:03:37.170> done<00:03:37.470> but<00:03:38.280> maybe<00:03:38.490> one<00:03:38.790> or<00:03:38.910> two<00:03:38.940> more

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:39.270 
probably done but maybe one or two more

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:41.090 
probably done but maybe one or two more
but<00:03:40.050> he<00:03:40.140> got<00:03:40.290> kind<00:03:40.500> of<00:03:40.530> lucky<00:03:40.650> because<00:03:40.890> there's

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
but he got kind of lucky because there's

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.530 
but he got kind of lucky because there's
a<00:03:41.160> lot<00:03:41.280> of<00:03:41.310> air<00:03:41.490> mines<00:03:41.730> there<00:03:41.940> so<00:03:42.180> it<00:03:42.270> kind<00:03:42.510> of

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
a lot of air mines there so it kind of

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.420 
a lot of air mines there so it kind of
worked<00:03:42.750> out<00:03:42.930> for<00:03:43.110> him<00:03:43.170> i<00:03:43.470> lured<00:03:43.950> out<00:03:44.040> two<00:03:44.280> more

instead<00:04:19.650> of<00:04:19.739> traveling<00:04:20.280> all<00:04:20.460> the<00:04:20.940> way<00:04:20.970> to<00:04:21.060> the

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
instead of traveling all the way to the

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:23.150 
instead of traveling all the way to the
archer<00:04:21.510> tower<00:04:21.690> but<00:04:22.230> with<00:04:22.380> that<00:04:22.410> rage<00:04:22.740> spell<00:04:23.010> he

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
archer tower but with that rage spell he

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.190 
archer tower but with that rage spell he
kind<00:04:23.370> of<00:04:23.430> saved<00:04:23.669> themselves<00:04:23.820> so<00:04:24.300> uh<00:04:24.510> I<00:04:25.080> guess

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
kind of saved themselves so uh I guess

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.200 
kind of saved themselves so uh I guess
it's<00:04:26.040> not<00:04:26.130> too<00:04:26.400> bad<00:04:26.580> I'm

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
it's not too bad I'm

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:28.909 
it's not too bad I'm
there's<00:04:27.479> a<00:04:27.539> lot<00:04:27.690> of<00:04:27.720> balloons<00:04:27.990> over<00:04:28.289> used<00:04:28.710> on

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:28.919 
there's a lot of balloons over used on

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:30.950 
there's a lot of balloons over used on
this<00:04:29.100> section<00:04:29.460> on<00:04:29.550> the<00:04:29.580> left<00:04:29.669> but<00:04:30.509> regardless

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 
this section on the left but regardless

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.990 
this section on the left but regardless
of<00:04:31.229> it<00:04:31.380> it<00:04:31.560> still<00:04:31.830> worked<00:04:32.130> out<00:04:32.310> and<00:04:32.490> then<00:04:32.850> I

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
of it it still worked out and then I

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.689 
of it it still worked out and then I
think<00:04:33.270> he<00:04:33.479> has<00:04:33.660> all<00:04:34.470> his<00:04:34.800> hounds<00:04:35.190> on<00:04:35.340> the

00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:35.699 
think he has all his hounds on the

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:38.150 
think he has all his hounds on the
battlefield<00:04:36.630> I<00:04:36.750> would<00:04:36.870> say<00:04:37.020> and<00:04:37.830> it<00:04:37.979> looks

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
battlefield I would say and it looks

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.409 
battlefield I would say and it looks
like<00:04:38.310> the<00:04:38.430> archer<00:04:38.669> queen<00:04:38.880> is<00:04:39.060> getting

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:39.419 
like the archer queen is getting

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:41.960 
like the archer queen is getting
targeted<00:04:39.539> like<00:04:40.380> I<00:04:40.500> mentioned<00:04:40.740> and<00:04:41.520> now<00:04:41.639> as<00:04:41.880> you

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
targeted like I mentioned and now as you

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:43.370 
targeted like I mentioned and now as you
guys<00:04:42.090> can<00:04:42.270> see<00:04:42.330> he<00:04:42.599> uses<00:04:42.840> that<00:04:42.930> rage<00:04:43.110> spell

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
guys can see he uses that rage spell

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:44.990 
guys can see he uses that rage spell
those<00:04:43.590> hounds<00:04:43.830> are<00:04:43.979> going<00:04:44.099> to<00:04:44.160> fly<00:04:44.550> straight

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
those hounds are going to fly straight

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.700 
those hounds are going to fly straight
to<00:04:45.120> their<00:04:45.240> defense<00:04:45.630> but<00:04:46.229> look<00:04:46.349> at<00:04:46.470> how<00:04:46.560> many

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
to their defense but look at how many

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.050 
to their defense but look at how many
balloons<00:04:46.949> he's<00:04:47.220> losing<00:04:47.610> throughout<00:04:47.940> this

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
balloons he's losing throughout this

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.129 
balloons he's losing throughout this
rate<00:04:48.270> because<00:04:48.569> he<00:04:48.660> didn't<00:04:48.900> drop<00:04:49.110> him

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:49.139 
rate because he didn't drop him

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:51.260 
rate because he didn't drop him
perfectly<00:04:49.710> he<00:04:50.460> just<00:04:50.639> kind<00:04:50.849> of<00:04:50.910> sprayed<00:04:51.120> them

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
perfectly he just kind of sprayed them

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.210 
perfectly he just kind of sprayed them
around<00:04:51.449> and<00:04:51.660> hope<00:04:51.810> for<00:04:51.840> the<00:04:52.020> best<00:04:52.080> rage<00:04:52.949> spell

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
around and hope for the best rage spell

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:54.140 
around and hope for the best rage spell
again<00:04:53.460> could<00:04:53.639> have<00:04:53.729> been<00:04:53.819> placed<00:04:54.030> a<00:04:54.120> little

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
again could have been placed a little

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:55.580 
again could have been placed a little
bit<00:04:54.449> better<00:04:54.599> maybe<00:04:54.660> on<00:04:54.990> top<00:04:55.110> of<00:04:55.259> the<00:04:55.319> wizard

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
bit better maybe on top of the wizard

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:58.129 
bit better maybe on top of the wizard
tower<00:04:55.710> and<00:04:56.009> also<00:04:56.250> their<00:04:56.400> defense<00:04:56.789> an<00:04:56.910> expo<00:04:57.300> but

00:04:58.129 --> 00:04:58.139 
tower and also their defense an expo but

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:00.529 
tower and also their defense an expo but
overall<00:04:58.560> we<00:04:59.220> still<00:04:59.430> have<00:04:59.550> that<00:04:59.699> one<00:04:59.759> max<00:05:00.300> sound

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:00.539 
overall we still have that one max sound

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:02.270 
overall we still have that one max sound
what<00:05:00.840> it<00:05:00.930> looks<00:05:01.110> like<00:05:01.289> at<00:05:01.470> least<00:05:01.500> its<00:05:01.860> massive

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 
what it looks like at least its massive

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:03.499 
what it looks like at least its massive
but<00:05:02.460> probably<00:05:02.729> because<00:05:02.849> of<00:05:03.000> the<00:05:03.090> rage<00:05:03.240> spell

00:05:03.499 --> 00:05:03.509 
but probably because of the rage spell

00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:05.930 
but probably because of the rage spell
it<00:05:04.380> looks<00:05:04.560> like<00:05:04.680> it's<00:05:04.860> still<00:05:05.039> alive<00:05:05.280> and<00:05:05.610> again

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 
it looks like it's still alive and again

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:07.189 
it looks like it's still alive and again
look<00:05:06.180> at<00:05:06.240> how<00:05:06.389> many<00:05:06.449> balloons<00:05:06.780> are<00:05:06.990> getting

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:07.199 
look at how many balloons are getting

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:09.529 
look at how many balloons are getting
targeted<00:05:07.380> and<00:05:07.830> getting<00:05:08.310> destroyed<00:05:08.699> because

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:09.539 
targeted and getting destroyed because

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:11.870 
targeted and getting destroyed because
his<00:05:09.840> placement<00:05:10.110> was<00:05:10.410> off<00:05:10.680> so<00:05:11.070> maybe<00:05:11.550> two

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880 
his placement was off so maybe two

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.430 
his placement was off so maybe two
balloons<00:05:12.150> for<00:05:12.389> this<00:05:12.539> Archer<00:05:12.840> tower<00:05:13.020> and<00:05:13.320> two

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 
balloons for this Archer tower and two

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:14.870 
balloons for this Archer tower and two
balloons<00:05:13.710> for<00:05:13.889> this<00:05:14.009> Archer<00:05:14.310> tower<00:05:14.460> if<00:05:14.639> he<00:05:14.759> had

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 
balloons for this Archer tower if he had

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.969 
balloons for this Archer tower if he had
saved<00:05:15.150> instead<00:05:15.840> of<00:05:15.960> dropping<00:05:16.139> a<00:05:16.470> bunch<00:05:16.830> of

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:16.979 
saved instead of dropping a bunch of

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:19.570 
saved instead of dropping a bunch of
balloons<00:05:17.250> on<00:05:17.550> the<00:05:17.580> left<00:05:17.940> as<00:05:18.750> he<00:05:19.020> did<00:05:19.199> earlier

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:19.580 
balloons on the left as he did earlier

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:21.710 
balloons on the left as he did earlier
you<00:05:20.580> probably<00:05:20.909> could<00:05:21.300> have<00:05:21.330> had<00:05:21.509> more

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.720 
you probably could have had more

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.089 
you probably could have had more
balloons<00:05:22.020> for<00:05:22.169> cleanup<00:05:22.409> and<00:05:22.740> it<00:05:22.889> would<00:05:23.009> have

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:23.099 
balloons for cleanup and it would have

00:05:23.099 --> 00:05:25.820 
balloons for cleanup and it would have
been<00:05:23.190> a<00:05:23.340> much<00:05:23.400> easier<00:05:23.880> raid<00:05:24.330> but<00:05:24.930> overall<00:05:25.259> even

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:25.830 
been a much easier raid but overall even

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:27.559 
been a much easier raid but overall even
with<00:05:25.979> all<00:05:26.159> those<00:05:26.280> mistakes<00:05:26.669> he<00:05:27.240> was<00:05:27.360> still

00:05:27.559 --> 00:05:27.569 
with all those mistakes he was still

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:28.969 
with all those mistakes he was still
able<00:05:27.750> to<00:05:27.960> get<00:05:28.080> a<00:05:28.110> three<00:05:28.349> star<00:05:28.500> which<00:05:28.680> just

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:28.979 
able to get a three star which just

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:31.610 
able to get a three star which just
shows<00:05:29.039> you<00:05:29.370> how<00:05:29.759> powerful<00:05:30.210> this<00:05:30.360> rate<00:05:30.599> is<00:05:30.810> this

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:31.620 
shows you how powerful this rate is this

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.529 
shows you how powerful this rate is this
strategy<00:05:32.159> I<00:05:32.190> would<00:05:32.280> say<00:05:32.610> so<00:05:33.060> if<00:05:33.180> you<00:05:33.240> guys<00:05:33.360> ever

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:33.539 
strategy I would say so if you guys ever

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:35.330 
strategy I would say so if you guys ever
wondering<00:05:34.110> or<00:05:34.409> you<00:05:34.590> kind<00:05:34.800> of<00:05:34.860> confused<00:05:35.250> at

wondering or you kind of confused at

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:37.399 
wondering or you kind of confused at
what<00:05:35.460> rate<00:05:35.639> to<00:05:35.820> do<00:05:35.970> and<00:05:36.150> you<00:05:36.930> don't<00:05:37.110> really

00:05:37.399 --> 00:05:37.409 
what rate to do and you don't really

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:38.810 
what rate to do and you don't really
know<00:05:37.560> how<00:05:37.590> to<00:05:37.740> bring<00:05:37.949> the<00:05:38.099> golem<00:05:38.400> and<00:05:38.520> jump<00:05:38.729> it
