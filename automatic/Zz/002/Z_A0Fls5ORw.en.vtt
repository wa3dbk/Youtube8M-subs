00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.020 
you would work very well in the two
strike<00:01:31.380> formation<00:01:31.890> if<00:01:32.040> need<00:01:32.490> be<00:01:32.520> but<00:01:32.850> as<00:01:32.970> you

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
strike formation if need be but as you

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.819 
strike formation if need be but as you
can<00:01:33.119> see<00:01:33.329> here<00:01:33.570> is<00:01:33.900> always<00:01:34.259> there<00:01:34.380> in<00:01:34.530> sport

passing<00:02:29.760> isn't<00:02:30.240> that<00:02:30.360> great<00:02:30.540> so<00:02:30.750> you<00:02:30.810> don't

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
passing isn't that great so you don't

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:32.210
