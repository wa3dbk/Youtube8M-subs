00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
different things because so yeah this

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:27.360 
different things because so yeah this
cube<00:02:24.939> thingy<00:02:25.629> I'm<00:02:26.049> not<00:02:26.709> going<00:02:26.890> on<00:02:27.010> settings

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:55.470 
away and yeah some of these are really
nice<00:02:52.959> i<00:02:53.290> must<00:02:53.470> say<00:02:53.709> and<00:02:53.950> this<00:02:54.700> is<00:02:54.849> a<00:02:55.000> very<00:02:55.329> good

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
nice i must say and this is a very good

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:01.410 
nice i must say and this is a very good
app<00:02:56.069> but<00:02:57.069> um<00:02:57.780> say<00:02:58.780> and<00:02:59.200> i<00:02:59.620> think<00:03:00.430> this<00:03:00.639> should

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
app but um say and i think this should

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.390 
app but um say and i think this should
be<00:03:01.720> free<00:03:02.049> and<00:03:02.370> it<00:03:03.370> isn't<00:03:03.700> but<00:03:04.799> um<00:03:05.799> yeah<00:03:06.250> because

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
be free and it isn't but um yeah because

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.289 
be free and it isn't but um yeah because
i<00:03:06.760> think<00:03:06.819> if<00:03:07.209> you<00:03:07.269> have<00:03:08.230> this<00:03:08.500> probably<00:03:09.129> a<00:03:09.519> year

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:10.299 
i think if you have this probably a year

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:13.740 
i think if you have this probably a year
you're<00:03:11.200> going<00:03:11.470> to<00:03:11.620> go<00:03:11.709> back<00:03:11.980> and<00:03:12.280> click<00:03:12.760> normal

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
you're going to go back and click normal

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.729 
you're going to go back and click normal
because<00:03:14.819> it's<00:03:15.819> just<00:03:16.000> at<00:03:16.540> the<00:03:17.139> beginning<00:03:17.290> psych

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739
