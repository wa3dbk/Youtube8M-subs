00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.439 
to my 2011 Suzuki 1250 so I got this kit
it's<00:00:17.360> made<00:00:17.750> by<00:00:17.930> LSL<00:00:18.650> out<00:00:18.830> of<00:00:18.949> Germany<00:00:19.400> so<00:00:19.580> as

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:20.449 
it's made by LSL out of Germany so as

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:22.300 
it's made by LSL out of Germany so as
long<00:00:20.600> as<00:00:20.660> it's<00:00:20.900> not<00:00:20.960> made<00:00:21.170> by<00:00:21.289> BMW<00:00:21.890> it<00:00:22.009> probably

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:22.310 
long as it's not made by BMW it probably

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.570 
long as it's not made by BMW it probably
should<00:00:22.460> be<00:00:22.580> good<00:00:23.140> alright<00:00:24.140> so<00:00:24.439> on<00:00:24.769> the<00:00:25.130> stouter

right back I have the four original
bolts<00:01:19.790> out<00:01:19.880> right<00:01:20.150> now<00:01:20.330> I'm<00:01:21.320> ready<00:01:21.530> to<00:01:21.620> start

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
bolts out right now I'm ready to start

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.550 
bolts out right now I'm ready to start
installing<00:01:22.160> this<00:01:22.490> with<00:01:22.700> the<00:01:22.850> spacers<00:01:23.300> I<00:01:23.600> did

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
installing this with the spacers I did

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.860 
installing this with the spacers I did
check<00:01:24.800> the<00:01:24.950> length<00:01:25.130> with<00:01:26.000> this<00:01:26.240> and<00:01:26.540> these

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:26.870 
check the length with this and these

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.350 
check the length with this and these
bolts<00:01:27.260> compared<00:01:27.770> and<00:01:28.220> with<00:01:28.880> the<00:01:29.000> spacers

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
bolts compared and with the spacers

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.390 
bolts compared and with the spacers
compared<00:01:29.750> to<00:01:29.810> the<00:01:29.900> old<00:01:30.020> bolts<00:01:30.320> looks<00:01:31.280> like

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 
compared to the old bolts looks like

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.130 
compared to the old bolts looks like
they<00:01:31.550> did<00:01:31.700> a<00:01:31.730> nice<00:01:31.910> engineering<00:01:32.420> job<00:01:32.630> so<00:01:32.990> it

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
they did a nice engineering job so it

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.020 
they did a nice engineering job so it
looks<00:01:33.290> like<00:01:33.410> it's<00:01:33.560> going<00:01:33.650> to<00:01:33.710> fit<00:01:33.950> well<00:01:34.100> notice

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
looks like it's going to fit well notice

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.400 
looks like it's going to fit well notice
I<00:01:35.120> put<00:01:35.150> some<00:01:35.390> Loctite<00:01:35.600> on<00:01:35.810> each<00:01:36.080> one<00:01:36.230> of<00:01:36.320> these

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:36.410 
I put some Loctite on each one of these

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:38.110 
I put some Loctite on each one of these
this<00:01:36.710> is<00:01:36.770> medium<00:01:37.220> strength<00:01:37.430> lock<00:01:37.700> type<00:01:37.910> and

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:38.120 
this is medium strength lock type and

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.230 
this is medium strength lock type and
again<00:01:38.660> I'm<00:01:38.900> going<00:01:39.170> to<00:01:40.120> tighten<00:01:41.120> it<00:01:41.150> down

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
again I'm going to tighten it down

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.850 
again I'm going to tighten it down
sequentially<00:01:41.990> and<00:01:42.170> then<00:01:42.320> I'll<00:01:42.440> torque<00:01:42.740> them

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
sequentially and then I'll torque them

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.980 
sequentially and then I'll torque them
down<00:01:42.890> to<00:01:43.220> 10<00:01:43.520> Newton<00:01:44.120> meters<00:01:44.420> not<00:01:44.690> ten

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
down to 10 Newton meters not ten

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.110 
down to 10 Newton meters not ten
foot-pounds<00:01:45.440> 10<00:01:45.680> Newton<00:01:46.010> meters<00:01:46.280> so<00:01:46.970> it's

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:47.120 
foot-pounds 10 Newton meters so it's

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.730 
foot-pounds 10 Newton meters so it's
important<00:01:47.480> you<00:01:47.540> have<00:01:47.660> a<00:01:47.720> Newton<00:01:48.350> meter<00:01:48.500> wrench

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
important you have a Newton meter wrench

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.470 
important you have a Newton meter wrench
if<00:01:48.980> not<00:01:49.280> I<00:01:49.490> think<00:01:49.520> you<00:01:49.880> can<00:01:50.030> torque<00:01:50.330> them<00:01:50.450> down

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:50.480 
if not I think you can torque them down

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.690 
if not I think you can torque them down
I<00:01:50.870> think<00:01:51.200> they<00:01:51.410> give<00:01:51.560> you<00:01:51.650> a<00:01:51.710> spec<00:01:52.010> and<00:01:52.310> the

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
I think they give you a spec and the

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.610 
I think they give you a spec and the
sheet<00:01:52.970> with<00:01:53.210> foot-pounds<00:01:53.900> but<00:01:54.080> I<00:01:54.110> typically

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:54.620 
sheet with foot-pounds but I typically

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.340 
sheet with foot-pounds but I typically
use<00:01:54.940> Newton<00:01:55.940> meters<00:01:56.150> for<00:01:56.360> all<00:01:56.420> my<00:01:56.570> German<00:01:57.200> and

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
use Newton meters for all my German and

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.070 
use Newton meters for all my German and
Japanese<00:01:57.830> motorcycles<00:01:58.730> so<00:01:59.420> I'll<00:01:59.540> pop<00:01:59.750> this<00:01:59.900> on

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080 
Japanese motorcycles so I'll pop this on

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.540 
Japanese motorcycles so I'll pop this on
here<00:02:00.260> and<00:02:00.350> we'll<00:02:00.470> be<00:02:00.500> right<00:02:00.650> back<00:02:00.830> alright<00:02:01.340> I

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:01.550 
here and we'll be right back alright I

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.030 
here and we'll be right back alright I
have<00:02:01.910> all<00:02:02.180> four<00:02:02.750> bolts<00:02:03.170> put<00:02:03.380> into<00:02:03.560> place<00:02:03.770> and

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
have all four bolts put into place and

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.270 
have all four bolts put into place and
torque<00:02:04.280> to<00:02:04.460> ten<00:02:04.820> Newton<00:02:05.420> meters<00:02:05.720> I<00:02:06.190> wanted<00:02:07.190> to

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
torque to ten Newton meters I wanted to

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.249 
torque to ten Newton meters I wanted to
make<00:02:07.400> sure<00:02:07.430> that<00:02:08.090> you<00:02:08.300> know<00:02:08.509> that<00:02:08.539> these<00:02:09.020> are

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
make sure that you know that these are

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.320 
make sure that you know that these are
all<00:02:09.800> the<00:02:10.129> same<00:02:10.310> length<00:02:10.369> there's<00:02:10.970> 60

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
all the same length there's 60

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.559 
all the same length there's 60
millimeters<00:02:11.840> long<00:02:12.110> in<00:02:13.099> the<00:02:13.310> set<00:02:13.579> there's<00:02:14.359> also

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
millimeters long in the set there's also

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:17.259 
millimeters long in the set there's also
one<00:02:14.959> that<00:02:15.049> Shorter's<00:02:15.469> 55<00:02:15.980> millimeters<00:02:16.519> this

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:17.269 
one that Shorter's 55 millimeters this

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:18.640 
one that Shorter's 55 millimeters this
goes<00:02:17.540> on<00:02:17.719> the<00:02:17.750> other<00:02:17.959> side

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
goes on the other side

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:19.960 
goes on the other side
and<00:02:18.890> you'll<00:02:19.010> see<00:02:19.190> that<00:02:19.220> in<00:02:19.430> the<00:02:19.519> instruction

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
and you'll see that in the instruction

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.330 
and you'll see that in the instruction
sheet<00:02:20.019> so<00:02:21.019> you<00:02:21.530> want<00:02:21.680> to<00:02:21.739> make<00:02:21.830> sure<00:02:21.860> you<00:02:22.129> have

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
sheet so you want to make sure you have

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.500 
sheet so you want to make sure you have
all<00:02:23.030> for<00:02:23.510> the<00:02:23.660> 60<00:02:23.959> millimeter<00:02:24.319> ones<00:02:24.560> here<00:02:24.920> also

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
all for the 60 millimeter ones here also

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.030 
all for the 60 millimeter ones here also
on<00:02:26.510> the<00:02:26.690> other<00:02:26.720> side<00:02:27.080> the<00:02:27.440> spacers<00:02:27.890> are

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
on the other side the spacers are

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.580 
on the other side the spacers are
shorter<00:02:28.550> so<00:02:29.239> you<00:02:29.330> have<00:02:29.480> four<00:02:29.720> longer<00:02:30.170> spacers

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
shorter so you have four longer spacers

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.130 
shorter so you have four longer spacers
for<00:02:30.769> this<00:02:30.920> side<00:02:31.160> three<00:02:32.150> shorter<00:02:32.569> spacers<00:02:33.019> for

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
for this side three shorter spacers for

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.990 
for this side three shorter spacers for
the<00:02:33.230> other<00:02:33.349> side<00:02:33.620> that's<00:02:34.340> really<00:02:34.459> important

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
the other side that's really important

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.300 
the other side that's really important
to<00:02:35.180> notate<00:02:35.780> so<00:02:36.530> that<00:02:36.680> when<00:02:36.799> you<00:02:36.890> put<00:02:37.099> it<00:02:37.190> back

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
to notate so that when you put it back

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.030 
to notate so that when you put it back
together<00:02:38.090> you'll<00:02:38.510> get<00:02:38.629> it<00:02:38.750> correct<00:02:39.110> so<00:02:39.830> this

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
together you'll get it correct so this

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.470 
together you'll get it correct so this
sides<00:02:40.280> finished<00:02:40.700> except<00:02:40.970> for<00:02:41.090> adding<00:02:41.330> this

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
sides finished except for adding this

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.820 
sides finished except for adding this
last<00:02:41.780> piece<00:02:42.080> we'll<00:02:42.290> do<00:02:42.379> that<00:02:42.500> here<00:02:42.709> in<00:02:42.739> a
