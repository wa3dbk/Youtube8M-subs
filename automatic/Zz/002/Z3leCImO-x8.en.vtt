gambit fnatic and looking how do you
think<00:01:58.469> your<00:01:58.680> style<00:01:59.130> differs<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.090> those<00:02:00.840> teams

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
think your style differs to those teams

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.170 
think your style differs to those teams
to<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.409> Korean<00:02:01.799> teams<00:02:02.009> European<00:02:02.670> teams<00:02:02.909> and

to the Korean teams European teams and

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.380 
to the Korean teams European teams and
Vulcan<00:02:03.899> in<00:02:04.020> your<00:02:04.170> group<00:02:04.380> I<00:02:04.680> think<00:02:05.610> that<00:02:05.969> the

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
Vulcan in your group I think that the

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.290 
Vulcan in your group I think that the
Southeast<00:02:06.990> Asian<00:02:07.380> region<00:02:08.030> focuses<00:02:09.030> more<00:02:09.239> on

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
Southeast Asian region focuses more on

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.949 
Southeast Asian region focuses more on
the<00:02:09.629> extended<00:02:10.140> lazy<00:02:10.410> phases<00:02:11.039> and<00:02:11.599> they<00:02:12.599> empty

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
the extended lazy phases and they empty

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.850 
the extended lazy phases and they empty
in<00:02:13.050> fights

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
in fights

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.040

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
right now 0 for 3 in the group stage

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.040 
right now 0 for 3 in the group stage
number<00:02:19.770> 1<00:02:20.100> can<00:02:20.490> you<00:02:20.730> turn<00:02:20.940> that<00:02:21.000> record<00:02:21.630> around

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
number 1 can you turn that record around

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.620 
number 1 can you turn that record around
and<00:02:22.770> have<00:02:23.040> a<00:02:23.070> positive<00:02:23.340> win<00:02:23.880> ratio<00:02:24.090> at<00:02:24.390> the<00:02:24.450> end

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
and have a positive win ratio at the end

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.050 
and have a positive win ratio at the end
and<00:02:24.870> number<00:02:25.440> 2<00:02:25.590> which<00:02:25.950> teams<00:02:26.340> do<00:02:26.700> you<00:02:26.790> feel

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
and number 2 which teams do you feel

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.350 
and number 2 which teams do you feel
capable<00:02:27.390> of<00:02:27.810> taking<00:02:28.050> down<00:02:28.290> here<00:02:28.770> I<00:02:29.240> think<00:02:30.240> we

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
capable of taking down here I think we

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.080 
capable of taking down here I think we
can<00:02:30.570> turn<00:02:31.140> it<00:02:31.350> around<00:02:31.530> if<00:02:31.830> we<00:02:32.100> just<00:02:32.460> commit

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
can turn it around if we just commit

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.060 
can turn it around if we just commit
less<00:02:33.360> mistakes<00:02:33.840> early<00:02:34.020> game<00:02:34.380> like<00:02:34.620> not

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
less mistakes early game like not

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.090 
less mistakes early game like not
