00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 very good to all, how was he doing it? 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.480
 a lot that I did not do any video of 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.790
 devil 3 and is that there is a user that 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.880
 early morning he asked me how he 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.460
 get the lost newspaper that is the one 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.730
 lacks for the achievement of the archivist 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.250
 of act 1 and well then this diary together 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.140
 with daily william Part 1 and Part 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.970
 2 and together with the old air 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.740
 apparently they appear in the same area 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.380
 I do not have it what you have to do 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.050
 is to create a game in act one normal 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.030
 good if you want with the monkey both good 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.130
 but well I do it normal to go more 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.840
 fast and on any more difficulty or 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.790
 less advanced the game what you have 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.469
 what to do when you start the game is 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.989
 through the door where here are the 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.450
 zombies and we have to go the way of the 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.140
 old tristan from the old ruins towards 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.820
 where was the devil tristan 1 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.809
 So here I am telling you the way 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.090
 that we have to continue where they can 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.610
 leave the different locations in 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.859
 which can appear the newspapers and 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.660
 concretely then here in this little house 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.360
 may appear 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.240
 the boxes that one of the 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.640
 newspapers you go north and in this 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.770
 area where the corpse is this 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.290
 adventurous now we have not gone anything we 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.810
 You can also leave what are the 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.850
 travellers journal that are good there is a 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.600
 difference some are from the achievement of 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:24.479
 archivist and others are the achievement of 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.650
 history of tristan seems to me that of 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.130
 researcher I do not remember very well 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:31.170
 so then one goes out 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.740
 the one who asked me are you in the newspaper 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.680
 lost then it would be the other location and 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.369
 such as this would be another 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.560
 corpses of characters 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:45.299
 another possibility where you can read the 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:47.939
 box is if I remember correctly here in 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:52.770
 In this little house here, it can come out 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:54.420
 also then the box and now let's see 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.030
 where it can come out again is the corpse 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.350
 which is specifically the corpse of warri 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.080
 this yes I found several 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.410
 times 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.570
 and she around here I have not had the 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.800
 corpse of warri is in this little corner 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.370
 what has happened to me what can not be done 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.370
 teach now 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.770
 many times because what appears is a 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:16.800
 wagon that has been burned and in this 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:19.770
 of course now nothing has appeared 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.050
 times then here is the wagon and 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.870
 then you play the corpse of 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.319
 warri and gives you another other diary of 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.750
 traveler 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:29.700
 good here found the thÃ¡der de warri 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.260
 which was spoken whenever he comes is 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.620
 this area you will see that there is a cart and 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.300
 a kind of suckling pig here that are 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.970
 cooking that I should be eating is what 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.280
 warrick and well then when you activate it 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:44.310
 Well, I should leave a diary to me 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:47.280
 this diary because I already have it and now we 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.959
 we put in good another area where you can 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.630
 leave the happy box that yes that the 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.980
 I'm jumping all is in this little house 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.880
 from here the team of san luis also the 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.370
 box 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:02.950
 well that would be the long room I for 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:05.950
 find the the box is with the old 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:08.590
 daily is in this little house here 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.000
 old tristan you have the panel here 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.430
 side with which I know how it would be 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.170
 come up here then go down here 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.480
 down you leave the gray house aside 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.370
 bolt do not get confused and you go to this other 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.380
 little house here can leave us 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:24.100
 also the box where the newspaper is 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:26.710
 lost and finally because if not bad 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:29.660
 I remember was this other house here as 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:31.650
 he can also leave us 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:34.260
 the newspaper 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.360
 and then good for what I told you 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.129
 short rum would go to old ruins and 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:43.240
 look at those three locations over here 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:45.010
 the first one has not left you go down 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.140
 for saiz the baseball house does not 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.420
 confuse you look here look at the box 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:52.330
 old memories and here you have the diary 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:56.100
 old part 1 and the last thing that 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.100
 would look here that nothing has come out 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.540
 well here as I told you in this 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.950
 little corner of old after 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.260
 old risk lines tristan as there are 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.580
 a box of memories old and good here 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.250
 Well, I got the diary of William 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.900
 in part 2 and here is the third 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.120
 memory box that I told you in the 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.849
 little house below the breeze and diary 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:18.540
 Villager because that did not think there 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:22.199
 here and good to comment finally that 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:24.360
 I believe that the location of the box is 

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:25.800
 random and the content is also 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.479
 random can come out any of those 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.720
 random newspapers look again here in the 

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:32.480
 same site 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:34.670
 and that old one actually comes in 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.410
 every box header you can find 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:38.180
 jump a different diary so what 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:40.880
 more effective is what I am doing 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:44.570
 Now do a run to the three boxes and 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:48.830
 Finally, you will end up taking all the 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:50.360
 of the investigator's achievement this forgiveness or 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:52.910
 that of archivist to get all the 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:56.300
 books here and I only have two more 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:58.610
 the researcher also because he goes out here 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.200
 the villager's diary and I imagine that 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.990
 Here there is one that we also 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:04.400
 can leave but those are from where 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:05.870
 It was the corpse of warrick is contante 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.970
 It's good, I hope it's cleared up 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:10.160
 even a little bit maybe it's a bit 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:12.590
 confusing but that way getting is 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.240
 you will get forgiveness complete your 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:16.750
 achievement until the next video devil 3 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.750
 chao chao
