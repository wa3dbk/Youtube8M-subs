demonstrate how much this can help let

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959

day<00:02:31.989> I<00:02:32.549> usually<00:02:33.549> like<00:02:33.730> to<00:02:33.880> charge<00:02:34.150> it<00:02:34.360> when

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
day I usually like to charge it when

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.870 
day I usually like to charge it when
it's<00:02:34.630> around<00:02:34.870> 15<00:02:35.320> to<00:02:35.470> 20<00:02:35.769> percent<00:02:36.100> now<00:02:36.700> I<00:02:36.730> was

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
it's around 15 to 20 percent now I was

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.550 
it's around 15 to 20 percent now I was
usually<00:02:37.090> getting<00:02:37.510> down<00:02:37.690> to<00:02:37.870> that<00:02:37.900> after<00:02:38.380> about

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
usually getting down to that after about

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.160 
usually getting down to that after about
four<00:02:38.829> hours<00:02:38.950> of<00:02:39.130> use<00:02:39.370> both<00:02:39.970> of<00:02:40.000> them<00:02:40.269> Wi-Fi<00:02:40.810> and

four hours of use both of them Wi-Fi and

four hours of use both of them Wi-Fi and
playing<00:02:41.530> games<00:02:42.000> when<00:02:43.000> I<00:02:43.060> went<00:02:43.329> to<00:02:43.390> calibrate

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
playing games when I went to calibrate

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.960 
playing games when I went to calibrate
it<00:02:43.930> the<00:02:44.200> results<00:02:44.560> surprised<00:02:44.860> me<00:02:45.100> the<00:02:45.610> battery

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
it the results surprised me the battery

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.220 
it the results surprised me the battery
didn't<00:02:46.239> quit<00:02:46.420> for<00:02:46.630> more<00:02:46.780> than<00:02:46.930> two<00:02:47.200> hours

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
didn't quit for more than two hours

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.090 
didn't quit for more than two hours
after<00:02:48.100> getting<00:02:48.340> to<00:02:48.519> 15%<00:02:49.380> the<00:02:50.380> inaccuracy<00:02:50.829> of

after getting to 15% the inaccuracy of

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.159 
after getting to 15% the inaccuracy of
the<00:02:51.220> meter<00:02:51.459> was<00:02:51.790> easily<00:02:52.150> apparent<00:02:52.570> after

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:53.169 
the meter was easily apparent after

00:02:53.169 --> 00:02:54.570 
the meter was easily apparent after
going<00:02:53.440> down<00:02:53.470> to<00:02:53.799> 8%

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
going down to 8%

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.880 
going down to 8%
he<00:02:54.760> suddenly<00:02:55.000> jumped<00:02:55.360> up<00:02:55.540> to<00:02:55.690> 30%<00:02:55.990> and<00:02:56.500> slowly

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
he suddenly jumped up to 30% and slowly

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.160 
he suddenly jumped up to 30% and slowly
made<00:02:57.160> its<00:02:57.310> way<00:02:57.520> down<00:02:57.850> until<00:02:58.630> dying<00:02:58.810> a<00:02:58.990> two

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
made its way down until dying a two

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.830 
made its way down until dying a two
percent<00:02:59.500> after<00:03:00.330> recalibrating<00:03:01.330> it<00:03:01.450> there<00:03:01.690> was

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
percent after recalibrating it there was

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.480 
percent after recalibrating it there was
no<00:03:01.990> more<00:03:02.200> random<00:03:02.410> skipping<00:03:02.950> of<00:03:03.070> the<00:03:03.190> battery

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:03.490 
no more random skipping of the battery

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:05.700 
no more random skipping of the battery
and<00:03:03.760> it<00:03:03.880> easily<00:03:04.210> lasts<00:03:04.870> well<00:03:05.080> over<00:03:05.350> six<00:03:05.560> hours

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:05.710 
and it easily lasts well over six hours

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:08.970 
and it easily lasts well over six hours
now<00:03:06.660> so<00:03:07.660> before<00:03:07.990> you<00:03:08.170> go<00:03:08.380> killing<00:03:08.830> off

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
now so before you go killing off

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.650 
now so before you go killing off
everything<00:03:09.520> in<00:03:09.670> sight<00:03:09.910> and<00:03:10.120> search<00:03:10.390> at<00:03:10.540> that

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
everything in sight and search at that

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.420 
everything in sight and search at that
extra<00:03:10.930> hour<00:03:11.050> of<00:03:11.350> battery<00:03:11.530> life<00:03:11.770> you<00:03:12.040> may<00:03:12.250> want

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
extra hour of battery life you may want

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.720 
extra hour of battery life you may want
to<00:03:12.490> try<00:03:12.670> calibrating<00:03:13.270> the<00:03:13.360> battery
