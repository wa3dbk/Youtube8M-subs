00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 Hello everyone to talk about 991 and I bring you 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.230
 a new episode of the joke series 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.460
 and to start you're going to see a series of 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.800
 clips that emit quite gracefully 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.599
 while playing and is that this first of 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.799
 mathura enemies without wanting to notice the 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.120
 back bed like knowing that the guy to 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.070
 the best does not realize the tories 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.170
 for my partner god gift times 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.270
 medium means it will be a bit weird and it kills me 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.410
 when we go to the next one where we do not 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.789
 you hear the sound is recorded badly in front 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.859
 more that you see that a case individual 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.570
 three bullets I see him go through there only 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.830
 three bullets I decide not to reload except 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.269
 shooting and I find that is 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.730
 an ally appears at the door and group 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.739
 I'll be on the virus and then it goes and it turns out 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.510
 that he lives behind and killed him with 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.510
 those three bullets through my partner 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.030
 good awful we take to the next one in 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.800
 which you see that I am playing in series 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.270
 of champions killed one enemy lame the 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.620
 des flag do not know the wear and the 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.660
 take the bottom and I see not the 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.129
 here also no longer takes the floor I 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.000
 it's going to get rid of it without a doubt 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.000
 tremendous portal 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:01.960
 the garden look what I would see when I saw that 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.700
 amazing that he was worried that 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.270
 He has messed me up and in the end he commits suicide but 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:08.710
 well let's go to this one that this one also 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.970
 fired a lot and killed one left 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.160
 touched to another sure that some go 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.390
 inside and he does not find out he does not know 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.700
 who had killed him you do not know what 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.080
 been out there amazing guy but 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.700
 remember that the previous episode well 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.780
 of joke I told you that sometimes I had 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.840
 feeling that the heat and laughed at 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.840
 my 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.250
 I will continue with these clips in 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.260
 which I have that feeling 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.090
 he referred especially when the connection 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.950
 was so bad that it prevented him from killing some 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.780
 enemy for example to this look at all 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.060
 the country bullets like a lacatus saved 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.470
 very rare and good in the end killed him but 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.910
 it can still be worse as in this case 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.650
 sure it has happened many times 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:44.950
 things like this one which has a 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:46.960
 enemy that you are going to kill sure and you 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.150
 is the connection and there you have it connection 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.130
 interrupted especially I also 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.690
 I referred to respawn cases or that is already 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.790
 more problem the call of duty as per 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.900
 example this double low and guess where 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.390
 are the enemies not half-turned 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.700
 they come out in the face and you are the same and that 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.040
 I kill myself is an enemy of the others but 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.320
 Now I'm going to the core, I'm not going to the more 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.060
 fat and this is the first one that I do 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.100
 double losses of when and if of champions 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.360
 I take the flag and it is that I have all 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.980
 the gusts to throw are low gusts 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.570
 but I'm going to decide to throw here the 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.130
 drone and attentive what this will do 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:17.080
 drone he threw it and they kill me for the 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.880
 drone follows the ball keeps flying by 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.230
 the map half I am dead 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.070
 enemies take our flag at once 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.950
 we have ours where 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.780
 I'm right next to the awesome enemy 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.510
 but not only that but grave 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:31.060
 there's a book and it kills me lady be with me 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.920
 kill alive in hallucinatory and now we go to 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.709
 worst of all this this hurts 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.330
 tell it but the index is worth it but it deserves 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:38.530
 It's a shame because they are wide more beasts 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.300
 has everything here motivated by the 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.220
 left not on the right we go for the 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.900
 right and you find me the whole team and 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.580
 killed the first and killed the zoom and killed the 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.200
 third he called me to 4 who seems to be 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.730
 shitting 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.470
 but attention I still do not yet 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.520
 I think this is the end they are 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.410
 doing the left and I can do another 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.330
 more and I'm here a rookie at 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.950
 first he killed the second half-turn 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.690
 for the third and killed the quad and I put 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.910
 I do another one and above it the 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.650
 departure is camera and death chamber 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.850
 death of four others plus the 4th 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.920
 previous and that you think is what is going to 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:08.190
 happen that you think that is what is going to 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.190
 happen
