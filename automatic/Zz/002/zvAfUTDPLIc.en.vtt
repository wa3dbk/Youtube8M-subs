3d effect was really well done and the
thing<00:02:55.480> about<00:02:55.540> it<00:02:55.810> is<00:02:55.870> it<00:02:56.019> really<00:02:56.319> really<00:02:56.470> helps

well<00:03:46.930> it's<00:03:47.049> a<00:03:47.079> third<00:03:47.230> person<00:03:47.440> game<00:03:47.769> with<00:03:48.040> that

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
well it's a third person game with that

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:49.830 
well it's a third person game with that
kind<00:03:48.400> of<00:03:48.430> over<00:03:48.760> the<00:03:48.880> shoulder<00:03:49.239> shooter<00:03:49.630> view

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
kind of over the shoulder shooter view

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.020 
kind of over the shoulder shooter view
so<00:03:50.500> it<00:03:50.590> brings<00:03:50.739> the<00:03:50.950> character<00:03:51.639> you've<00:03:51.760> chosen

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
so it brings the character you've chosen

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.210 
so it brings the character you've chosen
out<00:03:52.209> into<00:03:52.389> the<00:03:52.480> foreground<00:03:52.720> I<00:03:53.349> think<00:03:53.829> the<00:03:53.889> 3ds

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
out into the foreground I think the 3ds

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:55.920 
out into the foreground I think the 3ds
most<00:03:54.430> obvious<00:03:54.880> when<00:03:55.120> you're<00:03:55.389> looking<00:03:55.750> down<00:03:55.810> a

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
most obvious when you're looking down a

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.449 
most obvious when you're looking down a
scoped<00:03:56.290> weapon<00:03:56.709> because<00:03:56.980> the<00:03:57.040> scope<00:03:57.280> really

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
scoped weapon because the scope really

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:59.159 
scoped weapon because the scope really
kind<00:03:57.609> of<00:03:57.669> pops<00:03:57.849> out<00:03:58.060> of<00:03:58.090> the<00:03:58.209> screen<00:03:58.630> which<00:03:58.900> I

00:03:59.159 --> 00:03:59.169 
kind of pops out of the screen which I

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:01.530 
kind of pops out of the screen which I
don't<00:03:59.950> know<00:04:00.099> I<00:04:00.160> thought<00:04:00.340> that<00:04:00.519> was<00:04:00.730> maybe<00:04:01.389> a

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
don't know I thought that was maybe a

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.240 
don't know I thought that was maybe a
tiny<00:04:01.810> bit<00:04:02.019> off-putting<00:04:02.230> great<00:04:02.709> for<00:04:02.889> the<00:04:02.980> game

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
tiny bit off-putting great for the game

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.039 
tiny bit off-putting great for the game
proper<00:04:03.760> foot<00:04:04.000> for<00:04:04.180> running<00:04:04.450> around<00:04:04.720> it<00:04:04.900> it's

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:05.049 
proper foot for running around it it's

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:06.630 
proper foot for running around it it's
nice<00:04:05.230> it<00:04:05.410> adds<00:04:05.470> a<00:04:05.680> adds<00:04:06.099> a<00:04:06.280> nice<00:04:06.400> too

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
nice it adds a adds a nice too

probably<00:05:26.150> our<00:05:26.389> bikinis<00:05:26.900> I<00:05:27.110> didn't<00:05:27.590> see<00:05:27.740> any<00:05:27.889> in

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:28.010 
probably our bikinis I didn't see any in

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:29.710 
probably our bikinis I didn't see any in
there<00:05:28.340> but<00:05:28.699> I'm<00:05:28.850> machining<00:05:29.300> they<00:05:29.389> will<00:05:29.570> be

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:29.720 
there but I'm machining they will be

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.570 
there but I'm machining they will be
serving<00:05:30.050> on<00:05:30.200> happens<00:05:30.620> a<00:05:30.680> lot<00:05:30.860> of<00:05:30.979> times<00:05:31.160> it's

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:31.580 
serving on happens a lot of times it's

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:34.930 
serving on happens a lot of times it's
it's<00:05:31.940> coming<00:05:32.450> back<00:05:32.600> to<00:05:32.930> the<00:05:33.410> fighting<00:05:33.940> series

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:34.940 
it's coming back to the fighting series

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:37.029 
it's coming back to the fighting series
it's<00:05:35.180> painful<00:05:35.750> so<00:05:36.470> there's<00:05:36.680> none<00:05:36.860> of<00:05:36.979> this

00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:37.039 
it's painful so there's none of this

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:39.129 
it's painful so there's none of this
crazy<00:05:37.430> spin<00:05:37.850> off<00:05:38.000> stuff<00:05:38.240> which<00:05:38.539> frankly<00:05:38.870> if

impressive<00:05:44.479> them<00:05:44.780> in<00:05:44.990> the<00:05:45.289> conference<00:05:45.680> anyway

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:45.800 
impressive them in the conference anyway

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.469 
impressive them in the conference anyway
they<00:05:46.070> showed<00:05:46.250> some<00:05:46.280> stuff<00:05:46.910> on<00:05:47.060> the<00:05:47.150> big<00:05:47.270> screen

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:47.479 
they showed some stuff on the big screen

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:49.960 
they showed some stuff on the big screen
of<00:05:47.599> that<00:05:47.720> yes<00:05:48.169> absolutely<00:05:48.380> so<00:05:49.250> you<00:05:49.700> went<00:05:49.820> and

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:49.970 
of that yes absolutely so you went and

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:51.850 
of that yes absolutely so you went and
saw<00:05:50.150> something<00:05:50.510> involving<00:05:50.690> monkeys<00:05:51.260> yes<00:05:51.560> I

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:51.860 
saw something involving monkeys yes I

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:57.920 
saw something involving monkeys yes I
saw<00:05:52.130> the<00:05:52.190> Super<00:05:52.610> Monkey<00:05:52.700> Ball<00:05:52.880> in<00:05:53.419> 3d

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:57.930 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:00.540 

I'm<00:05:58.930> in<00:05:59.230> challenge<00:05:59.590> mode<00:05:59.620> which<00:06:00.040> is<00:06:00.070> I<00:06:00.460> think

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:00.550 
I'm in challenge mode which is I think

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:04.590 
I'm in challenge mode which is I think
the<00:06:01.000> main<00:06:01.210> game<00:06:01.750> mode<00:06:02.020> really<00:06:02.380> and<00:06:03.600> it's

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:04.600 
the main game mode really and it's

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.480 
the main game mode really and it's
interesting<00:06:04.840> this<00:06:05.080> to<00:06:05.320> control<00:06:05.710> schemes<00:06:06.070> one

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:06.490 
interesting this to control schemes one

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:09.690 
interesting this to control schemes one
involves<00:06:07.260> tilting<00:06:08.260> like<00:06:08.950> I'm<00:06:09.070> doing<00:06:09.250> now<00:06:09.400> so

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:09.700 
involves tilting like I'm doing now so

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:12.870 
involves tilting like I'm doing now so
it's<00:06:09.850> um<00:06:10.200> motion<00:06:11.200> sensor<00:06:11.530> based<00:06:11.650> and<00:06:12.460> the

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:12.880 
it's um motion sensor based and the

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:14.460 
it's um motion sensor based and the
other<00:06:13.000> control<00:06:13.330> scheme<00:06:13.600> involved<00:06:14.110> in<00:06:14.380> the

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:14.470 
other control scheme involved in the

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:16.560 
other control scheme involved in the
circle<00:06:14.890> pad<00:06:14.920> which<00:06:15.430> is<00:06:15.640> actually<00:06:16.510> very

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:16.570 
circle pad which is actually very

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:19.610 
circle pad which is actually very
comfortable<00:06:16.870> and<00:06:17.350> I'm<00:06:17.800> prefer<00:06:18.340> over<00:06:18.760> the<00:06:18.940> tilt

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:19.620 
comfortable and I'm prefer over the tilt

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:22.140 
comfortable and I'm prefer over the tilt
methods<00:06:20.620> it<00:06:20.860> calls<00:06:21.160> with<00:06:21.460> the<00:06:21.580> narrow<00:06:21.820> angle

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:22.150 
methods it calls with the narrow angle

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:24.300 
methods it calls with the narrow angle
the<00:06:22.690> narrow<00:06:22.870> viewing<00:06:23.170> angle<00:06:23.440> with<00:06:23.560> the<00:06:23.590> 3d<00:06:24.040> I

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:24.310 
the narrow viewing angle with the 3d I

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:26.610 
the narrow viewing angle with the 3d I
find<00:06:24.850> the<00:06:25.300> tilting<00:06:25.720> actually<00:06:26.140> kind<00:06:26.560> of

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:26.620 
find the tilting actually kind of

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:29.610 
find the tilting actually kind of
squirrels<00:06:26.920> it<00:06:27.070> a<00:06:27.130> bit<00:06:27.780> vanilla<00:06:28.780> scoop<00:06:29.020> as

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:29.620 
squirrels it a bit vanilla scoop as

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:32.940 
squirrels it a bit vanilla scoop as
there's<00:06:30.220> also<00:06:30.370> a<00:06:30.550> fight<00:06:31.000> mode<00:06:31.270> and<00:06:31.720> a<00:06:32.500> race

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:32.950 
there's also a fight mode and a race

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:34.890 
there's also a fight mode and a race
mode<00:06:33.220> the<00:06:33.460> race<00:06:33.610> mode<00:06:33.820> looks<00:06:34.000> really<00:06:34.330> good<00:06:34.480> I

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:34.900 
mode the race mode looks really good I

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:36.600 
mode the race mode looks really good I
think<00:06:35.320> 3ds<00:06:35.650> gonna<00:06:35.860> stand<00:06:36.130> up<00:06:36.250> really<00:06:36.430> well

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:36.610 
think 3ds gonna stand up really well

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:40.629 
think 3ds gonna stand up really well
generally<00:06:37.240> in<00:06:37.330> the<00:06:38.050> racing<00:06:38.320> games<00:06:38.650> on<00:06:38.890> here

00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:40.639 
generally in the racing games on here

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:42.010 
generally in the racing games on here
so<00:06:41.180> I<00:06:41.210> think<00:06:41.360> if<00:06:41.599> you<00:06:41.689> were<00:06:41.749> going<00:06:41.870> to<00:06:41.900> play

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:42.020 
so I think if you were going to play

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:44.619 
so I think if you were going to play
super<00:06:42.289> monkey<00:06:42.499> ball<00:06:42.530> with<00:06:42.889> the<00:06:43.189> motion<00:06:44.120> sensor

00:06:44.619 --> 00:06:44.629 
super monkey ball with the motion sensor

00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:47.050 
super monkey ball with the motion sensor
control<00:06:45.349> scheme<00:06:45.770> you<00:06:46.129> would<00:06:46.310> use<00:06:46.699> the<00:06:46.819> slider

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:47.060 
control scheme you would use the slider

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:48.760 
control scheme you would use the slider
to<00:06:47.210> bring<00:06:47.479> the<00:06:47.569> 3d<00:06:47.870> right<00:06:48.050> down<00:06:48.259> and<00:06:48.469> then<00:06:48.590> play

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:48.770 
to bring the 3d right down and then play

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:50.140 
to bring the 3d right down and then play
it<00:06:48.800> like<00:06:49.039> that<00:06:49.189> but<00:06:49.550> I<00:06:49.610> quite<00:06:49.879> like<00:06:50.029> the

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:50.150 
it like that but I quite like the

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:51.339 
it like that but I quite like the
secondary<00:06:50.509> control<00:06:50.749> scheme<00:06:50.990> which<00:06:51.110> is<00:06:51.229> just

00:06:51.339 --> 00:06:51.349 
secondary control scheme which is just

00:06:51.349 --> 00:06:53.170 
secondary control scheme which is just
using<00:06:51.590> the<00:06:51.740> circle<00:06:52.069> part<00:06:52.219> can<00:06:52.789> we<00:06:52.849> call<00:06:52.969> it<00:06:53.120> a

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:53.180 
using the circle part can we call it a

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:54.850 
using the circle part can we call it a
circle<00:06:53.509> part<00:06:53.689> now<00:06:53.840> that's<00:06:54.169> one<00:06:54.289> in<00:06:54.379> Tendo<00:06:54.650> says

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:54.860 
circle part now that's one in Tendo says

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:57.070 
circle part now that's one in Tendo says
it's<00:06:54.979> not<00:06:55.099> analog<00:06:55.490> thumb<00:06:55.729> pad<00:06:55.969> it's<00:06:56.509> an<00:06:56.689> analog

00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:57.080 
it's not analog thumb pad it's an analog

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:59.230 
it's not analog thumb pad it's an analog
stick<00:06:57.439> arrange<00:06:58.370> its<00:06:58.639> that's<00:06:58.939> what<00:06:59.090> it<00:06:59.210> is

00:06:59.230 --> 00:06:59.240 
stick arrange its that's what it is

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:01.059 
stick arrange its that's what it is
never<00:06:59.930> you<00:07:00.020> wanna<00:07:00.139> call<00:07:00.319> it<00:07:00.379> it's<00:07:00.860> gritty

00:07:01.059 --> 00:07:01.069 
never you wanna call it it's gritty

00:07:01.069 --> 00:07:02.860 
never you wanna call it it's gritty
comfy<00:07:01.490> yeah<00:07:01.939> it's<00:07:02.240> really<00:07:02.389> nice<00:07:02.569> and<00:07:02.779> the

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:02.870
