00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:18.400 

Oh

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:18.410 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.920 

in<00:00:19.010> the<00:00:19.250> sitting<00:00:19.580> position<00:00:19.730> we<00:00:20.420> can<00:00:20.570> assess

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:20.930 
in the sitting position we can assess

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.620 
in the sitting position we can assess
muscle<00:00:21.740> strength<00:00:22.100> and<00:00:22.400> one<00:00:22.910> of<00:00:23.030> the<00:00:23.120> tests<00:00:23.510> I

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:23.630 
muscle strength and one of the tests I

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.280 
muscle strength and one of the tests I
do<00:00:24.050> is<00:00:24.350> to<00:00:24.560> look<00:00:24.680> for<00:00:24.920> an<00:00:25.010> extension<00:00:25.430> leg<00:00:25.910> I<00:00:26.290> ask

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:27.290 
do is to look for an extension leg I ask

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:29.230 
do is to look for an extension leg I ask
the<00:00:27.529> patient<00:00:27.890> to<00:00:27.950> extend<00:00:28.460> the<00:00:28.610> knee<00:00:28.730> as<00:00:28.880> much

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:29.240 
the patient to extend the knee as much

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.730 
the patient to extend the knee as much
as<00:00:29.420> possible<00:00:29.660> can<00:00:30.230> you<00:00:30.290> straighten<00:00:30.560> out<00:00:30.710> your

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:30.740 
as possible can you straighten out your

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.229 
as possible can you straighten out your
leg<00:00:31.070> and<00:00:32.230> then<00:00:33.230> passively<00:00:33.860> I<00:00:33.980> further<00:00:34.340> extend

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:35.239 
leg and then passively I further extend

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:38.049 
leg and then passively I further extend
the<00:00:35.420> knee<00:00:35.629> if<00:00:36.010> possible<00:00:37.010> and<00:00:37.280> if<00:00:37.760> I<00:00:37.879> can

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:38.059 
the knee if possible and if I can

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:40.000 
the knee if possible and if I can
further<00:00:38.270> extend<00:00:38.690> the<00:00:38.870> knee<00:00:39.050> it<00:00:39.470> means<00:00:39.800> that

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.010 
further extend the knee it means that

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.160 
further extend the knee it means that
there<00:00:40.129> is<00:00:40.220> an<00:00:40.340> extension<00:00:40.760> lag<00:00:41.180> present<00:00:41.900> which

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
there is an extension lag present which

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.710 
there is an extension lag present which
means<00:00:42.410> the<00:00:42.980> the<00:00:43.370> knee<00:00:43.520> is<00:00:43.700> just<00:00:43.730> lagging<00:00:44.270> and

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:44.720 
means the the knee is just lagging and

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.630 
means the the knee is just lagging and
can't<00:00:44.930> be<00:00:45.110> fully<00:00:45.320> extended<00:00:45.830> by<00:00:45.980> the<00:00:46.040> patient

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
can't be fully extended by the patient

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.540 
can't be fully extended by the patient
actively<00:00:47.570> and<00:00:48.470> that<00:00:48.620> indicates<00:00:49.129> that<00:00:49.340> there's

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
actively and that indicates that there's

00:00:49.550 --> 00:01:00.140 
actively and that indicates that there's
weakness<00:00:49.820> of<00:00:50.120> the<00:00:50.270> quadriceps<00:00:50.839> muscles

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:00.150 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:02.529 

you

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:02.539 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:05.630 

the<00:01:03.539> other<00:01:03.690> test<00:01:03.960> that<00:01:04.170> we<00:01:04.290> do<00:01:04.470> sitting<00:01:04.979> is<00:01:05.190> to

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
the other test that we do sitting is to

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.880 
the other test that we do sitting is to
assess<00:01:06.000> quadriceps<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:06.930> hamstring<00:01:07.530> strength

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
assess quadriceps and hamstring strength

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.690 
assess quadriceps and hamstring strength
directly<00:01:08.549> so<00:01:09.090> for<00:01:09.240> this<00:01:09.390> test<00:01:09.720> I<00:01:10.310> put<00:01:11.310> my<00:01:11.430> hand

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
directly so for this test I put my hand

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.390 
directly so for this test I put my hand
above<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.180> ankle<00:01:12.659> anteriorly<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.409> tech<00:01:13.799> test

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
above the ankle anteriorly to tech test

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.609 
above the ankle anteriorly to tech test
the<00:01:14.610> quadricep<00:01:15.299> strength<00:01:15.690> and<00:01:16.110> ask<00:01:16.440> the

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
the quadricep strength and ask the

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.100 
the quadricep strength and ask the
patient<00:01:17.009> to<00:01:17.040> push<00:01:17.310> out<00:01:17.549> against<00:01:18.450> me<00:01:18.600> as<00:01:18.780> hard

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
patient to push out against me as hard

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.749 
patient to push out against me as hard
as<00:01:19.229> they<00:01:19.380> can<00:01:20.330> without<00:01:21.330> moving<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.930> joint<00:01:22.200> and

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:22.759 
as they can without moving the joint and

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:25.310 
as they can without moving the joint and
that<00:01:23.759> is<00:01:23.940> normal<00:01:24.360> strength<00:01:24.659> and<00:01:24.990> then<00:01:25.170> I'll

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
that is normal strength and then I'll

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.719 
that is normal strength and then I'll
ask<00:01:25.500> them<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:25.860> push<00:01:26.070> in<00:01:26.250> against<00:01:26.640> the

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
ask them to push in against the

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.730 
ask them to push in against the
examining<00:01:27.210> table<00:01:27.420> while<00:01:27.899> my<00:01:28.140> hand<00:01:28.380> is<00:01:28.500> placed

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
are some weakness of the hamstrings in

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:43.900 
are some weakness of the hamstrings in
this<00:01:35.190> case
