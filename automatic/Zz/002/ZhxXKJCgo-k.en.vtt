put the calorie amount so let's say when
you're<00:01:34.680> cutting<00:01:34.920> your<00:01:35.070> body<00:01:35.400> gets<00:01:35.670> used<00:01:35.880> to

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
you're cutting your body gets used to

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.569 
you're cutting your body gets used to
certain<00:01:36.360> calorie<00:01:37.140> amount<00:01:37.290> so<00:01:37.680> say<00:01:37.860> 2000

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
certain calorie amount so say 2000

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.679 
certain calorie amount so say 2000
calories<00:01:39.030> now<00:01:39.930> when<00:01:40.140> you've<00:01:40.259> done<00:01:40.500> losing<00:01:40.829> fat

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:41.689 
calories now when you've done losing fat

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:44.179 
calories now when you've done losing fat
most<00:01:42.689> people<00:01:43.020> will<00:01:43.170> just<00:01:43.200> bump<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.829> calories

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
most people will just bump the calories

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.889 
most people will just bump the calories
back<00:01:44.369> up<00:01:44.549> to<00:01:44.670> one<00:01:44.850> three<00:01:45.119> thousand<00:01:45.570> thirty<00:01:45.659> two

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
back up to one three thousand thirty two

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.149 
back up to one three thousand thirty two
hundred<00:01:45.930> to<00:01:46.229> be<00:01:46.320> in<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.470> lean<00:01:46.619> mass<00:01:46.799> face<00:01:47.040> the

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
hundred to be in the lean mass face the

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.100 
hundred to be in the lean mass face the
problem<00:01:47.520> is<00:01:47.670> your<00:01:48.030> body<00:01:48.299> does<00:01:48.630> not<00:01:48.780> know<00:01:48.930> how

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
problem is your body does not know how

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.350 
problem is your body does not know how
to<00:01:49.140> handle<00:01:49.470> those<00:01:49.979> extra<00:01:50.490> thousand<00:01:50.939> calories

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
to handle those extra thousand calories

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.730 
to handle those extra thousand calories
so<00:01:51.479> they<00:01:51.689> will<00:01:51.840> store<00:01:52.110> in<00:01:52.290> your<00:01:52.380> body<00:01:52.560> will

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
so they will store in your body will

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.710 
so they will store in your body will
store<00:01:52.920> too<00:01:53.430> much<00:01:53.610> of<00:01:53.759> that<00:01:53.850> for<00:01:54.210> fat<00:01:54.390> and

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
store too much of that for fat and

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.389 
store too much of that for fat and
people<00:01:55.649> will<00:01:55.799> accumulate

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
people will accumulate

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.160 
people will accumulate

transition phase when you're done losing

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.389 
transition phase when you're done losing
that<00:02:03.090> weight<00:02:03.360> you<00:02:03.899> should<00:02:03.930> slowly<00:02:04.500> ramp<00:02:05.189> up

we're<00:05:00.280> fed<00:05:00.490> costed<00:05:00.970> by<00:05:01.060> the<00:05:01.120> media<00:05:01.510> concepts

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 
we're fed costed by the media concepts

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:03.690 
we're fed costed by the media concepts
of<00:05:02.440> what<00:05:02.470> the<00:05:02.650> ideal<00:05:02.740> physique<00:05:03.100> might<00:05:03.520> be

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:03.700 
of what the ideal physique might be

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:04.800 
of what the ideal physique might be
right<00:05:04.060> the<00:05:04.210> v-taper

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:04.810 
right the v-taper

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:07.890 
right the v-taper
that<00:05:05.110> x-frame<00:05:05.650> and<00:05:05.890> it<00:05:06.190> changes<00:05:06.520> over<00:05:06.790> time<00:05:06.970> if

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:07.900 
that x-frame and it changes over time if

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.140 
that x-frame and it changes over time if
you<00:05:08.050> look<00:05:08.230> at<00:05:08.350> what<00:05:08.530> the<00:05:08.800> Greeks<00:05:09.520> you<00:05:10.030> know

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
you look at what the Greeks you know

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:11.460 
you look at what the Greeks you know
when<00:05:10.270> they<00:05:10.360> put<00:05:10.480> the<00:05:10.540> ideal<00:05:10.900> physique<00:05:11.110> of<00:05:11.380> the

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:11.470 
when they put the ideal physique of the

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:14.220 
when they put the ideal physique of the
sculpture<00:05:11.980> what<00:05:12.460> it<00:05:12.580> was<00:05:12.900> 7,000<00:05:13.900> years<00:05:14.020> ago

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:14.230 
sculpture what it was 7,000 years ago

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:15.960 
sculpture what it was 7,000 years ago
compared<00:05:14.770> to<00:05:14.830> what<00:05:15.010> it<00:05:15.100> is<00:05:15.190> now<00:05:15.370> it's<00:05:15.580> shifts

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:15.970 
compared to what it is now it's shifts

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:18.030 
compared to what it is now it's shifts
over<00:05:16.270> time<00:05:16.480> so<00:05:16.660> here's<00:05:16.870> one<00:05:17.020> of<00:05:17.050> me<00:05:17.230> and<00:05:17.410> it's

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:18.040 
over time so here's one of me and it's

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.610 
over time so here's one of me and it's
it<00:05:18.490> fluctuates<00:05:19.030> it's<00:05:19.210> fluid<00:05:19.750> your<00:05:20.290> goal

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:20.620 
it fluctuates it's fluid your goal

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.650 
it fluctuates it's fluid your goal
therefore<00:05:21.190> shouldn't<00:05:21.760> be<00:05:22.000> determined<00:05:22.570> by

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:22.660 
therefore shouldn't be determined by

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:25.170 
therefore shouldn't be determined by
someone<00:05:23.110> else<00:05:23.260> feeding<00:05:23.830> you<00:05:24.040> a<00:05:24.280> perception<00:05:25.060> of

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:25.180 
someone else feeding you a perception of

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:26.610 
someone else feeding you a perception of
what<00:05:25.360> your<00:05:25.480> body<00:05:25.660> should<00:05:25.780> look<00:05:25.930> like<00:05:26.080> and

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:26.620 
what your body should look like and

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:28.080 
what your body should look like and
