00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:11.890
 comments on the game but the game is so 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.070
 difficult under began 

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:14.070
 were not 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:20.540
 the rival played fast we have one 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:24.850
 counterattack escaped missed goal 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:27.400
 then there is a series of errors then 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.980
 during scored during brought later 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.080
 took advantage of mistakes 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:36.600
 rivals in defense and so can 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:40.600
 say at the expense of the game player classes 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:43.629
 somewhere it happened to score a lot a lot 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:47.080
 Now I think she this game does not show 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:51.940
 now now and at the championships will be for 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:54.239
 we are each decisive there to be 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.239
 prove 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:01:00.120
 what is our team 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.000
 the debut of the match is performed by all the teams that 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.390
 it was an underestimation of the opponent or such 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.550
 relation to just 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.950
 the rival turned on the speed very well 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:14.350
 we controlled the ball 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.270
 tried to arrange them a little bit 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.479
 slow but got somewhere 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:22.690
 counterattack at the expense of content speed 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:26.020
 speed counterattack missed a goal I 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:27.820
 I do not think that there was such a 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.710
 relaxation some sort of break this 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.740
 everyone played just this one 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:35.799
 episode still maybe this one more 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.240
 episode we missed the opponent's attacks for 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:42.960
 account in whatever country then after all 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:46.340
 have taken their hands in different games 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:49.200
 controlled the ball attacking actions 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.479
 defense got younger in terms of what states 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.280
 already sick and mean playing strictly 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.830
 defense 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.360
 managed so to speak not forced myself 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.590
 to wait 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.300
 Today there was a noticeable pressure composition 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.040
 play those who did not go on the field 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.020
 start spare as far as you are satisfied 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.140
 dissatisfied with the actions of the team exactly 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:13.430
 Here in this composition 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:15.620
 well we are today in this game 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:20.060
 somewhere load distribution among those 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:22.060
 who played previous boy after all 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:25.810
 she just lay down 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.860
 so guys I think my measure 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.709
 preparedness 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:32.890
 pretty well played by those who are without 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:36.610
 practice game was but they can they 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:38.410
 can better just the lack of gaming 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.670
 practice still affected because 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.130
 what came out bye 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.130
 lazy 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:46.470
 the game flowed into the game and yet not 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.350
 so just not who have not played 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:52.340
 can say 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:54.680
 Veta replenish all the month after collection 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.640
 getting there to become today we gave them 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.320
 playing practice 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.090
 then he had them more 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.730
 confidence but a little start 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:05.240
 crumpled and there already everything was under 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:07.040
 control after sergey today 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:09.110
 it turned out to score 3 swords 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.490
 You can briefly describe exactly the actions 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.070
 that this team is acting individually 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:15.800
 action don't know this cup is always 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:17.540
 unpredictable how would know about something 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.330
 that the young team will fight 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.700
 the ambitious attitude keeps the more 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:25.520
 lost one of the most important thought 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:29.390
 during scored rehabilitated 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:31.760
 did the result rather usually used 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.170
 see you on the point of attack today 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.850
 you played on the flanks too it was 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:39.280
 coaching setup or was it yours 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:41.980
 let's say your decision is probably a whole like 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.810
 team action so moving 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:47.540
 specifically installation was not there 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:50.240
 flanks or somewhere else open say 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:52.820
 can you say that these are downtrodden 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.600
 goals and will compete scored goals 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:56.360
 championship 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:59.030
 Well, of course for the attacker is always important 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:02.440
 drink down to be in good shape of course 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.440
 always hope for the best
