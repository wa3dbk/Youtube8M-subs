good lead matchup here especially with
fake<00:00:46.800> out<00:00:46.980> pressure<00:00:47.610> so<00:00:47.879> I'm<00:00:47.969> going<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.149> mega

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
fake out pressure so I'm going to mega

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.209 
fake out pressure so I'm going to mega
evolve<00:00:48.420> here<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:49.079> I<00:00:49.440> know<00:00:49.500> that<00:00:49.770> Charles<00:00:50.010> arts

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
evolve here and I know that Charles arts

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.590 
evolve here and I know that Charles arts
most<00:00:50.340> likely<00:00:50.640> going<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:50.879> protect<00:00:51.239> because<00:00:51.480> it

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
most likely going to protect because it

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.610 
most likely going to protect because it
doesn't<00:00:51.780> want<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:51.960> get<00:00:52.050> faked<00:00:52.289> out<00:00:52.440> and

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
doesn't want to get faked out and

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.500 
doesn't want to get faked out and

anything<00:01:01.410> like<00:01:01.530> overheat<00:01:01.920> so<00:01:02.039> I<00:01:02.070> did<00:01:02.280> just<00:01:02.309> go

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
anything like overheat so I did just go

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.070 
anything like overheat so I did just go
for<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.760> fake<00:01:02.940> out<00:01:03.059> into<00:01:03.300> Charizard<00:01:03.600> because

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
for the fake out into Charizard because

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.359 
for the fake out into Charizard because
I<00:01:04.170> no<00:01:04.229> Garchomp<00:01:04.530> can't<00:01:04.920> really<00:01:05.070> do<00:01:05.189> anything

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
I no Garchomp can't really do anything

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.460 
I no Garchomp can't really do anything
to<00:01:06.180> either<00:01:06.390> kangaskhan<00:01:06.900> or<00:01:07.049> road<00:01:07.200> and<00:01:07.350> wash

dragon<00:01:08.280> cloud<00:01:08.460> doesn't<00:01:08.850> do<00:01:09.030> too<00:01:09.210> much<00:01:09.240> and

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
dragon cloud doesn't do too much and

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.600

Rotom<00:01:10.439> does<00:01:10.619> hit<00:01:10.830> its<00:01:10.979> willow<00:01:11.130> is<00:01:11.310> so<00:01:11.430> at<00:01:11.520> this

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
Rotom does hit its willow is so at this

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:12.800 
Rotom does hit its willow is so at this
point<00:01:11.790> I'm<00:01:11.970> really<00:01:12.210> hoping<00:01:12.450> that<00:01:12.630> it's<00:01:12.750> not

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
point I'm really hoping that it's not

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.020 
point I'm really hoping that it's not
long<00:01:13.020> berry<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:13.500> as<00:01:13.680> you<00:01:13.799> see<00:01:14.010> here<00:01:14.430> it's<00:01:14.850> not

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
long berry and as you see here it's not

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.370 
long berry and as you see here it's not
lon<00:01:15.210> beery<00:01:15.360> so<00:01:15.600> that's<00:01:15.750> huge<00:01:15.990> getting<00:01:16.320> a

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
lon beery so that's huge getting a

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.960

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
opponents part of course it's gonna lose

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.129

minus two special attack but the
trade-off<00:03:35.439> was<00:03:35.650> definitely<00:03:35.979> worth<00:03:36.099> it
