00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:39.280 
I'm this the first monkey ball that I'm

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.239 
I'm this the first monkey ball that I'm
working<00:00:39.550> on<00:00:39.640> and<00:00:39.969> so<00:00:40.690> it's<00:00:41.050> a<00:00:41.230> really<00:00:41.499> great<00:00:41.649> to

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:42.249 
working on and so it's a really great to

00:00:42.249 --> 00:00:44.399 
working on and so it's a really great to
be<00:00:42.339> doing<00:00:42.519> a<00:00:42.579> new<00:00:42.609> challenge<00:00:43.089> and<00:00:43.329> I'm<00:00:44.050> hoping

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:44.409 
be doing a new challenge and I'm hoping

00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:46.979 
be doing a new challenge and I'm hoping
to<00:00:44.499> bring<00:00:44.649> some<00:00:44.710> fresh<00:00:45.609> new<00:00:45.999> ideas<00:00:46.480> and<00:00:46.780> blood

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:46.989 
to bring some fresh new ideas and blood

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:53.189 
to bring some fresh new ideas and blood
to<00:00:47.140> the<00:00:47.229> project<00:00:51.569> the<00:00:52.569> biggest<00:00:52.809> difference

00:00:53.189 --> 00:00:53.199 
to the project the biggest difference

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:54.419 
to the project the biggest difference
from<00:00:53.319> previous<00:00:53.589> monkey<00:00:53.829> balls<00:00:54.010> is<00:00:54.159> you're<00:00:54.280> not

00:00:54.419 --> 00:00:54.429 
from previous monkey balls is you're not

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:55.739 
from previous monkey balls is you're not
using<00:00:54.550> your<00:00:54.760> hands<00:00:54.969> to<00:00:55.149> control<00:00:55.269> the<00:00:55.510> pitcher

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:55.749 
using your hands to control the pitcher

00:00:55.749 --> 00:00:57.479 
using your hands to control the pitcher
using<00:00:55.989> your<00:00:56.109> feet<00:00:56.289> and<00:00:56.589> while<00:00:57.010> using<00:00:57.309> the

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:57.489 
using your feet and while using the

00:00:57.489 --> 00:00:58.739 
using your feet and while using the
balance<00:00:57.729> board<00:00:57.879> the<00:00:58.030> control<00:00:58.269> of<00:00:58.389> your<00:00:58.539> feet

00:00:58.739 --> 00:00:58.749 
balance board the control of your feet

00:00:58.749 --> 00:01:00.959 
balance board the control of your feet
is<00:00:58.899> very<00:00:58.929> intuitive<00:00:59.729> actually<00:01:00.729> as<00:01:00.819> we're

00:01:00.959 --> 00:01:00.969 
is very intuitive actually as we're

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:03.270 
is very intuitive actually as we're
developing<00:01:01.089> the<00:01:01.449> game<00:01:01.569> we<00:01:01.809> found<00:01:02.079> that<00:01:02.440> it<00:01:03.129> was

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.280 
developing the game we found that it was

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.369 
developing the game we found that it was
often<00:01:03.429> more<00:01:03.729> difficult<00:01:03.789> than<00:01:04.390> we<00:01:04.870> anticipated

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:05.379 
often more difficult than we anticipated

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.100 
often more difficult than we anticipated
so<00:01:05.740> the<00:01:06.330> one<00:01:07.330> of<00:01:07.420> the<00:01:07.480> challenges<00:01:07.870> that<00:01:07.990> we've

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
so the one of the challenges that we've

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:09.870 
so the one of the challenges that we've
been<00:01:08.290> then<00:01:08.710> facing<00:01:09.100> is<00:01:09.220> balancing<00:01:09.820> the

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
been then facing is balancing the

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.300 
been then facing is balancing the
difficulty<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:11.470> so<00:01:11.800> we've<00:01:11.980> been<00:01:12.130> paying<00:01:12.250> a

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
difficulty and so we've been paying a

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:13.770 
difficulty and so we've been paying a
lot<00:01:12.430> of<00:01:12.460> attention<00:01:12.700> to<00:01:13.030> difficulty<00:01:13.540> and

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
lot of attention to difficulty and

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.270 
lot of attention to difficulty and
making<00:01:14.020> sure<00:01:14.170> that<00:01:14.380> that<00:01:14.890> we're<00:01:15.040> in<00:01:15.100> the<00:01:15.160> right

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
making sure that that we're in the right

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:23.400 
making sure that that we're in the right
place<00:01:20.010> so<00:01:21.180> specifically<00:01:22.180> we<00:01:22.990> found<00:01:23.200> that<00:01:23.320> in

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:23.410 
place so specifically we found that in

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:24.920 
place so specifically we found that in
the<00:01:23.500> past<00:01:23.530> when<00:01:23.860> monkey<00:01:24.160> ball<00:01:24.310> people's

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
the past when monkey ball people's

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.880 
the past when monkey ball people's
basically<00:01:25.930> your<00:01:26.020> improvement<00:01:26.440> was<00:01:26.560> kind<00:01:26.860> of

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
basically your improvement was kind of

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.430 
basically your improvement was kind of
on<00:01:27.010> a<00:01:27.040> smooth<00:01:27.790> curve<00:01:28.030> at<00:01:28.840> this<00:01:28.990> time<00:01:29.230> the

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:29.440 
on a smooth curve at this time the

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.140 
on a smooth curve at this time the
improvement<00:01:29.890> was<00:01:30.040> not<00:01:30.190> so<00:01:30.520> malleable<00:01:30.940> to<00:01:31.120> a

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:31.150 
improvement was not so malleable to a

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:32.670 
improvement was not so malleable to a
smooth<00:01:31.360> curve<00:01:31.630> and<00:01:31.930> people<00:01:32.230> if<00:01:32.350> you<00:01:32.470> play<00:01:32.650> a

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:32.680 
smooth curve and people if you play a

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.350 
smooth curve and people if you play a
lot<00:01:32.920> and<00:01:33.400> all<00:01:33.490> of<00:01:33.580> a<00:01:33.640> sudden<00:01:33.670> you'd<00:01:34.000> realize

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360 
lot and all of a sudden you'd realize

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.940 
lot and all of a sudden you'd realize
come<00:01:34.810> to<00:01:34.900> understand<00:01:35.260> things<00:01:35.410> better<00:01:35.500> and<00:01:35.860> so

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
come to understand things better and so

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.800 
come to understand things better and so
it's<00:01:36.100> more<00:01:36.220> sudden<00:01:36.610> like<00:01:37.120> stair<00:01:37.390> step<00:01:37.600> like

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
it's more sudden like stair step like

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.300 
it's more sudden like stair step like
improvements<00:01:38.290> rather<00:01:38.380> medicine<00:01:38.860> a<00:01:39.010> smooth

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
improvements rather medicine a smooth

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.210 
improvements rather medicine a smooth
curve<00:01:39.550> so<00:01:40.410> we<00:01:41.410> paid<00:01:41.560> a<00:01:41.590> lot<00:01:41.740> of<00:01:41.770> attention<00:01:41.890> to

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
curve so we paid a lot of attention to

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.360 
curve so we paid a lot of attention to
make<00:01:42.400> sure<00:01:42.430> that<00:01:42.730> the<00:01:43.060> levels<00:01:43.390> are<00:01:44.370> balanced

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:45.370 
make sure that the levels are balanced

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:46.620 
make sure that the levels are balanced
out

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
out

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
out
or<00:01:47.020> you<00:01:47.680> know<00:01:47.799> that<00:01:47.950> kind<00:01:48.130> of<00:01:48.159> learning<00:01:52.650> so

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:53.650 
or you know that kind of learning so

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.249 
or you know that kind of learning so
another<00:01:54.400> big<00:01:54.580> goal<00:01:54.970> of<00:01:55.119> the<00:01:55.630> project<00:01:56.170> this

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 
another big goal of the project this

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:58.140 
another big goal of the project this
time<00:01:56.440> around<00:01:56.680> is<00:01:57.280> to<00:01:57.460> have<00:01:57.580> families<00:01:57.940> playing

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:58.150 
time around is to have families playing

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.539 
time around is to have families playing
the<00:01:58.270> game<00:01:58.420> so<00:01:59.140> kind<00:01:59.470> of<00:01:59.560> what<00:01:59.710> we<00:01:59.890> are<00:01:59.920> our

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:00.549 
the game so kind of what we are our

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:02.780 
the game so kind of what we are our
picturing<00:02:00.940> with<00:02:01.060> co-op<00:02:01.299> is<00:02:01.630> having<00:02:01.960> a<00:02:02.110> child

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
picturing with co-op is having a child

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.950 
picturing with co-op is having a child
who's<00:02:03.790> on<00:02:04.240> the<00:02:04.360> balance<00:02:04.630> board<00:02:04.750> and

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
who's on the balance board and

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:05.999 
who's on the balance board and
controlling<00:02:05.290> the<00:02:05.350> monkey<00:02:05.560> playing<00:02:05.830> with

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:06.009 
controlling the monkey playing with

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:08.999 
controlling the monkey playing with
their<00:02:06.130> parents<00:02:06.549> who<00:02:06.840> are<00:02:07.840> basically<00:02:08.590> we're

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
their parents who are basically we're

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.930 
their parents who are basically we're
replacing<00:02:09.520> barriers<00:02:10.209> on<00:02:10.450> the<00:02:10.890> levels<00:02:11.890> and<00:02:12.069> the

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
replacing barriers on the levels and the

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.850 
replacing barriers on the levels and the
parent<00:02:13.660> or<00:02:13.810> whoever<00:02:14.110> else<00:02:14.200> is<00:02:14.470> that<00:02:14.620> helping

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
parent or whoever else is that helping

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.590 
parent or whoever else is that helping
out<00:02:15.010> would<00:02:15.220> be<00:02:15.340> in<00:02:15.550> charge<00:02:15.700> of<00:02:15.910> shooting<00:02:16.330> these

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
out would be in charge of shooting these

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.030 
out would be in charge of shooting these
barriers<00:02:16.959> and<00:02:16.989> clearing<00:02:17.410> them<00:02:17.500> away<00:02:17.709> and

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
barriers and clearing them away and

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.740 
barriers and clearing them away and
again<00:02:18.850> we<00:02:19.000> were<00:02:19.239> paying<00:02:19.420> a<00:02:19.480> lot<00:02:19.600> of<00:02:19.630> attention

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
again we were paying a lot of attention

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.330 
again we were paying a lot of attention
of<00:02:20.019> the<00:02:20.110> difficulty<00:02:20.530> to<00:02:20.650> make<00:02:20.680> sure<00:02:20.950> that<00:02:21.130> you

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
of the difficulty to make sure that you

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.699 
of the difficulty to make sure that you
know<00:02:21.459> it's<00:02:21.640> not<00:02:21.840> frustrating<00:02:22.840> and<00:02:23.019> it's<00:02:23.620> gonna

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
know it's not frustrating and it's gonna

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:27.530 
know it's not frustrating and it's gonna
be<00:02:23.860> fun<00:02:24.010> for<00:02:24.190> both<00:02:24.250> players

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.960 

so<00:02:28.540> there's<00:02:29.350> not<00:02:29.500> anything<00:02:30.280> like<00:02:30.400> Wii<00:02:30.730> Fit

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
so there's not anything like Wii Fit

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.780 
so there's not anything like Wii Fit
flight<00:02:31.269> content<00:02:31.950> specifically<00:02:32.950> but<00:02:33.340> you<00:02:33.640> are

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
flight content specifically but you are

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.220 
flight content specifically but you are
using<00:02:34.000> your<00:02:34.209> entire<00:02:34.390> body<00:02:34.630> to<00:02:34.900> control<00:02:35.050> the

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
using your entire body to control the

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.020 
using your entire body to control the
balance<00:02:35.500> board<00:02:35.709> and<00:02:36.190> so<00:02:36.580> we're<00:02:36.850> kind<00:02:36.940> of

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
balance board and so we're kind of

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.309 
balance board and so we're kind of
emphasizing<00:02:37.510> that<00:02:37.630> that<00:02:37.870> it<00:02:38.019> you<00:02:38.110> know<00:02:38.200> this

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
emphasizing that that it you know this

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:39.479 
emphasizing that that it you know this
is<00:02:38.380> where<00:02:38.560> this<00:02:38.709> is<00:02:38.830> definitely<00:02:39.130> focused<00:02:39.370> on

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
is where this is definitely focused on

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:42.059 
is where this is definitely focused on
more<00:02:39.819> fun<00:02:40.060> and<00:02:40.299> entertainment<00:02:40.810> but<00:02:41.739> we<00:02:41.890> think

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 
more fun and entertainment but we think

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:43.500 
more fun and entertainment but we think
that<00:02:42.190> you<00:02:42.610> know<00:02:42.730> you're<00:02:43.090> going<00:02:43.239> to<00:02:43.269> forget

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
that you know you're going to forget

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.020 
that you know you're going to forget
that<00:02:43.569> you<00:02:43.840> are<00:02:43.870> kind<00:02:44.560> of<00:02:44.709> exercising<00:02:45.340> you're

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
that you are kind of exercising you're

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.970 
that you are kind of exercising you're
kinda<00:02:46.269> burning<00:02:46.450> calories<00:02:46.660> and<00:02:47.560> as<00:02:47.799> you're

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
kinda burning calories and as you're

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:54.660

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.190 

the<00:02:55.300> simplicity<00:02:55.600> of<00:02:55.720> the<00:02:55.810> game<00:02:55.930> is<00:02:56.080> definitely

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
the simplicity of the game is definitely

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.210 
the simplicity of the game is definitely
a<00:02:56.620> lot<00:02:56.830> of<00:02:56.980> strengths<00:02:57.340> and<00:02:57.540> the<00:02:59.010> leverage<00:03:00.010> shot

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
a lot of strengths and the leverage shot

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.940 
a lot of strengths and the leverage shot
different<00:03:00.850> platforms<00:03:01.330> so<00:03:01.680> wherever<00:03:02.680> we<00:03:02.920> think

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
different platforms so wherever we think

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.500 
different platforms so wherever we think
it's<00:03:03.190> going<00:03:03.280> to<00:03:03.370> work<00:03:03.490> well<00:03:03.670> people<00:03:04.150> would

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
it's going to work well people would

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:05.910 
it's going to work well people would
like<00:03:04.660> it<00:03:04.840> we<00:03:04.870> definitely<00:03:05.380> want<00:03:05.530> it<00:03:05.680> to<00:03:05.770> give<00:03:05.890> a

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
like it we definitely want it to give a

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.190 
like it we definitely want it to give a
