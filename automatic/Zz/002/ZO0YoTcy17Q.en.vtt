that goes on the pv ok it's a little bit

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.310 
that goes on the pv ok it's a little bit
smaller<00:01:37.180> if<00:01:38.180> you<00:01:38.300> look<00:01:38.450> right<00:01:38.630> there<00:01:38.870> this<00:01:39.200> is

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
smaller if you look right there this is

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.740 
smaller if you look right there this is
too<00:01:39.500> big<00:01:39.740> but<00:01:40.580> then<00:01:40.760> I<00:01:40.790> started<00:01:41.120> looking<00:01:41.360> over

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750
