00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.289
 bd 73 jobs we love a lot this thalassemia 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.960
 because ben listen in september 2009 with job etc so much for 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.259
 a public price of 299 euros 

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:15.529
 and in addition my part 

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:18.789
 all that so obviously you have everything you've got that we 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:19.579
 learn 

00:00:19.579 --> 00:00:22.769
 which is interesting to know that we have a hue video processing 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.769
 with the processor ph l 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.279
 this type of action guaranteed impeccable image quality from 24 dec to 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:35.260
 europe because you have internet connectivity with the viera cast you could 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.680
 access videos on youtube to your photos on picasa but you can also 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:40.750
 access to art 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.720
 all your files divx xvid photo jp music hall p3 on a usb key 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.870
 the little usb port there is there next to the portal and snipers on 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.750
 the port sd card you can use the same contents 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.680
 as well as videos indeed hp mp2 so 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.660
 if in the end your camcorder at the ceni will fight no pictures not enough 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:58.300
 unique 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.600
 for photos and videos you can find everything directly on 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.780
 this sector is really very practical next to that 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.450
 obviously beyond 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.630
 the usual functions the purpose of washing the crude with bonus view 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.460
 which allows you to access a beginning of dismantling and dynamic 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:13.770
 exchanged on the internet 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.570
 and if these heads traps but he and his co-winner and if blocking the content 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.960
 dynamic so I'm looking at spiderman% 3 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.950
 and I see spiderman's mom April 4 to download on the internet 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.840
 automatically his trailer how is he going to do 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.410
 Well it's very simple 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.190
 you plug into a cable 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.490
 they allow in this little catch of your box 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.240
 and up to this apple device the viewer is automatically it's going 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.840
 download everything here impeccable 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.140
 for the side for the community you have the output hdmi 1 3 times here 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.810
 finally the fourth type dye they all try all of them all 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.610
 themis standards 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:49.970
 from lying 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.320
 a component output a stereo audio output an optical audio output 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.370
 obviously everything is planned so that you can plug everything you 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:00.710
 need it's a very fancy format as you can see the product by 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:01.480
 the child 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.410
 paris consume much less than its predecessors is also less than 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.050
 noise is a very very good little product that we recommend the dr the 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.540
 early 60's in overproduction of solutions 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:11.170
