00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.430 
of I would I would say a good 10 to 15
miles<00:02:49.970> away<00:02:50.210> from<00:02:50.360> the<00:02:50.600> coastline<00:02:50.960> so<00:02:51.320> we

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
miles away from the coastline so we

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:52.870 
miles away from the coastline so we
don't<00:02:51.590> have<00:02:51.710> to<00:02:51.860> really<00:02:52.100> worry<00:02:52.340> about<00:02:52.460> that

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
don't have to really worry about that

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.460
