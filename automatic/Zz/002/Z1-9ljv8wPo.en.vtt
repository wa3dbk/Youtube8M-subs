00:00:36.299 --> 00:00:36.309 
button so that's now going to connect to

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:40.799 
button so that's now going to connect to
the<00:00:36.789> cell<00:00:37.120> you<00:00:37.210> like<00:00:37.500> server<00:00:38.850> and<00:00:39.850> prompt<00:00:40.480> for

00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:40.809 
the cell you like server and prompt for

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:43.590 
the cell you like server and prompt for
the<00:00:41.609> application<00:00:42.609> particular<00:00:43.210> to<00:00:43.510> this

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:43.600 
the application particular to this

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.639 
the application particular to this
device<00:00:44.579> usually<00:00:45.579> it<00:00:45.819> takes<00:00:45.969> around<00:00:46.239> about<00:00:46.960> 10

00:00:47.639 --> 00:00:47.649 
device usually it takes around about 10

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:49.739 
device usually it takes around about 10
20<00:00:47.949> 30<00:00:48.309> seconds<00:00:48.879> for<00:00:49.089> it<00:00:49.179> connects<00:00:49.449> to<00:00:49.510> its

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:49.749 
20 30 seconds for it connects to its

00:00:49.749 --> 00:00:52.619 
20 30 seconds for it connects to its
connection<00:00:49.989> to<00:00:50.850> authenticate<00:00:51.850> etc<00:00:52.420> so<00:00:52.600> let's

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:52.629 
connection to authenticate etc so let's

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:56.369 
connection to authenticate etc so let's
just<00:00:53.019> hold<00:00:53.499> on<00:00:53.679> for<00:00:53.710> a<00:00:53.859> second<00:00:54.899> and<00:00:55.899> then<00:00:56.199> we

00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:56.379 
just hold on for a second and then we

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:02.419 
just hold on for a second and then we
can<00:00:56.739> get<00:00:57.550> that<00:00:57.729> downloaded<00:00:58.300> onto<00:00:58.449> the<00:00:58.659> phone

00:01:02.419 --> 00:01:02.429 

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:07.980 

should<00:01:03.429> not<00:01:03.639> be<00:01:03.760> long<00:01:04.030> now<00:01:04.059> that<00:01:05.790> is<00:01:06.990> 20

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
should not be long now that is 20

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.730 
should not be long now that is 20
seconds<00:01:09.630> it<00:01:10.630> does<00:01:10.870> depend<00:01:11.200> on<00:01:11.290> the<00:01:11.409> network

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
seconds it does depend on the network

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.250 
seconds it does depend on the network
speed<00:01:12.040> as<00:01:12.220> well<00:01:12.400> I<00:01:12.460> mean<00:01:12.700> if<00:01:12.850> you're<00:01:13.260> currently

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:14.260 
speed as well I mean if you're currently

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.240 
speed as well I mean if you're currently
on<00:01:14.500> 3G<00:01:14.980> surprisingly<00:01:15.610> enough<00:01:17.100> which<00:01:18.100> is

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
on 3G surprisingly enough which is

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:19.740 
on 3G surprisingly enough which is
usually<00:01:18.580> quite<00:01:18.820> quick<00:01:19.060> and<00:01:19.240> then<00:01:19.330> we<00:01:19.390> go<00:01:19.540> looks

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
usually quite quick and then we go looks

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.840 
usually quite quick and then we go looks
downloading<00:01:20.410> that's<00:01:20.920> downloaded<00:01:21.520> and

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
downloading that's downloaded and

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.610 
downloading that's downloaded and
install<00:01:22.750> this<00:01:22.900> so<00:01:23.050> we're<00:01:23.140> going<00:01:23.230> to<00:01:23.290> click<00:01:23.440> on

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:23.620 
install this so we're going to click on

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:31.260 
install this so we're going to click on
the<00:01:23.710> intercept<00:01:24.070> button<00:01:29.850> now<00:01:30.850> as<00:01:30.970> you<00:01:31.090> can<00:01:31.210> see

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
the intercept button now as you can see

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.260 
the intercept button now as you can see
it<00:01:31.750> says<00:01:31.960> on<00:01:32.110> the<00:01:32.200> screen<00:01:32.470> then<00:01:33.010> it's<00:01:33.220> that<00:01:34.000> the

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
it says on the screen then it's that the

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.330 
it says on the screen then it's that the
open<00:01:34.780> the<00:01:34.840> file<00:01:35.050> now<00:01:35.230> get<00:01:35.980> the<00:01:36.100> files

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
open the file now get the files

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:37.920 
open the file now get the files
downloaded<00:01:36.790> to<00:01:36.910> game<00:01:37.120> so<00:01:37.390> that's<00:01:37.510> actually

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930 
downloaded to game so that's actually

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.630 
downloaded to game so that's actually
installed<00:01:38.260> it<00:01:38.410> in<00:01:38.500> the<00:01:38.560> games<00:01:38.800> folder<00:01:39.160> so<00:01:39.490> it's

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
installed it in the games folder so it's

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.040 
installed it in the games folder so it's
quite<00:01:39.790> important<00:01:40.210> to<00:01:40.270> remember<00:01:40.450> food<00:01:40.750> for<00:01:40.990> the

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.050 
quite important to remember food for the

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.350 
quite important to remember food for the
future<00:01:41.470> in<00:01:42.250> case<00:01:42.400> you<00:01:42.580> actually<00:01:42.730> need<00:01:43.000> to<00:01:43.030> find

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
future in case you actually need to find

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:44.790 
future in case you actually need to find
it<00:01:43.510> so<00:01:43.690> we've<00:01:44.140> got<00:01:44.260> the<00:01:44.350> backup<00:01:44.500> and<00:01:44.650> restore

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:44.800 
it so we've got the backup and restore

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.480 
it so we've got the backup and restore
software<00:01:45.160> here<00:01:45.520> is<00:01:45.820> click<00:01:45.970> on<00:01:46.120> start<00:01:47.160> ok<00:01:48.160> click

so<00:01:50.170> we're<00:01:50.260> going<00:01:50.350> to<00:01:50.440> put<00:01:50.590> in<00:01:50.680> the<00:01:50.830> password

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
so we're going to put in the password

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.390 
so we're going to put in the password
because<00:01:52.990> it<00:01:53.080> comes<00:01:53.290> with<00:01:53.410> the<00:01:53.500> these<00:01:54.040> with<00:01:54.280> the

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.300 

then<00:02:08.170> once<00:02:08.350> we've<00:02:08.590> entered<00:02:08.920> the<00:02:08.950> password

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
then once we've entered the password

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.630 
then once we've entered the password
here<00:02:09.910> and<00:02:10.030> click<00:02:10.330> the<00:02:10.450> connect<00:02:10.780> button<00:02:11.640> ok

it's<00:02:12.850> that's<00:02:13.090> now<00:02:13.420> going<00:02:14.020> to<00:02:14.200> connect<00:02:14.470> sources

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
it's that's now going to connect sources

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.870 
it's that's now going to connect sources
yes<00:02:15.130> yes<00:02:15.370> we<00:02:15.550> want<00:02:15.730> to<00:02:15.790> do<00:02:16.000> that<00:02:16.180> so<00:02:17.220> that's<00:02:18.220> now

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
yes yes we want to do that so that's now

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.010 
yes yes we want to do that so that's now
going<00:02:19.780> to<00:02:19.840> connect<00:02:21.450> to<00:02:22.450> people<00:02:22.690> that<00:02:22.780> a<00:02:22.810> couple

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
going to connect to people that a couple

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:24.449 
going to connect to people that a couple
of<00:02:23.170> circles<00:02:23.530> there<00:02:23.739> we<00:02:23.800> go<00:02:23.950> so<00:02:24.160> now<00:02:24.190> we're

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
of circles there we go so now we're

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:26.220 
of circles there we go so now we're
completely<00:02:24.610> logged<00:02:25.150> in<00:02:25.360> so<00:02:25.600> that's<00:02:25.750> so<00:02:26.050> we're

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
completely logged in so that's so we're

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.780 
completely logged in so that's so we're
now<00:02:26.319> among<00:02:26.590> things<00:02:26.739> that<00:02:26.920> city<00:02:27.130> folks<00:02:27.340> open<00:02:27.670> as
