hi<00:00:00.630> guys<00:00:00.930> so<00:00:01.319> today<00:00:01.350> I<00:00:02.149> receive<00:00:03.149> my<00:00:05.089> Apollo<00:00:06.089> off

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
hi guys so today I receive my Apollo off

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.900 
hi guys so today I receive my Apollo off
from<00:00:07.109> Westcott<00:00:09.740> first<00:00:10.740> instance<00:00:11.250> I<00:00:11.370> saw<00:00:11.639> oh

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
from Westcott first instance I saw oh

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.890 
from Westcott first instance I saw oh
it's<00:00:12.150> probably<00:00:12.960> broken<00:00:14.089> because<00:00:15.089> the<00:00:15.150> pennant

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
it's probably broken because the pennant

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.189 
it's probably broken because the pennant
side<00:00:16.550> seems<00:00:17.550> to<00:00:17.789> be<00:00:18.000> a<00:00:18.029> little<00:00:18.270> bit<00:00:18.480> sure<00:00:18.840> but

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
side seems to be a little bit sure but

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.660 
side seems to be a little bit sure but
in<00:00:19.560> fact<00:00:19.980> this<00:00:20.250> is<00:00:20.460> very<00:00:20.490> logical<00:00:21.109> as<00:00:22.460> you<00:00:23.460> will

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
in fact this is very logical as you will

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:31.609 
in fact this is very logical as you will
see<00:00:27.560> when<00:00:28.560> we<00:00:28.619> put<00:00:29.070> on<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.810> diffuser<00:00:30.810> panel<00:00:31.230> we

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
see when we put on the diffuser panel we

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.639 
see when we put on the diffuser panel we
will<00:00:34.070> have<00:00:35.070> no<00:00:35.309> need<00:00:35.340> for<00:00:35.550> on<00:00:36.149> a<00:00:36.180> pencil<00:00:36.930> in

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
will have no need for on a pencil in

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.630 
will have no need for on a pencil in
first<00:00:38.280> instance<00:00:38.579> it<00:00:40.100> looks<00:00:41.100> a<00:00:41.219> little<00:00:41.340> bit

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
first instance it looks a little bit

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.330 
first instance it looks a little bit
weird<00:00:41.879> so<00:00:42.360> I<00:00:42.390> use<00:00:42.719> a<00:00:42.750> studio<00:00:43.290> strobe<00:00:43.800> for<00:00:44.190> it

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
weird so I use a studio strobe for it

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.290 
weird so I use a studio strobe for it
here<00:00:44.969> I<00:00:45.530> just<00:00:46.530> go<00:00:46.739> with<00:00:46.980> this<00:00:47.250> opening<00:00:47.820> above

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
here I just go with this opening above

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:56.270 
here I just go with this opening above
and<00:00:49.140> then<00:00:49.950> I<00:00:51.469> just<00:00:52.469> put<00:00:53.399> it<00:00:54.890> put<00:00:55.890> it<00:00:55.949> through

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
and then I just put it put it through

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.369 
and then I just put it put it through
yeah<00:00:58.430> think<00:00:59.430> this<00:00:59.730> is<00:00:59.940> right<00:01:00.239> so<00:01:00.629> we<00:01:00.809> have<00:01:01.050> this

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
yeah think this is right so we have this

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.630 
yeah think this is right so we have this
very<00:01:02.280> high<00:01:02.420> reflective<00:01:03.420> material<00:01:04.110> here<00:01:04.640> what

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
very high reflective material here what

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.620 
very high reflective material here what
is<00:01:05.729> better<00:01:05.939> than<00:01:06.299> with<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:08.030> soft<00:01:09.030> boxes<00:01:09.450> I

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
is better than with the soft boxes I

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.480 
is better than with the soft boxes I
already<00:01:09.990> have<00:01:10.320> so<00:01:10.680> in<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:10.950> first<00:01:11.189> instance

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
already have so in the first instance

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.740 
already have so in the first instance
you<00:01:11.760> could<00:01:11.970> say<00:01:12.180> are<00:01:12.390> now<00:01:12.600> this<00:01:12.810> is<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:12.990> heck<00:01:13.530> of

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
you could say are now this is a heck of

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:20.859 
you could say are now this is a heck of
expensive<00:01:15.750> umbrella<00:01:16.200> but<00:01:16.650> it's<00:01:17.030> not<00:01:18.030> it's

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:30.429 

very<00:01:21.869> affordable<00:01:22.350> soft<00:01:23.009> pours<00:01:23.750> /<00:01:26.750> fakta<00:01:27.750> bank

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:30.439 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:37.730 

so<00:01:31.439> you<00:01:31.500> can<00:01:31.860> close<00:01:32.220> this<00:01:35.030> suppose<00:01:36.030> I<00:01:36.409> would<00:01:37.409> I

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
so you can close this suppose I would I

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.190 
so you can close this suppose I would I
would<00:01:38.400> have<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:38.729> recommend<00:01:39.090> a<00:01:39.570> recommendation

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
would have to recommend a recommendation

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.679 
would have to recommend a recommendation
to<00:01:40.950> make<00:01:41.100> it<00:01:41.310> a<00:01:41.400> little<00:01:41.640> bit<00:01:41.820> better<00:01:42.090> so<00:01:42.509> that

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
to make it a little bit better so that

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.280 
to make it a little bit better so that
the<00:01:43.700> so<00:01:44.700> that<00:01:44.880> these<00:01:45.060> zippers<00:01:45.479> would<00:01:46.110> be

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
the so that these zippers would be

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.100 
the so that these zippers would be
easier<00:01:46.619> to<00:01:46.649> close<00:01:47.130> from<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.549> inside<00:01:48.180> so<00:01:48.780> for

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
easier to close from the inside so for

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.700 
easier to close from the inside so for
my<00:01:49.259> for<00:01:49.860> my<00:01:50.000> proposed<00:01:51.000> now<00:01:51.329> I<00:01:51.659> want<00:01:51.899> to<00:01:51.990> tilt<00:01:52.409> it

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
my for my proposed now I want to tilt it

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.670 
my for my proposed now I want to tilt it
so<00:01:53.490> I<00:01:53.520> leave<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:55.880> lower<00:01:56.880> side<00:01:57.869> of<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:58.140> zipper

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
so I leave the lower side of the zipper

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.840 
so I leave the lower side of the zipper
open<00:01:59.130> and<00:02:00.079> then<00:02:01.079> I'm<00:02:01.229> going<00:02:01.409> to

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
open and then I'm going to

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.920 
open and then I'm going to
in<00:02:03.850> store<00:02:04.330> the<00:02:05.580> diffuser<00:02:06.580> panel<00:02:06.940> the<00:02:07.690> night

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
in store the diffuser panel the night

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:12.059 
in store the diffuser panel the night
thing<00:02:08.289> here<00:02:08.679> is<00:02:08.950> that<00:02:08.979> the<00:02:09.840> scripts<00:02:10.840> on<00:02:11.650> the

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
thing here is that the scripts on the

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.270 
thing here is that the scripts on the
inside<00:02:12.490> of<00:02:12.520> the<00:02:13.030> op<00:02:13.390> are<00:02:14.110> broad<00:02:14.650> enough<00:02:14.680> so

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
inside of the op are broad enough so

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.300 
inside of the op are broad enough so
that<00:02:15.310> you<00:02:15.610> can<00:02:15.880> put<00:02:16.569> your<00:02:16.990> diffuser<00:02:17.530> panel<00:02:17.860> on

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
that you can put your diffuser panel on

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.410 
that you can put your diffuser panel on
the<00:02:18.730> edge<00:02:18.910> or<00:02:19.420> a<00:02:20.310> little<00:02:21.310> bit<00:02:21.430> more<00:02:21.459> insight<00:02:22.209> so

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
the edge or a little bit more insight so

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.400 
the edge or a little bit more insight so
that<00:02:22.450> your<00:02:22.840> also<00:02:23.290> can<00:02:23.940> install<00:02:24.940> the<00:02:25.720> grip<00:02:26.080> very

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
that your also can install the grip very

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:32.100 
that your also can install the grip very
easy<00:02:27.280> if<00:02:27.910> you<00:02:28.390> have<00:02:29.319> one<00:02:29.680> or<00:02:30.220> if<00:02:30.910> you<00:02:31.690> like<00:02:31.900> to

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
easy if you have one or if you like to

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.690 
easy if you have one or if you like to
fairly<00:02:32.500> light<00:02:33.510> as<00:02:34.510> I<00:02:34.810> like<00:02:35.140> this<00:02:35.860> is<00:02:36.130> one<00:02:36.670> of

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
fairly light as I like this is one of

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.680 
fairly light as I like this is one of
the<00:02:37.030> reasons<00:02:37.570> that<00:02:37.840> I<00:02:38.080> could<00:02:38.560> chase<00:02:38.890> this<00:02:39.280> one

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
the reasons that I could chase this one

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:57.309 
the reasons that I could chase this one
because<00:02:40.690> you<00:02:40.900> have<00:02:41.170> this<00:02:41.440> black<00:02:44.760> rim

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:57.319 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:03.449 

and<00:02:59.739> then<00:03:00.739> you<00:03:00.980> don't<00:03:01.670> need<00:03:02.090> a<00:03:02.120> goggle<00:03:02.810> dip

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
and then you don't need a goggle dip

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:08.679 
and then you don't need a goggle dip
that<00:03:04.459> soon<00:03:06.129> so<00:03:07.129> as<00:03:07.280> you<00:03:07.400> can<00:03:07.579> see<00:03:07.939> this<00:03:08.150> is<00:03:08.359> very

00:03:08.679 --> 00:03:08.689 
that soon so as you can see this is very

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:13.809 
that soon so as you can see this is very
fast<00:03:09.260> installed<00:03:11.560> was<00:03:12.560> the<00:03:12.739> other<00:03:12.890> soap<00:03:13.219> box<00:03:13.549> I

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:13.819 
fast installed was the other soap box I

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:17.050 
fast installed was the other soap box I
have<00:03:14.000> I<00:03:14.180> have<00:03:14.390> the<00:03:14.510> problem<00:03:15.079> when<00:03:15.620> I<00:03:15.890> going<00:03:16.760> on

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
have I have the problem when I going on

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:23.429 
have I have the problem when I going on
a<00:03:17.329> location<00:03:17.989> shoot<00:03:18.019> I<00:03:18.909> never<00:03:19.909> take<00:03:20.629> them<00:03:20.659> I

00:03:23.429 --> 00:03:23.439 

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:30.789 

never<00:03:24.439> take<00:03:25.280> them<00:03:25.310> apart<00:03:25.639> because<00:03:29.799> the

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:30.799 
never take them apart because the

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:33.729 
never take them apart because the
materials<00:03:31.519> use<00:03:31.849> are<00:03:32.180> so<00:03:32.450> strong<00:03:32.959> if<00:03:33.290> you<00:03:33.439> bend

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
materials use are so strong if you bend

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:36.190 
materials use are so strong if you bend
these<00:03:34.040> metal<00:03:34.579> things<00:03:34.819> to<00:03:35.269> get<00:03:35.480> them<00:03:35.720> into

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
these metal things to get them into

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.030 
these metal things to get them into
shape<00:03:37.000> they<00:03:38.000> will<00:03:38.269> beat<00:03:39.139> you<00:03:39.349> up<00:03:39.379> you<00:03:39.859> will

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
shape they will beat you up you will

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.069 
shape they will beat you up you will
have<00:03:40.069> a<00:03:40.250> black<00:03:40.579> eye<00:03:40.879> if<00:03:41.090> you<00:03:41.269> don't<00:03:41.569> be<00:03:41.810> careful

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:42.079 
have a black eye if you don't be careful

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:51.119 
have a black eye if you don't be careful
so<00:03:42.879> this<00:03:43.879> has<00:03:44.090> enormous<00:03:46.450> light<00:03:47.450> and<00:03:49.629> I'm

00:03:51.119 --> 00:03:51.129 
so this has enormous light and I'm

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:54.759 
so this has enormous light and I'm
looking<00:03:52.129> forward<00:03:52.519> to<00:03:52.579> shoot<00:03:52.939> with<00:03:53.209> it<00:03:53.739> when<00:03:54.739> I

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:54.769 
looking forward to shoot with it when I

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:59.050 
looking forward to shoot with it when I
look<00:03:55.340> at<00:03:55.489> the<00:03:55.669> build<00:03:55.939> quality<00:03:56.209> I<00:03:58.060> personally

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
look at the build quality I personally

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.280 
look at the build quality I personally
find<00:03:59.359> that<00:03:59.689> the<00:04:00.370> stitching<00:04:01.370> could<00:04:02.090> be<00:04:02.959> a

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
find that the stitching could be a

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:08.129 
find that the stitching could be a
little<00:04:03.709> bit<00:04:03.859> better<00:04:04.780> but<00:04:05.889> it<00:04:06.889> will<00:04:07.099> do<00:04:07.489> the<00:04:07.639> job

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:08.139 
little bit better but it will do the job

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:12.430 
little bit better but it will do the job
so<00:04:09.139> I<00:04:09.169> will<00:04:09.620> show<00:04:10.489> you<00:04:10.699> some<00:04:11.090> images<00:04:11.599> very<00:04:11.989> soon
