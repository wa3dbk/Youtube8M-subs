00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:20.210
 And then I'll bring you a 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:26.989
 review of the phone 77 x game em cave manos 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:31.419
 of genius a look in the sound box 

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:34.550
 virtual 7.1 that is not real it simulates 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:42.790
 but on the other the reviews made and the 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:45.860
 my what I could feel is very good 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:50.960
 usually other brands as hostile 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:57.760
 series reiser something like they did 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:57.760
 this is now the innovating genius too. 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.890
 pretty box 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:14.299
 the gold-plated sbt also the microphone 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:16.640
 it is unidirectional and does not 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:19.940
 that neither of eg steel series 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:22.940
 siberia v2 I have but he is very 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.590
 well I tested the quality of it is great and 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:28.789
 When is he up and legislative? 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:31.549
 as the picture shows and other 

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:37.220
 features it also helps to 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:39.470
 Here some head leaves do not have it. 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.330
 but most of them have this is great 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:45.050
 he has something very interesting that 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:47.000
 it is a vibration system he grabs it 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.679
 pregnant music and makes a vibration with 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.479
 It's like a loudspeaker. 

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:51.229
 even a subwoofer anything from the 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:53.659
 type 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:56.300
 and I found it incredible and the control of 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:58.429
 its volume in him is in it 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:03.979
 different from others is that the handset on 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:07.069
 cable and have a light years and stay 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:09.860
 and when you are using 

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:17.540
 some using an application on the computer 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:19.459
 that uses the handset it blinks and 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:23.900
 here ahead of the box are back 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:30.730
 have one from the factory just to take a look 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:30.730
 the other party's handset 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.270
 and open the box itself 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:57.560
 I found this very interesting idea of them 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:59.830
 to have made a phone to play was this orc 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:03.530
 for game 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:07.120
 some reviews even on American websites 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:10.760
 they compared it with a leaf from the region 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:14.440
 everyone says they are the best and 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:17.540
 this comparison also entered here 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:20.200
 it comes in the pack I found it a lot 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:26.290
 beautiful and very comfortable 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:33.580
 the gold-plated sbt had said 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:33.580
 it has the gtx game symbol that is this 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.050
 here the volume control 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:45.500
 the levezinho and oled is only on this side and the 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:50.800
 vibration system can activate and 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:50.800
 disable when you want to look on the handset 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:59.830
 and one thing that almost can not really 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:59.830
 perceive his microphone 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:08.470
 so it is connected and above this 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:08.470
 height it turns off 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:22.900
 I found very amazing he has he 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:27.910
 space for his ear is very large 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:29.810
 You can fit here according to the head 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:35.410
 He is very good at listening to music. 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:35.410
 also very comfortable here is foam 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:43.910
 he is very inflexible is also a little 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.310
 heavier than other headphones but I 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:47.780
 I did not see any problem in that being a 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:50.660
 headset 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.880
 finishing his color he is perfect is 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:55.910
 perfect 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:58.789
 I found it very good for the price that I 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:02.360
 it's on sale today the one I bought 

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:05.870
 by 240 I thought it was great 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:07.520
 the money very well that foam that is 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:09.350
 great 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.010
 say that comparing how it is due to 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:14.960
 two 

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:17.030
 This one I found much better 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:19.669
 to play and to the serial movie 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:21.950
 music the vibration system it 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:25.520
 works more heavily even then more 

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:27.139
 to electronic beat drum 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.320
 all that ends up leaving was better 

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:29.320
 still 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:36.680
 and that's what I hope you liked 

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:39.020
 still reviewed something quick and simple and 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:45.070
 if you want a phone for game 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:45.070
 I advise this very good phone spoke
