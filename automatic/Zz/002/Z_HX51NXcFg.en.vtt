00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.380
 With a lamb this one made the Kia Rio its exotic model name 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:08.989
 so far little honor 

00:00:08.989 --> 00:00:12.029
 but that changes in the new edition thoroughly 

00:00:12.029 --> 00:00:15.649
 Nokia promises European sophistication and Korean freshness and 

00:00:15.649 --> 00:00:18.999
 has southern flair 

00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:22.439
 striking optical details are the grille in the so-called tigers 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.529
 outside log and the pronounced wedge shape 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.529
 In addition, the optional device dictation case does not come 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:34.110
 The wheelbase is at the new Rio with two meters 57 7 inches longer than the 

00:00:34.109 --> 00:00:35.320
 predecessor 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.540
 The result is a larger space with a trunk volume 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.880
 of 292 liters 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.260
 by folding down the split backrests creates an almost level 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:45.180
 load area 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.760
 for 390 liters of luggage 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.310
 in length, Dario grows by five inches to 4 feet 5 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.510
 so that the width is two inches to a meter 72 instead 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.070
 The car is slightly flatter than before 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.600
 Both engines are initially two gasoline and two diesel to choose from 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.810
 Car lovers can be between Bavaria with 85 or 109 hp 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.380
 Spar quit his once-liter diesel with 70 hp and a co2 emission 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.460
 of 85 grams per kilometer 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:17.770
 that's a record 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.140
 the consumption is only 3 2 times 2 liters per 100 kilometers and thus under 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.570
 the values â€‹â€‹of all diesels currently in Europe in the market 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.080
 the larger diesel makes 90 hp 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.520
 Optionally, a start-stop system is used up for all units 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.200
 a new powerful Tomo petrol with 1 grief 2 liter capacity and 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.409
 direct injection 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.409
 Roth offered from 2012 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.750
 Especially much attention has the stage space of the new image values â€‹â€‹here 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.570
 here processed and used materials are significantly better than before 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.470
 An eye-catcher are the smart toggle switches in the center console 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.420
 for the Rio many extras from higher classes such as a heated 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.799
 Be available steering wheel 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:13.799
 the new generation starts in Europe as a three and five-door 

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:19.749
 the five-door and in the fall of 2011 to the dealers of the three-door follows 

00:02:19.749 --> 00:02:22.749
 Early 2012 

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:26.809
