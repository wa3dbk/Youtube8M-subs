00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.170 
there and some more little small
detailing<00:01:37.460> which<00:01:37.580> you<00:01:37.670> can't<00:01:37.850> really<00:01:37.970> see

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
detailing which you can't really see

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.060 
detailing which you can't really see
that<00:01:38.300> well<00:01:38.450> got<00:01:39.050> some<00:01:39.320> believe<00:01:39.830> there's<00:01:40.010> a

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
that well got some believe there's a

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.650 
that well got some believe there's a
carrying<00:01:40.490> handle<00:01:40.520> right<00:01:41.030> there<00:01:41.240> and<00:01:41.420> there's

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:41.660 
carrying handle right there and there's

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.840 
carrying handle right there and there's
also<00:01:41.840> a<00:01:42.020> little<00:01:42.770> handle<00:01:43.130> that<00:01:43.250> opens<00:01:43.550> up<00:01:43.700> the

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
also a little handle that opens up the

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.630 
also a little handle that opens up the
little<00:01:44.150> part<00:01:45.140> where<00:01:45.320> you<00:01:45.440> reload<00:01:45.890> the<00:01:45.920> rocket

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
little part where you reload the rocket

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.460 
little part where you reload the rocket
launcher<00:01:46.880> itself<00:01:47.210> but<00:01:47.450> you<00:01:47.990> can<00:01:48.110> actually<00:01:48.230> see

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
launcher itself but you can actually see

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.140 
launcher itself but you can actually see
the<00:01:48.680> barrels<00:01:49.070> of<00:01:49.190> the<00:01:49.220> rocket<00:01:49.550> launcher<00:01:49.850> on

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.150 
the barrels of the rocket launcher on

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.260 
the barrels of the rocket launcher on
both<00:01:50.330> sides<00:01:50.630> is<00:01:51.050> a<00:01:51.080> slit<00:01:51.470> going<00:01:51.740> down<00:01:51.890> the

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
both sides is a slit going down the

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.120 
both sides is a slit going down the
actual<00:01:53.270> sector<00:01:53.870> they're<00:01:54.050> dividing<00:01:54.860> up<00:01:54.980> the

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
actual sector they're dividing up the

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:56.440 
actual sector they're dividing up the
two<00:01:55.310> barrels<00:01:55.730> which<00:01:55.910> is<00:01:56.060> really<00:01:56.330> nice

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
two barrels which is really nice

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.240 
two barrels which is really nice
actually<00:01:56.810> got<00:01:57.590> the<00:01:57.740> handles<00:01:58.100> and<00:01:58.220> everything

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
actually got the handles and everything

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.040 
actually got the handles and everything
and<00:01:58.730> of<00:01:58.820> course<00:01:59.000> you<00:01:59.150> got<00:01:59.300> black<00:01:59.570> and<00:01:59.630> Gray's

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.050 
and of course you got black and Gray's

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:01.540 
and of course you got black and Gray's
mixed<00:02:00.470> together<00:02:00.560> which<00:02:00.950> just<00:02:01.160> looked<00:02:01.340> really

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:01.550 
mixed together which just looked really

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.210 
mixed together which just looked really
nice<00:02:01.990> so<00:02:02.990> that<00:02:03.140> is<00:02:03.290> the<00:02:03.470> brand<00:02:03.680> new<00:02:03.860> rocket

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
nice so that is the brand new rocket

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.680 
nice so that is the brand new rocket
launcher<00:02:04.490> pretty<00:02:04.760> cool<00:02:04.910> a<00:02:04.970> new<00:02:05.150> weapon<00:02:05.480> it's

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:05.690 
launcher pretty cool a new weapon it's

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.570 
launcher pretty cool a new weapon it's
actually<00:02:06.050> actually<00:02:06.500> I<00:02:06.890> believe<00:02:07.130> it<00:02:07.310> see<00:02:07.460> as

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
actually actually I believe it see as

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.940 
actually actually I believe it see as
larger<00:02:08.119> than<00:02:08.330> the<00:02:08.509> halo<00:02:08.899> 3<00:02:09.229> rocket<00:02:09.649> launcher

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
larger than the halo 3 rocket launcher

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.280 
larger than the halo 3 rocket launcher
that<00:02:10.759> McFarlane<00:02:11.299> made<00:02:11.420> for<00:02:11.599> their<00:02:11.719> figures<00:02:12.049> so

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
that McFarlane made for their figures so

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.920 
that McFarlane made for their figures so
really<00:02:12.950> cool<00:02:13.099> new<00:02:13.250> weapon<00:02:13.579> so<00:02:14.480> he<00:02:14.599> comes<00:02:14.780> with

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
really cool new weapon so he comes with

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.470 
really cool new weapon so he comes with
that<00:02:15.109> he<00:02:15.349> also<00:02:15.500> comes<00:02:15.739> with<00:02:15.829> a

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
that he also comes with a

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.220 
that he also comes with a
grenade<00:02:17.480> which<00:02:17.690> you<00:02:17.780> can<00:02:17.930> see<00:02:18.050> right<00:02:18.170> there

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
grenade which you can see right there

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.320 
grenade which you can see right there
that<00:02:18.410> can<00:02:18.830> be<00:02:18.950> removed<00:02:19.250> just<00:02:19.820> take<00:02:19.970> it<00:02:20.090> off<00:02:20.180> the

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
that can be removed just take it off the

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.360 
that can be removed just take it off the
two<00:02:20.750> pegs<00:02:21.020> which<00:02:21.290> you<00:02:21.470> have<00:02:21.800> on<00:02:21.980> the<00:02:22.070> back<00:02:22.220> of

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
two pegs which you have on the back of

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.580 
two pegs which you have on the back of
the<00:02:22.430> figure-four<00:02:22.910> grenade<00:02:23.840> display<00:02:24.200> supposed

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
the figure-four grenade display supposed

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.560 
the figure-four grenade display supposed
to<00:02:24.740> right<00:02:24.920> there<00:02:25.190> he<00:02:25.730> comes<00:02:25.880> with<00:02:26.090> that<00:02:26.240> and<00:02:26.480> he

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
to right there he comes with that and he

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.600 
to right there he comes with that and he
also<00:02:26.600> comes<00:02:26.930> with<00:02:27.050> a<00:02:27.230> peg<00:02:27.530> for<00:02:27.890> the<00:02:28.070> rocket

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
also comes with a peg for the rocket

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.610 
also comes with a peg for the rocket
launcher<00:02:28.880> so<00:02:29.150> as<00:02:29.630> you<00:02:29.750> can<00:02:29.870> see<00:02:30.080> my<00:02:30.260> rocket

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
launcher so as you can see my rocket

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.020 
launcher so as you can see my rocket
launcher<00:02:30.710> went<00:02:31.070> flying<00:02:31.370> off<00:02:31.580> for<00:02:31.820> some<00:02:32.000> reason

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
launcher went flying off for some reason

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.790 
launcher went flying off for some reason
so<00:02:32.570> let<00:02:32.750> me<00:02:32.840> try<00:02:32.990> to<00:02:33.020> get<00:02:33.170> that<00:02:33.320> back<00:02:33.530> onto

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
so let me try to get that back onto

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.680 
so let me try to get that back onto
there<00:02:34.070> but<00:02:34.730> that<00:02:34.820> is<00:02:34.880> one<00:02:35.150> problem<00:02:35.330> with<00:02:35.600> the

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
there but that is one problem with the

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.180 
there but that is one problem with the
rocket<00:02:35.990> launchers<00:02:36.260> that<00:02:36.530> the<00:02:36.710> figure<00:02:36.950> can't

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
rocket launchers that the figure can't

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.800 
rocket launchers that the figure can't
really<00:02:37.370> hold<00:02:37.490> it<00:02:37.700> too<00:02:37.790> well<00:02:37.940> but<00:02:38.150> I<00:02:38.330> think<00:02:38.600> the

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
really hold it too well but I think the

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.090 
really hold it too well but I think the
reasoning<00:02:39.140> for<00:02:39.170> that<00:02:39.320> is<00:02:39.440> because<00:02:39.650> this

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
reasoning for that is because this

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.310 
reasoning for that is because this
almost<00:02:41.090> Spartan<00:02:41.420> gun<00:02:41.570> Junior<00:02:41.810> comes<00:02:42.050> with<00:02:42.200> a

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
almost Spartan gun Junior comes with a

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:43.780 
almost Spartan gun Junior comes with a
robotic<00:02:42.920> arm<00:02:43.070> which<00:02:43.340> you<00:02:43.460> can<00:02:43.610> see<00:02:43.760> right

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
robotic arm which you can see right

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.870 
robotic arm which you can see right
there<00:02:44.150> so<00:02:44.990> the<00:02:45.500> robotic<00:02:45.980> arm<00:02:46.130> has<00:02:46.340> a<00:02:46.580> little

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
there so the robotic arm has a little

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.850 
there so the robotic arm has a little
bit<00:02:47.000> slightly<00:02:47.300> less<00:02:47.720> articulation<00:02:48.470> so<00:02:48.680> that's

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
bit slightly less articulation so that's

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.260 
bit slightly less articulation so that's
probably<00:02:49.130> the<00:02:49.280> reason<00:02:49.400> why<00:02:49.550> I<00:02:49.670> can't<00:02:49.970> hold<00:02:50.150> it

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270 
probably the reason why I can't hold it

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.510 
probably the reason why I can't hold it
too<00:02:50.390> well<00:02:50.540> but<00:02:50.780> you<00:02:51.200> know<00:02:51.320> oh<00:02:51.350> well<00:02:51.650> it<00:02:52.310> does

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:52.520 
too well but you know oh well it does

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.070 
too well but you know oh well it does
have<00:02:52.640> the<00:02:52.760> shotgun<00:02:53.000> shells<00:02:53.420> on<00:02:53.630> his<00:02:53.780> wrist

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
have the shotgun shells on his wrist

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.510 
have the shotgun shells on his wrist
right<00:02:54.260> there<00:02:54.410> which<00:02:54.560> look<00:02:54.770> really<00:02:55.010> nice<00:02:55.130> got

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520 
right there which look really nice got

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.400 
right there which look really nice got
the<00:02:55.640> security<00:02:56.150> the<00:02:56.390> security<00:02:56.540> shoulder<00:02:57.230> and

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
the security the security shoulder and

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.140 
the security the security shoulder and
then<00:02:57.860> there's<00:02:58.010> the<00:02:58.190> Air<00:02:58.460> Assault<00:02:58.580> shoulder

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
then there's the Air Assault shoulder

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:00.880 
then there's the Air Assault shoulder
plate<00:02:59.330> on<00:02:59.480> the<00:02:59.570> other<00:02:59.720> side<00:02:59.900> of<00:03:00.020> the<00:03:00.110> UNSC<00:03:00.440> logo

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
plate on the other side of the UNSC logo

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.880 
plate on the other side of the UNSC logo
we<00:03:01.640> got<00:03:01.820> the<00:03:01.940> guns<00:03:02.300> inner<00:03:02.600> helmet<00:03:03.470> I<00:03:03.650> believe

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
we got the guns inner helmet I believe

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:05.350 
we got the guns inner helmet I believe
I'm<00:03:04.040> pronouncing<00:03:04.310> that<00:03:04.610> correctly<00:03:04.670> I'm<00:03:05.210> not

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360
