 Chinese technology like this it happens 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:53.940
 if properly handle the technique during 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:59.060

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:59.060

 they do not need to drive on the Chinese equipment 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:10.320
 because the Chinese already know how 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:13.100
 better to do than everyone else 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:15.500
