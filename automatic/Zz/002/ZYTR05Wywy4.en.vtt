00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
that's amazing if just by looking at it

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.110 
that's amazing if just by looking at it
glancing<00:02:37.620> at<00:02:37.739> it<00:02:37.770> doing<00:02:38.100> fast<00:02:38.400> math<00:02:38.760> that

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
glancing at it doing fast math that

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.910 
glancing at it doing fast math that
would<00:02:39.300> be<00:02:40.730> 250<00:02:41.730> thousand<00:02:42.330> two<00:02:43.200> thousand<00:02:43.680> forty

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
would be 250 thousand two thousand forty

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
hours would that be four mil an hour I

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.540 
hours would that be four mil an hour I
think<00:02:48.959> it<00:02:49.050> would<00:02:49.170> be<00:02:49.200> roughly<00:02:49.680> about<00:02:49.950> four<00:02:50.340> mil

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
think it would be roughly about four mil
