00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
them for a few years you don't have to

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.310 
them for a few years you don't have to
do<00:01:08.040> any<00:01:08.220> of<00:01:08.340> that<00:01:08.580> because<00:01:08.820> they<00:01:09.540> naturally<00:01:09.780> go

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
do any of that because they naturally go

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.890 
do any of that because they naturally go
hard<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:11.070> this<00:01:11.820> one<00:01:12.030> if<00:01:12.150> you<00:01:12.299> feel<00:01:12.600> that

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
next step now what you would do first of

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.100 
next step now what you would do first of
all<00:01:32.159> is<00:01:32.220> to<00:01:32.460> soak<00:01:32.729> it<00:01:32.939> overnight<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:33.600> water

all is to soak it overnight and water
and<00:01:34.470> then<00:01:34.740> plunge<00:01:35.100> it<00:01:35.280> into<00:01:35.720> hot<00:01:36.720> sand<00:01:37.170> but<00:01:37.439> as

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
doesn't need doing because they're

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.460 
doesn't need doing because they're
already<00:01:44.340> very<00:01:44.670> very<00:01:44.970> hard<00:01:45.329> right<00:01:45.750> some<00:01:46.320> of

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
already very very hard right some of

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.310 
already very very hard right some of
them<00:01:46.710> are<00:01:47.630> incredibly<00:01:48.630> that<00:01:48.899> one's<00:01:49.020> harder

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
them are incredibly that one's harder

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.560

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.850 
wings I do it in one that's already two
and<00:03:00.030> as<00:03:00.209> you<00:03:00.480> can<00:03:00.660> see<00:03:00.720> that<00:03:01.290> is<00:03:01.440> already

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
and as you can see that is already

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:14.180 
and as you can see that is already
looking<00:03:02.130> like<00:03:02.549> an<00:03:02.760> ear<00:03:02.970> isn't<00:03:03.329> it<00:03:12.829> you<00:03:13.829> have<00:03:14.040> to

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
looking like an ear isn't it you have to

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.080 
looking like an ear isn't it you have to
give<00:03:14.340> it<00:03:14.430> two<00:03:14.549> slits<00:03:15.769> on<00:03:16.769> something<00:03:17.700> that's

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
give it two slits on something that's

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.479 
give it two slits on something that's
hard<00:03:18.359> and<00:03:19.260> it<00:03:19.440> clicks<00:03:19.859> do<00:03:20.250> you<00:03:20.280> hear<00:03:20.459> that

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
hard and it clicks do you hear that

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:33.020 
hard and it clicks do you hear that
click<00:03:20.880> that<00:03:21.660> means<00:03:21.930> it's<00:03:22.200> given<00:03:22.620> a<00:03:23.810> nice<00:03:32.030> it

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
click that means it's given a nice it

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.740 
click that means it's given a nice it
depends<00:03:33.870> on<00:03:34.049> the<00:03:34.440> size<00:03:34.650> of<00:03:34.940> the<00:03:35.940> quill<00:03:36.239> because

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
depends on the size of the quill because

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.890 
depends on the size of the quill because
some<00:03:37.049> quills<00:03:37.950> need<00:03:38.280> a<00:03:38.310> longer<00:03:38.700> slit<00:03:39.540> them

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
some quills need a longer slit them

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.400 
some quills need a longer slit them
others<00:03:40.500> and<00:03:40.769> then<00:03:41.700> you<00:03:41.880> need<00:03:42.180> to<00:03:42.209> redo<00:03:43.079> the

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
others and then you need to redo the

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.650 
others and then you need to redo the
it's<00:03:44.190> not<00:03:44.370> the<00:03:44.639> lighting<00:03:45.090> here<00:03:45.359> isn't<00:03:45.599> very

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
it's not the lighting here isn't very

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:50.720 
it's not the lighting here isn't very
good<00:03:46.220> you<00:03:47.220> need<00:03:47.489> to<00:03:48.859> cut<00:03:49.859> down<00:03:49.889> and<00:03:50.340> you<00:03:50.459> hear<00:03:50.700> a

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
good you need to cut down and you hear a

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.629 
good you need to cut down and you hear a
click<00:03:51.090> and<00:03:51.810> you<00:03:52.049> will<00:03:52.200> see<00:03:52.530> then<00:03:53.069> if<00:03:53.220> I<00:03:53.340> pass

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:53.639 
click and you will see then if I pass

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:55.490 
click and you will see then if I pass
this<00:03:53.910> round<00:03:54.239> and<00:03:54.450> then<00:03:54.569> you<00:03:54.630> do<00:03:54.989> that

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
this round and then you do that

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.539 
this round and then you do that
how<00:03:56.099> will<00:03:57.000> that<00:03:57.030> pick<00:03:57.750> that<00:03:57.959> up<00:03:58.019> on<00:03:58.530> there<00:03:58.799> how

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
how will that pick that up on there how

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:02.780 
how will that pick that up on there how
you<00:04:00.180> can<00:04:00.389> see<00:04:00.660> that<00:04:01.620> slit<00:04:02.010> and<00:04:02.310> there's<00:04:02.609> the

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
you can see that slit and there's the

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:10.320 
you can see that slit and there's the
nip<00:04:03.030> yeah<00:04:03.709> you<00:04:04.709> said<00:04:05.040> yeah<00:04:05.370> and<00:04:06.180> that's<00:04:06.690> the

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:10.330 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:14.140 

that's<00:04:11.330> what<00:04:11.540> I<00:04:11.590> used<00:04:12.590> to<00:04:12.800> do<00:04:12.980> yes<00:04:13.430> they<00:04:13.880> used

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
that's what I used to do yes they used

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.420 
that's what I used to do yes they used
to<00:04:14.360> have<00:04:14.540> a<00:04:14.570> machine<00:04:15.020> called<00:04:15.320> a<00:04:15.500> coil<00:04:15.740> cutter

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.979 

you<00:04:19.430> sometimes<00:04:20.030> need<00:04:20.269> to<00:04:20.299> play<00:04:20.630> about<00:04:20.780> with

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
you sometimes need to play about with

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:23.320 
you sometimes need to play about with
this<00:04:21.350> which<00:04:21.680> is<00:04:21.890> you<00:04:22.400> know<00:04:22.520> maybe<00:04:22.760> make<00:04:23.090> this

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
this which is you know maybe make this

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.330 
this which is you know maybe make this
longer<00:04:23.870> or<00:04:24.430> depending<00:04:25.430> on<00:04:25.520> the<00:04:25.730> size<00:04:26.090> of<00:04:26.420> your

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
longer or depending on the size of your

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:32.470 
longer or depending on the size of your
nib<00:04:28.340> you<00:04:28.730> can<00:04:28.970> live<00:04:29.150> sort<00:04:29.720> of<00:04:29.810> recut<00:04:31.270> if<00:04:32.270> the

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:32.480 
nib you can live sort of recut if the

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.730 
nib you can live sort of recut if the
quill<00:04:32.750> is<00:04:32.900> wider<00:04:33.320> yes<00:04:35.020> what's<00:04:36.020> all<00:04:36.200> cotton<00:04:36.470> to

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740 
quill is wider yes what's all cotton to

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.010 
quill is wider yes what's all cotton to
make<00:04:36.920> then<00:04:37.220> the<00:04:37.550> same<00:04:37.790> sort<00:04:38.060> of<00:04:38.120> cut<00:04:38.360> you<00:04:38.810> make

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
make then the same sort of cut you make

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.470 
make then the same sort of cut you make
it<00:04:39.200> a<00:04:39.290> longer<00:04:39.560> cut<00:04:39.980> not<00:04:40.700> necessarily<00:04:41.420> it

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:41.480 
it a longer cut not necessarily it

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.410 
it a longer cut not necessarily it
depends<00:04:41.840> on<00:04:41.900> what<00:04:42.110> size<00:04:42.410> nib<00:04:42.740> you<00:04:42.920> want<00:04:43.360> so<00:04:44.360> you

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:44.420 
depends on what size nib you want so you

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:48.670 
depends on what size nib you want so you
can<00:04:44.690> make<00:04:44.900> these<00:04:45.110> wings<00:04:45.550> down<00:04:47.290> it<00:04:48.290> depends

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 
can make these wings down it depends

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.660 
can make these wings down it depends
what<00:04:48.830> size<00:04:49.100> of<00:04:49.280> writing<00:04:49.700> you<00:04:49.850> want<00:04:50.000> to<00:04:50.210> do<00:04:51.670> so

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:52.670 
what size of writing you want to do so

00:04:52.670 --> 00:05:02.230 
what size of writing you want to do so
you<00:04:52.730> can<00:04:52.880> oversized<00:04:57.640> yes<00:05:00.370> so<00:05:01.370> then<00:05:01.580> you<00:05:01.790> have<00:05:02.030> a

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 
you can oversized yes so then you have a

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:16.670 
you can oversized yes so then you have a
nice<00:05:08.470> cut<00:05:09.470> it<00:05:09.620> straight<00:05:09.890> through

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:21.390 

that<00:05:17.680> qualifies<00:05:18.280> to<00:05:18.550> stop<00:05:18.850> yeah
