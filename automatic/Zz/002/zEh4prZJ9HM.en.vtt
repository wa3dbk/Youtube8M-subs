00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:03.050 

the<00:00:01.410> other<00:00:01.530> day<00:00:01.770> on<00:00:01.920> the<00:00:02.010> Fastlane<00:00:02.429> truck<00:00:02.790> we

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060 
the other day on the Fastlane truck we

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.079 
the other day on the Fastlane truck we
figured<00:00:03.389> out<00:00:03.540> that<00:00:03.570> this<00:00:04.220> 2013<00:00:05.220> Toyota<00:00:05.910> Tundra

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
figured out that this 2013 Toyota Tundra

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.140 
figured out that this 2013 Toyota Tundra
is<00:00:06.450> pretty<00:00:06.779> darn<00:00:07.170> fast<00:00:07.440> from<00:00:07.799> zero<00:00:08.069> to<00:00:08.189> 60<00:00:08.550> so

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
is pretty darn fast from zero to 60 so

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.209 
is pretty darn fast from zero to 60 so
today<00:00:09.540> we're<00:00:10.139> going<00:00:10.230> to<00:00:10.320> find<00:00:10.590> out<00:00:10.769> how<00:00:10.920> fast

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
today we're going to find out how fast

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.089 
today we're going to find out how fast
it<00:00:11.429> is<00:00:11.519> towing<00:00:11.849> an<00:00:12.150> almost<00:00:12.630> 6,000<00:00:13.500> pound<00:00:13.799> boat

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
it is towing an almost 6,000 pound boat

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:45.880 
it is towing an almost 6,000 pound boat
coming<00:00:14.940> up<00:00:15.089> next<00:00:15.299> on<00:00:15.630> the<00:00:15.809> fast<00:00:16.049> lane<00:00:16.289> truck

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.620 

so<00:00:46.890> it<00:00:47.100> may<00:00:47.250> not<00:00:47.280> be<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:47.640> heavy<00:00:47.910> but<00:00:48.210> it<00:00:48.450> has

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:48.630 
so it may not be a heavy but it has

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:52.130 
so it may not be a heavy but it has
exact<00:00:49.290> same<00:00:49.620> displacement<00:00:50.630> 5.7<00:00:51.630> liters<00:00:51.930> of

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
exact same displacement 5.7 liters of

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.930 
exact same displacement 5.7 liters of
Toyota<00:00:52.890> v8<00:00:53.400> goodness

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
Toyota v8 goodness

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.450 
Toyota v8 goodness
speaking<00:00:54.300> of<00:00:54.420> displacement<00:00:54.960> this<00:00:55.620> VA<00:00:55.950> puts

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
speaking of displacement this VA puts

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.970 
speaking of displacement this VA puts
out<00:00:57.380> 381<00:00:58.380> horsepower<00:00:58.650> and<00:00:59.989> 401<00:01:00.989> pound-feet<00:01:01.800> of

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
out 381 horsepower and 401 pound-feet of

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.740 
out 381 horsepower and 401 pound-feet of
torque<00:01:02.100> which<00:01:02.489> is<00:01:02.520> really<00:01:02.850> what's<00:01:03.270> important

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
torque which is really what's important

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.479 
torque which is really what's important
when<00:01:03.870> towing<00:01:04.110> Andre<00:01:04.680> come<00:01:04.860> here<00:01:05.010> for<00:01:05.130> a<00:01:05.220> second

thousand<00:03:51.810> four<00:03:51.960> hundred<00:03:52.050> pounds<00:03:52.650> what<00:03:53.070> does

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
thousand four hundred pounds what does

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.640 
thousand four hundred pounds what does
the<00:03:53.220> manual<00:03:53.430> say<00:03:53.780> just<00:03:54.780> nice<00:03:54.930> deployed<00:03:55.500> it<00:03:55.620> to

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
the manual say just nice deployed it to

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.650 
the manual say just nice deployed it to
give<00:03:56.070> it<00:03:56.220> DC<00:03:56.580> it's<00:03:56.790> just<00:03:56.940> nine<00:03:57.180> thousand

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
give it DC it's just nine thousand

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:58.630 
give it DC it's just nine thousand
pounds<00:03:57.900> you<00:03:57.960> know<00:03:58.080> why<00:03:58.200> that<00:03:58.230> is

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:58.640 
pounds you know why that is

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.280 
pounds you know why that is
that's<00:03:59.640> because<00:04:00.090> when<00:04:00.420> you<00:04:00.600> start<00:04:00.930> adding

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
that's because when you start adding

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.220 
that's because when you start adding
stuff<00:04:01.410> to<00:04:01.590> it<00:04:01.890> it<00:04:02.700> adds<00:04:03.000> weight<00:04:03.450> so<00:04:03.750> the<00:04:03.990> ten

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
stuff to it it adds weight so the ten

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.690 
stuff to it it adds weight so the ten
thousand<00:04:04.590> four<00:04:04.740> hundred<00:04:04.830> pound<00:04:05.220> tundra<00:04:05.580> is

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
the short wheelbase Kruti not the crew

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.130 
the short wheelbase Kruti not the crew
cab<00:04:08.340> but<00:04:08.700> the<00:04:08.910> two-door<00:04:09.270> when<00:04:09.810> you<00:04:09.930> start

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
cab but the two-door when you start

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:11.840 
cab but the two-door when you start
adding<00:04:10.260> doors<00:04:10.560> you<00:04:10.860> start<00:04:11.130> adding<00:04:11.310> all-wheel

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
adding doors you start adding all-wheel

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.150 
adding doors you start adding all-wheel
drive<00:04:12.180> it<00:04:12.690> just<00:04:12.870> makes<00:04:13.050> it<00:04:13.170> heavier<00:04:13.440> and<00:04:13.770> it

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
drive it just makes it heavier and it

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.980 
drive it just makes it heavier and it
makes<00:04:14.400> a<00:04:14.520> total<00:04:14.700> bit<00:04:15.030> less<00:04:15.210> so<00:04:15.390> this<00:04:15.600> one<00:04:15.810> that

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:15.990 
makes a total bit less so this one that

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:17.570 
makes a total bit less so this one that
we're<00:04:16.170> in<00:04:16.320> has<00:04:16.470> a<00:04:16.500> nine<00:04:16.739> thousand<00:04:17.160> pound<00:04:17.370> tow

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290 
rating which should be plenty for that

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.080 
rating which should be plenty for that
five<00:04:19.770> thousand<00:04:20.250> seven<00:04:20.340> hundred<00:04:20.520> forty<00:04:20.880> pound
