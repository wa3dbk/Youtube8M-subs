00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
we'll go over what the shell what

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:44.770 
we'll go over what the shell what
they'll<00:03:43.280> spin<00:03:43.670> the<00:03:43.820> length<00:03:44.060> is<00:03:44.270> okay<00:03:44.720> so

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
they'll spin the length is okay so

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.560 
they'll spin the length is okay so
that's<00:03:45.050> what<00:03:45.260> this<00:03:45.410> was<00:03:45.680> what<00:03:46.520> it<00:03:46.610> was<00:03:46.820> now<00:03:47.540> you

a new one you can do that we have a 68

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.570 
a new one you can do that we have a 68
by<00:03:54.580> 127<00:03:55.580> and<00:03:56.270> this<00:03:56.600> would<00:03:56.840> be<00:03:57.020> the<00:03:57.800> replacement

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:58.580 
by 127 and this would be the replacement

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:01.810 
by 127 and this would be the replacement
for<00:03:58.940> your<00:03:59.090> existing<00:03:59.720> one<00:04:00.400> would<00:04:01.400> you<00:04:01.520> like<00:04:01.580> to

see what that looks like it looks
exactly<00:04:03.380> like<00:04:03.650> this<00:04:03.980> but<00:04:04.250> it's<00:04:04.370> a<00:04:04.489> little<00:04:04.910> bit

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
exactly like this but it's a little bit

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:12.759 
exactly like this but it's a little bit
longer

00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:12.769 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:15.140 

one<00:04:13.769> of<00:04:13.890> our<00:04:14.010> bottom<00:04:14.340> brackets<00:04:14.730> come<00:04:14.940> with<00:04:15.120> a

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
one of our bottom brackets come with a

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.210 
one of our bottom brackets come with a
set<00:04:16.109> of<00:04:16.139> bolts<00:04:16.440> that<00:04:16.530> go<00:04:16.620> into<00:04:16.980> it<00:04:17.070> as<00:04:17.820> well

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
set of bolts that go into it as well

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.379 
set of bolts that go into it as well
we'll<00:04:20.220> just<00:04:20.250> put<00:04:20.459> that<00:04:20.609> in<00:04:20.820> this<00:04:21.000> and<00:04:21.180> that<00:04:21.269> way

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:21.389 
we'll just put that in this and that way

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:28.090 
we'll just put that in this and that way
everybody<00:04:21.750> understands<00:04:22.260> what's<00:04:22.440> going<00:04:22.650> on

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.100 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:32.689 

and<00:04:29.100> here<00:04:30.030> in<00:04:30.120> here<00:04:30.330> okay<00:04:31.050> so<00:04:31.680> now<00:04:32.070> there's<00:04:32.430> our

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:32.699 
and here in here okay so now there's our

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:36.530 
and here in here okay so now there's our
old<00:04:32.970> there's<00:04:33.330> our<00:04:34.340> notice<00:04:35.340> the<00:04:35.460> distance<00:04:35.699> let

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:36.540 
old there's our notice the distance let

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.120 
old there's our notice the distance let
notice<00:04:36.870> how<00:04:36.960> much<00:04:37.110> longer<00:04:37.530> this<00:04:37.650> one<00:04:37.830> is<00:04:37.949> than

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
notice how much longer this one is than

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.629 
notice how much longer this one is than
this<00:04:38.250> one<00:04:38.460> is<00:04:39.680> so<00:04:40.680> this<00:04:40.889> would<00:04:41.070> be<00:04:41.220> to<00:04:41.340> replace

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:41.639 
this one is so this would be to replace

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:44.600 
this one is so this would be to replace
what<00:04:42.150> was<00:04:42.330> in<00:04:42.600> there<00:04:42.870> beforehand<00:04:43.610> now

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
what was in there beforehand now

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.010 
what was in there beforehand now
sometimes<00:04:45.150> we<00:04:45.330> want<00:04:45.540> to<00:04:45.570> make<00:04:45.720> it<00:04:45.840> even

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
sometimes we want to make it even

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.230 
sometimes we want to make it even
smaller<00:04:46.650> and<00:04:46.860> we<00:04:47.040> want<00:04:47.220> to<00:04:47.280> push<00:04:47.490> that<00:04:47.669> baby<00:04:47.910> in

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
smaller and we want to push that baby in

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.860 
smaller and we want to push that baby in
as<00:04:48.750> far<00:04:49.020> as<00:04:49.200> we<00:04:49.410> can<00:04:49.680> and<00:04:50.120> that's<00:04:51.120> where<00:04:51.479> we<00:04:51.630> go

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
as far as we can and that's where we go

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.710 
as far as we can and that's where we go
with<00:04:52.440> this<00:04:52.470> cog<00:04:53.220> with<00:04:53.760> this<00:04:53.910> bottom<00:04:54.330> bracket

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
with this cog with this bottom bracket

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.290 
with this cog with this bottom bracket
which<00:04:54.990> is<00:04:55.020> the<00:04:55.260> smaller<00:04:56.010> one<00:04:56.160> of<00:04:56.610> all<00:04:56.970> of<00:04:57.120> them

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
which is the smaller one of all of them

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.310 
which is the smaller one of all of them
at<00:04:57.780> 103<00:04:58.910> spindle<00:04:59.910> length<00:05:00.090> from<00:05:00.360> here<00:05:00.389> to<00:05:01.020> here

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 
at 103 spindle length from here to here

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:10.540 
at 103 spindle length from here to here
there<00:05:02.250> are<00:05:02.550> you<00:05:03.060> ready<00:05:03.800> 103<00:05:05.510> 107<00:05:06.949> 113<00:05:08.449> 118<00:05:09.449> and

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:10.550 
there are you ready 103 107 113 118 and

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:13.040 
there are you ready 103 107 113 118 and
127<00:05:11.550> I<00:05:11.760> think<00:05:12.180> there<00:05:12.300> might<00:05:12.419> be<00:05:12.479> even<00:05:12.570> one<00:05:12.900> in

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.050 
127 I think there might be even one in

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.680 
127 I think there might be even one in
between<00:05:13.470> yeah<00:05:13.740> 122<00:05:14.550> I<00:05:14.580> think<00:05:14.970> in<00:05:15.150> a<00:05:15.240> 120

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:15.690 
between yeah 122 I think in a 120

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:18.020 
between yeah 122 I think in a 120
there's<00:05:16.229> a<00:05:16.289> 122<00:05:16.950> it's<00:05:17.130> like<00:05:17.280> five<00:05:17.520> millimeter

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.030 
there's a 122 it's like five millimeter

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.570 
there's a 122 it's like five millimeter

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:23.100 
shows you all of the different sizes

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.580 
shows you all of the different sizes
we're<00:05:24.060> putting<00:05:24.419> a<00:05:24.479> little<00:05:24.690> bit<00:05:24.780> we're<00:05:25.320> putting

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.590 
we're putting a little bit we're putting

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.800 
we're putting a little bit we're putting
the<00:05:25.680> smallest<00:05:26.130> one<00:05:26.550> in<00:05:26.729> because<00:05:27.539> we're

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:27.810 
the smallest one in because we're

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:29.870 
the smallest one in because we're
turning<00:05:28.169> this<00:05:28.260> bicycle<00:05:28.680> into<00:05:28.979> a<00:05:29.099> single<00:05:29.580> speed

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:29.880 
turning this bicycle into a single speed

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:37.010 
turning this bicycle into a single speed
the<00:05:30.570> 103<00:05:32.599> okay<00:05:33.599> works<00:05:34.940> almost<00:05:36.020> exclusively

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 
the 103 okay works almost exclusively

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:42.409 
the 103 okay works almost exclusively
for<00:05:37.590> a<00:05:37.620> single<00:05:38.130> speed<00:05:38.460> or<00:05:38.760> a<00:05:39.360> fixie<00:05:40.940> 103<00:05:41.940> it

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:42.419 
for a single speed or a fixie 103 it

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:45.680 
for a single speed or a fixie 103 it
really<00:05:42.960> does<00:05:43.349> a<00:05:43.530> nice<00:05:43.800> job<00:05:44.099> for<00:05:44.669> us<00:05:44.700> it<00:05:45.240> gets<00:05:45.450> in

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:45.690 
really does a nice job for us it gets in

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:47.900 
really does a nice job for us it gets in
there<00:05:45.840> far<00:05:46.139> enough<00:05:46.260> let<00:05:47.160> me<00:05:47.220> just<00:05:47.400> put<00:05:47.580> that<00:05:47.610> in

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:47.910 
there far enough let me just put that in

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:54.710 
there far enough let me just put that in
so<00:05:48.120> that<00:05:48.240> way<00:05:48.419> we<00:05:48.570> can<00:05:48.750> see<00:05:48.930> that<00:05:51.710> and<00:05:53.570> this<00:05:54.570> is

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:54.720 
so that way we can see that and this is

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.680 
so that way we can see that and this is
another<00:05:55.050> way<00:05:55.320> to<00:05:55.349> dr.<00:05:56.250> or<00:05:56.550> to<00:05:56.729> manipulate<00:05:57.479> our

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:57.690 
another way to dr. or to manipulate our

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:05.719 
another way to dr. or to manipulate our
chain<00:05:58.669> sight<00:05:59.669> chain<00:06:02.780> angle<00:06:03.780> of<00:06:04.590> how<00:06:04.889> straight

00:06:05.719 --> 00:06:05.729 
chain sight chain angle of how straight

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:08.480 
chain sight chain angle of how straight
that<00:06:05.760> chain<00:06:06.389> is<00:06:06.750> that's<00:06:07.680> in<00:06:07.860> pretty<00:06:08.130> much<00:06:08.220> all

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:08.490 
that chain is that's in pretty much all

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:10.700 
that chain is that's in pretty much all
the<00:06:08.610> way<00:06:08.760> I<00:06:09.060> put<00:06:09.599> this<00:06:09.780> on<00:06:09.990> on<00:06:10.110> the<00:06:10.200> backside

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:10.710 
the way I put this on on the backside

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:13.279 
the way I put this on on the backside
now<00:06:11.010> that<00:06:11.849> is<00:06:12.090> about<00:06:12.240> as<00:06:12.539> close<00:06:12.810> as<00:06:13.080> you're

00:06:13.279 --> 00:06:13.289 
now that is about as close as you're

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:17.089 
now that is about as close as you're
gonna<00:06:13.410> get<00:06:15.020> now<00:06:16.020> if<00:06:16.229> I<00:06:16.289> put<00:06:16.500> this<00:06:16.620> back<00:06:16.830> into

00:06:17.089 --> 00:06:17.099 
gonna get now if I put this back into

00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:19.629 
gonna get now if I put this back into
here<00:06:17.370> like<00:06:17.580> this

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:19.639 
here like this

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:24.429 
here like this
again<00:06:20.509> we<00:06:20.659> return<00:06:21.050> an<00:06:21.319> old-school<00:06:23.439> ten-speed

00:06:24.429 --> 00:06:24.439 
again we return an old-school ten-speed

00:06:24.439 --> 00:06:27.159 
again we return an old-school ten-speed
bicycle<00:06:24.680> into<00:06:25.669> a<00:06:25.759> single<00:06:26.270> speed<00:06:26.539> buy<00:06:26.719> into<00:06:27.139> a

bicycle into a single speed buy into a
single<00:06:27.590> speed<00:06:27.830> and<00:06:28.550> we<00:06:28.610> just<00:06:28.819> tighten<00:06:29.030> this<00:06:29.240> on

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:29.419 
single speed and we just tighten this on

00:06:29.419 --> 00:06:30.820 
single speed and we just tighten this on
here<00:06:29.659> for<00:06:29.810> a<00:06:29.870> second<00:06:30.229> so<00:06:30.319> that<00:06:30.349> way<00:06:30.560> we<00:06:30.680> could
