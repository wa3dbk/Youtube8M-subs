before the race during the race that

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:39.660 
before the race during the race that
will<00:00:38.860> give<00:00:38.980> you<00:00:39.070> a<00:00:39.100> few<00:00:39.220> different<00:00:39.550> options

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:39.670 
will give you a few different options

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.640 
will give you a few different options
here<00:00:40.739> first<00:00:41.739> to<00:00:41.920> start<00:00:42.190> with<00:00:42.370> this<00:00:43.300> is<00:00:43.480> a

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:43.650 
here first to start with this is a

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.229 
here first to start with this is a
pre-race<00:00:44.650> cooler<00:00:45.040> basically<00:00:45.760> what<00:00:45.910> it<00:00:46.000> is<00:00:46.030> is

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:46.239 
pre-race cooler basically what it is is

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:48.420 
pre-race cooler basically what it is is
a<00:00:46.270> motor<00:00:46.570> but<00:00:47.230> some<00:00:47.410> cooling<00:00:47.739> fins<00:00:47.949> as<00:00:48.129> you<00:00:48.250> can

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:48.430 
a motor but some cooling fins as you can

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.000 
a motor but some cooling fins as you can
see<00:00:48.640> and<00:00:49.600> you<00:00:49.660> wire<00:00:49.960> that<00:00:50.170> into<00:00:50.410> your<00:00:50.500> 12<00:00:50.770> volt

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.010 
see and you wire that into your 12 volt

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.030 
see and you wire that into your 12 volt
power<00:00:51.190> supply<00:00:52.440> basically<00:00:53.440> that<00:00:53.650> will<00:00:53.770> clip

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:54.040 
power supply basically that will clip

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.380 
power supply basically that will clip
onto<00:00:54.220> your<00:00:54.400> motor<00:00:55.410> like<00:00:56.410> so<00:00:57.090> prior<00:00:58.090> to<00:00:58.120> the

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
onto your motor like so prior to the

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.389 
onto your motor like so prior to the
race<00:00:58.570> what<00:00:59.290> that<00:00:59.470> does<00:00:59.649> this<00:00:59.770> drops<00:01:00.160> the

00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:00.399 
race what that does this drops the

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:02.220 
race what that does this drops the
temperature<00:01:00.910> of<00:01:01.030> your<00:01:01.059> motor<00:01:01.230> down

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.230 
temperature of your motor down

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:03.960 
temperature of your motor down
substantially<00:01:02.649> it<00:01:03.070> makes<00:01:03.220> it<00:01:03.340> basically<00:01:03.460> ice

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:03.970 
substantially it makes it basically ice

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:07.080 
substantially it makes it basically ice
cold<00:01:04.420> the<00:01:05.380> next<00:01:05.530> option<00:01:06.340> that<00:01:06.369> you<00:01:06.610> could<00:01:06.880> have

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
cold the next option that you could have

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.420 
cold the next option that you could have
is<00:01:07.300> a<00:01:07.330> motor<00:01:07.660> cooler<00:01:08.380> during<00:01:08.710> the<00:01:08.979> race<00:01:09.100> it<00:01:09.310> has

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430 
is a motor cooler during the race it has

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.880 
is a motor cooler during the race it has
a<00:01:09.460> built-in<00:01:09.880> fan<00:01:10.180> as<00:01:10.390> well<00:01:10.930> as<00:01:11.080> a<00:01:11.110> cooling<00:01:11.649> fin

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
a built-in fan as well as a cooling fin

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.800 
a built-in fan as well as a cooling fin
which<00:01:12.460> actually<00:01:12.940> takes<00:01:13.210> the<00:01:13.330> heat<00:01:13.479> away<00:01:13.660> from

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
which actually takes the heat away from

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.359 
which actually takes the heat away from
the<00:01:14.050> motor<00:01:14.200> and<00:01:14.470> cools<00:01:14.800> it<00:01:14.950> at<00:01:15.040> the<00:01:15.130> same<00:01:15.310> time

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:15.369 
the motor and cools it at the same time

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:17.280 
the motor and cools it at the same time

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:17.290 
that plugs into your receiver you can

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.139 
that plugs into your receiver you can
use<00:01:17.470> these<00:01:17.619> during<00:01:17.920> your<00:01:18.190> races<00:01:18.580> keeps<00:01:18.970> your

00:01:19.139 --> 00:01:19.149 
use these during your races keeps your

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:20.820 
use these during your races keeps your
motor<00:01:19.330> cooler<00:01:19.720> than<00:01:19.930> your<00:01:20.050> competitor<00:01:20.560> your

third<00:01:21.100> option<00:01:21.369> a<00:01:21.759> basic<00:01:22.330> cooling<00:01:22.690> fins

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 
third option a basic cooling fins

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.510 
third option a basic cooling fins
probably<00:01:23.440> looking<00:01:23.740> at<00:01:23.800> anywhere<00:01:24.160> from<00:01:24.250> five

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
probably looking at anywhere from five

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.249 
probably looking at anywhere from five
to<00:01:24.729> eight<00:01:24.759> dollars<00:01:25.300> for<00:01:25.330> one<00:01:25.660> of<00:01:25.780> these

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:26.259 
to eight dollars for one of these

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:29.400 
to eight dollars for one of these
the<00:01:26.800> cooling<00:01:27.340> fin<00:01:27.580> plus<00:01:27.970> the<00:01:28.450> fan<00:01:28.780> probably

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:29.410 
the cooling fin plus the fan probably

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.949 
the cooling fin plus the fan probably
run<00:01:29.590> about<00:01:29.710> fifteen<00:01:30.280> to<00:01:30.430> twenty<00:01:30.460> and<00:01:30.970> then<00:01:31.810> the

00:01:31.949 --> 00:01:31.959 
run about fifteen to twenty and then the

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:34.230 
run about fifteen to twenty and then the
most<00:01:32.110> expensive<00:01:32.530> option<00:01:33.039> is<00:01:33.190> the<00:01:33.550> pre<00:01:33.789> race

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
most expensive option is the pre race

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.020 
most expensive option is the pre race
cooler<00:01:34.810> seventy<00:01:35.590> five<00:01:35.860> dollars<00:01:36.340> or<00:01:36.550> so<00:01:36.789> I

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
cooler seventy five dollars or so I

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.469 
cooler seventy five dollars or so I
myself<00:01:37.450> have<00:01:37.899> made<00:01:38.140> just<00:01:38.800> a<00:01:38.950> small<00:01:39.550> fan<00:01:39.880> again

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
myself have made just a small fan again

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:42.089 
myself have made just a small fan again
to<00:01:40.660> cool<00:01:40.840> the<00:01:40.929> motor<00:01:41.080> down<00:01:41.350> prior<00:01:41.679> to<00:01:41.709> the<00:01:41.920> race
