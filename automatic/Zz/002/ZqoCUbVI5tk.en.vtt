00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
because then the noise canceling won't

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.119

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.709 
work and you have to have this on for
the<00:00:44.190> noise<00:00:44.399> canceling<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:44.879> work<00:00:45.030> just<00:00:45.420> a

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719
