00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
know we think that's going to give you a

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:03.860 
know we think that's going to give you a
lot<00:03:01.350> of<00:03:01.440> replayability<00:03:01.940> of<00:03:02.940> the<00:03:03.450> campaign

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.520 
lot of replayability of the campaign
whereas<00:03:04.440> traditionally<00:03:06.200> slowly<00:03:07.200> we<00:03:07.320> found

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
whereas traditionally slowly we found

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.220 
whereas traditionally slowly we found
here<00:03:07.920> in<00:03:08.180> Japan<00:03:09.180> that<00:03:09.299> people<00:03:09.540> are<00:03:09.690> playing

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
here in Japan that people are playing

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.240 
here in Japan that people are playing
campaign<00:03:10.920> games<00:03:11.250> as<00:03:11.850> a<00:03:12.060> single<00:03:12.420> player

campaign games as a single player

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.430 
campaign games as a single player
through<00:03:14.250> the<00:03:15.150> games<00:03:15.329> that<00:03:15.450> they<00:03:15.570> play<00:03:15.600> so

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
through the games that they play so

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.830 
through the games that they play so
again<00:03:17.160> social<00:03:17.579> is<00:03:17.670> very<00:03:17.910> important<00:03:18.420> to<00:03:18.480> halo

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
again social is very important to halo

greatly<00:04:22.810> improved<00:04:23.050> in<00:04:23.920> Halo<00:04:24.250> 3<00:04:24.280> it's<00:04:24.850> got<00:04:25.030> much

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
greatly improved in Halo 3 it's got much

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.980 
greatly improved in Halo 3 it's got much
more<00:04:25.420> awareness<00:04:25.780> of<00:04:26.200> where<00:04:26.560> the<00:04:27.310> flow<00:04:27.520> is<00:04:27.990> use

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
more awareness of where the flow is use

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:34.560 
more awareness of where the flow is use
the<00:04:29.050> matter<00:04:29.320> to<00:04:29.590> you<00:04:33.240> don't<00:04:34.240> underestimate

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
the matter to you don't underestimate

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.930 
the matter to you don't underestimate
the<00:04:35.080> Master<00:04:35.410> Chief<00:04:35.620> even<00:04:35.980> the<00:04:36.070> fees<00:04:36.280> of<00:04:36.760> that

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
the Master Chief even the fees of that

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:41.310 
the Master Chief even the fees of that
size<00:04:37.180> because<00:04:37.630> you<00:04:39.660> know<00:04:40.660> you<00:04:40.720> can<00:04:40.990> you<00:04:41.170> can

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 
size because you know you can you can

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.010 
size because you know you can you can
see<00:04:41.530> that<00:04:41.560> the<00:04:42.340> scarab<00:04:42.820> is<00:04:43.060> much<00:04:43.840> more

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020 
see that the scarab is much more

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:45.470 
see that the scarab is much more
impressive<00:04:44.440> as<00:04:44.710> a<00:04:44.740> much<00:04:44.920> more<00:04:45.070> gameplay

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:45.480 
impressive as a much more gameplay

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:50.010 
impressive as a much more gameplay
around<00:04:46.480> the<00:04:46.600> Scarab<00:04:47.880> I'm<00:04:48.880> actually<00:04:49.150> going<00:04:49.900> to

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
around the Scarab I'm actually going to

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.170 
around the Scarab I'm actually going to
be<00:04:50.050> driving<00:04:50.860> a<00:04:51.100> vehicle<00:04:51.280> trying<00:04:51.760> to<00:04:51.850> distract

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180 
be driving a vehicle trying to distract

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.240 
be driving a vehicle trying to distract
it<00:04:52.360> on<00:04:52.480> the<00:04:52.600> ground<00:04:52.840> while<00:04:53.650> it's<00:04:53.830> trying<00:04:54.100> to

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.250 
it on the ground while it's trying to

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:56.970 
it on the ground while it's trying to
target<00:04:54.610> me<00:04:54.880> with<00:04:55.000> its<00:04:55.120> legs<00:04:55.590> jay<00:04:56.590> is<00:04:56.770> going<00:04:56.920> to

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:56.980 
target me with its legs jay is going to

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:00.840 
target me with its legs jay is going to
probably<00:04:57.370> go<00:04:57.610> at<00:04:57.730> the<00:04:57.820> top<00:04:58.060> and<00:04:59.310> try<00:05:00.310> and<00:05:00.370> take

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:00.850 
probably go at the top and try and take

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:02.670 
probably go at the top and try and take
it<00:05:00.880> from<00:05:01.060> above<00:05:01.210> so<00:05:02.050> it's<00:05:02.080> that<00:05:02.260> kind<00:05:02.470> of<00:05:02.530> level

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680 
it from above so it's that kind of level

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.260 
it from above so it's that kind of level
of<00:05:02.860> collaboration<00:05:03.040> you<00:05:03.520> can<00:05:03.670> play<00:05:03.820> the<00:05:03.970> story

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:04.270 
of collaboration you can play the story

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.300 
of collaboration you can play the story
together<00:05:04.540> but<00:05:05.500> you<00:05:05.590> can<00:05:05.710> also<00:05:05.860> turn<00:05:06.250> on

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.310 
together but you can also turn on

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:10.320 
together but you can also turn on
something<00:05:06.760> which<00:05:07.620> fans<00:05:08.620> of<00:05:08.860> halo<00:05:09.610> 3<00:05:09.880> are<00:05:10.060> very

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:10.330 
something which fans of halo 3 are very

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:11.970 
something which fans of halo 3 are very
excited<00:05:10.660> by<00:05:10.870> which<00:05:10.990> is<00:05:11.110> the<00:05:11.230> campaign<00:05:11.620> scoring

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:11.980 
excited by which is the campaign scoring

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.880 
excited by which is the campaign scoring
so<00:05:12.520> while<00:05:13.270> we're<00:05:13.600> collaborating<00:05:14.440> we<00:05:14.740> can

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:14.890 
so while we're collaborating we can

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:16.440 
so while we're collaborating we can
actually<00:05:15.220> look<00:05:15.430> at<00:05:15.610> who<00:05:15.790> is<00:05:15.940> actually<00:05:16.300> being

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:16.450 
actually look at who is actually being

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:18.540 
actually look at who is actually being
most<00:05:16.660> effective<00:05:17.230> and<00:05:17.470> find<00:05:17.920> out<00:05:18.040> who's<00:05:18.310> the

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:18.550 
most effective and find out who's the

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:21.870 
most effective and find out who's the
real<00:05:18.730> master<00:05:19.210> yes<00:05:20.020> ok<00:05:20.680> so<00:05:21.040> Jay<00:05:21.400> took<00:05:21.610> a<00:05:21.730> bunch

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:21.880 
real master yes ok so Jay took a bunch

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.260 
real master yes ok so Jay took a bunch
of<00:05:22.030> my<00:05:22.180> jet<00:05:22.419> like<00:05:22.570> I<00:05:22.690> would<00:05:22.870> argue<00:05:23.050> and<00:05:24.270> likely

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.270 
of my jet like I would argue and likely

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:30.120 
of my jet like I would argue and likely
and<00:05:27.960> marginally<00:05:28.960> one<00:05:29.140> in<00:05:29.260> this<00:05:29.380> example<00:05:29.830> of

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:30.130 
and marginally one in this example of

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:32.580 
and marginally one in this example of
the<00:05:30.280> a<00:05:30.310> game<00:05:30.900> so<00:05:31.900> you<00:05:31.960> can<00:05:32.080> see<00:05:32.169> he's<00:05:32.350> at<00:05:32.500> the

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:32.590 
the a game so you can see he's at the

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:34.170 
the a game so you can see he's at the
top<00:05:32.770> being<00:05:33.010> a<00:05:33.070> master<00:05:33.250> chief<00:05:33.580> he's<00:05:33.730> taking<00:05:34.060> out

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:34.180 
top being a master chief he's taking out

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:37.470 
top being a master chief he's taking out
things<00:05:34.540> below<00:05:35.410> he's<00:05:35.919> actually<00:05:36.100> got<00:05:36.480> equipment

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:37.480 
things below he's actually got equipment

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:40.320 
things below he's actually got equipment
which<00:05:37.780> is<00:05:37.930> a<00:05:37.960> new<00:05:38.169> piece<00:05:38.410> in<00:05:38.620> Halo<00:05:38.950> 3<00:05:39.330> she's

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:40.330 
which is a new piece in Halo 3 she's

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.420 
which is a new piece in Halo 3 she's
gonna<00:05:40.480> throw<00:05:40.660> out<00:05:40.780> the<00:05:40.930> power<00:05:41.110> Draenor<00:05:41.500> that

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:42.430 
gonna throw out the power Draenor that

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:45.450 
gonna throw out the power Draenor that
can<00:05:42.640> help<00:05:42.820> disabled<00:05:43.330> vehicles<00:05:44.280> so<00:05:45.280> hopefully

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:45.460 
can help disabled vehicles so hopefully

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:49.530 
can help disabled vehicles so hopefully
it<00:05:46.360> will<00:05:46.540> affect<00:05:46.960> the<00:05:47.440> Scarab<00:05:48.430> it<00:05:49.240> will<00:05:49.360> come

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:49.540 
it will affect the Scarab it will come

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:54.540 
it will affect the Scarab it will come
around<00:05:50.140> the<00:05:50.470> side<00:05:50.530> and<00:05:52.980> take<00:05:53.980> out<00:05:54.130> the<00:05:54.160> Scarab

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:54.550 
around the side and take out the Scarab

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:57.600 
around the side and take out the Scarab
from<00:05:54.700> the<00:05:54.790> sauce<00:05:55.680> and<00:05:56.680> try<00:05:57.250> and<00:05:57.310> get<00:05:57.460> off

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:57.610 
from the sauce and try and get off

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:01.650 
from the sauce and try and get off
before<00:05:57.760> he's<00:05:58.710> blown<00:05:59.710> up<00:05:59.919> with<00:05:59.950> the<00:06:00.660> destroying

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:01.660 
before he's blown up with the destroying

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:03.930 
before he's blown up with the destroying
scarab<00:06:02.340> so<00:06:03.340> you<00:06:03.400> can<00:06:03.520> see<00:06:03.640> a<00:06:03.669> very<00:06:03.730> different

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:03.940 
scarab so you can see a very different

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:07.080 
scarab so you can see a very different
experience<00:06:04.300> of<00:06:04.780> how<00:06:04.900> the<00:06:04.960> AI<00:06:05.169> is<00:06:05.380> evolved<00:06:06.130> and

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:07.090 
experience of how the AI is evolved and

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:08.820 
experience of how the AI is evolved and

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:08.830 
this day takes a camera out you can see

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:11.159 
this day takes a camera out you can see
the<00:06:08.980> scale<00:06:09.400> of<00:06:09.790> the<00:06:10.210> battles<00:06:10.630> and<00:06:10.870> all<00:06:11.050> the

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:13.850 
different encounters that they're going
on

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:13.860

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:24.340 
the bottom right of the screen see a

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:26.780 
the bottom right of the screen see a
rocket<00:06:24.730> that<00:06:24.850> is<00:06:25.000> being<00:06:25.270> fired<00:06:25.570> by<00:06:25.930> one<00:06:26.440> of<00:06:26.530> the

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:26.790 
rocket that is being fired by one of the

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:32.070 
rocket that is being fired by one of the
fellow<00:06:27.790> UNSC<00:06:28.450> s<00:06:28.510> you<00:06:29.230> can<00:06:29.470> see<00:06:30.720> the<00:06:31.720> scarab<00:06:32.020> is

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:32.080 
fellow UNSC s you can see the scarab is

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.080 
fellow UNSC s you can see the scarab is
mid<00:06:32.260> explosion<00:06:32.860> I<00:06:32.950> think<00:06:33.160> you<00:06:33.220> can<00:06:33.340> take<00:06:34.030> a

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:34.090 
mid explosion I think you can take a

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:36.960 
mid explosion I think you can take a
frame<00:06:34.360> forward<00:06:34.690> or<00:06:34.870> to<00:06:35.020> J<00:06:35.380> and<00:06:35.610> you<00:06:36.610> know<00:06:36.700> see

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:36.970 
frame forward or to J and you know see

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:39.060 
frame forward or to J and you know see
all<00:06:37.090> the<00:06:37.210> objects<00:06:37.990> in<00:06:38.080> physics<00:06:38.500> going<00:06:38.740> through

all the objects in physics going through

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:40.740 
all the objects in physics going through

matchmaking<00:06:59.230> so<00:06:59.680> there<00:07:00.460> really<00:07:00.580> is<00:07:00.850> a<00:07:01.060> lot<00:07:01.510> of

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:01.540 
matchmaking so there really is a lot of

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:04.560 
matchmaking so there really is a lot of
things<00:07:01.810> that<00:07:02.020> you<00:07:02.140> can<00:07:02.350> do<00:07:02.710> in<00:07:03.070> halo<00:07:03.640> 3<00:07:03.940> and<00:07:04.210> as

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:04.570 
things that you can do in halo 3 and as

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:06.960 
things that you can do in halo 3 and as
I<00:07:05.050> say<00:07:05.170> each<00:07:05.380> piece<00:07:05.680> you<00:07:05.950> can<00:07:06.100> do<00:07:06.550> both<00:07:06.820> with

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:06.970 
I say each piece you can do both with

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:08.400 
I say each piece you can do both with
your<00:07:07.060> friends<00:07:07.420> or<00:07:07.540> on<00:07:07.630> your<00:07:07.720> own<00:07:07.870> so<00:07:08.110> it's

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:08.410 
your friends or on your own so it's

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:13.440 
your friends or on your own so it's
really<00:07:09.690> taking<00:07:10.690> what<00:07:10.870> was<00:07:11.400> great<00:07:12.400> things<00:07:13.300> that

really taking what was great things that

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:14.640 
really taking what was great things that
we<00:07:13.510> liked<00:07:13.720> about<00:07:13.840> halo<00:07:14.140> 1<00:07:14.380> like<00:07:14.560> the

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:14.650 
we liked about halo 1 like the

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:18.210 
we liked about halo 1 like the
large-scale<00:07:15.190> battles<00:07:16.230> the<00:07:17.230> social<00:07:18.100> and

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:18.220 
large-scale battles the social and

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:21.090 
large-scale battles the social and
community<00:07:18.550> side<00:07:18.850> of<00:07:19.090> halo<00:07:19.420> 2<00:07:19.480> and<00:07:20.230> then<00:07:20.650> really

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:21.100 
community side of halo 2 and then really

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:23.790 
community side of halo 2 and then really
realizing<00:07:22.110> making<00:07:23.110> sure<00:07:23.260> we<00:07:23.380> had<00:07:23.530> all<00:07:23.560> the

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:23.800 
realizing making sure we had all the

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.170 
realizing making sure we had all the
time<00:07:24.010> to<00:07:24.190> do<00:07:24.310> all<00:07:24.460> the<00:07:24.580> things<00:07:24.760> that<00:07:24.880> we<00:07:24.970> wanted

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:25.180 
time to do all the things that we wanted

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:27.420 
time to do all the things that we wanted

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:27.430 
to do for halo 3 so halo 3 is the halo

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:28.650 
to do for halo 3 so halo 3 is the halo
game<00:07:27.610> that<00:07:27.760> we<00:07:27.850> really<00:07:28.090> wanted<00:07:28.270> to<00:07:28.330> create<00:07:28.630> a

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:28.660 
game that we really wanted to create a

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:31.080 
game that we really wanted to create a
