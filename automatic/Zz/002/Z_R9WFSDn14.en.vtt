00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.910 
tickets so for those who have not
watched<00:01:22.550> the<00:01:22.850> big<00:01:23.060> finale<00:01:23.660> Tekkit<00:01:24.500> it<00:01:24.620> is<00:01:24.710> all

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
watched the big finale Tekkit it is all

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.990 
watched the big finale Tekkit it is all
over<00:01:25.160> with<00:01:25.460> five<00:01:26.180> and<00:01:26.690> then<00:01:27.260> point<00:01:27.980> 1<00:01:28.970> and

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
over with five and then point 1 and

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.300 
over with five and then point 1 and
point<00:01:29.240> 2<00:01:29.480> so<00:01:29.900> I<00:01:29.930> guess<00:01:30.140> seven<00:01:30.590> seasons<00:01:31.190> of

this is my domain of course building

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.420 
this is my domain of course building
underground<00:03:10.500> be<00:03:10.710> a<00:03:10.740> lot<00:03:10.890> easier<00:03:10.920> because<00:03:11.310> you

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
underground be a lot easier because you

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:12.830 
underground be a lot easier because you

that's<00:03:30.690> a<00:03:30.810> good<00:03:30.930> idea<00:03:31.430> or<00:03:32.430> maybe<00:03:32.489> underwater<00:03:33.180> I

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450
