scallions and add them to the mint as

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.020 
scallions and add them to the mint as
well<00:01:33.720> now<00:01:34.710> once<00:01:34.950> you've<00:01:35.130> got<00:01:35.159> to<00:01:35.460> this<00:01:35.610> stage

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
well now once you've got to this stage

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.160 
well now once you've got to this stage
you<00:01:36.840> then<00:01:37.049> need<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.890> add<00:01:38.009> some<00:01:38.909> sugar<00:01:39.049> to<00:01:40.049> the

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
you then need to add some sugar to the

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.499 
you then need to add some sugar to the
mixing<00:01:40.590> bowl<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:41.119> basically<00:01:42.119> you're<00:01:42.299> not

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
mixing bowl and basically you're not

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.389 
mixing bowl and basically you're not
looking<00:01:42.930> for<00:01:43.200> enough<00:01:43.500> to<00:01:43.680> be<00:01:43.799> able<00:01:43.860> to<00:01:44.100> mix

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
looking for enough to be able to mix

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:50.260 
looking for enough to be able to mix
through<00:01:44.899> the<00:01:45.899> whole<00:01:46.140> of<00:01:47.270> your<00:01:48.270> leaves<00:01:48.770> so<00:01:49.770> that

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
through the whole of your leaves so that

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:57.550 
through the whole of your leaves so that
the<00:01:51.270> leaves<00:01:51.479> are<00:01:51.840> fully<00:01:52.409> coated<00:01:53.600> with<00:01:54.600> sugar

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.160 

you're<00:01:58.560> then<00:01:58.710> going<00:01:58.860> to<00:01:58.979> leave<00:01:59.130> that<00:01:59.159> standing

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
you're then going to leave that standing

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.179 
you're then going to leave that standing
for<00:02:01.170> about<00:02:01.439> now<00:02:01.710> or<00:02:01.950> so<00:02:02.219> and<00:02:03.619> what<00:02:04.619> will<00:02:04.829> happen

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
for about now or so and what will happen

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:10.279 
for about now or so and what will happen
is<00:02:05.340> that<00:02:05.369> the<00:02:05.759> sugar<00:02:06.060> will<00:02:06.780> help<00:02:07.489> draw<00:02:08.489> out<00:02:09.289> the

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
is that the sugar will help draw out the

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.680 
is that the sugar will help draw out the
mint<00:02:10.560> taste

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.600 

well<00:02:15.690> this<00:02:15.870> has<00:02:15.990> now<00:02:16.140> been<00:02:16.260> standing<00:02:16.770> for<00:02:16.830> an

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
well this has now been standing for an

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.580 
well this has now been standing for an
hour<00:02:17.880> and<00:02:19.040> if<00:02:20.040> it<00:02:20.400> a<00:02:20.430> quick<00:02:20.700> stir<00:02:21.260> you'll<00:02:22.260> see

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
hour and if it a quick stir you'll see

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:29.560 
hour and if it a quick stir you'll see
that<00:02:23.450> the<00:02:24.450> sugar<00:02:26.900> is<00:02:27.900> quite<00:02:28.350> dumped

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 
that the sugar is quite dumped

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.540 
that the sugar is quite dumped
underneath<00:02:30.830> basically<00:02:31.830> it's<00:02:31.920> been<00:02:32.130> drawing

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
underneath basically it's been drawing

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:41.270 
underneath basically it's been drawing
out<00:02:34.100> liquid<00:02:35.100> in<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:35.610> leaves<00:02:35.910> and<00:02:40.220> what<00:02:41.220> I'm

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:30.740 
what we're going to do is add in a
little<00:03:25.740> bit<00:03:25.890> of<00:03:26.070> sugar<00:03:26.840> to<00:03:27.840> taste<00:03:28.100> so<00:03:29.630> it's<00:03:30.630> up

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
little bit of sugar to taste so it's up

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.080 
little bit of sugar to taste so it's up
to<00:03:30.960> you<00:03:31.110> how<00:03:31.290> much<00:03:31.410> sugar<00:03:31.740> you<00:03:31.770> want<00:03:32.130> if<00:03:33.000> you

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
to you how much sugar you want if you

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.940 
to you how much sugar you want if you
like<00:03:33.270> it<00:03:33.450> really<00:03:34.320> tart<00:03:35.060> then<00:03:36.740> obviously<00:03:37.740> less

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
like it really tart then obviously less

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:45.920 
like it really tart then obviously less
sugar<00:03:42.470> well<00:03:43.470> I'm<00:03:43.890> just<00:03:44.130> going<00:03:44.340> to<00:03:44.540> test<00:03:45.540> a

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
sugar well I'm just going to test a

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.420 
sugar well I'm just going to test a
little<00:03:46.350> bit<00:03:46.910> of<00:03:47.910> this<00:03:48.150> to<00:03:48.470> see<00:03:49.470> if<00:03:49.530> it's<00:03:49.800> sweet

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
little bit of this to see if it's sweet

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:57.270 
little bit of this to see if it's sweet
enough

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.160 

well<00:03:57.910> I<00:03:57.940> would<00:03:58.150> say<00:03:58.240> that<00:03:58.420> to<00:03:58.570> need<00:03:58.720> a<00:03:58.750> little

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
well I would say that to need a little

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.240 
well I would say that to need a little
bit<00:03:59.320> more<00:03:59.620> sugar<00:03:59.830> before<00:04:00.730> we<00:04:01.000> put<00:04:01.180> it<00:04:02.040> okay

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
bit more sugar before we put it okay

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:08.030 
bit more sugar before we put it okay
just<00:04:04.950> here's<00:04:05.950> one<00:04:06.430> of<00:04:06.520> the<00:04:06.580> jars<00:04:06.790> just<00:04:07.420> made

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
just here's one of the jars just made

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.200 
just here's one of the jars just made
now<00:04:09.040> best<00:04:09.340> thing<00:04:09.460> to<00:04:09.490> do<00:04:09.640> is<00:04:09.820> leave<00:04:10.030> it

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:10.210 
now best thing to do is leave it

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:12.150 
now best thing to do is leave it
standing<00:04:10.480> for<00:04:10.840> at<00:04:10.960> least<00:04:11.200> a<00:04:11.440> week<00:04:11.620> before<00:04:11.650> you

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
standing for at least a week before you

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.880 
standing for at least a week before you
use<00:04:12.400> it<00:04:12.580> and<00:04:12.760> in<00:04:13.570> that<00:04:13.810> time<00:04:14.170> it<00:04:14.380> will<00:04:14.500> allow

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:14.890 
use it and in that time it will allow

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:19.319 
use it and in that time it will allow
the<00:04:15.700> mint<00:04:16.030> flavor<00:04:16.410> to<00:04:17.410> seep<00:04:17.769> through<00:04:18.239> into<00:04:19.239> the

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329 
the mint flavor to seep through into the

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:21.660 
the mint flavor to seep through into the
vinegar
