 If with

 these days is giving much digital terrestrial television 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.810
 this is an application of digital media technologies to transmission of 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.119
 contained through a conventional antenna applying the technology 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:07.680
 digital, greater possibilities are obtained, such as providing a greater number of channels 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.350
 Best image quality godoy margin high definition yamaha hb sheet and 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:13.329
 definition 

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:17.329
 and the best sound quality also known as the digital dolby this one 

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:20.370
 defined by the technology used to emit the signal on the contrary the 

00:02:20.369 --> 00:02:24.109
 traditional television digital television encodes its signals in a way 

00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:27.859
 binary enabling new options as we are then what are these 

00:02:27.859 --> 00:02:28.869
 windows 

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:31.659
 First 

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:34.359
 the operator offers all the possibilities of interaction with the 

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:38.790
 remote control with the sixth bishop d encoder the viewer may 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.689
 perform several operations 

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:43.429
 2 a better decision 

00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:46.759
 image and sound the noise and interference of the signal is 

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:50.130
 will substantially reduce the same as the presence of double images 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.990
 usually in analog television the audio quality will improve even 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:57.549
 you can have surround sound distributed by several speakers 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:00.469
 similar to what is offered in the so-called home theater 

00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:03.489
 digital television will allow more programs to be included in the guide 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:05.619
 programming electronics with a menu 

00:03:05.619 --> 00:03:08.619
 about the available programming 

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:14.439
 but how digital television looks 

00:03:14.999 --> 00:03:18.449
 has studio pieces from the respective television channels that 

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:20.319
 they broadcast their signal to a satellite 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:24.369
 that fulfills its function as receiver and transmitter after receiving the signal sends 

00:03:24.369 --> 00:03:27.319
 some strategic points located in different areas of the territory 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:29.069
 Colombian 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:32.479
 these receiving antennas finally send the signal to our home
