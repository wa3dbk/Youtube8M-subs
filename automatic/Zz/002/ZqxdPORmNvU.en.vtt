 Do you want to check it out? 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.039
 I do not say let's start it as I said 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:57.809
 For you guys I'm going to use that amazon and thence 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:01:00.690
 It's true my color is medium abedi who 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.300
 You can not see why it does not focus. 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.100
 middle abedi I'll apply in the middle of 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.560
 face like I always do to show 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.950
 for you so let's go 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.740
 I think she the color of her I think she 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.259
 could have more choice of hides 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.180
 knows that the cs may have a little bit 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.090
 more color options 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:24.180
 but it's all worked out well to mix 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.100
 also right on the blog I'll leave all 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.159
 the color options you have 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.479
 She's so good to spread that I'm 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.439
 without anything on the skin 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:36.240
 I was not kaymer august with 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:39.090
 consistency as well as liquidity 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.400
 unlimited we run but the 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.280
 liquid consistency then apply with 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:49.140
 Fingers right, same for not 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:53.640
 brush interference nothing she promises 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:57.030
 average coverage for high 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.880
 Okay, we'll check it out here with 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.939
 you 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:03.759
 check with you if you really are more 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:08.080
 alesi straw very well she should very well 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:10.720
 on the skin is this a super positive point 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.239
 she spreads she does not look so sticky 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.970
 You know when those bases stick together? 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:20.019
 the kind who says she is in Berenice 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:22.599
 dem had this right here and is no longer 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:25.180
 He found only on the small half 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:27.730
 Face half the side of here I play more 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.830
 applied clear that you can see right and 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.230
 half the side of here I do not touch there by 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:35.470
 within the applied call that I think 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:37.630
 this right base as you can see 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.150
 it promises average coverage for the 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.910
 I particularly do not think a 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.099
 high coverage did not find coverage 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:48.099
 because it has a very 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:50.110
 It seems like your skin knows how to get there. 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:51.760
 a little bit closer has a knot 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.890
 I do not know if you can see if 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.769
 You'll be able to focus but she's not the one 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:59.610
 base that leaves you face-to-face 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:02.350
 You know, I really like it in her. 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.569
 As I already said, it's super yummy. 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:07.180
 The practice of applying the base is 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:10.660
 creamy so it adedy well on the skin 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:13.150
 do you know when coverage 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.829
 average I told you here 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.590
 fulfill my little look 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:20.350
 Of course I need a correction. 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.690
 greatly minimized the spots she had 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.130
 evenly matted my skin but I 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.730
 would say that it is a medium to 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:30.660
 lightweight we will apply on the bottom of the 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:33.579
 another part of the face and back to you 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.799
 ready girls I came back to whom a layer 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:37.930
 in all the right face I did not apply 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:40.480
 collective I was not good enough to 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.910
 you see that the final result is only 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.620
 with the mazda and really looks then 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.370
 Coming back recapitulating is a little bit 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.769
 for you 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.930
 this basis it has a formulation to 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:52.989
 chain she was super good in photos 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:56.230
 movies like this gives a super cool finish 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:58.540
 certain uniform the skin is high 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.190
 I do not think she covers faith. 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.769
 presents a high coverage I think 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.450
 coverage her average is right here 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:06.430
 for you to see the same 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:08.650
 she has not fulfilled perfectly the 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.870
 right goalkeeper but think she wants 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:13.750
 that the average coverage is very good 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:16.150
 really even the skin and disguise 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:19.810
 and fine lines as committed 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:22.150
 sure to provide a soft touch and 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.950
 Perfect appearance really the touch 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.590
 It's super soft it seems like you do not 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.310
 it's using base it seems I do not touch anything 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.770
 like this 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:31.510
 I do not think it's wonderful, I think she's super 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.370
 always follow my face 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:36.130
 as long as I think I do not need 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:38.860
 of applying certain powder but I go 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.510
 apply here for you see it 's I think 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.470
 that you do not need to apply powder 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:44.050
 with her 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:46.930
 certain due to the finishes and quinho 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:49.060
 that it leaves the skin they have most to 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.220
 tell you 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.560
 the perfect appearance really think 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:56.110
 it belongs to skin or not you do not 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.990
 with that face of you with bases abiding 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:01.900
 so I really enjoyed it a lot 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:04.389
 base it costs 27 90 what I think the 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:06.610
 positive consultant the packaging is well 

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:08.860
 cool well with this dosing nozzle here 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:12.039
 that helps us not to waste 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:14.560
 product a negative point is that the large 

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:17.830
 Most bases come 30ml 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:19.810
 and the one that comes with 20 ml 97 grams and 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:22.840
 knows it comes with 20 grams 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:25.870
 although the price of them is lower it also 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:28.690
 has less product right as I said 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:32.200
 I'll give you a shot, I'll go 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:34.450
 use that hence the right cosmetic eesc 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:36.160
 intimately before applying the powder I go 

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:37.090
 make a transfer test to 

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:41.650
 you 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:47.849
 otto here with my cell phone right c'mon 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:52.090
 see if transfer people do not transfer 

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:56.229
 shocked they did not bring very nice people 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:58.060
 in relation to the duration of work is not 

00:05:56.229 --> 00:05:59.889
 a base so my god will not be with 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:03.340
 she's always on the face but she lasts 

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:06.220
 very worthily that 's how I put it to 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:09.580
 work morning and afternoon draw already 

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:11.409
 I have listened to you, and obviously there is 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:14.139

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:16.539
 sulik glue on the skin but it has a 

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:18.429
 supersuper super cool and the best 

00:06:16.539 --> 00:06:21.429

00:06:23.469 --> 00:06:27.819

00:06:25.869 --> 00:06:31.179
 well Fofão achievement will take over

 and I will apply that so not only to you 

00:06:31.179 --> 00:06:37.800
 that it does not make so much difference 

00:06:34.089 --> 00:06:41.559
 not because the base is already here, but also 

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:44.889
 one side agreed powder sides and gives super 

00:06:41.559 --> 00:06:47.619
