00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:08.660
 Regarding the origin of the vegetables, our sample showed that 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:12.820
 only 8% of the vegetables from the central vega were 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.330
 out of the Chilean norm the other supermarket without change the figure 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.560
 reached 25% 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.440
 however supposedly the vega where you buy a thorn that contained here 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:28.260
 allowed an unauthorized pesticide in the European Union in Chile 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:32.020
 unfortunately the pesticides do not register knows 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.600
 and this time I'm busy with the health of vegetables 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.600
 novel coming out of health 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.260
 and the proof is that they know for many years I do not believe or any 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.520
 of pesticides that are being banned internationally 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.160
 teaching is the product of production 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.280
 the European Union 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.280
 documentation for updating that record 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.570
 the companies are not willing to continue with the project 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.979
 jesus maria elena soda many infinite months 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:09.910
 if they do not renew chicherit mixed and the european union chávez 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:14.900
 2 will not meet the high standards required if you are far from that attitude 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.720
 preventive an ordinary citizen asks the question English port do not stop to 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.560
 this 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:27.650
 the ex-military man is outrageous for it even though they are highly requested 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.290
 I tried 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.050
 I think of you 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.940
 is the lack of political will 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.630
 the most disturbing unusual 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.070
 is that the export fruit industry does comply with all 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.619
 international standards otherwise the Chilean fruit could not enter the 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:48.810
 European Union market and the United States the vegetables instead 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.810
 they are only intended for internal consumption 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.110
 I am still behind the analysis pp this product so 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.060
 outside of stable regulatory agreements such as concentration is maximum 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.840
 in developed countries 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.400
 and if that is correct 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.910
 it's something that we have 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.069
 to work in our country as it was done 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:12.789
 the whole export agroindustry 

00:02:12.789 --> 00:02:16.859
 p phenomenon that this regulatory process is subject to 

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:22.239
 We want to find out who is failing in the audit of 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:23.449
 the vegetables 

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:27.869
 We went to the meadow to inform them of a lot of study, that is, 8% of the 

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:31.659
 analyzed samples from this site if it exceeds the amount of 

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:36.539
 pesticides allowed by Chilean retro-law for example by buying for the 

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:37.120
 I presented 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.140
 We are worried about the independent vocento work group but I think that 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:42.970
 it was not achieved because it's over 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.810
 any statistical data for certain consumption controlled by the PSOE 

00:02:47.429 --> 00:02:50.309
 This promising day 

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:52.779
 de la vega will do everything possible 

00:02:52.779 --> 00:02:57.419
 so that this margin of 8% disappears or do vázquez 

00:03:01.969 --> 00:03:04.879
 the same we made a goal of supermarkets I'm going to die 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:07.879
 received 25% of the Chilean norm 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.149
 learn many 

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:14.320
 results distributing so an unexpected result 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.709
 the markets are surprised 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:21.219
 because both have to demand certificates and sufferers that demonstrate 

00:03:21.219 --> 00:03:23.219
 that comply with current regulations 

00:03:23.219 --> 00:03:27.219
 we want to know if they make consumption among the banks themselves in the 

00:03:27.219 --> 00:03:30.219
 periodic monitoring community 

00:03:30.219 --> 00:03:32.519
 since that day - Sunday 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:33.379
 usually 

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:36.269
 the death wounded to the product in showcase 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:40.750
 if they are sent to certified laboratory in have to the records because they are not 

00:03:40.749 --> 00:03:43.749
 desired among teenagers 

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:46.729
 I do not have details of what it can 

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:51.069
 further back still maintained by account our commune ortega 30 hours a candle 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:55.069
 As a producer, it is worth asking what measures to take before supermarkets to 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:56.649
 avoid that despite their controls 

00:03:56.649 --> 00:03:59.649
 in as much the states as the found ones 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:03.319
 in demonstrating being put on the current regulations 

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:08.280
 acens set put obstacles for some a party or a vote plus a measure 

00:04:08.279 --> 00:04:13.200
 radical good in the short term we have veiled the withdrawal of all the 

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:17.359
 misery involved regarding the past in the area as the measure 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:19.389
 the doctor and until I josé 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:22.660
 sectors that the progress of the hierarchy that these products 

00:04:23.499 --> 00:04:26.499
 they have the regulation with the current regulations 

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:32.029
 the investigation carries it understands it 

00:04:32.029 --> 00:04:33.910
 we focus on lettuce 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:36.910
 for being the vegetables worst evaluated 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:39.610
 clinton who used the chemicals 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:41.840
 complying with the indications on the label 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.740
 that is, respecting justice and the period of grace 15 time 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.740
 must wait between the club application 

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:52.360
 they tell me 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:57.460
 seven to ten days is a pigment the inflamed 15 days 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.610
 and there is the producer then what with the tie 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.529
 the new norm 

00:05:02.529 --> 00:05:04.749
 a mysterious 

00:05:04.749 --> 00:05:07.559
 lithium that protects us because we are not capable 

00:05:07.559 --> 00:05:10.559
 to confirm maximum allowed 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.729
 because respecting the lack as well as exceeding the norms 

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:20.699
 the new Chilean norm came into force in February of this year I receive 

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:21.629
 and producers 

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:26.419
 both chemistries like that have not existed to update the time and 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:31.139
 simplicity disappeared to meet the limits that the law requires leave a 

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:31.770
 message 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:34.700
 has explained that this act of protest the lenders 

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:38.839
 palina or by others that what needs to be done and that what the operation 

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:40.699
 these araque 

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:45.990
 this Monday 3 in jumps with that knows limits so low there are three years there 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:48.990
 say they fear that the increasing competition 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:58.050
 the team do not know what happened in reality 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:02.000
 because if it really is a real lesson and there are so many days 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.889
 respect the product that we lack 

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:07.889
 when proceeding ac / dc 

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:14.129
 the consumer will wonder if there is any way to protect themselves from the cold 

00:06:14.129 --> 00:06:14.659
 rows 

00:06:14.659 --> 00:06:16.879
 washing taking the 60 years 

00:06:16.879 --> 00:06:19.879
 the answer is no 

00:06:21.309 --> 00:06:25.929
 start current systemic costs that is to say that while the pulp of the 

00:06:25.929 --> 00:06:27.379
 sinister fruit 

00:06:27.379 --> 00:06:28.699
 Before this panorama 

00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:32.990
 The only thing that can and should be the consumer is a severe one 

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:34.529
 inspection 

00:06:34.529 --> 00:06:39.280
 after a long time ago dv right all these years other 

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:42.280
 of course I've never done 

00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:46.430
 the study can be the same 

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:48.969
 the water saving is invincible 

00:06:48.969 --> 00:06:51.969
 white in the program in the root 

00:06:53.839 --> 00:06:58.409
 roma - the first moment obviously Alzheimer's patients 

00:06:58.409 --> 00:07:01.979
 at least be the owner this problem was signal is clear 

00:07:01.979 --> 00:07:05.389
 declares the industry that provides food 

00:07:05.389 --> 00:07:09.300
 Since he entered into arrears he reiterated, for example, in relation to 

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:10.999
 beginning of next month 

00:07:10.999 --> 00:07:14.159
 in that sense I see a one sign of protest
