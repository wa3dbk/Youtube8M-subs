00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.800
 how to successfully start a farm 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.259
 rabbits 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.300
 Rabbit farming is defined as the technique 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:31.130
 aimed at breeding and promoting the 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.780
 reproduction of rabbits in order 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.980
 to take advantage of their products and their 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.980
 products like skin and meat 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.410
 nowadays the rabbit breeding has gone from 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.200
 the family farm to exploitation 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.790
 Industrial breeding animals 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.800
 for the production of 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:49.140
 food is crucially important in 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.239
 the economic potential of a country 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.129
 the need to produce food and 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.989
 provide work to the human being is in the 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.080
 present a key objective for the 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.850
 livestock, considering this situation 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.070
 Rabbit breeding is an excellent 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.080
 alternative because it has qualities that 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.420
 they benefit both the producer and the 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.759
 to the one who consumes it 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.619
 this viability that you have should be 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:12.150
 seized by those interested in their 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.610
 breeding as an alternative to produce 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.590
 meat and skins quality food that 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.570
 can be profitable considering the 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.260
 crucial aspects that should be taken in 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.310
 account for your production 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:26.470
 5 starting points 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.329
 and rabbit farming should be 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.399
 profitable and economically efficient 

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:32.470
 speaking to achieve such an end is 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:34.200
 It is essential to submit it to a process 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.729
 administrative like any company 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.860
 setting goals policy goals 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:40.600
 and programs that allow us to evaluate 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.700
 results and know the degree of 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.560
 economic satisfaction 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.780
 to achieve success and evaluate 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.430
 results previous to the actual obtaining 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.530
 of them should be planned the 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.570
 production what will help us choose 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.250
 the right options and decisions for 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.799
 achieve the objectives of the company 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.780
 cunicola all the processes that 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:01.909
 will take place on the holding they should 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.189
 be calculated and planned to avoid 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:06.840
 inadequate procedures or procedures that are not 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:08.759
 transcendent 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.950
 and the planning of the production is 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.959
 simple because it is enough to establish the 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.060
 number of animals that you want to obtain 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.519
 to also calculate the amount of 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.680
 Necessary parents know the cycle 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:21.780
 productive reproductive percentages 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:26.360
 fertility rate viability of 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.360
 litters reproductive cycle among others 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.379
 the production is simple because it is enough 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.569
 establish the number of animals that 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:35.579
 you want to get to also calculate the 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:38.159
 number of parents needed 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:39.709
 know the productive cycle percentages 

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:42.030
 reproductive fertility rate 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:45.520
 Feasibility of cycle litters 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:47.740
 reproductive among others 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.660
 and produce ten rabbits per week 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.550
 to determine everything that is required 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.890
 To achieve this goal, we must follow 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.450
 the next process which as I already know 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.250
 mentioned can be adjusted to the 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.230
 actual quantities that are intended 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.550
 get but taking into account the 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.550
 parameters that are indicated 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.730
 and exploit and with those producers for 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.530
 start the production process should be 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.450
 have the right amount of 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.220
 parents who will help produce the 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.870
 number of offspring determined in a 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.750
 precise time 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.280
 I will occupy square meters should be taken 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.769
 consider the different stages 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.659
 productive of the animals with it 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:25.190
 manages to determine the square meters 

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:26.900
 which are required for the correct 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.480
 installation of cages for 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:32.480
 female females stallions replacement 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.489
 replacement males and fattening area in 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.470
 base to measure and cage number is 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:38.060
 will have idea of ​​the amount of ground 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:41.380
 use and how is it that they should be 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:43.360
 correctly locate the cages 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:46.180
 and the distribution of spaces in 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:48.340
 this case is proposed in rows type flyer 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.980
 Generally three aisles are considered 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:53.200
 four lines of central cages and two 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:56.700
 laterals and a corridor perpendicular to 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.700
 longitudinal axis of the central nave 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:01.260
 work h hours a day the time 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.270
 intended for the management of the farm 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.250
 it depends on each activity to be carried out and 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:07.340
 to the size of the holding number of 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.709
 animals 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.390
 and feeding is considered a time of 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:14.150
 one and a half hours to make the 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:17.840
 work daily reproductive management 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:20.329
 you ride the time allocated to each mountain 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.919
 It takes 3 to 5 minutes as long as it can 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:24.290
 get to vary depending on the 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:26.690
 receptivity of the female diagnoses 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:28.669
 of gestation the duration in each 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:31.800
 pregnancy diagnosis is around 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:34.319
 of five minutes per female 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.180
 nest placement this activity takes 

00:04:34.319 --> 00:04:38.340
 about two minutes per female 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.139
 positive feature that may vary 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.449
 depending on the number of females that 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:44.669
 have been positive or negative to 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:46.650
 the palpation handling of the 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:48.930
 biostimulation this operation takes 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.819
 around five minutes per female already 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:54.210
 that it is required to take out the nest and review 

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:55.800
 the litter review of facilities and 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:58.169
 team this work does not necessarily 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:00.060
 has to be done daily and the end is 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:01.919
 detect possible equipment failures 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:04.710
 that threaten security or 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:06.840
 animal health 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:08.790
 and investing that weight is the goal in 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.140
 all the planning and methods of 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:12.240
 production is to get a maximum 

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:14.490
 performance of animals with a 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:17.160
 minimum investment to appreciate a 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:19.290
 expected return on investment 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:22.310
 represents starting the operation with a 

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:24.680
 money that should be returned 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:27.080
 the facilities are the first step of 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.940
 the investment the facilities may 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.400
 be from the simplest to the 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:34.070
 more sophisticated the capital with which 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:36.050
 count will mark the limitations the 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:40.060
 material and equipment constitute another 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:40.060
 aspect with repercussion in the investment 

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:44.279
 Another aspect for investment is the 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:46.379
 own acquisition of the animals to 

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:48.059
 to exploit, it is convenient to invest in 

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:50.069
 good quality players 

00:05:48.059 --> 00:05:52.259
 come from a farm specializing in 

00:05:50.069 --> 00:05:54.479
 the sale of breeding stock with conditions 

00:05:52.259 --> 00:05:58.220
 sanitary and acceptable management 

00:05:54.479 --> 00:06:00.590
 that good results are guaranteed 

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:02.540
 he cunicultor must foresee half a year of 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:04.670
 expenses without income since the animals 

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:06.920
 usually acquired between 2 and 3 months 

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:08.890
 of age and therefore up to one or two 

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:11.840
 months will not start the reproduction 

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:13.970
 during this period they must support 

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:16.490
 the necessary expenses like those of 

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:18.770
 food health services energy 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:21.760
 water that should be covered by a 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:23.680
 working capital 

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:26.170
 just like any other activity 

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:28.150
 agriculture in rabbit breeding may be 

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:30.100
 talk about good profitability alone 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:32.590
 when financial management has been 

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:34.300
 the successful a good control of this 

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:36.190
 management will let us know the points 

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:38.110
 weak and strong activity 

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:41.060
 allowing to establish the level of 

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:44.260
 profit in the business 

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:44.260
 thanks for your attention
