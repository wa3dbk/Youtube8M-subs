one similar to it from antenna deals.com

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.710 
one similar to it from antenna deals.com
and<00:00:18.949> a<00:00:19.949> lot<00:00:20.490> of<00:00:20.520> people<00:00:20.789> ask<00:00:21.029> how<00:00:21.510> do<00:00:21.570> you

protect against lightning or static

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.460 
protect against lightning or static
build-up<00:00:26.039> for<00:00:26.930> anything<00:00:27.930> along<00:00:28.170> those<00:00:28.349> lines

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
build-up for anything along those lines

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.460 
build-up for anything along those lines
and<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:28.920> answer<00:00:29.160> is<00:00:29.310> a<00:00:29.550> surge<00:00:30.000> protector

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:30.470 
and the answer is a surge protector

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.670 
and the answer is a surge protector
right<00:00:31.470> here<00:00:32.719> we<00:00:33.719> get<00:00:33.960> up<00:00:34.079> close<00:00:34.260> to<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.469> camera

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
right here we get up close to the camera

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.240 
right here we get up close to the camera
for<00:00:34.980> you

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.820 

so<00:00:41.210> how<00:00:41.330> this<00:00:41.450> works<00:00:41.510> is<00:00:41.990> there's<00:00:42.410> a<00:00:42.530> thin

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:42.830 
so how this works is there's a thin

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.070 
so how this works is there's a thin
little<00:00:43.190> piece<00:00:43.460> of<00:00:43.610> metal<00:00:43.790> inside<00:00:44.300> of<00:00:44.540> here<00:00:44.780> and

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:45.080 
little piece of metal inside of here and

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.050 
little piece of metal inside of here and
when<00:00:45.860> there's<00:00:46.010> too<00:00:46.160> much<00:00:46.190> current<00:00:46.700> it

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:47.060 
when there's too much current it

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.510 
when there's too much current it
overheats<00:00:47.570> it<00:00:47.750> and<00:00:47.930> creates<00:00:48.770> an<00:00:48.830> open<00:00:49.100> circuit

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:49.520 
overheats it and creates an open circuit

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.580 
overheats it and creates an open circuit
basically<00:00:49.940> there's<00:00:50.570> nothing<00:00:50.900> from<00:00:51.110> here<00:00:51.350> to

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:51.590 
basically there's nothing from here to

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:53.560 
basically there's nothing from here to
here<00:00:51.800> it's<00:00:52.400> just<00:00:52.550> open<00:00:52.880> just<00:00:53.150> like<00:00:53.270> a<00:00:53.300> fuse

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 
here it's just open just like a fuse

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.170 
here it's just open just like a fuse
works<00:00:53.780> just<00:00:54.740> like<00:00:54.770> a<00:00:54.860> fuse<00:00:55.190> in<00:00:55.550> your<00:00:55.670> house<00:00:55.820> or

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180 
works just like a fuse in your house or

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.860 
works just like a fuse in your house or
your<00:00:56.390> car<00:00:56.660> works<00:00:56.930> you'll<00:00:57.740> see<00:00:57.980> a<00:00:58.720> little<00:00:59.720> piece

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
your car works you'll see a little piece

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.440 
your car works you'll see a little piece
of<00:00:59.900> metal<00:01:00.140> and<00:01:00.830> when<00:01:01.460> it<00:01:01.520> overheats<00:01:01.910> and<00:01:02.150> blows

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:02.450 
of metal and when it overheats and blows

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.320 
of metal and when it overheats and blows
it's<00:01:03.170> open<00:01:03.530> same<00:01:04.460> thing<00:01:04.610> with<00:01:04.730> this<00:01:04.850> very

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
it's open same thing with this very

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.980 
it's open same thing with this very
simple<00:01:05.690> so<00:01:06.970> they<00:01:07.970> actually<00:01:08.150> do<00:01:08.510> extend<00:01:08.900> your

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
simple so they actually do extend your

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:10.780 
simple so they actually do extend your
warranty<00:01:09.170> if<00:01:09.650> you<00:01:09.800> buy<00:01:09.920> a<00:01:09.950> fuse<00:01:10.280> with<00:01:10.460> it<00:01:10.580> I

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
warranty if you buy a fuse with it I

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.670 
warranty if you buy a fuse with it I
think<00:01:11.180> it's<00:01:11.300> by<00:01:11.450> like<00:01:11.660> two<00:01:11.900> or<00:01:12.020> three<00:01:12.170> years<00:01:12.440> or

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
think it's by like two or three years or

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.400 
think it's by like two or three years or
something<00:01:12.890> like<00:01:13.100> that<00:01:13.600> how<00:01:14.600> you<00:01:14.660> screwed<00:01:15.290> in

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:15.410 
something like that how you screwed in

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:22.840 
something like that how you screwed in
here<00:01:18.160> right<00:01:19.160> into<00:01:19.280> the<00:01:19.430> account<00:01:21.670> by<00:01:22.670> the<00:01:22.700> way

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
here right into the account by the way

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.250 
here right into the account by the way
this<00:01:23.030> is<00:01:23.090> the<00:01:23.180> one<00:01:23.300> that<00:01:23.390> goes<00:01:23.510> up<00:01:23.630> to<00:01:23.750> 150

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:24.260 
this is the one that goes up to 150

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.450 
this is the one that goes up to 150
miles<00:01:24.410> it<00:01:24.800> works<00:01:24.979> really<00:01:25.369> really<00:01:25.640> good<00:01:26.060> I

comes<00:01:35.390> with<00:01:35.570> it<00:01:37.300> right<00:01:38.300> here<00:01:38.509> with<00:01:39.080> a

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:39.430 
comes with it right here with a

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:45.700 
comes with it right here with a
weathering<00:01:40.430> sleeve<00:01:41.440> little<00:01:42.440> rubber<00:01:44.650> and<00:01:45.650> then

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
weathering sleeve little rubber and then

you just screw it in here also a lot of
people<00:01:47.630> ask<00:01:48.670> how<00:01:49.670> do<00:01:49.730> i<00:01:49.850> ground<00:01:50.180> my<00:01:50.360> system

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
people ask how do i ground my system

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.500 
people ask how do i ground my system
well<00:01:51.230> with<00:01:51.680> this<00:01:51.860> you<00:01:52.220> don't<00:01:52.310> need<00:01:52.520> to<00:01:52.760> because

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:53.510 
well with this you don't need to because

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:55.090 
well with this you don't need to because
if<00:01:53.690> there's<00:01:54.050> a<00:01:54.110> potential<00:01:54.409> lightning<00:01:54.860> strike

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
if there's a potential lightning strike

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.280 
if there's a potential lightning strike
if<00:01:55.250> there's<00:01:55.430> too<00:01:55.580> much<00:01:55.610> electricity<00:01:56.290> build-up

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
if there's too much electricity build-up

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.500 
if there's too much electricity build-up
it'll<00:01:57.860> short<00:01:58.100> fuse<00:01:58.460> this<00:01:58.790> will<00:01:59.000> also<00:01:59.300> protect

00:01:59.500 --> 00:01:59.510 
it'll short fuse this will also protect

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.800 
it'll short fuse this will also protect
your<00:01:59.840> TV<00:02:00.290> so<00:02:01.250> you<00:02:02.240> don't<00:02:02.360> have<00:02:02.450> to<00:02:02.540> worry<00:02:02.690> about

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
this will set sacrifice itself to save

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.910 
this will set sacrifice itself to save
your<00:02:08.060> antenna<00:02:08.420> the<00:02:08.959> control<00:02:09.229> box<00:02:09.500> that<00:02:09.709> comes

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
your antenna the control box that comes

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.789 
your antenna the control box that comes
with<00:02:10.160> it<00:02:10.310> so<00:02:11.150> you<00:02:11.209> cannot<00:02:11.530> it's<00:02:12.530> the<00:02:12.620> thing
