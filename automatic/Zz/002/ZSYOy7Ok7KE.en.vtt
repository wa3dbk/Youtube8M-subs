00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:07.080
 to build the conical perspective of 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.080
 a quadrilateral 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:13.420
 we're going to make that for example be a 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.420
 square 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:19.170
 we extend the lines of the square 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:22.350
 until they cut to the plane of the frame that 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.439
 is this picture plane in the line of 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:28.570
 land we also prolong these and 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:32.470
 they also cut there on the land line 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:34.540
 we mark the position of the point of view 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:38.340
 and its orthogonal projection on the 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.340
 box that is the main point 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.739
 and for today we make parallels 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:49.089
 to those addresses to this address and 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:50.990
 this one at two in the square and the same 

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:54.020
 these two 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:54.800
 obtaining the vanishing points of the 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.060
 square 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.250
 efe yf prima 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:01.920
 that means that the perspective of 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.330
 this line will be given as follows 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.920
 this direction by these two lines 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:11.580
 while the perspective of these two 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.920
 lines knowing that the end point 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.980
 of those lines would see this point of 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.860
 exactly here and this point is 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:22.040
 perspective of itself then we join this 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.930
 with the leak 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.930
 we come this with the other leak 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.790
 and we have to intersect the 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.490
 four lines there produces me the 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.200
 perspective of the square that wants 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.240
 say that the perspective of this 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.909
 square oblique to the plane of the 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.289
 picture 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.289
 it will be 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:50.710
 let's mark more what you would see 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:50.710
 outline of the picture plane would be this 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.860
 because after this line this 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.509
 as we know as a logy 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:16.480
 If I wanted to know the perspective of 

00:02:13.969 --> 00:02:20.580
 this current point corresponds 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.580
 so aligning this point as you see 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.520
 would cut me exactly here we have 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.600
 so that the perspective of is a 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.230
 cousin 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:33.060
 since the perspective is a homology 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:36.060
 because if this line cuts on the axis in 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.370
 this point his counterpart also and the 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.890
 points we are logos are aligned as 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.500
 see if I want to do this in perspective 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.780
 then drawing from above on the floor 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.550
 drawing on the line of land in line of 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.520
 coincident horizon as we come 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.830
 doing 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.810
 I pose the exact position of the point 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.390
 main point of view framework 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.340
 also the position in plant of 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.550
 quadrilateral for example that comes by 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.550
 here 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:06.240
 we are not taking action we do it 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:08.640
 everything more or less 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:11.180
 we have here the quadrilateral that is a 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.180
 square 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.890
 if it was not a square it would be 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.920
 exactly the same procedure 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:20.850
 we make parallel to its sides and it is already 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:23.290
 we draw the land line up here 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:25.330
 now we are drawing the elevation of 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.690
 this perspective and the line of 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:30.040
 horizon 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.040
 always parallel 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.489
 the traces of the lines that we are going to 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.910
 represent let's mark this in color 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:37.910
 as ay 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:44.470
 always the traces of the lines that 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.240
 we are going to represent a and b as they cut 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.380
 the ground line as the climb to the 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:52.330
 land line 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.330
 the same with this and with this 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.390
 doing by uve parallel to the two 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:01.060
 addresses 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:04.030
 I have here a vanishing point and here in the 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:06.100
 another vanishing point of the straight lines the 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:11.250
 vanishing point will be from these lines that 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:14.510
 It means that this leak will go 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:16.290
 the two lines are 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:19.440
 and this one 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:21.800
 while these two lines are going to go to 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.830
 this vanishing point from the trace to 

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:27.409
 this vanishing point 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:29.720
 I have therefore the perspective 

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:32.000
 from the ring 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:34.510
 let's put it in green so that 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.510
 Look better 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:43.139
 if I take any point of this 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:45.630
 square for example the point a and the 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:47.970
 line lined it up as you see I have here a 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:49.979
 point of intersection that means 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:51.960
 that if here was the plane and here 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:53.729
 is the figure then between 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.740
 sir see the perspective of that point 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:58.740
 here that means that when I 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:01.380
 missing data if I do here a 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:03.539
 vertical line this vertical is going to 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:05.490
 intercept this line at the point that 

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:07.680
 it was entered and day the perspective of this 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:09.120
 it would actually be through this is the 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.940
 point 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:15.150
 on the floor this is in perspective 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:17.160
 we could call him this as a cousin 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:19.530
 which would be resolved 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:21.440
 perspective if I want to complete this by 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:25.050
 example with a three-dimensional figure 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:28.729
 it could be a cube each of these 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:31.520
 vertices of the cube 

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:33.979
 we assemble here a figure in the part 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:36.050
 top of the figure the only thing that 

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:37.939
 we will have is to prolong this line and 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:39.919
 see that effectively when you raise here 

00:05:37.939 --> 00:05:41.230
 a vertical this distance is the same as 

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:43.450
 is 

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:45.010
 and how the two have the same point of 

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:47.080
 leak the one above and the one that is 

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:48.880
 below then the only thing I have to do 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:52.900
 is to take the height of the cube that in this 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:54.400
 case is equal to this side and place it to 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:57.160
 split 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:06:00.759
 of the line of the line playing towards 

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:04.389
 efe and lifting vertical because I have 

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:05.740
 and two vertical edges if he escaped 

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:08.620
 there 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:10.979
 if at this point I make a line and 

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:14.289
 I raise here another vertical there I have 

00:06:10.979 --> 00:06:16.869
 another edge of the juice 

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:19.029
 the same thing over here and I make another line and 

00:06:16.869 --> 00:06:21.699
 I raise here a vertical and I have already 

00:06:19.029 --> 00:06:24.430
 another list of the cube joining these 

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:28.180
 two would play there with which 

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:31.770
 I have complete already the figure would mark 

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:31.770
 well the edges of the cube 

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:38.880
 and always in the perspective you have to 

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:40.770
 meet those of others would be discontinuous 

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:45.440
 you have to meet the one that 

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:45.440
 parallel to the same point of fleeting 

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:53.150
 and that if they are horizontal those leaks go 

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:53.150
 to be on the horizon line
