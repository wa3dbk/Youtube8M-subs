00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.109 
come the cases don't interfere with that
so<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:10.110> way<00:01:10.140> I<00:01:10.290> found<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:10.979> easiest<00:01:11.010> is<00:01:11.729> if<00:01:12.000> you

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
so the way I found the easiest is if you

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.270 
so the way I found the easiest is if you
put<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.510> thicker<00:01:12.780> part<00:01:13.110> on<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.619> top<00:01:13.890> first

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
put the thicker part on the top first

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.480 
put the thicker part on the top first
and<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:15.630> then<00:01:15.869> you<00:01:16.020> just<00:01:16.259> snap<00:01:16.920> it<00:01:17.100> in<00:01:17.250> just

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
and and then you just snap it in just

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.160 
and and then you just snap it in just
like<00:01:17.640> this<00:01:17.930> two<00:01:18.930> seconds<00:01:19.439> you<00:01:19.530> can<00:01:19.680> have<00:01:19.710> it

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
like this two seconds you can have it

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.920 
like this two seconds you can have it
there<00:01:22.170> you<00:01:22.290> go<00:01:22.790> camera<00:01:23.790> nice<00:01:24.030> nice<00:01:24.540> cut<00:01:24.780> out

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
there you go camera nice nice cut out

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:25.720 
because this is a skin you don't see
that<00:02:24.260> but<00:02:24.560> this<00:02:24.769> is<00:02:25.040> where<00:02:25.220> your<00:02:25.340> Apple<00:02:25.670> logo

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
that but this is where your Apple logo

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.850 
that but this is where your Apple logo
would<00:02:26.090> be<00:02:26.150> big<00:02:27.019> opening<00:02:27.470> here<00:02:27.620> for<00:02:27.769> your

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
would be big opening here for your

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.009 
would be big opening here for your
camera<00:02:28.129> and<00:02:28.819> overall<00:02:29.269> this<00:02:29.450> feels<00:02:29.690> really

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.019 
camera and overall this feels really

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:31.720 
camera and overall this feels really
nice<00:02:30.200> and<00:02:30.560> again<00:02:30.620> this<00:02:31.010> isn't<00:02:31.220> really<00:02:31.459> for

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
nice and again this isn't really for

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.339 
nice and again this isn't really for
drop<00:02:31.970> so<00:02:32.269> if<00:02:32.360> you<00:02:32.480> were<00:02:32.659> to<00:02:32.959> actually<00:02:33.110> drop

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:33.349 
drop so if you were to actually drop

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:37.750 
drop so if you were to actually drop
this<00:02:34.000> I<00:02:35.000> don't<00:02:35.510> suggest<00:02:35.690> it<00:02:36.079> because<00:02:36.500> it's<00:02:37.400> not

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
this I don't suggest it because it's not

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.630 
this I don't suggest it because it's not
going<00:02:38.090> to<00:02:38.269> fully<00:02:38.810> protect<00:02:39.260> it<00:02:39.680> maybe<00:02:40.069> a<00:02:40.189> light

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.199 

one<00:02:43.640> point<00:02:44.030> drop<00:02:44.329> at<00:02:44.599> the<00:02:44.629> most<00:02:45.519> on<00:02:46.519> carpets

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
one point drop at the most on carpets

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:49.330 
one point drop at the most on carpets
really<00:02:47.780> really<00:02:48.079> soft<00:02:48.319> carpets

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
really really soft carpets

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.149 
really really soft carpets
it<00:02:49.819> won't<00:02:50.030> hurt<00:02:50.319> some<00:02:51.319> phone<00:02:51.530> cases<00:02:51.739> they're

00:02:52.149 --> 00:02:52.159 
it won't hurt some phone cases they're

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:54.300 
it won't hurt some phone cases they're
more<00:02:52.370> to<00:02:52.609> protect<00:02:52.819> the<00:02:53.060> back<00:02:53.329> of<00:02:53.510> the<00:02:53.599> device

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
more to protect the back of the device
