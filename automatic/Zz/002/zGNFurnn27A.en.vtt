year<00:01:44.430> yep<00:01:44.880> how<00:01:45.509> do<00:01:45.570> you<00:01:45.600> like<00:01:45.689> that<00:01:45.780> course<00:01:46.140> and

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
year yep how do you like that course and

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.260 
year yep how do you like that course and
I<00:01:46.470> was<00:01:46.740> compared<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.340> clockwise<00:01:48.000> last

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
I was compared to the clockwise last

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.810 
I was compared to the clockwise last
year<00:01:48.509> i<00:01:48.780> prefer<00:01:49.259> clockwise<00:01:49.700> you<00:01:50.700> know

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
year i prefer clockwise you know

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.149 
year i prefer clockwise you know
typically<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:52.140> well<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.560> idea<00:01:52.680> is<00:01:52.890> that<00:01:52.979> you

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
typically the well the idea is that you

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.920 
typically the well the idea is that you
know<00:01:53.310> this<00:01:53.460> way<00:01:53.700> so<00:01:53.759> counterclockwise<00:01:54.570> you

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
know this way so counterclockwise you

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.109 
know this way so counterclockwise you
kind<00:01:55.079> of<00:01:55.110> run<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.409> ramps<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:56.040> kind<00:01:56.759> of<00:01:56.850> you

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
kind of run the ramps and kind of you

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.940 
kind of run the ramps and kind of you
know<00:01:57.149> go<00:01:57.810> down<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.110> steep<00:01:58.320> like<00:01:58.530> can't<00:01:58.770> bird

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
know go down the steep like can't bird

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.080 
know go down the steep like can't bird
you're<00:01:59.189> running<00:01:59.430> up<00:01:59.520> all<00:01:59.640> the<00:01:59.729> way<00:01:59.790> to<00:01:59.850> 4chan

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
you're running up all the way to 4chan

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.399 
you're running up all the way to 4chan
you're<00:02:00.329> a<00:02:00.390> lot<00:02:00.479> of<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.600> way<00:02:00.659> up<00:02:00.780> Virginia's

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
you're a lot of the way up Virginia's

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:02.959 
you're a lot of the way up Virginia's
are<00:02:01.530> tempted<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:02.070> at<00:02:02.219> least<00:02:02.310> yeah<00:02:02.700> you've<00:02:02.939> got

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
are tempted to at least yeah you've got

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.940 
are tempted to at least yeah you've got
Sherman<00:02:03.540> road<00:02:03.719> you've<00:02:04.110> got<00:02:04.140> engineer<00:02:04.710> road

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
Sherman road you've got engineer road

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.679 
Sherman road you've got engineer road
you've<00:02:05.250> got<00:02:05.280> cam<00:02:05.579> bird<00:02:05.790> road<00:02:06.060> and<00:02:06.420> so<00:02:06.570> those

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
you've got cam bird road and so those

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.570 
you've got cam bird road and so those
are<00:02:06.869> all<00:02:06.960> kind<00:02:07.469> of<00:02:07.560> there's<00:02:08.280> definitely

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
are all kind of there's definitely

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.029 
are all kind of there's definitely
honorable<00:02:09.119> sections<00:02:09.509> and

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
honorable sections and

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.250 
honorable sections and
think<00:02:10.189> it<00:02:10.280> just<00:02:10.369> makes<00:02:10.610> it<00:02:10.700> harder<00:02:11.260> whereas

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
think it just makes it harder whereas

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
think it just makes it harder whereas
you<00:02:12.439> know<00:02:12.469> in<00:02:12.620> the<00:02:12.680> other<00:02:12.799> direction<00:02:12.920> you're

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
you know in the other direction you're

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.369 
you know in the other direction you're
definitely<00:02:13.790> hiking<00:02:14.269> all<00:02:14.390> the<00:02:14.510> ups<00:02:14.659> and<00:02:14.959> then

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:15.379 
definitely hiking all the ups and then

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:17.319 
definitely hiking all the ups and then
you<00:02:15.469> can<00:02:15.620> kind<00:02:15.739> of<00:02:15.859> just<00:02:15.920> coast<00:02:16.459> on<00:02:16.730> the<00:02:16.760> long

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:17.329 
you can kind of just coast on the long

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:19.720 
you can kind of just coast on the long
downhill<00:02:17.569> Road<00:02:17.900> so<00:02:18.319> I<00:02:18.560> think<00:02:18.859> that<00:02:19.040> the<00:02:19.579> other

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
downhill Road so I think that the other

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
downhill Road so I think that the other
direction<00:02:19.879> might<00:02:20.180> shoot<00:02:20.329> my<00:02:20.420> strengths<00:02:20.689> a

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
direction might shoot my strengths a

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.080 
direction might shoot my strengths a
little<00:02:20.959> better<00:02:21.079> but<00:02:21.409> you<00:02:22.129> know<00:02:22.159> it's<00:02:22.819> the<00:02:22.879> same

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
little better but you know it's the same

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.360 
little better but you know it's the same
amount<00:02:23.239> of<00:02:23.510> her<00:02:23.629> anyway<00:02:24.079> so<00:02:24.140> you<00:02:24.739> know<00:02:24.859> doesn't

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
amount of her anyway so you know doesn't

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.039 
amount of her anyway so you know doesn't
really<00:02:25.519> make<00:02:25.640> a<00:02:25.700> huge<00:02:25.909> difference<00:02:26.180> yeah<00:02:26.510> you

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:27.049 
really make a huge difference yeah you

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:30.880 
really make a huge difference yeah you
are<00:02:27.430> tend<00:02:28.430> to<00:02:28.609> err<00:02:29.329> on<00:02:29.359> the<00:02:29.629> side<00:02:29.900> of<00:02:29.959> more

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
are tend to err on the side of more

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.740 
are tend to err on the side of more
minimal<00:02:31.310> shoes<00:02:31.609> or<00:02:31.819> lied<00:02:32.000> i<00:02:32.030> remember<00:02:32.359> you<00:02:32.599> run

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
minimal shoes or lied i remember you run

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.780 
minimal shoes or lied i remember you run
into<00:02:32.870> gamma<00:02:33.109> last<00:02:33.439> year<00:02:33.709> and<00:02:33.829> some<00:02:34.010> some<00:02:34.609> roach

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
into gamma last year and some some roach

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.429 
into gamma last year and some some roach
flaps<00:02:35.090> that<00:02:35.239> didn't<00:02:35.450> work<00:02:35.540> out<00:02:35.750> so<00:02:35.810> what<00:02:36.379> are

00:02:36.429 --> 00:02:36.439 
flaps that didn't work out so what are

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:39.490 
flaps that didn't work out so what are

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:42.049 
i'm going to use the innovate x town to

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:44.649 
i'm going to use the innovate x town to
12<00:02:42.319> for<00:02:42.859> this<00:02:43.299> actually<00:02:44.299> it's<00:02:44.420> the<00:02:44.510> newer

00:02:44.649 --> 00:02:44.659 
12 for this actually it's the newer

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:46.360 
12 for this actually it's the newer
model<00:02:45.079> so<00:02:45.379> it's<00:02:45.590> kind<00:02:45.799> of<00:02:45.829> an<00:02:45.950> updated<00:02:46.340> version

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
model so it's kind of an updated version

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.140 
model so it's kind of an updated version
of<00:02:47.329> that<00:02:47.389> shoe<00:02:47.780> and<00:02:48.049> yeah<00:02:48.889> i<00:02:48.919> think<00:02:49.040> given<00:02:50.030> the

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
of that shoe and yeah i think given the

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:51.699 
of that shoe and yeah i think given the
weather<00:02:50.389> predictions<00:02:51.019> where<00:02:51.139> it<00:02:51.230> might<00:02:51.349> storm

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
weather predictions where it might storm

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:53.349 
weather predictions where it might storm
and<00:02:52.099> rain<00:02:52.280> and<00:02:52.669> i<00:02:52.819> think<00:02:53.030> that<00:02:53.120> would<00:02:53.150> be<00:02:53.329> a

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:53.359 
and rain and i think that would be a

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:55.270 
and rain and i think that would be a
pretty<00:02:53.840> good<00:02:54.019> choice<00:02:54.230> it's<00:02:54.530> tonight<00:02:55.040> to<00:02:55.189> have

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
pretty good choice it's tonight to have

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.740 
pretty good choice it's tonight to have
the<00:02:55.310> lugs<00:02:55.609> to<00:02:55.879> on<00:02:56.000> some<00:02:56.209> of<00:02:56.269> the<00:02:56.359> loose<00:02:56.540> stuff

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
the lugs to on some of the loose stuff

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.170 
the lugs to on some of the loose stuff
up<00:02:56.959> high<00:02:57.139> i<00:02:57.470> mean<00:02:58.250> it's<00:02:58.400> it's<00:02:58.819> definitely<00:02:59.150> a

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
up high i mean it's it's definitely a

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.879 
up high i mean it's it's definitely a
trail<00:02:59.419> race<00:02:59.629> there's<00:03:00.049> a<00:03:00.109> lot<00:03:00.139> of<00:03:00.290> there's<00:03:00.829> a

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:00.889 
trail race there's a lot of there's a

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:02.530 
trail race there's a lot of there's a
lot<00:03:01.010> of<00:03:01.069> trail<00:03:01.370> but<00:03:01.790> there's<00:03:01.970> there's<00:03:02.359> some

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
lot of trail but there's there's some

know off trail stuff that I think the

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.390 
know off trail stuff that I think the
lugs<00:03:06.019> will<00:03:06.200> come<00:03:06.349> in<00:03:06.439> handy<00:03:06.470> so<00:03:06.980> pretty<00:03:07.370> good

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
lugs will come in handy so pretty good

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.339 
lugs will come in handy so pretty good
draining<00:03:07.790> shoe<00:03:07.939> to<00:03:08.120> correctly<00:03:09.019> at<00:03:09.139> least<00:03:09.290> the

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.819 
old version was yeah no definitely same
same<00:03:11.419> off<00:03:11.569> /<00:03:11.750> so<00:03:11.959> what<00:03:12.290> does<00:03:12.379> it<00:03:12.470> change<00:03:12.590> that<00:03:12.799> I

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:12.829 
same off / so what does it change that I

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:14.050 
same off / so what does it change that I
know<00:03:13.069> there<00:03:13.250> was<00:03:13.280> an<00:03:13.489> update<00:03:13.609> but<00:03:13.849> I<00:03:13.909> haven't

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
know there was an update but I haven't

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.599 
know there was an update but I haven't
heard<00:03:14.299> with<00:03:14.419> the<00:03:14.510> details<00:03:14.840> yeah<00:03:15.319> I<00:03:15.349> mean

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:15.609 
heard with the details yeah I mean

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:17.800 
heard with the details yeah I mean
cosmetically<00:03:16.609> just<00:03:16.879> the<00:03:17.000> color<00:03:17.239> and<00:03:17.569> then

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
cosmetically just the color and then

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.379 
cosmetically just the color and then
they<00:03:18.470> also<00:03:18.590> changed<00:03:18.949> the<00:03:19.250> EBA<00:03:19.609> so<00:03:20.000> the<00:03:20.090> midsole

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:20.389 
they also changed the EBA so the midsole

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:23.649 
they also changed the EBA so the midsole
is<00:03:20.540> now<00:03:20.690> injected<00:03:21.229> eda<00:03:21.440> instead<00:03:22.129> of<00:03:22.250> blown<00:03:23.060> EPA

00:03:23.649 --> 00:03:23.659 
is now injected eda instead of blown EPA

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:27.159 
is now injected eda instead of blown EPA
which<00:03:24.470> makes<00:03:24.709> it<00:03:24.919> just<00:03:25.129> a<00:03:25.940> little<00:03:26.180> more<00:03:26.329> little

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:27.169 
which makes it just a little more little

00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:29.289 
which makes it just a little more little
firmer<00:03:27.409> and<00:03:28.220> a<00:03:28.370> little<00:03:28.549> bit<00:03:28.669> more<00:03:28.760> plush<00:03:29.060> ride

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:29.299 
firmer and a little bit more plush ride

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:31.000 
firmer and a little bit more plush ride
so<00:03:29.659> I<00:03:29.870> think<00:03:30.049> it'll<00:03:30.260> be<00:03:30.319> really<00:03:30.379> good<00:03:30.590> for<00:03:30.859> this

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
so I think it'll be really good for this

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.409 
so I think it'll be really good for this
gotcha<00:03:31.840> um<00:03:32.840> I<00:03:32.930> mean<00:03:33.790> obviously<00:03:34.790> the<00:03:35.180> goal<00:03:35.299> with

gotcha um I mean obviously the goal with

gotcha um I mean obviously the goal with

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370
