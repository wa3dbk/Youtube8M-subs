00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
the problem is that like if they went a

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.429 
the problem is that like if they went a
narrower<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.689> whole<00:01:18.840> way<00:01:18.990> there<00:01:19.200> would<00:01:19.409> be

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
narrower the whole way there would be

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.940
