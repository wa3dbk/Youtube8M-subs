 jalili 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:06.720
 I found all terrain scenes that do not have the chance to be part 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.030
 of the movie but I'm sure it would interest you look 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.240
 for much more than to let him in to sit down 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.180
 peace security and management in section 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:26.730
 he will leave 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.349
 I'm also working it's obvious 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:32.349
 see everything does not always happen as expected example 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:34.200
 apart from that 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.720
 and it's okay in 10 and a half years right after digesting what I have 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.680
 say + you will see 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.680
 Bernard beat the 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.719
 sitting on either side of the action ump goes 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.980
 even show happened too loud 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.650
 back on the drama 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.350
 it seems 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.140
 remains to know anyway a little more to their liking 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.170
 with a 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.390
 we hold you were supposed to make up for the jinnit delay 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.450
 it's not trivial it's too important 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.650

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:18.880
 martin 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.880

 marocfootball info 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.030
 not so much on their lands 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.170
 more more more 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.869
 I have trouble here the love that diffuses action 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:47.720
 updated remotely even a small detail that only has to wait for the 

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:49.270
 surprise 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.270
 the trend to come in order to make it more in line with expectations 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.170
 the future of supporting growth 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.170
 Why 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.009
 I like the signatory still some parents 

00:02:11.969 --> 00:02:17.609
 woerth this time gignac will be able to reverse the encounter at 6 years old 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:20.379
 at the moment 

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:22.889
 the strength of the yen 

00:02:22.889 --> 00:02:26.979
 mathieu and florent serra today remembers the world 

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:30.499
 with all the same 

00:02:30.499 --> 00:02:31.789
 in Quebec 

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:33.899
