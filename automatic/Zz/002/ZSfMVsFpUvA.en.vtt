teleport<00:00:44.809> commands<00:00:45.050> and<00:00:45.320> have<00:00:45.440> a<00:00:45.469> timeout<00:00:46.120> he

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
teleport commands and have a timeout he

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.119 
teleport commands and have a timeout he
can't<00:00:47.539> escape<00:00:47.989> if<00:00:48.379> you<00:00:48.559> want<00:00:48.710> to<00:00:48.800> just<00:00:48.920> fly<00:00:49.100> out

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:49.129 
can't escape if you want to just fly out

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:52.290 
can't escape if you want to just fly out
now<00:00:49.399> that<00:00:49.640> I've<00:00:49.940> set<00:00:50.539> you<00:00:50.570> free

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:52.300 
now that I've set you free

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.459 
now that I've set you free
alright<00:00:53.300> so<00:00:53.420> I'll<00:00:53.510> demonstrate<00:00:53.719> what<00:00:54.289> the

00:00:54.459 --> 00:00:54.469 
alright so I'll demonstrate what the

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:58.270 
alright so I'll demonstrate what the
trap<00:00:55.249> looks<00:00:55.489> like<00:00:55.640> first<00:00:55.910> person<00:00:57.070> as<00:00:58.070> you<00:00:58.159> can

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
trap looks like first person as you can

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.549 
trap looks like first person as you can
see<00:00:58.429> you're<00:00:58.640> just<00:00:58.850> being<00:00:58.999> shuffled<00:00:59.239> around

00:00:59.549 --> 00:00:59.559 
see you're just being shuffled around

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:05.399 
see you're just being shuffled around
it's<00:01:00.559> not<00:01:00.679> much<00:01:00.800> you<00:01:00.920> can<00:01:01.070> do<00:01:01.809> we<00:01:02.809> smash<00:01:03.100> spawn

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:05.409 
it's not much you can do we smash spawn

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:13.359 
it's not much you can do we smash spawn
it<00:01:06.409> gets<00:01:06.740> canceled<00:01:11.680> so<00:01:12.680> there's<00:01:12.979> really<00:01:13.159> no

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
it gets canceled so there's really no

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:17.920 
it gets canceled so there's really no
way<00:01:13.549> out<00:01:13.670> of<00:01:13.850> this<00:01:13.939> if<00:01:14.360> I<00:01:15.490> TPA<00:01:16.490> to<00:01:16.930> someone

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
way out of this if I TPA to someone

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.209 
way out of this if I TPA to someone
who'll<00:01:18.079> accept<00:01:18.350> or<00:01:18.560> request<00:01:18.890> I<00:01:20.920> did<00:01:21.920> send<00:01:22.100> it

00:01:22.209 --> 00:01:22.219 
who'll accept or request I did send it

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:25.870 
who'll accept or request I did send it
across<00:01:22.280> then<00:01:22.670> talk<00:01:22.790> to<00:01:22.939> you<00:01:24.610> because<00:01:25.610> I<00:01:25.700> sent

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
across then talk to you because I sent

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.580 
across then talk to you because I sent
it<00:01:26.000> to<00:01:26.090> rack<00:01:26.240> Aditi

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:39.730 

maybe<00:01:30.590> I<00:01:30.680> should<00:01:30.920> have<00:01:31.040> sent<00:01:31.219> it<00:01:31.310> to<00:01:31.340> you<00:01:38.740> as

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
maybe I should have sent it to you as

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.560 
maybe I should have sent it to you as
you<00:01:39.950> can<00:01:40.100> see<00:01:40.219> it's<00:01:40.340> instantly<00:01:40.789> cancelled<00:01:41.270> so

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
you can see it's instantly cancelled so

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:53.859 
you can see it's instantly cancelled so
just<00:01:42.469> escape<00:01:42.799> from<00:01:42.829> this<00:01:52.270> all<00:01:53.270> right<00:01:53.390> so<00:01:53.630> as

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 
just escape from this all right so as

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:56.590 
just escape from this all right so as
you<00:01:53.990> can<00:01:54.109> see<00:01:54.170> down<00:01:54.469> here<00:01:54.670> then<00:01:55.670> this<00:01:56.210> is<00:01:56.270> the

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
you can see down here then this is the

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:57.760 
you can see down here then this is the
inner<00:01:56.719> workings<00:01:57.079> of<00:01:57.170> the<00:01:57.259> machine<00:01:57.560> quite

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
inner workings of the machine quite

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.709 
inner workings of the machine quite
simple<00:01:58.070> to<00:01:58.219> build<00:01:58.340> so<00:01:58.909> just<00:01:59.210> pressure<00:01:59.420> plate

00:01:59.709 --> 00:01:59.719 
simple to build so just pressure plate

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:03.520 
simple to build so just pressure plate
up<00:01:59.960> to<00:02:00.229> this<00:02:00.549> piston<00:02:01.869> folder<00:02:02.869> lay<00:02:02.990> there<00:02:03.200> so<00:02:03.409> it

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
up to this piston folder lay there so it

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.289 
up to this piston folder lay there so it
doesn't<00:02:03.799> just<00:02:03.829> squish<00:02:04.189> the<00:02:04.310> person<00:02:04.640> and<00:02:04.820> then

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:05.299 
doesn't just squish the person and then

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:07.959 
doesn't just squish the person and then
this<00:02:05.509> rot<00:02:05.869> line<00:02:06.109> runs<00:02:06.409> along<00:02:06.530> behind<00:02:06.859> that<00:02:07.340> so

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:07.969 
this rot line runs along behind that so

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:09.460 
this rot line runs along behind that so
as<00:02:08.090> long<00:02:08.240> as<00:02:08.300> any<00:02:08.660> of<00:02:08.840> the<00:02:08.960> pressure<00:02:09.170> plates

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
as long as any of the pressure plates

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.500 
as long as any of the pressure plates
are<00:02:09.619> stepped<00:02:09.830> on<00:02:10.039> you<00:02:10.640> get<00:02:10.820> the<00:02:10.970> teeths<00:02:11.240> that

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
are stepped on you get the teeths that

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.900 
are stepped on you get the teeths that
emerged<00:02:11.810> on<00:02:12.140> top<00:02:12.740> that<00:02:13.070> trap<00:02:13.340> the<00:02:13.490> player<00:02:13.700> down

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
emerged on top that trap the player down

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.580 
emerged on top that trap the player down
so<00:02:14.090> they<00:02:14.180> can't<00:02:14.390> fly<00:02:14.630> upwards<00:02:15.020> in<00:02:15.170> case<00:02:15.350> of<00:02:15.530> a

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
so they can't fly upwards in case of a

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.890 
so they can't fly upwards in case of a
creative<00:02:15.950> server<00:02:16.270> so<00:02:17.270> I've<00:02:17.360> got<00:02:17.510> a<00:02:17.540> few

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
creative server so I've got a few

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.660 
creative server so I've got a few
versions<00:02:18.260> of<00:02:18.560> this<00:02:18.740> year<00:02:18.950> this<00:02:19.160> one<00:02:19.340> just

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
versions of this year this one just

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.750 
versions of this year this one just
them<00:02:19.970> side<00:02:20.180> to<00:02:20.209> side<00:02:20.860> this<00:02:21.860> one<00:02:22.099> perches<00:02:22.610> them

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
them side to side this one perches them

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.610 
them side to side this one perches them
around<00:02:22.940> a<00:02:23.120> circle<00:02:23.480> like<00:02:23.569> this<00:02:23.750> one<00:02:23.959> but<00:02:24.470> it

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
around a circle like this one but it

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.559 
around a circle like this one but it
wasn't<00:02:24.950> actually<00:02:25.040> aligned<00:02:25.489> with<00:02:25.730> chunk<00:02:26.150> edges

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
wasn't actually aligned with chunk edges

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:30.550

anyway yeah because of the fact that
after<00:03:38.019> after<00:03:39.019> the<00:03:39.109> players<00:03:39.380> draw<00:03:39.530> on<00:03:39.590> the<00:03:39.709> trap

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
percent when he joined back it'll

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.289 
percent when he joined back it'll
instantly<00:03:43.070> activate<00:03:43.670> and<00:03:43.790> spring<00:03:44.030> on<00:03:44.150> him

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:44.299 
instantly activate and spring on him

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:50.740 
instantly activate and spring on him
again<00:03:45.250> again<00:03:46.250> join<00:03:46.489> back<00:03:47.380> back<00:03:48.380> and<00:03:49.720> for<00:03:50.720> the

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
again again join back back and for the

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.420 
again again join back back and for the
first<00:03:50.959> few<00:03:51.109> seconds<00:03:51.440> he's<00:03:51.560> not<00:03:51.920> really<00:03:52.220> there

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
first few seconds he's not really there

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.069 
first few seconds he's not really there
so<00:03:52.609> that's<00:03:53.090> why<00:03:53.239> it<00:03:53.299> doesn't<00:03:53.570> open<00:03:53.870> up

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:54.079 
so that's why it doesn't open up

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:56.560
