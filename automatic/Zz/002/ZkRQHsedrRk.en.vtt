battery<00:04:52.949> technologies<00:04:53.639> so<00:04:54.180> you<00:04:54.240> don't<00:04:54.419> really

00:04:54.499 --> 00:04:54.509 
battery technologies so you don't really

00:04:54.509 --> 00:04:56.990 
battery technologies so you don't really
see<00:04:54.780> those<00:04:54.930> use<00:04:55.169> much<00:04:55.379> to<00:04:55.560> any<00:04:55.800> longer<00:04:56.280> some<00:04:56.879> of

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
see those use much to any longer some of

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.540 
see those use much to any longer some of
the<00:04:57.120> newer<00:04:57.330> modern<00:04:58.110> types<00:04:58.889> of<00:04:59.129> batteries<00:04:59.310> are

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
the newer modern types of batteries are

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.749 
the newer modern types of batteries are
things<00:04:59.849> like<00:04:59.969> nickel<00:05:00.300> metal<00:05:00.479> hydride<00:05:00.680> ni-mh

00:05:01.749 --> 00:05:01.759 
things like nickel metal hydride ni-mh

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:04.610 
things like nickel metal hydride ni-mh
these<00:05:02.759> can<00:05:03.030> be<00:05:03.180> over<00:05:03.659> discharged<00:05:04.289> so<00:05:04.409> you<00:05:04.469> want

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
these can be over discharged so you want

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.080 
these can be over discharged so you want
to<00:05:04.680> be<00:05:04.710> careful<00:05:04.949> that<00:05:05.129> you<00:05:05.340> don't<00:05:05.490> completely

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
to be careful that you don't completely

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.059 
to be careful that you don't completely
lose<00:05:06.539> a<00:05:06.900> charge<00:05:07.259> on<00:05:07.469> these<00:05:07.620> kinds<00:05:08.009> of

00:05:08.059 --> 00:05:08.069 
lose a charge on these kinds of

00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:09.709 
lose a charge on these kinds of
batteries<00:05:08.490> and<00:05:08.669> they<00:05:09.090> have<00:05:09.240> a<00:05:09.270> relatively

00:05:09.709 --> 00:05:09.719 
batteries and they have a relatively

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:11.480 
batteries and they have a relatively
high<00:05:09.840> self<00:05:10.229> discharge<00:05:10.469> rate<00:05:10.979> which<00:05:11.250> means

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490 
high self discharge rate which means

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.309 
high self discharge rate which means
you'll<00:05:11.669> charge<00:05:12.000> it<00:05:12.150> up<00:05:12.270> set<00:05:12.930> it<00:05:12.960> to<00:05:13.169> the<00:05:13.199> side

00:05:13.309 --> 00:05:13.319 
you'll charge it up set it to the side

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:15.529 
you'll charge it up set it to the side
and<00:05:13.860> as<00:05:14.310> soon<00:05:14.520> as<00:05:14.669> you<00:05:14.789> disconnected<00:05:15.360> from

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:15.539 
and as soon as you disconnected from

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:18.589 
and as soon as you disconnected from
power<00:05:15.599> it<00:05:16.080> slowly<00:05:16.710> begins<00:05:17.310> losing<00:05:17.969> its<00:05:18.180> charge

00:05:18.589 --> 00:05:18.599 
power it slowly begins losing its charge

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:20.659 
power it slowly begins losing its charge
so<00:05:19.139> you<00:05:19.229> can't<00:05:19.560> put<00:05:19.740> this<00:05:19.860> on<00:05:20.069> a<00:05:20.099> shelf<00:05:20.400> and

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:20.669 
so you can't put this on a shelf and

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:22.700 
so you can't put this on a shelf and
leave<00:05:20.909> it<00:05:21.060> there<00:05:21.090> for<00:05:21.330> a<00:05:21.659> month<00:05:21.870> when<00:05:22.409> you<00:05:22.500> come

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.710 
leave it there for a month when you come

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:23.930 
leave it there for a month when you come
back<00:05:22.860> it's<00:05:23.099> not<00:05:23.250> going<00:05:23.370> to<00:05:23.460> have<00:05:23.580> the<00:05:23.699> charge

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:23.940 
back it's not going to have the charge

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.600 
back it's not going to have the charge
it<00:05:24.120> did<00:05:24.300> a<00:05:24.479> month<00:05:24.750> ago<00:05:24.930> we<00:05:25.710> the<00:05:26.159> types<00:05:26.460> of

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:26.610 
it did a month ago we the types of

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:28.399 
it did a month ago we the types of
batteries<00:05:26.699> you<00:05:27.030> see<00:05:27.240> most<00:05:27.449> recently<00:05:28.080> are

00:05:28.399 --> 00:05:28.409 
batteries you see most recently are

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:30.379 
batteries you see most recently are
things<00:05:29.009> like<00:05:29.190> these<00:05:29.400> where<00:05:29.789> they<00:05:30.000> are<00:05:30.210> the

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:30.389 
things like these where they are the

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:32.629 
things like these where they are the
lithium<00:05:30.750> ion<00:05:31.259> batteries<00:05:31.889> you<00:05:32.340> know<00:05:32.430> notice

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:32.639 
lithium ion batteries you know notice

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:34.370 
lithium ion batteries you know notice
these<00:05:32.819> are<00:05:33.029> the<00:05:33.150> lithium<00:05:33.509> ion<00:05:33.779> batteries<00:05:34.199> up

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:34.380 
these are the lithium ion batteries up

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:36.290 
these are the lithium ion batteries up
here<00:05:34.590> this<00:05:34.710> is<00:05:34.860> a<00:05:34.889> picture<00:05:35.130> of<00:05:35.340> lithium<00:05:35.969> ion

here this is a picture of lithium ion

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:37.760 
here this is a picture of lithium ion
that<00:05:36.449> I<00:05:36.509> have<00:05:36.779> here<00:05:37.080> are<00:05:37.199> two<00:05:37.229> different<00:05:37.650> kinds

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:37.770 
that I have here are two different kinds

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:39.769 
that I have here are two different kinds
of<00:05:38.009> batteries<00:05:38.340> the<00:05:38.880> service<00:05:39.300> life<00:05:39.479> of<00:05:39.630> these

00:05:39.769 --> 00:05:39.779 
of batteries the service life of these

00:05:39.779 --> 00:05:42.080 
of batteries the service life of these
is<00:05:39.990> limited<00:05:40.500> as<00:05:40.650> well<00:05:40.949> you<00:05:41.159> can<00:05:41.279> only<00:05:41.430> charge

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:42.090 
is limited as well you can only charge

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:44.149 
is limited as well you can only charge
them<00:05:42.419> up<00:05:42.509> and<00:05:42.719> discharge<00:05:42.900> them<00:05:43.349> only<00:05:43.800> so<00:05:44.009> many

00:05:44.149 --> 00:05:44.159 
them up and discharge them only so many

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:46.459 
them up and discharge them only so many
times<00:05:44.580> the<00:05:45.180> charge<00:05:45.419> capacity<00:05:45.930> does<00:05:46.199> decrease

00:05:46.459 --> 00:05:46.469 
times the charge capacity does decrease

00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:49.700 
times the charge capacity does decrease
over<00:05:47.340> time<00:05:47.370> so<00:05:47.940> as<00:05:48.330> soon<00:05:48.750> as<00:05:48.900> they<00:05:49.050> are<00:05:49.259> made

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:49.710 
over time so as soon as they are made

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:52.399 
over time so as soon as they are made
and<00:05:49.979> manufactured<00:05:50.520> they've<00:05:51.300> got<00:05:51.539> an<00:05:51.779> amount

00:05:52.399 --> 00:05:52.409 
and manufactured they've got an amount

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:54.260 
and manufactured they've got an amount
of<00:05:52.680> time<00:05:52.919> that<00:05:52.949> they'll<00:05:53.279> be<00:05:53.340> able<00:05:53.490> to<00:05:53.729> use<00:05:54.029> they

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:54.270 
of time that they'll be able to use they

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:56.360 
of time that they'll be able to use they
start<00:05:54.539> aging<00:05:54.750> almost<00:05:55.469> immediately<00:05:56.099> whether

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:56.370 
start aging almost immediately whether

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:58.730 
start aging almost immediately whether
you<00:05:56.729> are<00:05:56.909> using<00:05:56.940> them<00:05:57.509> or<00:05:57.719> not<00:05:58.020> they<00:05:58.560> also

don't<00:05:58.979> handle<00:05:59.340> deep<00:05:59.550> discharge<00:05:59.789> as<00:06:00.210> well<00:06:00.419> if

00:06:00.589 --> 00:06:00.599 
don't handle deep discharge as well if

00:06:00.599 --> 00:06:02.629 
don't handle deep discharge as well if
you<00:06:00.690> discharge<00:06:00.900> these<00:06:01.349> all<00:06:01.590> the<00:06:01.710> way<00:06:01.830> out<00:06:01.860> it's

00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:02.639 
you discharge these all the way out it's

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:04.490 
you discharge these all the way out it's
very<00:06:02.909> difficult<00:06:03.180> for<00:06:03.539> those<00:06:03.750> to<00:06:03.960> get<00:06:04.080> back<00:06:04.289> to

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:04.500 
very difficult for those to get back to

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.619 
very difficult for those to get back to
a<00:06:04.529> full<00:06:04.860> charge<00:06:05.159> again<00:06:05.550> so<00:06:06.029> you<00:06:06.090> try<00:06:06.360> to<00:06:06.419> keep

00:06:06.619 --> 00:06:06.629 
a full charge again so you try to keep

00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:09.290 
a full charge again so you try to keep
these<00:06:06.870> charged<00:06:07.620> as<00:06:07.860> much<00:06:08.129> as<00:06:08.310> possible<00:06:08.520> don't

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:09.300

these over time these different types of

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.149 
these over time these different types of
batteries<00:06:18.539> just<00:06:18.960> look<00:06:19.379> at<00:06:19.500> the<00:06:19.590> battery<00:06:19.919> type

00:06:20.149 --> 00:06:20.159 
batteries just look at the battery type

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:21.709 
batteries just look at the battery type
it<00:06:20.370> will<00:06:20.520> tell<00:06:20.759> you<00:06:20.940> right<00:06:20.969> on<00:06:21.270> the<00:06:21.389> battery

00:06:21.709 --> 00:06:21.719 
it will tell you right on the battery

00:06:21.719 --> 00:06:24.200 
it will tell you right on the battery
what<00:06:22.229> type<00:06:22.469> of<00:06:22.500> battery<00:06:22.830> technology<00:06:23.639> it<00:06:23.759> uses

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:24.210 
what type of battery technology it uses

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:26.119 
what type of battery technology it uses
and<00:06:24.449> it'll<00:06:24.599> give<00:06:24.750> you<00:06:24.900> some<00:06:25.379> updates<00:06:25.590> check

00:06:26.119 --> 00:06:26.129 
and it'll give you some updates check
