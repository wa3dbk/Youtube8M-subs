00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.359
 hello very good everyone I'm maximan and 

00:00:02.199 --> 00:00:06.279
 we are here in a new video of gta 5 

00:00:04.359 --> 00:00:08.349
 online we are in a trick of ammunition 

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:11.050
 infinite you could also say 

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:12.700
 of free weapons and good you are seeing 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:14.440
 that most of all the weapons that 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.420
 you are seeing, they are at zero, not no 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.100
 I have ammunition and lahm and none is the 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.630
 only that I have left here that is the 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.700
 that I have left to spend so the 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.830
 explains being here I'm shooting a 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:26.140
 little bit and good free ammunition like 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:28.330
 we can get ammo completely 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.970
 free without having to spend a dollar on 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:32.200
 the game and having to spend nothing good 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.180
 so we're going here an activity that 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.340
 I have created in the online games to 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.800
 death if we go up going up here 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.540
 we have one called free ammunition 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.560
 then it's good to leave the 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.870
 description so you can download it 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:46.150
 and you just have to invite a 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.680
 partner to help us only what 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.360
 The only thing you have to do is to be 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.430
 foot does not have to do anything while 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.690
 is going to eat that is going to go to some 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.610
 side what it is because he threw a cable 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.230
 while it comes back then you're 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.270
 getting ammo here you are watching 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.670
 that what it would cost a thousand 121 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.920
 he will cost me totally free 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.870
 with getting the weapons and all the 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.950
 ammunition of all weapons not then 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:09.979
 well we enter the activity 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.619
 and you will see a green barrier so that 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:14.390
 the partner because I just in case he gives 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:15.979
 for wanting to kill I've put a 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.750
 barrier I do not know about cars too 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:20.420
 so good here you are seeing that 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:23.960
 everything is full of weapons and all 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.880
 the weapons and we started to catch the one 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.789
 for one here you are watching how it goes 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:31.399
 climbing ammo little by little goes 

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:33.110
 going up on ammunition and well I've also 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:35.509
 put some houses and if your friend is 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.950
 bored or come back and still want to catch 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:39.770
 weapons because you go around the 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.200
 coffee then then come and 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.569
 You want to leave I see you I must also say 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.459
 that you put it in without traffic because 

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:48.770
 happens what happens that there is a car through 

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:52.939
 and they do not let you catch the guns well and 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:57.319
 well I put the weapons in let's say that 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:59.720
 to me to my liking I have put most of 

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:01.220
 weapons are the ones that spend the most that is 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.229
 the carbine I'm having now 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.810
 same in hand then I also have the 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:07.280
 guns and good basically the one that more 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.030
 ammunition is this you are seeing 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.349
 right now 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.810
 then we left the activity and if 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:13.040
 we realize we have totally the 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.110
 ornate weapons 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.420
 the times that we have taken the arms 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:21.799
 we do not have the money with pomegranates 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:23.989
 pistols rifles shotguns the 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:25.099
 machine guns all all all all 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:27.439
 that we have taken then we have it 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:28.730
 totally recharged even weapons that 

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:30.680
 I did not have them right now 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.349
 as if I had bought them 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.849
 valuable me for example is this franc 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:37.220
 Well I do not have it bought only 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:38.959
 I have the heavy combat and now 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.609
 Well I have it as if it was bought 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:42.889
 so then you can buy and have 

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:44.810
 free ammunition so nothing more guys 

00:02:42.889 --> 00:02:47.000
