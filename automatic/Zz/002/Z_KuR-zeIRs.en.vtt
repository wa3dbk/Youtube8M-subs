00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.109
 a boxing of the photography backpack 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:09.840
 then the pro fastback in a backpack 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.800
 small for a camera body a 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.990
 objective 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:16.150
 then the pro always work very good 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:19.270
 materials has two parts 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:23.350
 differentiated one in the lower part for 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:27.220
 save the photographic equipment with a 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:29.520
 lens that you can add a flash is the 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.829
 upper pocket that is on the outside 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:36.310
 ideal to address documentation or a 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:39.579
 map things thin things I here I have 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:42.130
 saved the manuals of the camera is 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:45.460
 large therefore they could be saved 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:49.030
 filters for example on this side we see 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:50.960
 that the backpack has an ideal grid 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:54.260
 to save 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:58.010
 for example a bottle is missing 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:01.489
 a handle on top that 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.320
 would allow us to attach a tripod in 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:06.470
 the other side of the backpack in the part 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:09.590
 lower we see the opening by the 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:14.200
 which one can draw the equipment with the 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:17.090
 backpack semi put on the bottom 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.250
 has two creams 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.990
 through which the team goes to 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.140
 protected 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:26.540
 and we remove each one of them we remove the 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.180
 skirt that protects this part of the 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:32.509
 backpack and we found a 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.220
 pocket in which I have wanted to put 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:37.130
 for example the portfolio with the 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:40.240
 documentation or we can get more 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:43.630
 filters or accessories that do not occupy 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.630
 too much volume 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.700
 but no 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:02:00.009
 in the pocket below is where it goes 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:04.210
 all the camera equipment the camera 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:06.909
 photos or if we carry a goal let's say 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:10.050
 the flash just lifting the lid we 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:12.849
 We found with two small pockets 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:15.400
 for memory cards have the 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:18.970
 size of clear bubbles therefore the 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.590
 SSD cards fit perfectly if 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.160
 we lift the lid completely we 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:27.640
 we found with the photographic equipment and 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:32.470
 specifically I have a canon 6 full 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:36.730
 frame with a target 24 105 canon 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:39.870
 range with the sun visor incorporated and the 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:43.420
 right what is there is a flash or without 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:45.890
 866 which is large as you see the 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:49.760
 flash has to go bent 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:52.459
 and if they are totally vertical on 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:55.880
 he would go out for the backpack the 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:59.740
 camera finishes perfectly the canon 6 t 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:03.530
 is slightly smaller than 7 d 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:07.180
 therefore I intuit that these six of 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:10.490
 the seven of would fit with a hilt 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:13.000
 surely yes that for even cameras 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:15.880
 larger than 15 from mart 2 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.300
 surely also fit 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:21.160
 the equipment pretty well protected 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.590
 and at the top we have a 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.290
 pocket practically of equal size 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:29.439
 that the inner pocket 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:31.989
 in which good then has some 

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:35.140
 pockets as for pens for 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:37.540
 non- touch screen mobile phones 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:40.150
 like the current ones but more thought the 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:42.730
 old equipment than a grid 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.680
 only documentation or whatever and 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.750
 I specifically here I have put some 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.450
 example things this is the charger for 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:53.260
 the batteries of the flash that occupies the size 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:56.409
 of four normal batteries this is the 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:58.120
 typical outside to clean up the objectives 

00:03:56.409 --> 00:04:01.989
 of lint 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:05.890
 this is a go pro hero action camera 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:09.340
 3 and inside I also carry an ipad 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:12.730
 mini with your sleeve as you see follows 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:15.610
 leaving enough space for enough 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:19.150
 more objects even in this part is 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:22.330
 could take a goal of equal 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:25.810
 size at 24 105 even a tad 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:28.840
 superior to kicker introduce the backpack 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:31.330
 inside a cabin suitcase of the 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.590
 that are authorized for flights of 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.940
 Ryanair 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:39.460
 the backpack can be folded almost 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:42.820
 completely therefore it is one of the 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:46.890
 backpacks suitable to take us those of 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.890
 trip inside a suitcase
