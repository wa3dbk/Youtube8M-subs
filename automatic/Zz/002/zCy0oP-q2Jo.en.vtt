00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.330 
think that the monsters that I'm using
really<00:02:04.300> have<00:02:04.600> a<00:02:04.630> very<00:02:04.960> effective<00:02:05.259> feral<00:02:06.159> link

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
really have a very effective feral link

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.520 
really have a very effective feral link
at<00:02:06.490> all<00:02:06.610> I<00:02:06.909> think<00:02:07.509> this<00:02:07.810> one<00:02:08.019> is<00:02:08.049> probably<00:02:08.259> the

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
at all I think this one is probably the

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.199 
at all I think this one is probably the
best<00:02:08.739> one<00:02:08.920> it's<00:02:09.190> really<00:02:09.340> only<00:02:09.759> good<00:02:10.060> at

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
best one it's really only good at

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.630 
best one it's really only good at
getting<00:02:10.509> the<00:02:10.660> stagger<00:02:11.140> meter<00:02:11.489> saturd<00:02:12.489> meter

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
getting the stagger meter saturd meter

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.090 
getting the stagger meter saturd meter
up

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
up

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.620 
up
alright<00:02:15.100> saying<00:02:15.580> she<00:02:15.820> did<00:02:16.060> his<00:02:16.180> little<00:02:16.330> swipe

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
alright saying she did his little swipe

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.570 
alright saying she did his little swipe

there I switch to my tortoise - tortoise

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
there I switch to my tortoise - tortoise

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
guys from a bunch of physical damage

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.870 
guys from a bunch of physical damage
I<00:02:34.770> think<00:02:35.770> it's<00:02:35.860> physical<00:02:36.250> damage<00:02:36.490> I<00:02:36.610> mean<00:02:36.760> it's

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
I think it's physical damage I mean it's

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.270 
I think it's physical damage I mean it's
a<00:02:37.060> it's<00:02:37.360> a<00:02:37.840> commando<00:02:38.320> attack<00:02:38.650> so<00:02:39.010> I<00:02:39.040> would

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
a it's a commando attack so I would

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.960 
a it's a commando attack so I would
assume<00:02:40.770> all<00:02:41.770> right<00:02:41.950> a<00:02:41.980> little<00:02:42.220> bit<00:02:42.310> low<00:02:42.460> gonna

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
assume all right a little bit low gonna

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.080 
assume all right a little bit low gonna
go<00:02:43.150> into<00:02:43.450> a<00:02:43.480> combat<00:02:44.080> clinic<00:02:44.380> again<00:02:45.060> what<00:02:46.060> I

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
go into a combat clinic again what I

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
all I have to do is hit up when I'm at

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.220 
all I have to do is hit up when I'm at
the<00:03:11.230> top<00:03:11.440> and<00:03:11.740> I<00:03:11.920> get<00:03:12.070> right<00:03:12.190> there<00:03:13.170> now<00:03:14.170> the

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
the top and I get right there now the

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.110 
the top and I get right there now the
shield<00:03:14.620> it<00:03:15.070> looks<00:03:15.340> like<00:03:15.490> it's<00:03:15.610> doing<00:03:15.760> a<00:03:15.970> lot

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
shield it looks like it's doing a lot

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.140 
shield it looks like it's doing a lot
but<00:03:16.450> once<00:03:17.170> you<00:03:17.440> stagger<00:03:18.070> him<00:03:18.400> the<00:03:18.730> shield<00:03:18.970> will

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
but once you stagger him the shield will

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.850 
but once you stagger him the shield will
just<00:03:19.330> disappear<00:03:19.750> so<00:03:20.320> you<00:03:20.410> don't<00:03:20.560> really<00:03:20.740> have

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
just disappear so you don't really have

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.000 
just disappear so you don't really have
to<00:03:20.980> worry<00:03:21.160> about<00:03:21.250> it<00:03:21.490> that<00:03:21.520> much

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:31.839 

that<00:03:25.549> was<00:03:25.819> music

00:03:31.839 --> 00:03:31.849 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:33.940 

one<00:03:32.569> of<00:03:32.689> the<00:03:32.810> fortunate<00:03:33.140> things<00:03:33.530> about<00:03:33.769> this

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
one of the fortunate things about this

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:35.709 
one of the fortunate things about this
boss<00:03:34.189> is<00:03:34.400> that<00:03:34.549> he<00:03:34.700> likes<00:03:34.849> to<00:03:35.150> cast<00:03:35.450> a<00:03:35.569> whole

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:35.719 
boss is that he likes to cast a whole

00:03:35.719 --> 00:03:37.330 
boss is that he likes to cast a whole
bunch<00:03:35.900> of<00:03:35.989> deep<00:03:36.200> buffs<00:03:36.439> on<00:03:36.650> you<00:03:36.829> and

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
bunch of deep buffs on you and

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.640 
bunch of deep buffs on you and
unfortunately<00:03:37.780> my<00:03:38.780> healer

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
unfortunately my healer

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.429 
unfortunately my healer
none<00:03:40.099> neither<00:03:40.400> my<00:03:40.670> healers<00:03:41.030> have<00:03:41.719> learned<00:03:41.989> a

00:03:42.429 --> 00:03:42.439 
none neither my healers have learned a

sunnah yet so I kind of just have to

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:46.270 
sunnah yet so I kind of just have to
deal<00:03:45.829> with<00:03:45.980> it

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
deal with it

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.949 
deal with it
just<00:03:46.549> keep<00:03:46.700> a<00:03:46.819> note<00:03:47.030> that<00:03:47.269> you<00:03:47.599> know<00:03:47.689> if<00:03:47.810> you

the shield you're gonna take a lot more
damage<00:03:52.159> than<00:03:52.370> you<00:03:52.670> normally<00:03:52.819> would<00:03:53.090> so<00:03:53.569> make
