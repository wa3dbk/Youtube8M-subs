00:00:14.189 --> 00:00:15.769
 Hello to all 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:19.060
 as you see we have a spiderman and 

00:00:19.059 --> 00:00:20.259
 potavin 

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:21.739
 iss 

00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:23.630
 some figures 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.630
 with so luxury 

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:30.589
 let's start with the corners 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.070
 super detailed 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.860
 human shelf 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.520
 Us Georgia famous 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.890
 like a symbol 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.410
 spiderman 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.410
 very neat match all painted 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.600
 in this figure as much as possible 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.020
 possible mobility 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.910
 as far as i noticed 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:03.700
 each part 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.900
 moves 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.910
 up to knees 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:12.250
 is there here and here 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.710
 I still love to show as a person 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.520
 because 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.080
 he is not interested in me 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.240
 just collecting 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.730
 whale super on zone 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:25.270
 imagine it 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.590
 but not really necessary 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.590
 wolves have nothing to confuse me 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.230
 individual mobility 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:35.400
 fingers on hand because it is only 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.470
 dream 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.289
 here she is 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:41.060
 to the creator of eyelid figures 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.540
 suggested on the forums and read 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:45.530
 he is called 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.580
 american collectors 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:48.630
 which the 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.460
 who immobility mobility need 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.150
 except mobility 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.490
 but got higher that is 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.840
 here is a process that many so much 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.890
 little what 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.230
 usa will also show 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:05.240
 here they are so thin that not even for 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.730
 back to normal 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:08.509
 codes 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.699
 to put 

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:13.729
 as it turned out 

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:16.739
 turn on Kiev and it turns out 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.279
 now i will put 

00:02:19.279 --> 00:02:21.229
 here is the position 

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:23.889
 he usually shoot cobwebs 

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:25.329
 on hand and difficult 

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:27.489
 so guys aiming for a tripod then me 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:28.989
 it will be easier to do these 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:30.799
 reviews 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:33.119
 explain with the transition 

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:36.119
 later very tonic finger 

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:39.629
 and the whole region I like colors 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:40.449
 black 

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:42.439
 dark red 

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:45.439
 that's the way I did not show 

00:02:46.649 --> 00:02:48.579
 but 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:51.439
 everyone remembers well individually 

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:54.439
 finger mobility 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:59.120
 with our spider man goes to 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.209
 set of accessories 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:02.580
 traffic light 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.219
 for children to learn 

00:03:04.219 --> 00:03:07.219
 fk news cross the road 

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:09.770
 inscription 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.549
 in childhood 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:15.549
 as you see very small hours 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:18.269
 could put it as if in question 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:21.809
 to which place a boot to blind and if 

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:24.809
 do something more solid but 

00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:29.469
 but we are glad and this 

00:03:30.029 --> 00:03:32.269
 and here is the villain 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:34.999
 we know 

00:03:34.999 --> 00:03:36.739
 I'll try acting 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:39.460
 coloring iridescent 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:41.219
 Blue colour 

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:44.399
 all over the body it's very cool 

00:03:44.399 --> 00:03:47.869
 I like but more than the version 

00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:50.389
 m plain black 

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:52.609
 also the fact that the return in the village of g 

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:54.119
 they just do 

00:03:54.119 --> 00:03:57.159
 also gives in some sort 

00:03:57.159 --> 00:04:00.179
 interesting view 

00:04:00.179 --> 00:04:02.650
 and also have an individual 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.519
 mobility of every finger and here 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:06.209
 have a rest 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:08.499
 Shumkov of course 

00:04:08.499 --> 00:04:10.859
 0 he has a small 

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:13.149
 as if 

00:04:13.149 --> 00:04:16.390
 can order package of spider man factory 

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:18.840
 909 let's take a look 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.949
 Kolomoisky 

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:23.529
 dominant azarenko 

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:25.949
 here we are shihans 

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:28.389
 on the other hand 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:31.389
 according to the information does not specify 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:34.990
 little thing 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.440
 This thing is responsible for the site shelf 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:38.289
 Germans 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:40.199
 figurines 

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:43.259
 which is called 

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:45.539
 java hear 

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:47.610
 cooler rogozhin 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.189
 it will be shared 

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:52.960
 as the inscription on the package 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.960
 show jaws are moving 

00:04:57.059 --> 00:04:58.169
 now we will see 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:01.169
 how much circle did it 

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:04.569
 and then we talked about something like that 

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:07.749
 format on the button on his back 

00:05:07.749 --> 00:05:10.749
 last but not least 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.360
 force 

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:20.119
 I press even with such force that he 

00:05:20.119 --> 00:05:21.419
 makes them was six 

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:24.419
 what to say 

00:05:25.059 --> 00:05:28.059
 there is no honor 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:32.819
 to man 

00:05:32.819 --> 00:05:35.539
 button 

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:38.629
 here it is fragile i press 

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:41.629
 and everything that makes him so great 

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:44.240
 a hundred years ago 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.120
 the baby is crying 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.879
 what kind of people 

00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:51.249
 why do you need it 

00:05:51.249 --> 00:05:54.019
 estimated that it is one of the best 

00:05:54.019 --> 00:05:56.639
 his works and coloring 

00:05:56.639 --> 00:05:58.270
 brilliant pigs 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:00.430
 on Wednesday he himself and so on 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:02.500
 hard for him first strong all that to me 

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:05.680
 like May 5 

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:06.710
 m 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:09.940
 but again with a small movement function 

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:11.889
 stirring 

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:13.969
 since it was added to 

00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:16.969
 add played together in Pyatigorsk 

00:06:18.619 --> 00:06:20.689
 basically 

00:06:20.689 --> 00:06:23.580
 just odd thing we get the impression 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:26.580
 and do not need a pound 

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:28.729
 we fell behind 

00:06:28.729 --> 00:06:31.289
 collector bosses shelves 

00:06:31.289 --> 00:06:32.270
 stick figure 

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:33.379
 so here 

00:06:33.379 --> 00:06:36.379
 relevant statement to the police 

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.699
 in packages of this 

00:06:40.699 --> 00:06:43.229
 judgment or weaker songs 

00:06:43.229 --> 00:06:46.599
 including str 

00:06:46.599 --> 00:06:47.759
 or this opinion 

00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:50.149
 and here is a concert 

00:06:50.149 --> 00:06:52.779
 opening fock 

00:06:52.779 --> 00:06:55.779
 This is a Elena spider man 

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:58.819
 I have two options this is a skater 

00:06:58.819 --> 00:07:01.199
 using a hard copy it is there in deed 

00:07:01.199 --> 00:07:04.280
 just red and one pill main 

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:05.080
 task 

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:07.009
 In principle, only these dynamics are noted. 

00:07:07.009 --> 00:07:09.339
 what is Yanukovych 

00:07:09.339 --> 00:07:11.559
 see the opinion 

00:07:11.559 --> 00:07:15.800
 but if possible I want to trace the collection 

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:17.509
 some 

00:07:17.509 --> 00:07:20.879
 tuple 

00:07:20.879 --> 00:07:23.300
 what is there to do ukrainians 

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:24.860
 so sure he won't 

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:26.889
 surely made really 

00:07:26.889 --> 00:07:28.520
 here they are 

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:31.520
 spider packing 

00:07:37.819 --> 00:07:39.159
 here on the street 

00:07:39.159 --> 00:07:42.369
 per month at the traffic lights 

00:07:42.369 --> 00:07:45.490
 and urged the poor given it turns out 

00:07:47.229 --> 00:07:50.610
 the best figure doesn't like it 

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:53.650
 there is also their fact that Samara has disadvantages but 

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:57.840
 why do we need an ideal figure like 

00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:59.940
 larch and generally without flaws 

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:02.940
 not interested 

00:08:03.539 --> 00:08:05.909
 everything 

00:08:05.909 --> 00:08:06.899
 South Africa
