this you can even close the door and
just<00:03:58.889> keep<00:03:59.310> running<00:03:59.489> around<00:03:59.849> probably<00:04:00.750> the

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:01.109 
just keep running around probably the

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:03.470 
just keep running around probably the
most<00:04:01.739> used<00:04:02.250> one<00:04:02.489> though<00:04:02.639> is<00:04:02.849> going<00:04:03.180> up<00:04:03.329> the

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
most used one though is going up the

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.110 
most used one though is going up the
stairs<00:04:03.750> this<00:04:04.349> usually<00:04:05.310> doesn't<00:04:05.519> work<00:04:05.910> though

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
stairs this usually doesn't work though

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.270 
stairs this usually doesn't work though
if<00:04:06.269> there's<00:04:06.389> more<00:04:06.690> than<00:04:07.129> three<00:04:08.129> people

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
if there's more than three people

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.949 
if there's more than three people
because<00:04:08.549> i'll<00:04:08.699> just<00:04:08.879> wait<00:04:09.030> at<00:04:09.299> the<00:04:09.329> staircase

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
because i'll just wait at the staircase

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:11.240 
because i'll just wait at the staircase
is<00:04:10.139> for<00:04:10.349> you<00:04:10.410> while<00:04:10.560> you're<00:04:10.709> going<00:04:10.859> up<00:04:11.069> and

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
is for you while you're going up and

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:12.710 
is for you while you're going up and
down<00:04:11.310> the<00:04:11.519> staircase<00:04:11.730> is<00:04:12.090> an<00:04:12.239> attacking<00:04:12.510> you

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
down the staircase is an attacking you

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.589 
down the staircase is an attacking you
so<00:04:12.900> you're<00:04:13.049> staying<00:04:13.919> in<00:04:14.129> combat<00:04:14.579> you<00:04:15.419> can

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:15.599 
so you're staying in combat you can

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:16.909 
so you're staying in combat you can
probably<00:04:16.049> run<00:04:16.139> over<00:04:16.380> there<00:04:16.530> though<00:04:16.739> if

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
probably run over there though if

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:18.409 
probably run over there though if
someone's<00:04:17.280> not<00:04:17.340> on<00:04:17.579> that<00:04:17.669> level<00:04:17.849> and<00:04:18.090> try<00:04:18.359> to

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
someone's not on that level and try to

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:22.130 
someone's not on that level and try to
get<00:04:18.570> away<00:04:18.660> but<00:04:18.840> it's<00:04:19.590> very<00:04:19.889> unlikely<00:04:20.900> but<00:04:21.900> it's

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
get away but it's very unlikely but it's

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:23.480 
get away but it's very unlikely but it's
really<00:04:22.320> good<00:04:22.469> if<00:04:22.620> there's<00:04:23.010> only<00:04:23.159> one<00:04:23.340> person

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
really good if there's only one person

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.760 
really good if there's only one person
because<00:04:23.940> they<00:04:24.300> can't<00:04:24.539> really<00:04:25.200> protect<00:04:25.560> what

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
because they can't really protect what

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.050 
because they can't really protect what
you're<00:04:25.919> gonna<00:04:26.010> do

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
you're gonna do

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:28.640 
you're gonna do
it's<00:04:27.180> easier<00:04:27.450> to<00:04:27.510> predict<00:04:27.780> them<00:04:27.990> since<00:04:28.320> you

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
it's easier to predict them since you

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.980 
it's easier to predict them since you
know<00:04:28.770> they're<00:04:29.360> waiting<00:04:30.360> for<00:04:30.570> you<00:04:30.630> at<00:04:30.780> some

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:12.230 
barracks helmet which is worth 1 mil at
the<00:05:08.760> moment<00:05:09.090> and<00:05:09.270> that'd<00:05:10.020> be<00:05:10.139> really<00:05:10.290> bad<00:05:11.240> so

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 
the moment and that'd be really bad so

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.730 
the moment and that'd be really bad so
that<00:05:12.360> 10k<00:05:12.720> is<00:05:12.780> definitely<00:05:13.139> worth<00:05:13.290> the<00:05:13.500> risk

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
that 10k is definitely worth the risk

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.830 
that 10k is definitely worth the risk
and<00:05:14.070> you<00:05:14.580> can<00:05:14.729> just<00:05:14.850> pray<00:05:15.180> and<00:05:15.210> then<00:05:15.570> if<00:05:15.720> you

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 
and you can just pray and then if you

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.190 
and you can just pray and then if you
run<00:05:16.020> north<00:05:16.350> as<00:05:16.820> you'll<00:05:17.820> see<00:05:18.000> here<00:05:18.360> there<00:05:18.990> is<00:05:19.169> a

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:19.200 
run north as you'll see here there is a

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.590 
run north as you'll see here there is a
bank<00:05:19.560> so<00:05:19.919> you<00:05:20.010> can<00:05:20.220> just<00:05:20.250> quickly<00:05:20.639> bank<00:05:21.120> and<00:05:21.479> go

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:21.600 
bank so you can just quickly bank and go

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.190 
bank so you can just quickly bank and go
back<00:05:21.919> you<00:05:22.919> can<00:05:23.100> use<00:05:23.250> super<00:05:23.550> energies<00:05:24.139> but<00:05:25.139> I

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:25.200 
back you can use super energies but I

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.450 
back you can use super energies but I
don't<00:05:25.590> really<00:05:25.710> bring<00:05:25.889> them<00:05:26.070> because<00:05:26.280> there

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 
don't really bring them because there

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.870 
don't really bring them because there
are<00:05:26.669> just<00:05:26.940> extra<00:05:27.330> risk<00:05:27.630> and<00:05:28.050> you<00:05:28.550> barely<00:05:29.550> break

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:29.880 
are just extra risk and you barely break

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.090 
are just extra risk and you barely break
even<00:05:29.910> on<00:05:30.450> the<00:05:30.600> drops<00:05:30.900> that<00:05:31.380> you<00:05:31.530> do<00:05:31.770> manage<00:05:31.979> to

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:32.100 
even on the drops that you do manage to

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:35.690 
even on the drops that you do manage to
get<00:05:32.430> unless<00:05:33.150> sir<00:05:33.360> a<00:05:33.870> dragon<00:05:34.320> pick<00:05:34.440> axe<00:05:34.650> or<00:05:35.039> a

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:35.700 
get unless sir a dragon pick axe or a

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:38.870 
get unless sir a dragon pick axe or a
dragon<00:05:36.060> to<00:05:36.300> endure<00:05:36.830> so<00:05:37.830> I<00:05:38.250> won't<00:05:38.520> suggest

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:38.880 
dragon to endure so I won't suggest

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.860 
dragon to endure so I won't suggest
extra<00:05:39.539> risk<00:05:39.780> as<00:05:40.110> there's<00:05:40.860> not<00:05:41.130> really<00:05:41.460> a<00:05:41.870> big

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:42.870 
extra risk as there's not really a big

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:44.570 
extra risk as there's not really a big
use<00:05:43.169> for<00:05:43.530> it<00:05:43.620> because<00:05:43.860> just<00:05:44.190> getting<00:05:44.430> their

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580 
use for it because just getting their

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:48.140 
use for it because just getting their
back<00:05:44.880> isn't<00:05:45.419> that<00:05:45.450> big<00:05:45.600> of<00:05:45.660> a<00:05:45.780> dick<00:05:45.990> issue<00:05:47.150> now

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:48.150 
back isn't that big of a dick issue now

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:49.790 
back isn't that big of a dick issue now
you<00:05:48.210> can<00:05:48.419> also<00:05:48.570> make<00:05:48.960> it<00:05:48.990> so<00:05:49.289> it's<00:05:49.500> a<00:05:49.620> lot

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 
you can also make it so it's a lot

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.300 
you can also make it so it's a lot
easier<00:05:49.830> to<00:05:50.310> bank<00:05:51.380> and<00:05:52.380> get<00:05:52.590> back<00:05:52.830> you

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:53.310 
easier to bank and get back you

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:54.320 
easier to bank and get back you
definitely<00:05:53.520> want<00:05:53.789> to<00:05:53.820> use<00:05:53.880> a<00:05:53.970> shortcut

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:54.330
