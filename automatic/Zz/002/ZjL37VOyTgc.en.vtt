 we are interested and we download it 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.579
 for example here I could use 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.820
 Skype for Windows and now it is 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:10.190

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:19.000
 on my desk saved easy we give 

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:20.790
 double click we wait for the 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.200
 installer 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.719
 and well here we are going to click on next 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.270

 our contract we accept them and we are 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:34.409
 in agreement 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:38.159
 we leave all these tabs active 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.359
 well here where it says files is where it is 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.490
 located 

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:44.549
 our sketch where it is installed 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.960
 our directory if it does not appear here 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.399
 for example here I think it's that 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.179
 made 2013 that is the version that 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:53.179

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:58.020
 find it in your folders 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.319
 Normally when we have a version 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.270
 already installed because it appears directly and 

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:05.280
 we click on next as you see it is very 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.890

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.110

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.500
 speed of what this ends 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.060
 It will depend on the power of your machine and 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.450
 of the programs that you are running 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.540
 the pair is something very fast and simple 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.540

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:42.260
 installation is going to indicate that we 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.550
 you will see a window where we are 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.210
 corroborating that it has been done 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:50.060
 correctly and we click on finalize 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:51.710
 Now we can verify in our 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:56.060
 chaos options group 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:58.040
