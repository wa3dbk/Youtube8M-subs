the<00:00:32.940> UK's<00:00:33.329> first<00:00:33.360> ever<00:00:33.960> man-made<00:00:34.500> salt<00:00:34.800> cave

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
the UK's first ever man-made salt cave

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.200 
the UK's first ever man-made salt cave
has<00:00:35.130> been<00:00:35.280> built<00:00:35.520> I'm<00:00:35.850> gonna<00:00:36.059> go<00:00:36.149> check<00:00:36.360> it<00:00:36.510> out

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
has been built I'm gonna go check it out

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.540 
has been built I'm gonna go check it out
so<00:00:39.210> here<00:00:39.540> we<00:00:39.629> are<00:00:39.750> my<00:00:40.320> first<00:00:40.530> impressions<00:00:40.680> and

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
so here we are my first impressions and

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:42.979 
so here we are my first impressions and
then<00:00:41.640> it<00:00:41.730> looks<00:00:41.879> a<00:00:41.969> bit<00:00:42.180> like<00:00:42.239> an<00:00:42.570> igloo<00:00:42.780> and

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
then it looks a bit like an igloo and

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.690 
then it looks a bit like an igloo and
that's<00:00:43.200> because<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.530> walls<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.430> floors

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
that's because the walls and the floors

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.619 
that's because the walls and the floors
are<00:00:44.969> covered<00:00:45.480> in<00:00:46.140> salt<00:00:46.910> it's<00:00:47.910> been<00:00:48.090> open<00:00:48.360> a<00:00:48.420> few

are covered in salt it's been open a few

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.420 
are covered in salt it's been open a few
months<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:49.079> already<00:00:49.230> over<00:00:49.800> a<00:00:49.829> hundred<00:00:50.219> people

helps you out so how does it work well

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.429 
helps you out so how does it work well
there's<00:01:06.180> a<00:01:06.240> special<00:01:06.510> climate<00:01:07.020> in<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.229> cave

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
there's a special climate in the cave

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.260 
there's a special climate in the cave
and<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.950> levels<00:01:08.250> of<00:01:08.400> salt<00:01:08.610> in<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:08.939> air<00:01:08.970> are

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
and the levels of salt in the air are

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.210 
and the levels of salt in the air are
carefully<00:01:09.689> controlled<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.680> idea<00:01:11.040> is<00:01:11.189> that

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
carefully controlled the idea is that

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.190 
carefully controlled the idea is that
the<00:01:11.400> kids<00:01:11.580> breathe<00:01:11.909> tiny<00:01:12.240> particles<00:01:12.810> of<00:01:12.900> salt

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
the kids breathe tiny particles of salt

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.980 
the kids breathe tiny particles of salt
into<00:01:13.560> their<00:01:13.710> lungs<00:01:13.920> while<00:01:14.220> they<00:01:14.400> play<00:01:14.990> here's

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
into their lungs while they play here's

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.749 
into their lungs while they play here's
how<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.259> medical<00:01:16.710> bit<00:01:16.830> works<00:01:17.040> when<00:01:17.430> people

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
how the medical bit works when people

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.130 
how the medical bit works when people
suffer<00:01:18.000> something<00:01:18.330> that<00:01:18.450> irritates<00:01:18.900> their

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
suffer something that irritates their

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.260 
suffer something that irritates their
breathing<00:01:19.409> like<00:01:19.740> hay<00:01:19.979> fever<00:01:20.250> or<00:01:20.460> asthma<00:01:20.670> it

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
breathing like hay fever or asthma it

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.969 
breathing like hay fever or asthma it
causes<00:01:21.509> tubes<00:01:21.960> in<00:01:22.170> their<00:01:22.290> lungs<00:01:22.470> to<00:01:22.710> become

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
causes tubes in their lungs to become

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.830 
causes tubes in their lungs to become
blocked<00:01:23.310> or<00:01:23.670> swollen<00:01:24.000> by<00:01:24.330> loads<00:01:24.509> of<00:01:24.659> sticky

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
blocked or swollen by loads of sticky

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.929 
blocked or swollen by loads of sticky
stuff<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.590> idea<00:01:25.920> here<00:01:26.159> is<00:01:26.189> that<00:01:26.310> by<00:01:26.549> breathing

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
stuff the idea here is that by breathing

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.969 
stuff the idea here is that by breathing
in<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.210> rock<00:01:27.450> salt<00:01:27.750> it<00:01:27.960> dissolves<00:01:28.590> that<00:01:28.619> guns

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
in the rock salt it dissolves that guns

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.069 
in the rock salt it dissolves that guns
in<00:01:29.189> their<00:01:29.340> lungs<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:29.820> achieves<00:01:30.390> become<00:01:30.720> free

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
in their lungs and achieves become free

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.690 
in their lungs and achieves become free
so<00:01:31.409> they<00:01:31.500> don't<00:01:31.650> server<00:01:31.860> from<00:01:32.040> coughing<00:01:32.340> or

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
so they don't server from coughing or

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.969 
so they don't server from coughing or
wheezing<00:01:33.170> so<00:01:34.170> it<00:01:34.229> seems<00:01:34.439> that<00:01:34.590> this<00:01:34.680> kind<00:01:34.890> of

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
wheezing so it seems that this kind of

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.560 
wheezing so it seems that this kind of
treatment<00:01:35.189> is<00:01:35.670> really<00:01:36.150> good<00:01:36.270> because<00:01:36.390> you

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
treatment is really good because you

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.819 
treatment is really good because you
don't<00:01:36.750> have<00:01:36.780> to<00:01:36.930> take<00:01:37.020> any<00:01:37.229> drugs<00:01:37.409> or<00:01:37.680> any

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
don't have to take any drugs or any

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.530 
don't have to take any drugs or any
medicines<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:38.640> all<00:01:38.970> you<00:01:39.060> have<00:01:39.180> to<00:01:39.240> do<00:01:39.329> is<00:01:39.420> sit

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
medicines and all you have to do is sit

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.719 
medicines and all you have to do is sit
back<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:39.750> breathe<00:01:40.079> so<00:01:40.770> is<00:01:41.040> it<00:01:41.100> proven<00:01:41.640> that

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
back and breathe so is it proven that

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.210 
back and breathe so is it proven that
this<00:01:41.880> thing<00:01:42.150> can<00:01:42.270> really<00:01:42.329> work<00:01:42.890> it<00:01:43.890> is<00:01:44.100> very

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
this thing can really work it is very

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.429 
this thing can really work it is very

drugs<00:01:49.140> because<00:01:49.500> they<00:01:49.770> have<00:01:50.130> been<00:01:50.490> clinically

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030
