got<00:00:34.590> a<00:00:34.649> hi-hat<00:00:35.070> line<00:00:35.309> here<00:00:35.700> I'll<00:00:36.420> just<00:00:36.690> solo

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
got a hi-hat line here I'll just solo

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:44.600 
got a hi-hat line here I'll just solo
the<00:00:37.559> hi-hat<00:00:37.920> and<00:00:43.040> you<00:00:44.040> can<00:00:44.190> see<00:00:44.340> that<00:00:44.489> it's

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
the hi-hat and you can see that it's

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.819 
the hi-hat and you can see that it's
triggering<00:00:44.969> multiple<00:00:45.510> layers<00:00:45.719> virus<00:00:46.649> to

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
retune just this bottom layer that works

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.689 
retune just this bottom layer that works
just<00:00:54.840> as<00:00:54.989> we'd<00:00:55.170> expect<00:00:55.199> only<00:00:56.010> that<00:00:56.309> layer<00:00:56.520> is

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
just as we'd expect only that layer is

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.880 
just as we'd expect only that layer is
being<00:00:56.969> tuned<00:00:57.270> if<00:00:57.840> I<00:00:57.989> want<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.260> tune<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.590> entire

if I have just the pad button selected

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.760 
if I have just the pad button selected
then<00:01:43.270> I<00:01:43.360> will<00:01:43.539> be<00:01:43.659> making<00:01:43.869> changes<00:01:44.049> to<00:01:44.530> the

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
then I will be making changes to the

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.670 
then I will be making changes to the
currently<00:01:45.159> selected<00:01:45.280> layer<00:01:46.240> of<00:01:46.539> all<00:01:46.899> 16<00:01:47.289> pads

currently selected layer of all 16 pads
of<00:01:47.920> this<00:01:48.280> engine<00:01:48.729> now<00:01:49.509> the<00:01:49.600> last<00:01:49.869> button<00:01:50.170> is

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:50.439 
of this engine now the last button is

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:52.320 
of this engine now the last button is
the<00:01:50.860> row<00:01:50.979> button<00:01:51.340> and<00:01:51.670> this<00:01:51.820> allows<00:01:52.119> me<00:01:52.149> to

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
over to the pad mixer you can also see

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.360 
over to the pad mixer you can also see
the<00:02:36.430> same<00:02:36.640> buttons<00:02:37.060> here<00:02:37.680> pads<00:02:38.680> and<00:02:38.859> rows<00:02:39.070> in

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
the same buttons here pads and rows in

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.210 
the same buttons here pads and rows in

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
the pad mixer and layers pads and rows

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.789 
the pad mixer and layers pads and rows
in<00:02:42.579> the<00:02:43.060> layer<00:02:43.209> mixer<00:02:43.660> and<00:02:43.810> these<00:02:44.290> work<00:02:44.560> in

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:44.799 
in the layer mixer and these work in

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:46.979 
in the layer mixer and these work in
exactly<00:02:44.920> the<00:02:45.310> same<00:02:45.549> way<00:02:45.790> in<00:02:46.359> fact<00:02:46.750> they<00:02:46.959> are

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
exactly the same way in fact they are

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:50.160 
exactly the same way in fact they are
the<00:02:47.109> same<00:02:47.410> buttons<00:02:48.030> if<00:02:49.030> we<00:02:49.239> enable<00:02:49.390> pads<00:02:49.840> in

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
the same buttons if we enable pads in

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.229 
the same buttons if we enable pads in
here<00:02:50.620> and<00:02:50.890> go<00:02:51.310> back<00:02:51.340> to<00:02:51.609> the<00:02:51.700> layers<00:02:51.880> page

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
here and go back to the layers page

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:54.270 
here and go back to the layers page
they're<00:02:52.630> enabled<00:02:53.019> here<00:02:53.260> and<00:02:53.680> what<00:02:53.920> that<00:02:54.069> means

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
they're enabled here and what that means

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.740 
they're enabled here and what that means
is<00:02:54.430> we<00:02:54.549> can<00:02:54.579> also<00:02:54.790> make<00:02:55.060> changes<00:02:55.420> in<00:02:55.600> the

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
is we can also make changes in the

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.620 
is we can also make changes in the
layers<00:02:56.109> and<00:02:56.440> pad<00:02:56.829> mixers<00:02:57.310> for<00:02:57.940> example<00:02:58.390> to

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
layers and pad mixers for example to

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.660 
layers and pad mixers for example to
effects<00:02:59.260> that<00:02:59.530> may<00:02:59.680> be<00:02:59.739> on<00:02:59.890> every<00:03:00.130> layer<00:03:00.340> or

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
effects that may be on every layer or

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:08.059 
effects that may be on every layer or
just<00:03:01.090> simply<00:03:01.450> to<00:03:01.690> panning<00:03:02.200> or<00:03:02.410> level<00:03:02.799> and

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:11.430 

that's<00:03:09.069> the<00:03:09.280> layers<00:03:09.970> pads<00:03:10.299> and<00:03:10.569> row<00:03:10.930> modifiers

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
that's the layers pads and row modifiers
