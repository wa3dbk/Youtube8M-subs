box<00:02:32.400> so<00:02:32.670> i'm<00:02:32.819> just<00:02:32.880> going<00:02:33.090> to<00:02:33.150> keep<00:02:33.410> with<00:02:34.410> the

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
box so i'm just going to keep with the

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.860 
box so i'm just going to keep with the
name<00:02:34.650> tow<00:02:34.860> truck<00:02:35.150> it<00:02:36.150> comes<00:02:36.390> with<00:02:36.510> the<00:02:36.599> light

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
name tow truck it comes with the light

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.770 
name tow truck it comes with the light
right<00:02:37.110> here<00:02:37.140> so<00:02:37.830> a<00:02:38.069> walkie-talkie<00:02:38.780> smooth

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
right here so a walkie-talkie smooth

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.479 
right here so a walkie-talkie smooth
wheels<00:02:40.489> pretty<00:02:41.489> nice<00:02:41.720> um<00:02:42.720> no<00:02:43.680> cover<00:02:43.950> but<00:02:44.280> it

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
wheels pretty nice um no cover but it

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:47.620 
wheels pretty nice um no cover but it
has<00:02:44.610> two<00:02:44.849> seats<00:02:45.290> the<00:02:46.290> pilot<00:02:46.859> I<00:02:46.980> mean<00:02:47.220> the

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
has two seats the pilot I mean the

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.270 
has two seats the pilot I mean the
passenger<00:02:48.630> seat<00:02:48.840> is<00:02:49.049> higher<00:02:49.590> up<00:02:49.620> from<00:02:50.160> the

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
passenger seat is higher up from the

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.580 
passenger seat is higher up from the
driver's<00:02:50.549> seat<00:02:50.790> and<00:02:51.000> then<00:02:51.989> also<00:02:52.170> you<00:02:52.350> get<00:02:52.440> this

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
driver's seat and then also you get this

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.009 
driver's seat and then also you get this
detachable<00:02:53.160> toe<00:02:54.470> which<00:02:55.470> I<00:02:55.799> fail<00:02:56.250> at<00:02:56.430> detaching

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 
detachable toe which I fail at detaching

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:59.840 
detachable toe which I fail at detaching
it's<00:02:58.019> going<00:02:58.170> to<00:02:58.230> keep<00:02:58.350> together<00:02:58.560> for<00:02:59.190> now<00:02:59.400> but

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
it's going to keep together for now but

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.340 
it's going to keep together for now but
it<00:03:00.150> has<00:03:00.269> this<00:03:00.299> hook<00:03:00.660> which<00:03:00.900> I'll<00:03:01.049> show<00:03:01.290> you

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
it has this hook which I'll show you

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.430 
it has this hook which I'll show you
when<00:03:02.130> we<00:03:02.160> go<00:03:02.519> into<00:03:02.670> the<00:03:02.819> plane<00:03:03.079> how<00:03:04.079> it<00:03:04.230> works

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
when we go into the plane how it works

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.509 
when we go into the plane how it works
this<00:03:05.280> is<00:03:05.640> our<00:03:07.069> really<00:03:08.069> I<00:03:08.130> don't<00:03:08.190> know<00:03:08.340> what<00:03:08.459> to

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
this is our really I don't know what to

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:10.759 
this is our really I don't know what to
call<00:03:08.549> this<00:03:08.850> I<00:03:09.180> guess<00:03:09.450> just<00:03:09.780> a<00:03:09.930> signal<00:03:10.290> tower<00:03:10.500> or

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
call this I guess just a signal tower or

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:14.180 
call this I guess just a signal tower or
something<00:03:11.359> it<00:03:12.359> spins<00:03:13.049> it<00:03:13.500> has<00:03:13.739> a<00:03:13.769> checkered

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
something it spins it has a checkered

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:20.590 
something it spins it has a checkered
flag<00:03:14.549> of<00:03:14.730> top<00:03:14.940> and<00:03:16.760> some<00:03:17.760> caution<00:03:18.920> caution

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
flag of top and some caution caution

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.590 
flag of top and some caution caution
blockers<00:03:21.600> or<00:03:21.780> something<00:03:23.389> so<00:03:24.389> I'll<00:03:24.450> you<00:03:24.510> the

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
blockers or something so I'll you the

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.059 
blockers or something so I'll you the
truth<00:03:24.750> I<00:03:24.870> think<00:03:25.109> it's<00:03:25.260> kind<00:03:25.440> of<00:03:25.470> pointless<00:03:25.650> if

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:26.069 
truth I think it's kind of pointless if

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:28.250 
truth I think it's kind of pointless if
they<00:03:26.160> put<00:03:26.340> this<00:03:26.430> in<00:03:26.670> and<00:03:26.959> I'm<00:03:27.959> not<00:03:28.139> really

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
they put this in and I'm not really

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.160 
they put this in and I'm not really
going<00:03:28.410> to<00:03:28.470> use<00:03:28.590> it<00:03:28.739> so<00:03:29.840> it's<00:03:30.840> better<00:03:30.989> than

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
going to use it so it's better than

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.550 
going to use it so it's better than
nothing<00:03:31.290> now<00:03:31.970> and<00:03:32.970> here's<00:03:33.209> our<00:03:33.299> plane<00:03:33.569> the

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
nothing now and here's our plane the

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.440 
nothing now and here's our plane the
plane<00:03:34.709> is<00:03:35.100> the<00:03:35.579> main<00:03:35.940> part<00:03:36.150> of<00:03:36.180> the<00:03:36.269> set

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
plane is the main part of the set

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.280 
plane is the main part of the set
obviously<00:03:38.000> on<00:03:39.000> the<00:03:39.120> wings<00:03:39.359> start<00:03:39.989> with<00:03:40.079> wings

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
obviously on the wings start with wings

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.280 
obviously on the wings start with wings
they<00:03:41.190> are<00:03:41.400> bendable<00:03:41.910> at<00:03:42.060> the<00:03:42.180> ends<00:03:42.510> which

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
they are bendable at the ends which

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.830 
they are bendable at the ends which
allows<00:03:43.889> it<00:03:44.100> to<00:03:44.130> be<00:03:44.340> stored<00:03:44.850> easily<00:03:45.060> easily<00:03:45.480> or

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
allows it to be stored easily easily or

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.550 
allows it to be stored easily easily or
okay<00:03:48.840> i'm<00:03:49.319> making<00:03:49.620> a<00:03:49.650> minute<00:03:49.829> anyways

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
okay i'm making a minute anyways

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.190 
okay i'm making a minute anyways
allows<00:03:53.560> them<00:03:53.770> to<00:03:53.860> be<00:03:54.069> stored<00:03:54.370> easily<00:03:54.700> ER<00:03:55.200> but

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
allows them to be stored easily ER but

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.680 
allows them to be stored easily ER but
still<00:03:56.650> they're<00:03:57.160> really<00:03:57.610> difficult<00:03:58.330> to<00:03:58.420> store

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
still they're really difficult to store

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.290 
still they're really difficult to store
that<00:03:59.140> can<00:03:59.290> barely<00:03:59.560> fit<00:03:59.770> on<00:03:59.860> my<00:04:00.040> dresser<00:04:01.030> which

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:01.300 
that can barely fit on my dresser which

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.320 
that can barely fit on my dresser which
is<00:04:01.420> where<00:04:01.569> I<00:04:01.630> keep<00:04:01.780> all<00:04:01.900> my<00:04:01.959> Legos<00:04:03.180> and<00:04:04.180> the

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.330 
is where I keep all my Legos and the

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.020 
is where I keep all my Legos and the
same<00:04:04.510> on<00:04:04.540> the<00:04:04.660> other<00:04:04.690> side<00:04:04.840> it<00:04:05.140> has<00:04:05.260> red<00:04:06.030> red

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
same on the other side it has red red

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.590 
same on the other side it has red red
and<00:04:07.360> green<00:04:07.750> lights<00:04:08.790> so<00:04:09.790> I<00:04:09.850> like<00:04:10.120> to<00:04:10.150> keep<00:04:10.420> them

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600 
and green lights so I like to keep them

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:15.390 
and green lights so I like to keep them
up<00:04:10.780> like<00:04:11.080> this<00:04:11.319> and<00:04:11.620> it<00:04:12.340> twirls<00:04:13.000> 360<00:04:14.400> because

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
up like this and it twirls 360 because

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.229 
up like this and it twirls 360 because
of<00:04:15.760> the<00:04:15.850> front<00:04:16.209> wheel<00:04:16.419> which<00:04:16.959> I'll<00:04:17.109> show<00:04:17.320> you

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
of the front wheel which I'll show you

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:21.900 
of the front wheel which I'll show you
spins<00:04:19.239> all<00:04:19.480> around<00:04:19.810> and<00:04:20.579> then<00:04:21.579> the<00:04:21.700> back

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
spins all around and then the back

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:30.270 
spins all around and then the back
wheels<00:04:25.889> which<00:04:26.889> oh<00:04:27.840> my<00:04:28.840> bad<00:04:29.050> I<00:04:29.320> think<00:04:30.160> you're

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
wheels which oh my bad I think you're

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.100 
wheels which oh my bad I think you're
supposed<00:04:30.460> to<00:04:30.580> be<00:04:30.700> like<00:04:30.880> this<00:04:30.910> one<00:04:31.840> fell<00:04:32.080> off

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 
supposed to be like this one fell off

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:33.650 
supposed to be like this one fell off
earlier<00:04:32.620> so<00:04:32.800> I'll<00:04:32.889> put<00:04:33.010> it<00:04:33.130> back<00:04:33.160> together

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
earlier so I'll put it back together

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:40.920 
earlier so I'll put it back together
they're<00:04:34.660> not<00:04:34.889> they're<00:04:35.889> not<00:04:38.790> pivotable<00:04:39.930> so

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930 
they're not they're not pivotable so

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:45.240 
they're not they're not pivotable so
they<00:04:41.139> just<00:04:41.350> go<00:04:41.590> along<00:04:41.800> with<00:04:41.860> the<00:04:42.070> ride<00:04:44.250> the

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 
they just go along with the ride the

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:52.250 
they just go along with the ride the
cockpit<00:04:46.800> you<00:04:47.800> can<00:04:47.950> take<00:04:48.130> off<00:04:49.320> pretty<00:04:50.320> easily

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:52.260 
cockpit you can take off pretty easily

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
cockpit you can take off pretty easily
what<00:04:53.260> does<00:04:53.350> I<00:04:53.470> say<00:04:53.669> JM<00:04:54.669> number<00:04:55.950> it<00:04:56.950> has<00:04:57.100> one

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:57.280 
what does I say JM number it has one

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.969 
what does I say JM number it has one
seat<00:04:57.520> which<00:04:58.390> technically<00:04:59.380> it<00:04:59.500> should<00:04:59.560> have<00:04:59.770> to

00:04:59.969 --> 00:04:59.979 
seat which technically it should have to

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:05.850 
seat which technically it should have to
and<00:05:00.220> it<00:05:00.820> has<00:05:01.000> surrounding<00:05:03.090> controls<00:05:04.860> pretty

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860 
and it has surrounding controls pretty

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.640 
and it has surrounding controls pretty
neato<00:05:06.130> and<00:05:06.630> then<00:05:07.630> you<00:05:07.900> have<00:05:08.020> two<00:05:08.260> separate

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:08.650 
neato and then you have two separate

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.310 
neato and then you have two separate
pieces<00:05:08.860> on<00:05:09.190> the<00:05:09.280> top<00:05:09.520> which<00:05:10.450> you<00:05:10.630> can<00:05:10.840> take<00:05:11.140> off

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:11.320 
pieces on the top which you can take off

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.529 
pieces on the top which you can take off
but<00:05:11.500> I<00:05:11.650> believe<00:05:11.860> there's<00:05:12.010> like<00:05:12.190> seven<00:05:12.669> seats

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:13.539

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:17.190 
but I believe there's like seven seats
in<00:05:13.720> total<00:05:14.110> including<00:05:14.530> the<00:05:15.370> pilot<00:05:15.990> if<00:05:16.990> I'm

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:17.200
