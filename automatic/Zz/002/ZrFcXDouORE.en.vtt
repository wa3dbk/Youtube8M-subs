sometimes<00:00:45.570> it<00:00:45.750> wont<00:00:45.930> that's<00:00:46.140> why<00:00:46.289> it's<00:00:46.469> not<00:00:46.649> a

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
sometimes it wont that's why it's not a

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.549 
sometimes it wont that's why it's not a
very<00:00:46.920> reliable<00:00:47.250> glitch<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:48.320> the<00:00:49.320> only<00:00:49.469> reason

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
very reliable glitch and the only reason

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.350 
very reliable glitch and the only reason
why<00:00:49.890> I'm<00:00:49.980> showing<00:00:50.160> you<00:00:50.309> guys<00:00:50.370> is<00:00:50.789> because

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
why I'm showing you guys is because

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.840 
why I'm showing you guys is because
creative<00:00:51.870> mode<00:00:52.050> has<00:00:52.230> not<00:00:52.410> been<00:00:52.620> added<00:00:52.980> yet<00:00:53.160> and

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
creative mode has not been added yet and

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.279 
creative mode has not been added yet and
I<00:00:54.030> think<00:00:54.300> they<00:00:54.420> should<00:00:54.629> keep<00:00:54.809> glitches<00:00:55.260> like

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
I think they should keep glitches like

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.220 
I think they should keep glitches like
this<00:00:55.559> game<00:00:55.800> in<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.160> game<00:00:57.090> until<00:00:57.690> creative

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
this game in the game until creative

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.549
