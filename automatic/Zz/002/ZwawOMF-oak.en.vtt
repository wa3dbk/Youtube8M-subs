00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
be a really really good option just

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.920 
be a really really good option just
because<00:00:52.800> when<00:00:53.520> they<00:00:53.640> nuke<00:00:53.879> it<00:00:54.059> with<00:00:54.480> anything

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
because when they nuke it with anything

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.229 
because when they nuke it with anything
that<00:00:54.989> they<00:00:55.170> feel<00:00:55.350> is<00:00:55.500> a<00:00:55.590> danger<00:00:56.039> it<00:00:56.610> just<00:00:56.850> gives

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.039 
cents I definitely think that this card
could<00:01:35.220> have<00:01:35.400> some<00:01:35.670> help<00:01:35.909> insert<00:01:36.540> matchups

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
could have some help insert matchups

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.899 
could have some help insert matchups
especially<00:01:37.979> against<00:01:38.189> dark<00:01:38.430> world<00:01:38.579> they

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
especially against dark world they

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.420 
especially against dark world they
grabbed<00:01:39.150> by<00:01:39.360> it<00:01:39.420> then<00:01:40.170> they<00:01:40.320> sped<00:01:40.590> especially

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
grabbed by it then they sped especially

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.069 
grabbed by it then they sped especially
men<00:01:41.520> doing<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.820> end<00:01:41.939> phase<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:42.390> do<00:01:42.750> your<00:01:42.899> job

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
men doing the end phase and do your job

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.530 
men doing the end phase and do your job
of<00:01:43.259> blowing<00:01:43.860> up<00:01:44.040> cards<00:01:44.399> so<00:01:45.090> I<00:01:45.119> definitely

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
of blowing up cards so I definitely

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.330 
of blowing up cards so I definitely
think<00:01:45.960> that<00:01:46.110> silver<00:01:46.710> Sentinel<00:01:47.009> should<00:01:47.220> be

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
think that silver Sentinel should be

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.550 
think that silver Sentinel should be
tried<00:01:47.640> if<00:01:48.540> you<00:01:48.750> were<00:01:48.930> looking<00:01:49.229> for<00:01:49.439> something

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.230 
new I would definitely play it as a two
of<00:01:52.170> there'd<00:01:53.040> be<00:01:53.220> no<00:01:53.430> way<00:01:53.579> I<00:01:53.610> wouldn't<00:01:54.000> consider

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
of there'd be no way I wouldn't consider

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
playing less than that one just seems

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.550 
playing less than that one just seems
iffy<00:01:57.329> but<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:57.719> at<00:01:57.840> least<00:01:57.930> you<00:01:58.110> ensure<00:01:58.320> that<00:01:58.469> you

iffy but to at least you ensure that you

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.260 
iffy but to at least you ensure that you
