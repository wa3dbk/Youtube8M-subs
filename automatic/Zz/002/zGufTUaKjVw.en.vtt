00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:19.340
 the modern technique mark its imprint our world discovers 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.340
 fascinating perspectives 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.859
 Futuristic technologies are part of our everyday life 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.619
 mobility and characterizes our way of life 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.640
 thanks to modern means of transport our mobility and almost limitless 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.330
 whether in Frankfurt all still the shadow for a business meeting 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.580
 a plane that is always ready to take off for yann by the war 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.310
 advised by the company 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.590
 creativity and invention 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.390
 alert troops or other things that we have to dominate these motions 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.280
 are they better concretize 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.300
 christine wolf well it will do everything for everyone 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.860
 this young woman loves her city with a warm atmosphere and appreciate the 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.030
 variety the proposed hobbies 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.700
 as opposed to his professional activity 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.700
 she needs to move and play sports 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.450
 enjoy life in peace and recharge your batteries 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.270
 finally the holidays arrive and the sun was in the game 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.740
 mobility another sensation is to express one has chosen 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.870
 well beyond country borders 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:33.370
 the generations ap besides which nowadays consider themselves old pros from 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.800
 the 60-year-old sylla has retained its mobility 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.579
 there are always new things to say 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:39.690
 open it's all 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.220
 seeing these images 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.630
 would you have come to mind to suspect a motor impairment 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.570
 where only the center of mobility remains 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.570
 or even thought of leg prostheses 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.910
 these people have one thing in common 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:55.790
 they are final amputees 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.790
 and he wears a prosthesis if the hac 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.509
 a huge leap forward 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:05.929
 in the modern protest of the lower limbs for a mobility that hurts 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:07.780
 a better quality of life 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.570
 the submissive to come adapts to all situations christine walk 

00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:16.539
 the prosthesis and carried out by their joint venture 

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:22.529
 using a software station to the prosthetist customize the syneg 

00:02:22.529 --> 00:02:25.219
 individual patient's individual flow 

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:28.669
 during the walk tests he gives precise instructions on the 

00:02:28.669 --> 00:02:30.619
 different knee functions 

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:33.939
 the patient feels the reassuring effect of the amortization during the phase 

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:34.879
 support 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:38.059
 especially when going down stairs or down a slope 

00:02:39.679 --> 00:02:43.539
 syneg provides patients with optimal safety and dynamics 

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:46.539
 appropriate information it needs 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:51.140
 it is the first prosthetic knee system fully controlled by 

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:54.139
 microprocessor 

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:57.819
 the resistance to the movements of hydraulics are managed by 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:59.179
 electronics 

00:02:59.179 --> 00:03:02.629
 sensors that record information now from 50 to 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:06.019
 hour per second 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:09.019
 hence high technology for a better quality of life 

00:03:13.779 --> 00:03:17.319
 mobility in everyday life as in extreme situations 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:22.799
 syneg is reliability 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:27.309
 around the globe 

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:30.309
 for more autonomy 

00:03:34.029 --> 00:03:35.149
 why children here
