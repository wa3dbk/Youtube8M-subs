00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
one here sometime oh let's see here

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.490 
one here sometime oh let's see here
there's<00:02:32.110> gonna<00:02:32.260> be<00:02:32.500> a<00:02:32.530> second<00:02:34.230> okay<00:02:35.230> I<00:02:35.260> can

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
there's gonna be a second okay I can

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.920 
there's gonna be a second okay I can
actually<00:02:36.940> crank<00:02:37.240> my<00:02:37.360> voltage<00:02:37.720> up<00:02:37.900> a

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
actually crank my voltage up a

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:47.680 
actually crank my voltage up a
little<00:02:38.140> bit<00:02:38.320> higher

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:53.740 

down

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:59.449 

see<00:02:54.750> where<00:02:54.870> it<00:02:54.960> sits<00:02:55.140> after<00:02:55.470> I<00:02:55.500> drop<00:02:55.800> off<00:02:56.010> I<00:02:58.459> was

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
see where it sits after I drop off I was

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:00.740 
see where it sits after I drop off I was
just<00:02:59.610> out<00:02:59.730> here<00:02:59.880> piling<00:03:00.209> the<00:03:00.480> out<00:03:00.540> of<00:03:00.569> it

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
just out here piling the out of it

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.470 
just out here piling the out of it
so<00:03:01.130> my<00:03:02.130> voltage<00:03:02.550> was<00:03:02.819> like<00:03:03.450> thirteen<00:03:03.870> seven

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.510 

I<00:03:06.510> think<00:03:07.410> Floyd<00:03:07.590> comfortably<00:03:08.100> not<00:03:08.280> and<00:03:08.400> don't

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
I think Floyd comfortably not and don't

00:03:08.520 --> 00:05:43.480 
I think Floyd comfortably not and don't
mind<00:03:08.700> if<00:03:08.819> I<00:03:08.880> do

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:43.490 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:47.210 

so<00:05:44.490> I<00:05:44.850> think<00:05:45.480> I'm<00:05:46.230> moving<00:05:46.710> a<00:05:46.740> little<00:05:46.860> bit<00:05:47.040> more

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:47.220 
so I think I'm moving a little bit more

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.760 
so I think I'm moving a little bit more
air<00:05:47.370> than<00:05:47.400> I<00:05:47.580> used<00:05:47.760> to<00:05:47.850> be<00:05:48.260> how<00:05:49.260> I<00:05:49.290> could<00:05:49.590> barely

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:49.770 
air than I used to be how I could barely

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:51.680 
air than I used to be how I could barely
do<00:05:49.950> a<00:05:49.980> little<00:05:50.250> receipt<00:05:50.760> trick<00:05:51.090> with<00:05:51.330> my<00:05:51.540> old

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:51.690 
do a little receipt trick with my old

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:55.010 
do a little receipt trick with my old
twelves<00:05:52.110> and<00:05:52.260> and<00:05:52.530> I<00:05:53.430> was<00:05:53.940> a<00:05:53.970> plastic<00:05:54.810> bottle

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020 
twelves and and I was a plastic bottle

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:56.780 
twelves and and I was a plastic bottle
and<00:05:55.410> she's<00:05:55.830> held<00:05:56.100> steady<00:05:56.400> right<00:05:56.610> in<00:05:56.700> that

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:56.790 
and she's held steady right in that

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:58.730 
and she's held steady right in that
window<00:05:57.120> so<00:05:57.420> I'm<00:05:57.900> on<00:05:58.020> the<00:05:58.110> right<00:05:58.230> track<00:05:58.260> that's

00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:58.740 
window so I'm on the right track that's

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:02.690 
window so I'm on the right track that's
still<00:06:00.080> without<00:06:01.080> tuning<00:06:01.710> or<00:06:01.950> anything<00:06:02.280> yet<00:06:02.490> I

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:02.700 
still without tuning or anything yet I

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:04.970 
still without tuning or anything yet I
just<00:06:03.240> got<00:06:03.750> everything<00:06:03.840> wired<00:06:04.200> up<00:06:04.470> last<00:06:04.710> night

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:04.980 
just got everything wired up last night

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:06.410 
just got everything wired up last night
so<00:06:05.160> I<00:06:05.220> haven't<00:06:05.430> tuned<00:06:05.610> it<00:06:05.790> probably<00:06:06.360> this

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:06.420 
so I haven't tuned it probably this

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:07.880 
so I haven't tuned it probably this
weekend<00:06:06.840> I'll<00:06:06.960> do<00:06:07.080> that<00:06:07.200> spend<00:06:07.560> a<00:06:07.710> little<00:06:07.770> bit

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:07.890 
weekend I'll do that spend a little bit

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:11.150 
weekend I'll do that spend a little bit
more<00:06:08.160> but<00:06:09.470> reaching<00:06:10.470> uh<00:06:10.590> trying<00:06:10.890> to<00:06:10.950> get<00:06:11.040> that

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:11.160 
more but reaching uh trying to get that

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.370 
more but reaching uh trying to get that
one<00:06:11.340> fifty<00:06:11.700> point<00:06:11.940> one<00:06:12.600> forty<00:06:12.930> eight<00:06:13.080> point

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:13.380 
one fifty point one forty eight point

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:14.600 
one fifty point one forty eight point
nine<00:06:13.500> eight<00:06:13.710> to<00:06:14.100> where<00:06:14.190> I'm<00:06:14.280> at<00:06:14.400> right<00:06:14.520> now

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:14.610 
nine eight to where I'm at right now

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:16.100 
nine eight to where I'm at right now
just<00:06:15.210> sitting<00:06:15.450> the<00:06:15.600> way<00:06:15.690> it<00:06:15.810> is

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:16.110 
just sitting the way it is
