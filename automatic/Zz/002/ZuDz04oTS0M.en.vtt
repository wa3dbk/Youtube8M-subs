 Hi, here is Emily from Bite Size Vegan and welcome to a new 'vegan nugget'. Today one 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:09.349
 new episode of my interview with vegan activist Gary Yourofsky. With the overwhelming 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:14.129
 horror of unnecessary animal suffering in the world, it is easy to lose hope that every 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:19.279
 significant change will happen soon, if it happens. In this interview segment I ask 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:23.660
 Gary to his thoughts about whether we are going to experience a vegan world and then I share 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.330
 my thoughts on this before I ask about yours. So this is for a vegan world. 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.520
 Do you think there will come a day where veganism is the norm and meat, dairy and egg eaters 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.880
 be in the minority? If so, how long do you think it will take before we get there? 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.330
 It depends on what day you ask. 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:50.840
 If you asked me after last week's speeches, I had 4 in Charlotte, I had 3 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:57.840
 in Rhode Island. Apart from 2, all more than 300 students were great. Only 2 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:05.690
 were negative. O man, quickly. Sooner than later. But if you ask after a bad week, 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.550
 if more people want to contradict or 'fight' or maybe I saw something 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:17.550
 terrible, was exposed to something. Then I just say no, it is only possible 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.490
 I know that injustice cannot last forever. Animals will one day get their freedom. 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:31.270
 When? I wish I knew. I once thought it would never happen if I was alive. 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.250
 But considering how things are going in Israel, I don't know that for sure anymore. I am 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:42.340
 44 so we still have quite some time for the liberation of the animals in this world. 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:48.549
 I think it's the first time in Israel, I'm pretty sure about that. I'll tell you 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:52.780
 what's interesting about that, I've been asked by many people in Israel, "why 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:58.450
 here? Why us? "Well, it's supposed to be God's holy land. It seems like the 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:05.450
 ideal place to wipe out specialism and where animals and people can live together peacefully. 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:10.549
 It is going to happen there first, and then it will spread like fire. 

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:16.439
 Once most people do it once. More and more are coming, 

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:22.209
 day after day, thousands and thousands of people every week, every month, Tal Gilboa was only 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:28.659
 in the The Big Brother show in Israel. Research says she converted 80,000 in the few months she did 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:33.900
 was in this show. It is going on there. So I definitely think it's possible. 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.389
 Again, injustice cannot go on forever, but it took 400 years to convince the whites 

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:44.569
 in America that she could not have black slaves, you understand why this takes so long. 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:48.349
 I hope you enjoyed hearing Gary's opinion on this. I would like to believe that 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:52.829
 a vegan world is going to happen during my life. Like Gary, I have days where it 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:57.809
 a real possibility, and other days it is a far unreachable dream. What according to 

00:02:57.809 --> 00:03:03.290
 The most important thing for me is that we do not lose hope. And we never 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:08.559
 doubting the impact that even one person can have. Whether you love Gary or hate him, you have to admit 

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:13.959
 that he has proven how much influence a person can have. You have a voice and 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:20.959
 can speak for those who cannot speak for themselves. You can make a change. You can make a difference. 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:25.829
 I know it is overwhelming and sometimes the challenge seems too great. I had and have 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:30.129
 still my own struggle with this, which I shared in my story about my journey 

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:37.129
 to activism by Bite Size Vegan. But change is possible. Just take action. 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.059
 Whatever that is. And if you wonder what would happen to the animals and 

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:46.120
 with the organic industry and the farmers if the world became vegan, watch this video 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:51.349
 where I discuss this. Believe me. It is a good problem to have. Now you are 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:55.230
 I love you on this subject - do you think the world will ever be vegan? Will the 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:00.099
 do animals ever get the freedom they deserve so much? Do you think that will happen during our life? 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:05.409
 Are you struggling with the overwhelming amount of suffering that there is? Let me know 

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:10.650
 in the comments. I really appreciate your insights. Now we will close with Gary.

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:20.650
