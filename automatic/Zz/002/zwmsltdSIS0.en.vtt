quilt<00:00:09.870> block<00:00:11.240> I've<00:00:12.240> made<00:00:12.480> this<00:00:12.630> quilt<00:00:12.900> using<00:00:13.440> a

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
quilt block I've made this quilt using a

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.709 
quilt block I've made this quilt using a
variation<00:00:14.040> of<00:00:14.400> the<00:00:14.580> attics<00:00:14.940> window<00:00:15.389> quilt

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
variation of the attics window quilt

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.460 
variation of the attics window quilt
block<00:00:16.220> the<00:00:17.220> way<00:00:17.430> I've<00:00:17.670> changed<00:00:18.210> it<00:00:18.449> is<00:00:18.660> to<00:00:19.080> make

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
block the way I've changed it is to make

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.920 
block the way I've changed it is to make
a<00:00:21.199> miter<00:00:22.199> at<00:00:22.710> each<00:00:23.070> of<00:00:23.460> these<00:00:23.910> two<00:00:24.240> diagonal

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
a miter at each of these two diagonal

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.230 
a miter at each of these two diagonal
corners<00:00:25.410> normally<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.400> attic<00:00:26.670> windows<00:00:27.000> would

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
corners normally the attic windows would

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.820 
corners normally the attic windows would
just<00:00:27.420> be<00:00:27.539> there<00:00:27.720> with<00:00:27.869> that<00:00:28.050> diagonal<00:00:28.470> and

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
just be there with that diagonal and

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.980 
just be there with that diagonal and
then<00:00:29.369> this<00:00:29.580> would<00:00:29.820> be<00:00:29.970> a<00:00:30.000> solid<00:00:30.330> round<00:00:30.660> there

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
then this would be a solid round there

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.930 
then this would be a solid round there
but<00:00:31.619> by<00:00:31.800> doing<00:00:32.070> that<00:00:32.189> I've<00:00:32.489> been<00:00:32.610> able<00:00:32.790> to

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
but by doing that I've been able to

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.240 
but by doing that I've been able to
rotate<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.719> block<00:00:34.140> so<00:00:34.500> that<00:00:34.530> here<00:00:34.890> I've<00:00:35.040> got

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
rotate the block so that here I've got

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.250 
rotate the block so that here I've got
the<00:00:35.790> red<00:00:35.969> triangle<00:00:36.480> there<00:00:36.660> on<00:00:36.870> bottom<00:00:37.230> right

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
the red triangle there on bottom right

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.590 
the red triangle there on bottom right
and<00:00:37.739> next<00:00:38.070> to<00:00:38.160> it<00:00:38.250> I've<00:00:38.399> got<00:00:38.550> it<00:00:38.670> bottom<00:00:39.090> left

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
and next to it I've got it bottom left

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.810 
and next to it I've got it bottom left
and<00:00:39.930> so<00:00:40.680> on<00:00:40.829> and<00:00:41.070> that's<00:00:41.250> how<00:00:41.370> I'm<00:00:41.610> getting

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
and so on and that's how I'm getting

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.700 
and so on and that's how I'm getting

and a pink one and then drew a line
along<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.119> diagonal<00:02:00.659> then<00:02:01.290> I<00:02:01.409> started<00:02:01.710> Essene

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
along the diagonal then I started Essene

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.550 
along the diagonal then I started Essene
quarter<00:02:02.460> an<00:02:02.610> inch<00:02:02.790> either<00:02:03.060> side<00:02:03.479> of<00:02:03.509> that<00:02:03.719> line

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
quarter an inch either side of that line

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.530 
quarter an inch either side of that line
and<00:02:04.650> cut<00:02:05.070> along<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.549> line<00:02:05.760> to<00:02:05.970> give<00:02:06.119> me<00:02:06.299> two

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
and cut along the line to give me two

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.630 
and cut along the line to give me two
triangles<00:02:07.470> each<00:02:07.770> with<00:02:08.009> a<00:02:08.039> seam<00:02:08.340> along<00:02:08.580> the

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
triangles each with a seam along the

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.260 
triangles each with a seam along the
base<00:02:08.970> and<00:02:09.300> these<00:02:10.020> open<00:02:10.709> up<00:02:10.830> to<00:02:11.430> give<00:02:11.670> you<00:02:11.850> half

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
base and these open up to give you half

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.230 
base and these open up to give you half
square<00:02:12.600> triangles<00:02:13.400> you'll<00:02:14.400> get<00:02:14.640> two<00:02:14.880> of<00:02:14.910> these

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
square triangles you'll get two of these

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.510 
square triangles you'll get two of these
from<00:02:16.110> each<00:02:16.230> pair<00:02:16.500> of<00:02:16.650> squares<00:02:16.920> that<00:02:17.100> you<00:02:17.160> begin

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
from each pair of squares that you begin

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.730 
from each pair of squares that you begin
with<00:02:17.760> and<00:02:18.000> these<00:02:18.600> are<00:02:18.900> two<00:02:19.140> and<00:02:19.290> a<00:02:19.319> half<00:02:19.500> inch

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
with and these are two and a half inch

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.610 
with and these are two and a half inch
squares<00:02:20.160> now<00:02:20.850> you<00:02:20.910> just<00:02:21.180> need<00:02:21.270> to<00:02:21.569> trim<00:02:22.470> the

without<00:02:51.480> this<00:02:51.900> if<00:02:52.650> that<00:02:52.709> was<00:02:53.220> just<00:02:53.670> solid

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
without this if that was just solid

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.949 
without this if that was just solid
color<00:02:54.950> this<00:02:55.950> is<00:02:56.220> the<00:02:56.430> basic<00:02:56.940> outline<00:02:57.569> for<00:02:57.870> the

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
color this is the basic outline for the

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.680 
color this is the basic outline for the
attic<00:02:58.350> window<00:02:58.530> with<00:02:59.250> just<00:02:59.519> that<00:02:59.670> one<00:02:59.730> diagonal

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
attic window with just that one diagonal

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:01.430 
attic window with just that one diagonal
down<00:03:00.870> there

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
down there

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.410 
down there
the<00:03:01.860> reason<00:03:02.190> I've<00:03:02.310> given<00:03:02.670> it<00:03:02.790> one<00:03:02.970> up<00:03:03.120> the<00:03:03.239> top

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
the reason I've given it one up the top

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.210 
the reason I've given it one up the top
here<00:03:03.630> as<00:03:03.810> well<00:03:04.050> is<00:03:04.350> so<00:03:04.739> that<00:03:04.860> it<00:03:04.950> can<00:03:04.980> be

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
here as well is so that it can be

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.610 
here as well is so that it can be
reversible<00:03:05.790> so<00:03:06.000> I<00:03:06.030> can<00:03:06.300> rotate<00:03:06.480> this<00:03:06.900> block

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
reversible so I can rotate this block

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.979 
reversible so I can rotate this block
within<00:03:08.160> the<00:03:08.430> quilt<00:03:08.670> to<00:03:09.030> give<00:03:09.299> the<00:03:09.480> overall

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
within the quilt to give the overall

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.259 
within the quilt to give the overall
design<00:03:10.170> that<00:03:10.620> I<00:03:10.650> want<00:03:11.010> so<00:03:11.730> what<00:03:11.940> I'm<00:03:12.030> going<00:03:12.180> to

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
design that I want so what I'm going to

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:15.259 
design that I want so what I'm going to
do<00:03:12.420> now<00:03:12.570> is<00:03:12.780> so<00:03:13.079> these<00:03:13.350> three<00:03:13.980> pieces<00:03:14.940> together

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
do now is so these three pieces together

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:18.610 
do now is so these three pieces together
and<00:03:15.989> also<00:03:16.500> the<00:03:17.160> ha<00:03:17.519> square<00:03:17.790> triangles<00:03:18.269> to<00:03:18.510> the

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
and also the ha square triangles to the

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.900 
and also the ha square triangles to the
strips<00:03:19.620> that<00:03:19.829> they<00:03:20.010> belong<00:03:20.280> to<00:03:20.489> there<00:03:20.730> and

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
strips that they belong to there and

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.449 
strips that they belong to there and
then<00:03:21.420> I<00:03:21.510> can<00:03:21.720> sew<00:03:21.959> those<00:03:22.230> across<00:03:22.860> to<00:03:23.100> the<00:03:23.220> sides

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
then I can sew those across to the sides

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.670 
then I can sew those across to the sides
and<00:03:23.820> that<00:03:24.360> will<00:03:24.600> be<00:03:24.720> the<00:03:24.870> completed<00:03:25.440> quilt

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
and that will be the completed quilt

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.310 
and that will be the completed quilt
block<00:03:25.980> and<00:03:26.250> I<00:03:26.459> need<00:03:26.640> to<00:03:26.880> make<00:03:27.079> sixteen<00:03:28.079> of

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
block and I need to make sixteen of

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.949 
block and I need to make sixteen of

rather of the central square and on the

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:36.949 
rather of the central square and on the
sides<00:03:35.760> I've<00:03:36.000> shown<00:03:36.209> the<00:03:36.359> strip<00:03:36.600> to<00:03:36.750> the<00:03:36.840> half

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
sides I've shown the strip to the half

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.080 
sides I've shown the strip to the half
square<00:03:37.230> triangles<00:03:37.769> so<00:03:38.250> now<00:03:38.489> I've<00:03:38.730> got<00:03:38.970> the

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
square triangles so now I've got the

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.460 
square triangles so now I've got the
three<00:03:39.299> pieces<00:03:39.540> that<00:03:39.690> I<00:03:39.900> can<00:03:40.079> sew<00:03:40.260> together

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
three pieces that I can sew together

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.380 
three pieces that I can sew together

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
block this is a completed quilt block it

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.680 
block this is a completed quilt block it
measures<00:03:46.829> ten<00:03:47.340> and<00:03:47.489> a<00:03:47.519> half<00:03:47.609> inches<00:03:47.880> square<00:03:48.480> at

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
measures ten and a half inches square at

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.140 
measures ten and a half inches square at
this<00:03:48.900> stage<00:03:49.230> as<00:03:50.220> you<00:03:50.370> can<00:03:50.489> see<00:03:50.609> I've<00:03:50.730> now<00:03:50.910> got<00:03:51.120> a

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
this stage as you can see I've now got a

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.060 
this stage as you can see I've now got a
red<00:03:51.390> triangle<00:03:51.750> cutting<00:03:52.320> across<00:03:52.620> the<00:03:52.859> outside

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
red triangle cutting across the outside

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:56.630 
red triangle cutting across the outside
on<00:03:53.700> that<00:03:53.730> side<00:03:54.269> and<00:03:54.480> pink<00:03:55.320> on<00:03:56.040> the<00:03:56.250> other<00:03:56.370> half

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
on that side and pink on the other half

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.539 
on that side and pink on the other half
in<00:03:56.970> the<00:03:57.000> across<00:03:57.660> the<00:03:57.840> diagonal<00:03:58.230> so<00:03:58.950> now<00:03:59.280> I'm

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
in the across the diagonal so now I'm

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:01.880 
in the across the diagonal so now I'm
going<00:03:59.760> to<00:03:59.910> sew<00:04:00.090> the<00:04:00.269> blocks<00:04:00.510> together<00:04:00.900> using<00:04:01.650> a

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
going to sew the blocks together using a

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.190 
going to sew the blocks together using a
turn<00:04:02.130> off<00:04:02.370> inch<00:04:02.670> strip<00:04:03.060> of<00:04:03.239> green<00:04:03.540> sashing

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
turn off inch strip of green sashing

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.830 
turn off inch strip of green sashing
this<00:04:04.680> green<00:04:05.070> is<00:04:05.340> rather<00:04:05.549> an<00:04:06.030> unusual<00:04:06.209> green

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
this green is rather an unusual green

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.050 
this green is rather an unusual green
for<00:04:07.470> the<00:04:07.590> leaves<00:04:07.620> and<00:04:08.070> it<00:04:08.160> matches<00:04:08.340> that<00:04:08.579> green

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
for the leaves and it matches that green

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.990 
for the leaves and it matches that green
within<00:04:09.600> the<00:04:09.780> squares<00:04:10.260> there<00:04:10.609> and<00:04:11.609> now<00:04:11.760> these

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
within the squares there and now these

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.350 
within the squares there and now these
are<00:04:12.060> turn<00:04:12.450> off<00:04:12.599> inches<00:04:13.050> wide<00:04:13.260> and

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:14.360 
are turn off inches wide and

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.600 
are turn off inches wide and
ten<00:04:14.690> and<00:04:14.870> a<00:04:14.900> half<00:04:15.020> inches<00:04:15.500> long<00:04:15.530> so<00:04:16.340> I'm<00:04:16.459> going

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:16.610 
ten and a half inches long so I'm going

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:19.360 
ten and a half inches long so I'm going
to<00:04:16.700> sew<00:04:16.940> the<00:04:17.150> blocks<00:04:17.420> together<00:04:17.630> in<00:04:18.049> Rosoff<00:04:18.680> in

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
to sew the blocks together in Rosoff in

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.910 
to sew the blocks together in Rosoff in
four<00:04:19.670> rows<00:04:19.850> of<00:04:19.880> four<00:04:20.450> and<00:04:20.720> I'm<00:04:21.440> going<00:04:21.650> to<00:04:21.709> have

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:21.920 
four rows of four and I'm going to have

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.980 
four rows of four and I'm going to have
three<00:04:22.280> of<00:04:22.310> these<00:04:22.670> sashing<00:04:23.420> strips<00:04:23.780> across

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
three of these sashing strips across

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.770 
three of these sashing strips across
each<00:04:24.380> row<00:04:24.710> so<00:04:25.340> that<00:04:25.610> there's<00:04:25.850> no<00:04:26.150> sashing<00:04:26.660> at

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
each row so that there's no sashing at

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.600 
each row so that there's no sashing at
the<00:04:26.900> end<00:04:27.080> and<00:04:27.440> then<00:04:27.920> they'll<00:04:28.100> be<00:04:28.250> assessing

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 
the end and then they'll be assessing

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:31.990 
the end and then they'll be assessing
between<00:04:29.180> each<00:04:29.510> of<00:04:29.810> the<00:04:29.990> blocks<00:04:30.950> but<00:04:31.580> none<00:04:31.820> at

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 
between each of the blocks but none at

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.540 
between each of the blocks but none at
the<00:04:32.120> far<00:04:32.330> end<00:04:32.540> as<00:04:32.750> well<00:04:33.100> and<00:04:34.100> now<00:04:34.250> what<00:04:34.430> I'm

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550 
the far end as well and now what I'm

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.310 
the far end as well and now what I'm
doing<00:04:34.580> is<00:04:34.850> rotating<00:04:35.480> them<00:04:35.630> so<00:04:35.900> that<00:04:36.080> here

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 
doing is rotating them so that here

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.160 
doing is rotating them so that here
you've<00:04:36.560> got<00:04:36.770> the<00:04:36.920> red<00:04:37.130> triangle<00:04:37.790> is<00:04:38.020> on<00:04:39.020> the

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:39.170 
you've got the red triangle is on the

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:41.320 
you've got the red triangle is on the
bottom<00:04:39.440> half<00:04:39.680> there<00:04:40.070> and<00:04:40.280> doing<00:04:40.880> the<00:04:40.970> one<00:04:41.120> next

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 
bottom half there and doing the one next

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.500 
bottom half there and doing the one next
to<00:04:41.510> it<00:04:41.600> it'll<00:04:42.110> be<00:04:42.290> on<00:04:42.950> the<00:04:43.360> still<00:04:44.360> on<00:04:44.480> the

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:44.510 
to it it'll be on the still on the

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:46.180 
to it it'll be on the still on the
bottom<00:04:44.840> half<00:04:45.050> but<00:04:45.320> on<00:04:45.440> the<00:04:45.620> left-hand<00:04:46.070> side

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
bottom half but on the left-hand side

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:47.530 
bottom half but on the left-hand side
whereas<00:04:46.760> there<00:04:46.940> it's<00:04:47.060> on<00:04:47.210> the<00:04:47.330> right-hand

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:47.540 
whereas there it's on the right-hand

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:48.310 
whereas there it's on the right-hand
side

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:48.320 
side

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.470 
side
and<00:04:48.410> this<00:04:48.950> will<00:04:49.130> give<00:04:49.280> me<00:04:49.460> that<00:04:49.670> framework<00:04:50.060> of

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:50.480 
and this will give me that framework of

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.740 
and this will give me that framework of
a<00:04:50.570> bigger<00:04:50.780> overall<00:04:51.350> triangle<00:04:52.070> from<00:04:52.250> the<00:04:52.310> red

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750 
a bigger overall triangle from the red

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.120 
a bigger overall triangle from the red
and<00:04:53.750> I'm<00:04:53.900> willing<00:04:54.050> to<00:04:54.170> keep<00:04:54.320> alternating<00:04:54.620> them

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.130 
and I'm willing to keep alternating them

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:57.610 
and I'm willing to keep alternating them
across<00:04:55.340> the<00:04:55.640> row<00:04:55.790> then<00:04:56.600> I<00:04:56.870> would<00:04:57.140> do<00:04:57.290> the<00:04:57.440> same

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620 
across the row then I would do the same

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.010 
across the row then I would do the same
down<00:04:57.920> here<00:04:58.270> but<00:04:59.270> it<00:04:59.390> will<00:04:59.450> be<00:04:59.630> a<00:04:59.660> different

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
down here but it will be a different

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.440 
down here but it will be a different
rotation<00:05:00.170> but<00:05:01.010> I'll<00:05:01.130> show<00:05:01.340> you<00:05:01.400> each<00:05:01.670> row<00:05:01.970> as<00:05:02.270> I

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:02.450 
rotation but I'll show you each row as I

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:05.230 
rotation but I'll show you each row as I
complete<00:05:02.870> them<00:05:03.280> these<00:05:04.280> are<00:05:04.550> the<00:05:04.640> first<00:05:04.820> two

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 
complete them these are the first two

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.570 
complete them these are the first two
rows<00:05:05.480> of<00:05:05.510> the<00:05:05.840> quilt<00:05:06.140> and<00:05:06.410> if<00:05:07.070> you<00:05:07.250> look<00:05:07.430> across

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580 
rows of the quilt and if you look across

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.880 
rows of the quilt and if you look across
the<00:05:07.790> first<00:05:08.150> row<00:05:08.390> I've<00:05:08.750> got<00:05:08.960> the<00:05:09.110> red<00:05:09.290> triangle

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:09.890 
the first row I've got the red triangle

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:12.430 
the first row I've got the red triangle
going<00:05:10.160> up<00:05:10.550> there<00:05:10.910> and<00:05:11.150> then<00:05:11.330> down<00:05:11.630> to<00:05:12.080> make<00:05:12.230> one

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:12.440 
going up there and then down to make one

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.460 
going up there and then down to make one
larger<00:05:12.860> triangle<00:05:13.310> there<00:05:13.520> and<00:05:14.110> then<00:05:15.110> the<00:05:15.290> same

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:15.470 
larger triangle there and then the same

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:17.440 
larger triangle there and then the same
again<00:05:15.740> for<00:05:15.770> the<00:05:15.980> second<00:05:16.430> pair<00:05:16.640> of<00:05:16.670> of<00:05:17.060> blocks

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:17.450 
again for the second pair of of blocks

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:19.750 
again for the second pair of of blocks
you've<00:05:17.690> got<00:05:17.870> the<00:05:17.990> triangle<00:05:18.200> red<00:05:19.010> going<00:05:19.280> up<00:05:19.520> and

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:19.760 
you've got the triangle red going up and

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.330 
you've got the triangle red going up and
down<00:05:19.970> now<00:05:20.720> for<00:05:20.780> the<00:05:21.110> second<00:05:21.620> row<00:05:21.770> underneath

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:22.340 
down now for the second row underneath

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:24.670 
down now for the second row underneath
it<00:05:22.580> the<00:05:23.210> same<00:05:23.660> thing<00:05:23.900> is<00:05:24.020> happening<00:05:24.140> but<00:05:24.530> in

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:24.680 
it the same thing is happening but in

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.950 
it the same thing is happening but in
Reverse<00:05:25.010> so<00:05:25.340> I've<00:05:25.520> got<00:05:25.730> the<00:05:25.910> larger<00:05:26.750> red

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:26.960 
Reverse so I've got the larger red

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.680 
Reverse so I've got the larger red
triangle<00:05:27.530> made<00:05:27.680> by<00:05:27.890> those<00:05:28.040> two<00:05:28.690> triangles

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:29.690 
triangle made by those two triangles

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:32.200 
triangle made by those two triangles
there<00:05:29.930> is<00:05:30.230> pointing<00:05:30.919> downwards<00:05:31.430> and<00:05:31.669> the<00:05:32.000> same
