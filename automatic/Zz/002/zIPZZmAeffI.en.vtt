from the floor and ceiling will arrive

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.640 
from the floor and ceiling will arrive
we<00:00:55.160> will<00:00:55.190> only<00:00:55.460> use<00:00:55.610> the<00:00:55.990> the<00:00:56.990> time<00:00:57.230> period

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:57.650 
we will only use the the time period

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:58.990 
we will only use the the time period
between<00:00:57.680> the<00:00:58.250> moment<00:00:58.550> that<00:00:58.640> the<00:00:58.730> impulse

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
between the moment that the impulse

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.620 
between the moment that the impulse
first<00:00:59.420> arrives<00:00:59.750> at<00:01:00.020> the<00:01:00.110> microphone<00:01:00.590> and

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:01.630 
first arrives at the microphone and

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.060 
first arrives at the microphone and
until<00:01:02.630> the<00:01:02.750> first<00:01:02.989> echo<00:01:03.380> arrives<00:01:03.739> and<00:01:04.040> that

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
until the first echo arrives and that

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:05.710 
until the first echo arrives and that
way<00:01:04.430> we<00:01:04.610> know<00:01:04.729> that<00:01:04.940> we're<00:01:05.089> measuring<00:01:05.270> only

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
way we know that we're measuring only

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.020 
way we know that we're measuring only
the<00:01:05.990> speaker<00:01:06.229> and<00:01:06.650> not<00:01:07.190> the<00:01:07.460> echoes<00:01:07.760> from<00:01:07.940> the

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
the speaker and not the echoes from the

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.640 
the speaker and not the echoes from the
walls<00:01:08.330> because<00:01:08.630> the<00:01:08.900> echoes<00:01:09.110> from<00:01:09.260> the<00:01:09.350> walls

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.650 
walls because the echoes from the walls

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.010 
walls because the echoes from the walls
will<00:01:09.979> vary<00:01:10.340> between<00:01:10.550> my<00:01:11.090> listen<00:01:11.420> human<00:01:11.840> ears

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
will vary between my listen human ears

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.180 
will vary between my listen human ears
whereas<00:01:12.860> the<00:01:12.950> speaker<00:01:13.370> should<00:01:13.520> not<00:01:15.040> we<00:01:16.040> will

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.190 
whereas the speaker should not we will

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.090 
whereas the speaker should not we will
then<00:01:16.400> check<00:01:17.090> whether<00:01:17.450> this<00:01:17.660> is<00:01:17.869> within<00:01:18.050> 0.2<00:01:18.800> DB

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
then check whether this is within 0.2 DB

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.340 
then check whether this is within 0.2 DB
of<00:01:19.130> the<00:01:19.369> reference<00:01:19.729> prototype<00:01:20.270> within<00:01:21.080> five

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
of the reference prototype within five

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.030 
of the reference prototype within five
degrees<00:01:21.770> of<00:01:21.920> the<00:01:22.070> reference<00:01:22.430> prototype<00:01:22.940> and

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 
degrees of the reference prototype and

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.140 
degrees of the reference prototype and
that's<00:01:25.040> the<00:01:25.190> phase<00:01:25.340> measurement<00:01:25.820> of<00:01:25.910> course

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
that's the phase measurement of course

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:27.760 
that's the phase measurement of course
and<00:01:26.450> then<00:01:26.540> we'll<00:01:26.720> check<00:01:26.900> the<00:01:27.050> impedance<00:01:27.500> make

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
and then we'll check the impedance make

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.680 
and then we'll check the impedance make
sure<00:01:28.009> that<00:01:28.430> it's<00:01:28.640> within<00:01:28.880> I<00:01:29.180> think<00:01:29.450> three

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:29.690 
sure that it's within I think three

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.139 
sure that it's within I think three
times<00:01:29.810> the<00:01:30.530> reference<00:01:30.890> prototype<00:01:31.399> at<00:01:31.910> any

00:01:32.139 --> 00:01:32.149 
times the reference prototype at any

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:36.580 
times the reference prototype at any
frequency<00:01:32.530> at<00:01:33.530> that<00:01:33.800> moment<00:01:34.450> we<00:01:35.450> will<00:01:35.630> do<00:01:36.560> a

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
frequency at that moment we will do a

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.139 
frequency at that moment we will do a
short<00:01:36.979> listening<00:01:37.580> session<00:01:37.970> with<00:01:38.119> that

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:38.149 
short listening session with that

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:40.050 
short listening session with that
speaker<00:01:38.660> and<00:01:38.869> then<00:01:39.050> it's<00:01:39.200> ready<00:01:39.380> to<00:01:39.440> ship<00:01:39.619> out

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
speaker and then it's ready to ship out

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.910 
speaker and then it's ready to ship out
it<00:01:41.060> will<00:01:41.180> be<00:01:41.300> packed<00:01:41.570> with<00:01:41.780> a<00:01:42.020> vacuum<00:01:42.470> frame<00:01:42.740> so

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
it will be packed with a vacuum frame so

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.340 
it will be packed with a vacuum frame so
it<00:01:43.009> doesn't<00:01:43.280> get<00:01:43.369> scratched<00:01:43.550> and<00:01:44.090> be<00:01:45.050> off<00:01:45.170> to

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
it doesn't get scratched and be off to

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.140 
it doesn't get scratched and be off to
the<00:01:45.440> customer<00:01:45.619> we're<00:01:46.340> ready<00:01:46.550> to<00:01:46.700> go<00:01:46.850> can<00:01:47.120> you

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:47.150 
the customer we're ready to go can you

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:53.540 
the customer we're ready to go can you
let<00:01:47.420> er<00:01:47.450> fly<00:01:50.650> yeah

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:53.550 
let er fly yeah

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:08.120 

take<00:02:03.119> a<00:02:03.150> minute<00:02:03.479> here<00:02:04.189> yeah<00:02:06.680> once<00:02:07.680> a<00:02:07.799> speaker

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
take a minute here yeah once a speaker

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:09.949 
take a minute here yeah once a speaker
is<00:02:08.220> a<00:02:08.250> proof<00:02:08.550> for<00:02:08.789> sending<00:02:09.209> nobody<00:02:09.539> does

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
is a proof for sending nobody does

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.690 
is a proof for sending nobody does
anything<00:02:10.349> to<00:02:10.679> it<00:02:10.830> other<00:02:11.039> than<00:02:11.220> immediately

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
anything to it other than immediately

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.250 
anything to it other than immediately
put<00:02:12.000> it<00:02:12.120> in<00:02:12.239> the<00:02:12.330> package<00:02:12.720> look<00:02:12.900> at<00:02:13.050> that

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
put it in the package look at that

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.699 
put it in the package look at that
anything<00:02:13.709> sees<00:02:14.400> ads<00:02:15.200> so<00:02:16.200> it's<00:02:16.349> going<00:02:16.500> to<00:02:16.590> go

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
anything sees ads so it's going to go

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.190 
anything sees ads so it's going to go
from<00:02:16.980> testing<00:02:17.430> directly<00:02:18.180> to<00:02:18.360> package<00:02:18.780> and

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
from testing directly to package and

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:28.020 
from testing directly to package and
we're<00:02:20.160> about<00:02:20.220> ready<00:02:20.459> to<00:02:20.610> go

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.679 

and<00:02:28.390> we're<00:02:28.600> waiting

00:02:30.679 --> 00:02:30.689 
and we're waiting

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:38.460 
and we're waiting
there<00:02:31.689> we<00:02:31.780> go

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:49.550 

good

and<00:02:50.069> they're<00:02:50.250> shaking<00:02:50.459> their<00:02:50.640> hands<00:02:50.940> and<00:02:51.560> in

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
and they're shaking their hands and in

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:59.180 
and they're shaking their hands and in
agreement<00:02:52.890> it's<00:02:53.190> good<00:02:55.250> it's<00:02:56.250> a<00:02:56.430> wrap

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.300 

that<00:02:59.760> was<00:02:59.970> congratulations<00:03:00.900> you<00:03:01.170> lucky<00:03:02.100> man

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
that was congratulations you lucky man

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:10.470 
that was congratulations you lucky man
who<00:03:02.520> bought<00:03:02.700> that<00:03:02.910> custom<00:03:03.360> speaker<00:03:04.970> fantastic

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.330 

and<00:03:10.900> after<00:03:11.260> that<00:03:11.440> they'll<00:03:11.680> measure<00:03:12.010> each

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
and after that they'll measure each

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.820 
and after that they'll measure each
driver<00:03:12.760> individually<00:03:13.720> mmm

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
driver individually mmm

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.309 
driver individually mmm
just<00:03:15.459> in<00:03:15.670> case<00:03:15.849> if<00:03:16.150> one<00:03:16.450> of<00:03:16.569> the<00:03:16.690> drivers<00:03:17.080> has<00:03:17.290> a

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:17.319 
just in case if one of the drivers has a

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:19.740 
just in case if one of the drivers has a
problem<00:03:17.680> at<00:03:18.640> frequencies<00:03:19.269> where<00:03:19.480> the<00:03:19.510> other

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
problem at frequencies where the other

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.930 
problem at frequencies where the other
driver<00:03:20.110> plays<00:03:20.440> most<00:03:20.739> of<00:03:20.890> the<00:03:21.040> signal<00:03:21.430> we<00:03:21.670> still

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
driver plays most of the signal we still

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.460 
driver plays most of the signal we still
want<00:03:22.150> to<00:03:22.209> make<00:03:22.480> sure<00:03:22.510> that<00:03:22.930> we<00:03:23.080> see<00:03:23.349> any

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
want to make sure that we see any

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.229 
want to make sure that we see any
problem<00:03:23.950> like<00:03:24.129> that<00:03:24.160> until<00:03:24.730> now<00:03:24.879> all<00:03:25.090> they

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239 
problem like that until now all they

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:27.030 
problem like that until now all they
tested<00:03:25.629> was<00:03:25.810> the<00:03:25.959> overall<00:03:26.800> frequency

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
tested was the overall frequency

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.280 
tested was the overall frequency
response<00:03:27.700> and<00:03:27.940> face<00:03:28.120> now<00:03:28.900> they'll<00:03:29.110> measure

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
response and face now they'll measure

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:30.660 
response and face now they'll measure
impedance<00:03:29.830> and<00:03:30.010> then<00:03:30.099> each<00:03:30.310> driver

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
impedance and then each driver

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.370 
impedance and then each driver
individually<00:03:31.480> just<00:03:31.510> to<00:03:31.810> make<00:03:31.959> sure<00:03:32.110> there<00:03:32.290> are

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
individually just to make sure there are

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.290 
individually just to make sure there are
no<00:03:32.500> out<00:03:32.680> of<00:03:32.709> band<00:03:33.040> from<00:03:33.340> sexcellent

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300
