weaker<00:03:50.579> especially<00:03:51.000> at<00:03:51.120> this<00:03:51.269> point<00:03:51.569> over

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
weaker especially at this point over

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.500 
weaker especially at this point over
this<00:03:52.189> because<00:03:53.189> it<00:03:53.430> may<00:03:53.639> Bend<00:03:53.909> from<00:03:54.090> this

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
this because it may Bend from this

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.839 
this because it may Bend from this
particular<00:03:54.719> point<00:03:55.109> but<00:03:55.439> again<00:03:56.159> only<00:03:56.400> if<00:03:56.730> you

00:03:56.839 --> 00:03:56.849 
particular point but again only if you

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:58.759 
particular point but again only if you
apply<00:03:57.150> certain<00:03:57.569> more<00:03:57.959> amount<00:03:58.260> of<00:03:58.379> pressure<00:03:58.590> on

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
apply certain more amount of pressure on

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:00.080 
apply certain more amount of pressure on
the<00:03:58.919> iPhone<00:03:59.220> six-plus<00:03:59.579> then<00:03:59.760> only<00:03:59.909> it<00:04:00.060> will

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
the iPhone six-plus then only it will

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.720 
the iPhone six-plus then only it will
