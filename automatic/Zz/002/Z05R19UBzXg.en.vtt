00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
think it's cute I mean it's cute

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.900 
think it's cute I mean it's cute
I<00:03:19.720> like<00:03:20.170> it<00:03:20.500> and<00:03:21.150> I<00:03:23.130> guess<00:03:24.130> you<00:03:24.340> can<00:03:24.549> you<00:03:24.760> know

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
I like it and I guess you can you know

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.500 
I like it and I guess you can you know
just<00:03:25.920> flip<00:03:26.920> it<00:03:27.070> over<00:03:27.250> and<00:03:27.790> just<00:03:27.820> have<00:03:28.000> it<00:03:28.150> look

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
just flip it over and just have it look

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.640 
just flip it over and just have it look
like<00:03:28.720> a<00:03:28.750> regular<00:03:29.530> little<00:03:30.040> shortcut<00:03:31.320> it<00:03:32.320> does

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
like a regular little shortcut it does

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.110 
like a regular little shortcut it does
have<00:03:32.980> this<00:03:33.220> wavy<00:03:34.209> type<00:03:34.630> thing<00:03:34.959> going<00:03:34.989> on<00:03:35.590> in<00:03:35.920> it

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
have this wavy type thing going on in it

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.910 
have this wavy type thing going on in it
so<00:03:37.120> I<00:03:37.150> guess<00:03:37.540> that<00:03:37.840> gives<00:03:38.140> it<00:03:38.380> more<00:03:38.709> if<00:03:38.890> I'm<00:03:39.130> a

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
so I guess that gives it more if I'm a

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.720 
so I guess that gives it more if I'm a
natural<00:03:41.920> type<00:03:42.160> look<00:03:44.160> that's<00:03:45.160> it<00:03:45.370> from<00:03:45.579> the
