00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.620
 dry asphalt puddle sand 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:44.800
 dividing lines can knock it off 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.360
 the way about jacque and throw out of the saddle 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.550
 repairing a tattoo motorcycle is expensive and 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:53.140
 long just to change

 candles need to disassemble the floor of the car 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:24.520
 but 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:26.919
 enduro bike because of the big wheels 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:29.080
 high suspension and thinness is similar to 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:31.690
 bike he maneuvers easily between 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:37.330
 cars deftly jumping over bumps and 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:39.270
 forces ditches on any motorcycle 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:42.490
 move off the asphalt big problem 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:44.199
 a very big problem rubber is not 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.300
 designed to move on the coffin 

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:48.720
 committed nur allow you to move to 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.720
 loud 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:55.860
 for a beginner such a machine too 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:58.290
 capricious and tries to screw up 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.420
 order the front wheel as they say 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:03.380
 motorcyclists and reset unaccustomed to 

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:03.380
 trick herself 

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:19.970
 hardy heavy motorcycle 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:22.270
 classic type able to ride in 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:24.110
 for decades 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:27.790
 landing him lower 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:30.620
 bolus wider engine when worn 

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:33.560
 the chassis is already quite tough 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:37.630
 to take turns certainly does 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:42.090
 on sportbike but close machine 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:44.440
 and lack of facing fairing 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:47.410
 making them more suitable and repair 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:49.480
 convenient classic service 

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:51.340
 machines washed side and wag and 

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:53.530
 world view to reset on his mark 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:06:06.460
 it is only necessary that the engine volume was not 

00:05:53.530 --> 00:06:09.280
 more than 400 cubic centimeters ride 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:10.240
 comfortably feet brought forward housing 

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:13.030
 lay back 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:15.280
 super heavy u solid slow 

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:17.440
 more than a hundred kilometers an hour squeeze out 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:20.290
 of course he can but then the rider 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:22.960
 just blow away the badge first usually drive 

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:23.890
 right cool don't turn the speakers don't 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:26.170
 overclock 

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:29.530
 they don't allow control on 

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:31.810
 We show them difficult power 

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:34.180
 the engine is also not too great but 

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:36.880
 it is possible to go very well not 

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:40.270
