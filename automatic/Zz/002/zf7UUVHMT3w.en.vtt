00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:20.449
 rowe via the sweetener of origin 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:25.099
 natural without calories extracted from 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:29.599
 stevia leaves potato puree chips 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:33.230
 of fried potatoes with little icing sugar 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:38.480
 soft sweet butter a stick a berry 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:44.780
 vanilla reduced white marsala wine 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:47.750
 egg yolk and raspberry compote for 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:51.260
 the mashed potatoes we cooked 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:53.329
 potatoes with peel in the oven under a 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.949
 bed of coarse salt 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:57.859
 we totally peeled them there 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:59.769
 we have pressed and this is the result 

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:04.040
 naturally it is slightly warm 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:05.720
 let's add some butter in this too 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.550
 case the butter must be at temperature 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.650
 environment 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:12.460
 so you see creamy that will go to give 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:15.610
 the scent of milk product to all the sweet 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.610
 the other way 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:34.259
 mangum I call the crew butter away e 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:36.829
 to the potato we can take the berry 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:42.020
 vanilla and do this 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:49.049
 crush it with the knife blade 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:53.549
 gently cut it in half and with 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:55.770
 the tip of the knife between slave that 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:59.939
 we see all the vanilla spots that 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.560
 it has the natural scent of vanilla 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.270
 the scent of the handle also remains 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.909
 on the boat then a suggestion that 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.910
 I can give you is to dry the 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:12.299
 vanilla bean therefore devoid of seeds 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:14.819
 but still very fragrant if carla 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:16.530
 totally then whisk it you will get one 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.360
 dust and this dust you can 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.620
 use it to make a shortcrust pastry 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.769
 sponge cake to any other 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.810
 type of cake where it can be 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:26.310
 required the scent of vanilla I say 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.900
 another thing could be 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.180
 also used this powder for a 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.310
 meat dish or vegetable dish 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.220
 see that there is a black part in this 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.380
 potato are precisely these dots of 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:41.060
 vanilla that should be diluted 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.060
 gently with the mashed potatoes 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:50.220
 see also the butter is slowly coming up 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:51.750
 mixing and you can see that also the 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.280
 potato is one of the ingredients 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.079
 main for the kitchen can be 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.639
 transformed into an equally 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:58.920
 important ingredient for the 

00:02:56.639 --> 00:03:02.459
 pastry precisely because it has a scent 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:05.310
 and has a very very neutral taste 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:10.319
 I would always say to taste this is 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:13.319
 the habit of the cook and I can say that 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:19.489
 let's add more 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:22.620
 a little away is the scent of vanilla 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:25.349
 I certainly feel the taste of the potato 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.719
 and the sweet liter that away is a lot 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:30.239
 delicate and above all very much 

00:03:27.719 --> 00:03:33.950
 important for a good pastry 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:37.379
 also the fact that there are zero calories 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:49.019
 as well as being natural, we add 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:58.109
 the egg yolks marsala this is a 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:04:01.019
 classic white wine zabaglione e 

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:03.439
 of course we're going to sweeten with 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:03.439
 the other way 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:14.069
 now it passes from alessandro that 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:14.069
 will begin to mount it in a bain-marie 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:21.270
 continue sugar have slightly 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:24.160
 potatoes these are potato chips 

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:28.570
 cut very thin raw and then the 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:30.310
 fried this will serve to give the 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:32.470
 crunchy to the whole dish that also 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:37.150
 here will be a will have a softness will have a 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:42.910
 cross between soft, sweet crunchy 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:49.060
 salty basic acid ok alessandro 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:51.280
 meanwhile the perfect young woman has finished 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.550
 we have our mashed potatoes 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:57.970
 this is also a dish we will go to 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:05:01.050
 in an irregular manner to place a bit of 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:04.660
 this fury of potatoes a part of 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:10.210
 slightly sour raspberry compote 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:12.610
 the eggnog you see this consistency 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:18.460
 it is the real consistency with the true 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:22.409
 zabaglione so very airy and 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:24.970
 we complete with potato chips 

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:28.139
 Crisp 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:28.139
 just the finished dish
