00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.730
 commissioning in 1993 the line to 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.770
 high speed north which connects paris to 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.349
 Since the beginning of the year, Lille has been 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.940
 important regeneration site on 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.009
 renewal of ballast and rails 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.900
 expected over six years fits into the 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.150
 framework of the major modernization plan 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.279
 network engaged since 2008 at 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.510
 national our rail network has 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.210
 aged is normal 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.279
 it was built a long time ago and 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.900
 we have to ensure 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.349
 upgrade renewal of 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.630
 modernization on lgv on the network 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.620
 classic and has aged a lot 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:37.079
 especially in the densest areas 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.219
 where it is very used and so we 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.340
 have a big modernization plan 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.809
 has big elements the 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.059
 equipment renewal 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.649
 age and modernization for 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.600
 improve network performance 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.579
 it's a program that will be spread out 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.440
 very many years and who is 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.300
 mobilizes a lot of resources 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.969
 many a lot of railwaymen 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.090
 a lot of companies it's a job 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.090
 equipped with 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:04.309
 on the lgv north 280 km of lanes will be 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.200
 processed from 2015 to 2021 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.120
 an annual investment between 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.130
 40 and 70 million euros 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:13.430
 it's really an opportunity to have a 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:16.370
 completely new line renovated when 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.800
 the aged voice she moves the rail moves 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:20.600
 and then when it's new you have to 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.180
 again a perfectly straight voice 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.920
 perfectly aligned you feel it in 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.110
 terms of comfort in terms of 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.420
 speed regularity for the train 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.190
 every night it's thirty agents who 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.320
 renew more than 900 meters of track 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.990
 thanks to a unique machine in France 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:39.020
 the tram will have it's a train that allows 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.540
 to replace the rail and weld it 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.880
 like in a factory that is to say that the 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.619
 welding technique and therefore welding 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.380
 by electric induction 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:50.900
 this technique allows us to have a 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.360
 high yield of 300 to 400 m eur 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.740
 multifunctional work train the 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.690
 boa train realizes in one 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.360
 delivering the unloading of the rails 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.250
 new their welding the substitution of 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.900
 rails and fastener and the pickup of 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.860
 old rails 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.600
 all the work is done from 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.820
 night for a lesser disturbance of the 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.830
 rail traffic on the tgv line 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.429
 paris lille there is no tgv that 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.019
 move at night 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.250
 it allows us at first to 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:14.810
 work safely and 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.290
 to ensure a good performance at the level of 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.030
 the production 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.920
 second, the fact of 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.980
 working at night removes it no tgv 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.590
 in the daily traffic for this 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.510
 site we limit the 370 km hour 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.670
 on a 10 km stretch 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.870
 this lengthens the travel time of 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.269
 trains of only ten minutes 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.950
 end of July the first 26 kilometers 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:36.470
 new rails will have been laid between 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.940
 let's go back and chauny the yard 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.100
 will move every year to go up 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:44.200
 gradually to the island at the rate of 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.200
 25 to 35 kilometers per year
