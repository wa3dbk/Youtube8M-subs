00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.519
 we'll just say that bah in 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:13.500
 do it's rather the 10th edition of the wharf 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.150
 54 which is different from 10 years of the 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.130
 wharf 54 is known that in any case a 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.150
 event that endures for ten 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.470
 years it means that it is good when 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.850
 even a certain resonance this year 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.109
 This is true even when passing or 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.130
 still in another sphere I think 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.480
 that we still really put our 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.859
 hearts with our soul in this event 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.480
 and I think that's also what makes 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:31.349
 that we are here we always 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.210
 actually tried to raise the level 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.260
 of the event each year the pride 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.320
 For us, this event is 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.940
 really that the interaction is not the 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.010
 stars on one side and the audience watching 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.760
 it's the audience he's as star as 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.760
 the stars who are on the ground 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:53.940
 how i remember added at the beginning h 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:56.460
 30 we tend to start so I have 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.570
 given the evolution and it's nice to be 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.429
 there today 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.780
 in a symbolic way for them for 

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:03.109
 ten years is a good birthday 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.109
 today 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:48.300
 we can not dream of best 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.430
 under the eiffel tower and with the decor 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.790
 that there is around it really is very 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.790
 very high level 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:20.790
 this is the first time that Veneto and 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:23.580
 heard and there loose by then 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:27.500
 and that's more of the president council is 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.500
 here and it is also played 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.870
 modern it is there as good the wind he 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.710
 are a lot of public it bugue young 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.700
 it's the audience expecting others 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.700
 others absent but 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.320
 that this be handed over a lot of 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.600
 people and also people 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:54.460
 different and especially sarah bring back 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:57.190
 also a sport mode because we take a 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:59.650
 big shot whether it's for example I 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:02.370
 think it's basketball in France 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.370
 is not sufficiently publicized 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:40.250
 what can we play teammates is 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:42.530
 to pediment the respect there the right to 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:44.690
 to be able to chamber others is different 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:47.180
 thing another concept but it remains the 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:49.910
 same sport all that allows all these 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:52.090
 young people to be able to do things 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:52.090
 positive 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:05.040
 m 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.560
 and 

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:37.400
 music sport &amp; lifestyle 

00:05:52.340 --> 00:06:47.810
 but we would not say he has one or 

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:47.810
 thieves 

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:22.960
 because paris 

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:37.379
 Where it all began 

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:37.379
 I think it's
