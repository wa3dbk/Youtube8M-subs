00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:33.370 
all it out of there up inside here makes

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.180 
all it out of there up inside here makes
it<00:01:33.490> easier<00:01:33.820> for<00:01:33.880> the<00:01:34.090> sand<00:01:34.330> blaster<00:01:35.070> you<00:01:36.070> know

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.190 
it easier for the sand blaster you know

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.140 
it easier for the sand blaster you know
because<00:01:36.430> if<00:01:36.550> it's<00:01:36.730> if<00:01:36.910> it's<00:01:37.030> got<00:01:37.270> real<00:01:37.480> thick

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
because if it's if it's got real thick

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.730 
because if it's if it's got real thick
seam<00:01:40.150> sealer<00:01:40.390> in<00:01:40.600> there<00:01:40.780> it<00:01:40.930> won't<00:01:41.110> it<00:01:41.650> won't

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
seam sealer in there it won't it won't

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.440 
seam sealer in there it won't it won't
sandblast<00:01:42.310> very<00:01:42.520> well<00:01:42.700> so<00:01:42.910> it's<00:01:43.060> best<00:01:43.210> to<00:01:43.300> get

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
sandblast very well so it's best to get

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.450 
sandblast very well so it's best to get
that<00:01:43.600> out<00:01:43.780> of<00:01:43.810> the<00:01:43.930> way<00:01:44.250> makes<00:01:45.250> it<00:01:45.340> a<00:01:45.370> little

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
that out of the way makes it a little

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:51.540 
that out of the way makes it a little
easier<00:01:45.640> on<00:01:45.910> them<00:01:46.240> and<00:01:46.450> cheaper<00:01:46.720> on<00:01:46.870> me<00:01:48.480> so<00:01:50.550> it's

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:51.550 
easier on them and cheaper on me so it's

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:52.920 
easier on them and cheaper on me so it's
about<00:01:51.730> ready<00:01:52.000> I<00:01:52.120> think<00:01:52.180> I'm<00:01:52.420> going<00:01:52.540> to<00:01:52.600> do<00:01:52.720> some

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:57.160 
before I take it over there that way

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.010 
before I take it over there that way
when<00:01:57.340> I<00:01:57.370> bring<00:01:57.610> it<00:01:57.730> back<00:01:57.760> that<00:01:58.390> that<00:01:58.720> parts

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
when I bring it back that that parts

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.290 
when I bring it back that that parts
done<00:01:59.080> to<00:01:59.500> where<00:01:59.620> when<00:01:59.830> I<00:01:59.860> put<00:02:00.760> some<00:02:00.910> epoxy

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.300 
done to where when I put some epoxy

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.460 
done to where when I put some epoxy
primer<00:02:01.600> on<00:02:01.870> it<00:02:02.020> it's<00:02:02.230> it's<00:02:02.530> done<00:02:02.920> in<00:02:03.160> that<00:02:03.280> area

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470 
primer on it it's it's done in that area

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.169 
primer on it it's it's done in that area
so

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.569 

that's<00:02:09.179> where<00:02:09.360> we're<00:02:09.539> at
