00:00:15.409 --> 00:00:18.050
 the staff do not remember Inca cancer 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.050
 I'm a drummer and the drum musician and teacher 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:24.949
 in partnership with the alpha project ministry 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:28.470
 we create donald case sharing and music 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.809
 and we'll be bringing in several educational music videos aimed at 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.020
 for the battery to prevent it from initially for double bass 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.870
 in this first child we will plot 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.370
 important parts of the police battery more fundamental a 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.130
 instrument 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:52.330
 the main parts the posture and the first rhythm 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.250
 giving start I want to show something called rhythmic trio 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.590
 the Gaucho technician of the world very good 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.080
 the edu box arrived 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.210
 these three pieces we play all the rhythms 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.729
 are also three very important fundamental parts of the battery 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.470
 let's get into the rhythm let's talk about the posture 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.050
 one very important thing is the position of the pedals 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.440
 I never stepped forward 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:23.470
 too much 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.600
 neither far behind of interesting is in the middle 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:32.310
 Something else I have never felt totally from the halfway aware park 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.430
 another interesting point always leaves with a sledgehammer 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.210
 besides giving you more comfort will make me have your inspiration be 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:42.900
 more natural 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.700
 another thing for right-hand men we're going to adopt the right hand position 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.650
 muchiba al touched over the box goes through 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.400
 the left hand will stay 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.930
 touching the box 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.100
 we returned to the mission first rhythm 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.290
 in the first pique we'll see the first part of rock 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.060
 is done as follows 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.480
 you will touch 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.880
 shane bauer and butt 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.880
 Then you got home. 

00:02:11.679 --> 00:02:13.339
 after this show 

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:16.339
 a repeat sequence 

00:02:25.529 --> 00:02:28.899
 another very important point all political decision maker 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:35.269
 at the time you were learning it's interesting you play something this gives 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:36.859
 a very correct way 

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:41.209
 after mastering the exercise you can accelerate how I will show this 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.209
 example now 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:59.040
 let's tighten with the second example we will talk show host go this 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.040
 form 

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:19.189
 now fast 

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:32.699
 the staff hope you like it 

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:37.259
 we will from silk to continue continuity to several examples 

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.999
 Bless us all.
