00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.690 

so<00:00:01.140> let's<00:00:01.290> now<00:00:01.469> consider<00:00:01.770> the<00:00:01.979> processes<00:00:02.550> by

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
so let's now consider the processes by

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.300 
so let's now consider the processes by
which<00:00:02.730> molecules<00:00:03.480> cross<00:00:03.780> membranes<00:00:04.170> this<00:00:05.130> is

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
which molecules cross membranes this is

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.700 
which molecules cross membranes this is
diffusion<00:00:05.759> osmosis<00:00:06.060> and<00:00:06.750> protein<00:00:07.170> mediated

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
diffusion osmosis and protein mediated

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.799 
diffusion osmosis and protein mediated
transport<00:00:08.090> first<00:00:09.090> off<00:00:09.330> we'll<00:00:09.480> consider

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
transport first off we'll consider

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.919 
transport first off we'll consider
diffusion<00:00:11.240> what<00:00:12.240> would<00:00:12.360> happen<00:00:12.570> if<00:00:12.690> I<00:00:12.750> was<00:00:12.840> to

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
diffusion what would happen if I was to

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.810 
diffusion what would happen if I was to
drop<00:00:13.139> a<00:00:13.320> drop<00:00:13.530> of<00:00:13.559> dye<00:00:13.799> into<00:00:14.099> this<00:00:14.219> glass<00:00:14.429> water

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
drop a drop of dye into this glass water

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.910 
drop a drop of dye into this glass water
here<00:00:15.089> if<00:00:16.080> you<00:00:16.170> could<00:00:16.289> all<00:00:16.440> hang<00:00:16.650> out<00:00:16.710> in<00:00:16.859> the

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
here if you could all hang out in the

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.010 
here if you could all hang out in the
one<00:00:17.039> area<00:00:17.070> once<00:00:17.730> I<00:00:17.820> dropped<00:00:18.060> it<00:00:18.180> in<00:00:18.270> or<00:00:18.840> to

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
one area once I dropped it in or to

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.510 
one area once I dropped it in or to
begin<00:00:19.170> to<00:00:19.350> spread<00:00:19.619> throughout<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.340> vast

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
begin to spread throughout the vast

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.660 
begin to spread throughout the vast
until<00:00:20.910> it<00:00:21.000> was<00:00:21.119> eventually<00:00:21.359> evenly<00:00:22.199> spread

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:22.670 
until it was eventually evenly spread

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.029 
until it was eventually evenly spread
now<00:00:23.670> think<00:00:23.880> you<00:00:23.910> know<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.210> answer<00:00:24.510> to<00:00:24.600> this

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:25.039 
now think you know the answer to this

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:27.589 
now think you know the answer to this
what<00:00:26.039> will<00:00:26.160> happen<00:00:26.490> is<00:00:26.880> it<00:00:27.060> will<00:00:27.150> start<00:00:27.449> out

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
what will happen is it will start out

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.750 
what will happen is it will start out
from<00:00:27.779> an<00:00:27.840> area<00:00:28.140> of<00:00:28.170> high<00:00:28.349> concentration<00:00:28.760> and

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
from an area of high concentration and

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.609 
from an area of high concentration and
move<00:00:29.970> to<00:00:30.179> an<00:00:30.269> area<00:00:30.539> of<00:00:30.630> low<00:00:30.720> concentration<00:00:30.750> as

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
move to an area of low concentration as

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.370 
move to an area of low concentration as
it<00:00:31.710> spreads<00:00:32.130> out<00:00:32.369> throughout<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:33.090> box<00:00:33.390> to

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
it spreads out throughout the box to

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.830 
it spreads out throughout the box to
become<00:00:34.649> like<00:00:34.829> this<00:00:35.120> this<00:00:36.120> is<00:00:36.239> what<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.510> fusion

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
become like this this is what the fusion

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.590 
become like this this is what the fusion
is<00:00:36.960> it's<00:00:37.440> a<00:00:37.559> movement<00:00:37.800> of<00:00:38.790> molecules<00:00:39.000> from<00:00:39.420> an

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
is it's a movement of molecules from an

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.810 
is it's a movement of molecules from an
area<00:00:39.809> of<00:00:39.870> high<00:00:40.050> concentration<00:00:40.079> to<00:00:40.860> an<00:00:41.430> area<00:00:41.579> of

area of high concentration to an area of
low<00:00:42.000> concentration<00:00:42.980> this<00:00:43.980> is<00:00:44.160> a<00:00:44.190> way<00:00:44.430> that

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
low concentration this is a way that

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.819 
low concentration this is a way that
some<00:00:45.450> molecules<00:00:45.930> will<00:00:46.140> move<00:00:46.170> across<00:00:46.530> the

gonna have to get you used to here's a
term<00:01:08.140> of<00:01:08.290> a<00:01:08.380> solute<00:01:08.799> but<00:01:09.280> solute<00:01:09.640> is<00:01:09.790> something

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:10.119 
term of a solute but solute is something

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:11.640

which is dissolved in water something

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:13.890 
which is dissolved in water something
like<00:01:11.740> salt<00:01:12.159> or<00:01:12.369> sugar<00:01:12.400> and<00:01:12.880> the<00:01:13.600> way<00:01:13.720> which

what you may realize with this is just a

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:33.419 
what you may realize with this is just a
reworded<00:01:31.440> definition<00:01:32.440> of<00:01:32.740> what<00:01:32.920> diffusion

have<00:01:49.569> a<00:01:49.600> high<00:01:49.840> mana<00:01:50.080> so<00:01:50.289> you'd<00:01:50.440> say<00:01:50.679> 99<00:01:51.369> bits

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
have a high mana so you'd say 99 bits

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.029 
have a high mana so you'd say 99 bits
we'd<00:01:52.479> have<00:01:52.600> a<00:01:52.630> low<00:01:52.810> amount<00:01:52.899> of<00:01:53.170> water<00:01:53.350> say<00:01:53.800> one

00:01:54.029 --> 00:01:54.039 
we'd have a low amount of water say one

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:56.010 
we'd have a low amount of water say one
so<00:01:54.280> it's<00:01:54.399> still<00:01:54.550> moving<00:01:54.789> from<00:01:54.909> there<00:01:55.119> high

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
so it's still moving from there high

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.590 
so it's still moving from there high
water<00:01:56.890> concentration<00:01:57.130> area<00:01:57.940> but<00:01:58.090> low<00:01:58.300> water

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
water concentration area but low water

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.770 
water concentration area but low water
concentration<00:01:59.700> so<00:02:00.700> it's<00:02:00.819> just<00:02:01.000> a<00:02:01.149> reworded

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
concentration so it's just a reworded

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.530 
concentration so it's just a reworded

is<00:02:06.939> going<00:02:07.090> to<00:02:07.149> move<00:02:07.440> now<00:02:08.440> the<00:02:08.500> way<00:02:08.709> that<00:02:08.860> I<00:02:08.979> work

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
is going to move now the way that I work

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.080 
is going to move now the way that I work
out<00:02:09.489> which<00:02:10.090> my<00:02:10.390> water<00:02:10.810> will<00:02:11.079> move<00:02:11.790> with<00:02:12.790> the

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
out which my water will move with the

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.810 
out which my water will move with the
solutes<00:02:13.570> is<00:02:14.049> like<00:02:14.290> this<00:02:14.470> my<00:02:15.010> oil<00:02:15.220> lawyers<00:02:15.640> now

solutes is like this my oil lawyers now

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.280 
solutes is like this my oil lawyers now
actually<00:02:16.209> get<00:02:16.360> used<00:02:16.510> to<00:02:16.660> using<00:02:16.780> this<00:02:17.049> fish

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
actually get used to using this fish

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.979 
actually get used to using this fish
example<00:02:17.860> I<00:02:18.180> give<00:02:19.180> you<00:02:19.269> an<00:02:19.329> example<00:02:19.420> of<00:02:19.840> what<00:02:19.959> I

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
example I give you an example of what I

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:21.360 
example I give you an example of what I
mean<00:02:20.170> with<00:02:20.260> it's<00:02:20.410> a<00:02:20.500> perpetual<00:02:20.829> question

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
mean with it's a perpetual question

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.400 
mean with it's a perpetual question
which<00:02:21.459> is<00:02:21.610> plagued<00:02:21.880> mankind<00:02:22.090> forever<00:02:22.630> why

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
which is plagued mankind forever why

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.110 
which is plagued mankind forever why
have<00:02:23.650> you<00:02:23.739> put<00:02:23.920> a<00:02:23.980> freshwater<00:02:24.489> fish<00:02:24.730> in<00:02:24.760> salt

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
have you put a freshwater fish in salt

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.180 
have you put a freshwater fish in salt
water<00:02:25.180> does<00:02:25.930> the<00:02:25.959> freshwater<00:02:26.590> fish<00:02:26.829> not<00:02:27.010> like

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
water does the freshwater fish not like

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.670 
water does the freshwater fish not like
it<00:02:27.340> very<00:02:27.459> much<00:02:27.609> and<00:02:27.730> this<00:02:27.910> is<00:02:27.970> why<00:02:28.239> well<00:02:29.200> in

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
it very much and this is why well in

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.470 
it very much and this is why well in
salt<00:02:30.040> water<00:02:30.100> there's<00:02:30.549> a<00:02:30.579> high<00:02:30.820> amount<00:02:31.090> of<00:02:31.209> salt

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
salt water there's a high amount of salt

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.830 
salt water there's a high amount of salt
and<00:02:31.980> a<00:02:32.980> relatively<00:02:33.760> lower<00:02:34.120> amount<00:02:34.510> of<00:02:34.630> water

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
and a relatively lower amount of water

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.620 
and a relatively lower amount of water
okay<00:02:35.590> compared<00:02:36.220> to<00:02:36.400> the<00:02:36.850> freshwater<00:02:37.359> fish

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
okay compared to the freshwater fish

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.740 
okay compared to the freshwater fish
which<00:02:37.959> has<00:02:38.170> a<00:02:38.410> lower<00:02:38.920> amount<00:02:39.100> of<00:02:39.400> salt<00:02:39.670> yet<00:02:40.480> a

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
which has a lower amount of salt yet a

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.920 
which has a lower amount of salt yet a
higher<00:02:41.470> amount<00:02:41.590> of<00:02:41.859> water<00:02:42.329> so<00:02:43.329> if<00:02:43.540> we<00:02:43.660> look<00:02:43.870> at

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
higher amount of water so if we look at

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.449 
higher amount of water so if we look at
either<00:02:44.140> definition<00:02:44.769> we<00:02:44.859> can<00:02:44.890> use<00:02:45.160> here<00:02:45.340> we<00:02:45.370> are

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
either definition we can use here we are

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:47.910 
either definition we can use here we are
thinking<00:02:45.820> if<00:02:45.970> from<00:02:46.090> a<00:02:46.180> low<00:02:46.329> sea<00:02:46.600> to<00:02:46.930> a<00:02:47.200> high

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
thinking if from a low sea to a high

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.530 
thinking if from a low sea to a high
sand<00:02:48.220> water<00:02:48.310> moves<00:02:48.609> from<00:02:48.700> either<00:02:48.940> a<00:02:49.030> low<00:02:49.269> sweet

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540

either way what we can see or we as the
solute<00:02:59.400> the

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680

fish<00:03:01.250> itself<00:03:01.580> has<00:03:01.760> a<00:03:01.790> lower<00:03:02.000> size<00:03:02.269> of<00:03:02.599> waters

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
fish itself has a lower size of waters

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:04.360 
fish itself has a lower size of waters
and<00:03:03.200> it's<00:03:03.290> going<00:03:03.410> to<00:03:03.500> move<00:03:03.620> towards<00:03:04.099> the

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
and it's going to move towards the

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.040 
and it's going to move towards the
saltwater<00:03:04.670> so<00:03:05.030> it's<00:03:05.150> gonna<00:03:05.269> move<00:03:05.480> out<00:03:05.720> waters

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.050 
saltwater so it's gonna move out waters

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:07.509 
saltwater so it's gonna move out waters
going<00:03:06.170> to<00:03:06.290> move<00:03:06.440> out<00:03:06.590> of<00:03:06.620> this<00:03:06.830> fish<00:03:07.010> this<00:03:07.459> fish

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 
going to move out of this fish this fish

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:09.360 
going to move out of this fish this fish
is<00:03:07.940> you<00:03:08.090> know<00:03:08.180> literally<00:03:08.480> have<00:03:08.750> it<00:03:08.840> cells

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
is you know literally have it cells

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.360 
is you know literally have it cells
dehydrate<00:03:10.370> if<00:03:11.150> it's<00:03:11.390> put<00:03:11.599> in<00:03:11.900> salt<00:03:12.200> water

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
dehydrate if it's put in salt water

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.690 
dehydrate if it's put in salt water
water<00:03:13.370> will<00:03:13.550> move<00:03:13.730> out<00:03:13.940> of<00:03:14.060> these<00:03:14.180> cells<00:03:14.480> you

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
water will move out of these cells you

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.550 
water will move out of these cells you
get<00:03:16.700> this<00:03:16.819> idea

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
get this idea

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.280 
get this idea
well.ok<00:03:18.560> through<00:03:19.310> the<00:03:19.430> opposite<00:03:20.170> what<00:03:21.170> are

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
well.ok through the opposite what are

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.110 
well.ok through the opposite what are
we're<00:03:21.410> to<00:03:21.530> get<00:03:21.680> a<00:03:21.709> saltwater<00:03:22.040> fish<00:03:22.280> and<00:03:22.819> we<00:03:22.940> put

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
we're to get a saltwater fish and we put

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.030 
we're to get a saltwater fish and we put
in<00:03:23.209> fresh<00:03:23.510> water<00:03:23.690> and<00:03:24.290> actually<00:03:24.440> things<00:03:24.860> gonna

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
in fresh water and actually things gonna

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.820 
in fresh water and actually things gonna
be<00:03:25.129> better<00:03:25.280> now<00:03:25.549> well<00:03:26.269> the<00:03:26.810> freshwater<00:03:27.140> itself

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:27.830 
be better now well the freshwater itself

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:32.500 
be better now well the freshwater itself
has<00:03:28.310> a<00:03:28.340> relatively<00:03:28.910> low<00:03:29.629> amount<00:03:30.140> of<00:03:30.260> salt<00:03:31.510> but

has a relatively low amount of salt but

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.750 
has a relatively low amount of salt but
it<00:03:32.660> has<00:03:32.840> a<00:03:33.079> high<00:03:33.319> amount<00:03:33.470> of<00:03:33.739> water<00:03:33.920> the<00:03:34.489> salt

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
it has a high amount of water the salt

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.780 
it has a high amount of water the salt
water<00:03:34.940> fish<00:03:35.239> has<00:03:36.019> a<00:03:36.079> high<00:03:36.410> amount<00:03:36.590> of<00:03:36.829> salt<00:03:37.099> but

shapes<00:05:05.500> from<00:05:05.680> it's<00:05:05.860> a<00:05:05.919> great<00:05:06.129> analogy<00:05:06.340> to

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:06.669 
shapes from it's a great analogy to

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:10.860 
shapes from it's a great analogy to
think<00:05:06.879> of<00:05:07.060> so<00:05:07.930> these<00:05:08.080> are<00:05:08.349> specific

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:10.870

the major difference between these types
of<00:05:13.300> our<00:05:13.710> transport<00:05:14.710> it's<00:05:15.160> very<00:05:15.610> very<00:05:15.880> simple

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:16.450 
of our transport it's very very simple

active<00:05:17.380> transport<00:05:17.410> actually<00:05:18.100> requires

active transport actually requires
energy<00:05:18.669> facilitated<00:05:19.570> diffusion<00:05:19.660> doesn't
