00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.249 
that's what it's best used to do with
two<00:01:47.310> so<00:01:47.549> then<00:01:47.670> you<00:01:47.820> dole<00:01:48.000> you<00:01:48.720> know<00:01:48.840> put<00:01:49.049> 10<00:01:49.229> on

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
two so then you dole you know put 10 on

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.010 
two so then you dole you know put 10 on
the<00:01:49.439> trade<00:01:49.649> boil<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.100> then<00:01:50.130> all<00:01:50.280> of<00:01:50.310> this

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
the trade boil and then all of this

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.340 
the trade boil and then all of this
to<00:01:51.710> do<00:01:51.829> alone<00:01:52.130> I<00:01:52.840> don't<00:01:53.840> know<00:01:53.899> why<00:01:54.020> you<00:01:54.079> have<00:01:54.229> to

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
to do alone I don't know why you have to

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.109 
to do alone I don't know why you have to
use<00:01:54.500> all<00:01:54.679> of<00:01:54.829> them<00:01:54.950> Eva<00:01:55.130> sometimes<00:01:55.670> you<00:01:55.969> know

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
use all of them Eva sometimes you know

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:58.179 
use all of them Eva sometimes you know
you<00:01:56.780> just<00:01:56.899> have<00:01:57.020> to<00:01:57.200> put<00:01:57.320> every<00:01:57.590> single<00:01:57.740> one<00:01:58.039> on

00:01:58.179 --> 00:01:58.189 
you just have to put every single one on

00:01:58.189 --> 00:01:59.919
