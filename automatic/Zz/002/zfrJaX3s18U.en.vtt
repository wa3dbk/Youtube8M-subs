as<00:00:32.130> you<00:00:32.250> can<00:00:32.369> see<00:00:32.550> it's<00:00:33.030> applying<00:00:33.860> teat<00:00:34.860> dip

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
as you can see it's applying teat dip

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.520 
as you can see it's applying teat dip
after<00:00:35.610> that<00:00:36.030> after<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.540> cows<00:00:36.719> milk<00:00:37.170> this

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
after that after the cows milk this

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.350 
after that after the cows milk this
system<00:00:37.770> will<00:00:38.070> apply<00:00:38.309> teat<00:00:38.610> dip<00:00:40.219> automatically

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.360 
system will apply teat dip automatically

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.639 
system will apply teat dip automatically
consistently<00:00:42.360> and<00:00:42.780> regularly<00:00:42.930> with<00:00:43.500> your

consistently and regularly with your

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.790 
consistently and regularly with your
cows<00:00:43.800> as<00:00:44.010> they<00:00:44.129> come<00:00:44.309> through<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.550> system<00:00:44.850> so

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
cows as they come through the system so

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.680 
cows as they come through the system so
the<00:00:46.800> idea<00:00:46.829> here<00:00:47.160> is<00:00:47.370> that<00:00:47.489> it<00:00:47.820> removes<00:00:48.450> the

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
the idea here is that it removes the

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.300 
the idea here is that it removes the
labor<00:00:51.690> involved

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.380 
blew him away well we when we set up
last<00:02:21.489> weekend<00:02:21.970> we<00:02:22.150> did<00:02:23.730> want<00:02:24.730> to<00:02:24.849> cover<00:02:25.030> it<00:02:25.239> up

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
last weekend we did want to cover it up

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.390 
last weekend we did want to cover it up
because<00:02:25.599> it<00:02:25.870> was<00:02:26.049> just<00:02:26.079> it<00:02:26.530> was<00:02:26.560> brand-new<00:02:27.129> we

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
because it was just it was brand-new we

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.130 
because it was just it was brand-new we
didn't<00:02:27.610> want<00:02:27.790> to<00:02:27.879> tip<00:02:28.090> our<00:02:28.269> hand<00:02:28.540> to<00:02:28.690> anybody

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.800 
didn't want to tip our hand to anybody

yeah<00:02:55.080> my<00:02:55.680> answer<00:02:55.890> that<00:02:56.070> is<00:02:56.220> yes<00:02:57.350> we<00:02:58.350> don't<00:02:58.500> have

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.740 
yeah my answer that is yes we don't have

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.740 
yeah my answer that is yes we don't have
a<00:02:58.770> real<00:02:59.130> hard<00:02:59.400> time<00:02:59.550> line<00:03:00.060> yet<00:03:00.330> we<00:03:00.540> really

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
a real hard time line yet we really

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.240 
a real hard time line yet we really
can't<00:03:00.990> commit<00:03:01.200> to<00:03:01.260> that<00:03:01.470> knowing<00:03:01.860> that

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
can't commit to that knowing that

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.810 
can't commit to that knowing that
testing<00:03:02.850> itself<00:03:03.180> is<00:03:03.420> is<00:03:04.200> the<00:03:04.410> process<00:03:04.950> we're

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
testing itself is is the process we're

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.520 
testing itself is is the process we're
we're<00:03:06.270> getting<00:03:06.600> we're<00:03:07.050> coming<00:03:07.290> to<00:03:07.350> market

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
we're getting we're coming to market

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.260 
we're getting we're coming to market
with<00:03:07.709> this<00:03:07.890> just<00:03:08.100> as<00:03:08.220> quickly<00:03:08.520> as<00:03:08.880> we<00:03:09.120> can

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
with this just as quickly as we can

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:13.479 
with this just as quickly as we can
possibly<00:03:09.330> come<00:03:11.480> how<00:03:12.480> much<00:03:12.660> is<00:03:12.840> gonna<00:03:12.930> cause

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
possibly come how much is gonna cause

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:17.780 
possibly come how much is gonna cause
that's<00:03:14.489> also<00:03:14.850> a<00:03:14.880> yes<00:03:15.530> but<00:03:16.530> consider<00:03:17.430> the<00:03:17.580> fact

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
that's also a yes but consider the fact

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.530 
that's also a yes but consider the fact
that<00:03:17.910> if<00:03:18.390> you<00:03:18.570> have<00:03:18.890> three<00:03:19.890> people<00:03:20.730> doing<00:03:21.420> this

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
that if you have three people doing this

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.520 
that if you have three people doing this
operation<00:03:22.520> on<00:03:23.520> a<00:03:23.580> rotary<00:03:23.910> on<00:03:24.330> a<00:03:24.390> 24-hour<00:03:25.080> Rory

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
operation on a rotary on a 24-hour Rory

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.880 
operation on a rotary on a 24-hour Rory
a<00:03:25.560> full<00:03:25.860> commercial<00:03:26.190> scale<00:03:26.580> rotary<00:03:27.709> you<00:03:28.709> will

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
a full commercial scale rotary you will

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.490 
a full commercial scale rotary you will
pay<00:03:29.100> them<00:03:29.310> in<00:03:29.459> each<00:03:29.700> at<00:03:30.030> least<00:03:30.410> 30,000<00:03:31.410> a<00:03:31.470> year

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
pay them in each at least 30,000 a year

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.000 
pay them in each at least 30,000 a year
so<00:03:32.160> you'd<00:03:32.340> probably<00:03:32.700> have<00:03:33.060> a<00:03:33.120> labor<00:03:33.480> costs<00:03:34.010> all

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
so you'd probably have a labor costs all

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.650 
so you'd probably have a labor costs all
in<00:03:35.310> of<00:03:35.489> at<00:03:35.610> least<00:03:35.790> a<00:03:35.970> hundred<00:03:36.120> thousand

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
in of at least a hundred thousand

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.290 
in of at least a hundred thousand
dollars<00:03:36.690> for<00:03:37.110> three<00:03:37.290> people<00:03:37.850> so<00:03:38.850> if<00:03:38.970> you<00:03:39.120> can

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
dollars for three people so if you can

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.860 
dollars for three people so if you can
get<00:03:39.450> a<00:03:39.480> payback<00:03:39.750> on<00:03:40.260> this<00:03:41.160> in<00:03:41.430> maybe<00:03:42.000> two<00:03:42.840> years

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
get a payback on this in maybe two years

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.400 
get a payback on this in maybe two years
or<00:03:43.320> less<00:03:43.640> that's<00:03:44.640> what<00:03:44.790> we're<00:03:44.940> looking<00:03:45.269> at<00:03:45.420> and

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
or less that's what we're looking at and

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.150 
or less that's what we're looking at and
I<00:03:46.860> think<00:03:46.920> that<00:03:47.130> was

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
I think that was

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.000 
I think that was
fill<00:03:48.640> that<00:03:48.790> gap<00:03:49.030> in<00:03:49.180> the<00:03:49.240> market<00:03:49.360> very<00:03:49.660> quickly

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
fill that gap in the market very quickly

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.530 
fill that gap in the market very quickly
