00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.850 
the battery away I mean the force FX
will<00:01:47.700> do<00:01:47.790> that<00:01:47.939> too<00:01:48.090> but<00:01:48.119> these<00:01:48.450> grand<00:01:48.750> more<00:01:48.960> so

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
will do that too but these grand more so

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.280 
will do that too but these grand more so
you<00:01:50.250> put<00:01:50.430> in<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:51.079> blade<00:01:52.909> so<00:01:53.909> they're<00:01:54.030> going<00:01:54.149> to

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
you put in the blade so they're going to

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.870 
you put in the blade so they're going to
tighten<00:01:55.290> it<00:01:55.380> you<00:01:56.189> don't<00:01:56.369> want<00:01:56.430> to<00:01:56.579> tighten<00:01:56.820> it

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
tighten it you don't want to tighten it

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.359 
tighten it you don't want to tighten it
too<00:01:57.390> hard<00:01:57.689> otherwise<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.439> blade<00:01:58.710> will<00:01:59.159> get

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
too hard otherwise the blade will get

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.649 
too hard otherwise the blade will get
cracked<00:01:59.700> and<00:01:59.939> break<00:02:00.180> but<00:02:01.110> these

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:01.659 
cracked and break but these

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:03.359 
cracked and break but these
plays<00:02:01.840> are<00:02:02.020> polycarbonate<00:02:02.740> they're<00:02:03.130> pretty

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
plays are polycarbonate they're pretty

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:05.249

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
but it's going to be like way down there

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.040 
but it's going to be like way down there
it's<00:03:52.430> going<00:03:52.519> to<00:03:52.610> look<00:03:52.730> stupid<00:03:52.880> so<00:03:53.360> make<00:03:54.019> sure

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.050 
it's going to look stupid so make sure

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:56.289 
it's going to look stupid so make sure
that<00:03:54.230> you<00:03:54.440> decide<00:03:54.769> what<00:03:54.980> color<00:03:55.819> blade<00:03:56.090> you

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:56.299 
that you decide what color blade you

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:59.410 
that you decide what color blade you
want<00:03:56.569> but<00:03:56.959> only<00:03:57.470> for<00:03:57.709> the<00:03:57.769> onion<00:03:58.040> em<00:03:58.250> to<00:03:58.519> the

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 
want but only for the onion em to the

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.509 
want but only for the onion em to the
other<00:03:59.599> ones<00:03:59.780> don't<00:03:59.900> really<00:04:00.170> matter<00:04:00.379> and<00:04:00.739> just

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
other ones don't really matter and just

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:02.680 
other ones don't really matter and just
so<00:04:01.580> you<00:04:01.640> know<00:04:01.730> these<00:04:01.970> blades<00:04:02.239> are<00:04:02.360> actually

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690 
so you know these blades are actually

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:04.509 
so you know these blades are actually
longer<00:04:02.959> than<00:04:03.170> the<00:04:03.440> effects<00:04:03.769> by<00:04:03.980> maybe<00:04:04.250> about

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:04.519 
longer than the effects by maybe about

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:08.770 
longer than the effects by maybe about
three<00:04:04.849> inches<00:04:05.180> just<00:04:05.900> see<00:04:06.049> you<00:04:06.170> now<00:04:07.630> the<00:04:08.630> other

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
three inches just see you now the other

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.020 
three inches just see you now the other
lightsaber<00:04:09.590> that<00:04:09.829> I<00:04:09.860> have<00:04:10.130> is<00:04:10.459> the<00:04:10.610> e<00:04:10.640> l

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
lightsaber that I have is the e l

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.309 
lightsaber that I have is the e l
graflex<00:04:11.920> okay<00:04:13.150> now<00:04:14.150> there's<00:04:14.840> a<00:04:14.930> difference

00:04:15.309 --> 00:04:15.319 
graflex okay now there's a difference

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:18.819 
graflex okay now there's a difference
between<00:04:15.380> the<00:04:15.950> regular<00:04:16.100> yell<00:04:17.079> I<00:04:18.079> mean<00:04:18.709> the

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:18.829 
between the regular yell I mean the

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:22.900 
between the regular yell I mean the
regular<00:04:19.400> graphics<00:04:19.910> and<00:04:20.209> the<00:04:20.239> e-up<00:04:21.700> i'm<00:04:22.700> going

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
regular graphics and the e-up i'm going

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.090 
regular graphics and the e-up i'm going
to<00:04:23.030> show<00:04:23.180> you<00:04:23.210> once<00:04:23.450> it<00:04:23.570> displayed<00:04:24.260> she's<00:04:24.950> the

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
to show you once it displayed she's the

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:31.760 
to show you once it displayed she's the
easier<00:04:25.490> to<00:04:25.580> take<00:04:25.760> up<00:04:25.910> now<00:04:27.490> excuse<00:04:28.490> us<00:04:28.520> back<00:04:28.820> in

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.369 

yo<00:04:32.340> graflex<00:04:33.000> basically<00:04:33.629> supposed<00:04:34.020> to<00:04:34.169> use

00:04:34.369 --> 00:04:34.379 
yo graflex basically supposed to use

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:37.790 
yo graflex basically supposed to use
more<00:04:35.039> intense<00:04:35.460> power<00:04:35.970> it<00:04:36.960> basically<00:04:37.379> instead

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
more intense power it basically instead

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.100 
more intense power it basically instead
of<00:04:37.889> a<00:04:38.009> 9-volt<00:04:38.490> battery<00:04:38.910> uses<00:04:39.479> two<00:04:39.690> nite<00:04:39.960> low

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
of a 9-volt battery uses two nite low

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.420 
of a 9-volt battery uses two nite low
batteries<00:04:41.150> and<00:04:42.150> if<00:04:42.300> you<00:04:42.419> can<00:04:42.569> see<00:04:43.080> this<00:04:43.430> it

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430 
batteries and if you can see this it

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.969 
batteries and if you can see this it
looks<00:04:44.610> exactly<00:04:44.970> like<00:04:45.240> Anakin<00:04:46.199> Skywalker's

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:46.979 
looks exactly like Anakin Skywalker's

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:50.149 
looks exactly like Anakin Skywalker's
lightsaber<00:04:47.479> from<00:04:48.479> episode<00:04:49.229> 3<00:04:49.620> of<00:04:49.650> rented<00:04:50.069> a

00:04:50.149 --> 00:04:50.159 
lightsaber from episode 3 of rented a

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:53.210 
lightsaber from episode 3 of rented a
sip<00:04:50.400> and<00:04:51.139> also<00:04:52.139> looks<00:04:52.319> like<00:04:52.470> new<00:04:52.620> Skywalker's

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
sip and also looks like new Skywalker's

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.339 
sip and also looks like new Skywalker's
from<00:04:53.430> linear<00:04:53.669> book<00:04:53.849> which<00:04:54.569> would<00:04:54.780> basically

00:04:55.339 --> 00:04:55.349 
from linear book which would basically

00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:57.350 
from linear book which would basically
be<00:04:55.650> the<00:04:55.830> same<00:04:56.009> one<00:04:56.250> because<00:04:56.520> he<00:04:56.639> had<00:04:56.819> his

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
be the same one because he had his

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.740 
be the same one because he had his
father's<00:04:57.750> lightsaber<00:04:58.940> so<00:04:59.940> but<00:05:00.389> it's<00:05:00.569> a<00:05:00.720> it's

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210 
know like i said it's supposed to be

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:09.920 
know like i said it's supposed to be
using<00:05:06.419> up<00:05:06.690> more<00:05:07.530> intense<00:05:07.949> energy<00:05:08.870> from<00:05:09.870> the

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930 
using up more intense energy from the

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:13.480 
using up more intense energy from the
batteries<00:05:10.349> to<00:05:10.530> make<00:05:10.680> the<00:05:10.919> blade<00:05:11.280> brighter<00:05:11.669> but

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:13.490 
batteries to make the blade brighter but

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:16.760 
batteries to make the blade brighter but
it's<00:05:14.490> really<00:05:14.819> not<00:05:15.060> not<00:05:15.300> much<00:05:15.479> brighter<00:05:15.810> to<00:05:16.650> be

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770 
it's really not not much brighter to be

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:19.370 
it's really not not much brighter to be
honest<00:05:17.069> with<00:05:17.220> it<00:05:17.400> i<00:05:17.699> look<00:05:18.509> at<00:05:18.690> it<00:05:18.720> just<00:05:19.259> a

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:19.380 
honest with it i look at it just a

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:22.100 
honest with it i look at it just a
little<00:05:19.530> bit<00:05:19.770> than<00:05:20.669> the<00:05:20.819> normal<00:05:21.120> savers<00:05:21.990> from

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.110 
little bit than the normal savers from

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:25.149 
little bit than the normal savers from
parks<00:05:22.409> but<00:05:22.620> not<00:05:22.979> too<00:05:23.159> much<00:05:23.300> this<00:05:24.300> one<00:05:24.539> is<00:05:24.719> heavy

00:05:25.149 --> 00:05:25.159 
parks but not too much this one is heavy

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:28.129 
parks but not too much this one is heavy
to<00:05:26.159> see<00:05:26.400> you<00:05:26.460> know<00:05:26.550> but<00:05:26.729> it's<00:05:26.849> a<00:05:27.300> nice<00:05:27.419> feel<00:05:27.840> of

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:28.139 
to see you know but it's a nice feel of

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:29.270 
to see you know but it's a nice feel of
course<00:05:28.349> you<00:05:28.469> have<00:05:28.620> to<00:05:28.650> hold<00:05:28.919> it<00:05:28.979> so<00:05:29.130> that<00:05:29.250> the

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 
course you have to hold it so that the

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.990 
course you have to hold it so that the
outer<00:05:30.150> pieces<00:05:30.539> are<00:05:30.960> the<00:05:31.770> look<00:05:31.949> of<00:05:32.069> weight<00:05:32.250> so

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.000 
outer pieces are the look of weight so

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.219 
outer pieces are the look of weight so
that<00:05:33.030> we<00:05:33.240> don't<00:05:33.330> hate<00:05:33.539> yourself<00:05:33.690> with<00:05:34.110> it

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:34.229 
that we don't hate yourself with it

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:36.649 
that we don't hate yourself with it
though<00:05:34.409> but<00:05:35.219> it's<00:05:35.340> pretty<00:05:35.520> nice<00:05:35.759> and<00:05:36.240> like<00:05:36.539> i

00:05:36.649 --> 00:05:36.659 
though but it's pretty nice and like i

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:38.839 
though but it's pretty nice and like i
said<00:05:36.719> first<00:05:37.469> savers<00:05:37.800> does<00:05:38.039> make<00:05:38.250> pretty<00:05:38.729> good

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:38.849 
said first savers does make pretty good

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:40.939 
said first savers does make pretty good
quality<00:05:39.360> the<00:05:39.690> only<00:05:39.840> thing<00:05:39.990> I<00:05:40.050> don't<00:05:40.110> like<00:05:40.319> also

00:05:40.939 --> 00:05:40.949 
quality the only thing I don't like also

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:43.640 
quality the only thing I don't like also
is<00:05:41.159> that<00:05:41.400> the<00:05:41.580> wait<00:05:41.789> time<00:05:42.090> is<00:05:42.389> it<00:05:43.110> in<00:05:43.380> a<00:05:43.500> long

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:43.650 
is that the wait time is it in a long

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:46.070 
is that the wait time is it in a long
you<00:05:43.830> could<00:05:44.009> take<00:05:44.280> months<00:05:45.210> for<00:05:45.599> you<00:05:45.780> to<00:05:45.870> get

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.080 
you could take months for you to get

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.540 
you could take months for you to get
your<00:05:46.199> way<00:05:46.409> depending<00:05:46.889> on<00:05:47.009> when<00:05:47.190> you<00:05:47.340> buy<00:05:47.520> it

00:05:56.159 --> 00:05:59.330 
ship it out to you earlier depending if
there's<00:05:56.370> a<00:05:56.460> convention<00:05:56.610> or<00:05:57.029> so<00:05:57.830> so<00:05:58.830> just<00:05:59.219> so

00:05:59.330 --> 00:05:59.340 
there's a convention or so so just so

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:01.999 
there's a convention or so so just so
you<00:05:59.400> know<00:05:59.580> that<00:05:59.789> but<00:06:00.650> it's<00:06:01.650> pretty<00:06:01.800> nice

00:06:01.999 --> 00:06:02.009 
you know that but it's pretty nice

00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:03.379 
you know that but it's pretty nice
quality<00:06:02.430> though<00:06:02.580> I<00:06:02.610> don't<00:06:02.880> kind<00:06:03.090> of<00:06:03.180> be<00:06:03.270> with

00:06:03.379 --> 00:06:03.389 
quality though I don't kind of be with

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:05.809 
quality though I don't kind of be with
my<00:06:03.479> broad<00:06:03.690> sabers<00:06:04.259> the<00:06:04.949> force<00:06:05.279> effects<00:06:05.669> are

00:06:05.809 --> 00:06:05.819 
my broad sabers the force effects are

00:06:05.819 --> 00:06:08.540 
my broad sabers the force effects are
also<00:06:06.000> pretty<00:06:06.389> nice<00:06:06.569> because<00:06:06.900> you<00:06:07.319> know<00:06:07.550> it's

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:08.550 
also pretty nice because you know it's

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:10.040 
also pretty nice because you know it's
cool<00:06:08.699> to<00:06:08.819> have<00:06:08.969> the<00:06:09.060> sounds<00:06:09.419> from<00:06:09.539> the<00:06:09.690> movies

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:10.050 
cool to have the sounds from the movies

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:11.870 
cool to have the sounds from the movies
because<00:06:10.319> it<00:06:10.469> kind<00:06:10.919> of<00:06:10.949> gets<00:06:11.039> boring<00:06:11.550> a<00:06:11.669> few

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:11.880 
because it kind of gets boring a few

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.689 
because it kind of gets boring a few
nights<00:06:12.000> turn<00:06:12.659> on<00:06:12.719> your<00:06:12.750> lightsabre<00:06:13.370> no<00:06:14.370> sound

00:06:14.689 --> 00:06:14.699 
nights turn on your lightsabre no sound

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:18.050 
nights turn on your lightsabre no sound
so<00:06:15.300> that's<00:06:15.449> boring<00:06:15.840> because<00:06:16.580> you<00:06:17.580> would<00:06:17.759> it

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:18.060 
so that's boring because you would it

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:19.279 
so that's boring because you would it
wouldn't<00:06:18.360> really<00:06:18.419> matter<00:06:18.569> if<00:06:18.930> you're<00:06:19.050> making

00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:19.289 
wouldn't really matter if you're making

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:19.920 
wouldn't really matter if you're making
a<00:06:19.349> stand

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:19.930 
a stand

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:23.010 
a stand
because<00:06:21.419> you're<00:06:22.419> going<00:06:22.539> to<00:06:22.600> add<00:06:22.720> in<00:06:22.750> the

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:23.020 
because you're going to add in the

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:25.710 
because you're going to add in the
sounds<00:06:23.380> most<00:06:23.590> likely<00:06:23.949> same<00:06:24.400> with<00:06:24.550> the<00:06:24.720> the

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:25.720 
sounds most likely same with the the

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.629 
sounds most likely same with the the
actual<00:06:25.870> lightsaber<00:06:26.380> blade<00:06:26.530> so<00:06:27.250> you<00:06:27.520> would

00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:27.639 
actual lightsaber blade so you would

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:29.760 
actual lightsaber blade so you would
just<00:06:27.669> you<00:06:28.120> can<00:06:28.270> actually<00:06:28.389> escape<00:06:28.690> a<00:06:28.840> month<00:06:29.139> so

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:29.770 
just you can actually escape a month so

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:30.870 
just you can actually escape a month so
it<00:06:29.830> doesn't<00:06:30.039> really<00:06:30.130> matter<00:06:30.340> and<00:06:30.729> of<00:06:30.850> course

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:30.880 
it doesn't really matter and of course

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:32.490 
it doesn't really matter and of course
you<00:06:31.150> can<00:06:31.300> always<00:06:31.419> go<00:06:31.630> with<00:06:31.750> skull<00:06:31.990> savers

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:32.500 
you can always go with skull savers

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.890 
you can always go with skull savers
which<00:06:32.710> are<00:06:32.919> 1p<00:06:33.699> savers<00:06:34.180> where<00:06:34.419> the<00:06:34.509> point<00:06:34.720> does

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:34.900 
which are 1p savers where the point does

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:36.210 
which are 1p savers where the point does
not<00:06:35.050> come<00:06:35.229> off<00:06:35.380> and<00:06:35.560> it's<00:06:35.680> pretty<00:06:35.889> much<00:06:35.979> all

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:36.220 
not come off and it's pretty much all

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:40.260 
not come off and it's pretty much all
male<00:06:36.479> so<00:06:37.710> anyways<00:06:38.710> go<00:06:39.009> to<00:06:39.070> the<00:06:39.400> my<00:06:39.550> reviews<00:06:39.970> on

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:40.270 
male so anyways go to the my reviews on

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:44.490 
male so anyways go to the my reviews on
the<00:06:40.509> form<00:06:40.720> of<00:06:40.780> lightsabers<00:06:43.080> they<00:06:44.080> both<00:06:44.289> have

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:44.500 
the form of lightsabers they both have

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:48.090 
the form of lightsabers they both have
pros<00:06:44.830> and<00:06:45.009> cons<00:06:45.220> and<00:06:46.380> the<00:06:47.380> only<00:06:47.560> comes<00:06:47.860> with

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:48.100 
pros and cons and the only comes with

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:51.150 
pros and cons and the only comes with
ultra<00:06:48.520> sabers<00:06:48.880> basically<00:06:49.389> is<00:06:49.630> that<00:06:49.930> LEDs<00:06:50.889> can

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:51.160 
ultra sabers basically is that LEDs can

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.550 
ultra sabers basically is that LEDs can
break<00:06:51.509> can't<00:06:52.509> do<00:06:52.690> it<00:06:52.810> with<00:06:52.900> them<00:06:53.110> I<00:06:53.289> mean<00:06:53.500> you

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:53.560 
break can't do it with them I mean you

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.260 
break can't do it with them I mean you
can<00:06:53.770> but<00:06:53.979> most<00:06:54.370> likely<00:06:54.490> going<00:06:54.789> to<00:06:54.849> break<00:06:55.060> them

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:55.270 
can but most likely going to break them

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:57.060 
can but most likely going to break them
it's<00:06:55.690> not<00:06:55.900> work<00:06:56.080> that<00:06:56.289> they're<00:06:56.590> good<00:06:56.830> hundred

00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:57.070 
it's not work that they're good hundred

00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:59.760 
it's not work that they're good hundred
hundred<00:06:57.849> fifty<00:06:58.300> dollars<00:06:58.630> but<00:06:59.410> then<00:06:59.560> you<00:06:59.650> can

00:06:59.760 --> 00:06:59.770 
hundred fifty dollars but then you can

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:01.379 
hundred fifty dollars but then you can
always<00:06:59.919> pay<00:07:00.099> for<00:07:00.310> a<00:07:00.340> conversion<00:07:00.699> to<00:07:00.970> a<00:07:01.000> company

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:01.389 
always pay for a conversion to a company

00:07:01.389 --> 00:07:04.950 
always pay for a conversion to a company
like<00:07:01.570> ultra<00:07:02.169> sabers<00:07:02.530> for<00:07:03.400> about<00:07:03.639> 80<00:07:03.910> hours<00:07:04.330> so

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:04.960 
like ultra sabers for about 80 hours so

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:06.600 
like ultra sabers for about 80 hours so
depending<00:07:05.590> on<00:07:05.680> the<00:07:05.830> lights<00:07:06.130> everything<00:07:06.520> they

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:06.610 
depending on the lights everything they

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:10.260 
depending on the lights everything they
have<00:07:06.820> but<00:07:07.270> you<00:07:07.810> want<00:07:08.020> to<00:07:08.110> convert<00:07:08.639> and<00:07:09.639> that

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:10.270 
have but you want to convert and that

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:11.460 
have but you want to convert and that
way<00:07:10.419> you<00:07:10.539> can<00:07:10.660> take<00:07:10.780> off<00:07:10.900> the<00:07:10.930> plate<00:07:11.229> so<00:07:11.440> that

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:11.470 
way you can take off the plate so that

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:13.499 
way you can take off the plate so that
actually<00:07:11.650> is<00:07:11.979> pretty<00:07:12.039> it's<00:07:12.970> pretty<00:07:13.030> good<00:07:13.360> then

00:07:13.499 --> 00:07:13.509 
actually is pretty it's pretty good then

00:07:13.509 --> 00:07:15.390 
actually is pretty it's pretty good then
you'll<00:07:13.660> have<00:07:13.750> sound<00:07:14.110> but<00:07:14.710> I<00:07:14.740> heard<00:07:15.039> that<00:07:15.250> the

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:15.400 
you'll have sound but I heard that the

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:18.390 
you'll have sound but I heard that the
blades<00:07:15.789> aren't<00:07:16.750> as<00:07:17.080> strong<00:07:17.500> as<00:07:17.740> parks<00:07:18.039> a<00:07:18.190> purse

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:18.400 
blades aren't as strong as parks a purse

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:22.860 
blades aren't as strong as parks a purse
though<00:07:18.580> so<00:07:19.330> the<00:07:20.320> benefit<00:07:21.220> of<00:07:21.479> park<00:07:22.479> sabers

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:22.870 
though so the benefit of park sabers

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:26.659 
though so the benefit of park sabers
would<00:07:23.050> be<00:07:23.229> that<00:07:23.560> the<00:07:24.039> blades<00:07:24.310> are<00:07:24.430> stronger

00:07:26.659 --> 00:07:26.669 
would be that the blades are stronger

00:07:26.669 --> 00:07:29.610 
would be that the blades are stronger
ways<00:07:27.669> already<00:07:27.940> come<00:07:28.240> off<00:07:28.389> the<00:07:28.510> hilts<00:07:28.780> they

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:29.620 
ways already come off the hilts they

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:31.379 
ways already come off the hilts they
have<00:07:29.770> custom<00:07:30.190> web<00:07:30.310> lightsabers<00:07:31.240> that<00:07:31.330> you

00:07:31.379 --> 00:07:31.389 
have custom web lightsabers that you

00:07:31.389 --> 00:07:34.860 
have custom web lightsabers that you
can't<00:07:31.630> get<00:07:31.780> anywhere<00:07:32.220> else<00:07:33.690> but<00:07:34.690> the<00:07:34.780> only

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:34.870 
can't get anywhere else but the only

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:36.029 
can't get anywhere else but the only
problem<00:07:35.110> is<00:07:35.229> that<00:07:35.320> the<00:07:35.500> playset<00:07:35.830> that's

00:07:36.029 --> 00:07:36.039 
problem is that the playset that's

00:07:36.039 --> 00:07:38.640 
problem is that the playset that's
stupid<00:07:36.460> warning<00:07:37.000> label<00:07:37.330> one<00:07:37.479> thing<00:07:38.080> you<00:07:38.530> can

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:38.650 
stupid warning label one thing you can

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:41.820 
stupid warning label one thing you can
sit<00:07:38.889> and<00:07:39.099> let's<00:07:39.370> dump<00:07:40.060> plus<00:07:40.630> the<00:07:40.840> the<00:07:41.289> actual

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:41.830 
sit and let's dump plus the the actual
