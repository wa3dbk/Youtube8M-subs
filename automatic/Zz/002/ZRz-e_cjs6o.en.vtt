00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
pen what I try and get to is the essence

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.180 
pen what I try and get to is the essence
of<00:03:24.580> that<00:03:24.820> person<00:03:25.360> as<00:03:25.560> they<00:03:26.560> appear<00:03:26.890> to<00:03:26.920> be<00:03:27.040> in

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
of that person as they appear to be in

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:40.330 
of that person as they appear to be in
the<00:03:27.460> fairly<00:03:27.760> limited<00:03:27.940> time<00:03:28.390> we<00:03:28.570> have<00:03:28.720> together

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.550 

I'm<00:03:41.340> trying<00:03:41.790> to<00:03:41.880> get<00:03:42.180> to<00:03:42.390> the<00:03:42.510> essence<00:03:42.930> to

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
I'm trying to get to the essence to

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.830 
I'm trying to get to the essence to
parent<00:03:44.160> into<00:03:44.430> as<00:03:44.520> few<00:03:44.790> lights<00:03:45.030> as<00:03:45.300> I<00:03:45.420> can<00:03:45.630> do

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
parent into as few lights as I can do

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.040 
parent into as few lights as I can do
for<00:03:46.740> me<00:03:46.920> the<00:03:47.430> more<00:03:47.670> I<00:03:47.700> do<00:03:47.820> the<00:03:48.120> worse<00:03:48.330> it<00:03:48.540> gets

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 
for me the more I do the worse it gets

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:53.390 
for me the more I do the worse it gets
so<00:03:49.410> it's<00:03:49.770> an<00:03:50.900> imprint<00:03:51.900> really<00:03:52.650> it's<00:03:52.950> a<00:03:53.070> sort<00:03:53.250> of

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
so it's an imprint really it's a sort of

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.420 
so it's an imprint really it's a sort of
sense<00:03:53.640> memory<00:03:54.090> of<00:03:54.240> them<00:03:54.450> and<00:03:54.800> I<00:03:55.800> just<00:03:56.220> keep

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
sense memory of them and I just keep

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.940 
sense memory of them and I just keep
drawing<00:03:56.910> I<00:03:57.090> mean<00:03:57.240> my<00:03:57.450> the<00:03:58.230> great<00:03:58.440> thing<00:03:58.680> for<00:03:58.800> me
