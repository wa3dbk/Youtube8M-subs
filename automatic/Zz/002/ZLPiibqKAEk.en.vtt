00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
all right so we're recording a soprano

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.760 
all right so we're recording a soprano
sax<00:00:25.440> here<00:00:25.620> with<00:00:25.710> Mike<00:00:25.890> Acosta<00:00:26.430> and<00:00:27.650> we<00:00:28.650> are

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:28.770 
sax here with Mike Acosta and we are

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.080 
sax here with Mike Acosta and we are
experimenting<00:00:29.100> again<00:00:29.610> with<00:00:29.760> a<00:00:29.789> couple<00:00:30.060> of

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
experimenting again with a couple of

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.720 
experimenting again with a couple of
different<00:00:30.539> Pearlman<00:00:30.870> mics<00:00:31.050> and<00:00:31.309> on<00:00:32.309> this<00:00:32.550> one

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
different Pearlman mics and on this one

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.369 
different Pearlman mics and on this one
I<00:00:32.789> picked<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.149> Pro<00:00:33.360> Minelli<00:00:33.750> it's<00:00:34.020> a<00:00:34.110> mic<00:00:34.260> I

00:00:34.369 --> 00:00:34.379 
I picked the Pro Minelli it's a mic I

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:36.380 
I picked the Pro Minelli it's a mic I
really<00:00:34.710> like<00:00:34.890> because<00:00:35.280> it<00:00:35.940> actually<00:00:36.089> has<00:00:36.359> a

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
really like because it actually has a

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.119 
really like because it actually has a
really<00:00:36.480> nice<00:00:36.960> scoop<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:37.530> it<00:00:37.620> it'll<00:00:37.859> enhance

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
really nice scoop to it it'll enhance

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.829 
really nice scoop to it it'll enhance
the<00:00:38.670> highs<00:00:38.820> a<00:00:38.850> little<00:00:39.120> bit<00:00:39.329> but<00:00:39.480> also<00:00:39.600> add<00:00:39.809> a

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:39.839 
the highs a little bit but also add a

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:41.869 
the highs a little bit but also add a
little<00:00:40.260> bit<00:00:40.379> of<00:00:40.469> bigness<00:00:40.800> in<00:00:40.949> the<00:00:41.039> lows<00:00:41.249> I<00:00:41.579> find

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
little bit of bigness in the lows I find

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.180 
little bit of bigness in the lows I find
that<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.179> be<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.719> pro<00:00:43.350> Minelli<00:00:43.649> to<00:00:43.859> be<00:00:43.949> quite

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
that to be the pro Minelli to be quite

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.639 
that to be the pro Minelli to be quite
good<00:00:44.460> on<00:00:44.730> a<00:00:44.789> lot<00:00:45.179> of<00:00:45.210> instruments<00:00:45.809> because<00:00:46.440> you

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
good on a lot of instruments because you

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.469 
good on a lot of instruments because you
can<00:00:46.800> really<00:00:47.100> bring<00:00:47.370> things<00:00:47.699> a<00:00:47.879> little<00:00:47.969> forward

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:48.479 
can really bring things a little forward

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:49.790 
can really bring things a little forward
and<00:00:48.510> make<00:00:48.659> them<00:00:48.780> sound<00:00:48.989> exciting<00:00:49.409> on<00:00:49.499> the<00:00:49.589> top

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
and make them sound exciting on the top

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.500 
and make them sound exciting on the top
but<00:00:50.010> still<00:00:50.249> adding<00:00:50.579> some<00:00:50.789> of<00:00:50.819> that<00:00:50.969> warmth<00:00:51.420> and

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
but still adding some of that warmth and

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.149 
but still adding some of that warmth and
resonance<00:00:51.929> of<00:00:52.379> an<00:00:52.620> instrument<00:00:52.890> and

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:53.159 
resonance of an instrument and

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:54.680 
resonance of an instrument and
especially<00:00:53.429> a<00:00:53.609> high<00:00:53.819> register<00:00:54.300> and<00:00:54.420> spent

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
especially a high register and spent

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.079 
especially a high register and spent
like<00:00:54.809> this<00:00:55.050> having<00:00:55.920> that<00:00:56.069> extra<00:00:56.429> body<00:00:56.789> in

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:57.089 
like this having that extra body in

00:00:57.089 --> 00:00:58.250 
like this having that extra body in
there<00:00:57.210> from<00:00:57.359> the<00:00:57.449> microphone<00:00:57.839> can<00:00:57.989> really

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
there from the microphone can really

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.979 
there from the microphone can really
make<00:00:58.409> it<00:00:58.440> sound<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:58.800> little<00:00:58.829> bit<00:00:59.159> warmer<00:00:59.989> we're

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
make it sound a little bit warmer we're

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.989 
make it sound a little bit warmer we're
going<00:01:01.229> into<00:01:01.409> Pacifica<00:01:02.010> which<00:01:02.190> is<00:01:02.399> pretty<00:01:02.789> much

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:02.999 
going into Pacifica which is pretty much

00:01:02.999 --> 00:01:05.060 
going into Pacifica which is pretty much
my<00:01:03.210> default<00:01:03.539> for<00:01:03.899> almost<00:01:04.320> everything<00:01:04.769> these

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
my default for almost everything these

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.580 
my default for almost everything these
days<00:01:05.420> and<00:01:06.420> then<00:01:06.600> I'm<00:01:06.750> using<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:07.230> little<00:01:07.410> bit<00:01:07.500> of

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
days and then I'm using a little bit of

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.730 
days and then I'm using a little bit of
EQ<00:01:07.740> from<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.730> a<00:01:09.030> designs<00:01:09.510> EMP<00:01:10.110> EQ<00:01:10.440> I've<00:01:10.590> just

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
EQ from the a designs EMP EQ I've just

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.560 
EQ from the a designs EMP EQ I've just
done<00:01:10.920> a<00:01:10.950> little<00:01:11.400> boost<00:01:11.610> maybe<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:11.940> couple<00:01:12.150> DB

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
done a little boost maybe a couple DB

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.320 
done a little boost maybe a couple DB
around<00:01:12.870> 5k<00:01:13.470> again<00:01:14.220> just<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:14.610> make<00:01:14.760> it<00:01:14.790> a<00:01:15.000> little

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
around 5k again just to make it a little

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.750 
around 5k again just to make it a little
bit<00:01:15.600> more<00:01:15.810> forward<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.530> just<00:01:17.160> a<00:01:17.250> little<00:01:17.460> bit

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:17.760 
bit more forward and just a little bit

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.590 
bit more forward and just a little bit
of<00:01:17.850> scoop<00:01:18.060> around<00:01:19.970> around<00:01:20.970> 20<00:01:21.270> Hertz<00:01:21.450> so

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
of scoop around around 20 Hertz so

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.970 
of scoop around around 20 Hertz so
really<00:01:21.840> not<00:01:21.960> doing<00:01:22.170> much<00:01:22.290> I'm<00:01:22.590> just<00:01:22.620> getting

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:22.980 
really not doing much I'm just getting

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:24.440 
really not doing much I'm just getting
rid<00:01:23.070> of<00:01:23.160> a<00:01:23.310> little<00:01:23.580> bit<00:01:23.700> of<00:01:23.730> the<00:01:23.880> Rumble<00:01:24.240> and

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
rid of a little bit of the Rumble and

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.180 
rid of a little bit of the Rumble and
pulling<00:01:25.080> out<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.200> little<00:01:25.500> bit<00:01:25.710> of<00:01:25.770> that<00:01:25.860> low-end

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:26.190 
pulling out a little bit of that low-end

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:27.350 
pulling out a little bit of that low-end
energy<00:01:26.520> because<00:01:26.700> it's<00:01:26.850> not<00:01:27.000> really<00:01:27.210> going<00:01:27.300> to

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
energy because it's not really going to

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.180 
energy because it's not really going to
be<00:01:27.450> very<00:01:27.510> important<00:01:28.080> on<00:01:28.320> a<00:01:28.590> track<00:01:28.830> like<00:01:29.040> this

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:29.190 
be very important on a track like this

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.120 
be very important on a track like this
so<00:01:29.430> it's<00:01:29.580> just<00:01:29.760> the<00:01:30.000> pearl<00:01:30.210> Minnelli<00:01:30.710> into<00:01:31.710> the

a designs Pacifica pad in again to give
it<00:01:34.710> a<00:01:34.770> little<00:01:34.950> bit<00:01:35.130> of<00:01:35.220> that<00:01:35.280> bigness<00:01:35.730> and

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
it a little bit of that bigness and

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
warmth into the EMP peq just to push it

a little bit more forward and give it a

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
little bit more life and we're tracking

all<00:02:22.760> right<00:02:22.939> we've<00:02:23.420> switched<00:02:23.689> over<00:02:23.959> to<00:02:24.109> two

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
EQ I've just used a little bit of a 15k

boost way up on the top of the hammer

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:43.959 
boost way up on the top of the hammer
just<00:02:42.260> to<00:02:42.409> bring<00:02:42.590> out<00:02:42.769> a<00:02:43.010> little<00:02:43.430> bit<00:02:43.639> more<00:02:43.879> of

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
the air in the room and I've done a

the air in the room and I've done a
little<00:02:45.889> bit<00:02:46.129> of<00:02:46.430> goosing<00:02:47.000> at<00:02:47.269> 60<00:02:48.049> Hertz<00:02:48.230> on<00:02:48.439> the

little bit of goosing at 60 Hertz on the

little bit of goosing at 60 Hertz on the
EMP<00:02:48.739> EQ<00:02:49.219> just<00:02:49.819> because<00:02:49.969> it's<00:02:50.120> a<00:02:50.209> really<00:02:50.689> cool

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
EMP EQ just because it's a really cool

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.809 
EMP EQ just because it's a really cool
effect<00:02:51.230> to<00:02:51.889> sort<00:02:52.099> of<00:02:52.159> make<00:02:52.340> things<00:02:52.519> sound<00:02:52.700> a

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:52.819 
effect to sort of make things sound a

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:54.580 
effect to sort of make things sound a
little<00:02:53.150> bigger<00:02:53.359> and<00:02:53.569> also<00:02:53.810> to<00:02:53.870> add<00:02:54.109> a<00:02:54.139> little

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
little bigger and also to add a little

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:55.869 
little bigger and also to add a little
aggressive<00:02:54.889> edge<00:02:55.129> to<00:02:55.310> that<00:02:55.340> bottom<00:02:55.760> which

00:02:55.869 --> 00:02:55.879 
aggressive edge to that bottom which

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:57.970 
aggressive edge to that bottom which
will<00:02:56.000> make<00:02:56.120> those<00:02:56.299> low<00:02:56.629> octave<00:02:57.049> things<00:02:57.260> jump

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
will make those low octave things jump

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.289 
will make those low octave things jump
out<00:02:58.099> of<00:02:58.129> the<00:02:58.280> speaker's<00:02:58.609> just<00:02:58.849> a<00:02:58.939> little<00:02:59.180> bit
