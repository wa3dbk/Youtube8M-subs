I'll see you will cancel wheels by
Trevor<00:03:35.989> screw<00:03:36.989> this<00:03:37.349> back<00:03:37.560> again<00:03:37.950> now<00:03:40.579> I'll

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
Trevor screw this back again now I'll

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:44.390 
Trevor screw this back again now I'll
show<00:03:41.879> you<00:03:41.910> the<00:03:42.230> solar<00:03:43.230> setup<00:03:43.560> and<00:03:43.980> then<00:03:44.190> on<00:03:44.310> the

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
show you the solar setup and then on the

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.339 
show you the solar setup and then on the
end<00:03:44.489> of<00:03:44.609> the<00:03:44.670> video<00:03:44.910> I<00:03:44.970> will<00:03:45.540> just<00:03:45.750> watch<00:03:45.900> a

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:46.349 
end of the video I will just watch a

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:47.750 
end of the video I will just watch a
couple<00:03:46.650> of<00:03:46.769> photos<00:03:47.129> off<00:03:47.280> with<00:03:47.400> the<00:03:47.489> rack<00:03:47.730> that

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
couple of photos off with the rack that

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.509 
couple of photos off with the rack that
I<00:03:47.970> made<00:03:48.349> for<00:03:49.349> my<00:03:49.410> solar<00:03:49.799> panel<00:03:50.220> which

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
I made for my solar panel which

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:53.780 
I made for my solar panel which
unfortunately<00:03:51.030> is<00:03:51.390> packed<00:03:51.660> away<00:03:52.790> otherwise

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
unfortunately is packed away otherwise

00:03:53.790 --> 00:04:01.240 
unfortunately is packed away otherwise
I'd<00:03:54.030> get<00:03:54.150> it<00:03:54.269> out<00:03:54.420> for<00:03:54.599> the<00:03:54.660> video

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
cover-up right and this is mono so I

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.630 
cover-up right and this is mono so I
need<00:04:24.000> two<00:04:24.120> batches<00:04:24.480> connected<00:04:24.870> at<00:04:24.990> the<00:04:25.050> moment

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:25.640 
need two batches connected at the moment

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.920 
need two batches connected at the moment
and<00:04:26.640> a<00:04:26.670> little<00:04:27.000> issue<00:04:27.180> with<00:04:27.330> the<00:04:27.480> third<00:04:27.750> one

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:22.630 
the same thread as these for this poor

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:26.610 
the same thread as these for this poor
part<00:06:23.040> to<00:06:24.040> support<00:06:24.400> the<00:06:24.490> frame<00:06:25.320> I've<00:06:26.320> got<00:06:26.470> these

part to support the frame I've got these

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:28.290 
part to support the frame I've got these
off<00:06:26.800> of<00:06:26.830> an<00:06:27.310> old<00:06:27.430> lawnmower<00:06:27.700> that<00:06:27.940> was<00:06:28.120> being

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:28.300 
off of an old lawnmower that was being

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.420 
off of an old lawnmower that was being
thrown<00:06:28.540> away<00:06:28.680> and<00:06:29.680> they're<00:06:30.010> exactly<00:06:30.130> the<00:06:30.370> same

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:30.430 
thrown away and they're exactly the same

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:32.820 
thrown away and they're exactly the same
size<00:06:30.550> so<00:06:31.000> I<00:06:31.060> figure<00:06:31.330> you<00:06:31.540> know<00:06:31.570> you<00:06:32.500> can<00:06:32.680> never

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:32.830 
size so I figure you know you can never

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:35.880 
size so I figure you know you can never
go<00:06:33.040> without<00:06:33.310> space<00:06:34.020> those<00:06:35.020> things<00:06:35.290> so<00:06:35.590> yeah

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:35.890 
go without space those things so yeah

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:39.450 
go without space those things so yeah
that<00:06:36.250> works<00:06:36.490> well<00:06:36.960> this<00:06:37.960> what<00:06:38.140> does<00:06:38.320> hope<00:06:39.310> this

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:39.460 
that works well this what does hope this

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:41.970 
that works well this what does hope this
video<00:06:39.730> helps<00:06:40.000> you<00:06:40.060> out<00:06:40.170> and<00:06:41.170> I<00:06:41.470> thank<00:06:41.770> you<00:06:41.860> for
