to be going up let's cut the random size

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.620 
to be going up let's cut the random size
does<00:01:26.470> not<00:01:26.770> have<00:01:26.979> to<00:01:27.100> be<00:01:27.189> perfect<00:01:27.400> size<00:01:27.790> wanted

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
does not have to be perfect size wanted

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:36.730 
does not have to be perfect size wanted
to<00:01:28.689> make<00:01:28.810> it<00:01:28.930> tall

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
there you go as you can see how this is

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.990 
there you go as you can see how this is
like<00:01:42.200> put<00:01:43.200> at<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.470> bottom<00:01:43.920> because<00:01:44.100> it<00:01:44.820> just

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
like put at the bottom because it just

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:53.060 
like put at the bottom because it just
like<00:01:45.300> helps<00:01:46.050> it<00:01:46.820> hold<00:01:47.820> it<00:01:48.090> well<00:01:50.540> and<00:01:51.540> just<00:01:52.070> glue

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
like helps it hold it well and just glue

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.310 
like helps it hold it well and just glue
this<00:01:53.360> piece<00:01:55.370> onto<00:01:56.370> the<00:01:57.360> bottom<00:01:57.720> as<00:01:57.960> you<00:01:58.140> can

this piece onto the bottom as you can

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.670 
this piece onto the bottom as you can
see<00:02:00.110> you<00:02:01.110> blue<00:02:02.150> back<00:02:03.150> to<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.479> bottom<00:02:03.900> upper

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
see you blue back to the bottom upper

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.109 
see you blue back to the bottom upper
caste<00:02:04.920> with<00:02:05.160> streets<00:02:05.610> that<00:02:06.390> flat<00:02:06.750> and<00:02:08.119> just

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
caste with streets that flat and just

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.170 
caste with streets that flat and just
glue<00:02:09.479> it<00:02:09.509> onto<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:10.100> B<00:02:11.100> I<00:02:11.130> don't<00:02:11.670> really<00:02:11.970> like

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
glue it onto the B I don't really like

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.680 
glue it onto the B I don't really like
the<00:02:12.360> way<00:02:12.510> how<00:02:12.750> this<00:02:12.990> looks<00:02:13.350> at<00:02:13.680> the<00:02:14.270> side<00:02:15.270> of<00:02:15.510> it

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
the way how this looks at the side of it

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.620 
the way how this looks at the side of it
so<00:02:15.930> I'm<00:02:16.470> just<00:02:16.620> going<00:02:16.770> to<00:02:16.830> cover<00:02:17.010> it<00:02:17.280> but

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
so I'm just going to cover it but

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.130 
so I'm just going to cover it but
complet<00:02:18.630> by<00:02:18.900> optimal<00:02:20.330> once<00:02:21.330> again<00:02:21.660> it<00:02:21.810> kind<00:02:22.020> of

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
complet by optimal once again it kind of

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.110 
complet by optimal once again it kind of
seems<00:02:22.380> hard<00:02:22.680> so<00:02:22.980> I'm<00:02:23.100> till<00:02:23.370> show<00:02:23.610> you<00:02:23.670> how<00:02:24.060> the

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
seems hard so I'm till show you how the

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.110 
seems hard so I'm till show you how the
side<00:02:24.840> looks<00:02:25.140> like<00:02:25.260> so<00:02:26.070> you<00:02:26.130> know<00:02:26.220> it's<00:02:26.820> kind<00:02:26.940> of

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
side looks like so you know it's kind of

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.030 
side looks like so you know it's kind of
click<00:02:27.420> it<00:02:27.570> right<00:02:27.600> here<00:02:27.959> but<00:02:28.170> it's<00:02:28.620> not<00:02:28.860> a<00:02:28.890> big

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
click it right here but it's not a big

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.510 
click it right here but it's not a big
deal

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
deal

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:35.870 
deal
so<00:02:30.390> here<00:02:30.600> that<00:02:30.750> looks<00:02:31.020> like<00:02:34.700> there's<00:02:35.700> the

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
so here that looks like there's the

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.970 
so here that looks like there's the
turns<00:02:36.150> glue<00:02:36.540> there<00:02:36.780> which<00:02:36.989> will<00:02:37.230> dry<00:02:37.470> up

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
turns glue there which will dry up

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.390 
turns glue there which will dry up
what<00:02:38.310> do<00:02:38.400> you<00:02:38.459> need<00:02:38.580> is<00:02:38.820> two<00:02:39.030> match<00:02:39.209> boxes<00:02:39.900> and

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
what do you need is two match boxes and
