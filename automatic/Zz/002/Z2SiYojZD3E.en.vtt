I'm<00:04:04.000> going<00:04:04.180> to<00:04:04.209> use<00:04:04.269> some<00:04:04.420> padding<00:04:04.989> for<00:04:05.890> pics

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
I'm going to use some padding for pics

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.819 
I'm going to use some padding for pics
all<00:04:06.370> 7<00:04:06.730> pixels<00:04:06.910> now<00:04:07.750> what<00:04:07.900> this<00:04:08.019> means<00:04:08.290> is<00:04:08.530> the

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:08.829 
all 7 pixels now what this means is the

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:10.710 
all 7 pixels now what this means is the
top<00:04:09.040> and<00:04:09.220> the<00:04:09.310> bottom<00:04:09.340> padding<00:04:10.120> so<00:04:10.329> here<00:04:10.570> and

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
top and the bottom padding so here and

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.380 
top and the bottom padding so here and
here<00:04:10.780> are<00:04:11.079> four<00:04:11.769> pixels<00:04:12.130> and<00:04:12.340> the<00:04:12.400> left<00:04:13.209> and

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390

right here in here and 7 pixels padding

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.430 
right here in here and 7 pixels padding
this<00:04:16.150> is<00:04:16.299> just<00:04:16.419> short<00:04:16.690> time<00:04:16.840> for<00:04:17.019> writing<00:04:17.079> for

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 
this is just short time for writing for

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.759 
this is just short time for writing for
pics<00:04:17.650> or<00:04:17.799> 7<00:04:18.070> pixels<00:04:18.220> for<00:04:18.549> pixel<00:04:18.880> 7<00:04:19.150> pixels<00:04:19.769> so

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769 
pics or 7 pixels for pixel 7 pixels so

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:22.469 
pics or 7 pixels for pixel 7 pixels so
it's<00:04:20.919> just<00:04:21.039> a<00:04:21.310> quick<00:04:21.850> way<00:04:22.030> of<00:04:22.060> writing<00:04:22.450> that

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:22.479 
it's just a quick way of writing that

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:26.240 
it's just a quick way of writing that
and<00:04:23.110> I'm<00:04:23.500> gonna<00:04:23.650> do<00:04:24.640> text<00:04:24.970> transform

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
and I'm gonna do text transform

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.010 
and I'm gonna do text transform
uppercase<00:04:27.250> to<00:04:27.550> make<00:04:27.700> all<00:04:27.880> the<00:04:28.240> writing

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
uppercase to make all the writing

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.390 
uppercase to make all the writing
in<00:04:30.250> capitals<00:04:31.250> and<00:04:31.610> text<00:04:32.389> decoration<00:04:32.509> none<00:04:33.400> to

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
in capitals and text decoration none to

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:35.890 
in capitals and text decoration none to
remove<00:04:34.669> the<00:04:34.910> underlining<00:04:35.569> from<00:04:35.810> the

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
remove the underlining from the

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.999 
remove the underlining from the
hyperlinks<00:04:36.440> and<00:04:36.910> that's<00:04:37.910> it<00:04:38.800> so<00:04:39.800> now<00:04:39.949> I'm

00:04:39.999 --> 00:04:40.009 
hyperlinks and that's it so now I'm

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:42.070 
hyperlinks and that's it so now I'm
going<00:04:40.099> to<00:04:40.220> save<00:04:40.400> that<00:04:40.430> and<00:04:41.000> press<00:04:41.539> f12<00:04:41.870> to

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
going to save that and press f12 to

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.279 
going to save that and press f12 to

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
it's been in the center and the padding

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.520 
it's been in the center and the padding
has<00:04:53.180> just<00:04:53.509> given<00:04:53.629> it<00:04:53.810> a<00:04:53.840> little<00:04:53.960> bump<00:04:54.229> there

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
has just given it a little bump there

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:56.680 
has just given it a little bump there
but<00:04:55.250> you<00:04:55.580> can<00:04:55.729> see<00:04:55.879> that<00:04:56.030> when<00:04:56.150> I<00:04:56.180> put<00:04:56.419> my<00:04:56.449> mouse

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:56.690

00:04:58.719 --> 00:04:58.729 
over it nothing happens and this is

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:02.820 
over it nothing happens and this is
because<00:04:59.090> we<00:04:59.270> still<00:04:59.539> haven't<00:05:00.099> done<00:05:01.099> the<00:05:01.509> hover
