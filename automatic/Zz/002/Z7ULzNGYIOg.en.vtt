 a malignant virus and will not be able to supply kidnapped people is weak so that 

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:12.219
 she will be in charge of such privilege the daily dose begins 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:15.219
 you would be sick 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:18.810
 efe 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.810
 r 

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:26.449
 his partner was going in another point com 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:30.330
 welcome to monsiváis one today is the day chosen by the half tip as 

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:32.660
 to make the release of your favor 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.500
 vázquez had in his offices with the director of the sae to know before 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.000
 no one what will be the news that can offer question 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.120
 know the new the image of the novel meters 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.230
 percent and the metroway performance 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.860
 as completely as a clear message 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.580
 that we are still an online leisure area it is a product which 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:03.560
 We have not only renewed as you can see the image 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:04.610
 of the retro 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.020
 but that fact a complete change of the product 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.590
 We believe that we have a product 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.270
 which had remained 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.470
 percent somewhat lagged in the evolution of what were the years in 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.040
 Spain after a few days of local entertainment 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.370
 and we have thought that there is still a niche market I will give very 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.860
 important which has a lot of room to mix the product highly what 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.700
 we have tried is to be 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:27.759
 it is much more agile 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:29.410
 simple narration 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:32.060
 although it is very attractive for the user 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.439
 and what for it will do against 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.179
 all the leisure content that interests you is the simplest way you have 

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:41.950
 positioned has been enhanced from the header what is the search engine as 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:42.620
 is 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.700
 divided into two fields the boxes make a search 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.340
 and a specific site of a category type and sport site for its 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.610
 labels or their attributes that we have located and where there are 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.820
 for the geographical area, this is from a province or municipality 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.740
 oo in some cases with madrid and barcelona valencia and seville both 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.079
 district level as a neighborhood level between the advantages or the competitors is that 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:09.619
 we have a very important historical editorial content and that we believe 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:10.950
 that we have been able 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.950
 d &amp; g make it coexist with each part user participation 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:17.629
 why we created there balanced mullor which we have content for 

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:21.300
 all for our team, on the other hand, other tools and utilities 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:25.689
 we have your active participation very important data apart the user the 

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:26.550
 new zone 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.790
 of user profile in which the 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.420
 can register you can participate commenting on websites in tossa los 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.440
 that has been can be added from your favorite sites can include 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.340
 photographs can send messages with friends inside or invite 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.080
 outside contacts to participate within pro and can see in profiles of 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.370
 other users to share with them and see what your 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.900
 user and other sites where I've gone that he liked that he does not like the change 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.089
 favors logically declared advertising 

00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:58.559
 because we are going to try apart from logically having traditional advertising 

00:02:59.369 --> 00:03:03.369
 on the internet the base of the baths, because we are going to try to make special actions 

00:03:03.369 --> 00:03:07.749
 international from advertising that is much more akin to what is the 

00:03:07.749 --> 00:03:11.729
 product opening the door to all the social security love part of 

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:13.110
 user participation 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.709
 apart from logically generating in neighborhoods much more loyal bonds consumes 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:21.169
 a volume on this page is larger and with a higher quality 

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:24.649
 we understand that we also have to do actions logically a lot 

00:03:24.649 --> 00:03:27.769
 more difference is much more direct from the advertising point of view to 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:30.259
 priori will not be for the social network 

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:34.009
 what as such but we want to go little by little to reach the goal we proceed to 

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:35.409
 your user so you can 

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:38.999
 converge in an area to which he participates, generating content 

00:03:38.999 --> 00:03:43.559
 always coexisting with the content generated by the editorial team 

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:46.819
 and logically brings us this important event in terms of 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:49.260
 user participation four page views 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.729
 photo of the user 

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:56.019
 we crawled our page 4 your opinions and ratings and more 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:58.259
 down the street is still one of the 

00:03:58.259 --> 00:04:01.279
 the section those fundamental areas of our product 

00:04:01.279 --> 00:04:04.790
 we believe that the under the mental rae obviously google maps right now 

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:07.599
 what we want to think 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:12.279
 our greatest incentive for those maps to enhance and position all 

00:04:12.279 --> 00:04:16.289
 our sites and events in points of interest that we have 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:19.859
 a series of axes let's say in the future 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:23.949
 it was one of them logically this on par with mobile development which inn 

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:26.300
 an app 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.680
 very well directed to the country the information as a star product 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.410
 simply released 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.520
 but for other love platforms narration benet mobile version 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.320
 also that the user will be able to search 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.599
 was discovering that you can build your leisure activities with the network 

00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:44.099
 The real expectations are difficult to quantify logically not with others 

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:47.779
 products and our hopes are to the maximum 

00:04:47.779 --> 00:04:50.979
 hence to put it because the user was not deleted no and that is going to see 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:55.339
 logically cornellá in the accesses and interactivity users of the page 

00:04:55.339 --> 00:04:59.369
 there was who is everything for today let's hope that the day I won the battle the virus to 

00:04:59.369 --> 00:05:00.870
 ours and tomorrow 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.410
 I was in the fifth point so he called the company we went to 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:04.570
 win
