get<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.270> fang<00:00:18.750> I<00:00:18.990> think<00:00:19.199> that's<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:19.380> scout

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
get the fang I think that's the scout

get the fang I think that's the scout
rifle<00:00:19.770> and<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.189> hand<00:00:20.789> cannon<00:00:21.090> only<00:00:21.660> from

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
rifle and the hand cannon only from

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.509 
rifle and the hand cannon only from

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
killing crota and all the other drops

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:24.740 
killing crota and all the other drops
were<00:00:23.670> kind<00:00:23.850> of<00:00:23.910> like<00:00:24.060> random<00:00:24.359> throughout<00:00:24.600> the

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
were kind of like random throughout the

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.839 
were kind of like random throughout the
thing<00:00:25.140> but<00:00:25.350> this<00:00:25.890> is<00:00:26.099> dropped<00:00:26.340> from<00:00:26.430> Hardwick

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
thing but this is dropped from Hardwick

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.060

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
rota it does void damage as explosive

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.710 
rota it does void damage as explosive
damage<00:00:29.189> it<00:00:29.550> is<00:00:29.699> similar<00:00:29.970> to<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.269> Fate<00:00:30.449> bringer

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
damage it is similar to the Fate bringer

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.389 
damage it is similar to the Fate bringer
and<00:00:31.019> it's<00:00:31.199> got<00:00:31.349> a<00:00:31.380> lot<00:00:31.679> of<00:00:31.710> Awesome<00:00:32.279> qualities

thing<00:00:34.110> i<00:00:34.170> wanted<00:00:34.350> to<00:00:34.410> mention<00:00:34.500> is<00:00:34.829> this<00:00:34.950> is<00:00:35.130> a

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
thing i wanted to mention is this is a

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.270 
thing i wanted to mention is this is a
PVE<00:00:35.880> review<00:00:36.809> so<00:00:36.960> this<00:00:37.110> is<00:00:37.230> not<00:00:37.380> based<00:00:37.559> on<00:00:37.770> pvp

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
PVE review so this is not based on pvp

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.010 
PVE review so this is not based on pvp
however<00:00:38.670> I<00:00:38.760> do<00:00:38.910> think<00:00:39.149> that<00:00:39.480> this<00:00:39.629> weapon<00:00:39.930> is

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
however I do think that this weapon is

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.720 
however I do think that this weapon is
probably<00:00:40.320> pretty<00:00:40.500> good<00:00:40.739> at<00:00:40.860> pvp<00:00:41.040> I'm<00:00:41.460> just<00:00:41.640> not

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
probably pretty good at pvp I'm just not

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.280 
probably pretty good at pvp I'm just not
a<00:00:41.790> pvp<00:00:42.210> guys<00:00:42.390> so<00:00:42.600> I'm<00:00:42.690> not<00:00:42.780> really<00:00:42.899> gonna<00:00:43.079> play

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
a pvp guys so I'm not really gonna play

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.680 
a pvp guys so I'm not really gonna play
pvp<00:00:43.590> just<00:00:43.890> for<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.460> sake<00:00:44.670> of<00:00:44.700> it<00:00:44.879> but<00:00:45.059> this<00:00:45.510> is

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
pvp just for the sake of it but this is

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.139 
pvp just for the sake of it but this is
a<00:00:45.719> PVE<00:00:46.200> review<00:00:46.860> and<00:00:47.280> what<00:00:47.520> my<00:00:47.670> thoughts<00:00:47.940> are<00:00:48.090> on

releasing this but uh let's go for a
thousand<00:00:57.510> lights<00:00:57.660> because<00:00:57.780> this<00:00:57.989> weapon<00:00:58.289> is

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.290 
thousand lights because this weapon is
absolute<00:00:59.070> phenomenal<00:00:59.579> and<00:00:59.699> you<00:01:00.120> should

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
absolute phenomenal and you should

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.910 
absolute phenomenal and you should
definitely<00:01:00.629> be<00:01:00.989> trying<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.500> get<00:01:01.649> it<00:01:01.739> because

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
definitely be trying to get it because

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.830 
definitely be trying to get it because
it<00:01:02.070> is<00:01:02.280> a<00:01:02.309> pretty<00:01:02.550> good<00:01:02.730> weapon<00:01:03.030> so<00:01:03.390> straight

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
it is a pretty good weapon so straight

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.630 
it is a pretty good weapon so straight
up<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.080> gate<00:01:04.260> a<00:01:04.290> weapon<00:01:04.860> obviously<00:01:05.159> does<00:01:05.339> void

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
up the gate a weapon obviously does void

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.280 
up the gate a weapon obviously does void
damage<00:01:06.180> so<00:01:06.360> it<00:01:06.510> is<00:01:06.600> very<00:01:06.750> effective<00:01:07.110> against

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
damage so it is very effective against

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.719 
damage so it is very effective against
the<00:01:07.439> vex<00:01:07.740> enemies<00:01:08.070> this<00:01:08.220> is<00:01:08.310> actually<00:01:08.549> one<00:01:08.700> of

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
the vex enemies this is actually one of

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.340 
the vex enemies this is actually one of
the<00:01:08.850> drawbacks<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.450> weapon<00:01:09.689> just<00:01:10.049> because

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
the drawbacks to the weapon just because

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.840 
the drawbacks to the weapon just because
there's<00:01:10.500> really<00:01:10.680> not<00:01:10.920> a<00:01:10.979> lot<00:01:11.100> of<00:01:11.220> void<00:01:11.490> damage

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
there's really not a lot of void damage

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.940 
there's really not a lot of void damage
shields<00:01:12.210> out<00:01:12.330> there<00:01:12.630> but<00:01:12.960> it's<00:01:13.380> it's<00:01:13.740> still

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
shields out there but it's it's still

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.230 
shields out there but it's it's still
pretty<00:01:14.130> good<00:01:14.400> at<00:01:14.520> doing<00:01:14.790> what<00:01:14.820> it<00:01:15.060> really

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
pretty good at doing what it really

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.460 
pretty good at doing what it really
needs<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:15.570> do<00:01:15.689> and<00:01:15.780> it's<00:01:15.900> also<00:01:16.049> really<00:01:16.320> good

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
needs to do and it's also really good

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:17.929 
needs to do and it's also really good
for<00:01:16.530> getting<00:01:16.710> those<00:01:16.890> void<00:01:17.130> damage<00:01:17.460> kills<00:01:17.729> in

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
for getting those void damage kills in

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.880 
for getting those void damage kills in
the<00:01:18.090> crucible<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.570> get<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.780> thorn<00:01:19.049> yeah<00:01:19.350> but

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.109 
the crucible to get the thorn yeah but
anyways<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.340> first<00:01:20.549> up<00:01:20.729> first<00:01:21.000> ladder

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
anyways the first up first ladder

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.640 
anyways the first up first ladder
obviously<00:01:21.540> is<00:01:21.689> these<00:01:21.869> different<00:01:22.259> sites<00:01:22.500> I

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
obviously is these different sites I

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:23.929 
obviously is these different sites I
don't<00:01:22.799> really<00:01:22.920> matter<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.280> first<00:01:23.430> ones<00:01:23.580> blue

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
don't really matter the first ones blue

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.120 
don't really matter the first ones blue
and<00:01:24.180> it's<00:01:24.270> got<00:01:24.450> angle<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.470> second<00:01:25.830> one<00:01:25.950> is<00:01:25.979> a

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
and it's got angle the second one is a

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.460 
and it's got angle the second one is a
straight<00:01:26.729> up<00:01:26.759> vertical<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.780> last<00:01:28.020> one<00:01:28.229> is<00:01:28.439> a

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
straight up vertical and last one is a

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.590 
straight up vertical and last one is a
the<00:01:29.280> another<00:01:29.640> angled<00:01:30.060> one<00:01:30.210> but<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:30.540> the

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
the another angled one but and the

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.210 
the another angled one but and the
second<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.409> second<00:01:31.650> two<00:01:31.710> are<00:01:31.799> actually<00:01:32.040> read

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
second the second two are actually read

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.260 
second the second two are actually read
they're<00:01:32.369> really<00:01:32.549> not<00:01:32.670> much<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:32.970> difference

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
they're really not much the difference

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.700 
they're really not much the difference
change<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.630> reload<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:34.079> range<00:01:34.290> that's<00:01:34.530> just

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
change the reload and range that's just

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.260 
change the reload and range that's just
kind<00:01:34.950> of<00:01:34.979> bullshit<00:01:35.430> I<00:01:35.490> just<00:01:35.640> use<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.909> last<00:01:36.090> one

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
kind of bullshit I just use the last one

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.940 
kind of bullshit I just use the last one
because<00:01:36.630> I<00:01:36.780> like<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.079> way<00:01:37.170> it<00:01:37.229> looks<00:01:37.290> Zen

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
because I like the way it looks Zen

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.590 
because I like the way it looks Zen

increases its stability stability is
really<00:01:41.280> not<00:01:41.460> important<00:01:41.820> with<00:01:41.909> this<00:01:41.939> weapon

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
really not important with this weapon

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
standard upgrade to the damage and then

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.289 
standard upgrade to the damage and then
we<00:01:46.500> move<00:01:46.680> on<00:01:46.829> to<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.159> second<00:01:47.670> ladder<00:01:47.970> the

we move on to the second ladder the

this<00:01:51.119> weapon<00:01:51.420> quickly<00:01:51.720> it<00:01:51.810> doesn't<00:01:52.140> actually

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
this weapon quickly it doesn't actually

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.080 
this weapon quickly it doesn't actually
increase<00:01:52.649> its<00:01:52.829> reload<00:01:53.100> by<00:01:53.310> much<00:01:53.610> I<00:01:53.790> did<00:01:53.909> a<00:01:53.939> bit

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
increase its reload by much I did a bit

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.880 
increase its reload by much I did a bit
of<00:01:54.149> a<00:01:54.240> testing<00:01:54.659> with<00:01:54.930> it<00:01:55.079> and<00:01:55.259> with<00:01:55.590> it<00:01:55.740> ah

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
of a testing with it and with it ah

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.770 
of a testing with it and with it ah
without<00:01:56.369> it<00:01:56.520> on<00:01:56.640> it<00:01:56.939> is<00:01:57.090> a<00:01:57.119> little<00:01:57.420> bit<00:01:57.570> faster

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
without it on it is a little bit faster

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.050 
without it on it is a little bit faster
but<00:01:58.170> it's<00:01:58.320> just<00:01:58.439> really<00:01:58.590> not<00:01:58.799> that<00:01:58.950> fast<00:01:59.159> it<00:01:59.850> is

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
but it's just really not that fast it is

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.730 
but it's just really not that fast it is
a<00:02:00.090> viable<00:02:00.450> option<00:02:00.750> but<00:02:01.170> not<00:02:01.259> that<00:02:01.380> fast<00:02:01.439> to

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
a viable option but not that fast to

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:02.840 
a viable option but not that fast to
really<00:02:01.950> worry<00:02:02.070> about<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.460> second<00:02:02.759> one

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
really worry about the second one

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.340 
really worry about the second one
improves<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.270> range<00:02:03.450> and<00:02:03.540> accuracy<00:02:03.869> this<00:02:04.200> one

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
improves the range and accuracy this one

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.530 
improves the range and accuracy this one
doubles<00:02:04.710> its<00:02:04.890> range<00:02:05.130> so<00:02:05.700> if<00:02:05.759> you<00:02:05.880> are<00:02:06.060> facing<00:02:06.299> a

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
doubles its range so if you are facing a

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:07.910 
doubles its range so if you are facing a
lot<00:02:06.659> of<00:02:06.810> a<00:02:06.899> long-range<00:02:07.320> stuff<00:02:07.649> this<00:02:07.770> is

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
lot of a long-range stuff this is

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.740 
lot of a long-range stuff this is
actually<00:02:08.220> a<00:02:08.280> pretty<00:02:08.459> decent<00:02:08.759> perk<00:02:09.360> as<00:02:09.479> well<00:02:09.629> as

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
actually a pretty decent perk as well as

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:10.760 
actually a pretty decent perk as well as
effect<00:02:09.989> with<00:02:10.140> Zen<00:02:10.379> moment

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
effect with Zen moment

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.050 
effect with Zen moment
you<00:02:11.010> can<00:02:11.130> actually<00:02:11.400> increase<00:02:11.670> its<00:02:11.880> stability

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
you can actually increase its stability

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.520 
you can actually increase its stability
all<00:02:12.450> that<00:02:12.570> stuff<00:02:12.750> so<00:02:12.780> that's<00:02:13.080> pretty<00:02:13.260> good<00:02:13.410> one

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
all that stuff so that's pretty good one

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.990 
all that stuff so that's pretty good one
but<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:13.950> last<00:02:14.220> one<00:02:14.370> is<00:02:14.580> the<00:02:14.610> 1i<00:02:14.790> like

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
but the last one is the 1i like

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.490 
but the last one is the 1i like
explosive<00:02:15.810> rounds<00:02:16.020> on<00:02:16.110> the<00:02:16.140> weapon<00:02:16.290> which

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
explosive rounds on the weapon which

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.990 
explosive rounds on the weapon which
makes<00:02:16.740> it<00:02:16.860> like<00:02:17.040> the<00:02:17.160> fight<00:02:17.340> fate<00:02:17.550> bringer<00:02:17.820> a

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
makes it like the fight fate bringer a

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.120 
makes it like the fight fate bringer a
lot<00:02:18.780> of<00:02:18.900> you<00:02:18.990> guys<00:02:19.020> say<00:02:19.350> it<00:02:19.500> doesn't<00:02:19.740> do<00:02:19.800> more

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
lot of you guys say it doesn't do more

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:21.290 
lot of you guys say it doesn't do more
damage<00:02:20.340> with<00:02:20.520> the<00:02:20.670> explosive<00:02:20.940> round<00:02:21.180> it

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
damage with the explosive round it

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.640 
damage with the explosive round it
actually<00:02:21.510> takes<00:02:21.660> away<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:22.140> initial<00:02:22.500> damage

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
actually takes away the initial damage

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.200 
actually takes away the initial damage
and<00:02:22.890> puts<00:02:23.040> it<00:02:23.130> on<00:02:23.220> explicit<00:02:23.640> damage<00:02:23.970> but<00:02:24.120> I

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
and puts it on explicit damage but I

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:25.910 
and puts it on explicit damage but I
don't<00:02:24.390> care<00:02:24.480> what<00:02:24.630> you<00:02:24.780> say<00:02:24.990> then<00:02:25.170> knock<00:02:25.680> back

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
don't care what you say then knock back

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.620 
don't care what you say then knock back
and<00:02:26.160> making<00:02:26.430> them<00:02:26.520> real<00:02:26.790> back<00:02:27.030> and<00:02:27.270> stuff<00:02:27.480> with

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
and making them real back and stuff with

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:28.880 
and making them real back and stuff with
the<00:02:27.720> explosive<00:02:28.170> rounds<00:02:28.470> and<00:02:28.590> not<00:02:28.740> being

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
the explosive rounds and not being

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.190 
the explosive rounds and not being
having<00:02:29.070> to<00:02:29.390> exactly<00:02:30.390> aim<00:02:30.630> for<00:02:30.840> the<00:02:30.900> critical

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
having to exactly aim for the critical

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.560 
having to exactly aim for the critical
is<00:02:31.320> just<00:02:31.500> so<00:02:31.890> so<00:02:32.160> important<00:02:32.640> because<00:02:33.180> I<00:02:33.390> think

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
is just so so important because I think

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:34.790 
is just so so important because I think
it<00:02:33.660> does<00:02:33.750> more<00:02:33.960> damage<00:02:34.020> you've<00:02:34.410> hit<00:02:34.560> them<00:02:34.710> in

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
it does more damage you've hit them in

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.040 
it does more damage you've hit them in
the<00:02:34.830> body<00:02:35.130> of<00:02:35.280> versus<00:02:36.090> actually<00:02:36.660> the<00:02:36.750> critical

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
the body of versus actually the critical

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.420 
the body of versus actually the critical
if<00:02:37.170> you<00:02:37.320> do<00:02:37.440> critical<00:02:37.830> hit<00:02:37.950> it<00:02:38.130> does<00:02:38.280> more

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
if you do critical hit it does more

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.010 
if you do critical hit it does more
damage<00:02:38.460> without<00:02:38.850> explosive<00:02:39.450> but<00:02:39.780> if<00:02:39.840> you<00:02:39.900> hit

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
damage without explosive but if you hit

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.360 
damage without explosive but if you hit
them<00:02:40.110> in<00:02:40.260> the<00:02:40.290> body<00:02:40.680> I<00:02:40.800> figured<00:02:41.130> out<00:02:41.220> that's

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
them in the body I figured out that's

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:42.710 
them in the body I figured out that's
why<00:02:41.580> it<00:02:41.640> does<00:02:41.790> it<00:02:42.000> feels<00:02:42.210> like<00:02:42.330> it<00:02:42.450> does<00:02:42.540> more

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
why it does it feels like it does more

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.390 
why it does it feels like it does more
damage<00:02:42.750> normally<00:02:43.710> feed<00:02:43.860> them<00:02:43.980> the<00:02:44.130> body<00:02:44.280> you

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
damage normally feed them the body you

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.740 
damage normally feed them the body you
do<00:02:44.490> like<00:02:44.670> foreign<00:02:44.910> or<00:02:45.000> damage<00:02:45.270> with<00:02:45.420> it<00:02:45.570> else

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
do like foreign or damage with it else

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.570 
do like foreign or damage with it else
it<00:02:46.050> does<00:02:46.230> the<00:02:46.410> standard<00:02:47.010> foreign<00:02:47.250> or<00:02:47.340> damage

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
it does the standard foreign or damage

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.190 
it does the standard foreign or damage
plus<00:02:47.850> the<00:02:48.000> explosive<00:02:48.450> damage<00:02:48.510> doesn't<00:02:48.900> care

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
plus the explosive damage doesn't care

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.810 
plus the explosive damage doesn't care
whether<00:02:49.680> or<00:02:49.800> not<00:02:49.890> has<00:02:50.070> critical<00:02:50.490> hit<00:02:50.610> or<00:02:50.700> not

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
whether or not has critical hit or not

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.670 
whether or not has critical hit or not
so<00:02:51.030> that's<00:02:51.210> why<00:02:51.330> the<00:02:51.750> critical<00:02:52.110> hit<00:02:52.260> does<00:02:52.440> more

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
so that's why the critical hit does more

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.610 
so that's why the critical hit does more
damage<00:02:52.710> with<00:02:53.490> the<00:02:54.090> with<00:02:54.570> with<00:02:55.020> the<00:02:55.380> explosive

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
damage with the with with the explosive

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.050 
damage with the with with the explosive
damage<00:02:55.860> with<00:02:56.220> a<00:02:56.250> non<00:02:56.550> critical<00:02:56.730> hit<00:02:56.970> the

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
damage with a non critical hit the

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.640 
damage with a non critical hit the
explosive<00:02:57.420> damage<00:02:57.480> was<00:02:57.780> more<00:02:58.050> body<00:02:58.380> damage

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
explosive damage was more body damage

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.530 
explosive damage was more body damage
and<00:02:58.920> really<00:02:59.490> I<00:02:59.580> love<00:02:59.820> to<00:02:59.910> spraying<00:03:00.270> into<00:03:00.450> a

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
and really I love to spraying into a

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:01.850 
and really I love to spraying into a

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
group of enemies and get actually

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.170 
group of enemies and get actually
ripping<00:03:02.130> them<00:03:02.310> apart<00:03:02.340> and<00:03:02.610> critical<00:03:02.940> them<00:03:03.030> to

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
ripping them apart and critical them to

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.550 
ripping them apart and critical them to
hit<00:03:03.300> them<00:03:03.450> as<00:03:03.480> usually<00:03:03.900> does<00:03:04.080> enough<00:03:04.320> to<00:03:04.410> kill

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560

can give this with a lot of bullets

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.410 
can give this with a lot of bullets
starts<00:03:34.410> with<00:03:34.530> 12<00:03:34.800> so<00:03:35.550> if<00:03:35.610> you<00:03:35.730> you<00:03:36.060> can<00:03:36.180> get<00:03:36.330> an

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
starts with 12 so if you you can get an

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:37.910 
starts with 12 so if you you can get an
extra<00:03:36.510> like<00:03:36.780> four<00:03:37.050> rounds<00:03:37.380> into<00:03:37.530> it<00:03:37.680> and<00:03:37.800> maybe

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
extra like four rounds into it and maybe

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
an extra fifth round so you technically

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.290 
an extra fifth round so you technically
can<00:03:39.990> have<00:03:40.080> like<00:03:40.200> 17<00:03:40.830> rounds<00:03:41.070> in<00:03:41.340> this<00:03:41.459> thing<00:03:41.670> if

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:42.300 
can have like 17 rounds in this thing if

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.180 
can have like 17 rounds in this thing if
you<00:03:42.480> get<00:03:42.660> that<00:03:42.780> phantom<00:03:43.260> a<00:03:43.380> gift<00:03:43.709> every<00:03:44.010> single

compared to the original a lot of 12 if

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.070 
compared to the original a lot of 12 if
you're<00:03:48.060> actually<00:03:48.240> just<00:03:48.570> shooting<00:03:48.840> for<00:03:48.959> those

spittle headset especially if you're on
a<00:03:50.400> boss<00:03:50.640> you<00:03:51.300> really<00:03:51.600> can't<00:03:51.780> get<00:03:51.900> a<00:03:51.930> lot<00:03:52.230> of

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
a boss you really can't get a lot of

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.720 
a boss you really can't get a lot of
shots<00:03:52.590> down<00:03:52.830> range<00:03:53.100> so<00:03:53.310> this<00:03:53.490> is<00:03:53.580> probably

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
shots down range so this is probably

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:54.920 
shots down range so this is probably
really<00:03:53.880> good<00:03:54.030> against<00:03:54.360> those<00:03:54.450> again<00:03:54.780> those

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
really good against those again those

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.650 
really good against those again those
big<00:03:55.140> hitbox<00:03:55.470> boxes<00:03:56.000> like<00:03:57.000> the<00:03:57.180> devil<00:03:57.510> Walker

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
big hitbox boxes like the devil Walker

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.150 
big hitbox boxes like the devil Walker
so<00:03:57.990> Mike<00:03:58.230> it<00:03:58.320> makes<00:03:58.470> you<00:03:58.590> go<00:03:58.680> check<00:03:58.950> that<00:03:59.100> out

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
so Mike it makes you go check that out

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.460 
so Mike it makes you go check that out
and<00:03:59.490> try<00:03:59.790> that<00:03:59.970> one<00:04:00.150> out<00:04:00.180> for<00:04:00.330> yourself<00:04:00.660> all<00:04:01.230> in

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
and try that one out for yourself all in

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.140 
and try that one out for yourself all in
all<00:04:01.680> I<00:04:01.709> think<00:04:01.950> this<00:04:02.280> weapon<00:04:02.670> does<00:04:02.790> a<00:04:02.820> little

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
all I think this weapon does a little

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.210 
all I think this weapon does a little
bit<00:04:03.360> less<00:04:03.630> damage<00:04:04.170> than<00:04:04.200> the<00:04:04.410> Fate<00:04:04.830> bringer<00:04:05.190> I

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
bit less damage than the Fate bringer I

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.949 
bit less damage than the Fate bringer I
haven't<00:04:05.520> exactly<00:04:05.820> compared<00:04:06.270> it<00:04:06.360> directly<00:04:06.780> to

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
haven't exactly compared it directly to

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:08.390 
haven't exactly compared it directly to
it<00:04:07.080> but<00:04:07.200> from<00:04:07.320> what<00:04:07.410> I<00:04:07.470> can<00:04:07.560> see<00:04:07.709> the<00:04:08.010> critical

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
it but from what I can see the critical

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.280 
it but from what I can see the critical
hit<00:04:08.550> damage<00:04:08.580> is<00:04:09.360> a<00:04:09.420> little<00:04:09.750> bit<00:04:09.840> lower<00:04:10.080> than

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
hit damage is a little bit lower than

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:11.720 
hit damage is a little bit lower than
what<00:04:10.560> I'm<00:04:10.650> used<00:04:10.709> to<00:04:11.100> in<00:04:11.280> the<00:04:11.310> damage<00:04:11.610> in

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
what I'm used to in the damage in

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.729 
what I'm used to in the damage in
general<00:04:12.060> but<00:04:12.209> overall<00:04:12.900> this<00:04:13.110> weapon<00:04:13.440> is<00:04:13.530> just

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
general but overall this weapon is just

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:15.440 
general but overall this weapon is just
still<00:04:14.040> a<00:04:14.220> beast<00:04:14.580> I<00:04:14.760> think<00:04:14.940> of<00:04:15.030> one<00:04:15.209> or<00:04:15.330> two

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
still a beast I think of one or two

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.320 
still a beast I think of one or two
shots<00:04:15.720> level<00:04:16.049> 30<00:04:16.290> minute<00:04:17.100> or<00:04:17.250> shields<00:04:17.880> which

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:18.330 
shots level 30 minute or shields which

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:20.150 
shots level 30 minute or shields which
is<00:04:18.480> pretty<00:04:18.660> insane<00:04:19.080> and<00:04:19.710> it<00:04:19.799> does<00:04:19.919> fantastic

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
is pretty insane and it does fantastic

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.860 
is pretty insane and it does fantastic
damage<00:04:20.790> against<00:04:21.060> everything<00:04:21.330> else<00:04:21.600> so<00:04:21.810> if

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
damage against everything else so if

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.150 
damage against everything else so if
there's<00:04:22.020> something<00:04:22.200> that<00:04:22.320> needs<00:04:22.440> boy<00:04:22.770> damage

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
there's something that needs boy damage

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:23.760 
there's something that needs boy damage

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:56.999 
loving it in general I would say this
gun<00:04:54.940> is<00:04:55.120> more<00:04:55.509> of<00:04:55.659> a<00:04:55.780> close<00:04:56.110> to<00:04:56.409> mid<00:04:56.770> and

00:04:56.999 --> 00:04:57.009 
gun is more of a close to mid and

00:04:57.009 --> 00:04:59.070 
gun is more of a close to mid and
somewhat<00:04:57.669> long-range<00:04:58.210> weapons<00:04:58.630> is<00:04:58.810> a<00:04:58.840> very

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
somewhat long-range weapons is a very

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.899 
somewhat long-range weapons is a very
versatile<00:04:59.530> weapon<00:04:59.800> as<00:05:00.130> a<00:05:00.159> hand<00:05:00.430> cannon<00:05:00.639> again

00:05:00.899 --> 00:05:00.909 
versatile weapon as a hand cannon again

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:02.730 
versatile weapon as a hand cannon again
to<00:05:01.030> say<00:05:01.180> one<00:05:01.389> shot<00:05:01.630> and<00:05:02.259> the<00:05:02.349> cool<00:05:02.560> thing<00:05:02.590> about

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
to say one shot and the cool thing about

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.050 
to say one shot and the cool thing about
this<00:05:03.009> weapon<00:05:03.310> i<00:05:03.340> have<00:05:03.430> to<00:05:03.520> say<00:05:03.699> is<00:05:03.729> that<00:05:03.849> its

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.060 
this weapon i have to say is that its

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:05.580 
this weapon i have to say is that its
stability<00:05:04.210> really<00:05:04.720> doesn't<00:05:05.110> really<00:05:05.289> matter

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
stability really doesn't really matter

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:07.320 
stability really doesn't really matter
because<00:05:05.800> its<00:05:06.039> fire<00:05:06.280> is<00:05:06.550> slow<00:05:06.789> enough<00:05:06.819> that<00:05:07.060> it

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:07.330 
because its fire is slow enough that it

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.180 
because its fire is slow enough that it
you<00:05:07.840> literally<00:05:08.110> can't<00:05:08.440> fire<00:05:08.710> it<00:05:08.860> fast<00:05:09.069> enough

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:09.190 
you literally can't fire it fast enough

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:11.640 
you literally can't fire it fast enough
for<00:05:09.550> it<00:05:09.610> to<00:05:09.639> recenter<00:05:10.270> so<00:05:10.449> it<00:05:10.630> pops<00:05:11.139> off<00:05:11.349> into<00:05:11.620> a

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:11.650 
for it to recenter so it pops off into a

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:13.649 
for it to recenter so it pops off into a
direction<00:05:11.919> re<00:05:12.490> centers<00:05:12.849> back<00:05:13.060> on<00:05:13.240> his<00:05:13.330> target

00:05:13.649 --> 00:05:13.659 
direction re centers back on his target

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:15.240 
direction re centers back on his target
before<00:05:13.690> it's<00:05:14.110> able<00:05:14.199> to<00:05:14.349> fire<00:05:14.500> again<00:05:14.620> so<00:05:14.889> that's

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:15.250 
before it's able to fire again so that's

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:16.469 
before it's able to fire again so that's
not<00:05:15.460> really<00:05:15.580> that<00:05:15.699> much<00:05:15.909> of<00:05:15.940> an<00:05:16.120> issue<00:05:16.210> that's

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:16.479 
not really that much of an issue that's

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:18.779 
not really that much of an issue that's
a<00:05:16.599> good<00:05:16.810> combo<00:05:17.289> to<00:05:17.349> having<00:05:17.680> a<00:05:17.770> gun<00:05:17.949> and<00:05:18.610> again

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:18.789 
a good combo to having a gun and again

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:20.010 
a good combo to having a gun and again
it's<00:05:18.909> just<00:05:19.030> super<00:05:19.300> duper<00:05:19.539> effective<00:05:19.930> at

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:20.020 
it's just super duper effective at

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:21.270 
it's just super duper effective at
killing<00:05:20.169> your<00:05:20.380> enemies<00:05:20.500> and<00:05:20.740> explosive

moved in on like I'm a good I destroy
all<00:05:28.599> evil<00:05:28.990> and<00:05:29.349> oh<00:05:29.590> god<00:05:30.340> I<00:05:30.400> had<00:05:30.639> a<00:05:30.669> lot<00:05:30.849> of<00:05:30.880> fun

all evil and oh god I had a lot of fun

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:32.339 
all evil and oh god I had a lot of fun
with<00:05:31.210> it<00:05:31.330> one<00:05:31.719> thing<00:05:31.870> I<00:05:31.960> would<00:05:32.020> say<00:05:32.110> obviously

00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:32.349 
with it one thing I would say obviously

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:34.920 
with it one thing I would say obviously
I<00:05:32.590> would<00:05:32.740> pair<00:05:33.039> this<00:05:33.250> one<00:05:33.460> with<00:05:34.300> a<00:05:34.330> sniper

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:34.930 
I would pair this one with a sniper

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:36.420 
I would pair this one with a sniper
rifle<00:05:35.110> I'd<00:05:35.380> say<00:05:35.590> just<00:05:35.830> because<00:05:35.949> the<00:05:36.190> fact<00:05:36.340> that

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:36.430 
rifle I'd say just because the fact that

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:38.309 
rifle I'd say just because the fact that
does<00:05:36.639> not<00:05:36.789> have<00:05:37.000> a<00:05:37.030> really<00:05:37.719> really<00:05:37.960> good

00:05:38.309 --> 00:05:38.319 
does not have a really really good

00:05:38.319 --> 00:05:40.680 
does not have a really really good
long-range<00:05:38.830> capabilities<00:05:39.300> when<00:05:40.300> it<00:05:40.389> comes<00:05:40.569> to

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:40.690 
long-range capabilities when it comes to

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:41.879 
long-range capabilities when it comes to
bosses<00:05:41.080> you<00:05:41.139> definitely<00:05:41.409> like<00:05:41.710> an<00:05:41.770> ice

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:41.889 
bosses you definitely like an ice

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:43.469 
bosses you definitely like an ice
breaker<00:05:42.069> go<00:05:42.370> long-range<00:05:42.849> get<00:05:43.029> those<00:05:43.150> critical

00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:43.479 
breaker go long-range get those critical

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:45.420 
breaker go long-range get those critical
hits<00:05:43.630> I'm<00:05:44.110> absolutely<00:05:44.349> wrecked<00:05:45.159> with<00:05:45.310> it

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:45.430 
hits I'm absolutely wrecked with it

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:46.860 
hits I'm absolutely wrecked with it
otherwise<00:05:45.639> this<00:05:46.210> gun<00:05:46.419> is<00:05:46.449> just<00:05:46.719> very

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:46.870 
otherwise this gun is just very

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:48.659 
otherwise this gun is just very
versatile<00:05:47.380> and<00:05:48.009> again<00:05:48.219> that's<00:05:48.310> just<00:05:48.460> my

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:48.669 
versatile and again that's just my

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:50.100 
versatile and again that's just my
recommendations<00:05:49.270> because<00:05:49.449> I've<00:05:49.690> been<00:05:49.719> more

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.110 
recommendations because I've been more

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:51.749 
recommendations because I've been more
into<00:05:50.289> these<00:05:50.409> sniper<00:05:50.949> rifles<00:05:51.250> recently<00:05:51.610> but

00:05:51.749 --> 00:05:51.759 
into these sniper rifles recently but

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:53.490 
into these sniper rifles recently but
you<00:05:51.819> can<00:05:51.969> basically<00:05:52.240> have<00:05:52.479> whatever<00:05:52.750> you<00:05:53.169> want

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:53.500 
you can basically have whatever you want

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.409 
you can basically have whatever you want
and<00:05:54.069> again<00:05:54.310> the<00:05:54.460> last<00:05:54.699> upgrade<00:05:54.909> on<00:05:55.150> this<00:05:55.180> one

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:55.419 
and again the last upgrade on this one

00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:56.879 
and again the last upgrade on this one
is<00:05:55.539> it<00:05:55.690> makes<00:05:55.870> it<00:05:55.960> so<00:05:56.050> you<00:05:56.110> hive<00:05:56.319> disruptor<00:05:56.770> so

00:05:56.879 --> 00:05:56.889 
is it makes it so you hive disruptor so

00:05:56.889 --> 00:05:58.200 
is it makes it so you hive disruptor so
this<00:05:57.039> thing<00:05:57.190> does<00:05:57.310> a<00:05:57.340> lot<00:05:57.580> of<00:05:57.639> damage<00:05:57.880> against

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:58.210 
this thing does a lot of damage against

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:00.809 
this thing does a lot of damage against
high<00:05:58.330> of<00:05:58.389> majors<00:05:58.750> there's<00:05:59.680> not<00:05:59.800> a<00:05:59.860> lot<00:06:00.069> of<00:06:00.099> void

00:06:00.809 --> 00:06:00.819 
high of majors there's not a lot of void

00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:02.490 
high of majors there's not a lot of void
hive<00:06:01.270> majors<00:06:01.659> I<00:06:01.840> don't<00:06:02.050> think<00:06:02.199> there's<00:06:02.319> any

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:02.500 
hive majors I don't think there's any

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:04.379 
hive majors I don't think there's any
impact<00:06:02.919> so<00:06:03.430> this<00:06:03.580> is<00:06:03.789> not<00:06:03.969> really<00:06:04.150> a<00:06:04.240> good

00:06:04.379 --> 00:06:04.389 
impact so this is not really a good

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:06.149 
impact so this is not really a good
weapon<00:06:04.539> for<00:06:04.690> killing<00:06:04.990> at<00:06:05.110> majors<00:06:05.409> but<00:06:05.529> hey<00:06:05.919> if

the game I wouldn't say it's in top five

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:22.080 
the game I wouldn't say it's in top five
because<00:06:20.949> of<00:06:21.069> you<00:06:21.190> know<00:06:21.279> the<00:06:21.310> top<00:06:21.639> five<00:06:21.819> is<00:06:21.940> kind
