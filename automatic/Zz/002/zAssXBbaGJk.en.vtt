00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
into making this thing so there is a

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.319 
into making this thing so there is a
word<00:00:33.809> there<00:00:34.260> it's<00:00:35.219> this<00:00:35.489> is<00:00:35.640> a<00:00:35.670> very<00:00:35.969> simple

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
word there it's this is a very simple

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:37.760 
word there it's this is a very simple
way<00:00:36.420> it<00:00:36.510> doesn't<00:00:36.690> take<00:00:36.870> very<00:00:36.989> much<00:00:37.260> material

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770
