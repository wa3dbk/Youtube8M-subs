00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
let's see how it goes

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.059 
let's see how it goes
hopefully<00:02:33.450> hopefully<00:02:34.260> you<00:02:34.650> might<00:02:34.799> be<00:02:34.890> able<00:02:34.950> to

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
hopefully hopefully you might be able to

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:36.679 
hopefully hopefully you might be able to
get<00:02:35.189> if<00:02:35.370> we<00:02:35.430> can't<00:02:35.819> win<00:02:35.970> on<00:02:36.000> normal<00:02:36.329> maybe<00:02:36.569> we

00:02:36.679 --> 00:02:36.689 
get if we can't win on normal maybe we

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:38.000 
get if we can't win on normal maybe we
can<00:02:36.810> win<00:02:36.930> on<00:02:36.959> inverse<00:02:37.319> that's<00:02:37.650> that's<00:02:37.890> my

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
can win on inverse that's that's my

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.349 
can win on inverse that's that's my
that's<00:02:38.220> my<00:02:38.310> thought<00:02:38.609> processes<00:02:38.970> going<00:02:39.269> on

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:39.359 
that's my thought processes going on
