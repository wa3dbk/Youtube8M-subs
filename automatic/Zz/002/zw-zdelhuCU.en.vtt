so just to quickly show you how to do it
again<00:02:16.980> once<00:02:17.980> you've<00:02:18.270> taken<00:02:19.270> it<00:02:19.480> back<00:02:19.630> off<00:02:19.750> the

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
again once you've taken it back off the

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.350 
again once you've taken it back off the
bookshelf<00:02:20.020> click<00:02:20.590> a<00:02:22.410> then<00:02:23.700> move<00:02:24.700> across<00:02:24.820> this

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
bookshelf click a then move across this

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.540 
bookshelf click a then move across this
time<00:02:25.630> to<00:02:25.870> the<00:02:26.020> middle<00:02:26.410> one<00:02:26.560> this<00:02:27.010> is<00:02:27.220> just<00:02:27.400> what

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
time to the middle one this is just what

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.960 
time to the middle one this is just what
I<00:02:27.610> do

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
I do

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.420 
I do
and<00:02:29.370> you<00:02:30.370> get<00:02:30.610> all<00:02:30.850> your<00:02:30.880> levels<00:02:31.210> up<00:02:31.630> again<00:02:32.200> and

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
and you get all your levels up again and

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.890 
and you get all your levels up again and
as<00:02:33.430> you<00:02:33.550> can<00:02:33.700> see<00:02:33.760> my<00:02:34.030> level<00:02:34.300> progress<00:02:34.690> already

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
as you can see my level progress already

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.710 
as you can see my level progress already
leveled<00:02:35.500> up<00:02:35.620> from<00:02:35.830> the<00:02:35.920> last<00:02:36.130> one<00:02:36.340> and<00:02:36.720> this

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
leveled up from the last one and this

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.990 
leveled up from the last one and this
basically<00:02:38.350> levels<00:02:38.920> up<00:02:39.040> every<00:02:39.459> time<00:02:39.640> you<00:02:39.700> do

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
basically levels up every time you do

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.190 
basically levels up every time you do
this<00:02:40.150> glitch<00:02:40.450> and<00:02:41.970> keeps<00:02:42.970> increasing<00:02:43.390> all

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200
