00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
manual thought you up with a brief we're

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.820 
manual thought you up with a brief we're
taking<00:00:17.160> the<00:00:17.539> top<00:00:18.539> cover<00:00:18.840> off<00:00:18.960> of<00:00:19.320> it<00:00:19.439> right

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
taking the top cover off of it right

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.419 
taking the top cover off of it right
over<00:00:20.189> on<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.400> side<00:00:20.640> here<00:00:22.010> to<00:00:23.210> get<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.359> air<00:00:24.510> box

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:25.429 
over on the side here to get the air box

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:33.889 
over on the side here to get the air box
out<00:00:26.429> of<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.640> way<00:00:32.360> after<00:00:33.360> that<00:00:33.540> you<00:00:33.690> want<00:00:33.840> to

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
out of the way after that you want to

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.680 
out of the way after that you want to
take<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.489> battery<00:00:35.489> out<00:00:35.579> as<00:00:35.969> well<00:00:36.239> just

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
take the battery out as well just

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.889 
take the battery out as well just
connect<00:00:37.370> negative<00:00:38.370> force<00:00:38.730> and<00:00:39.210> positive<00:00:39.690> they

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
connect negative force and positive they

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:47.540 
connect negative force and positive they
get<00:00:40.230> that<00:00:40.379> out<00:00:40.559> of<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.680> way<00:00:44.510> all<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.719> way<00:00:46.550> you

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
get that out of the way all the way you

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.340 
get that out of the way all the way you
could<00:00:47.730> remove<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.390> bracket<00:00:48.780> underneath<00:00:49.020> this

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
could remove the bracket underneath this

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.680 
could remove the bracket underneath this
tray<00:00:50.070> but<00:00:51.030> uh<00:00:51.260> probably<00:00:52.260> won't<00:00:52.469> have<00:00:52.680> to

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
tray but uh probably won't have to

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.180 
tray but uh probably won't have to
necessarily<00:00:54.690> completely<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:55.710> give<00:00:56.010> you<00:00:56.129> a

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
necessarily completely and give you a

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.279 
necessarily completely and give you a
little<00:00:56.399> more<00:00:56.520> elbow<00:00:56.730> room<00:00:56.910> but<00:00:57.359> it's<00:00:57.870> about<00:00:58.050> it

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
little more elbow room but it's about it

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.500 
little more elbow room but it's about it
gonna<00:00:59.070> disconnect<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.730> holes<00:00:59.940> is<00:01:00.149> up<00:01:00.329> here

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
gonna disconnect the holes is up here

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.740 
gonna disconnect the holes is up here
they<00:01:00.629> go<00:01:00.750> onto<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.109> bridge<00:01:01.320> to<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:02.539> tube<00:01:03.539> on

the throttle bodies ah
couple<00:01:06.750> of<00:01:06.840> switches<00:01:07.020> down<00:01:07.350> here<00:01:07.560> I'm<00:01:07.710> gonna

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
couple of switches down here I'm gonna

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.260 
couple of switches down here I'm gonna
go<00:01:08.010> through<00:01:08.250> those<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:08.670> how<00:01:08.760> to<00:01:08.820> disconnect

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
go through those and how to disconnect

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.620 
go through those and how to disconnect
them<00:01:10.430> right<00:01:11.430> onto<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.850> transmission<00:01:12.090> that's

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
them right onto the transmission that's

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:13.820 
them right onto the transmission that's
the<00:01:12.720> transmission<00:01:13.290> there<00:01:13.440> you're<00:01:13.560> gonna<00:01:13.650> get

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
the transmission there you're gonna get

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.560 
the transmission there you're gonna get
the<00:01:13.980> linkage<00:01:14.400> cable<00:01:14.820> when<00:01:14.940> you<00:01:15.000> can<00:01:15.180> just<00:01:15.330> take

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
the linkage cable when you can just take

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.800 
the linkage cable when you can just take
the<00:01:15.720> cable<00:01:16.640> just<00:01:17.640> like<00:01:17.850> here<00:01:18.180> there's<00:01:18.390> a<00:01:18.480> pin

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
the cable just like here there's a pin

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.590 
the cable just like here there's a pin
you<00:01:19.170> can<00:01:20.160> see<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.460> pin<00:01:20.730> right<00:01:21.200> here<00:01:23.390> get<00:01:24.390> this

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
you can see the pin right here get this

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.840 
you can see the pin right here get this
pin<00:01:24.810> up<00:01:25.020> take<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:27.560> shifter<00:01:28.560> cable<00:01:29.340> right<00:01:29.580> off

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.930 
pin up take the shifter cable right off
from<00:01:30.120> the<00:01:30.240> transmission<00:01:31.430> then<00:01:32.430> on<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.760> back

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:32.940 
from the transmission then on the back

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.660 
from the transmission then on the back
here<00:01:33.330> and<00:01:33.360> it's<00:01:33.810> on<00:01:34.220> bracket<00:01:35.220> you<00:01:35.400> don't<00:01:35.550> have

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
here and it's on bracket you don't have

here and it's on bracket you don't have
to<00:01:35.790> take<00:01:35.970> it<00:01:36.000> off<00:01:36.240> of<00:01:36.450> here<00:01:36.750> you<00:01:36.900> can<00:01:37.080> take<00:01:37.260> the

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
to take it off of here you can take the

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.140 
to take it off of here you can take the
whole<00:01:37.530> bracket<00:01:37.890> off<00:01:38.250> is<00:01:38.610> too

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
whole bracket off is too

next video from underneath the

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.900 
next video from underneath the
transmission<00:02:07.130> plug<00:02:08.130> up<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.399> transmission

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
transmission plug up the transmission

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.350 
transmission plug up the transmission
you<00:02:09.210> get<00:02:09.509> a<00:02:09.540> lot<00:02:09.750> of<00:02:09.899> oil<00:02:10.050> seeping<00:02:10.500> out<00:02:10.619> of<00:02:10.679> it

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
you get a lot of oil seeping out of it

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.030 
you get a lot of oil seeping out of it
easiest<00:02:12.360> way<00:02:12.600> would<00:02:12.810> be<00:02:12.870> to<00:02:13.020> drain<00:02:13.800> the

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
easiest way would be to drain the

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.199 
easiest way would be to drain the
transmission<00:02:14.940> oil<00:02:15.320> but<00:02:16.320> uh<00:02:16.350> and<00:02:17.220> I<00:02:17.310> said<00:02:17.580> I'm

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
transmission oil but uh and I said I'm

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.780 
transmission oil but uh and I said I'm
just<00:02:18.240> gonna<00:02:18.660> use<00:02:18.930> transmission<00:02:19.680> plugs<00:02:19.920> plug

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
just gonna use transmission plugs plug

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.000 
just gonna use transmission plugs plug
in<00:02:20.940> the<00:02:21.090> CV<00:02:21.390> axles<00:02:21.840> it's<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:22.770> same

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
in the CV axles it's the same

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.790 
in the CV axles it's the same
transmission<00:02:23.490> oil<00:02:23.790> and<00:02:24.090> then<00:02:24.240> and<00:02:24.930> pull<00:02:25.680> it

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
transmission oil and then and pull it

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.020 
transmission oil and then and pull it
out

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.770 

okay<00:02:30.110> see<00:02:31.110> you<00:02:31.230> next<00:02:31.620> week
