so medic took metagross is out of there

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:47.749 
so medic took metagross is out of there
I'm<00:05:45.929> guest<00:05:46.199> of<00:05:46.709> the<00:05:46.829> way<00:05:46.919> he<00:05:47.099> has<00:05:47.189> serene<00:05:47.549> gray

00:05:47.749 --> 00:05:47.759 
I'm guest of the way he has serene gray

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:49.549 
I'm guest of the way he has serene gray
so<00:05:47.819> I'm<00:05:47.999> guessing<00:05:48.179> he<00:05:48.479> wanted<00:05:48.749> ancient<00:05:49.169> powers

00:05:49.549 --> 00:05:49.559 
so I'm guessing he wanted ancient powers

00:05:49.559 --> 00:05:51.439 
so I'm guessing he wanted ancient powers
boost<00:05:49.860> and<00:05:50.189> stuff<00:05:50.399> but<00:05:50.909> it's<00:05:51.059> only<00:05:51.179> ten

00:05:51.439 --> 00:05:51.449 
boost and stuff but it's only ten

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:53.179 
boost and stuff but it's only ten
percent<00:05:51.539> chance<00:05:51.929> so<00:05:52.679> I<00:05:52.709> get<00:05:52.919> leftovers

00:05:53.179 --> 00:05:53.189 
percent chance so I get leftovers

00:05:53.189 --> 00:05:57.259 
percent chance so I get leftovers
recovery<00:05:53.759> here<00:05:54.089> and<00:05:54.469> yeah<00:05:55.469> some<00:05:56.459> gonna<00:05:56.759> go<00:05:56.969> for

00:05:57.259 --> 00:05:57.269 
recovery here and yeah some gonna go for

00:05:57.269 --> 00:06:00.139 
recovery here and yeah some gonna go for
another<00:05:57.449> dragon<00:05:58.049> claw<00:05:58.229> togekiss<00:05:58.860> and<00:05:59.399> a

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:00.149 
another dragon claw togekiss and a

00:06:00.149 --> 00:06:02.809 
another dragon claw togekiss and a
waterfall<00:06:00.689> and<00:06:00.989> that<00:06:01.829> should<00:06:02.219> end<00:06:02.489> the<00:06:02.639> game

00:06:02.809 --> 00:06:02.819 
waterfall and that should end the game

00:06:02.819 --> 00:06:04.549 
waterfall and that should end the game
right<00:06:03.239> here<00:06:03.299> if<00:06:03.659> you<00:06:03.749> protect<00:06:04.110> others<00:06:04.439> be

00:06:04.549 --> 00:06:04.559 
right here if you protect others be

00:06:04.559 --> 00:06:06.529 
right here if you protect others be

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:06.539 
retarded so it's probably going to end
