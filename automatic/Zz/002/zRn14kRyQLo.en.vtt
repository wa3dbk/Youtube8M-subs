00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.580
 they are telling us 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.090
 nothing 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.619
 the truth I have to win in that 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:43.049
 phone where it is not a graph that seems 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:44.729

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.200

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:59.490
 in the account that gives another round of 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.980
 torture for god we can not stand 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.820
 all this to favor the comments 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.820
 this game is worse 

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:13.310
 because I have my doubts with many doubts 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.310
 about it 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.680
 because the hands and I've gone in order and 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.870
 that beyond then there would be only 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:34.370
 good luck was finishing me 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:34.370
 thinking that I do not 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.260

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.909
 with this sign that it was a camel of 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.750
 giraffe I do not know what it was 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:21.969

00:03:21.969 --> 00:03:28.140
