example<00:00:12.850> from<00:00:13.150> grab<00:00:13.559> Capcom<00:00:14.730> let's<00:00:15.730> go<00:00:15.910> to

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:15.969 
example from grab Capcom let's go to

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:25.630 
example from grab Capcom let's go to
space<00:00:16.299> claim<00:00:16.660> and<00:00:17.759> open<00:00:18.759> the<00:00:18.880> file

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:25.640 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:33.310 

I<00:00:25.750> choose<00:00:26.859> step<00:00:27.859> file<00:00:28.130> as<00:00:28.369> input<00:00:32.290> Spacely

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320 
I choose step file as input Spacely

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:39.580 
I choose step file as input Spacely
import<00:00:33.770> the<00:00:33.949> file<00:00:35.230> and<00:00:37.899> we<00:00:38.899> can<00:00:39.050> just<00:00:39.199> look

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:39.590 
import the file and we can just look

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.660 
import the file and we can just look
around<00:00:39.800> and<00:00:40.329> by<00:00:41.329> visual<00:00:41.930> inspection<00:00:42.309> we<00:00:43.309> come

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
around and by visual inspection we come

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.500 
around and by visual inspection we come
to<00:00:43.850> know<00:00:44.000> that<00:00:44.530> the<00:00:45.530> axis<00:00:45.920> of<00:00:46.160> the<00:00:46.640> warmth<00:00:47.360> is

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
to know that the axis of the warmth is

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.549 
to know that the axis of the warmth is
not<00:00:47.570> in<00:00:48.500> the<00:00:48.620> plane<00:00:48.860> of<00:00:48.890> center<00:00:49.430> plane<00:00:49.610> of<00:00:49.760> the

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:50.559 
not in the plane of center plane of the

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:56.470 
not in the plane of center plane of the
gear<00:00:51.589> so<00:00:52.550> let's<00:00:53.350> align<00:00:54.350> it<00:00:54.559> first<00:00:55.300> so<00:00:56.300> we

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
gear so let's align it first so we

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.729 
gear so let's align it first so we
select<00:00:56.900> these<00:00:57.110> two<00:00:57.470> planes<00:00:57.829> of<00:00:58.160> the<00:00:58.370> gear<00:00:59.180> and

00:00:59.729 --> 00:00:59.739 
select these two planes of the gear and

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:05.380 
select these two planes of the gear and
go<00:01:00.739> to<00:01:00.800> insert<00:01:01.370> and<00:01:02.020> plane<00:01:03.610> that<00:01:04.610> is<00:01:04.789> done<00:01:05.030> so

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
go to insert and plane that is done so

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.889 
go to insert and plane that is done so
we<00:01:05.539> will<00:01:05.630> have<00:01:05.750> to<00:01:05.930> move<00:01:06.080> this<00:01:06.289> component<00:01:06.950> now

00:01:07.889 --> 00:01:07.899 
we will have to move this component now

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:14.680 
we will have to move this component now
let's<00:01:08.899> select<00:01:09.940> place<00:01:10.940> and<00:01:11.149> make<00:01:11.300> oh<00:01:13.690> let's

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:14.690 
let's select place and make oh let's

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:20.529 
let's select place and make oh let's
rename<00:01:15.080> it<00:01:15.140> as<00:01:15.470> gear<00:01:16.990> click<00:01:17.990> on<00:01:18.140> warm<00:01:18.410> move<00:01:19.539> up

00:01:20.529 --> 00:01:20.539 
rename it as gear click on warm move up

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:28.109 
rename it as gear click on warm move up
to<00:01:23.380> the<00:01:24.380> plane<00:01:25.420> okay<00:01:26.450> that<00:01:26.840> has<00:01:27.050> been<00:01:27.200> moved

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119 
to the plane okay that has been moved

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:31.390 
to the plane okay that has been moved
now<00:01:29.119> we<00:01:29.179> need<00:01:29.509> to<00:01:29.659> define<00:01:30.020> revolute<00:01:30.979> joints

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 
now we need to define revolute joints

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:41.700 
now we need to define revolute joints
for<00:01:32.259> gear<00:01:33.259> and<00:01:33.530> warm<00:01:34.479> let's<00:01:35.479> create<00:01:38.110> axis<00:01:39.110> and

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.940 

select<00:01:42.710> this<00:01:42.829> axis<00:01:43.490> and<00:01:43.729> the<00:01:44.950> cylindrical

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:29.829 
on align similarly select this plane

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:33.580 
on align similarly select this plane
insert<00:02:30.829> plane<00:02:31.480> in<00:02:32.480> that<00:02:32.750> plane<00:02:33.019> selected

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
insert plane in that plane selected

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.640 
insert plane in that plane selected
select<00:02:34.580> the<00:02:34.700> circular<00:02:35.090> and<00:02:35.300> face<00:02:35.930> click<00:02:36.440> on

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.640 
engine
so<00:02:38.150> we<00:02:38.300> are<00:02:38.480> now<00:02:38.600> set<00:02:38.870> with<00:02:39.110> two<00:02:39.320> revolute

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
so we are now set with two revolute

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.330 
so we are now set with two revolute
joints<00:02:40.040> and<00:02:40.240> we<00:02:41.240> just<00:02:41.480> need<00:02:41.750> to<00:02:42.020> create<00:02:42.980> the

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
joints and we just need to create the

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.050 
joints and we just need to create the
gear<00:02:44.150> condition<00:02:44.630> so<00:02:45.470> the<00:02:45.650> trick<00:02:46.160> here<00:02:46.550> is<00:02:46.580> to

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
gear condition so the trick here is to

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:53.410 
gear condition so the trick here is to
get<00:02:47.600> the<00:02:47.780> radius<00:02:48.140> of<00:02:48.500> a<00:02:49.240> cylinder<00:02:50.240> on<00:02:51.520> the<00:02:52.520> warm

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
get the radius of a cylinder on the warm

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.250 
get the radius of a cylinder on the warm
as<00:02:53.630> well<00:02:54.590> as<00:02:54.740> radius<00:02:55.190> of<00:02:55.400> the<00:02:55.520> cylinder<00:02:55.730> of<00:02:56.180> the

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
as well as radius of the cylinder of the

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.820 
as well as radius of the cylinder of the
gear<00:02:57.260> that<00:02:57.470> are<00:02:57.800> touching<00:02:58.220> each<00:02:58.550> other<00:02:58.760> and<00:02:59.830> to

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
gear that are touching each other and to

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.630 
gear that are touching each other and to
determine<00:03:01.130> that<00:03:01.460> we<00:03:01.760> select<00:03:02.180> this<00:03:03.340> plane<00:03:04.340> and

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
determine that we select this plane and

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:11.950 
determine that we select this plane and
go<00:03:05.150> to<00:03:05.620> sketch<00:03:07.660> just<00:03:08.660> go<00:03:08.870> to<00:03:08.930> look<00:03:09.200> at<00:03:09.350> view<00:03:10.960> the

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:11.960 
go to sketch just go to look at view the

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:24.390 
go to sketch just go to look at view the
radius<00:03:12.470> of<00:03:12.650> the<00:03:13.550> form<00:03:14.260> cylinder<00:03:15.970> is<00:03:19.870> equal<00:03:20.870> to

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:31.320 

ok<00:03:25.400> let's<00:03:27.040> determine<00:03:28.040> that<00:03:28.810> distance<00:03:29.810> between

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 
ok let's determine that distance between

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:37.900 
ok let's determine that distance between
these<00:03:32.330> two<00:03:32.690> centers<00:03:35.620> okay<00:03:36.650> let's<00:03:37.459> select

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
these two centers okay let's select

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:43.930 
these two centers okay let's select
these<00:03:38.270> two<00:03:38.480> axis<00:03:38.959> and<00:03:39.290> go<00:03:39.590> to<00:03:40.270> measure<00:03:42.610> it<00:03:43.610> says

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
these two axis and go to measure it says

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.949

the distance between the Centers a 70
8.5<00:03:48.680> mm<00:03:49.190> and<00:03:49.760> we<00:03:50.360> also<00:03:50.510> need<00:03:50.870> to<00:03:51.050> find<00:03:51.590> the

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:51.769 
8.5 mm and we also need to find the

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:56.229 
8.5 mm and we also need to find the
number<00:03:52.040> of<00:03:52.269> teeth<00:03:53.269> of<00:03:53.510> the<00:03:53.690> gear<00:03:54.940> so<00:03:55.940> go<00:03:56.180> to

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
number of teeth of the gear so go to

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:03.460 
number of teeth of the gear so go to
selection<00:03:56.660> tab<00:03:57.019> and<00:03:57.290> click<00:03:58.010> on<00:03:58.190> faces<00:03:58.850> with

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:07.480 

okay<00:04:04.310> let's<00:04:04.640> look<00:04:04.850> on<00:04:05.000> protrusions<00:04:06.310> okay<00:04:07.310> that

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:07.490 
okay let's look on protrusions okay that

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:10.480 
okay let's look on protrusions okay that
is<00:04:07.580> not<00:04:07.730> true<00:04:08.200> let's<00:04:09.200> select<00:04:09.410> a<00:04:09.650> surface<00:04:10.160> and

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:10.490 
is not true let's select a surface and

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:13.750 
is not true let's select a surface and
faces<00:04:11.180> with<00:04:11.360> same<00:04:11.630> area<00:04:12.070> so<00:04:13.070> it's<00:04:13.220> actually

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
faces with same area so it's actually

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.870 
faces with same area so it's actually
says<00:04:13.970> 38<00:04:14.450> but<00:04:14.990> let's<00:04:15.470> inspect<00:04:16.220> it<00:04:16.430> and<00:04:16.640> see

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
says 38 but let's inspect it and see

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.600 
says 38 but let's inspect it and see
Brigitte<00:04:17.780> to<00:04:18.350> cross-check<00:04:18.620> let's<00:04:19.130> select<00:04:19.430> the

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:19.610 
Brigitte to cross-check let's select the

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:24.160 
Brigitte to cross-check let's select the
other<00:04:19.820> cylindrical<00:04:20.720> edge<00:04:20.930> and<00:04:22.270> use<00:04:23.270> all<00:04:23.540> equal

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:24.170 
other cylindrical edge and use all equal

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:27.250 
other cylindrical edge and use all equal
radius<00:04:24.380> cylinders<00:04:25.100> here<00:04:26.060> it<00:04:26.240> says<00:04:26.510> as<00:04:26.690> 40<00:04:27.080> so

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260 
radius cylinders here it says as 40 so

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:32.040 
radius cylinders here it says as 40 so
the<00:04:27.380> number<00:04:27.620> of<00:04:27.740> teeth<00:04:28.400> of<00:04:28.760> these<00:04:29.330> gear<00:04:29.840> is<00:04:30.470> 40

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
the number of teeth of these gear is 40

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.290 
the number of teeth of these gear is 40
so<00:04:33.050> with<00:04:33.260> that<00:04:33.380> we<00:04:33.620> use<00:04:33.860> in<00:04:34.040> the<00:04:34.220> equation<00:04:35.090> for

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
so with that we use in the equation for

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.020 
so with that we use in the equation for
radius<00:04:35.720> of<00:04:35.900> warm<00:04:36.200> so<00:04:37.130> again<00:04:37.340> we<00:04:37.490> go<00:04:37.670> there

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
radius of warm so again we go there

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:45.070 
radius of warm so again we go there

and click on construction on/off so once

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:26.580 
and click on construction on/off so once
that<00:05:21.470> is<00:05:21.740> done<00:05:21.919> we<00:05:22.130> can<00:05:22.250> come<00:05:22.580> to<00:05:22.760> 3d<00:05:23.090> view<00:05:23.120> and

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:26.590 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:31.060 

we<00:05:27.590> select<00:05:28.010> this<00:05:28.160> circular<00:05:28.880> surface<00:05:29.330> and<00:05:30.070> we

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:31.070 
we select this circular surface and we

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:37.060 
we select this circular surface and we
just<00:05:33.760> pull<00:05:34.760> it<00:05:34.910> up<00:05:35.120> to<00:05:35.419> say<00:05:36.230> this<00:05:36.260> circular

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:37.070 
just pull it up to say this circular

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:40.459 
just pull it up to say this circular
edge

00:05:40.459 --> 00:05:40.469 

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:45.269 

so<00:05:41.469> we<00:05:42.249> have<00:05:42.520> a<00:05:42.779> surface<00:05:43.889> cylindrical<00:05:44.889> surface

00:05:45.269 --> 00:05:45.279 
so we have a surface cylindrical surface

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:48.209 
so we have a surface cylindrical surface
generated<00:05:46.110> now<00:05:47.110> we<00:05:47.169> need<00:05:47.499> to<00:05:47.649> create<00:05:47.830> a

00:05:48.209 --> 00:05:48.219 
generated now we need to create a

00:05:48.219 --> 00:05:51.059 
generated now we need to create a
surface<00:05:49.080> cylindrical<00:05:50.080> surface<00:05:50.469> for<00:05:50.709> the<00:05:50.830> gap

on warm go to move start moving it as

00:06:59.979 --> 00:07:06.600 
on warm go to move start moving it as
you<00:07:00.909> can<00:07:01.029> see<00:07:04.649> rotation<00:07:05.649> of<00:07:05.740> the<00:07:05.860> warm<00:07:06.129> results

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:06.610 
you can see rotation of the warm results

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:08.969 
you can see rotation of the warm results
in<00:07:06.699> the<00:07:06.819> rotation<00:07:07.360> of<00:07:07.419> the<00:07:07.599> gear<00:07:07.839> the<00:07:08.709> mating

00:07:08.969 --> 00:07:08.979 
in the rotation of the gear the mating

00:07:08.979 --> 00:07:12.839 
in the rotation of the gear the mating
is<00:07:09.129> perfect<00:07:10.289> let's<00:07:11.289> see<00:07:11.559> what<00:07:11.800> AC<00:07:12.219> motion<00:07:12.610> can

00:07:12.839 --> 00:07:12.849 
is perfect let's see what AC motion can

00:07:12.849 --> 00:07:19.379 
is perfect let's see what AC motion can
do<00:07:13.110> we<00:07:14.110> go<00:07:14.259> to<00:07:14.319> s<00:07:14.439> emotion<00:07:14.919> start<00:07:15.689> and<00:07:18.240> say<00:07:19.240> we

00:07:19.379 --> 00:07:19.389 
do we go to s emotion start and say we

00:07:19.389 --> 00:07:22.169 
do we go to s emotion start and say we
want<00:07:19.629> to<00:07:19.779> define<00:07:20.110> rotation<00:07:20.649> to<00:07:20.800> the<00:07:20.949> one<00:07:21.909> gear

00:07:22.169 --> 00:07:22.179 
want to define rotation to the one gear

00:07:22.179 --> 00:07:25.259 
want to define rotation to the one gear
right<00:07:22.719> leg<00:07:23.019> set<00:07:23.499> joint<00:07:23.769> input<00:07:24.240> give<00:07:25.240> a

right leg set joint input give a

00:07:25.269 --> 00:07:27.689 
right leg set joint input give a
rotation<00:07:25.479> of<00:07:25.809> say<00:07:25.990> 360<00:07:26.800> degrees<00:07:27.099> per<00:07:27.309> second

00:07:27.689 --> 00:07:27.699 
rotation of say 360 degrees per second

00:07:27.699 --> 00:07:31.899 
rotation of say 360 degrees per second
and<00:07:28.509> start<00:07:28.929> simulation

00:07:31.899 --> 00:07:31.909 

00:07:31.909 --> 00:07:34.869 

the<00:07:32.509> same<00:07:32.779> thing<00:07:33.110> can<00:07:33.529> be<00:07:33.679> done<00:07:33.709> using<00:07:34.429> a<00:07:34.699> see

00:07:34.869 --> 00:07:34.879 
the same thing can be done using a see

00:07:34.879 --> 00:07:41.050 
the same thing can be done using a see
motion<00:07:36.339> okay<00:07:37.629> thanks<00:07:38.629> for<00:07:38.689> watching
