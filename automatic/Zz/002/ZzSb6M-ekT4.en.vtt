00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
you know it feels like every year I come

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.860 
you know it feels like every year I come
to<00:00:11.070> CES<00:00:11.519> and<00:00:11.789> ride<00:00:12.059> Electric<00:00:12.480> skateboards

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:14.870 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:17.200 

and<00:00:15.560> I've<00:00:15.650> made<00:00:15.830> it<00:00:15.980> my<00:00:16.100> mission<00:00:16.130> to<00:00:16.550> find<00:00:17.060> the

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:17.210 
and I've made it my mission to find the

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.710 
and I've made it my mission to find the
perfect<00:00:17.420> design<00:00:18.460> the<00:00:19.460> first<00:00:19.700> year<00:00:20.060> I<00:00:20.270> rode<00:00:20.630> the

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:20.720 
perfect design the first year I rode the

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.080 
perfect design the first year I rode the
board<00:00:20.960> of<00:00:21.050> Awesomeness<00:00:21.560> it<00:00:22.310> was<00:00:22.490> awesome

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:23.090 
board of Awesomeness it was awesome

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.540 
board of Awesomeness it was awesome
last<00:00:23.660> year<00:00:23.900> I<00:00:24.110> experienced<00:00:24.680> unparalleled

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:25.550 
last year I experienced unparalleled

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:31.480 
last year I experienced unparalleled
speeds<00:00:25.910> and<00:00:26.210> easy<00:00:26.510> boards<00:00:27.099> and<00:00:28.099> this<00:00:28.820> year<00:00:30.490> the

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:31.490 
speeds and easy boards and this year the

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:49.410 
speeds and easy boards and this year the
boards<00:00:31.820> are<00:00:31.940> back

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.670 

so<00:00:50.420> this<00:00:50.570> is<00:00:50.720> the<00:00:50.840> ego<00:00:51.080> electric<00:00:51.470> skateboard

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680 
so this is the ego electric skateboard

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.190 
so this is the ego electric skateboard
I'm<00:00:52.430> cruising<00:00:53.330> I<00:00:53.510> got<00:00:53.930> this<00:00:54.050> little

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:54.200 
I'm cruising I got this little

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.290 
I'm cruising I got this little
controller<00:00:54.590> here<00:00:54.920> you<00:00:55.340> just<00:00:55.550> slide<00:00:55.820> up<00:00:55.970> to<00:00:56.120> go

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
controller here you just slide up to go

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:02.220 
controller here you just slide up to go
and<00:00:57.260> you're<00:00:57.980> off

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.230 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.930 

so<00:01:03.230> the<00:01:03.320> board's<00:01:03.620> really<00:01:03.860> light<00:01:04.190> and<00:01:04.430> the

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:04.940 
so the board's really light and the

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:06.520 
so the board's really light and the
coolest<00:01:05.239> thing<00:01:05.420> about<00:01:05.630> this<00:01:05.870> type<00:01:06.110> thing<00:01:06.320> is

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
coolest thing about this type thing is

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.910 
coolest thing about this type thing is
the<00:01:07.070> fact<00:01:07.250> that<00:01:07.370> it<00:01:07.520> feels<00:01:07.870> way<00:01:08.870> more<00:01:08.900> like<00:01:09.830> an

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
the fact that it feels way more like an

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.380 
the fact that it feels way more like an
actual<00:01:10.220> skateboard<00:01:10.820> than<00:01:10.940> the<00:01:11.030> previous

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
actual skateboard than the previous

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.450 
actual skateboard than the previous
boards<00:01:11.690> I've<00:01:11.810> written<00:01:12.050> it's<00:01:12.590> literally<00:01:13.040> a

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
boards I've written it's literally a

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.910 
boards I've written it's literally a
longboard<00:01:14.270> with<00:01:14.840> a<00:01:14.870> motor<00:01:15.170> attached<00:01:15.560> to<00:01:15.710> it

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
longboard with a motor attached to it

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.580 
longboard with a motor attached to it
and<00:01:16.160> it's<00:01:16.850> super<00:01:17.060> lightweight<00:01:17.660> and<00:01:17.840> you

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
and it's super lightweight and you

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:31.929 
and it's super lightweight and you
cruise

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:31.939 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:33.669 

so<00:01:32.509> this<00:01:32.630> is<00:01:32.749> the<00:01:32.869> underside<00:01:33.259> of<00:01:33.289> the<00:01:33.409> board

00:01:33.669 --> 00:01:33.679 
so this is the underside of the board

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:35.190 
so this is the underside of the board
and<00:01:33.829> obviously<00:01:34.100> there's<00:01:34.310> a<00:01:34.369> nice<00:01:34.549> big<00:01:34.789> battery

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
and obviously there's a nice big battery

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.870 
and obviously there's a nice big battery
attached<00:01:36.200> to<00:01:36.439> the<00:01:36.530> bottom<00:01:36.679> here<00:01:37.159> we're<00:01:37.670> told

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
attached to the bottom here we're told

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.580 
attached to the bottom here we're told
that<00:01:38.030> this<00:01:38.149> thing<00:01:38.329> has<00:01:38.450> a<00:01:38.479> range<00:01:38.719> of<00:01:38.810> 18<00:01:39.319> miles

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
that this thing has a range of 18 miles

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.919 
that this thing has a range of 18 miles
on<00:01:39.859> a<00:01:39.890> single<00:01:39.950> charge<00:01:40.219> and<00:01:40.700> as<00:01:41.359> a<00:01:41.390> top<00:01:41.630> speed<00:01:41.869> of

00:01:41.919 --> 00:01:41.929 
on a single charge and as a top speed of

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:45.160 
on a single charge and as a top speed of
12<00:01:42.259> miles<00:01:42.530> an<00:01:42.710> hour<00:01:43.420> so<00:01:44.420> you<00:01:44.450> can<00:01:44.869> take<00:01:45.020> this

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
12 miles an hour so you can take this

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.919 
12 miles an hour so you can take this
thing<00:01:45.350> pretty<00:01:45.530> damn<00:01:45.770> far<00:01:46.479> the<00:01:47.479> ego<00:01:47.810> is

00:01:47.919 --> 00:01:47.929 
thing pretty damn far the ego is

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:49.419 
thing pretty damn far the ego is
hundreds<00:01:48.350> of<00:01:48.439> dollars<00:01:48.500> cheaper<00:01:48.979> than<00:01:49.189> most

00:01:49.419 --> 00:01:49.429 
hundreds of dollars cheaper than most

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:52.120 
hundreds of dollars cheaper than most
other<00:01:49.640> Electric<00:01:50.030> skateboards<00:01:50.209> at<00:01:51.140> 700<00:01:51.649> bucks

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
other Electric skateboards at 700 bucks

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:59.919 
other Electric skateboards at 700 bucks
I<00:01:52.159> might<00:01:52.700> just<00:01:52.849> pick<00:01:52.969> one<00:01:53.119> up<00:01:58.689> let's<00:01:59.689> see<00:01:59.810> what

00:01:59.919 --> 00:01:59.929 
I might just pick one up let's see what

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:10.370 
I might just pick one up let's see what
happens<00:02:00.289> when<00:02:00.439> I<00:02:00.670> crank<00:02:01.670> it<00:02:01.759> up

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.510 

I've<00:02:11.380> written<00:02:11.620> plenty<00:02:11.770> of<00:02:12.160> Electric

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
I've written plenty of Electric

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.250 
I've written plenty of Electric
skateboards<00:02:12.730> here<00:02:13.150> at<00:02:13.270> CES<00:02:13.570> over<00:02:13.960> the<00:02:14.050> years

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
skateboards here at CES over the years

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:28.120 
skateboards here at CES over the years
but<00:02:17.260> this<00:02:17.380> next<00:02:17.590> one<00:02:17.770> I<00:02:17.800> tested<00:02:19.020> it<00:02:20.020> tested<00:02:20.380> me

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.240 

so<00:02:29.130> this<00:02:29.370> is<00:02:29.670> the<00:02:30.240> one<00:02:30.420> wheel<00:02:31.010> can't<00:02:32.010> really

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
so this is the one wheel can't really

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.350 
so this is the one wheel can't really
call<00:02:32.430> it<00:02:32.490> an<00:02:32.730> electric<00:02:33.120> skateboard<00:02:33.830> but<00:02:35.120> it<00:02:36.120> is

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
call it an electric skateboard but it is

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.440 
call it an electric skateboard but it is
very<00:02:36.630> much<00:02:36.870> a<00:02:37.110> personal<00:02:37.680> transportation

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
very much a personal transportation

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.820 
very much a personal transportation
electronic<00:02:39.450> device<00:02:39.780> it's<00:02:40.230> pretty<00:02:40.470> simple<00:02:40.770> the

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
electronic device it's pretty simple the

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.140 
electronic device it's pretty simple the
way<00:02:40.950> it<00:02:41.040> works<00:02:41.220> actually<00:02:41.460> you<00:02:41.730> sort<00:02:41.940> of<00:02:42.000> just

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
way it works actually you sort of just

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.080 
way it works actually you sort of just
put<00:02:42.390> your<00:02:42.480> foot<00:02:42.810> down<00:02:43.140> on<00:02:43.520> the<00:02:44.520> back<00:02:44.730> here<00:02:45.060> and

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
put your foot down on the back here and

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.550 
put your foot down on the back here and
then<00:02:45.270> you<00:02:45.390> lean<00:02:45.630> in<00:02:45.840> and<00:02:45.870> make<00:02:46.170> sure<00:02:46.200> your

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
then you lean in and make sure your

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.200 
then you lean in and make sure your
other<00:02:46.740> foot<00:02:46.980> is<00:02:47.070> on<00:02:47.160> the<00:02:47.190> on<00:02:47.400> the<00:02:47.520> switch<00:02:47.820> and

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.210 
other foot is on the on the switch and

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.450 
other foot is on the on the switch and
once<00:02:48.720> you<00:02:48.840> hit<00:02:48.990> the<00:02:49.140> middle<00:02:49.410> the<00:02:49.980> board's

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:50.460 
once you hit the middle the board's

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.390 
once you hit the middle the board's
accelerometer<00:02:51.420> and<00:02:51.570> gyroscope<00:02:52.260> kick<00:02:52.830> in<00:02:53.040> and

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
accelerometer and gyroscope kick in and

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.180 
accelerometer and gyroscope kick in and
will<00:02:53.870> maintain<00:02:54.870> your<00:02:55.020> balance<00:02:55.200> and<00:02:55.680> if<00:02:56.040> you

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
will maintain your balance and if you

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.880 
will maintain your balance and if you
just<00:02:56.460> leave<00:02:56.840> the<00:02:57.840> accelerometer<00:02:58.710> and

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
just leave the accelerometer and

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.420 
just leave the accelerometer and
gyroscope<00:02:59.520> both<00:02:59.820> kick<00:03:00.180> into<00:03:00.330> action<00:03:01.430> you

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
gyroscope both kick into action you

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.830 
gyroscope both kick into action you
really<00:03:02.700> just<00:03:02.850> have<00:03:02.940> to<00:03:03.030> really<00:03:03.300> feel<00:03:03.930> it<00:03:03.960> out

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
really just have to really feel it out

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.940 
really just have to really feel it out
you<00:03:06.840> know<00:03:06.930> rut<00:03:07.170> once<00:03:07.350> you<00:03:07.470> lose<00:03:07.650> your<00:03:07.680> balance

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
you know rut once you lose your balance

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:14.510 
you know rut once you lose your balance
you'll<00:03:08.250> fly<00:03:08.550> right<00:03:08.850> off

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.710 

so<00:03:15.520> range<00:03:15.730> on<00:03:15.880> the<00:03:15.940> one<00:03:16.090> wheels<00:03:16.300> four<00:03:16.480> to<00:03:16.540> six

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
so range on the one wheels four to six

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.480 
so range on the one wheels four to six
miles<00:03:16.930> on<00:03:17.140> a<00:03:17.170> single<00:03:17.230> charge<00:03:17.530> and<00:03:18.160> it<00:03:18.340> has<00:03:18.460> a

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:18.490 
miles on a single charge and it has a

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:20.850 
miles on a single charge and it has a
top<00:03:18.730> speed<00:03:18.760> of<00:03:19.120> 12<00:03:19.330> miles<00:03:19.600> an<00:03:19.810> hour<00:03:19.900> but<00:03:20.710> for

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
top speed of 12 miles an hour but for

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:21.930 
top speed of 12 miles an hour but for
something<00:03:21.160> this<00:03:21.310> wonky

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
something this wonky

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.120 
something this wonky
I<00:03:21.970> think<00:03:22.300> that's<00:03:22.420> fast<00:03:22.630> enough<00:03:22.780> the<00:03:23.770> one<00:03:23.950> wheel

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
I think that's fast enough the one wheel

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:25.740 
I think that's fast enough the one wheel
is<00:03:24.280> an<00:03:24.400> awesome<00:03:24.760> concept<00:03:25.180> brought<00:03:25.420> to<00:03:25.570> light

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
is an awesome concept brought to light

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.780 
is an awesome concept brought to light
the<00:03:26.290> self<00:03:26.560> balancing<00:03:26.950> technology<00:03:27.310> inside

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
the self balancing technology inside

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.100 
the self balancing technology inside
made<00:03:28.060> me<00:03:28.180> feel<00:03:28.360> like<00:03:28.480> I'm<00:03:28.600> riding<00:03:28.900> something

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110 
made me feel like I'm riding something

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:30.960 
made me feel like I'm riding something
out<00:03:29.320> of<00:03:29.350> the<00:03:29.500> future<00:03:29.860> but<00:03:30.520> at<00:03:30.640> thirteen

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
out of the future but at thirteen

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:32.580 
out of the future but at thirteen
hundred<00:03:31.210> dollars<00:03:31.240> you're<00:03:31.840> getting<00:03:31.960> a<00:03:32.140> 25

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
hundred dollars you're getting a 25

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.080 
hundred dollars you're getting a 25
pound<00:03:32.800> contraption<00:03:33.460> that<00:03:33.490> has<00:03:33.730> a<00:03:33.760> pretty

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
pound contraption that has a pretty

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.450 
pound contraption that has a pretty
limited<00:03:34.480> range<00:03:34.660> as<00:03:35.650> interesting<00:03:36.100> as<00:03:36.190> it<00:03:36.310> is

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:36.460 
limited range as interesting as it is

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:38.460 
limited range as interesting as it is
it's<00:03:37.090> not<00:03:37.210> something<00:03:37.510> I<00:03:37.570> see<00:03:37.600> myself<00:03:38.020> fine

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
it's not something I see myself fine

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.260 
it's not something I see myself fine
so<00:03:39.460> I<00:03:39.490> guess<00:03:39.670> my<00:03:39.790> search<00:03:40.000> for<00:03:40.030> the<00:03:40.210> perfect

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:40.270 
so I guess my search for the perfect

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:42.690 
so I guess my search for the perfect
electric<00:03:40.900> skateboard<00:03:41.080> continues<00:03:41.710> see<00:03:42.640> you

electric skateboard continues see you

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.880 
electric skateboard continues see you
next<00:03:42.940> year

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
next year
