there for the calc 2 I started taking
the<00:02:06.250> exam<00:02:06.580> I<00:02:06.850> didn't<00:02:07.480> really<00:02:07.660> recognize<00:02:08.080> any

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:08.290

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:10.500 
the exam I didn't really recognize any
material<00:02:08.830> but<00:02:09.040> I<00:02:09.340> always<00:02:09.910> heard<00:02:10.149> horror

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:10.510 
material but I always heard horror

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:12.120 
material but I always heard horror
stories<00:02:10.600> about<00:02:10.899> college<00:02:11.410> exams<00:02:11.740> that<00:02:11.920> you

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
stories about college exams that you

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:13.410 
stories about college exams that you
weren't<00:02:12.280> really<00:02:12.459> ever<00:02:12.730> going<00:02:12.910> to<00:02:12.970> be<00:02:13.060> prepared

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
weren't really ever going to be prepared

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.920 
weren't really ever going to be prepared
so<00:02:14.130> didn't<00:02:15.130> think<00:02:15.310> much<00:02:15.400> of<00:02:15.459> that<00:02:15.700> either<00:02:15.930> 20

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
so didn't think much of that either 20

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.360 
so didn't think much of that either 20
minutes<00:02:17.200> in<00:02:17.290> the<00:02:17.380> exam<00:02:17.680> though<00:02:17.890> I<00:02:17.920> finally

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
minutes in the exam though I finally

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.490 
minutes in the exam though I finally
realized<00:02:18.670> it<00:02:18.790> couldn't<00:02:18.970> possibly<00:02:19.090> be<00:02:19.570> the

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
realized it couldn't possibly be the

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.520 
realized it couldn't possibly be the
calc<00:02:20.740> two<00:02:20.980> exams<00:02:21.310> so<00:02:21.700> I<00:02:22.060> ran<00:02:23.050> to<00:02:23.140> the<00:02:23.260> front<00:02:23.320> of

something worth saying it's great that I

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.890 
something worth saying it's great that I
have<00:03:26.830> people<00:03:27.010> that<00:03:27.220> are<00:03:27.430> kind<00:03:27.700> of<00:03:27.790> trying<00:03:28.780> to

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
have people that are kind of trying to

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.840 
have people that are kind of trying to
have<00:03:29.050> me<00:03:29.170> explore<00:03:29.500> that<00:03:29.680> opportunity<00:03:30.370> and<00:03:30.580> so

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
have me explore that opportunity and so

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:32.490 
have me explore that opportunity and so
enthusiastic<00:03:31.600> about<00:03:31.660> the<00:03:31.870> possibility<00:03:32.410> I

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
enthusiastic about the possibility I

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.070 
enthusiastic about the possibility I
could<00:03:32.560> get<00:03:32.830> it<00:03:32.980> but<00:03:33.400> I<00:03:34.030> think<00:03:34.360> nothing<00:03:34.900> is<00:03:34.930> ever

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
could get it but I think nothing is ever

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.640 
could get it but I think nothing is ever
for<00:03:35.410> sure<00:03:35.470> so<00:03:35.920> it's<00:03:35.950> come<00:03:36.220> to<00:03:36.370> know<00:03:36.519> pursue<00:03:37.030> but

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
for sure so it's come to know pursue but

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:45.809 
for sure so it's come to know pursue but
we'll<00:03:38.650> see<00:03:38.830> what<00:03:39.250> happens<00:03:42.989> liz<00:03:43.989> is<00:03:44.819> applied
