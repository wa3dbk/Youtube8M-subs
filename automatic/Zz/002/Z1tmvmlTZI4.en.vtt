can<00:00:38.210> hang<00:00:38.360> them<00:00:38.920> and<00:00:39.920> you<00:00:40.040> get<00:00:40.160> the<00:00:40.250> LEDs<00:00:40.579> in

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
can hang them and you get the LEDs in

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.500 
can hang them and you get the LEDs in
there<00:00:41.739> it's<00:00:42.739> on<00:00:42.890> white<00:00:43.100> foam<00:00:43.399> board<00:00:43.730> hot<00:00:44.210> glued

there it's on white foam board hot glued

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:50.590 
there it's on white foam board hot glued
it's<00:00:44.809> pretty<00:00:45.050> cheap<00:00:45.530> and<00:00:46.270> safe<00:00:48.910> and<00:00:49.910> you<00:00:49.970> turn

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
it's pretty cheap and safe and you turn

00:00:50.600 --> 00:01:00.040 
it's pretty cheap and safe and you turn
it<00:00:50.690> on<00:00:54.370> so<00:00:55.370> your<00:00:56.030> greens<00:00:56.329> and<00:00:56.870> your<00:00:57.200> red<00:00:59.050> blue

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 
it on so your greens and your red blue

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:08.160 
it on so your greens and your red blue
and<00:01:01.030> then<00:01:02.030> you<00:01:02.180> can<00:01:02.360> mix<00:01:02.540> so<00:01:03.200> you

a<00:01:14.909> little<00:01:15.480> bit<00:01:15.600> of<00:01:15.690> purple<00:01:15.900> I<00:01:16.110> guess<00:01:16.909> pinkish

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
a little bit of purple I guess pinkish

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.540 
a little bit of purple I guess pinkish
purple<00:01:18.650> then<00:01:19.650> I<00:01:19.710> got<00:01:19.830> an<00:01:19.920> extra<00:01:20.100> button<00:01:20.370> on

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:20.550 
purple then I got an extra button on

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.820 
purple then I got an extra button on
here<00:01:20.729> for<00:01:21.060> fancy<00:01:21.900> mode<00:01:22.110> that<00:01:22.409> I<00:01:22.500> can<00:01:22.650> just

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
here for fancy mode that I can just

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.290 
here for fancy mode that I can just
program<00:01:23.340> to<00:01:23.460> do<00:01:23.550> anything<00:01:23.850> right<00:01:23.940> now<00:01:24.000> just

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:24.300 
program to do anything right now just

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.050 
program to do anything right now just
make<00:01:24.479> a<00:01:24.510> deal<00:01:24.720> with<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:24.900> label<00:01:25.229> effect<00:01:25.970> here<00:01:26.970> we

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
make a deal with a label effect here we

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:45.570 
make a deal with a label effect here we
go

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:45.580 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.720 

that's<00:01:46.360> right

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:49.730 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:57.110
