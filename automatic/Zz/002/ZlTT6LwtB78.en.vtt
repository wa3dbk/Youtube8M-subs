and doing chance and responses and it's

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.370 
and doing chance and responses and it's
just<00:02:21.280> unreal<00:02:21.430> yeah<00:02:22.000> I<00:02:22.060> think<00:02:22.269> that's<00:02:23.080> it<00:02:23.230> it's

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
just unreal yeah I think that's it it's

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:30.110 
just unreal yeah I think that's it it's
a<00:02:23.470> community

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.820 

I<00:02:30.209> think<00:02:30.930> for<00:02:31.140> us<00:02:31.319> you<00:02:31.560> know<00:02:31.590> we've<00:02:31.799> been

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
I think for us you know we've been

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.500 
I think for us you know we've been
touring<00:02:32.159> so<00:02:32.459> much<00:02:32.670> it's<00:02:33.030> getting<00:02:33.390> to<00:02:33.450> that

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
touring so much it's getting to that

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.809 
touring so much it's getting to that
point<00:02:33.810> where<00:02:34.010> we<00:02:35.010> want<00:02:35.250> to<00:02:35.310> have<00:02:35.459> a<00:02:35.489> breather

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
point where we want to have a breather

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:39.170 
point where we want to have a breather
and<00:02:36.200> sort<00:02:37.200> of<00:02:37.290> reassess<00:02:37.909> how<00:02:38.909> we're<00:02:39.030> going<00:02:39.120> to

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
and sort of reassess how we're going to

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.420 
and sort of reassess how we're going to
move<00:02:39.330> forward<00:02:39.629> and<00:02:39.900> write<00:02:40.680> a<00:02:40.709> new<00:02:40.860> record<00:02:41.040> and

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
move forward and write a new record and

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.070 
move forward and write a new record and
I<00:02:41.519> think<00:02:41.730> we're<00:02:41.849> all<00:02:42.090> pretty<00:02:42.150> excited<00:02:42.569> to<00:02:42.989> get

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
I think we're all pretty excited to get

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.530 
I think we're all pretty excited to get
some<00:02:43.290> new<00:02:43.409> material<00:02:43.440> into<00:02:44.010> a<00:02:44.040> bell<00:02:44.280> but<00:02:45.090> with

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
some new material into a bell but with

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.330 
some new material into a bell but with
the<00:02:45.720> the<00:02:45.989> touring<00:02:46.319> cycle<00:02:46.620> the<00:02:46.890> way<00:02:47.010> that<00:02:47.190> it's

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
the the touring cycle the way that it's

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.039 
the the touring cycle the way that it's
been<00:02:47.549> there<00:02:47.760> has<00:02:47.879> been<00:02:48.060> like<00:02:48.360> almost<00:02:48.599> zero

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
been there has been like almost zero

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:50.569 
been there has been like almost zero
time<00:02:49.349> to<00:02:49.560> be<00:02:49.650> creative<00:02:49.799> together<00:02:50.310> so

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:50.579 
time to be creative together so

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:53.630 
time to be creative together so
hopefully<00:02:51.569> in<00:02:51.989> the<00:02:52.019> fall<00:02:52.349> we're<00:02:53.280> starting<00:02:53.579> to

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
hopefully in the fall we're starting to

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.069 
hopefully in the fall we're starting to
turn<00:02:53.819> down<00:02:53.879> stuff<00:02:54.450> we've<00:02:54.720> been<00:02:54.870> getting

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:55.079 
turn down stuff we've been getting

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:56.960 
turn down stuff we've been getting
offers<00:02:55.560> we're<00:02:55.709> turning<00:02:56.010> down<00:02:56.129> so<00:02:56.459> I<00:02:56.640> think

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
offers we're turning down so I think

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.119 
offers we're turning down so I think
we're<00:02:57.269> shaping<00:02:57.510> up<00:02:57.720> to<00:02:57.870> start<00:02:58.440> demoing<00:02:58.860> and

00:02:59.119 --> 00:02:59.129 
we're shaping up to start demoing and

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.220 
nowhere near the dynamic duo of Adam and
Joel<00:03:20.490> but<00:03:20.730> the<00:03:21.270> cool<00:03:21.450> thing<00:03:21.480> about<00:03:21.630> them<00:03:21.930> is<00:03:21.960> I

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
Joel but the cool thing about them is I

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.750 
Joel but the cool thing about them is I
can<00:03:22.380> submit<00:03:22.740> something<00:03:22.980> that's<00:03:23.220> simple<00:03:23.640> and

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
can submit something that's simple and

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.090 
can submit something that's simple and
plain<00:03:24.000> and<00:03:24.330> they<00:03:24.810> can<00:03:25.020> sort<00:03:25.350> of<00:03:25.410> make<00:03:25.620> it<00:03:25.650> metal

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
plain and they can sort of make it metal

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.830 
plain and they can sort of make it metal
or<00:03:26.280> I'll<00:03:26.730> probably<00:03:26.880> just<00:03:27.030> write<00:03:27.240> power<00:03:27.480> cord

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
or I'll probably just write power cord

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.220 
or I'll probably just write power cord
punk<00:03:28.140> to<00:03:28.550> c4<00:03:29.550> melodies<00:03:29.940> but<00:03:30.300> that's<00:03:30.930> to<00:03:31.110> be

punk to c4 melodies but that's to be

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:32.750 
punk to c4 melodies but that's to be
seen<00:03:31.260> I<00:03:31.560> may<00:03:31.680> not<00:03:31.860> even<00:03:32.040> have<00:03:32.160> the<00:03:32.430> confidence

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
seen I may not even have the confidence

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.180 
seen I may not even have the confidence
to<00:03:32.970> do<00:03:33.180> that<00:03:33.360> but<00:03:33.600> just<00:03:34.170> be<00:03:34.320> great<00:03:34.560> to<00:03:34.740> yeah<00:03:35.010> be

to do that but just be great to yeah be

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:36.470 
to do that but just be great to yeah be
part<00:03:35.459> of<00:03:35.490> the<00:03:35.580> process<00:03:35.760> and<00:03:36.000> hear<00:03:36.330> how<00:03:36.420> the

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
part of the process and hear how the
