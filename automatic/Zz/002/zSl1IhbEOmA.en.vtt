 devices so good in addition to the 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.860
 nation, let's start with the android 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.980
 news google aims to improve its 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.530
 batteries according to the wall street journal a 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.260
 end of 2012 a former worker of 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.750
 apple in its battery sector began to 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.280
 test batteries from other companies with the 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.039
 order to incorporate them into future 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.320
 google devices a year later 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.420
 ramesh bhardwaj and his team welcomed 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.770
 more people with the goal that 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.650
 google develops from its own 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.120
 batteries an ambitious project but very 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.010
 beneficial to cover 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.780
 this group is composed of four 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.730
 people who try every day 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.380
 new paracas battery projects in 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.510
 google it manufactures their own and compete 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.890
 with other companies that have already done 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.930
 I talked last week about the 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.220
 aluminum ion batteries and as 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.190
 we see google does not want to stay 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:26.040
 back mysterious one plus invitation 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.840
 for Apr. 20 water one company 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.210
 plus very unexpectedly and very 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.580
 mysterious has convened an event in 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.180
 China next Monday, April 20 is 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.380
 say tomorrow because we are on Sunday 19 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.390
 the invitation is not given any 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.100
 information about the reality of 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.230
 this call only looks what is 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.240
 doing on the screen the only thing 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:47.040
 we know is the slogan of the event that 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.800
 has been publicly shared in its 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.860
 google + profile that says they promised 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:55.230
 out n 5 apple from now on in 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.790
 anything can happen as I have already 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:59.790
 said this slogan has been shared in 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.350
 your google profile + logically what 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.660
 first thing that goes through our heads 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.840
 think about this invitation is the idyllic 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:09.030
 one plus yes I would very much like it 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.610
 sacasen is a device that I like 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.520
 a lot but we should not be short either 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.470
 of lira because it is very likely that the 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.900
 invitation be for some update 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.459
 software or maybe some improvement 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.200
 some other device because it has already 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.600
 talked about something for one plus pulled out 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.130
 two devices this year 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.260
 I personally hope that it's about 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.910
 one plus but whatever it is I encourage you to 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.890
 be up to date tomorrow to see what 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.350
 Cook in this event 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.990
 the european union accuses google of 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.940
 monopoly the vast majority of us 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.280
 we use google as a browser in our 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.720
 smartphone and although we do not realize 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.580
 this is not coincidence 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.830
 Google has taken care that your 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.510
 search engine is pre-installed in all its 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.430
 products and android is the system 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.770
 most used mobile operating throughout the 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.600
 planet and google comes pre-installed in 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.880
 android and this gives you an advantage over 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.830
 its rivals for that in the European Union ' 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.810
 accuses them of monopoly because they 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.819
 they have a more used system and take advantage 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.440
 to incorporate your search engine obtaining 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:06.630
 advantage over other search engines over 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.459
 your rivals personally I think that 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.320
 google is going to leave to get out of this 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.880
 situation because they have not yet been 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.670
 denounced are on tracks to do it 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.320
 I suppose that in five months we will already know 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.269
 the solution although I personally believe 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.459
 that google is going to get rid of 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:23.100
 you will see the news that has most called 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:25.739
 my attention has been the last one the 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:28.410
 of the complaint good the accusation of the 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:30.269
 European Union 'to google pro monopoly me 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:33.030
 has surprised mainly because no 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:35.580
 I knew that monopoly like in this case is 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.620
 a crime I knew that google was coming 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.370
 preinstalled android and I knew that that 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.470
 it gave advantages 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.080
 his rivals but what he did not know is that 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.190
 that was illegal that was monopoly and for 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.500
 that basically surprised me 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.540
 we must also say that the United States defends 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.909
 to google and said that europe 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.190
 he simply accuses them because they can not 

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:54.420
 convert with your technology but good 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.680
 I personally, as I said, I think 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.019
 Google will be unscathed from this 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.790
 situation that is backed up 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:02.819
 by USA and apart is a company 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:05.400
 technological world and for what I have 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:08.250
 read has a very strong defense for 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.599
 get out of this case and well this has been 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.609
 I hope you liked it 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:13.950
 I am interested and that you have learned 

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:16.590
 something first apologize for me 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.690

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.160
