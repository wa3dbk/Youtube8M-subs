00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
stock and really I think it's probably a

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.320 
stock and really I think it's probably a
very<00:01:24.440> small<00:01:25.100> amount<00:01:25.220> of<00:01:25.460> items<00:01:25.640> because<00:01:26.150> it's

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
very small amount of items because it's

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.450 
very small amount of items because it's
really<00:01:26.720> just<00:01:26.870> powered<00:01:27.230> down<00:01:27.410> after<00:01:28.160> I<00:01:28.190> cleaned

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.250 
really just powered down after I cleaned
out<00:01:28.580> my<00:01:28.640> old<00:01:28.940> car<00:01:29.150> I<00:01:29.390> really<00:01:29.660> didn't<00:01:29.870> put<00:01:30.020> a<00:01:30.050> lot

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:30.260 
out my old car I really didn't put a lot

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.380 
out my old car I really didn't put a lot
of<00:01:30.380> it<00:01:30.500> back<00:01:30.620> in<00:01:30.680> I<00:01:31.100> just<00:01:31.670> put<00:01:31.850> the<00:01:31.970> essentials

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:03.700 
underneath here in fact I could probably

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:05.770 
underneath here in fact I could probably
now<00:06:04.700> that<00:06:04.850> I'm<00:06:04.940> looking<00:06:05.180> at<00:06:05.330> it<00:06:05.420> stick<00:06:05.630> these

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:05.780 
now that I'm looking at it stick these

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:07.420 
now that I'm looking at it stick these
things<00:06:06.140> down<00:06:06.470> they're<00:06:06.710> still<00:06:07.070> learning<00:06:07.160> all

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:07.430 
things down they're still learning all

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:10.300

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:12.040 
this but it has a really nice storage
area<00:06:10.460> right<00:06:10.820> now<00:06:10.970> what<00:06:11.210> I<00:06:11.240> have<00:06:11.450> there<00:06:11.720> is<00:06:11.750> a

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:12.050 
area right now what I have there is a

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:13.750 
area right now what I have there is a
first<00:06:12.500> aid<00:06:12.740> kit<00:06:12.980> that<00:06:13.190> my<00:06:13.280> husband<00:06:13.640> just

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:13.760 
first aid kit that my husband just

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.070 
first aid kit that my husband just
picked<00:06:14.000> up<00:06:14.090> actually<00:06:14.570> when<00:06:14.720> we<00:06:14.840> were<00:06:14.960> in

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:15.080 
picked up actually when we were in

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:17.590 
picked up actually when we were in
Missouri<00:06:15.440> and<00:06:15.740> then<00:06:16.370> in<00:06:16.730> case<00:06:16.910> of<00:06:17.060> emergency

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:17.600 
Missouri and then in case of emergency

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.420 
Missouri and then in case of emergency
some<00:06:17.780> jumper<00:06:18.080> cables<00:06:18.110> and<00:06:18.590> that<00:06:18.740> is<00:06:19.040> about<00:06:19.370> it

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:19.430 
some jumper cables and that is about it

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:21.100 
some jumper cables and that is about it
back<00:06:19.760> here<00:06:20.030> as<00:06:20.150> well<00:06:20.360> so<00:06:20.660> I<00:06:20.690> think<00:06:20.780> what<00:06:21.020> I'll

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:21.110 
back here as well so I think what I'll

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:22.420 
back here as well so I think what I'll
do<00:06:21.260> when<00:06:21.380> I'm<00:06:21.500> done<00:06:21.650> with<00:06:21.770> this<00:06:21.890> video<00:06:22.040> is

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:22.430 
do when I'm done with this video is

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:24.430 
do when I'm done with this video is
actually<00:06:22.970> stow<00:06:23.510> away<00:06:23.720> some<00:06:23.960> of<00:06:24.050> that<00:06:24.140> stuff

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:24.440 
actually stow away some of that stuff

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.950 
actually stow away some of that stuff
here<00:06:24.680> in<00:06:24.770> the<00:06:24.800> front<00:06:25.070> so<00:06:25.400> this<00:06:26.240> whole<00:06:26.450> space<00:06:26.780> up

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:26.960 
here in the front so this whole space up

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.210 
here in the front so this whole space up
here<00:06:27.140> will<00:06:27.230> be<00:06:27.260> clear<00:06:27.560> but<00:06:27.590> that's<00:06:27.800> all<00:06:27.980> I<00:06:28.010> have

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:28.220 
here will be clear but that's all I have

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:31.090 
here will be clear but that's all I have
in<00:06:28.310> the<00:06:28.400> back<00:06:28.550> as<00:06:28.730> well<00:06:28.910> and<00:06:29.800> that's<00:06:30.800> what<00:06:31.040> that

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:32.810 
looks like with those things stowed away

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:35.380 
looks like with those things stowed away
there<00:06:33.170> so<00:06:33.710> that<00:06:34.040> opens<00:06:34.610> up<00:06:34.760> that<00:06:34.940> area<00:06:35.180> over

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:35.390 
there so that opens up that area over

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:39.810
