00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.610
 a wet and cold spring with many 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.080
 rainy days and snowy region a 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:16.180
 low odds 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:19.330
 forage bees have been like this 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:22.419
 forced to remain in the hive i 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:24.550
 few glimpses of sunshine and many areas not 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:27.399
 have allowed sufficient collections for 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:30.189
 feeding the brood and so on 

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:33.779
 shortly the stocks of that little is but 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:33.779
 calcinated has disappeared 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:53.390
 to those who are cold has contributed to 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:57.280
 quickly exhaust the bees stocks 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.280
 they consume a lot to heat 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.580
 these stressful situations and 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:10.060
 hives responded by multiplying 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:13.120
 for beautiful or leave mature and ho 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:16.090
 way to safeguard your code 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:24.280
 genetic and more generally and vast 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:26.740
 we can humanize our own species 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.320
 think created that have lost theirs 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.930
 coordinator work they wanted 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:34.750
 give themselves new ones of the first and have therefore 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:37.720
 put in place new regions that 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:40.540
 it left hard is a party is kind 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.700
 of orgies of vertigo of freedom where 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.660
 each is free to choose with whom 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:48.210
 to stay 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:50.920
 and proposes new places and new horizons 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:54.990
 the acacia bloom and then a 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.990
 powerful stimulus to leave the other 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:08.540
 leaves mature this year turned out 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.979
 very intense and in many cases also 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:12.980
 out of control because the conditions 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:16.360
 weather prevented interventions 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.360
 estimates of two tractors 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:31.680
 the swarming has actually increased the 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.960
 artistic heritage but also strongly 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.660
 weakened the production capacity of the 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:40.200
 family in a season already gone 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:42.660
 quite bad too many swarms yes 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.390
 they lose because they are difficult or even 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:48.650
 impossible to harvest the others yes 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.650
 disperse for other causes 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.349
 rightly the friend marco gladly 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.440
 it matters that it leaves a distinguished mature 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:07.450
 natural for families but it is also one 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.390
 more or less developed feature 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.819
 marked and then invites to select the 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:16.390
 queens the family with low altitude 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:18.840
 swarming and replacing the queens 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.840
 old 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:38.170
 the recovery of swarms on plants can 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.420
 be very dangerous 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:43.150
 and if you are not as agile as your Jordanian friend 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:46.000
 Biscuits should desist 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:48.400
 in fact, it is not always with ropes poles yes 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.650
 manages to operate because the swarms 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.650
 they can carry very much 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:21.950
 are defined wild 10 years that 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:26.240
 the shelters are installed and prosper 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:29.330
 trees or walls it is important to identify them 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:32.480
 remove from the territory because they can 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:35.139
 constitute a potential outbreak of 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.139
 diseases
