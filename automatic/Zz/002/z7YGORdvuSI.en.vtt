teleport<00:07:09.110> I<00:07:09.410> never<00:07:10.010> said<00:07:10.280> my<00:07:10.430> plan<00:07:10.670> was

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:10.850 
teleport I never said my plan was

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:13.000 
teleport I never said my plan was
foolproof<00:07:11.060> now<00:07:11.840> that<00:07:12.110> I<00:07:12.140> think<00:07:12.260> about<00:07:12.560> it<00:07:12.740> I

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:13.010 
foolproof now that I think about it I

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:16.450 
foolproof now that I think about it I
might<00:07:13.580> have<00:07:13.760> a<00:07:13.790> way<00:07:14.000> down<00:07:14.180> there<00:07:14.320> but<00:07:15.460> not

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:16.460 
might have a way down there but not

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:19.930 
might have a way down there but not
exactly<00:07:16.850> safe<00:07:17.270> how<00:07:18.050> not<00:07:18.320> safe<00:07:18.650> oh<00:07:18.950> god<00:07:19.730> oh<00:07:19.760> god

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:19.940 
exactly safe how not safe oh god oh god

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:21.520 
exactly safe how not safe oh god oh god
we<00:07:20.390> just<00:07:20.420> went<00:07:20.750> through<00:07:20.840> the<00:07:21.020> void<00:07:21.200> and<00:07:21.440> now

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:21.530 
we just went through the void and now

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:23.950 
we just went through the void and now
we're<00:07:21.710> inside<00:07:22.070> out<00:07:22.340> how<00:07:23.150> close<00:07:23.510> can<00:07:23.720> you<00:07:23.780> get

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:23.960 
we're inside out how close can you get

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:26.230 
we're inside out how close can you get
us<00:07:24.310> theoretically<00:07:25.310> I<00:07:25.430> can<00:07:25.730> put<00:07:25.910> us<00:07:26.000> at<00:07:26.150> the

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:26.240 
us theoretically I can put us at the

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.540 
us theoretically I can put us at the
base<00:07:26.390> of<00:07:26.420> the<00:07:26.690> portal<00:07:27.080> that's<00:07:27.710> way<00:07:28.040> beyond<00:07:28.400> my

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:28.550 
base of the portal that's way beyond my

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:31.000 
base of the portal that's way beyond my
teleport<00:07:29.060> range<00:07:29.330> whatever<00:07:30.200> we<00:07:30.410> decide<00:07:30.710> to<00:07:30.770> do

we<00:07:31.250> need<00:07:31.430> to<00:07:31.550> do<00:07:31.640> it<00:07:31.790> quickly<00:07:31.820> wind<00:07:32.480> drift<00:07:32.660> and

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:32.840 
we need to do it quickly wind drift and

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:35.320 
we need to do it quickly wind drift and
Ella<00:07:33.020> are<00:07:33.140> making<00:07:33.560> their<00:07:33.710> move<00:07:33.890> I<00:07:34.190> hope<00:07:35.120> they
