some<00:00:07.170> more<00:00:07.610> intricacies<00:00:08.610> of<00:00:08.639> our<00:00:08.880> mix<00:00:09.150> now<00:00:09.360> and

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:09.710 
some more intricacies of our mix now and

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.770 
some more intricacies of our mix now and
we're<00:00:10.710> fusing<00:00:11.460> to<00:00:11.700> Stevie<00:00:12.210> Wonder<00:00:12.509> tracks

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.410 
together all the intros to them anyway
and<00:00:15.080> we're<00:00:16.080> using<00:00:16.260> surgical<00:00:17.420> superstition

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
and we're using surgical superstition

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.380 
and we're using surgical superstition
the<00:00:18.690> opening<00:00:19.170> sections<00:00:19.680> of<00:00:19.859> each<00:00:20.150> which<00:00:21.150> have

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
the opening sections of each which have

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.170 
the opening sections of each which have
a<00:00:21.660> huge<00:00:22.320> impact<00:00:22.500> and<00:00:23.100> we're<00:00:23.519> going<00:00:23.640> to<00:00:23.670> drop<00:00:23.880> an

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
a huge impact and we're going to drop an

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.630 
a huge impact and we're going to drop an
a<00:00:24.359> capella<00:00:24.720> over<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.080> top<00:00:25.320> and<00:00:25.529> I'm<00:00:26.430> going<00:00:26.609> to

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
a capella over the top and I'm going to

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.359 
a capella over the top and I'm going to
use<00:00:26.760> a<00:00:26.789> little<00:00:27.000> scratch<00:00:27.449> sample<00:00:27.990> to<00:00:28.830> introduce

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
use a little scratch sample to introduce

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.340 
use a little scratch sample to introduce
it<00:00:29.580> so<00:00:29.820> we've<00:00:30.750> got<00:00:30.960> rocks<00:00:31.230> and<00:00:31.439> shanties<00:00:33.350> to

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
it so we've got rocks and shanties to

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.639 
it so we've got rocks and shanties to
introduce<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:35.149> sequence<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:36.559> we've<00:00:37.559> got

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649

doesn't you'll see listen doesn't quite
stop<00:01:32.100> as<00:01:32.310> well<00:01:32.340> as<00:01:32.880> if<00:01:33.150> you<00:01:33.329> start<00:01:34.110> it<00:01:34.290> from<00:01:34.500> the

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
stop as well as if you start it from the

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:44.219 
stop as well as if you start it from the
hip<00:01:34.979> Howie<00:01:35.220> so<00:01:35.520> show<00:01:36.329> you<00:01:36.390> again

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:46.719 

for<00:01:45.229> me<00:01:45.380> that<00:01:45.409> kind<00:01:45.859> of<00:01:45.920> stops<00:01:46.159> better<00:01:46.399> and<00:01:46.640> if

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
for me that kind of stops better and if

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:48.370 
for me that kind of stops better and if
it<00:01:46.909> works<00:01:47.179> that<00:01:47.479> as<00:01:47.630> you<00:01:47.780> come<00:01:47.929> into<00:01:48.079> surgery

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
it works that as you come into surgery

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.969 
it works that as you come into surgery
so<00:01:48.920> let<00:01:49.640> me<00:01:49.670> show<00:01:50.270> you<00:01:50.299> from<00:01:50.509> scratch<00:01:50.840> and<00:01:51.170> will

so let me show you from scratch and will

00:01:51.979 --> 00:02:26.259 
so let me show you from scratch and will
run<00:01:52.189> through<00:01:52.250> it<00:02:24.069> just<00:02:25.069> don't<00:02:25.310> care<00:02:25.640> I<00:02:25.879> can't

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:26.269 
run through it just don't care I can't

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:29.229 
run through it just don't care I can't
do<00:02:26.450> smell<00:02:26.829> and<00:02:27.829> I<00:02:27.980> kind<00:02:28.310> of<00:02:28.400> wanted<00:02:28.700> to<00:02:28.849> but<00:02:29.209> I

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 
do smell and I kind of wanted to but I

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:46.979 
do smell and I kind of wanted to but I
guess<00:02:29.510> I<00:02:29.629> got<00:02:29.840> no<00:02:29.870> choice<00:02:30.140> rats<00:02:31.040> and<00:02:31.340> what

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:03:00.330 

my<00:02:47.989> head<00:02:56.620> under

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.220 

so<00:03:01.340> you<00:03:01.400> can<00:03:01.550> tell<00:03:01.760> that<00:03:01.790> I've<00:03:02.120> pre<00:03:02.660> edited

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
so you can tell that I've pre edited

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.100 
so you can tell that I've pre edited
that<00:03:03.350> sequence<00:03:03.980> so<00:03:04.460> the<00:03:04.940> Sergio<00:03:05.480> control<00:03:05.990> is

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
that sequence so the Sergio control is

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.000 
that sequence so the Sergio control is
looped<00:03:06.470> and<00:03:06.890> right<00:03:07.430> on<00:03:07.700> the<00:03:07.990> cream<00:03:08.990> point<00:03:09.380> it

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
looped and right on the cream point it

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.610 
looped and right on the cream point it
drops<00:03:10.250> in<00:03:10.430> to<00:03:10.580> superstition<00:03:11.080> another<00:03:12.080> handy

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
drops in to superstition another handy

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.460 
drops in to superstition another handy
feature<00:03:12.920> of<00:03:13.820> being<00:03:14.570> able<00:03:14.660> to<00:03:14.810> pre<00:03:15.110> produce

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
feature of being able to pre produce

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.150
