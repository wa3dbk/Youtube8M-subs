00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:07.869
 let's prepare chicken with aurora sauce 

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:10.000
 The ingredients we need are 4 

00:00:07.869 --> 00:00:11.980
 whole chicken breasts 2 tablespoons 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.650
 of bread crumbs 2 tablespoons of cheese 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:17.050
 Parmesan or to taste pepper salt and 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.599
 oil and for the sauce half a liter of 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.609
 milk 50 grams of flour 50 of 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:25.179
 butter 3 tablespoons of pasta 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:28.390
 tomato or tomato fried nutmeg salt and 

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:31.480
 pepper we start by picking up a pan 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:33.700
 or iron we throw a little bit of 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.250
 oil and we will teach our 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:39.070
 breasts 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.900
 we have to leave them golden but not 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:44.040
 they need to be done inside 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:46.440
 then take a while oven 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.960
 At the time, we put a little on the face 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.260
 for which it is already sealed and we throw 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:56.030
 a pinch of pepper and when 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.030
 we have sealed by all parties 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:02.290
 we are going to put on a tray 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.290
 oven 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.780
 and we're going to continue with the breasts that 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.520
 we are missing we are reserving them in 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:14.290
 our baking tray and the oven what 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.290
 We preheat to 200 degrees 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.590
 We reserve it on the tray and we'll 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.930
 continue making our aurora sauce 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:26.640
 which is nothing more than a bechamel with 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:29.350
 tomato but that gives a great touch 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.560
 we melted the butter and when 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:35.110
 melted completely we add the flour the 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.670
 which we are going to move very well until it 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.740
 toast 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.390
 we know it's all been because 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:44.240
 we will perceive in the smell 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:47.659
 once we were adding milk to 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:50.600
 little trickles and integrating it in the 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:52.729
 flour do not worry about the lumps 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.790
 well, if we make the bÃ©chamel with chorritos 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:59.530
 short cuts the flour is integrated well 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.530
 and we will never get lumps 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.560
 it's a matter of insisting the bechamel not 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:07.929
 has milk trick does not need to 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:11.620
 be neither cold nor hot is simply 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:15.970
 go throwing in small chorrillos 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:18.430
 until we have it all integrated 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.820
 We season it a little bit, we throw it 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.820
 nutmeg 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:28.560
 and also a pinch of pepper 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:32.050
 and with the fire gave me a little bit strong 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.910
 we are expressing it without stopping to move and 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:36.400
 when it starts to thicken we add the 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.260
 tomato 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.989
 the tomato is to the taste of each one 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.659
 we can put more or less and go testing 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:48.599
 to see how we like more we 

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:48.599
 missing a pinch of salt is given we add 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.959
 and we cover our breasts well 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.850
 once we have them well covered the 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.660
 let's sprinkle with parmesan cheese 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.660
 grated 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.550
 and with a little bit of breadcrumbs that 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:12.710
 It will give a very rich crunchy point 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:15.770
 and we're going to put them in the oven that 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:18.470
 we have 200 degrees hot and the 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:21.890
 We will have between 20 and 30 minutes 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:24.380
 according to we like more or less made a 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.780
 Once we have them, we take them out 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:29.000
 We serve with a little salad and 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:31.940
 ready and we have our breasts with 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:36.260
 aurora sauce that you see is a recipe 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:38.480
 easy cheap and very fast we can 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:41.540
 prepare for children and adults as the 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:46.300
 Dora sauce is surprising and I can 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.300
 make sure you 're delicious
