00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:03.200 
get out of here faster but you're gonna

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.440 
get out of here faster but you're gonna
see<00:05:03.410> a<00:05:03.440> much<00:05:03.650> better<00:05:03.860> display<00:05:04.250> of<00:05:04.400> this<00:05:04.550> in<00:05:05.360> a

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:05.450 
see a much better display of this in a

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:09.460 
see a much better display of this in a
minute<00:05:05.750> but<00:05:06.440> yeah<00:05:07.930> wall<00:05:08.930> jump<00:05:09.200> makes<00:05:09.320> your

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:09.470 
minute but yeah wall jump makes your

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:15.700 
minute but yeah wall jump makes your
friend<00:05:10.390> when<00:05:11.390> I<00:05:11.420> ball<00:05:11.690> jump<00:05:14.380> that<00:05:15.380> wasn't

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:15.710 
friend when I ball jump that wasn't

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.250 
friend when I ball jump that wasn't
horrible<00:05:16.220> but<00:05:16.280> yeah<00:05:16.880> it's<00:05:17.330> pretty<00:05:17.600> damn<00:05:17.930> good

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:18.260 
horrible but yeah it's pretty damn good

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.220 
horrible but yeah it's pretty damn good
i<00:05:18.560> would<00:05:18.980> say<00:05:19.720> considering<00:05:20.720> i<00:05:20.930> haven't<00:05:20.960> played

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:21.230 
i would say considering i haven't played

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:27.280 
i would say considering i haven't played
in<00:05:21.440> a<00:05:21.530> while<00:05:21.560> now<00:05:23.290> anyway<00:05:25.660> since<00:05:26.660> that's<00:05:26.960> done

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:27.290 
in a while now anyway since that's done

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
you guys are going to see the speed tips

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:34.060 
you guys are going to see the speed tips
on<00:05:30.260> Ceres<00:05:30.830> station<00:05:31.510> so<00:05:32.510> I'll<00:05:32.630> see<00:05:32.990> how<00:05:33.230> I<00:05:33.260> could

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:34.070 
on Ceres station so I'll see how I could

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:35.920 
on Ceres station so I'll see how I could
get<00:05:34.220> a<00:05:34.250> fast<00:05:34.550> time<00:05:34.880> or<00:05:35.180> anybody<00:05:35.510> else<00:05:35.690> can<00:05:35.720> get

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:35.930 
get a fast time or anybody else can get

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:38.680 
get a fast time or anybody else can get
a<00:05:35.990> fast<00:05:36.260> time<00:05:36.500> but<00:05:37.400> this<00:05:37.520> is<00:05:37.580> by<00:05:38.030> no<00:05:38.090> means<00:05:38.270> the

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:38.690 
a fast time but this is by no means the

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:41.770 
a fast time but this is by no means the
fastest<00:05:39.290> time<00:05:39.500> I<00:05:39.740> just<00:05:40.100> did<00:05:40.330> pretty<00:05:41.330> damn<00:05:41.510> good

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:41.780 
fastest time I just did pretty damn good

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:43.420 
fastest time I just did pretty damn good
I<00:05:41.840> didn't<00:05:42.200> do<00:05:42.290> perfect<00:05:42.860> because<00:05:42.980> if<00:05:43.130> I'd<00:05:43.220> want

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:43.430 
I didn't do perfect because if I'd want

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:46.380 
I didn't do perfect because if I'd want
a<00:05:43.460> real<00:05:43.610> perfect<00:05:44.090> okay<00:05:44.360> Contras<00:05:44.750> of<00:05:44.870> tries<00:05:45.290> so

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:46.390 
a real perfect okay Contras of tries so

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:49.690 
a real perfect okay Contras of tries so
here<00:05:47.390> you<00:05:47.510> go<00:05:48.010> when<00:05:49.010> you're<00:05:49.130> on<00:05:49.280> the<00:05:49.310> left<00:05:49.550> side

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:49.700 
here you go when you're on the left side

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:51.370 
here you go when you're on the left side
of<00:05:49.760> the<00:05:49.850> platform<00:05:50.060> push<00:05:50.810> right<00:05:51.020> when<00:05:51.260> you're

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:51.380 
of the platform push right when you're

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:52.900 
of the platform push right when you're
on<00:05:51.440> the<00:05:51.500> right<00:05:51.770> side<00:05:51.980> of<00:05:52.070> platform<00:05:52.430> push<00:05:52.640> left

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:52.910 
on the right side of platform push left

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:54.820 
on the right side of platform push left
three<00:05:53.600> ways<00:05:53.750> of<00:05:53.900> doing<00:05:54.110> this<00:05:54.140> you<00:05:54.380> can<00:05:54.560> see<00:05:54.620> it

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:54.830 
three ways of doing this you can see it

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.100 
three ways of doing this you can see it
either<00:05:55.040> the<00:05:55.370> L<00:05:55.520> button<00:05:55.760> jump<00:05:56.570> into<00:05:56.720> a<00:05:56.810> ball<00:05:57.080> and

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:57.110 
either the L button jump into a ball and

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:00.310 
either the L button jump into a ball and
turn<00:05:57.380> left<00:05:57.560> and<00:05:57.920> do<00:05:58.190> that<00:05:58.370> or<00:05:58.640> just<00:05:59.570> stand<00:06:00.080> up

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:00.320 
turn left and do that or just stand up

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:05.140 
turn left and do that or just stand up
like<00:06:01.070> I<00:06:01.220> did<00:06:01.250> in<00:06:01.490> these<00:06:01.670> i<00:06:03.730> normally<00:06:04.730> use<00:06:04.760> the<00:06:05.000> R

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:05.150 
like I did in these i normally use the R

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:07.840 
like I did in these i normally use the R
button<00:06:05.450> to<00:06:05.810> stop<00:06:06.770> from<00:06:07.040> stalling<00:06:07.340> as<00:06:07.640> much

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:07.850 
button to stop from stalling as much

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:10.060 
button to stop from stalling as much
usually<00:06:08.690> saves<00:06:08.960> me<00:06:09.140> saves<00:06:09.560> me<00:06:09.740> a<00:06:09.770> little<00:06:09.950> bit

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:10.070 
usually saves me saves me a little bit

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:13.060 
usually saves me saves me a little bit
of<00:06:10.220> time<00:06:10.430> and<00:06:11.560> basically<00:06:12.560> you<00:06:12.710> just<00:06:12.740> want<00:06:12.920> to

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:13.070 
of time and basically you just want to

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:14.920 
of time and basically you just want to
watch<00:06:13.190> out<00:06:13.400> for<00:06:13.580> the<00:06:13.700> debris<00:06:14.030> and<00:06:14.360> right<00:06:14.630> here

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:14.930 
watch out for the debris and right here

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:16.630 
watch out for the debris and right here
I<00:06:15.140> stopped<00:06:15.440> holding<00:06:15.620> the<00:06:15.890> left<00:06:16.040> directional

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:16.640 
I stopped holding the left directional

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.820 
I stopped holding the left directional
and<00:06:16.760> push<00:06:17.570> it<00:06:17.690> again<00:06:17.900> running<00:06:18.080> this<00:06:18.290> thing

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:18.830 
and push it again running this thing

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:20.500 
and push it again running this thing
starts<00:06:19.160> rolling<00:06:19.370> at<00:06:19.970> the<00:06:20.150> end<00:06:20.270> of<00:06:20.330> those

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:20.510 
starts rolling at the end of those

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:22.300 
starts rolling at the end of those
stairs<00:06:20.870> you<00:06:21.230> got<00:06:21.380> ways<00:06:21.560> to<00:06:21.770> stop<00:06:22.010> stalling

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:22.310 
stairs you got ways to stop stalling

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:23.780 
stairs you got ways to stop stalling
before<00:06:22.760> you<00:06:22.820> can<00:06:22.970> jump

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:23.790 
before you can jump

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:25.640 
before you can jump
and<00:06:23.940> in<00:06:24.210> here<00:06:24.510> basically<00:06:24.900> just<00:06:25.290> run<00:06:25.470> through

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:25.650 
and in here basically just run through

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:27.920 
and in here basically just run through
it's<00:06:25.860> not<00:06:26.010> a<00:06:26.040> big<00:06:26.220> deal<00:06:26.450> and<00:06:27.450> you<00:06:27.510> want<00:06:27.690> to<00:06:27.750> jump

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:27.930 
it's not a big deal and you want to jump

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:29.900 
it's not a big deal and you want to jump
just<00:06:28.260> as<00:06:28.470> you're<00:06:28.620> getting<00:06:28.830> into<00:06:28.950> the<00:06:29.160> door<00:06:29.340> to

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:29.910 
just as you're getting into the door to

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:32.600 
just as you're getting into the door to
the<00:06:29.940> wall<00:06:30.270> jump<00:06:30.510> here<00:06:30.750> and<00:06:31.140> use<00:06:31.620> the<00:06:31.740> elbow<00:06:32.070> at

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:32.610 
the wall jump here and use the elbow at

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:35.300 
the wall jump here and use the elbow at
the<00:06:32.760> peak<00:06:32.970> of<00:06:33.090> your<00:06:33.150> jump<00:06:33.450> to<00:06:33.830> have<00:06:34.830> less<00:06:35.040> as<00:06:35.250> a

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:35.310 
the peak of your jump to have less as a

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:38.930 
the peak of your jump to have less as a
little<00:06:35.790> bleh<00:06:36.030> I<00:06:36.830> would<00:06:37.830> normally<00:06:38.010> record<00:06:38.700> more

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:38.940 
little bleh I would normally record more

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.990 
little bleh I would normally record more
than<00:06:39.150> that<00:06:39.560> but<00:06:40.560> I<00:06:40.980> think<00:06:41.190> that's<00:06:41.700> good<00:06:41.910> enough

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:42.000 
than that but I think that's good enough

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.770 
than that but I think that's good enough
for<00:06:42.180> now<00:06:43.340> because<00:06:44.340> you<00:06:44.880> know<00:06:44.970> that's<00:06:45.630> the

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:45.780 
for now because you know that's the
