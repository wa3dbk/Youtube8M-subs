00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.499 
basically I got gypped out of like a
hundred<00:01:19.860> bucks<00:01:20.159> and<00:01:20.460> with<00:01:20.610> this<00:01:20.729> website<00:01:21.180> you

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
hundred bucks and with this website you

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.210 
hundred bucks and with this website you
make<00:01:21.689> your<00:01:21.869> prices<00:01:22.290> you<00:01:22.470> actually<00:01:22.710> don't<00:01:22.860> sell

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
make your prices you actually don't sell

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.160 
make your prices you actually don't sell
them<00:01:23.340> with<00:01:23.610> dollars<00:01:24.509> you<00:01:24.689> sell<00:01:24.900> them<00:01:24.990> with

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
them with dollars you sell them with

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.770 
them with dollars you sell them with
virtual<00:01:25.650> coins<00:01:26.040> one<00:01:26.729> coin<00:01:26.970> equals<00:01:27.360> one<00:01:27.540> dollar

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
virtual coins one coin equals one dollar

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.929 
virtual coins one coin equals one dollar
so<00:01:28.170> it's<00:01:28.560> basically<00:01:28.770> just<00:01:28.979> dollars<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:29.729> you

so it's basically just dollars and you
can<00:01:30.060> just<00:01:30.180> put<00:01:30.329> them<00:01:30.420> for<00:01:30.570> as<00:01:30.659> many<00:01:30.780> coins<00:01:31.049> as

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
can just put them for as many coins as

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.020 
can just put them for as many coins as
you<00:01:31.350> want<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:31.770> people<00:01:32.009> will<00:01:32.310> buy<00:01:32.490> them<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:32.880> if
