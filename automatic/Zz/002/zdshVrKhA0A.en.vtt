00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.850 
the players move the controls very
responsive<00:02:38.500> but<00:02:39.500> I<00:02:39.560> think<00:02:39.770> especially

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
responsive but I think especially

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.130

of<00:03:18.650> our<00:03:18.830> game<00:03:19.040> is<00:03:19.310> so<00:03:20.060> much<00:03:20.240> better<00:03:20.420> this<00:03:20.660> year

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
of our game is so much better this year

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.550 
of our game is so much better this year
we<00:03:21.080> have<00:03:21.520> much<00:03:22.520> more<00:03:22.730> realistic<00:03:23.560> audio

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
we have much more realistic audio

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.480 
we have much more realistic audio
commentary<00:03:25.330> crowds<00:03:26.500> cameras<00:03:27.500> everything

commentary crowds cameras everything

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:30.130 
commentary crowds cameras everything
looks<00:03:28.700> much<00:03:28.940> more<00:03:29.150> like<00:03:29.209> a<00:03:29.390> real<00:03:29.750> NBA

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
looks much more like a real NBA

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.120 
looks much more like a real NBA
broadcast<00:03:30.970> so<00:03:31.970> I<00:03:32.000> think<00:03:32.269> NBA<00:03:33.080> 2k<00:03:33.470> is<00:03:33.530> a<00:03:33.709> very

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
broadcast so I think NBA 2k is a very

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.240 
broadcast so I think NBA 2k is a very
good<00:03:34.220> competitor<00:03:35.000> of<00:03:35.030> ours<00:03:35.830> we<00:03:36.830> play<00:03:37.040> their

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
good competitor of ours we play their

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.130 
good competitor of ours we play their
game<00:03:37.459> to<00:03:37.790> learn<00:03:37.970> from<00:03:38.180> it<00:03:38.390> and<00:03:38.420> they<00:03:38.780> play<00:03:38.989> our

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
game to learn from it and they play our

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:40.630 
game to learn from it and they play our
game<00:03:39.350> to<00:03:39.590> learn<00:03:39.739> from<00:03:39.890> us<00:03:40.100> so<00:03:40.400> it's<00:03:40.550> a<00:03:40.610> very

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 
game to learn from us so it's a very

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.449 
game to learn from us so it's a very
good<00:03:40.850> competition<00:03:41.709> but<00:03:42.709> I<00:03:42.739> feel<00:03:42.980> it<00:03:43.130> this<00:03:43.220> year

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
good competition but I feel it this year

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:46.380 
good competition but I feel it this year
we<00:03:43.670> have<00:03:44.290> very<00:03:45.290> good<00:03:45.470> visuals<00:03:45.920> and<00:03:46.130> graphics

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
we have very good visuals and graphics

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.880 
we have very good visuals and graphics
the<00:03:47.390> best<00:03:47.600> I've<00:03:47.780> seen<00:03:47.810> in<00:03:48.080> a<00:03:48.410> basketball<00:03:48.800> game

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890 
the best I've seen in a basketball game

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:52.420 
the best I've seen in a basketball game
and<00:03:49.310> we<00:03:50.000> have<00:03:50.209> I<00:03:50.570> think<00:03:51.470> the<00:03:51.769> best<00:03:51.980> player

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
and we have I think the best player

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.090 
and we have I think the best player
control<00:03:53.000> so<00:03:53.840> the<00:03:53.989> most<00:03:54.170> options<00:03:54.500> to<00:03:54.920> control

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.100 
control so the most options to control

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.100 
control so the most options to control
your<00:03:55.370> players<00:03:55.670> the<00:03:55.970> way<00:03:56.090> that<00:03:56.330> real<00:03:56.540> player
