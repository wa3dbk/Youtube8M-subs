you<00:02:09.490> I'm<00:02:09.910> getting<00:02:10.180> kind<00:02:10.869> of<00:02:10.960> crappy<00:02:11.380> dives

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
you I'm getting kind of crappy dives

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.160 
you I'm getting kind of crappy dives
here<00:02:12.130> okay<00:02:12.610> that<00:02:12.760> one<00:02:12.880> was<00:02:13.000> 16,000<00:02:13.750> want<00:02:13.930> too

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
here okay that one was 16,000 want too

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.420 
here okay that one was 16,000 want too
bad<00:02:15.600> alright<00:02:16.600> so<00:02:17.110> and<00:02:17.380> again<00:02:17.650> the<00:02:17.860> reason<00:02:18.160> you

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
bad alright so and again the reason you

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.580 
bad alright so and again the reason you
stay<00:02:18.640> away<00:02:18.880> from<00:02:18.910> so-called<00:02:19.420> adrenalin<00:02:20.320> zones

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
stay away from so-called adrenalin zones

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.920 
stay away from so-called adrenalin zones
is<00:02:20.950> because<00:02:21.640> the<00:02:21.790> game<00:02:21.970> tells<00:02:22.330> you<00:02:22.540> that's<00:02:22.690> the

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
is because the game tells you that's the

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.510 
is because the game tells you that's the
best<00:02:22.960> place<00:02:23.350> to<00:02:23.380> go<00:02:23.710> but<00:02:24.010> it<00:02:24.100> really<00:02:24.250> isn't

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
best place to go but it really isn't

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.040 
best place to go but it really isn't
because<00:02:24.730> all<00:02:25.060> that<00:02:25.180> doesn't<00:02:25.510> give<00:02:25.630> you<00:02:25.720> extra

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
because all that doesn't give you extra

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.830 
because all that doesn't give you extra
adrenaline<00:02:26.290> but<00:02:26.710> this<00:02:26.860> so<00:02:27.040> few<00:02:27.310> cars<00:02:27.660> so<00:02:28.660> that

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
adrenaline but this so few cars so that

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.630 
adrenaline but this so few cars so that
any<00:02:28.990> benefit<00:02:29.530> you<00:02:29.680> get<00:02:29.920> by<00:02:30.100> going<00:02:30.280> to<00:02:30.520> the

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
any benefit you get by going to the

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.790 
any benefit you get by going to the
spots<00:02:30.940> the<00:02:31.150> game<00:02:31.330> is<00:02:31.480> telling<00:02:31.840> you<00:02:31.930> to<00:02:31.960> go<00:02:32.230> go<00:02:32.740> -

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
spots the game is telling you to go go -

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:38.250 
spots the game is telling you to go go -
it's<00:02:33.310> just<00:02:34.980> more<00:02:35.980> than<00:02:36.250> offset<00:02:36.910> by<00:02:36.940> the<00:02:37.260> the

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
it's just more than offset by the the

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.230 
it's just more than offset by the the
fact<00:02:38.770> that<00:02:38.860> it's<00:02:39.040> the<00:02:39.190> terrible<00:02:39.490> locations

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.240

just have to get run over that's what

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.890 
just have to get run over that's what
makes<00:04:10.530> this<00:04:10.680> much<00:04:10.980> much<00:04:11.280> much<00:04:11.550> easier<00:04:12.209> so<00:04:12.780> as

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
makes this much much much easier so as

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.140

you<00:04:13.050> can<00:04:13.140> see<00:04:13.200> this<00:04:13.770> is<00:04:13.980> really<00:04:14.790> really<00:04:15.000> easy

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
you can see this is really really easy

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.479 
you can see this is really really easy
much<00:04:15.780> easier<00:04:15.810> than<00:04:16.350> doing<00:04:16.980> it<00:04:17.190> the<00:04:17.280> way<00:04:17.370> the

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
much easier than doing it the way the

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.789 
much easier than doing it the way the
game<00:04:17.640> tells<00:04:17.940> you<00:04:18.030> to<00:04:18.120> do<00:04:18.329> so<00:04:19.140> I'm<00:04:19.470> going<00:04:19.650> to<00:04:19.709> be
