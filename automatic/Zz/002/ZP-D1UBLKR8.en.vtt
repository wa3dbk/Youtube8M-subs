00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.340
 once 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.410
 hi youtube people how are you and 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.080
 well i'm not do i will teach you how to 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.599
 change the icon pack in our 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.369
 native launcher and good to do this 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:26.130
 we will need this application called 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.710
 awesome icons has 10,000 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.789
 downloads and a score of 4 and it's 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.949
 free 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.010
 then once installed we're going to 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.470
 open and with this would be the interface of the 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.320
 application here we have a bar 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:42.000
 lateral where it shows us in the 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.210
 packages of icons that we have 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.520
 installed and here an option that we 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.820
 recommend icon pack for 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.100
 download them then to be able to change 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.670
 what would be the icons of our 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.739
 native launcher because as they were here I 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.050
 I have launcher that comes with motorola 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.960
 then to change them simply 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.060
 we went to ozone itunes and here we 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.520
 would come out in all applications that 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.979
 we have installed the first icon is the 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.470
 original of the application and the rest that 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.080
 is locked in a square are the 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.000
 that would be the version of each package 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.860
 icon and here I'll try for that 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.920
 with the calculator application 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.560
 then this is the original icon this 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.479
 elvis and select one that we want 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.450
 our icons in this pack 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:34.110
 case I will select this that belongs to the 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.570
 package icons neon ex and with this 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.450
 original silicon and this one that 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.930
 would change and here we can change the 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.119
 name then when we have it ready 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.800
 we give it to ok and when we go out to 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.990
 our desk will create a 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.180
 direct access with the icon that 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.100
 we select to access our 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.380
 application in this case the 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.970
