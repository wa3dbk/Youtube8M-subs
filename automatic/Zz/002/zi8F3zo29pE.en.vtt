that will protect you from fire fire

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:08.930 
that will protect you from fire fire
seems<00:02:07.920> to<00:02:08.009> be<00:02:08.070> the<00:02:08.190> only<00:02:08.310> thing<00:02:08.550> that<00:02:08.670> can<00:02:08.759> hurt

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
seems to be the only thing that can hurt

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.540 
seems to be the only thing that can hurt
you<00:02:09.149> it<00:02:09.330> doesn't<00:02:09.479> seem<00:02:09.780> like<00:02:09.960> the<00:02:10.590> environment

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
you it doesn't seem like the environment

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.400 
you it doesn't seem like the environment
can<00:02:11.880> hurt<00:02:12.090> you<00:02:12.270> like<00:02:12.480> falling<00:02:13.020> rocks<00:02:13.230> and

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
can hurt you like falling rocks and

can hurt you like falling rocks and
things<00:02:13.530> just<00:02:13.709> kind<00:02:13.830> of<00:02:14.040> push<00:02:14.220> you<00:02:14.370> around<00:02:15.260> now

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
things just kind of push you around now

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.870 
things just kind of push you around now
each<00:02:16.440> area<00:02:16.890> is<00:02:17.660> divided<00:02:18.660> into<00:02:18.870> zones<00:02:19.070> so<00:02:20.070> as

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
each area is divided into zones so as

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.550 
each area is divided into zones so as
you<00:02:21.120> can<00:02:21.209> see<00:02:21.330> you<00:02:21.360> can<00:02:21.450> only<00:02:21.690> carry<00:02:21.959> 10<00:02:22.260> people

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
you can see you can only carry 10 people

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.910 
you can see you can only carry 10 people
at<00:02:22.620> a<00:02:22.680> time<00:02:22.920> and<00:02:24.290> you<00:02:25.290> have<00:02:25.380> to<00:02:25.500> drop<00:02:25.650> them<00:02:25.800> off

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
at a time and you have to drop them off

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.480 
at a time and you have to drop them off
at<00:02:26.040> the<00:02:26.130> little<00:02:26.340> pads<00:02:26.700> there<00:02:28.040> so<00:02:29.040> I'm<00:02:29.130> doing<00:02:29.370> my

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
at the little pads there so I'm doing my

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.380 
at the little pads there so I'm doing my
best<00:02:29.520> to<00:02:29.970> go<00:02:30.840> around<00:02:31.140> and<00:02:31.620> do<00:02:31.890> that<00:02:32.390> avoiding

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
best to go around and do that avoiding

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:34.550 
best to go around and do that avoiding
the<00:02:33.480> fire<00:02:33.720> of<00:02:33.900> course<00:02:34.110> because<00:02:34.290> that<00:02:34.410> can

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
the fire of course because that can

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.699 
the fire of course because that can
damage<00:02:34.709> it<00:02:34.920> now<00:02:35.100> if<00:02:35.340> you<00:02:35.430> press<00:02:35.610> the<00:02:35.730> spacebar

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
damage it now if you press the spacebar

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.060 
damage it now if you press the spacebar
you<00:02:37.709> can<00:02:37.920> actually<00:02:38.070> as<00:02:38.580> we're<00:02:39.060> doing<00:02:39.270> here

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070 
you can actually as we're doing here

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:42.229 
you can actually as we're doing here
spray<00:02:41.070> water<00:02:41.310> everywhere<00:02:41.640> and<00:02:41.700> put<00:02:41.940> the<00:02:42.060> fire

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
spray water everywhere and put the fire

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.020 
spray water everywhere and put the fire
out<00:02:42.270> and<00:02:42.660> that<00:02:42.930> lets<00:02:43.140> you<00:02:43.260> collect<00:02:43.560> the<00:02:43.800> money

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
out and that lets you collect the money

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.430 
out and that lets you collect the money
collecting<00:02:45.030> money<00:02:45.300> of<00:02:45.450> course<00:02:45.480> lets<00:02:46.170> you<00:02:46.290> use

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
collecting money of course lets you use

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.550 
collecting money of course lets you use
the<00:02:46.470> boosts<00:02:47.930> but<00:02:48.930> collecting<00:02:49.470> the<00:02:49.530> money

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
the boosts but collecting the money

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.740 
the boosts but collecting the money
obviously<00:02:50.010> takes<00:02:50.640> time<00:02:50.910> as<00:02:51.120> you<00:02:51.209> can<00:02:51.330> see<00:02:51.510> each

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
obviously takes time as you can see each

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.380 
obviously takes time as you can see each
zone<00:02:52.250> requires<00:02:53.250> a<00:02:53.400> certain<00:02:53.640> other<00:02:53.880> people<00:02:54.270> to

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
zone requires a certain other people to

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.180 
zone requires a certain other people to
rescue<00:02:54.900> before<00:02:55.440> you<00:02:55.680> can<00:02:55.830> go<00:02:55.920> in<00:02:56.070> there<00:02:56.420> and

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
rescue before you can go in there and

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.190 
rescue before you can go in there and
that's<00:02:59.190> just<00:02:59.430> a<00:02:59.519> matter<00:02:59.730> of<00:03:00.170> dropping<00:03:01.170> people

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
that's just a matter of dropping people

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.110 
that's just a matter of dropping people
off<00:03:01.530> as<00:03:02.040> you<00:03:02.160> can<00:03:02.250> see<00:03:02.340> the<00:03:02.459> number<00:03:02.700> it<00:03:03.090> goes

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
off as you can see the number it goes

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.670 
off as you can see the number it goes
down<00:03:03.510> like<00:03:03.780> that<00:03:05.780> so<00:03:06.780> what<00:03:06.900> I<00:03:06.930> am<00:03:07.110> finding<00:03:07.380> is

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
down like that so what I am finding is

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.670 
down like that so what I am finding is
that<00:03:07.790> if<00:03:08.790> you<00:03:09.180> are<00:03:09.510> wanting<00:03:09.900> to<00:03:10.049> specifically

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
that if you are wanting to specifically

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.470 
that if you are wanting to specifically
rescue<00:03:11.100> the<00:03:11.190> people<00:03:11.340> it's<00:03:12.090> probably<00:03:12.299> better

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
rescue the people it's probably better

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.350 
rescue the people it's probably better
to<00:03:12.600> farm<00:03:13.380> a<00:03:13.470> little<00:03:13.650> bit<00:03:13.739> of<00:03:13.830> cash<00:03:14.040> to<00:03:14.370> to<00:03:14.880> save

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
to farm a little bit of cash to to save

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.710 
to farm a little bit of cash to to save
up<00:03:15.510> for<00:03:15.720> the<00:03:15.780> boots<00:03:15.959> first<00:03:17.120> it<00:03:18.120> makes<00:03:18.360> it<00:03:18.510> so

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
up for the boots first it makes it so

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.130 
up for the boots first it makes it so
much<00:03:18.870> easier<00:03:18.930> with<00:03:19.470> the<00:03:19.769> boost<00:03:20.310> in<00:03:20.640> play<00:03:21.150> but

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
much easier with the boost in play but

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.440 
much easier with the boost in play but
of<00:03:22.230> course<00:03:22.260> going<00:03:23.100> for<00:03:23.340> that<00:03:23.489> or<00:03:24.090> using<00:03:24.390> the

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
of course going for that or using the

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.390 
of course going for that or using the
boost<00:03:24.630> cost<00:03:24.900> a<00:03:25.019> lot<00:03:25.110> of<00:03:25.230> money<00:03:25.440> so<00:03:25.530> going<00:03:26.160> for

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
boost cost a lot of money so going for

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.850 
boost cost a lot of money so going for
the<00:03:26.489> money<00:03:26.670> takes<00:03:27.450> a<00:03:27.540> lot<00:03:27.660> of<00:03:27.690> time<00:03:27.860> and

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
the money takes a lot of time and

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.069 
the money takes a lot of time and
detract<00:03:29.640> from<00:03:29.790> what<00:03:30.180> you're<00:03:30.450> trying<00:03:30.750> to<00:03:30.959> do

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
detract from what you're trying to do

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:32.720 
detract from what you're trying to do
when<00:03:31.320> trying<00:03:31.620> to<00:03:31.709> accomplish<00:03:31.950> it<00:03:32.190> which<00:03:32.459> is<00:03:32.610> to

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
when trying to accomplish it which is to

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.150 
when trying to accomplish it which is to
rescue<00:03:32.880> everyone<00:03:33.239> so<00:03:33.959> 200<00:03:34.380> people<00:03:34.680> to<00:03:34.829> rescue

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
rescue everyone so 200 people to rescue

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.509 
rescue everyone so 200 people to rescue
in<00:03:35.340> two<00:03:35.579> minutes<00:03:36.709> collecting<00:03:37.709> clocks<00:03:38.010> extends

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
in two minutes collecting clocks extends

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:42.369 
in two minutes collecting clocks extends
that<00:03:38.610> time<00:03:38.880> makes<00:03:39.150> it<00:03:39.269> a<00:03:39.360> little<00:03:39.570> bit<00:03:39.780> easier

00:03:42.369 --> 00:03:42.379 

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:45.380 

so<00:03:43.379> now<00:03:43.500> it<00:03:43.650> does<00:03:44.040> tell<00:03:44.280> you<00:03:44.459> the<00:03:44.670> score<00:03:45.239> you

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
so now it does tell you the score you

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.119 
so now it does tell you the score you
need<00:03:45.599> to<00:03:45.900> beat<00:03:46.079> the<00:03:46.260> next<00:03:46.530> person<00:03:46.890> above<00:03:47.069> you

00:03:47.119 --> 00:03:47.129 
need to beat the next person above you

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:48.170 
need to beat the next person above you
and<00:03:47.250> then<00:03:47.549> on<00:03:47.700> the<00:03:47.790> leader<00:03:47.939> birds

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
and then on the leader birds

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.910 
and then on the leader birds
leaderboards<00:03:49.129> I<00:03:50.659> think<00:03:51.659> the<00:03:52.349> person<00:03:52.590> above<00:03:52.769> me

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
leaderboards I think the person above me

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.089 
leaderboards I think the person above me
has<00:03:53.280> something<00:03:53.609> like<00:03:54.379> 490<00:03:55.379> something

00:03:56.089 --> 00:03:56.099 
has something like 490 something

00:03:56.099 --> 00:04:01.390 
has something like 490 something
thousand<00:03:56.579> so<00:03:57.480> we're<00:03:57.599> trying<00:03:57.719> to<00:03:57.989> beat<00:03:58.170> that

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.940 

let's<00:04:02.400> try<00:04:02.609> to<00:04:02.670> get<00:04:02.849> these<00:04:03.030> cats<00:04:03.359> up<00:04:03.540> here

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 
let's try to get these cats up here

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.740 
let's try to get these cats up here
there<00:04:04.950> is<00:04:05.040> a<00:04:05.069> cat<00:04:05.310> inside<00:04:05.700> it<00:04:06.060> has<00:04:06.090> a<00:04:06.239> gold<00:04:06.510> star

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
there is a cat inside it has a gold star

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.679 
there is a cat inside it has a gold star
above<00:04:06.930> the<00:04:07.049> Fed<00:04:07.200> so<00:04:07.379> I<00:04:07.409> believe<00:04:07.650> that<00:04:08.250> some

00:04:08.679 --> 00:04:08.689 
above the Fed so I believe that some

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:12.140 
above the Fed so I believe that some
worth<00:04:09.689> more<00:04:10.200> but<00:04:10.500> I'm<00:04:10.620> again<00:04:11.370> I'm<00:04:11.489> not<00:04:11.519> exactly

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
worth more but I'm again I'm not exactly

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.319 
worth more but I'm again I'm not exactly
sure<00:04:12.590> seismic<00:04:13.590> activity<00:04:13.980> increased<00:04:14.370> I<00:04:14.730> think

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:15.329 
sure seismic activity increased I think

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:18.819 
sure seismic activity increased I think
that<00:04:15.480> means<00:04:15.720> the<00:04:15.959> little<00:04:16.639> explosive

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:18.829 
that means the little explosive

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:21.800 
that means the little explosive
eruptions<00:04:19.829> that<00:04:19.979> are<00:04:20.190> happening<00:04:20.720> happen<00:04:21.720> more

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
eruptions that are happening happen more

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:27.999 
eruptions that are happening happen more
frequently<00:04:23.960> you're<00:04:24.960> going<00:04:25.169> to<00:04:25.259> drop<00:04:25.410> yourself

00:04:27.999 --> 00:04:28.009 

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:32.080 

so<00:04:29.009> there's<00:04:29.220> a<00:04:29.430> an<00:04:30.150> armor<00:04:30.539> boost<00:04:30.870> in<00:04:31.259> here

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
so there's a an armor boost in here

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.589 
so there's a an armor boost in here
which<00:04:33.090> we<00:04:33.300> will<00:04:33.419> try<00:04:33.810> to<00:04:33.840> get<00:04:34.199> and<00:04:35.599> timbre

00:04:36.589 --> 00:04:36.599 
which we will try to get and timbre

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:40.159 
which we will try to get and timbre
bonus<00:04:37.380> in<00:04:37.620> there<00:04:37.830> an<00:04:38.070> extra<00:04:38.160> 10<00:04:38.520> seconds<00:04:39.169> so
