00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:15.330
 it was there that was 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:19.170
 chips cola chips cola was again as 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:23.039
 captain welcome here on our 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.279
 new map the short of the crate whole 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.680
 beautiful name 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:29.699
 that's exactly what you have hopefully 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.619
 again on minecraft 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.920
 seen midfield if not the videos 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.140
 let 's see before this continues 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:41.250
 and yes, sure I would have it anyway 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:43.280
 Once again, the idea was yes at the 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.300
 I messed around with news video and 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.559
 said yes because quite funny such a 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.590
 crate to have the one when you open it 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.960
 does that make then plop out items so 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.199
 is now here to put I open it 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.699
 the wars always pets the items and 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:58.469
 yes, I found the idea quite funny 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.090
 Nothing will come next year 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.829
 get out of the way, the run will come again 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.650
 what's out and that's what you can do 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.729
 keep going 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.470
 and if i put the lever back here 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.950
 pick it up and then happen again 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.780
 nothing so old now so participate 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.250
 exactly, and all I wanted here times 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.400
 explain that we fly best here 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.869
 also built clean because the behind 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.590
 we have to rebuild it a bit 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.409
 job here 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.659
 so that it goes up and yes 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.780
 we have the box that is a trap 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.880
 We need a signal from that 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.100
 signal from her is ripped off down here 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.869
 should also like what you can 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.729
 build a blog among the kister and 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.100
 then the last signal first rap jazz 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:42.030
 thing like that only a second now 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:44.610
 is very freaky and that goes here 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.560
 to that the tortoise year if the 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:50.040
 crate is so is the main watch 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.200
 blocked as soon as you had in short the 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.920
 church if you do it on the crate 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.930
 go the tortoise and then have the side 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.890
 with the hopper in between times and 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.610
 here and produced signal what here 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.219
 goes down 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.030
 also gropper and dropper has the spits 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.399
 rescue to the top 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.649
 since I flew out because of everything 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.349
 was open at the other knock 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.330
 pay up here then and exactly that 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:17.010
 lever up here if you follow it now 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.660
 It is otherwise up there to lie 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.520
 signal from the torch and thus 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.349
 block the thing so even the 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.720
 crate it still stops here 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:28.830
 a signal on it and the wheel does not have 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.690
 What then exactly the only the only 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.569
 Triviality that bothers me a bit 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.129
 that the staircase is a signal when you go 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:38.580
 She also gives up on this hobby 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:41.040
 and then takes no items so 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.810
 even who does not live it sometimes 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.690
 see that the box straight out 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.069
 spits the stuff out of the main office and 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.410
 only when you make the box then 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:56.459
 take care of it as it will become again 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:58.890
 now 56 to 164 x see aging as 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:01.349
 she is missing a few so now 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.480
 Crate points down if she has 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:05.959
 just walking because the guests had him 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:09.000
 give the victims their seven workers 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:11.129
 we almost got to the 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:18.239
 competition quite funny things here 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:19.590
 cool thing indeed so you have nothing to you 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:21.120
 really special but maybe too 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.010
 really fun for an adventure web or 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.989
 so you can use it or not 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.200
 I think it can actually be cool 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:30.629
 a hightech kitchen since the kittchen 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.340
 just such as practical aids 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:33.930
 we have cookies purely what 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:39.659
 probably forgotten or something 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:51.510
 because either 364 6 get it out 

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:53.069
 took ewigkeiten made just as he 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.450
 think of eating it is good because there 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:55.950
 you do not need that much you can do it 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.810
 take things out shortly and do 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.379
 has to go again or she pukes 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.379
 me on 

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:03.140
 and yes, that 's all in itself has you 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:06.810
 like a little gimmick here 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:09.150
 that does not really matter but cool 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:12.709
 his cool but is gray and up to the 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.709
 next time is next
