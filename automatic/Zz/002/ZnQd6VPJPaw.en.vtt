one of the 50 plus test calling you an

one of the 50 plus test calling you an
evil<00:03:22.389> e<00:03:22.690> 50<00:03:23.079> plus<00:03:23.350> and<00:03:23.620> easily<00:03:24.130> 20<00:03:24.340> feet<00:03:24.670> longer

evil e 50 plus and easily 20 feet longer
than<00:03:25.030> he<00:03:25.209> expected<00:03:25.359> go<00:03:25.870> watch<00:03:26.139> this<00:03:26.350> again

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
than he expected go watch this again

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:29.070 
than he expected go watch this again
super<00:03:27.579> slow<00:03:27.850> rotation

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080 
super slow rotation

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.540 
super slow rotation
he's<00:03:29.170> going<00:03:29.470> so<00:03:29.800> far<00:03:30.220> and<00:03:30.550> he<00:03:30.700> almost<00:03:31.120> had<00:03:31.900> it

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550 
he's going so far and he almost had it

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:35.010 
he's going so far and he almost had it
now<00:03:33.550> maybe<00:03:33.790> because<00:03:34.270> he<00:03:34.390> was<00:03:34.420> going<00:03:34.750> a<00:03:34.780> little

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:35.020 
now maybe because he was going a little

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:37.650 
now maybe because he was going a little
faster
