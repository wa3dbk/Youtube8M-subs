just<00:02:32.650> wide<00:02:33.639> and<00:02:33.909> really<00:02:34.029> shallow<00:02:34.329> and<00:02:34.599> we<00:02:34.719> like

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
just wide and really shallow and we like

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.110 
just wide and really shallow and we like
it<00:02:34.900> to<00:02:35.230> have<00:02:35.739> a<00:02:36.099> little<00:02:36.519> more<00:02:36.639> velocity

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
it to have a little more velocity

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.330 
it to have a little more velocity
and<00:02:37.360> then<00:02:37.510> have<00:02:37.690> some<00:02:37.989> deeper<00:02:38.860> holes<00:02:39.069> for

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
and then have some deeper holes for

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.660 
and then have some deeper holes for
trout<00:02:39.629> and<00:02:40.629> so<00:02:40.900> we're<00:02:41.080> kind<00:02:41.799> of<00:02:41.860> we're<00:02:42.610> gonna

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
trout and so we're kind of we're gonna

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.309 
trout and so we're kind of we're gonna
let<00:02:42.940> it<00:02:42.970> happen<00:02:43.239> naturally<00:02:43.540> we're<00:02:44.019> just<00:02:44.170> kind

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 
let it happen naturally we're just kind

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:45.899 
let it happen naturally we're just kind
of<00:02:44.349> help<00:02:44.650> helping<00:02:44.980> it<00:02:45.099> out<00:02:45.220> a<00:02:45.250> little<00:02:45.430> bit<00:02:45.670> on

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
movement in placement the log movement

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.259 
movement in placement the log movement
and<00:02:52.720> placement<00:02:53.200> is<00:02:53.379> to<00:02:54.129> try<00:02:54.340> to<00:02:54.400> break<00:02:54.909> up<00:02:55.090> some

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.269 
and placement is to try to break up some

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:57.509 
and placement is to try to break up some
of<00:02:55.390> these<00:02:55.450> areas<00:02:55.720> that<00:02:55.870> are<00:02:56.170> wide<00:02:56.829> and<00:02:56.860> flowing

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 
of these areas that are wide and flowing

00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:59.880 
of these areas that are wide and flowing
very<00:02:57.700> shallow<00:02:58.019> what<00:02:59.019> that<00:02:59.140> does<00:02:59.379> is<00:02:59.680> when<00:02:59.829> you

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
very shallow what that does is when you

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.920 
very shallow what that does is when you
have<00:03:00.069> a<00:03:00.099> shallow<00:03:00.400> wide<00:03:00.909> flowing<00:03:01.329> stream<00:03:01.690> that

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
have a shallow wide flowing stream that

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.539 
have a shallow wide flowing stream that
it<00:03:02.200> increases<00:03:02.860> the<00:03:03.040> temperature<00:03:03.220> of<00:03:03.489> the

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:03.549 
it increases the temperature of the

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:04.740 
it increases the temperature of the
water<00:03:03.730> quite<00:03:03.970> a<00:03:04.000> bit<00:03:04.209> especially<00:03:04.329> when

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
water quite a bit especially when

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.690 
water quite a bit especially when
there's<00:03:04.900> not<00:03:05.049> enough<00:03:05.379> shade<00:03:05.620> this<00:03:06.040> area<00:03:06.430> is<00:03:06.670> a

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
there's not enough shade this area is a

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.000 
there's not enough shade this area is a
native<00:03:07.209> area<00:03:07.540> for<00:03:07.780> Gila<00:03:07.989> trout<00:03:08.110> but<00:03:08.680> because

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
native area for Gila trout but because

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.589 
native area for Gila trout but because
of<00:03:09.190> the<00:03:09.250> groups<00:03:09.459> work<00:03:09.730> to<00:03:09.910> improve<00:03:10.180> the<00:03:10.390> water

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:10.599 
of the groups work to improve the water

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:13.800 
of the groups work to improve the water
quality<00:03:10.750> here<00:03:11.440> it<00:03:11.590> is<00:03:12.010> also<00:03:12.220> a<00:03:12.579> recovery<00:03:13.299> area

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810

for<00:03:14.170> Gila<00:03:14.379> trout<00:03:14.500> the<00:03:15.069> cool<00:03:15.280> thing<00:03:15.430> that's

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:15.549 
for Gila trout the cool thing that's

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:16.860 
for Gila trout the cool thing that's
going<00:03:15.819> on<00:03:15.910> out<00:03:16.090> here<00:03:16.299> right<00:03:16.480> now<00:03:16.510> actually

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
going on out here right now actually

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.319 
going on out here right now actually
with<00:03:17.230> the<00:03:17.349> Gila<00:03:17.590> trout<00:03:17.620> is<00:03:18.040> that<00:03:18.370> because<00:03:19.150> of

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:19.329 
with the Gila trout is that because of

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:21.330 
with the Gila trout is that because of
these<00:03:19.480> efforts<00:03:19.510> and<00:03:20.140> efforts<00:03:20.709> of<00:03:20.829> others<00:03:21.099> to

we've<00:03:23.620> actually<00:03:23.829> recovered<00:03:24.340> it<00:03:24.430> to<00:03:24.549> a<00:03:24.579> point

00:03:24.869 --> 00:03:24.879 
we've actually recovered it to a point

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:27.030 
we've actually recovered it to a point
where<00:03:25.180> we<00:03:25.390> can<00:03:25.510> allow<00:03:25.810> catch<00:03:26.769> and<00:03:26.950> release
