doing that I seem to be catching more

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:39.620 
doing that I seem to be catching more
short<00:05:37.590> bitch<00:05:37.860> than<00:05:38.160> anything<00:05:38.490> I'm<00:05:39.390> actually

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:39.630 
short bitch than anything I'm actually

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:41.150

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:46.590 
a little bit I think if a person tied on

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.290 
a little bit I think if a person tied on
a<00:05:46.620> spinnerbait<00:05:47.040> with<00:05:47.490> you<00:05:47.700> to<00:05:47.820> throw<00:05:48.060> it<00:05:48.090> in

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:48.300 
a spinnerbait with you to throw it in

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.930 
a spinnerbait with you to throw it in
the<00:05:48.390> seat<00:05:48.630> of<00:05:48.750> trees<00:05:48.990> or<00:05:49.229> on<00:05:49.380> the<00:05:49.530> bag<00:05:49.820> if<00:05:50.820> you

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:50.940 
the seat of trees or on the bag if you

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:53.030 
the seat of trees or on the bag if you
stay<00:05:51.180> with<00:05:51.390> it<00:05:51.570> long<00:05:51.720> enough<00:05:51.960> you're<00:05:52.830> going<00:05:52.919> to

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:53.040 
stay with it long enough you're going to

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.969 
stay with it long enough you're going to
catch<00:05:53.190> some<00:05:53.430> fish<00:05:53.640> it's<00:05:54.450> just<00:05:54.840> you<00:05:55.830> know<00:05:55.860> it's

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:57.750 
just really hard for me to pattern these

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:59.360
