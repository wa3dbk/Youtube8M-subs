00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.579
 the taste of the pumpkin well a 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.200

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.480
 He passed 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:45.220
 I do not like that 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.220
 you see the sea 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:53.010
 the pythons 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:58.309
 so it is not nor stop 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.309
 they ask for chewing gum for their person 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:05.690
 The first thing we are going to do is prepare 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:08.570
 the ingredients for it as always 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.909
 what we need is a table and a 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.240
 good knife let's prepare the 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:13.240
 onion 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.360
 or melt 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:30.930
 fifteen 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:30.930
 we have only 45 cuts for 3 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:45.439
 and her sex 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.439
 if I'm going to eat it 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:52.659
 add olive oil to the pot 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.710
 and we are putting it on the fire so that 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:58.140
 go making medium fire 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:02.570
 to dance 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.570
 in city bell 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.539
 now let's clean the pumpkin 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:11.489
 it's just removing the pipes 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:11.489
 remove the skin and chop 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.110
 ah 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.880
 I'm using this pumpkin because 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.410
 is the one they sell here in Chile but 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.670
 You can also use any other 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.500
 type of pumpkin that can be found 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:26.690
 in the market as for example these two 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.690
 this one and this one 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.260
 Is open 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.780
 I love you 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.939
 here we have to advance perfectly 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.379
 clean the cut into pieces a little bit 

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:40.379
 smaller so that they count well 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:48.040
 you must do 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.040
 I want to add love to dance 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:58.910
 we add the garlic also add the 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:01.390
 broth pill and add the pepper 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.390
 black 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.200
 and of course I do not forget the 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.200
 Salt 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.270
 stir well 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:20.510
 and we will leave it here just 5 minutes 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:22.940
 what it took for the server to warm up 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.230
 of water to pour boiling water through 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.520
 Of course nothing happens if you throw the 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.520
 cold water and the boil eagle 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:34.170
 while boiling water is chopped 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.170
 cheese 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.840
 and now it's when I've made water here 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.610
 Now, what is cooking? 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.530
 because we have to pour water so that 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:47.819
 be in expectation all covered but 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.819
 not completely covered 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.159
 so we see that it's pretty much everything 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.140
 full of water but not totally 

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:58.700
 covered is in the water bottom of the 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.780
 engineer 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.780
 we put to strong fire 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.680
 and we cover 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:12.099
 When it returns to boil, put on fire 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:14.549
 minimum and we'll leave it there about 20 25 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:14.549
 minutes 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.489
 I dont know 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.370
 two 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:26.639
 your past ten minutes this is the 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:29.689
 appearance that comes 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:29.689
 It is boiling 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:35.570
 we remove it 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:37.930
 the pumpkin is already splitting with the 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.930
 spoon 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:45.350
 yes 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:47.380
 We leave it another 15 minutes well has 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:49.690
 past 25 minutes 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:51.870
 is already cooked pumpkin let's see how 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:51.870
 is 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:57.630
 You see the pumpkin there 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:59.340
 the squeeze against the wall of the pot and 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:03.890
 undo that is my aunt who is already 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.890
 list let's proceed 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.370
 for payments 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:16.480
 opening 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:19.200
 I love you 

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.200

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.920
 note 

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:26.689
 I'm going to try it to see what the 

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:29.379
 Point of salt has 

00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:29.379
 Steps 

00:05:33.069 --> 00:05:41.260
 but dear ones 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:43.639
 and until good now we are going to add 

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:47.199
 a slice of hard bread 

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:47.199
 well we are going to add the cream 

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:55.639
 approximately 75 milliliters of cream 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:55.639
 a lot up 

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:06.380

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:07.880
 ok we have had to remove what is 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:10.190

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.630
 34 minutes that look good well fine 

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:13.490
 material or that we do not find what 

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:16.460
 It is better to have a little more oil 

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:20.560
 olive because I notice that it has low fat 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:20.560
 quality extra virgin olive oil 

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:29.350

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:31.180
 prepare the dish with a saucepan we are going to 

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:33.840

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:58.810
