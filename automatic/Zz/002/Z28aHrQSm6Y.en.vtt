00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:13.330
 we stayed in Guanajuato because 

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:15.490
 white tail deer was about to be 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:18.240
 extinguished but the authorities did 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:18.240
 something to avoid it 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.950
 the sierra de santa rosa in the state of 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.470
 Guanajuato is the home of the deer tail 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:27.180
 white however the poaching 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.060
 was about to end this 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.220
 species for that reason for two years the 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.080
 state ecology institute seeks 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.090
 regenerate the deer population to 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.100
 through a sanctuary where you can 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.370
 reproduce itself safely and in its 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.960
 natural habitat 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:47.930
 well the idea of the uma is this go a 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.899
 little bit to the deer population here in 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:53.269
 the sierra and with good weather already 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:56.239
 we have three females, a male 

00:00:53.269 --> 00:01:00.470
 the idea is this, see if you can 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:02.240
 achieve some new this one 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.280
 members of the family not like right now 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.260
 we have seen that the area is already four 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.270
 natural intended for deer is 5 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.700
 hectares which are completely 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.030
 protected for your safety the project 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:17.470
 seeks to increase the number of copies 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:20.920
 Well, the idea is to multiply 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:23.800
 in the eastern population and free them with the 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.660
 good time is the idea not to start 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.480
 release this especially the males 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:30.760
 because they are territorial in a way 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.770
 recent is a new litter of a male 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.810
 and a female that raise hopes 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.070
 that this species begins to populate 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.010
 that remains in the protected natural area 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.630
 of the sierra de santa rosa for 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.970
 continue with the reproduction is counted 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.770
 with a male and three females the people who 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.290
 come to this point you can look 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:50.160
 these species which are also 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.160
 on display 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:58.650
 we invite you to continue questioning the 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.650
 information with the following videos
