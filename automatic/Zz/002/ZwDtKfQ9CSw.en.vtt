00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
chemically enhanced that don't even

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.590 
chemically enhanced that don't even
sound<00:02:23.190> right<00:02:23.580> does<00:02:23.850> it<00:02:23.880> chemically<00:02:24.360> enhanced

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
sound right does it chemically enhanced

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.250

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
roots and they grow out that's pretty

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.440 
roots and they grow out that's pretty
much<00:02:39.690> what<00:02:40.050> the<00:02:40.230> chemical<00:02:40.730> relaxer<00:02:41.730> hair<00:02:42.150> does

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
much what the chemical relaxer hair does

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.900 
much what the chemical relaxer hair does
you<00:02:43.110> know<00:02:43.230> the<00:02:43.350> natural<00:02:44.069> hair<00:02:44.250> comes<00:02:44.489> out<00:02:44.670> in

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
you know the natural hair comes out in

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.790 
you know the natural hair comes out in
the<00:02:45.090> chemically<00:02:45.480> hair<00:02:45.810> chemical<00:02:46.530> leave

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
the chemically hair chemical leave

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.620 
the chemically hair chemical leave
chemical<00:02:47.989> enhanced<00:02:48.989> hair<00:02:50.300> goes<00:02:51.300> all<00:02:51.450> the<00:02:51.480> way

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
chemical enhanced hair goes all the way

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.949 
chemical enhanced hair goes all the way
down<00:02:51.660> until<00:02:51.959> you<00:02:52.140> cut<00:02:52.380> the<00:02:52.680> hair<00:02:52.860> off<00:02:52.890> so<00:02:53.959> yeah

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
you guys I think I'm going to keep this

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.910 
you guys I think I'm going to keep this
in<00:02:56.519> for<00:02:56.760> a<00:02:56.790> while<00:02:57.120> and<00:02:57.750> i'm<00:02:58.170> gonna<00:02:58.440> read<00:02:58.680> Sun

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
in for a while and i'm gonna read Sun

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.009 
in for a while and i'm gonna read Sun
probably<00:02:59.310> again<00:02:59.760> in<00:03:00.000> the<00:03:00.180> no<00:03:00.330> see<00:03:00.570> check<00:03:00.870> the

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
probably again in the no see check the

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:03.500 
probably again in the no see check the
lint<00:03:01.260> and<00:03:01.350> everything<00:03:01.860> and<00:03:02.220> I'll<00:03:02.760> see<00:03:03.060> if<00:03:03.120> I<00:03:03.300> go

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
lint and everything and I'll see if I go

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.380 
lint and everything and I'll see if I go
with<00:03:03.540> the<00:03:03.720> big<00:03:03.870> chop<00:03:04.080> then<00:03:04.700> but<00:03:05.700> if<00:03:05.820> not<00:03:06.060> I

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
with the big chop then but if not I

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.580 
with the big chop then but if not I
probably<00:03:06.660> get<00:03:06.959> them<00:03:07.050> done<00:03:07.200> again<00:03:07.940> so<00:03:09.560> yes<00:03:10.560> you

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
probably get them done again so yes you

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.740 
probably get them done again so yes you
