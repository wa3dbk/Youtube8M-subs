really made a big difference I'm not

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:18.690 
really made a big difference I'm not
sure<00:00:17.260> of<00:00:17.380> a<00:00:17.500> specific<00:00:18.040> incident<00:00:18.250> but<00:00:18.430> I<00:00:18.490> think

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:18.700 
sure of a specific incident but I think

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.999 
sure of a specific incident but I think
hopefully<00:00:19.390> just<00:00:19.599> a<00:00:20.080> certain<00:00:20.560> element<00:00:20.950> of

00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:21.009 
hopefully just a certain element of

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:22.589 
hopefully just a certain element of
calmness<00:00:21.460> I<00:00:21.640> think<00:00:21.849> when<00:00:22.060> it's<00:00:22.240> so<00:00:22.419> hectic

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:22.599

it's<00:00:41.739> pretty<00:00:41.800> natural<00:00:42.160> but<00:00:42.519> I<00:00:42.579> think<00:00:42.789> you<00:00:42.879> do

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.210 
it's pretty natural but I think you do

it's pretty natural but I think you do
you<00:00:43.480> do<00:00:43.629> learn<00:00:43.809> as<00:00:44.079> you<00:00:44.140> go<00:00:44.260> along<00:00:44.289> I<00:00:44.649> think<00:00:44.710> I

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.100 
you do learn as you go along I think I

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.709 
you do learn as you go along I think I
wouldn't<00:00:45.730> have<00:00:45.820> been<00:00:45.910> a<00:00:45.940> good<00:00:46.120> captain<00:00:46.510> when<00:00:46.660> I

00:00:46.709 --> 00:00:46.719 
wouldn't have been a good captain when I

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:49.020 
wouldn't have been a good captain when I
was<00:00:46.840> 18<00:00:47.140> or<00:00:47.289> 20<00:00:47.620> but<00:00:47.829> the<00:00:48.309> order<00:00:48.519> I've<00:00:48.609> got<00:00:48.850> the

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.030 
was 18 or 20 but the order I've got the

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.360 
was 18 or 20 but the order I've got the
more<00:00:49.210> I've<00:00:49.269> learnt<00:00:49.480> and<00:00:49.719> a<00:00:49.899> matured<00:00:50.440> I<00:00:50.739> think

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.370 
more I've learnt and a matured I think

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.910 
more I've learnt and a matured I think
it's<00:00:51.760> made<00:00:51.969> me<00:00:52.149> a<00:00:52.179> better<00:00:52.300> leader

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920
