00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:03.650 
today I will show you the performance of

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:08.900 
today I will show you the performance of
build<00:00:04.650> 10<00:00:05.779> Tim<00:00:06.779> Hudson<00:00:07.020> which<00:00:07.500> has<00:00:07.910> hardware

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
build 10 Tim Hudson which has hardware

build 10 Tim Hudson which has hardware
composition<00:00:09.540> and<00:00:10.500> not<00:00:11.219> relax<00:00:11.880> maybe<00:00:13.040> as

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
composition and not relax maybe as

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.609 
composition and not relax maybe as
previous<00:00:14.490> versions<00:00:14.969> because<00:00:15.870> of<00:00:16.230> that<00:00:16.379> hugger

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
previous versions because of that hugger

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:23.679 
previous versions because of that hugger
composition<00:00:17.369> as<00:00:18.300> you<00:00:18.480> can<00:00:18.630> see<00:00:18.810> it's<00:00:18.960> move<00:00:20.750> but

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:23.689 
composition as you can see it's move but

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:28.310 
composition as you can see it's move but
it<00:00:24.689> has<00:00:24.930> sample<00:00:25.350> books<00:00:25.880> still<00:00:27.320> something

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
it has sample books still something

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.980 
it has sample books still something
seemed<00:00:28.619> to<00:00:28.650> be<00:00:30.140> changed<00:00:31.140> that<00:00:31.380> some

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:33.990 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:38.330 

for<00:00:34.530> example<00:00:35.040> when<00:00:35.280> we<00:00:35.310> go<00:00:35.640> to<00:00:35.670> ceilings<00:00:37.280> go<00:00:38.280> to

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
for example when we go to ceilings go to

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.250 
for example when we go to ceilings go to
desktop<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:39.950> for<00:00:40.950> a<00:00:40.980> while<00:00:41.040> it<00:00:41.930> it<00:00:42.930> likes

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
desktop and for a while it it likes

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.850 
desktop and for a while it it likes
engagement<00:00:44.160> oh<00:00:45.890> and<00:00:46.890> for<00:00:47.250> those<00:00:47.720> in<00:00:48.720> this<00:00:48.930> very

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
engagement oh and for those in this very

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.160 
engagement oh and for those in this very
common<00:00:50.850> problem<00:00:52.310> and

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
common problem and

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.660 
common problem and
maybe<00:00:55.879> when<00:00:56.879> you<00:00:57.000> are<00:00:57.149> digits<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:58.260> things

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
maybe when you are digits the things

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:04.310 
maybe when you are digits the things
happens<00:01:00.109> it's<00:01:01.109> not<00:01:01.469> predictable<00:01:02.930> and<00:01:03.930> the

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
happens it's not predictable and the

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.910 
happens it's not predictable and the
other<00:01:04.530> thing<00:01:04.619> is<00:01:05.129> browser<00:01:05.519> I<00:01:06.080> don't<00:01:07.080> know<00:01:07.200> what

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:48.760 
problems nothing is in background

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.350 
problems nothing is in background
optimal

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
optimal

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.710 
optimal
and<00:01:53.159> but

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720

I don't know what happened but it dis
works<00:02:54.300> now<00:02:56.390> maybe<00:02:57.390> better<00:02:57.750> than

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:06.490 

instead<00:03:02.190> it's<00:03:02.430> it's<00:03:04.100> it's<00:03:05.100> worse<00:03:05.430> than

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
instead it's it's it's worse than

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:13.640 
instead it's it's it's worse than
inbuilt<00:03:07.500> language<00:03:08.540> which<00:03:09.540> was<00:03:09.750> very<00:03:12.650> very

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
inbuilt language which was very very

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:20.120 
inbuilt language which was very very
fast<00:03:14.070> at<00:03:14.430> this<00:03:14.790> point

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:23.420 

maybe<00:03:21.030> any<00:03:21.330> have<00:03:21.630> some

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
maybe any have some

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.110 
maybe any have some
too<00:03:23.969> much<00:03:24.150> from<00:03:24.390> free<00:03:25.549> and<00:03:26.549> the<00:03:26.790> battery

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
too much from free and the battery

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:33.440 
too much from free and the battery
performance<00:03:27.299> is<00:03:29.000> no<00:03:30.000> no<00:03:30.859> no<00:03:31.859> usage<00:03:32.450> freezing

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
performance is no no no usage freezing

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.940 
performance is no no no usage freezing
or<00:03:33.629> something

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.760 

um

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:41.770 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:45.330 

I

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.330 

divided<00:03:46.340> the<00:03:46.549> gallery<00:03:46.909> I'm<00:03:47.209> because<00:03:47.629> it

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
divided the gallery I'm because it

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:55.000 
divided the gallery I'm because it
drained<00:03:49.340> my<00:03:49.939> battery<00:03:51.010> so<00:03:52.010> let's<00:03:53.620> i'm<00:03:54.620> using

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
drained my battery so let's i'm using

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:01.119 
drained my battery so let's i'm using
creepy<00:03:55.549> know<00:03:56.560> which<00:03:57.560> is<00:03:57.709> a<00:03:57.739> good<00:03:58.629> but<00:04:00.040> when<00:04:01.040> you
