00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:15.180 

okay<00:00:13.270> here<00:00:13.660> we<00:00:13.809> have<00:00:14.110> I'm<00:00:14.440> gonna<00:00:14.559> put<00:00:14.799> into<00:00:14.950> the

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:15.190 
okay here we have I'm gonna put into the

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:17.340 
okay here we have I'm gonna put into the
one<00:00:15.520> who's<00:00:15.910> gonna<00:00:16.029> be<00:00:16.240> the<00:00:16.330> weakest<00:00:16.720> or<00:00:16.990> most

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:17.350 
one who's gonna be the weakest or most

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:19.710 
one who's gonna be the weakest or most
reactive<00:00:17.770> metal<00:00:18.040> in<00:00:18.220> not<00:00:18.910> even<00:00:19.119> an<00:00:19.210> acid<00:00:19.570> but

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:19.720 
reactive metal in not even an acid but

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.140 
reactive metal in not even an acid but
in<00:00:19.840> water<00:00:20.140> and<00:00:20.860> we'll<00:00:21.460> see<00:00:21.640> if<00:00:21.700> it<00:00:21.820> reacts

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:22.150 
in water and we'll see if it reacts

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:23.970 
in water and we'll see if it reacts
there<00:00:22.450> it's<00:00:22.630> definitely<00:00:22.960> reacting<00:00:23.770> and

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:23.980 
there it's definitely reacting and

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.210 
there it's definitely reacting and
that's<00:00:24.250> some<00:00:24.520> sodium<00:00:25.029> metal<00:00:25.360> and<00:00:25.770> so<00:00:26.770> because

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:27.220 
that's some sodium metal and so because

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:28.589 
that's some sodium metal and so because
if<00:00:27.340> you<00:00:27.460> can<00:00:27.640> think<00:00:27.820> if<00:00:27.970> you<00:00:28.060> think<00:00:28.270> of<00:00:28.360> this<00:00:28.450> as

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:28.599 
if you can think if you think of this as

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:31.260 
if you can think if you think of this as
a<00:00:28.630> contest<00:00:29.169> sodium<00:00:29.770> has<00:00:30.009> is<00:00:30.340> definitely<00:00:30.939> in

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:31.270 
a contest sodium has is definitely in

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:45.470 
a contest sodium has is definitely in
last<00:00:32.050> place<00:00:32.500> that<00:00:37.860> is<00:00:38.860> quite<00:00:39.100> spectacular

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.590 

now<00:00:46.480> that<00:00:46.840> sodium<00:00:47.710> is<00:00:47.980> down<00:00:48.280> and<00:00:48.700> out<00:00:49.150> of<00:00:49.420> the

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:49.600 
now that sodium is down and out of the

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.520 
now that sodium is down and out of the
competition

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:50.530 
competition

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.730 
competition
we're<00:00:50.740> on<00:00:50.800> to<00:00:51.100> zinc<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.870> this<00:00:53.020> time<00:00:53.260> I<00:00:53.500> put

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:53.740 
we're on to zinc and this time I put

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:57.000 
we're on to zinc and this time I put
some<00:00:53.920> zinc<00:00:54.250> in<00:00:54.460> water<00:00:55.650> which<00:00:56.650> is<00:00:56.770> the<00:00:56.860> same

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.010 
some zinc in water which is the same

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.310 
some zinc in water which is the same
thing<00:00:57.160> I<00:00:57.220> did<00:00:57.310> with<00:00:57.430> the<00:00:57.520> sodium<00:00:57.850> and<00:00:58.180> you<00:00:59.170> can

00:00:59.310 --> 00:00:59.320 
thing I did with the sodium and you can

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.319 
thing I did with the sodium and you can
see<00:00:59.530> some<00:00:59.770> bubbles<00:01:00.160> but<00:01:00.340> those<00:01:00.550> are<00:01:00.820> just

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:01.329 
see some bubbles but those are just

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:03.120 
see some bubbles but those are just
bubbles<00:01:01.930> from<00:01:02.140> the<00:01:02.260> very<00:01:02.440> beginning<00:01:02.560> when<00:01:03.100> I

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:03.130 
bubbles from the very beginning when I

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.490 
bubbles from the very beginning when I
when<00:01:03.520> I<00:01:03.550> dumped<00:01:04.000> it<00:01:04.089> in<00:01:04.269> they<00:01:04.750> don't<00:01:04.869> continue

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
when I dumped it in they don't continue

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.359 
when I dumped it in they don't continue
as<00:01:05.680> you<00:01:05.799> will<00:01:05.950> see<00:01:06.720> so<00:01:07.720> zinc<00:01:08.439> is<00:01:08.740> still<00:01:09.009> in<00:01:09.220> the

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:09.369 
as you will see so zinc is still in the

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:11.460 
as you will see so zinc is still in the
it's<00:01:09.970> still<00:01:10.210> in<00:01:10.329> the<00:01:10.420> competition<00:01:10.570> because<00:01:11.170> it

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470 
it's still in the competition because it

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.360 
it's still in the competition because it
will<00:01:11.619> not<00:01:11.829> react<00:01:12.189> with<00:01:12.310> water<00:01:12.930> and<00:01:14.250> just<00:01:15.250> to

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:15.370 
will not react with water and just to

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:17.460 
will not react with water and just to
show<00:01:15.550> you<00:01:15.610> this<00:01:15.820> this<00:01:16.180> is<00:01:16.360> a<00:01:16.390> clip<00:01:16.750> about<00:01:17.110> a

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:17.470 
show you this this is a clip about a

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.440 
show you this this is a clip about a
minute<00:01:17.950> later<00:01:18.070> the<00:01:18.250> bubbles<00:01:18.790> have<00:01:19.060> stopped

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
minute later the bubbles have stopped

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.090 
minute later the bubbles have stopped
zinc<00:01:22.450> still<00:01:22.750> in<00:01:23.050> the<00:01:23.170> competition<00:01:23.350> so<00:01:23.800> now

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
zinc still in the competition so now

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.710 
zinc still in the competition so now
we're<00:01:24.250> moving<00:01:24.370> on<00:01:24.640> to<00:01:24.670> our<00:01:24.880> weakest<00:01:25.450> acid

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720 
we're moving on to our weakest acid

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:26.820 
we're moving on to our weakest acid
which<00:01:25.990> is<00:01:26.020> actually<00:01:26.350> very<00:01:26.500> strong

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:26.830 
which is actually very strong

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:32.070 
which is actually very strong
hydrochloric<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.979> that<00:01:30.610> reacts<00:01:31.240> big-time

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
hydrochloric and that reacts big-time

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.649 
hydrochloric and that reacts big-time
zinc<00:01:33.070> reacts<00:01:33.400> with<00:01:33.549> hydrochloric<00:01:33.850> acid<00:01:34.510> and

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:34.659 
zinc reacts with hydrochloric acid and

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:37.760 
zinc reacts with hydrochloric acid and
so<00:01:35.170> is<00:01:35.409> out<00:01:35.740> of<00:01:35.799> the<00:01:36.130> competition

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
so is out of the competition

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.200 
so is out of the competition
now<00:01:38.770> that<00:01:39.010> zinc<00:01:39.220> is<00:01:39.310> out<00:01:39.460> of<00:01:39.580> the<00:01:39.640> competition

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
now that zinc is out of the competition

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.840 
now that zinc is out of the competition
we're<00:01:40.360> on<00:01:40.450> to<00:01:40.750> our<00:01:40.900> next<00:01:41.200> metal<00:01:41.830> copper<00:01:42.460> and

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
we're on to our next metal copper and

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.120 
we're on to our next metal copper and
this<00:01:43.240> is<00:01:43.420> some<00:01:43.600> copper<00:01:44.049> and<00:01:44.170> water<00:01:44.470> and<00:01:44.950> it

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
this is some copper and water and it

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.330 
this is some copper and water and it
clearly<00:01:45.340> does<00:01:45.580> not<00:01:45.610> react<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:47.770> so<00:01:48.100> now<00:01:48.220> we're

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
clearly does not react and so now we're

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:49.980 
clearly does not react and so now we're
gonna<00:01:48.430> move<00:01:48.640> on<00:01:48.820> to<00:01:49.000> copper<00:01:49.299> and<00:01:49.420> hydrochloric

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
gonna move on to copper and hydrochloric

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.539 
gonna move on to copper and hydrochloric
acid<00:01:51.659> okay<00:01:52.659> we're<00:01:53.020> now<00:01:53.170> going<00:01:53.229> to<00:01:53.710> put<00:01:53.950> copper

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:54.549 
acid okay we're now going to put copper

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:58.679 
acid okay we're now going to put copper
in<00:01:54.700> the<00:01:54.970> ass<00:01:55.299> of<00:01:55.330> the<00:01:55.689> did<00:01:55.930> in<00:01:56.110> some<00:01:57.010> zinc<00:01:57.850> and

00:01:58.679 --> 00:01:58.689 
in the ass of the did in some zinc and

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:03.440 
in the ass of the did in some zinc and
we'll<00:01:58.869> see<00:01:59.080> how<00:01:59.290> it<00:01:59.500> holds<00:01:59.740> up

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.170 

there<00:02:04.049> we<00:02:04.229> go<00:02:04.380> copper<00:02:05.070> and<00:02:05.100> hydrochloric<00:02:05.789> acid

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
there we go copper and hydrochloric acid

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.580 
there we go copper and hydrochloric acid
and<00:02:06.360> you<00:02:06.509> can<00:02:06.659> see<00:02:06.810> there's<00:02:06.990> a<00:02:07.049> little<00:02:07.439> bit<00:02:07.560> of

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
and you can see there's a little bit of

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.110 
and you can see there's a little bit of
color<00:02:07.860> change<00:02:08.099> at<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.310> beginning<00:02:09.349> but<00:02:11.120> that

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
color change at the beginning but that

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.540 
color change at the beginning but that
is<00:02:12.300> just<00:02:12.569> because<00:02:12.720> the<00:02:13.310> acid<00:02:14.310> is<00:02:14.400> reacting

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
is just because the acid is reacting

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.330 
is just because the acid is reacting
with<00:02:14.910> the<00:02:15.360> oxides<00:02:16.080> and<00:02:16.319> hydroxides<00:02:16.379> on<00:02:17.250> the

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
with the oxides and hydroxides on the

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.770 
with the oxides and hydroxides on the
outside<00:02:17.700> because<00:02:17.819> they<00:02:18.030> were<00:02:18.120> old<00:02:18.360> pieces<00:02:18.629> of

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
outside because they were old pieces of

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.320 
outside because they were old pieces of
iron<00:02:19.019> have<00:02:19.709> of<00:02:20.130> copper<00:02:20.550> excuse<00:02:21.000> me

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
iron have of copper excuse me

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.170 
iron have of copper excuse me
but<00:02:22.019> after<00:02:22.530> that<00:02:22.709> is<00:02:22.890> done<00:02:23.130> as<00:02:23.400> you<00:02:23.819> can<00:02:23.970> see

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
but after that is done as you can see

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.690 
but after that is done as you can see
there<00:02:24.660> is<00:02:24.840> no<00:02:25.140> more<00:02:25.500> reaction<00:02:26.069> whatsoever

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.520 

copper<00:02:29.700> withstood<00:02:30.090> hydrochloric<00:02:31.049> acid<00:02:31.380> so

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
copper withstood hydrochloric acid so

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.350 
copper withstood hydrochloric acid so
now<00:02:31.680> I'm<00:02:31.739> putting<00:02:31.950> it<00:02:32.130> in<00:02:32.220> nitric<00:02:32.580> acid<00:02:32.940> which

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
now I'm putting it in nitric acid which

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.509 
now I'm putting it in nitric acid which
is<00:02:33.390> an<00:02:33.750> even<00:02:33.870> more<00:02:33.989> corrosive<00:02:34.379> acid<00:02:34.890> and<00:02:35.129> as

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
is an even more corrosive acid and as

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:37.910 
is an even more corrosive acid and as
you<00:02:35.819> can<00:02:36.030> see<00:02:36.299> it<00:02:36.660> succumbs<00:02:37.290> to<00:02:37.410> the<00:02:37.590> nitric

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
you can see it succumbs to the nitric

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.339 
you can see it succumbs to the nitric
acid<00:02:38.040> it<00:02:38.519> is<00:02:39.420> reacting<00:02:39.959> and<00:02:40.200> it<00:02:40.380> is<00:02:40.500> forming

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:42.349 
acid it is reacting and it is forming

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:49.600 
acid it is reacting and it is forming
copper<00:02:43.349> nitrate<00:02:43.709> and<00:02:44.360> nitrogen<00:02:45.360> dioxide<00:02:45.390> gas

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.220 

quite<00:02:50.610> a<00:02:50.640> cool<00:02:50.940> reaction<00:02:51.510> and<00:02:51.660> the<00:02:51.930> end

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
quite a cool reaction and the end

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.789 
quite a cool reaction and the end
solution<00:02:52.920> is<00:02:53.069> a<00:02:53.099> Bluegreen<00:02:54.440> you<00:02:55.440> see<00:02:55.620> that

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
solution is a Bluegreen you see that

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:57.080 
solution is a Bluegreen you see that
little<00:02:55.980> piece<00:02:56.069> of<00:02:56.280> foil<00:02:56.640> there<00:02:56.880> that's

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
little piece of foil there that's

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.199 
little piece of foil there that's
actually<00:02:57.420> gold<00:02:57.630> foil<00:02:58.049> that<00:02:58.349> I<00:02:58.410> just<00:02:58.709> I<00:02:59.220> had<00:02:59.970> put

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
actually gold foil that I just I had put

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.449 
actually gold foil that I just I had put
the<00:03:00.299> gold<00:03:00.510> foil<00:03:00.750> in<00:03:00.930> there<00:03:01.110> before<00:03:01.260> and<00:03:01.829> I

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
the gold foil in there before and I

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.069 
the gold foil in there before and I
didn't<00:03:02.670> want<00:03:02.819> to<00:03:02.880> waste<00:03:03.000> nitric<00:03:03.420> acid<00:03:03.810> so<00:03:04.049> I

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:04.079 
didn't want to waste nitric acid so I

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:05.690 
didn't want to waste nitric acid so I
and<00:03:04.500> I<00:03:04.560> couldn't<00:03:04.829> take<00:03:04.950> it<00:03:05.099> out<00:03:05.220> so<00:03:05.489> I<00:03:05.549> just

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
and I couldn't take it out so I just

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.400 
and I couldn't take it out so I just
left<00:03:05.940> it<00:03:06.090> in<00:03:06.239> there<00:03:08.810> copper<00:03:09.810> has<00:03:09.900> succumbed<00:03:10.290> to

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
left it in there copper has succumbed to

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:11.990 
left it in there copper has succumbed to
the<00:03:10.590> nitric<00:03:10.889> acid<00:03:11.220> so<00:03:11.370> now<00:03:11.489> we're<00:03:11.670> on<00:03:11.790> to<00:03:11.819> the

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
the nitric acid so now we're on to the

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.180 
the nitric acid so now we're on to the
next<00:03:12.090> metal<00:03:12.930> gold<00:03:13.319> now<00:03:13.799> it's<00:03:13.950> pretty<00:03:14.100> obvious

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
next metal gold now it's pretty obvious

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.280 
next metal gold now it's pretty obvious
Gold<00:03:14.730> won't<00:03:15.000> react<00:03:15.269> with<00:03:15.450> water<00:03:15.660> but<00:03:15.959> just<00:03:16.200> to

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
Gold won't react with water but just to

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.170 
Gold won't react with water but just to
be<00:03:16.410> scientific<00:03:17.040> I<00:03:17.160> decided<00:03:17.489> to<00:03:17.639> put<00:03:17.790> some<00:03:17.970> gold

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
be scientific I decided to put some gold

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.759 
be scientific I decided to put some gold
foil<00:03:18.480> and<00:03:18.690> water<00:03:18.900> and<00:03:19.079> demonstrate<00:03:19.530> that<00:03:19.650> it

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
foil and water and demonstrate that it

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:21.620 
foil and water and demonstrate that it
doesn't<00:03:20.010> react<00:03:20.250> and<00:03:20.579> there<00:03:21.090> you<00:03:21.239> go<00:03:21.359> it's<00:03:21.540> at

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
doesn't react and there you go it's at

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.400 
doesn't react and there you go it's at
the<00:03:21.720> end<00:03:21.840> of<00:03:22.340> inoculating<00:03:23.340> wire<00:03:23.579> and<00:03:24.410> it

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
the end of inoculating wire and it

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.599 
the end of inoculating wire and it
doesn't<00:03:25.739> react<00:03:28.010> and<00:03:29.010> now<00:03:29.220> just<00:03:29.489> to<00:03:29.579> be

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.609 
doesn't react and now just to be

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:32.150 
doesn't react and now just to be
scientific<00:03:30.239> again<00:03:30.540> I've<00:03:30.840> got<00:03:31.230> some<00:03:31.590> gonna<00:03:31.889> put

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
scientific again I've got some gonna put

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.690 
scientific again I've got some gonna put
some<00:03:32.340> gold<00:03:32.579> foil<00:03:33.000> into<00:03:33.720> some<00:03:34.700> hydrochloric

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
some gold foil into some hydrochloric

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.099 
some gold foil into some hydrochloric
acid<00:03:38.030> kind<00:03:39.030> of<00:03:39.120> hard<00:03:39.269> to<00:03:39.389> see<00:03:39.600> but<00:03:39.810> there<00:03:39.989> is

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:40.109 
acid kind of hard to see but there is

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:44.420 
acid kind of hard to see but there is
some<00:03:40.319> gold<00:03:40.560> foil<00:03:40.950> in<00:03:41.190> there<00:03:43.280> floating<00:03:44.280> around

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
some gold foil in there floating around

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.300 
some gold foil in there floating around
it's<00:03:44.819> floating<00:03:45.000> on<00:03:45.209> the<00:03:45.359> surface

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
it's floating on the surface

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.599 
it's floating on the surface
there<00:03:47.310> we<00:03:47.489> go<00:03:47.639> I'm<00:03:47.819> zooming<00:03:48.209> in<00:03:49.370> oops<00:03:50.370> the

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:50.609 
there we go I'm zooming in oops the

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:52.370 
there we go I'm zooming in oops the
camera<00:03:50.970> didn't<00:03:51.239> focus<00:03:51.660> but<00:03:51.930> there<00:03:52.079> you<00:03:52.170> go<00:03:52.319> you

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
camera didn't focus but there you go you

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.270 
camera didn't focus but there you go you
see<00:03:52.470> cold<00:03:53.599> the<00:03:54.599> gold<00:03:54.840> did<00:03:55.019> not<00:03:55.170> succumb<00:03:55.650> to<00:03:55.680> the

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
see cold the gold did not succumb to the

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.860 
see cold the gold did not succumb to the
hydrochloric<00:03:56.819> acids<00:03:57.209> and<00:03:57.359> now<00:03:57.450> we're<00:03:57.569> trying

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
hydrochloric acids and now we're trying

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.559 
hydrochloric acids and now we're trying
the<00:03:58.200> next<00:03:58.560> strongest<00:03:59.010> acid<00:03:59.459> nitric<00:04:00.150> acid<00:04:00.510> and

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:00.569 
the next strongest acid nitric acid and

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:02.870 
the next strongest acid nitric acid and
there<00:04:00.750> you<00:04:00.810> go<00:04:00.959> you<00:04:01.019> say<00:04:01.440> exhumed<00:04:02.430> up<00:04:02.549> a<00:04:02.669> little

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
there you go you say exhumed up a little

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.729 
there you go you say exhumed up a little
there<00:04:03.090> is<00:04:03.180> some<00:04:03.359> gold<00:04:03.540> floating<00:04:04.019> in<00:04:04.349> nitric

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
there is some gold floating in nitric

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:07.699 
there is some gold floating in nitric
acid<00:04:05.160> and<00:04:05.780> as<00:04:06.780> you<00:04:06.989> can<00:04:07.139> see<00:04:07.200> there's

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
acid and as you can see there's

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:11.390 
acid and as you can see there's
absolutely<00:04:08.489> no<00:04:08.970> reaction<00:04:09.180> whatsoever<00:04:10.400> so

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
absolutely no reaction whatsoever so

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.890 
absolutely no reaction whatsoever so
we're<00:04:11.579> going<00:04:11.670> to<00:04:11.760> have<00:04:11.939> to<00:04:12.060> try<00:04:12.329> something<00:04:12.659> a

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
we're going to have to try something a

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.290 
we're going to have to try something a
little<00:04:13.140> bit<00:04:13.230> stronger

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:15.300 
little bit stronger

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.290 
little bit stronger
in<00:04:16.110> this<00:04:16.410> speaker<00:04:16.770> I<00:04:16.950> have<00:04:17.310> some<00:04:17.520> nitric<00:04:17.880> acid

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:18.300 
in this speaker I have some nitric acid

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 
because it can actually react with gold

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.940 
because it can actually react with gold
the<00:04:45.120> reason<00:04:45.480> it<00:04:45.600> can<00:04:45.750> react<00:04:46.020> with<00:04:46.110> gold<00:04:46.500> the

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:46.950 
the reason it can react with gold the

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:48.290 
the reason it can react with gold the
mixture<00:04:47.310> of<00:04:47.370> nitric<00:04:47.670> acid<00:04:47.940> and<00:04:47.970> hydrochloric

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
hydrochloric acid can react with it on

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.340 
hydrochloric acid can react with it on
their<00:04:53.340> own<00:04:53.550> I<00:04:53.910> will<00:04:54.240> discuss<00:04:54.810> in<00:04:54.990> the<00:04:55.110> gold

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:55.350 
their own I will discuss in the gold

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:59.150 
their own I will discuss in the gold
video<00:04:56.150> but<00:04:57.150> for<00:04:57.540> the<00:04:57.690> ruthenium<00:04:58.230> video<00:04:58.470> let<00:04:59.070> it

00:04:59.150 --> 00:04:59.160 
video but for the ruthenium video let it

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.120 
video but for the ruthenium video let it
just<00:04:59.280> be<00:04:59.370> said<00:04:59.730> that<00:05:00.150> even<00:05:00.570> gold<00:05:00.870> succumbs<00:05:01.710> to

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 
just be said that even gold succumbs to

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:05.030 
just be said that even gold succumbs to
the<00:05:02.820> combined<00:05:03.420> powers<00:05:03.930> of<00:05:04.140> nitric<00:05:04.500> acid<00:05:04.890> and

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:05.040 
the combined powers of nitric acid and

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:09.230 
the combined powers of nitric acid and
hydrochloric<00:05:05.760> acid<00:05:07.550> the<00:05:08.550> yellow<00:05:08.820> colored

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
hydrochloric acid the yellow colored

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.640 
hydrochloric acid the yellow colored

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:10.650 
part of the yellow color you see is

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:12.620 
part of the yellow color you see is
actually<00:05:10.860> from<00:05:11.430> some<00:05:11.880> of<00:05:11.970> the<00:05:12.060> decomposition

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:12.630 
actually from some of the decomposition

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.050 
actually from some of the decomposition
of<00:05:12.990> the<00:05:13.140> acid<00:05:13.530> when<00:05:13.680> they're<00:05:13.800> mixed<00:05:14.220> then<00:05:14.850> they

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.060 
of the acid when they're mixed then they

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.500 
of the acid when they're mixed then they
immediately<00:05:15.180> start<00:05:15.840> decomposing<00:05:17.120> however<00:05:18.120> in

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:18.510 
immediately start decomposing however in

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:20.720 
immediately start decomposing however in
a<00:05:18.660> little<00:05:18.960> bit<00:05:19.110> I'm<00:05:19.320> going<00:05:19.500> to<00:05:19.650> clip<00:05:19.950> cut<00:05:20.550> to

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:20.730 
a little bit I'm going to clip cut to

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:22.760 
a little bit I'm going to clip cut to
the<00:05:20.820> end<00:05:21.000> it<00:05:21.300> takes<00:05:21.480> about<00:05:21.720> five<00:05:22.230> minutes<00:05:22.500> for

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:22.770 
the end it takes about five minutes for

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.460 
the end it takes about five minutes for
the<00:05:22.890> gold<00:05:23.130> to<00:05:23.250> completely<00:05:23.700> react<00:05:24.120> a<00:05:24.450> lot<00:05:25.080> it'll

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:25.470 
the gold to completely react a lot it'll

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:27.740 
the gold to completely react a lot it'll
become<00:05:25.800> much<00:05:26.250> deeper<00:05:26.880> yellow<00:05:27.090> and<00:05:27.360> that'll<00:05:27.660> be

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:27.750 
become much deeper yellow and that'll be

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:30.920 
become much deeper yellow and that'll be
because<00:05:28.080> of<00:05:28.170> dissolved<00:05:28.590> gold<00:05:29.630> okay<00:05:30.630> I<00:05:30.660> close

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:30.930 
because of dissolved gold okay I close

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:32.630 
because of dissolved gold okay I close
the<00:05:31.080> garage<00:05:31.380> door<00:05:31.770> so<00:05:31.800> you<00:05:32.160> can<00:05:32.220> see<00:05:32.490> this

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:32.640 
the garage door so you can see this

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.910 
the garage door so you can see this
better<00:05:32.850> and<00:05:33.210> there's<00:05:33.810> just<00:05:34.140> a<00:05:34.260> little<00:05:34.560> tiny

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:34.920 
better and there's just a little tiny

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:37.160 
better and there's just a little tiny
bit<00:05:35.100> of<00:05:35.220> gold<00:05:35.400> left<00:05:35.790> there's<00:05:36.120> all<00:05:36.360> it's<00:05:36.780> almost

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:37.170 
bit of gold left there's all it's almost

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:41.270 
bit of gold left there's all it's almost
all<00:05:37.440> dissolved<00:05:38.270> and<00:05:39.270> I'm<00:05:39.840> going<00:05:40.140> to<00:05:40.590> skip<00:05:41.250> to

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:41.280 
all dissolved and I'm going to skip to

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.310 
all dissolved and I'm going to skip to
the<00:05:41.430> end<00:05:41.520> this<00:05:41.910> entire<00:05:42.330> process<00:05:42.630> took<00:05:43.170> about

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:43.320 
the end this entire process took about

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.280 
the end this entire process took about
five<00:05:43.800> minutes<00:05:44.100> and<00:05:44.550> you<00:05:45.510> can<00:05:45.660> see<00:05:45.810> the<00:05:45.990> deep

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:46.290 
five minutes and you can see the deep

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:48.230 
five minutes and you can see the deep
yellow<00:05:46.650> color<00:05:47.040> of<00:05:47.220> the<00:05:47.340> solution<00:05:47.820> is<00:05:47.940> because

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:48.240 
yellow color of the solution is because

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:53.330 
yellow color of the solution is because
of<00:05:48.360> dissolved<00:05:48.810> gold<00:05:50.810> okay<00:05:51.810> now<00:05:52.380> all<00:05:52.830> the<00:05:53.100> gold

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:53.340 
of dissolved gold okay now all the gold

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:55.490 
of dissolved gold okay now all the gold
has<00:05:53.700> been<00:05:53.730> reacting<00:05:54.360> on<00:05:54.480> a<00:05:54.540> trace<00:05:54.840> it<00:05:55.020> remains

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:55.500 
has been reacting on a trace it remains

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.830 
has been reacting on a trace it remains
and<00:05:55.860> this<00:05:56.010> is<00:05:56.160> now<00:05:56.310> a<00:05:56.340> solution<00:05:56.760> of<00:05:57.210> chloral

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:57.840 
and this is now a solution of chloral

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.710 
and this is now a solution of chloral
auric<00:05:58.230> acid<00:05:58.800> and<00:05:59.070> of<00:05:59.970> course<00:06:00.180> some<00:06:00.419> nitric

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:00.720 
auric acid and of course some nitric

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.210 
auric acid and of course some nitric
acid<00:06:01.050> and<00:06:01.169> hydrochloric<00:06:01.410> acid<00:06:02.070> that's

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:02.220 
acid and hydrochloric acid that's

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:05.060 
acid and hydrochloric acid that's
unreacted<00:06:03.150> now<00:06:04.080> that<00:06:04.290> the<00:06:04.380> gold<00:06:04.590> has<00:06:04.680> to<00:06:04.860> come

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:05.070 
unreacted now that the gold has to come

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:08.920 
unreacted now that the gold has to come
to<00:06:05.310> the<00:06:05.460> Aqua<00:06:06.330> gia<00:06:06.720> or<00:06:07.350> on<00:06:07.620> to<00:06:07.890> ruthenium<00:06:08.490> and

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:08.930 
to the Aqua gia or on to ruthenium and

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:11.390 
to the Aqua gia or on to ruthenium and
just<00:06:09.930> to<00:06:10.020> be<00:06:10.140> scientific<00:06:10.680> I<00:06:10.770> decided<00:06:11.100> to<00:06:11.220> put

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:11.400 
just to be scientific I decided to put

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.460 
just to be scientific I decided to put
ruthenium<00:06:11.940> in<00:06:12.060> water<00:06:12.300> and<00:06:12.600> there<00:06:13.169> you<00:06:13.260> see

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:13.470 
ruthenium in water and there you see

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:17.930 
ruthenium in water and there you see
it's<00:06:13.860> not<00:06:14.070> reacting<00:06:16.130> okay<00:06:17.130> now<00:06:17.340> this<00:06:17.550> is<00:06:17.610> some

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:17.940 
it's not reacting okay now this is some

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:21.110 
it's not reacting okay now this is some
concentrated<00:06:18.540> hydrochloric<00:06:18.840> acid<00:06:19.560> and<00:06:20.120> there

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.120 
concentrated hydrochloric acid and there

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:24.050 
concentrated hydrochloric acid and there
is<00:06:21.300> the<00:06:21.480> ruthenium<00:06:22.080> and<00:06:22.550> this<00:06:23.550> is<00:06:23.700> probably

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:24.060 
is the ruthenium and this is probably

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:26.300 
is the ruthenium and this is probably
pretty<00:06:24.360> obvious<00:06:24.450> but<00:06:25.050> it's<00:06:25.350> not<00:06:25.590> reacting<00:06:26.160> on

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:26.310 
pretty obvious but it's not reacting on

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:28.760 
pretty obvious but it's not reacting on
to<00:06:27.060> nitric<00:06:27.419> acid

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:28.770 
to nitric acid

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:31.249 
to nitric acid
okay<00:06:29.759> here's<00:06:30.030> some<00:06:30.270> nitric<00:06:30.539> acid<00:06:30.930> and<00:06:31.110> there's

00:06:31.249 --> 00:06:31.259 
okay here's some nitric acid and there's

00:06:31.259 --> 00:06:37.909 
okay here's some nitric acid and there's
the<00:06:31.470> ruthenium<00:06:32.009> metal<00:06:32.310> and<00:06:36.650> it's<00:06:37.650> not

00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:37.919 
the ruthenium metal and it's not

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:43.309 
the ruthenium metal and it's not
reacting<00:06:40.880> okay<00:06:41.880> this<00:06:42.210> is<00:06:42.449> nitric<00:06:42.900> acid<00:06:43.259> and

00:06:43.309 --> 00:06:43.319 
reacting okay this is nitric acid and

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:45.110 
reacting okay this is nitric acid and
about<00:06:43.560> to<00:06:43.710> add<00:06:43.830> some<00:06:44.009> hydrochloric<00:06:44.580> acid<00:06:44.970> and

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:45.120 
about to add some hydrochloric acid and

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.719 
about to add some hydrochloric acid and
then<00:06:45.240> the<00:06:45.449> resulting<00:06:45.870> acid<00:06:46.259> will<00:06:46.710> be<00:06:46.919> king<00:06:47.639> of

00:06:47.719 --> 00:06:47.729 
then the resulting acid will be king of

00:06:47.729 --> 00:06:51.140 
then the resulting acid will be king of
the<00:06:47.849> acids<00:06:48.300> aqua<00:06:48.990> regia<00:06:49.250> that<00:06:50.250> dissolved<00:06:50.940> gold

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:51.150 
the acids aqua regia that dissolved gold

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:53.480 
the acids aqua regia that dissolved gold
let's<00:06:51.630> see<00:06:51.780> if<00:06:51.870> it<00:06:51.990> can<00:06:52.169> dissolve<00:06:52.530> or<00:06:53.009> react

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:53.490 
let's see if it can dissolve or react

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:58.159 
let's see if it can dissolve or react
with<00:06:53.729> rather<00:06:54.500> ruthenium<00:06:56.509> so<00:06:57.509> I'm<00:06:57.630> gonna<00:06:57.810> wait

00:06:58.159 --> 00:06:58.169 
with rather ruthenium so I'm gonna wait

00:06:58.169 --> 00:07:01.100 
with rather ruthenium so I'm gonna wait
a<00:06:58.199> little<00:06:58.319> bit<00:06:58.680> of<00:06:58.830> time<00:06:59.099> just<00:06:59.130> to<00:06:59.720> make<00:07:00.720> sure

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:01.110 
a little bit of time just to make sure

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:05.980 
a little bit of time just to make sure
that<00:07:01.440> the<00:07:01.590> ruthenium<00:07:02.069> is<00:07:02.220> not<00:07:02.430> reacting<00:07:03.030> and

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:05.990 
that the ruthenium is not reacting and

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:11.210 
that the ruthenium is not reacting and
yeah<00:07:06.990> the<00:07:07.199> ruthenium<00:07:07.680> is<00:07:07.770> not<00:07:07.949> reacting<00:07:10.220> I'd

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:11.220 
yeah the ruthenium is not reacting I'd

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:14.600 
yeah the ruthenium is not reacting I'd
seen<00:07:11.669> nerd<00:07:12.090> graders<00:07:12.509> video<00:07:12.810> with<00:07:13.610> ruthenium

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:14.610 
seen nerd graders video with ruthenium

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:18.219 
seen nerd graders video with ruthenium
and<00:07:14.849> he<00:07:15.810> had<00:07:16.349> apparently<00:07:16.919> shown<00:07:17.669> that

00:07:18.219 --> 00:07:18.229 
and he had apparently shown that

00:07:18.229 --> 00:07:21.529 
and he had apparently shown that
ruthenium<00:07:19.229> has<00:07:19.909> kind<00:07:20.909> of<00:07:20.970> an<00:07:21.090> Achilles<00:07:21.509> heel

00:07:21.529 --> 00:07:21.539 
ruthenium has kind of an Achilles heel

00:07:21.539 --> 00:07:23.779 
ruthenium has kind of an Achilles heel
when<00:07:22.139> you<00:07:22.229> put<00:07:22.470> it<00:07:22.560> in<00:07:22.650> bleach<00:07:23.039> it<00:07:23.340> actually

00:07:23.779 --> 00:07:23.789 
when you put it in bleach it actually

00:07:23.789 --> 00:07:26.719 
when you put it in bleach it actually
starts<00:07:24.090> to<00:07:24.150> react<00:07:24.509> I<00:07:24.840> tried<00:07:25.710> this<00:07:25.949> and<00:07:26.009> this<00:07:26.580> is

00:07:26.719 --> 00:07:26.729 
starts to react I tried this and this is

00:07:26.729 --> 00:07:30.320 
starts to react I tried this and this is
a<00:07:26.759> shot<00:07:27.120> of<00:07:27.330> the<00:07:28.050> ruthenium<00:07:28.620> in<00:07:28.919> bleach<00:07:29.220> but<00:07:29.970> as

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:30.330 
a shot of the ruthenium in bleach but as

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:32.180 
a shot of the ruthenium in bleach but as
you<00:07:30.479> can<00:07:30.630> see<00:07:30.840> it<00:07:30.960> didn't<00:07:31.199> react<00:07:31.500> at<00:07:31.650> all<00:07:31.770> I'm

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:32.190 
you can see it didn't react at all I'm

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:34.550 
you can see it didn't react at all I'm
not<00:07:32.610> sure<00:07:32.849> what<00:07:33.090> I<00:07:33.120> did<00:07:33.180> wrong<00:07:33.570> if<00:07:33.840> I<00:07:33.990> didn't<00:07:34.259> if

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:34.560 
not sure what I did wrong if I didn't if

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:37.219 
not sure what I did wrong if I didn't if
I<00:07:35.120> didn't<00:07:36.120> wait<00:07:36.300> long<00:07:36.330> enough<00:07:36.599> though<00:07:37.199> I

00:07:37.219 --> 00:07:37.229 
I didn't wait long enough though I

00:07:37.229 --> 00:07:39.890 
I didn't wait long enough though I
waited<00:07:37.620> quite<00:07:37.860> a<00:07:37.889> bit<00:07:38.099> of<00:07:38.190> time<00:07:38.460> or<00:07:38.789> what<00:07:39.750> was

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:39.900 
waited quite a bit of time or what was

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:41.749 
waited quite a bit of time or what was
wrong<00:07:40.110> but<00:07:40.380> this<00:07:40.530> just<00:07:40.949> goes<00:07:41.159> to<00:07:41.310> show<00:07:41.520> that

00:07:41.749 --> 00:07:41.759 
wrong but this just goes to show that

00:07:41.759 --> 00:07:46.370 
wrong but this just goes to show that
science<00:07:42.690> is<00:07:42.990> sometimes<00:07:43.560> unexpected
