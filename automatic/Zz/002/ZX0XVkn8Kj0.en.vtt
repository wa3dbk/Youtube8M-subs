00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.080 
gone through there four times okay then
I<00:02:59.019> should<00:02:59.200> be<00:02:59.230> enough<00:02:59.470> and<00:02:59.709> then<00:03:00.430> just<00:03:00.700> go<00:03:00.879> over

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
I should be enough and then just go over

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.350 
I should be enough and then just go over
to<00:03:01.239> the<00:03:01.420> next<00:03:01.690> one<00:03:02.049> pick<00:03:02.830> up<00:03:02.950> a<00:03:03.040> three<00:03:03.280> a<00:03:03.640> few

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
to the next one pick up a three a few

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.020 
to the next one pick up a three a few
strands<00:03:04.780> of<00:03:04.930> thread<00:03:05.340> through<00:03:06.340> the<00:03:06.549> hole<00:03:06.580> there

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
strands of thread through the hole there

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:14.360 
strands of thread through the hole there
and<00:03:08.220> think<00:03:09.220> it<00:03:09.340> through<00:03:11.610> again<00:03:12.610> the<00:03:13.269> most<00:03:13.420> runs

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
and think it through again the most runs

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:21.200 
and think it through again the most runs
through<00:03:15.370> the<00:03:15.549> way

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:21.210 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:24.530 

three

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:30.309 

and<00:03:24.659> for<00:03:25.170> more

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:30.319 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:34.030 

there<00:03:30.890> we<00:03:31.069> go<00:03:31.840> I'm<00:03:32.840> just<00:03:33.049> going<00:03:33.230> to<00:03:33.439> finish

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
there we go I'm just going to finish

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.750 
there we go I'm just going to finish
this<00:03:34.250> off<00:03:34.489> so<00:03:34.849> I'll<00:03:35.180> just<00:03:35.450> do<00:03:35.810> one<00:03:36.079> more<00:03:36.260> loop

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
this off so I'll just do one more loop

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.539 
this off so I'll just do one more loop
one<00:03:37.760> more<00:03:37.939> little<00:03:38.060> stitch<00:03:38.590> through<00:03:39.590> there<00:03:39.829> I'm

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:40.549 
one more little stitch through there I'm

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:42.369 
one more little stitch through there I'm
going<00:03:40.760> to<00:03:40.849> pass<00:03:41.209> it<00:03:41.390> through<00:03:41.420> the<00:03:41.870> loop<00:03:41.900> in

00:03:42.369 --> 00:03:42.379 
going to pass it through the loop in

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:45.250 
going to pass it through the loop in
order<00:03:42.500> to<00:03:42.680> tighten<00:03:43.609> it<00:03:43.939> I've<00:03:44.870> got<00:03:45.049> a<00:03:45.079> knot

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
order to tighten it I've got a knot

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:53.009 
order to tighten it I've got a knot
there<00:03:46.390> create<00:03:48.280> another<00:03:49.280> hoods<00:03:50.470> loop<00:03:51.470> there

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019 
there create another hoods loop there

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:58.059 
there create another hoods loop there
through<00:03:54.730> my<00:03:55.730> forming<00:03:56.030> position<00:03:56.739> right<00:03:57.739> and

00:03:58.059 --> 00:03:58.069 
through my forming position right and

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:03.789 
through my forming position right and
there<00:03:58.310> we<00:03:58.400> go<00:03:58.810> those<00:03:59.810> now<00:04:01.629> red<00:04:02.629> and<00:04:02.989> just<00:04:03.530> get

00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:03.799 
there we go those now red and just get

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:07.240 
there we go those now red and just get
that<00:04:04.040> it's<00:04:04.730> have<00:04:04.909> a<00:04:04.939> nice<00:04:05.810> position<00:04:06.099> and<00:04:07.099> there

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
that it's have a nice position and there

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.990 
that it's have a nice position and there
we<00:04:07.340> have<00:04:07.489> it<00:04:08.379> okay<00:04:09.379> and<00:04:09.919> I'll<00:04:10.099> just<00:04:10.340> show<00:04:10.939> you

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
we have it okay and I'll just show you

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.940 
we have it okay and I'll just show you
on<00:04:11.450> the<00:04:11.780> hook<00:04:12.129> how<00:04:13.129> to<00:04:13.189> get<00:04:13.430> that<00:04:13.579> started

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:14.950 
on the hook how to get that started

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.449 
on the hook how to get that started
dude<00:04:15.950> Bend<00:04:16.160> me<00:04:16.370> while<00:04:16.519> I'm<00:04:16.699> list<00:04:17.090> it<00:04:17.299> up<00:04:17.419> shot

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
dude Bend me while I'm list it up shot

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.219 
dude Bend me while I'm list it up shot
all<00:04:19.459> right<00:04:19.609> I'm<00:04:19.880> putting<00:04:20.060> lot<00:04:20.389> double<00:04:20.989> thread

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:21.229 
all right I'm putting lot double thread

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:27.240 
all right I'm putting lot double thread
knot<00:04:22.009> in<00:04:22.190> the<00:04:22.310> end

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:29.760 

right<00:04:27.880> there<00:04:28.240> we<00:04:28.330> go<00:04:28.480> so<00:04:28.960> remember<00:04:29.380> to<00:04:29.560> keep

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
right there we go so remember to keep

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.120 
right there we go so remember to keep
hold<00:04:30.070> of<00:04:30.220> the<00:04:30.760> thread<00:04:31.690> underneath<00:04:32.050> so<00:04:33.040> it

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
hold of the thread underneath so it

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:38.400 
hold of the thread underneath so it
helps<00:04:33.460> to<00:04:33.550> anchor<00:04:36.330> it<00:04:37.330> into<00:04:37.510> position<00:04:38.020> come

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.410 
helps to anchor it into position come

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:50.340 
helps to anchor it into position come
with<00:04:38.500> warm<00:04:38.680> on<00:04:38.770> top<00:04:39.510> get<00:04:40.510> a<00:04:40.540> few<00:04:40.750> strands

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:50.350 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:54.610 

and<00:04:51.350> again<00:04:52.690> and<00:04:53.690> you<00:04:53.810> just<00:04:53.990> keep<00:04:54.200> doing<00:04:54.410> the

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:54.620 
and again and you just keep doing the

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.730 
and again and you just keep doing the
same<00:04:55.300> procedure<00:04:56.300> as<00:04:56.750> you<00:04:56.840> did<00:04:57.020> with<00:04:57.260> the<00:04:57.470> I

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:57.740 
same procedure as you did with the I

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.660 
same procedure as you did with the I
just<00:04:58.520> keep<00:04:58.730> going<00:04:59.060> around<00:05:00.070> I'm<00:05:01.070> gonna<00:05:01.190> just<00:05:01.400> do

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:01.670 
just keep going around I'm gonna just do

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:03.640 
just keep going around I'm gonna just do
this<00:05:01.850> quickly<00:05:02.180> so<00:05:02.630> that<00:05:02.660> now<00:05:03.170> you've<00:05:03.380> got<00:05:03.620> a

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650 
this quickly so that now you've got a

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:09.810 
this quickly so that now you've got a
good<00:05:03.950> idea<00:05:04.100> of<00:05:04.370> how<00:05:05.830> it<00:05:06.830> is<00:05:06.950> done<00:05:08.110> I'll<00:05:09.110> just<00:05:09.350> do

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:09.820 
good idea of how it is done I'll just do

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.320 
good idea of how it is done I'll just do
tubing<00:05:10.820> this<00:05:10.910> one

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.330 
tubing this one

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.760 
tubing this one
what<00:05:11.780> do<00:05:12.110> about<00:05:12.350> four<00:05:12.620> in<00:05:12.800> each<00:05:12.950> in<00:05:13.910> each<00:05:14.060> loop

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:14.770 
what do about four in each in each loop

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:23.350 
what do about four in each in each loop
or<00:05:15.770> hole<00:05:21.310> there<00:05:22.310> we<00:05:22.400> go<00:05:22.580> now<00:05:23.030> what<00:05:23.150> I'm<00:05:23.270> going

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 
or hole there we go now what I'm going

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.300 
or hole there we go now what I'm going
to<00:05:23.419> do<00:05:23.600> I'm<00:05:23.780> just<00:05:23.810> gonna<00:05:24.050> put<00:05:24.860> a<00:05:24.890> couple<00:05:25.280> of

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:25.310 
to do I'm just gonna put a couple of

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:27.670 
to do I'm just gonna put a couple of
touch<00:05:25.580> across<00:05:26.030> the<00:05:26.360> bar<00:05:26.540> here<00:05:26.900> just<00:05:27.470> to<00:05:27.560> keep

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:27.680 
touch across the bar here just to keep

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.620 
touch across the bar here just to keep
that<00:05:27.830> in<00:05:27.890> place<00:05:28.250> so<00:05:28.760> when<00:05:28.910> you've<00:05:29.030> completed

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:29.630 
that in place so when you've completed

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:31.810 
that in place so when you've completed
doing<00:05:30.110> all<00:05:30.260> the<00:05:30.380> stitching<00:05:30.770> through<00:05:31.580> each

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:31.820 
doing all the stitching through each

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:37.840 
doing all the stitching through each
hole<00:05:32.919> then<00:05:33.919> just<00:05:34.370> to<00:05:35.150> keep<00:05:35.740> going<00:05:36.740> to<00:05:36.919> place<00:05:37.160> go

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:37.850 
hole then just to keep going to place go

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:40.390 
hole then just to keep going to place go
behind<00:05:38.180> this<00:05:38.360> ditch<00:05:38.600> behind<00:05:39.440> it<00:05:39.710> bring<00:05:40.220> it

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:40.400 
behind this ditch behind it bring it

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.140 
behind this ditch behind it bring it
through<00:05:41.140> and<00:05:42.140> make<00:05:42.290> sure<00:05:42.320> this<00:05:42.650> road<00:05:42.830> goes

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:43.150 
through and make sure this road goes

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:51.370 
through and make sure this road goes
under<00:05:46.660> and<00:05:49.150> under<00:05:50.150> one<00:05:50.690> more<00:05:50.870> I<00:05:50.900> think<00:05:50.990> should

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:51.380 
under and under one more I think should

00:05:51.380 --> 00:06:03.960 
under and under one more I think should
do<00:05:51.530> it<00:05:51.680> just<00:05:53.830> to<00:05:54.830> keep<00:05:54.979> that<00:05:55.130> in<00:05:55.310> place

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:03.970 

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:08.710 

there<00:06:04.970> we<00:06:05.120> go<00:06:05.920> I'm<00:06:06.920> going<00:06:07.010> to<00:06:07.310> just<00:06:07.490> pull<00:06:07.720> or

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:08.720 
there we go I'm going to just pull or

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.690 
there we go I'm going to just pull or
not<00:06:08.870> enough<00:06:09.200> so<00:06:09.800> create<00:06:10.100> a<00:06:10.130> loop

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:10.700 
not enough so create a loop

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:19.040 
not enough so create a loop
I<00:06:12.160> think<00:06:13.160> it

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:19.050 

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:27.770 

yeah<00:06:19.650> there<00:06:19.889> we<00:06:19.979> go<00:06:20.780> no<00:06:23.930> kit<00:06:26.479> so<00:06:27.479> let<00:06:27.629> me<00:06:27.720> wrap

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:27.780
