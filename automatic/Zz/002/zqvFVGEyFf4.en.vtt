way and then to go the other way you hit
this<00:03:17.189> blue<00:03:17.489> button<00:03:17.639> it<00:03:17.970> goes<00:03:18.090> the<00:03:18.209> other<00:03:18.359> way

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
this blue button it goes the other way

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.189 
this blue button it goes the other way
it<00:03:19.319> goes<00:03:19.500> higher<00:03:20.000> so<00:03:21.000> to<00:03:21.090> go<00:03:21.209> lower<00:03:21.449> gear<00:03:21.900> if

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:22.199 
it goes higher so to go lower gear if

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:24.259 
it goes higher so to go lower gear if
you<00:03:22.349> started<00:03:22.680> 7<00:03:23.129> to<00:03:23.220> go<00:03:23.310> to<00:03:23.370> 6<00:03:23.729> you<00:03:23.879> move<00:03:24.060> this

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
you started 7 to go to 6 you move this

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.990 
you started 7 to go to 6 you move this
with<00:03:25.229> the<00:03:25.349> thumb<00:03:25.590> to<00:03:26.190> go<00:03:26.310> back<00:03:26.459> to<00:03:26.549> 7<00:03:26.819> you<00:03:26.909> go

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
with the thumb to go back to 7 you go

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.869 
with the thumb to go back to 7 you go
like<00:03:27.120> this<00:03:27.650> and<00:03:28.650> take<00:03:28.829> it<00:03:28.919> to<00:03:29.010> the<00:03:29.099> 7th<00:03:29.400> gear<00:03:29.609> so

00:03:29.869 --> 00:03:29.879 
like this and take it to the 7th gear so

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:33.349 
like this and take it to the 7th gear so
it's<00:03:30.000> real<00:03:30.150> easy<00:03:30.889> Shimano<00:03:31.889> components<00:03:32.359> and

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:33.359 
it's real easy Shimano components and

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:35.330 
it's real easy Shimano components and
though<00:03:33.840> that's<00:03:34.079> it<00:03:34.319> you<00:03:34.799> can<00:03:34.919> have<00:03:35.040> up<00:03:35.189> it

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
though that's it you can have up it

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.550 
though that's it you can have up it

these<00:03:39.629> bikes<00:03:39.930> are<00:03:40.139> heavy<00:03:40.530> I<00:03:40.859> mean<00:03:41.340> they're<00:03:41.459> not

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:41.609 
these bikes are heavy I mean they're not

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:43.759 
these bikes are heavy I mean they're not
happy<00:03:41.819> but<00:03:42.060> they're<00:03:42.209> their<00:03:42.599> bicycles<00:03:43.139> so<00:03:43.259> when

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
happy but they're their bicycles so when

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:45.469 
happy but they're their bicycles so when
you<00:03:43.859> hold<00:03:43.979> the<00:03:44.099> bag<00:03:44.310> it's<00:03:44.939> not<00:03:45.090> real<00:03:45.239> looking<00:03:45.419> I

00:03:45.469 --> 00:03:45.479 
you hold the bag it's not real looking I

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:47.509 
you hold the bag it's not real looking I
did<00:03:45.689> a<00:03:45.720> hole<00:03:45.900> just<00:03:46.049> from<00:03:46.229> the<00:03:46.290> handle<00:03:46.680> better

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
did a hole just from the handle better

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:48.860 
did a hole just from the handle better
put<00:03:47.669> the<00:03:47.759> bike<00:03:47.909> in<00:03:47.939> the<00:03:48.150> bag<00:03:48.329> and<00:03:48.569> just<00:03:48.720> hold

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
put the bike in the bag and just hold

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.449 
put the bike in the bag and just hold
the<00:03:48.930> frame<00:03:49.229> of<00:03:49.439> the<00:03:49.500> bike<00:03:49.680> at<00:03:49.949> the<00:03:50.040> same<00:03:50.220> time

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
the frame of the bike at the same time

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:51.710 
the frame of the bike at the same time
when<00:03:50.639> you're<00:03:50.729> carrying<00:03:50.970> the<00:03:51.120> bag<00:03:51.299> instead<00:03:51.569> of

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
when you're carrying the bag instead of

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:52.699 
when you're carrying the bag instead of
holding<00:03:51.840> it<00:03:51.989> about<00:03:52.139> the<00:03:52.199> handles<00:03:52.500> because<00:03:52.650> you

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
holding it about the handles because you

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:55.069 
holding it about the handles because you
might<00:03:52.859> rip<00:03:53.040> the<00:03:53.159> bag<00:03:53.599> and<00:03:54.599> the<00:03:54.689> alloys<00:03:54.959> the

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079 
might rip the bag and the alloys the

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:56.960 
might rip the bag and the alloys the
same<00:03:55.259> way<00:03:55.379> both<00:03:55.680> this<00:03:56.009> was<00:03:56.159> the<00:03:56.280> steel<00:03:56.699> model

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
same way both this was the steel model

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.879 
same way both this was the steel model
that<00:03:57.359> I<00:03:57.389> demonstrated<00:03:57.959> the<00:03:58.259> outlet<00:03:58.560> models

00:03:58.879 --> 00:03:58.889 
that I demonstrated the outlet models

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:01.580 
that I demonstrated the outlet models
are<00:03:59.009> saying<00:03:59.509> it's<00:04:00.509> even<00:04:00.840> easier<00:04:01.139> the<00:04:01.259> folding

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
are saying it's even easier the folding

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.009 
are saying it's even easier the folding
latch<00:04:01.709> on<00:04:01.919> the<00:04:01.949> alloy<00:04:02.129> bottle<00:04:02.609> is<00:04:03.540> even<00:04:03.870> easier

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
latch on the alloy bottle is even easier

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:05.839 
latch on the alloy bottle is even easier
it's<00:04:04.379> everything<00:04:04.949> else<00:04:05.099> was<00:04:05.310> the<00:04:05.489> same<00:04:05.549> the

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:05.849 
it's everything else was the same the

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:07.369 
it's everything else was the same the
handlebars<00:04:06.239> all<00:04:06.569> the<00:04:06.720> other<00:04:06.870> components<00:04:07.319> are

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:07.379 
handlebars all the other components are

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:09.800 
handlebars all the other components are
the<00:04:07.439> same<00:04:07.650> but<00:04:08.549> has<00:04:08.699> a<00:04:08.729> folding<00:04:09.209> latch<00:04:09.359> here<00:04:09.659> it

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
the same but has a folding latch here it

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.050 
the same but has a folding latch here it
just<00:04:09.989> goes<00:04:10.319> up<00:04:10.500> you<00:04:10.889> just<00:04:11.069> release<00:04:11.340> it<00:04:11.370> and

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
just goes up you just release it and

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.969 
just goes up you just release it and
that's<00:04:12.239> it<00:04:12.509> real<00:04:13.079> nice<00:04:13.229> folding<00:04:13.620> lines<00:04:13.769> that's

00:04:13.969 --> 00:04:13.979 
that's it real nice folding lines that's

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:16.069 
that's it real nice folding lines that's
the<00:04:14.040> only<00:04:14.189> difference<00:04:14.720> so<00:04:15.720> that's<00:04:15.840> an<00:04:15.930> alloy

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 
the only difference so that's an alloy

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:17.539 
the only difference so that's an alloy
pulling<00:04:16.500> latch<00:04:16.680> as<00:04:16.829> opposed<00:04:17.130> to<00:04:17.220> the<00:04:17.310> steel

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 
folding lash but everything else folds

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.649
