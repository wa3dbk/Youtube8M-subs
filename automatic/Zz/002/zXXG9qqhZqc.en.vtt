00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 and the memory of a very special date 

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:06.330
 sorry but those dates that are left 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.880
 forever in memory in the 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.250
 history a day like today died yesterday 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.840
 then surely if I ask 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.120
 you where if you remember they were 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.580
 surely they must agree with those 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.470
 facts that are working 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:24.029
 ayrton senna da silva was a true 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:27.980
 idol the great Brazilian idol and he killed himself 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:32.009
 the first of May of 1994 to celebrate and 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.850
 of course it 's more than pee and of course it's 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.309
 unanimous 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:41.090
 Ayrton Senna killed himself on May Day 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:44.670
 of 1994 in imola and really that image 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:46.320
 it's going to stay forever it 's done that 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.660
 we were all watching the race in 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.750
 a golden age of the formula-1 scene 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.030
 he was three-time world champion was a great 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.469
 bad prize because the previous day was 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.100
 he had killed the Austrian ronald 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:01.440
 reichenberger senna was coming in a moment 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.730
 in that they pressed him he was 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.800
 looking for a victory that does not 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.250
 I found the return to his car 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:10.080
 and some experts say that was what 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.090
 that motivated to take that curve of tamburello 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.980
 out there faster than 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.570
 advisable they did not have so many measures of 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.150
 safety in the cars or speak because 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.540
 there were later more shocking accidents 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.560
 with another ending for himself protagonist in 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.840
 the sixth round 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.450
 ayrton senna went first and michael 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:31.050
 Schumacher pressed him from behind the 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:34.620
 Brazilian did not double and traveled to 314 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:36.660
 kilometers towards the fatal blow the track 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:39.990
 It was filled with security personnel then 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:42.300
 came a helicopter and finally the 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.120
 lamentable news that we could intuit 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:48.000
 because scene did not move when 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:51.450
 I took the aerial image dinner did not move 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.060
 at 3 o'clock death was confirmed and 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.460
 3 days his body arrived in Brazil more 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.220
 of two million people marched 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:02.250
 During the funeral, no one was missing 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:05.790
 alain prost his rival of everything in being 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.770
 present that day not only shook the 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.050
 formula one was shaken the world of 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.930
 sport because there is tension in an icon 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:16.560
 that scene image if it's prior to the 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.840
 started that same day on the same day 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.910
 speculations say that he felt something 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.180
 that something was not right that was not 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:26.910
 confident and ended up finding death 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.370
 after a while because there were only six 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:32.310
 turns one of the biggest of the 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.890
 history three times world champion 34 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.620

 Hiring him says he finished his career 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.160
 in Ferrari that was very advanced and 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.740
 almost closed to business and if 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:54.200
 surely there are the tasks of 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:57.340
 reanimation look at that image 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:01.160
