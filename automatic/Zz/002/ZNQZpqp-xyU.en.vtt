now why the peddle drive unit is pretty

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.590 
now why the peddle drive unit is pretty
efficient<00:00:55.920> I've<00:00:56.010> got<00:00:56.130> to<00:00:56.220> tell<00:00:56.370> you<00:00:56.600> it's

efficient I've got to tell you it's
still<00:00:57.809> a<00:00:57.840> bit<00:00:57.989> of<00:00:58.079> hard<00:00:58.290> work<00:00:58.500> when<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.800> top

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
still a bit of hard work when the top

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.369 
still a bit of hard work when the top
gets<00:00:59.190> up<00:00:59.570> and<00:01:00.570> for<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:00.840> fellow<00:01:01.079> of<00:01:01.230> more

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
gets up and for a fellow of more

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.790 
gets up and for a fellow of more
proportions<00:01:02.420> it's<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.660> it<00:01:04.140> is<00:01:04.260> a<00:01:04.379> bit<00:01:04.589> of<00:01:04.650> hard

far<00:01:54.920> from<00:01:54.950> fit<00:01:55.369> let's<00:01:55.940> be<00:01:56.150> honest<00:01:56.450> and<00:01:57.460> now

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
far from fit let's be honest and now

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.810 
far from fit let's be honest and now
here<00:01:58.670> we<00:01:58.759> are<00:01:58.790> paddling<00:01:59.180> against<00:01:59.659> the<00:01:59.750> tide<00:02:00.820> at

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
here we are paddling against the tide at

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.760 
here we are paddling against the tide at
a<00:02:01.880> steady<00:02:02.149> rate<00:02:02.420> of<00:02:02.600> between<00:02:02.720> five<00:02:03.409> and<00:02:03.500> a<00:02:03.619> half

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
a steady rate of between five and a half

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.609 
a steady rate of between five and a half
and<00:02:03.950> six<00:02:04.040> Cades<00:02:04.340> an<00:02:04.490> hour<00:02:04.640> I<00:02:05.500> reckon<00:02:06.500> that's

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619 
and six Cades an hour I reckon that's

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:12.500 
and six Cades an hour I reckon that's
pretty<00:02:06.830> good

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.449 

coming<00:02:13.140> up<00:02:13.230> into<00:02:13.470> some<00:02:13.650> shallow<00:02:13.980> water<00:02:14.250> now

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:44.309 

to<00:02:24.450> me<00:02:24.599> that<00:02:25.049> means<00:02:25.200> fishy

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:46.910 

alright<00:02:45.040> so<00:02:45.189> in<00:02:45.280> a<00:02:45.370> minute<00:02:45.610> 1/2<00:02:45.879> of<00:02:46.000> water<00:02:46.150> now

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
alright so in a minute 1/2 of water now

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.520 
alright so in a minute 1/2 of water now
lots<00:02:47.920> of<00:02:48.069> scattered<00:02:48.849> weed<00:02:49.030> and<00:02:49.269> sand<00:02:49.510> beds<00:02:49.719> now

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
lots of scattered weed and sand beds now

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.410 
lots of scattered weed and sand beds now
this<00:02:50.799> is<00:02:50.980> absolutely<00:02:51.340> prime<00:02:52.060> floody

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
this is absolutely prime floody

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.410 
this is absolutely prime floody
territory<00:02:53.790> so<00:02:54.790> gonna<00:02:55.000> hit<00:02:55.120> a<00:02:55.150> little<00:02:55.329> bit

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
territory so gonna hit a little bit

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.720 
territory so gonna hit a little bit
upstream<00:02:55.920> and<00:02:56.920> just<00:02:57.099> drift<00:02:57.310> back<00:02:57.489> with<00:02:57.670> the

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
upstream and just drift back with the

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.490 
upstream and just drift back with the
current<00:02:58.090> flick<00:02:58.719> the<00:02:58.810> plastic<00:02:59.170> around<00:02:59.260> the

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
current flick the plastic around the

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:05.559 
current flick the plastic around the
edges<00:02:59.769> of<00:02:59.799> these<00:03:00.010> weed<00:03:00.250> beds<00:03:01.950> well<00:03:02.950> well

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:05.569 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:07.300 

I<00:03:05.629> think<00:03:06.290> we<00:03:06.409> might<00:03:06.560> be<00:03:06.620> snagged<00:03:06.950> up<00:03:07.099> on<00:03:07.219> the

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
I think we might be snagged up on the

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:41.780 
I think we might be snagged up on the
bottom<00:03:10.389> or<00:03:11.389> not

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:55.460
