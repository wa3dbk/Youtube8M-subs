fly<00:01:24.270> ball<00:01:24.840> is<00:01:25.159> pretty<00:01:26.159> much<00:01:26.340> just<00:01:26.790> touching

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
fly ball is pretty much just touching

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.510 
fly ball is pretty much just touching
the<00:01:27.360> screen<00:01:27.689> level<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.380> by<00:01:29.280> adjusting

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
the screen level and by adjusting

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.899 
the screen level and by adjusting
convergence<00:01:30.270> we<00:01:30.420> can<00:01:30.570> move<00:01:31.040> the<00:01:32.040> effect<00:01:32.340> the

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
convergence we can move the effect the

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.060 
convergence we can move the effect the
3d<00:01:33.150> effect<00:01:33.210> into<00:01:33.720> or<00:01:34.200> further<00:01:34.590> out<00:01:34.799> of<00:01:34.829> the

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
3d effect into or further out of the

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.310 
3d effect into or further out of the
screen<00:01:35.340> now<00:01:35.909> it's<00:01:36.030> important<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.450> understand

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
screen now it's important to understand

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.240 
screen now it's important to understand
that<00:01:37.380> you're<00:01:37.530> not<00:01:37.619> actually<00:01:37.770> adjusting

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
that you're not actually adjusting

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.130 
that you're not actually adjusting
amount<00:01:38.640> of<00:01:38.850> 3d<00:01:39.150> in<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.420> scene<00:01:39.600> these<00:01:40.020> are

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
amount of 3d in the scene these are

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.780 
amount of 3d in the scene these are
already<00:01:40.350> pre<00:01:40.590> rendered<00:01:40.829> so<00:01:41.250> all<00:01:41.610> you're

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
already pre rendered so all you're

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.200 
already pre rendered so all you're
adjusting<00:01:42.090> is<00:01:42.799> where<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:44.009> actual<00:01:44.159> 3d<00:01:44.700> occurs

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
adjusting is where the actual 3d occurs

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.690 
adjusting is where the actual 3d occurs
so<00:01:45.659> you<00:01:46.200> know<00:01:46.320> it's<00:01:46.560> further<00:01:46.979> within<00:01:47.460> the

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
so you know it's further within the

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.639 
so you know it's further within the
screen<00:01:47.939> or<00:01:48.180> it's<00:01:48.329> coming<00:01:49.049> out<00:01:49.170> of<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.409> screen

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
screen or it's coming out of the screen

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.590 
screen or it's coming out of the screen
so<00:01:50.369> if<00:01:50.490> you<00:01:50.610> wanted<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:51.119> show<00:01:51.240> everything

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
so if you wanted to show everything

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.469 
so if you wanted to show everything
right<00:01:52.140> back<00:01:52.439> into<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.920> screen<00:01:53.299> perhaps<00:01:54.299> if

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
right back into the screen perhaps if

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.109 
right back into the screen perhaps if
you<00:01:54.600> were<00:01:54.689> rendering<00:01:55.170> for<00:01:55.500> a<00:01:55.560> smaller<00:01:56.250> smaller

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
you were rendering for a smaller smaller

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.910 
you were rendering for a smaller smaller
screen<00:01:57.659> you<00:01:58.020> might<00:01:58.200> want<00:01:58.380> everything<00:01:58.619> within

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
screen you might want everything within

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.010 
screen you might want everything within
it<00:01:59.159> because<00:01:59.969> it<00:02:00.060> can<00:02:00.180> become<00:02:00.329> natural<00:02:00.899> with

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
it because it can become natural with

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.260 
it because it can become natural with
things<00:02:01.229> take<00:02:01.439> out<00:02:01.560> a<00:02:01.619> small<00:02:01.799> screen<00:02:02.130> you<00:02:02.729> would

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
things take out a small screen you would

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.319 
things take out a small screen you would
take<00:02:03.659> convergence<00:02:04.850> controller<00:02:05.850> and<00:02:06.060> move<00:02:06.210> it

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
take convergence controller and move it

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.050 
take convergence controller and move it
down<00:02:06.360> to<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.469> left<00:02:07.710> so<00:02:08.340> as<00:02:08.459> you<00:02:08.580> can<00:02:08.729> see<00:02:08.970> if

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
down to the left so as you can see if

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.520 
down to the left so as you can see if
you're<00:02:09.239> watching<00:02:09.450> with<00:02:09.750> your<00:02:09.929> glasses<00:02:10.140> and

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
you're watching with your glasses and

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.880 
you're watching with your glasses and
pretty<00:02:11.250> much<00:02:11.310> all<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:11.879> eyeballs<00:02:12.239> are<00:02:12.390> now

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
pretty much all the eyeballs are now

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.590 
pretty much all the eyeballs are now
well<00:02:13.010> within<00:02:13.250> the<00:02:13.460> screen<00:02:13.700> surrounded<00:02:14.090> I<00:02:14.210> this

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
well within the screen surrounded I this

well within the screen surrounded I this
central<00:02:15.260> eyeball<00:02:15.590> has<00:02:15.740> moved<00:02:15.980> back<00:02:16.580> from

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
pretty far back into the screen if you

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:26.830 
pretty far back into the screen if you

wanted to do the opposite if you were

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.710 
wanted to do the opposite if you were
putting<00:02:27.260> this<00:02:27.380> on<00:02:27.530> a<00:02:27.590> larger<00:02:28.280> screen<00:02:28.540> we<00:02:29.540> might

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
putting this on a larger screen we might

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.199 
putting this on a larger screen we might
want<00:02:29.900> to<00:02:30.020> adjust<00:02:30.080> the<00:02:30.320> convergence<00:02:30.830> so<00:02:30.980> that

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
want to adjust the convergence so that

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:34.260 
want to adjust the convergence so that
objects<00:02:32.209> are<00:02:32.390> above<00:02:32.840> the<00:02:32.870> screen<00:02:33.170> you<00:02:33.770> simply

objects are above the screen you simply

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.760 
objects are above the screen you simply
slide<00:02:35.270> the<00:02:35.420> controller<00:02:35.990> up<00:02:36.170> to<00:02:36.320> the<00:02:36.410> right<00:02:36.590> and

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
crazed extent but you wouldn't really

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
want to do that and also don't forget

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.190 
want to do that and also don't forget
your<00:02:52.070> anaglyph<00:02:52.730> preview<00:02:53.510> here<00:02:53.720> is<00:02:53.870> more

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
your anaglyph preview here is more

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.340 
your anaglyph preview here is more
likely<00:02:54.440> to<00:02:54.680> be<00:02:54.830> a<00:02:55.160> bit<00:02:55.910> ghosty<00:02:56.360> then<00:02:56.570> if<00:02:57.200> you're

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
likely to be a bit ghosty then if you're

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.800 
likely to be a bit ghosty then if you're
watching<00:02:57.470> on<00:02:57.769> that<00:02:57.920> on<00:02:58.370> a<00:02:58.430> good<00:02:58.670> quality<00:02:59.180> 3d

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
watching on that on a good quality 3d

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.890 
watching on that on a good quality 3d
monitor<00:03:00.140> or<00:03:00.530> 3d<00:03:00.860> TV<00:03:01.190> so<00:03:01.850> you<00:03:02.180> might<00:03:02.510> want<00:03:02.690> to<00:03:02.750> do

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
monitor or 3d TV so you might want to do

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.540 
monitor or 3d TV so you might want to do
something<00:03:03.260> like<00:03:03.290> that<00:03:03.440> where<00:03:03.920> by<00:03:04.070> you've<00:03:04.310> got

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
something like that where by you've got

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.720 
something like that where by you've got
the<00:03:04.750> central<00:03:05.750> eyeball<00:03:06.370> sticking<00:03:07.370> out<00:03:07.489> we've

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
the central eyeball sticking out we've

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.699 
the central eyeball sticking out we've
got<00:03:08.000> the<00:03:08.150> other<00:03:08.390> eyeballs<00:03:08.900> round<00:03:09.380> about<00:03:09.620> the

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
got the other eyeballs round about the

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:12.820 
got the other eyeballs round about the
screen<00:03:09.980> plane<00:03:10.250> and<00:03:11.110> so<00:03:12.110> that's<00:03:12.260> adjusting<00:03:12.739> the

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
screen plane and so that's adjusting the

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:14.080 
screen plane and so that's adjusting the
convergence<00:03:13.340> once<00:03:13.550> you<00:03:13.670> adjust<00:03:13.790> the

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
convergence once you adjust the

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.210 
convergence once you adjust the
convergence<00:03:14.720> and<00:03:15.019> then<00:03:15.590> you<00:03:15.680> have<00:03:15.800> to<00:03:15.890> decide

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
convergence and then you have to decide

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.880 
convergence and then you have to decide
on<00:03:16.550> your<00:03:16.670> output<00:03:17.299> format<00:03:17.660> now<00:03:18.290> you<00:03:18.709> could

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
on your output format now you could

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.220 
on your output format now you could
output<00:03:19.280> the<00:03:19.430> anaglyph<00:03:19.730> version<00:03:20.630> as<00:03:20.750> you<00:03:21.049> have

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
output the anaglyph version as you have

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:22.750 
output the anaglyph version as you have
it<00:03:21.350> here<00:03:21.620> you<00:03:21.769> might<00:03:21.950> actually<00:03:22.160> want<00:03:22.400> to

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
it here you might actually want to

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.880 
it here you might actually want to
adjust<00:03:24.970> some<00:03:25.970> of<00:03:26.000> the<00:03:26.470> you<00:03:27.470> might<00:03:27.620> want<00:03:27.799> to

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
adjust some of the you might want to

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:29.890 
adjust some of the you might want to
adjust<00:03:27.980> the<00:03:28.280> colors<00:03:28.640> in<00:03:28.910> the<00:03:29.420> left<00:03:29.630> and<00:03:29.840> right

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
adjust the colors in the left and right

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.870 
adjust the colors in the left and right
comps<00:03:30.470> to<00:03:31.130> actually<00:03:32.320> get<00:03:33.320> rid<00:03:33.470> of<00:03:33.500> any<00:03:33.739> or<00:03:34.459> to

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
comps to actually get rid of any or to

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.729 
comps to actually get rid of any or to
limit<00:03:35.060> at<00:03:35.540> least<00:03:35.780> to<00:03:35.959> the<00:03:36.049> amount<00:03:36.260> of<00:03:36.320> ghosting

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
limit at least to the amount of ghosting

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:38.949 
limit at least to the amount of ghosting
so<00:03:37.160> you<00:03:37.220> can<00:03:37.370> output<00:03:37.760> anaglyph<00:03:38.180> here<00:03:38.360> however

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 
so you can output anaglyph here however

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:40.630 
so you can output anaglyph here however
let's<00:03:38.989> say<00:03:39.290> you<00:03:39.350> wanted<00:03:39.650> to<00:03:39.769> help<00:03:39.950> a<00:03:40.130> version

preference<00:04:11.870> now<00:04:12.350> the<00:04:12.410> naming<00:04:12.920> convention<00:04:13.489> is

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:13.579 
preference now the naming convention is

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:15.310 
preference now the naming convention is
left<00:04:13.820> right<00:04:14.180> that<00:04:14.420> means<00:04:14.570> left<00:04:14.900> is<00:04:15.079> on<00:04:15.200> the

left right that means left is on the

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
right if it's the other way around you

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:20.629 
right if it's the other way around you
have<00:04:19.220> right<00:04:19.430> on<00:04:19.489> the<00:04:19.789> left<00:04:19.970> and<00:04:20.209> left<00:04:20.329> on

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:20.639 
have right on the left and left on

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:22.610 
have right on the left and left on
the<00:04:20.699> right<00:04:20.900> so<00:04:21.900> we<00:04:21.989> can<00:04:22.079> have<00:04:22.169> a<00:04:22.259> little<00:04:22.379> look

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
the right so we can have a little look

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.129 
the right so we can have a little look
in<00:04:22.740> here<00:04:23.039> and<00:04:23.249> as<00:04:23.340> you<00:04:23.520> see<00:04:23.789> we've<00:04:24.509> got<00:04:24.840> the

in here and as you see we've got the
left<00:04:25.650> and<00:04:25.919> right<00:04:27.050> animations<00:04:28.550> positioned

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
left and right animations positioned

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:30.679 
left and right animations positioned
correctly<00:04:29.639> now<00:04:30.060> you<00:04:30.120> don't<00:04:30.360> need<00:04:30.419> to<00:04:30.599> worry

00:04:30.679 --> 00:04:30.689 
correctly now you don't need to worry

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:32.809 
correctly now you don't need to worry
about<00:04:30.779> the<00:04:30.960> convergence<00:04:31.499> the<00:04:31.680> convergence<00:04:32.279> is

00:04:32.809 --> 00:04:32.819 
about the convergence the convergence is

00:04:32.819 --> 00:04:35.179 
about the convergence the convergence is
automatically<00:04:33.300> done<00:04:33.870> from<00:04:34.379> your<00:04:34.740> a<00:04:34.770> graph

00:04:35.179 --> 00:04:35.189 
automatically done from your a graph

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:37.159 
automatically done from your a graph
preview<00:04:35.400> so<00:04:36.120> convergence<00:04:36.689> carried<00:04:37.110> across

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:37.169 
preview so convergence carried across

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:39.769 
preview so convergence carried across
for<00:04:37.620> any<00:04:37.830> of<00:04:37.979> the<00:04:38.099> other<00:04:38.219> renders<00:04:38.580> you<00:04:39.569> also

00:04:39.769 --> 00:04:39.779 
for any of the other renders you also

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:42.709 
for any of the other renders you also
have<00:04:39.930> above<00:04:40.560> and<00:04:40.710> below<00:04:40.949> render<00:04:41.639> options<00:04:41.789> so

00:04:42.709 --> 00:04:42.719 
have above and below render options so

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:47.809 
have above and below render options so
you'll<00:04:43.289> find<00:04:43.620> certain<00:04:46.279> perhaps<00:04:47.279> computers

00:04:47.809 --> 00:04:47.819 
you'll find certain perhaps computers

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:50.330 
you'll find certain perhaps computers
perhaps<00:04:48.210> certain<00:04:48.599> software<00:04:48.990> TVs<00:04:49.680> prefer

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
perhaps certain software TVs prefer

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.369 
perhaps certain software TVs prefer
using<00:04:50.490> enough<00:04:50.789> book<00:04:50.999> and<00:04:51.449> above<00:04:51.689> below<00:04:51.960> format

00:04:52.369 --> 00:04:52.379 
using enough book and above below format

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:55.369 
using enough book and above below format
so<00:04:52.949> again<00:04:53.310> we've<00:04:53.610> created<00:04:54.029> a<00:04:54.449> whole<00:04:54.870> range<00:04:55.110> of

00:04:55.369 --> 00:04:55.379 
so again we've created a whole range of

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:59.209 
so again we've created a whole range of
above<00:04:56.129> below<00:04:56.430> render<00:04:57.229> formats<00:04:58.229> for<00:04:58.529> you<00:04:58.740> just

00:04:59.209 --> 00:04:59.219 
above below render formats for you just

00:04:59.219 --> 00:05:01.189 
above below render formats for you just
really<00:04:59.610> ready<00:04:59.939> to<00:05:00.060> go<00:05:00.270> once<00:05:00.900> you've<00:05:01.050> adjusted

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:01.199 
really ready to go once you've adjusted

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:03.439 
really ready to go once you've adjusted
your<00:05:01.680> convergence<00:05:02.310> that's<00:05:03.029> pretty<00:05:03.240> much<00:05:03.330> it

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:03.449 
your convergence that's pretty much it

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:06.769 
your convergence that's pretty much it
choose<00:05:04.259> your<00:05:04.409> render<00:05:05.340> comp<00:05:05.580> and<00:05:05.819> off<00:05:06.509> you<00:05:06.750> go

00:05:06.769 --> 00:05:06.779 
choose your render comp and off you go

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:09.110 
choose your render comp and off you go
and<00:05:06.900> render<00:05:07.229> it<00:05:07.259> I<00:05:07.729> hope<00:05:08.729> that's<00:05:08.879> been<00:05:09.060> helpful
