00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:21.050 
helping design boards at Channel Islands
he's<00:01:19.049> had<00:01:19.310> various<00:01:20.310> models<00:01:20.729> through<00:01:20.969> the

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
named after him you know Machado model

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.310 
named after him you know Machado model
short<00:01:26.759> board<00:01:27.030> that<00:01:27.210> sort<00:01:27.390> of<00:01:27.420> thing<00:01:27.479> but<00:01:27.719> the

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
short board that sort of thing but the

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.569 
short board that sort of thing but the
past<00:01:28.530> couple<00:01:28.740> years<00:01:28.859> he's<00:01:29.159> really<00:01:29.460> been

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
past couple years he's really been

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.370 
past couple years he's really been
experimenting<00:01:30.210> more<00:01:30.359> with<00:01:30.630> boards<00:01:31.200> with

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
experimenting more with boards with

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.859 
experimenting more with boards with
higher<00:01:31.619> volumes<00:01:32.100> and<00:01:32.369> lower<00:01:33.060> rockers<00:01:33.630> and

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
higher volumes and lower rockers and

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.160 
higher volumes and lower rockers and
fairly<00:01:34.829> shorter<00:01:35.759> lengths<00:01:36.149> compared<00:01:36.570> to<00:01:36.719> to

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
fairly shorter lengths compared to to

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.499 
fairly shorter lengths compared to to
the<00:01:37.320> average<00:01:37.679> board<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:38.579> so<00:01:38.969> the<00:01:39.060> motor<00:01:39.270> boat

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
the average board and so the motor boat

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.300 
the average board and so the motor boat
this<00:01:39.840> year<00:01:39.899> is<00:01:40.350> something<00:01:40.710> that<00:01:40.799> he<00:01:40.979> has

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
this year is something that he has

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.090 
this year is something that he has
created<00:01:41.939> out<00:01:42.479> of<00:01:42.509> a<00:01:43.079> couple<00:01:43.560> boards<00:01:43.740> that<00:01:43.950> he

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
created out of a couple boards that he

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.330 
created out of a couple boards that he
had<00:01:44.310> previously<00:01:44.960> been<00:01:45.960> working<00:01:46.950> on<00:01:47.100> he

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
had previously been working on he

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.800 
had previously been working on he
designed<00:01:47.880> a<00:01:47.969> board<00:01:48.149> called<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:48.420> biscuit<00:01:48.780> a

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
designed a board called the biscuit a

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.270 
designed a board called the biscuit a
few<00:01:49.020> years<00:01:49.170> back<00:01:49.350> which<00:01:49.619> was<00:01:49.740> a<00:01:49.770> really<00:01:50.100> high

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
few years back which was a really high

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.080

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:07.219 
both of those boards basically where the
answer<00:02:05.549> to<00:02:05.789> being<00:02:06.539> able<00:02:06.630> to<00:02:06.810> serve<00:02:06.990> something

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
answer to being able to serve something

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.870 
answer to being able to serve something
other<00:02:07.469> than<00:02:07.619> a<00:02:07.679> longboard<00:02:08.160> and<00:02:08.369> really<00:02:08.640> really

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
other than a longboard and really really

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.540 
other than a longboard and really really
small<00:02:09.090> surf<00:02:09.390> and<00:02:09.660> then<00:02:10.410> from<00:02:11.040> there<00:02:11.280> he

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
small surf and then from there he

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.670 
small surf and then from there he
created<00:02:12.000> a<00:02:12.060> board<00:02:12.270> called<00:02:12.540> the<00:02:12.630> gravy

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
created a board called the gravy

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.030 
created a board called the gravy
and<00:02:13.799> the<00:02:13.980> gravy<00:02:14.569> was<00:02:15.569> a<00:02:15.599> scaled-down<00:02:16.170> version

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
and the gravy was a scaled-down version

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.399 
and the gravy was a scaled-down version
of<00:02:17.219> the<00:02:17.700> biscuit<00:02:18.120> in<00:02:18.269> that<00:02:18.599> the<00:02:18.870> rails<00:02:19.140> were

00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:19.409 
of the biscuit in that the rails were

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:21.530 
of the biscuit in that the rails were
really<00:02:20.010> thinned<00:02:20.430> out<00:02:20.579> the<00:02:21.209> tail<00:02:21.510> was

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
really thinned out the tail was

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.119 
really thinned out the tail was
especially<00:02:22.049> thin<00:02:22.500> it<00:02:22.680> was<00:02:22.769> a<00:02:22.829> bit<00:02:23.010> more

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:23.129 
especially thin it was a bit more

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:24.770 
especially thin it was a bit more
performance<00:02:23.310> and<00:02:23.819> it<00:02:23.909> turned<00:02:24.090> out<00:02:24.239> to<00:02:24.420> be<00:02:24.569> a

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
performance and it turned out to be a

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.399 
performance and it turned out to be a
good<00:02:25.349> board<00:02:25.560> to<00:02:25.680> ride<00:02:25.799> in<00:02:25.980> hollow<00:02:26.189> surf<00:02:27.409> this

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:28.409 
good board to ride in hollow surf this

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:31.339 
good board to ride in hollow surf this
year<00:02:28.909> with<00:02:29.909> the<00:02:30.060> motorboat<00:02:30.510> what<00:02:30.959> he's<00:02:31.079> tried

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
year with the motorboat what he's tried

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:34.849 
year with the motorboat what he's tried
to<00:02:31.469> do<00:02:31.650> is<00:02:31.829> do<00:02:32.549> a<00:02:32.579> couple<00:02:32.909> things<00:02:33.060> he's<00:02:33.859> really

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:34.859 
to do is do a couple things he's really

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:37.729 
to do is do a couple things he's really
meshed<00:02:35.430> together<00:02:35.609> the<00:02:36.299> best<00:02:36.599> of<00:02:36.870> those<00:02:37.409> prior

production that's an initiative of his I
think<00:06:08.710> it's<00:06:09.710> through<00:06:10.010> future<00:06:10.400> with<00:06:10.729> the<00:06:10.910> fins

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:11.180 
think it's through future with the fins

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.170 
think it's through future with the fins
I<00:06:11.419> could<00:06:11.570> be<00:06:11.690> wrong<00:06:11.870> but<00:06:12.820> he's<00:06:13.820> doing

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:17.750 
production cost of the boards is

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:19.270 
production cost of the boards is
actually<00:06:18.110> going<00:06:18.290> back<00:06:18.560> to<00:06:18.770> create<00:06:19.100> these

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:19.280

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:25.520 
he's actually working on the side angle

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.130 
he's actually working on the side angle
with<00:06:26.060> the<00:06:26.090> production<00:06:26.390> of<00:06:26.630> the<00:06:26.720> board<00:06:26.930> to<00:06:27.020> be

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:27.140 
with the production of the board to be

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:34.760 
things with the production process of

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:37.730 
things with the production process of
the<00:06:34.880> board<00:06:35.090> very<00:06:35.840> cool<00:06:36.110> um<00:06:36.380> is<00:06:36.860> there

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:37.740 
the board very cool um is there

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:40.189 
the board very cool um is there
I<00:06:37.830> guess<00:06:38.099> in<00:06:38.280> a<00:06:38.610> couple<00:06:39.479> of<00:06:39.599> sentences<00:06:39.840> what

00:06:40.189 --> 00:06:40.199 
I guess in a couple of sentences what

00:06:40.199 --> 00:06:42.260 
I guess in a couple of sentences what
would<00:06:40.349> you<00:06:40.500> say<00:06:40.740> this<00:06:40.919> board<00:06:41.250> is<00:06:41.430> the<00:06:41.699> best<00:06:41.970> for

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:42.270 
would you say this board is the best for

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:46.100 
would you say this board is the best for
small<00:06:42.810> sir<00:06:43.340> I<00:06:44.340> think<00:06:44.729> it's<00:06:45.690> going<00:06:45.840> to<00:06:45.930> be<00:06:46.020> a

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:46.110 
small sir I think it's going to be a

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:48.499 
small sir I think it's going to be a
