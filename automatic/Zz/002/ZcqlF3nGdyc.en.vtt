00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:41.980 
and all of my engine skin products are
done<00:02:34.380> in<00:02:35.310> blue<00:02:36.350> swatch<00:02:37.350> it<00:02:37.620> the<00:02:37.770> blue<00:02:38.010> ribbon

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:41.990 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:45.820 

I'm<00:02:42.990> gonna<00:02:43.140> lie<00:02:43.320> it<00:02:43.380> down<00:02:43.860> on<00:02:44.370> the<00:02:44.640> table<00:02:45.210> and

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
I'm gonna lie it down on the table and

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:50.540 
I'm gonna lie it down on the table and
I'll<00:02:46.830> tie<00:02:47.100> it<00:02:47.130> in<00:02:47.460> a<00:02:47.580> knot<00:02:48.200> over<00:02:49.200> once<00:02:49.470> and<00:02:49.830> over

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
I'll tie it in a knot over once and over

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.450 
I'll tie it in a knot over once and over
twice<00:02:51.030> and<00:02:51.450> the<00:02:51.630> reason<00:02:52.110> I<00:02:52.320> do<00:02:52.380> it<00:02:52.830> twice<00:02:53.100> is

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
twice and the reason I do it twice is

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.550 
twice and the reason I do it twice is
because<00:02:53.880> when<00:02:54.120> I<00:02:54.150> pull<00:02:54.480> it<00:02:54.510> together<00:02:54.780> it

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
because when I pull it together it

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.790 
because when I pull it together it
doesn't<00:02:56.190> open<00:02:56.430> back<00:02:56.790> up<00:02:57.030> again<00:02:57.360> if<00:02:58.200> you<00:02:58.440> do<00:02:58.650> it

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
doesn't open back up again if you do it

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.980 
doesn't open back up again if you do it
once<00:02:59.100> it's<00:02:59.640> not<00:02:59.940> tight<00:03:00.300> enough<00:03:02.750> it's<00:03:03.750> not

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 
once it's not tight enough it's not

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:07.070 
once it's not tight enough it's not
tight<00:03:04.260> enough<00:03:04.470> and<00:03:04.650> it<00:03:04.890> will<00:03:05.010> come<00:03:05.250> loose<00:03:06.080> so

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
tight enough and it will come loose so

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.680 
tight enough and it will come loose so
then<00:03:07.380> I<00:03:07.650> want<00:03:07.890> my<00:03:08.160> label<00:03:08.700> to<00:03:08.880> stick<00:03:09.180> out<00:03:09.360> this

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
then I want my label to stick out this

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.180 
then I want my label to stick out this
way<00:03:09.959> not<00:03:10.350> like<00:03:10.590> that

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
way not like that

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.449 
way not like that
like<00:03:11.610> that<00:03:11.940> or<00:03:12.209> like<00:03:12.450> that<00:03:12.830> so<00:03:13.830> I<00:03:13.860> put<00:03:14.220> it<00:03:14.310> on

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
like that or like that so I put it on

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:19.340 
like that or like that so I put it on
the<00:03:14.610> right<00:03:14.880> hand<00:03:14.910> side<00:03:16.400> of<00:03:17.400> my<00:03:17.459> ribbon<00:03:18.090> and<00:03:18.350> I

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.470 
the right hand side of my ribbon and I
keep<00:03:19.680> the<00:03:19.890> label<00:03:20.340> where<00:03:20.550> I<00:03:20.580> want<00:03:21.000> it<00:03:21.150> to<00:03:21.209> be

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
keep the label where I want it to be

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:22.780 
keep the label where I want it to be

you<00:03:23.790> become<00:03:24.180> such<00:03:24.480> a<00:03:24.510> perfectionist<00:03:25.050> doing

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
you become such a perfectionist doing

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.330 
you become such a perfectionist doing
things<00:03:26.130> like<00:03:26.250> this<00:03:26.760> that<00:03:27.480> the<00:03:28.230> label<00:03:28.830> has<00:03:29.100> to

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
things like this that the label has to

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.000 
things like this that the label has to
go<00:03:29.520> that<00:03:29.820> way<00:03:30.060> any<00:03:30.510> other<00:03:30.840> way<00:03:31.230> is<00:03:31.530> not<00:03:31.830> an

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
go that way any other way is not an

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.690 
go that way any other way is not an
option<00:03:32.550> for<00:03:32.820> me<00:03:33.410> so<00:03:34.410> I<00:03:34.440> tie<00:03:34.800> it<00:03:34.860> in<00:03:35.160> a<00:03:35.340> tight

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
option for me so I tie it in a tight

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:41.570 
option for me so I tie it in a tight
knot<00:03:36.709> over<00:03:37.709> again<00:03:38.430> and<00:03:39.560> then<00:03:40.560> I<00:03:40.680> get<00:03:40.920> my<00:03:41.130> ribbon

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
knot over again and then I get my ribbon

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.470 
knot over again and then I get my ribbon
and<00:03:41.760> I<00:03:42.030> put<00:03:42.330> my<00:03:42.600> the<00:03:43.170> side<00:03:43.500> of<00:03:43.709> the<00:03:43.890> scissors

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
and I put my the side of the scissors

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.050 
and I put my the side of the scissors
onto<00:03:45.480> the<00:03:45.600> ribbon<00:03:45.860> press<00:03:46.860> onto<00:03:47.340> the<00:03:47.459> corner<00:03:47.910> as

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
onto the ribbon press onto the corner as

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.020 
onto the ribbon press onto the corner as
hard<00:03:48.300> as<00:03:48.480> I<00:03:48.510> can

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.780 

and<00:03:52.030> will<00:03:52.180> not<00:03:52.360> pull<00:03:52.630> it<00:03:52.780> like<00:03:53.140> so<00:03:53.560> if<00:03:54.370> it's<00:03:54.520> not

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
and will not pull it like so if it's not

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:00.690 
and will not pull it like so if it's not
curly<00:03:55.300> enough<00:03:56.550> I<00:03:57.550> just<00:03:58.360> do<00:03:58.600> it<00:03:58.750> again<00:03:59.080> and<00:03:59.980> then

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
curly enough I just do it again and then

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.130 
curly enough I just do it again and then
I<00:04:00.790> do<00:04:00.850> the<00:04:01.240> same<00:04:02.130> with<00:04:03.130> the<00:04:03.280> other<00:04:03.550> side

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 
I do the same with the other side

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:11.910 
I do the same with the other side
so<00:04:05.140> that<00:04:05.470> is<00:04:05.970> one<00:04:09.150> one<00:04:10.150> ready<00:04:10.420> to<00:04:10.510> go<00:04:10.920> still
