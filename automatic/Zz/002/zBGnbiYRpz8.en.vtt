sign other one yeah these are like I've

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:55.479 
sign other one yeah these are like I've
never<00:02:53.900> found<00:02:54.260> rubber<00:02:54.590> trees<00:02:54.890> this<00:02:55.160> close<00:02:55.459> to

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
never found rubber trees this close to

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:57.699 
never found rubber trees this close to
this<00:02:55.700> bomb<00:02:55.910> before<00:02:56.260> but<00:02:57.260> you're<00:02:57.440> gonna<00:02:57.620> need

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
this bomb before but you're gonna need

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:00.520 
this bomb before but you're gonna need
lots<00:02:58.070> and<00:02:58.459> lots<00:02:58.760> of<00:02:58.940> rubber<00:02:59.150> so<00:02:59.450> your<00:03:00.110> best<00:03:00.290> to

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
lots and lots of rubber so your best to

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.270 
lots and lots of rubber so your best to
collect<00:03:00.890> at<00:03:01.100> least<00:03:01.130> like<00:03:02.770> 20<00:03:03.770> to<00:03:03.920> start<00:03:04.160> off

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
collect at least like 20 to start off

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.680 
collect at least like 20 to start off
with<00:03:04.580> because<00:03:04.850> if<00:03:04.970> you<00:03:05.090> don't<00:03:05.239> have<00:03:05.330> enough<00:03:05.570> to

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
with because if you don't have enough to

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:06.850 
with because if you don't have enough to
start<00:03:05.780> off<00:03:06.050> with<00:03:06.290> you're<00:03:06.440> just<00:03:06.560> gonna<00:03:06.650> have<00:03:06.739> to

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
start off with you're just gonna have to

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.000 
start off with you're just gonna have to
keep<00:03:06.980> planting<00:03:07.580> saplings<00:03:08.350> running<00:03:09.350> back<00:03:09.590> and

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
keep planting saplings running back and

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.300 
keep planting saplings running back and
repeating<00:03:10.910> it<00:03:11.000> again<00:03:11.060> and<00:03:11.480> again<00:03:11.540> and<00:03:11.840> again

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
repeating it again and again and again

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.490 
repeating it again and again and again
so<00:03:13.310> i<00:03:13.340> recommend<00:03:13.940> 20<00:03:14.540> saplings<00:03:14.930> to<00:03:15.050> start<00:03:15.320> off

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
so i recommend 20 saplings to start off

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.990 
so i recommend 20 saplings to start off
with<00:03:16.060> until<00:03:17.060> you<00:03:17.300> get<00:03:17.570> your<00:03:18.550> machines<00:03:19.550> up<00:03:19.820> and

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
with until you get your machines up and

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.310 
with until you get your machines up and
running<00:03:20.239> once<00:03:20.540> your<00:03:20.660> machines<00:03:20.959> are<00:03:21.110> up<00:03:21.170> and

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
running once your machines are up and

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.570 
running once your machines are up and
running<00:03:21.459> then<00:03:22.459> you're<00:03:22.790> pretty<00:03:23.420> fine<00:03:23.720> just<00:03:24.049> to

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
running then you're pretty fine just to

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:30.220 
running then you're pretty fine just to
play<00:03:25.580> away<00:03:25.900> actually<00:03:26.900> this<00:03:26.959> one's<00:03:27.170> a<00:03:27.260> tube

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:35.780 

all<00:03:30.709> good<00:03:31.010> I'll<00:03:31.190> get<00:03:31.400> our<00:03:31.849> free

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.260 

another<00:03:36.420> three

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:38.270 
another three

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:41.050 
another three
so<00:03:38.840> 11<00:03:39.140> that's<00:03:39.590> cute

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
so 11 that's cute

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:42.850 
so 11 that's cute
one's<00:03:41.840> going<00:03:41.959> to<00:03:41.989> hack<00:03:42.170> away<00:03:42.319> these<00:03:42.560> saplings

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:42.860 
one's going to hack away these saplings

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:47.140 
one's going to hack away these saplings
just<00:03:43.580> to<00:03:43.730> be<00:03:43.849> sure<00:03:43.880> there's<00:03:44.390> no<00:03:44.510> more

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.630 

one<00:03:47.780> way<00:03:47.930> to<00:03:47.989> tell<00:03:48.500> it's<00:03:48.890> a<00:03:48.980> rubber<00:03:49.189> tree<00:03:49.370> is

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
one way to tell it's a rubber tree is

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.880 
one way to tell it's a rubber tree is
like<00:03:49.939> this<00:03:50.120> because<00:03:50.959> obviously<00:03:51.170> I've<00:03:51.470> got<00:03:51.739> my

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
like this because obviously I've got my

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.309 
like this because obviously I've got my
graph<00:03:52.129> accept<00:03:52.489> fast<00:03:52.760> rather<00:03:53.150> than<00:03:53.269> fancy<00:03:53.629> so

00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:54.319 
graph accept fast rather than fancy so

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:55.869 
graph accept fast rather than fancy so
you<00:03:54.379> can't<00:03:54.650> see<00:03:54.890> through<00:03:55.099> normal<00:03:55.400> trees<00:03:55.640> but

00:03:55.869 --> 00:03:55.879 
you can't see through normal trees but

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:58.750 
you can't see through normal trees but
you<00:03:55.939> can<00:03:56.299> see<00:03:56.720> through<00:03:56.959> rubber<00:03:57.230> trees<00:03:57.530> I<00:03:57.760> think

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
you can see through rubber trees I think

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.039 
you can see through rubber trees I think
it's<00:03:58.849> just<00:03:58.909> the<00:03:59.060> texture<00:03:59.390> part<00:03:59.870> of<00:03:59.959> the

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:00.049 
it's just the texture part of the

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:03.130 
it's just the texture part of the
texture<00:04:00.439> on<00:04:00.590> them<00:04:00.819> it's<00:04:01.819> just<00:04:02.090> set<00:04:02.659> so<00:04:02.900> it<00:04:02.989> has

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140 
texture on them it's just set so it has

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:04.240 
texture on them it's just set so it has
to<00:04:03.260> be<00:04:03.349> a<00:04:03.379> little<00:04:03.530> ash<00:04:03.680> another<00:04:03.950> one<00:04:04.099> that's

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
to be a little ash another one that's

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.559 
to be a little ash another one that's
cute

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:06.569

good<00:04:21.720> to<00:04:21.750> collect<00:04:22.019> the<00:04:22.079> saplings<00:04:22.530> off<00:04:22.680> these

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:22.889 
good to collect the saplings off these

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:25.730 
good to collect the saplings off these
trees<00:04:23.129> good<00:04:23.430> there's<00:04:23.699> one<00:04:24.169> once<00:04:25.169> you<00:04:25.289> have<00:04:25.439> one

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
trees good there's one once you have one

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.890 
trees good there's one once you have one
that's<00:04:26.009> usually<00:04:26.789> okay<00:04:27.120> as<00:04:27.300> long<00:04:27.599> as<00:04:27.780> you

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900

you<00:04:30.240> ever<00:04:30.419> need<00:04:30.930> to<00:04:30.960> get<00:04:31.379> rubber<00:04:32.150> from<00:04:33.150> a

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
you ever need to get rubber from a

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.480 
you ever need to get rubber from a
rubber<00:04:33.479> tree<00:04:33.689> it's<00:04:34.169> always<00:04:34.349> handy<00:04:35.159> to<00:04:35.370> have

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
rubber tree it's always handy to have

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.670 
rubber tree it's always handy to have
saplings<00:04:36.080> because<00:04:37.080> you<00:04:37.199> can<00:04:37.229> plant<00:04:37.469> a<00:04:37.530> rubber

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
saplings because you can plant a rubber

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.350 
saplings because you can plant a rubber
tree<00:04:37.860> and<00:04:38.099> there<00:04:38.580> might<00:04:38.729> be<00:04:38.759> known<00:04:39.000> to<00:04:39.030> start

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
tree and there might be known to start

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.450 
tree and there might be known to start
with<00:04:39.509> but<00:04:39.689> you<00:04:39.810> can<00:04:39.930> leave<00:04:40.110> it<00:04:40.310> there<00:04:41.310> like

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
with but you can leave it there like

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.580 
with but you can leave it there like
knock<00:04:41.669> off<00:04:41.849> a<00:04:41.879> leaf<00:04:42.150> or<00:04:42.270> to<00:04:42.449> like<00:04:43.199> knock<00:04:43.379> off<00:04:43.560> a

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
knock off a leaf or to like knock off a
