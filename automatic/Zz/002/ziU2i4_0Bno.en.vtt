00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:35.950

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:12.599 
trickshotting with throwing knives but
when<00:01:11.619> I<00:01:11.649> wasn't<00:01:12.039> trickshotting<00:01:12.369> with<00:01:12.579> a

00:01:12.599 --> 00:01:12.609 
when I wasn't trickshotting with a

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:14.959 
when I wasn't trickshotting with a
throwing<00:01:12.880> knife<00:01:13.030> I<00:01:13.420> was<00:01:13.630> going<00:01:13.960> for<00:01:13.990> feeds<00:01:14.530> i

00:01:14.959 --> 00:01:14.969 
throwing knife I was going for feeds i

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:17.099 
throwing knife I was going for feeds i
literally<00:01:15.969> would<00:01:16.210> go<00:01:16.390> in<00:01:16.509> my<00:01:16.630> vault<00:01:16.840> and

00:01:17.099 --> 00:01:17.109 
literally would go in my vault and

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:19.109 
literally would go in my vault and
record<00:01:17.679> quick<00:01:18.009> scopes<00:01:18.369> because<00:01:18.850> i<00:01:18.939> thought

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:19.119 
record quick scopes because i thought

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:21.149 
record quick scopes because i thought
they<00:01:19.299> were<00:01:19.390> that<00:01:19.569> cool<00:01:19.810> i<00:01:20.109> would<00:01:20.649> think<00:01:20.859> if<00:01:21.039> i

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:21.159 
they were that cool i would think if i

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:23.069 
they were that cool i would think if i
ever<00:01:21.340> hit<00:01:21.579> a<00:01:21.609> shot<00:01:21.880> and<00:01:22.090> didn't<00:01:22.359> see<00:01:22.479> my<00:01:22.630> i

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:23.079

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460

good<00:01:36.999> but<00:01:37.270> for<00:01:37.539> back<00:01:37.719> and<00:01:37.929> back<00:01:38.289> in<00:01:38.439> the<00:01:38.530> day<00:01:38.679> I

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
good but for back and back in the day I

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.139 
good but for back and back in the day I
didn't<00:01:39.189> like<00:01:39.490> I<00:01:39.579> didn't<00:01:39.819> even<00:01:39.850> see<00:01:40.030> my

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:40.149 
didn't like I didn't even see my

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:41.520 
didn't like I didn't even see my
crosshairs<00:01:40.659> when<00:01:40.780> I<00:01:40.810> was<00:01:40.960> getting<00:01:41.049> his<00:01:41.289> skill

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
crosshairs when I was getting his skill

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.020 
crosshairs when I was getting his skill
so<00:01:41.679> i<00:01:41.740> think<00:01:41.979> was<00:01:42.100> pretty<00:01:42.399> good<00:01:42.549> i<00:01:42.579> think<00:01:42.880> i<00:01:42.909> got

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
so i think was pretty good i think i got

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.520 
so i think was pretty good i think i got
like<00:01:43.689> a<00:01:43.749> quad<00:01:44.170> and<00:01:44.439> a<00:01:44.530> split<00:01:44.950> five<00:01:45.189> man

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.020 

and<00:01:49.530> here's<00:01:49.770> a<00:01:49.830> clip<00:01:50.040> of<00:01:50.190> an<00:01:50.340> example<00:01:50.790> of<00:01:50.850> me

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
and here's a clip of an example of me

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.149 
and here's a clip of an example of me
doing<00:01:51.240> both<00:01:51.510> where<00:01:52.290> I<00:01:52.320> would<00:01:52.560> go<00:01:52.590> in<00:01:52.890> a<00:01:52.979> game

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
doing both where I would go in a game

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.760 
doing both where I would go in a game
and<00:01:53.460> get<00:01:53.670> quick<00:01:53.880> scopes<00:01:54.270> this<00:01:54.990> one<00:01:55.200> is<00:01:55.320> it's

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
and get quick scopes this one is it's

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.200 
and get quick scopes this one is it's
both<00:01:55.979> because<00:01:56.369> I<00:01:56.460> get<00:01:56.580> a<00:01:56.610> throw-in<00:01:56.820> not<00:01:57.030> kill

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
both because I get a throw-in not kill

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.160 
both because I get a throw-in not kill
right<00:01:57.300> here<00:01:57.450> where<00:01:57.630> he's<00:01:57.750> going<00:01:57.960> on<00:01:58.050> in<00:01:58.110> the

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
right here where he's going on in the

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.780 
right here where he's going on in the
corner<00:01:58.470> but<00:01:59.070> this<00:01:59.159> is<00:01:59.280> one<00:01:59.430> of<00:01:59.460> those<00:01:59.580> games

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
corner but this is one of those games

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.420 
corner but this is one of those games
where<00:02:00.000> I<00:02:00.150> would<00:02:00.420> go<00:02:00.659> and<00:02:01.260> record<00:02:01.619> go<00:02:02.040> back<00:02:02.250> and

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
where I would go and record go back and

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.430 
where I would go and record go back and
record<00:02:02.729> every<00:02:03.180> single<00:02:03.570> quickscope<00:02:04.110> i<00:02:04.229> got

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
record every single quickscope i got

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.410 
record every single quickscope i got
like<00:02:04.710> I<00:02:04.950> thought<00:02:05.490> it<00:02:05.550> was<00:02:05.759> beast<00:02:06.150> like<00:02:06.390> I

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
like I thought it was beast like I

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.969 
like I thought it was beast like I
thought<00:02:06.690> getting<00:02:07.050> a<00:02:07.170> quick<00:02:07.410> scope<00:02:07.619> like<00:02:07.770> this

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
thought getting a quick scope like this

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.249 
thought getting a quick scope like this
was<00:02:08.190> like<00:02:08.459> hitting<00:02:08.670> a<00:02:08.789> trick<00:02:09.090> shot<00:02:09.360> like

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
was like hitting a trick shot like

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.620 
was like hitting a trick shot like
therefore<00:02:10.740> look<00:02:11.009> at<00:02:11.100> this<00:02:11.220> I<00:02:11.610> get<00:02:12.090> a<00:02:12.209> hit<00:02:12.450> mark

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
therefore look at this I get a hit mark

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.229 
therefore look at this I get a hit mark
right<00:02:12.690> there<00:02:12.870> and<00:02:13.459> then<00:02:14.459> I<00:02:14.580> just<00:02:14.730> quick<00:02:15.000> scope

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
right there and then I just quick scope

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.600 
right there and then I just quick scope
to<00:02:15.390> school<00:02:15.690> ready<00:02:15.810> and<00:02:16.470> I<00:02:16.890> thought<00:02:17.130> that<00:02:17.459> was

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
to school ready and I thought that was

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.880 
to school ready and I thought that was
like<00:02:17.790> amazing<00:02:18.090> to<00:02:18.450> me<00:02:18.570> back<00:02:18.750> then<00:02:19.020> and<00:02:19.620> then<00:02:19.860> I

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
like amazing to me back then and then I

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:20.960 
like amazing to me back then and then I
get<00:02:20.040> a<00:02:20.070> quick<00:02:20.250> show<00:02:20.370> right<00:02:20.520> there<00:02:20.700> and<00:02:20.880> then

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
get a quick show right there and then

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.270 
get a quick show right there and then
okay<00:02:21.720> don't<00:02:21.989> even<00:02:22.200> get<00:02:22.290> me<00:02:22.350> started<00:02:22.470> on<00:02:22.860> how<00:02:23.070> be

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
okay don't even get me started on how be

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.710 
okay don't even get me started on how be
silent<00:02:23.820> shots<00:02:24.000> were<00:02:24.150> if<00:02:24.269> you<00:02:24.390> could<00:02:24.540> hit<00:02:24.660> a

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
silent shots were if you could hit a

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.870 
silent shots were if you could hit a
quick<00:02:25.320> scope<00:02:25.590> silent<00:02:26.040> shot<00:02:26.190> even<00:02:26.550> from<00:02:26.730> this

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
quick scope silent shot even from this

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.430 
quick scope silent shot even from this
close<00:02:27.120> you<00:02:27.930> were<00:02:28.050> just<00:02:28.200> so<00:02:28.560> good<00:02:30.170> and<00:02:31.170> then<00:02:31.350> I

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
close you were just so good and then I

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.520 
close you were just so good and then I
finish<00:02:31.800> it<00:02:31.890> off<00:02:32.010> with<00:02:32.040> just<00:02:32.580> two<00:02:32.790> quick<00:02:33.030> silks

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
finish it off with just two quick silks

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.720 
finish it off with just two quick silks
yeah<00:02:34.530> I<00:02:34.560> thought<00:02:34.769> that<00:02:34.890> was<00:02:34.980> amazing<00:02:35.340> back

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
yeah I thought that was amazing back

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.910 
yeah I thought that was amazing back
then<00:02:35.910> my<00:02:36.060> Sanders<00:02:36.480> have<00:02:36.630> really<00:02:37.080> risen<00:02:37.260> a<00:02:37.620> lot

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
then my Sanders have really risen a lot

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.729 
then my Sanders have really risen a lot
from<00:02:38.489> then<00:02:38.640> now<00:02:38.880> I<00:02:38.910> go<00:02:39.209> for<00:02:39.420> like<00:02:39.560> shots<00:02:40.560> that

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
from then now I go for like shots that

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:44.720 
from then now I go for like shots that
are<00:02:40.769> so<00:02:41.010> hard<00:02:41.280> to<00:02:41.340> hit<00:02:41.600> its<00:02:42.600> ironic<00:02:42.900> really<00:02:43.730> and

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
are so hard to hit its ironic really and

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.570 
are so hard to hit its ironic really and
also<00:02:44.910> right<00:02:45.450> here<00:02:45.720> even<00:02:46.500> back<00:02:46.709> then<00:02:46.739> I<00:02:47.430> was

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
also right here even back then I was

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.310 
also right here even back then I was
getting<00:02:47.850> hit<00:02:48.030> markers<00:02:48.360> well<00:02:48.600> that's<00:02:48.780> that

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
getting hit markers well that's that

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.690 
getting hit markers well that's that
that<00:02:49.680> makes<00:02:49.860> sense<00:02:49.980> that<00:02:50.220> that's<00:02:50.280> a<00:02:50.459> hitmarker

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
that makes sense that that's a hitmarker

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.850 
that makes sense that that's a hitmarker
as<00:02:51.000> I<00:02:51.060> shudder<00:02:51.269> through<00:02:51.329> the<00:02:51.540> plane<00:02:51.780> but<00:02:52.620> even

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
as I shudder through the plane but even

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.069 
as I shudder through the plane but even
back<00:02:53.130> then<00:02:53.190> I<00:02:53.400> I<00:02:53.579> saved<00:02:54.180> I<00:02:54.269> think<00:02:54.480> three<00:02:54.810> clips

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:55.079 
back then I I saved I think three clips

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:56.300 
back then I I saved I think three clips
in<00:02:55.170> my<00:02:55.200> vault<00:02:55.440> where<00:02:55.680> I<00:02:55.709> was<00:02:55.860> complaining

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
in my vault where I was complaining

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.880 
in my vault where I was complaining
about<00:02:56.340> hit<00:02:56.640> markers<00:02:57.000> so<00:02:57.959> even<00:02:58.260> back<00:02:58.410> then<00:02:58.470> hit

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
about hit markers so even back then hit

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.830 
about hit markers so even back then hit
markers<00:02:59.220> they<00:02:59.670> were<00:03:00.150> giving<00:03:00.390> me<00:03:00.480> a<00:03:00.510> problem

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
markers they were giving me a problem

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.000 
markers they were giving me a problem
they<00:03:00.930> always<00:03:01.230> have<00:03:01.410> but<00:03:01.590> probably<00:03:01.860> always

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
they always have but probably always

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.600 
they always have but probably always
