00:00:08.609 --> 00:00:12.159
 in the late afternoon on the Nürburgring in the West German Eifel 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.550
 meanwhile the driver's side and four hours are on the racetrack 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.550
 on road 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.310
 one of them is Sebastian Dieckmann 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.230
 so far is hardly feasible so wonderful surface 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.010
 not so hot anymore 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.690
 fewer people on the track 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.540
 the warning signs word 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.760
 in front of him it was a good test 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.510
 all year long what they do when I take over our preferences 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.020
 around with the will of the children 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.870
 the award ceremony 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.350
 that required 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.630
 how big is their team before the race where normally not without 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.110
 Basic formula-1 cars take care of the cyclists themselves 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.980
 For three of the four riders of the team from the Rhineland, the 24-hour race is 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.980
 a premiere 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.060
 just before the start 40 was the first one ever 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:19.170
 In total, nearly 5000 cyclists are either in the team or as lone fighters 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.360
 none of the drivers were professional athletes 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.300
 Bernhard 2003 started with which the cyclist could not do anything 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.260
 Batzen 24-hour race 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.030
 and that can be fun in the 24-hour race can be fascinating 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.640
 that one is another challenge of the outer wall so to speak of 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.900
 Cyclists and driveway foul gone 9 percent the more less in Nero 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.680
 Dwarfs is Andy and number of participants is also up 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.990
 gone 50 to 9 as high as never before 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.580
 Holger Cremers at the start 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.550
 on time at 13 clock it starts 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.300
 as usual, it is almost 26 kilometers long and they have it all 

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:11.089
 Gradients of 17 percent 

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:17.309
 Bohn top speeds of almost 100 kilometers per hour 

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:21.319
 after each round is changed 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:25.430
 In doing so, a small transmitter needs to be swapped, we ourselves down and the time 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.430
 allows 

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:32.869
 nice run great route 

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:34.909
 even the usual one 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:37.789
 since the first two laps where so many riders are still together 

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:40.329
 logically followed 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:43.419
 Furthermore, I told me but to Klein advised 

00:02:44.679 --> 00:02:46.299
 Jürgen 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:49.009
 the box has turned into a night camp for him 

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:52.319
 the race has been running for 16 hours 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.769
 while they are gathering strength 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:59.109
 the others on the way are Holger Cremers Regina sixth 

00:02:59.109 --> 00:02:59.829
 round 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:01.979
 hardly slower than the first time 

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:06.059
 He needs about 50 minutes with an average speed of 32 

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:09.059
 Kilometers per hour 

00:03:10.279 --> 00:03:12.989
 Thousands of red shirts on the track 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.459
 the star in the list 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:19.539
 it's true it's true I think it's hard he could not get off the table 

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:22.539
 After Landis was a little to herself 

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:26.219
 6 pm on the second day 

00:03:26.219 --> 00:03:29.219
 the race lasts another three hours 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:35.609
 in the end whoever wins the most laps will win 

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:41.469
 Actually, the team spirit is the team 

00:03:41.469 --> 00:03:44.989
 to bring about 24 hours of performance no one believes 

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:49.679
 the whole thing the feeling that sour feeling many soloist country 

00:03:49.679 --> 00:03:52.809
 On the way it is only consistent if that is the case 

00:03:52.809 --> 00:03:55.009
 got off so big shoes 

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:58.009
 "You can not explain that 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:02.599
 after 24 hours the drivers are at the finish 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:11.549
 and have the circuit circulated 24 times together makes more than 600 kilometers 

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:20.909
 Entega Altis in the year does not matter anything good 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.500
 Better Place in the Eifel meanwhile turns «Lola runs» October more 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.500
 when everything works 

00:04:29.249 --> 00:04:32.249
 proud coach there place until the satellite 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.330
 trier 

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:40.069
 the award ceremonies 

00:04:40.069 --> 00:04:44.899
 the best four-team comes from Great Britain in the 24 hours 31 

00:04:44.899 --> 00:04:46.469
 Rounds done 

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:50.840
 Erfurt 200 kilometers more than Holger Sebastian and the other two 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.240
 they are still satisfied
