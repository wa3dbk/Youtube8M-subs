muscular strength to lift the weight it

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.130 
muscular strength to lift the weight it
also<00:00:50.460> involves<00:00:51.120> strength<00:00:51.600> training<00:00:51.930> when

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
also involves strength training when

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.540 
also involves strength training when
you're<00:00:52.260> lowering<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:53.039> weight<00:00:53.070> under<00:00:53.460> control

you're lowering the weight under control

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.970 
you're lowering the weight under control
that's<00:00:54.180> called<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.629> e<00:00:54.660> center<00:00:55.110> or<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.680> negative

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
that's called the e center or a negative

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.130 
that's called the e center or a negative
phase<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:56.789> if<00:00:57.120> we<00:00:57.149> add<00:00:57.390> that<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:57.930> positive

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
phase and if we add that to the positive

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.500 
phase and if we add that to the positive
phase<00:00:58.620> we<00:00:59.129> can<00:00:59.340> double<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.879> efficiency<00:01:00.480> of

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
phase we can double the efficiency of

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.720 
phase we can double the efficiency of
our<00:01:00.690> limping<00:01:01.079> time<00:01:01.289> which<00:01:02.070> brings<00:01:02.340> us<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:02.489> the

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
our limping time which brings us to the

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.549 
our limping time which brings us to the
third<00:01:02.760> principle<00:01:03.149> when<00:01:03.809> you<00:01:03.989> lift<00:01:04.379> the

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
third principle when you lift the

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.859 
third principle when you lift the
resistance<00:01:05.129> make<00:01:05.610> sure<00:01:05.640> you<00:01:05.970> always<00:01:06.240> lift<00:01:06.720> the

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
resistance make sure you always lift the

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.440 
resistance make sure you always lift the
weight<00:01:07.049> under<00:01:07.320> control<00:01:07.439> so<00:01:08.400> if<00:01:08.670> we<00:01:08.909> lift<00:01:09.299> the

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
weight under control so if we lift the

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.270 
weight under control so if we lift the
weight<00:01:09.630> in<00:01:09.810> about<00:01:10.049> one<00:01:10.290> to<00:01:10.439> two<00:01:10.470> seconds<00:01:11.159> and

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
weight in about one to two seconds and

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.490 
weight in about one to two seconds and
pause<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:11.880> then<00:01:12.210> lower<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.840> weight<00:01:13.020> in<00:01:13.260> about

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
pause and then lower the weight in about

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.160 
pause and then lower the weight in about
three<00:01:13.860> or<00:01:13.890> four<00:01:14.070> seconds<00:01:14.850> we<00:01:15.270> now<00:01:15.509> have<00:01:15.810> four

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
three or four seconds we now have four

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.170 
three or four seconds we now have four
to<00:01:16.350> six<00:01:16.619> seconds<00:01:17.070> of<00:01:17.220> under<00:01:17.729> interrupted

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
to six seconds of under interrupted

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.120 
to six seconds of under interrupted
contraction<00:01:18.780> time<00:01:18.990> for<00:01:19.590> each<00:01:19.830> repetition

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
contraction time for each repetition

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.399 
contraction time for each repetition
that<00:01:20.580> we<00:01:20.790> do<00:01:20.970> and<00:01:21.210> what<00:01:21.780> I<00:01:21.810> go<00:01:22.110> over<00:01:22.229> the

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
that we do and what I go over the

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.590 
that we do and what I go over the
repetition<00:01:23.130> ranges<00:01:23.520> you'll<00:01:23.670> see<00:01:23.880> that<00:01:24.299> allows

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
repetition ranges you'll see that allows

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.570 
repetition ranges you'll see that allows
us<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:24.960> do<00:01:25.080> a<00:01:25.110> lot<00:01:25.380> more<00:01:25.409> work<00:01:25.860> it's<00:01:26.220> a<00:01:26.340> little

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
us to do a lot more work it's a little

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.340 
us to do a lot more work it's a little
bit<00:01:26.670> more<00:01:26.820> concentrated<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:27.720> allows<00:01:27.960> us<00:01:28.229> to

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
bit more concentrated and allows us to

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.840 
bit more concentrated and allows us to
get<00:01:28.500> through<00:01:28.680> a<00:01:28.710> workout<00:01:28.950> a<00:01:29.220> little<00:01:29.490> bit<00:01:29.640> more

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
get through a workout a little bit more

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.270 
get through a workout a little bit more
quickly<00:01:30.150> and<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.960> final<00:01:31.229> principle<00:01:31.770> is<00:01:32.040> I

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.010 
complete nine repetitions with good form
and<00:01:58.320> Pharaoh<00:01:59.130> number<00:01:59.670> ten<00:01:59.939> that<00:02:00.600> means<00:02:00.930> that

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
and Pharaoh number ten that means that

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.080 
and Pharaoh number ten that means that
nine<00:02:01.439> is<00:02:01.740> your<00:02:01.950> number<00:02:02.310> for<00:02:02.490> that<00:02:02.640> day<00:02:02.850> and

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
nine is your number for that day and

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.030 
nine is your number for that day and
will<00:02:03.390> even<00:02:03.689> show<00:02:03.719> you<00:02:03.960> how<00:02:04.200> to<00:02:04.259> record<00:02:04.649> that<00:02:04.860> on

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
will even show you how to record that on

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.980 
will even show you how to record that on
the<00:02:05.159> car<00:02:05.369> so<00:02:05.880> we'll<00:02:06.030> know<00:02:06.149> exactly<00:02:06.299> how

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
the car so we'll know exactly how

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.809 
the car so we'll know exactly how
resistance<00:02:07.439> you<00:02:07.530> did<00:02:07.740> exactly<00:02:08.640> how<00:02:08.759> many

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
resistance you did exactly how many

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.150 
resistance you did exactly how many
repetitions<00:02:09.179> it<00:02:09.690> took<00:02:09.869> so<00:02:10.349> if<00:02:10.500> you<00:02:10.619> did<00:02:10.890> nine

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
repetitions it took so if you did nine

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.220 
repetitions it took so if you did nine
repetitions<00:02:11.940> on<00:02:12.180> that<00:02:12.360> particular<00:02:12.540> work<00:02:13.050> out

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
repetitions on that particular work out

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.229 
repetitions on that particular work out
we're<00:02:13.800> going<00:02:13.920> to<00:02:14.010> come<00:02:14.370> back<00:02:14.400> to<00:02:14.580> our<00:02:14.819> workout

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
we're going to come back to our workout

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.479 
we're going to come back to our workout
at<00:02:15.360> about<00:02:15.599> 48<00:02:16.050> to<00:02:16.170> 72<00:02:16.440> hours<00:02:16.680> and<00:02:17.160> our<00:02:17.459> goal

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
at about 48 to 72 hours and our goal

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:19.100 
at about 48 to 72 hours and our goal
will<00:02:17.910> now<00:02:18.030> be<00:02:18.239> that<00:02:18.450> same<00:02:18.750> amount<00:02:19.050> of

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
will now be that same amount of

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.199 
will now be that same amount of
resistance<00:02:19.410> for<00:02:20.010> maybe<00:02:20.190> 10<00:02:20.489> or<00:02:20.760> 11

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.300 
resistance for maybe 10 or 11
repetitions<00:02:21.900> and<00:02:22.050> that<00:02:22.380> way<00:02:22.560> each<00:02:22.860> time<00:02:22.890> we

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
repetitions and that way each time we

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.100 
repetitions and that way each time we
lift<00:02:23.640> we<00:02:24.000> have<00:02:24.150> a<00:02:24.180> goal<00:02:24.450> that<00:02:24.480> we<00:02:24.750> can<00:02:24.900> reach

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
lift we have a goal that we can reach

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.690 
lift we have a goal that we can reach
either<00:02:25.319> by<00:02:25.560> increasing<00:02:26.160> the<00:02:26.250> waist<00:02:26.459> lightly

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700

either by increasing the waist lightly
or<00:02:27.000> increasing<00:02:27.750> the<00:02:27.840> number<00:02:28.050> of<00:02:28.110> repetitions

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
or increasing the number of repetitions

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.949 
or increasing the number of repetitions
that<00:02:28.800> we<00:02:28.890> do<00:02:29.069> now<00:02:29.670> some<00:02:29.970> of<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.120> variables<00:02:30.450> the

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
that we do now some of the variables the

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.020 
that we do now some of the variables the
most<00:02:31.170> important<00:02:31.590> one<00:02:31.739> is<00:02:31.769> we<00:02:32.310> want<00:02:32.550> to<00:02:32.640> live<00:02:32.790> on
