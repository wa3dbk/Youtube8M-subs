00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 good morning everyone is fabrizio 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:08.309
 bertuzzi welcome to heading one 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:11.759
 answer for you sportsman during 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.320
 which we try to investigate those 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.599
 which are the new football tables 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.310
 international and luca had made me one 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.109
 interesting question about what it was 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.750
 success in the South American sub20 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.180
 we had been swept up in Colombia 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.340
 easy prophets, in fact, a month before two 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.230
 spy on the tournament he had sent some 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.300
 pill on the new promises of football 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.790
 Colombian in fact that tournament a year 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.020
 dominated but not because we are current 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.200
 because we watch the championships 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.629
 international and honestly between brian 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.890
 for ea sebastian fares quintero that 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:45.480
 we already know in the fishery what 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.379
 seems close to bologna in the central 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.870
 vergara that seems to be in orbit milan e 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.989
 the cordoba striker that absolutely 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.030
 a player to keep on top because one 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.649
 in short, a stronger player 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.350
 other 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.270
 it was hard to go wrong though if I owe you 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.479
 tell the truth struck me 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.760
 a lot and for a peru that is one 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.010
 reality that is emerging in the 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.580
 recent years has already highlighted 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:17.009
 great soccer players on the planet in 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.860
 planet international routes we think 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.509
 has already lost a farfan 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.470
 let's think about the new wings that are 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.570
 coming out 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.820
 in a while we will hear about Andre 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.340
 carrillo who is struggling a bit the 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.400
 sporting lisbon but is a great talent 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.630
 another wing came out a lot 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.680
 interesting called luis 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:40.049
 advincula year the venabile that is a 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.060
 21-year-old player 22 a striker 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.510
 that recalls a bit aguero in short they have 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.490
 so many players 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.680
 very very very interesting 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.630
 but what I owe has struck me 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:53.230
 it really is the new generation i'm 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:55.210
 speaking of 103 93 94 they put in 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:57.720
 serious ambassador in the South American tournament 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.580
 sub 20 in argentine nations 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:03.280
 institutionalized like Brazil 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.900
 causing its elimination and then the 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.420
 failure to participate in the next 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.369
 under-20 worldwide under 20 who 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.690
 will see the absence of two queens 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.680
 brazil argentina because they are there 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:18.400
 new point realities that are advancing 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:21.160
 I was struck by a player who remembers 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.020
 so much the fact of being such a scout does it 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.630
 also to say unbalanced because to say that 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.280
 one is good when it is already stated they are 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.930
 able all need a little take of 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.400
 risks well me with this guy 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.890
 I willingly take this is the central 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.410
 defensive of the 94 and 904 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.330
 it's called micaela rauco in my opinion is 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.840
 was the strongest central defender of 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:43.150
 this tournament clearly and with movements 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:47.380
 a little to thiago silva then to da 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:49.720
 shot immediately and alpha of the advance and the 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.660
 its best quality of cognition 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.250
 tactic to the second so he knows 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.560
 always moving 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.540
 I don't know if by intuition or because it is 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.489
 intelligent that makes the striker of 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.830
 head and mutual fort campbell pidino 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:04.570
 so much so that it can play both centrally 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.550
 defensive that right side is really 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.140
 this for this capacity also of 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:11.080
 progression I'm this girl 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:15.060
 that of the 94 has already done more than 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:19.940
 twenty-five appearances in his team 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:22.730
 Peruvian sport the hull and 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:25.450
 in short, it has everything to become a great man 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:29.450
 talent of world football 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:34.070
 the non-statuary height that is why 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:36.790
 will be a 83 euro 84 maybe no more than the 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:38.930
 compensates for a detachment with an elevation 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:43.940
 very remarkable a great time choice 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:45.920
 that is, michele naoko is from 1994 in Peru 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.540
 not for nothing has been evaluated 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:51.230
 best middle of the tournament just for 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:53.240
 this sum of positive factors than if 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.040
 will find a good educator a good one 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:56.960
 coach maybe in italy in europe 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.810
 in short, these are the players 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:01.100
 although extra communitarian it is worthwhile 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:04.910
 invest on which is worth investing 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:07.760
 because surely this improves has 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:10.580
 many qualities will perhaps specialize in 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.910
 something good though 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:15.470
 next to these guys in the front field 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:18.049
 a player of the past 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:21.440
 he calls a 93 a bigger year 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:23.450
 it is called rafael will look at a guy who 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.470
 play central steering wheel like 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:27.620
 they say in south america 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:30.130
 the central midfielder but to this 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:33.669
 Brazilian steering wheel not a steering wheel 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:36.470
 South American selected ie what 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:39.830
 the number 5 had a death in Brazil 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:43.490
 networks with the paul roberto falcao boy 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:47.360
 very good remember as for his 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:49.700
 ability to relate head-on to the 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:53.030
 first giannini here I turn to one 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:54.510
 generation a little more mature if you 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:57.090
 you will remember Giannini 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:58.920
 rome the prince for his elegance 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:00.690
 here is this is the firewire from the nas ha 

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:02.340
 an innate elegance just but not 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:06.540
 sickly end in itself and its own 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:10.770
 because beyond this capacity 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:13.710
 congenital to play with the face in front of the 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:16.530
 no to get the 180 degree overview 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:18.240
 of what happens to him in front is one 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:20.070
 very interesting thing indeed a lot 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:23.880
 good in one two a nice left-handed handsome 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:25.740
 launch also takes risks comes from 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.420
 defenders and lose you get caught do 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:29.100
 giving the ball claims to start the action 

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:30.710
 so I guess he also has one 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:33.450
 certain personality 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:36.840
 the problem with this girl difference 

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:38.760
 of aarau como that already viewed by 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:42.000
 city observers 

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:43.470
 I know there was an emissary of the city at the 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.360
 suv land its to see a for 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:47.700
 will look so it doesn't come with two 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:50.340
 change this no, however, to use 

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:53.040
 this term a little simple because 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:55.260
 there is indeed someone important 

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:57.390
 looking at it but maybe it does n't 

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:59.010
 nothing and could even come from 

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:00.720
 our parts and whoever takes it 

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:02.760
 definitely an investment though 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:04.590
 very important because we have to order 

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:06.270
 that that role no longer exists except you 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:07.950
 who continue to play great 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:10.080
 player like pirlo and pizarro 

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:10.920
 precisely because those are priceless 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.580
 players who have those 

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:13.890
 features 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:16.380
 here with these two future I hope 

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:18.480
 pearls of world football ie jail 

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:21.300
 it will be necessary to do rappers will look sa2 

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:23.310
 let's try one of the 94 and one in the 93 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:25.740
 we concluded today a pill 

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:27.800
 answer for you fabrizio bertuzzi guerin
