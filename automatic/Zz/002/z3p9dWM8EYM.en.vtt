00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
skip cast where you just try to a low

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.370 
skip cast where you just try to a low
trajectory<00:01:41.460> so<00:01:42.329> you<00:01:42.390> don't<00:01:42.570> lob<00:01:42.780> it<00:01:43.049> you<00:01:43.259> don't

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
trajectory so you don't lob it you don't

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.410 
trajectory so you don't lob it you don't
want<00:01:43.500> to<00:01:43.590> love<00:01:43.710> it<00:01:43.920> you<00:01:43.979> want<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:44.220> chop<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:45.090> snap

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
want to love it you want to chop to snap

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.510 
want to love it you want to chop to snap
the<00:01:45.689> lure<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:46.200> it<00:01:46.320> says<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.590> skip<00:01:47.009> up<00:01:47.189> toward

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
the lure and it says a skip up toward

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.550 
the lure and it says a skip up toward
the<00:01:47.579> mangroves

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.650 

now<00:01:53.560> it's<00:01:53.740> just<00:01:53.800> a<00:01:53.980> waiting<00:01:54.160> game<00:01:54.370> it<00:01:55.330> was<00:01:55.450> hard

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:55.660 
now it's just a waiting game it was hard

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.360 
now it's just a waiting game it was hard
for<00:01:55.720> me<00:01:55.900> since<00:01:56.170> I<00:01:56.230> almost<00:01:56.410> always<00:01:56.650> work<00:01:56.980> lures

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:57.370 
for me since I almost always work lures

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.160 
for me since I almost always work lures
just<00:01:57.760> to<00:01:57.820> let<00:01:57.970> the<00:01:58.150> bait<00:01:58.360> sit<00:01:58.630> on<00:01:58.720> the<00:01:58.840> bottom

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
just to let the bait sit on the bottom

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.260 
just to let the bait sit on the bottom
but<00:01:59.950> it<00:02:00.040> was<00:02:00.130> logical<00:02:00.640> since<00:02:00.850> we<00:02:00.970> were<00:02:01.060> going

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
but it was logical since we were going

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
but it was logical since we were going
after<00:02:01.420> redfish

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.290 
after redfish

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.680 
after redfish
now<00:02:02.620> redfish<00:02:03.130> are<00:02:03.310> sort<00:02:03.940> of<00:02:04.030> designed<00:02:04.450> to<00:02:04.600> be

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.690 
now redfish are sort of designed to be

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.500 
now redfish are sort of designed to be
bottom<00:02:05.080> feeders<00:02:05.700> mouthface<00:02:06.700> is<00:02:06.910> down<00:02:07.120> it<00:02:07.420> gets

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:07.510 
bottom feeders mouthface is down it gets

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:09.180 
bottom feeders mouthface is down it gets
a<00:02:07.660> pretty<00:02:07.810> good<00:02:07.930> sentence<00:02:08.470> they<00:02:08.649> got<00:02:08.890> a<00:02:08.920> good

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
a pretty good sentence they got a good
