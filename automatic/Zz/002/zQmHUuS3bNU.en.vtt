00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:31.310 
and movement and it feels very soft to

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:37.480 
and movement and it feels very soft to
the<00:00:31.460> touch<00:00:32.320> now<00:00:34.090> not<00:00:35.090> so<00:00:35.600> much<00:00:35.800> shine<00:00:36.800> at<00:00:37.280> the

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:37.490 
the touch now not so much shine at the

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.630 
the touch now not so much shine at the
bottom<00:00:38.060> but<00:00:38.450> at<00:00:38.660> the<00:00:38.870> top<00:00:39.170> it<00:00:39.440> still<00:00:39.860> has<00:00:40.160> shine

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640 
bottom but at the top it still has shine

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.570 
bottom but at the top it still has shine
it<00:00:41.270> doesn't<00:00:41.960> move<00:00:42.230> as<00:00:42.620> much<00:00:42.860> as<00:00:43.040> it<00:00:43.190> did<00:00:43.340> before

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:43.580 
it doesn't move as much as it did before

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.450 
it doesn't move as much as it did before
and<00:00:44.210> the<00:00:44.840> end<00:00:45.140> maybe<00:00:45.860> because<00:00:46.100> they're

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
and the end maybe because they're

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.460 
and the end maybe because they're
lighter<00:00:46.760> or<00:00:47.150> maybe<00:00:47.540> it's<00:00:47.750> just<00:00:47.810> because<00:00:48.080> the

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:48.470 
lighter or maybe it's just because the

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:54.040 
lighter or maybe it's just because the
end<00:00:48.710> is<00:00:49.250> a<00:00:49.970> little<00:00:50.600> bit<00:00:50.780> freezing<00:00:52.270> and<00:00:53.270> you<00:00:53.870> can

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
end is a little bit freezing and you can

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.740 
end is a little bit freezing and you can
see<00:00:54.200> right<00:00:54.230> here<00:00:54.770> and<00:00:55.430> so<00:00:56.150> I'm<00:00:56.270> going<00:00:56.480> to<00:00:56.570> see

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
see right here and so I'm going to see

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.660 
see right here and so I'm going to see
what<00:00:57.020> I<00:00:57.050> can<00:00:57.170> do<00:00:57.500> about<00:00:57.530> that<00:00:57.800> I<00:00:58.040> might<00:00:58.370> try<00:00:58.550> and

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
what I can do about that I might try and

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.020 
what I can do about that I might try and
trim<00:00:59.030> it<00:00:59.240> maybe<00:01:00.200> put<00:01:00.530> some<00:01:00.560> heat<00:01:01.130> to<00:01:01.160> it<00:01:01.400> too

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
trim it maybe put some heat to it too

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.350 
trim it maybe put some heat to it too
and<00:01:02.420> straighten<00:01:02.930> it<00:01:03.020> and<00:01:03.200> see<00:01:03.530> if<00:01:03.680> that<00:01:03.740> works

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
and straighten it and see if that works

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.969 
and straighten it and see if that works
to<00:01:05.360> get<00:01:05.600> some<00:01:05.780> of<00:01:05.810> the<00:01:05.930> frizziness<00:01:06.320> out<00:01:06.590> of<00:01:06.770> it

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
to get some of the frizziness out of it

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:09.580 
to get some of the frizziness out of it
and<00:01:07.159> get<00:01:07.369> some<00:01:07.549> more<00:01:07.670> movement<00:01:08.149> back<00:01:08.329> so<00:01:09.109> I'm

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
and get some more movement back so I'm

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.580 
and get some more movement back so I'm
going<00:01:09.770> to<00:01:09.799> try<00:01:10.039> and<00:01:10.070> keep<00:01:10.340> it<00:01:10.579> maybe<00:01:11.590> three

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
going to try and keep it maybe three

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.940 
going to try and keep it maybe three
weeks<00:01:12.619> and<00:01:13.539> we'll<00:01:14.539> see<00:01:14.780> what<00:01:15.109> happens<00:01:15.229> in<00:01:15.649> so

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
weeks and we'll see what happens in so

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.029 
weeks and we'll see what happens in so
right<00:01:16.189> now<00:01:16.219> we're<00:01:16.520> at<00:01:16.549> one<00:01:16.939> and<00:01:17.030> a<00:01:17.119> half<00:01:17.149> weeks

00:01:18.029 --> 00:01:18.039

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
my hands through right now I get like a

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.569 
my hands through right now I get like a
big<00:01:42.109> glob<00:01:42.289> of<00:01:42.350> hair<00:01:42.710> because<00:01:43.069> I<00:01:43.369> don't<00:01:43.549> have

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:43.579 
big glob of hair because I don't have

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:46.480 
big glob of hair because I don't have
that<00:01:43.969> it's<00:01:44.240> not<00:01:45.049> at<00:01:45.740> all<00:01:46.039> right<00:01:46.310> now

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
that it's not at all right now

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.480 
that it's not at all right now
so<00:01:47.299> I<00:01:47.329> was<00:01:47.840> saving<00:01:48.439> because<00:01:48.530> of<00:01:48.829> shading<00:01:49.249> it

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
so I was saving because of shading it

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.959 
so I was saving because of shading it
gets<00:01:49.729> the<00:01:49.939> Eclipse<00:01:50.509> for<00:01:50.749> shading<00:01:51.700> dangling<00:01:52.700> on

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:52.969 
gets the Eclipse for shading dangling on

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:58.840 
gets the Eclipse for shading dangling on
the<00:01:53.030> end<00:01:53.569> it<00:01:54.639> does<00:01:55.639> tangle<00:01:56.299> in<00:01:56.509> at<00:01:57.319> about<00:01:57.920> five

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
the end it does tangle in at about five

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.209 
the end it does tangle in at about five
days<00:01:59.209> I<00:01:59.630> started<00:02:00.139> experiencing<00:02:00.829> some

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:01.219 
days I started experiencing some

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:04.029 
days I started experiencing some
tangling<00:02:01.759> at<00:02:02.029> the<00:02:02.719> nape<00:02:02.959> it<00:02:03.350> wasn't<00:02:03.889> anything

00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:04.039 
tangling at the nape it wasn't anything

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:06.279 
tangling at the nape it wasn't anything
to<00:02:04.340> extremes<00:02:04.789> i<00:02:04.999> was<00:02:05.149> just<00:02:05.359> make<00:02:05.869> sure<00:02:06.109> you

00:02:06.279 --> 00:02:06.289 
to extremes i was just make sure you

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:08.199 
to extremes i was just make sure you
keep<00:02:06.499> brushing<00:02:07.219> it<00:02:07.549> and<00:02:07.759> that's<00:02:07.999> to<00:02:08.179> be

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
keep brushing it and that's to be

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
thinking about repurchasing it just for

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.270 
thinking about repurchasing it just for
the<00:03:48.990> simple<00:03:49.290> fact<00:03:49.320> that<00:03:49.560> i<00:03:49.740> like<00:03:49.980> to<00:03:50.100> keep

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
the simple fact that i like to keep

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.550 
the simple fact that i like to keep
hairstyles<00:03:50.970> longer<00:03:51.750> than<00:03:51.900> two<00:03:52.110> three<00:03:52.320> weeks

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
hairstyles longer than two three weeks

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.710 
hairstyles longer than two three weeks
but<00:03:52.920> that's<00:03:53.310> just<00:03:54.060> my<00:03:54.480> preference<00:03:56.330> about<00:03:57.330> the

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
but that's just my preference about the

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.110 
but that's just my preference about the
closure<00:03:58.290> i<00:03:58.740> would<00:03:58.980> say<00:03:59.160> that<00:03:59.400> is<00:03:59.550> holding<00:03:59.940> up

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
closure i would say that is holding up

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.870 
closure i would say that is holding up
pretty<00:04:00.840> darn<00:04:01.140> well<00:04:01.590> it<00:04:02.370> I<00:04:02.940> don't<00:04:03.330> get<00:04:03.660> much<00:04:03.959> any

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
it doesn't look like it's any thinner

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.310 
it doesn't look like it's any thinner
than<00:04:14.160> when<00:04:14.310> i<00:04:14.340> first<00:04:14.700> got<00:04:14.850> it<00:04:15.240> the<00:04:16.020> closure

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
purchased the hair I will probably just

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.350 
purchased the hair I will probably just
take<00:04:27.000> this<00:04:27.510> closure<00:04:27.780> since<00:04:28.200> I<00:04:28.350> sewed<00:04:28.590> it<00:04:28.770> down

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360
