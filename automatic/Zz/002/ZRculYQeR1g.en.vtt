00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:53.379 
play 5 over 4 other than the fact that

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:55.020 
play 5 over 4 other than the fact that
it<00:00:53.530> looks<00:00:53.769> nicer<00:00:54.190> and<00:00:54.339> its<00:00:54.489> relative<00:00:54.789> more

it looks nicer and its relative more
relevant<00:00:55.480> than<00:00:55.660> Forza<00:00:56.350> 4<00:00:56.530> is<00:00:57.390> of<00:00:58.390> course<00:00:58.570> a<00:00:58.719> 4

00:00:58.889 --> 00:00:58.899

on the other hand you know it's a lot
more<00:01:01.539> fun<00:01:01.929> for<00:01:02.230> me<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:03.550> physics<00:01:03.969> aren't<00:01:04.239> as

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:04.330 
more fun for me the physics aren't as

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.290 
more fun for me the physics aren't as
daunting<00:01:04.750> and<00:01:05.140> unpredictable<00:01:05.890> and<00:01:06.070> stupid<00:01:06.520> I

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:07.300 
daunting and unpredictable and stupid I

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.660 
daunting and unpredictable and stupid I
mean<00:01:08.020> all<00:01:08.290> people<00:01:08.680> play<00:01:08.770> forza<00:01:09.070> 5<00:01:09.220> may<00:01:09.400> be<00:01:09.460> like

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
mean all people play forza 5 may be like

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.300 
mean all people play forza 5 may be like
throwing<00:01:10.300> rocks<00:01:11.260> at<00:01:11.470> me<00:01:11.590> right<00:01:11.740> now<00:01:11.770> saying<00:01:12.160> oh

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
throwing rocks at me right now saying oh

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.150 
throwing rocks at me right now saying oh
if<00:01:12.460> physics<00:01:12.880> are<00:01:13.060> much<00:01:13.240> better<00:01:13.480> for<00:01:14.160> racing

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:15.160 
if physics are much better for racing

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.770 
if physics are much better for racing
yeah<00:01:15.370> for<00:01:15.700> drifting<00:01:16.030> they<00:01:16.180> make<00:01:16.360> absolutely

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
yeah for drifting they make absolutely

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.090 
yeah for drifting they make absolutely
no<00:01:16.870> sense<00:01:17.140> I've<00:01:17.470> played<00:01:17.710> like<00:01:19.680> drift<00:01:20.680> games

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
no sense I've played like drift games

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.220 
no sense I've played like drift games
like<00:01:21.490> like<00:01:21.850> actual<00:01:22.390> drift<00:01:22.660> games<00:01:22.810> like<00:01:22.930> I<00:01:23.020> said

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:23.230 
like like actual drift games like I said

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:25.590 
like like actual drift games like I said
of<00:01:23.320> course<00:01:23.470> I've<00:01:23.860> played<00:01:24.850> I<00:01:24.880> racing<00:01:25.390> and<00:01:25.570> I

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
of course I've played I racing and I

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.120 
of course I've played I racing and I
know<00:01:25.660> how<00:01:25.870> would<00:01:26.050> what<00:01:26.260> drifting<00:01:26.650> feels<00:01:26.890> like

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
know how would what drifting feels like

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.510 
know how would what drifting feels like
in<00:01:28.060> a<00:01:28.150> real<00:01:28.300> car<00:01:28.630> and<00:01:28.930> that's<00:01:29.590> not<00:01:29.740> it<00:01:29.950> it's

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
in a real car and that's not it it's

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.450 
in a real car and that's not it it's
just<00:01:30.790> overly<00:01:31.150> twitchy<00:01:31.450> and<00:01:31.660> stupid<00:01:32.080> and

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
just overly twitchy and stupid and

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.420 
just overly twitchy and stupid and
absolutely<00:01:33.460> drives<00:01:33.700> me<00:01:33.820> up<00:01:33.850> the<00:01:34.000> wall<00:01:35.430> you

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.430 
absolutely drives me up the wall you

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.040 
absolutely drives me up the wall you
know<00:01:36.490> again<00:01:36.700> the<00:01:36.760> car<00:01:36.970> slip<00:01:37.210> across<00:01:37.420> the<00:01:37.900> car

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.050 
know again the car slip across the car

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.950 
know again the car slip across the car
like<00:01:38.320> cross<00:01:38.830> elections<00:01:39.160> a<00:01:39.220> lot<00:01:39.340> better<00:01:39.960> you

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
like cross elections a lot better you

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:41.880 
like cross elections a lot better you
know<00:01:41.050> even<00:01:41.290> though<00:01:41.380> I've<00:01:41.470> done<00:01:41.650> a<00:01:41.680> lot<00:01:41.830> of

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
know even though I've done a lot of

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:43.140 
know even though I've done a lot of
videos<00:01:42.220> and<00:01:42.400> Forza<00:01:42.610> 4<00:01:42.790> there's<00:01:43.000> still<00:01:43.120> a

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:43.150 
videos and Forza 4 there's still a

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.930 
videos and Forza 4 there's still a
potential<00:01:43.480> for<00:01:43.750> like<00:01:43.990> 2<00:01:44.200> 1<00:01:44.920> to<00:01:45.100> 200<00:01:45.280> more<00:01:45.580> cars

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:45.940 
potential for like 2 1 to 200 more cars

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.710 
potential for like 2 1 to 200 more cars
that<00:01:46.150> i<00:01:46.180> could<00:01:46.360> do<00:01:48.150> you<00:01:49.150> know<00:01:49.270> there's<00:01:49.450> there's

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
that i could do you know there's there's

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.000 
that i could do you know there's there's
still<00:01:49.990> a<00:01:50.020> lot<00:01:50.470> to<00:01:50.500> be<00:01:50.830> done<00:01:52.290> but<00:01:53.290> again<00:01:53.470> it's<00:01:53.890> an

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.010 
still a lot to be done but again it's an

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.000 
still a lot to be done but again it's an
old<00:01:54.130> game<00:01:54.280> in<00:01:55.030> 2009<00:01:55.780> is<00:01:56.110> when<00:01:56.230> it<00:01:56.350> came<00:01:56.470> out<00:01:56.500> 29

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.010 
old game in 2009 is when it came out 29

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.070 
old game in 2009 is when it came out 29
or<00:01:57.400> 2009-2010<00:01:58.240> it's<00:01:58.690> been<00:01:58.810> a<00:01:58.840> while

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
or 2009-2010 it's been a while

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:06.870 
or 2009-2010 it's been a while
regardless<00:02:00.390> and<00:02:02.280> yeah<00:02:03.280> it's<00:02:03.550> just<00:02:03.850> not<00:02:05.700> not<00:02:06.700> as

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
regardless and yeah it's just not not as

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.130
