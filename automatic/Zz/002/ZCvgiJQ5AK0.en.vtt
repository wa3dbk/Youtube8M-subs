4 by 4 portal which zombie pigments are
going<00:00:16.500> to<00:00:16.619> spawn<00:00:16.920> and<00:00:17.250> it<00:00:17.430> is<00:00:17.580> like<00:00:17.760> this<00:00:17.940> let

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
going to spawn and it is like this let

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:27.759 
going to spawn and it is like this let
me<00:00:18.300> just<00:00:18.690> build<00:00:18.960> it<00:00:19.080> so<00:00:19.289> you<00:00:19.350> guys<00:00:19.770> can<00:00:20.039> see<00:00:20.250> it

the most important thing are the

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.940 
the most important thing are the
trapdoors<00:00:39.750> I<00:00:41.840> mean<00:00:42.840> why<00:00:43.110> are<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.410> trapdoors

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
trapdoors I mean why are the trapdoors

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.450 
trapdoors I mean why are the trapdoors
so<00:00:44.760> important<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:46.140> zombie<00:00:46.469> pigments<00:00:46.980> spawn

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
so important the zombie pigments spawn

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.560 
so important the zombie pigments spawn
in<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:48.180> portals<00:00:48.629> and<00:00:49.489> then<00:00:50.489> if<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.239> trap

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
in the portals and then if the trap

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.110 
in the portals and then if the trap
doors<00:00:51.809> aren't<00:00:52.079> here<00:00:52.559> they<00:00:53.190> are<00:00:53.430> not<00:00:53.640> going<00:00:53.879> to

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
doors aren't here they are not going to

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.600 
doors aren't here they are not going to
fall<00:00:54.360> down<00:00:54.390> because<00:00:54.809> they<00:00:55.170> think<00:00:55.230> that<00:00:55.770> it's

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
fall down because they think that it's

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.139 
fall down because they think that it's
not<00:00:57.030> I'm<00:00:57.870> going<00:00:58.199> to<00:00:58.350> die<00:00:58.530> if<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.670> trap<00:00:59.910> doors

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
not I'm going to die if the trap doors

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.400 
not I'm going to die if the trap doors
are<00:01:00.329> here<00:01:00.570> they<00:01:00.750> think<00:01:01.050> that<00:01:01.109> they<00:01:01.379> have

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
are here they think that they have

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.729 
are here they think that they have
another<00:01:02.059> another<00:01:03.059> option<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.809> go<00:01:03.960> that<00:01:04.320> is<00:01:04.559> the

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
another another option to go that is the

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.649 
another another option to go that is the
middle<00:01:05.100> and<00:01:05.280> they<00:01:05.700> died<00:01:05.880> because<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.450> trap

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
middle and they died because the trap

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.410 
middle and they died because the trap
door<00:01:06.840> is<00:01:07.049> not<00:01:07.260> going<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:07.619> help<00:01:07.979> them<00:01:08.310> so<00:01:09.090> this

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
door is not going to help them so this

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.800 
door is not going to help them so this
is<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.720> basic<00:01:09.840> concept<00:01:10.590> so<00:01:11.280> I<00:01:11.490> reproduce<00:01:12.270> it<00:01:12.510> a

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
is the basic concept so I reproduce it a

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.570 
is the basic concept so I reproduce it a
lot<00:01:13.710> of<00:01:13.830> times<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.369> this<00:01:14.640> is<00:01:14.909> my<00:01:15.090> father<00:01:16.580> you

and twenty eight blocks of volume so how

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:07.120 
and twenty eight blocks of volume so how
is<00:02:03.860> this<00:02:03.890> works<00:02:04.840> in<00:02:05.840> every<00:02:06.229> single<00:02:06.439> portal<00:02:06.950> is

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
is this works in every single portal is

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.960 
is this works in every single portal is
a<00:02:07.159> spawning<00:02:07.490> pet<00:02:07.850> they<00:02:08.509> spawn<00:02:08.959> in<00:02:09.489> the<00:02:10.489> portals

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
a spawning pet they spawn in the portals

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.750 
a spawning pet they spawn in the portals
and<00:02:11.150> they<00:02:11.420> fall<00:02:11.630> down<00:02:11.840> due<00:02:12.800> to<00:02:12.830> the<00:02:13.220> trap<00:02:13.489> doors

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
and they fall down due to the trap doors

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.930 
and they fall down due to the trap doors
and<00:02:14.030> they<00:02:14.480> fall<00:02:14.720> down<00:02:14.870> in<00:02:15.170> this<00:02:15.350> area<00:02:15.670> this<00:02:16.670> is

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
and they fall down in this area this is

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.240 
and they fall down in this area this is
the<00:02:17.360> collection<00:02:17.959> area<00:02:18.440> and<00:02:18.620> I<00:02:18.860> build<00:02:19.069> it<00:02:19.220> like

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
the collection area and I build it like

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.250 
the collection area and I build it like
this<00:02:19.640> because<00:02:20.450> this<00:02:21.069> in<00:02:22.069> this<00:02:22.519> in<00:02:23.150> this<00:02:23.900> farm

those<00:03:27.190> two<00:03:27.360> rails<00:03:28.360> this<00:03:29.290> is<00:03:29.790> AFK<00:03:30.790> farm<00:03:31.120> as<00:03:31.390> you

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
those two rails this is AFK farm as you

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.990 
those two rails this is AFK farm as you
can<00:03:31.660> see<00:03:31.900> i<00:03:32.110> picked<00:03:32.410> and<00:03:32.680> you<00:03:33.400> don't<00:03:33.610> have<00:03:33.819> to

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
can see i picked and you don't have to

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.140 
can see i picked and you don't have to
be<00:03:34.120> in<00:03:34.209> Minecraft<00:03:34.780> to<00:03:35.410> do<00:03:35.560> this<00:03:35.760> okay<00:03:36.760> this<00:03:36.940> is

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
be in Minecraft to do this okay this is

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.190 
be in Minecraft to do this okay this is
good<00:03:38.370> but<00:03:39.370> you<00:03:39.640> can<00:03:39.879> do<00:03:40.030> this<00:03:40.209> as<00:03:40.510> well<00:03:40.569> with

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
good but you can do this as well with

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.789 
good but you can do this as well with
water<00:03:41.680> but<00:03:42.160> I<00:03:42.370> think<00:03:42.700> it's<00:03:42.879> quite<00:03:43.209> it's<00:03:44.200> quite

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799 
water but I think it's quite it's quite

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:47.339 
water but I think it's quite it's quite
difficult<00:03:45.310> it's<00:03:45.819> more<00:03:46.030> difficult<00:03:46.209> and<00:03:46.720> in<00:03:47.230> my

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:47.349 
difficult it's more difficult and in my

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:51.509 
difficult it's more difficult and in my
opinion<00:03:47.709> less<00:03:48.810> India<00:03:49.810> static<00:03:50.349> mode<00:03:50.560> it's<00:03:51.160> less

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 
opinion less India static mode it's less

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:58.890 
opinion less India static mode it's less
beauty<00:03:53.519> so<00:03:54.840> just<00:03:55.840> more<00:03:57.239> more<00:03:58.239> things<00:03:58.599> that<00:03:58.750> I

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
beauty so just more more things that I

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.089 
beauty so just more more things that I
can<00:03:59.140> say<00:03:59.470> to<00:03:59.500> you<00:03:59.880> it's<00:04:00.880> not<00:04:01.709> required<00:04:02.709> to<00:04:03.010> be

00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:03.099 
can say to you it's not required to be

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:08.300 
can say to you it's not required to be
trapdoors<00:04:03.760> you<00:04:04.209> can<00:04:04.480> use<00:04:05.430> just

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
trapdoors you can use just

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.790 
trapdoors you can use just
you<00:04:08.849> can<00:04:09.060> use<00:04:09.270> signs<00:04:09.660> as<00:04:09.959> well<00:04:10.200> because<00:04:10.650> the

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:10.800 
you can use signs as well because the

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.530 
you can use signs as well because the
eat<00:04:10.920> box<00:04:11.220> is<00:04:11.849> the<00:04:12.030> same

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.349 

but<00:04:15.140> I<00:04:15.409> think<00:04:16.160> that<00:04:16.220> trap<00:04:16.639> doors<00:04:16.910> are<00:04:17.180> better

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
but I think that trap doors are better

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:20.229 
but I think that trap doors are better
because<00:04:17.720> they<00:04:18.199> are<00:04:18.380> most<00:04:18.680> most<00:04:19.130> easier<00:04:19.669> they

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
because they are most most easier they

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:22.990 
because they are most most easier they
are<00:04:20.359> more<00:04:20.600> easier<00:04:20.959> to<00:04:21.259> put<00:04:21.560> but<00:04:22.220> it's<00:04:22.520> it's

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 
are more easier to put but it's it's

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.030 
are more easier to put but it's it's
nice<00:04:24.100> sorry

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040 
nice sorry

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.660 
nice sorry
the<00:04:26.730> the<00:04:27.210> cons<00:04:27.510> of<00:04:27.810> this<00:04:27.870> is<00:04:28.380> that<00:04:28.440> of<00:04:29.310> course

farming all this obsidian in all this
wood<00:04:32.100> is<00:04:32.490> going<00:04:32.730> to<00:04:32.850> require<00:04:33.030> some<00:04:33.240> time<00:04:33.780> and
