00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:09.960
 Hello dear friends with you 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.090
 dragoons and welcome to panzar 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.880
 This is the second series in which we play 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.920
 panzar but today I play with subscribers 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.779
 i play with two people because 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.330
 maximum can be invited to the group in the pan 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.609
 charge only two people i if 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.800
 honestly thought there would be more people but 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.199
 just two people so I decided 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.220
 what will be more series and in each series 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.560
 I will invite two people 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.690
 subscriber will play one round with them 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.079
 so that everything is honest and and no one 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.910
 I was hurt and it looks like that of 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.440
 those people whom I invited because 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.090
 he stands on her watching me 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.969
 looking at me let's jump 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.190
 jump jump guys who want 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.230
 play with me and who does not know where the general 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.559

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:55.320
 just take pass through the link in 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:59.160
 description and download panzar 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.629
 therefore yes therefore it is very easy so 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.160
 let's turn off the voice connection 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.040
 because now everyone will say 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:08.510
 people i don't want to hear it all 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:13.590
 so sound sound sound sound sound sound sound 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:15.720
 voice communication turn off everything now everything 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.850
 ok now nobody will be me 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.520
 interrupt and I will normally speak 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.090
 Well the battle began, we're playing for 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.850
 the team 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.610
 making gunner we have on the basis of that 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.860
 makes enemy she returned to base 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.180
 die die die here are invincible 3000 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.280
 by the way from one of those subscribers 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.100
 who added to me and who was then 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.229
 online when I put together a group so we 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.960
 play we play with him so 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.930
 let's drag him because on him 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.680
 attacked another inquisitor we all killed 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.140
 inquisitor 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.149
 so we play for the team we play for 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.729
 Whom to us and we play for the team of blue and 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.439
 in principle, we now win before us 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.680
 already 70 80 points 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.210
 even eighty six points 91 that's it 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.829
 but that's good enough we are by the way 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.549
 moving forward it seems to me that this fight 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:03.990
 will be fast enough and we are still in 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.090
 you have to win because you look 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.520
 in the enemy team 0 points that is 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.200
 the opposing team she fights though 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.870
 but our team 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.269
 in a clear plus in a very clear plus 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.330
 there is enough good teamwork of us 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:21.390
 we have a team to a team that have tanks 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:24.000
 well tanked and those who are very good 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.800
 generally protect from all of us and therefore 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.209
 our team with good enough 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.300
 results shows 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:32.400
 so let's let's wait like that 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.530
 the way I bummed well what could be 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.019
 at least some of the enemies will touch no for 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.060
 I still bummed a case and got close 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:40.349
 okay okay okay what's not here 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.019
 Friendly and FIRE 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:44.849
 our least of all is ron because it 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:46.319
 it would be bad of and pummeling killed our 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:48.150
 not only is the team and thank and 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:50.760
 our killed so let us out now 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.040
 there's Strel it features a little bit not to 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.260
 bummed and that's literally a little bit 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.030
 I managed to kill the enemies but all 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.459
 anyway I'm at least someone on the bottom damage so here 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:02.340
 not given a kill plus 10 on the stone spot 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:04.260
 Well, I'm not at such a good place 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.989
 but it's because I'm not 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.760
 the character that attacks i play 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:09.510
 a character who attacks far 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.780
 little by little 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.519
 Well, in general, support, that is, the assistant 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.829
 which helps other players kill 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:19.470
 all because basically the main 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:20.720
 the killers are here of course the berserkers 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.880
 this 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.200
 inquisitors and paladins but paladin him 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.060
 sleep heals therefore most likely 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.139
 berserkers inquisitors here on me 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.690
 for example now attacked one of 

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:33.180
 inquisitors let us try it 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:38.609
 kill no no no no i don't have mana 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:42.150
 i have nothing hell die die die hell 

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:43.680
 I squandered it twice okay so 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.370
 let's quickly settle with your nickname 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.319
 settle down 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.269
 well , our team is already two hundred 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:49.799
 thirty eight points is practically 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:51.660
 half of what we need to do for 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:54.599
 wins that is here the game goes to 500 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:56.250
 points this one thing in the center we 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:58.079
 must capture but also not give 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.299
 the enemy and capture the form of the enemy 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:03.329
 already scored your first enemy swamps 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:04.889
 already 39 points but it seems to me that if we 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:06.750
 We will continue to attack and with such 

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:08.459
 headquarters to such is now the enemy table 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.989
 Soon there will be no points left because 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:11.390
 here thirty seven points from the opponent 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:13.130
 at 350 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:16.250
 Well, yes, in principle, we are good enough 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:19.549
 attack the team 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:22.100
 plays well, that is, supports help 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:24.350
 those who must kill all of them 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:27.290
 kill those who must protect all they 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:30.650
 therefore they protect everyone well enough 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:33.169
 we play and think I think we are 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:35.150
 continue to play here is undefeated 3000 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:37.640
 here in front of me to run yes yes yes yes 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:41.360

 you all beat me let's just 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:03.200
 then just let's attack guys 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:04.700
 just attack the enemy team by the way 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:06.800
 they have a lot of Arsenal that is, they won 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:08.720
 all the guns were staged there on the base of these 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.890
 guns, though not too help us already 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:12.140
 three hundred ninety six points 

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:15.110
 literally 100 points left to win 

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:21.110
 as for me it is very good because 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:25.190
 that. die die die die die die 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:28.820

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:30.970
 still killed came berserker did by 

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:36.320
 him one hit and finished him off 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:39.260
 okay so 420. Our team already has 422 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:42.380
 but still we win it very much 

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:44.600
 good result for being so short for 

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:47.000
 I have time that sometimes it happens that y 

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:49.160
 20 minutes and from the team so here's a straight desk 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.770

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:54.350
 the team still drags you even 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:58.580
 say that is, we are fast enough 

00:05:54.350 --> 00:06:00.350
