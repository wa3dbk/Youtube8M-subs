00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
engineer it's going to be perfect or a

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.490 
engineer it's going to be perfect or a

snipe the enemies from here ok so that

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.480

was<00:04:31.860> my<00:04:32.039> only<00:04:32.550> two<00:04:33.000> spots<00:04:33.180> for<00:04:33.630> this<00:04:34.220> area<00:04:35.220> and

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
was my only two spots for this area and

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.689 
was my only two spots for this area and
now<00:04:36.300> let's<00:04:36.630> go<00:04:36.720> to<00:04:36.870> the<00:04:37.229> area<00:04:37.620> number<00:04:37.860> for<00:04:38.250> the

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:38.699 
now let's go to the area number for the

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:41.480 
now let's go to the area number for the
last<00:04:38.910> part<00:04:39.120> ok<00:04:39.900> so<00:04:39.960> a<00:04:40.139> good<00:04:40.380> place<00:04:40.620> to<00:04:40.770> go<00:04:40.919> is<00:04:41.130> in

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
last part ok so a good place to go is in

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.969

there is two entrance to this building

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.839 
there is two entrance to this building
so<00:04:48.690> go<00:04:49.169> there<00:04:49.380> slowly<00:04:49.680> ok<00:04:50.130> so<00:04:50.190> when<00:04:50.430> you<00:04:50.550> go<00:04:50.699> out
