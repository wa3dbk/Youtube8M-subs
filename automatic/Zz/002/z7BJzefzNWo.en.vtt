00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
and I recommend that you either pick

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.670 
and I recommend that you either pick
that<00:01:00.030> spawn<00:01:00.510> or<00:01:00.750> you<00:01:00.870> pick<00:01:01.079> this<00:01:01.230> bond<00:01:01.440> or<00:01:01.620> if

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
that spawn or you pick this bond or if

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:02.869 
that spawn or you pick this bond or if
you<00:01:01.770> think<00:01:01.980> you<00:01:02.070> have<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.219> gun<00:01:02.460> skill<00:01:02.699> to<00:01:02.789> do

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
you think you have the gun skill to do

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.570 
you think you have the gun skill to do
it<00:01:03.030> then<00:01:03.719> you<00:01:03.870> can<00:01:04.019> definitely<00:01:04.199> go<00:01:04.650> to<00:01:04.710> bolt

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
it then you can definitely go to bolt

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.190 
it then you can definitely go to bolt
the<00:01:05.729> spawns<00:01:06.000> so<00:01:06.450> you<00:01:06.510> can<00:01:06.689> kind<00:01:06.840> of<00:01:06.869> sit<00:01:07.020> here

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
the spawns so you can kind of sit here

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.020 
the spawns so you can kind of sit here
and<00:01:07.290> just<00:01:07.409> use<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.100> V<00:01:08.250> set<00:01:08.490> to<00:01:08.640> know<00:01:08.729> which<00:01:08.880> one

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
and just use the V set to know which one

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.250 
and just use the V set to know which one
they're<00:01:09.150> spawning<00:01:09.360> at<00:01:09.600> but<00:01:09.750> they<00:01:09.840> double<00:01:10.110> Swan

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
they're spawning at but they double Swan

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.899 
they're spawning at but they double Swan

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
you kind of get a good screwed so that's

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.750 
you kind of get a good screwed so that's
why<00:01:12.060> you<00:01:12.119> need<00:01:12.330> some<00:01:12.479> help<00:01:12.659> here<00:01:12.750> at<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.049> front

person's job is to cover this spawn and

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.370 
person's job is to cover this spawn and
maybe<00:01:21.090> that's<00:01:21.299> one<00:01:21.479> as<00:01:21.600> well<00:01:21.720> just<00:01:21.960> basically

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.780 
it's like a two-man spot for three spots
and<00:01:24.740> that's<00:01:25.740> pretty<00:01:25.860> much<00:01:25.979> I<00:01:26.159> gotta<00:01:26.310> do<00:01:26.490> it<00:01:26.610> now

moving<00:01:27.689> on<00:01:27.960> to<00:01:28.939> this<00:01:29.939> part<00:01:31.100> Arnold<00:01:32.100> I<00:01:32.310> think<00:01:32.820> I

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
moving on to this part Arnold I think I

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.370 
moving on to this part Arnold I think I
don't<00:01:33.180> know<00:01:33.240> my<00:01:33.270> TV<00:01:33.689> turn<00:01:33.900> black<00:01:34.079> quite<00:01:34.350> a

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
don't know my TV turn black quite a

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.710 
don't know my TV turn black quite a
little<00:01:34.619> bit<00:01:34.829> video<00:01:35.159> did<00:01:35.369> anyway<00:01:35.700> this<00:01:36.630> is

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
little bit video did anyway this is

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:37.940 
little bit video did anyway this is
kitchens<00:01:37.079> basically<00:01:37.470> which<00:01:37.560> one<00:01:37.710> do<00:01:37.799> you<00:01:37.920> want

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
kitchens basically which one do you want

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.190 
kitchens basically which one do you want
to<00:01:38.100> block<00:01:38.280> this<00:01:38.579> there's<00:01:39.240> a<00:01:39.360> spawn<00:01:39.689> in<00:01:39.840> here

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
to block this there's a spawn in here

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.749 
to block this there's a spawn in here
and<00:01:40.350> this<00:01:40.500> one<00:01:40.770> over<00:01:40.799> here<00:01:40.979> so<00:01:41.250> basic<00:01:41.549> you<00:01:41.610> want

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
and this one over here so basic you want

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.210 
and this one over here so basic you want
to<00:01:41.820> put<00:01:41.939> one<00:01:42.060> person<00:01:42.390> standing<00:01:42.720> here<00:01:42.960> and<00:01:43.220> when

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
to put one person standing here and when

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.410 
to put one person standing here and when
you<00:01:44.280> put<00:01:44.430> them<00:01:44.520> here<00:01:44.700> then<00:01:44.820> they<00:01:44.939> only<00:01:45.090> spawn

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
you put them here then they only spawn

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.730 
you put them here then they only spawn
in<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.630> front<00:01:45.960> I<00:01:46.110> believe<00:01:46.350> it's<00:01:46.470> like<00:01:46.560> right

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
in the front I believe it's like right

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.920 
in the front I believe it's like right
here<00:01:47.119> maybe<00:01:48.119> we're<00:01:48.270> here<00:01:48.390> i'm<00:01:48.479> not<00:01:48.600> sure<00:01:48.750> i

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
here maybe we're here i'm not sure i

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.289 
here maybe we're here i'm not sure i
don't<00:01:49.079> watch<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.409> spot<00:01:49.649> but<00:01:50.210> basically<00:01:51.210> i

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
don't watch the spot but basically i

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.639 
don't watch the spot but basically i
know<00:01:51.420> you<00:01:51.540> do<00:01:51.720> have<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:51.930> stand<00:01:52.170> here<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:52.470> block

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
know you do have to stand here to block

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:53.929 
know you do have to stand here to block
those<00:01:52.799> funds<00:01:53.100> on<00:01:53.250> they<00:01:53.340> spawn<00:01:53.579> in<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.729> living

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
those funds on they spawn in the living

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.080 
those funds on they spawn in the living
room<00:01:54.060> okay<00:01:54.540> and<00:01:54.829> then<00:01:55.829> the<00:01:56.399> last<00:01:56.549> one<00:01:56.729> is

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
room okay and then the last one is

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.240 
room okay and then the last one is
fenced<00:01:57.930> and<00:01:58.110> this<00:01:58.710> one<00:01:58.860> right<00:01:58.979> here<00:01:59.040> in<00:01:59.189> the

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
fenced and this one right here in the

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.800 
fenced and this one right here in the
fens<00:01:59.399> like<00:01:59.549> this<00:01:59.759> this<00:02:00.329> is<00:02:00.390> probably<00:02:00.689> the

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
fens like this this is probably the

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.690 
fens like this this is probably the
second<00:02:01.110> best<00:02:01.170> spot<00:02:01.460> actually<00:02:02.460> might<00:02:02.579> be<00:02:02.610> the

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
second best spot actually might be the

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.520 
second best spot actually might be the
best<00:02:02.969> but<00:02:03.180> i<00:02:03.240> don't<00:02:03.450> know<00:02:03.509> that<00:02:03.719> and<00:02:04.140> outside

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
best but i don't know that and outside

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.050 
best but i don't know that and outside
Roger<00:02:04.740> pretty<00:02:05.009> even<00:02:05.310> but<00:02:05.729> one<00:02:05.850> thing<00:02:06.000> you

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
Roger pretty even but one thing you

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.310 
Roger pretty even but one thing you
gotta<00:02:06.180> watch<00:02:06.329> out<00:02:06.509> for<00:02:06.540> if<00:02:06.840> you're<00:02:06.960> on<00:02:07.049> offense

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
gotta watch out for if you're on offense

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.169 
gotta watch out for if you're on offense
is<00:02:07.619> you<00:02:07.770> don't<00:02:07.920> want<00:02:08.069> to<00:02:08.160> be<00:02:08.280> too<00:02:08.610> close<00:02:08.879> to<00:02:09.090> it

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
is you don't want to be too close to it

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.070 
is you don't want to be too close to it
you<00:02:09.239> can't<00:02:09.420> be<00:02:09.479> like<00:02:09.599> all<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.840> way<00:02:09.899> right<00:02:10.020> here

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
you can't be like all the way right here

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.630 
you can't be like all the way right here
because<00:02:10.890> what<00:02:11.039> will<00:02:11.099> happen<00:02:11.160> is<00:02:11.430> they'll

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
because what will happen is they'll

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.500 
because what will happen is they'll
spawn<00:02:11.849> right<00:02:12.030> here<00:02:12.209> behind<00:02:12.360> you

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
spawn right here behind you

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:14.729 
spawn right here behind you
so<00:02:13.689> you<00:02:13.780> kind<00:02:14.110> of<00:02:14.140> want<00:02:14.319> to<00:02:14.409> stay<00:02:14.560> like<00:02:14.680> a

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:14.739 
so you kind of want to stay like a

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:16.610 
so you kind of want to stay like a
little<00:02:15.010> bit<00:02:15.099> farther<00:02:15.340> back<00:02:15.519> like<00:02:15.760> this<00:02:15.939> and

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
little bit farther back like this and

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.720 
little bit farther back like this and
let<00:02:17.620> them<00:02:17.739> run<00:02:17.890> out<00:02:18.040> a<00:02:18.069> little<00:02:18.250> bit<00:02:18.459> and<00:02:18.670> then

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
let them run out a little bit and then

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.240 
let them run out a little bit and then
kill<00:02:19.450> them<00:02:19.569> and<00:02:19.799> that's<00:02:20.799> pretty<00:02:20.920> much<00:02:21.010> to<00:02:21.159> the

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
kill them and that's pretty much to the

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.890 
kill them and that's pretty much to the
side<00:02:21.459> so<00:02:21.879> we<00:02:22.239> go<00:02:22.329> to<00:02:22.420> the<00:02:22.510> other<00:02:22.599> side<00:02:24.840> okay<00:02:25.840> so

you guys saw that in the video and then

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.399 
you guys saw that in the video and then
when<00:02:57.519> you<00:02:57.579> go<00:02:57.670> inside<00:02:57.700> here<00:02:58.090> into<00:02:58.299> kitchen<00:02:58.659> you

when you go inside here into kitchen you

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:00.690 
when you go inside here into kitchen you
have<00:02:59.530> to<00:02:59.680> stand<00:02:59.920> right<00:03:00.069> here<00:03:00.190> because<00:03:00.519> there's

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
have to stand right here because there's

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:01.740 
have to stand right here because there's
a<00:03:00.760> spawn<00:03:00.970> in<00:03:01.090> the<00:03:01.150> kitchen<00:03:01.389> I<00:03:01.450> believe<00:03:01.629> it's

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
a spawn in the kitchen I believe it's

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:02.970 
a spawn in the kitchen I believe it's
right<00:03:01.810> there<00:03:01.930> in<00:03:02.019> the<00:03:02.079> corner<00:03:02.319> but<00:03:02.829> if<00:03:02.889> you

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
right there in the corner but if you

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:03.990 
right there in the corner but if you
standing<00:03:03.310> here<00:03:03.340> they<00:03:03.459> won't<00:03:03.549> spawn<00:03:03.730> there<00:03:03.909> and

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
standing here they won't spawn there and

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.979 
standing here they won't spawn there and
then<00:03:04.090> there's<00:03:04.239> a<00:03:04.269> doubles<00:03:04.540> pointer<00:03:04.720> here<00:03:04.840> this

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
then there's a doubles pointer here this

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:06.809 
then there's a doubles pointer here this
one<00:03:05.139> right<00:03:05.230> here<00:03:05.319> and<00:03:05.680> this<00:03:06.400> one<00:03:06.609> right<00:03:06.730> here

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:06.819 
one right here and this one right here

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:10.110 
one right here and this one right here
