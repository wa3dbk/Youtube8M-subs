here so first of all you've got the
device<00:01:41.610> actually<00:01:42.119> docked<00:01:42.600> and<00:01:42.869> its<00:01:42.960> cradle

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
device actually docked and its cradle

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.469 
device actually docked and its cradle
right<00:01:43.470> there<00:01:43.740> but<00:01:44.430> more<00:01:44.729> importantly<00:01:45.149> that

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
right there but more importantly that

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.149 
right there but more importantly that
hold<00:01:45.659> cradle<00:01:45.990> removes<00:01:46.290> most<00:01:46.740> of<00:01:46.950> it<00:01:47.009> anyway

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
hold cradle removes most of it anyway

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.950 
hold cradle removes most of it anyway
and<00:01:47.490> this<00:01:47.970> is<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.240> reason<00:01:48.540> you<00:01:48.630> go<00:01:48.750> in<00:01:48.869> the

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
and this is the reason you go in the

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.539 
and this is the reason you go in the
Nissan<00:01:49.350> piece<00:01:49.619> because<00:01:49.979> you<00:01:50.009> have<00:01:50.250> really

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
Nissan piece because you have really

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.910 
Nissan piece because you have really
clean<00:01:50.850> integration<00:01:51.600> basically<00:01:52.439> for<00:01:52.649> power

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
clean integration basically for power

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.249 
clean integration basically for power
and<00:01:53.340> it<00:01:54.090> gets<00:01:54.299> turned<00:01:54.540> on<00:01:54.659> and<00:01:54.810> off<00:01:54.899> with<00:01:55.140> the

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
and it gets turned on and off with the

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.020 
and it gets turned on and off with the
vehicle<00:01:55.409> and<00:01:55.770> things<00:01:56.340> of<00:01:56.460> that<00:01:56.490> nature<00:01:56.610> so<00:01:56.939> it

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
vehicle and things of that nature so it

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.700 
vehicle and things of that nature so it
ends<00:01:57.210> up<00:01:57.240> feeling<00:01:57.299> integrated<00:01:58.110> and<00:01:58.320> it<00:01:58.439> snaps

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
ends up feeling integrated and it snaps

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.319 
ends up feeling integrated and it snaps
together<00:01:58.860> pretty<00:01:59.159> well<00:01:59.399> even<00:01:59.909> though<00:02:00.149> it's

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
together pretty well even though it's

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:01.880 
together pretty well even though it's
basically<00:02:00.869> a<00:02:01.200> PMD

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
basically a PMD

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.100 
basically a PMD
now<00:02:02.700> we've<00:02:02.850> reviewed<00:02:03.180> this<00:02:03.360> as<00:02:03.570> a<00:02:03.600> separate

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
now we've reviewed this as a separate

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.660 
now we've reviewed this as a separate
product<00:02:04.590> like<00:02:04.710> you<00:02:04.860> might<00:02:05.040> buy<00:02:05.250> it<00:02:05.310> one<00:02:05.520> of<00:02:05.579> the

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
product like you might buy it one of the

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.190 
product like you might buy it one of the
big-box<00:02:06.000> stores<00:02:06.329> and<00:02:06.420> we<00:02:06.570> think<00:02:06.780> it's<00:02:06.930> pretty

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
big-box stores and we think it's pretty

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.229 
big-box stores and we think it's pretty
good<00:02:07.500> Bonnie<00:02:07.890> cha<00:02:08.190> gave<00:02:08.399> it<00:02:08.520> three<00:02:08.729> stars<00:02:08.759> out

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
good Bonnie cha gave it three stars out

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.330 
good Bonnie cha gave it three stars out
of<00:02:09.270> five<00:02:09.569> our<00:02:09.840> big<00:02:10.259> knock<00:02:10.470> against<00:02:10.860> it<00:02:10.950> is<00:02:11.069> kind

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
of five our big knock against it is kind

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.410 
of five our big knock against it is kind
of<00:02:11.400> sluggish<00:02:11.790> performance

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
of sluggish performance

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:14.550 
of sluggish performance
now<00:02:13.510> of<00:02:13.569> course<00:02:13.630> it<00:02:13.930> is<00:02:14.020> a<00:02:14.080> touchscreen<00:02:14.380> device

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
now of course it is a touchscreen device

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.530 
now of course it is a touchscreen device
as<00:02:14.950> you<00:02:15.069> can<00:02:15.250> see<00:02:15.459> these<00:02:15.670> things<00:02:15.910> always<00:02:16.180> are

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
as you can see these things always are

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.360 
as you can see these things always are
and<00:02:16.990> even<00:02:17.349> though<00:02:17.500> it's<00:02:17.620> kind<00:02:17.739> of<00:02:17.860> small<00:02:18.160> it

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
and even though it's kind of small it

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.100 
and even though it's kind of small it
works<00:02:18.640> well<00:02:18.940> because<00:02:19.180> the<00:02:19.420> positioning<00:02:19.989> is

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
works well because the positioning is

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:21.930 
works well because the positioning is
very<00:02:20.290> close<00:02:20.560> to<00:02:20.590> the<00:02:20.800> driver<00:02:21.069> it's<00:02:21.400> in<00:02:21.790> your

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
very close to the driver it's in your

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.610 
very close to the driver it's in your
line<00:02:22.090> of<00:02:22.120> sight<00:02:22.300> more<00:02:22.810> than<00:02:23.020> if<00:02:23.230> it's<00:02:23.440> down

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
line of sight more than if it's down

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:24.720 
line of sight more than if it's down
here<00:02:24.069> which<00:02:24.190> I<00:02:24.280> do<00:02:24.340> like

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
here which I do like

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.820 
here which I do like
and<00:02:24.940> while<00:02:25.510> the<00:02:25.660> screen<00:02:25.900> isn't<00:02:26.080> as<00:02:26.260> big<00:02:26.440> as<00:02:26.590> I'd

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
and while the screen isn't as big as I'd

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.710 
and while the screen isn't as big as I'd
like<00:02:27.069> it<00:02:27.099> to<00:02:27.280> be<00:02:27.459> the<00:02:28.030> brightness<00:02:28.420> is<00:02:28.540> pretty

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
like it to be the brightness is pretty

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.050 
like it to be the brightness is pretty
strong<00:02:29.100> now<00:02:30.100> of<00:02:30.190> course<00:02:30.340> this<00:02:30.520> system<00:02:30.880> doesn't

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
strong now of course this system doesn't

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.640 
strong now of course this system doesn't
have<00:02:31.270> things<00:02:31.480> like<00:02:31.660> live<00:02:31.900> traffic<00:02:32.290> or

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
have things like live traffic or

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.620 
have things like live traffic or
connected<00:02:33.550> ability<00:02:33.940> so<00:02:34.090> you<00:02:34.180> can't<00:02:34.390> look<00:02:34.480> at

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
connected ability so you can't look at

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.660 
connected ability so you can't look at
the<00:02:34.750> latest<00:02:35.020> prices<00:02:35.290> for<00:02:35.680> gasoline<00:02:36.130> in<00:02:36.520> your

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
area etc but for 450 bucks that's a lot

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:42.150 
area etc but for 450 bucks that's a lot
less<00:02:40.420> sticker<00:02:40.690> shock<00:02:41.050> than<00:02:41.230> the<00:02:41.350> 2<00:02:41.530> grand<00:02:41.860> or
