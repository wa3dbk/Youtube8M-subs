00:00:05.519 --> 00:00:12.930
 hello I'm scared no 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:12.930
 OK it's good 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.910
 and hi all guys here i am gods 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:21.619
 games shop 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:23.779
 in this new video tutorial I am 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:25.010
 forgot to put the texture though 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:27.550
 does nothing 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:30.430
 in this tutorial I will explain how to do it 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:35.180
 they are not a kind of pastime or 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:39.410
 what you want allows 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:42.710
 it is really useless it is not that it will give you 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:46.879
 a very interesting purpose will do 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:50.089
 all mobs are born from these handouts e 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:54.860
 then terraqua and then finally with the tnt 

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:56.570
 and kill them that's not enough it's all here and 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:00.489
 just a useless thing 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.489
 now I'll show you how it works 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:10.729
 how do you see the unknown mob 

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:15.970
 ok lasko lotto t mob and we expect that 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:19.490
 I advise you if you use this thing 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:21.250
 only if you have a nice computer because if 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:25.520
 you have one that really sucks 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:30.409
 I advise against this bitterly 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:33.710
 central explains a bit how it works 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:37.609
 now this button activates this 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:42.079
 love that shut down activity turns everyone on 

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:45.920
 these dispensations now I should have 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:49.570
 do maybe something like that either 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.570
 get yourself cows book 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.860
 don't even put them in blue 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:03.759
 I should have done something like that but 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:06.090
 I'm a moron so I can't 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:06.090
 do everything 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:13.239
 sorry i suck anyway you have to have 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:17.200
 a beautiful powerful computer because how 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:19.300
 see the race a little bit maybe here 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:25.030
 as you can see there is a nice drop in frames 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:27.660
 sean or 9 fps 10 and I don't know when you 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:31.930
 you are tired of all this lag 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.680
 hold the button and stop 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.959
 to be born 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:48.730
 click are welcoming then press 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:51.420
 it ends and you don't let me do one 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.420
 shitty figure 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:59.970
 oh God I'm going to check on what that 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.970
 it does not work 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:09.050
 it is not that something is wrong e 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:11.300
 it is my intelligence that is 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:15.230
 prevents me 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:16.780
 so here there is an absolute mega lager but 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:21.410
 that you don't make me enteral god 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:30.709
 here the clay ends and enjoy it 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:33.770
 show or god that lag ok then if 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:38.020
 you see that they do not all die 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:38.020
 above is a sort of elevator 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:47.320
 put another row of activated tnt e 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:51.380
 puts another one to be sure 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:59.989
 deactivate let's see if added together 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:04:03.940
 everyone is good even with part now 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:07.780
 we can send with our spadotto 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.780
 a tie world 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:20.390
 and kill all of them crytek training 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.390
 that kill us others 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.380
 Oh God, it's a beautiful explosion 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:39.390
 kill others we hope that's not 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:42.690
 destroy half a circuit that in theory 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:45.740
 add up all these cows stick is from 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:51.660
 for himself he kills you one after another 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:54.980
 boom and bust is just its one thing 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:05:01.280
 useless but it's always fun to do it e 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:05:03.480
 consists of making a lob in this world 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:09.120
 now I'll show you 

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:11.790
 take a little Rocco and directed a 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.950
 lob can be done long and distant like 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:16.020
 you want 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:18.560
 I do now so it is delayed to 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.560
 maximum 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:25.770
 then take you place them first 

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:27.660
 a fair in so connect things 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:30.660
 girl and then a row in that with le 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:32.550
 legs like a piece and then decide how 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:34.950
 you the button activated 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:37.650
 here is this active filas that you could 

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:44.340
 that is, to continue turning the infinite then 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:46.040
 here how you lose your handouts and there 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:51.000
 put everything you want 

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:58.380
 as you can see too much meat then we can 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:06:01.260
 increase speed and if you still want 

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:04.500
 faster enough to disable this 

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:11.360
 to connect this was a cassette 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:11.360
 of the genus ok fail 

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:17.300
 ok fail 2 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:29.000
 it takes a nice ass to get it fast 

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:32.870
 so let's use the lever 6 2 

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.870
 ok 3 

00:06:33.599 --> 00:06:48.930
 goodbye how much i hate making mistakes ok but in 

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:51.030
 fucking facts you delay and for 

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:54.050
 this you speed it up is ok 

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:57.780
 the least can not be done like that 

00:06:54.050 --> 00:07:01.020
 he knows me precisely because it's impossible 

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:06.930
 I know that the minimum and 4 done is long 

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:11.719
 so this is spaced good ok if the 

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:17.130
 2 that is why 80 should not be made of co2 

00:07:11.719 --> 00:07:19.860
 recco and now the spencers are empty and 

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:21.690
 we can put all that 

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:22.969
 however, we want it so fast it is not 

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:30.659
 will never take 

00:07:22.969 --> 00:07:36.690
 here is this second spencer and just do it 

00:07:30.659 --> 00:07:39.449
 this process here is like this 

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:42.330
 near such a thing if you want e 

00:07:39.449 --> 00:07:46.259
 then to activate the tnt the button 

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:51.180
 active this remains that passes here and does 

00:07:46.259 --> 00:07:54.120
 this is what I note this certainty boom 

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:56.750
 with that it's all and see you at 

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:56.750
 next video
