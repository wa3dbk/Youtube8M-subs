00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
if the bits around where the seed goes

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.229 
if the bits around where the seed goes
near<00:03:41.230> the<00:03:41.350> core<00:03:41.590> are<00:03:42.100> hard<00:03:42.370> then<00:03:42.880> it's<00:03:43.090> not

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
near the core are hard then it's not

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:45.210

right quite ripe yet another thing

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:46.860 
right quite ripe yet another thing
people<00:03:45.400> do<00:03:45.610> is<00:03:45.850> because<00:03:46.360> it<00:03:46.540> has<00:03:46.660> a<00:03:46.690> lot<00:03:46.840> of

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
people do is because it has a lot of

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.740 
people do is because it has a lot of
latex<00:03:47.410> if<00:03:47.680> it's<00:03:47.830> not<00:03:48.040> ripe<00:03:48.280> then<00:03:49.120> they<00:03:49.570> would

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
latex if it's not ripe then they would

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.190 
latex if it's not ripe then they would
use<00:03:49.780> a<00:03:50.020> knife<00:03:50.680> with<00:03:50.980> oil<00:03:51.280> to<00:03:52.090> cut<00:03:52.720> into<00:03:53.110> the

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
use a knife with oil to cut into the

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.560 
use a knife with oil to cut into the
jackfruit<00:03:53.470> so<00:03:54.340> the<00:03:54.459> oil<00:03:54.640> goes<00:03:54.940> through<00:03:55.360> the

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:55.570 
jackfruit so the oil goes through the

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:57.990 
jackfruit so the oil goes through the
latex<00:03:55.930> which<00:03:56.170> is<00:03:56.320> super<00:03:56.860> super<00:03:57.070> sticky<00:03:57.520> gets<00:03:57.850> a
