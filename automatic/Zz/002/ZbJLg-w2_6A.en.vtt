your brushes and load it up with water
and<00:01:45.820> throw<00:01:46.820> a<00:01:46.909> few<00:01:47.270> drops<00:01:47.540> on<00:01:47.840> top<00:01:48.110> of<00:01:48.350> the

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
and throw a few drops on top of the

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.090 
and throw a few drops on top of the
powder<00:01:49.159> and<00:01:49.930> use<00:01:50.930> the<00:01:51.170> brush<00:01:51.440> to<00:01:51.770> kind<00:01:51.979> of

powder and use the brush to kind of

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.370 
powder and use the brush to kind of
really<00:01:52.280> press<00:01:52.759> it<00:01:52.970> in<00:01:53.180> so<00:01:53.509> it'll<00:01:53.930> mix<00:01:54.170> together

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
really press it in so it'll mix together

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.980

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
because sometimes powders have these

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:58.810 
because sometimes powders have these
ingredients<00:01:57.649> that<00:01:57.799> want<00:01:58.130> to<00:01:58.250> repulse<00:01:58.640> the

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
ingredients that want to repulse the

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.060 
ingredients that want to repulse the
water<00:01:59.030> molecules<00:01:59.570> and<00:01:59.780> they<00:02:00.320> won't<00:02:00.530> mix<00:02:00.740> quite

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
water molecules and they won't mix quite

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.639 
water molecules and they won't mix quite

easily so you're just going to want to

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:05.950 
easily so you're just going to want to
mix<00:02:04.190> it<00:02:04.369> well<00:02:04.549> before<00:02:04.789> you<00:02:05.090> start<00:02:05.360> applying<00:02:05.690> it

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.509 
to the paper think it was around here I
decided<00:02:14.870> it<00:02:15.110> looked<00:02:15.350> like<00:02:15.500> a<00:02:15.530> bird<00:02:15.800> so<00:02:16.489> I

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:16.519 
decided it looked like a bird so I

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:18.479
