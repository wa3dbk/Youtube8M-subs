00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.049
 hello people how are we here in a 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:09.910
 new video where we are going to learn to 

00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:11.440
 how to record the games sing and study 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:13.869
 because with qantas I study because I 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.430
 It touches many people says in many videos 

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:18.410
 where have I seen programs 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.420
 of for games they say they get them down 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.240
 many gps am me with money that camps 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:25.779
 towards this 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:28.730
 even though it is not for this I in the 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:30.410
 8 already record well 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.750
 if you can record a game to the monkey 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.980
 window with a full screen I've 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:39.829
 viewed 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:42.610
 windows 7 the same but talking about the 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:45.610
 that we have like for windows 8 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.610
 7 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:54.649
 team 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:56.700
 and because the configuration system to 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:01:00.540
 system scale 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:06.120
 here where it says performance with 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:07.790
 migration and leaving people to put 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.040
 we 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:13.000
 this because sing if you study for the 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.000
 fullscreen 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.670
 may be what you can give them 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.940
 less the 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.580
 or maybe we give them 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.820
 the same lake but the difference is that 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.680
 despite less 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:30.820
 is what I like to sing be nothing more 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:32.850
 than thinking how they come and all the 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:36.130
 innovations all that all for 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.920
 dawn stops for example do this 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:41.650
 game render better this more than anything else 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:44.770
 I make for the game have better 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:48.780
 performance to what we have to do 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.780
 is for example count our games 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:56.200
 to the game and let's see a partner that 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.200
 have 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:04.580
 just as many I have the mode of 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.710
 many speak in window mode 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.640
 what's on my part not very well that 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.640
 lie metaphor 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.959
 very good now what we have to do 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.959
 is for example if they right click 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.830
 properties 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.870
 the compatibility here we select 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.569
 our 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:29.280
 windows 8 we are going to apply has liked 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:29.280
 have we play 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.840
 in fact 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.260
 only in theory you would have to 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.260
 be watching him 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.110
 the game 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:04.410
 pretty much the same way that no 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.410
 I know how to put the window 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:18.560
 with a gentleman forward 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.600
 in a radius that the games and those that already 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.400
 are seeing that but 80 two cases that 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:25.180
 do not do very well with the effort 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.180
 accomplished 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:31.569
 let us personalize it excuse me 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:34.720
 screen resolution if in any case 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:36.849
 that the cone does not go well and here 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:41.680
 you get low nothing puts you the resolution in the 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:46.660
 who has games in 1588 put it in that 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:49.209
 they have it in 1280 x 720 they put it in 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:51.370
 that they do have them in very 24 they put it in 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:53.530
 that in this case here I should not 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:56.349
 have put here that is where it is 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:58.010
 I have one as I have configurator on 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:00.500
 game s 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:03.079
 good but this would be all we already know 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:06.080
 they could record their game with the campaign 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:09.730
 studio 8 on windows 8 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.730
 see you until another video
