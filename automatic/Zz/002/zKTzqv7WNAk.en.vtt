00:00:01.329 --> 00:00:06.839
 explained here explained to me I am first and we wanted to test 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:08.229
 praises 

00:00:08.229 --> 00:00:10.189
 Leipzig Wai 

00:00:10.189 --> 00:00:11.269
 around 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:14.909
 I have said yes if not his will be forgiven again 

00:00:14.909 --> 00:00:17.289
 not supported my strength 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:21.499
 what is Robin Fly »2 Robin Fly» two side a little man 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:27.429
 they are exciting and praise from house to house their survive well 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:31.179
 the whole thing is a high score game 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.900
 a little bit insightful Do you mean one? 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.330
 I do not think so but now I want the option 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.660
 cute still imprinted 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.090
 Well then I'll show you the picture the gameplay 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:45.520
 more 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.410
 So this little man 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:48.830
 that one here now 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:53.680
 nice of being able to swing from house to house by the new guests 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.050
 to the tournament itself and runs well and that's just 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.240
 So we have to swim as far as possible 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.940
 and that is why we do not look at the ground appearance waves on the ground 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:06.220
 on hits 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.080
 around these molecules when their now what they are arguing with their feet 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.280
 Philly, your crisis 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.479
 and I'm a little pity pages that the races 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.210
 This little guy is going to play that percentage is just as well as his 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:20.320
 issues 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.980
 the human 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.450
 that's what he is for this point 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.070
 STS also moves Vision Doll and unfolds safely together like one 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.720
 Human would not fold up 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.720
 statements about this have also been made on purpose so 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.760
 it should not be a human but now I am 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.220
 Now she has seen when I died 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.020
 and of course my result is 890 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:46.760
 Coma from 8 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.180
 of the Torres trend, the meters will be his or my kilometer 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.880
 now swinging 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.750
 and then I can do "Your everything before and then this is all here at Opel 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.560
 fall 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.430
 Now you will start on top and I can also see what you decided 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.020
 have yourself and so on and so on 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.750
 but I'll do it 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.640
 and of course he VAC Neos clear and and legends play it again 

00:02:12.149 --> 00:02:14.829
 but now actually the option 

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:19.249
 Since we can adjust the burglar color this year men in radiant 

00:02:19.249 --> 00:02:22.249
 one knows at is unn 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:26.719
 then you can set the weather here HUNTING that is raining and 

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:30.560
 us-especially the special rains that Malik or 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.400
 Of course you can only set the sun 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.619
 or only 

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:36.259
 So just talk 

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:38.689
 but I'll leave everything on automatic 

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:41.709
 and percent then here Sauerland 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:44.369
 and also the secret of this 

00:02:44.369 --> 00:02:46.839
 Percent doorway fees purpose 

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:49.749
 which is a bit annoying with time 

00:02:49.749 --> 00:02:52.410
 but that's only here in a stream 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.020
 as opponents blueprints and could be other modes of play Abel there is not only 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:57.389
 here's freestyle 

00:02:57.389 --> 00:03:00.989
 Of course, there are a few more or even 30 seconds later 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:03.989
 At half-time, customers have time to swing as far as they can 

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:09.489
 Red 61 seconds and overturned course on time 500 meters 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:15.189
 You have time Athena limited time and the 500 meters to swing 

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:17.459
 then the race is over 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:18.649
 percent 

00:03:18.649 --> 00:03:21.849
 he can do it as fast as possible and a thousand meters too 

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:25.069
 and 2000 meters up and then of course 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:27.149
 have rhymed a rope 

00:03:27.149 --> 00:03:30.849
 and that means a rope and so far swinging this just goes 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:35.759
 his annual smile are also beautiful my little man is now black and white 

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:39.269
 I see the war 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:42.159
 the whole thing is just like that 

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:43.199
 around 

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:46.199
 then of course there is still 

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:50.499
 there are still three swinger money here so three ropes 

00:03:50.499 --> 00:03:55.119
 under the wars about ten ropes I'll show you ten ropes and then that is 

00:03:55.119 --> 00:03:58.649
 It may have been a short apple you but there is more over there 

00:03:58.649 --> 00:04:00.989
 not to say this game 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:03.289
 as a swingarm I quite nice 

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:05.729
 that was too short, of course 

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:07.259
 here the goal 

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:10.259
 what Wagner Gould 

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:14.139
 and while I came up on the floor 

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:17.379
 that they like difficulty of the game the power word is the game out 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.150
 Transics like Ghost only 80 cents 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.690
 around the left is always in the description to see if it is still like that 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:25.979
 is 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:29.570
 because most of the time when I said it then it can be that's been great 

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:33.530
 and that has become cheaper although only a time where I looked 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:34.900
 that was so cheap 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.360
 So always look if it really is like that 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.550
 if I always leave here on my talks Bivio that 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.550
 that is cheap or expensive 

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:49.970
 as always, but no one comments 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:52.230
 Do not forget to give stars I am glad
