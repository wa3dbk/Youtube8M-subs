compares the two cards which will give
you<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:55.950> better<00:01:56.130> idea<00:01:56.310> of<00:01:56.549> why<00:01:56.909> that<00:01:57.149> actually

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
you a better idea of why that actually

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.010 
you a better idea of why that actually
is<00:01:58.310> so<00:01:59.310> there<00:01:59.790> you<00:01:59.880> have<00:01:59.939> it<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.390> recommended

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
is so there you have it the recommended

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.359 
is so there you have it the recommended
specifications<00:02:01.860> for<00:02:02.630> FIFA<00:02:03.630> 16<00:02:04.290> hope<00:02:05.100> you<00:02:05.219> guys

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369
