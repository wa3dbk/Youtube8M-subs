00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:11.269
 hello today to us for sale 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:14.450
 such light bulbs came this light bulbs 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:17.030
 size byss roundabout for 10 LEDs 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:19.880
 but respectively 10 crystals of blue and 

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:22.369
 white and so i want along with 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.589
 you check how they shine these 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:27.589
 light bulbs made in china writes 

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:30.380
 chinatown as usual but now on 

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:33.579
 option I want to check how they shine 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:42.680
 I have a charger here 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:45.039
 let's see light bulbs it is 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.039
 tweet 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:57.260
 all crystals are located in principle 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:01:00.800
 exactly well soldered like light bulbs 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.269
 hands pretty decent here for such 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.960
 base or that is without basement 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:08.149
 light bulb envelope in turn and where they are 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.920
 still used in different models so 

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:16.610
 Here we have a stronger glow 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:19.670
 we connect 12 volts 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.560
 mean by the way polarity can 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.720
 confused by this light bulb don't burn it 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.119
 just doesn't shine like that 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:29.149
 blue color I do not know how it will be seen 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:32.210
 or invisible but shines normally bright 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:35.380
 shines despite the fact that now is still very much 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.380
 not a bad day outside 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:51.100
 so kupeshki demonstrate that there is and 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:54.790
 connect it wrong so you don't 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:02:02.560
 worried that she just will not light up 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:04.149
 and if you connect it again correctly then 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.880
 it will burn ie it will not burn 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:08.310
 if you initially confuse 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.020
 so if you initially confuse 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:19.330
 connection polarity about the window 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:28.090
 shining blue now let's see how 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:28.900
 shining white stand here too 10 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.989
 crystals 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:34.860
 also quite sane kind of light bulb all 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:39.000
 crystals in place are normally soldered 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:48.040
 light bulb smooth not skewed 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:50.519
 standard without base / plinth not 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.519
 have guessed 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:00.079
 guessed it like this white light bulb 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:12.270
 also pretty good glow 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:13.250
 taking into account that now the white day another 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:16.530
 yard 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:21.810
 so now I still wanted to try on how much 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:23.850
 does she consume her heroâ€™s current 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:27.470
 how do you know the led light bulb 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:33.269
 very efficient and economical 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:34.459
 then we put our tester mode 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:37.860
 measurements 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:40.830
 clamps an ammeter and insert 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:45.060
 successively break the chain 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:45.540
 positive terminal on it we catch positive 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:51.180
 probe 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:55.319
 tester and minus probe cling where 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:57.380
 removed the positive terminal and look at 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:04:00.680
 testimony 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:04.350
 the light is on the current consumption 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:13.609
 only zero zero zero 1 100 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:16.680
 milliamps and that is 10 to 10 milliamps 

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:23.039
 if so to translate into plain language that 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:25.919
 if you have a 4 amp battery and 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:28.860
 mile in milliampere it will be four 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:32.400
 thousand milliamps then this light bulb can 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:35.970
 shine from 4 1 battery 400 hours 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:38.160
 if you translate a day it's sixteen with 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:41.250
 half a day, of course, I don't count 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.960
 took the battery itself itself then 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:47.640
 there is a little result 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:50.700
 probably less that's all 

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:52.310
 buy these bulbs if necessary 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:56.300
 can be on the link below 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:56.300
 this will be all today
