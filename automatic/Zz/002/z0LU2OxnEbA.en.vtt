so it just allows us to try to get

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:32.000 
so it just allows us to try to get
everybody<00:04:28.490> needs<00:04:29.490> taken<00:04:29.940> care<00:04:29.970> of<00:04:30.500> we<00:04:31.500> always

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
everybody needs taken care of we always

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:33.590 
everybody needs taken care of we always
for<00:04:32.400> every<00:04:32.639> patient<00:04:32.790> want<00:04:33.150> to<00:04:33.240> provide<00:04:33.450> the

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
for every patient want to provide the

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.830 
for every patient want to provide the
best<00:04:33.750> dermatological<00:04:34.470> care<00:04:34.970> that<00:04:35.970> we<00:04:36.090> can<00:04:36.330> and

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.440 
best dermatological care that we can and

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:42.110 
I think having three providers allows us
to<00:04:39.750> do<00:04:39.870> that<00:04:40.020> for<00:04:40.169> our<00:04:40.260> patients<00:04:40.790> this<00:04:41.790> is<00:04:41.970> my
