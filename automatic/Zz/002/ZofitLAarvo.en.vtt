00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:05.730
 We present the development of the Finnish 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.919
 engineers in the former nokia new team 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.200
 the smartphone called the tree is translated from 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.820
 Finnish dinghy i rik small boat 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.160
 he works on his own operating room 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.800
 sailfish system sailfish 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.539
 let's start the review from the box it comes out 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.090
 for this there is a hole in 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.619
 cover here for this label glued 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.260
 the instruction manual you 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.779
 pulling the device itself like trifles but 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.000
 haven't taken the smartphone in your hand yet 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.550
 see what the manufacturer thought about 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.780
 to make you comfortable 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.410
 smartphone as if consists of two 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.540
 halves 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.910
 it is always convenient to take it with a flat 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.010
 surface the front part of the metal 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.170
 framed back half is removable 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.210
 the cover of our apparatus is white but with 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.180
 You can buy another panel 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.039
 colors on the top edge of the smartphone 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.750
 microphone headphone jack and jack 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.360
 to charge micro usb 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.300
 below the microphone and speaker on the right edge 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.329
 power button or screen lock and 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.219
 the volume rocker other buttons not in 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.930
 this principle of management yolo everything 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.119
 done with gestures 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.520
 on the back we see the rear camera 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.710
 capable of recording full video format 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.229
 hd and take pictures quite decent 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.540
 8 megapixel resolution nearby 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.610
 LED flash top 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.740
 screen traditionally located speaker and 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.020
 peephole front camera and crane 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.820
 4 and a half inch resolution 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.130
 960 to 540 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.259
 and it's not even modestly frankly small 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:33.000
 for comparison samsung galaxy s4 has 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:36.920
 game resolution of 1920 to 1080 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.140
 iphone 5s 1136 by 640 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.420
 the screen is scratch resistant does not have 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.220
 oleophobic coating theoretical 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.590
 fingerprints should not remain 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.630
 they of course remain but much less 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.430
 than for example on the fifth iPhone now 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.080
 let's see what this device has under 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.909
 lid she bangs curls easy 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.440
 movement if picked up and from the left 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:56.840
 lower angle as recommended 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:59.149
 developers under the covers and removable 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.759
 battery slot for micro sim card and 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:03.500
 slot for micro sd card to 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:05.600
 insert both cards do not need to touch 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.060
 The battery can not even be at all 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.670
 turn off the device rubber tag 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.300
 moves away and Simka conveniently enters 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.819
 nest 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.380
 Similarly , the memory card then the back 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:18.860
 the cover snaps easily 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.750
 battery capacity 2000 what microampere 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.120
 This is much more than the fifth iPhone 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.160
 but apparently the device is quite energy-intensive 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.230
 because manufacturers promise work 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.769
 talk time for just 9 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.620
 o'clock 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:32.540
 the fifth iPhone on the passport 10 as 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.350
 shows practice charging ate very 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.360
 about 4 hours long talk time 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:40.190
 not very active internet browsing and 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.750
 rare listening to music keep 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.269
 charge a little less than two days 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.130
 very convenient that after warning about 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:48.739
 the low charge smartphone is still pretty 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.269
 long running machine equipped 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:52.910
 dual-core processor with a clock 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:55.070
 line 1 and 4 tenths gigahertz 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.900
 RAM 1 gigabyte is 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:58.640
 modestly but not so little 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:02.480
 spoil usage impressions 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:04.880
 smartphone's own memory 16 gigabytes 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.510
 expands with help without cartes and 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.489
 capacities to 60 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.220
 3 gigabyte theoretical device 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.750
 supports ltr format connection but 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.590
 practice, we all saw only 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.549
 inscription 3g with very decent 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.560
 8 megapixel camera in smartphone 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:21.569
 There are many manual settings 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.700
 photography which is most simple 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:26.190
 users of the camera background will not be needed 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:29.069
 but there is something that really like 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:32.340
 lovers of selfies delay shooting for whole 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:34.290
 15 seconds go to the lack of appearance 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.120
 y'all be thought out to the smallest detail a 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.870
 That is the meaning of filling is so far 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.450
 damp 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.640
 body works as already said on 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.500
 own operating system selfish 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.720
 the application should look for your own 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.190
 yolo's store and when you go into it 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.599
 you will see what to look for there 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.250
 nothing except 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:52.230
 mail client alarm calendar 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.840
 more applications native to this 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.519
 smartphone and some games part 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.049
 developers have made their sale fashion 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:59.940
 compatible with android 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:02.190
 can theoretically be set 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.139
 androids ski apps for this 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.940
 you must install from yolo 

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:08.250
 program for android support 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.470
 after installation you will find that nothing 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.730
 hasn't changed don't be scared 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.799
 reboot the machine 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:17.070
 then an icon will appear on the desktop 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:18.810
 index top is the same store in 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.699
 which you can already look for something with 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.989
 first attempts to establish familiar 

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:23.729
 application comes some 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:24.870
 disappointment for example you have 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:27.720
 front-camera 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:29.970
 but you don't find skype from popular 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.340
 messengers manage to install in veider 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:34.349
 yolo offers another store 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.510
 aptoide appstore which is installed 

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:38.639
 as a separate application in it a choice 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:40.050
 more you can install and skype and 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:42.000
 some other applications 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:45.280
 but a complete set of which is at 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.620
 owners of android gadgets will not be 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.750
 google play market is not supported and 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.700
 finding the aptoide applications requested 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:53.440
 Leaves you to other stores 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.970
 from one we really download 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.600
 whose application previously could not 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.930
 to find 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:00.610
 more precisely its installation file is at it all 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:03.280
 ends because run 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:05.800
 the installation fails it is possible that we 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.450
 something is understood wrong but the developers 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.360
 no one promised to use 

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:11.620
 only dota will be the smartphone 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.540
 the keyboard installed in y'all has 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:15.310
 autocorrection autochange options and 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:16.570
 word substitution from the dictionary which 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:18.790
 very quickly replenished 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:20.530
 but there were some bugs here too 

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:22.780
 when you try to fix for example 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:23.890
 endings are substituted for words begin 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.990
 afraid of the first letters 

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:28.060
 but it is very convenient that on the desktop 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:30.850
 remain tiles with your last 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:33.340
 actions calls and SMS records in 

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:33.940
 calendar so all that you often 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:36.250
 are using 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:38.080
 constantly at your fingertips like 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:40.360
 way the phone book is organized 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:42.970
 favorite contacts always top 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:44.919
 whole if we take that before us first 

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:47.080
 the brainchild of the developer would she be next 

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:49.690
 you can improve then yolo 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:51.729
 recognize a promising smartphone true 

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:53.860
 he is unlikely to be interested in conservative 

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:56.229
 consumers and the price for such 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:58.660
 beginner too big an average of 20 thousand 

00:05:56.229 --> 00:06:01.030
 rubles yolo like those who are in 

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:02.890
 nokia pushbuttons appreciate simplicity 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:05.350
 and convenience of telephone functions 

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:08.070
 and now wants to combine them with joy 

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:08.070
 smartphone
