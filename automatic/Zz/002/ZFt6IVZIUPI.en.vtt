David you've been through the pitlane
ones<00:01:38.280> presumably<00:01:38.700> because<00:01:38.850> you've<00:01:39.060> got<00:01:39.210> extra

fuel<00:01:39.810> on<00:01:39.990> board<00:01:40.020> you<00:01:40.320> can<00:01:40.470> feel<00:01:40.680> how<00:01:40.830> you<00:01:40.890> want

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.190 
fuel on board you can feel how you want

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:42.260 
fuel on board you can feel how you want
after<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.610> top<00:01:41.820> ten

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270

well<00:01:42.630> how<00:01:42.720> does<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.930> track<00:01:43.140> feel<00:01:44.240> well<00:01:45.240> it's

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 
well how does the track feel well it's

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.960 
well how does the track feel well it's
very<00:01:45.420> windy<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:46.080> it's<00:01:46.710> quite<00:01:46.920> dusty<00:01:47.130> so<00:01:47.730> the

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
very windy and it's quite dusty so the

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.460 
very windy and it's quite dusty so the
track<00:01:48.150> conditions<00:01:48.630> seem<00:01:48.840> a<00:01:48.870> little<00:01:49.080> bit<00:01:49.290> worse

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
track conditions seem a little bit worse

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.470 
track conditions seem a little bit worse
than<00:01:49.710> qualifying<00:01:50.190> yesterday<00:01:50.670> so<00:01:51.210> I<00:01:51.240> would

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:51.480 
than qualifying yesterday so I would

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.480 
than qualifying yesterday so I would
expect<00:01:51.780> to<00:01:51.900> see<00:01:52.110> some<00:01:52.470> cars<00:01:52.740> walking<00:01:53.250> and<00:01:53.430> all

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
expect to see some cars walking and all

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.520 
expect to see some cars walking and all
those<00:01:53.610> having<00:01:53.880> difficulties<00:01:54.360> okay<00:01:55.170> now<00:01:55.350> we've

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
those having difficulties okay now we've

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.860 
those having difficulties okay now we've
seen<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.890> GP<00:01:56.520> to<00:01:56.550> the<00:01:56.940> Formula<00:01:57.270> BMW<00:01:57.300> the

seen the GP to the Formula BMW the

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:59.540 
seen the GP to the Formula BMW the
Porsches<00:01:58.230> they<00:01:58.320> all<00:01:58.500> steaming<00:01:59.010> the<00:01:59.100> term<00:01:59.310> one

00:01:59.540 --> 00:01:59.550 
Porsches they all steaming the term one

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:01.430 
Porsches they all steaming the term one
and<00:01:59.730> get<00:01:59.850> through<00:02:00.180> but<00:02:00.690> in<00:02:00.780> Formula<00:02:01.170> One<00:02:01.320> it

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:01.440 
and get through but in Formula One it

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.020 
and get through but in Formula One it
often<00:02:01.710> doesn't<00:02:01.890> happen<00:02:02.040> why<00:02:02.430> is<00:02:02.490> that<00:02:02.640> you<00:02:02.910> the

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
often doesn't happen why is that you the

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.360 
often doesn't happen why is that you the

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:05.370 
best drivers in the world because we've

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.430 
best drivers in the world because we've
got<00:02:05.550> carbon<00:02:05.820> brakes<00:02:06.270> that<00:02:06.690> work<00:02:06.870> at<00:02:07.050> such<00:02:07.230> high

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
got carbon brakes that work at such high

temperatures that from a standing start
they're<00:02:10.200> suboptimal<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:11.580> only<00:02:11.820> time<00:02:12.030> we

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
they're suboptimal the only time we

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:13.730 
they're suboptimal the only time we

really practice that is at the start of

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
a Grand Prix and it's combination of

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.620 
a Grand Prix and it's combination of
that<00:02:16.860> tire<00:02:17.400> pressures<00:02:17.940> you've<00:02:18.150> seen<00:02:18.360> with<00:02:18.540> the

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
that tire pressures you've seen with the

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.720 
that tire pressures you've seen with the
safety<00:02:19.020> cars<00:02:19.230> this<00:02:19.410> year<00:02:19.470> a<00:02:19.980> lot<00:02:20.400> of<00:02:20.520> drivers

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
safety cars this year a lot of drivers

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.940 
safety cars this year a lot of drivers
having<00:02:21.000> difficulty<00:02:21.510> heating<00:02:21.840> the<00:02:21.959> tyres<00:02:21.990> it's

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
having difficulty heating the tyres it's

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.680 
having difficulty heating the tyres it's
just<00:02:23.190> the<00:02:23.280> way<00:02:23.370> the<00:02:23.490> tire<00:02:23.700> evolution<00:02:24.300> has<00:02:24.450> gone

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
just the way the tire evolution has gone

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.900 
just the way the tire evolution has gone
and<00:02:24.990> you<00:02:25.860> bring<00:02:25.980> all<00:02:26.130> those<00:02:26.250> factors<00:02:26.760> together

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
and you bring all those factors together

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.870 
and you bring all those factors together
it<00:02:27.900> becomes<00:02:28.560> very<00:02:28.770> much<00:02:28.950> a<00:02:29.010> lottery<00:02:29.520> trying<00:02:29.790> to

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
it becomes very much a lottery trying to

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.090 
it becomes very much a lottery trying to
get<00:02:30.030> the<00:02:30.209> right<00:02:30.690> braking<00:02:31.050> point<00:02:31.260> inside<00:02:31.920> or

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
get the right braking point inside or

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.460 
get the right braking point inside or
outside<00:02:32.250> for<00:02:32.670> turn<00:02:32.850> one<00:02:33.090> I<00:02:33.270> always<00:02:34.110> favor

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
outside for turn one I always favor

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.980 
outside for turn one I always favor
inside<00:02:34.920> because<00:02:35.370> at<00:02:35.610> least<00:02:35.700> at<00:02:36.690> least<00:02:36.750> you

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
inside because at least at least you

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.040 
inside because at least at least you
can't<00:02:37.230> get<00:02:37.380> collected<00:02:37.830> top<00:02:38.310> man's<00:02:38.520> knee<00:02:38.700> later

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
can't get collected top man's knee later

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.449 
can't get collected top man's knee later
let's<00:02:40.050> head<00:02:40.230> over<00:02:40.260> and<00:02:40.560> see<00:02:40.739> if<00:02:40.800> physic

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
let's head over and see if physic

let's head over and see if physic
colours<00:02:41.760> managed<00:02:42.540> to<00:02:42.690> get<00:02:42.840> back<00:02:43.080> yet

Ralph how are those Bridgestone tires
Michaels<00:02:53.760> on<00:02:53.880> the<00:02:54.030> same<00:02:54.239> yeah<00:02:54.480> how<00:02:54.660> are<00:02:54.750> they

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
Michaels on the same yeah how are they

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.650 
Michaels on the same yeah how are they
going<00:02:54.989> to<00:02:55.080> be<00:02:55.200> there<00:02:55.860> any<00:02:56.220> degradation<00:02:56.630> no<00:02:57.630> I

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
going to be there any degradation no I

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.570 
going to be there any degradation no I
don't<00:02:58.019> think<00:02:58.260> we<00:02:58.410> will<00:02:58.650> have<00:02:58.860> a<00:02:59.010> problem<00:02:59.400> there

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
don't think we will have a problem there

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.400 
don't think we will have a problem there
I<00:02:59.610> think<00:02:59.790> on<00:03:00.090> the<00:03:00.239> tire<00:03:00.660> side<00:03:00.959> we<00:03:01.050> have<00:03:01.170> four

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
I think on the tire side we have four

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.800 
I think on the tire side we have four
left<00:03:02.100> the<00:03:02.280> upper<00:03:02.550> side<00:03:02.760> this<00:03:03.239> weekend<00:03:03.690> and

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
left the upper side this weekend and

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.330 
left the upper side this weekend and
compared<00:03:04.140> to<00:03:04.200> Mitch<00:03:04.320> Lowe<00:03:04.500> what<00:03:05.190> are<00:03:05.250> you

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
compared to Mitch Lowe what are you

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.740 
compared to Mitch Lowe what are you
looking<00:03:05.580> for<00:03:05.730> today<00:03:05.790> just<00:03:06.150> points<00:03:06.540> you'd<00:03:06.660> be

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
looking for today just points you'd be

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:07.940 
looking for today just points you'd be
satisfied<00:03:07.230> where<00:03:07.440> though<00:03:07.530> you<00:03:07.650> think<00:03:07.739> you<00:03:07.860> can

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
satisfied where though you think you can

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:08.240 
satisfied where though you think you can
do<00:03:08.010> better

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
do better

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:09.920 
do better
certainly<00:03:08.730> for<00:03:08.880> where<00:03:09.060> I<00:03:09.090> am<00:03:09.209> you<00:03:09.690> know<00:03:09.720> it's

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
certainly for where I am you know it's

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.900 
certainly for where I am you know it's
gonna<00:03:10.019> be<00:03:10.200> difficult<00:03:10.350> days<00:03:10.769> that's<00:03:11.100> sure<00:03:11.459> our

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
gonna be difficult days that's sure our

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.759 
gonna be difficult days that's sure our
pace<00:03:12.180> was<00:03:12.390> decent<00:03:12.870> but<00:03:13.050> I'm<00:03:13.110> not<00:03:13.260> really<00:03:13.530> good

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
pace was decent but I'm not really good

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:15.500 
pace was decent but I'm not really good
enough<00:03:13.830> to<00:03:14.160> compete<00:03:14.700> with<00:03:14.940> the<00:03:15.030> top<00:03:15.150> runners

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
enough to compete with the top runners

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.360 
enough to compete with the top runners
so<00:03:15.660> anything<00:03:16.080> between<00:03:16.230> fifth<00:03:16.680> and<00:03:16.890> seventh<00:03:17.310> be

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
so anything between fifth and seventh be

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:18.860 
so anything between fifth and seventh be
a<00:03:17.400> great<00:03:17.670> result<00:03:17.940> have<00:03:18.269> a<00:03:18.330> great<00:03:18.510> one<00:03:18.630> we'll<00:03:18.780> be

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
a great result have a great one we'll be

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.500 
a great result have a great one we'll be
looking<00:03:18.959> out<00:03:19.230> for<00:03:19.470> you<00:03:19.970> let's<00:03:20.970> see<00:03:21.120> if<00:03:21.180> we<00:03:21.269> can

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
looking out for you let's see if we can

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.590 
looking out for you let's see if we can
just<00:03:22.170> have<00:03:22.380> a<00:03:22.410> final<00:03:23.100> word<00:03:23.280> with<00:03:23.580> button<00:03:24.030> and

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
just have a final word with button and

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:25.940 
just have a final word with button and
now<00:03:24.690> we<00:03:24.720> spoke<00:03:25.050> to<00:03:25.170> him<00:03:25.290> earlier<00:03:25.320> on<00:03:25.709> in<00:03:25.860> the

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
now we spoke to him earlier on in the

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.360 
now we spoke to him earlier on in the
program<00:03:26.130> and<00:03:26.870> let's<00:03:27.870> just<00:03:27.989> see<00:03:28.230> what<00:03:28.920> he's

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
program and let's just see what he's

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.240 
program and let's just see what he's
learned<00:03:29.820> as<00:03:30.209> he's<00:03:30.540> now<00:03:31.410> he's<00:03:31.530> in<00:03:31.680> the<00:03:31.800> top<00:03:31.980> ten

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
learned as he's now he's in the top ten

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.430 
learned as he's now he's in the top ten
so<00:03:32.459> they've<00:03:32.610> all<00:03:32.790> they've<00:03:33.330> all<00:03:33.510> crept<00:03:34.080> around

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
so they've all they've all crept around

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.910 
so they've all they've all crept around
trying<00:03:35.160> not<00:03:35.310> to<00:03:35.370> use<00:03:35.700> any<00:03:36.390> more<00:03:36.720> fuel<00:03:37.320> so

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
into you yeah now you do I mean the

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.250 
into you yeah now you do I mean the
first<00:04:20.640> lap<00:04:20.850> is<00:04:20.970> never<00:04:21.180> that<00:04:21.390> you<00:04:21.959> know<00:04:22.080> hot

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
first lap is never that you know hot

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:23.960 
first lap is never that you know hot
anyway<00:04:22.470> because<00:04:22.830> you've<00:04:22.980> got<00:04:23.160> cold<00:04:23.310> tyres<00:04:23.580> and

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
anyway because you've got cold tyres and

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.180 
anyway because you've got cold tyres and
it's<00:04:24.090> the<00:04:24.450> tire<00:04:24.660> is<00:04:24.870> your<00:04:25.050> limit<00:04:25.380> limiting

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
it's the tire is your limit limiting

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.850 
it's the tire is your limit limiting
factor<00:04:26.640> so<00:04:26.910> it's<00:04:27.330> not<00:04:27.480> the<00:04:27.600> wind<00:04:27.780> but<00:04:28.590> when<00:04:28.740> you

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
factor so it's not the wind but when you

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.470 
factor so it's not the wind but when you
love<00:04:29.400> the<00:04:29.550> steering<00:04:29.760> wheel<00:04:29.970> into<00:04:30.150> the<00:04:30.240> first
