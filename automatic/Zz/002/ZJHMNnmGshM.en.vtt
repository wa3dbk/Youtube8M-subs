tutorial how to dial eight a pupil four

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.450 
tutorial how to dial eight a pupil four
it's<00:00:06.120> an<00:00:06.210> effect<00:00:06.480> you<00:00:07.319> can<00:00:07.440> use<00:00:07.470> it<00:00:07.680> for<00:00:07.890> scenes

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
it's an effect you can use it for scenes

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.499 
it's an effect you can use it for scenes
to<00:00:08.700> do<00:00:08.820> with<00:00:09.769> like<00:00:10.769> a<00:00:10.800> drug-induced<00:00:11.550> scene<00:00:12.210> or

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
to do with like a drug-induced scene or

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.419 
to do with like a drug-induced scene or
we<00:00:12.599> can<00:00:12.719> do<00:00:12.809> monster<00:00:13.530> transformation<00:00:14.219> scene

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
we can do monster transformation scene

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.189 
we can do monster transformation scene
where<00:00:14.610> the<00:00:14.730> eyes<00:00:14.849> go<00:00:14.880> a<00:00:15.420> different<00:00:15.809> color<00:00:16.020> or

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
where the eyes go a different color or

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:17.779 
where the eyes go a different color or
something<00:00:16.379> like<00:00:16.560> that<00:00:16.619> this<00:00:17.430> is<00:00:17.580> what<00:00:17.670> we're

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
something like that this is what we're

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.840 
something like that this is what we're
actually<00:00:17.910> going<00:00:18.210> for<00:00:18.510> today<00:00:22.369> as<00:00:23.369> you<00:00:23.580> can<00:00:23.670> see

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
actually going for today as you can see

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.109 
actually going for today as you can see
looks<00:00:24.689> pretty<00:00:24.930> convincing<00:00:25.910> it's<00:00:26.910> really

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
looks pretty convincing it's really

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.370 
looks pretty convincing it's really
simple<00:00:27.330> effect<00:00:27.630> and<00:00:27.750> had<00:00:27.840> it<00:00:27.930> and<00:00:28.080> how<00:00:28.199> to<00:00:28.260> do

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
simple effect and had it and how to do

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.640 
simple effect and had it and how to do
it<00:00:28.410> as<00:00:28.529> well<00:00:28.740> so<00:00:28.769> you<00:00:29.010> basically<00:00:30.619> will<00:00:31.619> have

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
it as well so you basically will have

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.709 
it as well so you basically will have
your<00:00:32.189> eye<00:00:32.219> footage<00:00:32.669> which<00:00:32.880> is<00:00:33.000> we<00:00:33.180> have<00:00:33.210> here

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
your eye footage which is we have here

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.459 
your eye footage which is we have here
within<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.320> main<00:00:34.649> timeline<00:00:34.920> like<00:00:35.280> so<00:00:36.440> when<00:00:37.440> I

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
within the main timeline like so when I

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.799 
within the main timeline like so when I
go<00:00:37.680> up<00:00:38.219> to<00:00:38.280> inducing<00:00:39.120> After<00:00:39.329> Effects<00:00:39.570> by<00:00:39.750> the

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
go up to inducing After Effects by the

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.410 
go up to inducing After Effects by the
way<00:00:39.960> I'm<00:00:40.649> going<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:40.800> go<00:00:40.950> to<00:00:42.890> layout<00:00:43.890> new<00:00:44.550> null

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
way I'm going to go to layout new null

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.020 
way I'm going to go to layout new null
object<00:00:47.600> select<00:00:48.600> an<00:00:48.750> object<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.320> press<00:00:49.379> Enter

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
and call this one tracking you basically

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.130 
and call this one tracking you basically
want<00:00:57.480> to<00:00:57.829> select<00:00:58.829> your<00:00:59.039> main<00:00:59.280> footage<00:01:00.140> you

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
want to select your main footage you

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.389 
want to select your main footage you
need<00:01:01.289> to<00:01:01.440> track<00:01:01.680> this<00:01:01.829> footage<00:01:02.129> because<00:01:02.250> if

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
need to track this footage because if

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:03.560 
need to track this footage because if
you<00:01:02.489> actually<00:01:02.640> look<00:01:02.910> at<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.059> footage<00:01:03.329> you<00:01:03.390> see

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
you actually look at the footage you see

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.649 
you actually look at the footage you see
that<00:01:03.750> it's<00:01:03.870> actually<00:01:04.019> moving<00:01:04.470> around<00:01:05.659> and

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
that it's actually moving around and

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.719 
that it's actually moving around and
what'll<00:01:06.869> happen<00:01:07.020> is<00:01:07.170> if<00:01:07.320> you<00:01:07.500> have<00:01:07.580> if<00:01:08.580> you

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
what'll happen is if you have if you

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.789 
what'll happen is if you have if you
create<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.210> dilating<00:01:10.049> pupil<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.409> your<00:01:10.530> foods

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
create the dilating pupil and your foods

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.380 
create the dilating pupil and your foods
are<00:01:10.860> moving<00:01:11.100> around<00:01:11.189> it'll<00:01:11.610> be<00:01:11.640> in<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.119> center

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
are moving around it'll be in the center

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.929 
are moving around it'll be in the center
Center<00:01:12.930> and<00:01:13.080> your<00:01:13.200> you<00:01:13.500> actually<00:01:13.680> won't<00:01:13.979> look

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
Center and your you actually won't look

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.539 
Center and your you actually won't look
realistic<00:01:15.450> because<00:01:15.570> it<00:01:15.930> won't<00:01:16.110> be<00:01:16.549> matching

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
realistic because it won't be matching

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.070 
realistic because it won't be matching
the<00:01:17.729> footage<00:01:18.090> it<00:01:18.150> might<00:01:18.270> be<00:01:18.390> stuck<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:19.020> the

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
the footage it might be stuck to the

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.730 
the footage it might be stuck to the
footage<00:01:19.820> so<00:01:20.820> you<00:01:21.150> go<00:01:21.360> over<00:01:21.479> here<00:01:21.810> to<00:01:22.140> your

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
footage so you go over here to your

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.100 
footage so you go over here to your
track<00:01:23.070> motion<00:01:23.490> option<00:01:24.360> on<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.869> tracker

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
use it lets you select your main footage

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.940 
use it lets you select your main footage
in<00:01:35.009> my<00:01:35.369> case<00:01:35.610> is<00:01:35.729> called<00:01:35.850> i<00:01:36.119> main<00:01:36.890> you<00:01:37.890> know

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
in my case is called i main you know

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.789 
in my case is called i main you know
track<00:01:38.250> motion<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:39.450> we're<00:01:40.320> going<00:01:40.439> to<00:01:40.500> track

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
track motion and we're going to track

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.969 
track motion and we're going to track
the<00:01:41.280> rotation<00:01:41.970> as<00:01:42.060> well<00:01:42.680> and<00:01:43.680> you<00:01:43.740> want<00:01:43.860> to

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
the rotation as well and you want to

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.600 
the rotation as well and you want to
pick<00:01:45.500> if<00:01:46.500> you<00:01:46.680> look<00:01:46.860> here<00:01:47.009> you<00:01:47.100> want<00:01:47.220> to<00:01:47.280> pick

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
pick if you look here you want to pick

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.889 
pick if you look here you want to pick
say<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.659> corner<00:01:48.990> of<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.170> eye<00:01:50.750> because<00:01:51.750> it

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
say the corner of the eye because it

00:01:51.899 --> 00:02:00.660 
say the corner of the eye because it
doesn't<00:01:52.140> really<00:01:52.259> change<00:01:52.409> much<00:01:53.009> and<00:01:54.079> maybe<00:01:55.079> the

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.940 

maybe<00:02:01.670> easy<00:02:02.180> edge<00:02:02.690> of<00:02:02.840> the<00:02:02.930> eyeballs<00:02:03.320> and<00:02:03.530> I

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
maybe easy edge of the eyeballs and I

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.120 
maybe easy edge of the eyeballs and I
probably<00:02:04.160> would<00:02:04.430> go<00:02:04.580> with<00:02:06.010> corner<00:02:07.010> of<00:02:07.070> your

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
probably would go with corner of your

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:14.500 
probably would go with corner of your
eye<00:02:07.220> down<00:02:07.430> here<00:02:12.820> the<00:02:13.820> whole<00:02:14.000> idea<00:02:14.210> is<00:02:14.240> that

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
eye down here the whole idea is that

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.270 
eye down here the whole idea is that
you've<00:02:14.660> selected<00:02:14.840> that<00:02:15.080> now<00:02:15.320> you<00:02:15.380> go<00:02:15.620> analyze

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
you've selected that now you go analyze

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:24.380 
you've selected that now you go analyze
forward<00:02:16.760> down<00:02:16.970> here

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.020 

okay<00:02:25.080> that's<00:02:25.320> pretty<00:02:25.500> good<00:02:25.620> if<00:02:26.190> the<00:02:26.520> tracking

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
okay that's pretty good if the tracking

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.790 
okay that's pretty good if the tracking
points<00:02:27.420> move<00:02:27.630> around<00:02:27.810> too<00:02:28.020> much<00:02:28.050> whilst<00:02:28.530> is

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
points move around too much whilst is

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.200 
points move around too much whilst is
tracking<00:02:29.160> it<00:02:29.250> means<00:02:29.400> it's<00:02:29.550> not<00:02:29.670> in<00:02:29.730> a<00:02:29.910> secure

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
tracking it means it's not in a secure

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.570 
tracking it means it's not in a secure
spot<00:02:30.560> and<00:02:31.560> then<00:02:31.710> we'll<00:02:31.800> make<00:02:31.920> the<00:02:32.040> effect<00:02:32.340> look

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
spot and then we'll make the effect look

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:33.980 
spot and then we'll make the effect look
not<00:02:32.940> quite<00:02:33.150> as<00:02:33.270> good<00:02:33.420> so<00:02:33.630> you<00:02:33.690> want<00:02:33.840> to<00:02:33.900> make

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
not quite as good so you want to make
