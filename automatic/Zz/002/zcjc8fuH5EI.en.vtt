 p 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.160
 I was born in Brazil and started playing soccer when I was eight years old 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.200
 I love football and I had a lot of fun training and having a good time 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.430
 that was the purpose of football is my life when I was just a kid 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.690
 Currently in my life and my career, I set goals and objectives 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:02.530
 and for that 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.530
 everything I do has an address and purpose 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.610
 I think this is what gives me the motivation to strive for my 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.610
 dreams 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.490
 control 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.640
 in 2000 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.260
 I played for the youth team of Sao Paulo 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.400
 and in the middle of the championship he received a yellow card 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.100
 they suspended him for a game so I took advantage of the free weekend that 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.100
 I had to visit my grandparents 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.950
 my brother and I were an amusement water park 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.710
 pires and anti-Cuban salome I hit my head with the bottom of the pool my 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.170
 neck broke 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.170
 I had fractured the sixth vertebra 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.170
 I returned to the training sessions Sao Paulo but I could not stand the 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.940
 pain all including doctors 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.140
 they told me that I was very lucky 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.780
 I could be paralyzed and lose my ability to walk and play soccer 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.780
 but I do not think it was luck I think god was 

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:11.890
 I started playing again in 2001 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.770
 and almost after two weeks they called me to play on the team 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.959
 professional sao paulo 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.149
 I think God had a purpose in that accident 

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:24.899
 and I think it was not a coincidence, it was something that happened just before we started 

00:02:24.899 --> 00:02:27.899
 blessing of my career as a professional player 

00:02:27.899 --> 00:02:30.899
 It was a great experience of my life 

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:36.719
 kaká is a very special person 

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:40.439
 since the qualifiers of the world cup in 2001 

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:43.779
 we played together in the national team of brazil 

00:02:43.779 --> 00:02:46.550
 we are friends your character 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:52.430
 it is faultless and all the time that I have known him his walk with God is a 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:53.159
 example for 

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:56.159
 all of us rather 

00:02:57.649 --> 00:02:59.989
 losing is part of the game 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:03.939
 we play two or three games a week and we have one if we lose others 

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:07.029
 but defeats can teach us 

00:03:07.029 --> 00:03:09.809
 and it can be a time for reflection 

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:11.559
 it's hard 

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:16.309
 I have defeats that have marked my life like losing the cup final 

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:19.309
 World of 2006 against France 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:22.359
 I have also had many victories 

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:23.709
 but the defeats 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:26.709
 in the end 

00:03:33.649 --> 00:03:37.469
 in 2002 I played for the Brazilian team for the first time I was 20 years old 

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:41.789
 it's a feeling that goes beyond words 

00:03:43.029 --> 00:03:45.489
 the first time I heard the national anthem 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:48.279
 the foot singing it with the national team 

00:03:48.279 --> 00:03:50.109
 and with the whole stadium 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:53.109
 It gave me great emotion 

00:03:56.199 --> 00:04:01.049
 in the 2002 world cup I played only 25 minutes in a game against 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:01.999
 Costa Rica 

00:04:01.999 --> 00:04:04.639
 but I felt like a world champion 

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:08.689
 when the final whistle sounded in the last game the court ran and 

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:11.689
 The only thing I could do was glorify and thank God 

00:04:12.249 --> 00:04:15.969
 I knew that everyone was watching the game millions and millions of 

00:04:15.969 --> 00:04:18.389
 people stuck to the TV 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:21.719
 the great emotion of being a champion was almost too much 

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:25.180
 so with him neither sun nor pike we swear together 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.389
 for me and it was really special to be in that group and be world champion in 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:30.689
 the 2002 

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:35.409
 my big dream for the 2010 world cup is to win one more title with the 

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:38.409
 Brazil's selection 

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:44.290
 the fact of playing with a great team 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:48.470
 playing in the national team the fact of having a wife and family that 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:49.229
 support 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:52.379
 just show me that I need god 

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:54.479
 for all these demands 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:58.530
 I think it's in these moments that we need more assets 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:03.100
 I always tell people including my wife and children that they need to look 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:06.560
 first active and he will take care of what remains 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.990
 regardless of what you have chijeré the basins center what 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:14.990
 Does that part of your job or your profession 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.889
 jesus cid 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:20.199
 lover the same way 

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:22.949
 for me I say this when I won 

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:25.949
 when I lose or even when he died 

00:05:26.939 --> 00:05:31.639
 in the eyes of God I am the same person and the menu will continue to command 

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:33.240
 in the same way 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.240
 I think this is what brings us all to him 

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:46.270
 we have a father who loves us and has a plan for us 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:49.059
 I'm not talking about a fairy tale god 

00:05:49.059 --> 00:05:52.849
 I'm talking about a god that I experienced and that has changed my life 

00:05:52.849 --> 00:05:56.879
 and that changes and transforms me every day in a very ugly way 

00:05:56.879 --> 00:05:59.879
 year 

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:03.409
 I want to share with you a spiritual secret 

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:06.490
 when we got married my wife and I were virgins 

00:06:07.119 --> 00:06:10.209
 I'm not going to tell you that it was easy because there were many temptations 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:14.050
 We spent a lot of time praying and walking near Jesus 

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:17.860
 It was a great challenge but it was worth having waited 

00:06:20.009 --> 00:06:24.590
 I am living many of my dreams the bible tells us that God is capable of 

00:06:24.589 --> 00:06:28.290
 do immensely more than what we ask or imagine 

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:31.290
 and I think this is what has happened in my life 

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:36.090
 I play soccer because I have a talent given by God and he has perfected that 

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:41.419
 talent in my life jesus said apart from it can do anything and I believe it 

00:06:41.419 --> 00:06:42.889
 jesus said 

00:06:42.889 --> 00:06:47.969
 I am the way the truth and life nobody comes to the father but is for me 

00:06:47.969 --> 00:06:52.569
 God gave me a second chance and he accepted me as his son and is not a 

00:06:52.569 --> 00:06:55.969
 sacrifice on the cross for me 

00:06:55.969 --> 00:07:00.269
 if only football had a fame a title if it did not have goodbye it would not be 

00:07:00.269 --> 00:07:01.059
 happy 

00:07:01.059 --> 00:07:02.449
 undoubtedly 

00:07:02.449 --> 00:07:06.520
 Today I can say that God has done things in my life that I could never have 

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:09.129
 imagined 

00:07:09.129 --> 00:07:10.930
 in the end 

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:13.169
 with game pointed 

00:07:13.169 --> 00:07:16.169
