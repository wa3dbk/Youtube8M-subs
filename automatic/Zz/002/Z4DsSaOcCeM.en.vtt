00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.460
 hello, what am I like, give and come to me 

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:07.740
 channel today I bring you with the new 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:11.850
 difficult dribbles 15 I bring you a tutorial 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.440
 I hope you serve us are three vouchers are 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:15.030
 three dribbles although the truth is 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.910
 variations of some dribbles that already 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.910
 they were and well this game you put 

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:32.720
 is worth the new variation of the elastic 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.670
 chop you have to make the elastic made 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:39.120
 normal just by holding down l 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:43.240
 tv2 in play let's do it 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:46.780
 yes, it is left 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:48.730
 the bad thing has come out, you see that 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:52.270
 give the lt as it protects the ball but 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:57.100
 well it's done like that blind down 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:58.719
 left up in this position 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:03.040
 Running can also be done 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:06.190
 perfectly lte down and right 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:09.330
 down left it's easy it's easy it's easy 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:11.780
 to do the bad thing is that 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.240
 by holding down from sometimes 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.740
 will protect the balcony but 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.049
 to see stopped 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.159
 and so the bad is done is that but good 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.159
 it's practical and it's 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.090
 new dribble although he was already in the 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.850
 World Cup game then dribble for fifa 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.410
 15 the variation of the roulette is similar 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.080
 to the hawk malki is a mixture between 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:49.100
 machine and roulettes I would say I have to 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.630
 make a diagonal 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.860
 for example if you want to go down 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.610
 you have to make a diagonal towards 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.610
 down like this 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:02.070
 zakarÃ­a then it would be leonard up 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:04.020
 here diagonally downward 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.120
 is making diagonals where 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.470
 do you want to go 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.960
 OK 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.780
 but it is very simple besides that it has 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:17.590
 I look to be very very effective and it 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:21.370
 we will see many diagonal montages 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:24.990
 diagonal which is now very easy very 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.990
 easy and very effective 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.540
 new dribble this time it's the turn of 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.840
 the elastic waves everything to call it 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:45.990
 you have to press lt because it's another 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:49.730
 variation so you have to do this 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.730
 vouchers is a love from below 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:57.950
 down and semicircular you have to make a 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:59.959
 semicircle for me better first the 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.730
 down and then half circle I 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:05.180
 it comes out more times so I think it's a 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:07.400
 small crunch the one below and say that 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.670
 it's worth it, it's a bit difficult 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:14.190
 but good with practice 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.190
 you will end up doing it 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.800
 how are you seeing now are these 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.980
 are the new skills of goalkeepers 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:27.290
 so to speak to make them for 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.730
 try to confuse the opponent when 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.030
 throwing a penalty that you only have to 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:35.150
 give an xbox to the and the x to the to the 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:37.790
 time if we keep pressing any of 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:40.970
 they will have one movement or another in play 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.200
 so good x circle and others and good that 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.390
 It's all I hope you liked the 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.010
 tutorial especially that you serve leave me 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:48.739
