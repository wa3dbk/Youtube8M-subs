00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 hi girls how are you welcome to 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.690
 a new video in today's video I'm going 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.610
 to give several tricks to mark the area 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.320
 of the waist that is a zone changes 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.570
 I really like to mark because we 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.700
 helps create that clock silhouette of 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.560
 sand is not a silhouette at the end very 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.480
 female and that we mark those curves 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.070
 proper to the woman so I'm going to 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.039
 give some tricks so that when 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.060
 go to do that shopping pine 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:26.550
 find those clothes that will help 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:32.130
 to enhance that area of ​​the body we are going to 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:33.960
 start let's start with the 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.059
 dresses we can choose among several 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.920
 models for example those that have 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.960
 an elastic in the waist area 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.879
 because it will be marked without you giving 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.920
 really counts dresses that are 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.079
 tight to the waist and having 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.879
 then a cut precisely there already 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.460
 from there some tables that give 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.930
 waist volume down inside 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.579
 those models for example those that have 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.160
 pockets that you know that still 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.350
 more accentuate the area or the shape of the clock 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.730
 of sand dresses that mark the waist 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.460
 with the panels 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.960
 hard vertical corset and that a 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.360
 from the waist to reopen 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.400
 with some tables in this case there are two 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.350
 details that help one is the fabric of 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.390
 neoprene that is more bulky and gives more 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.190
 volume and others are those panels 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.900
 triangular that you have right in the 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.119
 waist that visually put a 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.890
 little for inside dresses that have 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.660
 contrasting fabrics that draw the 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.119
 silhouette in this case you see that it is a 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:26.070
 black lycra and leather dress 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.810
 leather makes a drawing that narrows the 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.940
 waist lately has also seen 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.830
 many dresses that come as one 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.149
 kind of vacuum or cut in the area of 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.340
 the waist is really a unique 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:36.390
 piece but it makes that effect like cut 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.300
 between the top and the bottom 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:43.979
 accentuating the waist even us 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:45.570
 they also make part of 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.100
 this kind of dresses obviously we can 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.780
 resort to the tops me specifically 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.610
 I recommend those that cut to the 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.320
 waist and that from there has a 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.570
 Feather style detail as well as a 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.460
 little with little toys you will help to create 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.229
 also that hourglass shape and 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.789
 to say those of the skirts there are skirts 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.350
 who have for example a waistband 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:03.929
 wider than normal than obviously 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.710
 mark more that area and if that waistband 

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:07.020
 for example 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.330
 set and then opens it 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.250
 the effect is still greater and if there is a 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.080
 accessory that really helps us to 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.330
 accentuate the waist area as your 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.709
 name indicates is the belt I'm going to 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.600
 give some tricks how can you 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.280
 use the belt in our 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.140
 combinations going back to the dresses 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.239
 here we have another French dress in 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.069
 the waist are more discreet but the 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:28.140
 brand in enough we can by 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:30.120
 example putting a discrete belt on a 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.100
 white color just to break the 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.560
 monotony of the floral pattern and 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.030
 mark the waist you like how it is if 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.890
 for example what you have at home are 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.780
 rather broad dresses if you want 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.360
 perform the waist you have it very easy 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.610
 for example this cowboy dress what 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.739
 I'm going to do is put a belt 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.480
 I close and then a little bit the 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:50.670
 dressed up to give it a little 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.250
 more than grace if in addition to 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.470
 leave the long sleeves the rem angamos 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.660
 As you can see the cut at the waist is 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.209
 even more marked note see how the 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.190
 sure difference that you have at home more 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:04.319
 of a bulky jersey these are also 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.600
 perfect to make them more stylish 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:09.540
 with the help of a belt you can choose 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.760
 thick belts like this one 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.859
 and you can hide them under the bulk 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.269
 from the jersey itself you can also mark 

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:18.209
 the waist with small details 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:20.010
 insignificant but that help here I 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.540
 you see with a skirt and a shirt by 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.670
 on top that does not fit that waist 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.859
 just doing something so simple 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.620
 how to put the blouse inside the 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:30.840
 skirt we have already marked and delimited that 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.180
 waist if this seems like little we can 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.280
 grab an elastic belt and put it 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.470
 just to the waist and linger us 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.000
 sleeves to give a little air and up 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.889
 here we have arrived with these little ones 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.900
 notes to accentuate the area of ​​the 

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:44.939
