00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:15.259
 Tell us, we are here with our 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.400
 arrived at the spin that we are far away 

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:18.289
 mile lighthouse 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.169
 but we have not seen a mile lighthouse yet 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:22.699
 light and I made this video here for 

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:25.700
 show you 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:27.969
 the working of the mile lighthouse 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:30.259
 we need the ignition key 

00:00:27.969 --> 00:00:32.300
 because it only works with the ignition 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:35.180
 connected 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:39.980
 Let's turn the ignition on now. 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:42.020
 light up soon and now we will be 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:45.590
 just the lights button 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:49.640
 You have to turn the ignition on and then 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:52.940
 turn on the first light in case the flashlight 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:57.820
 and we'll hit the middle button and 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.820
 will light the lighthouse out there see 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:05.449
 I deleted it light again 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:08.810
 it's in that middle button here right in the middle 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:10.840
 button goes off and lights up the 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.840
 mist 

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:15.950
 You're seeing a very strong light. 

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:17.899
 The cool thing about this lighthouse is that it 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:22.429
 indicated on the panel a on the 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:24.999
 pointer there the green luisinha extinguished 

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:29.149
 tavern will light again 

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:32.689
 on the hand side of the account 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:37.009
 so that's it there our chevrolet 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:38.659
 spin with mile headlamp installed and 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:40.490
 working 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:43.609
 We had to take the car in the 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.859
 to enable the module 

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:48.759
 the car ignition module in case the 

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:52.909
 injection to recognize the mile headlamp 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:55.880
 because it is connected via module and not via 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:58.189
 relay, that's it 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.249
 If you liked, do not forget to give 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:03.799
 joinha share on social networks 

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:08.770
 to help promote our video 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:08.770
 A hug and until the next video
