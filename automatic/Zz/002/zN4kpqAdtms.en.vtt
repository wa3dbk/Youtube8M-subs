00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
and just put it into cancer because it's

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.200

how I do it

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.300 
how I do it

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
until you get about almost feel that

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.229 
until you get about almost feel that
reservoir<00:02:36.220> that<00:02:36.370> you<00:02:36.489> feel<00:02:36.700> the<00:02:36.850> way<00:02:36.970> up<00:02:37.090> to

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
reservoir that you feel the way up to

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:40.500 
reservoir that you feel the way up to
top<00:02:37.480> is<00:02:37.660> empty<00:02:38.489> that<00:02:39.489> way<00:02:39.640> you<00:02:39.700> get<00:02:39.970> all<00:02:40.150> new

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
top is empty that way you get all new

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.740 
top is empty that way you get all new
fresh<00:02:40.780> stuff<00:02:41.110> inside<00:02:41.530> your<00:02:41.680> lines<00:02:41.920> cuz<00:02:42.310> that

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
fresh stuff inside your lines cuz that

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.000 
fresh stuff inside your lines cuz that
reservoir<00:02:43.750> holds<00:02:44.140> about<00:02:44.500> the<00:02:44.739> amount<00:02:44.920> that

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
reservoir holds about the amount that

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.590 
reservoir holds about the amount that
your<00:02:45.220> lines<00:02:45.430> hold<00:02:47.610> it<00:02:48.640> getting<00:02:49.209> it<00:02:49.300> lowering

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
your lines hold it getting it lowering

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.550 
your lines hold it getting it lowering
lowering<00:02:51.900> don't<00:02:52.900> let<00:02:53.080> it<00:02:53.200> get<00:02:53.319> all<00:02:53.350> the<00:02:53.500> way

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
lowering don't let it get all the way

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:54.870 
lowering don't let it get all the way
down<00:02:53.769> because<00:02:53.950> then<00:02:54.220> you<00:02:54.340> get<00:02:54.459> air<00:02:54.640> in<00:02:54.760> your

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
down because then you get air in your

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.490 
down because then you get air in your
lines<00:02:55.090> and<00:02:55.540> you'll<00:02:55.690> have<00:02:55.870> to<00:02:56.050> redo<00:02:56.290> it<00:02:56.319> all

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
lines and you'll have to redo it all

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:57.620 
lines and you'll have to redo it all
over<00:02:56.769> again

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
over again

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.259 
over again
go<00:02:58.630> fill<00:02:58.900> it<00:02:58.930> back<00:02:59.140> up<00:02:59.760> only<00:03:00.760> up<00:03:00.880> to<00:03:01.030> the<00:03:01.090> top

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
go fill it back up only up to the top

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:03.120 
go fill it back up only up to the top
now<00:03:01.600> this<00:03:02.290> time<00:03:02.500> you're<00:03:02.620> gonna<00:03:02.709> do<00:03:02.890> it<00:03:02.920> about

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
now this time you're gonna do it about

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.350 
now this time you're gonna do it about
half<00:03:03.370> way<00:03:03.720> so<00:03:04.720> that's<00:03:04.870> half<00:03:05.140> way<00:03:05.380> empty<00:03:05.739> and

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
half way so that's half way empty and

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.340 
half way so that's half way empty and
what<00:03:07.360> you're<00:03:07.480> gonna<00:03:07.570> do<00:03:07.780> is<00:03:07.930> if<00:03:08.049> you<00:03:08.140> have

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
what you're gonna do is if you have

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:09.990 
what you're gonna do is if you have
someone<00:03:08.680> else<00:03:08.829> close<00:03:09.250> the<00:03:09.459> plug<00:03:09.670> while<00:03:09.850> you're

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
someone else close the plug while you're

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.729 
someone else close the plug while you're
pumping<00:03:10.150> if<00:03:10.510> not<00:03:10.720> you<00:03:10.930> can<00:03:11.110> quickly<00:03:11.320> go<00:03:11.709> over

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
pumping if not you can quickly go over

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:16.310 
pumping if not you can quickly go over
and<00:03:12.160> close<00:03:12.880> the<00:03:13.030> plug<00:03:13.269> by<00:03:13.420> yourself

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.960 

like<00:03:17.320> I<00:03:17.440> said<00:03:17.709> just<00:03:17.739> fill<00:03:18.190> the<00:03:18.280> calibers<00:03:18.760> about

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
like I said just fill the calibers about

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.090 
like I said just fill the calibers about
happen<00:03:19.420> that<00:03:20.200> reservoir<00:03:20.620> is<00:03:20.680> about<00:03:20.890> half

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
happen that reservoir is about half

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.400 
happen that reservoir is about half
empty<00:03:21.430> goes<00:03:22.030> down<00:03:22.239> pretty<00:03:22.420> quick<00:03:22.720> actually

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.930 

now<00:03:26.410> you<00:03:26.470> even<00:03:26.590> explain<00:03:26.769> how<00:03:27.070> these<00:03:27.340> works<00:03:27.640> and

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
now you even explain how these works and

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.259 
now you even explain how these works and
hopefully<00:03:28.260> you'll<00:03:29.260> get<00:03:29.410> the<00:03:29.590> better<00:03:30.269> know

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269 
hopefully you'll get the better know

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:33.000 
hopefully you'll get the better know
your<00:03:31.480> brakes<00:03:31.930> a<00:03:32.140> little<00:03:32.230> better<00:03:32.500> and<00:03:32.859> we're

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
your brakes a little better and we're

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.090 
your brakes a little better and we're
gonna<00:03:33.100> quit<00:03:33.370> close<00:03:33.670> that<00:03:33.910> plug<00:03:34.150> up<00:03:35.100> viously

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
gonna quit close that plug up viously

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:41.310 
gonna quit close that plug up viously
that<00:03:36.840> sorry<00:03:37.840> for<00:03:37.900> lying<00:03:38.430> and<00:03:39.430> see<00:03:40.420> now

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.320 
that sorry for lying and see now

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:42.660 
that sorry for lying and see now
we're<00:03:41.470> gonna<00:03:41.560> try<00:03:41.829> our<00:03:41.950> brakes<00:03:42.160> out<00:03:42.370> look<00:03:42.579> at

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
we're gonna try our brakes out look at

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.460 
we're gonna try our brakes out look at
all<00:03:42.760> that<00:03:42.910> old<00:03:43.109> old<00:03:44.109> stuff<00:03:44.560> in<00:03:44.739> there<00:03:46.470> what's

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
all that old old stuff in there what's

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.979 
all that old old stuff in there what's
not<00:03:47.650> really<00:03:47.890> old<00:03:48.040> just

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
not really old just

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:56.759 
not really old just
and<00:03:50.349> those<00:03:50.650> brakes<00:03:50.980> are<00:03:51.129> rocks<00:03:51.400> odd<00:03:53.489> see<00:03:55.769> you

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
and those brakes are rocks odd see you

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:58.440 
and those brakes are rocks odd see you
should<00:03:56.950> have<00:03:56.980> a<00:03:57.129> you<00:03:57.640> should<00:03:57.819> never<00:03:58.030> work<00:03:58.239> on

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
should have a you should never work on

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.539 
should have a you should never work on
something<00:03:58.659> that's<00:03:58.750> really<00:03:59.049> dirty<00:03:59.230> but<00:03:59.549> we're

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:00.549 
something that's really dirty but we're

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:04.020 
something that's really dirty but we're
just<00:04:00.579> doing<00:04:00.790> this<00:04:02.010> like<00:04:03.010> this<00:04:03.219> and<00:04:03.519> make<00:04:03.909> sure

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
just doing this like this and make sure

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:05.420 
just doing this like this and make sure
you<00:04:04.120> got<00:04:04.239> that<00:04:04.390> little<00:04:04.629> rubber<00:04:04.810> thing<00:04:05.109> inside

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
you got that little rubber thing inside

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.490 
you got that little rubber thing inside
that's<00:04:06.430> actually<00:04:06.909> just<00:04:07.120> sit<00:04:07.299> away<00:04:07.540> air

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
that's actually just sit away air

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.530 
that's actually just sit away air
pressures<00:04:09.010> would<00:04:09.129> go<00:04:09.310> down<00:04:10.260> without<00:04:11.260> it<00:04:12.540> and

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
pressures would go down without it and

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:23.170 
pressures would go down without it and
I'll<00:04:13.719> explain<00:04:13.810> how<00:04:14.590> these<00:04:15.040> work

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:28.400 

so<00:04:24.650> how<00:04:25.650> do<00:04:25.710> your<00:04:26.100> brakes<00:04:26.340> work<00:04:26.610> well<00:04:27.410> it's

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
so how do your brakes work well it's

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:30.340 
so how do your brakes work well it's
quite<00:04:28.920> simple<00:04:28.950> actually

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350 
quite simple actually

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:34.520 
quite simple actually
and<00:04:31.350> the<00:04:31.440> brakes<00:04:32.210> there's<00:04:33.210> a<00:04:33.450> small<00:04:33.750> piston<00:04:34.380> in

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
and the brakes there's a small piston in

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:38.810 
and the brakes there's a small piston in
here<00:04:35.690> this<00:04:36.690> is<00:04:36.750> what<00:04:36.960> you<00:04:37.110> control<00:04:37.500> here<00:04:37.920> this

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 
here this is what you control here this

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.490 
here this is what you control here this
is<00:04:38.970> also<00:04:39.120> the<00:04:39.330> same<00:04:39.540> for<00:04:39.570> up<00:04:39.810> here<00:04:39.990> to<00:04:40.110> smelt

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
is also the same for up here to smelt

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.190 
is also the same for up here to smelt
your<00:04:40.790> reservoir<00:04:41.790> is<00:04:41.910> actually<00:04:42.180> right<00:04:42.300> here<00:04:42.330> so

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:43.200 
your reservoir is actually right here so

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.020 
your reservoir is actually right here so
if<00:04:43.530> you<00:04:43.800> should<00:04:43.980> get<00:04:44.160> you<00:04:44.460> should<00:04:44.640> know<00:04:44.760> how<00:04:44.910> to

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
if you should get you should know how to

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:46.640 
if you should get you should know how to
do<00:04:45.180> it<00:04:45.330> same<00:04:45.870> thing<00:04:45.900> to<00:04:46.230> stop<00:04:46.410> on<00:04:46.560> the

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
do it same thing to stop on the

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:51.980 
do it same thing to stop on the
handlebars<00:04:47.360> so<00:04:49.700> next<00:04:50.700> you<00:04:50.790> got<00:04:50.940> a<00:04:51.180> larger

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
handlebars so next you got a larger

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.740 
handlebars so next you got a larger
piston<00:04:52.380> in<00:04:52.500> here<00:04:52.680> and<00:04:53.480> it's<00:04:54.480> pretty<00:04:54.660> much

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
piston in here and it's pretty much

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.930 
piston in here and it's pretty much
hydraulics<00:04:55.380> which<00:04:55.560> it<00:04:55.680> is<00:04:55.770> hydraulic<00:04:56.310> it<00:04:56.820> is

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
hydraulics which it is hydraulic it is

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.720 
hydraulics which it is hydraulic it is
pretty<00:04:57.210> much<00:04:57.360> hydraulic<00:04:57.870> food<00:04:58.310> so<00:04:59.310> that<00:04:59.490> plugs

00:04:59.720 --> 00:04:59.730 
pretty much hydraulic food so that plugs

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:01.160 
pretty much hydraulic food so that plugs
just<00:04:59.940> a<00:05:00.030> bleed<00:05:00.240> plug<00:05:00.510> there<00:05:00.780> it's<00:05:00.990> a<00:05:01.050> little

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:01.170 
just a bleed plug there it's a little

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:03.350 
just a bleed plug there it's a little
valve<00:05:01.470> that<00:05:01.680> opens<00:05:01.740> up<00:05:02.160> me<00:05:02.310> I'm<00:05:02.850> screwed<00:05:03.180> a

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 
valve that opens up me I'm screwed a

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.500 
valve that opens up me I'm screwed a
quarter<00:05:03.660> turn<00:05:03.840> so<00:05:04.790> this<00:05:05.790> is<00:05:05.970> all<00:05:06.120> filled<00:05:06.390> with

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:06.510 
quarter turn so this is all filled with

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:08.420 
quarter turn so this is all filled with
fluid<00:05:06.780> you<00:05:06.870> don't<00:05:07.020> want<00:05:07.140> any<00:05:07.290> air<00:05:07.470> in<00:05:07.590> it<00:05:07.710> he's

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430 
fluid you don't want any air in it he's

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.130 
fluid you don't want any air in it he's
not<00:05:08.610> your<00:05:08.790> brakes<00:05:09.000> will<00:05:09.210> feel<00:05:09.630> right<00:05:09.900> and<00:05:10.080> they

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:10.140 
not your brakes will feel right and they

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:13.610 
not your brakes will feel right and they
won't<00:05:10.320> may<00:05:10.440> not<00:05:10.620> work<00:05:10.800> right<00:05:11.040> so<00:05:12.000> uh<00:05:12.440> this<00:05:13.440> is

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 
won't may not work right so uh this is

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.630 
won't may not work right so uh this is
all<00:05:13.910> fluid<00:05:14.910> in<00:05:15.000> here<00:05:15.150> keep<00:05:15.390> line<00:05:16.490> should<00:05:17.490> have

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:17.640 
all fluid in here keep line should have

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:22.420 
all fluid in here keep line should have
no<00:05:17.850> air<00:05:18.030> in<00:05:18.150> it<00:05:18.240> not<00:05:18.930> even<00:05:19.200> a<00:05:19.260> little<00:05:19.410> bit<00:05:19.880> so

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:22.430 
no air in it not even a little bit so

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:26.450 
no air in it not even a little bit so
these<00:05:23.430> here<00:05:24.470> when<00:05:25.470> this<00:05:25.620> caliper<00:05:26.190> is<00:05:26.250> filled

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 
these here when this caliper is filled

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:30.190 
these here when this caliper is filled
up<00:05:26.580> with<00:05:26.700> fluid<00:05:26.880> a<00:05:27.270> smaller<00:05:27.780> piston<00:05:28.350> here

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:30.200 
up with fluid a smaller piston here

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:33.110 
up with fluid a smaller piston here
pushing<00:05:31.200> it<00:05:31.470> on<00:05:31.590> but<00:05:32.160> you<00:05:32.190> know<00:05:32.370> the<00:05:32.430> form<00:05:33.030> of

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120 
pushing it on but you know the form of

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.050 
pushing it on but you know the form of
hydraulics<00:05:33.600> pushes<00:05:34.380> pressure<00:05:34.740> up<00:05:35.640> through

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:36.060 
hydraulics pushes pressure up through

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:39.080 
hydraulics pushes pressure up through
all<00:05:36.180> those<00:05:36.360> lines<00:05:36.600> there<00:05:37.050> and<00:05:37.980> it<00:05:38.100> pushes<00:05:38.310> all

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:39.090 
all those lines there and it pushes all

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:40.970 
all those lines there and it pushes all
the<00:05:39.150> pressure<00:05:39.600> inside<00:05:40.050> that<00:05:40.260> caliper<00:05:40.770> here

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:40.980 
the pressure inside that caliper here

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:48.999 
the pressure inside that caliper here
and<00:05:41.700> that<00:05:41.790> caliper<00:05:42.360> that<00:05:43.940> caliper<00:05:44.940> opens<00:05:45.840> up

00:05:48.999 --> 00:05:49.009 

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:54.070 

pushes<00:05:49.490> on<00:05:49.610> the<00:05:49.729> roller<00:05:51.580> like<00:05:52.580> that<00:05:52.990> pushes<00:05:53.990> on

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:54.080 
pushes on the roller like that pushes on

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.109 
pushes on the roller like that pushes on
the<00:05:54.110> pad<00:05:54.319> it's<00:05:54.650> three<00:05:54.919> squeezes<00:05:55.580> the<00:05:55.879> rotor

00:05:56.109 --> 00:05:56.119 
the pad it's three squeezes the rotor

00:05:56.119 --> 00:06:01.059 
the pad it's three squeezes the rotor
there<00:05:56.889> so<00:05:57.889> I<00:05:59.469> shouldn't<00:06:00.469> have<00:06:00.589> a<00:06:00.649> block<00:06:00.889> off

00:06:01.059 --> 00:06:01.069 
there so I shouldn't have a block off

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:02.290 
there so I shouldn't have a block off
kick<00:06:01.309> because<00:06:01.399> I<00:06:01.580> remove<00:06:01.789> my<00:06:01.909> parking<00:06:02.270> brake

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:02.300 
kick because I remove my parking brake

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:08.230 
kick because I remove my parking brake
but<00:06:04.119> anyways<00:06:06.669> it's<00:06:07.669> kind<00:06:07.879> of<00:06:07.909> how<00:06:07.999> it<00:06:08.119> works

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:08.240 
but anyways it's kind of how it works

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.859 
but anyways it's kind of how it works
pretty<00:06:08.809> much<00:06:08.899> for<00:06:09.349> the<00:06:09.409> most<00:06:09.499> part<00:06:09.830> it<00:06:10.610> just

00:06:10.859 --> 00:06:10.869 
pretty much for the most part it just

00:06:10.869 --> 00:06:13.239 
pretty much for the most part it just
smaller<00:06:11.869> cylinder<00:06:12.199> pushes<00:06:12.439> fluid<00:06:12.949> pushes

00:06:13.239 --> 00:06:13.249 
smaller cylinder pushes fluid pushes

00:06:13.249 --> 00:06:15.969 
smaller cylinder pushes fluid pushes
pressure<00:06:13.550> on<00:06:13.789> bigger<00:06:14.300> blue<00:06:14.629> cylinder<00:06:15.499> and

00:06:15.969 --> 00:06:15.979 
pressure on bigger blue cylinder and

00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:17.950 
pressure on bigger blue cylinder and
then<00:06:16.309> I<00:06:16.430> squeeze<00:06:17.119> it<00:06:17.360> on<00:06:17.449> a<00:06:17.479> brake<00:06:17.719> pad<00:06:17.899> just

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:17.960 
then I squeeze it on a brake pad just

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.559 
then I squeeze it on a brake pad just
slow<00:06:18.439> down<00:06:18.649> the<00:06:18.860> vehicle<00:06:19.159> and<00:06:19.610> I<00:06:20.149> said<00:06:20.419> that

00:06:20.559 --> 00:06:20.569 
slow down the vehicle and I said that

00:06:20.569 --> 00:06:21.700 
slow down the vehicle and I said that
because<00:06:20.719> you<00:06:20.899> have<00:06:21.080> to<00:06:21.110> change<00:06:21.229> your<00:06:21.499> brake

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:21.710 
because you have to change your brake

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:25.239 
because you have to change your brake
pad<00:06:22.930> if<00:06:23.930> he<00:06:24.379> had<00:06:24.469> bad<00:06:24.680> bearings<00:06:25.099> which

00:06:25.239 --> 00:06:25.249 
pad if he had bad bearings which

00:06:25.249 --> 00:06:26.920 
pad if he had bad bearings which
actually<00:06:25.610> I<00:06:25.669> just<00:06:25.759> replaced<00:06:26.270> my<00:06:26.360> bearings<00:06:26.809> in

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:26.930 
actually I just replaced my bearings in

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:29.679 
actually I just replaced my bearings in
there<00:06:27.110> and<00:06:27.789> you<00:06:28.789> have<00:06:28.969> to<00:06:29.120> replace<00:06:29.330> the<00:06:29.509> brake

00:06:29.679 --> 00:06:29.689 
there and you have to replace the brake

00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:32.529 
there and you have to replace the brake
pads<00:06:29.719> because<00:06:30.259> if<00:06:30.409> not<00:06:30.589> what<00:06:31.339> happens<00:06:31.759> is<00:06:31.969> the

00:06:32.529 --> 00:06:32.539 
pads because if not what happens is the

00:06:32.539 --> 00:06:34.209 
pads because if not what happens is the
bearings<00:06:33.020> when<00:06:33.289> they're<00:06:33.469> loose<00:06:33.740> like<00:06:34.009> that

00:06:34.209 --> 00:06:34.219 
bearings when they're loose like that

00:06:34.219 --> 00:06:36.339 
bearings when they're loose like that
and<00:06:34.490> so<00:06:34.729> it<00:06:35.240> actually<00:06:35.419> angles<00:06:36.020> even<00:06:36.289> though

00:06:36.339 --> 00:06:36.349 
and so it actually angles even though

00:06:36.349 --> 00:06:37.659 
and so it actually angles even though
you<00:06:36.409> can't<00:06:36.649> really<00:06:36.710> see<00:06:37.009> it<00:06:37.039> and<00:06:37.279> angles<00:06:37.580> the

00:06:37.659 --> 00:06:37.669 
you can't really see it and angles the

00:06:37.669 --> 00:06:39.790 
you can't really see it and angles the
axle<00:06:38.059> just<00:06:38.089> a<00:06:38.330> little<00:06:38.569> bit<00:06:38.719> and<00:06:39.620> when<00:06:39.740> the

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:39.800 
axle just a little bit and when the

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.769 
axle just a little bit and when the
angles<00:06:40.129> the<00:06:40.189> axle<00:06:40.639> it<00:06:40.759> eats<00:06:41.120> into<00:06:41.330> the<00:06:41.509> side<00:06:41.659> of

00:06:41.769 --> 00:06:41.779 
angles the axle it eats into the side of

00:06:41.779 --> 00:06:46.929 
angles the axle it eats into the side of
the<00:06:41.839> pad<00:06:42.050> and<00:06:42.860> that's<00:06:43.639> not<00:06:43.789> good<00:06:43.969> so<00:06:44.620> yeah<00:06:45.939> do

00:06:46.929 --> 00:06:46.939 
the pad and that's not good so yeah do

00:07:00.939 --> 00:07:00.949 
I did with the bleeding process if

00:07:00.949 --> 00:07:03.730 
I did with the bleeding process if
you're<00:07:01.279> totally<00:07:01.849> got<00:07:02.389> no<00:07:02.539> flew<00:07:02.809> in<00:07:02.959> there<00:07:03.169> you

may not be may have a hard time getting

00:07:07.029 --> 00:07:09.909 
may not be may have a hard time getting
fluid<00:07:08.029> back<00:07:08.479> into<00:07:08.509> the<00:07:08.839> cylinder<00:07:09.259> I<00:07:09.469> sometimes

00:07:09.909 --> 00:07:09.919 
fluid back into the cylinder I sometimes

00:07:09.919 --> 00:07:11.589 
fluid back into the cylinder I sometimes
just<00:07:10.219> cheap<00:07:10.550> take<00:07:10.789> a<00:07:10.879> hose<00:07:11.059> like<00:07:11.240> that<00:07:11.389> and

00:07:11.589 --> 00:07:11.599 
just cheap take a hose like that and

00:07:11.599 --> 00:07:12.820 
just cheap take a hose like that and
actually<00:07:11.689> I<00:07:11.870> just<00:07:11.990> suck<00:07:12.199> on<00:07:12.319> it<00:07:12.439> with<00:07:12.559> my<00:07:12.680> mouth

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:12.830 
actually I just suck on it with my mouth

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:13.600 
actually I just suck on it with my mouth
okay

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:13.610 
okay

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:16.179 
okay
suck<00:07:14.149> all<00:07:14.330> the<00:07:14.360> fluid<00:07:15.110> backwards<00:07:15.740> into<00:07:15.919> there

00:07:16.179 --> 00:07:16.189 
suck all the fluid backwards into there

00:07:16.189 --> 00:07:18.549 
suck all the fluid backwards into there
and<00:07:17.059> that<00:07:17.599> usually<00:07:17.779> works<00:07:18.080> out<00:07:18.229> pretty<00:07:18.319> good

00:07:18.549 --> 00:07:18.559 
and that usually works out pretty good

00:07:18.559 --> 00:07:22.030 
and that usually works out pretty good
then<00:07:18.740> I<00:07:18.830> proceed<00:07:19.309> with<00:07:19.339> bleeding

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:22.040 

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:24.610 

this<00:07:22.580> way<00:07:22.790> I<00:07:22.820> do<00:07:23.000> it<00:07:23.270> you<00:07:23.900> know<00:07:24.080> the<00:07:24.260> heck<00:07:24.440> I

this way I do it you know the heck I

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:26.410 
this way I do it you know the heck I
know<00:07:24.770> how<00:07:25.190> to<00:07:25.250> do<00:07:25.490> it<00:07:25.640> the<00:07:25.820> other<00:07:25.940> way<00:07:26.090> just

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:26.420 
know how to do it the other way just

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:29.320 
know how to do it the other way just
pumping<00:07:27.310> the<00:07:28.310> brakes<00:07:28.520> here<00:07:28.730> just<00:07:28.880> be<00:07:28.970> careful

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:29.330 
pumping the brakes here just be careful

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:31.240 
pumping the brakes here just be careful
when<00:07:29.450> you<00:07:29.510> do<00:07:29.600> that<00:07:29.750> you<00:07:29.900> can<00:07:30.050> get<00:07:30.230> it<00:07:30.350> you<00:07:31.190> can

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:31.250 
when you do that you can get it you can

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:32.830 
when you do that you can get it you can
just<00:07:31.370> pump<00:07:31.670> the<00:07:31.730> brakes<00:07:32.030> and<00:07:32.210> eventually<00:07:32.690> it

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:32.840 
just pump the brakes and eventually it

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:36.070 
just pump the brakes and eventually it
comes<00:07:33.350> in<00:07:33.590> or<00:07:33.800> something<00:07:34.190> like<00:07:34.250> that<00:07:34.990> but<00:07:35.990> I

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:36.080

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:37.880 
just stuck it through and then just
