00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:34.369 
I have to finish off ending it with this

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:36.940 
I have to finish off ending it with this
this<00:01:35.330> machine<00:01:35.720> is<00:01:35.750> by<00:01:36.110> no<00:01:36.170> means<00:01:36.320> big<00:01:36.770> enough

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
this machine is by no means big enough

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.260 
this machine is by no means big enough
to<00:01:37.100> actually<00:01:38.140> bend<00:01:39.140> this<00:01:39.410> eighth<00:01:40.070> inch<00:01:40.369> this

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
to actually bend this eighth inch this

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.330 
to actually bend this eighth inch this
is<00:01:41.479> made<00:01:41.690> for<00:01:41.960> like<00:01:42.640> 20<00:01:43.640> HTML<00:01:44.530> but<00:01:45.530> I<00:01:45.800> can<00:01:46.130> open

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
is made for like 20 HTML but I can open

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.359 
is made for like 20 HTML but I can open
it<00:01:46.430> up<00:01:46.490> big<00:01:46.700> enough<00:01:47.290> to<00:01:48.290> get<00:01:48.410> my<00:01:48.590> flat<00:01:48.860> stock<00:01:49.100> in

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
it up big enough to get my flat stock in

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:59.730 
it up big enough to get my flat stock in
here<00:01:49.690> and<00:01:50.690> I<00:01:50.810> can<00:01:51.080> just<00:01:51.490> leverage<00:01:52.490> up<00:01:52.850> on<00:01:53.060> it

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.960 

and<00:02:00.740> now<00:02:00.890> we<00:02:00.979> can<00:02:01.130> see<00:02:01.280> that<00:02:01.369> it<00:02:01.460> fits<00:02:01.610> right<00:02:01.820> in

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
and now we can see that it fits right in

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.960 
and now we can see that it fits right in
there<00:02:02.170> pretty<00:02:03.170> good<00:02:03.289> I<00:02:05.170> get<00:02:06.170> this<00:02:06.259> on<00:02:06.500> here<00:02:06.770> and

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
there pretty good I get this on here and

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.330 
there pretty good I get this on here and
trace<00:02:07.970> out<00:02:08.470> this<00:02:09.470> where<00:02:09.710> I<00:02:09.740> want<00:02:09.950> to<00:02:10.009> make<00:02:10.160> my

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
trace out this where I want to make my

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:23.179 
trace out this where I want to make my
plasma<00:02:10.580> cut

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
my piece man those are cleaned up was

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:37.700 
my piece man those are cleaned up was
really<00:02:27.129> important<00:02:27.549> to<00:02:27.640> get<00:02:28.150> on<00:02:28.269> the<00:02:28.390> slag

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:42.150 

finish<00:02:38.710> getting<00:02:38.740> us<00:02:39.100> all<00:02:39.280> welded<00:02:39.550> up<00:02:39.820> I<00:02:41.160> had

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
finish getting us all welded up I had

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.520 
finish getting us all welded up I had
some<00:02:42.370> troubles<00:02:42.820> here<00:02:43.630> and<00:02:44.670> here<00:02:45.720> but<00:02:46.720> I<00:02:46.990> got<00:02:47.410> it

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
some troubles here and here but I got it
