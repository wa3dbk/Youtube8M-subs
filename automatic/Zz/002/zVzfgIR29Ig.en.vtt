00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:07.759
 I just cut the video was review for 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.759
 do it from the theory 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.700
 The theory consists of the following 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.130
 I just saw that chapter 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:27.200
 fairytale anime in which ceres speaks 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.630
 with nacho and that reminded me of something 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:32.059
 he reflects in his that only in natsu 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.370
 will come to the end your must take the 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:36.980
 decision of which of the two 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.260
 will face him that the one who nacho is the 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.120
 that will decide before killing end or not 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.860
 we know that in money they are the same 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.360
 person here begins the theory there 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.860
 different theories that say that in 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.860
 dinant their are different personalities 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:51.380
 mine was that they finish their are 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:54.290
 different personalities caused by 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:57.649
 have been revived but this helps me 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:01:00.500
 account something that is that if in the first 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:02.239
 natsu died with so few so young 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.040
 it is impossible for Tartars to believe 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:06.619
 own doing is a martyr 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.410
 everybody I did Tartars is 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:11.960
 created by him that means a 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:14.210
 damn child can not create 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.799
 Tartars because they had not even 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.490
 the demons were born because he was still 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:22.060
 I live that means that when 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:24.040
 nothing your bar in revive bar I've 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.990
 revived by ceres 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.480
 continue with his memories therefore 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:31.840
 still great that means that 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:33.940
 ingenuity then faced cnet his 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.340
 bar in one time had already created 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:38.830
 Tartars and probably could not kill him 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.630
 because it does not stop being his son but 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.820
 probably he was gone so much 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.680
 to the head with the idea of â€‹â€‹killing ceres 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.140
 that probably would have destroyed the 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.820
 whole world for ending up with cd and neither what 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.890
 could allow that therefore it 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.720
 He faced him like he could not finish him 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.100
 he erased the memory we know that the 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.050
 dragons have the power to 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.900
 overwriting the memory is a very 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:01.210
 important that we were seen and given 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:03.640
 let's say at the end of the Tartar saga and 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.990
 it was used so that it did not have any 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.450
 importance because honestly 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.970
 I think nobody cared about that sting and 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.520
 road would have received his memory or 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.500
 exercised changed was something like that 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.840
 threw there for people to think like that 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.340
 that probably nothing even though they are the 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.400
 same person with the same personality 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:24.610
 and power 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:27.310
 and the book itself is the seal for 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.870
 nobody recovers the memories of him and he 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.280
 merge in the same person because 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.620
 they really are the same 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.540
 the sun but I refer to it as being 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.370
 complete with all the memories and anap 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.810
 its like the character who does not have everything 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.850
 I remember it therefore in this saga 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.130
 we'll probably see a natsu that does not 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.230
 can defeat does not reach the level of cdc 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:46.510
 technology or if I do not know since I leave 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.489
 that between live and opposite do is or 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.810
 maybe not maybe we do not have to get there 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:52.120
 up to that point because nothing has 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.410
 become such a strong character 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.390
 as to face technology and 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.610
 But you'll see that's my theory 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:00.550
 that's what I really believe if I 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:03.130
 you really think I think I have the 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.140
 minus 60% of the reason a 70 to 80 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.940
 There are favorites, please subscribe in all 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.110
 he commented in the comments that he has 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.550
 yes like this theory and that made 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.900
 a lot that did not make theories but it 's that 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.760
 this has been like a revelation that I've 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.020
 had tell me about everything in the 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.120
 comments you think 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.230
 let me not all the comments and I 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.140
 I see you in the next video that now 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.830
 I'll start recording chapter 300 I'm 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.830
 saturated
