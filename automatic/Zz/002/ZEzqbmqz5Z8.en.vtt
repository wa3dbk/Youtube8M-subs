00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:05.530
 and if we know that reigns those who 

00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:07.120
 want to do challenge mode or those 

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:10.299
 who have already started doing it you have 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:12.370
 certainly heard about or iron 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:13.049
 with the question of potions 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:15.639
 invisibility 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.920
 so that's an extremely important point 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:19.500
 important in challenge mode because 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.910
 many, many, many layers 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.699
 requires skip entirely 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.830
 certain parts of the rhÃ´ne via the 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:28.839
 posture of visibility and it requires 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:31.630
 that's probably what requires 

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:35.079
 the most farm outside of outside 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.950
 of your challenges and the problem is that 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:37.570
 the potions to visit it's not 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.699
 necessarily very easy to see 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.410
 knowing that the recipe is the same 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:42.789
 a rare drop finally in quotation marks 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.680
 rare it's not something you 

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:46.840
 can just go to a pnj and cowardice 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.250
 and in addition to that the components that are 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.020
 necessary for the nursery tc of 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.969
 vanilla components 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.070
 it's the ghost mushrooms and the 

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:55.390
 suns is so much the suns is 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.989
 I did not remember it was 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:00.399
 extremely painful to close as many 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:01.510
 ghost mushrooms it was a little 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:03.660
 the unknown that is where what 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.799
 farm and ghost mushrooms 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.720
 so obviously you have the hotel of 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:09.280
 sales from the moment the 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.900
 relatively active community in term 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.610
 of challenge mode on your server you 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.990
 should you find yourself either 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.420
 ghost champions either be suns 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.869
 or invisibility potions as is 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.250
 ax 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:19.900
 but if that's not the case and you 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.460
 have to end up shut up I'm going 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.939
 show you how we can do the most 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:27.130
 easily close the mushrooms 

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:28.540
 so here we are at bongo on 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:33.100
 remains a grid on the map 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:34.360
 it's a cave that fills with macaques 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.680
 because obviously mushrooms 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.280
 ghost especially in caves that 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.990
 you found 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.640
 and in this cave there is a 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.220
 absolutely mind-blowing abundance of 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.689
 mushrooms so in I think you do 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.079
 small of the small sections of 10 15 

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:46.329
 minutes 

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:47.590
 by walking a little bit normally 

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:48.670
 you should be able to make a stock 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.240
 of ghost mushrooms that is 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.130
 acceptable 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.659
 so obviously that will not fix the 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.219
 problem if you do not have the recipe 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:56.909
 for the crafter someone you have to 

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:57.899
 find the people who have it etc etc 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.950
 you still have the suns is he 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:03.329
 must be armed normally it is less 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.469
 painful there are areas for his good 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.840
 specific ghost mushrooms 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.429
 it's already a little bit already 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.539
 a little more particular but there if you 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.430
 look at nothing but the mini map 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.430
 normally everything on the mini 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.870
 map it is currently champions 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.129
 ghost 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.349
 so you see that you make a stop 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:21.860
 still monstrous enough knowing that 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:24.410
 got you on a train at 5 each 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.519
 buy that champix you 're going to pick up 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:29.030
 so with that normally you should 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:31.200
 can you make a large stock 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.959
 story of being able to win his medals 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.579
 so much not so much so he is small 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:39.440
 wolf so I wish you good luck 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:39.440
 for your challenges and next time
