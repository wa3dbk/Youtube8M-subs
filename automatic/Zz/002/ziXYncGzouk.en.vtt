00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
so that they're very familiar with any

so that they're very familiar with any
situation<00:02:16.000> we<00:02:16.120> may<00:02:16.300> put<00:02:16.570> them<00:02:16.720> in<00:02:16.870> because

encountered in the 25 years we've been

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.780 
encountered in the 25 years we've been
doing<00:02:35.410> the<00:02:35.620> underwater<00:02:36.010> inspections<00:02:36.550> on<00:02:36.670> the

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
doing the underwater inspections on the

bridge the unusual kind of has become
usual<00:02:39.160> we<00:02:39.910> run<00:02:40.120> into<00:02:40.300> cars<00:02:40.890> trucks<00:02:42.210> shopping

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:43.210 
usual we run into cars trucks shopping

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:46.800 
usual we run into cars trucks shopping
carts<00:02:43.540> phone<00:02:44.050> booths<00:02:44.320> old<00:02:45.040> boats<00:02:45.810> basically

carts phone booths old boats basically
anything<00:02:47.410> that<00:02:47.730> people<00:02:48.730> would<00:02:49.030> check<00:02:49.240> over

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
anything that people would check over

anything that people would check over
the<00:02:49.570> side<00:02:49.750> of<00:02:49.780> the<00:02:49.900> bridge<00:02:50.430> falls<00:02:51.430> down<00:02:51.670> to<00:02:51.700> the

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
the side of the bridge falls down to the

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.030 
the side of the bridge falls down to the
bottom<00:02:52.240> sinks<00:02:52.570> to<00:02:52.690> the<00:02:52.720> bottom<00:02:52.810> and<00:02:53.260> then<00:02:53.410> we

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
bottom sinks to the bottom and then we

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.700 
bottom sinks to the bottom and then we
run<00:02:54.220> into<00:02:54.550> it<00:02:54.670> so<00:02:55.020> we<00:02:56.020> have<00:02:56.200> to<00:02:56.230> be<00:02:56.410> really

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:56.710 
run into it so we have to be really

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:59.310 
run into it so we have to be really
careful<00:02:56.980> and<00:02:57.600> moving<00:02:58.600> around<00:02:58.870> underwater

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
careful and moving around underwater

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.580 
careful and moving around underwater
when<00:03:00.250> we<00:03:00.340> have<00:03:00.490> low<00:03:00.700> visibility<00:03:01.230> so<00:03:02.230> that<00:03:02.440> you

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
when we have low visibility so that you

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.520 
when we have low visibility so that you
don't<00:03:02.770> run<00:03:03.640> into<00:03:03.700> something<00:03:04.210> or<00:03:04.660> tear<00:03:05.350> your

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
don't run into something or tear your

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.290 
don't run into something or tear your
dry<00:03:05.680> suit<00:03:05.980> or<00:03:06.220> get<00:03:06.370> your<00:03:06.520> hose<00:03:06.670> hooked<00:03:06.970> up<00:03:07.150> on

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300 
dry suit or get your hose hooked up on

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.270 
dry suit or get your hose hooked up on
something<00:03:07.720> so<00:03:07.930> we<00:03:08.500> encounter<00:03:08.890> that<00:03:08.920> all<00:03:09.160> the

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
something so we encounter that all the

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.460 
something so we encounter that all the
time<00:03:09.520> wow<00:03:10.360> that's<00:03:10.810> amazing

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
time wow that's amazing

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.800 
time wow that's amazing
so<00:03:12.010> I<00:03:12.040> know<00:03:12.550> you<00:03:12.730> and<00:03:13.000> your<00:03:13.120> team<00:03:13.360> must<00:03:13.540> be

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
so I know you and your team must be

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.950 
so I know you and your team must be
really<00:03:14.320> used<00:03:14.620> to<00:03:14.740> this<00:03:14.920> but<00:03:15.190> for<00:03:15.400> me<00:03:15.460> it<00:03:15.970> sounds

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:16.960 
really used to this but for me it sounds

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.290 
really used to this but for me it sounds
so<00:03:17.230> challenging<00:03:18.220> and<00:03:18.460> difficult<00:03:18.700> to<00:03:19.090> do<00:03:19.180> an

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:19.300 
so challenging and difficult to do an

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.060 
so challenging and difficult to do an
underwater<00:03:19.840> bridge<00:03:20.200> inspection<00:03:20.740> how<00:03:20.890> do<00:03:20.950> you

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
underwater bridge inspection how do you

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:22.740 
underwater bridge inspection how do you
deal<00:03:21.250> with<00:03:21.280> things<00:03:21.580> like<00:03:21.850> murky<00:03:22.300> water<00:03:22.510> and

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
deal with things like murky water and

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.600 
deal with things like murky water and
fast<00:03:22.960> currents<00:03:23.380> well<00:03:24.010> in<00:03:24.100> terms<00:03:24.250> of<00:03:24.400> fast

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
fast currents well in terms of fast

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.910 
fast currents well in terms of fast
currents<00:03:25.120> we<00:03:25.300> try<00:03:25.720> we<00:03:26.320> try<00:03:26.530> and<00:03:26.620> play<00:03:26.770> the

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
currents we try we try and play the

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.520 
currents we try we try and play the
tides<00:03:27.130> so<00:03:27.610> we<00:03:27.910> run<00:03:28.150> tide<00:03:28.390> charts<00:03:28.810> especially

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
tides so we run tide charts especially

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.790 
tides so we run tide charts especially
like<00:03:29.680> when<00:03:29.890> we're<00:03:30.040> working<00:03:30.190> in<00:03:30.430> the<00:03:30.520> Bay<00:03:30.730> where

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 
like when we're working in the Bay where

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.770 
like when we're working in the Bay where
karkinos<00:03:32.800> is<00:03:33.040> our<00:03:33.190> fastest<00:03:33.670> flow<00:03:34.150> we<00:03:34.450> can<00:03:34.600> get

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
karkinos is our fastest flow we can get

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.390 
karkinos is our fastest flow we can get
up<00:03:34.900> to<00:03:34.930> 8<00:03:35.530> miles<00:03:35.800> an<00:03:35.950> hour

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
up to 8 miles an hour

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.060 
up to 8 miles an hour
so<00:03:36.910> we<00:03:37.060> look<00:03:37.240> for<00:03:37.390> the<00:03:37.510> slack<00:03:37.750> tide<00:03:38.440> period<00:03:38.860> and

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:39.070 
so we look for the slack tide period and

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.330 
so we look for the slack tide period and
we'll<00:03:39.190> dive<00:03:39.400> the<00:03:39.610> slacks<00:03:39.880> when<00:03:40.540> we<00:03:40.690> dive

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
we'll dive the slacks when we dive

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.430 
we'll dive the slacks when we dive
controlled<00:03:42.340> channels<00:03:42.820> like<00:03:43.090> for<00:03:43.440> California

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
controlled channels like for California

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.110 
controlled channels like for California

for<00:03:48.250> us<00:03:48.340> so<00:03:48.520> that<00:03:48.670> we<00:03:48.760> can<00:03:48.940> get<00:03:49.120> in<00:03:49.240> there<00:03:49.450> we

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
for us so that we can get in there we

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.420 
for us so that we can get in there we
try<00:03:50.650> and<00:03:50.860> dive<00:03:51.190> less<00:03:51.850> than<00:03:52.410> a<00:03:53.410> mile<00:03:54.040> and<00:03:54.220> a<00:03:54.250> half

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
try and dive less than a mile and a half

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.420 
try and dive less than a mile and a half
an<00:03:54.550> hour<00:03:55.140> that<00:03:56.140> gives<00:03:56.440> us<00:03:56.590> the<00:03:56.740> best<00:03:57.010> ability

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
an hour that gives us the best ability

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.910 
an hour that gives us the best ability
to<00:03:57.520> do<00:03:57.730> our<00:03:57.910> job<00:03:58.180> do<00:03:58.420> our<00:03:58.540> inspections<00:03:59.170> in

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
to do our job do our inspections in

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.670 
to do our job do our inspections in
terms<00:04:00.250> of<00:04:00.430> the<00:04:00.520> murky<00:04:00.820> water<00:04:01.050> if<00:04:02.050> we<00:04:02.110> have<00:04:02.440> over

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
terms of the murky water if we have over

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.070 
terms of the murky water if we have over
a<00:04:02.709> foot<00:04:02.950> of<00:04:03.040> visibility<00:04:03.450> we're<00:04:04.450> lucky<00:04:04.810> so

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:05.080 
a foot of visibility we're lucky so

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.020 
a foot of visibility we're lucky so
we're<00:04:05.500> pretty<00:04:05.770> much<00:04:05.950> used<00:04:06.250> to<00:04:06.340> a<00:04:06.430> foot<00:04:06.700> or<00:04:06.820> less

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
we're pretty much used to a foot or less

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.360 
we're pretty much used to a foot or less
so<00:04:07.360> murky<00:04:08.230> water<00:04:08.440> is<00:04:08.620> just<00:04:08.830> part<00:04:09.070> of<00:04:09.100> the<00:04:09.190> job

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
so murky water is just part of the job

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:10.710 
so murky water is just part of the job
that's<00:04:10.150> crazy

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
that's crazy

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.050 
that's crazy
that's<00:04:11.020> that's<00:04:11.290> really<00:04:11.590> incredible<00:04:12.310> so<00:04:12.670> sorry

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
that's that's really incredible so sorry

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.630 
that's that's really incredible so sorry

he's<00:05:19.270> telling<00:05:19.629> me<00:05:19.659> all<00:05:19.840> that<00:05:19.990> I'm<00:05:20.229> looking<00:05:20.590> at

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:20.740 
he's telling me all that I'm looking at

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.100 
he's telling me all that I'm looking at
him<00:05:21.120> making<00:05:22.120> sure<00:05:22.360> that<00:05:22.539> everything's<00:05:22.900> on

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:23.110 
him making sure that everything's on

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:25.379 
him making sure that everything's on
because<00:05:23.530> ultimately<00:05:23.860> his<00:05:24.729> safety<00:05:25.030> is<00:05:25.240> my

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:25.389 
because ultimately his safety is my

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:27.749 
because ultimately his safety is my
responsibility<00:05:25.620> and<00:05:26.620> so<00:05:27.069> when<00:05:27.310> it's<00:05:27.460> all<00:05:27.580> done

00:05:27.749 --> 00:05:27.759 
responsibility and so when it's all done

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:29.850 
responsibility and so when it's all done
I<00:05:28.030> approve<00:05:28.539> it<00:05:28.659> I<00:05:28.840> say<00:05:29.020> okay<00:05:29.289> you're<00:05:29.469> clear<00:05:29.740> to

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:29.860 
I approve it I say okay you're clear to

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:31.110 
I approve it I say okay you're clear to
dive<00:05:30.009> and<00:05:30.280> they'll<00:05:30.430> they'll<00:05:30.759> get<00:05:30.940> in<00:05:31.060> the

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.120 
dive and they'll they'll get in the

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.140 
dive and they'll they'll get in the
water<00:05:31.300> so<00:05:32.169> why<00:05:32.349> do<00:05:32.409> we<00:05:32.620> use<00:05:32.650> a<00:05:32.860> bulky<00:05:33.699> diving

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:34.150 
water so why do we use a bulky diving

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.809 
water so why do we use a bulky diving
helmet<00:05:34.539> and<00:05:34.750> a<00:05:34.930> diving<00:05:35.590> hose<00:05:36.039> rather<00:05:36.490> than<00:05:36.789> a

00:05:36.809 --> 00:05:36.819 
helmet and a diving hose rather than a

00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:40.080 
helmet and a diving hose rather than a
regular<00:05:37.180> wetsuit<00:05:38.169> and<00:05:38.349> typical<00:05:39.219> scuba<00:05:39.909> gear

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:40.090 
regular wetsuit and typical scuba gear

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:42.719 
regular wetsuit and typical scuba gear
it<00:05:40.599> seems<00:05:40.810> a<00:05:40.930> little<00:05:41.050> cumbersome<00:05:41.620> well<00:05:42.190> it<00:05:42.370> may

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:42.729 
it seems a little cumbersome well it may

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:44.399 
it seems a little cumbersome well it may
seem<00:05:43.000> redundant<00:05:43.180> for<00:05:43.630> me<00:05:43.719> to<00:05:43.810> say<00:05:43.960> this<00:05:44.139> again

00:05:44.399 --> 00:05:44.409 
seem redundant for me to say this again

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:47.100 
seem redundant for me to say this again
but<00:05:44.740> it<00:05:44.830> all<00:05:44.979> goes<00:05:45.159> back<00:05:45.219> to<00:05:45.580> diver<00:05:45.789> safety<00:05:46.240> we

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:47.110 
but it all goes back to diver safety we

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:48.600 
but it all goes back to diver safety we
want<00:05:47.380> to<00:05:47.469> make<00:05:47.590> sure<00:05:47.710> that<00:05:47.889> our<00:05:47.949> divers<00:05:48.460> are

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:48.610 
want to make sure that our divers are

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:52.559 
want to make sure that our divers are
nice<00:05:48.819> and<00:05:49.060> safe<00:05:49.300> the<00:05:50.289> hardhat<00:05:51.300> because<00:05:52.300> on<00:05:52.449> the

00:05:52.559 --> 00:05:52.569 
nice and safe the hardhat because on the

00:05:52.569 --> 00:05:55.439 
nice and safe the hardhat because on the
divers<00:05:52.870> head<00:05:53.080> keeps<00:05:53.500> their<00:05:53.710> head<00:05:53.860> warm<00:05:54.449> they

it to their breathing rate I can talk to
them<00:06:04.690> I<00:06:04.930> can<00:06:05.590> tell<00:06:05.800> how<00:06:06.099> they're<00:06:06.279> doing<00:06:06.610> just

00:06:07.529 --> 00:06:07.539 
them I can tell how they're doing just

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:09.869 
them I can tell how they're doing just
by<00:06:07.659> simply<00:06:07.990> having<00:06:08.860> a<00:06:08.949> conversation<00:06:09.310> I<00:06:09.819> know

00:06:09.869 --> 00:06:09.879 
by simply having a conversation I know

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:11.279 
by simply having a conversation I know
whether<00:06:10.180> they're<00:06:10.419> stressed<00:06:10.810> or<00:06:10.990> they're<00:06:11.139> not

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:11.289

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:14.580 
whether they're stressed or they're not
stressed<00:06:11.710> and<00:06:12.669> if<00:06:13.000> I<00:06:13.120> need<00:06:13.330> to<00:06:13.569> if<00:06:13.779> they<00:06:14.349> sound

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:14.590 
stressed and if I need to if they sound

stressed<00:06:14.889> to<00:06:15.069> me<00:06:15.099> I<00:06:15.219> can<00:06:15.460> pull<00:06:15.669> the<00:06:16.000> diver<00:06:16.210> out

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:16.360 
stressed to me I can pull the diver out

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.300 
stressed to me I can pull the diver out
I've<00:06:17.229> gotten<00:06:17.500> to<00:06:17.590> where<00:06:17.680> I<00:06:17.740> know<00:06:17.860> all<00:06:18.190> the

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:18.310 
I've gotten to where I know all the

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:20.100 
I've gotten to where I know all the
divers<00:06:18.729> and<00:06:19.330> I<00:06:19.449> know<00:06:19.509> how<00:06:19.810> they<00:06:19.960> are

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:20.110 
divers and I know how they are

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:23.550 
divers and I know how they are
underwater<00:06:20.529> and<00:06:20.860> so<00:06:21.370> I<00:06:21.400> can<00:06:21.669> monitor<00:06:21.879> that<00:06:22.560> in

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:23.560 
underwater and so I can monitor that in

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:24.990 
underwater and so I can monitor that in
addition<00:06:24.009> to<00:06:24.039> that<00:06:24.129> since<00:06:24.580> it's<00:06:24.789> an

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:25.000 
addition to that since it's an

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.909 
addition to that since it's an
engineering<00:06:25.479> inspection<00:06:26.080> and<00:06:26.259> that's<00:06:26.590> kind

00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:26.919 
engineering inspection and that's kind

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:29.010 
engineering inspection and that's kind
of<00:06:26.979> the<00:06:27.069> second<00:06:27.370> thing<00:06:27.550> is<00:06:27.789> we<00:06:28.690> can<00:06:28.870> take

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:29.020 
of the second thing is we can take

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:31.680 
of the second thing is we can take
real-time<00:06:29.789> accurate<00:06:30.789> notes<00:06:31.000> as<00:06:31.300> the<00:06:31.509> diver

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:31.690 
real-time accurate notes as the diver

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:33.779 
real-time accurate notes as the diver
dictates<00:06:32.229> them<00:06:32.409> if<00:06:32.860> we<00:06:33.039> were<00:06:33.159> diving<00:06:33.520> scuba

00:06:33.779 --> 00:06:33.789 
dictates them if we were diving scuba

00:06:33.789 --> 00:06:35.610 
dictates them if we were diving scuba
they'd<00:06:34.270> have<00:06:34.449> to<00:06:34.599> remember<00:06:35.050> it<00:06:35.169> all<00:06:35.289> and<00:06:35.440> bring

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:35.620 
they'd have to remember it all and bring

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:36.899 
they'd have to remember it all and bring
it<00:06:35.710> back<00:06:35.830> to<00:06:36.009> the<00:06:36.099> surface<00:06:36.310> and<00:06:36.580> then<00:06:36.699> tell

00:06:36.899 --> 00:06:36.909 
it back to the surface and then tell

00:06:36.909 --> 00:06:38.790 
it back to the surface and then tell
somebody<00:06:37.330> well<00:06:37.899> rich<00:06:38.080> don't<00:06:38.349> ever<00:06:38.529> worry

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:38.800 
somebody well rich don't ever worry

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:39.839 
somebody well rich don't ever worry
about<00:06:38.919> being<00:06:39.310> redundant<00:06:39.639> with

00:06:39.839 --> 00:06:39.849 
about being redundant with

00:06:39.849 --> 00:06:41.909 
about being redundant with
