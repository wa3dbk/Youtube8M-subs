00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:09.530
 brad pitt bull 

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:11.450
 follow the story of a hero 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.219
 without a man on an underground base who 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:14.900
 leave using your hook 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:17.630
 there is always when you hit big 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:20.720
 master this active mine and you need to 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:23.960
 catapult watch call up and 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:26.089
 will have reflex of jumping the hook of the mine 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.550
 where you touch her what makes a game 

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:29.599
 very challenging and will have a lot of 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.400
 first minutes because it is enough 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:34.370
 difficult even animals did not win 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.960
 playing and I'm not good so faith and 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.030
 Victory listeners are actually seeing is 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.110
 very difficult but it is legal for the graph that is 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.399
 where does he come from 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.890
 he was inspired by a game of 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:44.719
 typing called a strike and thanks to this 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.640
 yes little game of typing they can 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:48.890
 do in this game he has a 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.210
 extremely simple and obvious mechanics 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.280
 in games with extremely mechanical 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.620
 mainly by encouraging the 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.420
 developer there really takes a step 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.640
 besides and that thing I've always said 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.960
 much this in the video of that monster walks 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.190
 with blackberry mini balls on the 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.199
 developer is not afraid to do 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.630
 small jobs to do your 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:06.860
 work he passed June he just had 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.390
 on the network and see what 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.000
 and again a good game went well 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.740
 addictive totally focused on the mechanics 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.420
 serious mistake he did not play so cool 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.250
 so you play on the pc and also have a 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.659
 version for iphone and ipad that is 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.920
 extremely addictive for you to play 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:20.420
 there at the time of procrastination 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.270
 Unfortunately, there is no where to go. 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.400
 I stayed in the hand but you have an iphone is 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.470
 a right purchase look for past graffiti 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.090
 eight years you will find the boy there that 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.680
 was developed by two guys who 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.470
 atomic remained with the graphic and 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:36.740
 development and the baronoski dn 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:39.380
 This guy is one of the game's composers. 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.570
 independent of those who made 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.899
