magic<00:00:29.079> for<00:00:30.079> the<00:00:31.480> call<00:00:32.480> it's<00:00:32.809> the<00:00:33.910> super<00:00:34.910> heat

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:35.590 
magic for the call it's the super heat

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:37.840

because<00:00:36.590> basically<00:00:36.920> what<00:00:37.190> we're<00:00:37.340> gonna<00:00:37.460> do<00:00:37.640> is

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
because basically what we're gonna do is

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:44.439 
because basically what we're gonna do is
a<00:00:37.879> mine<00:00:38.780> or<00:00:39.140> and<00:00:40.039> turn<00:00:40.699> into<00:00:40.910> bars<00:00:42.339> on<00:00:43.339> the<00:00:44.239> spot

00:00:44.439 --> 00:00:44.449 
a mine or and turn into bars on the spot

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:50.079 
a mine or and turn into bars on the spot
so<00:00:45.940> your<00:00:46.940> mining<00:00:47.719> XP<00:00:48.530> then<00:00:49.219> submitting

so your mining XP then submitting

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:51.729 
so your mining XP then submitting
because<00:00:50.539> of<00:00:50.629> the<00:00:50.690> spell<00:00:50.960> gives<00:00:51.260> you<00:00:51.350> smelling

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.740 
mind some iron ore to make steel bars of
course<00:02:42.900> you<00:02:43.260> the<00:02:44.099> reason<00:02:44.430> I'm<00:02:45.239> not<00:02:45.299> making

come on spa there you go okay so now
we're<00:03:17.500> going<00:03:17.620> to<00:03:17.680> head<00:03:18.189> over<00:03:18.219> to<00:03:18.519> the<00:03:18.579> spell

00:03:18.899 --> 00:03:18.909 
we're going to head over to the spell

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:24.380 
we're going to head over to the spell
book<00:03:18.939> and<00:03:21.150> click<00:03:22.150> on<00:03:22.299> a<00:03:22.359> nice<00:03:22.959> super<00:03:23.650> heat<00:03:23.890> and

super heat the iron ore and you can

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.500 
super heat the iron ore and you can
automatically<00:03:27.519> spray<00:03:28.030> it<00:03:28.150> into<00:03:28.329> steel<00:03:28.870> bars

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:58.640 
load and how much money you would make
put<00:03:52.750> a<00:03:52.780> full<00:03:53.019> load<00:03:53.200> so<00:03:53.879> stick<00:03:54.879> to<00:03:54.909> it<00:03:55.409> see<00:03:56.409> ya

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650

okay<00:03:59.650> so<00:03:59.709> here's<00:04:00.400> free<00:04:00.579> calculation<00:04:01.919> first<00:04:02.919> of

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
okay so here's free calculation first of

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.929 
okay so here's free calculation first of
all<00:04:03.069> I'm<00:04:03.730> going<00:04:03.879> to<00:04:03.970> talk<00:04:04.060> about<00:04:04.209> XP<00:04:05.459> now<00:04:06.459> every
