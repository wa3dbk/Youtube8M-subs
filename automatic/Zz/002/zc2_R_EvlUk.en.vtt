00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.750 
what's green underneath there that means
that<00:00:36.660> it<00:00:36.899> is<00:00:37.050> alive<00:00:37.469> so<00:00:38.100> although<00:00:38.250> this<00:00:38.520> tree

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
that it is alive so although this tree

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.100 
that it is alive so although this tree
looks<00:00:38.969> dead<00:00:39.180> in<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.450> middle<00:00:39.660> of<00:00:39.750> winter<00:00:39.870> it

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
looks dead in the middle of winter it

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.799 
looks dead in the middle of winter it
definitely<00:00:40.620> is<00:00:40.739> alive<00:00:41.040> so<00:00:41.670> check<00:00:42.420> that<00:00:42.450> first

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
definitely is alive so check that first

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.030 
definitely is alive so check that first
to<00:00:43.079> make<00:00:43.200> sure<00:00:43.350> before<00:00:43.559> you<00:00:43.800> make<00:00:43.920> the

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
to make sure before you make the

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:44.660

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
this branch here I have some smaller

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.410 
this branch here I have some smaller
little<00:01:04.619> twigs<00:01:05.129> I'm<00:01:05.339> gonna<00:01:05.519> I'm<00:01:05.909> gonna<00:01:06.119> remove

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
little twigs I'm gonna I'm gonna remove

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.090 
little twigs I'm gonna I'm gonna remove
off<00:01:06.630> so<00:01:06.840> I<00:01:06.900> leave<00:01:07.080> this<00:01:07.200> main<00:01:07.530> leader<00:01:07.830> so<00:01:08.070> I

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
off so I leave this main leader so I

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.920 
off so I leave this main leader so I
think<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.430> lot<00:01:08.580> of<00:01:08.640> these<00:01:08.850> off<00:01:09.090> because<00:01:09.720> you

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
think a lot of these off because you

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.510 
think a lot of these off because you
don't<00:01:09.960> want<00:01:10.409> a<00:01:10.619> tree<00:01:11.040> that's<00:01:11.250> really

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
don't want a tree that's really

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.270 
don't want a tree that's really
top-heavy<00:01:12.030> could<00:01:12.840> become<00:01:13.260> could<00:01:13.920> become<00:01:14.250> too

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
top-heavy could become could become too

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.160 
top-heavy could become could become too
large<00:01:14.700> it<00:01:14.939> could<00:01:15.119> fall<00:01:15.360> over<00:01:15.390> so<00:01:15.840> you<00:01:15.930> want<00:01:16.080> to

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
large it could fall over so you want to

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.450 
large it could fall over so you want to
make<00:01:16.290> sure<00:01:16.320> there's<00:01:16.560> a<00:01:16.590> lot<00:01:16.740> of<00:01:16.830> air<00:01:17.040> inside

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
make sure there's a lot of air inside

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.130 
make sure there's a lot of air inside
the<00:01:17.640> tree<00:01:17.880> start<00:01:18.420> pruning<00:01:18.600> all<00:01:18.780> these<00:01:18.930> off

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
the tree start pruning all these off

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.899 
the tree start pruning all these off
this<00:01:19.409> one<00:01:19.619> this<00:01:20.130> branch<00:01:20.430> is<00:01:20.580> not<00:01:20.729> really<00:01:20.880> a

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
this one this branch is not really a

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.910 
this one this branch is not really a
main<00:01:21.119> chute<00:01:21.420> it's<00:01:21.570> kind<00:01:21.750> of<00:01:21.840> taken<00:01:22.170> over<00:01:22.380> so

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
main chute it's kind of taken over so

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.149

really<00:01:30.930> good<00:01:31.079> pair<00:01:31.350> of<00:01:31.500> pruning<00:01:31.920> shears<00:01:32.189> which

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
really good pair of pruning shears which

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.890 
really good pair of pruning shears which
is<00:01:32.520> really<00:01:33.000> important<00:01:33.360> I<00:01:33.420> can't<00:01:33.600> stress<00:01:33.869> that

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
is really important I can't stress that

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.679 
is really important I can't stress that
enough<00:01:34.110> when<00:01:35.009> you're<00:01:35.159> pruning<00:01:35.340> trees<00:01:35.790> or

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
enough when you're pruning trees or

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.690 
enough when you're pruning trees or
shrubs<00:01:36.720> temper<00:01:37.320> a<00:01:37.350> really<00:01:37.619> good<00:01:37.770> pair<00:01:38.040> let<00:01:38.549> the

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
shrubs temper a really good pair let the

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.429 
shrubs temper a really good pair let the
pruners<00:01:39.060> do<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.360> work<00:01:39.540> so<00:01:39.900> that<00:01:40.049> branch<00:01:40.229> is

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
pruners do the work so that branch is

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.230 
pruners do the work so that branch is
all<00:01:40.590> set<00:01:40.829> that's<00:01:40.979> ready<00:01:41.189> to<00:01:41.220> leaf<00:01:41.430> out<00:01:41.640> so<00:01:42.180> I'm

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
all set that's ready to leaf out so I'm

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.700 
all set that's ready to leaf out so I'm
gonna<00:01:42.360> keep<00:01:42.540> going<00:01:42.630> with<00:01:42.930> this<00:01:43.200> tree<00:01:43.470> and<00:01:43.619> then

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
gonna keep going with this tree and then

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:44.870 
gonna keep going with this tree and then
we'll<00:01:43.799> come<00:01:44.009> to<00:01:44.130> check<00:01:44.310> back<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:44.670> take<00:01:44.759> a<00:01:44.790> look

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
out you know I am taking a lot off of

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.469 
out you know I am taking a lot off of
this<00:01:50.130> tree<00:01:50.340> but<00:01:50.460> don't<00:01:50.610> forget<00:01:50.729> crape<00:01:51.180> myrtles

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479

this tree but don't forget crape myrtles
are<00:01:51.540> extremely<00:01:52.259> fast<00:01:52.439> growing<00:01:52.710> trees<00:01:53.040> they

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
are extremely fast growing trees they

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.730 
are extremely fast growing trees they
can<00:01:53.670> grow<00:01:53.790> four<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.149> six<00:01:54.450> feet<00:01:54.509> a<00:01:54.720> year<00:01:54.810> so<00:01:55.560> it's

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
can grow four to six feet a year so it's

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.200 
can grow four to six feet a year so it's
okay<00:01:56.070> that<00:01:56.250> I<00:01:56.310> pruned<00:01:56.579> it<00:01:56.670> really<00:01:56.880> hard<00:01:57.119> and
