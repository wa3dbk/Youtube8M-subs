portal<00:02:22.170> instantly<00:02:22.650> then<00:02:23.040> do<00:02:23.190> didn't<00:02:23.700> just<00:02:23.820> do

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
portal instantly then do didn't just do

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.720 
portal instantly then do didn't just do
this<00:02:24.150> the<00:02:24.360> portal<00:02:24.630> career<00:02:24.870> it's<00:02:25.110> a<00:02:25.170> lot<00:02:25.440> easier

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
this the portal career it's a lot easier

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.030 
this the portal career it's a lot easier
you'll<00:02:26.730> need<00:02:26.910> to<00:02:27.030> use<00:02:27.060> six<00:02:27.900> blocks<00:02:28.200> of<00:02:28.440> this<00:02:28.620> to

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
you'll need to use six blocks of this to

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.890 
you'll need to use six blocks of this to
jims<00:02:29.340> and<00:02:29.640> just<00:02:30.030> put<00:02:30.210> the<00:02:30.300> portal<00:02:30.570> starter<00:02:30.840> in

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
jims and just put the portal starter in

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.500 
jims and just put the portal starter in
the<00:02:31.020> middle<00:02:31.320> so<00:02:31.890> i'll<00:02:31.980> drag<00:02:32.310> that<00:02:32.640> out<00:02:32.700> this<00:02:33.330> is

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
the middle so i'll drag that out this is

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.020 
the middle so i'll drag that out this is
ivan<00:02:34.380> recommending<00:02:35.220> this<00:02:35.400> way<00:02:35.610> it's<00:02:35.850> a<00:02:35.880> lot

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
ivan recommending this way it's a lot

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.050 
ivan recommending this way it's a lot
easier<00:02:36.060> to<00:02:36.420> get<00:02:36.600> there<00:02:36.870> it's<00:02:37.260> the<00:02:37.410> dimension<00:02:38.060> c

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
easier to get there it's the dimension c

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.210 
easier to get there it's the dimension c
is<00:02:39.300> certainly<00:02:39.690> it<00:02:40.170> creates<00:02:40.500> it<00:02:40.680> for<00:02:40.920> you<00:02:41.480> so

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
is certainly it creates it for you so

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:48.020 
is certainly it creates it for you so
let's<00:02:44.220> check<00:02:44.460> out<00:02:44.640> this<00:02:44.790> dimension<00:02:46.340> now<00:02:47.340> okay

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
let's check out this dimension now okay

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.350 
let's check out this dimension now okay
so<00:02:48.780> sometimes<00:02:49.500> it<00:02:49.680> will<00:02:49.770> spawn<00:02:50.160> you<00:02:50.880> know<00:02:50.970> it's

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
so sometimes it will spawn you know it's

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.560 
so sometimes it will spawn you know it's
kind<00:02:51.600> of<00:02:51.630> in<00:02:51.780> the<00:02:51.810> early<00:02:52.800> stages<00:02:53.330> sometimes<00:02:54.330> it

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
kind of in the early stages sometimes it

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.930 
kind of in the early stages sometimes it
will<00:02:54.690> spawn<00:02:55.050> in<00:02:55.350> the<00:02:55.650> middle<00:02:55.980> of<00:02:56.100> the<00:02:56.160> air<00:02:56.400> it's

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
will spawn in the middle of the air it's

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.130 
will spawn in the middle of the air it's
happened<00:02:57.240> to<00:02:57.300> me<00:02:57.420> before<00:02:57.980> so<00:02:59.870> basically<00:03:00.870> on

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
happened to me before so basically on

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.440 
happened to me before so basically on
dragonvale<00:03:01.560> you<00:03:01.830> have<00:03:02.070> a<00:03:02.100> bunch<00:03:02.640> of<00:03:02.760> islands
