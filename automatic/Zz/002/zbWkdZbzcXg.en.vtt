00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.940 
so I would have left I keep like putting
it<00:02:00.299> back<00:02:00.479> into<00:02:00.689> like<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.200> film<00:02:01.469> that<00:02:01.829> it

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
it back into like the film that it

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.739 
it back into like the film that it
originally<00:02:02.459> came<00:02:02.579> in<00:02:03.030> and<00:02:03.889> when<00:02:04.889> you<00:02:05.039> open<00:02:05.459> it

00:02:05.739 --> 00:02:05.749

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930
