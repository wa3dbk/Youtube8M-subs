00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 
a charger i bought this at gizmos hobby

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:15.590 
a charger i bought this at gizmos hobby
store<00:01:13.619> in<00:01:13.920> Burbank<00:01:14.520> and<00:01:14.939> that's<00:01:15.150> actually<00:01:15.540> a

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
store in Burbank and that's actually a

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.969 
store in Burbank and that's actually a
pretty<00:01:15.659> high-tech<00:01:16.140> charger<00:01:16.590> that<00:01:16.740> will<00:01:16.830> just

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
pretty high-tech charger that will just

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.679 
pretty high-tech charger that will just
these<00:01:17.430> batteries<00:01:17.759> will<00:01:17.939> actually<00:01:18.210> charged<00:01:18.479> up

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
these batteries will actually charged up

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.249 
these batteries will actually charged up
in<00:01:18.810> about<00:01:19.020> 15<00:01:19.439> minutes<00:01:19.680> and<00:01:20.750> if<00:01:21.750> you<00:01:21.930> do<00:01:22.080> this

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
in about 15 minutes and if you do this

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.920 
in about 15 minutes and if you do this
modification<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:23.130> your<00:01:23.159> level<00:01:23.659> you'll<00:01:24.659> notice

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
modification to your level you'll notice

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.590 
modification to your level you'll notice
that<00:01:25.049> you'll<00:01:25.860> have<00:01:25.920> about<00:01:26.340> about<00:01:27.150> a<00:01:27.180> fifty

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
that you'll have about about a fifty

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.600 
that you'll have about about a fifty
percent<00:01:27.930> power<00:01:28.170> increase<00:01:28.740> so<00:01:28.950> it'll<00:01:29.310> be<00:01:29.400> much

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
percent power increase so it'll be much

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.990 
percent power increase so it'll be much
louder<00:01:30.320> if<00:01:31.320> your<00:01:31.590> street<00:01:31.860> preaching<00:01:32.070> or

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
louder if your street preaching or

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.310 
louder if your street preaching or
whatever<00:01:33.299> you're<00:01:33.450> using<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.780> rebel<00:01:34.110> floor

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
whatever you're using the rebel floor

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.789 
whatever you're using the rebel floor
it'll<00:01:34.530> last<00:01:34.829> many<00:01:35.820> hours<00:01:35.939> I<00:01:36.740> usually<00:01:37.740> only

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
it'll last many hours I usually only

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.340 
it'll last many hours I usually only
charge<00:01:38.100> us<00:01:38.250> about<00:01:38.430> once<00:01:38.729> a<00:01:38.850> week<00:01:38.880> at<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:40.200> most

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
charge us about once a week at the most

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.310 
charge us about once a week at the most
and<00:01:40.979> I<00:01:41.159> probably<00:01:41.549> go<00:01:41.759> out<00:01:41.899> several<00:01:42.899> times<00:01:43.049> a

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
and I probably go out several times a

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.880 
and I probably go out several times a
week<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:43.619> use<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:44.070> unit<00:01:44.430> it's<00:01:44.670> much<00:01:44.850> louder

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
week and use the unit it's much louder

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.100 
week and use the unit it's much louder
and<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.159> calculation<00:01:47.759> I've<00:01:47.880> done<00:01:48.060> shows<00:01:48.930> that

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
and the calculation I've done shows that

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.020 
and the calculation I've done shows that
allows<00:01:49.350> about<00:01:49.649> 10<00:01:49.890> to<00:01:50.070> 20<00:01:50.280> times<00:01:50.399> longer<00:01:50.850> than

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
allows about 10 to 20 times longer than

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.440 
allows about 10 to 20 times longer than
a<00:01:51.210> 9-volt<00:01:51.600> battery<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:52.710> and<00:01:53.040> this<00:01:53.759> cop<00:01:54.030> costs

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
a 9-volt battery and and this cop costs

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.959 
a 9-volt battery and and this cop costs
about<00:01:54.540> you<00:01:55.500> got<00:01:55.649> about<00:01:55.860> fifty<00:01:56.490> dollars<00:01:56.820> in

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
about you got about fifty dollars in

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.910 
about you got about fifty dollars in
parts<00:01:57.270> here<00:01:57.450> with<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.750> batteries<00:01:58.200> this

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
parts here with the batteries this

particular<00:01:59.250> charging<00:01:59.969> unit<00:02:00.240> right<00:02:00.360> here<00:02:00.420> was

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
particular charging unit right here was

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.609 
particular charging unit right here was
about<00:02:01.430> forty<00:02:02.430> dollars<00:02:02.820> so<00:02:03.450> but<00:02:04.290> that's<00:02:04.469> not

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
and there's a there's the male molex

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.500 
and there's a there's the male molex
connector<00:02:32.230> end<00:02:32.260> and<00:02:32.860> also<00:02:33.760> on<00:02:33.910> the<00:02:34.030> other<00:02:34.209> side

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510

of the bag you'll notice I put one there

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.760 
of the bag you'll notice I put one there
so<00:02:36.700> each<00:02:37.360> one<00:02:37.390> of<00:02:37.630> these<00:02:37.720> batteries<00:02:38.140> can<00:02:38.590> go

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
so each one of these batteries can go

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.160 
so each one of these batteries can go
like<00:02:39.040> this<00:02:39.190> one<00:02:39.430> will<00:02:39.850> go<00:02:40.000> on<00:02:40.030> this<00:02:40.300> side<00:02:40.540> like

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
like this one will go on this side like

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.390 
like this one will go on this side like
that<00:02:41.760> this<00:02:42.760> one<00:02:43.000> will<00:02:43.780> go<00:02:43.840> on<00:02:44.110> this<00:02:44.320> side<00:02:44.560> like
