in effect until 11 local time but let's

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.510 
in effect until 11 local time but let's
focus<00:00:54.390> in<00:00:54.780> and<00:00:55.140> talk<00:00:55.500> more<00:00:55.770> about<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.309> wood

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
focus in and talk more about the wood

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.880 
focus in and talk more about the wood
which<00:00:57.030> includes<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.629> downtown<00:00:58.170> Boston<00:00:58.680> area

which includes the downtown Boston area

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.040 
which includes the downtown Boston area
again<00:00:59.609> we've<00:00:59.789> been<00:00:59.969> watching<00:01:00.180> this<00:01:00.570> area<00:01:01.020> very

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
again we've been watching this area very

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.979 
again we've been watching this area very
very<00:01:01.710> closely<00:01:01.980> because<00:01:02.550> just<00:01:03.149> south<00:01:03.690> of

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
very closely because just south of

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.080 
very closely because just south of
Boston<00:01:04.589> crossing<00:01:05.040> over<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.309> northern<00:01:05.760> parts

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
Boston crossing over the northern parts

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.450 
Boston crossing over the northern parts
of<00:01:06.180> Rhode<00:01:06.420> Island<00:01:06.960> we<00:01:07.380> have<00:01:07.590> an<00:01:07.830> individual

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
of Rhode Island we have an individual

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.399 
of Rhode Island we have an individual
cell<00:01:08.760> that<00:01:09.119> has<00:01:09.240> been<00:01:09.450> creating<00:01:09.930> some<00:01:10.170> major

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
cell that has been creating some major

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.830 
cell that has been creating some major
major<00:01:10.770> problems<00:01:11.430> in<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.670> area<00:01:12.030> so<00:01:12.450> let's<00:01:12.630> get

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
major problems in the area so let's get

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.990 
major problems in the area so let's get
a<00:01:12.869> little<00:01:13.170> bit<00:01:13.560> closer<00:01:13.830> if<00:01:14.159> we<00:01:14.310> can<00:01:14.549> to<00:01:14.729> show

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
a little bit closer if we can to show

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.210 
a little bit closer if we can to show
you<00:01:15.060> because<00:01:15.720> that<00:01:15.900> cell<00:01:16.350> has<00:01:16.619> potential<00:01:17.189> to

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
you because that cell has potential to

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.429 
you because that cell has potential to
produce<00:01:17.490> high<00:01:17.939> waves<00:01:18.330> as<00:01:18.600> well<00:01:18.869> as<00:01:18.990> some<00:01:19.170> small

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
produce high waves as well as some small

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.620 
produce high waves as well as some small
hail<00:01:19.470> stones<00:01:20.009> moving<00:01:20.670> right<00:01:20.880> across<00:01:21.360> the

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
hail stones moving right across the

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.450 
hail stones moving right across the
northern<00:01:22.049> parts<00:01:22.350> of<00:01:22.409> rhode<00:01:22.650> island<00:01:23.070> for<00:01:23.310> the

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
northern parts of rhode island for the

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.670 
northern parts of rhode island for the
Providence<00:01:23.970> area<00:01:24.180> we<00:01:24.869> will<00:01:25.049> continue<00:01:25.530> to

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
Providence area we will continue to

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.310 
Providence area we will continue to
monitor<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:26.250> area<00:01:26.430> very<00:01:26.820> very<00:01:27.150> closely<00:01:27.390> as<00:01:27.810> we

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
monitor the area very very closely as we

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.530 
monitor the area very very closely as we
progress<00:01:28.560> deeper<00:01:29.490> into<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.030> evening<00:01:30.270> hours

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
progress deeper into the evening hours

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.390 
progress deeper into the evening hours
because<00:01:30.930> this<00:01:31.290> could<00:01:31.530> be<00:01:31.680> a<00:01:31.710> potentially

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
because this could be a potentially

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.399 
because this could be a potentially
dangerous<00:01:32.909> situation<00:01:33.270> again<00:01:34.170> with<00:01:34.320> the

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
dangerous situation again with the

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.980 
dangerous situation again with the
histones<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.460> high<00:01:35.670> winds<00:01:36.210> out<00:01:36.420> of<00:01:36.479> this

histones and the high winds out of this

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.690 
histones and the high winds out of this
activity<00:01:37.439> if<00:01:37.740> we<00:01:37.860> can<00:01:38.009> go<00:01:38.189> to<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.579> other

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
activity if we can go to the other

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.550 
activity if we can go to the other
source<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:39.390> show<00:01:39.540> you<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.840> frontal<00:01:40.200> boundary

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
source and show you the frontal boundary

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.219

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.020 
overall conditions that we're expecting
in<00:01:48.450> terms<00:01:48.659> of<00:01:49.079> a<00:01:49.200> cool<00:01:49.500> down<00:01:49.829> over<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.340> next<00:01:50.579> 24

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
in terms of a cool down over the next 24

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.539 
in terms of a cool down over the next 24
to<00:01:51.060> 48<00:01:51.329> hours<00:01:51.659> cooler<00:01:52.530> air<00:01:52.710> on<00:01:52.920> this<00:01:53.159> side<00:01:53.399> of

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
to 48 hours cooler air on this side of

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.160 
to 48 hours cooler air on this side of
the<00:01:53.640> front<00:01:53.880> but<00:01:54.060> right<00:01:54.299> on<00:01:54.329> ahead<00:01:54.570> of<00:01:54.780> it<00:01:54.899> still

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
the front but right on ahead of it still

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.499 
the front but right on ahead of it still
very<00:01:55.590> raw<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:55.979> moist<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:56.670> unstable<00:01:56.759> and

very raw and moist and unstable and

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.240 
very raw and moist and unstable and
that's<00:01:57.899> why<00:01:58.110> those<00:01:58.350> thunderstorms<00:01:58.740> have

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
that's why those thunderstorms have

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.580 
that's why those thunderstorms have
started<00:01:59.700> to<00:01:59.790> break<00:02:00.000> out<00:02:00.210> but<00:02:00.810> as<00:02:01.079> we<00:02:01.439> go

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
started to break out but as we go

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.230 
started to break out but as we go
through<00:02:01.829> time<00:02:02.070> we're<00:02:02.310> expecting<00:02:02.850> things<00:02:03.060> to

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
through time we're expecting things to

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.840

change over again starting tomorrow but

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.419

that<00:02:06.000> transitional<00:02:06.960> period<00:02:07.469> again<00:02:08.069> and<00:02:08.310> we

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
that transitional period again and we

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.270 
that transitional period again and we
have<00:02:08.550> to<00:02:08.700> deal<00:02:08.879> with<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.209> severe<00:02:09.569> weather

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280

only 76 in Burlington Vermont so

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.230
