00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
tone down the way that I was trained to

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.810 
tone down the way that I was trained to
paint<00:02:39.630> and<00:02:39.900> then<00:02:40.590> I<00:02:40.620> like<00:02:41.070> to<00:02:41.250> put<00:02:41.460> the<00:02:41.580> line

animation class my drawing class for
animators<00:02:47.610> I<00:02:48.830> try<00:02:49.830> to<00:02:49.890> push<00:02:50.340> the<00:02:50.580> line<00:02:50.790> for

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.330 
animators I try to push the line for
them<00:02:51.360> a<00:02:51.390> little<00:02:51.720> bit<00:02:51.840> more<00:02:52.080> and<00:02:52.290> so<00:02:52.740> I've

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
them a little bit more and so I've

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.510 
them a little bit more and so I've
taught<00:02:53.940> myself<00:02:54.180> line<00:02:54.720> and<00:02:55.020> now<00:02:55.620> I<00:02:55.650> like<00:02:56.100> it<00:02:56.130> and

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
taught myself line and now I like it and

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.030 
taught myself line and now I like it and
I<00:02:57.000> think<00:02:57.060> it's<00:02:57.420> really<00:02:57.750> cool<00:02:57.960> in<00:02:58.170> a<00:02:58.350> book<00:02:58.800> that

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:34.770 
the tone on top of it okay

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:37.370 
the tone on top of it okay
and<00:03:35.010> that<00:03:35.550> by<00:03:35.850> putting<00:03:36.270> the<00:03:36.390> layer<00:03:36.900> in<00:03:37.200> the

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:49.520 
coherent I socket shadow shape okay so

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.700 
coherent I socket shadow shape okay so

how do you create atmosphere you create

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.840 
how do you create atmosphere you create
atmosphere<00:04:33.150> by<00:04:33.530> utilizing<00:04:34.530> hard<00:04:35.160> and<00:04:35.520> soft

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:35.850 
atmosphere by utilizing hard and soft

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:39.020 
atmosphere by utilizing hard and soft
edges<00:04:36.120> in<00:04:36.570> strategic<00:04:37.050> locations<00:04:37.830> so<00:04:38.370> this<00:04:38.820> is

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
edges in strategic locations so this is

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.210 
edges in strategic locations so this is
definitely<00:04:39.390> going<00:04:39.900> to<00:04:39.960> be<00:04:40.170> a<00:04:40.350> soft<00:04:40.740> edge<00:04:40.980> in

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
definitely going to be a soft edge in

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:47.939 
definitely going to be a soft edge in
the<00:04:41.460> shadow<00:04:43.280> okay<00:04:44.280> so<00:04:44.340> now<00:04:44.610> this

00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:47.949
