students needed to learn on this
particular<00:00:32.610> lesson<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:33.570> I<00:00:34.020> offered<00:00:34.469> them<00:00:34.500> a

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
particular lesson and I offered them a

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.650 
particular lesson and I offered them a
couple<00:00:34.950> of<00:00:35.160> assignment<00:00:35.700> choices<00:00:36.120> for<00:00:36.329> each<00:00:36.450> of

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
couple of assignment choices for each of

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.750 
couple of assignment choices for each of
those<00:00:36.809> objectives<00:00:37.559> that's<00:00:38.160> how<00:00:38.340> we<00:00:38.399> put<00:00:38.670> the

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
those objectives that's how we put the

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.119 
those objectives that's how we put the
sealer<00:00:39.149> together<00:00:39.600> for<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.320> B<00:00:40.500> layer<00:00:40.770> then

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
sealer together for the B layer then

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.910 
sealer together for the B layer then
again<00:00:41.730> we<00:00:42.000> got<00:00:42.180> some<00:00:42.450> ideas<00:00:42.930> generated<00:00:43.170> from

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
again we got some ideas generated from

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.819 
again we got some ideas generated from
our<00:00:44.160> textbook<00:00:44.579> I<00:00:44.969> broke<00:00:45.780> that<00:00:45.989> down<00:00:46.200> into<00:00:46.440> some

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
our textbook I broke that down into some

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.709 
our textbook I broke that down into some
main<00:00:48.440> general<00:00:50.059> categories<00:00:51.059> compare<00:00:51.570> and

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
main general categories compare and

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.650 
main general categories compare and
contrast<00:00:51.860> problem<00:00:52.860> solving<00:00:53.660> actually

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
contrast problem solving actually

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.209 
contrast problem solving actually
demonstrate<00:00:55.199> that<00:00:55.320> you<00:00:55.440> know<00:00:55.559> these<00:00:55.710> ideas

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
demonstrate that you know these ideas

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.819 
demonstrate that you know these ideas
and<00:00:56.430> again<00:00:57.000> I<00:00:57.030> listed<00:00:57.570> some<00:00:57.840> assignment

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
and again I listed some assignment

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.889 
and again I listed some assignment
choices<00:00:59.309> for<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.609> students<00:01:00.090> to<00:01:00.149> do<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.690> meet

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
choices for the students to do to meet

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.039 
choices for the students to do to meet
those<00:01:01.140> particular<00:01:01.910> objectives<00:01:02.910> today<00:01:03.480> then

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
those particular objectives today then

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.230 
those particular objectives today then
we<00:01:04.290> want<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.619> work<00:01:04.830> on<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.189> a<00:01:05.400> layer<00:01:05.790> that's

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
we want to work on the a layer that's

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.480 
we want to work on the a layer that's
our<00:01:06.479> last<00:01:06.689> layer<00:01:07.140> for<00:01:07.500> layered<00:01:07.710> curriculum

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
our last layer for layered curriculum

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.420 
our last layer for layered curriculum
the<00:01:09.000> sea<00:01:09.299> layer<00:01:09.540> was<00:01:09.840> basic<00:01:10.409> Road<00:01:10.650> information

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
the sea layer was basic Road information

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.640 
the sea layer was basic Road information
the<00:01:11.970> B<00:01:12.210> layer<00:01:12.479> allowed<00:01:12.869> students<00:01:13.290> to<00:01:13.350> play

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
the B layer allowed students to play

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.530 
the B layer allowed students to play
around<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.100> concepts<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:14.729> little<00:01:14.970> bit<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.509> a

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
around the concepts a little bit the a

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.719 
around the concepts a little bit the a
layer<00:01:16.049> now<00:01:16.320> is<00:01:16.500> asking<00:01:16.860> kids<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.159> do<00:01:17.369> critical

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729

of<00:01:58.920> time<00:01:59.040> talking<00:01:59.430> about<00:01:59.729> was<00:02:00.270> fossil<00:02:00.810> fuels

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
of time talking about was fossil fuels

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.750 
of time talking about was fossil fuels
the<00:02:02.070> breakdown<00:02:02.670> of

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:04.760 
the breakdown of

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.749 
the breakdown of
prehistoric<00:02:05.760> ferns<00:02:06.590> those<00:02:07.590> fern<00:02:07.890> forests

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
prehistoric ferns those fern forests

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.609 
prehistoric ferns those fern forests
that<00:02:08.850> are<00:02:09.000> now<00:02:09.300> turned<00:02:09.720> into<00:02:09.810> carbon<00:02:10.350> which

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
that are now turned into carbon which

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.470 
that are now turned into carbon which
then<00:02:10.830> turned<00:02:11.100> into<00:02:11.190> our<00:02:11.430> oil<00:02:11.700> which<00:02:12.060> we<00:02:12.240> now

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
then turned into our oil which we now

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.300 
then turned into our oil which we now
are<00:02:12.690> harvesting<00:02:13.320> and<00:02:13.500> how<00:02:13.590> many<00:02:13.680> years<00:02:14.040> ago

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
are harvesting and how many years ago

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:15.980 
are harvesting and how many years ago
that<00:02:14.490> was<00:02:14.670> so<00:02:15.240> of<00:02:15.360> course<00:02:15.510> that's<00:02:15.690> a<00:02:15.810> very

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
that was so of course that's a very

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.520 
that was so of course that's a very
topical<00:02:16.640> issue<00:02:17.640> in<00:02:18.210> terms<00:02:18.270> of<00:02:18.810> fossil<00:02:19.260> fuels

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
topical issue in terms of fossil fuels

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.360 
topical issue in terms of fossil fuels
versus<00:02:20.040> renewable<00:02:20.900> sources<00:02:21.900> of<00:02:22.110> energy<00:02:22.590> so

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
versus renewable sources of energy so

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:24.770 
versus renewable sources of energy so
that<00:02:23.400> certainly<00:02:23.970> is<00:02:24.120> going<00:02:24.240> to<00:02:24.330> be<00:02:24.390> one<00:02:24.540> of<00:02:24.570> my

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
that certainly is going to be one of my

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.420 
that certainly is going to be one of my
a<00:02:24.960> layer<00:02:25.200> questions<00:02:25.800> is<00:02:25.980> talking<00:02:26.370> about

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
a layer questions is talking about

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.660 
a layer questions is talking about
fossil<00:02:27.090> fuels<00:02:27.680> versus<00:02:28.680> renewable<00:02:29.280> sources

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
fossil fuels versus renewable sources

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.460 
fossil fuels versus renewable sources
and<00:02:29.970> what<00:02:30.180> is<00:02:30.300> the<00:02:30.480> argument<00:02:30.630> against<00:02:31.320> it<00:02:31.410> and

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
and what is the argument against it and

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:32.960 
and what is the argument against it and
what's<00:02:31.680> wrong<00:02:31.890> with<00:02:32.040> taking<00:02:32.400> the<00:02:32.430> fossil

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
what's wrong with taking the fossil

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.700 
what's wrong with taking the fossil
fuels<00:02:33.240> and<00:02:33.450> edit<00:02:33.900> and<00:02:34.050> how<00:02:34.170> long<00:02:34.350> did<00:02:34.560> it<00:02:34.620> take

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
fuels and edit and how long did it take

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.040 
fuels and edit and how long did it take
to<00:02:34.920> make<00:02:35.220> these<00:02:35.400> fossil<00:02:35.940> fuels<00:02:36.150> and<00:02:36.330> the

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
to make these fossil fuels and the

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.160 
to make these fossil fuels and the
process<00:02:37.650> to<00:02:37.920> them<00:02:38.130> and<00:02:38.940> what<00:02:39.270> are<00:02:39.390> our<00:02:39.510> odds<00:02:39.750> of

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
process to them and what are our odds of

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.590 
process to them and what are our odds of
renewing<00:02:41.070> those<00:02:41.310> verses<00:02:42.030> what<00:02:42.209> types<00:02:42.450> of

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
renewing those verses what types of

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.210 
renewing those verses what types of
renewable<00:02:43.110> energy<00:02:43.470> so<00:02:43.680> we're<00:02:43.860> going<00:02:43.980> to<00:02:44.070> look

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
renewable energy so we're going to look

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.010 
renewable energy so we're going to look
at<00:02:44.340> that<00:02:44.490> as<00:02:44.640> an<00:02:44.760> earlier<00:02:45.060> question<00:02:45.240> one<00:02:45.900> of

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
at that as an earlier question one of

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
at that as an earlier question one of
the<00:02:46.140> other<00:02:46.290> a<00:02:46.560> layer<00:02:46.770> questions<00:02:47.280> that<00:02:47.490> I<00:02:47.520> had

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
the other a layer questions that I had

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.500 
the other a layer questions that I had
revolved<00:02:50.040> on<00:02:50.160> forest<00:02:50.550> fires<00:02:50.610> in<00:02:50.940> national

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
revolved on forest fires in national

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.360 
revolved on forest fires in national
forests<00:02:51.900> I<00:02:51.990> know<00:02:52.110> we<00:02:52.350> learned<00:02:52.560> a<00:02:52.709> lot<00:02:52.890> several

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
forests I know we learned a lot several

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.070 
forests I know we learned a lot several
years<00:02:53.580> ago<00:02:53.880> when<00:02:54.180> we<00:02:54.209> had<00:02:54.300> the<00:02:54.480> big<00:02:54.720> forest

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
years ago when we had the big forest

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.000 
years ago when we had the big forest
fire<00:02:55.320> in<00:02:55.350> Yellowstone<00:02:56.220> in<00:02:57.030> terms<00:02:57.420> of

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
fire in Yellowstone in terms of

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.800 
fire in Yellowstone in terms of
particularly<00:02:59.010> the<00:02:59.190> coniferous<00:02:59.880> forests<00:03:00.750> that

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
particularly the coniferous forests that

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.260 
particularly the coniferous forests that
could<00:03:01.290> receive<00:03:01.860> themselves<00:03:02.520> only<00:03:02.670> after<00:03:03.240> a

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
could receive themselves only after a

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.690 
could receive themselves only after a
forest<00:03:03.570> fire<00:03:03.870> so<00:03:04.800> we<00:03:04.980> can<00:03:05.130> look<00:03:05.310> at<00:03:05.459> some<00:03:05.670> of

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
forest fire so we can look at some of

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.970 
forest fire so we can look at some of
the<00:03:05.850> issues<00:03:06.000> around<00:03:06.390> that<00:03:06.900> and<00:03:07.230> what<00:03:07.470> kinds<00:03:07.890> of

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
the issues around that and what kinds of

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.400 
the issues around that and what kinds of
things<00:03:08.040> are<00:03:08.400> they<00:03:08.489> now<00:03:08.730> doing<00:03:09.090> in<00:03:09.450> for<00:03:10.110> us<00:03:10.260> to

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
things are they now doing in for us to

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.350 
things are they now doing in for us to
have<00:03:10.590> control<00:03:11.070> burns<00:03:11.430> should<00:03:12.209> we

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
have control burns should we

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.540 
have control burns should we
intentionally<00:03:12.780> burn<00:03:13.320> forests<00:03:13.980> once<00:03:14.310> in<00:03:14.489> a

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
intentionally burn forests once in a

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.250 
intentionally burn forests once in a
while<00:03:14.760> in<00:03:15.090> order<00:03:15.330> to<00:03:15.450> keep<00:03:15.600> them<00:03:15.840> up<00:03:15.989> should<00:03:16.230> we

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
while in order to keep them up should we

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.990 
while in order to keep them up should we
wait<00:03:16.470> for<00:03:16.500> them<00:03:16.800> to<00:03:16.830> naturally<00:03:17.489> burn<00:03:17.670> on<00:03:17.820> their

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
wait for them to naturally burn on their

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.820 
wait for them to naturally burn on their
own<00:03:18.150> what<00:03:18.690> types<00:03:18.930> of<00:03:19.080> lessons<00:03:19.350> have<00:03:19.709> we

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
own what types of lessons have we

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.220 
own what types of lessons have we
learned<00:03:20.070> in<00:03:20.250> terms<00:03:20.519> of<00:03:20.750> forest<00:03:21.750> management

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
learned in terms of forest management

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.160 
learned in terms of forest management
and<00:03:22.650> fires<00:03:23.280> the<00:03:24.030> third<00:03:24.330> question<00:03:24.660> that<00:03:25.019> I<00:03:25.050> came

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
and fires the third question that I came

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.680 
and fires the third question that I came
up<00:03:25.380> with<00:03:25.590> had<00:03:26.340> to<00:03:26.580> do<00:03:26.790> with<00:03:26.970> the<00:03:27.330> flower

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
up with had to do with the flower

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.770 
up with had to do with the flower
industry<00:03:28.760> one<00:03:29.760> of<00:03:29.880> the<00:03:30.000> things<00:03:30.239> that<00:03:30.360> I<00:03:30.480> saw<00:03:30.750> on

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
industry one of the things that I saw on

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.650 
industry one of the things that I saw on
the<00:03:31.050> news<00:03:31.080> recently<00:03:31.620> was<00:03:32.220> talking<00:03:32.730> about<00:03:33.030> most

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
the news recently was talking about most

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.780 
the news recently was talking about most
of<00:03:34.019> the<00:03:34.200> flowers<00:03:34.799> that<00:03:34.830> we<00:03:35.220> have<00:03:35.549> in<00:03:35.700> our

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
of the flowers that we have in our

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.729 
of the flowers that we have in our
flower<00:03:36.090> shops<00:03:36.510> here<00:03:36.780> the<00:03:36.930> United<00:03:37.290> States<00:03:37.500> are

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
flower shops here the United States are

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:40.550 
flower shops here the United States are
actually<00:03:38.370> imported<00:03:39.140> from<00:03:40.140> out<00:03:40.320> of<00:03:40.350> the

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
actually imported from out of the

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.470 
actually imported from out of the
country<00:03:40.590> so<00:03:41.549> we're<00:03:41.760> going<00:03:41.940> to<00:03:42.090> look<00:03:42.239> at<00:03:42.360> the

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
country so we're going to look at the

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.930 
country so we're going to look at the
carbon<00:03:42.900> footprint<00:03:43.440> that<00:03:43.680> that<00:03:43.890> entails<00:03:44.070> so

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
carbon footprint that that entails so

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.350 
carbon footprint that that entails so
when<00:03:45.269> you<00:03:45.450> get<00:03:45.720> those<00:03:46.370> pretty<00:03:47.370> orchids<00:03:48.060> or

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
when you get those pretty orchids or

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.930 
when you get those pretty orchids or
those<00:03:48.600> nice<00:03:48.870> roses<00:03:49.290> or<00:03:49.980> that<00:03:50.190> that<00:03:50.670> bouquet

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
those nice roses or that that bouquet

is that a significant issue for us or

paper industry particularly here in the

Northeast we are losing our
per<00:04:15.480> industry<00:04:16.040> because<00:04:17.040> of<00:04:17.190> economic<00:04:17.489> reasons

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:18.330 
per industry because of economic reasons

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:20.479 
per industry because of economic reasons
and<00:04:18.570> what<00:04:19.049> type<00:04:19.260> of<00:04:19.290> effect<00:04:19.830> is<00:04:20.040> that<00:04:20.070> having

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
and what type of effect is that having

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:24.080 
and what type of effect is that having
them<00:04:20.850> for<00:04:21.330> Sandra<00:04:21.870> planting<00:04:22.410> of<00:04:22.530> trees<00:04:22.760> I<00:04:23.760> know

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
them for Sandra planting of trees I know

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.390 
them for Sandra planting of trees I know
at<00:04:24.480> first<00:04:24.690> glance<00:04:25.050> you<00:04:25.350> might<00:04:25.500> think<00:04:25.560> well<00:04:26.040> if

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
at first glance you might think well if

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.610 
at first glance you might think well if
we're<00:04:26.790> not<00:04:26.970> harvesting<00:04:27.660> them<00:04:27.810> for<00:04:28.020> paper<00:04:28.260> that

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
we're not harvesting them for paper that

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.050 
we're not harvesting them for paper that
will<00:04:28.710> have<00:04:28.890> more<00:04:29.130> trees<00:04:29.490> but<00:04:29.730> in<00:04:29.850> reality

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
will have more trees but in reality

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.450 
will have more trees but in reality
there's<00:04:30.990> a<00:04:31.080> lot<00:04:31.290> of<00:04:31.320> research<00:04:31.740> out<00:04:31.920> showing<00:04:32.220> we

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
there's a lot of research out showing we

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.130 
there's a lot of research out showing we
end<00:04:32.640> up<00:04:32.700> with<00:04:32.730> less<00:04:33.030> trees<00:04:33.360> because<00:04:33.780> the<00:04:33.900> paper

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:34.140 
end up with less trees because the paper

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.680 
end up with less trees because the paper
industry<00:04:34.650> has<00:04:34.830> to<00:04:34.980> replant<00:04:35.460> as<00:04:35.730> they<00:04:36.210> harvest

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
industry has to replant as they harvest

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.660 
industry has to replant as they harvest
those<00:04:36.870> so<00:04:37.350> we're<00:04:37.560> going<00:04:37.740> to<00:04:37.920> look<00:04:38.100> at<00:04:38.250> the<00:04:38.400> pros

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:38.670 
those so we're going to look at the pros

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:40.760 
those so we're going to look at the pros
and<00:04:38.700> cons<00:04:39.150> of<00:04:39.600> the<00:04:39.750> demise<00:04:40.080> of<00:04:40.320> the<00:04:40.380> paper

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
and cons of the demise of the paper

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:42.770 
and cons of the demise of the paper
industry<00:04:41.400> particularly<00:04:42.180> here<00:04:42.660> in<00:04:42.690> the

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
industry particularly here in the

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.960 
industry particularly here in the
Northeast<00:04:43.230> so<00:04:43.680> there<00:04:43.890> I've<00:04:44.040> got<00:04:44.130> for<00:04:44.550> a<00:04:44.580> layer

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 
Northeast so there I've got for a layer

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:46.640 
Northeast so there I've got for a layer
questions<00:04:45.480> that<00:04:45.600> I<00:04:45.720> can<00:04:45.870> offer<00:04:46.020> the<00:04:46.290> students

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
questions that I can offer the students

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.020 
questions that I can offer the students
they're<00:04:46.830> going<00:04:46.980> to<00:04:47.070> choose<00:04:47.280> one<00:04:47.520> of<00:04:47.550> those<00:04:47.820> are
