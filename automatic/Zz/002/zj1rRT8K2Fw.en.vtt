actually Qualcomm Snapdragon s4

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.850 
actually Qualcomm Snapdragon s4
processor<00:01:05.700> so<00:01:06.090> is<00:01:06.300> not<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:07.229> nvidia<00:01:07.619> tegra

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
processor so is not the nvidia tegra

reach<00:01:08.310> if<00:01:08.610> that's<00:01:09.090> quad<00:01:09.330> core<00:01:09.600> but<00:01:09.720> that's

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
reach if that's quad core but that's

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.800 
reach if that's quad core but that's
because<00:01:10.050> it<00:01:10.740> needs<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:11.190> support<00:01:11.690> super<00:01:12.690> nice

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
because it needs to support super nice

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.770 
because it needs to support super nice
