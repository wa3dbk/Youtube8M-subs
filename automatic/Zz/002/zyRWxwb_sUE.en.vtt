00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:31.929
 not all because I want to be an artist that happens frame my parents say that I 

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:35.309
 I would die of hunger they do not believe in me my uncles also mocked me when 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.660
 I said I wanted to be a painter 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.660
 but my dad supported me 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.010
 lucky 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.030
 without the arts human beings would be less human 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.930
 of people who do not value art as a job do not know that the authors deserve 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:53.920
 respect 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:59.420
 the authors have the right to live from their work zÃ¡rate to die makes alvear tracks 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.570
 fracc 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.989
 I just wanted to make me respect 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.600
 goals 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.240
 all and all that not yet 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.840
 like the chule 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.350
 chebeya surprise to see you here 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.350
 an artist living from his art 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.350
 thanks to copyright 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:19.790
 what is that 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.830
 imagine that it was down the street from a car that you like 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.850
 you can use it so much john 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.970
 - If I were the clear owner 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:29.680
 or if the owner gives me permission 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.330
 this act because things have a true owner 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.780
 is composed is a song or you write a book wants this work 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.430
 the author 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:44.610
 the author is the owner of his work because the admired for this has worked 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.240
 Invested time effort talent 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.640
 and sometimes even your money like that is 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.640
 and no one can take a property without the owner's permission 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.260
 this elevates the author can dispose of his work 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.490
 You can sell it or rent it 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.860
 authorizes its reproduction cedella et cetera 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.400
 yes that I do a work could have gains for it as if it were a 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.990
 automobile a house 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.720
 the difference is that a car to a house are assets that you can touch for that reason 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.779
 they are physical goods 

00:02:14.779 --> 00:02:20.359
 instead a song a poem does not see the dance et cetera are creations 

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:24.309
 intellectuals can not touch the intellectual creations are real 

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:28.459
 intellectuals all goods whether physical or intellectual have a 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:31.839
 owner and that is respected and you as you know so much 

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:34.729
 I went to the copyright office and 

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:37.729
 neither has this project 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.599
 the name of the winner 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:43.229
 we already saw the main thing 

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:45.589
 1 the value of creativity 

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:48.299
 if creativity would not move the world 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:52.959
 2 the importance of understanding that the author is the owner of his work 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:57.370
 3 when creating the work the author has rights that must be protected and 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.819
 recognize 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:02.029
 anyone can be an author 

00:03:02.029 --> 00:03:05.359
 the human being is the only one capable of producing intellectual works 

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:08.999
 that is, animals can not be authors 

00:03:08.999 --> 00:03:12.989
 and there are other ways of authoring machines and institutions 

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:17.359
 the goal is also recognized 

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:20.529
 when two or more people come together to create a work 

00:03:20.529 --> 00:03:25.120
 the authorship of works under a pseudonym name that replaces own as well as 

00:03:25.119 --> 00:03:28.959
 the works without signature or anonymous and the authorship of the works is recognized 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.769
 created for an employer 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:34.499
 what kind of activities comprise copyright 

00:03:34.499 --> 00:03:38.229
 copyright protects creations in the form of literary works 

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:42.319
 and artistic whatever its merit gender purpose 

00:03:44.589 --> 00:03:46.060
 if you buy a CD 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.649
 to which I have the right 

00:03:47.649 --> 00:03:49.329
 listening to it 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:51.179
 but if I have a business 

00:03:51.179 --> 00:03:54.389
 I can put that song to attract more customers 

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:57.319
 can and is that these seem distasteful 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:00.799
 remember that buying the CD only had the right to listen to it 

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:02.980
 the works are properties 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.170
 can be left as inheritance the right 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.859
 the author about his work lasts all his life 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:13.449
 and about 50 years after his death in many countries it reaches up to 70 years and 

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:17.900
 after that time the work can be used by everyone, that is, anyone can 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.229
 can play 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:20.989
 and if another says that his work 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:22.140
 it would not be legal 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:25.900
 the moral rights of the author paternity and integrity of the work are 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.249
 will respect percent 

00:04:28.249 --> 00:04:32.109
 the pirates do not respect the author they produce and sell the work without paying 

00:04:32.109 --> 00:04:35.330
 no right 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.789
 the plagiaries do not respect the author, they copy it with shameless disguise and say 

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:42.789
 that they are the authors 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.150
 that is a robbery the pirate and the scourge are criminals 

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:51.909
 that is why the law punishes the pirate and ecclesial 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.689
 the art history teacher 

00:04:55.689 --> 00:04:58.689
 bush in his flesh the works of various authors 

00:04:59.499 --> 00:05:03.909
 there are no problems and you did not like to teach, not to win from milan. 

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:07.650
 can reproduce the dwellings increased from a work to clarify an idea 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.919
 in the third round to the source authority the right to decide tel 

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:14.580
 not talking about corner 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.089
 I would accept areas with me 

00:05:17.089 --> 00:05:20.770
 p the demand in this sector an appointment with the pope demarcated 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:22.159
 and what to talk about 

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:25.330
 they invited me so they are in copyright 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.210
 when the one that the artists and we have future 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:31.439
 present and future 

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:32.600
 I think I'm going to do 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:33.909
 the author 

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:35.589
 fernandez de la vega 

00:05:35.589 --> 00:05:36.679
