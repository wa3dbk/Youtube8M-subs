00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.160 
capped and then we'll go to the next
step<00:02:01.210> all<00:02:02.210> right<00:02:02.360> so<00:02:02.630> once<00:02:02.810> we<00:02:02.930> have<00:02:03.050> it

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
in this later but this is the part that

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.449 
in this later but this is the part that
takes<00:02:17.840> some<00:02:18.020> time<00:02:18.230> and<00:02:18.590> you<00:02:19.040> do<00:02:19.190> end<00:02:19.340> up

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
takes some time and you do end up

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:22.920 
takes some time and you do end up
wasting<00:02:19.700> a<00:02:20.000> lot<00:02:20.120> of<00:02:20.180> water<00:02:20.450> to<00:02:20.840> get<00:02:21.020> water<00:02:21.230> but
