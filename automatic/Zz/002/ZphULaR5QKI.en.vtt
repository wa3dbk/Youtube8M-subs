also it's about entertainment for
everyone<00:02:25.190> and<00:02:25.940> they<00:02:26.090> get<00:02:26.300> to<00:02:26.420> have<00:02:26.450> just<00:02:26.780> a<00:02:26.810> bit

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
everyone and they get to have just a bit

everyone and they get to have just a bit
of<00:02:26.990> fun<00:02:27.200> with<00:02:27.230> it<00:02:27.410> still<00:02:27.680> think<00:02:27.830> it's<00:02:27.920> still

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
of fun with it still think it's still

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.720 
of fun with it still think it's still
after<00:02:30.200> watching<00:02:30.350> that<00:02:30.650> I<00:02:30.770> think<00:02:31.160> it's<00:02:31.430> in

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
after watching that I think it's in

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.640 
after watching that I think it's in
massive<00:02:32.150> aspects<00:02:32.630> of<00:02:32.959> wrestling<00:02:33.410> that<00:02:33.440> are

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
massive aspects of wrestling that are

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.260 
massive aspects of wrestling that are
very<00:02:33.830> problematic<00:02:34.130> and<00:02:34.760> something<00:02:35.120> that<00:02:35.209> I

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
very problematic and something that I

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:36.400 
very problematic and something that I
probably<00:02:35.510> wouldn't<00:02:35.750> want<00:02:35.810> to<00:02:35.959> expose<00:02:36.170> my<00:02:36.230> own

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
probably wouldn't want to expose my own

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.580 
probably wouldn't want to expose my own
children<00:02:37.130> or<00:02:37.400> even<00:02:38.000> myself<00:02:38.270> -<00:02:38.810> whatever<00:02:39.380> works

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
children or even myself - whatever works

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.320 
children or even myself - whatever works
here<00:02:39.950> you<00:02:40.040> just<00:02:40.190> don't<00:02:40.430> go<00:02:40.640> around<00:02:40.760> doing<00:02:41.090> them

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
here you just don't go around doing them

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.690 
here you just don't go around doing them
in<00:02:41.480> real<00:02:41.600> life
