00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:04.679 

good<00:00:02.949> afternoon<00:00:03.250> today<00:00:04.089> I<00:00:04.270> will<00:00:04.480> demonstrate

00:00:04.679 --> 00:00:04.689 
good afternoon today I will demonstrate

00:00:04.689 --> 00:00:10.760 
good afternoon today I will demonstrate
how<00:00:05.140> to<00:00:07.230> bore<00:00:08.230> out<00:00:08.790> the<00:00:09.790> hole<00:00:10.030> with<00:00:10.300> a<00:00:10.330> glance

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:10.770 
how to bore out the hole with a glance

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:15.210 
how to bore out the hole with a glance
boring<00:00:11.770> bar<00:00:12.510> with<00:00:13.510> rotating<00:00:14.320> insert<00:00:14.800> you<00:00:15.160> can

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:15.220 
boring bar with rotating insert you can

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:20.089 
boring bar with rotating insert you can
see<00:00:15.580> it<00:00:15.670> here<00:00:16.080> so<00:00:17.080> this<00:00:17.289> is<00:00:17.499> a<00:00:17.529> brass<00:00:17.859> stock<00:00:18.220> of

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:20.099 
see it here so this is a brass stock of

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:22.919 
see it here so this is a brass stock of
55<00:00:21.099> millimeter<00:00:21.609> diameter<00:00:21.939> which<00:00:22.539> are<00:00:22.720> born

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:22.929 
55 millimeter diameter which are born

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:32.479 
55 millimeter diameter which are born
into<00:00:24.060> 34<00:00:26.759> let<00:00:27.759> me<00:00:27.970> dial<00:00:28.239> out<00:00:28.539> a<00:00:30.060> millimeter<00:00:31.060> per

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
into 34 let me dial out a millimeter per

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:38.520 
into 34 let me dial out a millimeter per
side<00:00:33.489> which<00:00:34.210> amounts<00:00:34.690> to<00:00:36.480> 2<00:00:37.480> millimeters<00:00:38.020> in

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:38.530 
side which amounts to 2 millimeters in

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.290 
side which amounts to 2 millimeters in
diameter<00:00:39.030> so<00:00:40.030> return<00:00:40.420> or<00:00:40.660> delay<00:00:41.820> we<00:00:42.820> will<00:00:43.030> run

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:43.300 
diameter so return or delay we will run

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.400 
diameter so return or delay we will run
it<00:00:43.449> at<00:00:43.600> about

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
it at about

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.770 
it at about
for<00:00:45.710> 500<00:00:46.340> rpms

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.840 

now<00:00:49.989> we<00:00:50.170> can<00:00:50.410> advance<00:00:50.770> this<00:00:51.250> video<00:00:51.640> can

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:51.850 
now we can advance this video can

00:00:51.850 --> 00:01:53.240 
now we can advance this video can
advance<00:00:52.449> it<00:00:52.780> rather<00:00:53.289> portly<00:00:53.620> thing

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.130 

so<00:01:54.250> we<00:01:54.370> can<00:01:54.580> go<00:01:54.730> out<00:01:54.940> on<00:01:54.970> the<00:01:55.360> reverse<00:01:55.660> movement

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
so we can go out on the reverse movement

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.350 
so we can go out on the reverse movement
as<00:01:56.290> well<00:01:56.500> I'll<00:01:56.890> dial<00:01:57.280> a<00:01:57.430> bit<00:01:57.580> less<00:01:57.850> of<00:01:58.300> a

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
as well I'll dial a bit less of a

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.620 
as well I'll dial a bit less of a
millimeter

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:17.280 

just<00:02:03.460> the<00:02:04.460> steady<00:02:04.729> motion

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:28.649 

here<00:02:18.290> we<00:02:18.440> go<00:02:25.030> now<00:02:26.030> you<00:02:26.060> can<00:02:26.420> see<00:02:26.569> this

00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:28.659 
here we go now you can see this

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:34.030 
here we go now you can see this
resulting<00:02:29.659> hole<00:02:32.140> it's<00:02:33.140> a<00:02:33.349> nice<00:02:33.620> smooth

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
resulting hole it's a nice smooth

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.589 
resulting hole it's a nice smooth
surface<00:02:34.069> for<00:02:34.579> such<00:02:35.390> a<00:02:36.069> deep<00:02:37.069> rough<00:02:37.940> take<00:02:38.269> on

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:38.599 
surface for such a deep rough take on

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:43.920 
surface for such a deep rough take on
this<00:02:38.780> machine<00:02:38.959> so<00:02:39.640> this<00:02:40.640> is<00:02:40.819> just<00:02:41.530> an<00:02:42.530> ordinary

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
this machine so this is just an ordinary

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.160 
this machine so this is just an ordinary
7<00:02:44.930> by<00:02:45.110> 12<00:02:45.549> Chinese<00:02:46.549> mini<00:02:46.970> lathe<00:02:47.209> without<00:02:47.959> any

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
7 by 12 Chinese mini lathe without any

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.849 
7 by 12 Chinese mini lathe without any
modifications<00:02:48.950> and<00:02:49.250> this<00:02:49.700> is<00:02:50.500> the<00:02:51.500> boring

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:51.859 
modifications and this is the boring

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:57.310 
modifications and this is the boring
boring<00:02:52.160> question<00:02:52.549> I<00:02:53.650> think<00:02:54.650> it<00:02:54.799> does<00:02:54.980> a<00:02:55.010> job
