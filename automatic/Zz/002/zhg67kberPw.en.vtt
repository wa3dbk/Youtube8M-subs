torch key designs now if you don't know

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.030 
torch key designs now if you don't know
what<00:00:12.360> one<00:00:12.480> of<00:00:12.509> these<00:00:12.750> is<00:00:12.960> the<00:00:13.320> clue<00:00:13.559> is<00:00:13.799> in<00:00:13.830> the

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
what one of these is the clue is in the

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.310 
what one of these is the clue is in the
name<00:00:14.160> it<00:00:14.849> allows<00:00:15.120> you<00:00:15.360> to<00:00:15.480> use<00:00:15.690> a<00:00:15.900> redstone

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
name it allows you to use a redstone

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.560 
name it allows you to use a redstone
torch<00:00:16.470> or<00:00:16.980> a<00:00:17.039> piece<00:00:17.520> of<00:00:17.550> redstone<00:00:17.880> dust<00:00:18.300> to

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
torch or a piece of redstone dust to

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.840 
torch or a piece of redstone dust to
activate<00:00:19.109> some<00:00:19.410> form<00:00:19.800> of<00:00:20.010> redstone<00:00:20.369> device

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
activate some form of redstone device

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.910 
activate some form of redstone device
now<00:00:21.480> generally<00:00:21.990> speaking<00:00:22.020> this<00:00:22.560> is<00:00:22.710> for

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
now generally speaking this is for

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.490 
now generally speaking this is for
things<00:00:23.100> like<00:00:23.220> hidden<00:00:23.850> entrances<00:00:24.750> or<00:00:24.779> secret

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
things like hidden entrances or secret

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.140 
things like hidden entrances or secret
storage<00:00:25.859> but<00:00:26.310> you<00:00:26.460> can<00:00:26.670> use<00:00:26.880> them<00:00:27.119> for

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
storage but you can use them for

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.019 
storage but you can use them for
whatever<00:00:27.510> you<00:00:27.810> like<00:00:27.990> it's<00:00:28.289> all<00:00:28.439> up<00:00:28.590> to<00:00:28.619> you<00:00:29.029> so

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
whatever you like it's all up to you so

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.150 
whatever you like it's all up to you so
on<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.449> screen<00:00:30.570> now<00:00:30.900> should<00:00:31.199> be<00:00:31.230> a<00:00:31.349> handful<00:00:31.980> of

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
on the screen now should be a handful of

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.889 
on the screen now should be a handful of
different<00:00:32.399> designs<00:00:32.969> that<00:00:33.149> you<00:00:33.450> can<00:00:33.480> use

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
different designs that you can use

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.780 
different designs that you can use
hopefully<00:00:34.739> one<00:00:34.920> of<00:00:34.950> them<00:00:35.160> tickles<00:00:35.579> your<00:00:35.700> fancy

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
hopefully one of them tickles your fancy

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.090 
hopefully one of them tickles your fancy
if<00:00:36.390> not<00:00:36.780> then<00:00:36.989> just<00:00:37.020> watch<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.559> video<00:00:37.800> all<00:00:38.070> the

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
if not then just watch the video all the

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.250 
if not then just watch the video all the
way<00:00:38.219> through<00:00:38.340> because<00:00:39.300> let's<00:00:39.660> face<00:00:39.719> it<00:00:39.870> you

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
way through because let's face it you

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.290 
way through because let's face it you
don't<00:00:40.469> have<00:00:40.590> anything<00:00:40.860> better<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.160> do

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:43.300 
don't have anything better to do

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.540 
don't have anything better to do
so<00:00:44.300> here<00:00:44.630> is<00:00:44.840> our<00:00:45.110> first<00:00:45.380> design<00:00:45.830> this<00:00:46.100> one<00:00:46.340> is

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
so here is our first design this one is

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.000 
so here is our first design this one is
about<00:00:46.670> as<00:00:46.970> easy<00:00:47.390> as<00:00:47.660> it<00:00:47.870> gets<00:00:47.900> it<00:00:48.560> uses

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
about as easy as it gets it uses

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.650 
about as easy as it gets it uses
redstone<00:00:49.460> dust<00:00:49.640> getting<00:00:49.910> powered<00:00:50.300> to<00:00:50.420> fire

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:50.660 
redstone dust getting powered to fire

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.180 
redstone dust getting powered to fire
off<00:00:50.810> a<00:00:50.900> signal<00:00:51.110> so<00:00:51.620> you<00:00:51.710> can<00:00:51.860> see<00:00:52.010> when<00:00:52.160> we

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
off a signal so you can see when we

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.370 
off a signal so you can see when we
place<00:00:52.430> our<00:00:52.610> redstone<00:00:52.820> dust<00:00:53.270> it<00:00:53.540> gives<00:00:53.960> a<00:00:54.110> one

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:54.380 
place our redstone dust it gives a one

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.200 
place our redstone dust it gives a one
tick<00:00:54.620> pulse<00:00:54.890> and<00:00:55.100> then<00:00:55.490> it<00:00:55.610> gets<00:00:55.790> destroyed

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
tick pulse and then it gets destroyed

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:57.910 
tick pulse and then it gets destroyed
now<00:00:56.450> that<00:00:56.630> is<00:00:56.750> really<00:00:57.140> useful<00:00:57.320> because<00:00:57.710> that

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
now that is really useful because that

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.530 
now that is really useful because that
means<00:00:58.130> we<00:00:58.250> can<00:00:58.400> use<00:00:58.430> this<00:00:58.700> in<00:00:58.910> a<00:00:59.000> T<00:00:59.239> flip-flop

00:00:59.530 --> 00:00:59.540 
means we can use this in a T flip-flop

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.990 
means we can use this in a T flip-flop
by<00:01:00.260> placing<00:01:00.710> some<00:01:00.950> redstone<00:01:01.190> dust<00:01:01.550> there<00:01:01.850> a

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
by placing some redstone dust there a

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.030 
by placing some redstone dust there a
sticky<00:01:02.630> piston<00:01:02.840> facing<00:01:03.230> in<00:01:03.560> this<00:01:03.770> direction

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
sticky piston facing in this direction

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.040 
sticky piston facing in this direction
with<00:01:04.430> a<00:01:04.520> block<00:01:04.790> like<00:01:05.000> that<00:01:05.030> and<00:01:05.420> then<00:01:05.840> a

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:06.050 
with a block like that and then a

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.560 
with a block like that and then a
redstone<00:01:06.470> torch<00:01:06.620> down<00:01:07.130> there<00:01:07.430> with<00:01:07.940> I'd<00:01:08.300> know

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
redstone torch down there with I'd know

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.750 
redstone torch down there with I'd know
a<00:01:08.600> lamp<00:01:08.990> on<00:01:09.170> top<00:01:09.200> so<00:01:09.590> that<00:01:09.710> we<00:01:09.800> can<00:01:09.979> showcase<00:01:10.280> it

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:10.760 
a lamp on top so that we can showcase it

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.219 
a lamp on top so that we can showcase it
and<00:01:11.090> when<00:01:11.210> we<00:01:11.300> place<00:01:11.510> our<00:01:11.660> redstone<00:01:11.870> dust

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
and when we place our redstone dust

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:14.260 
and when we place our redstone dust
you'll<00:01:12.500> see<00:01:12.620> that<00:01:12.740> lamp<00:01:13.040> turns<00:01:13.310> off<00:01:13.580> when<00:01:14.180> we

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
you'll see that lamp turns off when we

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.690 
you'll see that lamp turns off when we
place<00:01:14.510> it<00:01:14.660> again<00:01:14.930> it<00:01:15.170> turns<00:01:15.590> back<00:01:15.800> on<00:01:16.010> but

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
place it again it turns back on but

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.100 
place it again it turns back on but
we're<00:01:17.000> not<00:01:17.119> here<00:01:17.300> to<00:01:17.450> see<00:01:17.570> the<00:01:17.690> T<00:01:17.840> flip-flop

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
we're not here to see the T flip-flop

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.980 
we're not here to see the T flip-flop
this<00:01:18.619> is<00:01:18.890> how<00:01:19.130> you<00:01:19.190> build<00:01:19.640> the<00:01:20.030> actual<00:01:20.510> torch

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
this is how you build the actual torch

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:22.780 
this is how you build the actual torch
key<00:01:21.259> itself<00:01:21.680> I'll<00:01:21.920> get<00:01:22.070> all<00:01:22.220> that<00:01:22.340> rubbish<00:01:22.670> out

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
key itself I'll get all that rubbish out

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:24.700 
key itself I'll get all that rubbish out
of<00:01:22.880> the<00:01:22.940> way<00:01:23.090> so<00:01:23.630> if<00:01:23.869> you<00:01:23.960> do<00:01:24.110> want<00:01:24.290> to<00:01:24.320> build<00:01:24.560> it

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
of the way so if you do want to build it

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.290 
of the way so if you do want to build it
then<00:01:25.100> there<00:01:25.400> it<00:01:25.520> is<00:01:25.670> you<00:01:25.910> don't<00:01:26.060> need<00:01:26.240> a

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:26.300 
then there it is you don't need a

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.760 
then there it is you don't need a
tutorial<00:01:26.630> for<00:01:26.900> that<00:01:26.960> one<00:01:27.200> because<00:01:27.500> there<00:01:27.650> is

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
tutorial for that one because there is

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.830 
tutorial for that one because there is
no<00:01:27.979> redstone<00:01:28.550> hidden<00:01:28.910> I<00:01:29.060> just<00:01:29.479> want<00:01:29.630> to<00:01:29.690> say

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
no redstone hidden I just want to say

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.670 
no redstone hidden I just want to say
that<00:01:30.050> that<00:01:30.200> lever<00:01:30.470> is<00:01:30.740> of<00:01:31.100> course<00:01:31.369> powered<00:01:31.820> on

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:32.680 
that that lever is of course powered on

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.380 
that that lever is of course powered on
now<00:01:33.680> this<00:01:33.950> one<00:01:34.190> here<00:01:34.430> is<00:01:34.610> our<00:01:34.790> second<00:01:35.270> design

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
now this one here is our second design

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.390 
now this one here is our second design
and<00:01:35.930> I'm<00:01:36.020> sure<00:01:36.259> a<00:01:36.290> lot<00:01:36.560> of<00:01:36.590> you're<00:01:36.950> thinking

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.400 
and I'm sure a lot of you're thinking

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.670 
and I'm sure a lot of you're thinking
that<00:01:38.210> looks<00:01:38.479> pretty<00:01:38.720> similar<00:01:39.050> to<00:01:39.229> the<00:01:39.410> first

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 
that looks pretty similar to the first

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.740 
that looks pretty similar to the first
but<00:01:39.920> the<00:01:40.009> difference<00:01:40.430> is<00:01:40.640> this<00:01:41.119> one<00:01:41.360> uses

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
but the difference is this one uses

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.350 
but the difference is this one uses
redstone<00:01:42.320> torches<00:01:42.740> so<00:01:43.040> you<00:01:43.160> can<00:01:43.340> see<00:01:43.640> that<00:01:44.180> we

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
redstone torches so you can see that we

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.870 
redstone torches so you can see that we
also<00:01:44.630> get<00:01:44.990> an<00:01:45.110> output<00:01:45.350> down<00:01:45.860> through<00:01:46.160> here<00:01:46.400> now

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
also get an output down through here now

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.219 
also get an output down through here now
one<00:01:47.030> thing<00:01:47.179> I<00:01:47.300> didn't<00:01:47.660> mention<00:01:47.690> in<00:01:48.110> the<00:01:48.200> first

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
one thing I didn't mention in the first

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:49.960 
one thing I didn't mention in the first
design<00:01:48.619> is<00:01:49.009> that<00:01:49.160> this<00:01:49.280> is<00:01:49.429> the<00:01:49.550> floor<00:01:49.789> and

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
design is that this is the floor and

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:51.790 
design is that this is the floor and
this<00:01:50.360> is<00:01:50.509> the<00:01:50.630> wall<00:01:50.810> unfortunately<00:01:51.530> none<00:01:51.770> of

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:51.800 
this is the wall unfortunately none of

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.620 
this is the wall unfortunately none of
these<00:01:52.009> are<00:01:52.310> flush<00:01:52.580> with<00:01:52.789> the<00:01:52.880> floor<00:01:53.000> unless

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
these are flush with the floor unless

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.240 
these are flush with the floor unless
you<00:01:53.810> don't<00:01:53.990> mind<00:01:54.200> having<00:01:54.410> a<00:01:54.560> piston<00:01:54.950> showing

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
you don't mind having a piston showing

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.370 
you don't mind having a piston showing
but<00:01:55.460> sometimes<00:01:55.940> they<00:01:56.420> can<00:01:56.450> give<00:01:56.960> you<00:01:57.080> away<00:01:57.350> a

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
but sometimes they can give you away a

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.680 
but sometimes they can give you away a
little<00:01:57.619> bit<00:01:57.740> so<00:01:58.069> once<00:01:58.280> again<00:01:58.399> this<00:01:59.030> one<00:01:59.360> is

00:01:59.680 --> 00:01:59.690 
little bit so once again this one is

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.870 
little bit so once again this one is
just<00:02:00.170> one<00:02:00.289> wide<00:02:00.649> there's<00:02:00.950> no<00:02:01.160> redstone<00:02:01.670> head

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
just one wide there's no redstone head

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.700 
just one wide there's no redstone head
and<00:02:02.030> whatsoever<00:02:02.390> so<00:02:03.080> if<00:02:03.170> you<00:02:03.289> do<00:02:03.440> want<00:02:03.649> to

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
and whatsoever so if you do want to

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.070 
and whatsoever so if you do want to
build<00:02:03.860> it<00:02:04.100> here<00:02:04.610> is<00:02:04.819> the<00:02:05.060> side<00:02:05.330> profile<00:02:05.899> you

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
build it here is the side profile you

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.749 
build it here is the side profile you
can<00:02:06.229> take<00:02:06.440> your<00:02:06.619> screenshots<00:02:07.250> or<00:02:07.460> get<00:02:07.729> a

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
can take your screenshots or get a

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:09.520 
can take your screenshots or get a
really<00:02:08.060> good<00:02:08.179> look<00:02:08.390> so<00:02:08.929> you<00:02:09.020> know<00:02:09.140> exactly

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
really good look so you know exactly

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.460 
really good look so you know exactly
what<00:02:09.770> you're<00:02:09.920> doing<00:02:10.569> now<00:02:11.569> unfortunately<00:02:11.959> this

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
what you're doing now unfortunately this

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.949 
what you're doing now unfortunately this
one<00:02:12.740> is<00:02:12.950> nowhere<00:02:13.370> near<00:02:13.430> is<00:02:13.880> easy<00:02:14.240> to<00:02:14.540> turn<00:02:14.780> into

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
one is nowhere near is easy to turn into

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.440 
one is nowhere near is easy to turn into
a<00:02:15.080> t<00:02:15.319> flip-flop<00:02:15.860> however<00:02:16.459> it<00:02:16.700> can<00:02:17.000> be<00:02:17.180> done<00:02:17.390> you

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
a t flip-flop however it can be done you

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.390 
a t flip-flop however it can be done you
just<00:02:17.780> place<00:02:17.990> a<00:02:18.170> block<00:02:18.590> down<00:02:18.830> like<00:02:19.069> this

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
just place a block down like this

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.970 
just place a block down like this
redstone<00:02:20.090> dust<00:02:20.270> there<00:02:20.569> sticky<00:02:21.260> piston<00:02:21.650> facing

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
redstone dust there sticky piston facing

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.190 
redstone dust there sticky piston facing
upwards<00:02:22.400> with<00:02:22.520> a<00:02:22.580> block<00:02:22.910> on<00:02:23.120> top<00:02:23.450> and<00:02:23.630> then

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
upwards with a block on top and then

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.890 
upwards with a block on top and then
your<00:02:24.470> repeater<00:02:24.950> out<00:02:25.430> like<00:02:25.819> that<00:02:26.060> and<00:02:26.300> then<00:02:26.390> you

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
your repeater out like that and then you

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.600 
your repeater out like that and then you
can<00:02:27.080> place<00:02:27.290> your<00:02:27.500> sticky<00:02:27.740> piston<00:02:28.100> wherever

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
can place your sticky piston wherever

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.100 
can place your sticky piston wherever
really<00:02:29.060> I'm<00:02:29.420> going<00:02:29.569> to<00:02:29.630> place<00:02:29.780> it<00:02:29.930> like<00:02:30.050> this

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
really I'm going to place it like this

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.559 
really I'm going to place it like this
and<00:02:30.560> then<00:02:31.160> you<00:02:31.310> redstone<00:02:31.760> power<00:02:32.000> block<00:02:32.300> there

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:32.569 
and then you redstone power block there

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:34.449 
and then you redstone power block there
with<00:02:32.990> your<00:02:33.140> redstone<00:02:33.560> lamp<00:02:33.800> down<00:02:34.010> at<00:02:34.160> the<00:02:34.250> bomb

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
with your redstone lamp down at the bomb

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:36.880 
with your redstone lamp down at the bomb
so<00:02:34.819> now<00:02:34.970> you<00:02:35.030> can<00:02:35.240> see<00:02:35.420> those<00:02:35.600> on<00:02:35.990> when<00:02:36.800> we

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
so now you can see those on when we

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.800 
so now you can see those on when we
place<00:02:37.100> down<00:02:37.310> the<00:02:37.400> redstone<00:02:37.730> torch<00:02:37.850> it<00:02:38.600> goes

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
place down the redstone torch it goes

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.230 
place down the redstone torch it goes
off<00:02:39.110> and<00:02:39.590> it<00:02:39.980> just<00:02:40.160> changes<00:02:40.580> state<00:02:40.849> every<00:02:41.209> time

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:41.240 
off and it just changes state every time

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.240 
off and it just changes state every time
we<00:02:41.540> place<00:02:41.750> down<00:02:41.990> our<00:02:42.170> redstone<00:02:42.380> torch<00:02:42.890> which

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
we place down our redstone torch which

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.690 
we place down our redstone torch which
is<00:02:43.400> very<00:02:43.580> helpful<00:02:44.060> and<00:02:44.950> finally<00:02:45.950> on<00:02:46.190> to<00:02:46.459> our

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
is very helpful and finally on to our

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.970 
is very helpful and finally on to our
last<00:02:46.970> design<00:02:47.450> now<00:02:47.660> this<00:02:47.900> one<00:02:48.170> is<00:02:48.410> by<00:02:48.620> far<00:02:48.650> the

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
last design now this one is by far the

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.710 
last design now this one is by far the
biggest<00:02:49.250> I'm<00:02:49.700> sure<00:02:49.910> you've<00:02:50.150> noticed<00:02:50.360> that

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
biggest I'm sure you've noticed that

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.720 
biggest I'm sure you've noticed that
already<00:02:50.870> it's<00:02:51.530> just<00:02:51.770> a<00:02:51.830> lot<00:02:52.010> chunkier<00:02:52.250> and

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
already it's just a lot chunkier and

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.059 
already it's just a lot chunkier and
there's<00:02:52.910> a<00:02:53.000> lot<00:02:53.180> more<00:02:53.360> going<00:02:53.540> on

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 
there's a lot more going on

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:56.099 
there's a lot more going on
a reason<00:02:54.459> for<00:02:54.609> that<00:02:54.760> is<00:02:55.090> because<00:02:55.329> this<00:02:55.659> one<00:02:55.930> is

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:56.109 
a reason for that is because this one is

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:57.929 
a reason for that is because this one is
completely<00:02:56.680> flush<00:02:57.129> with<00:02:57.370> the<00:02:57.459> ground<00:02:57.489> you

00:02:57.929 --> 00:02:57.939 
completely flush with the ground you

00:02:57.939 --> 00:02:59.580 
completely flush with the ground you
don't<00:02:57.969> have<00:02:58.269> to<00:02:58.359> have<00:02:58.480> this<00:02:58.629> in<00:02:58.840> the<00:02:58.870> corner<00:02:59.319> or

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
don't have to have this in the corner or

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.229 
don't have to have this in the corner or
at<00:02:59.829> the<00:02:59.920> edge<00:03:00.099> of<00:03:00.310> your<00:03:00.489> room<00:03:00.700> you<00:03:00.849> can<00:03:00.999> have<00:03:01.120> it

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
at the edge of your room you can have it

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:02.819 
at the edge of your room you can have it
smack<00:03:01.599> bang<00:03:01.810> in<00:03:01.840> the<00:03:02.109> middle<00:03:02.170> of<00:03:02.499> your<00:03:02.650> room

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:02.829 
smack bang in the middle of your room

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:05.160 
smack bang in the middle of your room
and<00:03:03.040> no<00:03:03.489> one<00:03:03.700> will<00:03:03.849> notice<00:03:04.239> it's<00:03:04.420> there<00:03:04.659> so

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
and no one will notice it's there so

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:06.690 
and no one will notice it's there so
this<00:03:05.260> works<00:03:05.560> just<00:03:05.829> like<00:03:05.950> the<00:03:06.069> other<00:03:06.310> ones<00:03:06.519> you

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
this works just like the other ones you

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.610 
this works just like the other ones you
place<00:03:06.909> down<00:03:07.150> your<00:03:07.239> redstone<00:03:07.480> torch<00:03:07.959> it<00:03:08.200> gets

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
place down your redstone torch it gets

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.619 
place down your redstone torch it gets
destroyed<00:03:09.069> but<00:03:09.459> you<00:03:09.579> also<00:03:09.790> get<00:03:10.180> yourself<00:03:10.269> a

00:03:10.619 --> 00:03:10.629 
destroyed but you also get yourself a

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:12.390 
destroyed but you also get yourself a
redstone<00:03:11.139> signal<00:03:11.260> now<00:03:11.859> the<00:03:11.920> way<00:03:12.099> that<00:03:12.310> this

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
redstone signal now the way that this

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.490 
redstone signal now the way that this
one<00:03:12.609> works<00:03:12.819> is<00:03:13.030> a<00:03:13.299> little<00:03:13.629> bit<00:03:13.750> peculiar<00:03:14.230> it

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
one works is a little bit peculiar it

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.309 
one works is a little bit peculiar it
uses<00:03:14.950> detector<00:03:15.760> rails<00:03:16.000> and<00:03:16.299> redstone<00:03:16.750> signals

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:17.319 
uses detector rails and redstone signals

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:19.140 
uses detector rails and redstone signals
getting<00:03:17.530> redirected<00:03:18.400> so<00:03:18.760> I've<00:03:18.849> got<00:03:19.000> a<00:03:19.030> little

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
getting redirected so I've got a little

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.059 
getting redirected so I've got a little
model<00:03:19.450> over<00:03:19.689> here<00:03:19.719> and<00:03:20.109> I'll<00:03:20.379> show<00:03:20.590> you<00:03:20.620> how<00:03:20.919> it

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:21.069 
model over here and I'll show you how it

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:23.729 
model over here and I'll show you how it
all<00:03:21.159> works<00:03:21.840> now<00:03:22.840> the<00:03:22.900> thing<00:03:23.230> to<00:03:23.379> notice<00:03:23.590> here

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
all works now the thing to notice here

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:26.069 
all works now the thing to notice here
is<00:03:23.980> that<00:03:24.189> that<00:03:24.579> biston<00:03:25.150> should<00:03:25.689> not<00:03:25.900> be

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:26.079 
is that that biston should not be

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:27.720 
is that that biston should not be
extended<00:03:26.620> the<00:03:26.739> redstone<00:03:27.129> is<00:03:27.250> on<00:03:27.370> top<00:03:27.549> of<00:03:27.579> a

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
extended the redstone is on top of a

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.640 
extended the redstone is on top of a
half<00:03:27.879> slab<00:03:28.150> and<00:03:28.389> it<00:03:28.719> certainly<00:03:29.109> isn't<00:03:29.349> running

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
half slab and it certainly isn't running

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.189 
half slab and it certainly isn't running
into<00:03:30.010> the<00:03:30.099> piston<00:03:30.340> so<00:03:30.879> it<00:03:31.180> just<00:03:31.840> shouldn't<00:03:32.109> be

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:32.199 
into the piston so it just shouldn't be

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:34.259 
into the piston so it just shouldn't be
extended<00:03:32.799> but<00:03:32.980> it<00:03:33.099> is<00:03:33.310> and<00:03:33.609> that<00:03:33.730> is<00:03:33.879> because

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
extended but it is and that is because

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:36.449 
extended but it is and that is because
this<00:03:34.780> powered<00:03:35.230> rail<00:03:35.469> is<00:03:35.680> actually

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
this powered rail is actually

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:38.670 
this powered rail is actually
redirecting<00:03:37.299> the<00:03:37.419> redstone<00:03:37.870> current<00:03:38.169> and<00:03:38.500> the

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
redirecting the redstone current and the

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.099 
redirecting the redstone current and the
piston<00:03:39.099> hasn't<00:03:39.519> realized<00:03:39.909> it<00:03:40.060> yet<00:03:40.120> until<00:03:40.449> we

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:41.109 
piston hasn't realized it yet until we

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:43.199 
piston hasn't realized it yet until we
cause<00:03:41.349> an<00:03:41.530> update<00:03:42.010> and<00:03:42.189> then<00:03:42.639> it<00:03:42.849> will<00:03:42.969> correct

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
cause an update and then it will correct

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:44.610 
cause an update and then it will correct
yourself<00:03:43.689> and<00:03:43.810> it's<00:03:43.900> the<00:03:43.989> same<00:03:44.199> thing<00:03:44.230> with

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
yourself and it's the same thing with

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.409 
yourself and it's the same thing with
the<00:03:44.769> extension<00:03:45.280> you<00:03:45.310> can<00:03:45.430> see<00:03:45.760> that<00:03:46.030> this

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:46.419 
the extension you can see that this

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:48.569 
the extension you can see that this
redstone<00:03:46.810> dust<00:03:47.139> is<00:03:47.409> actually<00:03:47.980> powering<00:03:48.340> that

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:48.579 
redstone dust is actually powering that

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:50.399 
redstone dust is actually powering that
piston<00:03:49.090> but<00:03:49.419> the<00:03:49.480> piston<00:03:49.870> just<00:03:50.049> hasn't

00:03:50.399 --> 00:03:50.409 
piston but the piston just hasn't

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:52.589 
piston but the piston just hasn't
noticed<00:03:50.769> until<00:03:51.040> we<00:03:51.669> caused<00:03:51.879> it<00:03:51.909> the<00:03:52.090> update

00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:52.599 
noticed until we caused it the update

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:54.899 
noticed until we caused it the update
now<00:03:52.780> this<00:03:52.989> is<00:03:53.169> a<00:03:53.260> very<00:03:53.709> useful<00:03:54.069> mechanic<00:03:54.760> I

00:03:54.899 --> 00:03:54.909 
now this is a very useful mechanic I

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:57.209 
now this is a very useful mechanic I
know<00:03:55.209> that<00:03:55.540> it<00:03:55.659> wasn't<00:03:55.840> intended<00:03:56.439> but<00:03:57.040> it's

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:57.219 
know that it wasn't intended but it's

00:03:57.219 --> 00:03:58.979 
know that it wasn't intended but it's
extremely<00:03:57.669> helpful<00:03:58.000> for<00:03:58.479> building<00:03:58.629> things

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
extremely helpful for building things

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:01.800 
extremely helpful for building things
like<00:03:59.169> redstone<00:04:00.069> torch<00:04:00.370> keys<00:04:00.669> and<00:04:00.909> even<00:04:01.540> lamp

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
like redstone torch keys and even lamp

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.509 
like redstone torch keys and even lamp
buds<00:04:02.079> this<00:04:02.349> is<00:04:02.439> what<00:04:02.590> it<00:04:02.680> used<00:04:02.709> to<00:04:02.919> run<00:04:03.129> off<00:04:03.310> so

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:03.519 
buds this is what it used to run off so

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:05.759 
buds this is what it used to run off so
you<00:04:03.609> can<00:04:03.729> see<00:04:04.000> that<00:04:04.239> if<00:04:04.900> we<00:04:05.049> place<00:04:05.259> the<00:04:05.530> lamp

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:05.769 
you can see that if we place the lamp

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:07.349 
you can see that if we place the lamp
next<00:04:05.919> to<00:04:06.069> that<00:04:06.250> obviously<00:04:06.430> will<00:04:06.849> be<00:04:06.939> powered

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:07.359 
next to that obviously will be powered

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:09.240 
next to that obviously will be powered
but<00:04:07.720> then<00:04:07.840> when<00:04:08.019> we<00:04:08.049> redirect<00:04:08.769> the<00:04:08.859> redstone

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
but then when we redirect the redstone

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.789 
but then when we redirect the redstone
current<00:04:09.459> the<00:04:10.150> lamp<00:04:10.359> stays<00:04:10.659> on<00:04:10.870> until<00:04:11.019> we<00:04:11.590> cause

00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:11.799 
current the lamp stays on until we cause

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:14.159 
current the lamp stays on until we cause
it<00:04:11.949> an<00:04:12.040> update<00:04:12.629> so<00:04:13.629> you<00:04:13.720> want<00:04:13.840> to<00:04:13.900> get<00:04:14.019> things

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:14.169 
it an update so you want to get things

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:16.620 
it an update so you want to get things
started<00:04:14.470> with<00:04:14.739> a<00:04:14.799> four<00:04:15.220> by<00:04:15.400> six<00:04:15.430> area<00:04:16.269> you<00:04:16.479> want

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
started with a four by six area you want

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.060 
started with a four by six area you want
to<00:04:16.720> go<00:04:16.810> to<00:04:16.870> the<00:04:17.109> back<00:04:17.289> and<00:04:17.320> get<00:04:17.709> the<00:04:17.859> ball

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
to go to the back and get the ball

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.430 
to go to the back and get the ball
rolling<00:04:18.579> by<00:04:19.000> placing<00:04:19.599> three<00:04:19.780> blocks<00:04:20.229> along

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
rolling by placing three blocks along

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.040 
rolling by placing three blocks along
like<00:04:20.620> this<00:04:20.859> a<00:04:21.070> sticky<00:04:21.759> piston<00:04:21.940> and<00:04:22.330> then<00:04:22.870> your

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
like this a sticky piston and then your

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.230 
like this a sticky piston and then your
detector<00:04:23.620> rail<00:04:23.800> there<00:04:24.190> down<00:04:24.669> here<00:04:24.699> you<00:04:25.090> want

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
detector rail there down here you want

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.330 
detector rail there down here you want
to<00:04:25.300> place<00:04:25.449> a<00:04:25.630> half<00:04:25.900> slab<00:04:26.229> with<00:04:26.680> a<00:04:26.710> redstone

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
to place a half slab with a redstone

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.820 
to place a half slab with a redstone
dust<00:04:27.610> on<00:04:27.909> top<00:04:28.270> now<00:04:28.659> it's<00:04:28.810> very<00:04:29.139> important<00:04:29.680> that

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
dust on top now it's very important that

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.469 
dust on top now it's very important that
that<00:04:29.949> is<00:04:30.130> a<00:04:30.159> half<00:04:30.400> slab<00:04:30.669> otherwise<00:04:31.030> this<00:04:31.270> won't

00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:31.479 
that is a half slab otherwise this won't

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:34.140 
that is a half slab otherwise this won't
work<00:04:31.630> and<00:04:31.840> then<00:04:32.440> a<00:04:32.650> piston<00:04:33.130> facing<00:04:33.340> upwards

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
work and then a piston facing upwards

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:37.459 
work and then a piston facing upwards
with<00:04:34.750> your<00:04:34.990> floor<00:04:35.380> block<00:04:35.620> on<00:04:35.919> top<00:04:36.250> like<00:04:36.520> that

00:04:37.459 --> 00:04:37.469 
with your floor block on top like that

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:39.719 
with your floor block on top like that
now<00:04:38.469> for<00:04:38.710> the<00:04:38.770> next<00:04:38.919> part<00:04:39.039> you<00:04:39.340> want<00:04:39.490> to<00:04:39.520> place

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:39.729 
now for the next part you want to place

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:42.300 
now for the next part you want to place
down<00:04:39.969> a<00:04:40.270> furnace<00:04:40.870> or<00:04:41.110> a<00:04:41.169> chest<00:04:41.830> or<00:04:42.070> something

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
down a furnace or a chest or something

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.939 
down a furnace or a chest or something
like<00:04:42.460> that<00:04:42.520> and<00:04:42.880> place<00:04:43.330> at<00:04:43.539> least<00:04:43.810> one<00:04:44.199> item<00:04:44.530> in

like that and place at least one item in

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:47.339 
like that and place at least one item in
that<00:04:45.130> furnace<00:04:45.430> a<00:04:45.849> block<00:04:46.449> out<00:04:46.630> like<00:04:46.810> this<00:04:47.050> with

00:04:47.339 --> 00:04:47.349 
that furnace a block out like this with

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:49.950 
that furnace a block out like this with
a<00:04:47.380> comparator<00:04:48.310> on<00:04:48.490> top<00:04:48.789> running<00:04:49.330> into<00:04:49.750> that

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960 
a comparator on top running into that

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.749 
a comparator on top running into that
block<00:04:50.349> and<00:04:50.530> then<00:04:51.070> you<00:04:51.190> just<00:04:51.370> want<00:04:51.490> to<00:04:51.580> place

00:04:51.749 --> 00:04:51.759 
block and then you just want to place

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:54.089 
block and then you just want to place
three<00:04:52.150> blocks<00:04:52.180> along<00:04:52.659> here<00:04:52.990> redstone<00:04:53.860> dust

00:04:54.089 --> 00:04:54.099 
three blocks along here redstone dust

00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:56.850 
three blocks along here redstone dust
and<00:04:54.460> a<00:04:54.639> repeater<00:04:55.120> set<00:04:55.750> it<00:04:55.870> to<00:04:56.020> four<00:04:56.320> ticks<00:04:56.590> and

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
and a repeater set it to four ticks and

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.770 
and a repeater set it to four ticks and
then<00:04:57.340> your<00:04:57.610> redstone<00:04:57.789> dust<00:04:58.180> there<00:04:58.479> but<00:04:58.659> that

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780 
then your redstone dust there but that

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.170 
then your redstone dust there but that
will<00:04:59.050> create<00:04:59.320> a<00:04:59.440> clock<00:04:59.800> so<00:05:00.310> I'll<00:05:00.669> probably

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 
will create a clock so I'll probably

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.140 
will create a clock so I'll probably
wait<00:05:01.479> until<00:05:01.509> the<00:05:01.870> end<00:05:01.990> to<00:05:02.080> do<00:05:02.229> that<00:05:02.409> one<00:05:02.590> and

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.150 
wait until the end to do that one and

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.189 
wait until the end to do that one and
finally<00:05:04.150> you<00:05:04.270> want<00:05:04.360> to<00:05:04.449> place<00:05:04.659> a<00:05:04.900> redstone

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:05.199 
finally you want to place a redstone

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:07.500 
finally you want to place a redstone
torch<00:05:05.740> here<00:05:05.800> two<00:05:06.219> blocks<00:05:06.550> along<00:05:06.789> like<00:05:06.969> this

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:07.510 
torch here two blocks along like this

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:10.410 
torch here two blocks along like this
redstone<00:05:08.080> dust<00:05:08.320> a<00:05:08.650> repeater<00:05:09.310> and<00:05:09.670> then<00:05:10.180> a

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:10.420 
redstone dust a repeater and then a

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:12.600 
redstone dust a repeater and then a
block<00:05:10.750> up<00:05:10.990> like<00:05:11.230> that<00:05:11.470> then<00:05:11.920> over<00:05:12.130> here<00:05:12.160> just

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
block up like that then over here just

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.490 
block up like that then over here just
wanna<00:05:12.760> place<00:05:12.970> two<00:05:13.210> blocks<00:05:13.330> along<00:05:13.780> and<00:05:14.050> then

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:14.500 
wanna place two blocks along and then

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.560 
wanna place two blocks along and then
two<00:05:14.890> repeaters<00:05:15.220> set<00:05:15.610> both<00:05:15.820> of<00:05:16.030> them<00:05:16.240> to<00:05:16.390> two

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:16.570 
two repeaters set both of them to two

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:18.540 
two repeaters set both of them to two
ticks<00:05:16.870> now<00:05:17.050> they<00:05:17.200> both<00:05:17.410> need<00:05:17.680> to<00:05:17.710> be<00:05:17.830> repeaters

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:18.550 
ticks now they both need to be repeaters

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.460 
ticks now they both need to be repeaters
because<00:05:19.150> otherwise<00:05:19.450> that<00:05:19.840> detector<00:05:20.320> rail

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:20.470 
because otherwise that detector rail

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:22.680 
because otherwise that detector rail
will<00:05:20.920> pick<00:05:21.100> up<00:05:21.250> this<00:05:21.370> redstone<00:05:21.730> dust<00:05:22.090> and<00:05:22.390> it

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:22.690 
will pick up this redstone dust and it

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:24.360 
will pick up this redstone dust and it
just<00:05:22.840> won't<00:05:22.960> work<00:05:23.170> anymore<00:05:23.500> but<00:05:23.980> that<00:05:24.160> should

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.370 
just won't work anymore but that should

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:25.950 
just won't work anymore but that should
be<00:05:24.490> it<00:05:24.610> all<00:05:24.760> done<00:05:25.060> you<00:05:25.450> just<00:05:25.630> want<00:05:25.750> to<00:05:25.810> place

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:25.960 
be it all done you just want to place

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.630 
be it all done you just want to place
your<00:05:26.110> redstone<00:05:26.530> dust<00:05:26.710> down<00:05:26.980> there<00:05:27.310> to<00:05:27.460> finish

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:27.640 
your redstone dust down there to finish

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:30.210 
your redstone dust down there to finish
all<00:05:27.880> off<00:05:28.150> that<00:05:28.600> will<00:05:28.780> extend<00:05:29.170> and<00:05:29.470> then<00:05:29.500> there

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:30.220 
all off that will extend and then there

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.430 
all off that will extend and then there
we<00:05:30.340> have<00:05:30.520> it<00:05:30.670> you've<00:05:30.820> got<00:05:31.030> yourself<00:05:31.510> a<00:05:31.720> working

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:32.440 
we have it you've got yourself a working

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.190 
we have it you've got yourself a working
redstone<00:05:32.890> torch<00:05:33.190> key<00:05:33.750> now<00:05:34.750> if<00:05:34.870> you<00:05:34.960> want<00:05:35.140> to

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:35.200 
redstone torch key now if you want to

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.020 
redstone torch key now if you want to
turn<00:05:35.350> this<00:05:35.560> one<00:05:35.740> into<00:05:35.980> a<00:05:36.010> T<00:05:36.220> flip-flop<00:05:36.520> once

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:37.030 
turn this one into a T flip-flop once

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:38.670 
turn this one into a T flip-flop once
again<00:05:37.390> it's<00:05:37.600> a<00:05:37.690> little<00:05:37.840> bit<00:05:37.990> difficult<00:05:38.290> you

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:38.680 
again it's a little bit difficult you

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.590 
again it's a little bit difficult you
just<00:05:38.860> want<00:05:39.010> to<00:05:39.040> place<00:05:39.220> a<00:05:39.400> repeater<00:05:39.790> down<00:05:40.270> here

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:40.600 
just want to place a repeater down here

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.510 
just want to place a repeater down here
sticky<00:05:41.170> piston<00:05:41.500> facing<00:05:41.650> upwards<00:05:42.250> with<00:05:42.370> your

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:42.520 
sticky piston facing upwards with your

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.790 
sticky piston facing upwards with your
block<00:05:42.730> on<00:05:42.970> top<00:05:43.240> and<00:05:43.450> then<00:05:44.020> ya<00:05:44.500> another

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:44.800 
block on top and then ya another

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.430 
block on top and then ya another
repeater<00:05:45.250> like<00:05:45.520> that<00:05:45.790> and<00:05:46.000> a<00:05:46.510> sticky<00:05:46.960> piston

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:47.440 
repeater like that and a sticky piston

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.880 
repeater like that and a sticky piston
facing<00:05:47.770> in<00:05:48.280> this<00:05:48.910> direction<00:05:49.210> over<00:05:49.900> here<00:05:50.080> by

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:50.890 
facing in this direction over here by

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:52.830 
facing in this direction over here by
shift-clicking<00:05:51.280> on<00:05:51.670> that<00:05:51.820> repeater<00:05:52.180> your

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:52.840 
shift-clicking on that repeater your

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:54.750 
shift-clicking on that repeater your
power<00:05:53.140> block<00:05:53.500> and<00:05:53.710> then<00:05:54.130> you<00:05:54.280> should<00:05:54.340> get<00:05:54.730> a

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:54.760 
power block and then you should get a

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:56.520 
power block and then you should get a
change<00:05:55.180> of<00:05:55.330> state<00:05:55.600> so<00:05:55.870> when<00:05:56.020> we<00:05:56.110> place<00:05:56.320> down

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:56.530 
change of state so when we place down

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:58.740 
change of state so when we place down
this<00:05:56.650> redstone<00:05:56.980> torch<00:05:57.400> you'll<00:05:57.880> see<00:05:58.150> that<00:05:58.420> it

00:05:58.740 --> 00:05:58.750 
this redstone torch you'll see that it

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:03.930 
this redstone torch you'll see that it
comes<00:05:59.140> on<00:05:59.440> and<00:05:59.850> then<00:06:00.870> we<00:06:01.870> have<00:06:01.900> off<00:06:02.670> so<00:06:03.670> there

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:03.940 
comes on and then we have off so there

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:05.460 
comes on and then we have off so there
we<00:06:04.060> have<00:06:04.210> it<00:06:04.360> guys<00:06:04.390> those<00:06:04.930> are<00:06:04.960> all<00:06:05.320> the

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:05.470 
we have it guys those are all the

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:07.470 
we have it guys those are all the
designs<00:06:05.920> for<00:06:06.280> the<00:06:06.370> redstone<00:06:06.790> torch<00:06:06.820> keys<00:06:07.330> that
