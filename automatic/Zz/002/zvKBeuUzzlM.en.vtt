00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.719
 phelps 

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:27.010
 the 76 percent chance of relapse 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:29.890
 reckless target 50% chance of 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:32.260
 failure and this is not a 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.850
 acceptable to reach training 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:37.239
 even the best players of the moment 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:39.940
 they make mistakes they risk a lot after all 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:43.390
 of accounts are only human but if not 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:46.570
 I would like to present to you the future of 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:49.420
 our clones taken from 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:53.610
 perfect decision guaranteed results 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:56.830
 this is what the people that football has changed 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:00.250
 It's always marcos paulo santos at match 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:02.530
 but now he will overthrow the king victory 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.629
 stay for now the thigh for flowers have entered 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.060
 in the head that now has been 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.310
 substituted 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.100
 that the times RibÃ©ry back on campus 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.500
 They changed the soccer of the I do not know if it will be 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.280
 this last time we will see Christian 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.590
 ronaldo 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.090
 the question now is whether this will be the end 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.090
 phenomenal football 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:38.200
 The owner of basketball is not what counts. 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:40.390
 ready without any regrets is having someone who football 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.000
 it's an unpredictable business joel santana 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.560
 I know what you think happened to 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.030
 traditional ones you mean what 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:50.200
 they are doing it and where they are now 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.729
 Who was 19? 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.979
 I am indeed who looks I am 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.979
 it was me and it works 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.280
 the right to know it 

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:13.970
 I only had the same last week 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.970
 realizing that you are not permanent 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:24.650
 You're kidding. 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:27.080
 vilagra is not so weak that it happened 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:32.349
 because everyone here to prove that 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:32.349
 they are wrong to save football 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.180
 I liked what you did in this place. 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:40.489
 The game we love is dying. 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:44.299
 clones are breaking up with him 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:46.310
 we must say that he apologizes to 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:47.720
 support these we want to end 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.239
 the clashes but they are invincible 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.849
 No one agrees that they agree. 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:56.299
 can be defeated but you 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:57.349
 can do is what you all say 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:59.480
 together 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:02.599
 remember what makes you 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:05.450
 you better not be afraid to risk 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:07.700
 You play like it's a game. 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:12.459
 play as if it were a job you 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.459
 risk everything to win everything 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:19.970
 martins greater than playing without risking 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:22.850
 It's official the originals are Japanese 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:25.010

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:27.900
 promise to make everything good forever 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:30.689
 The question is how convinced is it? 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.400
 This is the stage for most of the 

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:35.310
 planet the whole world is watching 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.610

 this Saturday he 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:08.790
 do not risk bigger with a play without 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.790

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.330
