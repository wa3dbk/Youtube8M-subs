00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.390
 very good to achieve flexibility 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.250
 necessary for the scorpion the flyer 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.710
 you should start with two basic exercises 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.599
 the carp and the bow these two 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.000
 exercises that we teach them in the 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.869
 trainer 5 of season 1 please 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.869
 revitalizes 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.260
 very well the scorpion requires a very 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.640
 good split therefore we must 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.829
 develop this exercise 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.600
 properly from the beginning you should 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:53.210
 keep in mind that a good split has 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:56.720
 knees feet tips blocked 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:59.059
 shoulders centered and hip aligned one 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.339
 Once you achieve the split in 180 degrees 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:03.199
 opening you should increase your range of 

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:06.020
 flexibility therefore you can 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:08.370
 use mats or drawers that elevate 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.650
 the height of your legs 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.720
 It is very important that you also have a 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.340
 good shoulder flexibility so 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.860
 you should both do hyper exercises 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.980
 extension as for example be mouth 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.290
 down and bring your arms back 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.810
 another exercise that helps you improve 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.410
 the flexibility of shoulders are the arches 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.410
 with height 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.329
 Once you have the split with height and 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:36.490
 you have good flexibility in your shoulders 

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:38.530
 you must combine these two exercises a 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.610
 good exercise would be hyperextension 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:45.980
 of quadriceps 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:48.880
 and the other could be to combine the split 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.880
 with art
