00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799 
let's see if we can do that yeah we can

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:03.750 
let's see if we can do that yeah we can
alright<00:03:59.069> we<00:03:59.220> move<00:03:59.370> that<00:03:59.519> out<00:03:59.700> of<00:03:59.760> the<00:03:59.819> way

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.900 
this one has ninety five point four on
the<00:05:08.169> left<00:05:08.380> and<00:05:08.590> then<00:05:08.710> this<00:05:08.889> one<00:05:09.160> the<00:05:09.639> sharp

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:09.910 
the left and then this one the sharp

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.320 
shot one has fifty four point two

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:16.620 
shot one has fifty four point two
thousand<00:05:14.320> per<00:05:14.500> hour<00:05:14.650> alright<00:05:15.580> so<00:05:16.419> that's<00:05:16.570> how

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:16.630 
thousand per hour alright so that's how

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:21.140 
thousand per hour alright so that's how
much<00:05:16.900> it<00:05:17.080> generates<00:05:17.590> if<00:05:17.770> you're<00:05:17.919> wondering

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.150 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.779

00:05:24.779 --> 00:05:24.789 
again here it is in its second form

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:26.790 
again here it is in its second form
essentially<00:05:25.360> his<00:05:25.570> final<00:05:25.960> form<00:05:26.200> until<00:05:26.530> is

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:26.800 
essentially his final form until is

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.860 
essentially his final form until is
tightened<00:05:27.280> for<00:05:27.490> maybe<00:05:28.150> well<00:05:28.510> actually<00:05:28.690> a

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:28.870 
tightened for maybe well actually a

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:31.140 
tightened for maybe well actually a
Titan<00:05:29.289> pretty<00:05:30.130> much<00:05:30.310> looks<00:05:30.580> the<00:05:30.669> same<00:05:30.820> someone

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:31.150 
Titan pretty much looks the same someone

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.330 
Titan pretty much looks the same someone
actually<00:05:31.450> comment<00:05:31.840> and<00:05:32.020> hey<00:05:32.710> the<00:05:32.979> Titan

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:33.340 
actually comment and hey the Titan

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:34.590 
actually comment and hey the Titan
doesn't<00:05:33.580> look<00:05:33.700> that<00:05:33.729> much<00:05:34.000> of<00:05:34.120> a<00:05:34.180> difference

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:34.600 
doesn't look that much of a difference

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.190 
doesn't look that much of a difference
you<00:05:34.840> know<00:05:35.320> his<00:05:36.010> I<00:05:36.370> think<00:05:37.000> his<00:05:37.360> uh<00:05:37.389> either<00:05:38.020> his

you know his I think his uh either his

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.110 
you know his I think his uh either his
bones<00:05:38.470> kind<00:05:38.860> of<00:05:38.950> get<00:05:39.070> bigger<00:05:39.280> or<00:05:39.580> it<00:05:40.060> just

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:40.120 
bones kind of get bigger or it just

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.480 
bones kind of get bigger or it just
changes<00:05:40.570> very<00:05:41.050> slightly<00:05:41.590> there's<00:05:41.919> this<00:05:42.039> just

very slight changes so anyways here it

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:48.480 
very slight changes so anyways here it
is<00:05:45.880> sharp<00:05:46.240> shot<00:05:46.510> let<00:05:47.200> me<00:05:47.380> know<00:05:47.590> what<00:05:48.070> one<00:05:48.340> you

there aren't any differences it's really

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:03.960 
there aren't any differences it's really
hard<00:06:01.810> to<00:06:02.020> say<00:06:02.229> hey<00:06:02.530> let's<00:06:02.889> turn<00:06:03.610> them<00:06:03.789> all<00:06:03.940> into

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:03.970 
hard to say hey let's turn them all into

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:05.670 
hard to say hey let's turn them all into
Titan<00:06:04.630> when<00:06:04.810> they<00:06:04.960> just<00:06:05.200> get<00:06:05.349> bigger<00:06:05.500> and

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:05.680 
Titan when they just get bigger and

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.370 
Titan when they just get bigger and
there's<00:06:06.370> not<00:06:06.520> much<00:06:06.669> of<00:06:06.789> a<00:06:06.849> difference<00:06:07.210> so<00:06:07.419> let

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:08.380 
there's not much of a difference so let
