single LSC combo that I can think of

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.260 
single LSC combo that I can think of
that<00:00:34.890> looks<00:00:35.130> good

anyway<00:00:45.329> guys<00:00:45.539> this<00:00:46.670> series<00:00:47.670> I<00:00:47.820> thought<00:00:47.969> you

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
anyway guys this series I thought you

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.610 
anyway guys this series I thought you
know<00:00:48.239> I'd<00:00:48.390> bring<00:00:48.660> it<00:00:48.780> back<00:00:48.989> because<00:00:49.379> I<00:00:49.500> was

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
know I'd bring it back because I was

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.049 
know I'd bring it back because I was
playing<00:00:49.860> around<00:00:49.980> with<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.520> actual<00:00:50.820> car

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
playing around with the actual car

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.970 
playing around with the actual car
in-game<00:00:51.629> and<00:00:51.899> I<00:00:51.989> was<00:00:52.110> just<00:00:52.230> like<00:00:52.410> holy<00:00:52.649> moly

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
in-game and I was just like holy moly

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.700 
in-game and I was just like holy moly
maybe<00:00:53.879> this<00:00:54.149> could<00:00:54.360> work<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:54.840> man<00:00:55.199> it<00:00:55.410> has

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
maybe this could work and man it has

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.220 
maybe this could work and man it has
this<00:00:56.280> I<00:00:56.489> think<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.120> second<00:00:57.539> last<00:00:57.690> color<00:00:58.020> I

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
this I think the second last color I

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.000 
this I think the second last color I
recorded<00:00:58.980> is<00:00:59.670> absolutely<00:01:00.570> insane<00:01:00.840> like<00:01:01.739> I've

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
recorded is absolutely insane like I've

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.250 
recorded is absolutely insane like I've
actually<00:01:02.190> left<00:01:02.730> it<00:01:02.910> on<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.059> t2<00:01:03.600> I<00:01:03.809> need<00:01:03.960> to<00:01:04.080> use

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
actually left it on the t2 I need to use

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.410 
actually left it on the t2 I need to use
on<00:01:04.439> one<00:01:04.559> of<00:01:04.589> my<00:01:04.799> main<00:01:04.979> accounts<00:01:05.489> just<00:01:06.030> because

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
on one of my main accounts just because

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.320 
on one of my main accounts just because
it<00:01:06.540> looks<00:01:06.720> so<00:01:06.840> good<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:08.010> idea<00:01:08.520> but<00:01:08.760> behind

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
it looks so good and the idea but behind

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.300 
it looks so good and the idea but behind
you<00:01:09.659> know<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.780> whole<00:01:10.020> two-tone<00:01:10.560> concept<00:01:11.130> is

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
you know the whole two-tone concept is

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.690 
you know the whole two-tone concept is
to<00:01:11.909> get<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.150> base<00:01:12.540> color<00:01:13.159> especially<00:01:14.159> for<00:01:14.640> the

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
to get a base color especially for the

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.429 
to get a base color especially for the
t20<00:01:15.240> because<00:01:15.509> it<00:01:15.630> looks<00:01:15.810> so<00:01:16.020> good<00:01:16.200> on<00:01:16.290> this

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
t20 because it looks so good on this

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.950 
t20 because it looks so good on this
sort<00:01:16.650> of<00:01:16.680> concept<00:01:16.979> car<00:01:17.460> then<00:01:18.150> get<00:01:18.390> a<00:01:18.420> second

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
sort of concept car then get a second

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.410 
sort of concept car then get a second
secondary<00:01:19.680> color<00:01:19.979> but<00:01:20.640> a<00:01:20.759> color<00:01:21.180> that's

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
secondary color but a color that's

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.810 
secondary color but a color that's
similar<00:01:21.570> on<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.259> palette<00:01:22.920> scale<00:01:23.250> that<00:01:23.700> they

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
similar on the palette scale that they

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.690 
similar on the palette scale that they
give<00:01:24.060> you<00:01:24.180> at<00:01:24.299> LSE<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:25.530> next<00:01:25.890> step<00:01:26.189> is<00:01:26.430> adding

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
give you at LSE the next step is adding

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.789 
give you at LSE the next step is adding
a<00:01:26.880> pearlescent<00:01:27.299> that<00:01:27.750> will<00:01:27.869> actually<00:01:28.290> blend

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
a pearlescent that will actually blend

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.460 
a pearlescent that will actually blend
the<00:01:29.460> two<00:01:29.640> colors<00:01:29.670> together<00:01:30.240> so<00:01:30.840> that<00:01:31.170> when<00:01:31.320> you

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
the two colors together so that when you

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.130 
the two colors together so that when you
go<00:01:31.590> into<00:01:31.740> sunlight<00:01:32.130> or<00:01:32.640> anywhere<00:01:32.939> bright<00:01:33.329> it's

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
go into sunlight or anywhere bright it's

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.410 
go into sunlight or anywhere bright it's
actually<00:01:34.560> gonna<00:01:34.740> sort<00:01:35.400> of<00:01:35.490> create<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.090> effect

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
actually gonna sort of create the effect

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.539 
actually gonna sort of create the effect
of<00:01:36.570> a<00:01:36.689> really<00:01:37.079> really<00:01:37.229> vibrant<00:01:37.680> pearlescent

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
of a really really vibrant pearlescent

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.330 
of a really really vibrant pearlescent
better<00:01:38.820> than<00:01:39.060> one<00:01:39.329> that<00:01:39.930> just<00:01:40.200> has<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.860> actual

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
better than one that just has the actual

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.850 
better than one that just has the actual
primary<00:01:42.090> base<00:01:42.570> with<00:01:42.899> a<00:01:42.930> pearlescent<00:01:43.380> so<00:01:43.740> it's

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
primary base with a pearlescent so it's

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.460 
primary base with a pearlescent so it's
giving<00:01:44.130> that<00:01:44.250> extra<00:01:45.000> oomph<00:01:45.180> you<00:01:46.020> know<00:01:46.140> they're

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
giving that extra oomph you know they're

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.240 
giving that extra oomph you know they're
