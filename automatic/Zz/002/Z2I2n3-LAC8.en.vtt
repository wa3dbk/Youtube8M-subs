it's pretty good it's reliable is what
I've<00:05:52.060> come<00:05:52.240> to<00:05:52.300> notice<00:05:52.720> it's<00:05:53.170> a<00:05:53.290> reliable

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:53.560 
I've come to notice it's a reliable

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.250 
I've come to notice it's a reliable
blaster<00:05:54.360> the<00:05:55.360> power<00:05:55.540> could<00:05:55.810> always<00:05:55.930> be<00:05:56.230> better

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:56.260 
blaster the power could always be better

00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:00.240 
blaster the power could always be better
and<00:05:57.630> but<00:05:58.630> the<00:05:59.170> accuracy<00:05:59.680> is<00:05:59.740> alright<00:06:00.040> for<00:06:00.070> a

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:00.250 
and but the accuracy is alright for a

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:01.740 
and but the accuracy is alright for a
mega<00:06:00.430> blaster<00:06:00.970> it's<00:06:01.090> your<00:06:01.210> standard<00:06:01.390> mega

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:01.750 
mega blaster it's your standard mega

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:04.290 
mega blaster it's your standard mega
accuracy<00:06:02.410> which<00:06:03.190> is<00:06:03.340> to<00:06:03.520> say<00:06:03.700> average

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:04.300 
accuracy which is to say average

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.930 
accuracy which is to say average
it's<00:06:04.630> average<00:06:05.170> nerf<00:06:05.800> stuff<00:06:06.130> it's<00:06:06.340> not<00:06:06.460> dead-on

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:06.940 
it's average nerf stuff it's not dead-on

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:09.990 
it's average nerf stuff it's not dead-on
but<00:06:07.480> it's<00:06:08.140> it's<00:06:08.410> general<00:06:09.160> vicinity<00:06:09.490> of<00:06:09.730> where

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:10.000 
but it's it's general vicinity of where

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.050 
but it's it's general vicinity of where
