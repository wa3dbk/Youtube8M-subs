a race map of course it is not REM Kings
makes<00:00:57.449> flood<00:00:57.690> maps<00:00:58.280> not<00:00:59.280> race<00:00:59.520> maps<00:00:59.789> but<00:01:00.120> you

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
makes flood maps not race maps but you

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.810 
makes flood maps not race maps but you
can<00:01:00.420> see<00:01:00.600> he<00:01:00.750> had<00:01:00.989> no<00:01:01.620> trouble<00:01:02.039> setting<00:01:02.579> up<00:01:02.699> the

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
can see he had no trouble setting up the

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.000 
can see he had no trouble setting up the
roadways<00:01:03.239> which<00:01:04.049> of<00:01:04.229> course<00:01:04.260> are<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:04.680> huge

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
roadways which of course are a huge

paint set up sometimes with the gradual
curves<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:08.460> whatnot<00:01:08.820> so<00:01:09.060> I<00:01:09.810> really<00:01:10.140> think

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
curves and whatnot so I really think

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.740 
curves and whatnot so I really think
that<00:01:10.409> people<00:01:10.830> who<00:01:11.189> like<00:01:11.460> race<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:12.030> have<00:01:12.510> kind

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
that people who like race and have kind

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.289

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
give you a little bit of time to get in

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.899 
give you a little bit of time to get in
a<00:01:50.340> vehicle

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
a vehicle

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.840 
a vehicle
actually<00:01:51.420> start<00:01:51.659> moving<00:01:52.189> so<00:01:53.189> once<00:01:53.609> you<00:01:53.729> get

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
actually start moving so once you get

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.029 
actually start moving so once you get
driving<00:01:54.200> you'll<00:01:55.200> find<00:01:55.380> that<00:01:55.560> there's<00:01:55.740> a<00:01:55.829> lot

00:01:56.029 --> 00:01:56.039 
driving you'll find that there's a lot

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:57.980 
driving you'll find that there's a lot
of<00:01:56.069> different<00:01:56.549> routes<00:01:56.729> to<00:01:56.939> use<00:01:57.090> different

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
of different routes to use different

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.260 
of different routes to use different
jumps<00:01:58.319> throughout<00:01:58.679> this<00:01:58.829> kind<00:01:59.100> of<00:01:59.270> scattered

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
jumps throughout this kind of scattered

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.990 
jumps throughout this kind of scattered
series<00:02:00.659> of<00:02:00.810> highways<00:02:01.700> from<00:02:02.700> what<00:02:02.880> I've<00:02:02.969> seen

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
series of highways from what I've seen

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.199 
series of highways from what I've seen
most<00:02:03.569> people's<00:02:03.990> strategy<00:02:04.590> is<00:02:05.100> to<00:02:05.209> drive

00:02:06.199 --> 00:02:06.209 
most people's strategy is to drive

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:08.380 
most people's strategy is to drive
around<00:02:06.359> the<00:02:06.569> outskirts<00:02:06.899> of<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.409> map<00:02:07.619> in<00:02:07.890> one

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
around the outskirts of the map in one

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.559 
around the outskirts of the map in one
linear<00:02:09.390> direction<00:02:09.629> I<00:02:10.400> would<00:02:11.400> try<00:02:12.030> and<00:02:12.090> avoid

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
linear direction I would try and avoid

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.080 
linear direction I would try and avoid
this<00:02:12.870> as<00:02:13.110> much<00:02:13.379> as<00:02:13.560> possible<00:02:13.739> if<00:02:14.700> you<00:02:14.790> want<00:02:15.000> to

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
this as much as possible if you want to

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.240 
this as much as possible if you want to
actually<00:02:15.239> switch<00:02:15.660> it<00:02:15.840> up<00:02:16.069> switch<00:02:17.069> up<00:02:17.220> your

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
actually switch it up switch up your

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.619 
actually switch it up switch up your
routes<00:02:17.580> there's<00:02:17.879> a<00:02:17.940> lot<00:02:18.090> of<00:02:18.120> different<00:02:18.239> routes

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:18.629 
routes there's a lot of different routes

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:21.729 
routes there's a lot of different routes
you<00:02:19.349> can<00:02:19.379> use<00:02:19.830> turn<00:02:20.670> around<00:02:20.819> go<00:02:21.150> the<00:02:21.299> other<00:02:21.330> way

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
you can use turn around go the other way

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:24.140 
you can use turn around go the other way
you<00:02:22.739> want<00:02:22.950> to<00:02:23.010> be<00:02:23.099> unpredictable<00:02:23.459> since<00:02:24.000> the

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
you want to be unpredictable since the

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.050 
you want to be unpredictable since the
zombies<00:02:24.540> are<00:02:24.569> just<00:02:24.959> as<00:02:25.110> fast<00:02:25.319> as<00:02:25.560> a<00:02:25.590> warthog

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
zombies are just as fast as a warthog

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.910 
zombies are just as fast as a warthog
it's<00:02:27.060> pretty<00:02:27.299> easy<00:02:27.450> for<00:02:28.079> them<00:02:28.200> to<00:02:28.260> set<00:02:28.709> up<00:02:28.799> an

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
it's pretty easy for them to set up an

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.369 
it's pretty easy for them to set up an
ambush<00:02:29.069> so<00:02:29.579> I've<00:02:30.329> talked<00:02:30.629> a<00:02:30.750> little<00:02:30.930> bit<00:02:31.110> about

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:31.379 
ambush so I've talked a little bit about

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:33.319 
ambush so I've talked a little bit about
this<00:02:31.560> before<00:02:32.069> but<00:02:32.640> something<00:02:32.819> that<00:02:33.150> I<00:02:33.180> think

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:33.329 
this before but something that I think

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:35.530 
this before but something that I think
is<00:02:33.599> really<00:02:34.019> important<00:02:34.500> in<00:02:34.590> flood<00:02:34.829> maps<00:02:35.099> is

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
is really important in flood maps is

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.150 
is really important in flood maps is
making<00:02:36.540> the<00:02:36.629> flood<00:02:36.930> side<00:02:37.200> of<00:02:37.349> it<00:02:37.470> interesting

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
making the flood side of it interesting

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.460 
making the flood side of it interesting
and<00:02:38.310> still<00:02:38.579> fun<00:02:38.849> I<00:02:39.120> would<00:02:39.930> actually<00:02:40.049> say<00:02:40.290> that

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
and still fun I would actually say that

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.400 
and still fun I would actually say that
being<00:02:40.890> a<00:02:40.980> zombie<00:02:41.129> on<00:02:41.430> this<00:02:41.579> map<00:02:41.790> is<00:02:42.090> funner<00:02:42.450> if

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
being a zombie on this map is funner if

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.220 
being a zombie on this map is funner if
not<00:02:43.829> just<00:02:44.129> as<00:02:44.340> fun<00:02:44.579> as<00:02:44.760> being<00:02:44.940> a<00:02:45.090> human<00:02:45.329> depends

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
not just as fun as being a human depends

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.770 
not just as fun as being a human depends
on<00:02:46.440> your<00:02:46.590> preference<00:02:47.069> as<00:02:47.280> you<00:02:48.180> can<00:02:48.299> see<00:02:48.510> here's

on your preference as you can see here's

on your preference as you can see here's
what<00:02:48.959> I<00:02:48.989> mean<00:02:49.200> about<00:02:49.379> the<00:02:49.440> zombies<00:02:49.890> traveling

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
what I mean about the zombies traveling

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.640 
what I mean about the zombies traveling
just<00:02:50.519> as<00:02:50.700> fast<00:02:50.940> as<00:02:51.180> a<00:02:51.209> warthogs<00:02:51.720> you<00:02:52.290> can<00:02:52.440> see

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
just as fast as a warthogs you can see

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.220 
just as fast as a warthogs you can see
I'm<00:02:52.859> right<00:02:53.099> on<00:02:53.370> them<00:02:53.670> hunt<00:02:54.120> and<00:02:54.329> once<00:02:54.840> you<00:02:55.049> get

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
I'm right on them hunt and once you get

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.990 
I'm right on them hunt and once you get
a<00:02:55.260> hit<00:02:55.470> on<00:02:55.500> the<00:02:55.650> Warthog<00:02:55.980> the<00:02:56.489> size<00:02:56.730> of<00:02:56.910> the

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
a hit on the Warthog the size of the

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.839 
a hit on the Warthog the size of the
truck<00:02:57.269> plus<00:02:58.230> the<00:02:58.410> actual<00:02:58.739> amount<00:02:58.950> of<00:02:59.370> damage

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
dealt by a sword hit is usually enough

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.120 
dealt by a sword hit is usually enough
to<00:03:02.370> knock<00:03:02.549> that<00:03:02.760> warthog<00:03:03.150> off<00:03:03.420> the<00:03:03.569> track<00:03:03.840> or

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
to knock that warthog off the track or

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.220 
to knock that warthog off the track or
enough<00:03:05.130> to<00:03:05.280> slow<00:03:05.489> the<00:03:05.609> vehicle<00:03:05.639> down<00:03:06.030> as<00:03:06.540> as

enough to slow the vehicle down as as
your<00:03:07.680> teammates<00:03:08.190> hone<00:03:08.489> in<00:03:08.760> on<00:03:08.940> that<00:03:09.209> location

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:09.419 
your teammates hone in on that location

your teammates hone in on that location
and<00:03:10.049> try<00:03:10.680> and<00:03:10.739> take<00:03:10.950> the<00:03:10.980> mome<00:03:11.250> so<00:03:12.180> really

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
and try and take the mome so really

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.750 
and try and take the mome so really
great<00:03:12.660> map<00:03:12.840> in<00:03:13.019> my<00:03:13.169> opinion<00:03:13.440> I'd<00:03:14.099> like<00:03:14.400> to<00:03:14.579> see

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
great map in my opinion I'd like to see

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.690 
great map in my opinion I'd like to see
a<00:03:15.090> lot<00:03:15.450> more<00:03:15.480> of<00:03:15.690> these<00:03:15.900> maps<00:03:16.169> so<00:03:17.040> as<00:03:17.340> always
