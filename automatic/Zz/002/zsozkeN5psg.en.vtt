you can probably remember that one of

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.959 
you can probably remember that one of
the<00:00:12.960> exhaust<00:00:13.349> and<00:00:13.590> bolts<00:00:13.980> was<00:00:14.130> broken<00:00:14.580> off<00:00:14.730> so

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
the exhaust and bolts was broken off so

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.490 
the exhaust and bolts was broken off so
I<00:00:15.120> was<00:00:15.330> left<00:00:15.570> with<00:00:15.929> a<00:00:15.960> stud

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
I was left with a stud

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.680 
I was left with a stud
they<00:00:17.400> stood<00:00:17.640> I<00:00:17.699> had<00:00:17.940> to<00:00:18.060> drill<00:00:18.300> out<00:00:18.449> and

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
they stood I had to drill out and

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.660 
they stood I had to drill out and
actually<00:00:19.140> retype<00:00:19.949> the<00:00:19.980> hole<00:00:20.340> and<00:00:20.930> I<00:00:22.670> fitted

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
actually retype the hole and I fitted

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.660 
actually retype the hole and I fitted
the<00:00:23.820> exhaust<00:00:24.570> much<00:00:25.289> better<00:00:25.590> with<00:00:26.039> eight<00:00:26.609> new

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
the exhaust much better with eight new

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.570 
the exhaust much better with eight new
bolts<00:00:27.210> as<00:00:27.359> you<00:00:27.480> can<00:00:27.630> see<00:00:27.810> here<00:00:28.310> and<00:00:29.310> I'll<00:00:29.550> just

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
bolts as you can see here and I'll just

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.669 
bolts as you can see here and I'll just
zoom<00:00:30.119> in<00:00:30.300> closely<00:00:30.599> so<00:00:31.019> you<00:00:31.080> can<00:00:31.289> see<00:00:31.529> it<00:00:31.619> a

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
zoom in closely so you can see it a

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.030 
zoom in closely so you can see it a
little<00:00:31.800> bit<00:00:32.009> better<00:00:32.160> what<00:00:32.850> I've<00:00:33.000> been<00:00:33.180> doing

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:34.040 
little bit better what I've been doing

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.040 
little bit better what I've been doing
I've<00:00:35.040> actually<00:00:35.309> added<00:00:35.670> eight<00:00:36.360> sleeves<00:00:36.809> in

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
I've actually added eight sleeves in

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.030 
I've actually added eight sleeves in
between<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.860> engine<00:00:38.219> and<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:39.020> exhaust

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.040 
between the engine and the exhaust

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.160 
between the engine and the exhaust
mounting<00:00:41.040> bracket<00:00:41.520> and<00:00:41.750> makes<00:00:42.750> it<00:00:42.930> a<00:00:42.960> little

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
mounting bracket and makes it a little

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.529 
mounting bracket and makes it a little
bit<00:00:43.379> more<00:00:43.620> sturdy<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:44.250> it<00:00:44.610> also<00:00:44.760> looks<00:00:45.059> much

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
bit more sturdy and it also looks much

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.549 
bit more sturdy and it also looks much
nicer<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:46.700> there<00:00:47.700> is<00:00:48.000> a<00:00:48.329> lock<00:00:49.230> washer

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
nicer and there is a lock washer

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.819 
nicer and there is a lock washer
included<00:00:50.340> and<00:00:50.520> an<00:00:51.059> end<00:00:51.270> with<00:00:51.420> nut<00:00:51.719> which<00:00:52.649> will

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
included and an end with nut which will

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.529 
included and an end with nut which will
be<00:00:52.949> getting<00:00:53.129> a<00:00:53.280> little<00:00:53.460> bit<00:00:53.670> of<00:00:53.789> Loctite<00:00:54.030> when

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
be getting a little bit of Loctite when

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.750 
be getting a little bit of Loctite when
I<00:00:54.570> install<00:00:55.559> it<00:00:55.590> on<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:55.920> engine<00:00:56.250> eventually

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
I install it on the engine eventually

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.450 
I install it on the engine eventually
I'm<00:00:57.530> thinking<00:00:58.530> about<00:00:58.649> getting<00:00:58.920> a<00:00:59.100> little<00:00:59.250> bit

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
I'm thinking about getting a little bit

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.029 
I'm thinking about getting a little bit
smaller<00:00:59.969> diameter<00:01:00.570> washer<00:01:01.079> as<00:01:01.260> these<00:01:01.710> are

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
smaller diameter washer as these are

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.840 
smaller diameter washer as these are
quite<00:01:02.370> big<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:03.710> so<00:01:04.710> I<00:01:04.739> have<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.129> look<00:01:05.460> out<00:01:05.610> for

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
quite big and so I have to look out for

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.330 
quite big and so I have to look out for
a<00:01:05.909> few<00:01:06.119> new<00:01:06.330> ones<00:01:06.770> these<00:01:07.770> are<00:01:07.830> all<00:01:08.010> hand

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
a few new ones these are all hand

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.039 
a few new ones these are all hand
tightened<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:09.060> it's<00:01:09.330> only<00:01:09.570> meant<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:09.840> give

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
tightened and it's only meant to give

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.899 
tightened and it's only meant to give
you<00:01:10.080> an<00:01:10.260> idea<00:01:10.350> what<00:01:11.130> I've<00:01:11.280> been<00:01:11.310> doing<00:01:11.760> and

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
you an idea what I've been doing and

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.539 
you an idea what I've been doing and
what<00:01:12.270> it's<00:01:12.450> looking<00:01:12.720> like<00:01:12.750> I<00:01:13.189> decided<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.430> do

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
what it's looking like I decided to do

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.380 
what it's looking like I decided to do
this<00:01:14.760> before<00:01:15.119> lapping<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.200> valves<00:01:16.970> so<00:01:17.970> now<00:01:18.119> at

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
this before lapping the valves so now at

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.450 
this before lapping the valves so now at
least<00:01:18.450> I<00:01:18.689> can<00:01:18.840> get<00:01:18.930> at<00:01:19.110> every<00:01:19.229> angle<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:20.310> make

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
least I can get at every angle and make

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.030 
least I can get at every angle and make
sure<00:01:20.700> that<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.119> exhaust<00:01:21.450> fits<00:01:21.840> tight<00:01:22.740> and

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
sure that the exhaust fits tight and

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.090 
sure that the exhaust fits tight and
snug<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:23.520> as<00:01:24.509> far<00:01:24.720> as<00:01:24.869> I<00:01:24.960> can<00:01:25.020> see<00:01:25.380> I<00:01:25.740> don't

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
snug and as far as I can see I don't

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.560 
snug and as far as I can see I don't
think<00:01:26.670> I<00:01:26.880> have<00:01:27.240> any<00:01:27.600> issues<00:01:28.560> with<00:01:28.799> leakage<00:01:29.570> it

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
think I have any issues with leakage it

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.380 
think I have any issues with leakage it
is<00:01:30.720> an<00:01:30.869> aftermarket<00:01:31.290> exhaust<00:01:31.799> as<00:01:32.790> you<00:01:33.000> can<00:01:33.180> see

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
is an aftermarket exhaust as you can see

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.190 
is an aftermarket exhaust as you can see
it<00:01:34.079> doesn't<00:01:34.290> fit<00:01:34.650> all<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.009> way<00:01:35.040> up<00:01:35.790> to<00:01:36.270> the

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
it doesn't fit all the way up to the

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.530 
it doesn't fit all the way up to the
engine<00:01:37.530> so<00:01:38.460> this<00:01:38.729> is<00:01:38.850> how<00:01:38.970> it's<00:01:39.150> going<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:39.420> be

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
engine so this is how it's going to be

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.050 
engine so this is how it's going to be
mounted<00:01:39.930> and<00:01:40.290> as<00:01:40.829> this<00:01:40.979> is<00:01:41.040> a<00:01:41.189> budget<00:01:41.520> rebuild

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
mounted and as this is a budget rebuild

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.609 
mounted and as this is a budget rebuild
I'll<00:01:42.270> have<00:01:42.450> to<00:01:42.600> do<00:01:42.720> with<00:01:42.899> this<00:01:42.990> exhaust<00:01:43.439> for

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
I'll have to do with this exhaust for

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.280 
I'll have to do with this exhaust for
the<00:01:43.740> time<00:01:43.950> being<00:01:44.689> so<00:01:45.689> that's<00:01:45.869> what<00:01:46.020> it<00:01:46.110> looks

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
the time being so that's what it looks

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.649 
the time being so that's what it looks
