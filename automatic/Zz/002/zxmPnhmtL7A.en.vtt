00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.330 
the company and so I don't know what to
think<00:03:40.690> about<00:03:40.959> this<00:03:41.110> game<00:03:41.560> stop<00:03:41.830> going<00:03:42.130> mobile

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
think about this game stop going mobile

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.190 
think about this game stop going mobile
I<00:03:42.640> mean<00:03:42.820> that's<00:03:42.970> a<00:03:43.209> little<00:03:43.420> bit<00:03:43.540> weird<00:03:43.810> for<00:03:43.900> me

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
I mean that's a little bit weird for me

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.170 
I mean that's a little bit weird for me
I<00:03:44.380> think<00:03:44.980> they<00:03:45.070> should<00:03:45.280> really<00:03:45.489> just<00:03:45.700> stick<00:03:45.970> to

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
I think they should really just stick to

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.580 
I think they should really just stick to
console<00:03:46.750> and<00:03:47.220> also<00:03:48.220> a<00:03:48.640> PC<00:03:49.269> which<00:03:49.570> what<00:03:49.989> is<00:03:50.320> what

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
console and also a PC which what is what

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.140 
console and also a PC which what is what
I<00:03:50.620> would<00:03:50.890> do<00:03:51.040> but<00:03:51.220> you<00:03:51.340> know<00:03:51.430> I'm<00:03:51.550> not<00:03:51.580> investor

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
I would do but you know I'm not investor

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.660 
I would do but you know I'm not investor
i'm<00:03:52.269> not<00:03:52.420> a<00:03:52.450> big<00:03:53.200> businessman<00:03:53.800> or<00:03:54.040> anything<00:03:54.400> so

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
i'm not a big businessman or anything so

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:55.920 
i'm not a big businessman or anything so
i<00:03:54.700> suppose<00:03:54.970> they're<00:03:55.330> doing<00:03:55.360> the<00:03:55.630> right<00:03:55.780> move

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
i suppose they're doing the right move

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.330 
i suppose they're doing the right move
but<00:03:56.140> i<00:03:56.170> don't<00:03:56.350> know<00:03:56.410> how<00:03:56.560> i<00:03:56.590> feel<00:03:56.890> about<00:03:56.950> this
