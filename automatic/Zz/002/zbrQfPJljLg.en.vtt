 of aloe vera because it is moisturizing is 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:35.820

 Well, the tissues of that generator 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.130
 mobile 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:44.370

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:00.720
 rosewood this essential oil 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.790
 we will throw very little but also good 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:07.650
 the product that we are going to make is of little 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:10.050
 amount this essential oil is one of 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.720
 the essential oils with greater power 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.130

 It also strengthens the tissues and good 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.080
 idea and regenerates what else we can 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.260
 ask 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:23.140
 the idea of ​​making this cream this 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:26.250
 eye contour came to me because I started 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:31.050
 to notice how this area here 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:33.090
 and it was like lack of more nutrition 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.610
 Well, more than I used to put on cream, it seemed like 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.560
 that part of that eye area what 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.020
 absorbed in a moment not and I thought about 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.990
 make something more nutritious something more 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.400
 specific to be for this area and 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.960
 The only thing I can tell you is that 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:50.110

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.100
 you will say something 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:00.140
 I'm going to take this little pot 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.890
 tiny 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:06.920
 and clean of course disinfected and 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.789
 we are going to put half a half tablespoon 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.970
 teaspoon of coffee 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:17.090

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:22.880
 half a teaspoon of looking for another 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:27.230
 utensil why not 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:30.290
 there was no way to leave it there with the 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.110
 same spoon we are going to put a 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.610
 spoonful of 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:38.920
 of aloe vera 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:42.630
 as you can see the nationals bought 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:46.140
 but hey, he is not going to throw it, I have it there 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:48.000
 with which the part that is 100% natural is 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.720
 corresponds to the loe because the rest 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.370
 well for many congratulations and good 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:58.370
 but that's what I was saying, I'm not going to 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.370
 throw I have to give it a use and now 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.690
 with this mixture here already made 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.410
 in the spoon I still have one 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.410
 little bit so 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:12.300
 with this mixture 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.200
 we should heat it so that the 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:21.630
 shea butter we're leaving 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:25.280
 undoing as in a container 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:29.630
 a little bit big to put this 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:31.910
 more than big width or with the same 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:34.910
 body heat that if we throw ourselves a 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:36.140
 I am here today or taking advantage of what I have 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:38.430
 it's winter here I have the 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:41.129
 heating on 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:44.129
 I put it there on the radiator for a while and 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:46.740
 now I will pick it up and continue as 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:48.930
 I told him 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:52.950
 the gel is bought but I'm not going to 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:56.040
 throw and how you throw things 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:58.800
 practically whole and good and the 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:01.110
 container as you can see it is reusable 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:04.120
 so to do another of our 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:06.060
 creams will go very well so 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.690
 whatever 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.310
 They have already spent a little while 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:13.450
 Y 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:16.180
 we mix it well 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:18.940
 and we are going to add that drop of oil 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.769
 essential one drop only he 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.600
 essential oils are sold in 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:25.660
 little flasks because they are very 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:27.940
 powerful so you do not have to abuse 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:31.180
 them that is not going to make us more effect 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:34.470
 well then we mix everything well 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.470
 and we have done it 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:42.260
 how is it applied 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:45.320
 we take better finger we put a 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:48.220
 small amount and then nothing we 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:50.690
 let's apply by the eye area 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:53.990
 Well, I do not see much, so I'm going 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:56.430
 a little well - to - eye 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.170
 It can be done both in the morning 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.330
 like at night 

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:02.940
 it gets fatty so you can apply the 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:05.610
 make up quietly then the night 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:09.510
 Well, to the best of the best results 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:14.340
 with him with clean skin without makeup 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:17.850
 and if we go to sleep with this we do not 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:19.770
 You will perform better but know that 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:22.260
 you can apply for both 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:24.310
 good ways I do it for the 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:27.720
 morning and evening 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:30.370
 tell you that with few applications 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:32.170
 you will notice the results will improve them 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:35.580
 very much this area here we would do it 

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:39.310
 well with soft little touches 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:41.620
 so that the skin absorbs it better 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:43.729
 with few applications what are we going to 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:45.919
 notice 

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:48.559
 Well, that's why I'm happy 

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:51.409
 said that with few applications is that 

00:05:48.559 --> 00:05:54.289
 I started to notice the effects that you are going to 

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:58.430
 note then you will notice in this area more 

00:05:54.289 --> 00:06:01.889
 nutrition the child stays so we 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:06.060
 new wrinkles will appear 

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:10.590
 you see or you will see how the wrinkles go 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:13.249
 attenuating and even also the bags 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:15.689
 will be favored as the effect 

00:06:13.249 --> 00:06:17.729
 anti-inflammatory that has aloe gel 

00:06:15.689 --> 00:06:22.259
 vera 

00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:24.059
 so tell you to do first one 

00:06:22.259 --> 00:06:26.789
 little test will not be that you have 

00:06:24.059 --> 00:06:29.699
 allergy to any of these products 

00:06:26.789 --> 00:06:32.099
 we want to avoid the effects that are 

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:34.259
 harmful to us thus perform 

00:06:32.099 --> 00:06:36.270
 in a small area of your skin by 

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:38.699
 example is one that is more sensitive a 

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:40.439
 Allergy sensitivity test and if 

00:06:38.699 --> 00:06:43.050
 all goes well and can therefore start 

00:06:40.439 --> 00:06:46.259
