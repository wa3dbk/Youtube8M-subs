00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:09.099
 I am dry airbrushing this is part of 

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:12.820
 my work my workshop where 

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:12.820
 and creations 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.869
 two 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:33.670
 since I was a child I always liked to draw 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.059
 together much in comics rubÃ©n workshops of 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.059
 comic 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.550
 I was also dabbling for many years 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:42.070
 in the graffiti until today I 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.640
 graffiti 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.829
 and it was in that attempt to seek improvement 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.190
 of 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.190
 of my designs 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:55.370
 I knew airbrushing what I liked 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:57.530
 of airbrushing was basically the 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:01.079
 fact of being able to get to the detail more 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:06.170
 more realistic thin 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.170
 to be able to highlight fine things 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.500
 in details such as the brightness of the eyes 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:16.040
 all these things have a great influence on a 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.650
 paint that can not be done with the 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:21.400
 another technician 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:29.190
 will come to details that can make a 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:29.190
 drawing picture of pencils 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.220
 when I started having my first 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:47.610
 geography I started to notice has been the 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:47.610
 quality of the designs that has changed 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:53.340
 and I started doing my first jobs 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:55.859
 first as a hobby 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.659
 making him design a friend his 

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:59.909
 vehicles 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.549
 shortly after doing my first 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:05.969
 airbrushing people started liking 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:08.310
 the quality of work the realism what 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.629
 that everything is there and so I 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.940
 they started calling some 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.120
 unforeseen with some people to 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.690
 do 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:20.350
 this is work and I liked very much the 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.880
 reality and after one year 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:23.800
 I realized that it was much more 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:27.200
 profitable work on what I most 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.879
 I liked it but I wrote and 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.700
 I chose the previous work in which 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:34.910
 I was to dedicate myself to this in time 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:37.250
 complete is usually a hobby to do my 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:40.629
 I work one of the virtues of 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.629
 airbrushing is that 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.730
 it can not only be painted from 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.870
 vehicle can not only be applied 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:51.150
 in the motor area too 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.980
 you can visit murals you can 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:57.280
 apply to different types of surfaces 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:03:00.220
 and plastic woods 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.069
 etcetera clothes did not have five hundred 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.370
 T-shirt 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:04.370
 how 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.430
 as well 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:15.569
 and I've had to visit those portraits 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:18.650
 children's gardens leather jackets 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:22.110
 not really 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.820
 supposed notebooks refrigerators in 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.250
 reality can be removed from everything with the 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:28.070
 reverse 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:31.010
 it is enough to know how to prepare the surface 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:32.430
 so every time the virtue is to make a 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.840
 work 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:39.280
 that is pleasing to the client of the magazines 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:41.530
 I enjoy what I do I like 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:45.940
 I love it is like being on vacation 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:47.350
 still live what one would 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.570
 like 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.160
 when a job leaves here when 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:54.310
 Someone without doubt you have 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:56.910
 automobile or a vehicle in as part of 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.910
 a job 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:05.159
 is to have the vehicle and when one is 

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:05.159
 working on it 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:11.500
 surrendering the whole soul the heart 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:14.460
 no drawings and when they go like 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.460
 part of themselves 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:22.810
 I thank God for this talent 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:25.000
 that he put in me I'm always doing what 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.030
 possible to deliver a job of 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.310
 excellence 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:34.430
 maybe I can be happy with 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:34.430
 what I did and obviously everything 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:40.280
 as one of my jobs with as in 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:43.340
 of the anecdotes 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:47.000
 good almost always happens because people 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:50.720
 he leaves here satisfied with the 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:53.200
 jobs and they shake my hand 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.200
 I am
