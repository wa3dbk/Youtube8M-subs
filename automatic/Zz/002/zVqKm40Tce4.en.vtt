00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
worst 8-bit should ever be crapped on a

worst 8-bit should ever be crapped on a
console<00:00:36.300> I<00:00:36.570> would<00:00:37.230> venture<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.590> say<00:00:37.710> that

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
console I would venture to say that

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.080 
console I would venture to say that
people<00:00:38.340> who<00:00:38.489> bought<00:00:38.700> it<00:00:38.820> back<00:00:38.910> in

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
people who bought it back in

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.000 
people who bought it back in
eighty-eight<00:00:39.329> were<00:00:39.600> thinking<00:00:39.930> what<00:00:40.710> could<00:00:40.890> be

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
eighty-eight were thinking what could be

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.860 
eighty-eight were thinking what could be
better<00:00:41.160> than<00:00:41.309> chaos<00:00:41.940> but<00:00:42.239> chaos<00:00:42.600> with<00:00:42.840> a

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
better than chaos but chaos with a

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.319 
better than chaos but chaos with a
doctorate<00:00:43.290> I<00:00:43.559> mean<00:00:43.829> professor<00:00:44.489> chaos<00:00:44.820> is<00:00:45.120> cool

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
doctorate I mean professor chaos is cool

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.090 
doctorate I mean professor chaos is cool
but<00:00:45.570> dr.<00:00:45.899> chaos<00:00:46.200> didn't<00:00:46.530> limit<00:00:46.680> himself<00:00:46.860> to

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
but dr. chaos didn't limit himself to

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.580 
but dr. chaos didn't limit himself to
academia<00:00:47.670> he<00:00:48.180> went<00:00:48.390> for<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.539> brass<00:00:48.719> ring<00:00:48.750> dr.

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
academia he went for the brass ring dr.

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.040 
academia he went for the brass ring dr.
chaos<00:00:49.980> went<00:00:50.309> pro<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:51.149> story<00:00:51.420> goes<00:00:51.600> like<00:00:51.690> this

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
chaos went pro the story goes like this

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.080 
chaos went pro the story goes like this
you're<00:00:52.440> Michael<00:00:52.890> chaos<00:00:53.219> brother<00:00:53.610> of<00:00:53.789> a<00:00:53.850> crazy

crazy<00:00:57.480> physics<00:00:57.930> is<00:00:58.020> a<00:00:58.050> plausible<00:00:58.379> thing<00:00:58.800> right

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
crazy physics is a plausible thing right

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.970 
crazy physics is a plausible thing right
that's<00:01:00.030> about<00:01:00.210> where<00:01:00.420> plausibility<00:01:00.870> stops<00:01:01.350> it

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
that's about where plausibility stops it

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.500 
that's about where plausibility stops it

seems that dr. jin chaos has been
experimenting<00:01:04.199> with<00:01:04.229> warp<00:01:04.559> zones<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:04.979> is<00:01:05.100> now

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
experimenting with warp zones and is now

can understand in these older games
there<00:03:17.209> was<00:03:17.299> only<00:03:17.390> so<00:03:17.660> much<00:03:17.750> space<00:03:17.810> to<00:03:18.110> put

there was only so much space to put

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.020 
there was only so much space to put
gameplay<00:03:18.829> and<00:03:18.980> instructions<00:03:19.489> so<00:03:19.610> developers

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
gameplay and instructions so developers

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:21.670 
gameplay and instructions so developers
tended<00:03:20.360> to<00:03:20.450> put<00:03:20.600> the<00:03:20.690> how<00:03:20.810> to's<00:03:21.049> in<00:03:21.260> the<00:03:21.350> manual

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680
