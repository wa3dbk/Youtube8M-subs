00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:07.519
 I am sam in this video we are going to watch 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:10.730
 to the lenovo thinkpad tablet 2 is one 

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:13.730
 10.1 inch windows 8 tablet can logo 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.719
 the tank with line and therefore a business one 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.570
 of which the fall focused on the business 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:20.090
 market tablet well 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.340
 the tank was having two runs on one 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:25.040
 intel atom processor 1.5 ie driven 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.110
 speed 2 gigabytes of ram memory 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.970
 it is available in 32 and 64 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.710
 gigabyte storage memory in 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.960
 Netherlands actually mainly but 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.810
 64 gigabytes 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.150
 optional 3g and is on for example 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:40.400
 inside is a file spent works 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.440
 and it is available in combination with 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.120
 a keyboard it also that you have to release 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.579
 purchase 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.650
 good if we first take a look at 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:50.930
 some connection and things like that 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:53.720
 we see in terms of design that it is a whole 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.310
 modest device is a soft touch 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.100
 finds the finish on the plastic 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:00.200
 back but it feels very solid 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.180
 on and on the left there is a kind 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:05.149
 rounding because deep and incorporated into it 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.079
 is therefore very comfortable in the 

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:07.969
 hand 

00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:11.780
 must be on and off at the top 

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:14.030
 button and a flap behind which the 3g 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.829
 connection can be made over no 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.840
 do you need to insert my sim holes 

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:20.119
 left so deep and deep work is in it 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.909
 the housing that is stylus and attached to the 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:25.609
 left side on the side is a flap 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:28.219
 behind which a usb 2 point 0 works 

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:30.619
 sit and place where your moon can charge that 

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:32.329
 is micro usb so that's handy if you 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:34.310
 can have all kinds of cables that can go anywhere 

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:36.079
 find use for this at the 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.170
 bottom is a dock connector and one 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:40.999
 mini HDMI port which can be connected by connector 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.439
 you use with a desktop accessory 

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:44.270
 so you have more ports for example 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:46.099
 available and the right side 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.319
 then still have an on-off volume button 

00:01:46.099 --> 00:01:51.170
 buttons and a place to put your headphones in 

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:54.740
 at the front there is a 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:56.630
 ambient light sensor and a webcam and 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.179
 there is an 8 megapixel on the back 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.229
 camera with a lad place and sit there 

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:03.469
 two 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:05.719
 slots a in the housing for the 

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:08.209
 speakers now allow the sound to run wild 

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:10.939
 let the neck looking at the loose 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:13.760
 to purchase keyboard dock this is 

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:14.610
 a keyboard that cannot connect 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.090
 say it 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.680
 can make wax on the tablet itself 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.090
 open the cover and then you can take the tablet 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.950
 put in it 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.390
 but it is not very solid that he 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.310
 click far not fixed is not 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.260
 held magnetically in place 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.210
 but with a little policy it is too 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.920
 use for example on your lap or whatever 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.170
 but also during the floor we have 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.850
 so really about two separate parts 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.320
 de novo sales do have a sleeve true 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.240
 all we can do but in principle 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.560
 this would simply be in every 11 inch sleeve 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.980
 fit those two parts 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.450
 great together suddenly suddenly it must be sweet 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.740
 keyboard is a typical my grandfather 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.040
 keyboard 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:51.750
 there are very fine it is 10.1 inches and so 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.300
 those keys are kept a bit small but 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.850
 this is the best for me 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.380
 1.1 iens keyboard experience that you can 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:01.500
 have an oven is just known for 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.880
 about fine keyboards and that's here 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.040
 not otherwise all 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.980
 loose desserts and good pressing far 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.260
 have enough resistance say 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.720
 to make it almost typing experience 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.820
 of course, the top row is provided 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.880
 of the function keys if you have a hard one 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:20.250
 soft volume brightness a search function 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.140
 and there is a numeric row and on the 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.430
 up there now just below it 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.690
 perhaps the most interesting 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.880
 is that your pill 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.380
 we usually know it among those 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.549
 term but the present of course one 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.350
 track point 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:34.110
 is known from de novo this is the way 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:35.580
 which you can control the mouse that is 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.620
 something you have to get used to and like 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.239
 you're not really used to burning 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.920
 lenovo devices that 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.840
 of working with their thing yes then it takes 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.489
 it would be for a while but in principle I would 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.530
 some people seem familiar 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:49.200
 the corresponding mouse button machine on the 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.450
 bottom for the space bar 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.739
 so we have the left mouse button 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:55.680
 right mouse button and the button you press 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:57.239
 must hold if you want to scroll and the 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.310
 rest of the typing experience is just 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:01.200
 just totally fine especially when you get there 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.640
 a bit used to it and are those too 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.510
 buttons on the front for the 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.870
 mouse button we know 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:10.980
 yes to avoid bypassing the 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:12.540
 connection is via bluetooth and charging 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.120
 of the keyboard also goes through 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.820
 micro-usb but in the keyboard itself 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:20.130
 so there is no battery on whatever that what 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:23.099
 acid or we pass on energy to the 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:25.800
 tablet itself or thing cap that runs on 

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:27.700
 windows 8 on the full version that 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.050
 microsoft or again that inter 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.030
 a processor year that makes it 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.700
 of course possible but that is not one 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:35.260
 professor which is the high-speed may be in the 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.330
 desktop environment was once the sea nele 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.880
 Install software ball and one takes 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:41.050
 it a little longer before it is opened 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.880
 I think this is for business 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:45.100
 use those company specific apps 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.260
 they have to use more than 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:50.050
 fast enough but really for the 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:51.790
 photoshoppers and that is it 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.690
 not convenient and also all star deep and 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:54.010
 perhaps 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.050
 gives you the impression that it is really one 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:58.030
 perfect drawing tablet on what is needed 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.250
 I think that pander is much more over 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.990
 just the right one in the desktop environment 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.910
 provide control over that 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.530
 handwritten or level specific 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:07.690
 written apps when it comes to 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:09.580
 input fields and things like that 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:10.810
 then deep and very handy with what net 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.090
 some more control 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:16.960
 because as a drawing tablet it is not fast 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:18.610
 enough and is actually the craft 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.410
 not sensitive enough though my voice that 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:22.120
 some pressure points 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:24.400
 being in the modern environment know him 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.960
 naturally have the tiles and all apps 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.670
 you can use them for e-mail 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.290
 internet browser and all that stuff 

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:32.230
 and you can install apps from the 

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:34.720
 microsoft store or became the windows store 

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:36.760
 well that is well known meanwhile 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:37.480
 range of apps is reasonable but for the 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:39.670
 most new 

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:42.370
 hippest and coolest apps have to go 

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:43.930
 Android we are gone at the moment 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:44.890
 and also does not deliver too many apps for 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:47.530
 with it 

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:49.810
 skitch evernote and what will be 

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:51.430
 institutions apps and smokers 

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:53.140
 donated norton antivirus 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:54.670
 2 which of course always just bundle up 

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:56.080
 it's just okay 

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:58.420
 if you need that, then it is 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:01.450
 for all those settings to be apps 

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:03.190
 therefore funny to briefly run through the 

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:04.840
 because you can set things up so that if 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:06.940
 you are at home that knows your location 

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:08.140
 of GPS is that thing and that then 

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:10.060
 another one 

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:11.830
 anne type of institutions uses banks 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:13.810
 office that he has a VPN connection 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:15.400
 explains or vice versa and things like that and 

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:17.530
 in principle it is just completely there 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:20.380
 perfect for the sound that the 

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:22.600
 Speakers is fairly can free 

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:24.220
 get high volume only forms one 

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:26.470
 little bit at the time i played there 

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:29.530
 condition and the sound a little kids 

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:31.260
 with all other cavity choices 

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:33.750
 to the camera 

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:35.430
 yes the camera they came to the 

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:36.690
 I okay in the front of the room 

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:39.120
 rear end 

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:42.270
 You can make a good project environment reasonable 

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:43.470
 take pictures and take that one 

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:46.920
 little to help is there even now lod 

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:48.480
 flash so that we are in a few situations too 

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:52.380
 that can be used for that 

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:53.610
 coat mary-kate are so often took the 

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:55.560
 battery life 

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:57.570
 goes if you just use it how word 

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:59.910
 you a little good gmail and i say that 

00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:01.590
 but as a road warrior on the road he measured 

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:03.600
 youtube 9 with it and that's it 

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:04.830
 cable as just right for a windows 

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:06.030
 8 tablet 

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:08.010
 and if you put something in the receiver one 

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:09.630
 Task also does go here now to 7 

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:11.220
 and 

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:13.440
 and that is actually all i want 

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:15.720
 say about them about thinkpad tablet 2 

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:19.440
 it is a tablet that is very solid 

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:22.230
 nice and thin nice is good in the hand 

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:24.060
 fits well in the hand but for windows 8
