00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:26.539 
particular college was very keen on

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:29.779 
particular college was very keen on
drawing<00:00:27.539> hand<00:00:27.960> draftsmanship<00:00:28.769> and<00:00:29.340> so<00:00:29.550> we

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
drawing hand draftsmanship and so we

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.759 
drawing hand draftsmanship and so we
were<00:00:29.939> all<00:00:30.119> encouraged<00:00:30.810> to<00:00:31.109> do<00:00:31.289> it<00:00:31.439> all<00:00:31.740> the

were all encouraged to do it all the
time<00:00:32.780> when<00:00:33.780> in<00:00:34.170> sketchbooks<00:00:34.980> home<00:00:35.280> backs<00:00:36.120> of

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
time when in sketchbooks home backs of

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.549 
time when in sketchbooks home backs of
envelopes<00:00:36.870> or<00:00:37.260> whore<00:00:37.649> anywhere<00:00:38.219> and<00:00:39.140> I've<00:00:40.140> got

envelopes or whore anywhere and I've got

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.970 
envelopes or whore anywhere and I've got
three<00:00:41.129> bits<00:00:41.700> of<00:00:42.000> my<00:00:42.239> heart<00:00:42.600> that<00:00:42.899> I<00:00:42.930> did<00:00:43.410> one<00:00:43.680> I

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
three bits of my heart that I did one I

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.690 
three bits of my heart that I did one I
was<00:00:44.219> there<00:00:44.460> to<00:00:44.700> show<00:00:44.910> you<00:00:46.340> well<00:00:47.340> obviously

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
was there to show you well obviously

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.360 
was there to show you well obviously
this<00:00:48.450> isn't<00:00:48.870> meant<00:00:49.050> to<00:00:49.110> be<00:00:49.379> a<00:00:49.410> masterpiece<00:00:49.980> but

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
this isn't meant to be a masterpiece but

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.910 
this isn't meant to be a masterpiece but
just<00:00:50.640> an<00:00:50.789> example<00:00:51.180> of<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.870> sort<00:00:52.350> of<00:00:52.469> thing<00:00:52.710> one

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
just an example of the sort of thing one

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.290 
just an example of the sort of thing one
would<00:00:53.160> do<00:00:53.510> on<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.870> back<00:00:55.079> of<00:00:55.289> an<00:00:55.410> envelope<00:00:55.530> and

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
would do on the back of an envelope and

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.790 
would do on the back of an envelope and
a<00:00:57.559> daisy

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
a daisy

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.400 
a daisy
it<00:00:59.460> is<00:00:59.640> a<00:00:59.670> sketch<00:01:00.090> of<00:01:00.120> Thomas<00:01:00.780> Hardy<00:01:01.230> and

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
it is a sketch of Thomas Hardy and

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.290 
it is a sketch of Thomas Hardy and
obviously<00:01:01.890> at<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.219> time<00:01:02.430> I<00:01:02.489> was<00:01:02.879> interested

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
obviously at the time I was interested

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.480 
obviously at the time I was interested
in<00:01:03.690> poets<00:01:04.339> so<00:01:05.339> when<00:01:06.560> that's<00:01:07.560> just<00:01:07.860> the

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
in poets so when that's just the

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:16.920 
in poets so when that's just the
indication<00:01:09.420> of<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:10.549> thing<00:01:11.549> that<00:01:11.580> we<00:01:11.970> did

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.800 

the<00:01:17.350> next<00:01:17.710> one<00:01:17.950> again<00:01:18.430> is<00:01:18.730> of<00:01:18.940> a<00:01:19.090> poet<00:01:19.540> so

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
the next one again is of a poet so

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.680 
the next one again is of a poet so
probably<00:01:20.350> at<00:01:20.590> the<00:01:20.710> time<00:01:20.980> I<00:01:21.220> was<00:01:21.520> well<00:01:22.390> I<00:01:22.420> am

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:22.690 
probably at the time I was well I am

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.680 
probably at the time I was well I am
interested<00:01:22.900> in<00:01:23.500> poets<00:01:23.980> and<00:01:24.190> poetry<00:01:24.730> so<00:01:25.360> I

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:25.690 
interested in poets and poetry so I

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.200 
interested in poets and poetry so I
might<00:01:26.500> have<00:01:26.680> done<00:01:26.830> a<00:01:26.890> whole<00:01:27.160> series<00:01:27.220> of<00:01:27.880> them<00:01:28.090> I

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
might have done a whole series of them I

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.330 
might have done a whole series of them I
don't<00:01:28.450> know<00:01:28.660> but<00:01:28.930> the<00:01:29.350> next<00:01:29.680> one<00:01:29.890> is<00:01:30.160> an

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
don't know but the next one is an

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.970 
don't know but the next one is an
etching<00:01:30.790> and<00:01:30.970> it<00:01:31.180> was<00:01:31.420> in<00:01:32.230> the<00:01:32.470> area<00:01:32.890> of

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:32.980 
etching and it was in the area of

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:38.780 
etching and it was in the area of
printmaking<00:01:33.730> that<00:01:34.120> I<00:01:34.150> became<00:01:34.770> particularly

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.500 

encouraged<00:01:39.790> and<00:01:41.280> and<00:01:42.280> particularly<00:01:43.180> in<00:01:43.330> the

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:43.510 
encouraged and and particularly in the

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:45.990 
encouraged and and particularly in the
field<00:01:43.780> of<00:01:43.960> etching<00:01:44.440> I<00:01:44.620> don't<00:01:45.190> really<00:01:45.460> know<00:01:45.760> why

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
field of etching I don't really know why

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.690 
field of etching I don't really know why
I<00:01:46.330> I<00:01:46.750> think<00:01:47.080> it<00:01:47.530> was<00:01:47.710> because<00:01:48.190> of<00:01:48.520> the

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
I I think it was because of the

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.350 
I I think it was because of the
mechanics<00:01:49.360> are<00:01:49.600> better<00:01:49.810> mechanical<00:01:51.360> tools

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
mechanics are better mechanical tools

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.230 
mechanics are better mechanical tools
that<00:01:52.840> you<00:01:52.990> use<00:01:53.320> than<00:01:53.740> the<00:01:54.000> polishing<00:01:55.000> of<00:01:55.119> the

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
that you use than the polishing of the

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.690 
that you use than the polishing of the
copper<00:01:55.510> plate<00:01:55.960> and<00:01:56.530> the<00:01:56.650> drawing<00:01:57.190> into<00:01:57.550> the

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
copper plate and the drawing into the

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.930 
copper plate and the drawing into the
wax<00:01:57.940> before<00:01:58.360> we<00:01:58.690> put<00:01:59.020> it<00:01:59.170> into<00:01:59.350> the<00:01:59.560> acid<00:02:00.070> to

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:00.940 
wax before we put it into the acid to

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.450 
wax before we put it into the acid to
burn<00:02:01.270> the<00:02:01.690> line<00:02:01.869> into<00:02:02.530> the<00:02:02.560> plate<00:02:02.979> and<00:02:03.310> then

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
burn the line into the plate and then

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.150 
burn the line into the plate and then
the<00:02:03.610> inking<00:02:04.030> of<00:02:04.150> the<00:02:04.300> plate<00:02:04.570> and<00:02:04.900> the<00:02:05.160> printing

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:06.160 
the inking of the plate and the printing

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.590 
the inking of the plate and the printing
and<00:02:06.369> you<00:02:06.400> didn't<00:02:06.820> know<00:02:06.970> what<00:02:07.119> you<00:02:07.330> were<00:02:07.420> going

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
and you didn't know what you were going

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.109 
and you didn't know what you were going
to<00:02:07.720> get<00:02:07.990> until<00:02:08.260> you<00:02:08.679> actually<00:02:09.040> drawn<00:02:09.580> a<00:02:09.760> print

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
to get until you actually drawn a print

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.490 
to get until you actually drawn a print
so<00:02:10.840> this<00:02:11.530> one<00:02:11.830> again<00:02:12.310> is<00:02:12.640> of<00:02:12.850> a<00:02:13.030> poet<00:02:13.480> and<00:02:13.780> this

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
so this one again is of a poet and this

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:22.199 
so this one again is of a poet and this
time<00:02:14.830> it<00:02:15.190> is<00:02:15.430> WH<00:02:16.209> Auden<00:02:18.180> this<00:02:19.180> is<00:02:19.450> a<00:02:21.209> technique

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
time it is WH Auden this is a technique

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:25.020 
time it is WH Auden this is a technique
of<00:02:22.510> both<00:02:23.170> the<00:02:23.350> line<00:02:23.500> as<00:02:24.070> you<00:02:24.280> draw<00:02:24.519> through<00:02:24.880> the

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
of both the line as you draw through the

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.259 
of both the line as you draw through the
wax<00:02:25.239> on<00:02:25.540> the<00:02:25.720> plate<00:02:25.989> and<00:02:26.320> a<00:02:26.590> technique<00:02:27.160> called

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269
