00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:35.860 
fell into there and fall all the way
down<00:06:34.400> into<00:06:34.700> a<00:06:34.820> hopper<00:06:35.030> people<00:06:35.660> actually

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:35.870 
down into a hopper people actually

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:37.000 
down into a hopper people actually
thought<00:06:35.960> it<00:06:36.020> was<00:06:36.140> a<00:06:36.200> trap<00:06:36.440> on<00:06:36.470> my<00:06:36.620> plot<00:06:36.860> that

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:37.010 
thought it was a trap on my plot that

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:38.170 
thought it was a trap on my plot that
you'd<00:06:37.130> walk<00:06:37.310> into<00:06:37.520> the<00:06:37.580> water<00:06:37.760> and<00:06:37.910> then<00:06:38.000> die

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:38.180 
you'd walk into the water and then die

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:40.210 
you'd walk into the water and then die
in<00:06:38.390> the<00:06:38.540> hopper<00:06:39.290> but<00:06:39.440> now<00:06:39.620> that's<00:06:39.860> not<00:06:40.040> what<00:06:40.160> I

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:40.220 
in the hopper but now that's not what I

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:42.520 
in the hopper but now that's not what I
did<00:06:40.370> and<00:06:40.610> yet<00:06:41.030> see<00:06:41.450> keep<00:06:41.840> going<00:06:42.080> up<00:06:42.170> I<00:06:42.260> think<00:06:42.470> it

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:42.530 
did and yet see keep going up I think it

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:44.860 
did and yet see keep going up I think it
goes<00:06:42.620> up<00:06:42.770> like<00:06:42.890> six<00:06:43.250> floors<00:06:43.730> or<00:06:43.940> so<00:06:44.090> six

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:44.870 
goes up like six floors or so six

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:50.230 
goes up like six floors or so six
penalties<00:06:45.320> number<00:06:46.540> 34<00:06:47.540> I<00:06:48.200> think<00:06:49.190> that's<00:06:49.310> 56<00:06:49.700> I

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:50.240 
penalties number 34 I think that's 56 I

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.000 
penalties number 34 I think that's 56 I
think<00:06:50.420> seven<00:06:50.690> floors<00:06:51.020> and<00:06:51.350> eight<00:06:51.530> is<00:06:51.710> supposed

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:52.010 
think seven floors and eight is supposed

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:54.640 
think seven floors and eight is supposed
to<00:06:52.100> be<00:06:52.190> eight<00:06:52.310> but<00:06:53.180> I<00:06:53.300> guess<00:06:53.480> we<00:06:54.140> get<00:06:54.200> to<00:06:54.290> update

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:54.650 
to be eight but I guess we get to update

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:57.490 
to be eight but I guess we get to update
that<00:06:54.680> so<00:06:55.160> here<00:06:55.280> we<00:06:55.340> go<00:06:56.260> yeah<00:06:57.260> it's<00:06:57.440> exactly

00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:57.500 
that so here we go yeah it's exactly

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.800 
that so here we go yeah it's exactly
eight<00:06:57.920> floors<00:06:58.280> and<00:06:58.610> altogether<00:06:59.240> if<00:06:59.480> I<00:06:59.540> put<00:06:59.720> the

00:06:59.800 --> 00:06:59.810 
eight floors and altogether if I put the

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:01.390 
eight floors and altogether if I put the
other<00:06:59.960> one<00:07:00.020> back<00:07:00.260> together<00:07:00.560> and<00:07:01.130> I<00:07:01.220> don't<00:07:01.340> know
