thing we've got that broken down on like

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.120 
thing we've got that broken down on like
an<00:05:14.550> Excel<00:05:14.880> spreadsheet<00:05:15.410> and<00:05:16.410> we<00:05:16.590> started<00:05:17.010> with

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.130 
an Excel spreadsheet and we started with

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:18.560 
an Excel spreadsheet and we started with
the<00:05:17.220> best<00:05:17.400> quality<00:05:17.610> we<00:05:18.090> started<00:05:18.390> with<00:05:18.479> the

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:18.570 
the best quality we started with the

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:20.090 
the best quality we started with the
best<00:05:18.690> quality<00:05:18.900> followed<00:05:19.650> by<00:05:19.770> the<00:05:19.830> best

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:20.100 
best quality followed by the best

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:24.140 
best quality followed by the best
performance<00:05:20.669> followed<00:05:21.660> by<00:05:22.729> you<00:05:23.729> know<00:05:23.850> best

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150 
performance followed by you know best

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:27.230 
performance followed by you know best
performance<00:05:24.720> and<00:05:24.870> substandard<00:05:25.740> quality<00:05:26.240> and

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 
performance and substandard quality and

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.570 
performance and substandard quality and
we<00:05:27.540> started<00:05:27.840> burning<00:05:28.110> DVDs<00:05:28.290> of<00:05:28.770> everything<00:05:29.250> so

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:29.580 
we started burning DVDs of everything so

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.490 
we started burning DVDs of everything so
that<00:05:29.880> because<00:05:30.300> a<00:05:30.330> videotape<00:05:31.080> will<00:05:31.200> start<00:05:31.410> to

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:31.500 
that because a videotape will start to

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.490 
that because a videotape will start to
deteriorate<00:05:31.800> pretty<00:05:32.280> quickly<00:05:32.520> you<00:05:33.000> know<00:05:33.500> ten
