00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.350 

I'll<00:00:07.290> show<00:00:07.560> you<00:00:07.620> the<00:00:07.919> measuring<00:00:08.460> process<00:00:08.730> you

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
I'll show you the measuring process you

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.650 
I'll show you the measuring process you
put<00:00:09.630> your<00:00:09.810> tool<00:00:10.140> in<00:00:10.770> the<00:00:11.040> spindle<00:00:11.280> and<00:00:11.940> now<00:00:12.270> we

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
put your tool in the spindle and now we

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.290 
put your tool in the spindle and now we
work<00:00:12.870> with<00:00:13.080> three<00:00:13.620> very<00:00:14.040> simple<00:00:14.580> steps<00:00:15.060> which

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:15.300 
work with three very simple steps which

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.410 
work with three very simple steps which
anybody<00:00:15.600> can<00:00:15.840> do<00:00:16.199> step<00:00:16.950> one<00:00:17.160> we<00:00:17.730> move<00:00:17.940> the

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
anybody can do step one we move the

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.540 
anybody can do step one we move the
camera<00:00:18.810> towards<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:19.380> cutting<00:00:19.740> edge<00:00:19.890> so<00:00:20.400> the

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
camera towards the cutting edge so the

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.820 
camera towards the cutting edge so the
cutting<00:00:20.910> edge<00:00:21.030> gets<00:00:21.330> detected<00:00:21.750> on<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:22.440> screen

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
cutting edge gets detected on the screen

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.590 
cutting edge gets detected on the screen
and<00:00:23.420> now<00:00:24.420> you<00:00:24.480> see<00:00:24.810> a<00:00:24.840> dynamic<00:00:25.190> crosshair

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:26.600 
and now you see a dynamic crosshair

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.510 
and now you see a dynamic crosshair
always<00:00:27.600> detecting<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.530> highest<00:00:28.890> point<00:00:29.250> of

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:29.520 
always detecting the highest point of

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.029 
always detecting the highest point of
the<00:00:30.510> cutting<00:00:30.869> edge<00:00:31.020> no<00:00:31.380> matter<00:00:31.619> where<00:00:31.920> the

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
cutting edge appears on the screen what

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.739 
cutting edge appears on the screen what
you<00:00:37.379> see<00:00:37.710> here<00:00:38.069> is<00:00:38.249> the<00:00:38.789> fully<00:00:38.999> automatic

a<00:00:48.780> unique<00:00:49.260> feature<00:00:49.829> you<00:00:50.219> get<00:00:50.399> this<00:00:50.579> from<00:00:51.149> solar

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
a unique feature you get this from solar

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.610 
a unique feature you get this from solar
only<00:00:52.219> step<00:00:53.219> two<00:00:53.460> we<00:00:54.179> focus<00:00:54.659> the<00:00:54.690> tool<00:00:55.079> we<00:00:55.469> want

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
only step two we focus the tool we want

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.309 
only step two we focus the tool we want
to<00:00:55.889> measure<00:00:56.609> the<00:00:56.879> highest<00:00:57.269> point<00:00:57.629> of<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:57.960> tool

00:00:58.309 --> 00:00:58.319 
to measure the highest point of the tool

00:00:58.319 --> 00:01:01.879 
to measure the highest point of the tool
this<00:00:59.219> focusing<00:01:00.089> display<00:01:00.539> helps<00:01:01.289> me<00:01:01.589> doing

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:01.889 
this focusing display helps me doing

00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:03.649 
this focusing display helps me doing
this<00:01:02.039> it<00:01:02.249> works<00:01:02.429> very<00:01:02.699> simple<00:01:03.120> like<00:01:03.269> a<00:01:03.299> traffic

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:03.659 
this it works very simple like a traffic

three<00:01:13.350> we<00:01:13.860> push<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.579> caliper<00:01:15.060> button<00:01:15.390> and

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 
three we push the caliper button and

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.520 
three we push the caliper button and
here<00:01:16.680> comes<00:01:16.890> another<00:01:17.070> highlight<00:01:17.789> from<00:01:18.060> solar

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530
