wide stance the curvature of the arch

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.020 
wide stance the curvature of the arch
produces<00:00:13.679> a<00:00:13.710> low<00:00:13.920> center<00:00:14.160> of<00:00:14.280> mass<00:00:14.580> relative

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
produces a low center of mass relative

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.910 
produces a low center of mass relative
to<00:00:15.269> the<00:00:15.389> drag<00:00:15.599> created<00:00:15.809> by<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:16.230> arms<00:00:16.560> and<00:00:16.650> legs
