shows<00:03:15.060> as<00:03:15.240> well<00:03:15.270> that's<00:03:15.870> how<00:03:16.020> it<00:03:16.080> was<00:03:16.290> with

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
shows as well that's how it was with

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.260 
shows as well that's how it was with
Frankie<00:03:16.950> and<00:03:16.980> when<00:03:17.280> they<00:03:17.370> went<00:03:17.520> to<00:03:17.580> save<00:03:17.820> Robin

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:20.090 
Frankie and when they went to save Robin
Frankie<00:03:18.870> was<00:03:19.020> there<00:03:19.200> with<00:03:19.410> them<00:03:19.620> and<00:03:19.830> Brooke

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
Frankie was there with them and Brooke

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.740 
Frankie was there with them and Brooke
was<00:03:20.400> fighting<00:03:20.730> with<00:03:20.760> them<00:03:21.060> before<00:03:21.150> he<00:03:21.450> joined

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
was fighting with them before he joined

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.140 
was fighting with them before he joined
so<00:03:22.230> that<00:03:22.350> kind<00:03:22.530> of<00:03:22.560> shows<00:03:23.100> that<00:03:23.400> this<00:03:23.610> same

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
so that kind of shows that this same

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.090 
so that kind of shows that this same
kind<00:03:24.420> of<00:03:24.480> pattern<00:03:24.690> so<00:03:25.260> Jim<00:03:25.620> Bay<00:03:25.740> is<00:03:25.800> probably

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
kind of pattern so Jim Bay is probably

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.920 
kind of pattern so Jim Bay is probably
gonna<00:03:26.220> be<00:03:26.280> the<00:03:26.400> one<00:03:26.610> that<00:03:26.760> joins<00:03:27.060> plus<00:03:27.660> there

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
gonna be the one that joins plus there

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.230 
gonna be the one that joins plus there
was<00:03:28.080> i<00:03:28.140> forget<00:03:28.860> what<00:03:28.980> volume<00:03:29.190> but<00:03:29.610> there<00:03:30.090> was<00:03:30.209> a

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:30.240 
was i forget what volume but there was a

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.060 
was i forget what volume but there was a
volume<00:03:30.600> up<00:03:30.870> for<00:03:31.260> the<00:03:31.320> Fishman<00:03:31.620> Island<00:03:31.740> arc

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
volume up for the Fishman Island arc

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:33.710 
volume up for the Fishman Island arc
that<00:03:32.250> came<00:03:32.430> out<00:03:32.580> and<00:03:32.760> I<00:03:32.820> had<00:03:32.940> only<00:03:33.150> the<00:03:33.390> straw

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
that came out and I had only the straw

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.310 
that came out and I had only the straw
hats<00:03:33.930> on<00:03:34.110> there<00:03:34.320> and<00:03:34.500> and<00:03:34.980> Jim<00:03:35.640> Bay<00:03:36.140> that<00:03:37.140> was

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
hats on there and and Jim Bay that was

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.720 
hats on there and and Jim Bay that was
the<00:03:37.500> only<00:03:37.650> character<00:03:38.100> that<00:03:38.220> was<00:03:38.370> the<00:03:38.520> straw

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
the only character that was the straw

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.370 
the only character that was the straw
hat<00:03:38.910> so<00:03:39.120> that's<00:03:39.330> also<00:03:39.540> probably<00:03:39.959> a<00:03:40.170> clue<00:03:40.350> that

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
hat so that's also probably a clue that

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.170 
hat so that's also probably a clue that
aura<00:03:40.770> is<00:03:40.920> given<00:03:41.220> us<00:03:41.340> that<00:03:41.520> Jimmy's<00:03:41.910> gonna<00:03:42.060> be

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
aura is given us that Jimmy's gonna be

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.960 
aura is given us that Jimmy's gonna be
the<00:03:42.270> one<00:03:42.390> to<00:03:42.510> join<00:03:42.830> and<00:03:43.830> actually<00:03:44.700> I<00:03:44.760> wouldn't

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
the one to join and actually I wouldn't

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.699 
the one to join and actually I wouldn't
mind<00:03:45.090> Jimmy<00:03:45.720> is<00:03:45.780> a<00:03:45.870> really<00:03:46.080> cool<00:03:46.230> character
