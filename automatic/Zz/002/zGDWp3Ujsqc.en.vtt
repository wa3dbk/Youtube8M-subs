my<00:00:30.420> first<00:00:30.630> video<00:00:30.960> I<00:00:31.289> could<00:00:31.439> only<00:00:31.500> pop<00:00:31.859> hairs<00:00:32.130> in

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.400 
my first video I could only pop hairs in
half<00:00:32.579> but<00:00:33.149> this<00:00:33.300> time<00:00:33.510> I<00:00:33.750> can<00:00:33.899> actually<00:00:34.050> split

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
half but this time I can actually split

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.459 
half but this time I can actually split
them<00:00:34.590> up<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.800> middle<00:00:34.950> off<00:00:35.340> camera<00:00:36.469> so

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
them up the middle off camera so

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.860 
them up the middle off camera so
hopefully<00:00:37.950> on<00:00:38.160> camera<00:00:38.730> I<00:00:38.940> can<00:00:39.390> get<00:00:39.510> it<00:00:39.600> to<00:00:39.690> work

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
hopefully on camera I can get it to work

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.229 
hopefully on camera I can get it to work
it's<00:00:40.230> kind<00:00:40.469> of<00:00:40.559> I've<00:00:40.860> already<00:00:41.010> tried<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.910> it's

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239

kind<00:00:42.420> of<00:00:42.450> a<00:00:42.570> weird<00:00:42.600> angle<00:00:43.489> to<00:00:44.489> be<00:00:44.610> trying<00:00:44.879> to<00:00:44.969> do

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
kind of a weird angle to be trying to do

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.760 
kind of a weird angle to be trying to do
this<00:00:45.300> at<00:00:45.539> but<00:00:45.899> maybe<00:00:46.200> I<00:00:46.320> can<00:00:46.440> get<00:00:46.710> it<00:00:48.770> you
