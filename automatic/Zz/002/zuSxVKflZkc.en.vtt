higher okay so you want to get to

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.960 
higher okay so you want to get to
pitch<00:01:57.160> same<00:01:58.160> as<00:01:58.280> your<00:01:58.430> fifth<00:01:58.610> random

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970

assumption

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
assumption

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:08.169 
assumption
not<00:02:01.000> to<00:02:01.180> it<00:02:01.680> so<00:02:02.680> you<00:02:02.710> go

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.249 

make<00:02:09.179> sure<00:02:09.210> you're<00:02:09.420> accurate<00:02:09.600> so<00:02:10.020> you<00:02:10.110> hit

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
make sure you're accurate so you hit

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.199 
make sure you're accurate so you hit
that<00:02:10.380> pitch<00:02:10.590> right<00:02:10.800> on<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.160> right<00:02:11.880> on<00:02:12.030> the

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
that pitch right on the right on the

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.510 
that pitch right on the right on the
head

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
head

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.990 
head
so<00:02:15.060> you<00:02:15.150> want<00:02:15.300> to<00:02:15.360> go<00:02:15.420> up<00:02:15.660> release<00:02:16.470> it<00:02:16.650> up<00:02:17.550> again

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
so you want to go up release it up again

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.620 
so you want to go up release it up again
and<00:02:18.210> then<00:02:18.690> release<00:02:18.960> it<00:02:18.990> on<00:02:19.350> one<00:02:20.130> attack

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
and then release it on one attack

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.540 
and then release it on one attack
yeah<00:02:23.630> so<00:02:23.870> that's<00:02:24.050> basically<00:02:24.230> it<00:02:24.560> and<00:02:24.920> the

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
yeah so that's basically it and the

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:42.850 
yeah so that's basically it and the
verse<00:02:28.660> isn't<00:02:29.660> quite<00:02:30.080> as<00:02:30.230> complex<00:02:30.680> it<00:02:30.950> just

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.820 

I<00:02:43.210> just<00:02:44.210> using<00:02:44.570> the<00:02:44.840> chords<00:02:45.380> that<00:02:45.470> we<00:02:45.530> talked

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
I just using the chords that we talked

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.770 
I just using the chords that we talked
about<00:02:45.920> on<00:02:46.160> the<00:02:46.190> intro<00:02:46.640> kind<00:02:47.540> of<00:02:47.630> in<00:02:47.720> a

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
about on the intro kind of in a

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.250 
about on the intro kind of in a
different<00:02:48.080> progression<00:02:48.500> so<00:02:48.770> I'm<00:02:49.130> doing<00:02:49.490> be

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
different progression so I'm doing be

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:57.390 
different progression so I'm doing be
follow<00:02:51.260> that<00:02:52.030> bar<00:02:53.030> V<00:02:53.240> then<00:02:53.930> two<00:02:54.140> bars<00:02:54.350> to<00:02:54.440> be

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:03.010 

and<00:02:58.400> then<00:02:58.580> it<00:02:58.849> changes<00:02:59.150> a<00:02:59.209> little<00:02:59.300> bit<00:03:01.810> or<00:03:02.810> that

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020 
and then it changes a little bit or that

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:08.050 
and then it changes a little bit or that
I've<00:03:03.470> sharp<00:03:03.800> will<00:03:04.190> borrow<00:03:04.400> that<00:03:06.730> two<00:03:07.730> bars<00:03:07.940> of

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
I've sharp will borrow that two bars of

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.920 
I've sharp will borrow that two bars of
be<00:03:09.220> okay<00:03:10.220> so<00:03:10.580> it<00:03:10.730> looks<00:03:10.790> like<00:03:10.940> you<00:03:11.300> repeat<00:03:11.900> that

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
be okay so it looks like you repeat that

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:18.280 
be okay so it looks like you repeat that
and<00:03:12.800> after<00:03:13.760> that's<00:03:13.880> the<00:03:14.090> course

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.280 

then<00:03:29.969> back<00:03:30.180> to<00:03:30.360> your

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
then back to your

and<00:03:41.470> then<00:03:42.190> you<00:03:42.460> basically<00:03:42.610> do<00:03:42.940> the<00:03:43.000> same<00:03:43.090> thing

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
and then you basically do the same thing

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.780 
and then you basically do the same thing
except<00:03:44.080> use<00:03:44.440> two<00:03:44.710> bars<00:03:44.920> of<00:03:45.040> be<00:03:45.340> okay<00:03:46.060> so<00:03:46.770> the

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
except use two bars of be okay so the

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:54.950 
except use two bars of be okay so the
second<00:03:48.790> floor<00:03:48.910> bars<00:03:49.180> would<00:03:49.360> be

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:54.960 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.420 

okay<00:03:55.960> so<00:03:56.230> first<00:03:56.440> eight<00:03:56.680> bars<00:03:56.710> of<00:03:57.010> the<00:03:57.100> chorus

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
okay so first eight bars of the chorus

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:03.750 
okay so first eight bars of the chorus
go

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.330 

you

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.790 

you<00:04:09.340> basically<00:04:09.550> start<00:04:10.120> over<00:04:10.480> again<00:04:10.590> back<00:04:11.590> to<00:04:11.620> e

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:11.800 
you basically start over again back to e

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.470 
you basically start over again back to e
F<00:04:12.730> sharp<00:04:12.790> this<00:04:13.420> time<00:04:13.480> going<00:04:13.810> to<00:04:13.870> change<00:04:14.140> it

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
F sharp this time going to change it

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.110 
F sharp this time going to change it
to<00:04:16.079> G<00:04:16.410> sharp<00:04:16.709> that's<00:04:17.070> on<00:04:17.220> the<00:04:17.280> fourth<00:04:17.519> fret<00:04:17.699> and

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
to G sharp that's on the fourth fret and

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:23.640 
to G sharp that's on the fourth fret and
then<00:04:19.250> C<00:04:20.250> sharp

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.439 

and<00:04:23.770> with<00:04:24.040> a<00:04:24.100> c-sharp<00:04:24.490> you're<00:04:24.970> going<00:04:25.150> to<00:04:25.270> add

00:04:25.439 --> 00:04:25.449 
and with a c-sharp you're going to add

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:32.580 
and with a c-sharp you're going to add
an<00:04:25.690> extra<00:04:26.020> bar<00:04:26.229> okay<00:04:31.110> and<00:04:32.110> the<00:04:32.199> reason<00:04:32.350> why<00:04:32.560> I

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
an extra bar okay and the reason why I

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.460 
an extra bar okay and the reason why I
think<00:04:32.919> is<00:04:33.009> just<00:04:33.039> kind<00:04:33.520> of<00:04:33.580> builds<00:04:34.419> a<00:04:34.810> little

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
think is just kind of builds a little

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.200 
think is just kind of builds a little
bit<00:04:35.590> of<00:04:35.680> anticipation<00:04:36.310> because<00:04:36.639> it<00:04:36.940> got<00:04:37.000> the

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
bit of anticipation because it got the

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:42.870 
bit of anticipation because it got the
the<00:04:37.750> punchline<00:04:38.229> right<00:04:38.500> after<00:04:38.830> that<00:04:40.050> so<00:04:41.880> second

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 
the punchline right after that so second

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.540 
the punchline right after that so second
eight<00:04:43.030> bars<00:04:43.360> or<00:04:43.750> second<00:04:44.110> nine<00:04:44.289> bars<00:04:44.650> or<00:04:45.520> a

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
eight bars or second nine bars or a

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.469 
eight bars or second nine bars or a
second<00:04:46.000> one<00:04:46.600> two<00:04:46.840> three<00:04:47.259> four<00:04:47.440> five<00:04:47.650> six<00:04:47.710> seven

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:48.479 
second one two three four five six seven

00:04:48.479 --> 00:05:00.250 
second one two three four five six seven
seven<00:04:49.479> bars<00:04:49.810> are<00:04:50.020> going<00:04:50.139> to<00:04:50.199> be<00:04:50.320> like

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:00.260 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.970 

and<00:05:00.700> then<00:05:01.700> about<00:05:02.180> e<00:05:02.480> or<00:05:02.810> f<00:05:02.870> sharp<00:05:03.320> so<00:05:03.800> once

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:03.980 
and then about e or f sharp so once

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:06.410 
and then about e or f sharp so once
again

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:06.420
