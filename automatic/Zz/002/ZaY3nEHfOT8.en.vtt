00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.510 
gnats if you want to try it go ahead
hopefully<00:03:49.440> it<00:03:49.500> works<00:03:49.650> for<00:03:49.830> you<00:03:49.980> just<00:03:50.220> remember

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:50.520 
hopefully it works for you just remember

00:03:50.520 --> 00:04:00.440 
hopefully it works for you just remember
the<00:03:50.670> hotter<00:03:50.850> the<00:03:51.030> better<00:03:58.310> okay<00:03:59.310> so<00:03:59.730> if<00:04:00.060> that

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
the hotter the better okay so if that

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.660 
the hotter the better okay so if that
solution<00:04:00.840> is<00:04:00.960> work<00:04:01.200> I've<00:04:01.410> read<00:04:02.100> a<00:04:02.130> few<00:04:02.460> other

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
solution is work I've read a few other

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.160 
solution is work I've read a few other
solutions<00:04:03.270> that<00:04:03.420> are<00:04:03.540> supposed<00:04:03.870> to<00:04:03.960> work

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
solutions that are supposed to work

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.150 
solutions that are supposed to work
number<00:04:04.830> one<00:04:05.040> is<00:04:05.420> you<00:04:06.420> get<00:04:06.570> ground<00:04:07.160> cinnamon

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
number one is you get ground cinnamon

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.640 
number one is you get ground cinnamon
you<00:04:09.120> just<00:04:09.330> pour<00:04:09.540> some<00:04:09.570> of<00:04:09.810> that<00:04:09.900> on<00:04:10.140> the<00:04:10.260> top<00:04:10.500> of

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
you just pour some of that on the top of

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.260 
you just pour some of that on the top of
the<00:04:10.740> soil<00:04:10.950> and<00:04:11.280> that<00:04:11.490> is<00:04:11.610> supposedly<00:04:11.880> supposed

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:12.270 
the soil and that is supposedly supposed

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:14.000 
the soil and that is supposedly supposed
to<00:04:12.360> kill<00:04:12.660> whatever<00:04:13.020> the<00:04:13.260> fungus<00:04:13.560> gnats<00:04:13.770> eat

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
to kill whatever the fungus gnats eat

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.289 
to kill whatever the fungus gnats eat
the<00:04:14.790> larvae<00:04:15.090> eat<00:04:15.270> as<00:04:15.390> well<00:04:15.600> um<00:04:16.220> so<00:04:17.220> you<00:04:18.120> could

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
the larvae eat as well um so you could

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.240 
the larvae eat as well um so you could
always<00:04:18.420> try<00:04:18.750> that<00:04:18.960> I'm<00:04:19.350> pretty<00:04:19.830> sure<00:04:20.070> that

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
always try that I'm pretty sure that

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:21.770 
always try that I'm pretty sure that
might<00:04:20.549> work<00:04:20.760> and<00:04:20.970> actually<00:04:21.270> maybe<00:04:21.419> killing

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
might work and actually maybe killing

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.210 
might work and actually maybe killing
the<00:04:21.930> larvae<00:04:22.169> too<00:04:22.320> because<00:04:22.590> if<00:04:22.710> anyone's<00:04:23.040> done

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
the larvae too because if anyone's done

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:24.500 
the larvae too because if anyone's done
the<00:04:23.310> cinnamon<00:04:23.640> challenge<00:04:23.760> you<00:04:24.030> know<00:04:24.180> how<00:04:24.330> much

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
the cinnamon challenge you know how much

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.679 
the cinnamon challenge you know how much
it<00:04:24.660> burns<00:04:24.870> just<00:04:25.550> like<00:04:26.550> the<00:04:26.850> hot<00:04:27.000> style

00:04:27.679 --> 00:04:27.689 
it burns just like the hot style

00:04:27.689 --> 00:04:30.260 
it burns just like the hot style
but<00:04:28.289> uh<00:04:28.469> okay<00:04:29.370> so<00:04:29.430> there's<00:04:29.849> ground<00:04:30.060> cinnamon

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
but uh okay so there's ground cinnamon

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.420 
but uh okay so there's ground cinnamon
and<00:04:30.569> then<00:04:30.689> the<00:04:30.780> other<00:04:30.960> more<00:04:31.319> organic<00:04:31.860> solution

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
and then the other more organic solution

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.339 
and then the other more organic solution
which<00:04:32.639> is<00:04:32.879> kind<00:04:33.330> of<00:04:33.419> proven<00:04:33.750> to<00:04:33.840> work<00:04:33.960> for<00:04:34.199> most

00:04:34.339 --> 00:04:34.349 
which is kind of proven to work for most

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:37.100 
which is kind of proven to work for most
people<00:04:34.710> is<00:04:34.889> just<00:04:35.219> a<00:04:35.629> pyrethrin<00:04:36.629> spray<00:04:36.870> i

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
people is just a pyrethrin spray i

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.580 
people is just a pyrethrin spray i
believe<00:04:37.500> it's<00:04:37.710> made<00:04:37.860> from<00:04:38.310> a<00:04:39.590> chrysanthemum

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
believe it's made from a chrysanthemum

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.790 
believe it's made from a chrysanthemum
plant<00:04:41.159> or<00:04:41.430> flower<00:04:41.810> or<00:04:42.810> order<00:04:43.080> that<00:04:43.229> maybe<00:04:43.469> neem
