00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.570 
is guilty of copyright infringement but
for<00:02:39.600> some<00:02:39.750> reason<00:02:40.080> that<00:02:40.290> the<00:02:40.800> penalty<00:02:41.100> for

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
that is being put to the test again so

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.800 
that is being put to the test again so
it'd<00:02:44.550> definitely<00:02:44.760> be<00:02:45.000> interested<00:02:45.510> to<00:02:45.630> see

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
what comes of this but either way I

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.670 
what comes of this but either way I
don't<00:02:48.420> think<00:02:48.660> it<00:02:48.810> can<00:02:48.960> really<00:02:49.110> end<00:02:49.320> that<00:02:49.530> well

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680
