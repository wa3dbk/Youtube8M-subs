chambers<00:00:17.910> and<00:00:18.150> down<00:00:18.570> below<00:00:18.900> we<00:00:19.199> have<00:00:19.230> a

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
chambers and down below we have a

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.230 
chambers and down below we have a
flowering<00:00:20.130> chain<00:00:20.369> where<00:00:20.550> we<00:00:20.640> can<00:00:20.820> flower<00:00:21.060> your

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
flowering chain where we can flower your

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.900 
flowering chain where we can flower your
plants<00:00:21.570> up<00:00:21.660> is<00:00:21.840> two<00:00:22.080> and<00:00:22.170> a<00:00:22.260> half<00:00:22.380> feet<00:00:22.590> tall

plants up is two and a half feet tall
this<00:00:23.910> way<00:00:24.210> you<00:00:24.570> have<00:00:24.689> complete<00:00:25.320> cycle

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
this way you have complete cycle

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.589 
this way you have complete cycle
rotation<00:00:26.460> so<00:00:26.699> you'll<00:00:26.849> never<00:00:27.090> have<00:00:27.240> to<00:00:27.420> ever

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
rotation so you'll never have to ever

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.929 
rotation so you'll never have to ever
buy<00:00:27.840> plants<00:00:28.170> again<00:00:28.619> and<00:00:28.920> you'll<00:00:29.429> always<00:00:29.640> have

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
buy plants again and you'll always have

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.720 
buy plants again and you'll always have
plants<00:00:30.449> either<00:00:30.599> flowering<00:00:31.320> or<00:00:31.730> vegetating

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
plants either flowering or vegetating

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.400 
plants either flowering or vegetating
and<00:00:33.000> every<00:00:33.480> few<00:00:33.719> months<00:00:33.870> you're<00:00:34.230> rotating

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
and every few months you're rotating

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.490 
and every few months you're rotating
such<00:00:35.010> a<00:00:35.040> complete<00:00:35.579> cycle<00:00:36.030> rotation<00:00:36.600> let's

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
such a complete cycle rotation let's

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.619 
such a complete cycle rotation let's
start<00:00:37.920> with<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.250> top<00:00:38.520> vegetation<00:00:39.480> and

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
start with the top vegetation and

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.049 
start with the top vegetation and
cloning<00:00:39.960> chamber<00:00:40.379> it<00:00:41.040> features<00:00:41.430> a<00:00:41.460> seedling

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.580 
put them in the super cloner features
two<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.399> five<00:00:53.670> fluorescent<00:00:54.480> light<00:00:54.660> now<00:00:55.410> we're

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
two to five fluorescent light now we're

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.590 
two to five fluorescent light now we're
moving<00:00:55.770> on<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.309> flowering<00:00:56.730> chamber<00:00:57.180> this

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
moving on to the flowering chamber this

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.689 
moving on to the flowering chamber this
is<00:00:57.750> what<00:00:57.930> really<00:00:58.140> sets<00:00:58.500> super<00:00:58.859> closet<00:00:59.309> apart

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
is what really sets super closet apart

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.180 
is what really sets super closet apart
from<00:00:59.940> all<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.449> competition<00:01:00.680> first<00:01:01.680> off<00:01:02.010> we

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
from all the competition first off we

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.740 
from all the competition first off we
start<00:01:02.489> off<00:01:02.579> with<00:01:02.760> a<00:01:02.789> high<00:01:03.059> pressure<00:01:03.329> sodium

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
start off with a high pressure sodium

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.660 
start off with a high pressure sodium
light<00:01:04.110> you<00:01:04.320> can<00:01:04.470> see<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.949> yellow<00:01:05.220> light<00:01:05.339> it

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
light you can see the yellow light it

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.480 
light you can see the yellow light it
gives<00:01:05.909> this<00:01:06.360> is<00:01:06.570> perfect<00:01:07.020> for<00:01:07.200> flowering<00:01:07.650> it's

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
gives this is perfect for flowering it's

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.640 
gives this is perfect for flowering it's
all<00:01:08.700> about<00:01:08.909> centralized<00:01:09.750> lumens<00:01:10.320> is<00:01:10.470> what

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
all about centralized lumens is what

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.620 
all about centralized lumens is what
gives<00:01:10.890> it<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.280> plants<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.060> powerful

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
gives it the plants the powerful

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.130 
gives it the plants the powerful
photosynthesis<00:01:13.439> with<00:01:14.280> CFLs<00:01:14.790> of<00:01:15.150> disputes<00:01:15.840> and

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
photosynthesis with CFLs of disputes and

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.320 
photosynthesis with CFLs of disputes and
they're<00:01:16.979> much<00:01:17.159> similar<00:01:17.549> to<00:01:17.610> what<00:01:17.880> you<00:01:17.970> see<00:01:18.210> on

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
they're much similar to what you see on

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.289 
they're much similar to what you see on
the<00:01:18.450> side<00:01:18.720> which<00:01:19.530> is<00:01:19.680> these<00:01:19.799> t5<00:01:20.340> cool<00:01:21.000> white

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
the side which is these t5 cool white

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.780 
the side which is these t5 cool white
lights<00:01:21.600> so<00:01:22.320> now<00:01:22.470> you<00:01:22.530> have<00:01:22.799> a<00:01:22.830> cool<00:01:23.250> light<00:01:23.460> blue

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
lights so now you have a cool light blue

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.490 
lights so now you have a cool light blue
spectrum<00:01:24.299> it<00:01:24.600> fills<00:01:25.259> in<00:01:25.650> all<00:01:26.100> of<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.970> lower

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
spectrum it fills in all of the lower

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.249 
spectrum it fills in all of the lower
branches<00:01:28.500> of<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.770> canopy<00:01:29.130> fills<00:01:30.119> this<00:01:30.360> in<00:01:30.659> now

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
branches of the canopy fills this in now

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.190 
branches of the canopy fills this in now
the<00:01:31.320> reason<00:01:31.710> why<00:01:31.890> Superman<00:01:32.540> there<00:01:33.540> because<00:01:34.020> it

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
the reason why Superman there because it

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.109 
the reason why Superman there because it
completes<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.740> spectrum<00:01:35.400> so<00:01:35.820> it's<00:01:35.939> very

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
completes the spectrum so it's very

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.819 
completes the spectrum so it's very
important<00:01:36.540> if<00:01:36.900> you<00:01:36.930> ever<00:01:37.140> have<00:01:37.259> side<00:01:37.560> lighting

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
important if you ever have side lighting

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.010 
important if you ever have side lighting
is<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.100> have<00:01:38.250> t5<00:01:38.850> fluorescent<00:01:39.090> lighting<00:01:39.630> and

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
is to have t5 fluorescent lighting and

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.350 
is to have t5 fluorescent lighting and
on<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.860> top<00:01:41.100> always<00:01:41.490> have<00:01:41.880> high<00:01:42.119> pressure

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
on the top always have high pressure

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.389 
on the top always have high pressure
sodium<00:01:42.810> in<00:01:43.170> now<00:01:43.560> let's<00:01:43.770> move<00:01:43.920> on<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:44.310> the

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.550 
fusion or combination combining
different<00:04:04.110> hydroponic<00:04:04.980> method

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
different hydroponic method

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.460 
different hydroponic method
all<00:04:05.890> into<00:04:06.220> one<00:04:06.580> so<00:04:07.510> for<00:04:07.720> this<00:04:07.780> super<00:04:08.140> chronic

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
all into one so for this super chronic

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:09.900 
all into one so for this super chronic
state<00:04:08.680> system<00:04:09.130> that<00:04:09.160> you<00:04:09.400> can<00:04:09.550> see<00:04:09.700> there's

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 
state system that you can see there's

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.240 
state system that you can see there's
actually<00:04:10.060> two<00:04:10.510> of<00:04:10.540> them<00:04:10.810> it<00:04:11.440> combines<00:04:11.890> deep

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
actually two of them it combines deep

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.580 
actually two of them it combines deep
water<00:04:12.489> culture<00:04:12.760> so<00:04:13.750> there's<00:04:13.930> super

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
water culture so there's super

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.849 
water culture so there's super
oxygenated<00:04:15.359> roots<00:04:16.359> from<00:04:16.630> the<00:04:16.750> bottom<00:04:17.139> misting

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 
oxygenated roots from the bottom misting

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:19.620 
oxygenated roots from the bottom misting
up<00:04:18.010> to<00:04:18.130> the<00:04:18.220> top<00:04:18.459> and<00:04:18.910> what's<00:04:19.329> even<00:04:19.419> more

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
up to the top and what's even more

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:22.260 
up to the top and what's even more
important<00:04:20.320> is<00:04:20.470> the<00:04:20.650> top<00:04:20.889> feed<00:04:21.220> what<00:04:21.910> the<00:04:22.030> top

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
important is the top feed what the top

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.840 
important is the top feed what the top
feed<00:04:22.540> does<00:04:22.750> is<00:04:23.050> with<00:04:23.320> a<00:04:23.350> water<00:04:23.770> pump<00:04:24.130> bring

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:24.850 
feed does is with a water pump bring

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:26.430 
feed does is with a water pump bring
nutrients<00:04:25.510> from<00:04:25.630> the<00:04:25.810> bottom<00:04:26.230> of<00:04:26.350> the

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
nutrients from the bottom of the

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.440 
nutrients from the bottom of the
reservoir<00:04:26.620> brings<00:04:27.310> them<00:04:27.520> all<00:04:27.790> the<00:04:28.000> way<00:04:28.150> up<00:04:28.300> to

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:28.450 
reservoir brings them all the way up to

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:30.470 
reservoir brings them all the way up to
the<00:04:28.570> top<00:04:28.780> and<00:04:29.080> flushes<00:04:29.650> it<00:04:29.800> from<00:04:29.950> the<00:04:30.070> top<00:04:30.310> down

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:30.480 
the top and flushes it from the top down

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.550 
the top and flushes it from the top down
this<00:04:31.480> way<00:04:31.660> you're<00:04:31.840> getting<00:04:31.930> water<00:04:32.380> and

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
this way you're getting water and

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.100 
this way you're getting water and
nutrients<00:04:33.190> from<00:04:33.280> the<00:04:33.430> top<00:04:33.669> down<00:04:34.000> and<00:04:34.330> from<00:04:35.080> the

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
nutrients from the top down and from the

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.860 
nutrients from the top down and from the
bottom<00:04:35.380> up<00:04:35.710> there's<00:04:36.220> two<00:04:36.700> super<00:04:37.300> ponics<00:04:37.690> aid

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
bottom up there's two super ponics aid

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.409 
bottom up there's two super ponics aid
this<00:04:38.830> way<00:04:39.100> you<00:04:39.160> can<00:04:39.520> have<00:04:39.700> a<00:04:39.729> different

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:40.419 
this way you can have a different

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:42.600 
this way you can have a different
variety<00:04:40.690> in<00:04:41.110> one<00:04:41.620> of<00:04:41.740> the<00:04:41.800> systems<00:04:42.250> than<00:04:42.490> the

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
variety in one of the systems than the

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.940 
variety in one of the systems than the
other<00:04:42.790> systems<00:04:43.360> or<00:04:44.080> you<00:04:44.260> can<00:04:44.440> have<00:04:44.590> them<00:04:44.770> at

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:44.950 
other systems or you can have them at

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:46.469 
other systems or you can have them at
different<00:04:45.130> stages<00:04:45.880> so<00:04:45.910> you<00:04:46.090> can<00:04:46.270> harvest

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:46.479 
different stages so you can harvest

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:48.090 
different stages so you can harvest
rather<00:04:46.810> than<00:04:47.020> every<00:04:47.229> two<00:04:47.470> months<00:04:47.650> for<00:04:47.800> a<00:04:47.979> lot

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:48.100 
rather than every two months for a lot

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:49.710 
rather than every two months for a lot
of<00:04:48.220> clams<00:04:48.460> you<00:04:48.700> can<00:04:48.850> actually<00:04:49.000> harvest<00:04:49.300> every

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
of clams you can actually harvest every

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.409 
of clams you can actually harvest every
one<00:04:50.130> so<00:04:51.130> you<00:04:51.190> can<00:04:51.400> have<00:04:51.550> different<00:04:51.850> nutrient

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:52.419 
one so you can have different nutrient

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:55.830 
one so you can have different nutrient
levels<00:04:52.780> in<00:04:52.930> each<00:04:53.290> one<00:04:53.530> a<00:04:53.770> lot<00:04:54.100> better<00:04:54.840> control

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
levels in each one a lot better control

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.980 
levels in each one a lot better control
over<00:04:56.139> your<00:04:56.620> growing<00:04:57.190> and<00:04:57.490> will<00:04:58.270> grow<00:04:58.510> two<00:04:58.840> to

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
over your growing and will grow two to

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.400 
over your growing and will grow two to
five<00:04:59.229> times<00:04:59.310> faster<00:05:00.310> than<00:05:00.460> any<00:05:00.700> single

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.410 
five times faster than any single

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:05.370 
five times faster than any single
