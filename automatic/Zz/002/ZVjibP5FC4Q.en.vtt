00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.879
 good morning today we are going to show you how 

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:17.610
 save water by repairing leaks so 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:20.369
 annoying and expensive to download the 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:22.470
 toilet if the water runs continuously 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.779
 in the toilet is often due to 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.419
 that the packaging of the unloading mechanism 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.520
 does not hermetically seal the bottom of the 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:32.250
 water cistern because it has some 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:35.129
 defect or because it has deteriorated with 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.710
 the passage of time the first stage of 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:40.079
 our intervention is to close 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.360
 the arrival of water to the toilet through 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.880
 of the key or directly from the 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:49.190
 meter then you have to operate the 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.190
 mechanism to empty the cistern 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.420
 loosen the handle or button depending 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.120
 of the type of cistern 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:04.220
 lift the lid and put it on another side 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:07.119
 delicately now you must disarm the 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:10.159
 mechanism for this effect 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:12.290
 about a quarter of a rotation in 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:14.390
 clockwise in 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.580
 some models will be necessary to remove 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.220
 the float before doing this 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.289
 operation just need to take out the packaging 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.509
 used I'm going to place it for a new one 

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:25.909
 the packages are available in any 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:28.940
 DIY store there are several types 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:31.819
 that's why it's advisable to take the packaging 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:34.700
 used to the store not to be wrong 

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:37.310
 finally re-assemble the mechanism 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.200
 with the new packaging turning a quarter 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:43.330
 back but now in sense 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.330
 contrary to the hands of the clock 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:51.600
 close and adjust the handle open the key 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.600
 of water 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:58.899
 magic the cistern and last night rea and it 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:58.899
 they finished the problems of flight 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.210
 I put
