 this victory deserves 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:34.920

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.090
 Points this game where we got wrong 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.420
 read and research sham made that 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.940
 That was the game decision very much 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.739
 are well under the top ten 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.730
 minutes later the game starts 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.010
 bit balanced 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.289
 we came back 1 1 before 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.850
 this second gate that was there is no 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.330
 sorry that from lisa bohle 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:09.240
 plays there is no excuse and 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.799
 after kaymer 321 games and this show 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.020
 Kerner that was crucial in the 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:17.070
 but at the end of the game that is a 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:20.460
 process we know that and that's first 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:25.619
 this is three points away but so 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:27.020
 is that and the preparation augsburg am 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.080
 Sunday 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.080
 Many Thanks 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:24.269
 So job says that he is very happy 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.950
 with the course of the game today with the 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:27.810
 Three points above all things there were in the 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.599
 second thirds will have a phase 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.590
 ingolstädter exercised a lot of pressure 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:33.300
 but the eagle then have the game 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.700
 he was also in the grip again 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.170
 very satisfied with the special teams and 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.030
 of course it was decided that the 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.099
 eagle in the right moments the gates 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.860
 shot around the momentum again 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:44.549
 recover 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.220
 yes then I would now the 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:51.110
 media representatives please ask your questions 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.110
 to address to both coaches 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:34.500
 So he says he is outnumbered today 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.299
 teams was very satisfied and it was very 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:51.120
 important that you played well there 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:52.380
 has and has not allowed gates so 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.690
 that she did not play today 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:57.620
 was just a factual decision 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.620
 today by the coach 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:09.340
 question to you have been a long time 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:11.620
 successful switzerland if you do the 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.510
 intensity of today's game with the 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.990
 swiss leader compares like this 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.990
 your opinion 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:25.030
 that's just a touch of intensity 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:26.860
 that was that was nothing of ours 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:30.160
 Team we need more intensity 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:33.190
 the start bags from the beginning for the xo 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:35.050
 and I'm only ten late at the second gate 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.850
 minutes before the last two places 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.530
 three games started very well and 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:41.890
 the sea ​​with the point where we have one 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:43.780
 a little better today that was the opposite 

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:44.860
 we did not start that well though 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.540
 we are back in the game again 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:49.870
 come and have the second third 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:52.840
 played very well 33 22 against one 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.250
 possibilities and that one says before the 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.140
 play in a third you get 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:57.640
 two against one against mannheim 

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:59.800
 Yes, I think so 

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:03.850
 but we have to do that the park 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:05.560
 shoot inn tor and said it was a 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:08.230
 only point in the game had a game 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:10.240
 decision but to compare with 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:12.310
 swiss hockey welcome to the 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:15.490
 swiss hockey thick for my it 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:17.350
 is a step to have a quick conversion 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.720
 if I compare now the German 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:21.520
 he with whom he is for 15 years 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.050
 has become much faster and that is 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.750
 not so far 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:28.330
 the swiss league but that's just one 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:29.950
 game and the friendly game what is 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:37.510
 but last year but that my first 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:38.620
 impression no further questions we ask 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:40.150
