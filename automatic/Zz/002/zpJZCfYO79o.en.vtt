that<00:02:01.829> pic<00:02:02.039> for<00:02:02.700> them<00:02:02.819> in<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:03.000> first<00:02:03.179> round<00:02:03.479> and

00:02:03.949 --> 00:02:03.959 
that pic for them in the first round and

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:05.839 
that pic for them in the first round and
the<00:02:04.590> 3rd<00:02:04.799> they<00:02:04.950> got<00:02:04.979> Corey<00:02:05.369> Peters<00:02:05.640> defensive

00:02:05.839 --> 00:02:05.849 
the 3rd they got Corey Peters defensive

00:02:05.849 --> 00:02:07.969 
the 3rd they got Corey Peters defensive
tackle<00:02:06.750> I<00:02:06.780> thought<00:02:06.989> this<00:02:07.140> was<00:02:07.319> a<00:02:07.349> slight<00:02:07.709> reach

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
tackle I thought this was a slight reach

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.069 
tackle I thought this was a slight reach
it<00:02:08.399> just<00:02:08.549> got<00:02:08.670> power<00:02:08.910> a<00:02:08.940> Jerry<00:02:09.299> last<00:02:09.569> year<00:02:09.869> he

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:10.079 
it just got power a Jerry last year he

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:11.660 
it just got power a Jerry last year he
got<00:02:10.229> injured<00:02:10.410> before<00:02:10.649> the<00:02:10.890> season<00:02:11.220> really

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
got injured before the season really

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.610 
got injured before the season really
didn't<00:02:12.120> play<00:02:12.329> so<00:02:12.390> he'll<00:02:12.810> also<00:02:12.989> be<00:02:13.140> coming<00:02:13.500> back

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
didn't play so he'll also be coming back

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.530 
didn't play so he'll also be coming back
is<00:02:13.860> kind<00:02:14.040> of<00:02:14.099> a<00:02:14.190> first-round<00:02:14.730> pick<00:02:15.120> again

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
is kind of a first-round pick again

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.809 
is kind of a first-round pick again
Corey<00:02:16.530> Peters<00:02:16.739> I<00:02:17.040> really<00:02:17.340> think<00:02:17.489> he's<00:02:17.670> just

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
Corey Peters I really think he's just

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.030 
Corey Peters I really think he's just
more<00:02:18.030> of<00:02:18.090> a<00:02:18.180> rotational<00:02:18.840> guy<00:02:19.019> they<00:02:19.590> wanted

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
more of a rotational guy they wanted

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.979 
more of a rotational guy they wanted
some<00:02:20.250> depth<00:02:20.519> there<00:02:20.760> it<00:02:20.940> seems<00:02:21.209> with<00:02:21.510> bama<00:02:21.780> know

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
some depth there it seems with bama know

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.819 
some depth there it seems with bama know
and<00:02:22.170> with<00:02:22.799> para<00:02:23.760> Jerry<00:02:24.180> so<00:02:24.510> I<00:02:24.750> just<00:02:25.560> don't<00:02:25.739> know

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:25.829 
and with para Jerry so I just don't know

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:28.099 
and with para Jerry so I just don't know
at<00:02:26.129> the<00:02:26.400> third<00:02:26.430> round<00:02:26.849> you<00:02:27.150> can<00:02:27.180> really<00:02:27.599> take<00:02:28.079> a

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:28.109 
at the third round you can really take a

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:30.860 
at the third round you can really take a
guy<00:02:28.410> like<00:02:28.650> this<00:02:28.700> just<00:02:29.700> for<00:02:30.000> death<00:02:30.239> or<00:02:30.480> four

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
guy like this just for death or four

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.680 
guy like this just for death or four
maybe<00:02:30.989> come<00:02:31.410> in<00:02:31.440> a<00:02:31.590> couple<00:02:31.739> downs<00:02:32.480> within<00:02:33.480> a

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
maybe come in a couple downs within a

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.110 
maybe come in a couple downs within a
game<00:02:33.959> so<00:02:34.560> I<00:02:34.590> like<00:02:35.190> Corey<00:02:35.430> Peters<00:02:35.579> I<00:02:35.849> think<00:02:36.000> it's

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
game so I like Corey Peters I think it's

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.509 
game so I like Corey Peters I think it's
a<00:02:36.180> solid<00:02:36.389> player<00:02:36.810> high<00:02:37.170> motor<00:02:37.470> guy<00:02:37.829> it's<00:02:38.400> got

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:40.009 
a solid player high motor guy it's got
to<00:02:38.609> work<00:02:38.760> hard<00:02:39.030> he<00:02:39.180> can<00:02:39.299> heat<00:02:39.420> up<00:02:39.450> a<00:02:39.599> block<00:02:39.840> he

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
to work hard he can heat up a block he

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:41.990 
to work hard he can heat up a block he
can<00:02:40.170> make<00:02:40.319> a<00:02:40.349> tackle<00:02:40.680> pretty<00:02:41.040> well<00:02:41.250> but<00:02:41.730> I<00:02:41.790> just

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
can make a tackle pretty well but I just

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.610 
can make a tackle pretty well but I just
really<00:02:42.090> want<00:02:42.450> to<00:02:42.510> see<00:02:42.720> what<00:02:42.870> he's<00:02:43.019> going<00:02:43.290> to<00:02:43.319> do

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:11.639 
for running back so I like my Johnson I

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:13.250 
for running back so I like my Johnson I
think<00:03:11.669> he's<00:03:11.970> someone<00:03:12.239> that<00:03:12.269> can<00:03:12.450> start<00:03:12.780> sooner

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
think he's someone that can start sooner

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.409 
think he's someone that can start sooner
rather<00:03:13.739> than<00:03:13.980> later<00:03:14.040> for<00:03:14.489> the<00:03:14.549> Falcons<00:03:15.030> the

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:15.419 
rather than later for the Falcons the

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:17.990 
rather than later for the Falcons the

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:29.940 
like this draft I don't overly love it

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:31.760

though<00:05:30.300> a<00:05:30.330> lot<00:05:30.750> of<00:05:30.810> these<00:05:30.960> NFC<00:05:31.350> drafts<00:05:31.740> were

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:31.770 
though a lot of these NFC drafts were

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:34.100 
though a lot of these NFC drafts were
very<00:05:32.100> good<00:05:32.370> stuff<00:05:32.940> to<00:05:33.060> compare<00:05:33.479> terms<00:05:34.020> of

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:34.110 
very good stuff to compare terms of

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:35.840 
very good stuff to compare terms of
undrafted<00:05:34.380> free<00:05:34.770> agents<00:05:35.100> one<00:05:35.280> guy<00:05:35.400> caught<00:05:35.669> my

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:35.850 
undrafted free agents one guy caught my

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:38.540 
undrafted free agents one guy caught my
eye<00:05:35.880> Colin<00:05:36.450> peek<00:05:36.660> Tynan<00:05:37.140> de<00:05:37.260> Alabama<00:05:37.950> very

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:38.550 
eye Colin peek Tynan de Alabama very

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:40.969 
eye Colin peek Tynan de Alabama very
good<00:05:38.789> blocker<00:05:39.120> that's<00:05:39.870> usually<00:05:40.169> his<00:05:40.500> forte

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:40.979 
good blocker that's usually his forte

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:42.350 
good blocker that's usually his forte
but<00:05:41.010> he<00:05:41.220> also<00:05:41.340> can<00:05:41.580> catch<00:05:41.760> the<00:05:41.970> ball<00:05:42.120> a<00:05:42.150> little

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 
but he also can catch the ball a little

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.180 
but he also can catch the ball a little
bit<00:05:42.630> so<00:05:43.080> I<00:05:43.110> think<00:05:43.680> he's<00:05:43.800> someone<00:05:44.010> that<00:05:44.039> can

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:44.190 
bit so I think he's someone that can

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:45.980 
bit so I think he's someone that can
make<00:05:44.280> the<00:05:44.460> team<00:05:44.789> was<00:05:45.120> looking<00:05:45.450> for<00:05:45.660> a
