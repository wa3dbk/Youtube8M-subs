 any kind of stuffed animals 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.589
 sold at traffic lights or at 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.800
 duck pharmacies that have a little box 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:06.540
 of expired chocolates liqueur flavor are 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.820
 those stuffed animals that look like stuffed 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.470
 stones not even stones 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.299

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.740
 damn hard that are the chocolates 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.770

 ridiculous little boxes are that kind of boxes 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.179
 ridiculous that look like packs of 

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:30.539
 cigar that you say you are the maximum and 

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:33.479

 sad and stupid that I have seen in all 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.509
 my life the phrases are in bad taste and 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.369
 apart they seem taken from a person 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.380
 that she has been alone all her damn life 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.329
 and he has no idea how to flirt 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.570
 the cards they sell in the 

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:52.450
 stationeries are those sad cards that 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:55.659
 they say this is an assault give me your heart 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.979
 they give drawings like monographs and they say 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:58.990
 words that not even a child of 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:01.420
 five years ago his parents are 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.979
 stupid do not buy bottles 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.960
 transparent full of damn 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:06.819
 starlets made of paper that in each 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.069
 one they say I love you 

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:10.330
 besides being something quite slow they 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:12.940
 I swear to God they're going to end up with 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.280
 arthritis is something quite repeated and 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.230
 nothing romantic this is the typical bottle 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.660
 of empty vodka that you just sucked 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.690
 a week ago and with a damn photo 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:25.750
 Yours I swear it will not look good 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:27.960
 number 6 a collage and not because it's a 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.990
 the 5 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:33.120
 and that's it 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.430
 a printed collage of his classes in 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.040
 paint and that apart prints in a huge 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.980
 Canvas is the typical donut that you hang on the 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.810
 your partner's room or in the room to 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.590
 that all his friends see it and say 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:48.150
 my love that cute or apart from everything 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.470
 You can hang on the pedestrian bridge if 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.630
 you want the whole society to know 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.340
 of the ridicule you just did this 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.890
 It is soul that you send to do with so much 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.560
 love with fluorescent letters with 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.030
 songs of super romantic bands and 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.190
 with the worst photos you have with your 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.110
 couple the only thing you're going to achieve is that 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.690
 your partner's friends make fun of you and 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:09.660
 say look look more out monsters inc 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.920
 February 14 for you to say no 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.560
 I'm our boyfriend 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:16.200

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.940
 love of god do not do that area is going to 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.810
 end up being the pet's bed of 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:23.780
 your partner I tell you from experience 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:27.140
 yes 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:29.959
 number 7 shirts that you send to do with 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.850
 the logo and the name of your partner is that 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:34.250
 typical beach that you send to be for you and 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.709
 for your partner with a huge heart in 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:39.080
 your back and your name is a 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:41.750
 of the most cheesy and little things 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:44.000
 original and apart from everything finish with 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:46.280
 the phrase forever when you know 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.440
 perfectly that in a week two days 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:52.989
 whatever it is some day will end that 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:55.459
 relationship do not fall not love does not exist 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:57.350
 avoid the pain of giving that gift what 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:04:01.390
 only you are going to give is pity for the 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:01.390
 streets number eight 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:07.860
 number 8 artificial flowers with drops 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.470
 of silicon stuck together like water 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:12.960
 are those typical flowers that looks like 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.090
 centerpiece of 15 years these flowers 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:17.340
 they will end up full of yellow dust 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.950
 and those beautiful drops are going to end up in 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:23.550
 the trash friend friend if you are going to give away 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:25.170
 flowers give real do not be stingy your 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.720
 sweet roses if I'll stop loving you 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:29.550
 When everything withers and suddenly you 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.560
 You realize that they are artificial one 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:34.620
 tender moment as they have all done 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.690
 the women of the other number 9 the 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.520
 hearts like little medals that they buy in 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:41.160
 the typical village fair with 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:43.230
 initials recorded with those of the 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.600
 gifts that can displease you 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:47.940
 the world is dark what those hearts are 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:50.280
 of metal that are painted by the 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:52.710
 water they carry their initials but you 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.900
 I assure you something your partner never goes to 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:57.120
 same time as you because of that 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.920
 they are going to have huge fights believing that 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.960
 your love is based on that do not you 

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:02.480
 I recommend for nothing what material is not 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:06.140
 interesting when there is true love 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.140
 number 10 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:17.810
 They are also going to put a picture of you with 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:19.850
 your partner in a cup if you want to 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:21.800
 every morning your partner sees your 

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:24.860
 beautiful oval face in a cup 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.690
 while you drink good coffee the same and 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:28.010
 you can do it to remind him that he 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:30.170
 it has to behave well but let's be 

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:32.270
 sincere in any romantic movie 

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:35.360
 the protagonist gives his partner 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:38.480
 a mug with his mug is in very bad taste 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:41.240
 in good vibes so that you do it so that 

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:42.860
