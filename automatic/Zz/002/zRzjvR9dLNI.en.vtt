when they were

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.600 
when they were
a league<00:06:37.810> group<00:06:38.050> here<00:06:38.320> but<00:06:38.460> right<00:06:39.460> now

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:39.610 
a league group here but right now

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:44.560 
way too old to be venturing into that so

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:45.750 
way too old to be venturing into that so
I<00:06:44.590> think<00:06:44.680> I'd<00:06:44.920> love<00:06:45.130> to<00:06:45.250> have<00:06:45.340> a<00:06:45.370> crack<00:06:45.610> at

I think I'd love to have a crack at
Bathurst<00:06:46.060> if<00:06:46.240> the<00:06:46.360> opportunity<00:06:46.810> arose<00:06:47.050> for<00:06:47.800> us

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:47.920 
Bathurst if the opportunity arose for us

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:49.380 
Bathurst if the opportunity arose for us
to<00:06:48.040> have<00:06:48.160> a<00:06:48.190> go<00:06:48.370> but<00:06:48.580> you<00:06:49.000> know<00:06:49.030> there's

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:49.390 
to have a go but you know there's

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:50.790 
to have a go but you know there's
definitely<00:06:49.540> nothing<00:06:49.930> wrong<00:06:50.260> with<00:06:50.440> making<00:06:50.560> a

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:50.800 
definitely nothing wrong with making a

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:52.650 
definitely nothing wrong with making a
living<00:06:50.980> out<00:06:51.220> of<00:06:51.250> our<00:06:51.520> playing<00:06:51.790> in<00:06:51.970> the<00:06:52.060> dirt<00:06:52.210> no

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:52.660 
living out of our playing in the dirt no

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:54.420 
living out of our playing in the dirt no
and<00:06:52.960> it<00:06:53.170> certainly<00:06:53.650> seemed<00:06:53.890> to<00:06:54.010> cover<00:06:54.220> them<00:06:54.340> up

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:54.430 
and it certainly seemed to cover them up

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:56.520 
and it certainly seemed to cover them up
with<00:06:54.490> the<00:06:54.610> world<00:06:54.790> of<00:06:54.910> outlaws<00:06:55.180> as<00:06:55.420> well<00:06:55.630> racing
