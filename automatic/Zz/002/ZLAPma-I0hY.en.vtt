00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:09.900
 We get such a field winter for my name 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.070
 is french and today I will have it 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.839
 about the basis of supplements 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.760
 nutritional supplements and I love it myself 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.260
 actually always just pure with that 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.080
 boss is because I don't like to 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.269
 spend my money on supplements 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.199
 of which I am not sure if they work 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.689
 or not 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.849
 there are a lot of things on the 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.399
 market pots and pans and surf is one 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.520
 panties and drinks and so on 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:38.100
 anything and some of those things 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.809
 that might work but the 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.149
 are in dosages of not in order or 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.200
 peace for other things that already play a role 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.879
 play 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.530
 Well then I'd rather not have me 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.910
 take the risk of over forty there 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.190
 so I just stay 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.020
 I'd rather do the basics of which I do 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.690
 know that the brand it is indeed 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.399
 so that supplement manufacturers 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.710
 the supplement industry that is free 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.210
 undefined is the manufacturers who 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.290
 can actually like what they are in the middle of 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.670
 put the label and it is fat waste 10% 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.950
 a minimum of two weeks 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.200
 blue blue of this nonsense of that 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.540
 giant claims as along the carriage 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.299
 to drop off a little spider 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.420
 well that is not so nice because that 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.189
 asterisk that actually means of 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.350
 these statements have not been proven by 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.600
 a specific government agency 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.130
 so they can say whatever they want it 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.659
 is not where it looks anyway 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.280
 that it has not been tested but can 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.869
 competing in this way is whole 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.670
 succeeded then you must have done something wrong 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.329
 then small you have it so that's the 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:39.000
 basis of such frantic assertions by 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.590
 lose 20 pounds in two weeks 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.119
 do it will be possible that someone does it 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.439
 has weight while taking that product 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.460
 used but it doesn't mean that 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:49.439
 that product comes or that that product also 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.780
 same effect as we have now 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.790
 what super with I use so are the 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.380
 real owners I use 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.460
 and I recommend everyone 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.259
 multivitamin 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.880
 and I use a special one myself 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.830
 want to earn bodybuilding that doesn't 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.020
 only vitamin c 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:05.780
 keep but also some extra minerals 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.670
 and so on for joints for the 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.770
 digestion and for a good night's sleep 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.350
 you can also easily take a multivitamin 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.120
 for example winter or yeast on the 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.620
 You can purchase a corner of the street 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.420
 I would make sure you are goddamn anyway 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.040
 About you the good in every day 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.510
 because you are going to break yourself 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.520
 feeling fitter and that is of course bad 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.040
 important if you are day in and day out 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.200
 well do your best in the djinn and 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.740
 of course just to live a dish 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.150
 to have 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.890
 well what else i also and of course 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.600
 more specifically use is prohibited 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.740
 part is protein powder 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.720
 well those are really a lot 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.190
 types of protein powders on the market 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.440
 for instance 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.330
 whey protein casino protein 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.750
 but fast , there are very white and long ones 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.100
 which some extra function if I go like that 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.790
 I would start with bodybuilding 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:52.580
 recommend to buy in your profile 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:55.820
 wha look it is a protein that is coming 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:58.220
 Milk put upon us row whey 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:00.140
 protein and we are a species 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.340
 secretion with wild protein that from 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.010
 the milk cools 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.450
 for example when making cheese and 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.640
 You have several of these proteins 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.500
 species and 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.019
 of the brands moss and for example 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.480
 concentration so leaves an idol isolate 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:16.430
 which has an increasingly expensive purification 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.959
 but what also becomes more and more expensive 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:23.060
 a framework from this channel to your budget 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:24.170
 I often prep a mix of concentrates 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.880
 iso council 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.230
 because of this there it is really the best and 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.670
 certainly also for the people who again 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.019
 lactose will be intolerant 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.269
 notice that they are with everyone so long 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:34.220
 fewer problems getting your belly 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:36.440
 but I'm always for the 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:39.560
 concentration so let you mix purely because 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.500
 that there is the cheapest in taste there are 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:45.290
 also many different flavors 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.620
 really a lot i love it myself 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.650
 preferably 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:50.360
 my neutral tastes like the wheel 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.370
 that I know that I really need a lot 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:55.310
 and then I drink that exotic one 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:57.530
 flavors like super sweet berry drink or 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.330
 chocolate that he really smelled me the beat 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:01.310
 full in that I was also killed faster 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.630
 when I see a lot of powder there 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.590
 where I can take a few months 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:06.319
 make use of 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.519
 image does not make sense that it goes right away 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:10.250
 I have that in the past 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:13.040
 I had a shake up that put me on one 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.989
 time was not really on anymore 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.940
 And then it really is by lifting each eye 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:18.949
 times when you have to drink as shake as you do 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.199
 you already have multivitamin and protein 

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:23.240
 I can certainly go to creatine too 

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:25.580
 let's put it first 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.110
 that creatine is not busy it is normal 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.970
 dietary supplement that you also just get into 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.010
 your food is in meat only then 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.630
 of course in concentrated form 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:33.500
 so much longer a hansom 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:35.000
 get in 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.990
 effect of creatine is that you get during the 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.190
 clothing more strength and 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.510
 because you have stamina 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:40.850
 body is that cry that only top 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:42.350
 and also provides a faster 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:43.160
 so recover a little less 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.600
 muscle strain 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.030
 that is of course very chill and it 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:49.340
 thus ensures that you and your short 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:52.520
 intensity can be exertions 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:54.400
 improved increased in quality 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.870
 Well let's just put that first 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.220
 supplements are supplements 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.450
 I want to close it there is one 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.280
 addition that is the literal 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:03.229
 meaning of supplement is that something 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.330
 it will take some much time 

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:07.100
 yes food if you feed is so pussy 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:08.180
 anyway it and supplements not much 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:09.919
 have an effect 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.970
 and then you just throw in money and that 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:13.100
 you should n't do that 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:14.840
 well i hope you like this video or if 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:16.400
 have a good foundation to you 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.919
 the first supplements can go 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:21.229
 purchase that will help you with it 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:23.120
 grow big or lose proper weight 

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:24.800
 If you have more questions, you can answer them 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.720
 in the comments or of course on my 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.190
 twitter there is a link in the 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:30.590
 description and see you next 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:32.919
 again with a new video
