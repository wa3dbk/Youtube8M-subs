now sprayed the engine fogger and the

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.940 
now sprayed the engine fogger and the
other<00:02:04.520> filament

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.979

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
what this'll do is spread the engine fog

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.810 
what this'll do is spread the engine fog
or<00:02:26.720> all<00:02:26.870> over<00:02:26.900> the<00:02:27.260> cylinders<00:02:27.830> and<00:02:28.130> the<00:02:28.400> piston

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:34.900 
or all over the cylinders and the piston
rings<00:02:29.060> and<00:02:29.240> piston<00:02:33.310> there<00:02:34.310> that<00:02:34.550> should<00:02:34.790> be

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
rings and piston there that should be

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.140 
rings and piston there that should be
good<00:02:35.350> now<00:02:36.350> install<00:02:36.860> the<00:02:36.890> spark<00:02:37.430> plugs<00:02:37.670> but<00:02:38.030> do

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
good now install the spark plugs but do

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:48.850 
good now install the spark plugs but do
not<00:02:38.270> start<00:02:38.600> the<00:02:38.780> engine<00:02:47.290> the<00:02:48.290> main<00:02:48.440> reason<00:02:48.830> to

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
not start the engine the main reason to

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.800 
not start the engine the main reason to
use<00:02:49.100> engine<00:02:49.400> fogger<00:02:49.910> in<00:02:50.120> your<00:02:50.390> engine<00:02:50.720> when

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
use engine fogger in your engine when

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.270 
use engine fogger in your engine when
you<00:02:50.930> put<00:02:51.080> it<00:02:51.170> away<00:02:51.290> like<00:02:51.530> this<00:02:51.709> for<00:02:51.920> the<00:02:52.010> winter

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
you put it away like this for the winter

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.699 
you put it away like this for the winter
is<00:02:52.790> to<00:02:53.000> prevent<00:02:53.270> rust<00:02:53.630> and<00:02:53.780> corrosion<00:02:53.990> from

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
is to prevent rust and corrosion from

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:56.560 
is to prevent rust and corrosion from
building<00:02:55.010> up<00:02:55.100> inside<00:02:55.310> your<00:02:55.610> engine<00:02:55.730> this<00:02:56.390> is

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.570 
building up inside your engine this is

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:58.060 
building up inside your engine this is
especially<00:02:56.900> important<00:02:57.530> when<00:02:57.560> putting<00:02:57.950> away

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
especially important when putting away

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.040 
especially important when putting away
outboard<00:02:58.730> motors<00:02:59.060> because<00:02:59.270> their<00:02:59.600> content<00:02:59.959> to

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
outboard motors because their content to

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:01.960 
outboard motors because their content to
be<00:03:00.230> more<00:03:00.440> moisture<00:03:00.950> inside<00:03:01.430> the<00:03:01.580> engines

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
be more moisture inside the engines

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.180 
be more moisture inside the engines
since<00:03:02.360> they're<00:03:02.600> liquid<00:03:02.900> fuel<00:03:03.170> now<00:03:03.980> we've

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
since they're liquid fuel now we've

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.040 
since they're liquid fuel now we've
taken<00:03:04.370> part<00:03:04.790> of<00:03:04.910> the<00:03:05.030> engine<00:03:05.390> for<00:03:05.570> the

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.050 
taken part of the engine for the

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:08.440 
taken part of the engine for the
winterization<00:03:06.680> now<00:03:07.580> there's<00:03:07.850> still<00:03:08.000> fuel

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
winterization now there's still fuel

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.870 
winterization now there's still fuel
left<00:03:08.810> in<00:03:08.989> the<00:03:09.080> fuel<00:03:09.320> tank<00:03:09.350> over<00:03:09.709> here<00:03:10.070> now<00:03:10.820> the

left in the fuel tank over here now the

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.820 
left in the fuel tank over here now the
way<00:03:11.090> you<00:03:11.150> can<00:03:11.330> probably<00:03:11.660> put<00:03:12.080> your<00:03:12.260> tractor

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
way you can probably put your tractor

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.550 
way you can probably put your tractor
away<00:03:13.040> is<00:03:13.310> with<00:03:13.970> fuel<00:03:14.239> stabilizer<00:03:14.810> in<00:03:15.170> the<00:03:15.290> fuel

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560

gas let the engine run for a while until
the<00:03:30.170> stabilizer<00:03:30.709> that's<00:03:31.070> in<00:03:31.250> the<00:03:31.340> fuel<00:03:31.640> gets

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
the stabilizer that's in the fuel gets

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.210 
the stabilizer that's in the fuel gets
to<00:03:32.360> the<00:03:32.450> fuel<00:03:32.720> pump<00:03:32.750> and<00:03:33.110> the<00:03:33.380> carburetor<00:03:33.890> and

to the fuel pump and the carburetor and
there<00:03:35.030> the<00:03:35.330> fuel<00:03:35.660> where<00:03:35.900> the<00:03:36.049> stabilizer<00:03:36.500> is

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
there the fuel where the stabilizer is

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:38.979 
there the fuel where the stabilizer is
not<00:03:36.920> going<00:03:37.070> to<00:03:37.130> go<00:03:37.250> bad<00:03:37.600> now<00:03:38.600> what<00:03:38.720> I<00:03:38.750> usually

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
not going to go bad now what I usually

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:40.600 
not going to go bad now what I usually
do<00:03:39.290> it<00:03:39.410> the<00:03:39.500> fuel<00:03:39.769> that's<00:03:39.920> left<00:03:40.190> in<00:03:40.310> the<00:03:40.400> fuel

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:40.610 
do it the fuel that's left in the fuel

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:43.210 
do it the fuel that's left in the fuel
tank<00:03:40.910> is<00:03:41.120> I<00:03:41.390> remove<00:03:41.720> the<00:03:41.870> fuel<00:03:42.110> line<00:03:42.320> just<00:03:42.890> past

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
tank is I remove the fuel line just past

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:49.350 
tank is I remove the fuel line just past
the<00:03:43.640> fuel<00:03:43.850> cutoff<00:03:44.120> valve<00:03:47.709> just<00:03:48.709> like<00:03:48.890> that

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 
the fuel cutoff valve just like that

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.090 
the fuel cutoff valve just like that
then<00:03:50.360> I<00:03:50.480> grab<00:03:50.690> my<00:03:50.720> fuel<00:03:51.170> valve<00:03:51.410> stick<00:03:51.830> it<00:03:51.980> into

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.100 
then I grab my fuel valve stick it into

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.640 
then I grab my fuel valve stick it into
a<00:03:52.310> gas<00:03:52.489> can<00:03:52.850> like<00:03:53.060> that<00:03:53.269> and<00:03:53.510> open<00:03:54.230> it<00:03:54.350> up<00:03:54.440> and

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
a gas can like that and open it up and

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:03.490 
a gas can like that and open it up and
let<00:03:55.430> the<00:03:55.580> fuel<00:03:55.820> drain<00:03:56.030> Oh

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.050 

now<00:04:04.500> once<00:04:04.680> the<00:04:04.860> fuels<00:04:05.100> all<00:04:05.280> drained<00:04:05.580> out<00:04:05.730> just

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
now once the fuels all drained out just

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.450 
now once the fuels all drained out just
rehook<00:04:06.570> the<00:04:06.900> fuel<00:04:07.170> line<00:04:07.410> to<00:04:07.950> the<00:04:08.100> end<00:04:08.220> of<00:04:08.370> the

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:08.460 
rehook the fuel line to the end of the

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:13.570 
rehook the fuel line to the end of the
fuel<00:04:08.700> cutoff<00:04:09.000> valve<00:04:11.180> put<00:04:12.180> your<00:04:12.390> clamp<00:04:12.660> back<00:04:13.020> on

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:13.580 
fuel cutoff valve put your clamp back on

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
fuel cutoff valve put your clamp back on
and<00:04:14.960> that's<00:04:15.960> it<00:04:16.520> in<00:04:17.520> this<00:04:17.730> case<00:04:18.000> I<00:04:18.209> ran<00:04:18.480> the

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
and that's it in this case I ran the

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.810 
and that's it in this case I ran the
carburetor<00:04:19.020> dry<00:04:19.320> earlier<00:04:19.860> in<00:04:19.980> the<00:04:20.070> video<00:04:20.370> if
