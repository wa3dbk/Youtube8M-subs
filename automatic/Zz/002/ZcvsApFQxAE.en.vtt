 Dr 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:17.220
 In less than two decades, Aachen and 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.110
 Paragliding to popular blogs sports 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.510
 in Germany alone, more than 30,000 people operate this fascinating 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:24.829
 Sports 

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:27.729
 a decisive part of this development are the strict ones 

00:00:27.729 --> 00:00:31.139
 Safety checks of aircraft Kurt Solz and rescue center 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:35.010
 Since 1980, the German hang gliding association DRV 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.660
 the state works contract to perform these tests 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.140
 and set a globally recognized standard over the years 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.490
 the most important tests included test flight 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:03.960
 For this DRV employs several test pilots 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.619
 One of them is Christoph Katz after watching a new book 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.830
 Performance data familiar 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.690
 After measurements on the ground, the first test flight for the pilots is always something 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:18.310
 special first, the general flight behavior is normal and cornering 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.730
 Checked later it goes to the limits of the aircraft 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.890
 Christof Kastner usually knows the behavior of his test dragons very well 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:34.530
 with a predecessor this laugh because in 1999 became world champion 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.570
 Even as a teenager, Costner was fascinated by flying and constructing 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.380
 own model airplanes 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.610
 In the Black Forest he had seen many others for the first time and with questions 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:52.590
 pestered 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.810
 After that, there was only one goal left for him to become a hang-glider pilot 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:02.260
 DAPD 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:09.180
 it is 6 o'clock in the morning at the former military airfield Neubiberg near Munich 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.179
 no draft is yet to be felt 

00:02:12.179 --> 00:02:15.539
 ideal conditions for test with the flight Michalik measuring car 

00:02:16.169 --> 00:02:19.169
 There are only three vehicles of this type worldwide 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:36.090
 sometimes the car works like a mobile wind tunnel when driving with 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.990
 different angles of attack and speeds hosts mounted on 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.989
 Dragon checked for safety 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:45.849

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:47.889

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:50.889
 unfortunately longer there 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:57.310
 already during the fair on the 10th this the computer plant statements to 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.310
 Flight behavior of in fourth place 

00:03:13.169 --> 00:03:16.219
 the breaking strength is especially important for safety 

00:03:16.219 --> 00:03:19.059
 for the appropriate tests, the mother reaches a single performance 

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:20.959
 Vehicle not off 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:24.880
 the tuned BMW and an old Opel diplomat with v8 engine 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.169
 together reach around 600 hp train performance 

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:32.089
 so much power is required around the heavy load trailer 

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:35.089
 to accelerate the necessary speed 

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:42.419
 the required breaking strength is 6 g 

00:03:43.029 --> 00:03:46.290
 this is six times the weight of pilot and throat 

00:03:46.839 --> 00:03:50.839
 At this one-seater Dragon War the load was around 600 kilograms 

00:03:54.619 --> 00:03:57.619
 MMM Horner 

00:03:58.259 --> 00:04:01.259
 No no no 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:18.569
 the test drive can start when the cap is over the car 

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:22.789
 the examiner pulls the screen by hand and lifts it with the steering one 

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:24.529
 vertically above the vehicle 

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:27.529
 the leaf 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:29.889

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:54.520
 the food truck is accelerated to the driver's cab 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.759
 connected computer has confirmed the required load 

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:19.789
 the next to this treat exam on the test car 

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:24.229
 The paraglider must pass an additional load test on shock test
