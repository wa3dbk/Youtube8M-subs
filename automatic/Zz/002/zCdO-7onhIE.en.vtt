I'll just show you here if you can see
them<00:01:03.899> in<00:01:04.019> there<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:06.650> so<00:01:07.650> you<00:01:07.710> set<00:01:08.010> up<00:01:08.130> the

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
them in there and so you set up the

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.109 
them in there and so you set up the
decoder<00:01:08.640> I<00:01:08.970> have<00:01:09.869> it<00:01:10.110> set<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:11.000> address<00:01:12.000> 7<00:01:12.840> on<00:01:13.049> my

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119 
decoder I have it set to address 7 on my

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:18.109 
decoder I have it set to address 7 on my
NC<00:01:15.119> system<00:01:15.630> here<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.369> you<00:01:17.369> can<00:01:17.580> control<00:01:18.060> the

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
NC system here and you can control the

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.070 
NC system here and you can control the
direction<00:01:18.540> of<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.229> spin<00:01:20.060> simply<00:01:21.060> by<00:01:21.210> changing

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
direction of the spin simply by changing

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.830 
direction of the spin simply by changing
the<00:01:22.200> direction<00:01:22.409> on<00:01:23.330> your<00:01:24.680> controller<00:01:25.909> so<00:01:26.909> if<00:01:27.630> I

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
the direction on your controller so if I

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
the direction on your controller so if I
turn<00:01:28.619> that<00:01:28.829> up<00:01:29.009> you<00:01:29.729> can<00:01:29.880> see<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.860> pads

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
turn that up you can see the pads

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.969 
turn that up you can see the pads
starting<00:01:32.729> to<00:01:32.880> spin<00:01:33.530> on<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.710> car

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
starting to spin on the car

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.120 
starting to spin on the car
now<00:01:37.520> I'll<00:01:37.700> stop<00:01:38.270> them<00:01:38.659> I<00:01:38.930> can<00:01:39.890> change

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
now I'll stop them I can change

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.999 
now I'll stop them I can change
direction<00:01:40.930> and<00:01:41.930> now<00:01:42.170> they'll<00:01:42.409> spin<00:01:42.740> in<00:01:42.920> the

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 
direction and now they'll spin in the

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:46.270 
direction and now they'll spin in the
other<00:01:43.159> direction<00:01:44.200> now<00:01:45.200> they<00:01:45.409> recommend<00:01:45.979> that

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
other direction now they recommend that

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.330 
other direction now they recommend that
you<00:01:46.460> have<00:01:46.700> the<00:01:46.969> pads<00:01:47.530> spinning<00:01:48.530> on<00:01:48.710> the<00:01:48.740> inward

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
you have the pads spinning on the inward

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.910 
you have the pads spinning on the inward
direction<00:01:50.770> when<00:01:51.770> moving<00:01:52.159> forward<00:01:53.619> this<00:01:54.619> car

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
direction when moving forward this car

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.980 
direction when moving forward this car
has<00:01:55.130> a<00:01:55.159> lot<00:01:55.399> of<00:01:55.460> extra<00:01:55.819> added<00:01:56.240> weight<00:01:56.450> into<00:01:56.960> it

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
has a lot of extra added weight into it

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.940 
has a lot of extra added weight into it
so<00:01:57.470> it<00:01:57.649> keeps<00:01:58.039> it<00:01:58.810> tight<00:01:59.810> on<00:02:00.049> the<00:02:00.079> on<00:02:00.590> the<00:02:00.740> rails

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
so it keeps it tight on the on the rails

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.340 
so it keeps it tight on the on the rails
and<00:02:01.450> then<00:02:02.860> the<00:02:03.860> car<00:02:04.100> of<00:02:04.399> course<00:02:04.429> the<00:02:05.420> CMX<00:02:06.079> cars

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
and then the car of course the CMX cars

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:07.840 
and then the car of course the CMX cars
have<00:02:06.619> a<00:02:06.649> lot<00:02:06.920> of<00:02:07.069> weight<00:02:07.250> as<00:02:07.429> well<00:02:07.610> they're

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
have a lot of weight as well they're

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.100 
have a lot of weight as well they're
completely<00:02:08.239> made<00:02:08.479> of<00:02:08.599> brass

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
completely made of brass

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.190 
completely made of brass
so<00:02:09.590> this<00:02:09.799> contest<00:02:10.569> has<00:02:11.569> a<00:02:11.599> whole<00:02:11.870> lot<00:02:12.080> of

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
so this contest has a whole lot of

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.050 
so this contest has a whole lot of
weight<00:02:12.380> so<00:02:13.280> I<00:02:13.670> have<00:02:14.650> four<00:02:15.650> engines<00:02:16.250> which<00:02:16.940> I

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
weight so I have four engines which I

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.449 
weight so I have four engines which I
would<00:02:17.209> use<00:02:17.390> to<00:02:17.680> push<00:02:18.680> the<00:02:18.860> track<00:02:19.069> cleaning

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
would use to push the track cleaning

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:23.860 
would use to push the track cleaning
cars<00:02:19.670> around<00:02:20.290> so<00:02:21.290> I'll<00:02:21.739> just<00:02:21.950> hit<00:02:22.099> the<00:02:22.870> recall

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
cars around so I'll just hit the recall

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.830 
cars around so I'll just hit the recall
on<00:02:23.900> my<00:02:24.319> controller<00:02:25.090> now<00:02:26.090> which<00:02:26.269> brings<00:02:26.510> up<00:02:26.690> my

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
on my controller now which brings up my

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.240 
on my controller now which brings up my
contest<00:02:27.440> and<00:02:27.880> I'll<00:02:28.880> start<00:02:29.180> to<00:02:29.360> move<00:02:29.510> the<00:02:30.250> cars

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
contest and I'll start to move the cars

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:46.930 
contest and I'll start to move the cars
forward

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.870 

so<00:02:47.510> the<00:02:47.780> cmx<00:02:48.410> car<00:02:48.680> is<00:02:48.800> applying<00:02:49.130> a<00:02:49.280> wet<00:02:49.460> track

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
so the cmx car is applying a wet track

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.910 
so the cmx car is applying a wet track
cleaning<00:02:50.210> solution<00:02:50.780> and<00:02:52.090> and<00:02:53.090> then<00:02:53.330> the<00:02:53.890> DCCC

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
cleaning solution and and then the DCCC

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.110 
cleaning solution and and then the DCCC
controlled<00:02:55.520> MNP<00:02:56.390> car<00:02:57.190> is<00:02:58.190> rotating<00:02:58.970> and

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
controlled MNP car is rotating and

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:05.830 
controlled MNP car is rotating and
buffing<00:02:59.900> the<00:03:00.020> rails<00:03:00.230> clean<00:03:00.970> and<00:03:02.500> dry<00:03:04.840> I'll

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
buffing the rails clean and dry I'll

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.690 
buffing the rails clean and dry I'll
bring<00:03:06.110> it<00:03:06.260> one<00:03:06.440> time<00:03:06.740> around<00:03:06.920> the<00:03:07.190> loop<00:03:07.460> and

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
bring it one time around the loop and

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.420 
bring it one time around the loop and
then<00:03:07.820> show<00:03:08.150> you<00:03:08.180> guys<00:03:08.510> the<00:03:08.980> pads<00:03:09.980> on<00:03:10.340> the

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
then show you guys the pads on the

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:16.480 
then show you guys the pads on the
bottom<00:03:10.550> of<00:03:10.820> the<00:03:10.880> car

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:16.490 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:21.570 

now<00:03:17.090> I<00:03:17.120> haven't<00:03:17.630> run<00:03:17.960> the<00:03:19.030> trains<00:03:20.030> actually<00:03:20.570> in

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:21.580 
now I haven't run the trains actually in

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.620 
now I haven't run the trains actually in
probably<00:03:22.580> a<00:03:22.640> couple<00:03:22.850> of<00:03:22.970> months<00:03:23.060> I've<00:03:23.570> been

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
probably a couple of months I've been

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.040 
probably a couple of months I've been
working<00:03:23.720> on<00:03:24.140> some<00:03:24.350> other<00:03:24.410> scenery<00:03:24.920> items<00:03:26.050> so

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050 
working on some other scenery items so

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:32.230 
working on some other scenery items so
the<00:03:27.200> rails<00:03:27.410> were<00:03:28.720> extremely<00:03:29.720> dirty<00:03:31.210> when<00:03:32.210> I

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:32.240 
the rails were extremely dirty when I

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:40.610 
the rails were extremely dirty when I
hooked<00:03:32.480> up<00:03:32.690> the<00:03:33.760> contest<00:03:34.760> today

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:49.540 

so<00:03:41.250> bring<00:03:41.610> this<00:03:41.760> round<00:03:42.239> here

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:49.550 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:53.230 

now<00:03:50.180> these<00:03:50.510> pads<00:03:50.780> were<00:03:51.640> pretty<00:03:52.640> much<00:03:52.790> clean

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:53.240 
now these pads were pretty much clean

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:56.170 
now these pads were pretty much clean
when<00:03:53.510> I<00:03:53.540> put<00:03:53.810> them<00:03:53.930> on<00:03:54.610> small<00:03:55.610> range<00:03:55.790> that<00:03:56.060> hit

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
when I put them on small range that hit

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.770 
when I put them on small range that hit
the<00:03:56.330> recall<00:03:56.780> and<00:03:57.020> stop<00:03:57.320> the<00:03:57.530> rotation<00:03:58.130> of<00:03:58.310> the

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
the recall and stop the rotation of the

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:07.270 
the recall and stop the rotation of the
car<00:04:02.380> that<00:04:03.380> aside<00:04:03.860> and<00:04:04.670> you<00:04:04.730> can<00:04:05.660> see<00:04:06.040> the<00:04:07.040> pads

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
car that aside and you can see the pads

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.100 
car that aside and you can see the pads
now<00:04:07.610> are<00:04:07.900> are<00:04:08.900> quite<00:04:09.380> dirty<00:04:10.660> and<00:04:11.660> that's<00:04:11.840> just

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:12.110

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:15.510 
now are are quite dirty and that's just
from<00:04:12.290> running<00:04:12.410> around<00:04:12.650> the<00:04:13.160> loop<00:04:14.350> probably

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:15.520 
from running around the loop probably

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.900 
from running around the loop probably
three<00:04:16.520> times<00:04:16.820> this<00:04:17.570> morning<00:04:17.810> anyways<00:04:18.910> that's
