00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
it works and also then how it works with

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.929 
it works and also then how it works with
rice<00:01:19.110> as<00:01:19.439> well<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:20.250> whole<00:01:20.400> balance<00:01:20.790> between

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
rice as well the whole balance between

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.990 
rice as well the whole balance between
conservation<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:22.229> agriculture<00:01:23.070> is<00:01:23.460> critical

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
conservation and agriculture is critical

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.940 
conservation and agriculture is critical
I've<00:01:24.390> had<00:01:24.600> unique<00:01:25.170> opportunity<00:01:25.710> working

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
I've had unique opportunity working

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.440 
I've had unique opportunity working
leadership<00:01:26.369> positions<00:01:26.880> in<00:01:27.030> both<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.270> rice

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
leadership positions in both the rice

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.200 
leadership positions in both the rice
industry<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:28.680> Ducks<00:01:29.100> Unlimited<00:01:29.280> so<00:01:29.880> I've

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
industry and Ducks Unlimited so I've

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.929 
industry and Ducks Unlimited so I've
seen<00:01:30.840> both<00:01:31.140> sides<00:01:31.280> but<00:01:32.280> I<00:01:32.340> think<00:01:32.579> they<00:01:32.670> I<00:01:32.850> think

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
seen both sides but I think they I think

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.760 
seen both sides but I think they I think
they<00:01:33.150> really<00:01:33.479> do<00:01:33.630> complement<00:01:34.229> each<00:01:34.259> other<00:01:34.530> as

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
they really do complement each other as

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.450 
they really do complement each other as
long<00:01:34.829> as<00:01:35.159> we<00:01:35.340> don't<00:01:35.490> get<00:01:35.759> too<00:01:36.150> far<00:01:36.180> one<00:01:36.780> way<00:01:36.810> the

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
long as we don't get too far one way the

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.609 
long as we don't get too far one way the
I<00:01:38.460> think<00:01:38.820> it's<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.060> very<00:01:39.780> important<00:01:40.320> that<00:01:40.500> we

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
I think it's a very important that we

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.780 
I think it's a very important that we
continue<00:01:41.549> to<00:01:41.579> produce<00:01:41.759> food<00:01:42.380> safely

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 
continue to produce food safely

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.420 
continue to produce food safely
economically<00:01:45.170> that<00:01:46.170> we're<00:01:46.320> able<00:01:46.439> to<00:01:46.619> you<00:01:47.310> know

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
economically that we're able to you know

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.230 
economically that we're able to you know
that<00:01:48.180> we<00:01:48.360> continue<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:48.930> find<00:01:49.110> ways<00:01:49.170> of<00:01:49.590> getting

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
that we continue to find ways of getting

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.999 
that we continue to find ways of getting
more<00:01:51.240> production<00:01:51.869> out<00:01:51.990> of<00:01:52.140> our<00:01:52.259> land<00:01:52.439> but<00:01:52.950> at

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
more production out of our land but at

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.770 
more production out of our land but at
the<00:01:53.100> same<00:01:53.280> time<00:01:53.579> we<00:01:54.030> got<00:01:54.210> to<00:01:54.329> make<00:01:54.450> sure<00:01:54.570> we

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
the same time we got to make sure we

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.920 
the same time we got to make sure we
protect<00:01:54.960> our<00:01:55.320> soil<00:01:55.579> air<00:01:56.579> and<00:01:56.850> our<00:01:56.939> water<00:01:56.969> and

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
protect our soil air and our water and

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.649 
protect our soil air and our water and
ducks<00:01:58.170> are<00:01:58.320> kind<00:01:58.469> of<00:01:58.790> one<00:01:59.790> barometer<00:02:00.360> that<00:02:00.509> we

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
ducks are kind of one barometer that we

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.420 
ducks are kind of one barometer that we
can<00:02:00.810> use<00:02:01.049> to<00:02:01.350> make<00:02:01.500> sure<00:02:01.740> that<00:02:01.920> we're<00:02:02.070> doing<00:02:02.100> it

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
can use to make sure that we're doing it

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.920 
can use to make sure that we're doing it
doing<00:02:02.700> it<00:02:02.820> doing<00:02:02.909> it<00:02:03.180> doing<00:02:03.240> it<00:02:03.810> responsibly

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
doing it doing it doing it responsibly

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.679 
doing it doing it doing it responsibly
in<00:02:04.619> agriculture<00:02:05.280> so<00:02:06.090> I<00:02:06.119> think<00:02:06.450> it's<00:02:06.570> very

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
in agriculture so I think it's very

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.569 
in agriculture so I think it's very
important<00:02:07.079> that<00:02:07.200> we<00:02:07.290> continue<00:02:07.860> looking<00:02:08.250> and

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:08.579 
important that we continue looking and

00:02:08.579 --> 00:02:10.490 
important that we continue looking and
understanding<00:02:09.179> and<00:02:09.329> talking<00:02:09.780> to<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.410> east

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
understanding and talking to the east

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.220 
understanding and talking to the east
side<00:02:10.709> that<00:02:11.039> we<00:02:11.130> that<00:02:11.459> we<00:02:11.549> don't<00:02:11.760> get<00:02:11.880> away<00:02:12.030> from

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
side that we that we don't get away from

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.229 
side that we that we don't get away from
from<00:02:13.230> one<00:02:13.440> side<00:02:13.680> or<00:02:13.709> the<00:02:13.890> other<00:02:14.010> and<00:02:14.519> that<00:02:14.579> they

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
from one side or the other and that they

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.000 
from one side or the other and that they
can<00:02:15.480> that<00:02:15.870> the<00:02:15.989> marriage<00:02:16.200> of<00:02:16.410> the<00:02:16.560> two<00:02:16.769> can

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
can that the marriage of the two can

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.990 
can that the marriage of the two can
work<00:02:17.160> very<00:02:17.459> well<00:02:17.489> together

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
work very well together

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.910 
work very well together
zero<00:02:18.600> grade<00:02:18.900> was<00:02:19.110> was<00:02:19.410> the<00:02:19.560> answer<00:02:19.890> that

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
zero grade was was the answer that

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.409 
zero grade was was the answer that
because<00:02:20.190> we<00:02:20.310> didn't<00:02:20.519> have<00:02:20.579> to<00:02:20.760> we<00:02:21.120> didn't<00:02:21.329> have

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:21.419 
because we didn't have to we didn't have

00:02:21.419 --> 00:02:23.629 
because we didn't have to we didn't have
to<00:02:21.510> mess<00:02:21.690> with<00:02:21.810> levees<00:02:22.169> and<00:02:22.199> levee<00:02:23.190> Gators

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:23.639 
to mess with levees and levee Gators

00:02:23.639 --> 00:02:25.699 
to mess with levees and levee Gators
just<00:02:23.910> we<00:02:24.209> could<00:02:24.359> take<00:02:24.570> and<00:02:24.870> zero<00:02:25.320> great<00:02:25.560> the

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
just we could take and zero great the

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:26.360 
just we could take and zero great the
field<00:02:25.919> make<00:02:26.100> it

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
field make it

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.149 
field make it
perfectly<00:02:26.700> flat<00:02:27.000> same<00:02:27.870> time<00:02:28.140> we<00:02:28.650> wanted<00:02:29.010> to

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:29.159 
perfectly flat same time we wanted to

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:30.979 
perfectly flat same time we wanted to
figure<00:02:29.940> out<00:02:30.120> how<00:02:30.269> we<00:02:30.330> can<00:02:30.599> make<00:02:30.750> this<00:02:30.930> better

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
figure out how we can make this better

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.860 
figure out how we can make this better
habitat<00:02:31.769> for<00:02:31.950> abducts<00:02:32.310> as<00:02:32.519> well<00:02:32.730> and<00:02:33.569> we<00:02:33.690> took

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
habitat for abducts as well and we took

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.809 
habitat for abducts as well and we took
zero<00:02:34.319> grading<00:02:34.709> went<00:02:34.920> to<00:02:35.010> another<00:02:35.190> step<00:02:35.580> and

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
zero grading went to another step and

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.539 
zero grading went to another step and
went<00:02:36.030> to<00:02:36.120> conservation<00:02:36.540> farming<00:02:37.470> and<00:02:37.799> and<00:02:38.400> the

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549 
went to conservation farming and and the

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:40.130 
went to conservation farming and and the
reason<00:02:38.700> was<00:02:38.970> I<00:02:39.150> want<00:02:39.330> to<00:02:39.390> find<00:02:39.780> out<00:02:39.900> ways<00:02:40.110> that

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
reason was I want to find out ways that

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.949 
reason was I want to find out ways that
we<00:02:40.319> can<00:02:40.560> save<00:02:40.769> on<00:02:41.069> field<00:02:41.730> repairs<00:02:42.390> and<00:02:42.720> labor

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
we can save on field repairs and labor

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.559 
we can save on field repairs and labor
and<00:02:43.319> also<00:02:43.680> get<00:02:43.860> the<00:02:43.980> crop<00:02:44.220> in<00:02:44.430> on<00:02:44.670> time<00:02:44.909> so<00:02:45.480> we

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
and also get the crop in on time so we

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:47.630 
and also get the crop in on time so we
can<00:02:45.659> get<00:02:45.840> it<00:02:45.959> out<00:02:46.110> on<00:02:46.319> time<00:02:46.560> we<00:02:47.489> use

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
can get it out on time we use

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.720 
can get it out on time we use
considerably<00:02:48.390> less<00:02:48.599> water<00:02:48.900> please<00:02:49.170> 0<00:02:49.409> greater

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730

considerably less water please 0 greater
vestments<00:02:50.730> been<00:02:50.909> about<00:02:51.060> 40%<00:02:51.750> I<00:02:52.019> think<00:02:52.530> that's

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
vestments been about 40% I think that's

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.170 
vestments been about 40% I think that's
a<00:02:52.860> that's<00:02:53.129> a<00:02:53.280> probably<00:02:53.670> a<00:02:53.730> minimum<00:02:54.060> number

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
a that's a probably a minimum number

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.630 
a that's a probably a minimum number
we've<00:02:54.480> also<00:02:54.659> put<00:02:55.049> in<00:02:55.170> back<00:02:55.980> in<00:02:56.159> the<00:02:56.220> 80s<00:02:56.519> and

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
we've also put in back in the 80s and

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.420 
we've also put in back in the 80s and
90s<00:02:56.849> we<00:02:57.659> put<00:02:57.840> in<00:02:57.959> Kel<00:02:58.319> water<00:02:58.530> recovery<00:02:58.890> systems

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
90s we put in Kel water recovery systems

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.130 
90s we put in Kel water recovery systems
so<00:02:59.609> we're<00:02:59.790> able<00:02:59.910> to<00:03:00.209> capture<00:03:00.480> all<00:03:00.780> our<00:03:00.930> water

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
so we're able to capture all our water

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.680 
so we're able to capture all our water
