just<00:00:02.040> looking<00:00:02.310> at<00:00:02.429> her<00:00:02.580> power<00:00:02.879> touch<00:00:03.210> motor

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:03.959 
just looking at her power touch motor

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.770 
just looking at her power touch motor
drive<00:00:04.529> board<00:00:05.629> was<00:00:06.629> coming<00:00:06.990> for<00:00:07.140> repair<00:00:07.730> this

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:08.780 
drive board was coming for repair this

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:13.850 
drive board was coming for repair this
umbilical<00:00:09.780> cable<00:00:11.870> was<00:00:12.870> open<00:00:13.230> circuited<00:00:13.769> it

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
umbilical cable was open circuited it

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.849 
umbilical cable was open circuited it
was<00:00:13.950> solve<00:00:14.460> the<00:00:14.610> red<00:00:15.509> and<00:00:15.780> the<00:00:15.990> green<00:00:16.230> wire<00:00:16.560> was

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
was solve the red and the green wire was

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.849 
was solve the red and the green wire was
open<00:00:17.130> circuit<00:00:17.550> so<00:00:17.580> we<00:00:18.449> soldered<00:00:18.869> those<00:00:19.080> but

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
open circuit so we soldered those but

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.900 
open circuit so we soldered those but
the<00:00:19.980> other<00:00:20.100> end<00:00:20.279> of<00:00:20.369> it<00:00:20.490> was<00:00:20.609> also<00:00:20.760> concerned

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:22.910 
the other end of it was also concerned

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.040 
the other end of it was also concerned
when<00:00:23.910> instead<00:00:24.150> inste<00:00:24.600> like<00:00:24.779> when<00:00:24.930> it's

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
when instead inste like when it's

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.220 
when instead inste like when it's
installed<00:00:25.199> it<00:00:25.680> bent<00:00:26.099> it<00:00:26.250> quite<00:00:26.460> a<00:00:26.490> sharp<00:00:26.760> angle

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:27.230 
installed it bent it quite a sharp angle

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.389 
installed it bent it quite a sharp angle
and<00:00:28.230> there<00:00:28.680> was<00:00:29.539> inside<00:00:30.539> this<00:00:31.009> 3.5<00:00:32.009> millimeter

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
and there was inside this 3.5 millimeter

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:39.790 
and there was inside this 3.5 millimeter
jack<00:00:33.230> there's<00:00:34.230> a<00:00:34.850> was<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:35.880> solder<00:00:36.329> bridge

yeah<00:00:43.170> that's<00:00:43.379> now<00:00:43.530> been<00:00:43.739> fixed

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.160 
yeah that's now been fixed

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.470 
yeah that's now been fixed
don't<00:00:47.160> be<00:00:47.250> certainly<00:00:47.610> thousand<00:00:48.030> created<00:00:48.329> of

don't be certainly thousand created of
the<00:00:48.510> problem<00:00:48.960> though<00:00:50.420> one<00:00:51.420> of<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.539> problems

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
the problem though one of the problems

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.119 
the problem though one of the problems
what<00:00:52.230> all<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.710> problems<00:00:53.070> are<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.879> relays

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
what all the problems are the relays

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:58.490 
what all the problems are the relays
internally<00:00:56.129> were<00:00:56.489> corroded<00:00:56.719> but<00:00:57.719> dissolved

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
internally were corroded but dissolved

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.790 
internally were corroded but dissolved
in<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.680> relays<00:00:59.010> and<00:00:59.340> just<00:01:00.530> getting<00:01:01.530> in<00:01:01.620> there

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
in the relays and just getting in there

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.830 
in the relays and just getting in there
with<00:01:01.859> a<00:01:01.980> bit<00:01:02.129> of<00:01:02.160> Emery<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:03.270> a<00:01:03.359> bit<00:01:03.539> of<00:01:03.629> light

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
with a bit of Emery and a bit of light

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.270 
with a bit of Emery and a bit of light
oil<00:01:04.080> that<00:01:04.409> sorted<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.890> problem<00:01:05.129> in<00:01:05.220> the

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
oil that sorted the problem in the

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:12.020 
oil that sorted the problem in the
relays<00:01:07.010> and<00:01:08.010> he<00:01:08.130> now<00:01:08.280> works<00:01:08.490> oh<00:01:09.000> I<00:01:09.930> also<00:01:11.030> little

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
relays and he now works oh I also little

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.899 
relays and he now works oh I also little
reset<00:01:12.510> switch<00:01:13.159> had<00:01:14.159> bad<00:01:14.460> continuity<00:01:16.909> so

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
reset switch had bad continuity so

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.820 
reset switch had bad continuity so
that's<00:01:18.090> now<00:01:18.270> been<00:01:18.450> replaced

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:23.830 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.280 

so<00:01:24.830> we<00:01:25.070> power<00:01:25.250> it<00:01:25.280> up<00:01:25.750> and<00:01:26.750> according<00:01:27.140> to<00:01:27.200> the

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
so we power it up and according to the

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.219 
so we power it up and according to the
manual<00:01:27.530> that<00:01:27.590> I've<00:01:27.830> downloaded<00:01:28.870> in<00:01:29.870> order<00:01:30.110> to

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
manual that I've downloaded in order to

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:33.010 
manual that I've downloaded in order to
associate<00:01:30.560> the<00:01:30.920> remote<00:01:31.159> control<00:01:31.840> you<00:01:32.840> just

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
associate the remote control you just

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.609 
associate the remote control you just
briefly<00:01:33.350> press<00:01:33.619> the<00:01:33.860> reset<00:01:34.430> button<00:01:35.500> turn<00:01:36.500> on

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
briefly press the reset button turn on

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:40.540 
briefly press the reset button turn on
the<00:01:36.680> remote<00:01:36.950> control<00:01:37.340> and<00:01:39.160> then<00:01:40.160> you<00:01:40.310> press

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:40.550 
the remote control and then you press

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:45.160 
the remote control and then you press
any<00:01:40.940> of<00:01:41.030> the<00:01:41.119> buttons<00:01:41.180> to<00:01:41.950> just<00:01:42.950> set<00:01:43.160> it<00:01:44.170> and

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
any of the buttons to just set it and

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.880 
any of the buttons to just set it and
that's<00:01:45.410> that<00:01:46.930> so<00:01:47.930> you<00:01:48.140> can<00:01:48.259> see<00:01:48.380> with<00:01:48.500> all<00:01:48.619> our

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
that's that so you can see with all our

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.219 
that's that so you can see with all our
Direction<00:01:49.430> control<00:01:49.790> back<00:01:50.000> this<00:01:50.360> board

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
Direction control back this board

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:52.930 
Direction control back this board
originally<00:01:51.500> came<00:01:51.890> in<00:01:52.070> for<00:01:52.220> repair<00:01:52.550> because<00:01:52.820> it

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:52.940 
originally came in for repair because it

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:58.150 
originally came in for repair because it
wasn't<00:01:53.659> turning<00:01:53.990> right<00:01:54.409> I<00:01:54.470> think<00:01:56.680> but<00:01:57.680> they

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:58.160 
wasn't turning right I think but they

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:03.670 
wasn't turning right I think but they
all<00:01:58.280> work<00:01:58.490> now<00:01:58.700> so<00:01:58.729> we<00:01:59.090> can<00:02:00.399> set<00:02:01.399> motor<00:02:02.680> forward

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
all work now so we can set motor forward

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.820 
all work now so we can set motor forward
and<00:02:03.830> backwards<00:02:05.080> the<00:02:06.080> other<00:02:06.229> motor<00:02:06.410> forward

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
and backwards the other motor forward

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:16.000 
and backwards the other motor forward
and<00:02:07.009> backwards<00:02:09.369> or<00:02:10.369> both<00:02:10.580> together<00:02:15.010> the

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
and backwards or both together the

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.250 
and backwards or both together the
problem<00:02:16.280> I've<00:02:16.340> got<00:02:16.370> now<00:02:16.670> is<00:02:17.120> if<00:02:17.300> we<00:02:17.480> unpowered

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
problem I've got now is if we unpowered

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:24.030 
problem I've got now is if we unpowered
it<00:02:18.850> so<00:02:19.850> it<00:02:19.940> goes<00:02:20.120> off<00:02:20.980> so<00:02:21.980> the<00:02:22.040> back<00:02:22.190> on<00:02:22.310> again

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
it so it goes off so the back on again

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.990 
it so it goes off so the back on again
with<00:02:25.040> the<00:02:25.130> remote<00:02:25.400> still<00:02:25.670> on<00:02:27.880> can't<00:02:28.880> do

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
with the remote still on can't do

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.120 
with the remote still on can't do
anything<00:02:29.180> doesn't<00:02:29.989> respond<00:02:30.350> it<00:02:30.769> does<00:02:30.950> not

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
anything doesn't respond it does not

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.880 
anything doesn't respond it does not
remember<00:02:31.400> the<00:02:31.610> code<00:02:31.940> for<00:02:32.180> the<00:02:32.329> remote<00:02:32.739> but<00:02:33.739> if

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
remember the code for the remote but if

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.870 
remember the code for the remote but if
we<00:02:33.980> press<00:02:34.190> the<00:02:34.340> reset<00:02:34.700> button<00:02:34.760> again<00:02:36.880> it'll

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
we press the reset button again it'll

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:43.810 
we press the reset button again it'll
learn<00:02:38.380> it<00:02:39.380> doesn't<00:02:39.950> remember<00:02:40.220> the<00:02:40.519> remote<00:02:42.820> now

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820 
learn it doesn't remember the remote now

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.400 
learn it doesn't remember the remote now
I<00:02:43.850> can<00:02:44.030> introduce<00:02:44.269> a<00:02:44.510> workaround<00:02:44.840> for<00:02:45.049> that<00:02:45.170> I

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
I can introduce a workaround for that I

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:46.810 
I can introduce a workaround for that I
can<00:02:45.650> just<00:02:45.829> make<00:02:45.950> it<00:02:46.010> so<00:02:46.190> when<00:02:46.310> you<00:02:46.430> power<00:02:46.670> this

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
can just make it so when you power this

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:50.949 
can just make it so when you power this
board<00:02:47.120> up<00:02:47.299> it<00:02:48.310> automatically<00:02:49.310> deserve<00:02:50.000> switch

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
board up it automatically deserve switch

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:55.720 
board up it automatically deserve switch
press<00:02:52.360> so<00:02:53.360> that<00:02:53.440> only<00:02:54.440> powers<00:02:54.829> up<00:02:55.010> soon<00:02:55.579> as<00:02:55.670> you

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
press so that only powers up soon as you

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.220 
press so that only powers up soon as you
press<00:02:55.910> one<00:02:56.060> it<00:02:56.150> until<00:02:56.510> you<00:02:56.570> know<00:02:56.660> you<00:02:57.049> just

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
press one it until you know you just

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.229 
press one it until you know you just
straight<00:02:57.470> away<00:02:57.590> but<00:02:58.160> I<00:02:58.340> don't<00:02:58.700> believe<00:02:59.150> we

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
straight away but I don't believe we

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:03.449 
straight away but I don't believe we
should<00:02:59.450> do<00:02:59.630> that<00:03:00.190> so<00:03:01.190> either<00:03:01.400> I<00:03:01.549> am

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
should do that so either I am

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:06.220 
should do that so either I am
programming<00:03:04.459> in<00:03:04.579> the<00:03:04.700> coding<00:03:05.450> incorrectly

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
programming in the coding incorrectly

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.110 
programming in the coding incorrectly
but<00:03:06.950> I<00:03:06.980> seem<00:03:07.220> to<00:03:07.250> have<00:03:07.340> tried<00:03:07.549> all<00:03:07.760> possible

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
but I seem to have tried all possible

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.300 
but I seem to have tried all possible
combinations<00:03:08.720> of<00:03:08.840> turning<00:03:09.829> it<00:03:09.920> off<00:03:10.070> and

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
combinations of turning it off and

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:11.830 
combinations of turning it off and
holding<00:03:10.640> the<00:03:10.730> button<00:03:10.880> down<00:03:11.030> powering<00:03:11.600> it<00:03:11.750> back

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
holding the button down powering it back

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:19.590 
holding the button down powering it back
up<00:03:11.989> again<00:03:14.739> but<00:03:16.180> not--but<00:03:17.239> to<00:03:17.690> won't<00:03:18.560> remember

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
up again but not--but to won't remember

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:30.699 
up again but not--but to won't remember
unless<00:03:20.600> I<00:03:20.780> just<00:03:20.989> do<00:03:21.350> that<00:03:23.470> let's<00:03:24.470> back<00:03:24.709> up

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:33.289 

so<00:03:31.709> that's<00:03:32.099> where<00:03:32.280> I<00:03:32.310> am<00:03:32.489> at<00:03:32.579> the<00:03:32.790> moment

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
so that's where I am at the moment

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:35.390 
so that's where I am at the moment
oh<00:03:33.329> and<00:03:33.540> I've<00:03:33.659> looked<00:03:33.840> the<00:03:34.140> actual<00:03:34.500> part<00:03:35.310> of

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
oh and I've looked the actual part of

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.830 
oh and I've looked the actual part of
the<00:03:35.489> circuit<00:03:35.819> that<00:03:35.849> remembers<00:03:36.299> the<00:03:36.390> code<00:03:36.599> for

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
the circuit that remembers the code for

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.500 
the circuit that remembers the code for
the<00:03:36.989> remote<00:03:37.200> appears<00:03:37.590> to<00:03:37.680> be<00:03:37.799> this<00:03:38.269> this<00:03:39.269> is

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
the remote appears to be this this is

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.300 
the remote appears to be this this is
serial<00:03:40.549> EEPROM<00:03:41.549> here<00:03:42.799> now<00:03:43.799> I've<00:03:43.950> briefly

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
serial EEPROM here now I've briefly

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:45.860 
serial EEPROM here now I've briefly
analyzed<00:03:44.670> that<00:03:44.939> I<00:03:45.090> can<00:03:45.209> see<00:03:45.329> the<00:03:45.450> data<00:03:45.569> going

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
analyzed that I can see the data going

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.750 
analyzed that I can see the data going
in<00:03:46.049> well<00:03:46.709> I<00:03:46.739> can<00:03:46.920> see<00:03:47.010> it<00:03:47.099> directly<00:03:47.220> going<00:03:47.459> into

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
in well I can see it directly going into

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.250 
in well I can see it directly going into
it<00:03:47.849> I've<00:03:47.970> done<00:03:48.120> one<00:03:48.329> who<00:03:48.420> did<00:03:48.599> it<00:03:48.720> yet<00:03:48.959> to<00:03:49.109> see

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
it I've done one who did it yet to see

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:50.390 
it I've done one who did it yet to see
if<00:03:49.319> there's<00:03:49.470> data<00:03:49.620> coming<00:03:49.859> out<00:03:50.040> but<00:03:50.220> that's

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
if there's data coming out but that's

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.440 
if there's data coming out but that's
where<00:03:50.609> I<00:03:50.640> am<00:03:50.790> at<00:03:50.939> the<00:03:51.000> moment<00:03:51.299> with<00:03:51.390> this

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
where I am at the moment with this

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:59.910 
where I am at the moment with this
circuit

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.980
