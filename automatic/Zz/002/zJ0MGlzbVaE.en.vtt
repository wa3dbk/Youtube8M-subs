00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.160
 so friends what is going on here and 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.990
 Welcome to a channel 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.220
 I want to introduce myself at first 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.000
 you because most of you are me 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.710
 not knowing 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.090
 and since I know for sure it is hardly 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.470
 an itch I have the right any 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.960
 end of the video so that you too 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:28.450
 a little fun I'll be in 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.910
 A few horns raushauen a future 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:32.920
 few weapons horns tips and tricks and 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:36.070
 also life coaches resp 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.960
 for commented comments and therefore 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.000
 I hope that you every now and then 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.710
 stop by and have a little fun yourself 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.230
 but that was enough again 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.620
 Template enjoys the video and stays 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.620
 relaxed 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.290
 who does not know you have one again 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.899
 short range smg and want opponents 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.100
 over a longer distance ignite and 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:58.840
 We will not hit your shot again 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.270
 Of course that's an annoying thing 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.850
 because you are wasting city and easy 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:06.040
 a little bit around but says you can do it 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:09.070
 make easy better and that you 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:11.469
 just keep packing the ball 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.060
 These are extremely accurate weapon with the 

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:14.409
 you can also over half the card easily 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.249
 can attract opponents as you can in the here 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:17.380
 example can see 

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:20.020
 this is extremely effective against windows 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.869
 and helps us with the last endes 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.130
 easier but lasts moment before 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:25.659
 you can be happy too soon you can 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.639
 of course, how much in the game 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:31.060
 could easily even in the 

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:32.319
 if you can take advantage of this 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.659
 you only need one to make it 

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:36.609
 great with a sign and holidays 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:38.740
 as soon as the calorific values ​​are simply yours 

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:41.380
 sign on and everyone and left one sees 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.090
 someone is being cured that is very 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.369
 helpful because the enemy thinks the film 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.240
 hurt and shut the sheet in the 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:50.679
 fight can turn very quickly 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.529
 next , I will be happy to show you 

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:54.639
 how to use a sn you grenade launcher 

00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:56.770
 easy objects can jump 

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:58.569
 surely some hey are wondering now 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.029
 what does he want with it but I'm in 

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:02.889
 Last time noticed otherwise like that with 

00:02:01.029 --> 00:02:04.539
 the workbench upgrade like that very 

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:06.569
 everything has won with the 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:08.440
 relaunch 

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:10.500
 but I do not have many people yet 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.260
 I've seen that use that 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.810
 I thought alas it comes in times 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.370
 jump the following two clips content 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.950
 about smaller objects that are like that 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.350
 jump with a horny ass waiting like that 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.030
 as I call it so relatively easy too 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.100
 realize 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.480
 works a subject car after all, but is 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.209
 it took me the yellow of the egg time 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:33.180
 just a lot better 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:35.580
 next clips enteilt jump with mode 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.490
 can let play stop objects and 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.740
 houses are relatively heavy 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.570
 hinzukriegen requires some exercise but 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:45.350
 you get it is it already 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.350
 pretty close 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.780
 These jumps can fight some 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.100
 just give a good turn because of the 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.420
 opponent leads you safely and you jump 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.489
 the week about an object because many 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.230
 people do not know these and 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:59.250
 thus opponents could be very relative 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.600
 switch off easily and that 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.600
 Use surprise moment for you 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.110
 Next, before we get to the theoretical 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.730
 I want to get you part of the video 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.280
 still show how to be soldier and tank 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.840
 properly charged because I very often will 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.760
 let the elf panic if bavaria 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.110
 But instead you should come 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.000
 I'd rather take a look around 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.739
 is indeed times one second time also come 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.260
 somewhere a hill or a hill is 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:23.370
 or something the tank easy 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.549
 could put it out of action 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.920
 in the family a cliff where I the 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:30.110
 mountain will let down 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:33.840
 I do not think so often 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:36.600
 often finds its wings or a car 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:39.570
 or something that just is not 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:41.220
 and there is the physics of the game 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.600
 First time on your side because that will 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.650
 Simply the tank completely disassembled the 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.209
 can you believe me there 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.060
 do not worry about anything 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:49.069
 Oddly kick 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.660
 Last but not least we come to the sooner 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:54.080
 theoretical part of the video and indeed 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:56.330
 the right skill he is new 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.830
 interested players because battlefield 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:00.380
 Heroes is just so structured that the 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:03.200
 skills partly not proportional 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.610
 but sometimes one of you 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.130
 certain level benefits more 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:08.959
 others to understand that what I made 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:11.440
 show my example and that with reference 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:14.180
 from lag is the ability of ghana 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.810
 at level 1, it stops for four seconds 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:19.220
 and has a cool 15 seconds 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:21.650
 level 2 does nothing more than that 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.960
 duration by one second to increase what 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:26.900
 We are called that through a picture point 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.729
 effectively only one second win and 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.290
 now want the next level as 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:32.090
 We with three increase the duration by two 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:33.080
 seconds and reduces the customer 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:35.210
 two seconds 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.010
 what is an effective profit of 4 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.570
 points brings to that one an absolute 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:40.820
 number is natural to me 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:42.560
 Clear that you should not do that 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:44.300
 but make it easier to understand 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.919
 is so again with you immediately on 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:49.490
 a look sees that we just in 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:50.780
 have much higher profit level 4 there 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.380
 again only a win of 2 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.390
 points 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.010
 but now comes the special of 5 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:57.500
 gives you a win of 6 points 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:59.180
 which is very strong and therefore recommend 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:02.110
 I give you this skill level 3 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:04.490
 or at level 15 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.810
 Now follows a table with all 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:08.720
 Skills I follow the principle 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:10.160
 have always right listed the level 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.840
 on which it is worth this ability 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.130
 play 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:14.630
 and yes those who might be interested 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:16.400
 that pause videos and now rest 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:19.720
 watch and the others can stop 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.720
 simply 500 is imaginable 

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:26.149
 that was it for that again 

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:28.739
 video this time i hope you had fun 

00:05:26.149 --> 00:05:30.779
 wish you a pleasant week and 

00:05:28.739 --> 00:05:32.309
 I want to express my thanks 

00:05:30.779 --> 00:05:35.039
 I stood in the video very good at 

00:05:32.309 --> 00:05:38.330
 otherwise see you at 

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:38.330
 next video purely
