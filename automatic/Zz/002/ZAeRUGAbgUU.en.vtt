thing<00:00:38.579> about<00:00:38.610> this<00:00:38.850> unit<00:00:39.059> Rick

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
thing about this unit Rick

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.479 
thing about this unit Rick
it<00:00:39.540> runs<00:00:39.840> on<00:00:39.960> 240<00:00:40.440> volt<00:00:40.649> pounds<00:00:41.040> so<00:00:41.219> that<00:00:41.250> means

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
it runs on 240 volt pounds so that means

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.459 
it runs on 240 volt pounds so that means
it's<00:00:41.700> extremely<00:00:42.239> energy<00:00:42.540> efficient<00:00:42.930> and<00:00:43.050> not

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
it's extremely energy efficient and not

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.889 
it's extremely energy efficient and not
only<00:00:43.590> that<00:00:43.739> it's<00:00:44.280> easy<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:44.789> install<00:00:45.059> it'll<00:00:45.719> fit

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899
