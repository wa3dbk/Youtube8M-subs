00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
one thing that every single judge looks

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.100 
one thing that every single judge looks
at<00:00:31.650> is<00:00:31.949> their<00:00:32.160> teeth<00:00:32.430> and<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:33.420> last<00:00:33.660> thing<00:00:33.930> you

want<00:00:34.320> to<00:00:34.410> do<00:00:34.559> is<00:00:34.739> start<00:00:35.100> off<00:00:35.190> with<00:00:35.430> a<00:00:35.460> bad

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
want to do is start off with a bad

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:48.459 
want to do is start off with a bad
impression<00:00:36.090> of<00:00:37.020> having<00:00:37.350> dirty<00:00:37.860> teeth

00:00:48.459 --> 00:00:48.469 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:52.240 

I<00:00:48.500> don't<00:00:49.070> think<00:00:49.129> it's<00:00:49.460> that<00:00:49.550> hard<00:00:51.010> this<00:00:52.010> dog

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
I don't think it's that hard this dog

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.630 
I don't think it's that hard this dog
had<00:00:52.430> this<00:00:52.579> fire<00:00:53.149> a<00:00:53.989> little<00:00:54.199> warm<00:00:54.500> so<00:00:54.829> he's

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
had this fire a little warm so he's

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.610 
had this fire a little warm so he's
behaving<00:00:56.089> I<00:00:56.449> think<00:00:56.960> you<00:00:57.079> do<00:00:57.230> it<00:00:57.350> a<00:00:57.379> couple

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
behaving I think you do it a couple

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.139 
behaving I think you do it a couple
times<00:00:57.920> and<00:00:58.159> they<00:00:58.280> pretty<00:00:58.460> much<00:00:58.579> learn<00:00:58.940> it

00:00:59.139 --> 00:00:59.149 
times and they pretty much learn it

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:02.500 
times and they pretty much learn it
doesn't<00:00:59.510> hurt<00:00:59.809> it's<00:01:00.710> I<00:01:01.250> let<00:01:02.059> him<00:01:02.180> keep<00:01:02.300> their

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
doesn't hurt it's I let him keep their

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.210 
doesn't hurt it's I let him keep their
mouth<00:01:02.690> up<00:01:02.899> in<00:01:03.050> a<00:01:03.110> pant<00:01:03.440> while<00:01:03.710> I'm<00:01:03.829> doing<00:01:04.129> it

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 
mouth up in a pant while I'm doing it

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.730 
mouth up in a pant while I'm doing it
which<00:01:04.400> actually<00:01:04.820> helps<00:01:05.540> me<00:01:05.630> get<00:01:06.020> those<00:01:06.350> very

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
which actually helps me get those very

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.260 
which actually helps me get those very
back<00:01:07.040> teeth<00:01:09.369> because<00:01:10.369> I<00:01:10.640> actually<00:01:10.850> had<00:01:11.149> my

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
back teeth because I actually had my

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.719 
back teeth because I actually had my
finger<00:01:11.720> in<00:01:12.320> on<00:01:12.470> this<00:01:12.680> side<00:01:12.890> of<00:01:13.070> this<00:01:13.130> mantel<00:01:13.549> to

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
finger in on this side of this mantel to

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:18.480 
finger in on this side of this mantel to
keep<00:01:14.180> it<00:01:14.330> open<00:01:14.590> that's<00:01:15.590> kind<00:01:15.890> of<00:01:15.920> how<00:01:16.070> I<00:01:16.130> do<00:01:16.280> it

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
keep it open that's kind of how I do it

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:36.690 
keep it open that's kind of how I do it
in<00:01:19.490> there

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.580 

and<00:01:37.150> I<00:01:37.240> usually<00:01:37.420> wipe<00:01:37.780> it<00:01:37.930> off<00:01:38.049> with<00:01:38.229> the<00:01:38.320> towel

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
and I usually wipe it off with the towel

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.840 
and I usually wipe it off with the towel
so<00:01:39.400> I<00:01:39.460> can<00:01:39.640> kind<00:01:39.880> of<00:01:39.939> see<00:01:40.180> where<00:01:40.390> it<00:01:41.610> gets<00:01:42.610> kind

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
so I can kind of see where it gets kind

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:49.859 
so I can kind of see where it gets kind
of<00:01:42.939> funky<00:01:43.360> in<00:01:43.450> there<00:01:43.659> and<00:01:48.149> this<00:01:49.149> is<00:01:49.390> one<00:01:49.630> thing

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:49.869
