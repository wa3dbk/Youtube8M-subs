going<00:00:04.140> to<00:00:04.200> discuss<00:00:04.620> two<00:00:05.069> modifications<00:00:05.970> I've

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
going to discuss two modifications I've

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
best way to look at your current is with

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.649 
best way to look at your current is with
an<00:01:21.720> ammeter<00:01:21.990> installed<00:01:22.590> in<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.799> car<00:01:23.040> and

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
an ammeter installed in the car and

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:27.249 
an ammeter installed in the car and
watch<00:01:24.659> what<00:01:24.990> happens<00:01:25.409> when<00:01:25.650> you<00:01:25.740> accelerate

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
watch what happens when you accelerate

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:30.590 
watch what happens when you accelerate
that<00:01:28.259> way<00:01:28.409> you<00:01:28.470> can<00:01:28.770> decide<00:01:29.090> based<00:01:30.090> on<00:01:30.299> traffic

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
that way you can decide based on traffic

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.670 
that way you can decide based on traffic
and<00:01:31.310> how<00:01:32.310> far<00:01:32.549> you've<00:01:33.000> got<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.299> go<00:01:33.560> whether<00:01:34.560> you

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
and how far you've got to go whether you

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.120 
and how far you've got to go whether you
can<00:01:34.860> gun<00:01:35.100> it<00:01:35.250> or<00:01:35.369> not<00:01:36.439> let's<00:01:37.439> take<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.860> point

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
can gun it or not let's take the point

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.679 
can gun it or not let's take the point
at<00:01:38.400> which<00:01:38.549> withdrawing<00:01:39.329> 130<00:01:40.140> amps<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:41.299> add<00:01:42.299> a

at which withdrawing 130 amps and add a

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.670 
at which withdrawing 130 amps and add a
30<00:01:43.259> amp<00:01:43.500> battery<00:01:44.509> that<00:01:45.509> reduces<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.470> current

above<00:02:29.640> 30<00:02:29.970> miles<00:02:30.210> an<00:02:30.420> hour<00:02:31.040> I've<00:02:32.040> added<00:02:32.250> a

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
above 30 miles an hour I've added a

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.970 
above 30 miles an hour I've added a
switch<00:02:33.170> to<00:02:34.170> switch<00:02:34.530> it<00:02:34.680> in<00:02:35.930> it's<00:02:36.930> a<00:02:37.260> boat<00:02:37.590> type

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
switch to switch it in it's a boat type

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:44.630 
switch to switch it in it's a boat type
battery<00:02:39.050> selector<00:02:40.050> switch<00:02:40.320> and<00:02:43.280> I've<00:02:44.280> wired

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
battery selector switch and I've wired

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.980 
battery selector switch and I've wired
it<00:02:44.970> so<00:02:45.390> that<00:02:45.660> the<00:02:47.150> selection<00:02:48.150> can<00:02:48.480> either<00:02:48.630> be

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
it so that the selection can either be

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:54.620 
it so that the selection can either be
the<00:02:49.200> main<00:02:49.440> bank<00:02:49.940> in<00:02:50.940> position<00:02:51.510> one<00:02:52.880> this<00:02:53.880> the

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
the main bank in position one this the

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.020 
the main bank in position one this the
three<00:02:54.900> in<00:02:54.990> the<00:02:55.080> middle<00:02:55.170> there<00:02:55.470> are<00:02:55.620> the

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
three in the middle there are the

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.980 
three in the middle there are the
batteries<00:02:57.030> that<00:02:57.060> are<00:02:57.270> in<00:02:57.330> the<00:02:57.450> tunnel<00:02:57.810> in<00:02:57.900> the

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
batteries that are in the tunnel in the

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.530 
batteries that are in the tunnel in the
middle<00:02:58.020> of<00:02:58.230> the<00:02:58.320> car<00:02:59.180> and<00:03:00.180> the<00:03:00.270> one<00:03:00.420> on<00:03:00.450> the

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
middle of the car and the one on the

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.050 
middle of the car and the one on the
right<00:03:00.750> here<00:03:01.140> is<00:03:01.320> the<00:03:01.410> extra<00:03:02.370> battery<00:03:02.820> which<00:03:03.030> is

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
right here is the extra battery which is

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:08.449 
right here is the extra battery which is
behind<00:03:03.420> the<00:03:03.860> passenger<00:03:04.860> seat<00:03:06.860> so<00:03:07.860> to<00:03:07.920> recap

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
behind the passenger seat so to recap

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.330 
behind the passenger seat so to recap
this<00:03:08.850> is<00:03:09.090> switched<00:03:09.390> in<00:03:09.830> once<00:03:10.830> we're<00:03:11.040> up<00:03:11.130> to

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
this is switched in once we're up to

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.550 
this is switched in once we're up to
speed<00:03:11.489> and<00:03:12.300> the<00:03:12.540> voltage<00:03:12.870> has<00:03:13.019> started<00:03:13.440> to

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
speed and the voltage has started to

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.030 
speed and the voltage has started to
drop<00:03:14.420> lift<00:03:15.420> up<00:03:15.600> on<00:03:15.780> the<00:03:15.900> throttle<00:03:16.140> switch<00:03:16.709> to

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
drop lift up on the throttle switch to

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.780 
drop lift up on the throttle switch to
position<00:03:17.220> to<00:03:18.290> lift<00:03:19.290> up<00:03:19.560> again<00:03:19.890> I<00:03:20.160> switch<00:03:20.519> back

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
position to lift up again I switch back

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.170 
position to lift up again I switch back
to<00:03:20.820> one<00:03:21.180> when<00:03:21.780> we're<00:03:21.930> slowing<00:03:22.170> down<00:03:23.180> just

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
to one when we're slowing down just

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.479 
to one when we're slowing down just
position<00:03:24.600> my<00:03:24.780> little<00:03:25.050> electric<00:03:25.709> eel<00:03:25.890> here<00:03:26.220> and

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
position my little electric eel here and

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:41.570 
position my little electric eel here and
I'll<00:03:26.760> be<00:03:26.940> off

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:55.660
