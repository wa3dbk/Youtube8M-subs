00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:07.230
 friends, hello here, just woke up 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:12.420
 lined up good troops 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:14.309
 decided to attack this thing 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.800
 cool when not sitting and waiting when 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:23.699
 troops build up so at the sound disconnect 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:29.729
 sounds are generally so pretty enough 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:33.420
 it turned out so whom I sharpen 

00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:37.379
 here to me a friend went grasses and lower 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:40.769
 I decided on him to break in 30 helicopters three 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:43.230
 Type have three hero hero truth have all 

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:46.559
 so they stood for improvement 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.629
 weak they quickly kill 7 arson 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:52.350
 and drag rings 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:55.320
 2 cryobombs and in the lobby I have a cyborg barely 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.149
 lived sat well let's see what 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.129
 it turned out but the only syringe as 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.609
 would never have thrown the helicopter anywhere 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.609
 flew 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:09.530
 comrade from the sky 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:22.080
 Here are these fashion honestly seems to me 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:29.280
 that they donâ€™t really work if 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:29.730
 the maximum is not pumped decided so 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.530
 Makar 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:34.800
 first helicopters let them hip 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.710
 and 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.270
 with cyborg she was a little later 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.160
 release because he is looking for and everything 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.220
 choped on my land 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.220
 the troops 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:52.920
 but here a syringe as if to say that 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:56.500
 by threw and here threw him left gone 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.920
 I do not have time to immediately look at 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.930
 everything 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:04.030
 I still have a cryobomb laptop 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:09.700
 head 7 7 seconds what works 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:12.850
 feeling less than 7 on the other 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:15.730
 hand she he freeze not only tesla 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:18.760
 and he also Jack Osaris fret and 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.980
 frostbite general cool 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:28.840
 then this 7 seconds seems not to 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:31.350
 hundred percent somehow a little very but base 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:35.770
 such is the 110 level in general 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:43.959
 decent base for 3 stars failed 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:47.770
 in a concise but on February 2 but normally in the form 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:50.560
 my hands he is quite weak yet 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:54.780
 pumping costs weapons improves therefore 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:57.100
 from him the crowds are so purely symbolic 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:03.580
 it was necessary here after all it was necessary 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:06.360
 spark the hall in a bad throw hepar this 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:10.450
 already from the town hall the troops went 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:13.000
 warhoons was throwing a hippo and would fit 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:16.989
 still there are 33 helicopters 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.430
 2 to 3 helicopters incorrectly thrown need 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:23.200
 it was on the bottom not to let anyone 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:25.080
 and builds to fit riding okay in 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:31.980
 Generally, this is also a good result. 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:31.980
 85 percent I saved him even at 86 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:40.780
 in general, with utrechka cool and 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.519
 It turned out the most normal thing that is not 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:46.930
 the troops did not expect anything woke up and went 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:48.549
 hone on well a day starts without 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:53.200
 twenty twelve just woke up 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:58.049
 immediately stick so that something like this 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.049
 Okay, friends, everybody, until we meet again
