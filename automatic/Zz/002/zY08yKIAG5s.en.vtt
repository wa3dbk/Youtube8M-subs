00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:08.040
 guys hello everyone would like to today with 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:11.099
 I already lost my own 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.630
 video sad melody arpeggios like her 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.170
 we asked to play 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:19.170
 and I would like to split the video into 2 parts 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:23.310
 today I will sort out the first part 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.529
 since the melody is very short 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.760
 but the game still eating but since she 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:31.019
 for beginners and so well let's start 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.420
 initially we clamp here such chord 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.670
 the fifth string on the second fret and the fourth 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:40.530
 the string on the fourth fret that is queen 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:46.460
 it turns out brute play always down then 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.460
 there are 6 5 4 3 strings 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:54.989
 bust here is 4 mint oy 4 6 5 4 3 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:03.640
 string 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:07.540
 lost like this then 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:11.400
 we shift this finger in the fret forward then 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:16.600
 there is a 3 fret this leave here 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:19.350
 It turns out here on the third fret 4 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:23.320
 the string is also on the fourth leg 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:26.740
 bust all the same 6 5 4 3 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:29.100
 he is busting everywhere here too 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.100
 like this 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.990
 losing it all four times here 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.500
 understandably 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:47.930
 then move this whole thing set here 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:51.170
 here we clamp 4 string remains also 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.659
 on the fourth fret and 5 string already on 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.659
 fifth fret 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:55.659
 about 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:06.820
 lose four times and pinch fifth 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:12.899
 the string on the seventh fret here is all 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:12.899
 left here 4 on also clamped on 7 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.640
 repeat again 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.590
 you 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.710
 what a sad chord isn't it 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:50.150
 in general it sounds super so lost here 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:54.020
 this composition is then all four times 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:57.670
 that is, change nothing 6 5 4 3 is all 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:03:01.930
 learned then we pinch the fourth string 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:08.240
 in the second fret, the open search is already underway 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:10.370
 6 6 strings and 4 3 2 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:12.120
 here at this place well, that is, at this 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.440
 tact and 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.440
 lost four times 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.730
 then on the first fret we clamp the second 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.730
 string 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.050
 I 'll lose four times too 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:36.680
 move the whole thing two frets forward 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:41.020
 that is, it turns out 2 strictly on the third 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.020
 fret 4 string on the fourth fret 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:53.170
 I'll show you slowly again 

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:53.170
 after this 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:19.609
 played and then bust the same bass 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:24.180
 sixth string 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:27.090
 bust here 3 2 1 just on the chord 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:29.240
 e m and i put it it is possible and not 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.240
 to put 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.810
 just kinda open 

00:04:38.249 --> 00:04:43.099
 I just put it somehow does nâ€™t sound like 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:49.620
 lost again showing slowly 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.250
 and 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:11.680
 This melody generally needs to be lost, but 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:14.349
 with a maximum speed like that 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.630
 You can she so spectacular sounds but 

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:19.270
 Initially, of course it does not work out 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:23.979
 train with little by little 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:28.150
 and that is slowly that is like this 

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:32.849
 farther after this is how they lost at 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:32.849
 chord well or just without mountain 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:40.250
 we clamp the first string on the 3rd fret 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:43.740
 third string on the fourth fret 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:51.319
 the second is not clamped brute force such 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:51.319
 all the same 6 3 2 1 strings playing 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:03.180
 then the first 3 first string clamped on 

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:05.770
 the third fret leave the third string 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:08.040
 move on fret further that is 5 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:08.040
 okay 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:18.220
 we all lose be four times all 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:20.020
 it is shifted by two frets forward then 

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:25.500
 there is obtained the first string on the fifth 

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:25.500
 fret the third string on the seventh fret 

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:30.900
 in the melody , tension grows 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:33.740
 very cool 

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:40.780
 I'll show you slowly again how it is 

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:40.780
 sounds like a thief give 

00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:05.880
 lost and then shift it all by two 

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:08.400
 fret here and clamp on the first fret oh 

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:08.819
 on the first fret the first string on the seventh 

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:11.490
 fret 

00:07:08.819 --> 00:07:12.919
 the second string on the eighth fret and the third 

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:16.430
 building in the ninth year 

00:07:12.919 --> 00:07:16.430
 ladder turns 

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:28.730
 here so from everything looks, let's again 

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:28.730
 slowly from this point we start 

00:07:43.069 --> 00:07:48.240
 but so everything seems clear guys if 

00:07:46.319 --> 00:07:52.469
 I liked not to complicate and deliver 

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:56.330
 class here is such a thick class dress 

00:07:52.469 --> 00:07:56.330
 thanks for watching subscribe
