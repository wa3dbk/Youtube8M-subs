00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
of the troll moves that Blizzard is

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.300 
of the troll moves that Blizzard is
doing<00:01:54.509> I<00:01:54.689> would<00:01:55.439> imagine<00:01:55.649> there's<00:01:55.979> probably<00:01:56.219> a

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
doing I would imagine there's probably a

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.099 
doing I would imagine there's probably a
lot<00:01:56.399> of<00:01:56.520> coverage<00:01:56.820> on<00:01:56.969> this<00:01:57.119> as<00:01:57.329> well<00:01:57.539> but<00:01:57.810> I

00:01:58.099 --> 00:01:58.109 
lot of coverage on this as well but I

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:59.779 
lot of coverage on this as well but I
just<00:01:58.380> thought<00:01:58.500> I'd<00:01:58.710> show<00:01:58.740> you<00:01:58.950> it<00:01:59.100> as<00:01:59.219> well

00:01:59.779 --> 00:01:59.789 
just thought I'd show you it as well

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:01.580 
just thought I'd show you it as well
it<00:02:00.060> just<00:02:00.420> we<00:02:00.630> were<00:02:00.750> searching<00:02:00.960> for<00:02:01.140> goblins

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
it just we were searching for goblins

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.260 
it just we were searching for goblins
for<00:02:01.770> hours<00:02:02.189> I<00:02:02.369> think<00:02:02.549> we<00:02:02.640> went<00:02:02.759> through<00:02:03.060> about

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
for hours I think we went through about

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.410 
for hours I think we went through about
30<00:02:04.259> for<00:02:04.979> it<00:02:05.189> goblins<00:02:05.579> we<00:02:05.789> didn't<00:02:06.119> go

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
30 for it goblins we didn't go
