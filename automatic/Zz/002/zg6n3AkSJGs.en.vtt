00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
for so you know you could say that love

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.420 
for so you know you could say that love
that<00:01:27.900> neighbor<00:01:28.080> is<00:01:28.229> metaphorical<00:01:28.920> in<00:01:29.250> which

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
that neighbor is metaphorical in which

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.210 
that neighbor is metaphorical in which
case<00:01:29.700> it's<00:01:30.450> kind<00:01:30.659> of<00:01:30.750> lost<00:01:30.930> its<00:01:31.140> impact<00:01:31.500> if<00:01:31.740> it

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
case it's kind of lost its impact if it

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.469 
case it's kind of lost its impact if it
means<00:01:32.430> just<00:01:32.759> to<00:01:32.909> be<00:01:33.030> good<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.329> one<00:01:33.360> another

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
means just to be good to one another

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:34.850 
means just to be good to one another
then<00:01:33.900> I'm<00:01:34.110> not<00:01:34.380> impressed<00:01:34.590> with<00:01:34.829> that
