00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:22.630
 ways to reset the phone the 

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:27.520
 first is the soft one that is called soft 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:30.419
 reset that is done on entering the 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.419

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.310
 I will explain how to do the 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.550

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.280
 you can not enter the phone 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:47.129
 have a password or the phone is 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.500
 turning on correctly you can try 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:53.050
 the software and being and that's going to make 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.660
 the phone starts 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.770
 like when you first buy it for 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.250
 that the phone starts working 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:03.010
 correctly again although we're going to 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:05.470
 start with the software and set 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:08.990
 then you have to look for the 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:13.119
 Application settings 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.119
 and here you are going to look for configuration 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:20.170
 ok then here we are going to look 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:24.630

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.630

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.189
 although it is the option to make a copy of 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.380

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.860
 press where it says reset values 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.860

 and here we are going to press where it says 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:50.860

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:53.500

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:57.460
 the phone is completely erased 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:59.220

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:04.170
 factory when he first bought it 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:07.120
