him<00:00:54.420> start<00:00:54.870> nuking<00:00:55.199> him<00:00:55.350> and<00:00:55.920> some<00:00:56.370> reason<00:00:56.610> I

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
him start nuking him and some reason I

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.110 
him start nuking him and some reason I

could knock backed way far away from him

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.209

so just have to keep running for it use
all<00:06:33.099> my<00:06:33.279> abilities<00:06:33.399> to<00:06:33.969> keep<00:06:34.929> immobilizing

00:06:35.579 --> 00:06:35.589 
all my abilities to keep immobilizing

00:06:35.589 --> 00:06:39.149 
all my abilities to keep immobilizing
keep<00:06:36.369> trying<00:06:36.610> to<00:06:36.759> shoot<00:06:37.599> them<00:06:37.839> do<00:06:38.679> anything<00:06:39.069> I

can to survive and the heel from smart

00:06:41.289 --> 00:06:43.379 
can to survive and the heel from smart
condition<00:06:41.649> is<00:06:41.769> regal<00:06:42.099> I<00:06:42.249> say<00:06:42.489> over<00:06:42.639> here<00:06:42.819> along

00:06:43.379 --> 00:06:43.389 
condition is regal I say over here along

00:06:43.389 --> 00:06:47.879 
condition is regal I say over here along
with<00:06:43.419> its<00:06:43.659> short<00:06:43.839> Coulomb<00:06:46.559> actually<00:06:47.559> managed

they can't damage me that much from Rick
my<00:06:52.569> not<00:06:52.749> back<00:06:52.899> comes<00:06:53.079> back<00:06:53.259> up<00:06:53.439> so<00:06:53.649> I<00:06:53.709> used<00:06:53.919> that

00:06:53.999 --> 00:06:54.009 
my not back comes back up so I used that

00:06:54.009 --> 00:06:56.299 
my not back comes back up so I used that
to<00:06:54.369> get<00:06:54.459> into<00:06:54.610> momentum<00:06:54.819> some<00:06:55.240> distance<00:06:55.629> and

00:06:56.299 --> 00:06:56.309 
to get into momentum some distance and

00:06:56.309 --> 00:06:59.149 
to get into momentum some distance and
keep<00:06:57.309> running<00:06:57.610> for<00:06:57.759> my<00:06:57.849> heel<00:06:57.999> to<00:06:58.119> come<00:06:58.240> back<00:06:58.389> up

keep running for my heel to come back up
it's<00:07:00.159> almost<00:07:00.309> back<00:07:00.610> up<00:07:00.819> immobilize<00:07:01.689> him<00:07:01.809> just

00:07:02.069 --> 00:07:02.079 
it's almost back up immobilize him just

00:07:02.079 --> 00:07:04.919 
it's almost back up immobilize him just
