00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:15.360
 hello everything is so blue with blue in the frame 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.830
 because the box from bench has 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:22.439
 such a blue blue of some color and 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:25.500
 bench has a model in this box 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:28.079
 556 mini griptilian in general 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:33.000
 quite classic so let's say 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:37.670
 popular knife modification cost 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:41.899
 its somewhere around 85 dollars on 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:45.089
 in the USA and this modification itself 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:47.489
 mini griptilian and she completely 

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:49.820
 repeats but still unknown truth who 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:53.539
 who repeats completely repeats 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:55.829
 big-big griptilian a and 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:59.129
 surprisingly what's really his 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:02.159
 here and a smaller notch and in general 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.860
 then all all all lock in these forces 

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:07.670
 liners all that is done externally at first 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.410
 a glance everything is just a smaller copy 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:13.290
 big griptilian and besides perhaps 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:14.700
 clips clip remained the same 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.680
 in my opinion she looks like something 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.780
 that is, clip as compared to 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.110
 Dimensions clicking looks some well 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.870
 just huge though maybe i'm small 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.940
 folding small knives with a clip 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:29.520
 held in your hands so maybe in this 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:32.220
 caused such a misunderstanding a little 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.380
 This clip, although it is quite comfortable 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.240
 measure tenaciously quite stand at her 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.200
 almost no coverage 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:42.450
 and the ergonomics of this knife are very very 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.190
 A good level is felt here with these 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.620
 one side tenacious notches on the other 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.160
 side very serious some kind of power 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.700
 work 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:52.530
 Of course, this small knife 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:57.180
 do not have to attach to it but 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.950
 quite so reasonable that you can to him 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.670
 attach i think he can handle without 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:05.460
 any labor more goes here 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.640
 folding handle very convenient lock 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.840
 which allows 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.319
 made some money 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.950
 which allows you to knife very easily 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:18.269
 itâ€™s easy to take shape and 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.310
 decompose axis lock is very 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:23.250
 convenient lock I have lost the bit of it 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.200
 as you can see here actually clip 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.599
 rearranged on two sides for lefties 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.379
 for right handed but only with a position like 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:32.220
 at the tips 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:33.209
 upwards directly bitch 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.090
 made griptilian 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:37.769
 I talked in some detail on my own 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.200
 one of the videos therefore will not 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:42.690
 dwell on the history of the company 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.420
 not about some features in general 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:48.060
 models will tell you more about 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.640
 this knife this knife made me 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.819
 certain impression and very 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.459
 positive it is qualitatively assembled as 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:59.250
 many owners of both knives big 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:01.799
 griptilian a and here's a little paid 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.959
 attention to the fact that liners are 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:06.299
 are inside the knife in small 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:08.910
 reptile no they are not cut and go on 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:10.980
 the entire length of the handle, respectively 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.849
 the handle turns out very much like that 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.459
 solid 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:17.540
 monolithic and in itself design 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:19.459
 This small knife is very, very 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.500
 nice and impress 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:27.359
 quality is such a good thing 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:30.769
 and if we talk about its dimensions, this is our 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:34.040
 boxes if we talk about dimensions 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:34.040
 this knife 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:44.069
 jumps then the total length is 170 170 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:46.109
 mm length of blade somewhere in time 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:48.690
 seventy three millimeters going on 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:52.049
 cutting edge which are not 70 can be 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:55.560
 71 mm is what I see myself 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:59.519
 Now I measured his butt with me 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:03.000
 It turned out 2 and 4 millimeters on the butt of 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:05.310
 see our very very thin 03 04 in this 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:11.069
 parts and closer to the tip somewhere in the area 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:15.180
 0 5 that is information thin steel 154 7 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:16.470
 very good studying quite in moderation 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:20.880
 rack 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:23.070
 the designer of this knife is listed on the wedge 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.920
 and proper 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:28.440
 In general, in general, and this knife to me 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:31.140
 really liked extremely 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.510
 among the little knives but I don't know he 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:36.090
 produced me at once excellent 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:38.700
 the impression he did not really like but 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:42.710
 if you compare it with such a knife x 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:48.210
 gift manix for example is perfectly visible 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:51.330
 as far as cutting edge practically 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:54.510
 almost comparable but how much 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:56.490
 it will be more convenient in terms of wearing on your pocket 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:58.830
 in terms of use as 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:05.190
 some small go hay 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:07.800
 This is indeed Odessa knife his weight under 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:10.680
 all-metal such design 76 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:15.060
 gram which is quite a bit completely not 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:15.870
 detracts pocket does not interfere and with such 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:19.740
 by drawing 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:20.780
 geometry mixing great shapes then 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.610
 there is a wedge 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:26.340
 has a rather classic look and not 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:29.580
 everyone will like the design of some 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:32.390
 there is a spider to the same military 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:35.790
 sometimes people have complaints about 

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:40.440
 the very appearance of the wreath is here 

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:45.780
 all that is in the framework of generally accepted norms 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:48.510
 and it looks just fine but here 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:51.740
 plastic handle ie this is nobody's 10 

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:55.470
 but this is not a small problem all the more 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:58.310
 some special flaws with this plastic 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:06:00.960
 I could not find 

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:03.720
 regarding backlash well, minimal 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:05.490
 minimal some kind of spirit are present well 

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:08.190
 and by the way basically the only thing 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:10.860
 frustration that may overtake 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:13.290
 but this is not directly relevant 

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:16.740
 crypt leons their whole line is 

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:18.419
 regarding the lock, that is, the lock axis 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:20.280
 lock has springs 

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:23.940
 which quite often fail 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:25.390
 and at 710 bench we and the son of 390 which 

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:28.450
 was on my review to 

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:30.070
 not these springs themselves 

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:32.620
 first 1 then another 

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:35.380
 out of order have broken and now find 

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:36.940
 they are quite difficult that is to get with 

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:38.980
 acquiring them is now a problem 

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:41.890
 send the same knife under warranty but I think 

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:42.490
 everyone understands that it will be comparable to 

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:46.240
 at the cost of 

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:48.940
 new such a knife so it makes sense 

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:52.290
 there is practically no hope 

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:52.290
 interesting bye
