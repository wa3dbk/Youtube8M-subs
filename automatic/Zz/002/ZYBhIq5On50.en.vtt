health it's got before it dies it could

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.199 
health it's got before it dies it could
be<00:02:12.260> very<00:02:12.470> useful<00:02:12.530> not<00:02:13.310> just<00:02:13.340> in<00:02:13.610> this<00:02:13.760> mod<00:02:14.000> but

more now this would be really important

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:37.660 
more now this would be really important

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
it's important to note this because once

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.670 
it's important to note this because once
your<00:02:46.550> block<00:02:46.760> it<00:02:46.910> gets<00:02:47.120> up<00:02:47.269> to<00:02:47.300> level<00:02:47.660> 5<00:02:47.690> if<00:02:48.560> you

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
your block it gets up to level 5 if you

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
feed it a Golden Apple it'll suddenly

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:53.979 
feed it a Golden Apple it'll suddenly

version of the block it it doesn't look
quite<00:03:00.170> so<00:03:00.440> cute<00:03:00.769> but<00:03:01.640> it<00:03:01.730> does<00:03:01.970> do<00:03:02.180> a<00:03:02.209> lot<00:03:02.360> more

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:09.799 
level 5 and feed it a code with an apple

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:12.610 
level 5 and feed it a code with an apple
again<00:03:09.920> and<00:03:10.280> it<00:03:10.850> will<00:03:10.970> then<00:03:11.209> evolve<00:03:12.140> into<00:03:12.470> its

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
again and it will then evolve into its

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.530 
again and it will then evolve into its
final<00:03:12.860> form<00:03:13.190> and<00:03:13.430> this<00:03:14.060> one<00:03:14.209> has<00:03:14.360> a<00:03:14.390> nice

is<00:03:59.560> the<00:04:00.460> toughest<00:04:00.820> one<00:04:01.000> out<00:04:01.150> of<00:04:01.270> the<00:04:01.330> lot<00:04:01.540> but

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:01.990 
is the toughest one out of the lot but

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:03.030 
is the toughest one out of the lot but
it's<00:04:02.110> also<00:04:02.260> the<00:04:02.410> one<00:04:02.530> that<00:04:02.620> takes<00:04:02.740> the<00:04:02.860> longest

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
it's also the one that takes the longest

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.640 
it's also the one that takes the longest
to<00:04:03.460> level<00:04:03.790> up<00:04:03.910> the<00:04:04.690> gold<00:04:04.900> one<00:04:05.050> is<00:04:05.080> the<00:04:05.260> opposite

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
to level up the gold one is the opposite

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.140 
to level up the gold one is the opposite
it's<00:04:05.860> a<00:04:05.980> bit<00:04:06.100> more<00:04:06.220> squishy<00:04:06.550> in<00:04:06.730> the<00:04:06.820> beginning

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
it's a bit more squishy in the beginning

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.270 
it's a bit more squishy in the beginning
but<00:04:07.660> it<00:04:07.840> also<00:04:08.020> levels<00:04:08.500> up<00:04:08.680> much<00:04:08.860> quicker<00:04:09.130> so

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
but it also levels up much quicker so

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.250 
but it also levels up much quicker so
you<00:04:09.430> can<00:04:09.640> get<00:04:09.790> to<00:04:09.970> your<00:04:10.120> evolved<00:04:10.540> state<00:04:10.960> much

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
you can get to your evolved state much

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:12.930 
you can get to your evolved state much
quicker<00:04:11.500> than<00:04:11.740> you<00:04:11.830> would<00:04:11.860> normally<00:04:12.130> the

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
quicker than you would normally the

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.390 
quicker than you would normally the
would<00:04:13.180> one<00:04:13.420> is<00:04:13.810> very<00:04:14.380> vulnerable<00:04:14.560> to<00:04:14.890> fire

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
would one is very vulnerable to fire

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.280 
would one is very vulnerable to fire
it's<00:04:15.730> not<00:04:15.940> indestructible<00:04:16.329> by<00:04:16.900> anything

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:22.380 

probably<00:04:20.290> the<00:04:20.590> most<00:04:20.769> useful<00:04:21.549> one<00:04:21.970> out<00:04:22.120> of<00:04:22.270> the

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:22.390 
probably the most useful one out of the

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:26.880 
probably the most useful one out of the
lot<00:04:22.600> is<00:04:22.930> the<00:04:23.830> glowstone<00:04:24.460> block<00:04:25.150> it<00:04:25.560> now<00:04:26.560> if<00:04:26.740> you

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:26.890 
lot is the glowstone block it now if you

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:29.790 
lot is the glowstone block it now if you
do<00:04:27.040> a<00:04:27.070> lot<00:04:27.250> of<00:04:27.370> mining<00:04:27.760> you'll<00:04:28.690> know<00:04:28.930> that<00:04:29.260> it

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
do a lot of mining you'll know that it

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.090 
do a lot of mining you'll know that it
is<00:04:30.150> absolute<00:04:31.150> pain<00:04:31.420> having<00:04:31.870> to<00:04:31.990> make<00:04:32.200> torches

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.100 
is absolute pain having to make torches

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.100 
is absolute pain having to make torches
all<00:04:33.340> the<00:04:33.610> time<00:04:33.850> and<00:04:34.150> you're<00:04:34.570> having<00:04:34.810> to<00:04:34.870> put<00:04:34.990> it

all the time and you're having to put it
up<00:04:35.200> on<00:04:35.320> the<00:04:35.440> walls<00:04:35.650> every<00:04:36.070> few<00:04:36.280> steps<00:04:36.760> that<00:04:36.880> you

coal to make torches these guys just
light<00:05:00.970> up<00:05:01.180> the<00:05:01.419> mine<00:05:01.600> as<00:05:01.840> they<00:05:02.110> walk<00:05:02.320> because

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:02.620

so<00:05:06.130> that<00:05:06.850> is<00:05:07.000> the<00:05:07.180> block<00:05:07.390> it<00:05:07.570> mod<00:05:07.750> at<00:05:08.020> like<00:05:08.890> I

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.010 
so that is the block it mod at like I

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:10.890 
so that is the block it mod at like I
said<00:05:09.190> it's<00:05:09.400> probably<00:05:09.490> the<00:05:09.700> cutest<00:05:09.850> mod<00:05:10.510> I've

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900 
said it's probably the cutest mod I've

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:14.580

ever<00:05:11.110> seen<00:05:11.380> but<00:05:12.160> also<00:05:12.340> the<00:05:12.880> most<00:05:13.120> useful<00:05:13.500> and<00:05:14.500> I

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:14.590
