 I am now a small eatery 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.480
 such an olya korean restaurant 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.000
 the menu here is scant 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.250
 order some noodles now let's see 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:20.420

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:20.420

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.770

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.949

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:26.280
 You buy this dish as you choose 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:29.750
 the menu is one but these two are already 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.750
 bring in addition 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:43.119
 this dish turned out to be cold 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.820
 I do not know why they heat it because 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:48.340
 which is probably the heat on the street straight from 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.549
 refrigerator I did not try to explain what 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:53.440
 it needs to be heated but useless and 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:56.200
 nothing happened at all 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:59.200
 Generally there will be 10 explained to them so they 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:03.610
 did not understand what was happening Paris he another 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:07.110

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:14.599
 waiter 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:24.470
 although it is worth the pleasure 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:26.900
 yes you do this key and then this 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:31.190

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:34.100
 noodles here this cup of water is worth it all 6 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.890
 6 6 dollars why flash 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.000
 but ordered as usual here always 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.520
 only one dish 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.130

 Koreans who sit at the next table 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.750
 everyone eats exactly the same noodles as 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.380
 to accept 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.370
 It seems to me that this is the only dish in 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.370
 this eatery 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.150

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:01.310

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.260
 cold noodles on in general if you want 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:08.019
