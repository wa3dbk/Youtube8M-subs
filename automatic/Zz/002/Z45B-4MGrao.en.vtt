00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
we think it is important to have the

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.170 
we think it is important to have the
community<00:01:23.009> to<00:01:23.430> have<00:01:23.610> some<00:01:23.729> questions<00:01:24.119> that

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
community to have some questions that

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.149 
community to have some questions that

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.469 
they'd like to ask to Justin as well so
when<00:01:26.280> I'm<00:01:26.490> thinking<00:01:26.700> of<00:01:27.000> what<00:01:27.180> we<00:01:27.270> may

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
when I'm thinking of what we may

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.480 
when I'm thinking of what we may
possibly<00:01:27.720> do<00:01:28.170> is<00:01:28.380> split<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.799> interview<00:01:29.250> into

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
different sections of the game that we

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.590 
different sections of the game that we
do<00:01:40.979> potentially<00:01:41.520> know<00:01:41.700> about<00:01:41.970> and<00:01:42.240> maybe<00:01:42.390> can

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
find some more information out about I'm

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:45.530 
find some more information out about I'm
thinking<00:01:44.759> of<00:01:44.880> maybe<00:01:45.030> having<00:01:45.149> different

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
thinking of maybe having different

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.510 
thinking of maybe having different
sections<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.170> then<00:01:46.290> at<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:46.530> end<00:01:46.710> have<00:01:47.310> like<00:01:47.490> a

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
sections and then at the end have like a

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.999 
sections and then at the end have like a
community<00:01:48.000> question<00:01:48.930> quickfire<00:01:49.530> round<00:01:49.560> so<00:01:49.979> we

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
community question quickfire round so we

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
good question I would suggest keeping

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.450 
good question I would suggest keeping
away<00:02:04.079> from<00:02:04.110> questions<00:02:04.710> like<00:02:04.890> when's<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.340> game

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.249 
away from questions like when's the game
going<00:02:05.729> to<00:02:05.790> be<00:02:05.939> released<00:02:06.299> or<00:02:06.509> other<00:02:06.990> questions

going to be released or other questions

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.320 
going to be released or other questions
very<00:02:07.710> similar<00:02:08.099> to<00:02:08.280> are<00:02:08.729> we<00:02:08.879> going<00:02:09.090> to<00:02:09.179> be<00:02:09.270> able

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
very similar to are we going to be able

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.780 
very similar to are we going to be able

that<00:02:19.480> on<00:02:19.750> Twitter<00:02:20.110> and<00:02:20.410> I'm<00:02:20.770> sure<00:02:21.160> that<00:02:21.610> a<00:02:21.640> lot

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
that on Twitter and I'm sure that a lot

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.700 
that on Twitter and I'm sure that a lot
of<00:02:22.000> you<00:02:22.180> are<00:02:22.570> either<00:02:22.840> following<00:02:23.290> on<00:02:23.440> Twitter

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
so you will know about it when they do

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.880 
so you will know about it when they do
tweet<00:02:25.420> it<00:02:25.570> or<00:02:25.720> if<00:02:25.810> not<00:02:25.990> I<00:02:26.200> will<00:02:26.410> most<00:02:26.710> likely

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
tweet it or if not I will most likely

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.740 
tweet it or if not I will most likely
make<00:02:27.250> a<00:02:27.280> video<00:02:27.610> on<00:02:27.640> it<00:02:27.790> as<00:02:28.150> well<00:02:28.330> so<00:02:28.510> I'll<00:02:28.600> keep

make a video on it as well so I'll keep
away<00:02:28.960> from<00:02:28.990> questions<00:02:29.440> like<00:02:29.650> that<00:02:29.680> try<00:02:30.400> and

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
away from questions like that try and

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.870 
away from questions like that try and
have<00:02:30.640> a<00:02:30.820> unique<00:02:31.300> question<00:02:31.690> about<00:02:32.350> the<00:02:32.500> game
