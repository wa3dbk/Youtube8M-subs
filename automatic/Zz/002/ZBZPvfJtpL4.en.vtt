the reason we have my links today we
started<00:00:43.440> with<00:00:43.620> a<00:00:43.649> few<00:00:43.980> sketches<00:00:44.270> which<00:00:45.270> led<00:00:45.510> to

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
started with a few sketches which led to

plastic molds and eventually final

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.029 
plastic molds and eventually final
prototypes<00:00:48.420> we've<00:00:49.260> come<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.469> long<00:00:49.559> way<00:00:49.980> from

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
prototypes we've come a long way from

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.000 
prototypes we've come a long way from
the<00:00:50.370> first<00:00:50.579> prototype<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.449> last<00:00:52.010> we

the first prototype to the last we

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.799 
the first prototype to the last we
designed<00:00:53.399> a<00:00:53.520> class<00:00:53.789> that<00:00:54.210> hides<00:00:54.570> the
