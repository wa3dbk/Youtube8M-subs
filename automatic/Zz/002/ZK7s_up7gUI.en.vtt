00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 hello everyone today I want people 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.430
 show the next device which 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.550
 finished works 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.660
 namely for our laboratory since 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.799
 Our company is engaged in manufacturing 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.089
 motor oils for cars whether different 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.980
 so we have a big lab 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.560
 for this baths we produce 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.580
 various appliances and they check the oil 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.160
 on various properties 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.289
 This device is an external exception then 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.230
 manifest you and devices we chose 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.800
 apply them it's called appliances 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.230
 deans 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.270
 your electronics and yourself 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.790
 directly bath what is it 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.469
 banned why do I need this bath 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:42.180
 put in a test tube let's disconnect 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:44.309
 temperature sensor and open here you are 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.920
 see the grooves under them are not supplied 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:50.899
 test tubes inside this entire container 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:53.250
 oil is poured oil serves as a kind of bath 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:55.320
 this feigned device which only 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.210
 that showed should warm 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.260
 temperature ranging from a flock of rads to 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.270
 250 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.280
 dependencies how to set and maintain 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.140
 this temperature in the surface in one 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.619
 degree device works pretty 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.900
 for a long time to give him shut up 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:11.430
 about 99 hours we again 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.150
 dependencies which analysis and how is it 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:20.310
 you will expose therefore the device it has to be 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:21.920
 reliable it mixes up since 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.030
 oil is flammable 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.040
 250 degrees is a high pain 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.930
 temperature this unit is electronic 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.579
 should keep track of the temperature well 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.220
 any provide emergency 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.250
 situation, whether on the open Thule sensor 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.590
 stop shuffling 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.340
 Well , in all sorts of different situations 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.240
 let me show myself directly 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.240
 a blog 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.150
 but there is a keyboard for typing there are two 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:46.840
 input parameter one to set 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.420
 temperatures 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.979
 let's actually spend on 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.229
 indicators and heat 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:57.369
 below 50 years 11 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:58.440
 he will not give to ask only there more than 5058 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:01.060
 literature 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.810
 then give and set the time 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.790
 can be set 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:08.770
 from work hour to 99 we set 1 hour and 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:12.160
 We include all these two parameters of which 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.690
 works that I wanted to pay attention 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.790
 from those who design such allow 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.320
 all sorts of development and so on doing with 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.560
 what am I confronted with and it is no longer 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:23.070
 The first time I had to do all 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.660
 let's even open all the electronics and 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.040
 as you see still there are starters 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.780
 in one case 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.610
 this is a prerequisite you pol case 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.370
 must be metal explosive 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.980
 even his grounded ground kicked 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.720
 all well as all but in my opinion should be 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.950
 heviz faced 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.769
 despite the fact that I have a fee 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.900
 electronics even divorced even 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:46.600
 food costs movie forward to the ring 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.640
 special filters could and unleashed 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.970
 weekends that control starters 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.410
 Well, that is, everything is not unleashed at all 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.900
 I must have come across a very 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.980
 large interference from starters 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.079
 starter create very large interference 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.970
 though even raised heart on chain 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:05.079
 coil special without them generally kapets 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:07.120
 not working well you still crashes not 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:08.940
 the process itself the program hangs and 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.880
 it flies itself directly 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:15.420
 indicator let's demonstrate that 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:18.900
 Generally we start the analysis 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:21.959
 porridge is not always good 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.610
 analysis went to see aperture dialing 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:24.780
 until u get to 50 degrees he 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.329
 so will these dashes 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.079
 then all this trash will be shown this 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:30.030
 so retreat 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:32.750
 let's install us again 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:36.349
 imitate a moment that happens 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:39.180
 turn off something in the work all for now 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:40.049
 look summer dictator went out and 3 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:44.340
 rebooted 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:47.129
 This is a hindrance that I just did not make books 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.810
 Of course it's very hard to get rid of and 

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:50.700
 fail not to dilute the processor itself 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.829
 let's directly turn off the street 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.799
 look and simplifying this i have already 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:57.900
 analysis as it goes began 

00:03:54.799 --> 00:04:02.579
 shut down and crash itself directly 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:04.950
 I had to rewrite the indicator 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:08.220
 do a full program on the indicator 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:12.389
 and very complicated let's look here 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:14.010
 I have a LED here and my key 

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:15.959
 the program monitors the status on 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.509
 indicator it checks what is happening 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:20.789
 inside the indicator she check such 

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:23.039
 cells recorded which protocol digits 

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:25.199
 foam as occurs if on the form that in 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:27.510
 indicators inside no in exchange for that 

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:29.190
 quite complicated program she starts 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:31.949
 it resets actually come 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:35.430
 let 's try it now i turn off 3 and 8 loop 

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:37.409
 I will pull out the indicator, you will see the program 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.210
 starts looking for an indicator but at the same time 

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:43.770
 the program itself does not see the indicator 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:45.539
 everything works works for me like a pastor 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.220
 the program that there is no indicator well and god with 

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:49.500
 him ser program can track 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:53.570
 temperature all tests she doesn't live 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:57.080
 whatever indicator i leave it 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:57.080
 let's leave 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:05.990
 he noticed him on me and started everything 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:07.980
 come out indicator lives my life I 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.630
 got out that way only 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:11.040
 programs managed to get rid of it 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:12.600
 and it is not control 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.190
 and I myself am such an indicator 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:17.060
 already repeatedly faced with them 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:19.530
 them such indicators is simply darkness 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:21.300
 grounding nothing helps 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:23.160
 I had to do everything in the program 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.650
 principle still works such a moment 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:28.350
 see me have keyboards i use 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:29.790
 the keyboard is not a matrix and took it with 

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:31.680
 using see see who cunning 

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:36.150
 built me ​​on every button stand 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:38.850
 resistors and two wires go to cp u 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:43.110
 they cordoned me off the corridor 

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:45.750
 sled keystroke I sweat 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:48.750
 maybe I will do a lesson like this program 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:50.550
 everything is made very comfortable in this device 

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:54.080
 I use no remote decided to use 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:55.979
 later just buttons connected to the circuit 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:57.780
 use two wires only 

00:05:55.979 --> 00:05:58.889
 the ground and on some kind of tcp leg can 

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:00.900
 hang a lot of buttons 

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:04.400
 very convenient program of course a little 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:06.720
 zaboristaya there but save ports 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:09.840
 actually such a device 

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:11.850
 which we made him also have yet 

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:14.520
 jam situation all sorts because 

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:16.620
 women work for them women 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:18.330
 female tamada very much everything 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:20.370
 provide wrong but there 

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:23.520
 numbers code and wrong even sensor 

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:25.229
 let's connect the dots I will collect to 

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:29.510
 the tone cut his personality does not happen 

00:06:25.229 --> 00:06:29.510
 running over temperature 

00:06:33.289 --> 00:06:36.539
 everything is turned off and these bulbs 

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:39.930
 LED light 

00:06:36.539 --> 00:06:43.979
 someone very good quality here 

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:46.460
 So devices hope someone would 

00:06:43.979 --> 00:06:46.460
 interesting
