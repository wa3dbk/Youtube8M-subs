00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.750
 some say that the spinning 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:25.070
 torrent is the most complex technique e 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.919
 hard absolute I am 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:32.480
 absolutely agree with this 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:36.260
 reality in particular the environment in which 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.399
 we need a specification 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.890
 caution 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:41.809
 a shrewdness in the approach in the 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.040
 launch methods in the techniques of 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:44.390
 recovery 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.940
 and it's just the launch I want 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.010
 talk to you on this occasion there is one 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.829
 in particular that I prefer to do 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.780
 always in specific situations is the 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:56.630
 crossbow launch 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:59.360
 we start from a static position 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.950
 adopted when we have the 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.720
 upper part to us that is 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:07.370
 completely covered for example with 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:09.890
 branches and shrubs trees and very little 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:11.420
 where the space below and insert them ska 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.970
 place it on the target 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:17.720
 the first blow which is fundamental 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:20.300
 to get on fish fishing without 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.400
 scaring him and having the opportunity and the 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.210
 possibility of going to the first one 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.830
 blow 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.410
 well the gym launch allows us to 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:31.220
 do this to get on 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:33.470
 prey with extreme silence and greatness 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.420
 precision is quite simple to 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.100
 realize even if then obviously 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.320
 there is always some practice to do 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.540
 before refining what I do 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.490
 I call the perfect launch not 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.009
 it realizes with extreme simplicity it is 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.450
 just point the top of the barrel 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:49.820
 towards the goal where we mean 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.830
 project the artificial grab 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.790
 the bait for the single one for the correct 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:58.369
 being very careful not to close ourselves 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:01.100
 we load the launch by burning the barrel 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:03.110
 as much as is necessary for then 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.979
 place the bait a distance that 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.979
 we wish
