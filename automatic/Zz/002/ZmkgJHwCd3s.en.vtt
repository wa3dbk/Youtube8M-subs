00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:17.010
 hello everyone here is called hd 

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:19.290
 commenting on the darkness in this video os 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.240
 I will teach how to put a part 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:23.820
 front to the bus so that we do not know 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.740
 climb the zombies from the front 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.260
 that is where our 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.360
 robot is very easy we can do it 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.330
 since round 1 we first started to 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.910
 build our turbine we take the 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.379
 piece of the mannequin and we put it safe 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.030
 which is to take also the 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:41.030
 fan that we no longer put 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.950
 and now we're going for the last piece 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.380
 good before we will carry us these 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:51.680
 zombies so they do not bother us and we 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:54.090
 can kill in the process 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.340
 we try to shoot anywhere - 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.220
 the head to be able to make the maximum 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.050
 possible points since then we will have 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.780
 what to open box 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.420
 doors and others we take the last piece 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.270
 that is in having the pieces 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.060
 they are always in the same place telephone 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:15.240
 in the armchairs the fan and in the 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.010
 screens is the man and once the 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.340
 turbine we put it in front of this 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:23.080
 we open the door and take that piece 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.450
 great that was there 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.980
 let's not forget to pick up the turbine either 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.720
 If not then we can not give it 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:32.100
 electricity 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:34.860
 we loaded the last remaining zombie 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.799
 let's put some doors and windows 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:41.180
 so that the zombies do not come so fast 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.180
 and give us time to do things 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.670
 good we see that started the round 2 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:48.909
 we take a resuscitation in case the 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.920
 flies open the door 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:55.300
 I have to catch some ammunition for 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:57.630
 if perhaps because we are going to put the new 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.630
 piece 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.730
 as we see it has been totally new 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.800
 the bus will not enter any zombies now 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:07.750
 from the front I hope that you 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.390
 have liked do not forget to comment vote 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.450

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.450
