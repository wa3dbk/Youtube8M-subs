00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:03.709
 the feeling that was dunga already spoke about a dressing room 

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:08.550
 and that you talked in the locker room and what in your opinion was 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.770
 determinant in the second half of Brazil that was very different from the first 

00:00:14.149 --> 00:00:16.900
 so I think the feeling is 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:17.700
 ae 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.099
 visibly of sadness do not doubt 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:23.470
 in the changing rooms the good news 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:25.310
 there was nothing else 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:26.800
 even because 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.230
 the trust is very great was a group that in three and a half years 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.910
 to active 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.770
 How can I tell you? 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.620
 the candidate of this feeling of the Brazilian fan admires Brazilian selection 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.740
 after the 2006 World Cup I think 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:43.780
 the brazilian fan 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.910
 I was enjoying myself a lot 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.590
 create a world cup world cup 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.210
 When Brazil arrives 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:51.640
 I always had 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.470
 as one of the favorites of the twisted dock at the time gets quite hopeful 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.000
 so it was really the conjugue 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.720
 in the second half 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.840
 ended up being decisive two balls 

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:07.840
 one no help given schneider another one of stop ball 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.810
 because in my view 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.400
 the netherlands 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.700
 it's not that he 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.540
 made a great design game too but knew how to take advantage of those opportunities 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.320
 then project players who have 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.880
 they administered well 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.810
 the game 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.170
 and then it was hard for us to run after 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.180
 why the team was destabilized in the second half mainly 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:35.559
 this gets that hurt that the game could have been finished the first 

00:01:35.559 --> 00:01:38.030
 Time with the chance that Brazil 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.780
 so now you come off a number of things from a way of being of people 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.920
 they will speak a number of things or 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.660
 What could have done could not have done 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.230
 but anyway I think 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:53.740
 What happened was that we lost played in the second half really 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.470
 it is far from what we know 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.490
 What can I say? 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.490
 and then again it's complicated complicated because 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.260
 October 15 was the experienced team who later 

00:02:12.169 --> 00:02:15.169
 under the state administration 

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:19.839
 I imagine with all the grandchildren many expectations square world cup you 

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:22.989
 arrived here indicated by the majority of the specialized public or not 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:24.439
 best goalkeeper in the world 

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:27.439
 What is it that takes you from this world cup you holder 

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:29.539
 So 

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:31.699
 it's very sad 

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:34.159
 gave that feeling of 

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:37.139
 tite the route that I think 

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:40.139
 everybody is feeling right now 

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:47.089
 and there they do 

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:49.199
 was a cup in which 

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:52.199
 I particulary 

00:02:54.529 --> 00:02:57.459
 I do not know and I do not know what to say. 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:00.669
 with a cup in which she head in the quarterfinals again 

00:03:00.669 --> 00:03:03.599
 in 2006 scenes end part again today 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:06.620
 it is a feeling of sadness and defeat ddd 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:09.289
 Julier you 

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:12.289
 suffered a lot to play this world cup 

00:03:13.249 --> 00:03:16.919
 that almost passed during these treatments everything to be able to play 

00:03:18.219 --> 00:03:22.609
 if you think that in fact it was worth all the effort everything you've heard 

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:26.799
 you would repeat everything started your cycle in the selection continue yes you are the one 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:29.799
 best goalkeeper in the world 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:33.499
 the player 

00:03:33.499 --> 00:03:37.229
 that helps the world cup be a world cup and what I have something 

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:40.229
 what is that thing in which comparing 

00:03:40.869 --> 00:03:44.559
 the headline time so I know myself very well and knows my conditions 

00:03:44.559 --> 00:03:46.199
 to play 

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:49.199
 I'm crazy go into a world cup 

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:51.709
 then this 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:54.739
 a situation that really is foolishness in this period 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:57.819
 a re-establishing the conditions knew that 

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:01.359
 I'll be 100% state 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:08.569
 if the circus continues in the selection 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:10.889
 I think it should be 

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:14.889
 the future god belongs and I think now is the slap in the house of action are 

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:17.189
 The 

00:04:17.189 --> 00:04:20.029
 at the time did not hug because 

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:22.389
 Are you sure everyone's there? 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:24.919
 excited sad ddd 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:26.809
 by this defeat 

00:04:26.809 --> 00:04:30.319
 and then e 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.120
 work continues at the club 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.900
 beginning of the year continues or little there was another senator 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:37.870
 for what 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.729
 I'm going to want to continue being called I think the player will be 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:45.290
 representing his country esteem shirt of the Brazilian national team I do not think 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:46.340
 different 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.379
 and I think we have to give more 

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:51.979
 now so long because actually being with this defeat is a defeat that will 

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:54.080
 get hurt on the shelf 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.469
 to every player here for a long time 

00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:58.819
 So now it's time to take the time to 

00:04:58.819 --> 00:05:01.709
 to come back and with us to vote but worked normally
