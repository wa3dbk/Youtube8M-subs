00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
stabilizer you want to use one of the

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.610 
stabilizer you want to use one of the
three<00:00:32.550> horizontal<00:00:33.180> slots<00:00:33.930> so<00:00:34.350> you<00:00:34.380> can

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
three horizontal slots so you can

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.950 
three horizontal slots so you can
fine-tune<00:00:34.980> it<00:00:35.399> later

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
fine-tune it later

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:45.500 
fine-tune it later
start<00:00:36.960> with<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.170> middle<00:00:37.320> position<00:00:44.239> now<00:00:45.239> just

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
start with the middle position now just

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.330 
start with the middle position now just
sort<00:00:45.719> of<00:00:45.809> move<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.320> handle<00:00:46.770> between<00:00:47.129> each

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
sort of move the handle between each

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.130 
sort of move the handle between each
position<00:00:47.730> until<00:00:48.329> you<00:00:48.420> find<00:00:48.629> a<00:00:48.719> pretty<00:00:48.960> good

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
position until you find a pretty good

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.090 
position until you find a pretty good
Center<00:00:50.809> you<00:00:51.809> can<00:00:51.840> use<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.199> penny<00:00:52.559> if<00:00:52.800> you<00:00:52.949> need

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
Center you can use a penny if you need

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.250 
Center you can use a penny if you need
to<00:00:53.219> move<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.579> metal<00:00:53.730> screw<00:00:54.149> and<00:00:54.390> move<00:00:55.020> it<00:00:55.140> to

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
to move the metal screw and move it to

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.520 
to move the metal screw and move it to
another<00:00:55.289> position<00:00:56.809> after<00:00:57.809> we<00:00:58.079> have<00:00:58.199> that<00:00:58.379> just

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
another position after we have that just

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.500 
another position after we have that just
sort<00:00:58.800> of<00:00:58.920> centered<00:00:59.340> we're<00:01:00.030> going<00:01:00.180> to<00:01:00.239> adjust

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
sort of centered we're going to adjust

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:01.910 
sort of centered we're going to adjust
the<00:01:00.690> counterweights<00:01:01.230> on<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.500> bottom<00:01:01.800> of<00:01:01.859> the

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
the counterweights on the bottom of the

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.719 
the counterweights on the bottom of the
camera<00:01:03.110> let's<00:01:04.110> extend<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.619> arm<00:01:04.860> all<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.549> way

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
camera let's extend the arm all the way

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.429 
camera let's extend the arm all the way
and<00:01:06.119> remove<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.630> weights<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:07.049> start

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
and remove the weights to start

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.560 
and remove the weights to start
basically<00:01:08.159> you<00:01:08.400> want<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.700> camera<00:01:09.119> on<00:01:09.270> topped

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
basically you want the camera on topped

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.660 
basically you want the camera on topped
away<00:01:09.869> just<00:01:10.140> a<00:01:10.260> little<00:01:10.290> bit<00:01:10.799> more<00:01:11.040> than<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.430> arm

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
away just a little bit more than the arm

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:19.429 
away just a little bit more than the arm
on<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.060> bottom<00:01:17.900> the<00:01:18.900> weights<00:01:19.140> that<00:01:19.380> are

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
on the bottom the weights that are

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.080 
on the bottom the weights that are
included<00:01:19.920> with<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.220> stabilizers<00:01:20.700> are<00:01:20.850> really

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
included with the stabilizers are really

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.020 
included with the stabilizers are really
for<00:01:21.299> heavier<00:01:21.960> cameras<00:01:22.470> with<00:01:22.680> attachments<00:01:23.430> I

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
for heavier cameras with attachments I

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.480 
for heavier cameras with attachments I
like<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.600> use<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:24.780> few<00:01:25.110> small<00:01:25.500> washers<00:01:26.040> to<00:01:26.250> fine

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
like to use a few small washers to fine

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.190 
like to use a few small washers to fine
tune<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.820> weight<00:01:27.119> on<00:01:27.299> my<00:01:27.330> stabilizer<00:01:27.900> I

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
tune the weight on my stabilizer I

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.679 
tune the weight on my stabilizer I
bought<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:28.770> dozen<00:01:29.070> of<00:01:29.280> these<00:01:29.430> and<00:01:30.180> an<00:01:30.299> extra

round<00:01:32.759> 2<00:01:32.939> dollars<00:01:33.329> you<00:01:34.020> don't<00:01:34.140> necessarily

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
round 2 dollars you don't necessarily

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.620 
round 2 dollars you don't necessarily
need<00:01:35.100> them<00:01:35.310> but<00:01:35.610> they<00:01:35.759> make<00:01:35.970> it<00:01:36.000> a<00:01:36.150> lot<00:01:36.180> easier

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
need them but they make it a lot easier

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.170 
need them but they make it a lot easier
to<00:01:36.990> find<00:01:37.259> a<00:01:37.409> good<00:01:37.590> balance<00:01:37.909> otherwise<00:01:38.909> you'll

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
to find a good balance otherwise you'll

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.910 
to find a good balance otherwise you'll
just<00:01:39.210> end<00:01:39.540> up<00:01:39.630> fooling<00:01:39.900> with<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.200> arm<00:01:40.409> for<00:01:40.860> an

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
just end up fooling with the arm for an

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.469 
just end up fooling with the arm for an
hour<00:01:41.070> every<00:01:41.640> single<00:01:41.909> time<00:01:42.090> you<00:01:42.210> put<00:01:42.360> the

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
hour every single time you put the

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.569 
hour every single time you put the
camera<00:01:42.780> on<00:01:42.810> this<00:01:43.560> way<00:01:43.770> you<00:01:43.829> can<00:01:44.130> just<00:01:44.310> leave

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
camera on this way you can just leave

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.550 
camera on this way you can just leave
the<00:01:44.880> arm<00:01:45.090> fully<00:01:45.420> extended<00:01:45.509> so<00:01:46.200> you'll<00:01:46.350> never

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
the arm fully extended so you'll never

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.889 
the arm fully extended so you'll never
lose<00:01:46.829> your<00:01:47.009> setting<00:01:47.430> you'll<00:01:48.360> see<00:01:48.570> how<00:01:48.720> nice

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
lose your setting you'll see how nice

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.240 
lose your setting you'll see how nice
and<00:01:49.140> smooth<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.470> camera<00:01:49.740> corrects<00:01:50.070> itself

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
and smooth the camera corrects itself

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.370 
and smooth the camera corrects itself
when<00:01:50.640> it's<00:01:50.759> properly<00:01:50.970> weighted<00:01:51.360> your<00:01:52.110> should

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
when it's properly weighted your should

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.899 
when it's properly weighted your should
look<00:01:52.530> exactly<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:53.009> same<00:01:53.220> as<00:01:53.340> mine<00:01:53.549> I'll<00:01:53.790> go

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
look exactly the same as mine I'll go

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.760 
look exactly the same as mine I'll go
ahead<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:54.270> demonstrate<00:01:54.420> that<00:01:54.780> in<00:01:55.049> a<00:01:55.110> second

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.959 

you<00:01:58.770> should<00:01:58.979> be<00:01:59.040> able<00:01:59.100> to<00:01:59.219> turn<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.610> camera<00:01:59.909> on

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
you should be able to turn the camera on

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.730 
you should be able to turn the camera on
its<00:02:00.119> side<00:02:00.299> and<00:02:00.600> count<00:02:00.869> to<00:02:01.020> three<00:02:01.380> and<00:02:01.590> the

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
its side and count to three and the

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.080 
its side and count to three and the
camera<00:02:02.130> should<00:02:02.340> return<00:02:02.579> to<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:02.909> middle

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
camera should return to the middle

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:12.620 
camera should return to the middle
position

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.200 

now<00:02:13.630> that<00:02:13.810> we<00:02:13.900> have<00:02:14.140> the<00:02:14.440> arm<00:02:15.190> and<00:02:15.700> the<00:02:15.850> camera

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
now that we have the arm and the camera

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.960 
now that we have the arm and the camera
properly<00:02:16.720> balanced<00:02:17.380> we<00:02:18.190> want<00:02:18.400> to<00:02:18.460> fine-tune

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
properly balanced we want to fine-tune

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.730 
properly balanced we want to fine-tune
the<00:02:19.150> camera<00:02:19.420> on<00:02:19.540> top<00:02:19.720> until<00:02:20.110> we<00:02:20.260> achieve<00:02:20.530> a

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
the camera on top until we achieve a

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.100 
the camera on top until we achieve a
nice<00:02:20.950> level<00:02:21.430> camera<00:02:21.850> the<00:02:22.570> side<00:02:22.780> to<00:02:22.960> side

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
nice level camera the side to side

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.380 
nice level camera the side to side
should<00:02:23.380> be<00:02:23.440> easy<00:02:23.770> but<00:02:24.670> just<00:02:24.850> by<00:02:24.970> moving<00:02:25.150> it

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
should be easy but just by moving it

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:26.700 
should be easy but just by moving it
around<00:02:25.600> in<00:02:25.750> one<00:02:25.840> of<00:02:25.960> the<00:02:26.020> three<00:02:26.230> grooves<00:02:26.500> by

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:26.710 
around in one of the three grooves by

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.230 
around in one of the three grooves by
loosening<00:02:27.100> the<00:02:27.280> tension<00:02:27.880> or<00:02:28.000> screw

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
loosening the tension or screw

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.780 
loosening the tension or screw
underneath<00:02:28.680> you<00:02:29.680> can<00:02:29.860> fine-tune<00:02:30.130> your<00:02:30.370> front

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
underneath you can fine-tune your front

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.670 
underneath you can fine-tune your front
and<00:02:30.850> back<00:02:30.940> motion<00:02:31.600> by<00:02:31.750> adding<00:02:32.110> a<00:02:32.170> few<00:02:32.380> small

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
and back motion by adding a few small

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.500 
and back motion by adding a few small
washers<00:02:33.220> to<00:02:33.400> the<00:02:33.520> top<00:02:33.730> with<00:02:33.940> a<00:02:33.970> quarter<00:02:34.360> inch

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
washers to the top with a quarter inch

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.380 
washers to the top with a quarter inch
screw<00:02:34.810> and<00:02:34.960> regular<00:02:35.290> nut<00:02:35.530> like<00:02:35.770> I<00:02:35.950> did<00:02:36.390> there

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
screw and regular nut like I did there

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.150 
screw and regular nut like I did there
are<00:02:37.480> plenty<00:02:37.690> of<00:02:37.720> places<00:02:37.900> to<00:02:38.290> attach<00:02:38.620> extra

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
are plenty of places to attach extra

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.670 
are plenty of places to attach extra
weight<00:02:39.340> I<00:02:39.580> screw<00:02:40.180> mine<00:02:40.420> into<00:02:40.780> the<00:02:40.810> plate<00:02:41.440> right

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
weight I screw mine into the plate right

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.980 
weight I screw mine into the plate right
here<00:02:41.740> I<00:02:42.190> like<00:02:43.000> this<00:02:43.120> method<00:02:43.330> because<00:02:43.570> you<00:02:43.870> only

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
here I like this method because you only

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.080 
here I like this method because you only
ever<00:02:44.230> have<00:02:44.380> to<00:02:44.620> do<00:02:44.740> it<00:02:44.860> once<00:02:45.130> and<00:02:45.430> then<00:02:45.970> you're

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
ever have to do it once and then you're

good<00:02:46.240> to<00:02:46.270> go<00:02:46.390> next<00:02:46.840> time<00:02:47.020> that<00:02:47.410> way<00:02:47.530> you<00:02:47.620> don't

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
good to go next time that way you don't

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.380 
good to go next time that way you don't
have<00:02:47.800> to<00:02:47.920> readjust<00:02:48.250> the<00:02:48.520> camera<00:02:48.610> every<00:02:49.090> single

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
have to readjust the camera every single

have to readjust the camera every single
time<00:02:49.570> that<00:02:49.600> you<00:02:50.470> use<00:02:50.680> it<00:02:51.690> here<00:02:52.690> are<00:02:52.810> just<00:02:52.900> some

have to find and practice makes perfect

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.320 
have to find and practice makes perfect
with<00:03:40.269> the<00:03:40.360> stabilizer<00:03:40.840> you<00:03:42.000> need<00:03:43.000> to<00:03:43.120> learn<00:03:43.269> to

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:43.330 
with the stabilizer you need to learn to

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.030 
with the stabilizer you need to learn to
walk<00:03:43.630> like<00:03:43.870> a<00:03:43.930> duck<00:03:44.230> and<00:03:44.290> make<00:03:44.680> subtle<00:03:44.920> changes

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
walk like a duck and make subtle changes

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.660 
walk like a duck and make subtle changes
in<00:03:45.580> direction<00:03:46.120> to<00:03:46.150> achieve<00:03:46.540> a<00:03:46.570> good<00:03:46.780> shot<00:03:47.050> you

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
in direction to achieve a good shot you

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.710 
in direction to achieve a good shot you
also<00:03:48.670> want<00:03:48.880> to<00:03:48.910> pay<00:03:49.060> attention<00:03:49.090> to<00:03:49.630> the

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
also want to pay attention to the

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.990 
also want to pay attention to the
direction<00:03:49.870> of<00:03:50.170> the<00:03:50.290> wind<00:03:50.550> direction<00:03:51.550> of<00:03:51.910> the

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
direction of the wind direction of the

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.759 
direction of the wind direction of the
Sun<00:03:52.209> things<00:03:52.570> like<00:03:52.780> that<00:03:52.959> just<00:03:53.200> to<00:03:53.380> get<00:03:53.530> a<00:03:53.560> good

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
Sun things like that just to get a good

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:56.580 
Sun things like that just to get a good
shot<00:03:53.830> if<00:03:54.519> you<00:03:55.180> get<00:03:55.390> the<00:03:55.510> stabilizer<00:03:56.050> set<00:03:56.470> up

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
shot if you get the stabilizer set up

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.650 
shot if you get the stabilizer set up
and<00:03:56.769> balance<00:03:57.040> properly<00:03:57.459> you<00:03:58.120> really<00:03:58.450> should

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
and balance properly you really should

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.210 
and balance properly you really should
be<00:03:58.810> able<00:03:58.840> to<00:03:58.989> get<00:03:59.170> some<00:03:59.320> great<00:03:59.500> shots<00:03:59.560> with<00:04:00.040> the

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
be able to get some great shots with the

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.220 
be able to get some great shots with the
Roxanne<00:04:00.610> Pro<00:04:00.850> it's<00:04:01.120> a<00:04:01.239> really<00:04:01.570> great<00:04:01.720> piece<00:04:02.050> of

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
Roxanne Pro it's a really great piece of

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.560 
Roxanne Pro it's a really great piece of
equipment<00:04:02.680> so<00:04:02.830> there<00:04:03.730> it<00:04:03.820> is<00:04:03.880> I<00:04:04.120> hope<00:04:04.269> that<00:04:04.450> was

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:04.570 
equipment so there it is I hope that was

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:06.600 
equipment so there it is I hope that was
helpful
