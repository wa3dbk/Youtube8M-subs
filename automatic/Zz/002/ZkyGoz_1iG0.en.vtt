00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.200
 hello all welcome to the channel 

00:00:02.439 --> 00:00:07.450
 color of being today I'm going to answer a 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:10.700
 question they asked me about the 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:15.150
 famous earwigs 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:18.859
 these insects that appear in 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.859
 in many homes even 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.010
 and in orchards 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.010
 really organic 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.820
 and explain good the function a bit of 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.990
 this 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.990
 these insects 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.440
 very good to fight 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.650
 of aphids for example 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:47.650
 when 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:50.730
 in the orchards are dust 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:52.800
 scissors cojedes eat 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.420
 to aphids and pillbugs also 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.789
 What are they 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.410
 another or the pests that are very large 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.410
 that attack the 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.080
 so 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:08.980
 and as other also attack other to aa 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.980
 another insect 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:16.500
 and they also attack the orchards 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:19.980
 if you have lots of earwigs 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.770
 your garden suggest you first in the 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:26.430
 bad is the place where your 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.560
 huerta remain a lot where there is 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.720
 places can shelter in 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.850
 earwigs alan at night on the day it 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.790
 hide then they are always saved 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:39.010
 work of wooden stone or places 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.940
 where there is she always look for moisture 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:45.110
 so 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:46.940
 of weeds the place once the place makes a 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:50.510
 poll the place 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:54.270
 and you find them because in fact the 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:58.109
 night they eat and they are hidden 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.890
 and that's one way the other is also 

00:01:58.109 --> 00:02:02.659
 do 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:08.060
 5 garlic cloves grind it 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:10.789
 already and throw him in a sprayer 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:14.080
 the garlic leaves them to rest a little and 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:17.260
 then the patches of the 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.210
 in the garden where you see they are 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:22.980
 attacking the scissors you also have to 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:22.980
 see if earwigs are eating you 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:31.560
 your turn is being attacked except 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:35.040
 other pests to discard also 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:37.260
 you have to condition your place to 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.299
 that other pests can not enter 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.760
 what I suggest also that always 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:43.550
 I use is aromatic plants near 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.770
 the places where you 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:50.510
 plants always with comments opposes 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:53.920
 species that are flavoring and these 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:57.870
 they tend to also distance the 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:01.129
 bugs or insects 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.129
 then everything 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:09.370
 first you have to clean that weed 

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:13.260
 order discard see if they are scissors 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.260
 who eat you and if so 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:19.590
 see the place will always be a place 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.290
 with humidity 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.440
 to me they have never attacked me scissors 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.960
 killifish aphids and ants 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:31.310
 but earwigs never but the 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:33.450
 night attack if you do with garlic to 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:36.200
 looking 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.200
 Viktor lea 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.030

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:52.340
 our kitchen gardens 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:54.160
 and also encourage self-cultivation and 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.990
 that we can eat 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.650
 all of our lands and we have
