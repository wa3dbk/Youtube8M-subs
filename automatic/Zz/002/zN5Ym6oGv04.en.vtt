presence<00:00:59.240> in<00:00:59.420> the<00:00:59.510> room<00:00:59.690> I<00:01:00.550> never<00:01:01.550> wanted<00:01:01.820> to

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:01.880 
presence in the room I never wanted to

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.439 
presence in the room I never wanted to
make<00:01:02.230> work<00:01:03.230> just<00:01:03.590> because<00:01:03.770> I<00:01:04.519> had<00:01:05.059> to<00:01:05.269> make

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449 
make work just because I had to make

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:08.260 
make work just because I had to make
money<00:01:05.950> eventually<00:01:06.950> I<00:01:07.280> realized<00:01:07.490> if<00:01:07.939> you<00:01:08.090> want

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
money eventually I realized if you want

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.249 
money eventually I realized if you want
to<00:01:08.360> do<00:01:08.479> it<00:01:08.570> properly<00:01:09.020> you<00:01:09.850> you<00:01:10.850> have<00:01:11.000> to<00:01:11.259> give

00:01:12.249 --> 00:01:12.259 
to do it properly you you have to give

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:14.890 
to do it properly you you have to give
yourself<00:01:12.380> over<00:01:12.770> to<00:01:12.950> your<00:01:13.369> client<00:01:13.729> you<00:01:14.659> can

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
yourself over to your client you can

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.510 
yourself over to your client you can
kind<00:01:15.050> of<00:01:15.170> do<00:01:15.350> two<00:01:15.530> things<00:01:15.710> at<00:01:15.890> once<00:01:16.100> and<00:01:16.280> paint

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
kind of do two things at once and paint

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.670 
kind of do two things at once and paint
in<00:01:16.700> your<00:01:16.850> spare<00:01:17.060> time<00:01:17.120> and<00:01:17.600> i<00:01:17.990> also<00:01:18.200> realized

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
in your spare time and i also realized

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.020 
in your spare time and i also realized
most<00:01:18.920> importantly<00:01:19.490> that<00:01:19.670> you<00:01:19.820> don't

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
most importantly that you don't

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.560 
most importantly that you don't
necessarily<00:01:20.780> have<00:01:21.409> to<00:01:21.940> compromise<00:01:22.940> what<00:01:23.420> you

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
necessarily have to compromise what you

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.560 
necessarily have to compromise what you
do<00:01:23.780> from<00:01:24.020> a<00:01:24.229> creative<00:01:24.440> point<00:01:24.770> of<00:01:24.860> view<00:01:25.180> to<00:01:26.180> make

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
do from a creative point of view to make

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.280 
do from a creative point of view to make
a<00:01:26.600> living<00:01:26.870> from<00:01:27.110> it<00:01:28.570> you<00:01:29.570> never<00:01:29.690> really<00:01:30.140> know

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290 
a living from it you never really know

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.250 
a living from it you never really know
how<00:01:30.470> people<00:01:30.740> are<00:01:30.799> going<00:01:30.890> to<00:01:31.010> receive<00:01:31.340> work

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:32.260 
how people are going to receive work

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.370 
how people are going to receive work
it's<00:01:33.260> quite<00:01:33.440> surprising<00:01:33.590> at<00:01:34.280> times<00:01:34.750> to<00:01:35.750> to

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
it's quite surprising at times to to

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.550 
it's quite surprising at times to to
realize<00:01:36.770> how<00:01:36.950> quickly<00:01:38.020> your<00:01:39.020> idea<00:01:39.440> of

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
realize how quickly your idea of

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:40.510 
realize how quickly your idea of
something<00:01:39.770> that<00:01:39.890> you<00:01:40.100> really<00:01:40.190> like<00:01:40.490> and

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
something that you really like and

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.310 
something that you really like and
change<00:01:41.920> like<00:01:42.920> I<00:01:43.010> don't<00:01:43.070> think<00:01:43.190> I'm<00:01:43.369> ever

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
change like I don't think I'm ever

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.950 
change like I don't think I'm ever
embarrassed<00:01:45.320> or<00:01:45.619> shy<00:01:46.299> to<00:01:47.299> show<00:01:47.510> an<00:01:47.630> older

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
embarrassed or shy to show an older

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.620 
embarrassed or shy to show an older
piece<00:01:48.229> because<00:01:48.740> it's<00:01:49.520> like<00:01:49.729> a<00:01:49.760> reference<00:01:50.360> to<00:01:50.570> a

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
piece because it's like a reference to a

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.090 
piece because it's like a reference to a
certain<00:01:51.020> time

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
certain time

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.630 
certain time
I<00:01:52.210> mean<00:01:53.210> that's<00:01:53.900> just<00:01:54.229> the<00:01:54.350> way<00:01:54.470> it<00:01:54.560> is<00:01:54.680> but

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
I mean that's just the way it is but

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:56.950 
I mean that's just the way it is but
it's<00:01:55.970> not<00:01:56.090> like<00:01:56.210> I'm<00:01:56.330> going<00:01:56.450> to<00:01:56.540> put<00:01:56.689> an<00:01:56.780> old

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
it's not like I'm going to put an old

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.300 
it's not like I'm going to put an old
piece<00:01:57.229> on<00:01:57.409> shot<00:01:57.680> because<00:01:57.890> I<00:01:58.040> think<00:01:58.220> I've

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
piece on shot because I think I've

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:59.770 
piece on shot because I think I've
gotten<00:01:58.520> better<00:01:58.759> and<00:01:58.970> it<00:01:59.150> works<00:01:59.330> got<00:01:59.570> more

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
gotten better and it works got more

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.640 
gotten better and it works got more
interesting<00:02:00.070> you<00:02:01.070> have<00:02:01.190> to<00:02:01.990> to<00:02:02.990> kind<00:02:03.229> of<00:02:03.380> treat

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:03.650 
interesting you have to to kind of treat

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.090 
interesting you have to to kind of treat
each<00:02:03.890> piece<00:02:04.810> very<00:02:05.810> separately<00:02:06.380> from<00:02:06.530> the<00:02:06.619> next
