of doing ok so here I am looking at the
app<00:03:10.490> itself<00:03:10.970> this<00:03:11.930> is<00:03:11.990> the<00:03:12.380> mydlink<00:03:12.620> Lite<00:03:13.370> app

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
app itself this is the mydlink Lite app

app itself this is the mydlink Lite app
for<00:03:14.240> the<00:03:14.360> iOS<00:03:14.630> device<00:03:14.660> as<00:03:15.170> you<00:03:15.680> can<00:03:15.800> see<00:03:15.920> here<00:03:16.130> I

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
for the iOS device as you can see here I

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.160 
for the iOS device as you can see here I
can<00:03:16.490> I<00:03:16.760> can<00:03:17.330> zoom<00:03:17.600> in<00:03:17.840> with<00:03:17.870> it<00:03:18.320> and<00:03:18.790> pan<00:03:20.170> using

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
can I can zoom in with it and pan using

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.920 
can I can zoom in with it and pan using
other<00:03:22.100> other<00:03:22.610> parts<00:03:23.090> of<00:03:23.180> this<00:03:23.330> so<00:03:23.450> I'm<00:03:23.900> not

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
other other parts of this so I'm not

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.350 
other other parts of this so I'm not
going<00:03:24.140> to<00:03:24.200> sing<00:03:24.380> over<00:03:24.670> using<00:03:25.670> the<00:03:25.820> typical<00:03:26.270> way

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
going to sing over using the typical way

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:27.580 
going to sing over using the typical way
you<00:03:26.420> would<00:03:26.660> use<00:03:26.690> it<00:03:26.930> actually<00:03:27.230> that's<00:03:27.350> pretty

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
you would use it actually that's pretty

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.520 
you would use it actually that's pretty
much<00:03:27.830> by<00:03:28.580> double<00:03:28.940> clicking<00:03:29.150> I<00:03:29.510> can<00:03:30.170> move<00:03:30.320> the

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
much by double clicking I can move the

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.300 
much by double clicking I can move the
camera<00:03:30.950> to<00:03:31.070> the<00:03:31.250> right<00:03:31.280> and<00:03:33.070> zoom<00:03:34.070> out<00:03:34.250> a

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
camera to the right and zoom out a

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.860 
camera to the right and zoom out a
little<00:03:34.550> bit<00:03:34.850> hopefully<00:03:35.920> not<00:03:36.920> zooming<00:03:37.490> in

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
little bit hopefully not zooming in

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.699 
little bit hopefully not zooming in
should<00:03:38.870> be<00:03:38.900> all<00:03:39.020> that<00:03:39.050> that<00:03:39.290> should<00:03:39.530> be<00:03:39.560> the

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
should be all that that should be the

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:06.350 
web browser so right now I'm using it on

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:10.479 
web browser so right now I'm using it on
Chrome<00:04:06.709> and<00:04:07.330> it<00:04:08.330> does<00:04:08.540> use<00:04:08.870> Java<00:04:09.680> in<00:04:10.010> order<00:04:10.310> to

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:10.489 
Chrome and it does use Java in order to

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:13.600 
Chrome and it does use Java in order to
connect<00:04:11.060> to<00:04:11.570> the<00:04:12.440> camera<00:04:12.860> via<00:04:13.130> the<00:04:13.280> Internet

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.610 
connect to the camera via the Internet

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:16.150 
connect to the camera via the Internet
and<00:04:13.880> right<00:04:14.690> now<00:04:14.810> I<00:04:14.870> also<00:04:15.200> have<00:04:15.410> it<00:04:15.650> connected

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 
and right now I also have it connected

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.789 
and right now I also have it connected
via<00:04:16.580> the<00:04:17.000> Ethernet<00:04:17.780> connection<00:04:17.810> as<00:04:18.410> opposed

to the wireless connection this
particular<00:04:20.930> camera<00:04:21.440> also<00:04:21.620> can<00:04:22.360> do<00:04:23.360> some<00:04:23.690> night

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
particular camera also can do some night

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.160 
particular camera also can do some night
vision<00:04:24.200> which<00:04:24.229> I'll<00:04:24.470> move<00:04:24.680> out<00:04:24.830> of<00:04:24.890> the

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:25.170 
vision which I'll move out of the

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:26.540 
vision which I'll move out of the
their<00:04:25.260> studio<00:04:25.530> move<00:04:25.770> into<00:04:25.920> here<00:04:26.190> so<00:04:26.400> I<00:04:26.430> don't

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
their studio move into here so I don't

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.070 
their studio move into here so I don't
disrupt<00:04:26.940> them<00:04:27.180> much<00:04:27.390> more<00:04:27.570> than<00:04:27.630> I<00:04:27.780> already<00:04:27.960> am

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
disrupt them much more than I already am

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.280 
disrupt them much more than I already am
doing<00:04:28.470> but<00:04:29.010> as<00:04:29.250> you<00:04:29.460> can<00:04:29.580> see<00:04:29.760> that's<00:04:30.720> Jennifer

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
the night vision looks like okay as you

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:44.930 
the night vision looks like okay as you
can<00:04:43.020> see<00:04:43.140> this<00:04:43.500> is<00:04:43.740> the<00:04:43.980> night<00:04:44.250> vision<00:04:44.550> portion

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
can see this is the night vision portion

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.450 
can see this is the night vision portion
of<00:04:45.300> the<00:04:45.540> camera<00:04:45.900> and<00:04:46.020> how<00:04:46.170> brightly<00:04:46.500> it<00:04:47.100> can

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
of the camera and how brightly it can

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.640 
of the camera and how brightly it can
see<00:04:47.670> it<00:04:47.790> goes<00:04:47.940> up<00:04:47.970> to<00:04:48.240> about<00:04:48.330> 20<00:04:48.780> feet<00:04:48.810> and<00:04:49.530> I'm

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 
see it goes up to about 20 feet and I'm

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:50.780 
see it goes up to about 20 feet and I'm
trying<00:04:49.920> to<00:04:49.980> get<00:04:50.130> it<00:04:50.220> to<00:04:50.340> show<00:04:50.490> a<00:04:50.520> little<00:04:50.640> bit

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:50.790 
trying to get it to show a little bit

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.880 
trying to get it to show a little bit
more<00:04:51.060> detail<00:04:51.510> by<00:04:51.750> getting<00:04:51.990> closer<00:04:52.230> to<00:04:52.530> it<00:04:52.560> and

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:52.890 
more detail by getting closer to it and

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:54.650 
more detail by getting closer to it and
kind<00:04:53.460> of<00:04:53.610> make<00:04:53.730> out<00:04:53.850> my<00:04:53.970> ring<00:04:54.210> there<00:04:54.420> in<00:04:54.540> my

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660 
kind of make out my ring there in my

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.330 
kind of make out my ring there in my
hand<00:04:55.010> but<00:04:56.010> basically<00:04:56.430> the<00:04:57.210> camera<00:04:57.960> itself

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
hand but basically the camera itself

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.440 
hand but basically the camera itself
will<00:04:59.340> obviously<00:04:59.550> have<00:04:59.760> the<00:04:59.910> night<00:05:00.060> vision

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:00.450 
will obviously have the night vision

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:03.170 
will obviously have the night vision
using<00:05:00.630> the<00:05:00.810> 10<00:05:00.990> LEDs<00:05:01.530> and<00:05:02.520> infrared<00:05:02.940> lighting

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 
using the 10 LEDs and infrared lighting

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.020 
using the 10 LEDs and infrared lighting
too<00:05:03.770> brightly<00:05:04.770> light<00:05:05.190> up<00:05:05.370> anything<00:05:05.730> you<00:05:05.820> can

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 
too brightly light up anything you can

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:07.940 
too brightly light up anything you can
see<00:05:06.330> actually<00:05:06.780> I'll<00:05:07.020> try<00:05:07.230> and<00:05:07.380> pan<00:05:07.590> it<00:05:07.710> around

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:07.950 
see actually I'll try and pan it around

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:09.170 
see actually I'll try and pan it around
a<00:05:08.040> little<00:05:08.130> bit<00:05:08.430> to<00:05:08.640> show<00:05:08.820> a<00:05:08.850> little<00:05:08.970> bit<00:05:09.120> more

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 
a little bit to show a little bit more

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.830 
a little bit to show a little bit more
of<00:05:09.540> the<00:05:10.430> studio<00:05:11.430> and<00:05:11.640> see<00:05:11.850> if<00:05:11.970> I<00:05:12.090> can<00:05:12.360> of<00:05:12.690> course

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 
of the studio and see if I can of course

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.470 
of the studio and see if I can of course
I'm<00:05:13.110> going<00:05:13.290> the<00:05:13.350> wrong<00:05:13.440> direction<00:05:13.500> with<00:05:13.920> that

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:14.480 
I'm going the wrong direction with that

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:20.140 
I'm going the wrong direction with that
also<00:05:15.480> this<00:05:15.600> particular<00:05:16.040> camera<00:05:17.040> has<00:05:17.660> h.264<00:05:18.660> or

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.150 
also this particular camera has h.264 or

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:24.470 
also this particular camera has h.264 or
MJPEG<00:05:21.920> codecs<00:05:22.920> built<00:05:23.190> into<00:05:23.550> it<00:05:23.700> you<00:05:23.910> can

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:24.480 
MJPEG codecs built into it you can

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:26.690 
MJPEG codecs built into it you can
actually<00:05:24.630> see<00:05:24.870> pretty<00:05:25.440> far<00:05:25.560> into<00:05:26.100> the<00:05:26.340> studio

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:26.700 
actually see pretty far into the studio

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:29.140 
actually see pretty far into the studio
right<00:05:26.940> now<00:05:27.020> can't<00:05:28.020> quite<00:05:28.320> make<00:05:28.560> out<00:05:28.740> Anna

right now can't quite make out Anna

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.630 
right now can't quite make out Anna
behind<00:05:30.150> the<00:05:30.360> camera<00:05:30.990> but<00:05:31.200> you<00:05:31.260> can<00:05:31.380> see<00:05:31.980> pretty

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:32.640 
behind the camera but you can see pretty

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:33.680 
behind the camera but you can see pretty
deep<00:05:32.850> into<00:05:33.090> the<00:05:33.180> studio

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:33.690 
deep into the studio

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:35.270 
deep into the studio
I'd<00:05:34.110> say<00:05:34.350> Paul<00:05:34.590> how<00:05:34.680> big<00:05:34.890> do<00:05:35.010> you<00:05:35.040> think<00:05:35.100> the
