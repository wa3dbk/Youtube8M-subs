00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:08.910
 sofa with this we will do the composition of 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:12.509
 potted orchids are so glassy 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:15.630
 interesting in my work I will 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.940
 use potted orchids 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:23.340
 interesting colors and shapes and varieties 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:24.420
 cumbria plant we will base for this 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.490
 Special soil is used for 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:32.320
 orchids dry roots 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:35.290
 such in color and 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.690
 real from wire and on here on not 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.460
 for the sake of 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.530
 how do we put the vase in which there is no 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:46.739
 we need a drainage hole 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.739
 drainage than he has a lot 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.670
 take on be rings our excess moisture 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.500
 big enough she led 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:23.900
 since orchids are political 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:26.300
 plants that grow their heritage 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.610
 natural environment and they feed on moisture 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:31.369
 that evaporate from the bark of trees 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.900
 so for this we use drainage 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:35.869
 special orchids its composition in 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:39.880
 mostly bark moss and a bit of that 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:39.880
 nutrient substrate 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:45.700
 should torment on a special gruber or 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:10.100
 I lay a little but our drainage 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.100
 and how will i arrange the orchids 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.890
 fame by their face 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.890
 Amelie's flower 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.890
 is coming 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.569
 and second environment Oskarovich 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.000
 what idiot so thin creeping 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:16.630
 trunk 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:19.320
 which flowers themselves grow 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:21.640
 special skewers are used to 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:24.250
 arrange them vertically 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.690
 I while I took off because first 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:29.050
 arrange orchids with you 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:33.760
 pots then I will think about how I will not 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:36.760
 direction the stems themselves because 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:41.980
 I will tell first one a little away 2 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:43.810
 closer to the hole when you know 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.450
 orchid very carefully you need to be with 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:49.030
 pour to them as in his 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:51.760
 the natural environment only blooms 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:55.000
 washed dry when it can 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:57.280
 pollinated flying insects naturally 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.760
 if you pour it heavily then 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.860
 starts dropping flowers because 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.120
 everywhere rains and braiding who can't 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.850
 meaning in these colors 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.920
 that is, and since we still have a pot without 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:11.170
 drainage hole if you transfer it 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.030
 then there is very little chance that you will cause 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:15.640
 such an orchid in such a composition 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.730
 this is desirable and not even water 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.290
 and spray 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:24.070
 drainage and this one here and our substrate 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:26.110
 for orchids and and do it right away 3 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.150
 of the week we are a little bit that is you constantly 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:31.210
 You must ensure that you have countries been 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:33.840
 pretty dry so i'm over 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:38.120
 landing of those they decorate 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:40.070
 composition if 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.260
 my stems will start to bend down i can 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:44.060
 pin them up with a low stick to 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.190
 they did not look the way I 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:50.979
 I still don't understand yet 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:50.979
 please not it is the fault of the customer 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:58.730
 so for the decor i will use dry 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.730
 the roots 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:06.560
 9 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.560
 covers 

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:15.669
 decorative arrangement and compositions 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:24.080
 they match my color boots 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.080
 their 

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:45.150
 some orchids still have air 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:51.229
 city specific and you 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:53.939
 I don't see them, but if you have an orchid 

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:57.650
 aerial roots she also needs 

00:05:53.939 --> 00:05:57.650
 spraying the roots themselves 

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:11.150
 for decorating the substrate for you 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:14.100
 can use some moss with hay 

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:18.810
 some decorative elements 

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:23.730
 whole house changed here closed element 

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:25.190
 which was me these are dry roots and what 

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:27.930
 books 

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:29.790
 to give this composition such 

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:33.060
 I will still use some complexity 

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:37.820
 raffi is wound on wire to make 

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:40.530
 some support the direction of orchids 

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:44.180
 harder will you do more 

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:44.180
 interesting complicated 

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:50.990
 decorative 

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:53.990
 that fasten both ends of the wire 

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:53.990
 substrate 

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:04.370
 the stone bends easily then I thought of her 

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:05.900
 some form is interesting I wanted 

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:07.580
 the more decorative items 

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:14.420
 so I use decided yet here 

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:17.620
 such a girdle is always possible 

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:17.620
 suitable for composition 

00:07:23.639 --> 00:07:28.600
 niche standing fixed 

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:28.600
 try 

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:33.699
 that is, I installed all my complex 

00:07:31.389 --> 00:07:37.590
 design and to interesting now i'm 

00:07:33.699 --> 00:07:37.590
 finish decorating 

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:42.889
 dark fear 

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:54.060
 In general, all the compositions are very 

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:59.160
 This composition turned out I repeat not 

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.490
 overdo and burn the question nodding 

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:04.740
 better so keep a little dried 

00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:06.270
 if you once composition thumb up 

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:08.750
 subscribe to our channel and to new 

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:08.750
