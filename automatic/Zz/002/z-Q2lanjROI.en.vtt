00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
point as well but this kind of feels

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.420 
point as well but this kind of feels
weird<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.440> backwards<00:00:55.980> honestly<00:00:56.309> like

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
weird and backwards honestly like

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.849 
weird and backwards honestly like
whenever<00:00:56.640> I<00:00:56.789> see<00:00:57.000> a<00:00:57.149> manga<00:00:57.899> adaptation<00:00:58.620> of<00:00:58.710> an

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
whenever I see a manga adaptation of an

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.340 
whenever I see a manga adaptation of an
anime<00:00:59.340> I<00:00:59.579> always<00:00:59.969> just<00:01:00.180> be<00:01:00.300> like<00:01:00.449> I<00:01:00.690> don't<00:01:01.260> know

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
anime I always just be like I don't know

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.410 
anime I always just be like I don't know
like<00:01:01.590> cuz<00:01:01.800> usually<00:01:01.980> for<00:01:02.820> me<00:01:02.910> anyway<00:01:03.270> and

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
like cuz usually for me anyway and

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.090 
like cuz usually for me anyway and
that's<00:01:03.570> not<00:01:03.780> that<00:01:03.899> I<00:01:03.930> take<00:01:04.170> advantage<00:01:04.589> of<00:01:04.769> the

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
that's not that I take advantage of the

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.560 
that's not that I take advantage of the
quality<00:01:05.519> of<00:01:05.610> Hmong<00:01:05.790> because<00:01:06.090> most<00:01:06.270> of<00:01:06.420> time

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
quality of Hmong because most of time

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.390 
quality of Hmong because most of time
let's<00:01:06.720> be<00:01:06.780> real<00:01:07.020> a<00:01:07.049> lot<00:01:07.140> of<00:01:07.470> times<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:08.100> manga

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
let's be real a lot of times the manga

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.250 
let's be real a lot of times the manga
is<00:01:08.460> better<00:01:08.640> than<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.909> anime<00:01:09.270> but<00:01:09.479> if<00:01:09.780> there's

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
is better than the anime but if there's

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.500 
is better than the anime but if there's
already<00:01:10.439> an<00:01:10.710> anime<00:01:11.220> there<00:01:11.520> I<00:01:11.790> always<00:01:12.330> feel

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
already an anime there I always feel

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.270 
already an anime there I always feel
like<00:01:12.540> what's<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.380> point<00:01:13.590> of<00:01:13.740> putting<00:01:13.890> it<00:01:14.130> into

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
like what's the point of putting it into

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.100 
like what's the point of putting it into
manga<00:01:14.670> format<00:01:15.420> I<00:01:15.570> don't<00:01:15.720> know<00:01:15.780> maybe<00:01:15.930> that's

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
manga format I don't know maybe that's

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.810 
manga format I don't know maybe that's
just<00:01:16.350> me<00:01:16.500> but<00:01:16.650> then<00:01:16.770> again<00:01:16.860> of<00:01:16.979> course<00:01:17.100> manga

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
just me but then again of course manga

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.219 
just me but then again of course manga
will<00:01:17.909> give<00:01:18.060> you<00:01:18.150> a<00:01:18.210> quicker<00:01:18.420> experience<00:01:19.080> as

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
will give you a quicker experience as

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.020 
will give you a quicker experience as
well<00:01:19.439> you<00:01:19.650> get<00:01:19.770> more<00:01:19.979> into<00:01:20.250> it<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.580> who<00:01:20.850> knows

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
well you get more into it and who knows

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.460 
well you get more into it and who knows
maybe<00:01:21.060> they<00:01:21.420> could<00:01:21.570> do<00:01:21.659> better<00:01:21.869> than<00:01:22.049> the

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
maybe they could do better than the

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.170 
maybe they could do better than the
actual<00:01:22.799> anime<00:01:23.220> itself<00:01:23.490> although<00:01:23.820> I<00:01:24.000> don't

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
actual anime itself although I don't

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.850
