trying to get half damage which is a

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.190 
trying to get half damage which is a
really<00:01:52.619> good<00:01:53.189> strategy<00:01:53.790> for<00:01:53.820> this<00:01:54.060> but<00:01:54.960> he's

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
really good strategy for this but he's

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.289 
really good strategy for this but he's
going<00:01:55.320> for<00:01:55.500> giga<00:01:55.890> impact<00:01:56.009> with<00:01:56.520> his<00:01:56.670> evar<00:01:57.030> and

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
going for giga impact with his evar and

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.020 
going for giga impact with his evar and
that<00:01:58.200> is<00:01:58.409> going<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:58.770> do<00:01:58.890> a<00:01:58.920> lot<00:01:59.430> of<00:01:59.490> damage<00:01:59.790> and

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
that is going to do a lot of damage and

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.510 
that is going to do a lot of damage and
that<00:02:00.299> i'm<00:02:00.649> fairly<00:02:01.649> sure<00:02:01.799> he<00:02:02.070> was<00:02:02.219> choice

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
that i'm fairly sure he was choice

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.660 
that i'm fairly sure he was choice
banded<00:02:02.810> but<00:02:03.810> unfortunately<00:02:04.770> he's<00:02:05.460> you<00:02:05.549> know<00:02:05.610> a

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
banded but unfortunately he's you know a

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.429 
banded but unfortunately he's you know a
rockslide<00:02:06.180> now<00:02:06.450> and<00:02:06.689> that's<00:02:07.110> going<00:02:07.290> to<00:02:07.350> take

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
rockslide now and that's going to take

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.070 
rockslide now and that's going to take
out<00:02:07.649> my<00:02:07.680> lantern<00:02:08.250> so<00:02:09.149> lantra<00:02:09.660> doesn't<00:02:09.929> need<00:02:10.020> a
