your dry container the dry container has
a<00:00:55.199> faster<00:00:55.920> blade<00:00:56.249> than<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.579> wet<00:00:56.850> container

00:00:57.349 --> 00:00:57.359

which<00:00:57.629> is<00:00:57.749> what<00:00:57.899> typically<00:00:58.530> comes<00:00:58.859> with<00:00:59.370> your

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
which is what typically comes with your

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.149 
which is what typically comes with your
Vitamix<00:01:00.120> and<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.899> dry<00:01:01.109> container<00:01:01.350> is<00:01:01.800> used

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
and it never worked for me it may work

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.380 
and it never worked for me it may work
for<00:02:04.350> you<00:02:04.590> give<00:02:05.490> it<00:02:05.580> a<00:02:05.640> try<00:02:05.850> and<00:02:05.910> let<00:02:06.000> me<00:02:06.240> know
