hi<00:00:00.359> there<00:00:00.570> just<00:00:01.230> doing<00:00:01.380> a<00:00:01.530> bit<00:00:01.770> of<00:00:01.800> a<00:00:01.949> clip<00:00:02.370> on

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
hi there just doing a bit of a clip on

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.630 
hi there just doing a bit of a clip on
saving<00:00:03.240> eggplant<00:00:03.720> seeds<00:00:04.040> we<00:00:05.040> take<00:00:05.310> some<00:00:05.520> the

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
saving eggplant seeds we take some the

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.610 
saving eggplant seeds we take some the
other<00:00:05.670> day<00:00:06.000> and<00:00:06.299> I<00:00:07.049> thought<00:00:07.200> it<00:00:07.319> was<00:00:07.410> a<00:00:07.470> little

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
other day and I thought it was a little

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.890 
other day and I thought it was a little
bit<00:00:07.830> of<00:00:07.919> a<00:00:07.980> clip<00:00:08.160> that's<00:00:08.309> really<00:00:08.610> easy<00:00:08.820> as<00:00:09.090> one

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
bit of a clip that's really easy as one

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.230 
bit of a clip that's really easy as one
will<00:00:10.139> trick<00:00:10.349> that<00:00:10.500> we've<00:00:10.620> learnt<00:00:11.000> how<00:00:12.000> to<00:00:12.030> make

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
will trick that we've learnt how to make

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.959 
will trick that we've learnt how to make
it<00:00:12.389> easier<00:00:12.660> but<00:00:12.960> we<00:00:13.679> get<00:00:13.830> to<00:00:13.980> it<00:00:14.070> we<00:00:14.340> have<00:00:14.519> the

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
it easier but we get to it we have the

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.820 
it easier but we get to it we have the
wide<00:00:15.150> eggplant<00:00:15.660> and<00:00:15.900> that's<00:00:16.440> what<00:00:16.590> it<00:00:16.680> looks

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
wide eggplant and that's what it looks

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.330 
wide eggplant and that's what it looks
like<00:00:16.980> when<00:00:17.220> it<00:00:17.340> goes<00:00:17.520> it's<00:00:18.060> over<00:00:18.600> maturer<00:00:19.340> that

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
like when it goes it's over maturer that

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.429 
like when it goes it's over maturer that
one<00:00:20.520> there's<00:00:20.760> probably<00:00:21.750> could<00:00:21.930> lean<00:00:22.080> picked<00:00:22.320> a

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
one there's probably could lean picked a

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:23.840 
one there's probably could lean picked a
couple<00:00:22.590> of<00:00:22.769> weeks<00:00:22.920> ago<00:00:23.039> but<00:00:23.310> we<00:00:23.460> have<00:00:23.550> let<00:00:23.730> him

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
couple of weeks ago but we have let him

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.970 
couple of weeks ago but we have let him
go<00:00:24.090> to<00:00:24.150> collect<00:00:24.539> seeds<00:00:24.810> and<00:00:25.560> that's<00:00:25.680> what<00:00:25.859> they

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
go to collect seeds and that's what they

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.240 
go to collect seeds and that's what they
normally<00:00:26.130> look<00:00:26.490> like<00:00:26.550> when<00:00:26.939> we<00:00:27.060> pick<00:00:27.269> them<00:00:27.449> so

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:28.250 
normally look like when we pick them so

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.339 
normally look like when we pick them so
that's<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.490> end<00:00:29.609> um<00:00:29.820> plet<00:00:30.109> you<00:00:31.109> can<00:00:31.230> actually

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
that's the end um plet you can actually

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.490 
that's the end um plet you can actually
see<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.830> carcass<00:00:32.309> of<00:00:32.489> an<00:00:32.579> adult<00:00:32.940> Allah<00:00:33.120> their

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:33.500 
see the carcass of an adult Allah their

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.490 
see the carcass of an adult Allah their
safety<00:00:34.500> seeds<00:00:34.800> earlier<00:00:35.219> so<00:00:36.260> this<00:00:37.260> is<00:00:37.380> what

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
safety seeds earlier so this is what

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.020 
safety seeds earlier so this is what
we're<00:00:37.649> doing<00:00:37.739> now<00:00:38.010> though<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.399> long<00:00:38.579> purple

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
we're doing now though the long purple

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.729 
we're doing now though the long purple
and<00:00:39.270> that's<00:00:39.600> what<00:00:39.809> they<00:00:39.930> look<00:00:40.110> like<00:00:40.140> when<00:00:40.649> you

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
and that's what they look like when you

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.860 
and that's what they look like when you
want<00:00:40.860> to<00:00:40.920> eat<00:00:41.070> them<00:00:41.250> that's<00:00:42.180> what<00:00:42.570> they<00:00:42.719> look

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
want to eat them that's what they look

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.299 
want to eat them that's what they look
like<00:00:42.899> after<00:00:43.260> you've<00:00:43.500> left<00:00:43.649> them<00:00:43.829> on<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:44.129> ripen

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
like after you've left them on to ripen

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.049 
like after you've left them on to ripen
up<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:45.329> plant<00:00:45.600> itself<00:00:46.020> so<00:00:47.010> we<00:00:47.460> get<00:00:47.579> stuck<00:00:47.879> into

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
up the plant itself so we get stuck into

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.450 
up the plant itself so we get stuck into
it<00:00:48.980> this<00:00:49.980> is<00:00:50.100> easy<00:00:50.340> is<00:00:50.550> just<00:00:50.610> decapitating<00:00:51.539> in

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
it this is easy is just decapitating in

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.979 
it this is easy is just decapitating in
this<00:00:53.460> one<00:00:53.640> here<00:00:53.850> is<00:00:53.940> actually<00:00:54.300> being<00:00:54.539> hit<00:00:54.780> by<00:00:54.809> a

this one here is actually being hit by a
few<00:00:55.260> little<00:00:55.670> pests<00:00:56.670> so<00:00:57.420> around<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.780> bottom

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
few little pests so around the bottom

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.630 
few little pests so around the bottom
here<00:00:58.230> some<00:00:58.410> caterpillars<00:00:59.010> have<00:00:59.160> been<00:00:59.280> into<00:00:59.520> it

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
but for the purpose of saving seed

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.510 
but for the purpose of saving seed

eggplants<00:01:09.210> are<00:01:09.270> pretty<00:01:09.479> simple<00:01:10.880> all<00:01:11.880> we<00:01:12.060> used

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
eggplants are pretty simple all we used

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.820 
eggplants are pretty simple all we used
to<00:01:12.420> do<00:01:12.540> is<00:01:12.689> just<00:01:12.840> put<00:01:13.020> them<00:01:13.170> on<00:01:13.260> a<00:01:13.290> paper<00:01:13.500> towel

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
to do is just put them on a paper towel

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.219 
to do is just put them on a paper towel
scrape<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.640> seeds<00:01:14.820> out<00:01:15.060> put<00:01:15.780> them<00:01:15.900> on<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:16.020> paper

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
scrape the seeds out put them on a paper

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.980 
scrape the seeds out put them on a paper
towel<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:16.590> let<00:01:16.710> them<00:01:16.860> dry<00:01:17.100> um<00:01:17.990> but

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
towel and let them dry um but

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.840 
towel and let them dry um but
unfortunately<00:01:19.710> we<00:01:19.830> had<00:01:19.979> some<00:01:20.250> used<00:01:20.610> to<00:01:20.729> get

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
unfortunately we had some used to get

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.399 
unfortunately we had some used to get
stuck<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.299> paper<00:01:21.479> towel<00:01:21.840> so<00:01:22.080> it's<00:01:22.229> sort<00:01:22.350> of

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
stuck to the paper towel so it's sort of

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.800 
stuck to the paper towel so it's sort of
very<00:01:22.650> down<00:01:22.860> method<00:01:23.130> a<00:01:23.220> little<00:01:23.430> bit<00:01:23.549> now<00:01:23.810> and

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
very down method a little bit now and

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.670 
very down method a little bit now and
what<00:01:25.170> we<00:01:25.350> do<00:01:25.530> is<00:01:26.780> if<00:01:27.780> I<00:01:27.869> can<00:01:28.080> get<00:01:28.200> my<00:01:28.350> little

what we do is if I can get my little

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.760 
what we do is if I can get my little
spoon<00:01:29.420> and<00:01:30.420> just<00:01:30.900> to<00:01:31.049> show<00:01:31.229> you<00:01:31.290> what<00:01:31.470> we<00:01:31.619> do

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
now is as easy is just getting a spoon

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.350 
now is as easy is just getting a spoon
for<00:01:34.439> scraping<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:34.950> seeds<00:01:35.189> out<00:01:35.400> as<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.210> can

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
for scraping the seeds out as you can

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.260 
for scraping the seeds out as you can
see<00:01:36.540> this<00:01:36.689> one's<00:01:36.930> fairly<00:01:37.229> pithy<00:01:37.740> so<00:01:38.670> you<00:01:39.090> get<00:01:39.240> a

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
see this one's fairly pithy so you get a

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.880 
see this one's fairly pithy so you get a
lot<00:01:39.420> of<00:01:39.540> piss<00:01:39.720> with<00:01:39.930> it<00:01:40.079> and<00:01:40.200> actually<00:01:40.320> stick

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
lot of piss with it and actually stick

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.429 
lot of piss with it and actually stick
to<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.159> seeds<00:01:41.600> so<00:01:42.600> what<00:01:42.780> I<00:01:42.810> like<00:01:43.049> to<00:01:43.200> do<00:01:43.320> is

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
to the seeds so what I like to do is

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.039 
to the seeds so what I like to do is
just<00:01:43.470> put<00:01:43.799> it<00:01:43.920> into<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.189> water<00:01:44.460> here<00:01:44.930> if<00:01:45.930> I

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
just put it into the water here if I

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.990 
just put it into the water here if I
break<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.470> seeds<00:01:46.740> off<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.130> seeds<00:01:47.399> tend<00:01:47.759> to

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
break the seeds off the seeds tend to

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.100 
break the seeds off the seeds tend to
sink<00:01:48.270> in<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.750> pith<00:01:48.930> tends<00:01:49.290> to<00:01:49.590> float<00:01:49.829> so<00:01:51.110> just

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
sink in the pith tends to float so just

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.600 
sink in the pith tends to float so just
try<00:01:52.229> to<00:01:52.290> break<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.680> seeds<00:01:52.920> off<00:01:53.159> as<00:01:53.310> you<00:01:53.399> put

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
try to break the seeds off as you put

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.910 
try to break the seeds off as you put
them<00:01:53.729> in<00:01:54.110> they<00:01:55.110> get<00:01:55.229> too<00:01:55.409> stuck<00:01:55.680> to<00:01:55.799> your

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
them in they get too stuck to your

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.000 
them in they get too stuck to your
fingers<00:01:56.189> it<00:01:56.310> doesn't<00:01:56.610> matter

00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.010 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:00.470 

processing<00:01:59.520> using<00:01:59.760> the<00:01:59.850> water<00:02:00.060> and<00:02:00.210> they<00:02:00.300> come

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:00.480 
processing using the water and they come

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.130 
processing using the water and they come
off<00:02:01.940> you<00:02:02.940> can't<00:02:03.150> scrape<00:02:03.450> it<00:02:03.630> straight<00:02:03.870> out<00:02:03.900> on

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
off you can't scrape it straight out on

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.140 
off you can't scrape it straight out on
the<00:02:04.230> paper<00:02:04.410> like<00:02:04.680> I<00:02:04.800> said<00:02:04.980> before<00:02:05.100> but<00:02:05.550> we've

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.150 
the paper like I said before but we've

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:07.730 
the paper like I said before but we've
just<00:02:06.450> had<00:02:06.570> problems<00:02:06.960> with<00:02:07.080> them<00:02:07.230> sticking<00:02:07.530> to

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
just had problems with them sticking to

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.400 
just had problems with them sticking to
the<00:02:07.830> paper<00:02:08.510> they're<00:02:09.510> a<00:02:09.540> lot<00:02:09.720> easier<00:02:09.750> to<00:02:10.110> store

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
the paper they're a lot easier to store

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.260 
the paper they're a lot easier to store
when<00:02:10.710> their<00:02:10.860> individual<00:02:11.340> seeds<00:02:11.640> rather<00:02:11.970> than

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
when their individual seeds rather than

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.990 
when their individual seeds rather than

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.090 
being on a bunch of paper and these ones
here<00:02:15.180> will<00:02:15.360> be<00:02:15.630> up<00:02:15.780> to<00:02:15.960> offer<00:02:16.290> on<00:02:16.560> a<00:02:16.590> seed

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
here will be up to offer on a seed

saving grew for a member of and couple
now<00:02:20.280> actually<00:02:20.640> so<00:02:21.240> I'll<00:02:21.570> put<00:02:21.720> them<00:02:21.870> up<00:02:22.020> on<00:02:22.140> both

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
now actually so I'll put them up on both

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.560 
now actually so I'll put them up on both
of<00:02:22.410> them<00:02:23.480> they're<00:02:24.480> pretty<00:02:25.350> much<00:02:25.500> well<00:02:25.740> armed

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
of them they're pretty much well armed

unfortunately<00:02:30.180> I'm<00:02:30.360> as<00:02:30.600> far<00:02:30.810> as<00:02:30.930> I<00:02:31.020> know<00:02:31.170> I

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
unfortunately I'm as far as I know I

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.920 
unfortunately I'm as far as I know I
can't<00:02:31.530> send<00:02:31.800> them<00:02:31.920> overseas<00:02:32.160> and<00:02:32.880> likewise<00:02:33.750> I

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
can't send them overseas and likewise I

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.080 
can't send them overseas and likewise I
can't<00:02:34.170> get<00:02:34.380> seeds<00:02:34.650> boarding<00:02:35.130> from<00:02:35.610> overseas

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
can't get seeds boarding from overseas

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.670 
can't get seeds boarding from overseas
because<00:02:36.270> a<00:02:36.450> nice<00:02:36.630> trick<00:02:36.840> for<00:02:37.110> quarantine

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
because a nice trick for quarantine

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.170 
because a nice trick for quarantine
regulations<00:02:40.220> stop<00:02:41.220> rabbiting<00:02:41.670> on<00:02:41.730> about<00:02:41.790> that

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
regulations stop rabbiting on about that

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.550 
regulations stop rabbiting on about that
now<00:02:42.390> so<00:02:43.220> anyway<00:02:44.220> can<00:02:44.370> just<00:02:44.520> scrape<00:02:44.730> it<00:02:44.910> all<00:02:45.030> out

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
now so anyway can just scrape it all out

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.850 
now so anyway can just scrape it all out
to<00:02:46.560> the<00:02:46.680> other<00:02:46.830> half<00:02:47.100> these<00:02:47.550> are<00:02:47.610> really<00:02:48.000> nice

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
to the other half these are really nice

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.350 
to the other half these are really nice
and<00:02:49.860> claimed<00:02:50.130> by<00:02:50.280> the<00:02:50.340> way<00:02:50.520> we've<00:02:50.700> had<00:02:50.850> these

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
and claimed by the way we've had these

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.590 
and claimed by the way we've had these
for<00:02:51.690> couple<00:02:51.960> years<00:02:52.020> out<00:02:52.350> right<00:02:52.740> now<00:02:52.890> room<00:02:53.600> very

long-lasting<00:02:55.080> to<00:02:55.560> plant<00:02:55.890> we've<00:02:56.190> had<00:02:56.370> one

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
long-lasting to plant we've had one

paper<00:02:56.820> went<00:02:57.120> over<00:02:57.240> two<00:02:57.480> seasons<00:02:57.930> and<00:02:58.830> then

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
paper went over two seasons and then

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.840 
paper went over two seasons and then
easily<00:02:59.790> had<00:02:59.970> to<00:03:00.120> UM<00:03:01.070> chop<00:03:02.070> em<00:03:02.250> is<00:03:02.430> because<00:03:02.730> we

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
easily had to UM chop em is because we

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.670 
easily had to UM chop em is because we
needed<00:03:03.150> the<00:03:03.240> bed<00:03:03.390> for<00:03:03.600> some<00:03:03.690> other<00:03:03.870> stuff<00:03:04.170> and

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
needed the bed for some other stuff and

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.350 
needed the bed for some other stuff and
we've<00:03:04.950> had<00:03:05.070> other<00:03:05.190> seedlings<00:03:05.760> popping<00:03:06.120> up<00:03:06.209> in

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
we've had other seedlings popping up in

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.390 
we've had other seedlings popping up in
everywhere<00:03:06.900> so<00:03:08.150> he<00:03:09.150> acts<00:03:09.450> as<00:03:09.660> easy<00:03:09.840> as<00:03:10.050> that

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
everywhere so he acts as easy as that

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.300 
everywhere so he acts as easy as that
someone<00:03:11.400> skyping<00:03:11.970> me<00:03:12.709> will<00:03:13.709> be<00:03:13.800> someone<00:03:14.100> in<00:03:14.220> a

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
someone skyping me will be someone in a

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.820 
someone skyping me will be someone in a
bird<00:03:14.700> suit

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.940 

so<00:03:19.490> now<00:03:19.780> the<00:03:20.780> physic<00:03:21.050> up<00:03:21.170> so<00:03:21.320> many<00:03:21.470> seeds<00:03:21.800> are

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
so now the physic up so many seeds are

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.590 
so now the physic up so many seeds are
not<00:03:22.040> overly<00:03:22.700> worried<00:03:22.970> about<00:03:23.150> the<00:03:23.300> ones<00:03:23.450> I'm

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600 
not overly worried about the ones I'm

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.050 
not overly worried about the ones I'm
going<00:03:23.780> to<00:03:23.840> lose<00:03:23.930> with<00:03:24.140> the<00:03:24.260> pith

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
going to lose with the pith

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.790 
going to lose with the pith
but<00:03:26.060> it's<00:03:26.180> just<00:03:26.450> a<00:03:26.570> matter<00:03:26.780> of<00:03:26.930> I'm<00:03:27.230> getting<00:03:27.710> a

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:27.800 
but it's just a matter of I'm getting a

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.550 
but it's just a matter of I'm getting a
spoon<00:03:28.130> and<00:03:28.910> I'm<00:03:29.330> spooning<00:03:29.750> off<00:03:30.050> the<00:03:30.200> lips<00:03:30.380> of
