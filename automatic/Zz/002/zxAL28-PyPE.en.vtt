00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:15.240
 in the summer period the great variety of 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:19.710
 fruits and vegetables allows us to use the 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.600
 fantasy in the kitchen and often maybe not 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.689
 we go to consume the fruit and the 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.609
 vegetables as they can be prepared 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.189
 alternating excellent alternatives 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.759
 both for large and small for 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.680
 example smoothies using your own 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:40.559
 fantasy but also using colors us 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:43.140
 very important to try to vary myself 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:47.670
 I give you some some recipes for example 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:50.700
 carrot and celery smoothie for 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.770
 example you can put 23 carrots 2 stems 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.590
 celery obviously washed very well 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.350
 you can add a pinch of ginger 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.199
 and also half 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.700
 half a squeezed lemon this is great 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:07.350
 Challenger smoothie and also diuretic 

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:09.690
 because celery has properties 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.360
 important diuretic 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:15.509
 another another idea the 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.420
 strawberry then take 67 strawberries 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:21.149
 aisles very well and add some 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.060
 ice or water if you want one 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:25.380
 add more granita-like consistency 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.890
 of the ice 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:32.069
 if you want a more liquid smoothie instead 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:36.990
 add water in association with 

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:41.240
 ice another smoothie very welcome 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:45.750
 and the apple smoothie with as little as you can 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:49.890
 put 2 3 slices of melon add 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:54.560
 a 125 gram yoghurt jar of 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:58.080
 natural or whole yogurt 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:00.600
 with the addition of ice if you want one 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:04.650
 more liquid consistency you can 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:08.250
 add also or water or half 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:11.220
 glass of whole milk 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.380
 these are excellent alternatives that 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.470
 can be used during 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.930
 snacks but also and during the first 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.750
 breakfast to start the day well 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.120
 then to give the right charge of 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.690
 nutrients 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:29.400
 in addition to smoothies you can also 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:34.500
 prepare some excellent fruit salads 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:37.140
 fruit using variety or maybe for i 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.510
 smaller and encourage them to consume 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.540
 the fruit you can use colors that 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.430
 at this time of year the great one 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:48.230
 variety of fruits and vegetables allows 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.230
 have a lot of choice
