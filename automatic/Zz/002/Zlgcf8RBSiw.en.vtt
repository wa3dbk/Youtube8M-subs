2<00:01:55.970> or<00:01:56.000> 3<00:01:56.510> arc<00:01:56.840> I<00:01:57.140> remember<00:01:57.470> which<00:01:57.560> part<00:01:57.890> is

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.040 
2 or 3 arc I remember which part is

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.830 
2 or 3 arc I remember which part is
because<00:01:58.490> I<00:01:58.549> think<00:01:58.729> I've<00:01:58.909> recorded<00:01:59.240> part<00:01:59.570> 2<00:01:59.720> but

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
because I think I've recorded part 2 but

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.100 
because I think I've recorded part 2 but
it's<00:01:59.960> not<00:02:00.140> yet<00:02:00.500> but<00:02:01.010> anyway<00:02:01.310> yeah<00:02:01.520> the

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
it's not yet but anyway yeah the

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.630 
it's not yet but anyway yeah the
Horseman's<00:02:03.110> blade<00:02:03.290> is<00:02:03.470> really<00:02:04.070> strong<00:02:04.400> and

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
Horseman's blade is really strong and

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.600 
Horseman's blade is really strong and
also<00:02:05.479> the<00:02:06.049> tera<00:02:06.830> blade<00:02:07.040> is<00:02:07.130> really<00:02:07.250> strong<00:02:07.549> but

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
also the tera blade is really strong but

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.080 
also the tera blade is really strong but
on<00:02:07.909> the<00:02:08.030> Xbox<00:02:08.569> version<00:02:08.959> I<00:02:09.140> believe<00:02:09.490> that<00:02:10.490> the

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
on the Xbox version I believe that the

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.130 
on the Xbox version I believe that the
Horseman's<00:02:11.690> blades

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
Horseman's blades

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.770 
Horseman's blades
stronger<00:02:13.010> only<00:02:13.459> because<00:02:13.819> it<00:02:13.940> is<00:02:14.060> auto<00:02:14.330> switch

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
stronger only because it is auto switch

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.230 
stronger only because it is auto switch
so<00:02:15.380> as<00:02:15.470> you<00:02:15.620> saw<00:02:15.800> there<00:02:16.040> that<00:02:16.190> was<00:02:16.340> my<00:02:16.490> trap<00:02:16.850> so

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
so as you saw there that was my trap so

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.199 
so as you saw there that was my trap so
I<00:02:17.330> use<00:02:17.630> when<00:02:18.170> I<00:02:18.200> am<00:02:18.440> farming<00:02:18.980> just<00:02:19.400> randomly

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
I use when I am farming just randomly

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:22.480 
I use when I am farming just randomly
I'd<00:02:20.600> usually<00:02:20.870> sit<00:02:21.350> in<00:02:21.380> there<00:02:21.650> and<00:02:21.890> let<00:02:22.310> things

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
I'd usually sit in there and let things

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.520 
I'd usually sit in there and let things
come<00:02:22.700> and<00:02:22.790> attack<00:02:23.060> me<00:02:23.090> and<00:02:23.630> I<00:02:24.050> got<00:02:24.380> a<00:02:24.410> load<00:02:24.500> of

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
come and attack me and I got a load of

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.949 
come and attack me and I got a load of
crazy<00:02:24.800> things<00:02:25.160> it's<00:02:25.520> a<00:02:25.640> really<00:02:25.670> good<00:02:26.209> trap<00:02:26.690> for

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
crazy things it's a really good trap for

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:29.290 
crazy things it's a really good trap for
key<00:02:27.140> molds<00:02:27.530> as<00:02:27.950> you<00:02:28.100> can<00:02:28.220> just<00:02:28.340> see<00:02:28.580> there<00:02:28.819> so<00:02:29.270> i

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
key molds as you can just see there so i

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.490 
key molds as you can just see there so i
shooting<00:02:29.660> a<00:02:29.720> star<00:02:30.110> cannon<00:02:31.750> and<00:02:32.750> why<00:02:33.200> should

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
shooting a star cannon and why should

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.010

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
poking heads the spawn of it they also

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.699 
poking heads the spawn of it they also
do<00:03:40.459> like<00:03:40.640> the<00:03:40.910> same<00:03:41.269> if<00:03:41.630> not<00:03:41.810> more<00:03:41.870> damage
