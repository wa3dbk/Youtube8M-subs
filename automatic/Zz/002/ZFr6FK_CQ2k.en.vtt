 digital to analog converter project 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.630
 duck box ds 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.970
 equipped with three yuzbi optical and 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.840
 coaxial device is made on the base 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:24.750
 pcm 1792 chips from the company texex 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.699
 tool and yusbi connection can 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.300
 receive digital stream with parameters 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:32.969
 24 bits 192 kilohertz in asynchronous 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.980
 mode converter supports 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.660
 audio signals with all standard 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:41.219
 sampling rates 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:43.980
 including a multiple of 44.1 kilohertz sap 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.379
 project dac box ds works with 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.210
 eightfold resampling input 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.180
 signal that allows significantly 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.500
 improve processing accuracy 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.110
 low-level signals and reduce 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.829
 high frequency noise 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.469
 there are two options 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.500
 characteristics of the digital filter step and 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.359
 optimum face each has its own 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.949
 subjective advantage when 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.439
 listening to one or another 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.450
 musical material and the best of 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.930
 they can be selected by user 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.540
 taste 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.280
 ultra linear analog circuit 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.070
 the converter is made of 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.240
 upscale components and 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:21.299
 provides low output impedance 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.659
 project that allows the device well 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.320
 combined with various amplifiers and 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:27.630
 connecting cables 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.909
 the device is made in metal 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.280
 casing and has a thick aluminum 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.560
 front panel converter 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.350
 provides very high quality 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.590
 sound when you connect the PDA and to 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.729
 anyone about aids in signal source 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.040
 project big box ds 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.649
 has a balanced and dynamic 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.450
 the nature of the sound is very musical and 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.149
 not tiresome even at the very 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.740
 long listening this compact 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.049
 and relatively inexpensive apparatus 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.630
 allow you to re-evaluate the quality 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:00.060
 sound of your music collection and 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:04.040
 will be a very effective upgrade 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.040
 existing audio system
