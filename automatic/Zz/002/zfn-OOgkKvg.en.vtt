 the writers of this publishing going on 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:02.379
 real chaos and this is proof 

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:03.339
 parallel universe called 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:06.310

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.720
 drive excuse i still won't tell 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.670
 politically correct in general by blacks 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.830
 versions of superheroes in particular and 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.900
 the local superman is kinda like a hut 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.270
 Obama was charged from him and local 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.760

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.410

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.050
 fact number two i don't know why but we 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:36.610

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:37.060
 The second fact concerns marvel and and nick 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.010

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.070

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.510
 permissions by the way redid this 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.820
 your comic character giving it 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:53.740
 appearance of a famous actor rose 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.380
 a certain buzz among reading comics 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.300
 people and samuel jackson himself contacted 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.390
 marvel atoms and apparently threw off his 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:03.790
 in money until he agreed the fact 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.530
 number three story about the confrontation 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.640
 batman and superman which is kind of like 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.860

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.000
 long ago 2002 for example over this 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.010
 the project was very active then 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.360
 having some problems with 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.670
 financing and project 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.560
 mothballed until better times but 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.480
 then created an official poster 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.209
 movie poster was used as 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.070
 Well, jokes or easter eggs of the movie I'm a legend with 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:29.780

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.580
 fact number four in the marvel universe 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.800
 there is a daily realistic team 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.930
 animal avengers which are included 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.860
 masses of creatures possessing abilities 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.600
 superheroes 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.459
 the most famous among them is 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.950
 of course super + varnish jo 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:52.370
 However , such characters as touch 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:55.280
 mixture of torus and fraga ie torus frogs 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.050
 or for example herbal hairball in 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.090
 translation which is an adaptation 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:00.950
 speedball is such a cute cat and they 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.170
 Of course deserve attention even in this 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:06.100
 the detachment has a dog barrack obama god 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.810

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:11.330
 fact number five no longer know why and 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:14.090
 why but in the di di universe sometime 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:16.579
 was created by the villain who called up 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:19.220
 elder and actually all that he could 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:20.560
 do it weld the people of the dead 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.959
 dogs to face 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:26.470
 welding machine what the fuck is here 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:29.360

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:31.130
 fact number six marvel are very fond 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.709
 use popular personalities in 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.420
 their comics year so in 2008 they 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:36.950
 there was a camilla with a barrack obama who 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:40.130
 turned out to be a big comic book fan 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:42.230
 But even close is not so cool 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:44.900
 like something like the view is 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:47.540
 permanent character and internal 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:50.150
 heroes of the universe marvel and even somehow 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:53.360
 helped the punisher charge the villains when 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:56.209
 help mini ultrasound and fact number 7 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.680
 an old 1997 movie batman and 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:59.329
 robin in which arnold schwarzenegger 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.400
 played mister frieze george clooney 

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:02.780
 Batman directly considered 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.299
 fans of one of the most failures 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:07.430
 comic movie I personally think that this 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:08.859
 just funny witty skitter 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.390
 cool actors with good jokes 

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:13.700
 cool history latex costumes 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:15.620
 with protruding nipples with this movie 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.760
 connected a lot of fun for example 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.070
 when once in 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.620
 view george clooney asked agreed 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:23.540
 either he play gay movies he said that 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.130
 already did it exactly the movie batman and 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:27.500
 Robin 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:29.660
 fact number 8 writers from marvel to 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:32.210
 far 2003 they planned to make 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:35.120
 a small series of X-Men adventures 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:37.100
 which was supposed to get and come alive 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.410
 princess diana who would turn out 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.340
 mutants with their own 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:42.370
 superpowers happiness this 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:45.560
 idiotic plan failed 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:47.960
 fact number 9 once scriptwriter odessa 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.630
 have come up with and even led to the comics new 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.520
 superhero whose name was white he was 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:54.680
 superhero break dance which 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.360
 danced in the name of justice seriously 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.340
 right so there said during 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.620
 dance he created waves of sound or 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.780
 energy that harmed programs 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:06.020
 true hero was so lame that 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:08.570
 after a couple of releases his fact number killed 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:10.910
 10 in the marvel universe has its freaks 

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:12.830
 for example and mister immortal that is and 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:14.120
 immortal he is a superhero though 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:15.880
 does not possess any 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:18.500
 except for superpowers 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:20.450
 the impossibility of dying rather die then 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:22.700
 he can but then comes alive again and 

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:24.530
 thanks to the comics 

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:26.500
 and killed countless times 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:29.540
 in the strangest sophisticated ways 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:31.550
 And finally, in America it turns out 

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:33.980
 There is a company that makes masks 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:35.930
 rorshah and she uses ink in them 

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:38.990
 who are starting to change their form on 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:40.790
 human respiratory tissue and the increase 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:43.310
 temperatures end up the same 

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:44.840
 the most effect as a shah resort during life 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:46.700
 very cool stuff on and unfortunately 

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:48.560
 found myself in this company bigger and 

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:50.990
 official site however i think 

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:53.270

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:54.890

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:57.020
 comic facts that I have in 

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:59.240

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:01.040
 this small portion and I will 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:03.140
 Of course it's interesting to know how much 

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:05.090

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:08.330

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:20.060
 these facts already knew and which are not for 

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:22.190
