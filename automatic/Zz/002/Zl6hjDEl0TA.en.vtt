00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
time so he was watching the watchtower

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.820 
time so he was watching the watchtower
here<00:04:34.080> and<00:04:36.020> how<00:04:37.020> I<00:04:37.050> can<00:04:37.110> tell<00:04:37.440> he's<00:04:37.590> doing<00:04:37.800> a

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
here and how I can tell he's doing a

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.120 
here and how I can tell he's doing a
three<00:04:38.040> get<00:04:38.190> expand<00:04:38.580> is<00:04:39.380> going<00:04:40.380> to<00:04:40.470> be<00:04:40.620> up<00:04:41.070> to

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
three get expand is going to be up to

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:43.909 
three get expand is going to be up to
these<00:04:41.580> a<00:04:41.610> zergling<00:04:42.300> to<00:04:43.200> game<00:04:43.410> is<00:04:43.530> coming<00:04:43.680> down

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919 
these a zergling to game is coming down

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:45.770 
these a zergling to game is coming down
so<00:04:44.130> we<00:04:44.250> do<00:04:44.340> have<00:04:44.370> three<00:04:44.730> gateways<00:04:45.150> which<00:04:45.480> means

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
so we do have three gateways which means

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.450 
so we do have three gateways which means
he<00:04:46.169> will<00:04:46.350> probably<00:04:46.710> do<00:04:47.010> the<00:04:47.130> three<00:04:47.280> gate

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
he will probably do the three gate

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.790 
he will probably do the three gate
expand<00:04:47.790> three<00:04:48.570> signals<00:04:48.960> coming<00:04:49.140> here<00:04:49.350> see<00:04:49.680> as

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
expand three signals coming here see as

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.150 
expand three signals coming here see as
Ella<00:04:50.100> and<00:04:50.370> a<00:04:50.430> century<00:04:50.730> which<00:04:52.160> centuries

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
Ella and a century which centuries

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.440 
Ella and a century which centuries
equals<00:04:53.610> three<00:04:54.000> gate<00:04:54.180> expand<00:04:54.600> by<00:04:54.870> the<00:04:54.930> way<00:04:55.169> so

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:56.450 
equals three gate expand by the way so

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:59.120 
equals three gate expand by the way so
what<00:04:57.450> I<00:04:57.479> used<00:04:57.750> to<00:04:57.870> do<00:04:58.050> to<00:04:58.200> counter<00:04:58.590> the<00:04:58.740> 38

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
what I used to do to counter the 38

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.730 
what I used to do to counter the 38
expands<00:04:59.729> was<00:05:00.000> a<00:05:00.330> bunch<00:05:00.960> of<00:05:01.229> freaking

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
weird angle like here and sees all my

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.890 
weird angle like here and sees all my
zerglings<00:05:17.250> it's<00:05:17.940> kind<00:05:18.120> of<00:05:18.180> game<00:05:18.360> over<00:05:18.660> because

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:18.900 
zerglings it's kind of game over because

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.870 
zerglings it's kind of game over because
i<00:05:19.110> have<00:05:19.229> to<00:05:19.320> either<00:05:19.440> go<00:05:19.979> in<00:05:20.220> and<00:05:20.430> hope<00:05:20.610> that<00:05:20.760> he

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 
i have to either go in and hope that he

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.770 
i have to either go in and hope that he
doesn't<00:05:21.270> have<00:05:21.510> enough<00:05:21.690> centuries<00:05:22.169> or<00:05:23.510> not<00:05:24.510> do
