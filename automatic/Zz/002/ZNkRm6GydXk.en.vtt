part<00:02:41.020> of<00:02:41.170> cloud<00:02:41.410> is<00:02:41.680> actually<00:02:42.220> real<00:02:42.550> cloth<00:02:43.050> the

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
part of cloud is actually real cloth the

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.740 
part of cloud is actually real cloth the
only<00:02:44.560> thing<00:02:44.830> that<00:02:45.400> I<00:02:45.610> don't<00:02:45.670> like<00:02:46.120> about<00:02:46.360> it

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
only thing that I don't like about it

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.150 
only thing that I don't like about it
because<00:02:47.110> I<00:02:47.350> do<00:02:47.530> like<00:02:47.830> that<00:02:47.860> they<00:02:48.130> actually

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
because I do like that they actually

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.860 
because I do like that they actually
made<00:02:48.550> out<00:02:48.670> of<00:02:48.760> cloth<00:02:49.000> the<00:02:49.330> only<00:02:49.510> thing<00:02:49.660> I<00:02:49.810> don't

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
made out of cloth the only thing I don't

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.780 
made out of cloth the only thing I don't
like<00:02:50.260> about<00:02:50.530> it<00:02:51.090> is<00:02:52.090> this<00:02:52.450> stain<00:02:53.440> right<00:02:54.280> there

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
like about it is this stain right there

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.390 
like about it is this stain right there
I<00:02:54.870> guess<00:02:55.870> cloud<00:02:56.200> was<00:02:56.470> to<00:02:56.590> be<00:02:56.680> a<00:02:56.710> messy<00:02:57.160> eater

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
I guess cloud was to be a messy eater

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.970 
I guess cloud was to be a messy eater
because<00:02:57.760> I<00:02:58.180> certainly<00:02:58.630> didn't<00:02:59.020> do<00:02:59.170> that<00:02:59.380> and

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
because I certainly didn't do that and

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.950 
because I certainly didn't do that and
that<00:03:00.730> is<00:03:00.940> his<00:03:01.180> sword<00:03:01.510> a<00:03:01.630> backpack<00:03:02.250> it's<00:03:03.960> really

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:04.960 
that is his sword a backpack it's really

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.890 
that is his sword a backpack it's really
flimsy<00:03:05.710> like<00:03:06.010> that<00:03:06.190> so<00:03:06.490> I<00:03:06.790> wouldn't<00:03:07.510> do<00:03:07.630> it<00:03:07.660> too

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
flimsy like that so I wouldn't do it too

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.010 
flimsy like that so I wouldn't do it too
much<00:03:08.050> like<00:03:08.500> a<00:03:08.800> lot<00:03:09.460> of<00:03:09.610> his<00:03:09.760> parts<00:03:10.090> here<00:03:10.300> you

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:11.020 
much like a lot of his parts here you

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.740 
much like a lot of his parts here you
might<00:03:11.200> break<00:03:11.350> the<00:03:11.530> pieces<00:03:11.710> up<00:03:12.240> up<00:03:13.240> there<00:03:13.540> so

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
might break the pieces up up there so

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.490 
might break the pieces up up there so
yeah<00:03:14.110> just<00:03:14.410> be<00:03:14.530> careful<00:03:15.540> okay<00:03:16.540> so<00:03:16.720> let's<00:03:17.200> get

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
yeah just be careful okay so let's get

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.950 
yeah just be careful okay so let's get
right<00:03:17.770> into<00:03:17.830> the<00:03:18.130> articulation<00:03:19.000> press<00:03:19.750> wall

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:19.960 
right into the articulation press wall

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.220 
right into the articulation press wall
the<00:03:20.200> head<00:03:20.470> can<00:03:21.310> move<00:03:21.340> down<00:03:22.150> and<00:03:22.480> up<00:03:22.720> like<00:03:23.020> that

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
the head can move down and up like that

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.100 
the head can move down and up like that
a<00:03:23.470> tiny<00:03:23.770> bit<00:03:24.040> the<00:03:24.880> neck<00:03:25.150> joint<00:03:25.540> and<00:03:25.750> the<00:03:25.959> head

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
a tiny bit the neck joint and the head

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.140 
a tiny bit the neck joint and the head
joint<00:03:26.320> are<00:03:26.560> two<00:03:26.739> separate<00:03:27.130> things<00:03:27.160> he<00:03:27.970> can

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
joint are two separate things he can

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:29.910 
joint are two separate things he can
look<00:03:28.300> to<00:03:28.420> the<00:03:28.510> side<00:03:28.720> a<00:03:28.750> little<00:03:29.050> bit<00:03:29.170> but<00:03:29.680> his

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
look to the side a little bit but his

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.150 
look to the side a little bit but his
high<00:03:30.160> collar<00:03:30.489> is<00:03:30.790> actually<00:03:32.010> inhibiting<00:03:33.010> his

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
high collar is actually inhibiting his

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.590 
high collar is actually inhibiting his
move<00:03:33.370> his<00:03:33.760> arms<00:03:34.180> can<00:03:34.810> go<00:03:35.770> up<00:03:35.980> like<00:03:36.130> this<00:03:36.600> this

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
move his arms can go up like this this

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.570 
move his arms can go up like this this
side<00:03:37.840> can't<00:03:38.110> go<00:03:38.230> up<00:03:38.440> as<00:03:38.680> high<00:03:38.860> as<00:03:38.920> this<00:03:39.190> cause

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580 
side can't go up as high as this cause

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:45.210 
side can't go up as high as this cause
the<00:03:39.790> shoulder<00:03:40.120> pad<00:03:40.300> but<00:03:40.930> that's<00:03:41.080> a<00:03:41.200> given<00:03:44.220> his

the shoulder pad but that's a given his
arm<00:03:45.580> can<00:03:46.060> go<00:03:46.300> up<00:03:46.930> and<00:03:47.260> forward<00:03:47.800> like<00:03:48.310> that<00:03:48.959> his

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
arm can go up and forward like that his

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:56.729 
arm can go up and forward like that his
biceps<00:03:50.800> can<00:03:51.250> turn<00:03:53.880> like<00:03:54.880> that<00:03:55.410> via<00:03:56.410> the

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
biceps can turn like that via the

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:00.390 
biceps can turn like that via the
shoulder<00:03:57.010> pad<00:03:57.160> can<00:03:57.370> move<00:03:58.050> he<00:03:59.050> can<00:03:59.320> bend<00:04:00.220> his

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
hand like that his wrist can also twist

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.290 
hand like that his wrist can also twist
and<00:04:05.860> Bend<00:04:06.730> like<00:04:07.269> that<00:04:07.590> so<00:04:08.590> yeah<00:04:09.130> but<00:04:10.120> if<00:04:10.209> you

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:10.300 
and Bend like that so yeah but if you

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:14.520

a weird wrist band the chest can bend

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.580 
a weird wrist band the chest can bend
down<00:04:20.680> a<00:04:20.919> tiny<00:04:21.250> bit<00:04:21.519> and<00:04:21.750> up<00:04:22.750> a<00:04:22.930> tiny<00:04:23.200> bit<00:04:23.320> is

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
down a tiny bit and up a tiny bit is

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.950 
down a tiny bit and up a tiny bit is
very<00:04:24.070> stiff<00:04:24.610> and<00:04:24.820> I<00:04:25.120> wouldn't<00:04:25.390> recommend<00:04:25.660> you

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
very stiff and I wouldn't recommend you

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.650 
very stiff and I wouldn't recommend you
moving<00:04:26.680> it<00:04:26.800> a<00:04:26.919> lot<00:04:27.130> because<00:04:27.550> this<00:04:27.970> sash<00:04:28.419> right

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660 
moving it a lot because this sash right

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.060 
moving it a lot because this sash right
here<00:04:28.840> might<00:04:29.200> actually<00:04:29.440> rip<00:04:29.830> off

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.070 
here might actually rip off

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:34.150 
here might actually rip off
you<00:04:31.400> can<00:04:31.550> look<00:04:31.730> to<00:04:31.790> the<00:04:32.090> side<00:04:32.720> a<00:04:32.750> tiny<00:04:33.380> bit<00:04:33.680> but

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
you can look to the side a tiny bit but

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:39.610 
you can look to the side a tiny bit but
again<00:04:34.280> is<00:04:34.630> very<00:04:35.630> stiff<00:04:36.280> his<00:04:37.280> legs<00:04:37.550> and<00:04:38.440> do<00:04:39.440> the

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620 
again is very stiff his legs and do the

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:50.020 
again is very stiff his legs and do the
splits<00:04:40.780> come<00:04:41.780> back<00:04:46.660> like<00:04:47.660> that<00:04:48.760> you<00:04:49.760> can<00:04:49.910> also

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
splits come back like that you can also

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.160 
splits come back like that you can also
twist<00:04:50.390> them<00:04:50.630> this<00:04:51.620> piece<00:04:51.890> right<00:04:52.040> here<00:04:52.100> this

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:53.170 
twist them this piece right here this

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:58.390 
twist them this piece right here this
sash<00:04:54.170> I<00:04:54.410> guess<00:04:54.590> is<00:04:54.860> a<00:04:55.630> wireframe<00:04:56.630> so<00:04:57.380> spend<00:04:58.310> a

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
sash I guess is a wireframe so spend a

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:04.720 
sash I guess is a wireframe so spend a
boat<00:04:58.550> like<00:04:58.670> that<00:04:59.590> really<00:05:00.590> nice<00:05:03.340> his<00:05:04.340> knee<00:05:04.520> can

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:04.730 
boat like that really nice his knee can

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:06.130 
boat like that really nice his knee can
bend<00:05:04.850> all<00:05:05.030> the<00:05:05.060> way<00:05:05.210> like<00:05:05.420> that<00:05:05.600> which<00:05:06.110> is

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:06.140 
bend all the way like that which is

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:09.180 
bend all the way like that which is
really<00:05:06.320> nice

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:09.190 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:11.760 

this<00:05:10.190> piece<00:05:10.430> of<00:05:10.580> his<00:05:10.730> clothing<00:05:10.970> can<00:05:11.360> also<00:05:11.510> move

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:11.770 
this piece of his clothing can also move

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.100 
this piece of his clothing can also move
but<00:05:12.770> like<00:05:12.950> again<00:05:12.980> it<00:05:13.580> might<00:05:13.790> break<00:05:14.660> here<00:05:14.900> so<00:05:14.930> I

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.110 
but like again it might break here so I

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:16.540 
but like again it might break here so I
wouldn't<00:05:15.440> really<00:05:15.620> recommend<00:05:15.740> moving<00:05:16.340> it<00:05:16.430> a

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:16.550 
wouldn't really recommend moving it a

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:23.920 
wouldn't really recommend moving it a

lot his ankle can tilt to the side like

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:29.020 
lot his ankle can tilt to the side like
that<00:05:25.030> can<00:05:26.030> also<00:05:26.210> bend<00:05:26.600> down<00:05:26.890> back<00:05:27.890> up<00:05:28.100> you<00:05:28.970> can

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:29.030

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:32.170 
that can also bend down back up you can
twist<00:05:29.390> it<00:05:29.570> like<00:05:29.750> that<00:05:30.610> you<00:05:31.610> can<00:05:31.730> sense<00:05:31.940> it<00:05:32.030> like

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:32.180

that's<00:05:35.420> actually<00:05:35.570> possible<00:05:35.870> inhuman<00:05:36.440> but

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:36.620 
that's actually possible inhuman but

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:41.860 
that's actually possible inhuman but
whatever<00:05:36.890> his<00:05:37.790> toes<00:05:39.520> can<00:05:40.520> bend<00:05:40.730> up<00:05:40.880> like<00:05:41.690> that
