00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.899 

one<00:01:30.650> of<00:01:30.740> the<00:01:30.800> great<00:01:30.950> features<00:01:31.369> about<00:01:31.400> the

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:31.909 
one of the great features about the

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:34.090 
one of the great features about the
California<00:01:32.570> Zephyr<00:01:32.869> car<00:01:33.350> is<00:01:33.470> the<00:01:33.650> lighting

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
California Zephyr car is the lighting

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.670 
California Zephyr car is the lighting
and<00:01:34.280> we<00:01:35.240> put<00:01:35.390> a<00:01:35.450> circuit<00:01:35.810> board<00:01:35.990> in<00:01:36.170> every<00:01:36.409> car

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
and we put a circuit board in every car

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.120 
and we put a circuit board in every car
and<00:01:37.119> that<00:01:38.119> regulates<00:01:39.020> the<00:01:39.200> power<00:01:39.409> so<00:01:39.770> it<00:01:39.920> works

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
and that regulates the power so it works

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.510 
and that regulates the power so it works
fine<00:01:40.640> on<00:01:40.880> DC<00:01:41.600> or<00:01:41.780> on<00:01:41.930> DCC<00:01:42.590> and<00:01:42.830> one<00:01:43.369> of<00:01:43.460> the

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
fine on DC or on DCC and one of the

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.130 
fine on DC or on DCC and one of the
problems<00:01:43.940> with<00:01:44.090> passenger<00:01:44.600> cars<00:01:44.810> is<00:01:44.990> you've

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
problems with passenger cars is you've

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.530 
problems with passenger cars is you've
got<00:01:45.320> it<00:01:46.009> takes<00:01:46.280> so<00:01:46.490> many<00:01:46.580> lights<00:01:46.909> to<00:01:47.149> light<00:01:47.300> the

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
got it takes so many lights to light the

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.330 
got it takes so many lights to light the
thing<00:01:47.780> they<00:01:48.350> can<00:01:48.530> tend<00:01:48.710> to<00:01:48.800> draw<00:01:48.979> too<00:01:49.040> much

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
thing they can tend to draw too much

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:50.920 
thing they can tend to draw too much
power<00:01:49.670> and<00:01:49.970> you<00:01:50.060> think<00:01:50.270> about<00:01:50.330> a<00:01:50.509> set<00:01:50.780> that's

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
power and you think about a set that's

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.649 
power and you think about a set that's
got<00:01:51.229> you<00:01:51.560> know<00:01:51.680> 10<00:01:52.250> or<00:01:52.280> 20<00:01:52.610> cars<00:01:52.909> on<00:01:53.149> it<00:01:53.300> a<00:01:53.479> lot

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
got you know 10 or 20 cars on it a lot

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:55.540 
got you know 10 or 20 cars on it a lot
of<00:01:53.780> Transformers<00:01:54.440> won't<00:01:54.649> handle<00:01:55.130> that<00:01:55.220> start

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:55.550 
of Transformers won't handle that start

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.230 
of Transformers won't handle that start
up<00:01:55.670> power<00:01:55.880> so<00:01:56.450> what<00:01:56.570> we<00:01:56.720> do<00:01:56.929> is<00:01:57.140> we<00:01:57.950> on<00:01:58.460> the

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
up power so what we do is we on the

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.620 
up power so what we do is we on the
circuit<00:01:59.600> board<00:01:59.840> we've<00:02:00.470> got<00:02:00.850> four<00:02:01.850> LEDs<00:02:02.300> two

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
circuit board we've got four LEDs two

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.960 
circuit board we've got four LEDs two
pointing<00:02:03.020> in<00:02:03.350> one<00:02:03.740> direction<00:02:03.920> two<00:02:04.640> pointing

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
pointing in one direction two pointing

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.120 
pointing in one direction two pointing
in<00:02:05.030> the<00:02:05.149> other<00:02:05.179> and<00:02:05.570> each<00:02:06.259> of<00:02:06.440> those<00:02:06.530> LEDs

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
in the other and each of those LEDs

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.259 
in the other and each of those LEDs
lights<00:02:07.970> up<00:02:08.239> a<00:02:08.420> row<00:02:08.630> of<00:02:08.810> prisms<00:02:09.380> and<00:02:10.060> each<00:02:11.060> of

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:11.269 
lights up a row of prisms and each of

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:13.750 
lights up a row of prisms and each of
these<00:02:11.330> prisms<00:02:11.810> are<00:02:11.930> cut<00:02:12.170> into<00:02:12.470> a<00:02:12.500> plastic<00:02:13.160> lens

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
these prisms are cut into a plastic lens

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.180 
these prisms are cut into a plastic lens
at<00:02:14.060> the<00:02:14.090> top<00:02:14.420> of<00:02:14.630> each<00:02:14.750> car<00:02:15.170> and<00:02:15.380> when<00:02:16.070> the

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
at the top of each car and when the

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:17.590 
at the top of each car and when the
light<00:02:16.370> hits<00:02:16.730> that<00:02:16.850> prison

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
light hits that prison

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.240 
light hits that prison
it<00:02:17.810> reflects<00:02:18.290> down<00:02:18.560> into<00:02:18.800> the<00:02:18.890> car<00:02:19.100> at<00:02:19.190> that

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
it reflects down into the car at that

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.520 
it reflects down into the car at that
area<00:02:19.670> it<00:02:20.120> simulates<00:02:20.510> a<00:02:20.840> row<00:02:20.989> of<00:02:21.140> overhead

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
area it simulates a row of overhead

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.800 
area it simulates a row of overhead
lighting<00:02:21.769> in<00:02:22.010> the<00:02:22.100> car<00:02:22.340> and<00:02:22.610> to<00:02:23.390> keep<00:02:23.540> it<00:02:23.720> from

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
lighting in the car and to keep it from

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.020 
lighting in the car and to keep it from
getting<00:02:23.989> dimmer<00:02:24.380> out<00:02:24.620> near<00:02:24.860> the<00:02:24.890> end<00:02:25.040> we<00:02:25.760> put<00:02:25.970> a

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
getting dimmer out near the end we put a

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.970 
getting dimmer out near the end we put a
series<00:02:26.450> of<00:02:26.570> mirrors<00:02:26.840> in<00:02:27.110> there<00:02:27.320> and<00:02:27.500> that

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
series of mirrors in there and that

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.710 
series of mirrors in there and that
brightens<00:02:28.489> up<00:02:28.610> the<00:02:28.670> ends<00:02:29.030> of<00:02:29.120> the<00:02:29.209> cars<00:02:29.450> I

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
brightens up the ends of the cars I

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.650 
brightens up the ends of the cars I
think<00:02:29.989> it<00:02:30.049> gives<00:02:30.200> a<00:02:30.290> really<00:02:30.590> nice<00:02:30.739> effect<00:02:30.890> and

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
think it gives a really nice effect and

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.819 
think it gives a really nice effect and
doesn't<00:02:32.660> draw<00:02:32.780> too<00:02:32.840> much<00:02:33.140> power<00:02:33.410> for<00:02:33.530> most

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:33.829 
doesn't draw too much power for most

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:37.569 
doesn't draw too much power for most
people's<00:02:34.190> transformers<00:02:36.190> another<00:02:37.190> thing<00:02:37.430> that

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:37.579 
people's transformers another thing that

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:39.160 
people's transformers another thing that
a<00:02:37.610> lot<00:02:37.640> of<00:02:37.790> people<00:02:38.090> ask<00:02:38.239> us<00:02:38.480> about<00:02:38.630> is<00:02:38.959> the

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
a lot of people ask us about is the

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:40.750 
a lot of people ask us about is the
finish<00:02:39.590> and<00:02:39.799> you<00:02:39.890> notice<00:02:40.190> the<00:02:40.310> finish<00:02:40.610> on

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
finish and you notice the finish on

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.990 
finish and you notice the finish on
these<00:02:40.880> it<00:02:41.420> really<00:02:41.930> does<00:02:42.140> a<00:02:42.170> nice<00:02:42.530> job<00:02:42.560> of
