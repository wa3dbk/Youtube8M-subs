00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.660
 hello guys my name is melvin and this 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:09.559
 It's my first video tutorial 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:12.950
 Today I'm going to teach you how to record all 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:15.650
 the desktop screen and record with 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:18.110
 the microphone of the pc or the laptop and 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:21.380
 also with the blue or orange dot 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:24.080
 every time you type with the good button 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:27.439
 and all this all this program 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:29.900
 this program does not need a program 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:34.040
 aside to download windows 8 brings you 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:37.660
 with that option more and it is only necessary 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.660
 activate it then let's start 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:45.050
 we go to a normal folder we 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:50.809
 we direct to team discs and windows 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:52.280
 and we go where it says to drop and then 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:57.620
 we went to use 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:01:00.949
 efe efe fs capture we give you click here 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.900
 this icon effect and capture 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:05.119
 we give anti- click today the address 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:08.710
 both then we expanded the bar 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:10.690
 tasks as you see here mine is already 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:15.450
 anchored 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:18.299
 Well, if I open it 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.969
 and it will automatically make a stop 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:24.929
 then what I have prepared so that 

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:27.659
 let's continue we are images after doing and 

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:30.570
 then I'm in the taskbar 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.960
 we click on it, we open it, it will come out 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.320
 pantallita 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.940
 this state since we are visualizing 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:41.150
 one that has several options to be able 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.880
 record parts you want from your own 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:47.079
 desk 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:50.520
 they will see it and this is this tape 

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:54.549
 they click and they will open something else 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.369
 this then you click on good record 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:59.229
 here we have options to be able to also 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.119
 which part of the desktop they want to record 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:02.810
 they give in full screen is all the 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:06.730
 screen 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:10.300
 and give it grows in record or record 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:12.430
 and then it will come out finally is this 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.610
 option and they start and 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:18.040
 it is already automatically recording 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.270
 When they want to press this, they only 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:24.880
 direct 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:26.540
 to this one they click here and it gets 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.849
 this 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.579
 and this one uses address to another 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:35.000
 little screen where you can record or save 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:36.370
 or delete or delete and that's it 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.810
