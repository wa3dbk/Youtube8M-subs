first to realize the importance of the
find<00:00:42.540> we<00:00:43.320> immediately<00:00:44.390> saw<00:00:45.390> that<00:00:45.420> it<00:00:45.719> was<00:00:45.870> a

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
find we immediately saw that it was a

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.350 
find we immediately saw that it was a
very<00:00:46.559> large<00:00:46.770> toothed<00:00:47.309> whale<00:00:47.579> because<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.120> the

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
looking at it from a closer view we

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.619 
looking at it from a closer view we
realized<00:00:55.260> that<00:00:55.440> it<00:00:55.620> was<00:00:55.800> a<00:00:56.039> giant<00:00:56.610> sperm<00:00:57.390> whale

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629
