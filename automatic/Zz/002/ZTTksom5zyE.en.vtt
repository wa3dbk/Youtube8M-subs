started<00:02:37.780> to<00:02:37.900> rip<00:02:38.110> the<00:02:39.180> lace<00:02:40.180> because<00:02:40.870> it's

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
started to rip the lace because it's

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:45.479 
started to rip the lace because it's
plastic<00:02:41.860> is<00:02:42.220> not<00:02:43.170> actual<00:02:44.170> French<00:02:44.860> or<00:02:45.159> Swiss

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
plastic is not actual French or Swiss

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:48.059 
plastic is not actual French or Swiss
lace<00:02:45.849> so<00:02:46.180> you<00:02:46.269> can't<00:02:46.659> tweeze<00:02:47.019> it<00:02:47.230> you<00:02:47.680> can<00:02:47.890> just

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069 
lace so you can't tweeze it you can just

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:53.430 
lace so you can't tweeze it you can just
either<00:02:48.250> cut<00:02:48.700> here<00:02:49.239> and<00:02:50.310> sew<00:02:51.310> it<00:02:51.459> on<00:02:51.579> and<00:02:52.440> you

00:02:59.399 --> 00:02:59.409 
right and cover it over so you're going

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:02.250

layer it over it which kind of defeats

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:07.380 
layer it over it which kind of defeats
the<00:03:05.349> purpose<00:03:05.440> to<00:03:05.950> me<00:03:06.099> of<00:03:06.280> a<00:03:06.400> closure<00:03:06.670> because<00:03:06.940> I

hair<00:03:11.290> or<00:03:11.889> be<00:03:12.760> you<00:03:13.299> can<00:03:15.810> all<00:03:16.810> wear<00:03:16.870> it<00:03:17.170> like<00:03:17.290> an

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
hair or be you can all wear it like an

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.970 
hair or be you can all wear it like an
invisible<00:03:17.650> part<00:03:18.040> so<00:03:18.340> you<00:03:18.370> would<00:03:18.970> cut<00:03:19.239> here<00:03:19.690> and

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
invisible part so you would cut here and

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.349 
invisible part so you would cut here and
sew<00:03:20.980> it<00:03:21.129> down<00:03:21.310> and<00:03:21.549> have<00:03:21.639> your<00:03:21.700> scalp<00:03:22.090> showing

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:22.359 
sew it down and have your scalp showing

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:25.530 
sew it down and have your scalp showing
but<00:03:23.109> I<00:03:23.139> wouldn't<00:03:23.680> do<00:03:23.799> that<00:03:23.829> that<00:03:24.250> it<00:03:24.489> is<00:03:24.670> really

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
but I wouldn't do that that it is really

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:32.399 
but I wouldn't do that that it is really
um<00:03:25.840> the<00:03:26.230> parting<00:03:26.590> is<00:03:26.739> very<00:03:27.239> small<00:03:28.319> but<00:03:29.319> I<00:03:31.409> don't

00:03:32.399 --> 00:03:32.409 
um the parting is very small but I don't

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:35.629 
um the parting is very small but I don't
think<00:03:32.590> that<00:03:32.829> it<00:03:32.980> is<00:03:33.159> absolutely<00:03:33.909> necessary<00:03:34.209> to

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:35.639 
think that it is absolutely necessary to

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:39.300 
think that it is absolutely necessary to
UM<00:03:36.810> tweeze<00:03:37.810> it<00:03:37.840> to<00:03:38.260> make<00:03:38.379> a<00:03:38.410> wire<00:03:38.739> because

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
UM tweeze it to make a wire because

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:40.680 
UM tweeze it to make a wire because
that's<00:03:39.669> what<00:03:39.790> I<00:03:39.849> try<00:03:40.030> and<00:03:40.090> do<00:03:40.269> is<00:03:40.359> I<00:03:40.449> try<00:03:40.480> and

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
that's what I try and do is I try and

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:45.449 
that's what I try and do is I try and
replicate<00:03:41.069> reality<00:03:42.069> right<00:03:42.639> so<00:03:43.180> in<00:03:43.599> reality<00:03:44.459> if

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
replicate reality right so in reality if

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:47.879 
replicate reality right so in reality if
you<00:03:45.519> have<00:03:45.879> long<00:03:46.180> thick<00:03:46.660> hair<00:03:46.690> your<00:03:47.260> part<00:03:47.650> is

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:47.889 
you have long thick hair your part is

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:51.030 
you have long thick hair your part is
not<00:03:48.099> going<00:03:48.340> to<00:03:48.400> be<00:03:48.549> wide<00:03:48.940> and<00:03:48.970> Spacey<00:03:50.040> in

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
not going to be wide and Spacey in

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.099 
not going to be wide and Spacey in
spares<00:03:51.400> it<00:03:51.699> is<00:03:51.970> going<00:03:52.239> to<00:03:52.510> look<00:03:52.690> something

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:53.109 
spares it is going to look something

00:03:53.109 --> 00:04:01.020 
spares it is going to look something
like<00:03:53.349> this<00:03:53.730> right<00:03:54.790> but<00:03:55.359> usually<00:03:55.660> it<00:03:56.290> will<00:03:56.650> be<00:04:00.030> a

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
like this right but usually it will be a

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.270 
like this right but usually it will be a
little<00:04:01.239> bit<00:04:01.510> more<00:04:01.720> volume<00:04:01.989> right<00:04:02.590> here<00:04:03.099> and

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
little bit more volume right here and

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.099 
little bit more volume right here and
that<00:04:03.849> is<00:04:04.030> the<00:04:04.180> effect<00:04:04.269> that<00:04:04.569> I<00:04:04.660> have<00:04:04.750> to<00:04:04.870> try<00:04:05.079> to

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:05.109 
that is the effect that I have to try to

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:08.460 
that is the effect that I have to try to
get<00:04:05.440> with<00:04:05.620> my<00:04:05.769> knees<00:04:06.010> our<00:04:06.220> way<00:04:07.230> instead<00:04:08.230> of<00:04:08.349> it

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
get with my knees our way instead of it

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.750 
get with my knees our way instead of it
just<00:04:08.500> being<00:04:08.650> flat<00:04:09.160> like<00:04:09.579> that<00:04:09.849> I<00:04:11.069> made<00:04:12.069> sure

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
just being flat like that I made sure

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.030 
just being flat like that I made sure
that<00:04:13.120> there<00:04:13.989> was<00:04:14.109> a<00:04:14.139> little<00:04:14.410> bit<00:04:14.530> of<00:04:14.650> volume

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
that there was a little bit of volume

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.469 
that there was a little bit of volume
around<00:04:15.190> the<00:04:15.489> parting<00:04:15.849> space<00:04:15.940> because<00:04:16.299> if<00:04:16.389> you

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:16.479 
around the parting space because if you

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:20.069 
around the parting space because if you
think<00:04:16.690> about<00:04:16.870> it<00:04:17.199> really<00:04:18.810> realistically<00:04:19.810> when

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:20.079 
think about it really realistically when

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:21.659 
think about it really realistically when
you<00:04:20.169> part<00:04:20.500> your<00:04:20.560> hair<00:04:20.680> and<00:04:21.220> your<00:04:21.340> hair<00:04:21.370> is

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:21.669 
you part your hair and your hair is

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:23.790 
you part your hair and your hair is
curly<00:04:22.030> it's<00:04:22.419> not<00:04:22.599> going<00:04:22.780> to<00:04:22.840> just<00:04:22.870> always<00:04:23.650> be

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
curly it's not going to just always be

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.149 
curly it's not going to just always be
flat<00:04:24.159> right<00:04:25.229> so<00:04:26.229> I<00:04:26.260> hope<00:04:26.530> you<00:04:26.620> guys<00:04:26.740> understand

00:04:27.149 --> 00:04:27.159 
flat right so I hope you guys understand

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:30.089 
flat right so I hope you guys understand
