 from 1667 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.640
 it's not true it's a lot of things 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.140
 for the others 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.140

 how do you hear 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.130
 stopping 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.130
 meet something in our history

 copyright 2010 stupid 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.780
 the operator who allows to better define the research and the life of the players 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.760
 compulsive the plateau it allows to expand the search for complicity 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.290
