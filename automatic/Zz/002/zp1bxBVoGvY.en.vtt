which you can see behind me here so this
is<00:02:18.070> our<00:02:18.160> diffractive<00:02:18.760> optics<00:02:19.120> technology

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
is our diffractive optics technology

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.210 
is our diffractive optics technology
which<00:02:19.930> means<00:02:20.200> that<00:02:20.410> you<00:02:20.470> can<00:02:20.620> create<00:02:20.800> lenses

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
which means that you can create lenses

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.660 
which means that you can create lenses
