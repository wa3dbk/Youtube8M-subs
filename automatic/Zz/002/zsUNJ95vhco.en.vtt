00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
there are two 6-pin connectors okay

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.050 
there are two 6-pin connectors okay
let's<00:04:08.230> take<00:04:08.379> the<00:04:08.560> thumb<00:04:08.739> off<00:04:08.950> and<00:04:09.220> with<00:04:10.030> a

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
let's take the thumb off and with a

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.250 
let's take the thumb off and with a
cooler<00:04:10.299> off<00:04:10.540> and<00:04:10.750> see<00:04:10.959> what<00:04:11.049> we<00:04:11.110> have

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
cooler off and see what we have

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.050 
cooler off and see what we have
underneath<00:04:11.620> all<00:04:12.099> right<00:04:12.310> so<00:04:12.640> now<00:04:12.760> we're<00:04:12.910> back

YouTube cooler itself we can see that
there<00:04:52.750> are<00:04:52.780> five<00:04:53.400> very<00:04:54.400> large<00:04:54.729> heat<00:04:55.030> pipes<00:04:55.270> in

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:55.479 
there are five very large heat pipes in

00:04:55.479 --> 00:05:00.659 
there are five very large heat pipes in
it<00:04:55.830> two<00:04:56.830> very<00:04:57.100> large<00:04:57.280> fin<00:04:57.699> arrays<00:04:59.550> which<00:05:00.550> is

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:00.669 
it two very large fin arrays which is

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:03.330 
it two very large fin arrays which is
gonna<00:05:00.789> keep<00:05:01.450> this<00:05:01.599> monstrous<00:05:02.110> card<00:05:02.440> pretty

gonna keep this monstrous card pretty
darn<00:05:03.610> cool<00:05:04.800> there<00:05:05.800> are<00:05:05.830> the<00:05:06.160> 200<00:05:06.610> mil<00:05:06.760> fans

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:09.450 

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:12.360 

right<00:05:10.479> I<00:05:10.599> know<00:05:10.810> generally<00:05:11.289> with<00:05:11.590> a<00:05:11.620> graphics

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370 
right I know generally with a graphics

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:15.420 
right I know generally with a graphics
card<00:05:12.430> or<00:05:12.880> even<00:05:12.940> a<00:05:13.810> regular<00:05:14.500> block<00:05:14.950> if<00:05:15.160> it's<00:05:15.280> not

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.430 
card or even a regular block if it's not

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:18.870 
card or even a regular block if it's not
the<00:05:15.580> direct<00:05:15.910> contact<00:05:16.620> there<00:05:17.620> will<00:05:17.740> be<00:05:17.770> a<00:05:17.919> plate

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:18.880 
the direct contact there will be a plate

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.060 
the direct contact there will be a plate
on<00:05:19.120> top<00:05:19.360> of<00:05:19.539> here<00:05:19.660> an<00:05:19.750> extra<00:05:20.020> plate<00:05:20.289> so<00:05:20.860> what

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:21.070 
on top of here an extra plate so what

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:22.710 
on top of here an extra plate so what
easiest<00:05:21.580> is<00:05:21.669> done<00:05:21.849> here<00:05:22.060> is<00:05:22.120> they<00:05:22.240> remove<00:05:22.570> the

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.720 
easiest is done here is they remove the

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.469 
easiest is done here is they remove the
plate<00:05:23.130> made<00:05:24.130> it<00:05:24.250> directly<00:05:24.550> contact<00:05:25.150> with<00:05:25.360> the

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:25.479 
plate made it directly contact with the

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:28.500 
plate made it directly contact with the
heat<00:05:25.660> pipes<00:05:25.930> which<00:05:26.440> cool<00:05:27.190> is<00:05:27.310> better<00:05:27.520> so

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:28.510 
heat pipes which cool is better so

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:30.589 
heat pipes which cool is better so
that's<00:05:28.690> why<00:05:28.840> we<00:05:28.960> get<00:05:29.080> such<00:05:29.260> good<00:05:29.440> cooling<00:05:29.830> on

00:05:30.589 --> 00:05:30.599 
that's why we get such good cooling on

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:34.550 
that's why we get such good cooling on
generally<00:05:31.599> anything<00:05:31.870> that's<00:05:32.169> direct<00:05:32.919> contact

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 
generally anything that's direct contact

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:42.129 
generally anything that's direct contact
no<00:05:35.729> take<00:05:36.729> a<00:05:36.760> look<00:05:36.849> at<00:05:37.060> the<00:05:37.180> PCB<00:05:38.220> of<00:05:39.450> the<00:05:40.450> card

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:42.139 
no take a look at the PCB of the card

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:46.969 
no take a look at the PCB of the card
I'll<00:05:43.139> just<00:05:43.409> get<00:05:43.979> in<00:05:44.129> tighter<00:05:44.490> here<00:05:45.259> okay<00:05:46.259> you

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:46.979 
I'll just get in tighter here okay you

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:51.439 
I'll just get in tighter here okay you
can<00:05:47.129> see<00:05:47.250> it's<00:05:47.400> a<00:05:47.460> very<00:05:47.669> clean<00:05:47.909> layout<00:05:50.449> very

00:05:51.439 --> 00:05:51.449 
can see it's a very clean layout very

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:53.749 
can see it's a very clean layout very
nice<00:05:51.659> Aziz<00:05:52.110> has<00:05:52.229> done<00:05:52.439> a<00:05:52.469> great<00:05:52.919> job<00:05:53.069> all<00:05:53.580> the

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:03.840 
covered out by the cooler but you can

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:05.929 
covered out by the cooler but you can
see<00:06:03.960> the<00:06:04.080> chokes<00:06:04.349> and<00:06:04.590> the<00:06:04.650> capacitors<00:06:05.250> from

00:06:05.929 --> 00:06:05.939 
see the chokes and the capacitors from

00:06:05.939 --> 00:06:12.740 
see the chokes and the capacitors from
the<00:06:06.060> memory<00:06:06.680> and<00:06:07.680> then<00:06:08.039> the<00:06:08.219> GF<00:06:08.639> 110<00:06:11.750> chip

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:16.070 
the memory and then the GF 110 chip
itself<00:06:13.110> I<00:06:14.629> don't<00:06:15.629> know<00:06:15.689> if<00:06:15.779> you<00:06:15.840> could<00:06:15.900> see

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:16.080 
itself I don't know if you could see

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:20.089 
itself I don't know if you could see
that<00:06:16.199> look<00:06:16.439> that's<00:06:17.129> what<00:06:17.370> it<00:06:17.460> says<00:06:19.099> anyways
