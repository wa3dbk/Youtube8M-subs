00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
me actually disenchant and see how much

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.850 
me actually disenchant and see how much
dusted<00:04:26.520> will<00:04:26.669> give<00:04:26.880> me<00:04:27.120> the<00:04:28.110> extra<00:04:28.440> cards<00:04:28.740> will

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
give me 240 and it's a big chance of

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:35.719 
give me 240 and it's a big chance of
we'll<00:04:30.930> also<00:04:31.169> this<00:04:31.680> disenchant<00:04:32.520> the<00:04:33.260> the<00:04:34.729> what

00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:35.729 
we'll also this disenchant the the what

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:39.560 
we'll also this disenchant the the what
is<00:04:35.820> he<00:04:35.910> called<00:04:36.650> gruel<00:04:37.650> and<00:04:38.000> most<00:04:39.000> likely<00:04:39.449> as

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.570 
is he called gruel and most likely as

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.750 
is he called gruel and most likely as
well<00:04:39.750> actually<00:04:40.130> actually<00:04:41.130> they<00:04:41.490> don't<00:04:41.639> have

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760 
well actually actually they don't have

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.340 
well actually actually they don't have
the<00:04:41.940> second<00:04:42.300> one<00:04:42.449> right<00:04:42.630> there<00:04:42.900> which<00:04:43.199> I

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350 
the second one right there which I

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:46.820 
the second one right there which I
suppose<00:04:43.949> is<00:04:44.010> is<00:04:44.340> okay<00:04:44.930> did<00:04:45.930> run<00:04:46.199> really<00:04:46.560> neatly

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
suppose is is okay did run really neatly

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.370 
suppose is is okay did run really neatly
monocle<00:04:47.340> 12<00:04:47.550> tech<00:04:47.729> guy<00:04:47.970> but<00:04:48.900> there's<00:04:49.229> a<00:04:49.260> big

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 
monocle 12 tech guy but there's a big

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.080 
monocle 12 tech guy but there's a big
chance<00:04:49.560> I'm<00:04:49.740> gonna<00:04:49.860> disenchant<00:04:50.430> this<00:04:50.610> guy<00:04:50.820> I

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090 
chance I'm gonna disenchant this guy I

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:52.940 
chance I'm gonna disenchant this guy I
mean<00:04:51.630> it<00:04:51.750> might<00:04:51.870> even<00:04:51.990> dis<00:04:52.260> a<00:04:52.290> shunt<00:04:52.560> both<00:04:52.740> of

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:52.950 
mean it might even dis a shunt both of

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:54.680 
mean it might even dis a shunt both of
them<00:04:53.130> i<00:04:53.220> I've<00:04:53.700> never<00:04:53.729> played<00:04:54.060> a<00:04:54.120> pirate<00:04:54.540> deck

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690 
them i I've never played a pirate deck

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:56.060 
them i I've never played a pirate deck
before<00:04:55.050> and<00:04:55.139> I<00:04:55.169> don't<00:04:55.229> think<00:04:55.440> Peyer<00:04:55.620> decks<00:04:55.950> are

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070
