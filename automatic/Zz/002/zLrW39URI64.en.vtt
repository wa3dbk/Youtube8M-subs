00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
doing and playing this game I'm going to

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.350

like<00:01:42.770> the<00:01:42.920> Yankees<00:01:43.100> very<00:01:43.520> much<00:01:43.759> so<00:01:44.060> I'd<00:01:44.150> rather

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
like the Yankees very much so I'd rather

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.240 
like the Yankees very much so I'd rather
do<00:01:44.720> that<00:01:44.750> than<00:01:44.930> a<00:01:45.290> lot<00:01:45.500> of<00:01:45.530> other<00:01:45.680> stuff<00:01:45.950> but

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.090 
and slice them in half I personally

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:12.610 
and slice them in half I personally
thought<00:05:11.390> the<00:05:11.539> graphics<00:05:11.690> were<00:05:12.020> kind<00:05:12.560> of

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:12.620 
thought the graphics were kind of

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.360 
thought the graphics were kind of
lacking<00:05:13.130> but<00:05:14.080> it's<00:05:15.080> a<00:05:15.140> PlayStation<00:05:15.800> now<00:05:15.950> so

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:16.370 
lacking but it's a PlayStation now so

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:18.159 
lacking but it's a PlayStation now so
I'm<00:05:16.520> hoping<00:05:16.880> Syphon<00:05:17.300> Filter<00:05:17.330> 3<00:05:17.870> will<00:05:18.050> be<00:05:18.140> a

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:18.169 
I'm hoping Syphon Filter 3 will be a

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:20.469 
I'm hoping Syphon Filter 3 will be a
PlayStation<00:05:18.830> 2<00:05:18.950> game<00:05:19.340> no<00:05:19.789> doubt<00:05:20.000> I'm<00:05:20.210> hoping

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:20.479 
PlayStation 2 game no doubt I'm hoping

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:21.670 
PlayStation 2 game no doubt I'm hoping
that<00:05:20.630> that's<00:05:20.840> going<00:05:20.990> to<00:05:21.050> be<00:05:21.200> a<00:05:21.229> little<00:05:21.440> bit

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680 
that that's going to be a little bit

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:22.090 
that that's going to be a little bit
more

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:22.100 
more

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.460 
more
or<00:05:22.190> I<00:05:22.460> guess<00:05:23.210> a<00:05:23.240> little<00:05:23.390> bit<00:05:23.510> more<00:05:23.750> advanced<00:05:24.230> a

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:24.470 
or I guess a little bit more advanced a

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:26.860 
or I guess a little bit more advanced a
little<00:05:25.160> more<00:05:25.370> dynamic<00:05:25.970> you<00:05:26.120> can't<00:05:26.450> go<00:05:26.690> in

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:26.870 
little more dynamic you can't go in

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:28.960 
little more dynamic you can't go in
you're<00:05:27.260> gonna<00:05:27.380> make<00:05:27.530> a<00:05:27.590> Syphon<00:05:28.040> Filter<00:05:28.070> 3<00:05:28.670> just

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:28.970 
you're gonna make a Syphon Filter 3 just

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:31.060 
you're gonna make a Syphon Filter 3 just
make<00:05:29.690> more<00:05:29.930> improvements<00:05:30.020> than<00:05:30.650> just<00:05:30.950> the

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:31.070
