00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.830
 good afternoon dear subscribers as well 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.540
 accidentally looking at the channel collecting 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.550
 material for the review of new tanks which 

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:20.439
 developers promise to introduce in the update 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.150
 0 9 10 ran into interesting 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:24.670
 innovation is it that 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.650
 if you leave the battlefield before 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.970
 your tank was killed to enter the hangar and 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.220
 take another tank to 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.379
 go to the next battle but at the same time 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.720
 battle has not yet been completed by the results of this 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:36.280
 Battlefield will appear on your screen with 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.830
 very interesting inscription 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.420
 but rather a warning applied to you 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.940
 disciplinary action 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.949
 dear player due to a violation by you 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.199
 game rules on the map on which 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:49.780
 won at such a time namely 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:52.239
 articles exit the battlefield before it ends or 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.670
 destruction of your own car to you 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:56.290
 disciplinary action applied 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.900
 The penalty specified below is extreme 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:01.839
 punishment deprivation one hundred percent 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:04.720
 earned slaughter credit experience and 

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:06.549
 awards that is you played wasted and how 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.560
 you first thought it was a bug and 

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:10.780
 system fine slightly undermines 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.790
 Of course, the developers said before 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.890
 already what should soon introduce 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.990
 similar system but only to combat 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.210
 those players who leave the battlefield 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.100
 when their tank is still alive and has glasses 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.290
 strength in principle go it right 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.480
 for such a situation but why deprive 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.210
 credits and experience on the basis of the results 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:30.070
 battle tanks which were destroyed by battle and 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.320
 of course they did not inspect the fight 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.330
 which will not end soon and just 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.430
 went to the hangar to continue the fight already 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.380
 on another tank why these players 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.040
 wargaming systems denotes how 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.140
 violators 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.780
 what kind of nonsense I played a single fight on 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.340
 test 09 10 and of course as a lot 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.440
 players do not always live to the end 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.300
 fight and squeezed the button go out to the hangar after 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.250
 of how my tank was destroyed and it 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.750
 ok but why should i have to 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.909
 ban and deprive earned 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.040
 I do not understand you just imagine what 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:59.980
 will lead the introduction of this banana main 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.150
 server in update 0 9 10 for example what 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.310
 will be with light tanks 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.380
 driving in other lit-shki illuminate 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.860
 adversary and then you allow some 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.360
 a mistake 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.459
 leaving these roughly chamber 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.620
 the enemy and you dismantle all the tank 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:14.560
 destroyed that player a lt-shki should 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.510
 do sit and just watch the fight bye 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.459
 it is not complete why should I sit and 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.889
 watch i want to take another tank and 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:21.940
 go to another fight but with such a ban 

00:02:20.889 --> 00:02:23.350
 nothing to fight for 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.840
 so it turns out that you have to 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:28.210
 inspect the fight to the end and so will with 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.680
 every player and every fight in everything in 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:31.960
 this is of course the only plus 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.670
 which I saw the players will be very 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.770
 value the health of their tank and will 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.600
 try to play very, very carefully 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.820
 but this is the only plus 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.440
 For most players, this will not work but 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.300
 imagine what will happen next players 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.760
 who have already been destroyed are sitting and watching 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.920
 fight they have nothing to do they have already played and 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.360
 what they will do yes everything is simple 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.580
 will flood the chat 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.380
 poke around the minimap swear 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.660
 and the team will mostly suffer 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.910
 allies for surviving tanks game in 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.070
 the last moments of the battle turned into hell and 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:02.230
 the screen will resemble the matrix because 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.210
 Korea 5 green and white lettering players 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.610
 in the left half of the screen will be just 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:08.770
 flow a river wanting to write something and 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:11.350
 bored players who already do 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:13.240
 there is nothing much for what it introduces 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.250
 really do not understand is likely to have 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.260
 generally disable chat settings visible 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.480
 really the developers themselves are practically not 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.250
 they play a game that they improve for us 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.140
 quotes and what will happen to the person who 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.420
 came home from work and decided in the evening 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:28.209
 an hour you roll your tanks he for this 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.580
 an hour will have time to play only 4 maximum 5 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:33.070
 fights no more but before patch 09 action he 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:35.350
 had time to roll 911 battles, respectively 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:37.840
 and earn this hour more experience and 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.910
 credits on my account can say 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.860
 Only one if this ban is still 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.820
 lead to the main server with the update 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.950
 09 10 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:47.380
 then a lot of players leave this game and 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.180
 It is a fact apart from a lot of tanks and other games. 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.280
 which do not need to constantly donat 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.019
 money and which are much better 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.730
 game engine graphics and in addition 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:56.769
 already uses multi-core processor 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.019
 before the release of the update is completely left 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:00.910
 a little about two or three weeks wait 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:02.769
 of course and see hopefully of course that 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.810
 the developers just messed up something and 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:06.459
 fix this bug but on this i have 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.170
 all I tell you is goodbye 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:10.060
 write in the comments what you think about 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:12.190
 given bath and if you are not indifferent to 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.360
 tanks put your finger up and if you 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.190
 there is a desire to see new videos 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:19.080
 subscribe to my channel to new 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:19.080
 meetings and good luck on the battlefield
