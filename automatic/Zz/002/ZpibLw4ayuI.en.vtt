00:00:04.649 --> 00:00:10.480
 endurance sports this is healthy training 

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:12.730
 in the field of endurance sports strengthens their 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.539
 Condition and leaves fat pad fast 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:15.879
 disappear 

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:18.100
 but which sport is for me 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:19.330
 most meaningful and what does it apply to 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.700
 to attend training 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:24.039
 professor ingo frobÃ¶se is at the 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:26.850
 sports college cologne head of the center 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:29.110
 for health and professionals in things 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:30.850
 endurance sports endurance sports is what 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:32.500
 Anyone should do it to strengthen it 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:33.670
 the cardiovascular system strengthens so 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.190
 the engine we have 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.659
 promotes the metabolism system and 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.699
 strengthens the immune system so ours 

00:00:37.659 --> 00:00:41.859
 Defense is therefore an allround training 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:44.679
 for all our organs from different 

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:46.629
 are very popular running the run 

00:00:44.679 --> 00:00:48.760
 has many advantages in particular 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:51.460
 fast you get a pretty fast in a short time 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.019
 big effect it's a tiring one 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.510
 sporting activity compared to 

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:57.280
 others presuppose that I already 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.049
 something good sport a sporty one 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.299
 can bring activity but otherwise 

00:00:59.049 --> 00:01:03.069
 It is the effective way to get fat 

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:05.530
 burn and therefore also a 

00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:07.659
 to experience the pleasure of jogging is not 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.370
 jogging well by itself is just that 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:10.570
 waive the beginner should namely 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.100
 only begin with the words 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.630
 or if I am so overweight 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.370
 For example, or have joint problems 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.200
 then I better go to the wheel or 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:19.210
 in the swimming pool and prepare my joints 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.800
 Before the start of the training is always that 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.660
 difficult 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.880
 the most important thing is that you feel that 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.950
 has after running more subjective after the 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.540
 to be subjective unchallenged exchange 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.390
 which one should not do in any case 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.940
 is to expand is most important 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.480
 after the sport saying wow i could 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.920
 even more 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.690
 then you did it right and before 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.730
 all hire you on bock and pleasurable 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.710
 Again, it's three days to installer again 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:44.080
 It should be the same 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.880
 Cycling Cycling has many 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.740
 Firstly, I can benefit from the advantages 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.900
 Family together make the second 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.880
 after all, 60 to 70 percent of the 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.040
 Body weight on the saddle and there 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.050
 These are my joints relieving mine 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.430
 Muscles also not so stressed and 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:58.930
 Above all I can make it a front door 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.520
 start and that 's the big advantage 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:04.020
 compared to many other sports 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:06.220
 but endurance sports alone is not enough 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.880
 Muscular training and endurance training are 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.039
 the Twins 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.810
 you need both and especially if 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.819
 I would like to adorn food fat if 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.170
 I would therefore like to lose weight does not go the 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.500
 without musculature that's why the 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.530
 training is a must 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.120
 swimming is my swimming 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.280
 Considered a great sport, however 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.080
 a totally overvalued sport has the 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.180
 Most are bathing rather than they are 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.280
 swimming properly and when I enter 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.810
 endurance effect would like then enough 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.310
 do not bathe because then would have to 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.600
 I go swimming right and that 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.940
 means that I'm right ne 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.290
 must pull and preferably long 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.410
 it then in which I also different 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.550
 techniques swim run 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:44.060
 swimming has the influence of 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:46.760
 Lifting gravity and gravity 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.260
 on not only has positive effect 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.110
 but for example I would 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.580
 never people eg with an osteoporosis ins 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.230
 Water is stuck because of gravity 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.580
 then influence the bone structures 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.489
 So all of them, for example, are dropped 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.750
 that we want to do the bone building 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:02.380
 I would say definitely no 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.380
 not into the water 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.540
 add the panacea 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.099
 back problems mold back problems 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.290
 are almost always in a small 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:12.659
 synonymous almost treated synonymous and there is 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.250
 No causality at all, that's me 

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:16.290
 if I have back pain better 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.430
 swimming should have this causality there 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.469
 it really does not work at all 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:22.170
 back-swimming and backache 

00:03:19.469 --> 00:03:23.909
 have no condition to each other no matter 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.739
 What do you do when back pain no matter 

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:27.180
 The main thing is that they move in the water 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:30.569
 or on land no matter 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.159
 the inline skating inlineskater has many 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:34.139
 Benefits in particular is a trendy one 

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:35.790
 sport and for that reason also very many 

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:37.049
 young people to endurance sports too 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:40.349
 drive what else he always such a 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:42.389
 bit of a sport was a 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:44.310
 sliding motion technology where I high 

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:46.200
 Speeds reach where I am 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.900
 also in the competition can measure without that 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.639
 my I get big problems 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.709
 For example, steering has one 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:54.419
 low stress on the joints structure 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:56.669
 Of course, it is very much down 

00:03:54.419 --> 00:03:58.500
 more dangerous if inline skating 

00:03:56.669 --> 00:04:01.590
 in endurance training always with protection 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.060
 usually stay the next morning 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.989
 clearly noticeable 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:08.449
 the muscular hangover is no muscle cat 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:11.280
 illness of the way is not bad 

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:13.169
 I should not be so intense then 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.970
 continue to do sports but I can too 

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:17.750
 continue to play sports in something 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:21.989
 attenuated form good helps heat 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:23.970
 relaxing bath some warming ointments 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:26.340
 for example and two to three days 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.849
 reduced load that is good at 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.039
 trend 

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:31.830
 nordic walking nordic walking is yes 

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:33.840
 a very trendy sport has the 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.849
 Advantages are that I am forced 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.919
 I'll also be active with my upper body 

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:39.870
 that I include in the 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:41.220
 make work a bit more intense now 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.690
 make that most people just 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:45.000
 Unfortunately they are not really wearing 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:46.500
 So it did the right thing 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.570
 advantage that the upper body exercises 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:51.300
 you get it right when you do it 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:54.120
 like in cross-country skiing with one 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:56.070
 diagonal floor use of the whole too 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.630
 is repelled properly and mine 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:59.430
 strong arms only then it is strong 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:01.110
 really big steps more violent 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:03.200
 I have the right one 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:05.870
 Keeping forward your ski long 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:09.830
 for beginners and professionals, it makes sense 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:11.540
 Pulse watches are almost something 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:14.300
 Technological that the man among women 

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:15.950
 you can hardly see so much pulse and 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.600
 serve me so much 

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:19.580
 have security in which 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:21.350
 Training load, I am one 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.390
 follow your breathing and 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:24.910
 Body feeling they should be during 

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:27.530
 neither under nor training 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:29.570
 feeling overwhelmed is a heart rate monitor 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:30.320
 helpful this body feeling too 

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:32.240
 learn 

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:34.070
 as an alternative also offers the 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.260
 species burn because this is much easier 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:37.400
 four steps once 1 4 steps once 

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:40.340
 then you are always in the right place 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.660
 the ideal pulse is that way 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.500
 You used to say always run earlier 

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:44.240
 without a puff 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:46.130
 That's the right thing I need 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.540
 So a training pulse of 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:49.520
 according to what I want to do 

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:50.780
 I would like to lose weight 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.420
 I would like to improve performance again 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:54.350
 on it is always different 

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:56.270
 accordingly, you have the individual 

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:57.980
 find that can not be calculated 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:59.330
 But it can be connected to many parameters 

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:01.280
 recognize, among other things , the 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:02.990
 Heart rate endurance sports should be one 

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:05.510
 To live a lifetime is the most important thing 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:08.620
 That is just when you enjoy it 

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:10.760
 It takes about 45 to 60 minutes, ideally 

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:12.170
 distributed several times a week 

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:13.640
 endurance sport should operate 

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:15.560
 decision for an endurance sport 

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:17.390
 Everyone falls by his own 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.250
 inclinations want interests and 

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:21.110
 in particular, what have options 

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:23.090
 So I have to go far away 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:25.760
 go jogging then you do it 

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:27.080
 I do not live in the city you drive 

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:27.860
 also public properly bicycle because it 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.780
 too dangerous 

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:30.800
 so it has to mean to me 

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:32.420
 individual frame conditions 

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:34.810
 What you do then it does not matter the main thing 

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:34.810
 one does
