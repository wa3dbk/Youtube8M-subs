00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.269
 one 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.170
 Hello, how are you doing? 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.090
 I am very happy to say hello 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.639
 accompany the architect to his dinner and 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.349
 also to the whole audience in this 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.690
 Tuesday night we will see how we 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.910
 they paint the conditions for what remains 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.010
 of the day for now or nothing 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.560
 relevant or encouraging the panorama that 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.590
 we had during the afternoon of today 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.650
 a hazy warm environment and this 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.630
 heat we will not leave him comment 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.070
 that will continue to be the protagonist 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.039
 in the following days in fact the 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.300
 temperatures tend to increase 

00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:38.519
 currently at the temperature in the 28 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.230
 degrees a warm night south of the 

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:42.390
 city ​​and also in conditions of 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.010
 scarce cloudiness dominate in Monterrey and 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.719
 its metropolitan area 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.059
 ideal to believe the satellite image 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.489
 speaks for itself continues to look 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.559
 quite calm the high pressures 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.420
 still do not fold your hands leaving 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.030
 Very calm conditions and very 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.100
 stable only some showers of 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.139
 very isolated form accompanied by 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.899
 electrical activity towards the table 

00:01:01.139 --> 00:01:05.519
 unfortunately, we will not have 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.770
 pleasant conditions either 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.000
 displacements of precipitation is more 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.190
 that obvious the image 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.140
 of rain the high pressures are going to 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.930
 keep giving away scarce conditions 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.790
 cloudiness and the west wind is going to 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.310
 blow and that will allow the 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.320
 temperatures increase in the course 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.990
 of the following days for now the 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.550
 tomorrow I do not promise changes 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.369
 the high temperatures will follow 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:32.190
 causing a tremendous headache the 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.990
 numbers say it all very early the 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.850
 value is going to be 20 degrees but by the 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.850
 late the thermometer rises to a 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.350
 temperature from 37 to 38 is going to be 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.180
 preparing to withstand the intense 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.970
 heat, poor cloudiness 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.070
 they will continue to be present cleared by the 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.320
 night and we will be ending the day with 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.110
 a temperature of 30 degrees one half 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.940
 pretty hot the wind 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.890
 West will continue to dominate during 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.410
 on Thursday and that's going to allow 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.479
 and indeed you can see it is not 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:04.530
 wrong on Thursday the temperature is 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:06.570
 39 almost 40 degrees Celsius there's 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.850
 that hydrate very well we will have the 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.610
 sun at all its intensity temperatures 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.730
 minimum of 22 and he 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.320
 the wind changes direction the wind 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.630
 North by the age of a system 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.760
 weak frontal will bring down the 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.710
 temperature but we keep talking about 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.960
 warm values ​​not as high as 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:27.020
 that are approaching but if temperatures in 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:29.210
 the range of 30 to 31 this is valid 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.550
 for Saturday minimum temperature of 21 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:34.340
 maximum of 31 on Saturday conditions 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:37.040
 cloudy sky changing to medium 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.590
 Cloudy on Sunday and next week 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:43.400
 again increase the minimum values ​​of 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:46.340
 21 and maximums from 34 to 35 we will have 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:49.340
 consecutive days of intense heat or 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.900
 high temperatures I come back a little bit 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.420
 later I still do not say goodbye 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:56.840
 I'll be with more weather information 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.250
 at 8 o'clock and also at 8 o'clock 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.770
 for now we are going to go a cut 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:04.870
 commercial but we'll be back with 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.870
 more information good night
