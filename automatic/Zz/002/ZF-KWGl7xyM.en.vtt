this<00:00:54.750> paddle<00:00:55.260> I've<00:00:55.440> done<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:55.920> good<00:00:56.040> better

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:56.220 
this paddle I've done a good better

pedal<00:00:58.199> and<00:00:58.320> have<00:00:58.440> isolated<00:00:58.830> a<00:00:59.129> few

00:00:59.509 --> 00:00:59.519 
pedal and have isolated a few

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:01.939 
pedal and have isolated a few
modifications<00:01:00.030> I<00:01:00.600> think<00:01:00.960> will<00:01:01.260> improve<00:01:01.680> the

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
modifications I think will improve the

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.829 
modifications I think will improve the
seven<00:01:02.250> quality<00:01:02.579> of<00:01:02.730> this<00:01:02.879> pedal<00:01:03.089> make<00:01:03.510> it<00:01:03.629> more

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:03.839 
seven quality of this pedal make it more

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:06.080 
seven quality of this pedal make it more
a<00:01:04.019> valve<00:01:04.500> like<00:01:04.830> response<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:05.610> a<00:01:05.850> better

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
a valve like response and a better

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.149 
a valve like response and a better
distortion<00:01:06.720> all<00:01:06.900> around<00:01:07.170> so<00:01:07.890> let's<00:01:08.040> get

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
distortion all around so let's get

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.710 
distortion all around so let's get
inside<00:01:08.430> this<00:01:08.640> pedal<00:01:09.030> and<00:01:09.150> see<00:01:09.390> just<00:01:09.630> what

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
inside this pedal and see just what

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.020

we're<00:01:09.990> going<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:10.140> do<00:01:10.290> with<00:01:10.440> it<00:01:10.790> you'll<00:01:11.790> be<00:01:11.940> able

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
we're going to do with it you'll be able

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.880 
we're going to do with it you'll be able

the bass frequencies on this should

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.900 
the bass frequencies on this should
there<00:01:40.050> get<00:01:40.410> a<00:01:40.440> really<00:01:40.890> good<00:01:41.070> sound<00:01:41.250> kind<00:01:41.820> of

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:41.910 
there get a really good sound kind of

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.240 
there get a really good sound kind of
like<00:01:42.060> a<00:01:42.090> crank<00:01:42.420> valve<00:01:42.810> amp<00:01:43.050> now<00:01:43.950> there's<00:01:44.100> a<00:01:44.130> lot

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
like a crank valve amp now there's a lot

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.710 
like a crank valve amp now there's a lot
going<00:01:44.460> on<00:01:44.550> with<00:01:44.610> these<00:01:44.880> modifications<00:01:45.270> so

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
going on with these modifications so

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:46.700 
going on with these modifications so
I'll<00:01:45.780> just<00:01:45.870> highlight<00:01:46.080> a<00:01:46.200> few<00:01:46.260> things<00:01:46.590> that

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
I'll just highlight a few things that

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.190 
I'll just highlight a few things that
might<00:01:46.830> be<00:01:46.890> of<00:01:47.040> interest<00:01:47.280> to<00:01:47.730> you<00:01:48.060> resistor<00:01:48.780> 7

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
might be of interest to you resistor 7

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.830 
might be of interest to you resistor 7
defines<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:50.250> voltage<00:01:50.760> bias<00:01:51.000> and<00:01:51.510> in<00:01:51.630> turn

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
defines the voltage bias and in turn

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.050 
defines the voltage bias and in turn
controls<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.560> gain<00:01:52.800> and<00:01:53.310> higher<00:01:53.490> value<00:01:53.820> let's

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
controls the gain and higher value let's

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.340 
controls the gain and higher value let's
increase<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.450> gain<00:01:54.600> lower<00:01:54.810> values<00:01:55.140> decrease

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
increase the gain lower values decrease

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.940 
increase the gain lower values decrease
again<00:01:55.560> but<00:01:55.950> also<00:01:56.220> focus<00:01:57.210> on<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.659> low<00:01:57.900> end

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
again but also focus on the low end

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.140 
again but also focus on the low end
integration<00:01:58.950> focusing<00:01:59.400> that<00:01:59.520> low<00:01:59.760> end<00:01:59.940> and

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.150 
integration focusing that low end and

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:01.580 
integration focusing that low end and
I've<00:02:00.630> got<00:02:00.750> other<00:02:00.900> things<00:02:01.170> that<00:02:01.350> will<00:02:01.470> increase

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
I've got other things that will increase

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.800 
I've got other things that will increase
the<00:02:02.190> gain<00:02:02.580> on<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:03.000> pedal<00:02:03.330> so<00:02:03.450> I'm<00:02:03.600> going<00:02:03.750> to

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
the gain on the pedal so I'm going to

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.190 
the gain on the pedal so I'm going to
drop<00:02:04.110> that<00:02:04.710> value<00:02:05.100> from<00:02:05.250> 470<00:02:06.000> down<00:02:06.360> to<00:02:06.510> 330<00:02:07.110> and

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
drop that value from 470 down to 330 and

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.169 
drop that value from 470 down to 330 and
hopefully<00:02:07.440> taking<00:02:07.650> up<00:02:07.830> that<00:02:08.009> low<00:02:08.190> end<00:02:08.220> result

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
hopefully taking up that low end result

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.360 
hopefully taking up that low end result

distortion down to the base end a little

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.820 
distortion down to the base end a little
bit<00:02:16.950> not<00:02:17.310> too<00:02:17.340> far<00:02:17.940> like<00:02:18.150> it's<00:02:18.299> too<00:02:18.450> fuzzy<00:02:18.830> but

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
bit not too far like it's too fuzzy but

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.140 
bit not too far like it's too fuzzy but
I<00:02:19.860> want<00:02:20.069> to<00:02:20.220> go<00:02:20.340> a<00:02:20.400> little<00:02:20.459> bit<00:02:20.700> further<00:02:20.849> down

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
I want to go a little bit further down

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.630 
I want to go a little bit further down
and<00:02:21.180> make<00:02:21.450> it<00:02:21.480> a<00:02:21.690> bigger<00:02:21.959> sound<00:02:22.950> I'm<00:02:23.459> going<00:02:23.580> to

and make it a bigger sound I'm going to

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.000

leave capacitor eat alone and but I'm

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:01.240 
equally well as a sort of clean boost

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.990 
equally well as a sort of clean boost
light<00:06:01.479> overdrive<00:06:01.960> machine<00:06:02.319> and<00:06:02.849> very<00:06:03.849> good

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:04.000 
light overdrive machine and very good

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.179 
light overdrive machine and very good
for<00:06:04.240> the<00:06:04.389> high<00:06:04.629> gain<00:06:04.689> as<00:06:05.110> well<00:06:05.259> albeit<00:06:05.530> fairly

00:06:06.179 --> 00:06:06.189 
for the high gain as well albeit fairly

00:06:06.189 --> 00:06:09.119 
for the high gain as well albeit fairly
fuzzier<00:06:06.550> when<00:06:06.759> you<00:06:06.879> push<00:06:07.180> it<00:06:07.419> hard<00:06:07.900> it's<00:06:08.620> got<00:06:08.919> a

00:06:09.119 --> 00:06:09.129 
fuzzier when you push it hard it's got a

00:06:09.129 --> 00:06:12.119 
fuzzier when you push it hard it's got a
lot<00:06:09.490> of<00:06:09.520> them<00:06:09.909> crunch<00:06:10.659> and<00:06:10.870> low<00:06:11.379> response

00:06:12.119 --> 00:06:12.129 
lot of them crunch and low response

00:06:12.129 --> 00:06:14.610 
lot of them crunch and low response
which<00:06:12.610> is<00:06:13.599> what's<00:06:13.900> messing<00:06:14.169> from<00:06:14.409> a<00:06:14.439> lot<00:06:14.560> of

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:14.620 
which is what's messing from a lot of

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:16.110 
which is what's messing from a lot of
distortion<00:06:15.069> pedals<00:06:15.460> and<00:06:15.610> when<00:06:15.969> they're

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:16.120 
distortion pedals and when they're

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:17.760 
distortion pedals and when they're
trying<00:06:16.270> to<00:06:16.419> sound<00:06:16.689> like<00:06:16.780> five<00:06:17.139> amps<00:06:17.530> you<00:06:17.590> don't

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:17.770 
trying to sound like five amps you don't

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:19.980 
trying to sound like five amps you don't
get<00:06:17.949> the<00:06:18.099> low-end<00:06:18.849> responsive<00:06:19.479> manner<00:06:19.719> to

get the low-end responsive manner to

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:22.350 
get the low-end responsive manner to
achieve<00:06:20.080> that<00:06:20.560> with<00:06:21.009> this<00:06:21.340> pedal<00:06:21.729> giving<00:06:22.210> us

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:22.360 
achieve that with this pedal giving us

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.689 
achieve that with this pedal giving us
somewhere<00:06:22.960> in<00:06:23.139> the<00:06:23.229> region<00:06:23.409> of<00:06:23.620> a<00:06:24.250> cranked

we've<00:06:37.750> come<00:06:37.960> to<00:06:38.110> expect<00:06:38.469> when<00:06:38.770> we<00:06:38.800> try<00:06:39.009> to

00:06:39.029 --> 00:06:39.039 
we've come to expect when we try to

00:06:39.039 --> 00:06:41.490 
we've come to expect when we try to
simulate<00:06:39.400> valve<00:06:40.210> amplifiers<00:06:40.750> the<00:06:41.050> pedal<00:06:41.379> is

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:41.500 
simulate valve amplifiers the pedal is

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.260 
simulate valve amplifiers the pedal is
no<00:06:41.620> viciously<00:06:42.159> loud<00:06:42.460> and<00:06:42.729> we've<00:06:42.909> managed<00:06:43.180> to

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:43.270 
no viciously loud and we've managed to

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:45.149 
no viciously loud and we've managed to
take<00:06:43.479> that<00:06:43.689> powerful<00:06:44.080> tone<00:06:44.439> control<00:06:44.949> and

00:06:45.149 --> 00:06:45.159 
take that powerful tone control and

00:06:45.159 --> 00:06:47.309 
take that powerful tone control and
shape<00:06:45.699> it<00:06:45.879> in<00:06:46.000> such<00:06:46.150> a<00:06:46.180> way<00:06:46.330> that<00:06:46.900> it's<00:06:47.020> far

00:06:47.309 --> 00:06:47.319 
shape it in such a way that it's far

00:06:47.319 --> 00:06:49.469 
shape it in such a way that it's far
more<00:06:47.349> usable<00:06:48.039> than<00:06:48.159> was<00:06:48.310> before<00:06:48.759> the

00:06:49.469 --> 00:06:49.479 
more usable than was before the

00:06:49.479 --> 00:06:51.450 
more usable than was before the
distortion<00:06:49.960> now<00:06:50.110> sounds<00:06:50.349> absolutely<00:06:50.650> huge<00:06:51.279> in

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:51.460 
distortion now sounds absolutely huge in

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:52.950 
distortion now sounds absolutely huge in
the<00:06:51.550> room<00:06:51.729> which<00:06:51.879> would<00:06:52.000> make<00:06:52.120> this<00:06:52.240> fantastic

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:52.960 
the room which would make this fantastic

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.260 
the room which would make this fantastic
for<00:06:53.080> a<00:06:53.139> practice<00:06:53.680> device<00:06:54.279> especially<00:06:54.940> if

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:55.270 
for a practice device especially if

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:56.760 
for a practice device especially if
you've<00:06:55.389> only<00:06:55.539> got<00:06:55.750> a<00:06:55.779> cheap<00:06:56.050> amplifier<00:06:56.650> that

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:56.770 
you've only got a cheap amplifier that

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:58.170 
you've only got a cheap amplifier that
doesn't<00:06:57.009> do<00:06:57.129> built-in<00:06:57.639> distortion

00:06:58.170 --> 00:06:58.180 
doesn't do built-in distortion

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:00.180 
doesn't do built-in distortion
particularly<00:06:58.690> well<00:06:58.990> and<00:06:59.229> this<00:06:59.830> is<00:07:00.009> going<00:07:00.099> to

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:00.190 
particularly well and this is going to

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:02.820 
particularly well and this is going to
get<00:07:00.310> you<00:07:00.460> far<00:07:00.879> closer<00:07:01.210> to<00:07:01.419> a<00:07:01.569> very<00:07:01.839> load<00:07:02.110> final

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:02.830 
get you far closer to a very load final

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:05.579 
get you far closer to a very load final
amp<00:07:03.129> sound<00:07:03.819> great<00:07:04.509> for<00:07:04.719> live<00:07:04.930> as<00:07:05.169> well<00:07:05.319> I<00:07:05.349> would

00:07:05.579 --> 00:07:05.589 
amp sound great for live as well I would

00:07:05.589 --> 00:07:07.320 
amp sound great for live as well I would
think<00:07:05.620> maybe<00:07:06.190> not<00:07:06.400> so<00:07:06.550> much<00:07:06.699> for<00:07:06.909> the<00:07:06.969> studio

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:07.330 
think maybe not so much for the studio

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:09.930 
think maybe not so much for the studio
and<00:07:07.539> because<00:07:08.440> of<00:07:08.469> that<00:07:08.650> extended<00:07:09.129> distortion

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:09.940 
and because of that extended distortion

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:11.850 
and because of that extended distortion
into<00:07:10.089> the<00:07:10.270> base<00:07:10.479> and<00:07:10.779> of<00:07:11.319> the<00:07:11.409> frequency

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:11.860 
into the base and of the frequency

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:12.659 
into the base and of the frequency
although<00:07:12.009> that's<00:07:12.190> something<00:07:12.490> you<00:07:12.550> could

00:07:12.659 --> 00:07:12.669 
although that's something you could

00:07:12.669 --> 00:07:15.360 
although that's something you could
probably<00:07:13.270> tweak<00:07:13.539> out<00:07:13.750> with<00:07:14.169> that<00:07:14.379> resistor<00:07:14.830> 13

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:15.370 
probably tweak out with that resistor 13

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:17.249 
probably tweak out with that resistor 13
and<00:07:15.580> not<00:07:15.969> have<00:07:16.120> quite<00:07:16.360> a<00:07:16.389> higher<00:07:16.719> value<00:07:17.199> so

00:07:17.249 --> 00:07:17.259 
and not have quite a higher value so

00:07:17.259 --> 00:07:18.719 
and not have quite a higher value so
you're<00:07:17.379> not<00:07:17.439> bringing<00:07:17.680> a<00:07:17.800> distortion<00:07:18.159> there

00:07:18.719 --> 00:07:18.729 
you're not bringing a distortion there

00:07:18.729 --> 00:07:20.550 
you're not bringing a distortion there
are<00:07:18.819> no<00:07:19.000> Lorde<00:07:19.210> frequencies<00:07:19.779> quite<00:07:20.020> so<00:07:20.319> much

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:20.560 
are no Lorde frequencies quite so much

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.170 
are no Lorde frequencies quite so much
so<00:07:20.949> maybe<00:07:21.039> that's<00:07:21.279> something<00:07:21.430> to<00:07:21.610> play<00:07:22.089> about

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:22.180 
so maybe that's something to play about

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:23.969 
so maybe that's something to play about
with<00:07:22.330> and<00:07:22.629> tweak<00:07:22.870> em<00:07:23.080> if<00:07:23.560> you're<00:07:23.710> going<00:07:23.800> to<00:07:23.919> do

00:07:23.969 --> 00:07:23.979 
with and tweak em if you're going to do

00:07:23.979 --> 00:07:25.769 
with and tweak em if you're going to do
this<00:07:24.159> modification<00:07:24.490> as<00:07:25.419> I<00:07:25.509> say<00:07:25.629> there's

00:07:25.769 --> 00:07:25.779 
this modification as I say there's

00:07:25.779 --> 00:07:27.149 
this modification as I say there's
plenty<00:07:26.169> of<00:07:26.199> things<00:07:26.349> that<00:07:26.469> can<00:07:26.650> be<00:07:26.770> done<00:07:26.800> to<00:07:27.069> the

00:07:27.149 --> 00:07:27.159 
plenty of things that can be done to the

00:07:27.159 --> 00:07:29.309 
plenty of things that can be done to the
ds1<00:07:27.639> to<00:07:27.789> change<00:07:28.089> its<00:07:28.330> own<00:07:28.599> you<00:07:28.839> can<00:07:28.960> tweak<00:07:29.169> some

00:07:29.309 --> 00:07:29.319 
ds1 to change its own you can tweak some

00:07:29.319 --> 00:07:31.350 
ds1 to change its own you can tweak some
of<00:07:29.349> the<00:07:29.409> values<00:07:29.830> that<00:07:29.860> I've<00:07:30.250> used<00:07:30.550> here<00:07:30.819> or<00:07:30.969> you

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:31.360 
of the values that I've used here or you

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:33.779 
of the values that I've used here or you
can<00:07:31.479> do<00:07:31.629> things<00:07:31.810> that<00:07:31.990> I've<00:07:32.139> chosen<00:07:32.409> not<00:07:33.069> to<00:07:33.339> do

00:07:33.779 --> 00:07:33.789 
can do things that I've chosen not to do

00:07:33.789 --> 00:07:35.219
