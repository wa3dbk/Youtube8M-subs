00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:09.160
 this device represents an improvement 

00:00:06.849 --> 00:00:11.049
 in every way but not a change 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.240
 radical to up or it will be worth it 

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:15.070
 update how are i am vanessa hand 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.930
 orellana for cinema in Spanish for 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.880
 give a more detailed look at 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:20.679
 iphone 6 apple design is 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.990
 probably the most obvious change that 

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:25.420
 you will notice in this new model now it is 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.550
 thinner and curved and completely from 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.679
 aluminum there are those who say that it looks more 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.660
 elegant while others prefer the 

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:33.940
 look old and I at least think that 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:36.010
 It depends on your tastes but let's stop 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.960
 stories that the main attraction of 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.120
 this phone comparing it with the 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:43.150
 previous models is the size of the 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.190
 screen is now 4.7 inches with 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:47.050
 higher resolution than the previous one but of 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.880
 the same pixel density is not 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.100
 drastic change but in this phone 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.650
 more detail and higher contrast is seen in 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.060
 the image according to jobs the ancients 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.610
 iphone models had the size 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:59.890
 maximum to be able to control with only one 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.420
 hand but iPhone 6 proves that there 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.790
 it was law because you can control 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.679
 comfortably with one hand or at least the 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.980
 mine that is not very delicate that we say 

00:01:05.679 --> 00:01:10.260
 this thanks to the design also 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:12.240
 and partly because of this practical function of 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.400
 which ability that shrinks your screen 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.650
 when you play twice on the surface 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.180
 of the menu button the other attraction that 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.220
 has this phone is one that does not 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.230
 we can see at a glance the 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.240
 iPhone 6 comes with an energy chip or 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.980
 near field communication that what 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.680
 will become that electronic wallet 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:30.630
 that many were waiting for up or in 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.000
 set with the app service of 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.860
 aigÃ¼es 8 you can make purchases with 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.050
 just slide the phone in front of 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.940
 sensor and enter your fingerprint in the touch 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:42.480
 aydin inside comes with a processor 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:44.610
 more powerful the 64 bit a8 chip and 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.290
 metal a new graphics engine that 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.660
 will improve the experience within 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.240
 videogames the old iphones were 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:53.160
 fast but this one is a machine and 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.990
 the gamers with whom you chat are 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.640
 very happy with the performance of the 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.350
 videogames since the sensor 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.870
 movement or as a processor that we saw 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.850
 first on the iphone 5s is now called 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:05.010
 m 8 and has more functions than the 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.540
 previous when you use it together 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.550
 with the new apple health app 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.470
 called health among them the ability 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.300
 to count the steps you have climbed 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.190
 but I think the camera was what most 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.550
 I was surprised how they did not increase the 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.470
 number 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.120
 megapixels I did not think I was going to see a 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.340
 great difference in the quality of the 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.440
 image has a new lens with a better 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.200
 autofocus and looks in greater depth 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.610
 and detail in the photos now also you 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.070
 allows to record video in high definition 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.290
 of 60 frames per second with 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.660
 automatic stabilization and autofocus 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.910
 continued also with it is 8 you can 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.710
 record a timelapse or time lapse and 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.020
 the slow motion is even slower than 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:42.420
 before the front camera is still of 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:45.120
 1.2 megapixels but includes the option 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.190
 of burst and video in hd to these improvements 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.050
 consolidate the iphone as one of the 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.420
 best phones for mobile photography 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.190
 in the market but it also has its 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.350
 you fail my biggest disappointment was the 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.450
 Battery life according to a posture 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.490
 one hour more than the 5 s but in reality 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.530
 I did not notice much the difference between 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:03.720
 duration of both do not wait either 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.310
 Expandable storage on iPhone 6 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.290
 but at least they increased the 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.080
 internal storage the cheapest 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.810
 still offering 16 gigabytes but then 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:16.140
 jump to 64 gigabytes for 100 dollars 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.970
 more and 128 in the most expensive model for 200 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.950
 dollars more than the basic and between 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.060
 two new models this is the one that most 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.190
 convince 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.050
 is the best version to date of a 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.730
 phone that was already a leader in the market 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:28.680
 remember that you can read our
