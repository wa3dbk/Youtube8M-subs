00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
chance which is really what this power

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.959 
chance which is really what this power
is<00:00:51.149> based<00:00:51.360> off<00:00:51.600> of<00:00:51.660> which<00:00:52.170> is<00:00:52.320> might<00:00:52.940> go<00:00:53.940> over

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
is based off of which is might go over

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.540 
is based off of which is might go over
grab<00:00:54.480> chain<00:00:54.809> gun<00:00:55.079> in<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.530> five<00:00:55.770> barrel<00:00:56.280> I

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
grab chain gun in the five barrel I

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.670 
grab chain gun in the five barrel I
don't<00:00:57.270> even<00:00:57.390> think<00:00:57.539> I<00:00:57.719> use<00:00:57.960> five<00:00:58.170> barrels<00:00:58.440> so

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
don't even think I use five barrels so

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:59.990 
don't even think I use five barrels so
you<00:00:58.770> could<00:00:58.920> use<00:00:59.160> that<00:00:59.309> for<00:00:59.550> something<00:00:59.579> else

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
you could use that for something else

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.590 
you could use that for something else
but<00:01:00.840> I<00:01:00.899> then<00:01:01.500> go<00:01:01.859> over<00:01:01.890> here<00:01:02.190> to<00:01:02.250> rocket<00:01:02.850> rocket

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
but I then go over here to rocket rocket

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.219 
but I then go over here to rocket rocket
launcher<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.350> grab<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.680> 50<00:01:04.949> Cal<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:05.519> then

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
launcher and grab the 50 Cal and then

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:09.170 
launcher and grab the 50 Cal and then
glory<00:01:07.229> just<00:01:07.530> go<00:01:07.740> down<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:08.130> grab<00:01:08.220> explosion

Iconix you just grab the two damages but

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.830 
Iconix you just grab the two damages but
since<00:01:15.119> my<00:01:15.390> loadout<00:01:15.750> doesn't<00:01:16.200> run<00:01:17.659> doesn't<00:01:18.659> run

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
since my loadout doesn't run doesn't run

since my loadout doesn't run doesn't run
the<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.619> five<00:01:19.890> barrel<00:01:20.360> this<00:01:21.360> is<00:01:21.540> what<00:01:21.689> I

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
the the five barrel this is what I

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.630 
the the five barrel this is what I
recommend<00:01:22.140> doing<00:01:22.409> I'll<00:01:23.189> probably<00:01:23.400> do<00:01:23.610> it

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
recommend doing I'll probably do it

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.149 
recommend doing I'll probably do it
after<00:01:23.970> this<00:01:24.090> just<00:01:24.869> take<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.350> five<00:01:25.650> barrel<00:01:26.009> off

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
after this just take the five barrel off

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.819 
after this just take the five barrel off
don't<00:01:26.460> grab<00:01:26.640> this<00:01:26.820> one<00:01:27.000> right<00:01:27.180> here<00:01:27.770> go<00:01:28.770> to

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
don't grab this one right here go to

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.260 
don't grab this one right here go to
Iconix<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:29.820> I<00:01:30.180> I<00:01:30.600> would<00:01:31.049> grab<00:01:31.909> I've<00:01:32.909> grabbed

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
Iconix and I I would grab I've grabbed

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.200 
Iconix and I I would grab I've grabbed
the<00:01:33.420> power<00:01:33.630> in<00:01:34.340> vitalization<00:01:35.340> maybe<00:01:35.729> or<00:01:36.060> the

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
the power in vitalization maybe or the

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.789 
the power in vitalization maybe or the
defense<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:36.810> toughness<00:01:37.170> probably<00:01:37.530> defense

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
defense and toughness probably defense

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.140 
defense and toughness probably defense
and<00:01:37.979> toughness<00:01:38.310> because<00:01:38.549> you<00:01:38.700> really<00:01:38.970> don't

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
and toughness because you really don't

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.929 
and toughness because you really don't
need<00:01:39.329> any<00:01:39.570> more<00:01:39.720> power<00:01:40.159> because<00:01:41.159> you<00:01:41.759> don't

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
need any more power because you don't

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.219 
need any more power because you don't
run<00:01:42.090> out<00:01:42.240> of<00:01:42.270> power<00:01:42.509> using<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.990> advanced

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
run out of power using the advanced

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.310 
run out of power using the advanced
mechanics<00:01:43.829> I<00:01:44.009> bye<00:01:44.189> Nana<00:01:44.490> we've<00:01:44.729> armor<00:01:45.320> but

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
mechanics I bye Nana we've armor but

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.929 
mechanics I bye Nana we've armor but
that's<00:01:46.770> besides<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.250> point<00:01:47.310> it's<00:01:47.759> really

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
that's besides the point it's really

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.460 
that's besides the point it's really
useless<00:01:48.329> you<00:01:48.570> really<00:01:48.780> don't<00:01:48.960> need<00:01:49.079> any<00:01:49.380> more

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
useless you really don't need any more

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.990 
useless you really don't need any more
defense<00:01:49.920> or<00:01:50.070> toughness<00:01:50.460> so<00:01:50.640> it<00:01:50.700> doesn't

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
defense or toughness so it doesn't

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.910 
defense or toughness so it doesn't
matter<00:01:51.090> but<00:01:51.899> let's<00:01:52.049> start<00:01:52.229> to<00:01:52.350> load<00:01:52.590> out<00:01:52.740> right

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
matter but let's start to load out right

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.730 
matter but let's start to load out right
here<00:01:53.390> so<00:01:54.390> right<00:01:54.750> here<00:01:54.930> you<00:01:54.960> have<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.259> 50<00:01:55.530> Cal

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
here so right here you have the 50 Cal

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.980 
here so right here you have the 50 Cal
and<00:01:56.040> you<00:01:56.880> can<00:01:57.030> put<00:01:57.180> these<00:01:57.299> in<00:01:57.450> any<00:01:57.600> order<00:01:57.899> you

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
and you can put these in any order you

out I don't know if they didn't he

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.000 
out I don't know if they didn't he
changes<00:02:30.990> to<00:02:31.110> this<00:02:31.200> but<00:02:31.410> this<00:02:31.470> is<00:02:31.620> what<00:02:31.800> I've

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
changes to this but this is what I've

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.030 
changes to this but this is what I've
been<00:02:32.220> running<00:02:32.490> for<00:02:32.850> a<00:02:33.210> long<00:02:33.480> time<00:02:33.840> and<00:02:34.050> me<00:02:34.890> and

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
been running for a long time and me and

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.650 
been running for a long time and me and
a<00:02:35.070> couple<00:02:35.190> friends<00:02:35.370> tested<00:02:36.060> out<00:02:36.180> the<00:02:36.210> damage

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
a couple friends tested out the damage

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.090 
a couple friends tested out the damage
for<00:02:36.840> a<00:02:36.900> couple<00:02:37.170> hours<00:02:37.260> to<00:02:37.620> figure<00:02:37.770> out<00:02:37.980> which

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
for a couple hours to figure out which

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.650 
for a couple hours to figure out which
is<00:02:38.160> the<00:02:38.280> best<00:02:38.400> loadout<00:02:38.940> and<00:02:39.090> this<00:02:39.180> is<00:02:39.330> probably

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
is the best loadout and this is probably

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.740 
is the best loadout and this is probably
the<00:02:39.810> best<00:02:40.200> one<00:02:40.730> fastest<00:02:41.730> most<00:02:42.030> useful<00:02:42.450> it<00:02:42.600> out

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
the best one fastest most useful it out

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.330 
the best one fastest most useful it out
so<00:02:43.050> here<00:02:43.260> we<00:02:43.290> got<00:02:43.500> our<00:02:43.590> sparring<00:02:43.860> targets<00:02:44.250> to

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
so here we got our sparring targets to

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.510 
so here we got our sparring targets to
start<00:02:44.670> off<00:02:44.790> with<00:02:45.000> explosion<00:02:45.720> on<00:02:45.900> my<00:02:46.230> l2<00:02:47.100> square

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
start off with explosion on my l2 square

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.480 
start off with explosion on my l2 square
and<00:02:48.120> go<00:02:48.630> right<00:02:48.900> into<00:02:49.050> the<00:02:49.230> l2<00:02:49.590> triangle<00:02:50.220> buff

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 
and go right into the l2 triangle buff

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:54.140 
and go right into the l2 triangle buff
and<00:02:50.730> then<00:02:51.240> go<00:02:51.420> in<00:02:51.540> 50<00:02:52.020> Cal<00:02:52.230> going<00:02:52.560> chain<00:02:52.920> gun<00:02:53.190> go

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
and then go in 50 Cal going chain gun go

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.360 
and then go in 50 Cal going chain gun go
into<00:02:54.300> rocket<00:02:54.690> launcher<00:02:55.050> tap<00:02:55.620> triangle<00:02:56.220> with

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
into rocket launcher tap triangle with

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.720 
into rocket launcher tap triangle with
your<00:02:56.550> gun<00:02:56.760> because<00:02:57.540> then<00:02:57.720> you<00:02:57.840> can<00:02:57.960> get<00:02:58.080> your

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
your gun because then you can get your

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.550 
your gun because then you can get your
your<00:02:59.730> blast<00:03:00.120> adapter<00:03:00.630> off<00:03:00.840> from<00:03:01.050> the<00:03:01.200> weapon

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
your blast adapter off from the weapon

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.240 
your blast adapter off from the weapon
which<00:03:02.370> actually<00:03:03.030> is<00:03:03.360> useful<00:03:03.810> so<00:03:04.740> you<00:03:04.800> do<00:03:05.070> that

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
which actually is useful so you do that

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.310 
which actually is useful so you do that
every<00:03:05.460> once<00:03:05.880> in<00:03:06.000> a<00:03:06.060> while<00:03:06.180> tap<00:03:06.540> a<00:03:06.570> triangle<00:03:07.170> and

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
every once in a while tap a triangle and

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.080 
every once in a while tap a triangle and
clip<00:03:07.590> right<00:03:07.770> into<00:03:08.040> it<00:03:08.160> so<00:03:08.310> i'll<00:03:08.400> just<00:03:08.460> type<00:03:08.910> it

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
clip right into it so i'll just type it

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.000 
clip right into it so i'll just type it
right<00:03:09.210> there<00:03:09.390> so<00:03:10.080> you<00:03:10.140> sell<00:03:10.500> it<00:03:10.530> to<00:03:10.770> a<00:03:10.800> tee

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
right there so you sell it to a tee

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.680 
right there so you sell it to a tee
that's<00:03:11.490> from<00:03:11.670> my<00:03:11.820> what<00:03:12.030> the<00:03:12.120> night<00:03:12.270> is<00:03:12.390> cooked

it you didn't see it so you just keep on
going<00:03:15.090> on<00:03:15.420> this<00:03:15.540> rotation<00:03:15.750> and<00:03:16.970> one<00:03:17.970> other

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
going on this rotation and one other

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.570 
going on this rotation and one other
little<00:03:18.540> tip<00:03:18.870> here<00:03:19.080> stand<00:03:19.860> real<00:03:20.100> close<00:03:20.130> to<00:03:20.460> your

in like a rate or something stand closer

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:26.540 
in like a rate or something stand closer
to<00:03:25.200> enemies<00:03:25.590> especially<00:03:25.800> if<00:03:26.280> you<00:03:26.370> like<00:03:26.520> just

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
fighting adds bosses I would stand a

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.550 
fighting adds bosses I would stand a
little<00:03:29.070> farther<00:03:29.400> away<00:03:29.930> unless<00:03:30.930> you<00:03:31.140> unless

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
little farther away unless you unless

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.030 
little farther away unless you unless

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
you know you you your teammates can not

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.520 
you know you you your teammates can not
pick<00:03:35.040> you<00:03:35.070> back<00:03:35.280> up<00:03:35.510> so<00:03:36.510> really<00:03:37.050> that's<00:03:37.290> the

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
pick you back up so really that's the

pick you back up so really that's the
wood<00:03:37.680> out<00:03:37.830> so<00:03:38.280> just<00:03:38.940> go<00:03:39.510> through<00:03:39.930> like<00:03:40.710> this

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
wood out so just go through like this

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.030 
wood out so just go through like this
explosion<00:03:42.959> into<00:03:43.170> the<00:03:43.260> buff<00:03:43.470> one<00:03:43.680> ever<00:03:43.830> comes

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
explosion into the buff one ever comes

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.900 
explosion into the buff one ever comes
