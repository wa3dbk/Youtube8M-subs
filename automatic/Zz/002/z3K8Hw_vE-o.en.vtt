00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
didn't feel like buying it but then

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.340 
didn't feel like buying it but then
after<00:01:11.240> i<00:01:11.270> sent<00:01:11.509> the<00:01:11.570> request<00:01:11.720> and<00:01:12.079> everything

button after i'm done recording and the
thing<00:03:08.710> I<00:03:08.860> found<00:03:09.070> is<00:03:09.430> you<00:03:10.090> need<00:03:10.240> to<00:03:10.300> take<00:03:10.450> this

thing I found is you need to take this

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.630 
thing I found is you need to take this
out<00:03:10.780> first<00:03:11.050> because<00:03:11.340> when<00:03:12.340> you<00:03:12.430> want<00:03:12.580> to

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
out first because when you want to

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.190 
out first because when you want to
listen<00:03:12.760> to<00:03:12.910> audio<00:03:13.270> it<00:03:13.570> treats<00:03:13.840> it<00:03:14.020> like<00:03:14.050> a

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
listen to audio it treats it like a

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.260 
listen to audio it treats it like a
microphone<00:03:14.590> I<00:03:15.010> mean<00:03:15.400> like<00:03:15.550> a<00:03:15.580> headphone<00:03:16.000> and

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.270
