00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
 Do you want to make a really beautiful lunch or dinner, but your table is very small? 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.000
 We have a solution. 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
 Today we will make a dining table of oak material for a minimum of 6 people. 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 For this purpose we need a table for wood table, glue material for the legs on the table ... 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:31.000
 ... router, battery screwdriver and drill. 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 Order to cut legs in the building materials store or carpenter. 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.500
 The legs have two narrow and two broad sections respectively. 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 ... which are assembled with a groove and a feather. 

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:58.000
 For assembly, we first need to know which part to which leg belongs. 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.500
 Second: Where are the parts - outside or inside? 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.500
 For this purpose, we mark the bottom sides with a triangle and a number ... 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 ... to know what foot it is about. 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 For jaw and feather assemblies ... 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.000
 ... attach the wooden part. 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 Then we routed the router ... 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 ... channels with a depth of 11 mm. 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:02.000
 We have already cut the wide parts on the inside with the milling cutter ... 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.500
 ... and narrow - on the front. 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 For gluing, put glue on the groove and the front side. 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 Now put the pen in the groove and then all the parts into each other. 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 When everything is firmly attached, let it dry. 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 To do this, we put a residual piece of wood on the broad side ... 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.000
 ... and we take them with three cuffs. 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 In doing so, observe the drying time according to the manufacturer's instructions. 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
 When the glue is dry, the foot looks like this. 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000
 When the legs are ready, we assemble them with the table top. 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
 We placed the table top with the top side on a work surface. 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:40.000
 On the inner sides of the legs, we mount these mounting angles for fastening. 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.000
 That's why we broke through these openings, and that's all ... 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.000
 ... always 1 mm smaller than the diameter of the screw. 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 The edges of the legs are sharp, but the mounting corners are rounded from the inside. 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.500
 To fit the two parts, we cut a small curve on the table leg. 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.500
 When the brackets are mounted, ... 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.500
 ... put the legs on a level with the corners of the table top. 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:19.000
 We put our feet on the table. 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:24.000
 In order to stabilize the whole structure, we use these kings. 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.000
 Tightly tighten the drilled bushings to the outside of the mounting corners. 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:42.000
 Before you start with surface treatment ... 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.500
 ... you have to jump the edges on the table. 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.500
 For this purpose, bend the edges at an angle of 45 degrees with sandpaper 180. 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.000
 So then you will not be cut. 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.500
 And the result looks better. 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000
 For surface treatment sand first with sandpaper 180, ... 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.500
 ... then - with 240. 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000
 Then wet the hob with a damp cloth. 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:22.500
 On drying, the wood fibers rise, ... 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000
 ... which you can sand with 180 sandpaper. 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:41.000
 When working with wax, follow the instructions of the product
