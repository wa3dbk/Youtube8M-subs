00:00:02.409 --> 00:00:07.810
 a drone is an unmanned aircraft 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:10.900
 autonomous programmed for a mission or 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:10.900
 Remote controlled remote 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:18.679
 it's both the aircraft and the station 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:22.099
 on the ground that allows to direct a pact 

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:24.230
 by its primary function is 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:26.329
 extend the look increase the 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:31.189
 distance of view especially in the frame 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:33.140
 of intelligence they operate at high or 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:33.680
 average altitude with great 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.870
 autonomy 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.940
 unlike tactical UAVs more 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:41.020
 discreet who they are monitoring the field of 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:43.790
 battle and n the soldier on the ground 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.890
 since 2007 France have 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:49.160
 Tactical UAVs with a small radius of action 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:51.040
 especially the drac drone intelligence 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.530
 in contact there are 300 are in the running 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.750
 among the drones of the future dassault put 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.480
 to the point breaks a demonstrator 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.640
 combat drone with an experimental purpose 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.620
 this European program is intended to 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:07.010
 advance stealth aircraft 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.640
 hunting to achieve such 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.470
 performances 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.870
 engineers worked on the 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.060
 materials and on the form they have limited 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:16.880
 the right surfaces likely to 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.580
 return the drift radar waves 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.820
 important reflectors was totally 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.979
 removed the engineers have developed 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.470
 a flight control system allowing 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:31.370
 to make this aircraft flyable without its 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:33.070
 drift the place of the armament did not 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:35.960
 been left to chance 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:39.670
 hidden in an internal hold it is endowed 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.670
 a specific drop system 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.240
 to be stealthy is to avoid 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.290
 protuberances on the fuselage 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.380
 this has resulted in many 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:53.110
 developments in technology 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:56.440
 antennas are floch ie integrated 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:58.450
 in the structure the parameters 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.340
 anemometric are calculated using 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.170
 pressure taps drowned in the 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.100
 coatings and not using probes 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.660
 as on conventional aircraft 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.850
 the optical sensor is located at 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.710
 the inside of the drone behind a window 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:18.100
 and no longer outside as was 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:19.840
 the damocles friend for not being 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.470
 detected or to be later 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.480
 possible 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.760
 the aircraft must display a surface 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.660
 equivalent radar corresponding to that 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:30.490
 what would a monk or steel for 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.990
 decrease the thermal signature the 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:34.360
 nozzle of the plane were worked 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:38.860
 to dilute the heat spray as much as possible 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:40.780
 coming out of the reactor the development 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.220
 of a europe participate in the advanced 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.040
 technology for the next generation 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:48.989
 of fighter jets aviation fighter 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.989
 of tomorrow now begins
