so<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:38.219> most<00:00:38.399> obvious<00:00:38.700> to<00:00:39.600> start<00:00:39.870> off<00:00:40.020> with<00:00:40.230> I

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
so the most obvious to start off with I

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.479 
so the most obvious to start off with I
got<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.250> Sidewinder<00:00:41.940> 3<00:00:42.239> and<00:00:44.000> 5,700<00:00:45.000> kv

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489 
got the Sidewinder 3 and 5,700 kv

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:48.529 
got the Sidewinder 3 and 5,700 kv
waterproof<00:00:47.489> I<00:00:47.789> think<00:00:48.360> they're<00:00:48.450> all

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
waterproof I think they're all

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.380 
waterproof I think they're all
waterproof<00:00:48.960> now<00:00:49.430> but<00:00:50.430> you<00:00:50.820> have<00:00:50.969> my<00:00:51.149> first

waterproof now but you have my first

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.279 
waterproof now but you have my first
castle<00:00:51.719> system<00:00:52.320> um<00:00:53.750> I've<00:00:54.750> got<00:00:54.780> some<00:00:55.050> big<00:00:55.260> news

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
castle system um I've got some big news

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.660 
castle system um I've got some big news
about<00:00:55.739> what<00:00:55.920> I'm<00:00:56.010> going<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.160> do<00:00:56.370> with<00:00:56.489> this

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
about what I'm going to do with this

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.439 
about what I'm going to do with this
probably<00:00:57.570> not<00:00:57.719> what<00:00:57.899> you<00:00:57.930> guys<00:00:58.170> are<00:00:58.379> expecting

00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449 
probably not what you guys are expecting

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:04.880 
probably not what you guys are expecting
so<00:01:00.449> talk<00:01:01.050> about<00:01:01.260> that<00:01:01.410> later<00:01:02.449> in<00:01:03.559> this<00:01:04.559> little

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
so talk about that later in this little

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.710 
so talk about that later in this little
bag

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:18.700 

i<00:01:13.090> was<00:01:14.090> recommended<00:01:14.350> the<00:01:15.350> techno<00:01:17.380> drive<00:01:18.380> shaft

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
i was recommended the techno drive shaft

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.310 
i was recommended the techno drive shaft
for<00:01:19.010> the<00:01:19.130> /<00:01:19.400> 40<00:01:19.760> for<00:01:20.030> center<00:01:20.390> drive<00:01:20.660> shaft<00:01:20.960> or

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
for the / 40 for center drive shaft or

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:28.390 
for the / 40 for center drive shaft or
driveline<00:01:23.650> so<00:01:26.380> yeah<00:01:27.380> thought<00:01:27.980> that'd<00:01:28.190> be<00:01:28.370> a

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.400 
driveline so yeah thought that'd be a

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:34.270 
driveline so yeah thought that'd be a
good<00:01:28.610> upgrade<00:01:28.790> start<00:01:29.510> off<00:01:29.630> with<00:01:29.840> at<00:01:30.170> least<00:01:33.280> RPM

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
good upgrade start off with at least RPM

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.000 
good upgrade start off with at least RPM
shock<00:01:34.490> tower<00:01:34.730> for<00:01:35.150> the<00:01:35.440> Rustler<00:01:36.440> I<00:01:36.940> wrestler

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.980 
shock tower for the Rustler I wrestler
also<00:01:40.010> has<00:01:40.310> a<00:01:40.400> story<00:01:40.640> behind<00:01:40.729> it<00:01:41.150> so<00:01:41.420> i'll<00:01:41.810> get

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
also has a story behind it so i'll get

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.580 
also has a story behind it so i'll get
to<00:01:42.080> that<00:01:42.110> the<00:01:42.410> end<00:01:43.900> and<00:01:44.900> then<00:01:45.290> I<00:01:45.380> got<00:01:45.500> an

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
to that the end and then I got an

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.890 
to that the end and then I got an
antenna<00:01:45.890> for<00:01:46.310> the<00:01:46.369> four-by-four<00:01:49.090> so<00:01:50.090> yeah<00:01:50.479> so

antenna for the four-by-four so yeah so

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.070 
antenna for the four-by-four so yeah so
as<00:01:51.229> some<00:01:52.100> of<00:01:52.250> you<00:01:52.340> may<00:01:52.400> remember<00:01:52.580> this<00:01:53.509> is<00:01:53.720> my

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
as some of you may remember this is my

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.910 
as some of you may remember this is my
Rustler<00:01:54.470> and<00:01:54.800> I<00:01:55.490> recently<00:01:56.380> really<00:01:57.380> damage<00:01:57.800> to

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
Rustler and I recently really damage to

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.920 
Rustler and I recently really damage to
the<00:01:58.009> rear<00:01:58.190> shock<00:01:58.460> tower<00:01:58.729> on<00:01:58.970> that<00:01:59.180> the<00:01:59.540> re

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
the rear shock tower on that the re

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.790 
the rear shock tower on that the re
racers<00:02:00.680> edge<00:02:00.860> machine<00:02:01.040> shock<00:02:01.520> tower<00:02:02.290> so<00:02:03.290> I

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:03.800 
racers edge machine shock tower so I

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.100 
racers edge machine shock tower so I
sent<00:02:04.340> it<00:02:04.520> in<00:02:04.670> it's<00:02:05.509> all<00:02:05.660> cool<00:02:05.869> with<00:02:05.930> that

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
sent it in it's all cool with that

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.710 
sent it in it's all cool with that
they're<00:02:06.380> making<00:02:06.650> another<00:02:06.740> one<00:02:07.390> and<00:02:08.390> other

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
they're making another one and other

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.190 
they're making another one and other
parts<00:02:09.670> don't<00:02:10.670> come<00:02:10.910> out<00:02:11.000> very<00:02:11.180> fast<00:02:11.540> they<00:02:12.080> have

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
parts don't come out very fast they have

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.190 
parts don't come out very fast they have
to<00:02:12.350> make<00:02:12.530> them<00:02:12.800> and<00:02:13.040> have<00:02:13.489> a<00:02:13.580> huge<00:02:13.850> list<00:02:14.330> a<00:02:14.780> huge

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
to make them and have a huge list a huge

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.490 
to make them and have a huge list a huge
lion<00:02:15.530> I<00:02:15.769> guess<00:02:16.000> so<00:02:17.000> I<00:02:17.030> guess<00:02:17.750> until<00:02:18.140> that<00:02:18.350> one

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
lion I guess so I guess until that one

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.280 
lion I guess so I guess until that one
comes<00:02:18.739> in<00:02:18.920> and<00:02:19.070> maybe<00:02:19.220> after<00:02:19.850> I<00:02:20.120> have<00:02:20.660> this<00:02:20.810> RPM

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
comes in and maybe after I have this RPM

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.420 
comes in and maybe after I have this RPM
one<00:02:21.470> to<00:02:21.950> go<00:02:22.070> on<00:02:22.160> there<00:02:22.370> and<00:02:23.019> I<00:02:24.019> feel<00:02:24.650> like<00:02:24.950> that

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
one to go on there and I feel like that

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.130 
one to go on there and I feel like that
was<00:02:25.580> probably<00:02:25.790> the<00:02:25.910> only<00:02:26.090> flaw<00:02:26.540> on<00:02:26.810> the

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
was probably the only flaw on the

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.250 
was probably the only flaw on the
Rustler<00:02:27.500> would<00:02:28.340> be<00:02:28.459> the<00:02:28.580> rear<00:02:28.760> shock<00:02:29.000> tower

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
Rustler would be the rear shock tower

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.820 
Rustler would be the rear shock tower
because<00:02:30.260> the<00:02:31.010> front<00:02:31.220> shock<00:02:31.580> tower<00:02:32.620> has<00:02:33.620> these

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
because the front shock tower has these

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.910 
because the front shock tower has these
body<00:02:34.130> posts<00:02:34.700> that<00:02:35.510> when<00:02:36.050> the<00:02:36.200> if<00:02:36.440> it<00:02:36.650> lands

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
body posts that when the if it lands

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.660 
body posts that when the if it lands
upside<00:02:37.070> down<00:02:37.510> these<00:02:38.510> flex<00:02:39.019> you<00:02:39.380> know<00:02:39.670> forward

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
upside down these flex you know forward

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.520 
upside down these flex you know forward
backward<00:02:40.910> whoever<00:02:41.360> and<00:02:41.780> this<00:02:41.989> the<00:02:42.320> shock

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
backward whoever and this the shock

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.320 
backward whoever and this the shock
tower<00:02:42.739> itself<00:02:42.980> isn't<00:02:43.340> really<00:02:43.640> taking<00:02:44.000> much<00:02:44.180> of

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
tower itself isn't really taking much of

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.729 
tower itself isn't really taking much of
the<00:02:44.450> hit<00:02:44.660> ball<00:02:45.560> on<00:02:45.709> the<00:02:45.830> rear<00:02:47.290> it<00:02:48.290> connects

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
the hit ball on the rear it connects

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:50.560 
the hit ball on the rear it connects
straight<00:02:49.310> the<00:02:49.489> body<00:02:49.640> to<00:02:49.790> connect<00:02:50.120> straight<00:02:50.299> to

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
straight the body to connect straight to

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.680 
straight the body to connect straight to
the<00:02:50.890> shock<00:02:51.890> tower<00:02:52.130> so<00:02:52.459> when<00:02:53.030> you<00:02:53.120> land<00:02:53.330> on<00:02:53.450> that

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
the shock tower so when you land on that

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.000 
the shock tower so when you land on that
it's<00:02:54.590> gonna<00:02:54.860> really<00:02:55.100> force<00:02:55.430> it<00:02:55.640> so<00:02:56.470> RPM<00:02:57.470> hope

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
it's gonna really force it so RPM hope

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.180 
it's gonna really force it so RPM hope
you<00:02:58.130> do<00:02:58.220> the<00:02:58.370> job<00:02:58.610> for<00:02:58.640> me<00:02:59.049> um<00:03:00.049> when<00:03:00.860> the<00:03:00.890> silver

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
you do the job for me um when the silver

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.460 
you do the job for me um when the silver
one<00:03:01.310> comes<00:03:01.580> in<00:03:01.790> I<00:03:02.000> guess<00:03:02.720> I<00:03:02.840> might<00:03:02.959> put<00:03:03.170> that<00:03:03.320> on

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
one comes in I guess I might put that on

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.320 
one comes in I guess I might put that on
there<00:03:03.680> when<00:03:04.040> I<00:03:04.220> plan<00:03:04.430> on<00:03:04.580> not<00:03:04.730> driving<00:03:05.090> it<00:03:05.150> for

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
there when I plan on not driving it for

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.120 
there when I plan on not driving it for
a<00:03:05.360> while<00:03:05.480> so<00:03:06.260> it'll<00:03:06.350> be<00:03:06.410> kind<00:03:06.560> of<00:03:06.650> like<00:03:06.709> a<00:03:06.799> shelf

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
a while so it'll be kind of like a shelf

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
a while so it'll be kind of like a shelf
queen<00:03:08.260> but<00:03:09.260> for<00:03:10.010> Norma<00:03:10.250> bashing<00:03:10.400> this<00:03:11.000> is

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
queen but for Norma bashing this is

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.870 
queen but for Norma bashing this is
going<00:03:11.330> to<00:03:11.390> be<00:03:11.510> probably<00:03:12.290> the<00:03:12.380> new<00:03:12.590> one<00:03:12.880> okay

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
going to be probably the new one okay

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.610 
going to be probably the new one okay
now<00:03:14.209> for<00:03:14.540> this<00:03:14.660> new<00:03:14.930> castle<00:03:15.410> system<00:03:15.860> just

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
now for this new castle system just

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.309 
now for this new castle system just
and<00:03:16.799> that<00:03:16.980> up<00:03:17.190> first<00:03:18.150> time<00:03:18.390> opening<00:03:18.780> a<00:03:18.900> castle

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319 
and that up first time opening a castle

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:32.089 
and that up first time opening a castle
system<00:03:21.530> as<00:03:22.530> i<00:03:22.590> said<00:03:22.860> before<00:03:24.440> 5,700<00:03:25.440> JV<00:03:31.099> see

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:32.099 
system as i said before 5,700 JV see

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:36.559 
system as i said before 5,700 JV see
this<00:03:32.370> is<00:03:33.620> believed<00:03:34.620> the<00:03:34.769> motor<00:03:35.010> and<00:03:35.310> okay<00:03:35.909> this

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:36.569 
this is believed the motor and okay this

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:39.289 
this is believed the motor and okay this
is<00:03:36.629> probably<00:03:37.319> the<00:03:37.440> motor<00:03:37.769> hit<00:03:38.700> your<00:03:38.879> mother<00:03:39.090> on

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
is probably the motor hit your mother on

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:46.220 
is probably the motor hit your mother on
it<00:03:39.480> but<00:03:40.290> see<00:03:44.150> the<00:03:45.150> bottom<00:03:45.480> opens<00:03:45.780> up<00:03:45.930> just<00:03:45.959> like

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
it but see the bottom opens up just like

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:57.440 
it but see the bottom opens up just like
this<00:03:47.930> whoo<00:03:49.970> that's<00:03:50.970> a<00:03:51.239> beauty<00:03:55.370> just<00:03:56.370> pull<00:03:57.329> the

this whoo that's a beauty just pull the

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.569 
this whoo that's a beauty just pull the
whole<00:03:57.660> thing<00:03:57.690> up<00:03:58.109> wow<00:03:59.099> got<00:03:59.940> some<00:03:59.970> long

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:01.579 
whole thing up wow got some long

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:06.170 
whole thing up wow got some long
connector<00:04:02.579> wires<00:04:04.310> okay<00:04:05.310> and<00:04:05.549> in<00:04:05.730> this<00:04:05.909> box

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
connector wires okay and in this box

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:12.680 
connector wires okay and in this box
should<00:04:06.540> be<00:04:07.220> the<00:04:08.220> esc<00:04:11.060> got<00:04:12.060> my<00:04:12.180> manual

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
should be the esc got my manual

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.809 
should be the esc got my manual
hopefully<00:04:13.409> find<00:04:13.709> some<00:04:13.769> stickers<00:04:14.280> i<00:04:14.430> see<00:04:14.700> them

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:14.819 
hopefully find some stickers i see them

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:20.240 
hopefully find some stickers i see them
already<00:04:15.380> i<00:04:17.060> just<00:04:18.060> saw<00:04:18.239> them<00:04:18.889> who<00:04:19.889> knows<00:04:20.039> where

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
already i just saw them who knows where

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:29.800 
already i just saw them who knows where
they<00:04:20.340> went<00:04:20.370> i'll<00:04:20.970> look<00:04:21.180> for<00:04:21.359> those<00:04:21.450> later<00:04:28.490> and

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
they went i'll look for those later and

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.860 
they went i'll look for those later and
here's<00:04:30.810> everything<00:04:32.570> actually<00:04:33.570> I<00:04:33.599> thought

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
here's everything actually I thought

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.710 
here's everything actually I thought
this<00:04:33.990> esc<00:04:34.470> would<00:04:34.620> be<00:04:34.770> way<00:04:35.160> smaller<00:04:35.669> just<00:04:36.539> from

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
this esc would be way smaller just from

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.450 
this esc would be way smaller just from
what<00:04:36.750> I<00:04:37.139> have<00:04:37.349> seen<00:04:37.380> of<00:04:37.620> it<00:04:37.680> it's<00:04:38.130> actually<00:04:38.220> a

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
what I have seen of it it's actually a

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.219 
what I have seen of it it's actually a
pretty<00:04:38.490> good<00:04:38.760> size<00:04:39.120> or<00:04:39.599> looks<00:04:39.840> pretty<00:04:40.050> good

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:40.229 
pretty good size or looks pretty good

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:48.740 
pretty good size or looks pretty good
sized<00:04:41.270> um<00:04:42.590> screws<00:04:46.220> very<00:04:47.220> cool<00:04:47.430> very<00:04:47.750> cool

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.710 
sized um screws very cool very cool
on-off<00:04:49.320> switch<00:04:49.650> up<00:04:49.949> here<00:04:50.130> of<00:04:50.220> course<00:04:50.720> gonna

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
on-off switch up here of course gonna

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.270 
on-off switch up here of course gonna
have<00:04:51.840> to<00:04:51.960> solder<00:04:52.169> these<00:04:52.500> which<00:04:52.860> is<00:04:52.889> a<00:04:53.250> breeze

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280 
have to solder these which is a breeze

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:00.620 
have to solder these which is a breeze
very<00:04:56.280> cool<00:04:56.460> like<00:04:56.639> the<00:04:56.669> look<00:04:56.940> of<00:04:57.060> it<00:04:59.360> okay<00:05:00.360> now

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
very cool like the look of it okay now

very cool like the look of it okay now
if<00:05:00.900> you<00:05:01.080> are<00:05:01.229> thinking<00:05:01.430> this<00:05:02.430> is<00:05:02.639> maybe<00:05:02.910> too

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 
if you are thinking this is maybe too

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.550 
if you are thinking this is maybe too

high of a kv motor for the four by four
you're<00:05:07.560> probably<00:05:07.740> right<00:05:08.030> but<00:05:09.030> it's<00:05:09.210> not<00:05:09.270> for

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:09.570 
you're probably right but it's not for

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:11.629 
you're probably right but it's not for
the<00:05:09.660> four<00:05:09.840> by<00:05:09.960> four<00:05:10.199> this<00:05:10.889> system<00:05:11.099> will<00:05:11.490> be

00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:11.639 
the four by four this system will be

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:16.700 
the four by four this system will be
going<00:05:11.940> in<00:05:12.740> my<00:05:13.740> row<00:05:13.800> sir<00:05:14.039> I<00:05:14.960> chose<00:05:15.960> this<00:05:15.990> system

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:16.710 
going in my row sir I chose this system

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.330 
going in my row sir I chose this system
with<00:05:17.580> the<00:05:17.699> higher<00:05:17.880> kv<00:05:18.330> because<00:05:18.750> its<00:05:19.620> first<00:05:20.190> of

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.340 
with the higher kv because its first of

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:24.170 
with the higher kv because its first of
all<00:05:20.460> three<00:05:20.820> is<00:05:21.199> capable<00:05:22.199> so<00:05:22.849> maybe<00:05:23.849> get<00:05:24.030> some

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180 
all three is capable so maybe get some

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.890 
all three is capable so maybe get some
higher<00:05:24.360> speed<00:05:24.659> runs<00:05:24.900> with<00:05:25.830> the<00:05:25.979> 4-pole<00:05:26.219> motor

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:26.900 
higher speed runs with the 4-pole motor

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:29.810 
higher speed runs with the 4-pole motor
5,700<00:05:27.900> kv<00:05:28.289> i<00:05:28.469> should<00:05:29.219> be<00:05:29.370> hitting<00:05:29.580> higher

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:29.820 
5,700 kv i should be hitting higher

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:30.150 
5,700 kv i should be hitting higher
number

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.160

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.120 
number
with<00:05:30.370> that<00:05:30.580> and<00:05:30.870> gear<00:05:31.870> down<00:05:32.050> low<00:05:32.380> they<00:05:32.890> should

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:33.130 
with that and gear down low they should

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:36.960 
with that and gear down low they should
work<00:05:33.430> pretty<00:05:33.670> well<00:05:33.820> as<00:05:34.060> a<00:05:34.120> basher<00:05:34.510> also<00:05:35.280> so<00:05:36.280> the

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:36.970 
work pretty well as a basher also so the

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:38.820 
work pretty well as a basher also so the
motor<00:05:37.180> from<00:05:37.570> the<00:05:37.960> Rustler<00:05:38.260> will<00:05:38.500> be<00:05:38.620> going

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:38.830 
motor from the Rustler will be going

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.880 
motor from the Rustler will be going
into<00:05:38.950> the<00:05:39.190> four-by-four<00:05:39.520> /<00:05:40.000> and<00:05:40.860> same<00:05:41.860> with

the ESC now earlier i had quick for you

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:53.550 
the ESC now earlier i had quick for you
suggested<00:05:49.480> this<00:05:49.810> 3m<00:05:50.790> double-sided<00:05:51.790> tape<00:05:52.560> it's
