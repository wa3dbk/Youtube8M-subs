00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
but in terms with competing with

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.250 
but in terms with competing with
Microsoft<00:02:33.490> and<00:02:33.790> Sony<00:02:34.180> I<00:02:34.540> don't<00:02:34.720> really<00:02:35.050> think

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
Microsoft and Sony I don't really think

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.990 
Microsoft and Sony I don't really think
there's<00:02:35.470> so<00:02:35.770> much<00:02:35.890> interested<00:02:36.370> in<00:02:36.610> that

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
there's so much interested in that

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.700

microsoft and sony are competing with
each<00:02:38.740> other<00:02:39.040> and<00:02:39.400> I<00:02:39.910> think<00:02:39.940> whatever<00:02:40.480> console

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
each other and I think whatever console

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
pretty much all my time playing the

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.770

think<00:03:19.920> Nintendo<00:03:20.920> for<00:03:21.190> the<00:03:21.250> most<00:03:21.430> part<00:03:21.700> knows

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
think Nintendo for the most part knows

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.380 
think Nintendo for the most part knows
what<00:03:22.330> they're<00:03:22.540> doing<00:03:22.720> and<00:03:23.080> I<00:03:23.890> think<00:03:24.310> they<00:03:24.730> even

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
what they're doing and I think they even

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.840 
what they're doing and I think they even
though<00:03:25.630> they've<00:03:25.810> been<00:03:25.960> hurting<00:03:26.350> in<00:03:26.550> 2010<00:03:27.550> I

though they've been hurting in 2010 I

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.630 
though they've been hurting in 2010 I
think<00:03:28.510> they<00:03:28.690> have<00:03:28.870> the<00:03:29.080> resources<00:03:29.680> to<00:03:30.070> make<00:03:30.610> a

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
better than the playstation 3 and xbox

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.710 
better than the playstation 3 and xbox
360<00:04:06.040> a<00:04:06.310> lot<00:04:06.670> of<00:04:06.760> people<00:04:07.000> think<00:04:07.180> that's<00:04:07.420> a<00:04:07.540> bad

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
360 a lot of people think that's a bad

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.050 
360 a lot of people think that's a bad
move<00:04:08.050> but<00:04:08.680> in<00:04:08.800> my<00:04:08.950> opinion<00:04:09.100> it<00:04:09.550> might<00:04:09.730> be<00:04:09.910> the

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
move but in my opinion it might be the

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.270 
move but in my opinion it might be the
right<00:04:10.240> move<00:04:10.540> and<00:04:10.840> why<00:04:11.230> i<00:04:11.260> think<00:04:11.740> that<00:04:12.010> is

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
right move and why i think that is

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.240 
right move and why i think that is
because<00:04:13.240> to<00:04:13.600> have<00:04:13.780> the<00:04:13.990> biggest<00:04:14.290> baddest

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
because to have the biggest baddest

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.580 
because to have the biggest baddest
graphics<00:04:15.880> card<00:04:16.210> in<00:04:16.450> your<00:04:16.630> console<00:04:17.140> it's<00:04:17.380> going

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
graphics card in your console it's going

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.380 
graphics card in your console it's going
to<00:04:17.680> cost<00:04:17.859> money<00:04:18.190> it's<00:04:18.430> going<00:04:18.549> to<00:04:18.609> cost<00:04:18.790> a<00:04:19.060> lot

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:19.390 
to cost money it's going to cost a lot

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:21.240 
to cost money it's going to cost a lot
more<00:04:19.450> money<00:04:19.930> than<00:04:20.229> if<00:04:20.710> you're<00:04:20.859> going<00:04:21.040> to<00:04:21.100> take

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
more money than if you're going to take

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.550 
more money than if you're going to take
a<00:04:21.280> graphics<00:04:21.729> card<00:04:21.790> from<00:04:22.630> an<00:04:22.750> older<00:04:23.080> console<00:04:23.500> i

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
a graphics card from an older console i

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:24.610 
a graphics card from an older console i
think<00:04:23.800> nintendo

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
think nintendo

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.350 
think nintendo
yeah<00:04:25.220> they<00:04:25.490> could<00:04:25.669> have<00:04:25.850> a<00:04:25.880> much<00:04:26.090> more

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
yeah they could have a much more

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.390 
yeah they could have a much more
powerful<00:04:26.600> console<00:04:27.380> but<00:04:27.650> they<00:04:27.830> I<00:04:27.860> think<00:04:28.100> they

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
powerful console but they I think they

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.180 
powerful console but they I think they
want<00:04:28.729> to<00:04:28.880> make<00:04:29.150> it<00:04:29.360> most<00:04:30.229> affordable<00:04:30.919> and<00:04:31.100> I

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190 
want to make it most affordable and I

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.610 
want to make it most affordable and I
think<00:04:31.490> that's<00:04:31.910> one<00:04:32.300> of<00:04:32.330> the<00:04:32.479> main<00:04:33.050> reasons

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:33.620 
think that's one of the main reasons

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.320 
think that's one of the main reasons
there's<00:04:33.830> a<00:04:33.889> lot<00:04:34.070> of<00:04:34.100> reasons<00:04:34.639> why<00:04:34.850> maybe<00:04:35.150> the

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
there's a lot of reasons why maybe the

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.030 
there's a lot of reasons why maybe the
nintendo<00:04:35.780> wii<00:04:35.810> was<00:04:36.199> successful<00:04:36.830> or

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.040 
nintendo wii was successful or

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:41.590 
nintendo wii was successful or
successful<00:04:38.080> but<00:04:39.080> i<00:04:39.139> think<00:04:39.470> that<00:04:39.820> because<00:04:40.820> it

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600 
successful but i think that because it

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.050 
successful but i think that because it
was<00:04:41.840> kept<00:04:42.229> i<00:04:42.470> think<00:04:42.680> the<00:04:42.770> price<00:04:43.040> point<00:04:43.400> was<00:04:43.729> was

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
was kept i think the price point was was

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.450 
was kept i think the price point was was
great<00:04:44.389> two<00:04:45.260> hundred<00:04:45.500> fifty<00:04:45.590> dollars<00:04:46.130> no<00:04:46.310> its

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
great two hundred fifty dollars no its

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.520 
great two hundred fifty dollars no its
dropped<00:04:46.760> since<00:04:47.090> when<00:04:47.570> it<00:04:47.660> was<00:04:47.780> first<00:04:48.020> launched

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530 
dropped since when it was first launched

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:51.700 
dropped since when it was first launched
but<00:04:49.460> it<00:04:49.520> was<00:04:49.610> set<00:04:49.820> at<00:04:50.000> a<00:04:50.030> price<00:04:50.419> that<00:04:50.870> a<00:04:51.290> lot<00:04:51.680> of

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
but it was set at a price that a lot of

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:53.680 
but it was set at a price that a lot of
people<00:04:51.830> could<00:04:52.280> afford<00:04:52.400> it<00:04:52.820> go<00:04:53.240> out<00:04:53.389> and<00:04:53.419> pick

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:53.690 
people could afford it go out and pick

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:55.780 
people could afford it go out and pick
one<00:04:53.720> up<00:04:53.930> and<00:04:54.560> I<00:04:54.650> think<00:04:54.889> that<00:04:55.010> really<00:04:55.040> helped<00:04:55.669> I

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:55.790 
one up and I think that really helped I

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:57.820 
one up and I think that really helped I
think<00:04:56.150> having<00:04:56.449> when<00:04:56.960> the<00:04:57.050> PlayStation<00:04:57.650> 3

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 
think having when the PlayStation 3

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:59.580 
think having when the PlayStation 3
first<00:04:58.160> launched<00:04:58.610> at<00:04:58.729> six<00:04:59.120> hundred<00:04:59.539> dollars

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
first launched at six hundred dollars

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:02.770 
first launched at six hundred dollars
you<00:05:00.590> know<00:05:00.770> only<00:05:01.070> the<00:05:01.400> super<00:05:01.910> hardcore<00:05:02.210> went

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:02.780 
you know only the super hardcore went

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:04.150 
you know only the super hardcore went
out<00:05:02.870> and<00:05:03.020> got<00:05:03.110> her<00:05:03.260> those<00:05:03.500> who<00:05:03.680> had<00:05:03.860> a<00:05:03.889> lot<00:05:04.130> of

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 
out and got her those who had a lot of

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.070 
out and got her those who had a lot of
disposable<00:05:04.610> income<00:05:04.970> went<00:05:05.389> out<00:05:05.479> and<00:05:05.660> got<00:05:05.750> it<00:05:05.930> I

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 
disposable income went out and got it I

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.810 
disposable income went out and got it I
think<00:05:06.500> Nintendo<00:05:06.860> with<00:05:06.979> their<00:05:07.130> next<00:05:07.370> console

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:07.820 
think Nintendo with their next console

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:09.939 
think Nintendo with their next console
