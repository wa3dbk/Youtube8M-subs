00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
grenades there so yeah they must have

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:50.180 
grenades there so yeah they must have
communicated<00:02:49.470> that<00:02:49.590> beforehand<00:02:50.040> because

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
communicated that beforehand because

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.770 
communicated that beforehand because
probably<00:02:50.700> had<00:02:50.940> about<00:02:51.000> seven<00:02:51.420> or<00:02:51.480> eight<00:02:51.630> of

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
probably had about seven or eight of

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.630 
probably had about seven or eight of
them<00:02:51.900> right<00:02:52.560> off<00:02:52.620> the<00:02:52.890> bat<00:02:53.040> of<00:02:53.070> a<00:02:53.280> ground<00:02:53.489> war

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
them right off the bat of a ground war

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.250 
them right off the bat of a ground war
game<00:02:53.820> dislodge<00:02:54.180> the<00:02:54.330> new<00:02:54.480> tubes<00:02:54.720> and<00:02:54.989> it<00:02:55.110> was<00:02:55.200> a

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
game dislodge the new tubes and it was a

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.810 
game dislodge the new tubes and it was a
domination<00:02:55.650> game<00:02:55.830> so<00:02:56.070> we<00:02:56.160> could<00:02:56.310> even<00:02:56.459> capture

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
domination game so we could even capture

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.340 
domination game so we could even capture
our<00:02:56.850> first<00:02:57.120> point<00:02:57.330> so<00:02:57.660> they<00:02:57.810> captured<00:02:58.230> their

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
our first point so they captured their

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.949 
our first point so they captured their
first<00:02:58.380> two<00:02:58.709> points<00:02:58.980> very<00:02:59.190> quickly<00:02:59.430> and<00:03:00.269> we

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
first two points very quickly and we

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:02.780 
first two points very quickly and we
just<00:03:01.170> create<00:03:01.739> a<00:03:01.800> hell<00:03:01.980> of<00:03:02.010> a<00:03:02.130> time<00:03:02.160> trying<00:03:02.670> to

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
just create a hell of a time trying to

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.670 
just create a hell of a time trying to
get<00:03:02.970> him<00:03:03.090> in<00:03:03.180> one<00:03:03.360> point<00:03:03.600> so<00:03:03.900> it<00:03:04.350> was<00:03:04.500> pretty

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
get him in one point so it was pretty

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.170 
get him in one point so it was pretty
funny<00:03:04.980> but<00:03:05.160> that<00:03:05.489> you<00:03:05.670> know<00:03:05.760> that<00:03:05.940> shouldn't

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
funny but that you know that shouldn't

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.570 
funny but that you know that shouldn't
be<00:03:06.239> able<00:03:06.300> to<00:03:06.420> happen<00:03:06.600> I<00:03:06.810> think<00:03:07.400> except<00:03:08.400> for

people want to see huge changes from
game<00:04:26.729> to<00:04:26.760> game<00:04:26.940> and<00:04:27.240> I

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
game to game and I

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.070 
game to game and I
I don't<00:04:27.729> necessarily<00:04:27.880> understand<00:04:28.600> that<00:04:28.780> idea

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
I don't necessarily understand that idea

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.590 
I don't necessarily understand that idea
because<00:04:29.770> it's<00:04:29.919> it's<00:04:30.100> a<00:04:30.280> it's<00:04:30.490> tall<00:04:31.090> duty<00:04:31.479> you

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 
because it's it's a it's tall duty you

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.330 
because it's it's a it's tall duty you
know<00:04:31.960> what<00:04:32.080> to<00:04:32.169> expect<00:04:32.199> from<00:04:32.710> it<00:04:32.800> and<00:04:33.040> I<00:04:33.130> think

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
know what to expect from it and I think

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.370 
know what to expect from it and I think
that's<00:04:33.520> what<00:04:33.699> keeps<00:04:33.880> people<00:04:34.150> coming<00:04:34.660> back<00:04:34.930> to

that's what keeps people coming back to
it<00:04:35.530> because<00:04:36.310> you<00:04:36.520> know<00:04:36.669> it's<00:04:36.880> gonna<00:04:37.000> be<00:04:37.180> it's

team-oriented<00:05:28.479> gameplay<00:05:28.960> with<00:05:29.169> like<00:05:29.349> how

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:29.500 
team-oriented gameplay with like how

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:30.870 
team-oriented gameplay with like how
they're<00:05:29.680> setting<00:05:29.949> up<00:05:30.039> classes<00:05:30.490> where<00:05:30.669> you<00:05:30.759> can

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:30.880 
they're setting up classes where you can

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.060 
they're setting up classes where you can
have<00:05:30.970> like<00:05:31.090> a<00:05:31.180> support<00:05:31.539> class<00:05:31.660> where<00:05:32.560> you<00:05:32.710> get

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:33.070 
have like a support class where you get

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:34.379 
have like a support class where you get
more<00:05:33.190> points<00:05:33.370> for<00:05:33.610> doing<00:05:33.669> objective<00:05:34.180> based

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:34.389 
more points for doing objective based

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:35.640 
more points for doing objective based
things<00:05:34.630> but<00:05:34.810> they<00:05:34.900> need<00:05:35.050> to<00:05:35.080> do<00:05:35.260> a<00:05:35.289> little<00:05:35.440> bit

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:35.650 
things but they need to do a little bit

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:36.810 
things but they need to do a little bit
more<00:05:35.830> because<00:05:35.919> i<00:05:36.130> think<00:05:36.190> their<00:05:36.400> assault<00:05:36.699> class

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:36.820 
more because i think their assault class

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:39.270 
more because i think their assault class
is<00:05:37.030> still<00:05:37.180> completely<00:05:37.389> based<00:05:37.870> on<00:05:38.080> kills<00:05:38.349> so<00:05:39.250> I

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:39.280 
is still completely based on kills so I

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.159 
is still completely based on kills so I
don't<00:05:39.820> need<00:05:39.940> I<00:05:40.240> don't<00:05:40.300> need<00:05:40.570> to<00:05:40.750> see<00:05:40.900> like<00:05:41.050> this

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:41.169 
don't need I don't need to see like this

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:43.170 
don't need I don't need to see like this
huge<00:05:41.440> transition<00:05:41.830> there's<00:05:42.430> a<00:05:42.550> force<00:05:42.880> you<00:05:43.060> to

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:43.180 
huge transition there's a force you to

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:45.330 
huge transition there's a force you to
play<00:05:43.330> as<00:05:43.479> a<00:05:43.510> team<00:05:43.599> but<00:05:44.039> incentivizing<00:05:45.039> it<00:05:45.130> just

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:45.340 
play as a team but incentivizing it just

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:47.089 
play as a team but incentivizing it just
a<00:05:45.430> tiny<00:05:45.639> bit<00:05:45.789> more<00:05:46.030> would<00:05:46.210> be<00:05:46.240> kind<00:05:46.539> of<00:05:46.570> nice

00:05:47.089 --> 00:05:47.099 
a tiny bit more would be kind of nice

00:05:47.099 --> 00:05:49.110 
a tiny bit more would be kind of nice
but<00:05:48.099> there<00:05:48.430> are<00:05:48.460> starting<00:05:48.789> to<00:05:48.820> move<00:05:48.940> in<00:05:49.060> that

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:49.120 
but there are starting to move in that

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.060 
but there are starting to move in that
direction<00:05:49.210> a<00:05:49.599> little<00:05:49.630> bit<00:05:49.930> but<00:05:50.080> so<00:05:50.289> we'll<00:05:50.979> have

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:51.070 
direction a little bit but so we'll have

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:52.950 
direction a little bit but so we'll have
to<00:05:51.220> see<00:05:51.510> we'll<00:05:52.510> have<00:05:52.630> to<00:05:52.720> see<00:05:52.840> what<00:05:52.900> happens

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:52.960 
to see we'll have to see what happens

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.510 
to see we'll have to see what happens
