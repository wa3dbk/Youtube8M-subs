00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 but to all the guys here with us 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.440
 here today with a new video after quite a while 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:10.380
 some time on how to download sherlock 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:13.530
 crime punishment holmes or crimes 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:16.230
 enforcement in English for computers and in 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.080
 Italian clearly before starting 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.359
 I just wanted to apologize for the absence 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.619
 mar did not have particularly that is 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.420
 I didn't find games passively 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.340
 interesting to download for you 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.410
 see therefore is also not received 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.970
 your requests and then I left a 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.410
 lose the cause so that now 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.840
 some games are starting to come out 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.700
 new and by the way actually I don't 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.420
 I wanted to start over with this 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:43.079
 tutorial here but with fifa 15 first and 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:45.149
 then the shadow of mordor however the 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.590
 problem even fiva 15 is not yet 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.350
 exit from crack 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.789
 so I downloaded the files but until 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.960
 the unseen crack does not arrive and also to 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.890
 propose the video because it would be a 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.680
 video here I show where 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.120
 download it and then turn your thumbs around because 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.590
 you can't do anything with those files 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.449
 until you have claque the crack 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.520
 then the days when the claque will come out 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.710
 I keep checking when it comes out 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.339
 I will make the video on fa 15 to be able to 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.990
 use 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:12.630
 and when instead I will finish downloading as 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.119
 you can see the shadow of mordor I will make you 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.130
 the video but also this is 34 giga e 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.970
 when the speed is very fast I go 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:24.210
 at 20 kilowatts when normally 0.2 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:27.150
 kilobytes per second so it will take 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.700
 I really apologize for really long 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.130
 also for this reason I searched for 1800 sites 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.720
 different with which to download it also tried 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.799
 use down downloader i tried to 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:40.500
 use different things but not really 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:42.210
 it always works very slow therefore also 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.710
 for this when I can finish 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.950
 download it I will show you the video for 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.720
 how to make it work and that's it 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.380
 now instead we return to our video 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.729
 ie sherlock holmes crime punishment 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.710
 it is very simple we simply have to 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.439
 go to this site that will put them in 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:01.320
 description and download either from here or from 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:03.990
 here the torrent sherlock holmes file 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:07.110
 punishment crime by burgos when you 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.910
 you download it you need a client 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.630
 torrent 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:13.930
 if you have not put utorrent 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:16.510
 direction you simply want to open it e 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:19.210
 as you can see it will start to download here 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.220
 the file also these realities are 6 gb and 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:22.480
 74 but is quite slow then in 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.000
 actually it will take a while for you too 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:29.080
 But this fact is less heavy has 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.330
 so it won't take too long like 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.670
 for the finished morton shadow of 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:37.480
 download it double click on the file e 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:39.100
 click continue you will have these files 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.400
 I am simply interested in reality 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:44.770
 these two fires remain to be exact 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.590
 we simply have to select 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:50.050
 do this here the application of 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.780
 sherlock holmes crimes do right click 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:56.980
 run as an administrator to do 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:58.060
 starting the installation of the 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.760
 game 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:03.400
 ok so as you can see this is the 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.620
 our installation program 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:09.190
 here we can choose where to install 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:12.310
 the game of presets will be there 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:15.340
 folder games, but I put it instead 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:18.040
 up 7 by clicking on the browser 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:21.130
 I put it on the local disk computer ce 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:23.560
 program 3 86 and then click ok 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.540
 and you will make the folder fun 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.040
 at this point click on install e 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.100
 away the installation will start I don't 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:33.190
 I do it because I have already installed the game 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:35.320
 when it finishes the installation it will create you 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.760
 a couple of pages will open up 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:41.140
 internet that you can close 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:42.940
 quietly plus an Umbrian command 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.880
 that more or less is a lanera window 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.140
 these dimensions with written press ok 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.730
 to continue pressing a key 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.840
 any to continue the work of a 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.070
 button also closes with the 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.840
 screen opens another page 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:53.760
 internet also close that much not 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.050
 it's important 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.880
 at this point what we have to do 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:02.260
 to start the game go to disk 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:05.560
 local c programs for 86 sherlock 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.970
 holmes cranes pone spence or where it was 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.430
 you clearly if you have installed on 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.530
 games go on games and there will be 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.510
 all these these applications for 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.340
 get it started 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:17.200
 clearly if you want it in English 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:20.799
 do this in French this 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:24.539
 German this Italian Russian and Spanish 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:27.430
 I advise you to use Italian 

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:32.410
 we are in Italy so faces do the 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:34.300
 right click properties compatibility e 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:36.940
 if this program as an administrator 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:39.160
 apply ok 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:41.740
 and then another advice but free to 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:44.800
 don't do it in the desktop that it was 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:47.110
 link so when you want to do it 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:50.979
 You already have it here and you can leave 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:54.370
 also rename it as you like like 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:57.789
 sherlock holmes for example done this 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:59.410
 you click and the game will start putting us 

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:01.479
 a moment to load but I assure you that 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:03.460
 for it works perfectly and is Italian 

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:05.860
 the only thing is that every time 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:07.349
 you will start you will create a file here 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:10.509
 on the desktop 

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:12.639
 actually absolutely minute i think 

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:15.310
 both of a kilobyte with something written 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:17.139
 no steam is absolutely not useful that 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:18.849
 file so each is a little awkward but each 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:21.099
 time in case it catches you and veil 

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:24.250
 drag in the trash can you eliminate so much 

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:26.380
 it is not not useful said this i 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:28.419
 tutorial finished the game and how I have you 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:30.580
 said he does not need to crack does not have 

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:33.460
 need of nothing works is in Italian 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:35.949
 only the texts because they are the menu and i 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:37.870
 dialogues because you do not excuse not i 

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:40.060
 dialogue the subtitles because the dialogues 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:42.190
 I'm in English but that's how he did it 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.810
 so the game cannot be played 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:46.150
 nothing 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:47.710
 so I invite you to leave a like one 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:49.599
 write a comment if you have 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:53.050
 some problems and I will try to help you 

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:58.780
 or if you have any idea of â€‹â€‹any game 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:06:02.139
 that you'd like to see cracked by me 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:04.449
 so that you can just use it 

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:06.130
 I 'll wait for you at a next video 

00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:09.130
 which I hope is on mordor's pain e 

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:11.620
 I hope it is not, however, among those eight months 

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:15.030
 the pure cafe knows it all at the 

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:15.030
 next nice video guys
