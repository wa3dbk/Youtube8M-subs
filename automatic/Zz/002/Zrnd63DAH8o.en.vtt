hey<00:01:01.770> baby

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
hey baby

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.310 
hey baby
power<00:01:02.699> particle<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.480> you<00:01:03.539> are<00:01:03.840> a<00:01:03.870> quantum

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
power particle and you are a quantum

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.350 
power particle and you are a quantum
potential<00:01:04.670> would<00:01:05.670> you<00:01:05.790> let<00:01:06.000> me<00:01:06.030> penetrate

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
potential would you let me penetrate

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.359 
potential would you let me penetrate
your<00:01:06.810> classically<00:01:07.320> forbidden<00:01:07.530> regions<00:01:08.130> baby

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
your classically forbidden regions baby

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.160 
your classically forbidden regions baby
I<00:01:08.490> wish<00:01:08.729> I<00:01:08.880> was<00:01:09.030> your<00:01:09.180> derivative<00:01:09.510> so<00:01:09.900> I<00:01:09.930> can

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
I wish I was your derivative so I can

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.260 
I wish I was your derivative so I can
lie<00:01:10.320> tangent<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:11.040> your<00:01:11.189> curves<00:01:11.580> I'm<00:01:12.000> in<00:01:12.240> a

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
lie tangent to your curves I'm in a

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.490 
lie tangent to your curves I'm in a
chemistry<00:01:12.630> major<00:01:12.780> I<00:01:12.930> can<00:01:13.080> assure<00:01:13.170> you<00:01:13.320> that

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
chemistry major I can assure you that

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.660 
chemistry major I can assure you that
this<00:01:13.619> is<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.830> only<00:01:13.950> one<00:01:14.070> that<00:01:14.130> actually<00:01:14.220> works

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
this is the only one that actually works

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.490 
this is the only one that actually works
um<00:01:14.909> hey<00:01:15.689> does<00:01:15.840> this<00:01:15.960> smell<00:01:16.049> like<00:01:16.200> chloroform

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
um hey does this smell like chloroform

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.109 
um hey does this smell like chloroform
yeah<00:01:17.009> that<00:01:17.189> might<00:01:17.310> have<00:01:17.400> gone<00:01:17.520> too<00:01:17.700> far

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
yeah that might have gone too far

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.249 
yeah that might have gone too far
hey<00:01:18.210> baby<00:01:18.509> why<00:01:18.600> don't<00:01:18.659> we<00:01:18.810> go<00:01:18.900> back<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.110> my

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
hey baby why don't we go back to my

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.749 
hey baby why don't we go back to my
place<00:01:19.470> and<00:01:19.530> I<00:01:19.710> can<00:01:19.860> show<00:01:20.040> you<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.280> exponential

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
place and I can show you the exponential

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.880 
place and I can show you the exponential
growth<00:01:20.939> of<00:01:21.000> my<00:01:21.270> natural<00:01:21.509> log<00:01:21.990> nerdy<00:01:22.500> pick-up

lines and here man walks into a bar
since<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.409> bar<00:01:25.590> should<00:01:25.740> give<00:01:26.040> me<00:01:26.220> ten<00:01:26.549> times

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
since the bar should give me ten times
