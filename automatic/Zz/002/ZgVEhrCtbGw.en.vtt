two purposes one you can use it on the

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:44.809 
two purposes one you can use it on the
hanger<00:02:39.349> like<00:02:40.349> Sol<00:02:42.470> now<00:02:43.470> the<00:02:43.530> ants<00:02:43.859> they<00:02:44.370> come

down and they can't cross the barrier of
water<00:02:48.239> to<00:02:48.900> get<00:02:49.049> to<00:02:49.260> your<00:02:49.379> feeder<00:02:49.680> or<00:02:50.150> you<00:02:51.150> can

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329 
water to get to your feeder or you can

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:54.680 
water to get to your feeder or you can
use<00:02:51.540> the<00:02:51.720> same<00:02:52.019> part<00:02:52.409> and<00:02:53.389> put<00:02:54.389> it<00:02:54.480> on<00:02:54.659> a

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
use the same part and put it on a

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.649 
use the same part and put it on a
one-inch<00:02:55.170> hole<00:02:55.489> this<00:02:56.489> ant<00:02:56.760> is<00:02:56.940> great<00:02:57.389> for

00:02:57.649 --> 00:02:57.659 
one-inch hole this ant is great for

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:02.780 
one-inch hole this ant is great for

00:03:06.649 --> 00:03:06.659 
climb up the pole and get to the nectar

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:08.930 
climb up the pole and get to the nectar
because<00:03:07.049> the<00:03:07.200> barrier<00:03:07.680> of<00:03:07.799> water<00:03:08.280> prevents
