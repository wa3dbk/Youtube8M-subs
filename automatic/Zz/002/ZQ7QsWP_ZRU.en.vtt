just you just let me Wheaton it but so

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.410 
just you just let me Wheaton it but so
that's<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.040> gardening<00:01:53.430> room<00:01:53.640> not<00:01:54.000> much<00:01:54.149> too<00:01:54.390> i

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
that's the gardening room not much too i

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.179 
that's the gardening room not much too i
built<00:01:54.750> some<00:01:54.899> flowers<00:01:55.290> down<00:01:55.439> there<00:01:56.899> and<00:01:57.899> i<00:01:58.229> have

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
built some flowers down there and i have

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.429 
built some flowers down there and i have
a<00:01:59.219> furnace<00:02:00.210> specifically<00:02:00.780> for<00:02:00.960> bread<00:02:01.200> so<00:02:01.409> I

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
a furnace specifically for bread so I

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.850 
a furnace specifically for bread so I
can<00:02:01.590> cook<00:02:01.710> wheat<00:02:01.950> in<00:02:02.100> it<00:02:03.560> but<00:02:04.560> then<00:02:04.770> I

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
can cook wheat in it but then I

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.310 
can cook wheat in it but then I
remembered<00:02:05.310> that<00:02:05.549> we<00:02:05.759> you<00:02:06.090> don't<00:02:06.299> cook<00:02:06.509> we<00:02:06.659> you

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
remembered that we you don't cook we you

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.369 
remembered that we you don't cook we you
make<00:02:07.560> it<00:02:08.450> so<00:02:09.450> that's<00:02:09.599> useless<00:02:09.780> word<00:02:10.110> that<00:02:10.259> we

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
make it so that's useless word that we

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.710 
make it so that's useless word that we
go<00:02:10.560> there

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
go there

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.170 
go there
oh<00:02:13.010> there<00:02:14.010> later<00:02:14.250> this<00:02:14.340> is<00:02:14.580> the<00:02:14.670> first<00:02:14.910> I've

when<00:02:15.420> i<00:02:15.450> first<00:02:15.660> started<00:02:15.900> mining<00:02:16.110> i<00:02:16.350> built<00:02:16.560> this

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
when i first started mining i built this

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.450 
when i first started mining i built this
little<00:02:16.920> spiral<00:02:17.310> staircase<00:02:18.890> which<00:02:19.890> turned<00:02:20.340> out

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
little spiral staircase which turned out

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.550 
little spiral staircase which turned out
to<00:02:20.520> be<00:02:20.760> just<00:02:20.910> one<00:02:21.090> my<00:02:21.180> hallways<00:02:21.540> I<00:02:21.870> place<00:02:22.440> is

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
off-limits because I dug really deep

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.670 
off-limits because I dug really deep
hole<00:02:25.440> in<00:02:25.590> there<00:02:25.800> and<00:02:26.690> got<00:02:27.690> lost<00:02:27.900> so<00:02:28.470> I<00:02:28.530> just

hole in there and got lost so I just

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.800 
hole in there and got lost so I just
kept<00:02:28.890> digging<00:02:29.040> and<00:02:29.370> I<00:02:29.880> was<00:02:30.000> really<00:02:30.330> lost<00:02:30.540> my

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
area is my like armory so this is where

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.520 
area is my like armory so this is where
I<00:02:47.340> keep<00:02:47.580> all<00:02:47.760> the<00:02:47.880> weapons<00:02:48.180> that<00:02:48.330> broke<00:02:48.600> or

like a meteor hit or something like that
and<00:03:46.500> I<00:03:47.430> made<00:03:48.269> some<00:03:48.420> new<00:03:48.540> site<00:03:48.750> into<00:03:49.110> a<00:03:49.140> furnace

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
and I made some new site into a furnace

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:50.930 
and I made some new site into a furnace
room<00:03:49.560> I<00:03:49.830> don't<00:03:50.250> think<00:03:50.280> there's<00:03:50.519> anything<00:03:50.730> over

forbidden place really quick and show
you<00:04:01.170> one<00:04:01.410> of<00:04:01.440> my<00:04:01.530> service<00:04:01.950> tunnels<00:04:02.340> that<00:04:02.459> goes

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
you one of my service tunnels that goes

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.539 
you one of my service tunnels that goes
to<00:04:03.000> a<00:04:03.420> place<00:04:03.870> that<00:04:04.019> I<00:04:04.049> used<00:04:04.260> to<00:04:04.350> mind<00:04:04.620> if<00:04:05.430> I

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:05.549 
to a place that I used to mind if I

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:08.360 
to a place that I used to mind if I
don't<00:04:05.760> anymore<00:04:05.940> I<00:04:06.090> don't<00:04:06.269> know<00:04:06.330> why<00:04:07.220> so<00:04:08.220> that's

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
don't anymore I don't know why so that's

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.850 
don't anymore I don't know why so that's
the<00:04:08.549> faghole<00:04:08.970> that<00:04:09.269> would<00:04:09.390> go<00:04:09.540> to<00:04:09.680> the<00:04:10.680> ghosts

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 
the faghole that would go to the ghosts

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.410 
the faghole that would go to the ghosts
under<00:04:11.160> and<00:04:11.310> legs<00:04:11.459> all<00:04:11.640> flooded<00:04:11.910> now<00:04:12.120> in<00:04:12.330> it

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
under and legs all flooded now in it

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.610 
under and legs all flooded now in it
when<00:04:12.900> the<00:04:12.959> water<00:04:13.140> came<00:04:13.380> it<00:04:13.560> broke<00:04:14.040> all<00:04:14.220> my

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
when the water came it broke all my

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.930 
when the water came it broke all my
torches<00:04:16.620> so<00:04:16.769> it's<00:04:16.919> pitch-black<00:04:17.280> down<00:04:17.700> there

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
torches so it's pitch-black down there

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.409 
torches so it's pitch-black down there
and<00:04:18.269> one<00:04:19.080> of<00:04:19.229> these<00:04:19.350> tunnels<00:04:19.859> will<00:04:19.979> go<00:04:20.100> to<00:04:20.419> the

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
and one of these tunnels will go to the

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:22.820 
and one of these tunnels will go to the
underground<00:04:21.720> mine<00:04:22.080> that<00:04:22.410> has<00:04:22.530> all<00:04:22.740> the

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
underground mine that has all the

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.450 
underground mine that has all the
resources<00:04:22.950> that<00:04:23.370> i<00:04:23.610> was<00:04:23.729> getting

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
resources that i was getting

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.570 
resources that i was getting
I<00:04:24.520> thing<00:04:25.030> at<00:04:25.120> this<00:04:25.270> one<00:04:25.479> this<00:04:26.160> time<00:04:27.160> I'm<00:04:27.370> pretty

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
I thing at this one this time I'm pretty

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:28.980 
I thing at this one this time I'm pretty
much<00:04:27.669> gone<00:04:27.819> from<00:04:28.060> one<00:04:28.240> mountain<00:04:28.569> to<00:04:28.720> another

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
much gone from one mountain to another

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:30.900 
much gone from one mountain to another
because<00:04:29.560> I<00:04:29.770> originally<00:04:30.400> went<00:04:30.699> to<00:04:30.789> that

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:30.910 
because I originally went to that

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:32.070 
because I originally went to that
mountain<00:04:31.090> on<00:04:31.270> the<00:04:31.389> surface<00:04:31.720> and<00:04:31.960> then<00:04:32.050> I

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
mountain on the surface and then I

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.510 
mountain on the surface and then I
decided<00:04:32.410> be<00:04:32.620> better<00:04:32.860> to<00:04:33.009> have<00:04:33.069> an<00:04:33.220> underground

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
decided be better to have an underground

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.270 
decided be better to have an underground
tunnel<00:04:33.729> and<00:04:34.090> as<00:04:34.870> I<00:04:35.050> built<00:04:35.710> in<00:04:35.860> here<00:04:36.039> on<00:04:36.099> time<00:04:36.220> I

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 
tunnel and as I built in here on time I

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:37.529 
tunnel and as I built in here on time I
found<00:04:36.550> a<00:04:36.610> bunch<00:04:36.729> of<00:04:36.819> resources<00:04:37.090> that's<00:04:37.389> why

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:37.539 
found a bunch of resources that's why

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:40.740 
found a bunch of resources that's why
this<00:04:37.599> is<00:04:37.780> all<00:04:37.900> mind<00:04:38.500> out<00:04:38.650> still<00:04:38.979> and<00:04:39.690> there's<00:04:40.690> a

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
this is all mind out still and there's a

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.779 
this is all mind out still and there's a
lot<00:04:40.930> of<00:04:40.960> resources<00:04:41.229> in<00:04:41.530> here<00:04:41.710> but<00:04:42.550> anyway<00:04:42.759> I

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:42.789 
lot of resources in here but anyway I

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:45.510 
lot of resources in here but anyway I
kept<00:04:43.000> the<00:04:43.120> tunnel<00:04:43.360> going<00:04:43.509> and<00:04:43.870> I<00:04:44.650> just<00:04:44.889> had

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 
kept the tunnel going and I just had

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.700 
kept the tunnel going and I just had
headed<00:04:46.180> to<00:04:46.270> the<00:04:46.360> other<00:04:46.479> mine<00:04:46.720> and<00:04:47.380> I<00:04:47.440> broke

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:47.710 
headed to the other mine and I broke

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:49.740 
headed to the other mine and I broke
into<00:04:48.039> the<00:04:48.190> mine<00:04:48.400> here<00:04:48.819> and<00:04:49.030> all<00:04:49.300> these<00:04:49.330> torches

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 
into the mine here and all these torches

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.749 
into the mine here and all these torches
here<00:04:50.110> were<00:04:50.289> already<00:04:50.620> placed<00:04:50.979> so<00:04:51.490> I<00:04:51.520> just

00:04:51.749 --> 00:04:51.759 
here were already placed so I just

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:55.020 
here were already placed so I just
happened<00:04:52.090> to<00:04:52.530> come<00:04:53.530> out<00:04:53.650> of<00:04:53.770> the<00:04:53.860> tunnel<00:04:54.030> right

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030 
happened to come out of the tunnel right

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:57.839 
happened to come out of the tunnel right
where<00:04:55.270> I<00:04:55.569> had<00:04:55.810> mind<00:04:56.020> and<00:04:56.830> eventually<00:04:57.400> if<00:04:57.520> I<00:04:57.639> run

00:04:57.839 --> 00:04:57.849 
where I had mind and eventually if I run

00:04:57.849 --> 00:04:59.159 
where I had mind and eventually if I run
around<00:04:58.060> enough<00:04:58.300> in<00:04:58.449> here<00:04:58.599> i'll<00:04:58.780> probably<00:04:58.990> get

00:04:59.159 --> 00:04:59.169 
around enough in here i'll probably get

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:04.560 
around enough in here i'll probably get
lost<00:04:59.440> but<00:05:00.370> I'll<00:05:00.490> also<00:05:00.669> find<00:05:03.360> some<00:05:04.360> lava

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:04.570 
lost but I'll also find some lava

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:06.689 
lost but I'll also find some lava
because<00:05:04.870> I<00:05:04.960> the<00:05:05.620> only<00:05:05.979> crystal<00:05:06.460> that<00:05:06.580> I've

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:06.699 
because I the only crystal that I've

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:11.790 
because I the only crystal that I've
ever<00:05:06.820> gotten<00:05:08.220> was<00:05:09.220> in<00:05:09.520> this<00:05:09.669> in<00:05:10.030> this<00:05:10.300> mine<00:05:10.800> and

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800 
ever gotten was in this in this mine and

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.040 
ever gotten was in this in this mine and
it<00:05:11.919> was<00:05:12.009> down<00:05:12.160> by<00:05:12.340> some<00:05:12.550> lava<00:05:12.960> there's<00:05:13.960> one

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.050 
it was down by some lava there's one

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.760 
it was down by some lava there's one
thing<00:05:14.620> that<00:05:14.680> I<00:05:14.979> built<00:05:15.340> in<00:05:15.490> the<00:05:16.409> that<00:05:17.409> I<00:05:17.500> built

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:17.770 
thing that I built in the that I built

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:19.860 
thing that I built in the that I built
in<00:05:17.949> my<00:05:18.220> base<00:05:18.460> but<00:05:18.909> i<00:05:18.940> forgot<00:05:19.240> to<00:05:19.300> show<00:05:19.599> you<00:05:19.630> it

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:31.150 
little shrine room because when I got

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:32.879 
little shrine room because when I got
the<00:05:31.270> crystal<00:05:31.509> it's<00:05:31.810> where<00:05:32.050> my<00:05:32.229> name<00:05:32.380> of<00:05:32.590> it<00:05:32.770> is

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:32.889 
the crystal it's where my name of it is

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:35.939 
the crystal it's where my name of it is
I<00:05:33.599> built<00:05:34.599> a<00:05:34.690> pickaxe<00:05:35.050> out<00:05:35.229> of<00:05:35.320> it<00:05:35.440> so<00:05:35.560> I<00:05:35.620> get<00:05:35.830> out

00:05:35.939 --> 00:05:35.949 
I built a pickaxe out of it so I get out

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:37.170 
I built a pickaxe out of it so I get out
from<00:05:36.130> the<00:05:36.220> LA<00:05:36.310> because<00:05:36.580> I<00:05:36.789> was<00:05:36.880> really<00:05:37.060> really

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:37.180 
from the LA because I was really really

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:39.390 
from the LA because I was really really
love<00:05:37.419> in<00:05:37.870> a<00:05:37.990> lava<00:05:38.139> I<00:05:38.470> was<00:05:39.039> running<00:05:39.280> out<00:05:39.370> of

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:39.400 
love in a lava I was running out of

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.010 
love in a lava I was running out of
stuff<00:05:39.699> to<00:05:39.759> get<00:05:39.940> out<00:05:40.060> so<00:05:40.210> I<00:05:40.270> built<00:05:40.449> that<00:05:40.509> crystal

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:41.020 
stuff to get out so I built that crystal

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.589 
stuff to get out so I built that crystal
pickaxe<00:05:41.409> and<00:05:41.789> I<00:05:42.789> used<00:05:43.030> it<00:05:43.180> for<00:05:43.360> a<00:05:43.389> long<00:05:43.570> time

00:05:43.589 --> 00:05:43.599 
pickaxe and I used it for a long time

00:05:43.599 --> 00:05:45.689 
pickaxe and I used it for a long time
and<00:05:44.050> I<00:05:44.080> thought<00:05:44.229> crystal<00:05:44.919> was<00:05:45.009> invincible<00:05:45.280> but

00:05:45.689 --> 00:05:45.699 
and I thought crystal was invincible but

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:48.870 
and I thought crystal was invincible but
it's<00:05:45.849> not<00:05:46.080> so<00:05:47.250> eventually<00:05:48.250> broke<00:05:48.610> and<00:05:48.849> I

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:48.880 
it's not so eventually broke and I

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.100 
it's not so eventually broke and I
didn't<00:05:49.060> want<00:05:49.210> it<00:05:49.240> to<00:05:49.300> break<00:05:49.509> all<00:05:49.719> the<00:05:49.810> way<00:05:49.930> like

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.110 
didn't want it to break all the way like

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:51.659 
didn't want it to break all the way like
with<00:05:50.259> mother<00:05:50.530> item<00:05:50.860> so<00:05:51.009> I<00:05:51.039> built<00:05:51.250> the<00:05:51.370> shrine

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:51.669 
with mother item so I built the shrine

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:55.320 
with mother item so I built the shrine
out<00:05:51.880> of<00:05:52.320> was<00:05:53.320> that<00:05:53.349> iron<00:05:53.680> and<00:05:54.039> gold<00:05:54.219> and<00:05:54.669> I

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:55.330 
out of was that iron and gold and I

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:57.990 
out of was that iron and gold and I
built<00:05:55.539> this<00:05:55.630> entire<00:05:55.810> room<00:05:56.199> out<00:05:56.440> of<00:05:57.000> stone

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.000 
built this entire room out of stone

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.879 
built this entire room out of stone
slabs<00:05:58.419> which<00:05:58.780> is<00:05:58.960> made<00:05:59.169> from<00:05:59.349> three<00:05:59.680> of<00:05:59.770> these

00:05:59.879 --> 00:05:59.889 
slabs which is made from three of these

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:03.060 
slabs which is made from three of these
stones<00:06:00.820> and<00:06:01.210> I<00:06:02.169> that<00:06:02.409> much<00:06:02.560> for<00:06:02.710> most<00:06:02.830> of<00:06:03.009> us

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:03.070 
stones and I that much for most of us

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:04.529 
stones and I that much for most of us

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:10.750 
this is all the crystal daughter found

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:13.890 
this is all the crystal daughter found
on<00:06:10.930> this<00:06:11.020> entire<00:06:11.289> save<00:06:11.650> file<00:06:12.360> but<00:06:13.360> if<00:06:13.449> you<00:06:13.570> put

on this entire save file but if you put
a<00:06:14.139> box<00:06:14.500> with<00:06:14.800> some<00:06:14.860> on<00:06:15.130> top<00:06:15.159> of<00:06:15.400> it<00:06:15.460> you<00:06:15.520> can't

00:06:16.279 --> 00:06:16.289 
a box with some on top of it you can't

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:18.959 
a box with some on top of it you can't
he<00:06:17.289> can<00:06:17.500> openness<00:06:17.919> I<00:06:18.070> had<00:06:18.190> to<00:06:18.280> build<00:06:18.430> an<00:06:18.639> entire

00:06:18.959 --> 00:06:18.969 
he can openness I had to build an entire

00:06:18.969 --> 00:06:22.890 
he can openness I had to build an entire
tunnel<00:06:19.949> around<00:06:20.949> the<00:06:21.070> side<00:06:21.630> and<00:06:22.630> I<00:06:22.719> eventually

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:22.900 
tunnel around the side and I eventually

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:26.520 
tunnel around the side and I eventually
wall<00:06:23.229> been<00:06:23.440> in<00:06:23.560> but<00:06:23.800> uh<00:06:24.330> if<00:06:25.330> it's<00:06:26.020> not<00:06:26.229> i've<00:06:26.380> got

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:26.530 
wall been in but uh if it's not i've got

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:28.980 
wall been in but uh if it's not i've got
any<00:06:26.710> more<00:06:26.860> so<00:06:27.070> so<00:06:27.520> you<00:06:27.669> can<00:06:27.849> tell<00:06:28.090> there's<00:06:28.479> this

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:28.990 
any more so so you can tell there's this

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:31.560 
any more so so you can tell there's this
big<00:06:29.199> server<00:06:29.440> storm<00:06:29.740> behind<00:06:29.919> it<00:06:30.219> but<00:06:31.180> i<00:06:31.240> think

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:31.570 
big server storm behind it but i think

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:33.600 
big server storm behind it but i think
that<00:06:31.599> is<00:06:31.840> my<00:06:32.080> entire<00:06:32.380> base<00:06:32.680> and<00:06:32.949> this<00:06:33.039> is<00:06:33.219> this

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:33.610 
that is my entire base and this is this

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:36.450 
that is my entire base and this is this
is<00:06:33.760> where<00:06:33.940> it<00:06:34.029> was<00:06:34.150> originally

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:36.460 

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:39.639 

there<00:06:37.460> you
