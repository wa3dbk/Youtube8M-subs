comparison right now really quick on him

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.290 
comparison right now really quick on him
and<00:04:07.410> the<00:04:07.500> flash<00:04:07.770> these<00:04:08.640> are<00:04:08.790> the<00:04:08.880> two<00:04:09.030> figures

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:09.300 
and the flash these are the two figures

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:10.760 
and the flash these are the two figures
that<00:04:09.450> came<00:04:09.540> out<00:04:09.690> together<00:04:09.989> and<00:04:10.200> you<00:04:10.470> can<00:04:10.620> get

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:10.770 
that came out together and you can get

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:11.870 
that came out together and you can get
him<00:04:10.890> to<00:04:10.950> stand<00:04:11.250> straight

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
him to stand straight

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.720 
him to stand straight
you<00:04:12.480> just<00:04:12.630> got<00:04:12.750> straighten<00:04:13.110> out<00:04:13.230> his<00:04:13.380> uh

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:13.730 
you just got straighten out his uh

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.460 
you just got straighten out his uh
because<00:04:14.730> he<00:04:14.819> cut<00:04:15.000> he<00:04:15.150> comes<00:04:15.390> slouched<00:04:15.780> but<00:04:16.320> you

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
because he cut he comes slouched but you

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.460 
because he cut he comes slouched but you
can<00:04:16.650> get<00:04:16.890> him<00:04:17.010> to<00:04:17.130> stand<00:04:17.280> a<00:04:17.430> little<00:04:17.459> more

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
can get him to stand a little more

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.580 
can get him to stand a little more
straight<00:04:19.549> get<00:04:20.549> him<00:04:20.669> right<00:04:21.450> next<00:04:21.630> to<00:04:21.810> flash<00:04:22.109> so

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
straight get him right next to flash so

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.070 
straight get him right next to flash so
you<00:04:22.680> can<00:04:22.800> see<00:04:22.919> this<00:04:23.040> the<00:04:24.030> height<00:04:24.240> differences

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
you can see this the height differences

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:30.800 
you can see this the height differences
in<00:04:25.290> both<00:04:25.530> figures<00:04:29.060> so<00:04:30.060> the<00:04:30.150> parademon<00:04:30.660> is

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
in both figures so the parademon is

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.380 
in both figures so the parademon is
pretty<00:04:31.200> tall<00:04:31.440> he<00:04:32.100> does<00:04:32.310> kind<00:04:32.610> of<00:04:32.760> these

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:33.390 
pretty tall he does kind of these

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:37.460 
pretty tall he does kind of these
slightly<00:04:33.720> towers<00:04:34.169> over<00:04:34.500> the<00:04:34.830> flash<00:04:36.320> get<00:04:37.320> out

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
slightly towers over the flash get out

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.370 
slightly towers over the flash get out
of<00:04:37.560> the<00:04:37.650> way<00:04:37.800> now<00:04:38.190> in<00:04:38.460> the<00:04:38.520> way<00:04:39.210> of<00:04:39.510> the

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:40.380 
of the way now in the way of the

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.710 
of the way now in the way of the
parademons<00:04:41.040> articulation<00:04:41.820> man<00:04:42.450> this<00:04:42.600> guy's

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
parademons articulation man this guy's

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.810 
parademons articulation man this guy's
just<00:04:42.870> nice<00:04:43.080> he<00:04:43.410> is<00:04:43.440> just<00:04:43.740> really<00:04:44.130> really<00:04:44.220> nice

like<00:05:23.850> the<00:05:24.030> cables<00:05:24.390> cuz<00:05:24.510> they<00:05:24.570> can't<00:05:25.410> be<00:05:25.500> veins

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:26.810 
like the cables cuz they can't be veins

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:29.600 
like the cables cuz they can't be veins
but<00:05:27.810> the<00:05:28.410> head<00:05:28.590> can<00:05:28.800> rotate<00:05:28.830> you<00:05:29.340> can<00:05:29.370> just

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.610 
but the head can rotate you can just

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:31.340 
but the head can rotate you can just
rotate<00:05:29.910> the<00:05:30.030> head<00:05:30.180> side<00:05:30.390> to<00:05:30.419> side<00:05:30.570> it's<00:05:31.260> pretty

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:31.350 
rotate the head side to side it's pretty

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:35.570 
rotate the head side to side it's pretty
much<00:05:31.620> all<00:05:31.830> you're<00:05:32.010> gonna<00:05:32.100> get<00:05:32.780> the<00:05:33.780> arms<00:05:34.580> they

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:35.580 
much all you're gonna get the arms they

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.990 
much all you're gonna get the arms they
do<00:05:35.640> go<00:05:35.970> in<00:05:36.150> and<00:05:36.300> out<00:05:36.770> and<00:05:37.770> this<00:05:38.580> doesn't<00:05:38.940> move

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.000 
do go in and out and this doesn't move

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.180 
do go in and out and this doesn't move
with<00:05:39.270> it<00:05:39.300> so<00:05:39.720> that's<00:05:39.930> cool<00:05:40.110> you<00:05:40.919> can<00:05:41.039> also

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:41.190 
with it so that's cool you can also

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:43.820 
with it so that's cool you can also
rotate<00:05:41.580> the<00:05:42.210> arm<00:05:42.419> it's<00:05:43.020> got<00:05:43.140> a<00:05:43.169> bend<00:05:43.500> at<00:05:43.770> the

elbow this is just nice I really like
this<00:05:47.880> figure<00:05:48.620> the<00:05:49.620> wrist<00:05:50.039> does<00:05:50.490> not<00:05:50.669> rotate

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.300 
this figure the wrist does not rotate

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.990 
this figure the wrist does not rotate
there's<00:05:51.659> no<00:05:51.870> AB<00:05:52.110> articulation<00:05:53.070> or<00:05:53.370> twist<00:05:53.760> at

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 
there's no AB articulation or twist at

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:54.589 
there's no AB articulation or twist at
the<00:05:54.030> waist

Armon<00:05:55.599> this<00:05:55.780> one<00:05:55.960> is<00:05:56.080> exactly<00:05:56.409> the<00:05:56.560> same

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:56.830 
Armon this one is exactly the same

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:02.429 
Armon this one is exactly the same
articulation<00:05:57.639> wise<00:06:00.389> and<00:06:01.389> the<00:06:01.750> legs<00:06:02.050> can<00:06:02.409> go

00:06:02.429 --> 00:06:02.439 
articulation wise and the legs can go
