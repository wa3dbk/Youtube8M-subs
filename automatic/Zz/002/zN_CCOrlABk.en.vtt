00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
you know it's not a bad pose could be

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.940 
you know it's not a bad pose could be
maybe<00:03:12.610> a<00:03:12.790> little<00:03:13.030> better<00:03:13.269> but<00:03:13.780> not<00:03:14.260> bad<00:03:14.500> it's

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
maybe a little better but not bad it's

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.670 
maybe a little better but not bad it's
not<00:03:15.100> that<00:03:15.840> you<00:03:16.840> know<00:03:16.930> it's<00:03:17.080> good<00:03:17.290> to<00:03:17.319> finish

not that you know it's good to finish

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.479 
not that you know it's good to finish
off<00:03:17.860> the<00:03:18.450> sad<00:03:19.450> I<00:03:19.480> guess<00:03:19.950> Kitty<00:03:20.950> Pryde<00:03:20.980> could

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
off the sad I guess Kitty Pryde could

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:23.670 
off the sad I guess Kitty Pryde could
probably<00:03:21.730> look<00:03:22.000> a<00:03:22.120> little<00:03:22.300> better<00:03:22.569> to<00:03:22.959> I<00:03:23.350> don't

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
probably look a little better to I don't

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.430 
probably look a little better to I don't
know<00:03:23.800> she<00:03:23.860> looks<00:03:24.130> like<00:03:24.280> she's<00:03:24.519> kind<00:03:24.790> of<00:03:24.850> like

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
know she looks like she's kind of like

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.250 
know she looks like she's kind of like
making<00:03:26.440> a<00:03:26.530> movement<00:03:26.709> or<00:03:27.100> something<00:03:27.550> I<00:03:28.360> don't

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
making a movement or something I don't

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.910 
making a movement or something I don't
know<00:03:29.530> I'm<00:03:30.250> not<00:03:30.459> trying<00:03:30.700> to<00:03:30.760> trash<00:03:31.030> it<00:03:31.060> but<00:03:31.920> they

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
know I'm not trying to trash it but they

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.229 
know I'm not trying to trash it but they
probably<00:03:33.070> could<00:03:33.310> is<00:03:33.400> a<00:03:33.519> little<00:03:33.790> better<00:03:33.940> on<00:03:34.090> her

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
probably could is a little better on her

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:41.210 
probably could is a little better on her
face<00:03:34.480> -<00:03:36.390> and<00:03:37.390> then<00:03:37.510> you<00:03:37.630> got<00:03:37.720> the<00:03:37.870> dragon<00:03:38.350> I

can<00:03:55.690> see<00:03:55.870> she's<00:03:56.079> phasing<00:03:56.709> through<00:03:57.640> yeah<00:03:58.600> not<00:03:58.989> a

00:03:59.009 --> 00:03:59.019 
can see she's phasing through yeah not a

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:02.789 
can see she's phasing through yeah not a
bad<00:03:59.200> but<00:04:00.030> shot<00:04:01.030> there<00:04:01.420> she's<00:04:02.079> phasing<00:04:02.650> through

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:02.799 
bad but shot there she's phasing through

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:04.410 
bad but shot there she's phasing through
the<00:04:02.980> Sentinel<00:04:03.400> you<00:04:03.519> can<00:04:03.609> see<00:04:03.730> half<00:04:03.910> our<00:04:04.090> leg<00:04:04.269> is

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
the Sentinel you can see half our leg is

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.050 
the Sentinel you can see half our leg is
in<00:04:04.570> the<00:04:04.600> Sentinel<00:04:05.230> and<00:04:05.350> our<00:04:05.500> elbow<00:04:05.920> is<00:04:06.160> in<00:04:06.670> the

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
in the Sentinel and our elbow is in the

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.229 
in the Sentinel and our elbow is in the
Sentinel<00:04:07.540> so<00:04:07.720> she's<00:04:07.930> attached<00:04:08.290> to<00:04:08.530> the<00:04:08.620> base

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
Sentinel so she's attached to the base

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:12.060 
Sentinel so she's attached to the base
whereas<00:04:10.239> Wolverines<00:04:10.780> separate<00:04:11.290> and<00:04:11.530> the

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:12.070 
whereas Wolverines separate and the

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:13.830 
whereas Wolverines separate and the
Dragons<00:04:12.519> separate<00:04:12.970> so<00:04:13.269> it's<00:04:13.390> three<00:04:13.630> pieces

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
Dragons separate so it's three pieces

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.960 
Dragons separate so it's three pieces
it's<00:04:14.799> kind<00:04:15.010> of<00:04:15.070> cool<00:04:15.220> how<00:04:15.250> they<00:04:15.489> did<00:04:15.670> that<00:04:15.760> her

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
it's kind of cool how they did that her

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.690 
it's kind of cool how they did that her
phasing<00:04:16.390> through<00:04:17.100> they<00:04:18.100> couldn't<00:04:18.489> do<00:04:18.669> a

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700 
phasing through they couldn't do a

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.009 
phasing through they couldn't do a
light-up<00:04:18.970> feature<00:04:19.090> on<00:04:19.419> the<00:04:19.510> exclusive

light-up feature on the exclusive

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.350 
light-up feature on the exclusive
because<00:04:20.310> for<00:04:21.310> her<00:04:21.400> to<00:04:21.519> be<00:04:21.640> phasing<00:04:21.880> through<00:04:22.180> it

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
because for her to be phasing through it

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.360 
because for her to be phasing through it
she<00:04:22.390> would<00:04:22.720> be<00:04:23.039> short-circuiting<00:04:24.039> all<00:04:24.190> the

she would be short-circuiting all the

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.150 
she would be short-circuiting all the
electric<00:04:24.840> so<00:04:25.840> you<00:04:26.470> know<00:04:26.590> as<00:04:26.710> part<00:04:26.890> of<00:04:27.010> her

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160

electric so you know as part of her
mutant<00:04:27.669> power<00:04:27.910> so<00:04:29.400> what<00:04:30.400> they<00:04:30.520> did<00:04:30.729> for<00:04:31.000> an

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
mutant power so what they did for an

looks okay I guess I mean she should be

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.300

making<00:05:31.260> a<00:05:31.320> face<00:05:31.470> like<00:05:31.620> that<00:05:31.770> I<00:05:31.830> guess<00:05:32.040> she<00:05:32.070> is

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:32.310 
making a face like that I guess she is

phasing<00:05:32.820> through<00:05:32.970> the<00:05:33.150> Sentinel<00:05:35.810> but<00:05:36.810> that's

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:36.990 
phasing through the Sentinel but that's

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:40.730 
phasing through the Sentinel but that's
it<00:05:37.200> yeah<00:05:37.920> it's<00:05:38.070> a<00:05:38.160> it's<00:05:38.850> it's<00:05:39.660> a<00:05:39.780> good<00:05:39.930> piece<00:05:40.110> it
