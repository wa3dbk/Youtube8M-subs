00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
dressed up and this darker denim I think

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.100 
dressed up and this darker denim I think
will<00:00:50.940> be<00:00:51.090> something<00:00:51.329> that<00:00:51.510> you<00:00:51.629> could<00:00:51.899> dress

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
up with a leather jacket with our twin

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.180 
up with a leather jacket with our twin
set<00:00:54.750> coming<00:00:54.989> up<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:55.590> if<00:00:55.680> you<00:00:55.770> just<00:00:55.890> wanted<00:00:56.100> to

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
set coming up and if you just wanted to

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.830 
set coming up and if you just wanted to
put<00:00:56.340> this<00:00:56.489> pink<00:00:56.760> twin<00:00:57.000> set<00:00:57.239> with<00:00:57.420> it<00:00:57.570> and<00:00:57.690> do<00:00:57.809> it

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
put this pink twin set with it and do it

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.660 
put this pink twin set with it and do it
in<00:00:58.020> darker<00:00:58.350> denim<00:00:58.530> I<00:00:58.920> think<00:00:59.370> that<00:00:59.489> would<00:00:59.579> be

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
in darker denim I think that would be

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.639 
in darker denim I think that would be
this<00:00:59.730> really<00:01:00.059> pretty<00:01:00.270> pink<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:00.899> by<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.530> way

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
this really pretty pink and by the way

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.520 
this really pretty pink and by the way
Kylene<00:01:02.160> was<00:01:02.399> just<00:01:02.670> popping<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.300> shell<00:01:03.660> from

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
Kylene was just popping the shell from

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.289 
Kylene was just popping the shell from
this<00:01:04.710> sweater<00:01:05.010> set<00:01:05.309> underneath<00:01:05.700> her<00:01:06.060> twill

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
this sweater set underneath her twill

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.390 
this sweater set underneath her twill
jacket<00:01:06.570> so<00:01:07.140> that's<00:01:07.320> why<00:01:07.470> we<00:01:07.619> had<00:01:07.770> Kylene<00:01:08.220> out

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
jacket so that's why we had Kylene out

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.280 
jacket so that's why we had Kylene out
there<00:01:08.640> she's<00:01:09.299> wearing<00:01:09.689> just<00:01:09.900> one<00:01:10.049> of<00:01:10.200> the
