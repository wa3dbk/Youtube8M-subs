early<00:00:01.340> part<00:00:01.610> of<00:00:01.730> 44<00:00:02.420> we<00:00:03.110> received<00:00:03.649> they<00:00:04.100> what

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:04.310 
early part of 44 we received they what

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:09.730 
early part of 44 we received they what
they<00:00:04.460> call<00:00:04.759> the<00:00:05.230> p-47<00:00:06.230> D<00:00:07.040> and<00:00:08.139> what<00:00:09.139> makes<00:00:09.409> so

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:09.740 
they call the p-47 D and what makes so

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.729 
they call the p-47 D and what makes so
big<00:00:09.980> as<00:00:10.280> they<00:00:10.549> are<00:00:11.119> the<00:00:11.809> ducts<00:00:12.169> that<00:00:12.469> fit

00:00:12.729 --> 00:00:12.739 
big as they are the ducts that fit

airplane and a turbine supercharger is
what<00:00:24.470> makes<00:00:24.859> the<00:00:25.249> airplane<00:00:25.730> because<00:00:26.060> you

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:26.839 
what makes the airplane because you

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:31.029 
what makes the airplane because you
derive<00:00:27.650> the<00:00:28.099> 2000<00:00:29.029> horsepower<00:00:29.470> that<00:00:30.470> you<00:00:30.619> do<00:00:30.829> a

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:34.820 
loud ground-level up to it's what you

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.880 
loud ground-level up to it's what you

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:39.890 
call a ultimate level of 30,000 feet so

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.389 
call a ultimate level of 30,000 feet so
everything<00:00:40.579> from<00:00:40.870> zero<00:00:41.870> ground<00:00:42.500> level<00:00:42.920> up<00:00:43.129> to

horsepower<00:00:47.109> that<00:00:48.109> added<00:00:48.769> power<00:00:49.039> meant<00:00:49.579> so

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 
horsepower that added power meant so

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.759 
horsepower that added power meant so
much<00:00:50.109> it<00:00:51.109> meant<00:00:51.500> that<00:00:51.649> I<00:00:52.070> could<00:00:53.019> do<00:00:54.019> combat

00:00:54.759 --> 00:00:54.769 
much it meant that I could do combat

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:57.759 
much it meant that I could do combat
with<00:00:55.190> the<00:00:55.219> enemy<00:00:55.449> over<00:00:56.449> his<00:00:56.690> territory

00:00:57.759 --> 00:00:57.769 
with the enemy over his territory

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:01.810 
with the enemy over his territory
at<00:00:58.640> all<00:00:59.030> altitudes<00:00:59.329> and<00:01:00.100> I<00:01:01.100> could<00:01:01.309> break<00:01:01.579> off

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
at all altitudes and I could break off

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.400 
at all altitudes and I could break off
at<00:01:02.089> will<00:01:03.400> because<00:01:04.400> I<00:01:04.940> had<00:01:05.300> more<00:01:05.600> power<00:01:05.960> than<00:01:06.200> he

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:06.410 
at will because I had more power than he

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:10.150 
at will because I had more power than he
had<00:01:06.770> and<00:01:07.040> I<00:01:07.460> could<00:01:07.730> corkscrew<00:01:08.740> go<00:01:09.740> up<00:01:09.950> the

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:10.160 
had and I could corkscrew go up the

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.300 
had and I could corkscrew go up the
altitude<00:01:10.760> and<00:01:10.970> he<00:01:11.090> couldn't<00:01:11.450> follow<00:01:11.690> me<00:01:12.310> not

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
altitude and he couldn't follow me not

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.560 
altitude and he couldn't follow me not
only<00:01:13.700> the<00:01:14.120> power<00:01:14.810> but<00:01:15.320> the<00:01:16.160> visibility<00:01:16.520> of<00:01:17.090> the

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
only the power but the visibility of the

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.720 
only the power but the visibility of the
pilot<00:01:18.080> in<00:01:18.260> the<00:01:18.320> cockpit<00:01:18.470> change<00:01:19.340> drastically

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:19.730 
pilot in the cockpit change drastically

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:26.170 
pilot in the cockpit change drastically
because<00:01:20.420> from<00:01:21.290> from<00:01:21.980> a<00:01:22.420> regular<00:01:24.850> canopy<00:01:25.850> that

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
because from from a regular canopy that

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.470 
because from from a regular canopy that
had<00:01:26.390> bars<00:01:26.750> on<00:01:27.230> it<00:01:27.260> we<00:01:28.100> now<00:01:28.460> had<00:01:28.820> sort<00:01:29.240> of<00:01:29.300> what

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:29.480 
had bars on it we now had sort of what

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.720 
had bars on it we now had sort of what
they<00:01:29.690> call<00:01:29.960> a<00:01:29.990> bubble<00:01:30.560> canopy<00:01:30.920> that<00:01:31.340> was<00:01:31.520> just

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:31.730 
they call a bubble canopy that was just

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:35.140 
they call a bubble canopy that was just
like<00:01:31.940> looking<00:01:32.810> out<00:01:32.990> of<00:01:33.050> out<00:01:33.890> of<00:01:34.070> it<00:01:34.250> a<00:01:34.280> tube<00:01:34.790> a

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
like looking out of out of it a tube a

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.110 
like looking out of out of it a tube a
glass<00:01:35.840> tube<00:01:36.500> so<00:01:37.100> it<00:01:37.280> gave<00:01:37.580> us<00:01:37.760> tremendous

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:38.120 
glass tube so it gave us tremendous

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.490 
glass tube so it gave us tremendous
visibility<00:01:38.990> now<00:01:39.470> we<00:01:40.430> had<00:01:40.700> to<00:01:40.910> learn<00:01:41.150> very

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
visibility now we had to learn very

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.830 
visibility now we had to learn very
gradually<00:01:42.500> as<00:01:42.650> to<00:01:42.950> what<00:01:43.310> advantage<00:01:44.120> that<00:01:44.540> gave

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
gradually as to what advantage that gave

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.880 
gradually as to what advantage that gave
us<00:01:45.020> over<00:01:45.590> the<00:01:46.010> of<00:01:46.280> 190<00:01:46.940> and<00:01:47.060> 109<00:01:47.620> the<00:01:48.620> most

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
us over the of 190 and 109 the most

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.930 
us over the of 190 and 109 the most
important<00:01:49.520> thing<00:01:49.700> that<00:01:50.110> a<00:01:51.110> pilot<00:01:51.590> has<00:01:51.800> to

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:51.940 
important thing that a pilot has to

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.210 
important thing that a pilot has to
think<00:01:52.940> about<00:01:53.240> is<00:01:53.690> as<00:01:54.050> you<00:01:54.560> screw<00:01:54.830> and<00:01:55.010> in<00:01:55.130> the

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 
think about is as you screw and in the

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.830 
think about is as you screw and in the
command<00:01:55.700> respect

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
command respect

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.580 
command respect
your<00:01:57.770> adversary<00:01:58.430> in<00:01:58.900> other<00:01:59.900> words<00:02:00.200> don't

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
your adversary in other words don't

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.620 
your adversary in other words don't
underrate<00:02:01.190> ad<00:02:01.990> adversary<00:02:02.990> so<00:02:04.150> there<00:02:05.150> are<00:02:05.390> no

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
underrate ad adversary so there are no

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.570 
underrate ad adversary so there are no
