00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240
 two 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.510
 in this video I come to bring you a 

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:19.070
 alternative if you have a device with 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:22.280
 icloud because if we are failing 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:24.680
 too much and well these days I've 

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:28.070
 found an alternative that is a 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:30.170
 from proxies and then 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.350
 what we can do from them 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:35.329
 is to enter 

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:37.970
 basically youtube is value not that I 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:40.670
 has served 100% 100% well 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.380
 and then it is very easy to use laporta les 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.080
 I will give tutorial how how 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:47.100
 enter the next one is very easy and a 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:50.079
 page where they are 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.659
 you could say updating 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:55.570
 and how can you see between youtube without 

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:59.000
 no without any problem 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:03.870
 the truth is very very well used 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:07.380
 and then let's start with the tutorial 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.270
 well the first thing we will do is enter 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.229
 our device already when we are 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.610
 connected to a wifi network we will go to 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:16.979
 here giving the home button and we will go 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.300
 to more good wifi settings when they go out 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.700
 these two and next to the network 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:25.730
 we will go to last the last where 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:28.760
 says http proxy and automatically 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:31.310
 will come as not 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.990
 and we will change it to manual 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.829
 the numbers that will be seeing starting 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:38.630
 right now we are going to use 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:41.390
 these next ones are going to be changing 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.970
 because I think they saturated something 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:48.920
 like I do not have on this page we do not 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:51.710
 we will go where the ex is and I am 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:55.700
 I've seen no more youtube works 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:58.159
 100% ok well we will enter youtube and 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.890
 as you can see 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:01.960
 given a moment to order well 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.909
 we will enter youtube on your page 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:09.490
 study them a mobile we will make a 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:09.490
 search and how to remove icloud 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:20.430
 and so 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:24.180
 let's try a video so you can see 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:27.800
 that there is audio and it worked as if 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:30.800
 you were on youtube totally normal 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.800
 all right 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.670
 because my interest is a bit slow and 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.670
 ready 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.010
 this is the first of how to make a 'by 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.810
 pass' and then 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.760
 my god but I hope that the 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.980
 copyright does not kill me for that is why 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:50.159
 everything is all I wanted to comment is 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:56.930
 a pretty good trick is a 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:56.930
 very good alternative and that 's it 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:03.810
 subscribe already know for more information 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:09.720
 subscribe to 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:12.120
 to the plural of hice yong hak dotcom for 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.720
 have their projects updated and 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:18.480
 maybe in the not too distant future 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:21.300
 we can access more things and that 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.920
 work really was truly 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.490
 well as how youtube is doing it 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.860
 at this time 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:29.130
 now if you want to go to a screen 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:32.130
 back we will be able to 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:34.830
 so to look for new video about what 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:37.620
 they talked about the magnifying glass and you can not 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:39.690
 login youtube session or your account and 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.070
 nothing of that because he is going to send you to another 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.020
 page where it says it 's impossible 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:46.680
 activate the iphone in good I'll do it 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:48.270
 so they look at what's going to come out in that 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:52.230
 message is going to come out when it's some 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:55.230
 error in the next you are like when 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:59.260
 you want to start an afro account like this and 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:03.010
 because we are not afraid because 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.500
 going back to the screen of 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.640
 home of architect and bar iphone 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.409
 they do the same procedure again and 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.470
 they will return it to the page so I do not know 

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:14.040
 worry well that's all a greeting and 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.040
 until next time
