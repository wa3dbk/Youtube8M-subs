back<00:00:04.140> for<00:00:04.290> the<00:00:04.350> cover<00:00:04.589> that's<00:00:04.859> what<00:00:05.040> they<00:00:05.160> were

know what the equivalent of walk tier 2
is<00:00:41.370> in<00:00:41.520> terms<00:00:41.700> of<00:00:41.820> how<00:00:41.940> many<00:00:42.090> wild<00:00:42.360> manners<00:00:42.600> but

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
is in terms of how many wild manners but
