a<00:01:11.340> few<00:01:11.549> reasons<00:01:11.580> my<00:01:12.570> brothers<00:01:12.930> had<00:01:13.380> the

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
a few reasons my brothers had the

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.680 
a few reasons my brothers had the
freedom<00:01:13.920> to<00:01:14.130> chop<00:01:14.940> their<00:01:15.150> hair<00:01:15.330> off<00:01:15.450> one

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:15.690 
freedom to chop their hair off one

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:17.060 
freedom to chop their hair off one
because<00:01:16.049> they<00:01:16.200> weren't<00:01:16.409> redheads<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:16.979> it

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
because they weren't redheads and it

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.920

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.749 
wouldn't burn the crap out of them but
also<00:01:19.110> because<00:01:19.350> they<00:01:19.620> were<00:01:19.680> boys<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.340> I

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
also because they were boys and I
