00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
doing for this episode and I'm using a

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.940 
doing for this episode and I'm using a
whopper<00:00:36.360> this<00:00:36.510> time<00:00:36.719> instead<00:00:36.899> of<00:00:36.989> a<00:00:37.110> yak<00:00:37.320> if

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.440 
whopper this time instead of a yak if
you<00:00:38.100> guys<00:00:38.219> don't<00:00:38.460> know<00:00:38.520> what<00:00:38.579> it<00:00:39.000> does<00:00:39.030> it

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
you guys don't know what it does it

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.260 
you guys don't know what it does it
increases<00:00:39.899> your<00:00:39.960> magic<00:00:40.260> by<00:00:41.000> seven<00:00:42.000> you<00:00:42.239> know

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
increases your magic by seven you know

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.010 
increases your magic by seven you know
plus<00:00:42.510> seven<00:00:42.840> so<00:00:43.910> yeah<00:00:44.910> basically<00:00:45.390> increases

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
plus seven so yeah basically increases

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.990 
plus seven so yeah basically increases
your<00:00:46.140> accuracy<00:00:46.559> and<00:00:46.649> damage<00:00:46.800> so<00:00:47.670> it<00:00:47.789> should<00:00:47.910> be

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
your accuracy and damage so it should be

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.369 
your accuracy and damage so it should be
nice<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.180> use<00:00:48.450> hopefully<00:00:48.899> it<00:00:48.989> works<00:00:49.140> well
