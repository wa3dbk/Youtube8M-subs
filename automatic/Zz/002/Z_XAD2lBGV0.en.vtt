world there's a giant world here I could

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:48.389 
world there's a giant world here I could
go<00:01:46.450> anywhere<00:01:46.780> I<00:01:46.930> wanted<00:01:47.290> in<00:01:47.439> it<00:01:47.560> however<00:01:48.009> there

go anywhere I wanted in it however there

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:51.240 
go anywhere I wanted in it however there
is<00:01:48.579> a<00:01:48.610> catch<00:01:49.119> if<00:01:49.390> I'd<00:01:49.540> go<00:01:49.720> past<00:01:50.020> a<00:01:50.170> certain<00:01:50.590> part

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
is a catch if I'd go past a certain part

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.280 
is a catch if I'd go past a certain part
of<00:01:51.430> the<00:01:51.490> world<00:01:51.640> a<00:01:52.060> lot<00:01:52.450> of<00:01:52.540> the<00:01:52.630> enemies<00:01:52.810> are<00:01:53.259> a

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.290 
of the world a lot of the enemies are a

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.350 
of the world a lot of the enemies are a
lot<00:01:53.560> higher<00:01:53.860> rank<00:01:54.250> so<00:01:54.549> at<00:01:54.670> the<00:01:54.729> moment<00:01:54.880> in<00:01:55.119> here

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
lot higher rank so at the moment in here

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.200 
lot higher rank so at the moment in here
I<00:01:55.390> think<00:01:55.659> I'm<00:01:55.750> about<00:01:55.869> a<00:01:55.990> rank<00:01:56.259> 5<00:01:56.649> and<00:01:57.640> if<00:01:57.880> I<00:01:58.030> was

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
I think I'm about a rank 5 and if I was

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.270 
I think I'm about a rank 5 and if I was
to<00:01:58.240> travel<00:01:58.630> on<00:01:58.899> on<00:01:59.140> my<00:01:59.290> little<00:01:59.590> sparrow<00:01:59.920> which

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
to travel on on my little sparrow which

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.920 
to travel on on my little sparrow which
is<00:02:00.430> the<00:02:00.520> little<00:02:00.759> vehicle<00:02:00.909> I<00:02:01.210> have<00:02:01.450> for<00:02:01.719> about

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:01.930 
is the little vehicle I have for about

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:03.420 
is the little vehicle I have for about
you<00:02:02.079> know<00:02:02.200> five<00:02:02.530> or<00:02:02.560> so<00:02:02.890> minutes

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
you know five or so minutes

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.219 
you know five or so minutes
I<00:02:03.460> would<00:02:03.820> enter<00:02:04.060> an<00:02:04.180> area<00:02:04.509> where<00:02:04.659> all<00:02:04.869> of<00:02:05.079> the

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
I would enter an area where all of the

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:07.319 
I would enter an area where all of the
enemies<00:02:05.590> are<00:02:05.829> level<00:02:06.159> 20<00:02:06.610> so<00:02:06.759> I<00:02:06.790> could<00:02:07.030> go<00:02:07.149> do

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:07.329 
enemies are level 20 so I could go do

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:09.150 
enemies are level 20 so I could go do
that<00:02:07.450> if<00:02:07.600> I<00:02:07.719> want<00:02:08.019> but<00:02:08.470> it's<00:02:08.590> probably<00:02:08.799> much

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
that if I want but it's probably much

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.680 
that if I want but it's probably much
better<00:02:09.220> to<00:02:09.640> just<00:02:09.850> stick<00:02:10.060> in<00:02:10.239> the<00:02:10.329> area<00:02:10.540> you're

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
better to just stick in the area you're

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.600 
better to just stick in the area you're
at<00:02:10.840> where<00:02:11.230> all<00:02:11.380> the<00:02:11.560> enemies<00:02:11.950> are<00:02:12.100> a<00:02:12.130> similar

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
at where all the enemies are a similar

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.190 
at where all the enemies are a similar
level<00:02:12.760> to<00:02:13.030> you<00:02:13.150> and<00:02:13.510> you<00:02:13.629> can<00:02:13.750> actually<00:02:13.840> take

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
level to you and you can actually take

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.479 
level to you and you can actually take
them<00:02:14.440> on<00:02:14.560> because<00:02:14.709> against<00:02:15.040> those<00:02:15.190> higher

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
them on because against those higher

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:16.970 
them on because against those higher
level<00:02:15.790> enemies<00:02:16.120> your<00:02:16.330> bullets<00:02:16.690> just

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
level enemies your bullets just

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.160 
level enemies your bullets just
absolutely<00:02:17.760> no<00:02:17.970> damage<00:02:18.239> and<00:02:18.540> you'll<00:02:18.930> probably

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
absolutely no damage and you'll probably

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.170 
absolutely no damage and you'll probably
get<00:02:19.470> killed<00:02:19.769> now<00:02:20.190> in<00:02:20.340> this<00:02:20.489> scenario<00:02:20.730> here

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
get killed now in this scenario here

diamonds<00:02:44.489> I<00:02:44.849> can't<00:02:45.090> think<00:02:45.209> of<00:02:45.269> the<00:02:45.329> actual

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
diamonds I can't think of the actual

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:46.910 
diamonds I can't think of the actual
technical<00:02:45.930> term<00:02:46.110> for<00:02:46.140> what<00:02:46.470> they're<00:02:46.650> called

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
technical term for what they're called

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.160 
technical term for what they're called
but<00:02:47.489> I<00:02:47.790> was<00:02:47.909> pumped<00:02:48.150> by<00:02:48.239> the<00:02:48.269> Bungie<00:02:48.690> devs<00:02:48.930> that

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
but I was pumped by the Bungie devs that

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.960 
but I was pumped by the Bungie devs that
all<00:02:49.290> the<00:02:49.470> loot<00:02:49.650> is<00:02:49.829> your<00:02:50.010> own<00:02:50.190> so<00:02:50.549> it's<00:02:50.730> not<00:02:50.849> why

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
all the loot is your own so it's not why

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.030 
all the loot is your own so it's not why
