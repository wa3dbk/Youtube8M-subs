so<00:04:57.580> that's<00:04:58.580> just<00:04:58.640> my<00:04:58.850> prediction<00:04:59.360> on<00:04:59.480> it<00:04:59.690> I

00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840 
so that's just my prediction on it I

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:01.480 
so that's just my prediction on it I
think<00:05:00.169> I<00:05:00.290> think<00:05:00.530> the<00:05:00.620> shelf<00:05:00.890> life<00:05:01.010> of<00:05:01.190> modern

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490 
think I think the shelf life of modern

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.560 
think I think the shelf life of modern
warfare<00:05:01.640> is<00:05:02.080> going<00:05:03.080> to<00:05:03.140> be<00:05:03.200> over<00:05:03.560> a<00:05:03.640> 2012<00:05:04.640> next

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:05.570 
warfare is going to be over a 2012 next

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:09.250 
warfare is going to be over a 2012 next
fall<00:05:05.780> and<00:05:06.110> this<00:05:06.919> is<00:05:07.070> the<00:05:07.190> end<00:05:07.340> so<00:05:08.150> you<00:05:08.510> know<00:05:09.020> I'm

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:09.260 
fall and this is the end so you know I'm

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.590 
fall and this is the end so you know I'm
just<00:05:09.440> keeping<00:05:09.740> it<00:05:09.830> real<00:05:09.860> I'm<00:05:10.520> probably<00:05:11.120> you

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:11.600 
just keeping it real I'm probably you

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.210 
just keeping it real I'm probably you
know<00:05:11.630> I<00:05:11.720> think<00:05:11.870> respawn<00:05:12.410> entertainment<00:05:12.620> it's

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:13.220 
know I think respawn entertainment it's

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:14.530 
know I think respawn entertainment it's
probably<00:05:13.490> going<00:05:13.669> to<00:05:13.729> be<00:05:13.790> the<00:05:13.880> game<00:05:14.210> to<00:05:14.360> go<00:05:14.510> to

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:14.540 
probably going to be the game to go to

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:16.540 
probably going to be the game to go to
and<00:05:15.050> i<00:05:15.770> think<00:05:15.860> is<00:05:16.010> going<00:05:16.100> to<00:05:16.220> go<00:05:16.280> like<00:05:16.430> this

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:16.550 
and i think is going to go like this

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.030 
and i think is going to go like this
respawn<00:05:17.060> number<00:05:17.330> one<00:05:17.540> halo<00:05:18.200> for<00:05:18.470> number<00:05:18.740> two

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:19.040 
respawn number one halo for number two

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:23.110 
respawn number one halo for number two
and<00:05:19.370> uh<00:05:20.350> triarchs<00:05:21.350> black<00:05:21.590> ops<00:05:21.860> part<00:05:22.160> 2<00:05:22.370> number

3 will still be there but I think it's

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:31.360
