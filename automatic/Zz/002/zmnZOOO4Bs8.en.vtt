00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829

blue side we're starting off with the

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.369 
blue side we're starting off with the
main<00:00:59.190> spawn<00:00:59.609> a<00:00:59.850> main<00:01:00.359> sponsor<00:01:00.570> arts<00:01:01.109> out<00:01:01.230> with

main spawn a main sponsor arts out with

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.100 
main spawn a main sponsor arts out with
the<00:01:01.559> one<00:01:01.859> spot<00:01:02.250> which<00:01:03.180> does<00:01:03.449> include<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.930> main

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
the one spot which does include the main

the one spot which does include the main
spawn<00:01:04.439> as<00:01:04.650> that<00:01:04.890> circle<00:01:05.369> point<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:05.790> then

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
spawn as that circle point and then

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.640 
spawn as that circle point and then
there<00:01:06.270> is<00:01:06.390> our<00:01:06.420> spawn<00:01:06.900> right<00:01:07.110> next<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.470> it<00:01:07.500> now

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
there is our spawn right next to it now

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.649 
there is our spawn right next to it now
this<00:01:07.830> spawn<00:01:08.130> you<00:01:08.520> don't<00:01:08.790> usually<00:01:09.000> spawn<00:01:09.479> in

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
this spawn you don't usually spawn in

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.810 
this spawn you don't usually spawn in
during<00:01:10.350> domination<00:01:11.070> games<00:01:11.250> or<00:01:11.490> really<00:01:11.670> any

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
during domination games or really any

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.310 
during domination games or really any
other<00:01:12.030> game<00:01:12.270> type<00:01:12.510> just<00:01:12.810> because<00:01:13.080> it<00:01:13.200> is

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
other game type just because it is

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.530 
other game type just because it is
pushed<00:01:13.590> so<00:01:13.799> far<00:01:13.830> back<00:01:14.280> if<00:01:14.490> you<00:01:14.909> spawn<00:01:15.210> here<00:01:15.450> it

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
pushed so far back if you spawn here it

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.300 
pushed so far back if you spawn here it
usually<00:01:15.990> means<00:01:16.200> they<00:01:16.470> are<00:01:16.590> really<00:01:16.890> pushed<00:01:17.159> out

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
usually means they are really pushed out

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.370 
usually means they are really pushed out
of<00:01:17.340> your<00:01:17.490> spawn<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:18.090> that<00:01:18.659> if<00:01:18.840> you<00:01:18.960> get<00:01:19.140> killed

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
of your spawn and that if you get killed

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
of your spawn and that if you get killed
there<00:01:19.560> you're<00:01:19.680> probably<00:01:19.979> going<00:01:20.220> to<00:01:20.280> be

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
there you're probably going to be

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.880 
there you're probably going to be
flipping<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.000> red<00:01:21.270> side<00:01:21.540> or<00:01:22.200> flipping<00:01:22.650> to

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
flipping to the red side or flipping to

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.380 
flipping to the red side or flipping to
another<00:01:23.159> spawn<00:01:23.490> that's<00:01:23.759> really<00:01:24.000> far<00:01:24.180> out<00:01:24.360> of

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
another spawn that's really far out of

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.820 
another spawn that's really far out of
your<00:01:24.479> base<00:01:24.720> as<00:01:24.960> it<00:01:25.020> means<00:01:25.320> that<00:01:25.470> you<00:01:25.530> have<00:01:25.680> been

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
your base as it means that you have been

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.170 
your base as it means that you have been
pushed<00:01:26.070> in<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:26.490> you're<00:01:26.610> either<00:01:26.729> triple

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
pushed in and you're either triple

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.210 
pushed in and you're either triple
capped<00:01:27.390> or<00:01:27.570> about<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.170> get<00:01:28.259> triple<00:01:28.590> cap<00:01:28.740> so

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
capped or about to get triple cap so

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.620 
capped or about to get triple cap so
next<00:01:29.460> remove<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.640> two<00:01:29.729> spawn<00:01:30.210> point<00:01:30.450> now<00:01:30.570> the

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
next remove the two spawn point now the

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.690 
next remove the two spawn point now the
two<00:01:30.869> spawn<00:01:31.110> point<00:01:31.320> is<00:01:31.439> right<00:01:31.680> on<00:01:31.979> that<00:01:32.220> a<00:01:32.250> flag

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
two spawn point is right on that a flag

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.640 
two spawn point is right on that a flag
so<00:01:33.240> what<00:01:33.390> this<00:01:33.509> means<00:01:33.570> usually<00:01:33.960> is<00:01:34.350> that<00:01:34.380> your

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
so what this means usually is that your

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.620 
so what this means usually is that your
team<00:01:34.860> has<00:01:34.890> pushed<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:35.610> B<00:01:35.820> but<00:01:36.299> they're<00:01:36.509> not

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
team has pushed to B but they're not

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.270 
team has pushed to B but they're not
going<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:36.930> spawn<00:01:37.200> you<00:01:37.350> at<00:01:37.530> that<00:01:37.740> three<00:01:38.040> spot

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
going to spawn you at that three spot

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.800 
going to spawn you at that three spot
because<00:01:38.610> someone<00:01:38.939> is<00:01:39.060> over<00:01:39.329> there<00:01:39.450> so<00:01:39.630> if<00:01:39.720> you

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
because someone is over there so if you

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.749 
because someone is over there so if you
spun<00:01:40.020> it<00:01:40.200> a<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.860> first<00:01:41.159> thing<00:01:41.400> you<00:01:41.549> should<00:01:41.579> be

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
look into that three spawn to make sure

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.700 
look into that three spawn to make sure
that<00:01:45.270> you<00:01:45.360> don't<00:01:45.540> get<00:01:45.630> spawn<00:01:45.930> killed<00:01:46.200> make

you spawn at three it means the other
team<00:01:58.079> is<00:01:58.229> about<00:01:58.469> to<00:01:58.590> cap<00:01:58.799> that<00:01:58.979> a<00:01:59.100> flag<00:01:59.340> so<00:01:59.820> it's

team is about to cap that a flag so it's

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.160

possibly pick up a kill there make sure

possibly pick up a kill there make sure
of<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.119> four<00:02:06.360> spawn<00:02:06.630> now<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:06.869> forest<00:02:07.229> pond<00:02:07.350> is

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
of the four spawn now the forest pond is

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.589 
of the four spawn now the forest pond is
very<00:02:07.799> close<00:02:08.160> to<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.550> three<00:02:08.819> spawn<00:02:09.149> off<00:02:09.390> from

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
very close to the three spawn off from

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.449 
very close to the three spawn off from
the<00:02:09.720> red<00:02:09.899> side<00:02:10.140> if<00:02:10.349> you<00:02:10.709> spawn<00:02:11.009> here<00:02:11.310> it

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
the red side if you spawn here it

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.610 
the red side if you spawn here it
usually<00:02:11.819> means<00:02:11.970> they're<00:02:12.239> going<00:02:12.360> to<00:02:12.420> be

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
usually means they're going to be

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.440 
usually means they're going to be
to<00:02:12.709> go<00:02:12.830> pick<00:02:13.010> up<00:02:13.099> that<00:02:13.159> sea<00:02:13.519> flag<00:02:13.760> and<00:02:13.970> possibly

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
to go pick up that sea flag and possibly

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.539 
to go pick up that sea flag and possibly
go<00:02:14.569> for<00:02:14.720> the<00:02:14.810> triple<00:02:15.170> cap<00:02:15.319> if<00:02:15.500> possible<00:02:16.010> so<00:02:16.459> if

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:16.549 
go for the triple cap if possible so if

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:17.979 
go for the triple cap if possible so if
you<00:02:16.640> do<00:02:16.760> spawn<00:02:17.030> at<00:02:17.150> four<00:02:17.360> I<00:02:17.390> would<00:02:17.510> definitely

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
you do spawn at four I would definitely

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:20.530 
you do spawn at four I would definitely
recommend<00:02:18.400> looking<00:02:19.400> at<00:02:19.549> three<00:02:19.909> flag<00:02:20.180> first

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
recommend looking at three flag first

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.809 
recommend looking at three flag first
and<00:02:20.810> then<00:02:21.140> possibly<00:02:21.680> pushing<00:02:21.980> B<00:02:22.280> through<00:02:22.549> top

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819 
and then possibly pushing B through top

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:24.520 
and then possibly pushing B through top
glass<00:02:23.120> um<00:02:23.420> if<00:02:23.599> you're<00:02:23.750> able<00:02:23.870> to<00:02:24.019> get<00:02:24.260> there<00:02:24.440> at

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
glass um if you're able to get there at

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.830 
glass um if you're able to get there at
that<00:02:24.650> point<00:02:24.860> and<00:02:25.099> look<00:02:25.549> at<00:02:25.670> that<00:02:25.849> red<00:02:26.150> to<00:02:26.480> spawn

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
that point and look at that red to spawn

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.570 
that point and look at that red to spawn
and<00:02:27.110> possibly<00:02:27.620> pick<00:02:27.830> up<00:02:27.950> some<00:02:28.099> spawn<00:02:28.340> kills

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
and possibly pick up some spawn kills

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.160 
and possibly pick up some spawn kills
there<00:02:28.790> so<00:02:29.269> next<00:02:29.420> we'll<00:02:29.569> move<00:02:29.629> over<00:02:29.840> to<00:02:29.930> the<00:02:30.019> red

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
there so next we'll move over to the red

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.170 
there so next we'll move over to the red

flag is on your opposing team side so

00:02:58.549 --> 00:02:59.890 
flag is on your opposing team side so
we'll<00:02:58.640> start<00:02:58.879> off<00:02:58.970> with<00:02:59.000> the<00:02:59.150> one<00:02:59.299> spawn<00:02:59.659> point

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
we'll start off with the one spawn point

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.720 
we'll start off with the one spawn point
which<00:03:00.049> is<00:03:00.200> May<00:03:00.349> and<00:03:00.500> spawn<00:03:00.709> the<00:03:01.159> one<00:03:01.400> spawn

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
which is May and spawn the one spawn

game if the other team is really pushing
your<00:03:22.190> spawn<00:03:22.459> hard<00:03:22.730> so<00:03:23.239> make<00:03:23.389> sure<00:03:23.510> of<00:03:23.599> the<00:03:23.690> two

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
your spawn hard so make sure of the two

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.360 
your spawn hard so make sure of the two
spawn<00:03:24.169> point<00:03:24.410> now<00:03:24.500> the<00:03:24.560> two<00:03:24.799> spawn<00:03:25.069> point<00:03:25.280> is

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
spawn point now the two spawn point is

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.849 
spawn point now the two spawn point is
very<00:03:25.730> close<00:03:26.150> to<00:03:26.209> that<00:03:26.419> B<00:03:26.690> flag<00:03:26.989> if<00:03:27.230> you<00:03:27.590> spawn

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:27.859 
very close to that B flag if you spawn

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:29.229 
very close to that B flag if you spawn
here<00:03:28.099> it<00:03:28.190> usually<00:03:28.549> means<00:03:28.790> that<00:03:28.910> you're<00:03:29.120> both

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
here it usually means that you're both

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:31.089 
here it usually means that you're both
to<00:03:29.389> get<00:03:29.510> capped<00:03:29.750> at<00:03:29.930> C<00:03:30.139> and<00:03:30.349> the<00:03:30.709> first<00:03:30.950> thing

00:03:31.089 --> 00:03:31.099 
to get capped at C and the first thing

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:33.069 
to get capped at C and the first thing
you<00:03:31.160> want<00:03:31.489> to<00:03:31.579> do<00:03:31.730> is<00:03:31.940> push<00:03:32.180> that<00:03:32.389> B<00:03:32.569> flag<00:03:32.840> or

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:33.079 
you want to do is push that B flag or

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:35.500 
you want to do is push that B flag or
drop<00:03:33.560> back<00:03:33.739> to<00:03:33.769> your<00:03:34.069> home<00:03:34.250> spawn<00:03:34.609> point<00:03:34.879> which

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
drop back to your home spawn point which

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.300 
drop back to your home spawn point which
is<00:03:35.690> C<00:03:35.900> and<00:03:36.109> definitely<00:03:36.500> pick<00:03:36.680> up<00:03:36.799> those<00:03:36.950> flags

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
is C and definitely pick up those flags

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.339 
is C and definitely pick up those flags
it<00:03:37.790> is<00:03:37.940> very<00:03:38.239> easy<00:03:38.480> to<00:03:38.629> get<00:03:38.780> flipped<00:03:39.079> on<00:03:39.200> this

00:03:39.339 --> 00:03:39.349 
it is very easy to get flipped on this

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:40.569 
it is very easy to get flipped on this
map<00:03:39.560> so<00:03:39.590> I<00:03:39.829> would<00:03:40.010> definitely<00:03:40.430> recommend

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:40.579 
map so I would definitely recommend

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:42.939 
map so I would definitely recommend
always<00:03:41.569> hopping<00:03:41.840> on<00:03:42.109> those<00:03:42.260> flags<00:03:42.560> if<00:03:42.829> you

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:42.949 
always hopping on those flags if you

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:44.830 
always hopping on those flags if you
spawn<00:03:43.250> here<00:03:43.459> and<00:03:43.549> whenever<00:03:43.669> possible<00:03:44.030> next

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
spawn here and whenever possible next

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.210 
spawn here and whenever possible next
year<00:03:44.930> the<00:03:45.049> three<00:03:45.079> spawn<00:03:45.590> point<00:03:45.829> now<00:03:45.889> the<00:03:45.980> three

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
year the three spawn point now the three

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.490 
year the three spawn point now the three
spawn<00:03:46.430> point<00:03:46.639> very<00:03:47.030> similar<00:03:47.480> to<00:03:47.599> four<00:03:47.870> is<00:03:48.049> in

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
spawn point very similar to four is in

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.069 
spawn point very similar to four is in
this<00:03:48.709> main<00:03:48.980> building<00:03:49.459> area<00:03:49.849> and<00:03:50.480> you<00:03:50.810> spawn

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:51.079 
this main building area and you spawn

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:52.720 
this main building area and you spawn
here<00:03:51.379> it<00:03:51.560> definitely<00:03:51.769> means<00:03:52.250> that<00:03:52.489> the<00:03:52.579> other

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
here it definitely means that the other

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:54.819 
here it definitely means that the other
team<00:03:53.000> has<00:03:53.209> pushed<00:03:53.449> in<00:03:53.660> your<00:03:53.810> spawn<00:03:54.109> or<00:03:54.319> that

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:54.829 
team has pushed in your spawn or that

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:56.229 
team has pushed in your spawn or that
they<00:03:54.919> have<00:03:55.040> pushed<00:03:55.250> back<00:03:55.370> out<00:03:55.760> of<00:03:55.790> your<00:03:55.940> spawn

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
they have pushed back out of your spawn

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:57.789 
they have pushed back out of your spawn
which<00:03:56.480> gives<00:03:56.690> you<00:03:56.780> that<00:03:56.930> time<00:03:57.139> to<00:03:57.349> spawn<00:03:57.590> in

00:03:57.789 --> 00:03:57.799 
which gives you that time to spawn in

00:03:57.799 --> 00:03:59.680 
which gives you that time to spawn in
and<00:03:58.400> push<00:03:58.579> the<00:03:58.760> other<00:03:58.790> team<00:03:59.120> so<00:03:59.299> if<00:03:59.389> you<00:03:59.449> spawn

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
and push the other team so if you spawn

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:01.509 
and push the other team so if you spawn
in<00:03:59.720> three<00:04:00.109> I<00:04:00.260> would<00:04:00.590> really<00:04:00.799> just<00:04:01.010> recommend

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
in three I would really just recommend

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:03.309 
in three I would really just recommend
going<00:04:01.819> in<00:04:01.940> for<00:04:02.090> that<00:04:02.180> a<00:04:02.389> rush<00:04:02.690> and<00:04:02.930> pushing<00:04:03.230> in

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:03.319 
going in for that a rush and pushing in

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:04.960 
going in for that a rush and pushing in
to<00:04:03.379> the<00:04:03.470> other<00:04:03.620> teams<00:04:03.829> base<00:04:04.010> and<00:04:04.280> possibly

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
to the other teams base and possibly

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:06.550 
to the other teams base and possibly
picking<00:04:05.329> up<00:04:05.449> some<00:04:05.660> very<00:04:05.690> nice<00:04:06.049> kills<00:04:06.349> there

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
picking up some very nice kills there

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.259 
picking up some very nice kills there
