00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:09.080 
right away from the beginning I figured

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.290 
right away from the beginning I figured
I<00:04:09.350> still<00:04:09.800> want<00:04:09.980> to<00:04:10.010> do<00:04:10.190> this<00:04:10.430> I'm<00:04:11.030> going<00:04:11.180> to

and<00:04:14.780> put<00:04:15.260> a<00:04:15.290> little<00:04:15.470> loop<00:04:15.710> on<00:04:15.890> it<00:04:16.040> that<00:04:16.400> I<00:04:16.430> could

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:16.730 
and put a little loop on it that I could

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:20.020 
and put a little loop on it that I could
grab<00:04:17.000> with<00:04:17.510> my<00:04:17.720> prosthesis<00:04:18.410> and<00:04:18.920> I<00:04:19.430> could<00:04:19.640> then

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
grab with my prosthesis and I could then

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.320 
grab with my prosthesis and I could then
have<00:04:20.360> more<00:04:21.170> control<00:04:21.590> of<00:04:21.620> the<00:04:21.770> gun<00:04:21.950> I<00:04:22.430> was<00:04:23.150> able

that way I was able to chamber new

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.250 
that way I was able to chamber new
shells<00:04:29.990> into<00:04:30.230> it<00:04:30.500> I<00:04:31.570> can<00:04:32.570> do<00:04:32.720> whatever<00:04:32.960> I<00:04:33.200> want
