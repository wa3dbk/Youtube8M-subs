00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
why now Craig came out in 2014 it is on

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.080 
why now Craig came out in 2014 it is on
Netflix<00:00:43.500> I<00:00:43.890> had<00:00:44.010> never<00:00:44.280> heard<00:00:44.610> of<00:00:44.699> it<00:00:44.850> I<00:00:44.879> had

only seen the cover of it on Netflix

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.380 
only seen the cover of it on Netflix
which<00:00:47.070> I<00:00:47.190> really<00:00:47.580> enjoyed<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:47.940> cover<00:00:48.150> I<00:00:48.270> think

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
which I really enjoyed the cover I think

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.380 
which I really enjoyed the cover I think
it<00:00:48.750> is<00:00:49.050> very<00:00:49.590> accurate<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.220> the<00:00:50.430> vibes<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.269> the

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
it is very accurate to the vibes and the

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.389 
it is very accurate to the vibes and the
atmosphere<00:00:52.019> of<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.290> movie<00:00:52.620> now<00:00:52.920> this<00:00:53.070> stars

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
atmosphere of the movie now this stars

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.430 
atmosphere of the movie now this stars
Patrick<00:00:53.850> Rice<00:00:54.090> who<00:00:54.329> is<00:00:54.450> also<00:00:54.630> the<00:00:54.899> writer<00:00:55.140> and

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
Patrick Rice who is also the writer and

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.930 
Patrick Rice who is also the writer and
director<00:00:55.500> of<00:00:55.950> this<00:00:56.220> film<00:00:56.460> so<00:00:56.640> it's<00:00:56.760> kind<00:00:56.910> of

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
director of this film so it's kind of

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.110 
director of this film so it's kind of
like<00:00:57.059> an<00:00:57.180> indie<00:00:57.450> film<00:00:57.660> very<00:00:58.530> not<00:00:59.309> popular<00:00:59.910> not

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
like an indie film very not popular not

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.940 
like an indie film very not popular not
known<00:01:00.450> but<00:01:00.719> tons<00:01:00.960> of<00:01:01.140> you<00:01:01.260> requested<00:01:01.500> it<00:01:01.800> so<00:01:01.920> I

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:01.950 
known but tons of you requested it so I

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:03.470 
known but tons of you requested it so I
guess<00:01:02.130> it's<00:01:02.309> known<00:01:02.550> maybe<00:01:02.850> it's<00:01:02.969> just<00:01:03.059> me

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
guess it's known maybe it's just me

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.790 
guess it's known maybe it's just me
so<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.660> basic<00:01:03.960> plot<00:01:04.110> for<00:01:04.380> this<00:01:04.559> is<00:01:04.770> a

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:04.800 
so the basic plot for this is a

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.040 
so the basic plot for this is a
videographer<00:01:05.220> response<00:01:06.030> to<00:01:06.270> Craigslist<00:01:06.869> ad

it's what I love about this is that

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.100 
it's what I love about this is that
their<00:02:10.020> weird<00:02:10.880> quirky<00:02:11.880> behaviors<00:02:12.390> about<00:02:12.750> our

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
their weird quirky behaviors about our

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.350 
their weird quirky behaviors about our
strange<00:02:13.739> but<00:02:14.400> they're<00:02:14.550> not<00:02:14.640> necessarily

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
strange but they're not necessarily

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.540 
strange but they're not necessarily
super<00:02:15.599> off-putting<00:02:16.349> right<00:02:16.860> away<00:02:17.099> they're<00:02:17.520> not

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
super off-putting right away they're not

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.170 
super off-putting right away they're not
very<00:02:18.270> like<00:02:18.660> in-your-face<00:02:19.410> like<00:02:20.060> something<00:02:21.060> is

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
very like in-your-face like something is

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.970 
very like in-your-face like something is
obviously<00:02:21.360> wrong<00:02:21.720> it's<00:02:22.290> just<00:02:22.380> kind<00:02:22.650> of<00:02:22.709> odd

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
obviously wrong it's just kind of odd

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.890 
obviously wrong it's just kind of odd
behavior<00:02:23.520> like<00:02:24.030> an<00:02:24.200> eccentric<00:02:25.340> eccentric

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
behavior like an eccentric eccentric

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.630 
behavior like an eccentric eccentric
person<00:02:27.900> would<00:02:28.110> be<00:02:28.349> and<00:02:28.709> I<00:02:28.860> love<00:02:29.099> that<00:02:29.250> I<00:02:29.310> think

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
person would be and I love that I think

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.190 
person would be and I love that I think
it's<00:02:29.760> very<00:02:29.819> realistic<00:02:30.629> and<00:02:30.750> you<00:02:30.870> just<00:02:31.079> know

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
it's very realistic and you just know

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.839 
it's very realistic and you just know
this<00:02:31.319> this<00:02:31.530> guy's<00:02:31.739> a<00:02:31.769> little<00:02:31.950> quirky<00:02:32.400> little

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
this this guy's a little quirky little

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:33.200 
this this guy's a little quirky little
stir

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210 
stir

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.730 
stir
but<00:02:34.210> then<00:02:34.390> things<00:02:34.690> get<00:02:34.990> weirder<00:02:35.440> and<00:02:35.680> weirder

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740 
but then things get weirder and weirder

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.980 
but then things get weirder and weirder
and<00:02:36.280> weirder<00:02:36.340> and<00:02:36.940> it<00:02:37.150> actually<00:02:37.570> is<00:02:37.720> very

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990 
and weirder and it actually is very

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:40.020 
and weirder and it actually is very
subtle<00:02:38.410> and<00:02:38.740> gradual<00:02:39.280> to<00:02:39.490> the<00:02:39.580> point<00:02:39.850> where

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
subtle and gradual to the point where

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:45.230 
subtle and gradual to the point where
each<00:02:40.390> one<00:02:40.690> is<00:02:40.960> like<00:02:41.290> okay<00:02:41.560> that's<00:02:41.710> weird<00:02:42.070> but

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.450

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:13.240 
you're worried about spoilers then don't

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.570 
you're worried about spoilers then don't
watch<00:03:13.450> so<00:03:14.020> what<00:03:14.170> I<00:03:14.200> didn't<00:03:14.650> like<00:03:14.710> is<00:03:15.160> where<00:03:15.400> the

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
watch so what I didn't like is where the

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.090 
watch so what I didn't like is where the
story<00:03:15.880> went<00:03:16.360> about<00:03:16.870> halfway<00:03:17.110> through<00:03:17.410> I

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
story went about halfway through I

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.280 
story went about halfway through I
thought<00:03:18.730> that<00:03:19.060> because<00:03:19.690> the<00:03:19.840> guy<00:03:19.960> was<00:03:20.140> acting

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
thought that because the guy was acting

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.260 
thought that because the guy was acting
really<00:03:20.740> creepy<00:03:21.130> and<00:03:21.160> stuff<00:03:21.550> that<00:03:21.790> Aaron<00:03:22.120> would

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:22.270 
really creepy and stuff that Aaron would

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:24.240 
really creepy and stuff that Aaron would
actually<00:03:22.600> end<00:03:22.720> up<00:03:22.810> dying<00:03:23.140> at<00:03:23.500> the<00:03:23.620> cabin<00:03:24.070> or

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
actually end up dying at the cabin or

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.640 
actually end up dying at the cabin or
whatever<00:03:24.640> originally<00:03:25.420> my<00:03:25.570> and<00:03:25.990> my<00:03:26.440> own

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
whatever originally my and my own

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.950 
whatever originally my and my own
thought<00:03:27.100> process<00:03:27.580> was<00:03:27.910> that<00:03:27.940> he<00:03:28.360> wants<00:03:28.630> him<00:03:28.780> to

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:28.960 
thought process was that he wants him to

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.870 
thought process was that he wants him to
report<00:03:29.350> him<00:03:29.650> doing<00:03:29.980> things<00:03:30.250> that<00:03:30.490> are<00:03:30.610> really

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
report him doing things that are really

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.510 
report him doing things that are really
weird<00:03:31.090> or<00:03:31.870> illegal<00:03:32.410> like<00:03:32.680> killing<00:03:33.070> someone<00:03:33.490> or

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:33.520 
weird or illegal like killing someone or

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.860 
weird or illegal like killing someone or
something<00:03:33.970> like<00:03:34.120> that<00:03:34.330> but<00:03:34.630> it<00:03:34.750> was

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
something like that but it was

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.170 
something like that but it was

00:05:29.469 --> 00:05:29.479 
falls over we would have seen blood

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:32.600 
falls over we would have seen blood
piling<00:05:30.479> on<00:05:30.569> the<00:05:30.659> floor<00:05:30.960> or<00:05:31.349> on<00:05:31.710> the<00:05:32.009> bench<00:05:32.280> or

00:05:35.149 --> 00:05:35.159 
something you see no blood so it's a

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:36.860 
something you see no blood so it's a
little<00:05:35.279> unrealistic<00:05:35.759> but<00:05:36.120> the<00:05:36.270> sound<00:05:36.509> and<00:05:36.779> the

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:36.870 
little unrealistic but the sound and the

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:38.990 
little unrealistic but the sound and the
visuals<00:05:37.289> of<00:05:37.469> it<00:05:37.620> looked<00:05:37.949> very<00:05:38.069> real<00:05:38.669> another

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.000 
visuals of it looked very real another

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.110 
visuals of it looked very real another
nitpicky<00:05:39.539> thing<00:05:39.750> is<00:05:40.080> he<00:05:40.500> uses<00:05:41.099> his<00:05:41.310> real<00:05:41.849> name

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:42.120 
nitpicky thing is he uses his real name

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.769 
nitpicky thing is he uses his real name
Joseph<00:05:42.449> with<00:05:43.349> Aaron<00:05:43.830> but<00:05:44.069> then<00:05:44.310> in<00:05:44.940> the<00:05:45.419> final

00:05:45.769 --> 00:05:45.779 
Joseph with Aaron but then in the final

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:48.050 
Joseph with Aaron but then in the final
moments<00:05:46.110> we<00:05:46.229> see<00:05:46.440> him<00:05:46.680> with<00:05:47.009> a<00:05:47.039> new<00:05:47.310> victim<00:05:47.699> and

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.060 
moments we see him with a new victim and

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.420 
moments we see him with a new victim and
he<00:05:48.300> calls<00:05:48.509> himself<00:05:48.659> Bill<00:05:49.169> so<00:05:49.770> is<00:05:50.130> he<00:05:50.279> always

Joseph is his real name because his

00:05:54.719 --> 00:05:56.600 
Joseph is his real name because his
