wait<00:03:08.980> for<00:03:09.280> it<00:03:11.310> yeah<00:03:12.310> that's<00:03:12.670> because<00:03:12.880> this<00:03:13.480> is

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
wait for it yeah that's because this is

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:18.000 
wait for it yeah that's because this is
it<00:03:13.780> 0<00:03:14.050> HP<00:03:15.270> usually<00:03:16.270> the<00:03:16.540> HP<00:03:17.020> beater<00:03:17.260> cracks<00:03:17.740> at

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
it 0 HP usually the HP beater cracks at

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:25.220 
it 0 HP usually the HP beater cracks at
0<00:03:18.400> HP<00:03:21.240> so<00:03:22.950> that's<00:03:23.950> the<00:03:24.070> glitch<00:03:24.250> with<00:03:24.430> Bowser

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
0 HP so that's the glitch with Bowser

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.450 
0 HP so that's the glitch with Bowser
you<00:03:26.230> can<00:03:26.380> also<00:03:26.560> perform<00:03:26.800> the<00:03:27.100> glitch<00:03:27.280> with

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:27.460 
you can also perform the glitch with

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:29.700 
you can also perform the glitch with
Wario<00:03:27.850> but<00:03:28.030> it<00:03:28.120> requires<00:03:28.510> three<00:03:29.170> players<00:03:29.440> to

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:29.710 
Wario but it requires three players to

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:32.490 
Wario but it requires three players to
perform<00:03:30.100> I<00:03:30.370> usually<00:03:31.270> use<00:03:31.450> Wario<00:03:31.870> snake<00:03:32.290> and

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
perform I usually use Wario snake and

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.410 
perform I usually use Wario snake and
somebody<00:03:32.830> else<00:03:32.980> but<00:03:33.670> demonstrating<00:03:34.360> it

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
somebody else but demonstrating it

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:39.780 
somebody else but demonstrating it
because<00:03:37.710> well<00:03:38.710> all<00:03:39.010> the<00:03:39.160> time<00:03:39.340> it<00:03:39.430> involves

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
because well all the time it involves

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:47.300 
because well all the time it involves
explosives<00:03:43.140> so<00:03:44.140> this<00:03:44.440> can<00:03:44.740> also<00:03:45.010> be<00:03:45.220> on<00:03:45.640> any

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
explosives so this can also be on any

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:52.020 
explosives so this can also be on any
stage<00:03:49.110> so<00:03:50.110> I<00:03:50.140> think<00:03:50.530> I'm<00:03:51.190> gonna<00:03:51.340> choose<00:03:51.610> final

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
stage so I think I'm gonna choose final

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:57.660 
stage so I think I'm gonna choose final
destination<00:03:52.960> again<00:03:55.710> three<00:03:56.710> players<00:03:57.040> smash

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
destination again three players smash

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:09.510 
destination again three players smash
balls<00:03:58.000> only<00:03:58.420> final<00:03:59.170> destination

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:09.520 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.370 

so<00:04:10.520> once<00:04:10.700> again<00:04:10.850> you<00:04:10.970> have<00:04:11.150> to<00:04:11.210> wait<00:04:11.540> for<00:04:11.750> Smash

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380 
so once again you have to wait for Smash

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:18.400 
so once again you have to wait for Smash
Ball

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410
