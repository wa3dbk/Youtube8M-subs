00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.870
 This is what you need to know 

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:05.110
 One day Jason was born. 

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:07.320
 He decided to make a car 

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:08.030
 Red Bull 

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:09.480
 Then check out youtube 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.860
 You may not know Red Bull 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:14.470
 Have side effects on eggs 

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:17.520
 Drinking red bull eggs will jump and jump and the brain will break. 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.540
 Jason’s brain is not good. 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.900
 Now because of the gossip of the Internet 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.560
 Let him lose control more 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.290
 He attacked others 

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:31.740
 nonsense 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:32.810
 The cake is lying 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:33.230
 what...... 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.800
 We can only send him to the madhouse 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.000
 We hope that he will recover quickly 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.090
 But this is not reliable 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.560
 Cake, cake? Double rainbow hides the little baby is lying lie 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.600
 Jason... 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.960
 Who are you, who are you? 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.360
 look here 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.950
 Anyone...hello? 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:02.970
 Who is there... who is there 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:04.940
 I 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:06.810
 what.... 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.120
 not true 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.270
 This guy is crazy 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.850
 Why do you think he is here? 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.090
 If not, can I do this? 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.950
 (panting) 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.650
 how did you do it 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.810
 Look at this 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.960
 Oh, your mom was at my house last night. 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:37.990
 Really? 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.180
 Yeah, I am making eggs with her. 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.240
 That is awkward 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.300
 (dark laughs) 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.160
 Have you forgotten the earliest time you were put in this way? 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:53.060
 La la la 

00:01:57.286 --> 00:01:58.216
 Do not! 

00:02:01.108 --> 00:02:02.838
 Do not! 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.550
 I got your long herpes. 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.750
 no no 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.210
 We cured your illness 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.610
 Do not...... 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.920
 The Easter Bunny is true! 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.180
 (Jason) - No, no! God, no. 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:25.220
 Don’t play at all, why is he doing? 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.180
 He was hypnotized 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.040
 How are we here (also drinking Red Bull crazy) 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.680
 brothers.... 

00:02:47.872 --> 00:02:49.723
