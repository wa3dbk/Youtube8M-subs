Apple in that's another story but going
on<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.239> this<00:00:48.329> microphone<00:00:48.600> it<00:00:49.140> is<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.879> absolute

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
on to this microphone it is a absolute

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.110 
on to this microphone it is a absolute
fantastic<00:00:51.090> microphone<00:00:51.600> it<00:00:52.550> enhances<00:00:53.550> very

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
fantastic microphone it enhances very

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.170 
fantastic microphone it enhances very
much<00:00:54.360> so<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:55.140> higher<00:00:55.680> frequencies<00:00:56.460> I<00:00:56.699> was

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
much so the higher frequencies I was

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.670 
much so the higher frequencies I was
trying<00:00:57.420> on<00:00:57.539> my<00:00:57.629> drum<00:00:57.840> kit<00:00:57.870> and<00:00:58.230> not

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
trying on my drum kit and not

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.729 
trying on my drum kit and not
recommended<00:00:58.949> because<00:00:59.250> it<00:00:59.430> is<00:00:59.550> so<00:00:59.969> sensitive

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739 
recommended because it is so sensitive

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:02.630 
recommended because it is so sensitive
it<00:01:01.739> picks<00:01:01.980> up<00:01:02.160> anything

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
it picks up anything

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.250 
it picks up anything
I<00:01:02.760> turned<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.090> game<00:01:03.210> right<00:01:03.690> down<00:01:03.899> and<00:01:04.170> it

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
I turned the game right down and it

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.800 
I turned the game right down and it
could<00:01:04.379> still<00:01:04.650> pick<00:01:04.979> up<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.450> really<00:01:06.450> good<00:01:06.600> amount

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
could still pick up a really good amount

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.200 
could still pick up a really good amount
night<00:01:07.080> and<00:01:07.320> you<00:01:07.439> can<00:01:07.560> see<00:01:07.710> again<00:01:08.780> about<00:01:10.909> 3/4<00:01:11.909> up

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.320 
EQ it's quite it's quite booster booster
low<00:02:07.320> and<00:02:07.590> it<00:02:08.040> kind<00:02:08.369> of<00:02:08.399> lifts<00:02:08.760> up<00:02:08.850> against<00:02:09.149> it's

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
quite a loudness effective but the high

quite a loudness effective but the high

the<00:02:16.380> vocals<00:02:16.890> in<00:02:17.130> my<00:02:17.490> opinion<00:02:17.940> the<00:02:18.780> bass<00:02:18.990> I

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
the vocals in my opinion the bass I

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.500 
the vocals in my opinion the bass I
don't<00:02:19.650> think<00:02:19.920> it<00:02:20.040> accommodates<00:02:20.610> bass<00:02:20.940> very

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
don't think it accommodates bass very

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.600 
don't think it accommodates bass very
well<00:02:22.020> and<00:02:22.350> even<00:02:23.160> though<00:02:23.220> it<00:02:23.280> is<00:02:23.370> a<00:02:23.400> big

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
well and even though it is a big

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.840 
well and even though it is a big
microphone<00:02:23.790> it<00:02:24.240> does<00:02:24.540> it<00:02:24.870> have<00:02:25.170> its<00:02:25.850> its

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
microphone it does it have its its

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.630 
microphone it does it have its its
weaknesses<00:02:27.510> as<00:02:27.810> all<00:02:28.140> microphones<00:02:28.709> do<00:02:28.920> like<00:02:29.490> I

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
weaknesses as all microphones do like I

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:30.920 
weaknesses as all microphones do like I
have<00:02:29.850> a<00:02:29.880> diaphragm<00:02:30.420> microphone<00:02:30.750> that's

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
have a diaphragm microphone that's

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.130 
have a diaphragm microphone that's
absolutely<00:02:31.830> fantastic<00:02:32.610> on<00:02:32.820> a<00:02:33.510> kick<00:02:33.750> drum<00:02:33.780> I'll

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
absolutely fantastic on a kick drum I'll

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.320 
absolutely fantastic on a kick drum I'll
review<00:02:34.560> this<00:02:34.769> another<00:02:35.010> time<00:02:35.310> and<00:02:35.550> it's

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
review this another time and it's

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.030 
review this another time and it's
actually<00:02:36.420> fantastic<00:02:36.690> on<00:02:37.140> the<00:02:37.230> kick<00:02:37.410> vocals

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
actually fantastic on the kick vocals

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.330 
actually fantastic on the kick vocals
but<00:02:38.550> it<00:02:38.670> sounds<00:02:38.940> horrific<00:02:39.120> on<00:02:39.860> guitars<00:02:40.860> and

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
but it sounds horrific on guitars and

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.190 
but it sounds horrific on guitars and
acoustic<00:02:41.970> guitars<00:02:42.239> but<00:02:42.420> this<00:02:42.630> disc<00:02:42.989> sounds

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
acoustic guitars but this disc sounds

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.720 
acoustic guitars but this disc sounds
fantastic<00:02:43.380> on<00:02:43.800> guitars<00:02:44.130> as<00:02:44.280> well<00:02:44.430> as<00:02:44.580> it

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
fantastic on guitars as well as it

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.070 
fantastic on guitars as well as it
enhances<00:02:44.910> for<00:02:45.390> high<00:02:45.510> frequencies<00:02:45.930> again

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
enhances for high frequencies again

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.229 
enhances for high frequencies again
gives<00:02:46.440> it<00:02:46.530> a<00:02:46.590> really<00:02:47.280> nice<00:02:47.550> crisp<00:02:47.910> sound

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
gives it a really nice crisp sound

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:48.650 
gives it a really nice crisp sound

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
microphone as you can see I'll show you

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.289 
microphone as you can see I'll show you
with<00:03:11.220> a<00:03:11.250> little<00:03:11.280> quick<00:03:11.580> video<00:03:11.700> now<00:03:12.030> a<00:03:12.060> bit

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
with a little quick video now a bit

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:14.750 
with a little quick video now a bit
close<00:03:12.540> up<00:03:12.780> and<00:03:12.900> so<00:03:13.650> basically<00:03:13.950> yeah<00:03:14.310> it's<00:03:14.549> just

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
close up and so basically yeah it's just

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.350 
close up and so basically yeah it's just
a<00:03:15.060> really<00:03:15.780> really<00:03:15.959> good<00:03:16.230> microphone<00:03:16.590> and

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
a really really good microphone and

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.520 
a really really good microphone and
unfortunately<00:03:18.360> there<00:03:18.510> are<00:03:18.660> downsides<00:03:18.959> to<00:03:19.410> it

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
unfortunately there are downsides to it

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.140 
unfortunately there are downsides to it
but<00:03:19.709> there<00:03:19.890> are<00:03:19.920> plus<00:03:20.250> sizes<00:03:20.610> that<00:03:20.730> downside

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
but there are plus sizes that downside

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.620 
but there are plus sizes that downside
as<00:03:21.239> well<00:03:21.420> and<00:03:21.630> as<00:03:22.320> you<00:03:22.530> can<00:03:22.940> probably<00:03:23.940> see<00:03:24.150> like

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
as well and as you can probably see like

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.259 
as well and as you can probably see like
on<00:03:24.780> now<00:03:24.959> there<00:03:25.799> is<00:03:25.920> a<00:03:25.950> box<00:03:26.220> and<00:03:26.670> that<00:03:27.030> you<00:03:27.150> can

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
on now there is a box and that you can

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:30.410 
on now there is a box and that you can
see<00:03:27.450> now<00:03:27.769> it's<00:03:28.769> all<00:03:29.250> that<00:03:29.489> is<00:03:29.640> is<00:03:29.790> basically<00:03:30.150> an

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
see now it's all that is is basically an

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.440 
see now it's all that is is basically an
extra<00:03:30.840> bit<00:03:30.989> of<00:03:31.019> power<00:03:31.440> to<00:03:32.040> it<00:03:32.070> so<00:03:32.459> but<00:03:33.000> because

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
extra bit of power to it so but because

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.610 
extra bit of power to it so but because
this<00:03:33.600> is<00:03:33.660> a<00:03:33.810> 6<00:03:34.290> 7<00:03:34.620> pin<00:03:35.010> XLR<00:03:35.780> it<00:03:36.780> doesn't<00:03:37.230> really

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
this is a 6 7 pin XLR it doesn't really

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.500 
this is a 6 7 pin XLR it doesn't really
can't<00:03:38.370> really<00:03:38.580> go<00:03:38.670> straight<00:03:39.000> into<00:03:39.150> a<00:03:39.240> mixing

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
can't really go straight into a mixing

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:40.430 
can't really go straight into a mixing
desk<00:03:39.569> it<00:03:39.870> has<00:03:39.990> to<00:03:40.110> go

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
desk it has to go

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.090 
desk it has to go
power<00:03:40.740> supply<00:03:41.130> and<00:03:41.580> in<00:03:41.940> a<00:03:42.840> 3-pin<00:03:43.260> XLR<00:03:43.380> into

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
power supply and in a 3-pin XLR into

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.190 
power supply and in a 3-pin XLR into
your<00:03:44.220> mixing<00:03:44.520> desk<00:03:44.760> interface<00:03:45.270> whatever<00:03:46.080> you

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
your mixing desk interface whatever you

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.270 
your mixing desk interface whatever you
have<00:03:46.520> so<00:03:47.520> basically<00:03:48.090> um<00:03:48.590> if<00:03:49.590> you<00:03:49.770> if<00:03:50.010> your

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
have so basically um if you if your

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.580 
have so basically um if you if your
interface<00:03:51.210> or<00:03:51.720> mixing<00:03:51.990> desk<00:03:52.200> doesn't<00:03:52.380> have

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
interface or mixing desk doesn't have

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.500 
interface or mixing desk doesn't have
phantom<00:03:52.950> power<00:03:53.160> and<00:03:53.400> you<00:03:53.790> need<00:03:53.970> to<00:03:54.060> condenser

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
phantom power and you need to condenser

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.180 
phantom power and you need to condenser
microphone<00:03:54.930> well<00:03:55.260> this<00:03:55.530> is<00:03:55.680> the<00:03:55.800> way<00:03:55.890> forward

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
microphone well this is the way forward

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:57.680 
microphone well this is the way forward
you<00:03:56.460> really<00:03:56.730> want<00:03:56.910> to<00:03:57.030> get<00:03:57.090> one<00:03:57.240> of<00:03:57.300> these<00:03:57.390> I

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
you really want to get one of these I

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.320 
you really want to get one of these I
have<00:03:58.410> phantom<00:03:58.770> power<00:03:58.950> on<00:03:59.190> my<00:03:59.340> Alesis<00:03:59.760> IO<00:03:59.970> to

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 
have phantom power on my Alesis IO to

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.970 
have phantom power on my Alesis IO to
express<00:04:00.990> which<00:04:01.830> and<00:04:02.160> and<00:04:02.670> it<00:04:03.300> has<00:04:03.510> yeah<00:04:04.470> and

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
express which and and it has yeah and

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.350 
express which and and it has yeah and
don't<00:04:05.310> need<00:04:05.490> an<00:04:05.640> actual<00:04:05.850> power<00:04:06.030> supply<00:04:06.300> for

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
don't need an actual power supply for

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.630 
don't need an actual power supply for
it's<00:04:06.630> great<00:04:06.840> that<00:04:07.020> interface<00:04:07.440> and<00:04:07.710> so<00:04:08.340> really

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
it's great that interface and so really

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.820 
it's great that interface and so really
I<00:04:09.060> could<00:04:09.870> have<00:04:09.990> done<00:04:10.170> with<00:04:10.410> something<00:04:10.770> a

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
I could have done with something a

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:11.900 
I could have done with something a
little<00:04:10.950> bit<00:04:11.130> different<00:04:11.460> than<00:04:11.550> this<00:04:11.670> when<00:04:11.880> I

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
little bit different than this when I

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:13.760 
little bit different than this when I
bought<00:04:12.150> it<00:04:12.180> and<00:04:12.390> I've<00:04:13.080> just<00:04:13.290> burn<00:04:13.500> that<00:04:13.530> in

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:13.770 
bought it and I've just burn that in

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:15.080 
bought it and I've just burn that in
mind<00:04:13.980> that<00:04:14.220> if<00:04:14.340> you<00:04:14.430> haven't<00:04:14.670> got<00:04:14.820> phantom

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
mind that if you haven't got phantom

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:16.550 
mind that if you haven't got phantom
power<00:04:15.240> and<00:04:15.540> you<00:04:15.630> need<00:04:15.780> condenser<00:04:16.260> this<00:04:16.350> way

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
power and you need condenser this way
