00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
for this game is pretty much just to

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.600 
for this game is pretty much just to
completely<00:01:10.470> mark<00:01:10.680> it<00:01:10.920> we<00:01:11.400> are<00:01:11.520> obviously

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
completely mark it we are obviously

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.130 
completely mark it we are obviously
going<00:01:11.970> to<00:01:12.030> be<00:01:12.119> focusing<00:01:12.299> on<00:01:12.570> PvE<00:01:12.900> content

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
going to be focusing on PvE content

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.080 
going to be focusing on PvE content
because<00:01:14.130> obviously<00:01:14.310> there's<00:01:14.640> seven<00:01:14.880> of<00:01:14.939> us

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
because obviously there's seven of us

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.179 
because obviously there's seven of us
and<00:01:15.150> five<00:01:15.750> is<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:15.960> group<00:01:16.170> size<00:01:16.439> so<00:01:16.799> it<00:01:17.070> would

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
and five is the group size so it would

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.950 
and five is the group size so it would
be<00:01:17.280> pretty<00:01:17.520> simple<00:01:17.820> we're<00:01:18.479> all<00:01:18.600> going<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:18.810> roll

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
be pretty simple we're all going to roll

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.179 
be pretty simple we're all going to roll
one<00:01:19.110> of<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.259> classes<00:01:19.680> and<00:01:19.890> stuff<00:01:20.009> like<00:01:20.130> this

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
one of the classes and stuff like this

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.499 
one of the classes and stuff like this
so<00:01:20.430> we'd<00:01:20.549> have<00:01:20.580> a<00:01:20.670> really<00:01:20.909> good<00:01:21.030> optimized

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
so we'd have a really good optimized

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.499 
so we'd have a really good optimized
group<00:01:21.750> set<00:01:21.960> up<00:01:22.080> so<00:01:22.740> that<00:01:22.770> covered<00:01:23.189> PVE<00:01:23.509> however

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
group set up so that covered PVE however

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.719 
group set up so that covered PVE however
when<00:01:24.659> it<00:01:24.689> came<00:01:24.869> to<00:01:25.020> pvp<00:01:25.619> and<00:01:25.830> obviously<00:01:26.520> the

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
when it came to pvp and obviously the

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.850 
when it came to pvp and obviously the
political<00:01:27.180> system<00:01:27.360> we<00:01:28.140> realize<00:01:28.439> we're<00:01:28.650> kind

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
political system we realize we're kind

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.920 
political system we realize we're kind
of<00:01:29.250> screwed<00:01:29.490> because<00:01:30.060> there's<00:01:30.869> only

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
of screwed because there's only
