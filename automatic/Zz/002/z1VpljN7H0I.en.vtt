you did the latch out over here safe

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.020 
you did the latch out over here safe
center<00:02:20.290> latch<00:02:20.530> is<00:02:21.130> what<00:02:21.310> they<00:02:21.430> call<00:02:21.670> this<00:02:21.820> make

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
center latch is what they call this make

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.060 
center latch is what they call this make
it<00:02:22.150> that<00:02:22.300> note<00:02:22.480> right<00:02:22.720> there<00:02:22.750> this<00:02:23.590> big<00:02:23.800> button

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
it that note right there this big button

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.130 
it that note right there this big button
that<00:02:24.310> allows<00:02:24.460> you<00:02:24.760> to<00:02:24.790> loosen<00:02:25.330> it<00:02:25.420> you<00:02:25.810> pull

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
that allows you to loosen it you pull

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.020 
that allows you to loosen it you pull
right<00:02:26.350> here<00:02:26.410> to<00:02:26.740> tighten<00:02:27.010> but<00:02:27.520> it<00:02:27.610> keeps<00:02:27.790> all

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
right here to tighten but it keeps all

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.360 
right here to tighten but it keeps all
the<00:02:28.270> latch<00:02:28.600> belt<00:02:29.380> right<00:02:29.740> here<00:02:29.920> in<00:02:30.010> the<00:02:30.100> center

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
the latch belt right here in the center

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:31.800 
the latch belt right here in the center
so<00:02:30.460> that's<00:02:30.580> why<00:02:30.700> they<00:02:30.880> call<00:02:30.910> it<00:02:31.090> safe<00:02:31.570> center

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
so that's why they call it safe center

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.390 
so that's why they call it safe center
latch<00:02:32.080> right<00:02:32.500> there<00:02:32.740> so<00:02:32.890> they're<00:02:33.070> not<00:02:33.190> in<00:02:33.310> the

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
latch right there so they're not in the
