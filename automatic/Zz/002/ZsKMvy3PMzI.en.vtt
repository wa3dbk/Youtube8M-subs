that are new to the game it's actually a

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.029 
that are new to the game it's actually a
challenge<00:00:56.370> which<00:00:56.760> kind<00:00:57.059> of<00:00:57.800> although<00:00:58.800> there's

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
challenge which kind of although there's

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.729 
challenge which kind of although there's
no<00:00:59.190> real<00:00:59.399> lasting<00:01:00.030> reward<00:01:00.480> from<00:01:00.629> it<00:01:00.840> I<00:01:01.020> like<00:01:01.590> it

no real lasting reward from it I like it

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.410 
no real lasting reward from it I like it
because<00:01:01.859> it<00:01:02.129> reminds<00:01:02.430> me<00:01:02.550> of<00:01:02.670> how<00:01:02.910> vanilla

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
because it reminds me of how vanilla

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.469 
because it reminds me of how vanilla
used<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.780> be<00:01:03.899> where<00:01:04.470> it<00:01:04.589> was<00:01:04.769> just<00:01:05.299> pretty<00:01:06.299> much

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
used to be where it was just pretty much

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.420 
used to be where it was just pretty much
difficult<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:07.200> actually<00:01:07.320> just<00:01:07.860> queue<00:01:08.220> for

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
difficult to actually just queue for

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.620 
difficult to actually just queue for
random<00:01:08.700> battlegrounds<00:01:09.180> you<00:01:09.240> should<00:01:09.450> play

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
random battlegrounds you should play

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.250 
random battlegrounds you should play
against<00:01:09.960> good<00:01:10.110> players<00:01:10.260> so<00:01:11.960> it<00:01:12.960> makes<00:01:13.140> it

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
against good players so it makes it

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.130 
against good players so it makes it
harder<00:01:13.590> it<00:01:14.369> definitely<00:01:14.850> takes<00:01:15.390> longer<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:16.020> get

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
harder it definitely takes longer to get

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.880 
harder it definitely takes longer to get
good<00:01:16.380> footage<00:01:16.799> for<00:01:17.009> you<00:01:17.070> guys

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.390 

but<00:01:20.580> it's<00:01:21.060> way<00:01:21.450> more<00:01:21.479> fun<00:01:21.860> I've<00:01:22.860> also<00:01:23.130> noticed

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
but it's way more fun I've also noticed

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.399 
but it's way more fun I've also noticed
that<00:01:23.700> there<00:01:24.360> are<00:01:24.390> some<00:01:24.690> classes<00:01:25.140> that<00:01:25.290> are<00:01:25.380> a

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
that there are some classes that are a

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.480 
that there are some classes that are a
lot<00:01:25.650> better<00:01:27.409> monks<00:01:28.409> with<00:01:28.800> the<00:01:28.950> new<00:01:29.070> a<00:01:29.100> we

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
lot better monks with the new a we

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.030 
lot better monks with the new a we
disarm<00:01:29.909> that<00:01:30.150> thing<00:01:30.630> is<00:01:30.780> just<00:01:30.900> just<00:01:31.770> too<00:01:31.890> much

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
disarm that thing is just just too much

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.810 
disarm that thing is just just too much
annoying<00:01:33.530> they<00:01:34.530> really<00:01:34.710> buff<00:01:34.979> warlocks<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.670> lot

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
annoying they really buff warlocks a lot

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:36.980 
annoying they really buff warlocks a lot
I've<00:01:36.090> noticed<00:01:36.450> that<00:01:36.509> I<00:01:36.630> was<00:01:36.720> really

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
I've noticed that I was really

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.090 
I've noticed that I was really
surprising<00:01:37.380> that<00:01:38.090> but<00:01:39.440> put<00:01:40.440> the<00:01:40.530> changes<00:01:40.950> with

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
surprising that but put the changes with

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.030 
surprising that but put the changes with
robes<00:01:41.430> I<00:01:42.330> was<00:01:43.110> expecting<00:01:43.320> when<00:01:43.619> I<00:01:43.770> was<00:01:43.890> eating

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
robes I was expecting when I was eating

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.649 
robes I was expecting when I was eating
the<00:01:44.130> patch<00:01:44.310> notes<00:01:44.340> I<00:01:44.820> guess<00:01:45.060> it<00:01:45.180> just<00:01:45.210> sounded

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
the patch notes I guess it just sounded

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.600 
the patch notes I guess it just sounded
like<00:01:45.840> a<00:01:45.900> lot<00:01:46.110> better<00:01:46.259> on<00:01:46.380> paper<00:01:46.619> but<00:01:47.130> I<00:01:47.369> was

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
like a lot better on paper but I was

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.850 
like a lot better on paper but I was
expecting<00:01:47.940> like<00:01:48.380> the<00:01:49.380> class<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:49.740> be

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
expecting like the class to be

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.469 
expecting like the class to be
ridiculously<00:01:50.490> overpowered<00:01:50.880> which<00:01:51.300> it's

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
ridiculously overpowered which it's

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.020 
ridiculously overpowered which it's
really<00:01:51.920> it's<00:01:52.920> not<00:01:53.160> I<00:01:53.399> mean<00:01:53.580> it's<00:01:53.729> definitely

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
really it's not I mean it's definitely

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.580 
really it's not I mean it's definitely
better<00:01:54.180> but<00:01:54.600> it's<00:01:54.990> not<00:01:56.090> as<00:01:57.090> drastic<00:01:58.020> as<00:01:58.440> I

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
better but it's not as drastic as I

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.469 
better but it's not as drastic as I
thought<00:01:58.860> it<00:01:58.979> would<00:01:59.009> be<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.490> also<00:01:59.880> warriors

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
thought it would be and also warriors

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.510 
thought it would be and also warriors
really<00:02:00.810> didn't<00:02:01.050> get<00:02:01.289> like<00:02:01.530> nerfed<00:02:02.070> into<00:02:02.430> the

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
really didn't get like nerfed into the

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.499 
really didn't get like nerfed into the
ground<00:02:02.810> the<00:02:03.810> way<00:02:04.020> that<00:02:04.880> like<00:02:05.880> you<00:02:06.119> would<00:02:06.240> think

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
ground the way that like you would think
