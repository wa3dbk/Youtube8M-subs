but<00:00:47.059> the<00:00:48.110> CPM<00:00:49.110> using<00:00:49.440> is<00:00:49.530> an<00:00:49.680> i5<00:00:50.100> quad<00:00:50.940> core<00:00:52.399> 2.8

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
but the CPM using is an i5 quad core 2.8

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.279 
but the CPM using is an i5 quad core 2.8
gigahertz<00:00:53.699> but<00:00:54.120> it<00:00:54.180> will<00:00:54.270> be<00:00:54.300> hyper<00:00:54.660> threaded

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
gigahertz but it will be hyper threaded

gigahertz but it will be hyper threaded
and<00:00:55.530> overclocked<00:00:56.390> got<00:00:57.390> a<00:00:57.420> bigger<00:00:57.690> cooling

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
and overclocked got a bigger cooling

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.229 
and overclocked got a bigger cooling
system<00:00:58.590> coming<00:00:58.800> for<00:00:59.100> it<00:00:59.160> in<00:00:59.489> custom<00:00:59.910> building

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
system coming for it in custom building

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.110 
system coming for it in custom building
that<00:01:00.530> it<00:01:01.530> was<00:01:01.739> for<00:01:02.160> this<00:01:02.280> I<00:01:02.489> need<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.699> new<00:01:02.879> hard

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
that it was for this I need a new hard

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.670 
that it was for this I need a new hard
drive<00:01:03.300> and<00:01:03.480> hard<00:01:04.049> drives<00:01:04.229> are<00:01:04.379> coming

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
drive and hard drives are coming

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.920 
drive and hard drives are coming
becoming<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:05.640> little<00:01:05.790> more<00:01:05.909> expensive<00:01:06.570> because

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
becoming a little more expensive because

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.950 
becoming a little more expensive because
it<00:01:07.290> will<00:01:07.380> hold<00:01:07.560> Taiwan<00:01:08.010> flood<00:01:08.340> and<00:01:08.490> all<00:01:08.549> that

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
it will hold Taiwan flood and all that

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:14.410 
it will hold Taiwan flood and all that
so<00:01:10.490> this<00:01:11.490> is<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:12.030> information<00:01:12.570> on<00:01:12.780> this<00:01:13.229> a

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
original price was 159 picked up for a

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.870 
original price was 159 picked up for a
lot<00:01:21.990> less<00:01:22.140> than<00:01:22.350> that<00:01:22.470> but<00:01:23.369> here's<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.670> actual

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
lot less than that but here's the actual

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.490 
lot less than that but here's the actual
hard<00:01:24.210> drive<00:01:24.420> that's<00:01:24.570> in<00:01:24.780> its<00:01:25.080> western<00:01:25.470> digital

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
hard drive that's in its western digital

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.899 
hard drive that's in its western digital
also<00:01:26.659> but<00:01:29.119> see<00:01:30.119> if<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.360> enclosure<00:01:30.720> is<00:01:31.020> like

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:31.909 
also but see if the enclosure is like

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:35.510 
also but see if the enclosure is like
etc<00:01:32.909> on<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.329> back<00:01:33.650> USB<00:01:34.650> power<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:35.250> all<00:01:35.340> that

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
etc on the back USB power and all that

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.600 
etc on the back USB power and all that
but<00:01:36.450> let's<00:01:37.439> take<00:01:37.740> a<00:01:37.770> look<00:01:37.979> what's<00:01:38.159> inside<00:01:38.340> it

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
but let's take a look what's inside it

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.310 
but let's take a look what's inside it
took<00:01:38.790> a<00:01:38.880> while<00:01:39.000> to<00:01:39.060> get<00:01:39.299> this<00:01:39.450> open<00:01:39.840> but<00:01:40.049> now

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
took a while to get this open but now

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:47.109 
took a while to get this open but now
that<00:01:40.560> have<00:01:40.710> it<00:01:40.829> open<00:01:41.159> it's<00:01:41.340> easier<00:01:44.000> did<00:01:45.000> you

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
that have it open it's easier did you

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:50.389 
that have it open it's easier did you
moving<00:01:48.530> you<00:01:49.530> just<00:01:49.740> have<00:01:49.890> a<00:01:49.920> shell<00:01:50.220> on<00:01:50.250> the

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
moving you just have a shell on the

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.870 
moving you just have a shell on the
outside<00:01:50.549> and<00:01:51.180> to<00:01:51.979> get<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.130> hard<00:01:53.340> drive<00:01:53.399> on<00:01:53.579> the

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
outside and to get the hard drive on the

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.560 
outside and to get the hard drive on the
inside<00:01:55.189> it's<00:01:56.189> actually<00:01:56.610> quite<00:01:56.759> easy<00:01:56.850> with<00:01:57.360> our

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
inside it's actually quite easy with our

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.240 
inside it's actually quite easy with our
drive<00:01:57.840> to<00:01:57.869> if<00:01:58.170> you<00:01:58.290> look<00:01:58.500> in<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.829> corners

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
drive to if you look in the corners

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.690 
drive to if you look in the corners
there's<00:01:59.520> pieces<00:01:59.820> rubber<00:02:00.689> and<00:02:01.340> all<00:02:02.340> I<00:02:02.399> have<00:02:02.610> to

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
there's pieces rubber and all I have to

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.810 
there's pieces rubber and all I have to
do<00:02:02.909> is<00:02:03.090> push<00:02:03.540> it<00:02:03.780> out<00:02:04.020> of<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.680> frame<00:02:04.920> the

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
do is push it out of the frame the

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.760 
do is push it out of the frame the
motherboard<00:02:06.270> is<00:02:06.450> Ed<00:02:06.780> sorry<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.409> control

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
motherboard is Ed sorry the control

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.350 
motherboard is Ed sorry the control
board<00:02:07.950> is<00:02:08.069> actually<00:02:08.489> attached<00:02:08.729> to<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.239> high

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
board is actually attached to the high

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:09.980 
board is actually attached to the high
dive

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
dive

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.040 
dive
so<00:02:10.800> you<00:02:10.860> just<00:02:11.100> gently<00:02:11.520> push<00:02:12.090> on<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:12.510> plastic

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
so you just gently push on the plastic

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.950 
so you just gently push on the plastic
frame<00:02:13.820> and<00:02:15.110> that's<00:02:16.110> it<00:02:16.350> I<00:02:16.650> got<00:02:17.430> to<00:02:17.520> keep<00:02:17.640> the

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:17.960 
frame and that's it I got to keep the

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.330 
frame and that's it I got to keep the
