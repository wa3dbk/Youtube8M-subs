iphone 5 with iOS 7 beta for now is
there<00:00:06.750> a<00:00:06.779> major<00:00:07.020> difference<00:00:07.290> in<00:00:07.620> terms<00:00:07.859> of<00:00:08.040> the

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
there a major difference in terms of the

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.330 
there a major difference in terms of the
camera<00:00:08.519> app<00:00:08.670> compared<00:00:09.120> to<00:00:09.360> earlier<00:00:10.340> releases

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
camera app compared to earlier releases

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.509 
camera app compared to earlier releases
like<00:00:11.670> beta<00:00:11.910> 3<00:00:12.330> no<00:00:12.809> actually<00:00:13.410> not<00:00:13.559> but<00:00:14.190> there<00:00:14.490> is

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
like beta 3 no actually not but there is

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.310 
like beta 3 no actually not but there is
the<00:00:15.210> tiny<00:00:15.480> difference<00:00:15.929> and<00:00:16.139> it<00:00:16.199> could

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
the tiny difference and it could

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.189 
the tiny difference and it could
actually<00:00:16.440> be<00:00:16.590> two<00:00:16.949> things<00:00:17.760> that<00:00:18.180> they<00:00:18.869> have

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
actually be two things that they have

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.109 
actually be two things that they have
changed<00:00:19.680> so<00:00:20.220> the<00:00:20.400> first<00:00:20.550> thing<00:00:20.640> is<00:00:20.880> that<00:00:21.029> you

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
changed so the first thing is that you

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.460 
changed so the first thing is that you
can<00:00:21.180> see<00:00:21.420> that<00:00:21.570> HDR<00:00:22.439> mode<00:00:22.500> is<00:00:23.430> now<00:00:23.670> on<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.000> top

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:24.470 
can see that HDR mode is now on the top

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.519 
can see that HDR mode is now on the top
instead<00:00:25.470> of<00:00:25.529> being<00:00:26.460> at<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:26.880> bottom<00:00:27.529> earlier

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
instead of being at the bottom earlier

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.749 
instead of being at the bottom earlier
it<00:00:28.800> was<00:00:28.830> below<00:00:29.580> this<00:00:29.939> one<00:00:30.210> so<00:00:31.340> now<00:00:32.340> you<00:00:32.610> take

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
it was below this one so now you take

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:47.410 
it was below this one so now you take
pictures<00:00:33.030> let's<00:00:33.780> see<00:00:33.930> here<00:00:37.579> see<00:00:38.579> here<00:00:39.920> see<00:00:45.379> use

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
pictures let's see here see here see use

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:56.060 
pictures let's see here see here see use
this<00:00:49.250> see<00:00:50.250> here<00:00:51.559> take<00:00:52.559> that<00:00:52.800> gun<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:55.039> now<00:00:56.039> i

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
this see here take that gun and now i

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.610 
this see here take that gun and now i
have<00:00:56.250> HDR<00:00:56.850> mode<00:00:56.879> off<00:00:57.329> i<00:00:57.719> think<00:00:58.289> that<00:00:58.410> when<00:00:58.530> you

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
have HDR mode off i think that when you

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.430 
have HDR mode off i think that when you
have<00:00:58.770> on<00:00:58.920> it<00:00:59.370> could<00:00:59.489> take<00:00:59.640> a<00:00:59.699> little<00:00:59.879> longer

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
have on it could take a little longer

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.830 
have on it could take a little longer
but<00:01:01.440> is<00:01:01.620> he<00:01:01.920> thinking<00:01:02.399> and<00:01:02.670> it<00:01:03.449> should<00:01:03.629> take<00:01:03.809> a

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
but is he thinking and it should take a

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.289 
but is he thinking and it should take a
better<00:01:04.500> picture<00:01:04.799> you<00:01:05.790> also<00:01:06.030> have<00:01:06.150> these

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
better picture you also have these

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.050 
better picture you also have these
filters<00:01:06.659> of<00:01:07.020> course<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:07.710> that<00:01:08.460> i've<00:01:08.850> also

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
filters of course and that i've also

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.820 
filters of course and that i've also
heard<00:01:09.330> that<00:01:09.390> they<00:01:09.659> could<00:01:09.990> have<00:01:10.110> updated<00:01:10.530> in

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
heard that they could have updated in

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.450 
heard that they could have updated in

app<00:01:23.729> is<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:25.009> changing<00:01:26.509> from<00:01:27.509> various<00:01:28.490> things

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
app is and changing from various things

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.810 
app is and changing from various things
over<00:01:29.790> here<00:01:31.369> like<00:01:32.369> various<00:01:32.700> filters<00:01:33.000> such<00:01:34.820> like

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
over here like various filters such like

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.800 
over here like various filters such like
this<00:01:36.390> one's<00:01:36.630> called<00:01:36.930> tomo<00:01:38.570> and<00:01:39.570> then<00:01:39.720> of

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
this one's called tomo and then of

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.620 
this one's called tomo and then of
course<00:01:39.869> if<00:01:40.380> you<00:01:40.530> would<00:01:40.740> use<00:01:40.950> Instagram<00:01:41.630> then

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
course if you would use Instagram then

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.780 
course if you would use Instagram then
you<00:01:42.840> would<00:01:42.990> have<00:01:43.020> you<00:01:43.290> more<00:01:43.619> filters<00:01:44.430> over

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
you would have you more filters over

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.399 
you would have you more filters over
there<00:01:44.970> whatever<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.630> take<00:01:45.780> it's<00:01:45.990> likely<00:01:46.320> at

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
there whatever to take it's likely at

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.550 
Tweety's and also that the iphone 4s now
has<00:01:50.070> a<00:01:50.399> filter<00:01:51.000> feature<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:51.780> that<00:01:52.229> didn't

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
has a filter feature and that didn't

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.240 
has a filter feature and that didn't
have<00:01:52.680> that<00:01:52.860> before<00:01:53.009> and<00:01:54.020> of<00:01:55.020> course<00:01:55.079> that<00:01:55.680> was

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
have that before and of course that was

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.609 
have that before and of course that was
pretty<00:01:56.460> random<00:01:57.049> but<00:01:58.049> that's<00:01:58.229> basically<00:01:58.350> the

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
pretty random but that's basically the

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.679 
pretty random but that's basically the
updates<00:01:59.070> you<00:01:59.310> can<00:01:59.340> also<00:01:59.549> see<00:01:59.790> here<00:02:00.030> also<00:02:00.210> if

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
updates you can also see here also if

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.859 
updates you can also see here also if
you<00:02:00.990> have<00:02:01.200> any<00:02:01.610> performance<00:02:02.610> issues<00:02:02.969> with

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
you have any performance issues with

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.929 
you have any performance issues with
earlier<00:02:04.290> you<00:02:04.799> still<00:02:05.040> have<00:02:05.250> that<00:02:05.280> video<00:02:05.610> mode

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
earlier you still have that video mode

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.070 
earlier you still have that video mode
you'll<00:02:06.390> get<00:02:06.540> that<00:02:06.659> number

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
you'll get that number

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.490 
you'll get that number
our<00:02:07.140> fact<00:02:07.700> see<00:02:08.700> here<00:02:08.970> if<00:02:09.119> you<00:02:09.270> go<00:02:09.540> change<00:02:10.050> next

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
our fact see here if you go change next

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.350 
our fact see here if you go change next
square<00:02:11.190> mode<00:02:11.430> I<00:02:11.670> think<00:02:11.910> this<00:02:12.030> is<00:02:12.090> for

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
square mode I think this is for

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.190 
square mode I think this is for
Instagram<00:02:13.040> but<00:02:14.040> I<00:02:14.100> can't<00:02:14.460> tell<00:02:14.790> for<00:02:15.390> sure<00:02:15.450> like

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
Instagram but I can't tell for sure like

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.920 
Instagram but I can't tell for sure like
one<00:02:16.620> hundred<00:02:16.950> percent<00:02:17.210> still<00:02:18.210> the<00:02:18.270> panorama

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
one hundred percent still the panorama

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.950 
one hundred percent still the panorama
mode<00:02:19.110> here<00:02:19.530> is<00:02:19.800> over<00:02:20.400> here<00:02:20.670> you<00:02:21.480> can<00:02:21.630> see<00:02:21.780> it's

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
mode here is over here you can see it's

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.650 
mode here is over here you can see it's
going<00:02:22.080> to<00:02:22.140> cool<00:02:22.460> you<00:02:23.460> are<00:02:23.640> here<00:02:24.030> which<00:02:24.390> can

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
going to cool you are here which can

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.170 
going to cool you are here which can
