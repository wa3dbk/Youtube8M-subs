00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.060
 here we are again looking at this here 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.550
 says that this is the suicide jump 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:12.360
 let's see jumping excellent we're going to 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:14.670
 see how cool suicide how horrible that 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.320
 it's curiosity I am and it's something very 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:21.170
 dark something very very sad something 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.700
 tenebrous rather we jump in the head 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:26.080
 the enemies 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:28.210
 as is saying let's jump in the head 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.039
 here he told me he could jump on the 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:33.160
 head of them and it was true 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:35.860
 he did not lie to me but 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:38.080
 oysters we have to climb up there 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.570
 because this is something very precise we have 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:43.560
 to do it in this very moment that 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:46.690
 precious salt 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:48.370
 I do not like to wait to see well 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:53.980
 who I estimate metric of a kiss in 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:57.070
 visit but you expect what it seemed 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:59.230
 be perfect excellent and let's go jumping 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.490
 at this very moment we have to be 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:05.610
 very pas 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:09.770
 nice let's go this we already know that 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.770
 here is not that nasty brick 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:16.070
 here we already know we have to continue 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.260
 go ahead without going back because this 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:21.780
 it was greed we really want to 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:24.830
 money and that's why we die this time we're going 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.830
 forward without 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.870
 as rays here what this was not 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:37.900
 as if come fast man 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:42.020
 I just want to let go in your head 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:47.470
 is beautiful ciao See kill yourself 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:47.470
 idiot now let's go though perfect 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:51.750
 It stands in the currency 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.860
 here we stand in this regard for 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:04.110
 other side 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.110
 the flag of those that we go forward 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:11.290
 and there is the response to the forces 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.480
 that we have to stop in some coins 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.220
 secret or see how much we have to 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.850
 measure it calculate mathematics action 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.850
 The science 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:28.730
 let's make this is one that I already know which 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:33.690
 is the other one is this 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:36.720
 I am the adventurer of the world 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:40.950
 It matters little when a woman likes me 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:45.900
 I like it despite everything I liked that 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:49.080
 much remains that perfect is that already 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:51.920
 I know what that is perfect, I already have the 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:55.940
 measure the perfect and exact calculation 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:59.790
 it was not that was the previous 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:03.000
 what is ahead of me is that I can not 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:06.560
 give a very very good jump are my 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.560
 jumps are disgustingly 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:12.569
 very fast here was excellent we already know 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.569
 what is this 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.120
 If I wanted to get to 99 I really like that 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.310
 number 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.740
 here it was already with patience with the 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.260
 measured flying as superhero as the 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:27.190
 spider man jumping reaching the 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:29.650
 adventures we go we strongly jumped that 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.370
 it was very fast that we did it here it was 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:35.410
 have here was my son yes sir 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.480
 excellent death death 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:40.060
 had to reach 100 that we already have to 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:43.380
 to be a little more patient is excellent 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.380
 because we are not ahead 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:50.730
 terrible when you know what it is that 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:53.190
 you have to do and it's difficult to do here 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:56.730
 I can feel in the soul in the 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:04:00.570
 excellent heart very beautiful lovely 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:03.500
 here we come to the perfect unit the 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:08.180
 low faith path 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:12.160
 if we are that we arrive that does not matter 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.160
 that I care that we die 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.490
 and because the flag did not work 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:30.730
 last time is I want to make a little one 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:34.300
 that we are walking with faith perfectly 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:38.610
 we are invincible immortal perfect 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:42.700
 we arrived yes please this time yes 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:45.270
 excellent excellent good but they would have 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:48.550
 enjoyed this misery of this hell 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:51.240
 we're going for the next blessings 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.240
 bye
