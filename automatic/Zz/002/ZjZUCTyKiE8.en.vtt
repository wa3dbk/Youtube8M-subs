have another piece of that material

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.910 
have another piece of that material
laying<00:01:04.289> around<00:01:04.439> -<00:01:04.829> let<00:01:05.369> me<00:01:05.459> go<00:01:05.549> take<00:01:05.789> a<00:01:05.819> look

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
laying around - let me go take a look

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.749 
laying around - let me go take a look
then<00:01:07.920> we're<00:01:08.039> gonna<00:01:08.130> do<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.369> side-by-side

00:01:08.749 --> 00:01:08.759 
then we're gonna do a side-by-side

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:11.359 
then we're gonna do a side-by-side
comparison<00:01:09.240> to<00:01:10.200> see<00:01:10.409> how<00:01:10.590> much<00:01:10.799> thinner<00:01:11.159> this

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
comparison to see how much thinner this

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:18.289 
comparison to see how much thinner this
materialism<00:01:15.740> we<00:01:16.740> can<00:01:16.920> see<00:01:17.130> that<00:01:17.399> the<00:01:17.490> GT<00:01:17.849> Pro

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
materialism we can see that the GT Pro

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:26.330 
materialism we can see that the GT Pro
is<00:01:18.569> thinner<00:01:19.200> than<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.950> newer<00:01:20.130> GT<00:01:20.399> 110

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.280
