00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:11.510
 hello corner friends reading 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:12.920
 comments on facebook I realized that 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:15.410
 there are many people who do not know how to do 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.420
 braid of 3 so in this video they 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:20.740
 I'm going to teach how to make the braid of 3 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:24.680
 I'm doing it with hundreds of 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:27.349
 sweaty leathers that more or less have 5 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.419
 approximate millimeters and it is very easy to 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:33.890
 make good the middle tiento goes to 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:35.750
 go right over one now the 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:39.800
 time on the left will happen at 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:41.329
 center under 1 we would have the braid of 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.429
 this form 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:46.129
 now the fifth one that is further behind is going to 

00:00:43.429 --> 00:00:48.490
 be below one and it will happen to the 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:51.040
 center 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:53.910
 now that it is further behind it does below 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.680
 from one and go to the center 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.380
 we always close so that it remains 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.340
 adjusted the one from further back goes underneath 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.340
 from one goes to the center 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.600
 so does the one on the left 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.300
 now the one on the right 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.530
 now the one on the left 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:25.290
 the one on the right as you can see is very 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:27.840
 easy we are always accommodating the 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.030
 tientos for this Spiritist to be formed 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.500
 and the braid is neat 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.660
 now if I explain myself one more time always 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.550
 the touch that is further back and towards 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.210
 up towards us will go through 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:40.540
 under one 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:42.820
 and will go to the center now s this one happens 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.800
 below 1 and goes to the center 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.630
 we are always arranging the reds for 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:50.329
 that are not mounted or broken 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.729
 good and this is the braid of 3 very 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:55.909
 simple and very easy as we finish it 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:58.399
 Well, primates will depend on 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:01.340
 what are we going to occupy the experience like this 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:04.039
 that each auction will go to the ingenuity of 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:07.869
 we can finish it in a ring or 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:10.759
 we can or we can take one 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:12.620
 visit that depends on what they are going to 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.360
 use good friends of the hostage where the 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.580
 back here was finished a half more like 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.440
 I always say you already know if the video 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.120
 it seemed useful they liked it like 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.010
 they have a like and it is very important that 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.920
 leave your likes leave your comments 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.630
 suggestions for upcoming videos and we 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.459
 we see in the next video corner the 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.459
 backpacker a hug back and a half chau
