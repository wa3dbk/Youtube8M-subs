00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.280 
look I'm doing it so please will
as<00:02:11.799> well<00:02:12.040> I<00:02:12.310> think<00:02:12.730> the<00:02:13.060> realization<00:02:13.959> is<00:02:14.140> that

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
as well I think the realization is that

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:15.899 
as well I think the realization is that
this<00:02:14.439> is<00:02:14.560> something<00:02:14.799> that<00:02:15.010> every<00:02:15.519> single

00:02:15.899 --> 00:02:15.909 
this is something that every single

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:19.530 
this is something that every single
member<00:02:16.090> of<00:02:16.299> the<00:02:16.480> church<00:02:16.950> can<00:02:17.950> do<00:02:18.400> can<00:02:19.150> engage

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
member of the church can do can engage

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.589 
member of the church can do can engage
with<00:02:20.189> although<00:02:21.189> for<00:02:21.790> many<00:02:21.969> of<00:02:22.209> our<00:02:22.359> members

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599 
with although for many of our members

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:25.589 
with although for many of our members
they<00:02:23.530> don't<00:02:23.709> believe<00:02:24.010> that<00:02:24.040> yet<00:02:24.489> and<00:02:24.790> so<00:02:25.450> there

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:25.599 
they don't believe that yet and so there

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:29.819 
they don't believe that yet and so there
is<00:02:25.719> a<00:02:25.750> huge<00:02:26.790> responsibility<00:02:27.840> on<00:02:28.840> members<00:02:29.680> of

congregation to engage with it's

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:06.360 
congregation to engage with it's
absolutely<00:03:03.760> essential<00:03:04.569> I<00:03:05.230> think<00:03:05.560> I<00:03:05.829> think

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
absolutely essential I think I think

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.420 
absolutely essential I think I think
that<00:03:06.579> as<00:03:07.150> clear<00:03:07.780> to<00:03:07.989> need<00:03:08.290> to<00:03:08.530> model<00:03:08.980> what<00:03:09.159> we

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
that as clear to need to model what we

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.629 
that as clear to need to model what we
would<00:03:09.790> like<00:03:09.939> other<00:03:10.209> people<00:03:10.599> to<00:03:10.780> be<00:03:10.930> doing<00:03:11.290> and

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:11.639 
would like other people to be doing and

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:14.099 
would like other people to be doing and
from<00:03:12.639> my<00:03:12.819> point<00:03:13.000> of<00:03:13.209> view<00:03:13.269> I<00:03:13.419> found<00:03:13.780> it<00:03:13.900> quite<00:03:14.019> a

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:14.109 
from my point of view I found it quite a

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:16.050 
from my point of view I found it quite a
challenge<00:03:14.680> because<00:03:14.859> it's<00:03:15.159> very<00:03:15.400> easy<00:03:15.669> as<00:03:15.940> a

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
challenge because it's very easy as a

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.039 
challenge because it's very easy as a
clergy<00:03:16.299> person<00:03:16.690> to<00:03:18.359> encourage<00:03:19.359> our<00:03:19.569> churches

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049 
clergy person to encourage our churches

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:21.659 
clergy person to encourage our churches
to<00:03:20.199> do<00:03:20.319> things<00:03:20.560> but<00:03:20.709> not<00:03:20.919> to<00:03:21.099> actually<00:03:21.430> do<00:03:21.519> them

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:21.669 
to do things but not to actually do them

00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:24.390 
to do things but not to actually do them
ourselves<00:03:21.819> and<00:03:22.629> I<00:03:22.989> think<00:03:23.049> that's<00:03:23.530> where<00:03:23.799> often

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
ourselves and I think that's where often

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.129 
ourselves and I think that's where often
the<00:03:24.669> thing<00:03:24.909> breaks<00:03:25.209> down<00:03:25.510> doesn't<00:03:25.989> really

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:26.139 
the thing breaks down doesn't really

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:28.949 
the thing breaks down doesn't really
happen<00:03:26.379> but<00:03:27.129> my<00:03:27.760> experience<00:03:27.970> is<00:03:28.510> that<00:03:28.569> I<00:03:28.900> too

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
happen but my experience is that I too

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.589 
happen but my experience is that I too
have<00:03:29.409> got<00:03:29.590> to<00:03:29.769> put<00:03:29.949> my<00:03:30.129> head<00:03:30.370> on<00:03:30.400> the<00:03:30.760> block<00:03:31.359> I

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:31.599 
have got to put my head on the block I

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:33.089 
have got to put my head on the block I
too<00:03:31.659> have<00:03:31.870> got<00:03:32.169> to<00:03:32.290> step<00:03:32.500> out<00:03:32.709> of<00:03:32.739> my<00:03:33.069> comfort

00:03:33.089 --> 00:03:33.099 
too have got to step out of my comfort

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:35.550 
too have got to step out of my comfort
zone<00:03:33.579> I<00:03:33.970> too<00:03:34.299> have<00:03:34.629> got<00:03:34.959> to<00:03:35.109> go<00:03:35.229> and<00:03:35.290> invite

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:50.049 
we've all got to go through that process

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:52.979 
we've all got to go through that process
of<00:03:50.680> moving<00:03:51.310> out<00:03:51.669> from<00:03:51.819> ourselves<00:03:52.000> towards<00:03:52.840> the
