here<00:03:33.510> I'm<00:03:33.920> checking<00:03:34.920> the<00:03:35.130> soil<00:03:35.430> temperature

here I'm checking the soil temperature
first<00:03:36.930> the<00:03:37.290> one<00:03:37.470> with<00:03:37.620> the<00:03:37.740> heat<00:03:37.950> mat<00:03:38.270> you<00:03:39.270> can

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
first the one with the heat mat you can

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.840 
first the one with the heat mat you can
see<00:03:39.600> it<00:03:39.720> reached<00:03:40.080> almost<00:03:40.470> 90<00:03:41.100> degrees<00:03:41.400> which

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
see it reached almost 90 degrees which

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.900 
see it reached almost 90 degrees which
is<00:03:41.880> great<00:03:42.710> now<00:03:43.710> the<00:03:43.770> one<00:03:44.070> without<00:03:44.220> the<00:03:44.700> heat

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
is great now the one without the heat

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.700 
is great now the one without the heat
mat

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:48.710 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:53.090 

it's<00:03:49.710> ten<00:03:50.040> degrees<00:03:50.400> less<00:03:50.840> this<00:03:51.840> is<00:03:51.990> okay<00:03:52.440> but

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
it's ten degrees less this is okay but

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.310 
it's ten degrees less this is okay but

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
for finicky seedless watermelon it will

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.620 
for finicky seedless watermelon it will
be<00:03:55.440> on<00:03:55.620> the<00:03:55.740> verge<00:03:55.980> of<00:03:56.250> being<00:03:56.490> too<00:03:56.700> cool<00:03:56.970> for
