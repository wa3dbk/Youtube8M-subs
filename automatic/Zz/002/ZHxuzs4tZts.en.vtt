it<00:00:56.570> a<00:00:56.630> shot<00:00:56.840> and<00:00:56.900> just<00:00:57.200> make<00:00:57.590> something<00:00:57.860> I

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
it a shot and just make something I

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.490 
it a shot and just make something I

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
granted it's not like a board like today

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.350 
granted it's not like a board like today
where<00:01:03.920> it's<00:01:03.950> a<00:01:04.370> high-performance<00:01:04.580> board

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
where it's a high-performance board

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
where you use it for your tricks and so

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.200 
where you use it for your tricks and so
just<00:01:08.060> totally<00:01:08.660> shred<00:01:08.990> my<00:01:09.500> boards<00:01:10.030> they<00:01:11.030> don't

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
just totally shred my boards they don't

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.969 
just totally shred my boards they don't
have<00:01:11.360> those<00:01:11.600> luxuries<00:01:11.840> in<00:01:12.260> the<00:01:12.350> contours<00:01:12.860> in

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
have those luxuries in the contours in

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:15.160 
have those luxuries in the contours in
the<00:01:13.010> kick<00:01:13.280> they're<00:01:13.610> just<00:01:13.820> flat<00:01:14.090> so<00:01:14.750> the<00:01:14.840> intent

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
the kick they're just flat so the intent

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.380 
the kick they're just flat so the intent
is<00:01:15.440> to<00:01:15.470> just<00:01:15.979> ride<00:01:16.700> them<00:01:16.790> down<00:01:16.970> the<00:01:17.090> street

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
is to just ride them down the street

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.140 
is to just ride them down the street
because<00:01:17.900> that's<00:01:18.410> still<00:01:18.710> fun<00:01:19.130> cruising<00:01:20.090> out

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:20.150 
because that's still fun cruising out

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.150 
because that's still fun cruising out
street<00:01:20.479> is<00:01:20.660> you<00:01:21.020> know<00:01:21.110> I<00:01:21.410> think<00:01:21.830> that's<00:01:22.070> the

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:22.160 
street is you know I think that's the

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.290 
street is you know I think that's the

is the kids are going to be doing some
of<00:03:04.710> the<00:03:04.800> early<00:03:05.100> stages<00:03:05.520> of<00:03:05.760> the<00:03:06.090> prepping<00:03:06.570> of

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
of the early stages of the prepping of

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.690 
of the early stages of the prepping of
the<00:03:06.900> skateboards<00:03:07.440> and<00:03:07.620> it's<00:03:08.250> really<00:03:08.490> cool<00:03:08.670> for

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700
