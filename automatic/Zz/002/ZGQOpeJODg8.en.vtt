00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
connect and the rest is just a motive

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.390 
connect and the rest is just a motive
motion<00:01:42.259> that<00:01:42.380> you<00:01:42.470> hold<00:01:42.650> and<00:01:42.799> if<00:01:43.009> you<00:01:43.070> notice

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:43.400 
motion that you hold and if you notice

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.740 
motion that you hold and if you notice
that<00:01:43.430> people<00:01:43.670> say<00:01:44.090> it's<00:01:44.270> baseball<00:01:44.600> when<00:01:44.720> you

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
that people say it's baseball when you

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:46.660
