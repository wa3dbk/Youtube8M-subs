hamstring and that also hinder your
performance<00:00:10.269> in<00:00:11.269> my<00:00:11.900> opinion<00:00:12.440> it<00:00:12.980> is<00:00:13.129> very

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:13.190 
performance in my opinion it is very

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.090 
performance in my opinion it is very
important<00:00:14.030> in<00:00:14.210> martial<00:00:14.660> art<00:00:14.780> training<00:00:15.100> to

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:16.100 
important in martial art training to

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:21.340 
important in martial art training to
relax<00:00:17.260> occasionally<00:00:18.369> because<00:00:19.660> one<00:00:20.660> step<00:00:20.930> back

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:21.350 
relax occasionally because one step back

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.279 
relax occasionally because one step back
is<00:00:22.039> really<00:00:22.519> good<00:00:22.730> for<00:00:22.970> to<00:00:23.359> step<00:00:23.660> forward<00:00:24.019> in

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:24.289 
is really good for to step forward in

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:27.279 
is really good for to step forward in
the<00:00:24.529> long<00:00:24.740> run<00:00:25.010> especially<00:00:25.779> the<00:00:26.779> stretching

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:27.289 
the long run especially the stretching

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:32.670 
the long run especially the stretching
muscles<00:00:27.679> and<00:00:28.310> advance<00:00:29.090> of<00:00:29.300> skills<00:00:30.939> if<00:00:31.939> you<00:00:32.000> do

muscles and advance of skills if you do
hamstring<00:00:33.680> stretching<00:00:34.190> on<00:00:34.340> the<00:00:34.580> floor<00:00:34.850> mostly

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:36.250 
hamstring stretching on the floor mostly

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.210 
hamstring stretching on the floor mostly
you<00:00:37.250> can<00:00:37.280> change<00:00:37.820> that<00:00:38.030> pattern<00:00:38.300> for<00:00:38.840> example

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:39.220 
you can change that pattern for example

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.540 
you can change that pattern for example
you<00:00:40.220> can<00:00:40.430> hold<00:00:40.730> the<00:00:41.000> bar<00:00:41.510> standing<00:00:42.380> and<00:00:42.650> then

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 
you can hold the bar standing and then

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.360 
you can hold the bar standing and then
relax<00:00:43.910> your<00:00:44.180> leg<00:00:44.360> completely<00:00:45.230> then<00:00:46.070> just

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 
relax your leg completely then just

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.770 
relax your leg completely then just
swing<00:00:46.880> it<00:00:48.010> to<00:00:49.010> the<00:00:49.040> left<00:00:49.160> and<00:00:49.580> right<00:00:49.820> or<00:00:50.420> for

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
swing it to the left and right or for

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.040 
swing it to the left and right or for
the<00:00:50.960> backward<00:00:51.200> in<00:00:52.070> a<00:00:52.730> very<00:00:52.940> natural<00:00:53.300> or

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
the backward in a very natural or

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.430 
the backward in a very natural or
spontaneous<00:00:54.470> movement<00:00:55.040> and<00:00:55.730> then<00:00:56.440> gradually

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
spontaneous movement and then gradually

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.550 
spontaneous movement and then gradually
increase<00:00:58.100> the<00:00:58.610> range<00:00:58.790> of<00:00:59.030> motion<00:00:59.480> and<00:00:59.840> then

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:00.560 
increase the range of motion and then

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.490 
increase the range of motion and then
some<00:01:00.890> time<00:01:01.160> you<00:01:01.370> go<00:01:02.330> all<00:01:02.600> the<00:01:02.750> way<00:01:02.810> about<00:01:03.260> your

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
some time you go all the way about your

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.550 
some time you go all the way about your
shoulder<00:01:03.980> by<00:01:04.850> doing<00:01:05.390> it<00:01:05.660> you're<00:01:06.200> developing

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
shoulder by doing it you're developing

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.080 
shoulder by doing it you're developing
new<00:01:07.870> creative<00:01:08.870> way<00:01:09.380> about<00:01:10.070> stretching<00:01:10.340> your

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
new creative way about stretching your

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.050 
new creative way about stretching your
muscle<00:01:11.600> in<00:01:11.900> a<00:01:11.990> positive<00:01:12.560> sense<00:01:12.880> second<00:01:13.880> thing

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
muscle in a positive sense second thing

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.200 
muscle in a positive sense second thing
is<00:01:14.240> that<00:01:14.800> probably<00:01:15.800> should<00:01:16.130> stretch<00:01:16.910> your

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
is that probably should stretch your

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.420 
is that probably should stretch your
back<00:01:17.450> low<00:01:17.990> back<00:01:18.230> muscles<00:01:18.260> a<00:01:18.890> little<00:01:19.070> bit<00:01:19.190> more

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
back low back muscles a little bit more

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.030 
back low back muscles a little bit more
because<00:01:19.610> low<00:01:20.120> back<00:01:20.450> pain<00:01:20.840> and<00:01:21.170> hamstring

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
because low back pain and hamstring

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.730 
because low back pain and hamstring
tightness<00:01:22.400> are<00:01:22.880> very<00:01:23.150> related<00:01:23.480> or<00:01:24.320> so<00:01:24.590> they

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
tightness are very related or so they

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.140 
tightness are very related or so they
are<00:01:24.860> very<00:01:25.810> important<00:01:26.810> part<00:01:27.560> in<00:01:27.860> the<00:01:28.130> body<00:01:28.280> for

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
are very important part in the body for

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.770 
are very important part in the body for
good<00:01:30.050> technical<00:01:30.950> performance<00:01:31.280> so<00:01:32.180> lastly

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
good technical performance so lastly

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.300 
good technical performance so lastly
maybe<00:01:33.680> you<00:01:33.980> shouldn't<00:01:34.340> look<00:01:34.550> your<00:01:35.230> movement

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
maybe you shouldn't look your movement

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.530 
maybe you shouldn't look your movement
in<00:01:37.310> very<00:01:37.970> scientific<00:01:38.570> way<00:01:38.720> in<00:01:39.710> other<00:01:39.830> word

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:40.540 
in very scientific way in other word

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.960 
in very scientific way in other word
examine<00:01:41.540> the<00:01:42.080> way<00:01:42.230> you<00:01:42.290> move<00:01:42.740> punching<00:01:43.670> or

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
examine the way you move punching or

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.969 
examine the way you move punching or
front<00:01:44.870> kicking<00:01:46.630> maybe<00:01:47.630> you<00:01:48.050> are<00:01:48.229> working<00:01:48.680> too

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
front kicking maybe you are working too

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:49.450 
front kicking maybe you are working too
hard

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
hard

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.760 
hard
maybe<00:01:50.060> are<00:01:50.270> using<00:01:50.750> too<00:01:51.140> much<00:01:51.260> muscles<00:01:53.770> when

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
maybe are using too much muscles when

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.590 
maybe are using too much muscles when
you<00:01:55.010> understand<00:01:55.820> the<00:01:57.370> kinetic<00:01:58.420> principle<00:01:59.420> of

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
you understand the kinetic principle of

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.070 
you understand the kinetic principle of
our<00:01:59.780> body<00:02:00.430> you<00:02:01.430> can<00:02:01.700> perform

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
our body you can perform

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.920 
our body you can perform
in<00:02:03.320> a<00:02:03.470> maximum<00:02:04.070> speed<00:02:04.460> and<00:02:04.670> power<00:02:05.030> without

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
in a maximum speed and power without

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.520 
in a maximum speed and power without
using<00:02:06.830> too<00:02:07.130> much<00:02:07.400> of<00:02:07.670> your<00:02:07.940> muscular<00:02:08.510> power<00:02:08.720> so

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
using too much of your muscular power so

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.630 
using too much of your muscular power so
I<00:02:09.860> suggest<00:02:10.820> you<00:02:11.170> to<00:02:12.170> re-examine<00:02:12.860> and

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
I suggest you to re-examine and

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.960 
I suggest you to re-examine and
reevaluate<00:02:14.210> and<00:02:14.990> we<00:02:15.590> establish<00:02:16.340> the<00:02:16.790> way<00:02:16.910> you

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
reevaluate and we establish the way you

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.330 
reevaluate and we establish the way you
move
