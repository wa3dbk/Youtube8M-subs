another way to subdue the bees and make
them<00:01:07.170> more<00:01:07.320> docile<00:01:07.619> is<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.520> give<00:01:08.670> them<00:01:08.850> a<00:01:08.939> few

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
them more docile is to give them a few

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.800 
them more docile is to give them a few
