because I like kinda messing around with
cars<00:01:05.909> and<00:01:08.030> with<00:01:09.030> electronics<00:01:09.960> and<00:01:10.110> things

00:01:10.279 --> 00:01:10.289 
cars and with electronics and things

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:12.859 
cars and with electronics and things
sometimes<00:01:11.159> you<00:01:11.640> know<00:01:11.789> one<00:01:11.969> of<00:01:12.060> these<00:01:12.180> can<00:01:12.570> it

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
sometimes you know one of these can it

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.120 
sometimes you know one of these can it
could<00:01:13.020> save<00:01:13.229> you<00:01:13.350> a<00:01:13.380> lot<00:01:13.500> of<00:01:13.560> time<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:13.979> a<00:01:14.009> lot

could save you a lot of time and a lot

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.700 
could save you a lot of time and a lot
of<00:01:14.219> money<00:01:14.719> replacing<00:01:15.719> parts<00:01:16.289> that<00:01:16.439> don't<00:01:16.560> need

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
of money replacing parts that don't need

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.340 
of money replacing parts that don't need
replacing<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.700> it<00:01:18.539> saves<00:01:18.810> you<00:01:18.960> getting<00:01:19.259> out

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
replacing and it saves you getting out

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.499 
replacing and it saves you getting out
multimeters<00:01:20.039> and<00:01:20.280> all<00:01:20.369> sorts<00:01:20.670> of<00:01:20.789> all<00:01:21.210> sorts

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
multimeters and all sorts of all sorts

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.859 
multimeters and all sorts of all sorts
of<00:01:21.570> stuff<00:01:21.780> so<00:01:23.149> so<00:01:24.149> some<00:01:24.329> of<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.479> features<00:01:24.840> of

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
of stuff so so some of the features of

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.770 
of stuff so so some of the features of
this<00:01:25.200> you<00:01:25.649> can<00:01:25.890> record<00:01:26.490> save<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:27.359> play<00:01:27.509> back

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
this you can record save and play back

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.370 
this you can record save and play back
your<00:01:28.079> data<00:01:29.039> so<00:01:29.430> you<00:01:30.329> can<00:01:30.359> you<00:01:30.780> can<00:01:30.899> you<00:01:31.229> can

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
your data so you can you can you can

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.010 
your data so you can you can you can
plug<00:01:31.530> in<00:01:31.679> the<00:01:31.740> machine<00:01:31.859> basically<00:01:32.750> go<00:01:33.750> for<00:01:33.960> a

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
plug in the machine basically go for a

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.840 
plug in the machine basically go for a
drive<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:34.289> record<00:01:34.829> what<00:01:35.009> will<00:01:35.159> your<00:01:35.340> what<00:01:35.729> the

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
drive and record what will your what the

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.810 
drive and record what will your what the
sensors<00:01:36.179> are<00:01:36.299> doing<00:01:37.250> analyze<00:01:38.250> that<00:01:38.460> late

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
sensors are doing analyze that late

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.109 
sensors are doing analyze that late
state<00:01:39.119> which<00:01:39.329> is<00:01:39.450> obviously<00:01:39.750> pretty<00:01:39.929> useful

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
state which is obviously pretty useful

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:43.639 
state which is obviously pretty useful
you<00:01:42.119> can<00:01:42.240> check<00:01:42.479> their<00:01:42.719> the<00:01:42.899> land<00:01:43.109> early<00:01:43.350> o2

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
you can check their the land early o2

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.349 
you can check their the land early o2
sensor<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.640> evap<00:01:44.999> system<00:01:46.100> you<00:01:47.100> can<00:01:47.280> view<00:01:47.520> live

00:01:48.349 --> 00:01:48.359 
sensor the evap system you can view live

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:52.399 
sensor the evap system you can view live
data<00:01:48.719> as<00:01:49.020> well<00:01:49.229> but<00:01:49.499> in<00:01:49.979> graph<00:01:50.969> format<00:01:51.390> as<00:01:52.200> well

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
data as well but in graph format as well

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.580 
data as well but in graph format as well
as<00:01:52.590> just<00:01:53.310> sort<00:01:53.429> of<00:01:53.520> like<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.880> figures<00:01:54.420> so<00:01:55.320> it's

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
as just sort of like the figures so it's

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:56.660 
as just sort of like the figures so it's
kind<00:01:55.799> of<00:01:55.829> that's<00:01:56.009> kind<00:01:56.130> of<00:01:56.340> quite<00:01:56.520> cool

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
kind of that's kind of quite cool

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.800 
kind of that's kind of quite cool
looking<00:01:56.939> forward<00:01:57.179> to<00:01:57.299> testing<00:01:57.810> that<00:01:58.140> out<00:01:59.810> you

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
looking forward to testing that out you

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.480 
looking forward to testing that out you
can<00:02:00.840> also<00:02:01.200> obviously<00:02:01.469> you<00:02:01.950> know<00:02:02.069> the<00:02:02.310> most

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
can also obviously you know the most

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:08.380 
can also obviously you know the most
basic<00:02:02.909> level<00:02:03.240> read<00:02:03.869> and<00:02:04.229> clear<00:02:04.530> fall<00:02:04.920> codes

and<00:02:09.390> yeah<00:02:09.569> that's<00:02:09.780> it<00:02:09.929> I'm<00:02:10.020> just<00:02:10.140> gonna<00:02:10.260> gonna

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
and yeah that's it I'm just gonna gonna

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.340 
and yeah that's it I'm just gonna gonna
take<00:02:11.670> it<00:02:11.820> outside<00:02:11.970> I've<00:02:12.450> got<00:02:12.480> a

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
take it outside I've got a

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.010 
take it outside I've got a
it's<00:02:14.680> a<00:02:14.740> Japanese<00:02:15.310> car<00:02:15.760> with<00:02:16.180> a<00:02:16.270> turbo<00:02:16.690> that's

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
it's a Japanese car with a turbo that's

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:27.000 
it's a Japanese car with a turbo that's
all<00:02:17.140> I'm<00:02:17.260> gonna<00:02:17.380> say<00:02:17.470> okay<00:02:25.560> so<00:02:26.560> I'm<00:02:26.800> just<00:02:26.890> gonna

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
all I'm gonna say okay so I'm just gonna

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.130 
all I'm gonna say okay so I'm just gonna
show<00:02:27.700> you<00:02:27.730> a<00:02:27.790> couple<00:02:28.030> of<00:02:28.060> features<00:02:28.240> of<00:02:28.540> the<00:02:28.840> the

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
show you a couple of features of the the

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.370 
show you a couple of features of the the
serie<00:02:29.410> de<00:02:29.470> six<00:02:30.300> this<00:02:31.300> is<00:02:31.450> in<00:02:31.600> the<00:02:31.750> mighty<00:02:31.990> the

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
serie de six this is in the mighty the

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.700 
serie de six this is in the mighty the
mighty<00:02:32.800> Toyota<00:02:33.280> Yaris<00:02:33.610> I<00:02:33.990> just<00:02:34.990> created<00:02:35.560> a

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.710 
mighty Toyota Yaris I just created a

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:37.910 
mighty Toyota Yaris I just created a
fault<00:02:35.950> code<00:02:36.160> by<00:02:36.430> unplugging<00:02:37.060> the<00:02:37.360> map<00:02:37.510> sensor

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
fault code by unplugging the map sensor

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.500 
fault code by unplugging the map sensor
so<00:02:38.920> we're<00:02:39.460> gonna<00:02:39.550> see<00:02:39.760> if<00:02:39.880> it<00:02:39.940> can<00:02:40.120> pick<00:02:40.300> it<00:02:40.390> up

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
so we're gonna see if it can pick it up

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.070 
so we're gonna see if it can pick it up
and<00:02:40.750> then<00:02:41.050> hopefully<00:02:41.200> clear<00:02:41.650> it<00:02:42.840> going<00:02:43.840> to<00:02:43.900> put

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
and then hopefully clear it going to put

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:51.380 
and then hopefully clear it going to put
ignition<00:02:44.470> on<00:02:44.590> to<00:02:46.170> to<00:02:47.170> my<00:02:49.470> connect<00:02:50.470> to<00:02:50.740> the<00:02:50.830> car

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
ignition on to to my connect to the car

00:02:51.390 --> 00:03:07.730 
ignition on to to my connect to the car
takes<00:02:52.390> a<00:02:52.480> few<00:02:52.630> seconds

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:07.740 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:15.270 

okay<00:03:08.740> so<00:03:08.800> read<00:03:09.520> codes<00:03:09.970> should<00:03:12.990> be<00:03:14.130> checked<00:03:15.130> the

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
okay so read codes should be checked the

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.520 
okay so read codes should be checked the
car<00:03:15.490> before<00:03:15.970> and<00:03:16.330> there's<00:03:16.510> no<00:03:16.660> codes<00:03:16.960> now<00:03:17.290> so

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
car before and there's no codes now so

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.340 
car before and there's no codes now so
it's<00:03:17.980> gonna<00:03:18.130> be<00:03:18.340> a<00:03:18.660> something<00:03:19.660> in<00:03:19.930> there<00:03:20.080> now

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.920 

cool<00:03:23.350> so<00:03:23.800> it's<00:03:23.950> a<00:03:24.070> p0<00:03:24.700> 100<00:03:25.270> mass<00:03:25.600> or<00:03:25.900> volume

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
cool so it's a p0 100 mass or volume

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:33.060 
cool so it's a p0 100 mass or volume
airflow<00:03:26.770> a<00:03:26.950> circuit<00:03:27.930> so<00:03:28.930> that's<00:03:29.080> good<00:03:32.070> let's

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.070 
airflow a circuit so that's good let's

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:42.960 
airflow a circuit so that's good let's
go<00:03:33.250> back<00:03:33.870> and<00:03:34.870> try<00:03:35.110> and<00:03:35.140> play<00:03:35.410> it<00:03:35.500> out<00:03:41.370> so<00:03:42.370> erase

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
go back and try and play it out so erase

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:53.900 
go back and try and play it out so erase
codes<00:03:46.920> yes<00:03:47.920> I'm<00:03:48.460> sure

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:58.590 

okay<00:03:54.910> so<00:03:56.070> codes<00:03:57.070> are<00:03:57.250> now<00:03:57.370> been<00:03:57.580> cleared<00:03:57.820> so<00:03:58.180> if

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
okay so codes are now been cleared so if

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:04.110 
okay so codes are now been cleared so if
I<00:03:58.690> play<00:03:58.870> back<00:03:59.140> three<00:04:00.040> codes<00:04:00.400> trying<00:04:01.360> DTC's<00:04:03.120> the

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
I play back three codes trying DTC's the

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:11.610 
I play back three codes trying DTC's the
vehicle<00:04:04.390> has<00:04:04.480> no<00:04:04.510> float<00:04:04.840> codes<00:04:05.110> awesome<00:04:10.620> you

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
vehicle has no float codes awesome you

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.430 
vehicle has no float codes awesome you
know<00:04:11.770> just<00:04:12.160> turn<00:04:12.670> the<00:04:12.790> car<00:04:12.940> on<00:04:13.000> now<00:04:13.300> and<00:04:13.510> I<00:04:13.720> have

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
know just turn the car on now and I have

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.440 
know just turn the car on now and I have
a<00:04:14.470> look<00:04:14.620> at<00:04:14.710> some<00:04:14.920> of<00:04:15.040> the<00:04:15.190> data<00:04:15.850> graphing

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.450 
a look at some of the data graphing

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:22.590 
a look at some of the data graphing
which<00:04:16.630> I<00:04:20.489> think<00:04:21.489> could<00:04:21.580> be<00:04:21.640> pretty<00:04:21.880> pretty

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:22.600 
which I think could be pretty pretty

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:30.640 
which I think could be pretty pretty
slow<00:04:22.990> in<00:04:23.310> diagnosing<00:04:24.310> some<00:04:24.490> folks

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.710 

so<00:04:31.520> you<00:04:31.580> can<00:04:31.850> you<00:04:32.090> got<00:04:32.210> a<00:04:32.270> couple<00:04:32.449> of<00:04:32.540> choices

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
so you can you got a couple of choices

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.689 
so you can you got a couple of choices
you<00:04:32.900> can<00:04:33.229> you<00:04:33.620> can<00:04:33.770> kind<00:04:33.979> of<00:04:34.040> either<00:04:34.190> be<00:04:34.460> all

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:34.699 
you can you can kind of either be all

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:39.150 
you can you can kind of either be all
the<00:04:34.820> data<00:04:35.260> in<00:04:36.260> kind<00:04:36.560> of<00:04:36.620> a<00:04:36.680> numerical<00:04:37.040> format

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 
the data in kind of a numerical format

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.610 
the data in kind of a numerical format
you<00:04:40.160> say<00:04:40.370> you<00:04:40.430> go<00:04:40.639> the<00:04:40.910> cooler<00:04:41.810> temperature

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
you say you go the cooler temperature

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.800 
you say you go the cooler temperature
rose<00:04:42.949> per<00:04:43.250> minute<00:04:43.520> vehicle<00:04:43.970> speeds<00:04:44.210> but<00:04:44.479> I'm

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
rose per minute vehicle speeds but I'm

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:56.439 
rose per minute vehicle speeds but I'm
parked<00:04:45.470> up<00:04:45.680> say<00:04:53.889> intake<00:04:54.889> air<00:04:55.100> temperature<00:04:55.449> my

00:04:56.439 --> 00:04:56.449 
parked up say intake air temperature my

00:04:56.449 --> 00:05:01.390 
parked up say intake air temperature my
data<00:04:58.810> so<00:04:59.810> I<00:04:59.870> mean<00:04:59.990> this<00:05:00.110> fair<00:05:01.040> enough<00:05:01.220> I

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.400 
data so I mean this fair enough I

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.600 
data so I mean this fair enough I
suppose<00:05:02.050> but<00:05:03.250> it's<00:05:04.250> kind<00:05:04.430> of<00:05:04.460> more

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:04.610 
suppose but it's kind of more

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:09.310 
suppose but it's kind of more
interesting<00:05:05.240> to<00:05:06.820> do<00:05:07.820> it<00:05:07.850> graphically<00:05:08.780> like<00:05:09.080> a

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:09.320 
interesting to do it graphically like a

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:13.240 
interesting to do it graphically like a
graph<00:05:10.750> so<00:05:11.750> if<00:05:11.900> I<00:05:12.020> just<00:05:12.229> go<00:05:12.440> for<00:05:12.680> coolant

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.250 
graph so if I just go for coolant

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:24.820 
graph so if I just go for coolant
temperature<00:05:14.289> engine<00:05:15.310> rpm

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:24.830 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:26.619 

so<00:05:25.669> I'm<00:05:25.909> not<00:05:26.000> sure<00:05:26.060> how<00:05:26.180> well<00:05:26.449> it's<00:05:26.599> coming

00:05:26.619 --> 00:05:26.629 
so I'm not sure how well it's coming

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:28.990 
so I'm not sure how well it's coming
from<00:05:26.900> the<00:05:27.050> screen<00:05:27.319> but<00:05:27.530> I<00:05:28.009> can<00:05:28.669> see<00:05:28.819> it<00:05:28.909> quite

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 
from the screen but I can see it quite

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.210 
from the screen but I can see it quite
well<00:05:29.120> in<00:05:29.360> real<00:05:29.509> life<00:05:29.720> you<00:05:29.930> can<00:05:30.080> see<00:05:30.979> that<00:05:31.159> you

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:31.220 
well in real life you can see that you

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.219 
well in real life you can see that you
got<00:05:31.340> the<00:05:31.460> black<00:05:31.879> bar<00:05:32.180> is<00:05:32.210> the<00:05:32.599> the<00:05:32.930> corner

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:33.229 
got the black bar is the the corner

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:36.550 
got the black bar is the the corner
temperature<00:05:33.860> and<00:05:34.190> the<00:05:35.180> right<00:05:35.360> one<00:05:35.599> is<00:05:35.810> the<00:05:36.199> the

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:36.560 
temperature and the right one is the the

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:41.050 
temperature and the right one is the the
revs<00:05:36.770> per<00:05:37.069> minute<00:05:37.400> so<00:05:39.610> why<00:05:40.610> just<00:05:40.789> give<00:05:40.879> the

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:41.060 
revs per minute so why just give the

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:44.830 
revs per minute so why just give the
Frog<00:05:41.270> away<00:05:42.759> pretty<00:05:43.759> heavy<00:05:44.000> engine<00:05:44.330> rising<00:05:44.720> up

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:44.840 
Frog away pretty heavy engine rising up
