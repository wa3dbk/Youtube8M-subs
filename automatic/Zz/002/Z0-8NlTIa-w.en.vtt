00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
paper that we'll be testing with in the

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.280 
paper that we'll be testing with in the
print<00:02:01.770> quality<00:02:02.009> section<00:02:02.700> below<00:02:03.119> that<00:02:03.509> we<00:02:04.259> have

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
print quality section below that we have

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.340 
print quality section below that we have
several<00:02:04.770> choices<00:02:05.040> high<00:02:05.939> standard<00:02:06.780> and<00:02:06.990> custom

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
several choices high standard and custom

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.699 
several choices high standard and custom
and<00:02:08.420> for<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:09.479> purpose<00:02:09.840> of<00:02:09.899> our<00:02:10.020> example<00:02:10.560> we'll

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
and for the purpose of our example we'll

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.400 
and for the purpose of our example we'll
choose<00:02:10.739> high<00:02:11.310> which

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
choose high which

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.260 
choose high which
means<00:02:12.560> a<00:02:12.800> higher-resolution<00:02:13.310> printing<00:02:14.090> mode

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
means a higher-resolution printing mode

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.120 
means a higher-resolution printing mode
and<00:02:14.600> this<00:02:14.690> is<00:02:14.840> what<00:02:15.020> most<00:02:15.500> people<00:02:15.710> would

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
and this is what most people would

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.430 
and this is what most people would
normally<00:02:16.580> print<00:02:16.910> the<00:02:17.690> target<00:02:18.140> at<00:02:18.230> for

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
normally print the target at for

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.110 
normally print the target at for
building<00:02:18.710> a<00:02:18.770> printer<00:02:19.040> profile<00:02:19.580> and<00:02:19.970> then

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
building a printer profile and then

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.940 
building a printer profile and then

choices driver matching ICM and none and
none<00:03:16.670> is<00:03:17.540> the<00:03:17.690> choice<00:03:17.930> that<00:03:18.170> we<00:03:18.260> need<00:03:18.410> to<00:03:18.560> make

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:18.740 
none is the choice that we need to make

here this is the only setting out of the

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:24.310 
here this is the only setting out of the
three<00:03:22.400> that<00:03:22.970> will<00:03:23.150> give<00:03:23.330> us<00:03:23.360> no<00:03:24.020> color

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
three that will give us no color

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.310 
three that will give us no color
adjustment<00:03:25.010> no<00:03:25.550> profiles<00:03:26.180> being<00:03:26.570> applied<00:03:26.959> by

the Canon driver during the printer

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.960 
the Canon driver during the printer
process<00:03:30.040> so<00:03:31.040> none<00:03:31.340> is<00:03:31.490> the<00:03:31.610> correct<00:03:31.880> choice

process so none is the correct choice
this<00:03:32.360> is<00:03:32.510> what<00:03:32.630> you<00:03:32.720> have<00:03:32.900> to<00:03:33.050> pick<00:03:33.230> here<00:03:33.440> when

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
this is what you have to pick here when

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.640 
this is what you have to pick here when
you're<00:03:33.709> printing<00:03:33.860> a<00:03:34.040> target<00:03:34.459> and<00:03:35.470> when<00:03:36.470> this

you're printing a target and when this
is<00:03:36.800> selected<00:03:36.980> and<00:03:37.520> we<00:03:37.940> eventually<00:03:38.150> print<00:03:38.600> the
