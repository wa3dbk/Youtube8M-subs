hi this is Alex for Timmy with
five-window<00:00:04.950> state<00:00:05.250> shop<00:00:05.520> and<00:00:05.850> I'm<00:00:06.060> going<00:00:06.120> to

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
five-window state shop and I'm going to

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:12.499 
five-window state shop and I'm going to
talk<00:00:06.509> about<00:00:06.540> the<00:00:07.200> build<00:00:07.410> project<00:00:11.240> the<00:00:12.240> first

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
talk about the build project the first

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.539 
talk about the build project the first
thing<00:00:12.750> that<00:00:12.780> we<00:00:13.230> did<00:00:13.410> once<00:00:13.889> we<00:00:14.040> figured<00:00:14.400> out

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
thing that we did once we figured out

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.880 
thing that we did once we figured out
what<00:00:14.759> we<00:00:14.880> were<00:00:15.000> going<00:00:15.120> to<00:00:15.240> build<00:00:15.560> we<00:00:16.560> start

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
what we were going to build we start

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.160 
what we were going to build we start
cleaning<00:00:17.369> it<00:00:17.460> up<00:00:17.609> picking<00:00:18.270> up<00:00:18.480> all<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.930> dirt

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
cleaning it up picking up all the dirt

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.509 
cleaning it up picking up all the dirt
sweeping<00:00:20.100> it<00:00:20.279> and<00:00:20.520> then<00:00:21.119> we<00:00:21.810> start<00:00:22.199> getting

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:22.519 
sweeping it and then we start getting

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:25.730 
sweeping it and then we start getting
the<00:00:23.519> fill<00:00:23.820> which<00:00:24.510> is<00:00:24.720> what<00:00:24.930> goes<00:00:25.170> under<00:00:25.619> the

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
the fill which is what goes under the

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.060 
the fill which is what goes under the
concrete<00:00:25.949> rocks<00:00:26.939> dirt<00:00:27.779> whatever<00:00:28.769> type<00:00:29.039> of

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
concrete rocks dirt whatever type of

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.189 
concrete rocks dirt whatever type of
hard<00:00:29.429> materials<00:00:30.060> that<00:00:30.240> you<00:00:30.539> can<00:00:30.660> find<00:00:31.019> around

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
hard materials that you can find around

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.350 
hard materials that you can find around
the<00:00:31.500> spot<00:00:31.769> is<00:00:32.040> what's<00:00:32.430> going<00:00:32.700> to<00:00:32.820> make<00:00:33.180> the

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
the spot is what's going to make the

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:40.250 
the spot is what's going to make the
concrete<00:00:33.600> stronger<00:00:34.230> and<00:00:34.800> set<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.700> shape<00:00:39.260> so

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
concrete stronger and set the shape so

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.680 
concrete stronger and set the shape so
once<00:00:40.469> you<00:00:40.649> have<00:00:40.770> compacted<00:00:41.640> your<00:00:41.790> fill<00:00:42.059> you're

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
once you have compacted your fill you're

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.330 
once you have compacted your fill you're
ready<00:00:42.899> to<00:00:43.110> mix<00:00:43.290> your<00:00:43.469> concrete<00:00:43.890> and<00:00:44.070> throw<00:00:44.250> it

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
ready to mix your concrete and throw it

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.139 
ready to mix your concrete and throw it
on<00:00:44.460> there<00:00:45.739> the<00:00:46.739> first<00:00:46.980> type<00:00:47.340> of<00:00:47.370> concrete<00:00:47.700> you

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
on there the first type of concrete you

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.790 
on there the first type of concrete you
want<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.420> use<00:00:48.629> this<00:00:48.899> is<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.079> most<00:00:49.260> important

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
want to use this is the most important

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.069 
want to use this is the most important
type<00:00:49.980> is<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.760> sack<00:00:51.000> Creek<00:00:51.270> concrete<00:00:51.809> it's

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
type is the sack Creek concrete it's

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.490 
type is the sack Creek concrete it's
just<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.530> basic<00:00:53.010> level<00:00:53.190> grade<00:00:54.149> concrete

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
just the basic level grade concrete

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.040 
just the basic level grade concrete
makes<00:00:55.500> a<00:00:55.680> really<00:00:56.039> good<00:00:56.399> strong<00:00:57.050> compacted

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
makes a really good strong compacted

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.549 
makes a really good strong compacted
surface<00:00:59.000> when<00:01:00.000> you're<00:01:00.149> mixing<00:01:00.329> concrete<00:01:00.750> you

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
surface when you're mixing concrete you

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.789 
surface when you're mixing concrete you
want<00:01:01.770> to<00:01:01.890> add<00:01:02.070> water<00:01:02.820> as<00:01:03.149> you<00:01:03.629> go<00:01:03.780> along<00:01:03.899> I'd

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
want to add water as you go along I'd

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.000 
want to add water as you go along I'd
say<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.129> good<00:01:05.549> ratio<00:01:05.790> is<00:01:06.299> like<00:01:06.450> 2<00:01:06.750> bags<00:01:07.049> with<00:01:07.799> a

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
say a good ratio is like 2 bags with a

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.850 
say a good ratio is like 2 bags with a
gallon<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:08.580> a<00:01:08.670> half<00:01:08.700> of<00:01:09.000> water<00:01:09.590> you'll<00:01:10.590> know

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
gallon and a half of water you'll know

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.789 
gallon and a half of water you'll know
when<00:01:11.670> it's<00:01:11.850> just<00:01:12.180> wet<00:01:12.420> enough<00:01:12.720> when<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.560> color

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
when it's just wet enough when the color

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.300 
when it's just wet enough when the color
changes<00:01:14.490> completely<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.270> gray<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:15.930> it's<00:01:16.860> kind

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
changes completely to gray and it's kind

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.700 
changes completely to gray and it's kind
of<00:01:17.430> pasty<00:01:18.000> but<00:01:18.720> not<00:01:19.020> too<00:01:19.320> chunky<00:01:19.880> and<00:01:21.530> once<00:01:22.530> you

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
of pasty but not too chunky and once you

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.440 
of pasty but not too chunky and once you
mix<00:01:22.890> your<00:01:23.100> concrete<00:01:23.520> you're<00:01:24.030> just<00:01:24.240> going<00:01:24.390> to

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
mix your concrete you're just going to

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.179 
mix your concrete you're just going to
use<00:01:24.689> your<00:01:24.869> shovel<00:01:25.049> and<00:01:25.439> cover<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.159> whole

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
use your shovel and cover the whole

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.000 
use your shovel and cover the whole
surface

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.010 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.710 

and<00:01:30.010> once<00:01:30.250> you<00:01:30.370> cover<00:01:30.610> the<00:01:30.850> whole<00:01:30.880> fill<00:01:31.420> with

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
and once you cover the whole fill with

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.930 
and once you cover the whole fill with
the<00:01:31.900> concrete<00:01:32.320> you<00:01:33.040> can<00:01:33.190> start<00:01:33.460> using<00:01:33.730> a

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
the concrete you can start using a

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.580 
the concrete you can start using a
scrubber<00:01:34.300> to<00:01:34.540> start<00:01:34.780> compacting<00:01:35.560> the

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
scrubber to start compacting the

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:42.340 
scrubber to start compacting the
concrete<00:01:35.740> in

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.770 

and<00:01:42.440> once<00:01:43.070> you're<00:01:43.220> done<00:01:43.280> compacting<00:01:44.090> all<00:01:44.360> the

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
and once you're done compacting all the

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.840 
and once you're done compacting all the
concrete<00:01:45.290> with<00:01:45.530> the<00:01:45.680> scrubber<00:01:46.010> you're<00:01:46.700> going

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
concrete with the scrubber you're going

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.420 
concrete with the scrubber you're going
to<00:01:46.909> use<00:01:47.120> the<00:01:47.330> float<00:01:47.659> which<00:01:48.350> brings<00:01:48.740> up<00:01:48.920> all<00:01:49.159> the

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
to use the float which brings up all the

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:56.100 
to use the float which brings up all the
moisture<00:01:49.640> and<00:01:50.210> smoothes<00:01:51.200> it<00:01:51.440> out<00:01:51.590> even<00:01:52.040> more

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.930 

you<00:01:57.110> don't<00:01:57.290> want<00:01:57.470> to<00:01:57.560> overwork<00:01:58.130> your<00:01:58.400> surface

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:58.940 
you don't want to overwork your surface

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:00.730 
you don't want to overwork your surface
so<00:01:59.360> basically<00:01:59.780> you're<00:01:59.960> going<00:02:00.050> to<00:02:00.110> let<00:02:00.320> it<00:02:00.470> sit

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
so basically you're going to let it sit

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.010 
so basically you're going to let it sit
for<00:02:00.770> a<00:02:01.010> little<00:02:01.160> bit<00:02:01.340> and<00:02:01.729> that's<00:02:02.509> what<00:02:02.690> we<00:02:02.810> did

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
for a little bit and that's what we did

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.620 
for a little bit and that's what we did
we<00:02:03.530> let<00:02:03.680> it<00:02:03.860> sit<00:02:04.130> for<00:02:04.160> about<00:02:04.580> like<00:02:04.610> a<00:02:05.090> half<00:02:05.450> an

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
we let it sit for about like a half an

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.780 
we let it sit for about like a half an
hour<00:02:05.780> to<00:02:06.110> an<00:02:06.140> hour<00:02:06.410> went<00:02:07.040> to<00:02:07.160> go<00:02:07.250> get<00:02:07.400> something

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
hour to an hour went to go get something

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.210 
hour to an hour went to go get something
to<00:02:07.820> eat<00:02:07.940> and<00:02:08.330> then<00:02:08.959> we<00:02:09.110> come<00:02:09.350> back<00:02:09.380> and<00:02:09.950> you

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
to eat and then we come back and you

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.890 
to eat and then we come back and you
know<00:02:10.369> it's<00:02:10.550> a<00:02:10.640> little<00:02:10.820> bit<00:02:11.180> easier<00:02:11.570> to<00:02:11.720> work

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
know it's a little bit easier to work

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.990 
know it's a little bit easier to work
with<00:02:12.200> so<00:02:12.740> we're<00:02:12.890> going<00:02:12.980> to<00:02:13.040> start<00:02:13.400> covering<00:02:13.610> it

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
with so we're going to start covering it

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.470 
with so we're going to start covering it
with<00:02:14.540> a<00:02:14.600> final<00:02:15.170> layer<00:02:15.530> a<00:02:15.980> little<00:02:16.640> mix<00:02:17.150> of

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
with a final layer a little mix of

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.470 
with a final layer a little mix of
Portland<00:02:18.380> and<00:02:18.560> cement<00:02:19.190> and<00:02:19.910> we're<00:02:20.150> just<00:02:20.330> going

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
Portland and cement and we're just going

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.380 
Portland and cement and we're just going
to<00:02:20.510> make<00:02:20.720> it<00:02:20.870> really<00:02:21.320> smooth<00:02:21.940> start<00:02:22.940> using<00:02:23.300> the

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
to make it really smooth start using the

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.840 
to make it really smooth start using the
finishing<00:02:23.900> trowel<00:02:24.140> with<00:02:24.830> a<00:02:24.860> wet<00:02:25.160> brush<00:02:25.459> and

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
finishing trowel with a wet brush and

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.140 
finishing trowel with a wet brush and
start<00:02:26.209> smoothing<00:02:26.810> it<00:02:26.930> out

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.050 

it<00:02:30.690> takes<00:02:31.019> concrete<00:02:31.620> about<00:02:31.920> three<00:02:32.700> to<00:02:32.849> five

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
it takes concrete about three to five

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.420 
it takes concrete about three to five
days<00:02:33.390> to<00:02:33.420> set<00:02:33.959> so<00:02:34.379> we<00:02:34.560> waited<00:02:34.830> about<00:02:35.069> three

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
days to set so we waited about three

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.070 
days to set so we waited about three
days<00:02:35.700> because<00:02:35.970> we're<00:02:36.209> really<00:02:36.569> it<00:02:36.900> should

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
days because we're really it should

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.920 
days because we're really it should
negotiate<00:02:37.620> it<00:02:37.830> so<00:02:38.430> we<00:02:38.610> came<00:02:38.819> back<00:02:38.879> and<00:02:39.390> it<00:02:39.780> was

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
negotiate it so we came back and it was

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.490 
negotiate it so we came back and it was
ready<00:02:40.200> to<00:02:40.319> go<00:02:40.440> all<00:02:41.310> we<00:02:41.610> had<00:02:41.790> to<00:02:41.940> do<00:02:42.120> was<00:02:42.930> these

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
ready to go all we had to do was these

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.160 
ready to go all we had to do was these
last<00:02:43.860> finishing<00:02:44.370> touches<00:02:44.610> if<00:02:45.569> you<00:02:45.810> want<00:02:46.019> a

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
last finishing touches if you want a

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.199 
last finishing touches if you want a
little<00:02:46.680> bit<00:02:46.829> of<00:02:46.950> a<00:02:47.069> wet<00:02:47.250> finish<00:02:47.670> and<00:02:47.849> also<00:02:48.150> to

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
little bit of a wet finish and also to

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.420 
little bit of a wet finish and also to
make<00:02:48.480> the<00:02:48.629> concrete<00:02:48.840> last<00:02:49.349> longer<00:02:49.799> you<00:02:50.280> can

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
make the concrete last longer you can

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.430 
make the concrete last longer you can
get<00:02:50.640> this<00:02:50.879> type<00:02:51.180> of<00:02:51.209> liquid<00:02:51.780> it's<00:02:52.019> called<00:02:52.349> a

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
get this type of liquid it's called a

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.009 
get this type of liquid it's called a
wet<00:02:52.590> floor<00:02:52.950> sealer<00:02:53.519> so<00:02:54.510> we're<00:02:54.659> just<00:02:54.690> going<00:02:54.989> to

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
wet floor sealer so we're just going to

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:57.140 
wet floor sealer so we're just going to
pour<00:02:55.319> that<00:02:55.530> a<00:02:55.709> little<00:02:56.129> bit<00:02:56.280> on<00:02:56.430> there<00:02:56.700> as<00:02:56.849> we<00:02:57.000> go

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
pour that a little bit on there as we go

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.420 
pour that a little bit on there as we go
along<00:02:57.269> and<00:02:57.480> start<00:02:58.079> brushing<00:02:58.319> it<00:02:58.709> on<00:02:58.890> the

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
along and start brushing it on the

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.300 
along and start brushing it on the
surface<00:03:00.140> we<00:03:01.140> let<00:03:01.319> that<00:03:01.500> dry<00:03:01.799> for<00:03:01.829> about<00:03:02.099> an

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
surface we let that dry for about an

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.699 
surface we let that dry for about an
hour<00:03:02.549> and<00:03:03.000> then<00:03:03.510> we're<00:03:03.660> ready<00:03:03.840> to<00:03:03.989> shred<00:03:04.440> and
