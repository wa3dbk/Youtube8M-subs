one<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.150> ps4<00:01:39.630> but<00:01:40.380> it's<00:01:40.650> something<00:01:41.159> that's

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
one and ps4 but it's something that's

one and ps4 but it's something that's
going<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:41.610> be<00:01:41.700> inevitable<00:01:42.030> sooner<00:01:42.509> or<00:01:42.720> later

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
going to be inevitable sooner or later

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.319 
going to be inevitable sooner or later
even<00:01:43.110> if<00:01:43.439> this<00:01:43.710> game<00:01:43.979> is<00:01:44.009> self<00:01:44.640> is<00:01:44.820> ported<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.240> a

360 and playstation 3 compatible version
of<00:01:48.000> it<00:01:48.149> it's<00:01:48.659> going<00:01:48.810> to<00:01:48.869> happen<00:01:49.049> at<00:01:49.259> some

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
of it it's going to happen at some

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.560 
of it it's going to happen at some
points<00:01:49.799> i'm<00:01:49.979> where<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.670> game<00:01:50.970> itself<00:01:51.299> isn't

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
points i'm where the game itself isn't

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:52.940 
points i'm where the game itself isn't
going<00:01:51.780> to<00:01:51.899> be<00:01:51.990> offered<00:01:52.350> for<00:01:52.380> those<00:01:52.619> platforms

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
going to be offered for those platforms

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.280 
going to be offered for those platforms
and<00:01:53.430> it's<00:01:53.850> something<00:01:54.030> that<00:01:54.210> as<00:01:54.570> a<00:01:54.630> development

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
and it's something that as a development

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.020 
and it's something that as a development
standpoint<00:01:55.500> sooner<00:01:56.460> rather<00:01:56.640> than<00:01:56.969> later

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
standpoint sooner rather than later

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.179 
standpoint sooner rather than later
would<00:01:57.329> be<00:01:57.630> a<00:01:57.659> great<00:01:58.140> point<00:01:58.409> to<00:01:58.619> actually<00:01:59.070> move

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
would be a great point to actually move

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.760 
would be a great point to actually move
over<00:01:59.549> to<00:01:59.850> current<00:02:00.240> generation<00:02:00.840> only<00:02:01.079> but<00:02:01.560> that

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
over to current generation only but that

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.289 
over to current generation only but that
aside<00:02:02.070> let's<00:02:02.460> get<00:02:02.640> into<00:02:02.729> something<00:02:03.000> that<00:02:03.210> has

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
aside let's get into something that has

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:04.940 
aside let's get into something that has
actually<00:02:03.780> confirmed<00:02:04.350> one<00:02:04.619> hundred<00:02:04.920> percent

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950
