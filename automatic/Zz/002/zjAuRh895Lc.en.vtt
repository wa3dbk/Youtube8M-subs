 evaluated here is a characteristic that 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.480
 became a reference when we talk about 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.210
 focus is its dynamic behavior 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:21.570

 yet a problem of focus the space 

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:56.659

 divide the market with golf 7 and 12 30 and 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:28.060
 other heavyweight competitors will not be 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:28.060
