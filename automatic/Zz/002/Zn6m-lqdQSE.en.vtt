guys knowing and you can see its

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.960 
guys knowing and you can see its
potential<00:02:09.880> from<00:02:10.210> how<00:02:10.380> he<00:02:11.380> was<00:02:11.560> a<00:02:11.910> dictating<00:02:12.910> to

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
potential from how he was a dictating to

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.570 
potential from how he was a dictating to
pick<00:02:13.120> up<00:02:13.270> and<00:02:13.890> not<00:02:14.890> saying<00:02:15.100> he<00:02:15.190> was<00:02:15.310> scoring

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
pick up and not saying he was scoring

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.330 
pick up and not saying he was scoring
the<00:02:15.670> ball<00:02:15.850> but<00:02:16.060> just<00:02:16.270> he<00:02:16.420> was<00:02:16.540> a<00:02:17.310> dictating<00:02:18.310> a

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
the ball but just he was a dictating a

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.640 
the ball but just he was a dictating a
lot<00:02:18.520> of<00:02:18.700> players<00:02:18.910> from<00:02:19.180> both<00:02:19.540> ends<00:02:19.840> and<00:02:20.560> I

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
lot of players from both ends and I

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:21.960 
lot of players from both ends and I
evaluate<00:02:21.070> the<00:02:21.190> game<00:02:21.340> from<00:02:21.520> not<00:02:21.700> just<00:02:21.730> a

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
evaluate the game from not just a

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.370 
evaluate the game from not just a
scoring<00:02:22.330> perspective<00:02:22.420> of<00:02:22.930> a<00:02:22.959> defensive

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
scoring perspective of a defensive

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.800 
scoring perspective of a defensive
perspective<00:02:23.890> to<00:02:24.040> him<00:02:24.220> I<00:02:24.490> told<00:02:25.360> him<00:02:25.540> a<00:02:25.660> long

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
perspective to him I told him a long

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.270 
perspective to him I told him a long
time<00:02:25.840> ago<00:02:26.140> in<00:02:26.350> the<00:02:26.410> first<00:02:26.650> man<00:02:26.830> that<00:02:27.010> he<00:02:27.160> had

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280
