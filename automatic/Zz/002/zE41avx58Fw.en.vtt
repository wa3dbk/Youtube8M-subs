Laura<00:02:31.800> Mercier's<00:02:32.370> products<00:02:33.090> are<00:02:33.240> a<00:02:33.300> little

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
Laura Mercier's products are a little

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.800 
Laura Mercier's products are a little
bit<00:02:34.440> on<00:02:34.650> the<00:02:34.920> pricey<00:02:35.040> side<00:02:35.370> but<00:02:36.240> I<00:02:36.270> think<00:02:36.660> it's

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
bit on the pricey side but I think it's

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.900 
bit on the pricey side but I think it's
worth<00:02:37.020> it<00:02:37.200> for<00:02:37.380> this<00:02:37.500> because<00:02:37.770> this<00:02:38.490> is<00:02:38.550> really

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
worth it for this because this is really

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.300 
worth it for this because this is really
