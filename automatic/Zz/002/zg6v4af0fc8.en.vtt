the<00:00:30.210> start<00:00:30.380> I<00:00:31.380> don't<00:00:31.740> think<00:00:31.920> it's<00:00:32.040> gonna<00:00:32.309> play

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
the start I don't think it's gonna play

the start I don't think it's gonna play
a<00:00:33.270> huge<00:00:33.690> difference<00:00:33.989> in<00:00:34.410> nagrand<00:00:34.950> there's

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
a huge difference in nagrand there's

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.459 
a huge difference in nagrand there's
just<00:00:35.430> one<00:00:35.700> more<00:00:35.730> place<00:00:36.270> that<00:00:37.050> you<00:00:37.170> have<00:00:37.290> to

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
just one more place that you have to

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.250 
just one more place that you have to
look<00:00:37.649> at<00:00:37.770> that<00:00:37.800> starting<00:00:38.340> area<00:00:38.610> so<00:00:39.030> I<00:00:39.329> don't

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
look at that starting area so I don't

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.330 
look at that starting area so I don't
know<00:00:40.350> if<00:00:40.440> he's<00:00:40.559> going<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:40.800> be<00:00:40.920> able<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.160> find

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
know if he's going to be able to find

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.069 
know if he's going to be able to find
him<00:00:41.460> straight<00:00:41.790> away<00:00:41.879> like<00:00:42.600> you<00:00:42.690> did<00:00:42.719> that<00:00:43.050> I

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
him straight away like you did that I

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.819 
him straight away like you did that I
that<00:00:43.530> first<00:00:43.770> time<00:00:44.010> locked<00:00:44.309> out<00:00:44.460> ok<00:00:45.329> that<00:00:45.539> is<00:00:45.570> he

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:45.829 
that first time locked out ok that is he

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:50.029 
that first time locked out ok that is he
so<00:00:46.829> round<00:00:47.430> three<00:00:47.850> score<00:00:48.329> is<00:00:48.450> 10<00:00:48.719> and<00:00:49.039> SK

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
so round three score is 10 and SK

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.680 
so round three score is 10 and SK
started<00:00:50.340> off<00:00:50.460> strong<00:00:50.610> but<00:00:51.000> we're<00:00:51.090> able<00:00:51.270> unable

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
started off strong but we're able unable

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.020 
started off strong but we're able unable

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
pillar is on we'll never know so I'm

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.960 
pillar is on we'll never know so I'm
actually<00:01:03.449> is<00:01:03.840> right<00:01:04.680> on<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:04.890> near<00:01:05.820> the

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
actually is right on the near the

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:12.890 
actually is right on the near the
stealth<00:01:06.330> buff<00:01:07.130> way<00:01:08.130> off<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.549> side<00:01:11.240> and<00:01:12.240> I

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
up getting closer to inflame looking for

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.170 
up getting closer to inflame looking for
a<00:01:19.740> SAP<00:01:20.009> maybe<00:01:20.250> it<00:01:20.430> actually<00:01:20.700> gets<00:01:20.850> on<00:01:21.060> the

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
a SAP maybe it actually gets on the

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.020 
a SAP maybe it actually gets on the
druid<00:01:21.420> once<00:01:21.630> again<00:01:21.930> so<00:01:22.530> a<00:01:22.560> good<00:01:22.950> opener<00:01:23.400> for<00:01:23.580> sk

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030

closer<00:01:26.189> these<00:01:26.430> pillars<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:26.850> that's<00:01:27.000> gonna

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
closer these pillars and that's gonna

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.210 
closer these pillars and that's gonna
play<00:01:27.270> in<00:01:27.390> an<00:01:27.540> advantage<00:01:28.049> and<00:01:28.259> we<00:01:28.950> can<00:01:29.070> see

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
play in an advantage and we can see

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.640 
play in an advantage and we can see
arcane<00:01:29.850> missiles<00:01:30.030> being<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.659> channeled<00:01:31.140> but

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
it's on nowhere near at the moment as

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.630 
it's on nowhere near at the moment as
he's<00:01:33.720> most<00:01:34.140> likely<00:01:34.229> slowed<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:35.040> also<00:01:35.250> so<00:01:35.520> is

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
he's most likely slowed and also so is

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.039 
he's most likely slowed and also so is
