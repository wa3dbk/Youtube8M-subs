00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 and so hello everyone with you panda and therefore 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.850
 Today I will show you this 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.470
 awesome movie theater i started let's start 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.000
 just a small overview that is how he 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.490
 outwardly looks here means we 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.990
 black screen pumpkin on the sides well or 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.340
 logo channel checks call what you want 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.770
 here we have a button as a remote 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.720
 wooden oh well on the block ground 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.250
 is what type improvise on the table was 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.289
 still near the chair to put something not 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.060
 I thought that but the thickness of the mechanism itself 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.800
 this is just one block here but 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.279
 let's activate it by clicking on 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.039
 remote controller 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.119
 Here we activate and we went we Kintz 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.489
 seen at first tfp 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.910
 and here it means the sun is small 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.950
 the house is now dark and the moon has come 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.290
 mountains well or down a small hill 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.390
 green horseradish is a creeper like many 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.960
 guessed he comes to the house and starts 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.969
 to burn 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.399
 well he says harry says still explode 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.360
 that's what blew up with us means everything 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.670
 here it burns and 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.770
 and that is the end of the film in general like this 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.660
 the whole thing works I'll start with the button under 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.489
 button to place the command position 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.020
 blocks set command cordian block and and 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.359
 relatedness block ie in a certain 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.300
 the place he puts the solution block the scheme itself 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.640
 located not here but over there yes they are 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.689
 do not be afraid 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.640
 the size of the circuit it is actually much 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.159
 more compact can be done but I will explain 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.020
 then why do i do a big general 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.540
 here we have by pressing a button 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.210
 this block is put on, it feeds 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.280
 This is the command block in which it is clogged. 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.210
 set block command one block relative 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.070
 x and x coordinates 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.110
 air that is, she puts right here 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.850
 the air that is, the ration block disappears but 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.860
 manages to send a signal to this one 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.509
 command block which is generally here here 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.130
 these all teams are blocks per species one in 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.930
 the same team is a clone command 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.820
 just different coordinates everywhere first 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.189
 first six coordinates different last 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.229
 3 are the same everywhere i.e. clone command 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.150
 and after a second, the heels are also the most clone 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.530
 other coordinates last three again 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.750
 same here and so here so 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.640
 these areas here are copied and 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.340
 inserted there but at the same time 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.290
 Children are further copied here this 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.360
 areas and insert over there this one 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.399
 there and every second frame changes and 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.920
 we get the impression that 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.350
 there is a cartoon 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.600
 in general, you can actually every frame 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.700
 just side with each other but I did 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.409
 so that you can download a map card 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.800
 will be available after this 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:12.170
 type 25 likes video means 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:14.270
 25 likes and the map will be in the description in 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.010
 In general, you can just tear down this one. 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:19.250
 picture let me even you well now on 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.739
 practice show and say here what well 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.540
 let's here after the explosion of the creeper here 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:25.130
 here we see fire in the first year of the explosion 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.510
 creeper creep torn retracted 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:30.370
 little house and here let's draw 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:33.319
 anybody like that 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.780
 okay everything and let me remember 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:37.760
 and now we go there and lose the cartoon 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.459
 again and we'll see what's on that frame 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.810
 there will be such an incomprehensible green garbage 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.819
 or lightning call whatever you want in general 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.500
 there are people in the well swim see them 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:47.090
 like it and to be honest there 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.340
 planted just had nothing to do 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:52.190
 in general, okay tfp we see and it means 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:55.640
 cartoon means day pass both on 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:58.010
 night means the house turns on the light big 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.769
 moon stars twinkle and green horseradish 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:04.489
 coming down means so excited and 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:05.900
 starts to burn so now everything 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:06.829
 explode and here we see ourselves on lightning 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.440
 exactly one frame 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:11.750
 that is, we changed one frame there and 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.850
 here he has changed too and let's 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.680
 now back to the original and there will be 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:17.720
 usually multi which was generally on 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.280
 in fact, you can just join the others 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.440
 each other but I made you 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.170
 could download the map and change the cartoon 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.310
 that is, you stick what you want 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.320
 that is, draw yourself 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.840
 redraw zeros in the general case of your 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:31.070
 imaginations here but really on 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.440
