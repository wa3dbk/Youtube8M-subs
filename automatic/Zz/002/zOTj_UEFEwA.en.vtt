crunching and messing the hair up a
little<00:01:37.650> bit<00:01:38.070> I<00:01:38.310> would<00:01:38.880> suggest<00:01:39.090> not<00:01:39.509> using<00:01:40.259> a

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
little bit I would suggest not using a

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.080 
little bit I would suggest not using a
hairbrush<00:01:40.860> if<00:01:41.100> you<00:01:41.189> have<00:01:41.340> naturally<00:01:41.880> curly

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
hairbrush if you have naturally curly

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.090 
hairbrush if you have naturally curly
hair<00:01:42.270> because<00:01:43.170> it'll<00:01:43.380> end<00:01:43.530> up<00:01:43.649> making<00:01:44.009> the

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
hair because it'll end up making the

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.580 
hair because it'll end up making the
hairstyle<00:01:44.520> frizzy<00:01:44.970> so<00:01:45.810> once<00:01:46.170> you've<00:01:46.350> done

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
hairstyle frizzy so once you've done

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.830 
hairstyle frizzy so once you've done
