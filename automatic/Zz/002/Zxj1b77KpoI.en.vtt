00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.970
 hello everything figured how is it there 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.020
 Look outside your forehead 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:20.609
 but that's not what this video is about 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:34.320
 but it is always about effects 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:36.750
 Direction sun people you could too 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:49.260
 you are in the gym somewhere and 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:51.120
 then you sit guy from the mirror he has 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.809
 but never anything from the Jewish ones 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:57.510
 So if he uses the laws 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.500
 trained want to get started 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:05.519
 then you do not take both dumbbells 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:08.250
 but only because the principle of 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.670
 force counter flash times belongs now 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.990
 gets the dumbbell first against the camera 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.700
 when I have therefore act with her 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.470
 my hands as I train my 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.750
 belly maybe not up to the shoulder 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.210
 neck through the halves work though 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.790
 I I train times so as to give 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.610
 right 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:30.000
 I put myself here relatively tight why 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:33.240
 has two reasons first, I am ready 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.479
 I'm standing here all the time 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.040
 the dumbbell not as good over 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:40.650
 Second, I can not look so good 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.270
 relax but extremely important in 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.810
 this exercise will be if we do something more 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:51.060
 weight then I ask myself rises 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:56.140
 continue quite straight shoulders back 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:02:01.649
 and then I go down slowly 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:03.520
 down down from the left side of the abdomen 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.740
 The trade again ran 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.420
 I can even go a little further 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:28.630
 over it go even more 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:31.170
 then contract right back on the 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.170
 other side 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:46.150
 curious and in lateral week 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:48.130
 work with this exercise necessarily 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.450
 take care that we really have little 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:55.870
 start weight first 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:57.900
 after that and will cut off course 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:01.389
 burdened here and you always have to 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:03.730
 we have to stop our increases 

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:04.930
 in overload and also has fast 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.380
 lumbago move 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:10.209
 Of course that was a club but generally 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:13.540
 over and yet extremely good 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:16.180
 is suitable and so spine is in 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.950
 Finally, a joint and the need 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.230
 we do not always train with push 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.720
 pull all over but just as well 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:27.639
 by rotation your own axis 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:29.730
 yes and then there is still another said to 

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:31.870
 These ones 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.420
 that means we subscribe to this video 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:37.840
 channel for more and hardly any experience 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:39.639
 tutorial far a video comes to the topic 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.670
 one-armed push - ups and otherwise 

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:43.910
 simyo tenth on the beach until today not 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:49.510
 quite as full as usual 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:49.510
 do not know why I'm horny otherwise
