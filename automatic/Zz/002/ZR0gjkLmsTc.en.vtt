 Bourg-en-Bresse Point 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.980
 and 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:34.829
 renowned 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.600
 the score reflects the physiognomy of the 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.550
 match I think it's a team that 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.830
 we are largely superior especially 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.570
 when we are very very average I 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.340
 think we have succeeded our start we have 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.920
 managed to put in place we wanted 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.480
 unfortunately do not materialize on 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.610
 the two big occasions we had on 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.600
 the first down are very effective 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.730
 realistic 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.610
 Here is the details was told that 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.930
 it was going to play little at the beginning 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.180
 after that it plays and it was played at 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.540
 many more things we were beaten 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.130
 in commitment to determination 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.020
 but facing teams that are us 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.460
 we already knew if that 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.800
 can not seem to be in tune 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.970
 for sure it's complicated for there 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.970
 to compete with such a team 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.319
 it is certain that there will have to be very 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.120
 quick 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:27.390
 it's a team that is very bad so 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:30.209
 it will still be a complicated match but 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.640
 here we are we are going we are going to draw the 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.230
 consequences and conclusions from 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.000
 Monday already to see the failures 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.760
 to explain a little bit their weight 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.500
 how and then to try to settle 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.150
 all that is for sure that today we are 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.390
 stumbled upon a big team 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.560
 gazelec we knew but as I 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.450
 repeat if we are not at least 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.370
 commitment determination for at 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.760
 least be at the same level as in this 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:57.360
 domain there after it's very complicated 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:59.340
 it was complicated to too many players in 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.870
 underneath June 30 underneath there on a 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.160
 match like that it's not possible to 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.220
 compete with such a team 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:08.780
 when you have half of your 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.780
 players who are not their levels what 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:58.080
 fart 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.080
 m 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:08.770
 hu 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:23.259
 while an excuse has sought a 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:24.610
 failure no no no no no I am 

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:25.810
 especially not true I am general of 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.880
 excuses that would be too easy 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:29.259
 no today it shows us a little 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.350
 little the way that has to go for 

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:32.830
 that's it to compete with such 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.780
 teams 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.669
 I think it will be a very championship 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.960
 complicated all season to go 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:40.360
 maybe not always gazelec in 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.530
 face of us but in any case that's but 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.800
 he will still rectify my 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:43.800
 big thing
