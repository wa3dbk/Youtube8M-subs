the match he reached 12.5 points in the
20th<00:00:24.970> game<00:00:25.210> I'm<00:00:26.050> actually<00:00:26.320> been<00:00:26.980> to<00:00:27.400> the<00:00:27.670> games

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:28.000 
20th game I'm actually been to the games

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000 
20th game I'm actually been to the games
live<00:00:28.269> I<00:00:29.519> and<00:00:30.519> I<00:00:31.500> think<00:00:32.500> I<00:00:32.560> had<00:00:32.680> actually<00:00:32.830> the

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.010 
live I and I think I had actually the

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.910 
live I and I think I had actually the
first<00:00:33.580> game<00:00:33.940> short<00:00:34.840> lost<00:00:35.080> on<00:00:35.290> time<00:00:35.500> is<00:00:35.740> a<00:00:35.770> bit

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:35.920 
first game short lost on time is a bit

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.459 
first game short lost on time is a bit
tragic<00:00:36.480> because<00:00:37.480> he<00:00:37.570> actually<00:00:37.660> had<00:00:38.020> a<00:00:38.050> hit<00:00:38.440> a

00:00:38.459 --> 00:00:38.469 
tragic because he actually had a hit a

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:40.350 
tragic because he actually had a hit a
very<00:00:38.620> good<00:00:38.860> position<00:00:38.980> both<00:00:39.789> both<00:00:40.120> players

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:40.360 
very good position both both players

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.529 
very good position both both players
forty<00:00:40.660> was<00:00:40.809> willing<00:00:41.050> but<00:00:41.200> anyway<00:00:42.539> because

00:00:43.529 --> 00:00:43.539 
forty was willing but anyway because

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:45.810 
forty was willing but anyway because
Kasparov<00:00:44.230> had<00:00:44.320> reached<00:00:44.500> 12.5<00:00:45.280> points

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:45.820 
Kasparov had reached 12.5 points

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.580 
Kasparov had reached 12.5 points
they<00:00:46.000> played<00:00:46.360> these<00:00:46.750> 20<00:00:47.379> minute<00:00:47.680> rapid<00:00:48.520> games

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
they played these 20 minute rapid games

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.130 
they played these 20 minute rapid games
with<00:00:50.590> formatic<00:00:50.949> openings<00:00:51.670> and<00:00:52.140> Kasparov

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:53.140 
with formatic openings and Kasparov

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.509 
with formatic openings and Kasparov
moves<00:00:53.680> here<00:00:54.070> as<00:00:54.280> black<00:00:54.879> were<00:00:55.090> forced<00:00:55.510> upon<00:00:55.629> him

00:00:56.509 --> 00:00:56.519 
moves here as black were forced upon him

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:01.970 
moves here as black were forced upon him
so<00:00:57.519> this<00:00:57.699> isn't<00:00:57.879> a<00:00:58.090> real<00:00:58.300> official<00:00:58.960> fado<00:00:59.559> game

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.530 

Kasparov<00:01:02.980> in<00:01:03.219> in<00:01:03.519> a<00:01:03.609> longer<00:01:03.940> game<00:01:04.059> I<00:01:04.120> think<00:01:04.300> has

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:04.540 
Kasparov in in a longer game I think has

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.180 
Kasparov in in a longer game I think has
beaten<00:01:04.780> laws<00:01:05.500> which<00:01:05.710> in<00:01:05.860> some<00:01:06.040> other

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:06.190 
beaten laws which in some other

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.789 
beaten laws which in some other
tournaments<00:01:07.090> in<00:01:07.420> the<00:01:07.540> Kings<00:01:07.840> gambit<00:01:08.260> and<00:01:08.440> he

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:08.799 
tournaments in the Kings gambit and he

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:11.760 
tournaments in the Kings gambit and he
accepted<00:01:09.520> and<00:01:09.640> played<00:01:09.880> I<00:01:10.270> believe<00:01:11.080> d6<00:01:11.560> and

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
accepted and played I believe d6 and

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
accepted and played I believe d6 and
quick<00:01:11.920> g5<00:01:13.680> but<00:01:14.680> as<00:01:14.799> I<00:01:14.920> said<00:01:14.979> in<00:01:15.310> this<00:01:15.400> series

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:15.790 
quick g5 but as I said in this series

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:17.520 
quick g5 but as I said in this series
we'll<00:01:16.180> be<00:01:16.299> looking<00:01:16.450> at<00:01:16.720> how<00:01:16.869> world<00:01:17.110> champions

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530

we'll be looking at how world champions
lost<00:01:17.710> and<00:01:18.130> I<00:01:18.400> just<00:01:18.939> want<00:01:19.210> to<00:01:19.330> emphasize<00:01:19.750> though

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:19.930 
lost and I just want to emphasize though

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.770 
lost and I just want to emphasize though
the<00:01:20.049> game<00:01:20.229> context<00:01:20.920> so<00:01:21.579> it<00:01:22.270> does<00:01:22.479> look<00:01:22.659> a<00:01:22.750> bit

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
the game context so it does look a bit

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.340 
the game context so it does look a bit
funny<00:01:23.110> some<00:01:23.500> whisper<00:01:23.860> are<00:01:23.950> smooth<00:01:24.420> so<00:01:25.420> he<00:01:26.110> took

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
funny some whisper are smooth so he took

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.620 
funny some whisper are smooth so he took
the<00:01:26.890> gambit<00:01:27.280> and<00:01:27.430> we<00:01:27.549> have<00:01:27.670> this<00:01:27.820> Bishop<00:01:28.180> c4

out<00:02:14.700> that<00:02:15.240> sort<00:02:15.570> of<00:02:15.600> thematic<00:02:15.720> undermining

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
out that sort of thematic undermining

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.940 
out that sort of thematic undermining
idea<00:02:17.370> as<00:02:18.210> I<00:02:18.870> mentioned<00:02:19.260> yesterday

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
idea as I mentioned yesterday

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.700 
idea as I mentioned yesterday
if<00:02:20.040> this<00:02:20.850> pawn<00:02:21.420> stops<00:02:21.780> defending<00:02:22.230> this<00:02:22.380> then

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
if this pawn stops defending this then

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:23.810 
if this pawn stops defending this then
we're<00:02:22.860> gonna<00:02:22.950> have<00:02:23.160> major<00:02:23.460> porn

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
we're gonna have major porn

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.810 
we're gonna have major porn
fragmentation<00:02:24.750> AFL<00:02:25.650> pressure<00:02:26.010> and<00:02:26.340> what's

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
fragmentation AFL pressure and what's

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.900 
fragmentation AFL pressure and what's
still<00:02:27.390> big<00:02:27.570> in<00:02:27.690> the<00:02:27.810> center<00:02:28.260> so<00:02:29.220> we<00:02:29.610> could<00:02:29.790> be

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
still big in the center so we could be

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.690 
still big in the center so we could be
seeing<00:02:30.120> a<00:02:30.240> collapse<00:02:30.570> in<00:02:30.780> blacks<00:02:30.990> position

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
seeing a collapse in blacks position

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.240 
seeing a collapse in blacks position
rook<00:02:32.700> g8<00:02:33.450> was<00:02:33.660> played<00:02:33.930> and<00:02:34.350> now<00:02:34.800> another

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
rook g8 was played and now another

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.860 
rook g8 was played and now another
interesting<00:02:35.460> move<00:02:35.820> which<00:02:36.000> was<00:02:36.150> protecting

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
interesting move which was protecting

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.380 
interesting move which was protecting
this<00:02:37.050> rug<00:02:38.240> it<00:02:39.240> was<00:02:39.450> King<00:02:39.720> g1<00:02:40.140> played<00:02:40.410> by<00:02:40.650> short

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
this rug it was King g1 played by short

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.600 
this rug it was King g1 played by short
so<00:02:42.390> perhaps<00:02:43.020> some<00:02:43.320> small<00:02:43.950> should<00:02:44.280> have<00:02:44.370> played

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
so perhaps some small should have played

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.370 
so perhaps some small should have played
g4<00:02:45.060> but<00:02:45.240> maybe<00:02:45.450> you<00:02:45.780> know<00:02:45.840> because<00:02:46.020> of<00:02:46.170> time

the<00:02:48.510> opening<00:02:48.810> moves<00:02:49.050> he<00:02:49.620> actually<00:02:50.010> played<00:02:51.020> G

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700

e2 now cuz both plays actually Knight
takes<00:03:20.040> e4<00:03:20.700> which<00:03:20.910> looks<00:03:21.750> like<00:03:23.030> an<00:03:24.030> awful<00:03:24.540> move

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
takes e4 which looks like an awful move

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.280 
takes e4 which looks like an awful move
to<00:03:25.350> play<00:03:25.650> especially<00:03:26.640> given<00:03:26.970> rook<00:03:27.420> takes<00:03:27.660> f4

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
to play especially given rook takes f4

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.860 
to play especially given rook takes f4
is<00:03:28.560> now<00:03:29.160> possible<00:03:29.430> for<00:03:29.700> white<00:03:30.000> putting<00:03:30.600> more

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
is now possible for white putting more

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.520 
is now possible for white putting more
pressure<00:03:31.019> on<00:03:31.230> 84<00:03:32.660> so<00:03:33.660> really<00:03:34.019> its<00:03:34.290> it's

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
pressure on 84 so really its it's

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.160 
pressure on 84 so really its it's
looking<00:03:34.980> like<00:03:35.130> a<00:03:35.730> very<00:03:36.000> bossy<00:03:36.420> position<00:03:36.930> for

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
looking like a very bossy position for

looking like a very bossy position for
black<00:03:37.350> because<00:03:38.040> prop<00:03:38.310> supported<00:03:38.760> the<00:03:38.820> knight

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
black because prop supported the knight
