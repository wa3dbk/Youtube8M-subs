00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
a little different again but if it's wet

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.330 
a little different again but if it's wet
it<00:00:04.259> does<00:00:04.500> leave<00:00:05.120> it<00:00:06.120> doesn't<00:00:06.420> fill<00:00:06.600> it<00:00:06.690> back<00:00:06.870> in

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:07.340 
it does leave it doesn't fill it back in

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:12.140 
it does leave it doesn't fill it back in
the<00:00:08.340> dryer<00:00:08.700> it<00:00:09.030> works<00:00:09.240> ideal<00:00:10.759> see<00:00:11.759> I<00:00:11.790> don't<00:00:11.880> see

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
the dryer it works ideal see I don't see

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.540 
the dryer it works ideal see I don't see
that<00:00:12.179> as<00:00:12.389> a<00:00:12.420> problem<00:00:13.009> so<00:00:14.179> but<00:00:15.179> your

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:16.550 
that as a problem so but your

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.120 
that as a problem so but your
conditioning<00:00:17.550> in<00:00:17.640> a<00:00:17.730> spring<00:00:18.029> would<00:00:18.300> be<00:00:18.449> a<00:00:18.480> nice

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:19.130 
conditioning in a spring would be a nice

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.029 
conditioning in a spring would be a nice
nice<00:00:20.130> option<00:00:20.640> to<00:00:20.670> have<00:00:20.760> or<00:00:21.590> make<00:00:22.590> an<00:00:22.710> ideal

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
nice option to have or make an ideal

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.900 
nice option to have or make an ideal
seed<00:00:23.340> bed<00:00:23.550> because<00:00:23.789> it<00:00:24.390> does<00:00:24.600> have<00:00:24.840> it<00:00:25.350> isn't

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:25.910 
seed bed because it does have it isn't

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.460 
seed bed because it does have it isn't
you<00:00:26.910> no<00:00:27.029> matter<00:00:27.480> what<00:00:27.720> conditions<00:00:28.230> are<00:00:28.349> you

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
you no matter what conditions are you

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.319 
you no matter what conditions are you
gonna<00:00:28.590> have<00:00:28.800> some<00:00:29.010> roughness<00:00:30.679> right<00:00:31.679> I<00:00:32.329> think

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
gonna have some roughness right I think

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:34.670 
gonna have some roughness right I think
the<00:00:33.420> chunks<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:33.930> stuff<00:00:34.140> i<00:00:34.290> think<00:00:34.500> that's

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
the chunks and stuff i think that's

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.240 
the chunks and stuff i think that's
ideal<00:00:36.620> you<00:00:37.620> got<00:00:37.800> some<00:00:37.950> side<00:00:38.160> to<00:00:38.309> side<00:00:38.489> fracture

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250 
ideal you got some side to side fracture

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.670 
ideal you got some side to side fracture
but<00:00:41.250> what<00:00:41.460> does<00:00:41.790> concern<00:00:42.420> me<00:00:42.480> is<00:00:42.930> that<00:00:43.379> right

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
but what does concern me is that right

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.010 
but what does concern me is that right
there<00:00:44.070> that's<00:00:47.300> why<00:00:48.300> they<00:00:48.450> call<00:00:48.660> it<00:00:48.690> a<00:00:48.809> mole

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
there that's why they call it a mole

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.389 
there that's why they call it a mole
knife<00:00:50.690> water<00:00:51.690> water<00:00:52.140> so<00:00:52.469> you<00:00:52.500> put<00:00:52.860> that<00:00:52.980> smear

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
knife water water so you put that smear

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.049 
knife water water so you put that smear
at<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.579> bottom<00:00:55.160> like<00:00:56.160> that<00:00:56.370> that's<00:00:56.640> trawled

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
at the bottom like that that's trawled

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.299 
at the bottom like that that's trawled
off<00:00:57.300> roots<00:00:57.780> wrong<00:00:58.050> routes<00:00:58.410> have<00:00:58.620> a<00:00:58.680> heck<00:00:59.039> of<00:00:59.070> a

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
off roots wrong routes have a heck of a

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.049 
off roots wrong routes have a heck of a
time<00:00:59.489> trying<00:00:59.760> to<00:00:59.879> get<00:01:00.030> through<00:01:00.239> that<00:01:00.420> even

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
time trying to get through that even

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:05.600 
time trying to get through that even
that's<00:01:03.059> really<00:01:03.570> bothers<00:01:03.989> me<00:01:04.369> rather<00:01:05.369> than

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
that's really bothers me rather than

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.670 
that's really bothers me rather than
just<00:01:05.850> fracturing<00:01:06.420> it<00:01:06.600> with<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.930> right<00:01:07.439> and

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
just fracturing it with the right and

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.570 
just fracturing it with the right and
like<00:01:07.799> you<00:01:08.270> and<00:01:09.270> another<00:01:10.049> thing<00:01:10.350> why<00:01:11.100> they<00:01:11.340> call

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
like you and another thing why they call

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.060 
like you and another thing why they call
that<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:11.790> mole<00:01:12.090> knife<00:01:12.530> moles<00:01:13.530> can<00:01:13.830> literally

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
that a mole knife moles can literally

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.310 
that a mole knife moles can literally
run<00:01:14.310> in<00:01:14.490> there<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:14.850> run<00:01:15.630> from<00:01:15.780> one<00:01:15.990> end<00:01:16.200> of<00:01:16.259> the

trench and the water
running<00:02:13.740> and<00:02:13.920> your<00:02:14.010> zone<00:02:14.220> is<00:02:14.370> washed<00:02:14.610> out<00:02:16.760> and

running and your zone is washed out and

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.750 
running and your zone is washed out and
another<00:02:18.060> thing<00:02:18.860> that<00:02:19.860> concerns<00:02:20.310> me<00:02:20.460> with<00:02:20.730> a

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
another thing that concerns me with a

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.330 
another thing that concerns me with a
mole<00:02:21.060> knife<00:02:22.250> well<00:02:23.250> I'm<00:02:23.430> blessed<00:02:23.700> with<00:02:23.970> rocks

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
mole knife well I'm blessed with rocks

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.040 
mole knife well I'm blessed with rocks
I'm<00:02:26.340> blessed<00:02:26.700> with<00:02:26.940> rock<00:02:27.210> so<00:02:27.450> I'm<00:02:27.510> constantly

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
I'm blessed with rock so I'm constantly

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.680 
I'm blessed with rock so I'm constantly
breaking<00:02:28.860> shear<00:02:29.310> pins<00:02:29.610> and<00:02:29.880> bending<00:02:30.390> stuff

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
breaking shear pins and bending stuff

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.410 
breaking shear pins and bending stuff
but<00:02:33.690> the<00:02:33.840> mole<00:02:34.110> knife<00:02:34.410> has<00:02:34.740> a<00:02:34.770> tendency<00:02:35.420> you'll

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
but the mole knife has a tendency you'll

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.180 
but the mole knife has a tendency you'll
end<00:02:36.630> up<00:02:36.720> with<00:02:36.810> fertilizer<00:02:37.350> in<00:02:37.560> a<00:02:37.650> ribbon<00:02:38.040> down

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
end up with fertilizer in a ribbon down

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.620 
end up with fertilizer in a ribbon down
there<00:02:38.490> yep<00:02:39.390> right<00:02:40.080> on<00:02:40.110> that<00:02:40.470> trawled<00:02:40.920> off<00:02:41.220> a

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
there yep right on that trawled off a

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:47.120 
there yep right on that trawled off a
printer<00:02:42.630> runway<00:02:44.270> now<00:02:45.270> if<00:02:45.690> it<00:02:46.440> if<00:02:46.650> it<00:02:46.710> doesn't

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
printer runway now if it if it doesn't

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.710 
printer runway now if it if it doesn't
he<00:02:47.190> rolled<00:02:47.430> out<00:02:47.580> you're<00:02:47.790> a<00:02:47.820> nice<00:02:48.060> flat<00:02:48.390> ground

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
he rolled out you're a nice flat ground

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.020 
he rolled out you're a nice flat ground
if<00:02:48.870> it<00:02:49.020> doesn't<00:02:49.410> roll<00:02:50.100> it<00:02:50.190> out<00:02:50.930> it'll<00:02:51.930> take<00:02:52.380> and

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
if it doesn't roll it out it'll take and

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.460 
if it doesn't roll it out it'll take and
this<00:02:54.030> stuff<00:02:54.240> will<00:02:54.390> cave<00:02:54.630> down<00:02:54.840> you<00:02:55.080> got<00:02:55.200> a<00:02:55.230> nice

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
this stuff will cave down you got a nice

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.070 
this stuff will cave down you got a nice
on<00:02:55.770> your<00:02:55.950> fertilizers<00:02:56.490> right<00:02:56.700> there<00:02:57.060> and<00:02:57.450> it

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
on your fertilizers right there and it

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.720 
on your fertilizers right there and it
can<00:02:58.200> be<00:02:58.350> so<00:02:58.650> hot<00:02:58.890> so<00:02:59.190> highly<00:02:59.520> concentrated

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
can be so hot so highly concentrated

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.700 
can be so hot so highly concentrated
when<00:03:00.330> the<00:03:00.420> early<00:03:00.600> current<00:03:01.080> ruts<00:03:01.290> come<00:03:01.500> into

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:01.710 
when the early current ruts come into

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:04.940 
when the early current ruts come into
that<00:03:02.240> it<00:03:03.240> can<00:03:03.570> actually<00:03:03.990> kind<00:03:04.470> of<00:03:04.560> burn<00:03:04.770> them

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
that it can actually kind of burn them

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:10.010 
that it can actually kind of burn them
it's<00:03:05.220> so<00:03:05.430> hot<00:03:07.370> seeing<00:03:08.370> I<00:03:08.790> like<00:03:09.480> the<00:03:09.630> idea<00:03:09.750> of

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
it's so hot seeing I like the idea of

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.750 
it's so hot seeing I like the idea of
blending<00:03:10.620> fertilizer<00:03:11.070> throughout<00:03:11.490> this

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
blending fertilizer throughout this

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.820 
blending fertilizer throughout this
whole<00:03:12.090> this<00:03:12.690> whole<00:03:12.750> area<00:03:13.470> and<00:03:13.680> that<00:03:14.600> if<00:03:15.830> we

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
whole this whole area and that if we

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.330 
whole this whole area and that if we
fluff<00:03:17.160> and<00:03:17.400> condition<00:03:17.880> this<00:03:18.090> we're<00:03:18.450> not<00:03:18.600> your

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
fluff and condition this we're not your

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.070 
fluff and condition this we're not your
urine<00:03:20.340> honest<00:03:20.730> five<00:03:21.090> to<00:03:21.360> six<00:03:21.600> inches<00:03:21.780> deep

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
urine honest five to six inches deep

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
urine honest five to six inches deep
here<00:03:22.640> yep<00:03:23.990> so<00:03:24.990> in<00:03:25.140> the<00:03:25.230> spring<00:03:25.530> we<00:03:25.710> won't<00:03:25.890> want

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
here yep so in the spring we won't want

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.070 
here yep so in the spring we won't want
to<00:03:26.220> fly<00:03:26.400> from<00:03:26.640> we<00:03:26.970> would<00:03:27.180> not<00:03:27.390> want<00:03:27.690> to<00:03:27.780> fluff

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
to fly from we would not want to fluff

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.320 
to fly from we would not want to fluff
and<00:03:28.410> condition<00:03:29.190> in<00:03:29.310> the<00:03:29.400> spring<00:03:29.700> deep<00:03:29.970> enough

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
and condition in the spring deep enough

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.550 
and condition in the spring deep enough
to<00:03:31.230> fracture<00:03:31.560> and<00:03:31.860> disturb<00:03:32.460> that<00:03:33.410> smear<00:03:34.410> and

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
to fracture and disturb that smear and

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.430 
to fracture and disturb that smear and
kick<00:03:35.280> that<00:03:35.520> fertilizer<00:03:36.000> and<00:03:36.390> blend<00:03:37.020> it<00:03:37.140> around

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
kick that fertilizer and blend it around

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.860 
kick that fertilizer and blend it around
in<00:03:37.650> a<00:03:37.770> zone<00:03:38.030> so<00:03:39.030> it's<00:03:39.150> going<00:03:39.270> to<00:03:39.330> stay<00:03:39.540> in<00:03:39.570> that

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
in a zone so it's going to stay in that

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.770 
in a zone so it's going to stay in that
rhythm<00:03:40.050> and<00:03:40.490> if<00:03:41.490> we<00:03:41.640> get<00:03:41.760> on<00:03:41.910> a<00:03:41.940> slope<00:03:42.330> for<00:03:42.630> that

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
rhythm and if we get on a slope for that

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.940 
rhythm and if we get on a slope for that
zone<00:03:43.310> that<00:03:44.310> that<00:03:44.790> little<00:03:44.970> mole<00:03:45.270> hole<00:03:45.950> got

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
zone that that little mole hole got

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:48.740 
zone that that little mole hole got
water<00:03:47.220> running<00:03:47.640> in<00:03:47.760> it<00:03:47.850> it'll<00:03:48.090> take<00:03:48.330> that<00:03:48.540> pin

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
water running in it it'll take that pin

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:55.000 
water running in it it'll take that pin
can<00:03:49.080> carry<00:03:49.800> it<00:03:49.920> away

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:01.660 

yeah<00:03:56.010> she's<00:03:56.280> got<00:03:56.459> a<00:03:56.519> tunnel<00:03:56.909> there

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:04.570 

but<00:04:02.330> you<00:04:02.480> do<00:04:02.690> have<00:04:02.959> you<00:04:03.349> do<00:04:03.590> have<00:04:03.890> you<00:04:04.190> do<00:04:04.370> have

but you do have you do have you do have

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.440 
but you do have you do have you do have
pretty<00:04:04.880> nice<00:04:05.180> side-to-side<00:04:05.599> fracture<00:04:06.590> I<00:04:07.450> like

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450 
pretty nice side-to-side fracture I like

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.180 
pretty nice side-to-side fracture I like
how<00:04:08.660> you<00:04:08.720> don't<00:04:09.080> you're<00:04:09.590> trashed<00:04:09.950> your

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190 
how you don't you're trashed your

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:12.339 
how you don't you're trashed your
residue<00:04:10.640> managers<00:04:11.120> aren't<00:04:11.420> set<00:04:11.750> deep<00:04:12.020> enough

residue managers aren't set deep enough

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:15.760 
residue managers aren't set deep enough
to<00:04:12.849> make<00:04:13.849> a<00:04:13.880> rut<00:04:14.270> or<00:04:14.300> you<00:04:14.900> know<00:04:15.020> you're<00:04:15.620> not

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:15.770 
to make a rut or you know you're not

to make a rut or you know you're not
wolf<00:04:16.100> and<00:04:16.310> wind<00:04:16.489> rose<00:04:16.669> to<00:04:16.820> the<00:04:16.910> side<00:04:17.120> that's

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:17.419 
wolf and wind rose to the side that's

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:21.220 
wolf and wind rose to the side that's
nice<00:04:18.820> this<00:04:19.820> is<00:04:20.000> perfect<00:04:20.299> it's<00:04:20.989> thought<00:04:21.139> it'd

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:21.230 
nice this is perfect it's thought it'd

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:24.390 
nice this is perfect it's thought it'd
be<00:04:21.260> fun<00:04:21.530> tomorrow<00:04:22.870> for<00:04:23.870> the<00:04:23.900> demonstration

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 
be fun tomorrow for the demonstration

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.530 
be fun tomorrow for the demonstration
just<00:04:25.400> to<00:04:25.490> have<00:04:25.610> guys<00:04:25.820> walk<00:04:26.090> through<00:04:26.389> its

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:26.540 
just to have guys walk through its

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:31.890 
just to have guys walk through its
different<00:04:26.990> things<00:04:27.200> I<00:04:27.380> I<00:04:27.970> think<00:04:28.970> and<00:04:29.240> you<00:04:29.630> know

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.150 

that's<00:04:32.900> a<00:04:32.990> good<00:04:33.139> comparison<00:04:33.560> that's<00:04:33.950> why<00:04:34.130> I

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
that's a good comparison that's why I

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.210 
that's a good comparison that's why I
want<00:04:34.340> to<00:04:34.460> see<00:04:34.639> between<00:04:34.940> the<00:04:35.210> two<00:04:35.389> and<00:04:36.070> we<00:04:37.070> could

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
want to see between the two and we could

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.760
