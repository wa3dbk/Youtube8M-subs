00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.230
 We wish best regards 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.520

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.700
 To Tokayu screen that'll let the 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:33.200

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:33.200
 Hey Nor when I go shopping 8 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.500

 If you press Finish 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:06.520
 Here 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:12.030
 I'm here to let you know when I was 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:12.030
 There is a way to use other than this a little 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:20.270
 For example 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:25.659
 I write like this and let me complete the note 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:27.030
 Then you see that it's a little orange here 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:29.960

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.970
 Pup 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:38.180
 Like this 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:42.430
 There are display or event creation on the calendar, copy, etc. 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.430

 Here is what it means 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:06.740
 You can put in it already, but instead of a little note later like this 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.740
 Because you can add events 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:18.280
 It's always very useful 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:22.380
 Since the example Well notification can also do not forget, for example, whether an event notice 30 minutes before the 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.380

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.080
 I thought it was a bit convenient 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.640

 When I think I can do it 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:47.120
