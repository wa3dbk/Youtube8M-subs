00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
comment on whether it's nice or not

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.720 
comment on whether it's nice or not
you're<00:00:43.260> just<00:00:43.590> checking<00:00:44.070> whether<00:00:44.190> it's<00:00:44.460> caught

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
you're just checking whether it's caught

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.940 
you're just checking whether it's caught
so<00:00:45.360> you<00:00:45.450> don't<00:00:45.600> even<00:00:45.840> need<00:00:45.930> to<00:00:45.989> sip<00:00:46.320> it<00:00:46.350> the

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
so you don't even need to sip it the

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.889 
so you don't even need to sip it the
correct<00:00:47.340> thing<00:00:47.640> apparently<00:00:48.000> is<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.690> give<00:00:48.809> it

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
correct thing apparently is to give it

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.020 
correct thing apparently is to give it
an<00:00:49.020> imperious<00:00:49.680> sniff<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.370> if<00:00:50.730> it's<00:00:50.879> not

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
an imperious sniff and if it's not

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.080 
an imperious sniff and if it's not
caught<00:00:51.360> a<00:00:51.660> cold<00:00:52.020> nod<00:00:52.469> well<00:00:53.460> I<00:00:53.489> can't<00:00:53.879> do<00:00:54.059> that

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
caught a cold nod well I can't do that

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.000 
caught a cold nod well I can't do that
I'd<00:00:54.570> feel<00:00:54.750> like<00:00:54.899> a<00:00:54.930> complete<00:00:55.440> asshole

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
I'd feel like a complete asshole

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.610 
I'd feel like a complete asshole
and<00:00:56.309> anyway<00:00:57.120> wine<00:00:57.420> is<00:00:57.629> almost<00:00:57.899> never<00:00:58.230> caught

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
and anyway wine is almost never caught

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.590 
and anyway wine is almost never caught
and<00:00:59.010> even<00:00:59.370> if<00:00:59.460> it<00:00:59.550> was<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.969> waiter<00:01:00.210> would<00:01:00.420> do<00:01:00.570> a

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
and even if it was the waiter would do a

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.939 
and even if it was the waiter would do a
much<00:01:00.840> better<00:01:01.079> job<00:01:01.199> than<00:01:01.410> I<00:01:01.649> would<00:01:01.920> have

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
much better job than I would have

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.860 
much better job than I would have

he's thinking of using just so I can let
him<00:01:18.689> know<00:01:18.780> if<00:01:18.960> I<00:01:19.020> reckon<00:01:19.320> it's<00:01:19.439> sharp<00:01:19.710> enough

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:19.939 
him know if I reckon it's sharp enough

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:22.550 
him know if I reckon it's sharp enough
know<00:01:20.939> if<00:01:21.240> there's<00:01:21.570> going<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:21.810> be<00:01:21.900> a<00:01:21.960> convention

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
know if there's going to be a convention

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.530 
know if there's going to be a convention
of<00:01:22.710> being<00:01:22.950> given<00:01:23.130> a<00:01:23.310> preview<00:01:23.820> of<00:01:24.030> any<00:01:24.150> drink

of being given a preview of any drink

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.359 
of being given a preview of any drink
then<00:01:24.840> it<00:01:24.960> would<00:01:25.049> make<00:01:25.229> much<00:01:25.560> more<00:01:25.799> sense<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:26.250> do

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
then it would make much more sense to do

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.969 
then it would make much more sense to do
it<00:01:26.400> with<00:01:26.610> bitter<00:01:26.939> you<00:01:27.360> know<00:01:27.390> Real<00:01:27.780> Ale<00:01:27.990> firstly

it with bitter you know Real Ale firstly

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.620 
it with bitter you know Real Ale firstly
because<00:01:29.250> there<00:01:29.369> are<00:01:29.520> far<00:01:29.790> more<00:01:29.850> things<00:01:30.360> that

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
because there are far more things that

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.690 
because there are far more things that
can<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:31.079> do<00:01:31.200> go<00:01:31.439> wrong<00:01:31.650> with<00:01:31.799> it<00:01:31.829> and<00:01:32.040> secondly

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
can and do go wrong with it and secondly

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.460 
can and do go wrong with it and secondly
because<00:01:32.880> very<00:01:33.299> often<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.720> bar<00:01:33.930> staff<00:01:34.229> are

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
because very often the bar staff are

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.380 
because very often the bar staff are
foreign<00:01:34.860> which<00:01:35.280> is<00:01:35.430> fine<00:01:35.670> of<00:01:35.880> course<00:01:35.909> I'm<00:01:36.240> not

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
foreign which is fine of course I'm not

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.929 
foreign which is fine of course I'm not
