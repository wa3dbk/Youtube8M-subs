then this rubber grip comes off so what
I<00:00:53.640> end<00:00:53.820> up<00:00:53.940> doing<00:00:54.390> is<00:00:54.860> I<00:00:55.860> took<00:00:56.400> one<00:00:56.790> of<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.000> old

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
I end up doing is I took one of the old

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.069 
I end up doing is I took one of the old
used<00:00:57.750> nibs<00:00:58.050> that<00:00:58.290> I<00:00:58.320> had<00:00:58.560> and<00:00:59.240> I<00:01:01.670> shaved<00:01:02.670> it

00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:03.079 
used nibs that I had and I shaved it

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:05.840 
used nibs that I had and I shaved it
with<00:01:04.079> the<00:01:04.170> razor<00:01:04.379> blade<00:01:04.739> just<00:01:05.430> held<00:01:05.670> it<00:01:05.790> I

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
with the razor blade just held it I

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.950 
with the razor blade just held it I
guess<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.150> table<00:01:06.570> and<00:01:06.810> I<00:01:07.259> shaved<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:08.960> little

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
guess the table and I shaved a little

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.980 
guess the table and I shaved a little
chunk<00:01:10.259> off<00:01:10.470> I<00:01:11.299> mean<00:01:12.299> there's<00:01:12.600> probably<00:01:12.780> a

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
chunk off I mean there's probably a

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.719 
chunk off I mean there's probably a
hundred<00:01:13.259> million<00:01:13.470> ways<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:13.799> do<00:01:14.069> this<00:01:14.310> but<00:01:14.579> this

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
hundred million ways to do this but this

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.429 
hundred million ways to do this but this
is<00:01:14.880> just<00:01:15.030> my<00:01:15.240> way<00:01:15.420> of<00:01:15.450> doing<00:01:15.780> it<00:01:15.899> because<00:01:16.020> I

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
is just my way of doing it because I

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.620 
is just my way of doing it because I
mean<00:01:17.249> I've<00:01:17.399> already<00:01:17.579> already<00:01:18.060> had<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.390> nib

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
mean I've already already had the nib

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.809 
mean I've already already had the nib
and<00:01:19.069> it<00:01:20.069> was<00:01:20.340> free<00:01:20.609> so<00:01:21.469> but<00:01:22.469> in<00:01:22.530> any<00:01:22.619> case<00:01:22.710> I<00:01:23.219> got

00:01:23.809 --> 00:01:23.819 
and it was free so but in any case I got

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:30.349 
and it was free so but in any case I got
a<00:01:23.850> little<00:01:23.999> shaving<00:01:24.329> off<00:01:25.079> of<00:01:25.469> the<00:01:25.560> nib<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:29.359> now

00:01:30.349 --> 00:01:30.359 
a little shaving off of the nib and now

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:35.840 
a little shaving off of the nib and now
I<00:01:31.850> end<00:01:32.850> up<00:01:32.969> jamming<00:01:33.479> it<00:01:33.600> into<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:34.109> end<00:01:34.670> to<00:01:35.670> kind

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
I end up jamming it into the end to kind

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.840 
I end up jamming it into the end to kind
of<00:01:36.030> compensate<00:01:36.719> for<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.170> button<00:01:37.759> okay<00:01:39.079> so<00:01:40.850> I'm

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
of compensate for the button okay so I'm

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.750 
of compensate for the button okay so I'm
going<00:01:41.999> to<00:01:42.090> put<00:01:42.270> it<00:01:42.389> in<00:01:42.509> now

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:46.760 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:53.510 

both<00:01:47.760> buttons<00:01:48.030> work<00:01:48.270> now<00:01:51.230> there<00:01:52.230> you<00:01:52.320> go<00:01:52.520> now

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
both buttons work now there you go now

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.700 
both buttons work now there you go now
like<00:01:53.700> I<00:01:53.820> said<00:01:53.880> in<00:01:54.330> the<00:01:54.540> rare<00:01:54.750> case<00:01:55.050> that<00:01:55.530> this

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
like I said in the rare case that this

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.520 
like I said in the rare case that this
does<00:01:55.980> happen<00:01:56.220> to<00:01:56.450> which<00:01:57.450> I'm<00:01:57.690> sure<00:01:57.960> it

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
does happen to which I'm sure it

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.510 
does happen to which I'm sure it
probably<00:01:58.800> won't<00:01:59.190> but<00:01:59.760> um<00:02:01.160> well<00:02:02.160> there's<00:02:02.430> a

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
probably won't but um well there's a

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.180 
probably won't but um well there's a
temporary<00:02:03.120> solution<00:02:03.440> so<00:02:04.440> I'm<00:02:04.680> pretty<00:02:04.860> stingy

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
temporary solution so I'm pretty stingy

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.020 
temporary solution so I'm pretty stingy
and<00:02:05.490> I<00:02:05.550> never<00:02:05.700> want<00:02:05.940> to<00:02:06.000> buy<00:02:06.150> anything<00:02:06.360> so<00:02:08.030> here

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
and I never want to buy anything so here

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.680 
and I never want to buy anything so here
it<00:02:09.119> is

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.040 

okay<00:02:13.690> draws<00:02:14.190> first<00:02:15.190> button

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
okay draws first button

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.960 
okay draws first button
the<00:02:17.500> second<00:02:17.950> button<00:02:18.100> one<00:02:18.730> that<00:02:18.850> we<00:02:18.910> fixed<00:02:20.970> you

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
the second button one that we fixed you

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.780 
the second button one that we fixed you
hold<00:02:22.150> it<00:02:22.270> down<00:02:22.390> it's<00:02:22.600> kinda<00:02:22.780> like<00:02:22.840> a<00:02:22.960> airbrush

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
hold it down it's kinda like a airbrush

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.160 
hold it down it's kinda like a airbrush
so<00:02:25.410> alright<00:02:26.410> there<00:02:26.980> you<00:02:27.040> go
