00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
like this before so what I'm going to do

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.510 
like this before so what I'm going to do
this<00:02:23.080> couple<00:02:23.350> demonstration<00:02:23.980> perhaps<00:02:24.220> real

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
this couple demonstration perhaps real

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.880 
this couple demonstration perhaps real
quick<00:02:24.820> you<00:02:25.210> can<00:02:25.360> choose<00:02:25.600> to<00:02:25.810> do<00:02:25.960> a<00:02:25.990> low<00:02:26.290> bar<00:02:26.590> or

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
quick you can choose to do a low bar or

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.340 
quick you can choose to do a low bar or
a<00:02:26.920> high<00:02:27.459> bar<00:02:27.790> for<00:02:27.820> this<00:02:28.150> exercise<00:02:28.750> I'm<00:02:29.290> going

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
a high bar for this exercise I'm going

00:02:29.350 --> 00:03:00.680 
a high bar for this exercise I'm going
to<00:02:29.740> do<00:02:29.890> a<00:02:29.920> high-low

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.240 

so<00:03:01.690> just<00:03:01.900> like<00:03:02.049> that<00:03:02.260> guy's<00:03:02.440> a<00:03:02.470> barbell<00:03:03.010> back

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
so just like that guy's a barbell back

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.550 
so just like that guy's a barbell back
to<00:03:03.430> what<00:03:03.700> now<00:03:03.940> obviously<00:03:04.269> you<00:03:05.260> know<00:03:05.410> they're

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
to what now obviously you know they're

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.500 
to what now obviously you know they're
going<00:03:05.709> to<00:03:05.830> be<00:03:05.980> doing<00:03:06.160> the<00:03:06.400> exercise<00:03:06.910> outside

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
going to be doing the exercise outside

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.690 
going to be doing the exercise outside
of<00:03:07.660> the<00:03:07.720> lab<00:03:07.959> utilize<00:03:08.769> their<00:03:09.010> active<00:03:09.459> safety

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
of the lab utilize their active safety

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:20.320 
of the lab utilize their active safety
cells<00:03:10.480> move<00:03:10.660> on<00:03:10.840> to<00:03:11.049> the<00:03:11.140> next<00:03:11.290> exercise

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.970 

the<00:03:21.330> second<00:03:21.690> exercise<00:03:21.990> you<00:03:22.350> gonna<00:03:22.500> do<00:03:22.770> is

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
the second exercise you gonna do is

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.130 
the second exercise you gonna do is
going<00:03:23.280> to<00:03:23.340> be<00:03:23.460> a<00:03:23.490> dump<00:03:23.910> and<00:03:24.090> a<00:03:24.630> one

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
going to be a dump and a one

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.930 
going to be a dump and a one
now<00:03:25.530> for<00:03:25.800> this<00:03:25.860> exercise<00:03:26.070> are<00:03:26.670> going<00:03:26.790> to<00:03:26.880> do

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
now for this exercise are going to do

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.480 
now for this exercise are going to do
one<00:03:27.240> warm-up<00:03:27.720> set<00:03:28.020> it<00:03:28.440> is<00:03:28.590> going<00:03:28.890> to<00:03:29.010> be<00:03:29.160> just

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:29.490 
one warm-up set it is going to be just

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:33.380 
one warm-up set it is going to be just
one<00:03:29.790> set<00:03:30.120> of<00:03:30.390> ten<00:03:30.900> bodyweight<00:03:31.680> lunges<00:03:32.490> as<00:03:33.150> soon

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
one set of ten bodyweight lunges as soon

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.390 
one set of ten bodyweight lunges as soon
as<00:03:33.510> you<00:03:33.600> finish<00:03:33.900> the<00:03:34.050> warm-up<00:03:34.440> set<00:03:34.740> give<00:03:35.250> you<00:03:35.310> a

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
as you finish the warm-up set give you a

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.280 
as you finish the warm-up set give you a
rate<00:03:35.580> to<00:03:35.760> the<00:03:35.790> working<00:03:36.330> sets<00:03:36.630> which<00:03:37.050> are<00:03:37.170> going

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
rate to the working sets which are going

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.040 
rate to the working sets which are going
to<00:03:37.410> be<00:03:37.470> five<00:03:37.770> sets<00:03:38.220> of<00:03:38.400> five<00:03:38.820> repetitions<00:03:39.390> and

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.050 
to be five sets of five repetitions and

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:41.960 
to be five sets of five repetitions and
the<00:03:40.380> weight<00:03:40.650> you're<00:03:40.860> going<00:03:41.040> to<00:03:41.160> use<00:03:41.370> is<00:03:41.790> going

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
the weight you're going to use is going

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:43.820 
the weight you're going to use is going
to<00:03:42.300> be<00:03:42.390> heavy<00:03:42.720> enough<00:03:42.960> so<00:03:43.260> you<00:03:43.350> really<00:03:43.650> push

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
to be heavy enough so you really push

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:45.950 
to be heavy enough so you really push
the<00:03:43.980> partners<00:03:44.550> five<00:03:44.760> legs<00:03:45.120> but<00:03:45.630> you're<00:03:45.750> still

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:45.960 
the partners five legs but you're still

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.290 
the partners five legs but you're still
able<00:03:46.170> to<00:03:46.410> maintain<00:03:46.550> proper<00:03:47.550> form<00:03:47.580> throughout

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:48.300 
able to maintain proper form throughout

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.120 
able to maintain proper form throughout
the<00:03:48.480> movement<00:03:48.750> so<00:03:49.530> we're<00:03:49.620> gonna<00:03:49.740> do<00:03:49.860> a<00:03:49.890> couple

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
the movement so we're gonna do a couple

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:51.800 
the movement so we're gonna do a couple
demonstration<00:03:50.850> repetitions<00:03:51.390> real<00:03:51.540> quick

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
demonstration repetitions real quick

00:03:51.810 --> 00:04:09.770 
demonstration repetitions real quick
just<00:04:06.410> like<00:04:07.410> that<00:04:07.680> guys<00:04:07.920> so<00:04:08.460> five<00:04:08.700> sets<00:04:09.120> of<00:04:09.330> five

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
just like that guys so five sets of five

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.050 
just like that guys so five sets of five
repetitions<00:04:10.350> now<00:04:11.190> move<00:04:11.400> on<00:04:11.550> to<00:04:11.580> the<00:04:11.820> next

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
repetitions now move on to the next

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.540 
repetitions now move on to the next
exercise<00:04:12.450> which<00:04:13.020> is<00:04:13.320> going<00:04:13.470> to<00:04:13.590> be<00:04:13.770> a<00:04:13.800> Romanian

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:14.550 
exercise which is going to be a Romanian

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:22.810 
exercise which is going to be a Romanian

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
working set you're going to do five sets

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:37.700 
working set you're going to do five sets
of<00:04:35.370> five<00:04:35.820> repetitions<00:04:36.410> and<00:04:37.410> you're<00:04:37.500> going<00:04:37.680> to

of five repetitions and you're going to

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.560 
of five repetitions and you're going to
have<00:04:37.889> to<00:04:38.040> get<00:04:38.220> close<00:04:38.550> to<00:04:38.580> you<00:04:38.820> five<00:04:39.060> with<00:04:39.300> Max

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.570 
have to get close to you five with Max

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.420 
have to get close to you five with Max
pretty<00:04:39.990> quickly<00:04:40.320> because<00:04:40.919> you're<00:04:41.070> only<00:04:41.160> doing
