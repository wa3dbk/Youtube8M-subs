00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.540
 second episode of the live nation straw 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.540
 in fact in the first episode we had 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.530
 found from the low levels by making a 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.450
 budget a little special 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.740
 however if you missed it go to it 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.920

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:00.240
 description of the first episode and nothing 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.920
 they are always here with the same 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.920
 village moments I changed from 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.320
 available you can have some small ones 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.840
 novelty I'm doing the reggina at 8 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.619
 it is not Italy the clan I was with 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.350
 in the call with which they are in like fucking 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.510
 it is called with the first with the first profile 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.840
 ie of useless then I really am 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:24.510
 hairs denied are like fiftieth 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.690
 the units are only in 30 are not in 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:30.750
 28 without movements without mounting me 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:33.500
 because I'm 88 just annoys him 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.690
 in fact all the best samples is 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:39.090
 the emerging 3 so what we do today 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:42.000
 we find them in attack I did some 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.920
 giant Azerbaijani and gods barbarians 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.530
 essential wall spakka 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.869
 then I did four healing and let's go 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.429
 and let's go find them 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.200
 then I own myself in the castle 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:58.440
 asked beautiful troops who 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:59.970
 they have and I find matches then this no 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:04.620
 guys too strong 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:07.470
 I can't make these guys don't 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:10.320
 can make perfect guys then we have 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.180
 found it is a pretty village 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.220
 powerful that I do n't know if anyway I can 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.050
 do one hundred percent because it really is 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.100
 really strong then I would say of 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.100
 start 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:25.120
 issue a curative on here why 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.460
 obviously can they escape from the healing 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.350
 that bastards 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.810
 then where do I want to do a work of 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:34.540
 solidarity pro escaped me then 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:37.000
 I would say first of all to put in the king 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.290
 barbaric here because obviously he is 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.060
 must make the poor muscles i 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:44.440
 let's do some road then 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:46.750
 put immediately and some of the archers 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.430
 obviously here we put them all then 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.290
 let's get barbarians right away too 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.270
 let's also have two companies because they are boys 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.710
 we have to do everything fast because otherwise 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:55.870
 we lose boys we lose we lose 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:03:01.450
 we lose then we put the giants from 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:05.350
 this part we put a healing cure 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:10.150
 in the corner and then we put two more 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:11.920
 giants of the archers boys i 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:16.800
 archers with this really concentrated 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:20.590
 we do not put the clan troops here then 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:22.210
 all the wall smashes here of course 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.470
 are essential to wall spots because of the 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:25.840
 troops have not yet entered 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.400
 inside the village is perfect 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.070
 so let's see that they break all the 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.890
 wall this perfect guys too 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:36.940
 we still see pam one hundred percent 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:38.970
 boys perfect number guys 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:43.150
 it really was an attack and spikes but 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:46.660
 in attack it is not known if it was then 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:48.430
 really a typical attack and let's see 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.620
 guys if we can attack others 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.900
 villages however I doubt it because it is 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:57.790
 really difficult then let's try 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:59.650
 no no no no then let's try this 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.120
 village then I would say to attack it 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.100
 seriously because we really do 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:06.690
 few troops let's see if we can then 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:10.890
 we put them an archer here 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:13.050
 and a curative here then I would say of 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:18.720
 put all the files exactly 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:22.019
 here then a wall splits here eleven i 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:25.380
 our only barbarelli here then one 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:29.640
 curative still here because we don't like it 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:31.680
 yellow and my boys so far 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:33.930
 we did 23 percent 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.700
 I don't know if we can do it but also the 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.980
 100%, however , made with one 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:41.070
 I doubt we guys got to know 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:44.610
 in short, these poor people are what they are 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:46.020
 troops on 7 as on troops on 6 as 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.640
 he was the first one in the department 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.730
 facts we have made known the 

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:52.680
 rhubarb and my boys came to me 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:55.830
 another idea anyway since I do 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:05:00.600
 the sexy intro of themes write me in 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:03.300
 comments that sexy made to take place occurred 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:05.250
 also in mind to make a sexy faq ie 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:08.790
 I make you wonder and then you 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:10.200
 answer in the comments for short 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:12.570
 make the channel a little more active 

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:14.220
 make you a little more active 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:16.710

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:19.040
 cute then guys my sexy fakti 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:19.040

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.479
 of troy and we found them both in 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:38.090
 attack than in defense
