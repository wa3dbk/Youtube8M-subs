00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:07.320 
keep it out of landfills this is an

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:11.390 
keep it out of landfills this is an
example<00:06:07.770> of<00:06:08.130> a<00:06:08.460> conduit<00:06:09.000> stub<00:06:09.450> this<00:06:10.350> is<00:06:10.710> a<00:06:10.980> nine

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:11.400 
example of a conduit stub this is a nine

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:14.240 
example of a conduit stub this is a nine
inch<00:06:11.670> stub<00:06:12.150> or<00:06:12.480> the<00:06:12.930> bend<00:06:13.200> from<00:06:13.740> the<00:06:13.860> ground

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:14.250 
inch stub or the bend from the ground

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:16.520 
inch stub or the bend from the ground
where<00:06:14.550> you<00:06:14.580> bend<00:06:14.910> it<00:06:15.060> is<00:06:15.210> a<00:06:15.600> total<00:06:16.140> of<00:06:16.260> nine

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:16.530 
where you bend it is a total of nine

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:19.670 
where you bend it is a total of nine
inches<00:06:16.880> the<00:06:17.880> bender<00:06:18.300> says<00:06:18.570> deduct<00:06:19.290> five

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:19.680 
inches the bender says deduct five

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:24.320 
inches the bender says deduct five
inches<00:06:20.160> for<00:06:20.610> stub<00:06:21.110> so<00:06:22.110> the<00:06:23.100> first<00:06:23.430> five<00:06:23.820> inches

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:24.330 
inches for stub so the first five inches

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:28.880 
inches for stub so the first five inches
is<00:06:24.890> from<00:06:25.890> the<00:06:26.010> ground<00:06:26.250> to<00:06:26.910> the<00:06:26.940> arrow<00:06:27.600> and<00:06:27.930> the

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:28.890 
is from the ground to the arrow and the

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:31.970 
is from the ground to the arrow and the
four<00:06:29.190> inches<00:06:29.610> is<00:06:29.910> where<00:06:30.210> you<00:06:30.450> mark<00:06:31.170> the<00:06:31.740> mark

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:31.980 
four inches is where you mark the mark

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:36.770 
four inches is where you mark the mark
so<00:06:32.850> nine<00:06:33.630> a<00:06:34.050> total<00:06:34.920> of<00:06:35.040> nine<00:06:35.390> subtract<00:06:36.390> five

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:36.780 
so nine a total of nine subtract five

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:39.020 
so nine a total of nine subtract five
you<00:06:36.990> make<00:06:37.200> your<00:06:37.410> mark<00:06:37.620> at<00:06:37.890> four<00:06:38.250> inches<00:06:38.730> and

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:39.030 
you make your mark at four inches and

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:44.540 
you make your mark at four inches and
then<00:06:39.810> you<00:06:39.960> put<00:06:40.230> that<00:06:40.700> mark<00:06:42.320> at<00:06:43.320> the<00:06:43.950> arrow<00:06:44.190> on

over make a mark and then you put that
mark<00:07:26.190> at<00:07:26.490> the<00:07:27.150> star<00:07:27.450> and<00:07:27.810> the<00:07:28.710> star<00:07:29.040> is<00:07:29.370> for

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:30.240 
mark at the star and the star is for

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:36.020 
mark at the star and the star is for
back-to-back<00:07:30.930> bends<00:07:31.940> it<00:07:32.940> says<00:07:33.120> back<00:07:33.450> up<00:07:35.030> says

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:36.030 
back-to-back bends it says back up says

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:39.650 
back-to-back bends it says back up says
back<00:07:36.360> of<00:07:36.690> 90<00:07:37.230> degree<00:07:37.669> that's<00:07:38.669> for<00:07:39.030> the<00:07:39.120> back<00:07:39.360> to

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:39.660 
back of 90 degree that's for the back to

back of 90 degree that's for the back to
back<00:07:39.870> bends<00:07:40.440> then<00:07:41.100> you<00:07:41.220> will<00:07:41.370> wind<00:07:41.610> up<00:07:41.790> with<00:07:41.850> an

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:42.120 
back bends then you will wind up with an

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:44.960 
back bends then you will wind up with an
exact<00:07:42.570> Bend
