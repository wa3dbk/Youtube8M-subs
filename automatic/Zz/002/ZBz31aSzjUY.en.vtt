it's<00:02:23.840> been<00:02:23.870> it's<00:02:24.709> been<00:02:24.769> a<00:02:24.920> very<00:02:25.040> pleasant

00:02:25.179 --> 00:02:25.189 
it's been it's been a very pleasant

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:26.649 
it's been it's been a very pleasant
trenchless<00:02:25.730> if<00:02:25.939> the<00:02:26.030> trenches<00:02:26.329> were<00:02:26.450> like<00:02:26.599> the

00:02:26.649 --> 00:02:26.659 
trenchless if the trenches were like the

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:29.770 
trenchless if the trenches were like the
past<00:02:26.810> yes<00:02:27.489> but<00:02:28.489> yes<00:02:28.670> I<00:02:28.849> mean<00:02:28.879> it<00:02:29.120> we<00:02:29.389> have<00:02:29.569> we

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:33.379 
is there is an understanding and a

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:34.899 
is there is an understanding and a
knowledge<00:02:33.680> from<00:02:34.010> all<00:02:34.129> of<00:02:34.250> us<00:02:34.370> that<00:02:34.519> we<00:02:34.670> are<00:02:34.760> the

00:02:34.899 --> 00:02:34.909 
knowledge from all of us that we are the

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:36.190 
knowledge from all of us that we are the
only<00:02:35.060> three<00:02:35.299> people<00:02:35.599> that<00:02:35.719> know<00:02:35.900> what<00:02:35.930> it's

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
only three people that know what it's

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.140 
only three people that know what it's
like<00:02:36.230> to<00:02:36.349> go<00:02:36.590> through<00:02:36.620> this<00:02:37.129> mad<00:02:37.519> ten<00:02:37.879> years

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
like to go through this mad ten years

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.119 
like to go through this mad ten years
and<00:02:38.780> be<00:02:39.680> at<00:02:39.769> the<00:02:39.799> center<00:02:40.129> of<00:02:40.189> it<00:02:41.889> so<00:02:42.889> yeah<00:02:43.099> I

00:02:43.119 --> 00:02:43.129 
and be at the center of it so yeah I

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:47.309 
and be at the center of it so yeah I
mean<00:02:43.430> it's<00:02:43.730> there<00:02:44.269> is<00:02:44.450> certainly<00:02:44.870> a<00:02:45.459> pretty

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:47.319 
mean it's there is certainly a pretty

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:49.809 
mean it's there is certainly a pretty
firm<00:02:48.319> bond<00:02:48.650> between<00:02:48.950> all<00:02:49.129> three<00:02:49.459> of<00:02:49.489> us<00:02:49.700> I

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:49.819 
firm bond between all three of us I

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:52.210 
firm bond between all three of us I
would<00:02:50.000> say<00:02:50.030> yeah<00:02:50.480> and<00:02:50.720> it'll<00:02:51.650> probably<00:02:51.829> never

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
would say yeah and it'll probably never

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.860 
would say yeah and it'll probably never
end<00:02:52.489> because<00:02:52.730> your<00:02:52.879> program<00:02:53.239> was<00:02:53.389> pretty<00:02:53.719> well

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
end because your program was pretty well

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.780 
end because your program was pretty well

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
family I would think by now yeah pretty

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.640 
family I would think by now yeah pretty
much<00:02:55.939> but<00:02:56.060> also<00:02:56.480> and<00:02:56.659> also<00:02:56.780> that<00:02:57.079> but<00:02:57.530> that

because I was terrible

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:42.280 
because I was terrible
it<00:03:38.659> was<00:03:38.840> because<00:03:39.079> I<00:03:39.739> was<00:03:40.449> it<00:03:41.449> was<00:03:41.629> very<00:03:41.659> complex

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
it was because I was it was very complex

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:43.749 
it was because I was it was very complex
technical<00:03:42.650> shot<00:03:42.889> and<00:03:43.099> it<00:03:43.189> was<00:03:43.220> using<00:03:43.699> the

00:03:43.749 --> 00:03:43.759 
technical shot and it was using the

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:45.939 
technical shot and it was using the
motion<00:03:44.030> control<00:03:44.389> camera<00:03:44.470> which<00:03:45.470> is<00:03:45.620> a<00:03:45.650> camera

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:45.949 
motion control camera which is a camera

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:47.379 
motion control camera which is a camera
operated<00:03:46.370> by<00:03:46.459> a<00:03:46.489> computer<00:03:46.790> rather<00:03:47.090> than<00:03:47.299> a

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:47.389 
operated by a computer rather than a

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:49.030 
operated by a computer rather than a
human<00:03:47.449> being<00:03:47.930> so<00:03:48.229> that<00:03:48.349> it<00:03:48.500> can<00:03:48.680> recreate

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
human being so that it can recreate

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.629 
human being so that it can recreate
exactly<00:03:49.310> the<00:03:49.939> same<00:03:50.180> move<00:03:50.750> every<00:03:51.109> time<00:03:51.489> upon<00:03:52.489> me

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:52.639 
exactly the same move every time upon me

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:59.140 
exactly the same move every time upon me
and<00:03:52.849> and<00:03:53.859> basically<00:03:54.859> the<00:03:56.439> the<00:03:57.439> I<00:03:57.889> would<00:03:58.849> stand

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
and and basically the the I would stand

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:00.849 
and and basically the the I would stand
in<00:03:59.299> one<00:03:59.479> place<00:03:59.540> and<00:03:59.989> the<00:04:00.199> camera<00:04:00.439> would<00:04:00.590> do<00:04:00.739> the

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:00.859 
in one place and the camera would do the

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:02.289 
in one place and the camera would do the
shots<00:04:01.099> and<00:04:01.310> then<00:04:01.459> I<00:04:01.549> stand<00:04:01.819> in<00:04:01.970> the<00:04:02.030> second

00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:02.299 
shots and then I stand in the second

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:03.460 
shots and then I stand in the second
position<00:04:02.389> of<00:04:02.629> the<00:04:02.689> camera<00:04:02.840> to<00:04:03.079> the<00:04:03.109> shot<00:04:03.319> but

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
position of the camera to the shot but

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.069 
position of the camera to the shot but
if<00:04:03.560> I<00:04:03.680> was<00:04:03.889> standing<00:04:04.609> an<00:04:04.699> inch<00:04:04.909> too<00:04:05.720> far<00:04:05.900> to<00:04:05.989> my

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:06.079 
if I was standing an inch too far to my

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:07.420 
if I was standing an inch too far to my
left<00:04:06.229> or<00:04:06.349> to<00:04:06.470> my<00:04:06.500> right<00:04:06.799> then<00:04:07.099> I<00:04:07.129> would<00:04:07.280> be

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
left or to my right then I would be

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.030 
left or to my right then I would be
standing<00:04:07.639> in<00:04:08.090> another<00:04:08.689> theoretical<00:04:09.199> me<00:04:09.709> that

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
standing in another theoretical me that

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.280 
standing in another theoretical me that
would<00:04:10.159> be<00:04:10.280> put<00:04:10.430> in<00:04:10.549> there<00:04:10.699> later<00:04:11.079> but<00:04:12.079> yeah<00:04:12.169> so

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
would be put in there later but yeah so

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.110 
would be put in there later but yeah so
it<00:04:12.379> took<00:04:12.470> a<00:04:12.560> long<00:04:12.709> long<00:04:13.280> long<00:04:13.430> time<00:04:13.489> but<00:04:13.909> it<00:04:14.000> was

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
it took a long long long time but it was

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.690 
it took a long long long time but it was
it's<00:04:14.479> um<00:04:14.889> it's<00:04:15.889> one<00:04:16.039> of<00:04:16.099> those<00:04:16.190> sequences<00:04:16.370> it's

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:16.700 
it's um it's one of those sequences it's
