right back there when i made the cast I
was<00:03:33.319> actually<00:03:33.470> wedged<00:03:33.919> against<00:03:34.340> a<00:03:34.370> tree<00:03:34.609> top<00:03:34.819> I

00:03:34.929 --> 00:03:34.939 
was actually wedged against a tree top I

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:36.460 
was actually wedged against a tree top I
was<00:03:35.150> intact<00:03:35.389> oh<00:03:35.569> here<00:03:35.780> he<00:03:35.870> goes<00:03:35.900> he's<00:03:36.260> loose

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
was intact oh here he goes he's loose

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.439 
was intact oh here he goes he's loose
that's<00:03:37.250> all<00:03:37.459> it<00:03:37.609> takes<00:03:37.729> a<00:03:37.909> lot<00:03:38.030> of<00:03:38.060> times<00:03:38.269> it's

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:38.449 
that's all it takes a lot of times it's

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:44.289 
that's all it takes a lot of times it's
just<00:03:38.599> to<00:03:38.659> change<00:03:38.840> the<00:03:39.049> angle<00:03:39.379> oh<00:03:43.060> he's<00:03:44.060> still

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:44.299 
just to change the angle oh he's still

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:46.809 
just to change the angle oh he's still
there<00:03:44.859> sometimes<00:03:45.859> you<00:03:45.979> can<00:03:46.099> just<00:03:46.129> go<00:03:46.340> slack<00:03:46.639> on

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:46.819 
there sometimes you can just go slack on

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:50.500 
there sometimes you can just go slack on
them<00:03:47.000> and<00:03:47.060> let<00:03:47.209> them<00:03:49.000> knock<00:03:50.000> it<00:03:50.120> off<00:03:50.209> the<00:03:50.329> limb

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
them and let them knock it off the limb

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.820 
them and let them knock it off the limb
oh<00:03:50.780> I<00:03:51.260> think<00:03:51.319> I<00:03:51.560> lost<00:03:51.709> him

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:54.830 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:58.540 

I<00:03:54.890> think<00:03:55.880> he<00:03:55.940> got<00:03:56.090> the<00:03:56.240> lit<00:03:56.420> the<00:03:57.310> lure<00:03:58.310> hooked

I think he got the lit the lure hooked

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:59.710 
I think he got the lit the lure hooked
into<00:03:58.700> the<00:03:58.850> tree<00:03:59.090> which<00:03:59.300> give<00:03:59.480> him<00:03:59.600> the

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
into the tree which give him the

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.580 
into the tree which give him the
leverage<00:03:59.990> to<00:04:00.110> pull<00:04:00.290> it<00:04:00.410> off<00:04:00.560> oh<00:04:02.320> no<00:04:03.320> he's<00:04:03.440> there

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590
