I'm talking about okay um to do that you
play<00:01:13.740> long<00:01:13.979> tones<00:01:14.310> and<00:01:14.610> long<00:01:14.909> tones<00:01:15.270> are<00:01:15.689> where

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
play long tones and long tones are where

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.350 
play long tones and long tones are where
you<00:01:16.200> just<00:01:16.350> hold<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:16.770> no<00:01:16.890> doubt<00:01:17.130> for<00:01:18.000> an

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
you just hold and no doubt for an

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.840 
you just hold and no doubt for an
extended<00:01:18.840> period<00:01:18.869> of<00:01:19.259> time<00:01:19.520> longer<00:01:20.520> than<00:01:20.549> you

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
extended period of time longer than you

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.109 
extended period of time longer than you
normally<00:01:20.970> would<00:01:21.210> all<00:01:21.869> right<00:01:22.080> I<00:01:22.110> guess<00:01:22.530> um<00:01:23.119> the

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
normally would all right I guess um the

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.200 
normally would all right I guess um the
time<00:01:24.390> that<00:01:24.750> you<00:01:24.780> hold<00:01:25.020> it<00:01:25.170> out<00:01:25.290> varies<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:26.610> I

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
time that you hold it out varies and I

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.130 
time that you hold it out varies and I
suggest<00:01:27.810> using<00:01:27.960> a<00:01:28.170> metronome<00:01:28.729> because<00:01:29.780> it<00:01:30.780> in

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
suggest using a metronome because it in

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.399 
suggest using a metronome because it in
all<00:01:31.829> your<00:01:32.220> practices<00:01:32.790> with<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.780> trumpet<00:01:34.200> use

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
all your practices with the trumpet use

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.280 
all your practices with the trumpet use
a<00:01:34.439> metronome<00:01:34.710> because<00:01:35.490> this<00:01:36.420> is<00:01:36.630> how<00:01:36.840> this<00:01:37.079> is

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
a metronome because this is how this is

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.710 
a metronome because this is how this is
you<00:01:37.710> not<00:01:37.950> using<00:01:38.250> a<00:01:38.430> metronome<00:01:38.610> right<00:01:39.030> here<00:01:39.240> and

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
you not using a metronome right here and

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.990 
you not using a metronome right here and
this<00:01:39.930> is<00:01:39.990> you<00:01:40.470> using<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.159> metronome<00:01:41.340> this<00:01:41.850> is

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
this is you using a metronome this is

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.149 
this is you using a metronome this is
your<00:01:42.150> skill<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:42.750> this<00:01:43.229> is<00:01:43.320> how<00:01:43.409> fast<00:01:43.680> it<00:01:44.040> will

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
your skill and this is how fast it will

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:51.230 
your skill and this is how fast it will
get<00:01:44.340> better<00:01:49.009> okay<00:01:50.009> that's<00:01:50.670> that's<00:01:50.970> what

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
get better okay that's that's what

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.240 
get better okay that's that's what
that's<00:01:51.630> what<00:01:51.750> it's<00:01:51.990> like<00:01:52.170> so<00:01:52.649> use<00:01:52.950> a<00:01:52.979> metronome

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
that's what it's like so use a metronome

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.410 
that's what it's like so use a metronome
oh<00:01:54.110> and<00:01:55.110> what<00:01:55.950> I<00:01:55.979> mean<00:01:56.159> by<00:01:56.430> that<00:01:56.670> is<00:01:56.909> you<00:01:57.149> can

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
oh and what I mean by that is you can

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.719 
oh and what I mean by that is you can
click<00:01:57.750> you<00:01:58.500> normally<00:01:58.740> like<00:01:58.860> to<00:01:58.920> use<00:01:59.280> a<00:01:59.310> slower

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
click you normally like to use a slower

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.389 
click you normally like to use a slower
tempo<00:02:00.350> if<00:02:01.350> you<00:02:01.409> don't<00:02:01.560> have<00:02:01.680> a<00:02:01.710> metronome<00:02:02.159> go

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
tempo if you don't have a metronome go

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.080 
tempo if you don't have a metronome go
to<00:02:02.810> metronome<00:02:03.810> online<00:02:04.399> it's<00:02:05.399> free<00:02:05.640> Metron

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
to metronome online it's free Metron

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.830 
to metronome online it's free Metron
that's<00:02:06.479> what<00:02:06.630> I'm<00:02:06.750> using

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
that's what I'm using

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.540 
that's what I'm using
like<00:02:09.530> 60<00:02:10.340> beats<00:02:10.580> man<00:02:11.950> you<00:02:12.950> just<00:02:13.129> pulled<00:02:13.400> out<00:02:13.519> a

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
like 60 beats man you just pulled out a

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:21.220 
like 60 beats man you just pulled out a
note

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.030 

ah<00:02:22.030> just<00:02:23.030> like<00:02:23.209> that<00:02:23.420> so<00:02:24.110> that<00:02:24.470> was<00:02:24.590> four<00:02:24.800> beats

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
ah just like that so that was four beats

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.039 
ah just like that so that was four beats
you<00:02:25.280> can<00:02:25.489> take<00:02:25.879> it<00:02:25.970> up<00:02:26.060> to<00:02:26.209> eight<00:02:26.360> beat<00:02:26.569> 16

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:27.049 
you can take it up to eight beat 16

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:31.089 
you can take it up to eight beat 16
beats<00:02:27.260> 32<00:02:27.950> beats<00:02:28.190> uh<00:02:28.750> you<00:02:29.750> know<00:02:29.900> it<00:02:30.049> varies<00:02:30.470> so
