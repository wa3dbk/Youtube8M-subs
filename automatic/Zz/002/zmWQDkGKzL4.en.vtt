to kill zombies in this little circle

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.929 
to kill zombies in this little circle
here<00:01:18.930> if<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.470> zombies<00:01:19.799> die<00:01:19.979> on<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.580> grate

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.219 
around the outside of the blood-soaked
circle<00:01:23.070> it<00:01:23.220> does<00:01:23.460> count<00:01:23.880> towards<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.689> number

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
circle it does count towards the number

blood of the zombies and once you have
killed<00:01:31.500> enough<00:01:31.710> zombies<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.280> skillet<00:01:32.670> will

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
killed enough zombies the skillet will

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
Bobby to get Bobby's battery you will

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.150 
Bobby to get Bobby's battery you will
have<00:03:12.240> to<00:03:12.390> hold<00:03:12.600> X<00:03:12.900> on<00:03:13.140> the<00:03:13.290> blueprints<00:03:13.890> of<00:03:14.010> him

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
have to hold X on the blueprints of him

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.460 
have to hold X on the blueprints of him
in<00:03:14.370> the<00:03:14.550> Atlas<00:03:14.880> command<00:03:15.180> center<00:03:15.540> run<00:03:16.020> along

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
in the Atlas command center run along

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:17.780 
in the Atlas command center run along
this<00:03:16.680> path<00:03:16.920> into<00:03:17.280> the<00:03:17.310> room<00:03:17.550> with<00:03:17.700> the

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
this path into the room with the

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.370 
this path into the room with the
generator<00:03:18.150> in<00:03:18.330> and<00:03:18.540> grab<00:03:18.840> the<00:03:18.870> battery<00:03:19.200> out<00:03:19.230> of

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
generator in and grab the battery out of

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:20.720 
generator in and grab the battery out of
the<00:03:19.440> wall<00:03:19.620> now<00:03:20.040> you<00:03:20.100> need<00:03:20.250> to<00:03:20.310> do<00:03:20.430> this<00:03:20.489> rather

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
the wall now you need to do this rather

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.250 
the wall now you need to do this rather
fast<00:03:21.030> because<00:03:21.239> it<00:03:21.390> does<00:03:21.540> close<00:03:21.750> quite<00:03:22.050> quickly

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
fast because it does close quite quickly

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.260 
fast because it does close quite quickly
then<00:03:22.980> we're<00:03:23.250> gonna<00:03:23.340> take<00:03:23.520> the<00:03:23.580> battery<00:03:24.030> to

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270 
then we're gonna take the battery to

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.140 
then we're gonna take the battery to
high<00:03:24.780> voltage<00:03:25.440> and<00:03:25.680> charge<00:03:26.190> it<00:03:26.489> you<00:03:27.000> can

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
high voltage and charge it you can

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.610 
high voltage and charge it you can
charge<00:03:27.360> it<00:03:27.540> by<00:03:27.660> holding<00:03:28.020> X<00:03:28.200> on<00:03:28.380> this<00:03:28.470> little

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
charge it by holding X on this little

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.670 
charge it by holding X on this little
outlet<00:03:29.040> here<00:03:29.370> and<00:03:29.580> then<00:03:30.120> run<00:03:30.360> around<00:03:30.510> and<00:03:31.050> keep

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
outlet here and then run around and keep

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.040 
outlet here and then run around and keep
the<00:03:31.800> zombies<00:03:31.830> busy<00:03:32.459> now<00:03:33.060> the<00:03:33.480> zombies<00:03:33.810> do

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
the zombies busy now the zombies do

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:35.660 
the zombies busy now the zombies do
attack<00:03:34.470> the<00:03:34.500> battery<00:03:34.920> so<00:03:35.070> it's<00:03:35.190> best<00:03:35.430> to<00:03:35.520> do

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
attack the battery so it's best to do

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.040 
attack the battery so it's best to do
this<00:03:35.820> with<00:03:36.000> just<00:03:36.270> one<00:03:36.450> left<00:03:36.660> and<00:03:36.780> just<00:03:36.900> run

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050 
this with just one left and just run

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.540 
this with just one left and just run
around<00:03:37.170> and<00:03:37.410> run<00:03:37.560> around<00:03:37.680> until<00:03:37.920> it<00:03:38.220> actually

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550 
around and run around until it actually

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.370 
around and run around until it actually
charges<00:03:39.000> you'll<00:03:39.360> see<00:03:39.600> here<00:03:39.840> that<00:03:39.870> the<00:03:39.989> zombie

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
charges you'll see here that the zombie

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:41.900 
charges you'll see here that the zombie
air<00:03:40.530> gets<00:03:40.770> caught<00:03:41.040> on<00:03:41.070> it<00:03:41.310> and<00:03:41.430> starts<00:03:41.670> hitting

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
air gets caught on it and starts hitting

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.000 
air gets caught on it and starts hitting
it<00:03:41.970> but<00:03:42.390> what<00:03:42.570> will<00:03:42.690> happen<00:03:43.019> is<00:03:43.140> the<00:03:43.440> battery

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
it but what will happen is the battery

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.770 
it but what will happen is the battery
will<00:03:44.160> fall<00:03:44.519> out<00:03:44.550> and<00:03:45.030> you<00:03:45.300> can<00:03:45.390> just<00:03:45.510> pick<00:03:45.630> it

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
will fall out and you can just pick it

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.870 
will fall out and you can just pick it
up<00:03:45.870> and<00:03:45.989> put<00:03:46.410> it<00:03:46.500> back<00:03:46.620> in<00:03:46.830> and<00:03:47.459> then<00:03:47.580> just<00:03:47.610> keep

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880
