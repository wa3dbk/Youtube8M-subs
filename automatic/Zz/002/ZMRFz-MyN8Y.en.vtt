00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
since I had liked them like any memory

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.279 
since I had liked them like any memory
of<00:00:11.670> my<00:00:11.850> life<00:00:12.030> when<00:00:12.510> I<00:00:12.570> was<00:00:12.750> a<00:00:12.780> little<00:00:12.959> kid<00:00:13.200> I

of my life when I was a little kid I

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:14.570 
of my life when I was a little kid I

complexity<00:00:32.070> of<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.189> stories<00:00:32.489> it<00:00:33.270> was<00:00:33.360> more

00:00:33.619 --> 00:00:33.629 
complexity of the stories it was more

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:36.649 
complexity of the stories it was more
just<00:00:34.160> combining<00:00:35.160> you<00:00:35.579> know<00:00:35.700> imaginative

something I really really liked so I've
been<00:00:43.109> drawing<00:00:43.379> pretty<00:00:43.710> much<00:00:43.829> all<00:00:43.980> my<00:00:44.100> life

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:48.720 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.810 

how<00:00:49.720> much<00:00:50.080> I<00:00:50.230> like<00:00:50.680> to<00:00:50.710> draw<00:00:51.070> just<00:00:51.400> shifted

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:51.820 
how much I like to draw just shifted

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.310 
how much I like to draw just shifted
like<00:00:52.300> or<00:00:52.480> what<00:00:52.720> I<00:00:52.750> draw<00:00:53.110> I<00:00:54.120> shifted<00:00:55.120> and<00:00:55.330> I<00:00:56.080> was

like or what I draw I shifted and I was

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.390 
like or what I draw I shifted and I was
pretty<00:00:56.559> much<00:00:56.680> just<00:00:56.739> doodling<00:00:57.700> all<00:00:58.090> the<00:00:58.360> time

00:00:59.390 --> 00:00:59.400 
pretty much just doodling all the time

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.610 
pretty much just doodling all the time
until<00:01:00.400> I<00:01:00.430> hit<00:01:00.970> my<00:01:01.960> sophomore<00:01:02.230> year<00:01:02.440> of<00:01:02.559> high

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:02.620 
until I hit my sophomore year of high

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.530 
until I hit my sophomore year of high
school<00:01:02.710> and<00:01:03.129> I'd<00:01:03.220> say<00:01:03.430> I<00:01:03.670> don't<00:01:04.330> know<00:01:04.390> my

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:04.540 
school and I'd say I don't know my

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.570 
school and I'd say I don't know my
freshman<00:01:04.750> year<00:01:05.020> of<00:01:05.050> high<00:01:05.110> school<00:01:05.170> and<00:01:05.770> that's

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:06.580 
freshman year of high school and that's

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.910 
freshman year of high school and that's
when<00:01:06.820> I<00:01:06.850> I<00:01:07.210> was<00:01:07.570> serious<00:01:07.960> about<00:01:08.020> it<00:01:08.229> for<00:01:08.860> the

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
when I I was serious about it for the

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.010 
when I I was serious about it for the
first<00:01:09.130> time<00:01:09.340> so<00:01:10.000> when<00:01:10.300> I<00:01:10.360> was<00:01:10.510> younger<00:01:10.750> it<00:01:10.930> was

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
first time so when I was younger it was

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.390 
first time so when I was younger it was
more<00:01:11.260> just<00:01:11.290> something<00:01:11.740> I<00:01:11.800> was<00:01:11.890> good<00:01:12.010> at<00:01:12.040> and

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:12.400 
more just something I was good at and

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.940 
more just something I was good at and
like<00:01:12.520> people<00:01:12.700> knew<00:01:12.910> I<00:01:12.940> was<00:01:13.060> good<00:01:13.270> at<00:01:13.420> it<00:01:13.570> I

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
like people knew I was good at it I

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.230 
like people knew I was good at it I
didn't<00:01:14.950> really<00:01:15.040> know<00:01:15.369> I<00:01:15.610> mean<00:01:15.820> I<00:01:15.850> just<00:01:15.970> thought

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
didn't really know I mean I just thought

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.960 
didn't really know I mean I just thought
like<00:01:16.770> it<00:01:17.770> came<00:01:17.979> so<00:01:18.160> naturally<00:01:18.310> to<00:01:18.610> me<00:01:18.700> I<00:01:18.760> didn't

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 
like it came so naturally to me I didn't

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:20.370 
like it came so naturally to me I didn't
even<00:01:19.090> think<00:01:19.270> of<00:01:19.360> it<00:01:19.509> as<00:01:19.600> a<00:01:19.780> passion<00:01:20.259> or<00:01:20.350> a

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
even think of it as a passion or a

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.180 
even think of it as a passion or a
possible<00:01:20.860> a<00:01:21.009> career<00:01:21.399> thing<00:01:22.680> but<00:01:23.680> once<00:01:24.070> I

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.190 
possible a career thing but once I

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:25.800 
possible a career thing but once I
realized<00:01:24.399> that<00:01:24.700> this<00:01:24.880> is<00:01:25.060> really<00:01:25.300> really<00:01:25.660> what

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
realized that this is really really what

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.770 
realized that this is really really what
I<00:01:25.840> love<00:01:26.050> to<00:01:26.229> do<00:01:27.180> that's<00:01:28.180> kind<00:01:28.450> of<00:01:28.600> when<00:01:28.750> I

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
I love to do that's kind of when I

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.889 
I love to do that's kind of when I
became<00:01:29.320> very<00:01:29.380> serious<00:01:29.800> for<00:01:30.160> me<00:01:30.190> and<00:01:30.899> something

00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:31.899 
became very serious for me and something

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:37.440 
became very serious for me and something
I<00:01:32.100> just<00:01:33.100> loved<00:01:35.369> so<00:01:36.369> my<00:01:36.640> freshman<00:01:36.850> is<00:01:37.090> sophomore

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
I just loved so my freshman is sophomore

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.080 
I just loved so my freshman is sophomore
year<00:01:37.750> I<00:01:38.190> had<00:01:39.190> a<00:01:39.250> really<00:01:39.490> serious<00:01:39.640> problem<00:01:39.789> with

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
year I had a really serious problem with

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.440 
year I had a really serious problem with
depression<00:01:41.520> there<00:01:42.520> was<00:01:42.640> a<00:01:42.670> point<00:01:42.940> where<00:01:43.090> I'd<00:01:43.180> I

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
depression there was a point where I'd I

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.230 
depression there was a point where I'd I
think<00:01:44.110> about<00:01:44.259> killing<00:01:44.470> myself<00:01:45.240> probably

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
think about killing myself probably

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.910 
think about killing myself probably
every<00:01:46.509> day<00:01:46.630> for<00:01:46.960> about<00:01:47.050> 7<00:01:47.680> months

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
every day for about 7 months

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.420 
every day for about 7 months
and<00:01:49.250> I<00:01:49.400> got<00:01:49.580> really<00:01:49.880> really<00:01:50.060> bad<00:01:51.130> and<00:01:52.130> I<00:01:52.400> think

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 
and I got really really bad and I think

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.730 
and I got really really bad and I think
I<00:01:52.729> just

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
I just

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.140 
I just
I<00:01:54.829> don't<00:01:55.549> know

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:57.150 
I don't know

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.530 
I don't know
I<00:01:57.240> kind<00:01:57.960> of<00:01:58.020> learned<00:01:58.290> to<00:01:59.270> cope<00:02:00.270> with<00:02:00.420> it

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
I kind of learned to cope with it

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.150 
I kind of learned to cope with it
through<00:02:00.780> art<00:02:00.930> that<00:02:01.200> was<00:02:01.290> my<00:02:01.470> only<00:02:01.620> coping

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:02.160 
through art that was my only coping

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:07.250 
through art that was my only coping
mechanism<00:02:03.860> and<00:02:05.240> I<00:02:06.240> guess<00:02:06.420> it<00:02:06.570> really<00:02:06.810> just<00:02:06.990> it

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:07.260 
mechanism and I guess it really just it

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.330 
mechanism and I guess it really just it
pulled<00:02:07.620> me<00:02:07.680> through<00:02:07.800> something<00:02:08.190> that<00:02:08.220> was

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
pulled me through something that was

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.280 
pulled me through something that was
really<00:02:08.430> serious<00:02:08.940> and<00:02:09.149> that<00:02:09.869> could<00:02:10.020> have<00:02:10.110> ended

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:10.290 
really serious and that could have ended

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:17.990 
really serious and that could have ended
my<00:02:10.440> life<00:02:10.560> pretty<00:02:10.800> easily<00:02:11.990> so<00:02:14.360> like<00:02:16.790> saying<00:02:17.790> art

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
my life pretty easily so like saying art

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.040 
my life pretty easily so like saying art
is<00:02:18.090> important<00:02:18.450> to<00:02:18.510> me<00:02:18.630> I<00:02:18.660> think<00:02:18.780> is<00:02:18.960> an

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
is important to me I think is an

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.670 
is important to me I think is an
understatement

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
understatement

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.100 
understatement
because<00:02:20.040> in<00:02:20.850> my<00:02:21.150> mind<00:02:21.180> it's<00:02:21.630> what<00:02:21.750> gives<00:02:21.900> my

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
because in my mind it's what gives my

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.720 
because in my mind it's what gives my
life<00:02:22.140> value<00:02:23.510> without<00:02:24.510> art<00:02:24.720> I'd<00:02:24.960> have<00:02:25.170> I<00:02:25.730> guess

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
life value without art I'd have I guess

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.340 
life value without art I'd have I guess
in<00:02:26.880> my<00:02:26.910> opinion<00:02:27.450> not<00:02:27.600> really<00:02:27.840> a<00:02:27.870> reason<00:02:28.110> to

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
in my opinion not really a reason to

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.430 
in my opinion not really a reason to
live<00:02:29.360> which<00:02:30.360> sounds<00:02:30.780> pretty<00:02:30.930> extreme<00:02:31.380> I<00:02:31.800> guess

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
live which sounds pretty extreme I guess

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.270 
live which sounds pretty extreme I guess
but<00:02:35.570> but<00:02:36.570> yeah<00:02:36.690> I<00:02:36.720> think<00:02:36.900> of<00:02:37.140> it<00:02:37.260> as<00:02:37.350> as<00:02:37.590> the

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
but but yeah I think of it as as the

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.040 
but but yeah I think of it as as the
reason<00:02:38.580> I'm<00:02:38.670> alive<00:02:38.790> to<00:02:39.480> create<00:02:39.780> beautiful
