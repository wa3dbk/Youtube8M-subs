00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:23.689

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:27.250

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:31.590
 use salt oil 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:37.420

 so last I present my water here 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.350
 is the water then the first thing that 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.620
 we are going to do is add so much water to the 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.620
 blender 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.980
 very little water to grind our 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.980
 eyes 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.219

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:05.360
 cumin 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:07.400
 very little way and a little oregano if 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.290
 they do not have grain do not worry now yes 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:13.870
 what can you get out of what you 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:16.270
 have some odor either this 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:18.390

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:22.130
 how much 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.130
 then all this we are going to grind 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:32.930
 and if it is already hot we go to the pot 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.620
 it's already hot, we're going to 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.620
 add everything 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.020
 Y 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.020
 as you can see then our 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.950
 tomatoes are cooked the chili 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:56.570
 guajillo also you are already 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.570
 this noise so that in this hard 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.990
 we also grind 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:04.590
 and 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:22.879
 and add the tomato and the ground 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.290
 one 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:39.710
 then all that I am going to reason 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.930
 for about 10 minutes 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:44.350
 and then already he added the 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.730
 plantita and let say that the little plant 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:48.950
 we go and we cover ourselves so that it goes to put 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.110
 a little bit if we light it and the 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.770
 game so that it will be slowly 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.770
 boiling 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:11.910
 we let it season for about 10 or 15 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:14.120
 minutes with the tomato and we add the 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.120
 Salt 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:24.470
 message and the epazote we left about 10 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.940
 or 15 minutes and then we already have it in 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.940
 the water that we want 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:35.239
 to put the water in about 15 minutes 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:37.430
 and we already let it boil to start 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:40.080
 boil with the water that we have left 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:42.560
 be for about 40 minutes 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.330
 let's go and peace 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.630
 to 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:49.850
 Look, it's already well seasoned 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:51.670
 tummy together with the tomato with all 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:56.000
 the condiments ingredients 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:58.880
 come on and we add the water is the 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.350
 water that you want to add to 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.450
 so among other little things 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:04.100
 we add so that richer is left 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.750
 because if they pour a lot of water too 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:09.050
 is now yes that very this one would know 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:10.850

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.570
 minutes as it is pre-cooked and quick 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.460
 because the raw is like this is harder and 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:27.650
 come on and then the list will be ready 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.780
