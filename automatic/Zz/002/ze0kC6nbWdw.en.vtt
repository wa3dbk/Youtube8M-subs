00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 when people used to be from the end of the world 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:07.109
 languages ​​locked the rsi or 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:10.080
 did they also sometimes both but 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.960
 We would never take them seriously 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.240
 better yet I will come later 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.180
 I better start at the beginning of the 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.010
 abduction of desmond miles my son 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.430
 This guy had no ambition 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.830
 no goals no plans for the future 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.180
 what he had was a legacy of one 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:32.189
 he refused 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:34.230
 that cost him almost the life he became 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.149
 caught his and tense his 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.400
 Kidnappers wanted him to do something for them 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.530
 find the apple 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:44.020
 one of several species we 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.910
 just splinter all parts antique 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.850
 Technology scattered around the globe 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:51.910
 are some hidden some found 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:54.190
 all are dangerous most of the time 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:57.130
 owned by a group of the same group 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.780
 who now of the world had you know her 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:01.510
 as abstergo industries 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.760
 we know them from the templars as the 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.980
 archenemy we fight it since 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.570
 thousands of years even longer 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:11.619
 if you look at the story of its origin 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.610
 i believe i do that i have the 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:15.580
 seen truth 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:18.700
 that's the nice and scare the 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.619
 animus this device allows us to 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.840
 to see the lives of our ancestors and 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:24.880
 After all, power has it all 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.950
 to change the past for us 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.990
 show how she really was up to 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.750
 his invention was written by only the 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:34.540
 winner of the story 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.440
 we fight against bodies and souls 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.810
 to free 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.420
 but our means are limited and the 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.850
 Templars currently have the upper hand 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.820
 but now approaching something bigger than 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.180
 dancers that together they are bigger than 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.650
 everything else 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.660
 if we can not stop it 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:54.650
 the next became ours 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:57.920
 Last will be for all of us at the end 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:02:00.380
 everything depends on him 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.590
 the animus he discovered his legacy 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.790
 discovered the lives and secrets 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.550
 his ancestors 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.560
 meanwhile, he was training one 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.450
 other ancestral recipients decades 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:15.830
 experience in just a few days 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:17.370
 it worked, hope and hope soon 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.590
 we know 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.989
 the ominous day is rapidly approaching the 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.510
 21 december 2012 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:26.819
 nobody knows what he will bring 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.630
 that we should be here if it insofar 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:31.030
 is 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:34.630
 they guided us to their very own 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:37.330
 own frustrating vote aside 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.460
 first civilization of those before us 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.040
 came 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.780
 former race with enormous power and 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.770
 inexplicable motives 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:48.510
 they are the producers of the ebel splitter 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:51.240
 They brought him here and with him 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.940
 They and he is at the entrance of this 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:56.820
 ancient places armed with the knowledge 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:59.190
 age and skills etios in 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:03.060
 he holds the apple and us in his hand 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:04.740
 our side are always ready for it 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:08.130
 is going to help 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:11.540
 his name is desmond miles and he 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.540
 led us to the end
