 here sudden brutal whitening of 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.540
 hair due to an event 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.860
 particularly shocking this loss of 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.719
 pigmentation is also called syndrome 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.950
 of Marie Antoinette in reference to the 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.579
 legend that the hair of

 night before his execution brian 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.719
 would have suffered a trauma 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.670
 emotional loss of a loved one 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.870
 maybe the red banner he wears 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.610
 around the arm we may be a 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.170

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.760
 brian to bring him back to life 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.770
 but abel did not do it out of compassion 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.540
 brian was to become his toy that 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.310
 do the dirty work he wrote to the 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.299
 third tournament tekken so he 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.280
 get in touch with the doctor 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.840
 bosconovitch his rival in the field 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.729
 of science abel needs to know 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.920
 a little bit about his technology always 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.060
 a notch ahead of him in tekken 3 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.990
 many characters we leave the 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.460

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.010
 bruce irvine although there is no

 script link between these two 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.530
 people inevitably on contact 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.530
 similarities

 than ring competitions that 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:48.000
 allowed the champions of various 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.160
 martial arts to confront each other 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.500
 success was at the rendezvous with the 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.160
 time it's codified 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.080
 institutionalized to become a sport 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.790
 full-fledged fight Brian Masters 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.410
 indeed the basics of this sport by 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.120
 example this nuckle tray is indeed a 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:02.610
 powerful shot regularly used in 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.500
 the kick boxing that executed so well 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.360
 considerable damage to this brilliant 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.460
 and offering by realizing it twice the 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.970
 followed by his attack the macd is 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:13.350
 that the famous backbreaker brienne to 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.820
 many signature attacks that has 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.260
 swept in fact rage more than one 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.760
 she is a very good way to start 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.380
 to mail linking however is 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.870
 risky because if the opponent defends itself 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.550
 that makes brian very vulnerable one 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.230
 also retains its charm in slam which 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.780
 allows to punish quickly if the enemy 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.660
 made a mistake but the winner masne 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.640
 it's her most beautiful baby 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.950
 fast and powerful technique inspired by the 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:39.720
 karate it is usually concluded the 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:42.209
 congo brian can also achieve the 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.560
 mcb rigor right after a counter if the 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:47.550
 counterattack is successful 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.140
 Arian make his taunt a priori 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.150
 his provocative poses seem useless 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.190
 but in fact it's a technique to 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.380
 multiple passes be observed the mcg 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:59.340
 normal walker and the just breaker mcs 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:01.739
 after a barrel the power of the blow and 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.239
 multiply the talk can also raise 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.130
 the opponent in a combo story of 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:06.540
 can continue to chain a farm 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.010
 and when done in rehearsal 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.380
 to cover a distance so 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.720
 unusually fast and finally the 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.070
 downtown special properties the shot of 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.840
 knee that but brian the scene no 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.730
 damage but it is unstoppable 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.680
 even if the enemy is protecting himself 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.120
 lagoon will be broken and brian in the 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.980
 stride can hit again by being 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.019
 a 100% sure that the cost achieved by the 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.819
 target of enemy players is a fervent 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:27.989
 user of the taunt and by the same 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:28.440
 opportunity one of the best players 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:31.830
 world 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:36.049
 look at it, it's waiting for it 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:36.049
 auspicious moment and that's the drama 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:43.420
 despite all his qualities brian fails 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.110
 during his mission in tekken 3 he 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.390
 find alone 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:47.560
 his creator at bell did not give up and 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:49.600
 was hired by the mishima 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.010
 zaibatsu after two years bryan se 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.180
 meet his time is counted he 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.370
 is running out of energy 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.200
 his goal to find at bell so that they 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.880
 minimize a perfect body without limit 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.290
 of duration the fourth tournament tekken 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.910
 will be an opportunity to achieve this 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.620
 this is the facet of the story of 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.300
 bryan which allows us to discover where 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.430
 is derived from his physical appearance 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.230
 there is another robot that was looking for his 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.910
 creator to extend its life 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.460
 and it's in blade runner that you 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.340
 will see with roubaty just 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:16.630
 compare to see the similarities 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:18.520
 as for the rails finds its manufacturer 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.890
 this one explains to him can not do anything 

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:22.420
 for him but I'm afraid it's 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:27.850
 outside of my jurisdiction 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:29.590
 that's how brian reacts opts him 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.900
 for a mandal and the moment after he 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:34.090
 will collapse from exhaustion as roj 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:36.850
 but where the history of reuil building 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:38.320
 stops that of brian continues on 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:40.000
 shimmy on in his benevolence the 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.190
 collection so that dr b's offer a 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.350
 new generator went brian will make 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:46.270
 a last tribute to roye usually his 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.920
 trick it's snakes he's got pants 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:51.310
 a snake these attacks is called 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:53.860
 anaconda by blow hook cobra fang 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:55.480
 close python but here he makes a 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:58.150
 exception he will call his kick 

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:59.920
 wall style there that wolf certainly 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.720
 will you understand the dedication when 

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:04.470
 you will see built cameron lesson when 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.470
 they track down their prey 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.940
 after a good rest period brian 

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:10.500
 finally wakes up brand new stronger 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:15.240

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:17.310
 would be indebted to doctor b brian 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:19.319

 b the yoshimitsu plan including me 

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:22.409
 classy dishes burst his rage and this is going 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.090
 crescendo 

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:26.009
 there is an excellent barometer for 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:27.120
 measure its intensity you have to count the 

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:28.919
 number of blows he puts to his 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:35.039
 opponent when he defeated antec n 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:38.240

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:38.240
 in tekken 6 that it gives 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:49.890
 note that you will never see this 

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:52.530

 the charter of non-maltreatment 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:58.290
 animals he will have to be content with 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:59.010
 to laugh stupidly his laughter we hear him 

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:01.230
 often by the way 

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:02.880
 you certainly imagine a doubler 

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:07.460
 impressive to endorse such 

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:07.460

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:23.860
 there rather bad since the carnage 

00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:25.509
 committed on his friends this is the beginning 

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:27.520
 of an endless rivalry between these two 

00:06:25.509 --> 00:06:28.990
 protagonists who will occupy the tournament and 

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.830
 will prevent marianne from revealing her all 

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:31.930
 power 

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:33.370
 to make up for that frustration he's getting 

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:34.090
 will participate in armed conflicts to 

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:36.190
 worldwide 

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:37.720
 the ogre is his thing it's not for 

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:38.800
 nothing but fury and no of any one

 Ryan is definitely a fan of this 

00:06:55.189 --> 00:06:59.449
 kind of sounds evidenced by the name of 

00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:02.080
