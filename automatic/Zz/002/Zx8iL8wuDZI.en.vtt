 position leader 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.710
 receiver to save is already at 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.600
 sale reside evil operation raccoon

 city a new delivery of the popular 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:21.330
 Capcom survival horror for 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:23.340
 consoles xbox 360 and playstation 3 that in 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.289
 This time delves fully into the 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.560
 genre of multiplayer shooters 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.560
 on-line 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.070
 Welcome 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.440
 for this the game proposes us this time 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.180
 spend next to the villains put 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.250
 that we will be part of a team of 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.350
 special forces of the corporation 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.290
 umbrella who are responsible for the work 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.420
 dirty of the company standing all the 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.570
 action in the city from mouse to the 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.580
 year 1998 just during the 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.470
 events that took place between 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.470
 Reside evil 2 and resident evil 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.180
 and 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.489
 Regarding the game modalities , 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.470
 circle offers us in the first place a 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.659
 history mode that invites us to overcome 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.229
 a series of missions choosing between 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.909
 a total of 6 characters available 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:16.409
 in the case of a modality 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:19.200
 especially thought to be played from 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.810
 Online cooperative form for up to 4 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.119
 players although if we opted to play in 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.340
 solitary that will allow us to select 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.530
 to three colleagues led by the cpu 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.780
 if you come in at least 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.700
 advisable since the intelligence 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.360
 artificial of the controlled characters 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.770
 by the console leaves a lot to be desired 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:41.780
 resulting in some more situations 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.780
 a burden that a real help 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.130
 Regarding the gameplay we are facing 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.290
 a third-person action shooter 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.090
 full-fledged so during the 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.190
 course of the game our 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.869
 fidelity will be to advance through the 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.290
 scenarios ending up with any 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.009
 enemy that hinders us the passage 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.560
 meeting with the creatures 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:10.410
 unknown saga among which 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.959
 Of course there will not be a lack of zombies 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.610
 like others much more frightening than what 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.400
 we must add that the government of the 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.890
 America has also deployed its own 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.380
 special forces teams which 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:25.430
 they will not pose a threat either. 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.430
 government forces 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.880
 and it is already 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:38.010
 In this sense we must emphasize that the 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.050
 game gives great importance to the use of 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.210
 the coverages since the bar 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.670
 life of our character does not regenerate 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:46.590
 alone and being too long 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.810
 exposed to enemy fire is something that 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.880
 We will pay dearly, but always 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.100
 we have the option to recover health 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.950
 using the herbs and colored sprays 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:58.050
 so characteristic of the saga so 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.760
 how to heal a dejected comrade 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.730
 if we approach his position 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.980
 being a very striking element the 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.230
 fact that if an allied character is 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.450
 bitten by a zombie this can fall 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.850
 infected becoming one of them 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:15.290
 so you have to kill him before 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.290
 to be able to relive it 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.370
 also another detail to take into account 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.709
 is that the ammunition of weapons is usually 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.150
 be pretty scarce so it turns out 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:35.280
 essential to take advantage of 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.950
 continuously from the weapons that leave 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.629
 drop the defeated enemies as well as 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.579
 the ammunition boxes that we can 

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:43.890
 find in the scenarios 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:45.900
 although if the situation requires it 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.299
 we can also use a knife in 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.370
 melee attacks being also 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:52.530
 possible to earn experience points for 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.810
 level up at the same time we're going 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:58.069
 unlocking new weapons and utensils 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.069
 with which to equip the 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:11.920
 For its part, the second modality of 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.870
 game is the mode versus being in it 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.880
 where we will find the modes 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.010
 competitive multiplayer online 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:20.350
 dividing these into five modalities 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:23.350
 that support for games of a 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:25.540
 maximum of 8 users presenting each 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:27.940
 a its own characteristic rules 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.830
 in this way in attack mode by 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:32.230
 equipment the umbrella forces are 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:36.000
 face face to face commands 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:36.000
 government special forces 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:42.969
 there they come to create everything 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:45.069
 as for the biological danger mode and 

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:47.620
 mechanics is very similar to that of a 

00:04:45.069 --> 00:04:49.509
 classic capture the flag being in 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:53.490
 this case the goal to bring up 

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:53.490
 our base a sample of the virus g 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:00.160
 while in regards to the mode 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:02.260
 survival both teams will have to 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.870
 escape from the city before this 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:07.180
 be destroyed although there is only one 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:09.220
 helicopter that can evacuate them so 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:12.510
 that the team that reaches him will be 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:12.510
 whoever wins 

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:18.790
 and the environmental reason finally in the 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:20.770
 heroes mode is the only mode of 

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:22.150
 game in which we can embody 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:24.340
 directly to several of the 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:26.530
 most known protagonists of the saga 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:28.360
 resident evil encountering us with 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:31.780
 characters like leon kennedy 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:35.280
 claire redfield nikolÃ¡y ada wong and jill 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:35.280
 valentine among others 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:42.220
 to conclude this analysis in relation 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:44.470
 To the technical section we can say that we 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:46.270
 we find before a title that despite 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:49.150
 of not living up to the best 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:51.520
 we've seen on xbox 360 and playstation3 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:53.590
 if it presents a pretty visual level 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:56.260
 correct doing a good 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:58.450
 atmosphere in which many are recreated 

00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:00.400
 of the most representative scenarios of 

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:02.980
 raccoon city being also very 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:04.720
 noteworthy its sounded section since it 

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:07.750
 has thrown with all the voices bent 

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:11.169
 to Spanish something very unusual in the 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:13.090
 games that hold we are going well that has 

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:15.669
 injected the virus that you can not do 

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:19.990
 nothing get out of there reporting everything to the 

00:06:15.669 --> 00:06:22.930
 address and you twisted sir I'm going 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:25.000
 to recover in conclusion operation 

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:27.310
 raccoon city is a game that results 

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.560
 quite fun if you play so 

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:31.870
 both cooperative and competitive 

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:34.570
 in the case of a title that takes a step 

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:36.700
 more in the resident evil saga focusing 

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:39.340
 in more than ever in its online aspect 

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:41.620
 however its greatest virtue is also 

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:44.030
 its biggest flaw since because of its 

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:47.090
 lack of plot depth 

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:49.370
 purely multiplayer lacks the 

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:52.060
 more minimum interest in face to be played 

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:52.060
 In solitary 

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:58.460
 finally before we say goodbye 

00:06:56.420 --> 00:07:01.610
 remember that next to the versions of 

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:03.920
 xbox 360 and playstation3 now available 

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:08.680
 The game also will be released for 

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:08.680
 pc from next May 18 

00:07:10.169 --> 00:07:13.169
 good
