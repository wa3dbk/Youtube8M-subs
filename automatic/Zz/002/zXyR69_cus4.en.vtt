00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
think Everton could do I sorry but I'm

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.300 
think Everton could do I sorry but I'm
hoping<00:02:58.299> it's<00:02:58.540> not<00:02:58.599> the<00:02:58.870> case<00:02:59.049> but<00:02:59.500> there<00:03:00.250> are

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
hoping it's not the case but there are

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.189 
hoping it's not the case but there are
so<00:03:00.430> many<00:03:00.489> question<00:03:01.000> marks<00:03:01.030> over<00:03:01.329> a<00:03:01.569> the<00:03:01.989> minute
