 Before placing a tall tree in the garden it is advisable to measure the available space 

00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:29.999
 remembering that over the years the plant will widen a lot, and therefore it will need a space that has a diameter of at least 3-4 meters 

00:00:29.418 --> 00:00:40.418
 it is advisable then to measure carefully, in order to position our tree at least three meters from the borders of our property, since this is the distance required by law 

00:00:41.301 --> 00:00:48.301
 Found the right place we practice a large hole, which can easily contain the radical bread of our tree 

00:01:02.596 --> 00:01:08.596
 We work with the hoe and spade the bottom of the hole, so that the soil is soft, not too compact 

00:01:14.397 --> 00:01:24.397
 Then mix the resulting soil of the excavation with organic fertilizer and universal soil, so as to use a good soil to cover the roots of the plant 

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:33.679
 We position our tree, remembering that it will be buried at the same depth as it was in the vase or in the nursery from which it was removed. 

00:01:33.174 --> 00:01:42.170
 If it is necessary we add more earth to the hole, or leviamone, until the base of the stem is at the level of the surrounding soil 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:49.100
 So we position our plant and cover the roots with the soil of which is enriched and well worked 

00:01:49.683 --> 00:02:01.680
 If the soil of our garden is of poor quality we can cover all the roots with universal soil, so as to favor the development of the root system of the new tree 

00:03:06.268 --> 00:03:15.270
 To prevent the newly planted plant from falling due to the wind, it is advisable to build a support structure around the stem for the first few years of life. 

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:22.230
 it is sufficient to fix 3 thin poles, to be positioned obliquely with respect to the plant's growth direction 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:30.440
 so that he has time to take root in the ground well before being subjected to thrusts due to bad weather
