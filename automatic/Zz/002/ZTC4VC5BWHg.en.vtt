00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.269
 with one more video 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:25.210
 this video here should have some 

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:29.199
 test hours in excel to power 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:32.619
 It does and how is already acting on a 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:35.230
 comparative and mainly to its 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.700
 music disc review a brief 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.469
 comment but mainly on the 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:42.460
 of the game sound 

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:45.460
 to respect always took the same 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:49.149
 gameplay over made under different 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:52.989
 conditions so the configurations of the two 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:55.600
 eyes in the same gameplay to stay for me 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:58.420
 to really have the adifea to know 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:01.359
 the difference between the sound of a 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.670
 and the sound of another one's got to be one thing 

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:05.710
 fair enough 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.970
 so I'll start with the first spoon 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:11.980
 cyrus samples 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:15.250
 it is a real 5.1 headset is it is a 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:19.120
 excellent headset and it has two options 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:22.960
 he already has a program and he comes here 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:24.910
 on it that only connect you to the 2nd USB 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.090
 already has it already set up and 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:28.880
 right 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:32.359
 black prates power to play quietly 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:34.399
 I always played like this is great so 

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:37.069
 listen very far too accurately 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:40.759
 sounds of the game he is very tough 

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:44.209
 so 177 very good 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:48.649
 ok this is the cooler master ciro 5 point and 

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:51.950
 the other is the average racer that is 7.1 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:54.200
 real is the only and for the moment 7.1 real 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.020
 The first difference I'll comment 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.720
 here is that razr it needs a 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.489
 sound card will occur more aggressive 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.549
 in which the two options connect via usb 

00:02:01.489 --> 00:02:06.739
 or connect through the sound card 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:10.130
 choose in two separate parts 

00:02:06.739 --> 00:02:13.790
 the day on average it has to connect 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:17.329
 through the sound card at 7.10 spent 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:19.489
 anyone else that gives this is the main 

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:22.459
 difference so a tea will be the 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:24.739
 remedy is already more expensive headset will be 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.450
 much more expensive because you have to spend 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:28.340
 more with the sound card 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.200
 already in terms of the game I'm going to say 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.530
 after all the tests that I did 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:37.549
 is always in the same game place and he 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:42.170
 has not felt no advantage're the 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:43.730
 razr focus neither sound card nothing i saw 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.780
 no advantage over the goalkeeper 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:50.090
 connecting him and as much as they were 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:53.389
 third parties also to Play 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.859
 direct connection to the sound card or the 

00:02:53.389 --> 00:02:58.459
 sound card that I am connected to is a 

00:02:54.859 --> 00:03:03.709
 blue will become ibas have a seat in 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:06.769
 canton a board aok so it does not have 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:09.440
 difference between connecting to the sound card 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:11.959
 or the program that already has the 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:15.109
 cooler master already starts there 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:17.180
 and for the two headphones I did not feel 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:18.889
 no difference in sound quality 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.799
 either to listen to the steps 

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:24.799
 intensity is the same as the depth 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:26.660
 the distance will listen is also the 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:29.359
 difference that has a bluetooth headset 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:33.500
 master cooler cruiser had medical 

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:35.629
 is that the clarity of the laser sound is 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:38.690
 a little greater the more it is no 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:41.090
 advantage in the game 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:43.310
 we can hear the same thing 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.900
 with the same distance with the same 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.570
 accuracy and has a bit more clarity 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:51.110
 the sound of the cooler master if slightly more 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:53.720
 so plated it is but in practice this 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:55.760
 does not make any difference 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.880
 this is the truth said test numbers 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:03.050
 To leave until I know it 's much better. 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:07.940
 and I listen in running 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:12.140
 This is the truth then and so it has until 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:17.170
 the option in sound aflac has option this 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:20.269
 put a viewer of the usual 

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:22.250
 only so he listens to everything dark with 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:24.680
 more accurately the steps only at the same 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.930
 time listening to things walk the 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.240
 other sounds is much higher then 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:31.400
 so while being hit by a shot 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.920
 is there recovering and regenerating 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.470
 then it all disturbs listening to the sea 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:39.340
 there very close that upset everything 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:42.170
 all the sounds of fla failed very grateful 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:45.080
 identify a few steps from where 

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:46.580
 everything is coming, so the 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.169
 noise of explosions that something 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:51.650
 What a mess 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:53.780
 who listens to the game then so early 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:59.419
 codes that I think are right 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:05:01.100
 bmw style and if it is so do not have 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:04.010
 no difference then so does the very 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:09.590
 the razr has average it opens the fair I 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:14.780
 Just let us know the phone even for 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:17.600
 stay but more alike more perfection 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:19.630
 so to identify the sounds 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:23.480
 about the game 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:25.550
 so that the difference of 

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:28.460
 other the other rapper has average then 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:30.860
 there is the sender different from the 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:33.290
 colleague but having been he has another 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:35.330
 output that would be the side output 

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:37.130
 here in practice there was nothing new 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:39.740
 I did not see any difference in one 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:41.540
 side but third party does not have the 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:44.210
 College master advantage here Cyrus 

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:47.270
 that the spikes there inside the phone they 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:49.930
 are very well separated are quite 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:52.360
 away from each other and others 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:54.639
 the right underneath a pretty area 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:56.770
 big the management are well separated I 

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:58.180
 I think there is the advantage so you 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:00.820
 can identify many come from where 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:03.880
 it's coming som jet reigns him and him 

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:07.229
 it is never a small thing 

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:09.910
 the area where his children are the phone 

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:12.430
 It's a bit smaller and it gets more 

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:16.030
 agglomerated because it has more but 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:17.770
 it is more crowded then maybe it is 

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:20.650
 a bit little harder thing 

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:23.470
 It's like that in the game so we 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:25.210
 tests that I did basically done 

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:28.150
 so if the guy is thinking about buying 

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:30.160
 Clay buy this here guy advises 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:32.590
 buy power more have no lashes 

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:34.360
 terms of play will be the same thing goes 

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:37.090
 have the same exact same 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:40.090
 thing will not have any advantage lay 

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:42.970
 a sound card with a headset has no 

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:45.310
 no advantage is so advises 

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:47.320
 buy the cyrus cooler master already talking 

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:49.599
 music in the music no longer has 

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:51.220
 a little difference 

00:06:49.599 --> 00:06:52.960
 the fact that I had said that 

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:54.789
 dream more high school master 

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:56.830
 cyrus then if this is going to be 

00:06:54.789 --> 00:06:59.199
 difference the sound is much more crystalline 

00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:02.289
 to listen to music and really 

00:06:59.199 --> 00:07:04.690
 something spectacular since then 

00:07:02.289 --> 00:07:06.190
 summarizing to play 

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:07.750
 the most accurate number now if you want 

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:10.530
 do other things that will do 

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:14.050
 quality difference will nu razr 

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:16.500
 That's it , then a hug said the 

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:16.500
 folks
