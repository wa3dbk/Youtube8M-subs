well<00:00:49.170> of<00:00:49.320> course<00:00:49.380> the<00:00:49.620> biggest<00:00:49.860> advantage

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
well of course the biggest advantage

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.450 
well of course the biggest advantage
with<00:00:50.880> the<00:00:51.210> winter<00:00:51.570> fat<00:00:52.140> bike<00:00:52.410> is<00:00:52.710> that<00:00:53.070> you<00:00:53.220> can

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
with the winter fat bike is that you can

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.569 
with the winter fat bike is that you can
ride<00:00:53.700> on<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.540> trails<00:00:54.810> on<00:00:55.200> the<00:00:55.260> snow<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:56.100> in

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
ride on the trails on the snow and in

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.580 
ride on the trails on the snow and in
the<00:00:56.670> wintertime<00:00:56.910> a<00:00:57.090> lot<00:00:57.390> of<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.899> terrain<00:00:58.260> is

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
the wintertime a lot of the terrain is

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.250 
the wintertime a lot of the terrain is
frozen<00:00:58.950> over<00:00:59.250> so<00:00:59.670> there's<00:00:59.910> a<00:01:00.030> lot<00:01:00.180> more<00:01:00.260> trails

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
frozen over so there's a lot more trails

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.270 
frozen over so there's a lot more trails
available<00:01:01.860> to<00:01:02.040> us<00:01:03.170> I've<00:01:04.170> learned<00:01:04.409> that<00:01:04.739> the

fat tire bikes are way better than

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.580 
fat tire bikes are way better than
writing<00:01:07.740> a<00:01:07.890> regular<00:01:08.280> mountain<00:01:08.549> bike<00:01:09.590> well

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590
