00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
hi this is Andy with epic automotive

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:07.909 
hi this is Andy with epic automotive
today<00:00:06.870> we<00:00:07.049> are<00:00:07.140> putting<00:00:07.350> an<00:00:07.500> instrument

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
today we are putting an instrument

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.940 
today we are putting an instrument
cluster<00:00:08.280> in<00:00:08.460> a<00:00:08.550> 2005<00:00:09.360> Pontiac<00:00:10.170> Sunfire

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
cluster in a 2005 Pontiac Sunfire

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.440 
cluster in a 2005 Pontiac Sunfire
so<00:00:11.160> let's<00:00:11.340> get<00:00:11.460> started<00:00:13.820> so<00:00:14.820> first<00:00:14.849> of<00:00:15.210> all<00:00:15.299> we

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
so let's get started so first of all we

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.120 
so let's get started so first of all we
see<00:00:15.630> the<00:00:15.809> reason<00:00:16.080> this<00:00:16.170> gauge<00:00:16.410> needs<00:00:16.710> replaced

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
see the reason this gauge needs replaced

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.880 
see the reason this gauge needs replaced
we<00:00:17.940> see<00:00:18.090> the<00:00:18.210> temp<00:00:18.449> gauge<00:00:18.660> pegged<00:00:19.470> all<00:00:19.680> the<00:00:19.800> way

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
we see the temp gauge pegged all the way

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.010 
we see the temp gauge pegged all the way
to<00:00:19.949> the<00:00:20.160> right<00:00:20.340> side<00:00:20.580> which<00:00:21.359> is<00:00:21.510> an<00:00:21.630> indication

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
to the right side which is an indication

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.109 
to the right side which is an indication
that<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.529> instrument<00:00:23.070> cluster<00:00:23.189> needs

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
that the instrument cluster needs

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.359 
that the instrument cluster needs
replaced<00:00:24.529> so<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:25.619> first<00:00:25.830> thing<00:00:26.010> we<00:00:26.130> need<00:00:26.250> to

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
replaced so the first thing we need to

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.550 
replaced so the first thing we need to
do<00:00:26.519> is<00:00:26.640> remove<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:27.119> grille<00:00:27.359> from<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.289> center

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
do is remove the grille from the center

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.320 
do is remove the grille from the center
of<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.740> dash<00:00:28.920> here<00:00:29.250> and<00:00:29.429> then<00:00:29.970> that<00:00:30.150> will

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
of the dash here and then that will

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:39.979 
of the dash here and then that will
expose<00:00:30.750> a<00:00:30.810> screw<00:00:37.640> that<00:00:38.640> holds<00:00:38.840> the<00:00:39.840> whole

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
expose a screw that holds the whole

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.200 
expose a screw that holds the whole
defroster<00:00:40.590> pad<00:00:40.800> that<00:00:41.040> runs<00:00:41.340> from<00:00:41.640> a<00:00:41.820> pillar<00:00:42.059> to

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
defroster pad that runs from a pillar to

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.660 
defroster pad that runs from a pillar to
a<00:00:42.239> pillar<00:00:42.620> pull<00:00:43.620> that<00:00:43.770> screw<00:00:44.040> out<00:00:44.190> then<00:00:44.460> pop

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
a pillar pull that screw out then pop

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.750 
a pillar pull that screw out then pop
that<00:00:44.879> panel<00:00:45.270> out<00:00:45.329> of<00:00:45.480> there<00:00:46.309> so<00:00:47.309> we've<00:00:47.460> got<00:00:47.610> the

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
that panel out of there so we've got the

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.720 
that panel out of there so we've got the
defroster<00:00:48.300> grill<00:00:48.930> removed<00:00:49.410> at<00:00:50.129> this<00:00:50.280> point<00:00:50.520> we

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
defroster grill removed at this point we

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.220 
defroster grill removed at this point we
just<00:00:50.760> want<00:00:51.120> to<00:00:51.180> remove<00:00:51.420> all<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.719> panels<00:00:52.079> that

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
just want to remove all the panels that

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.470 
just want to remove all the panels that
we<00:00:52.350> need<00:00:52.500> to<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.829> access<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.399> fasteners<00:00:53.940> that

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
we need to to access the fasteners that

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.060 
we need to to access the fasteners that
hold<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.780> top<00:00:54.960> of<00:00:55.140> this<00:00:55.230> dash<00:00:55.500> in<00:00:55.770> because<00:00:55.980> the

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
hold the top of this dash in because the

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.920 
hold the top of this dash in because the
whole<00:00:56.219> top<00:00:56.460> of<00:00:56.610> this<00:00:56.670> dash<00:00:56.940> is<00:00:57.180> going<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:57.719> come

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
each side here and here and we can pull

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:34.150 
each side here and here and we can pull
those<00:02:31.610> out<00:02:31.820> and<00:02:32.080> disconnect<00:02:33.080> the<00:02:33.680> instrument

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
those out and disconnect the instrument

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:58.270 
those out and disconnect the instrument
cluster<00:02:56.110> now<00:02:57.110> once<00:02:57.290> we<00:02:57.440> get<00:02:57.560> to<00:02:57.709> that<00:02:57.739> point<00:02:58.130> we

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
cluster now once we get to that point we

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.130 
cluster now once we get to that point we
can<00:02:58.430> plug<00:02:58.670> in<00:02:58.850> our<00:02:58.970> replacement<00:02:59.570> gauge<00:02:59.810> and

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
can plug in our replacement gauge and

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.750 
can plug in our replacement gauge and
check<00:03:00.769> it<00:03:00.920> make<00:03:01.070> sure<00:03:01.100> everything<00:03:01.580> is<00:03:01.640> working

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.140 

now<00:03:15.980> once<00:03:16.129> you<00:03:16.219> have<00:03:16.280> the<00:03:16.430> replacement<00:03:16.639> gauge

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
now once you have the replacement gauge

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.149 
now once you have the replacement gauge
plugged<00:03:17.540> in<00:03:17.749> and<00:03:18.260> go<00:03:18.439> ahead<00:03:18.560> and<00:03:18.709> start<00:03:18.920> it<00:03:19.069> and

00:03:19.149 --> 00:03:19.159 
plugged in and go ahead and start it and

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:20.259 
plugged in and go ahead and start it and
make<00:03:19.249> sure<00:03:19.280> everything<00:03:19.400> on<00:03:19.760> the<00:03:19.879> gauge<00:03:20.060> is

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
make sure everything on the gauge is

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:26.180 
make sure everything on the gauge is
working<00:03:20.689> properly

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.560 

it<00:03:26.700> looks<00:03:26.880> like<00:03:26.970> everything's<00:03:27.390> back<00:03:27.510> to

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
it looks like everything's back to

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.840 
it looks like everything's back to
normal<00:03:27.750> we<00:03:28.530> see<00:03:28.680> the<00:03:28.800> temp<00:03:28.980> gauge<00:03:29.160> is<00:03:29.460> normal

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
normal we see the temp gauge is normal

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.290 
normal we see the temp gauge is normal
it's<00:03:30.120> a<00:03:30.210> cold<00:03:30.420> engine<00:03:31.790> looks<00:03:32.790> like<00:03:32.970> this<00:03:33.120> took

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
it's a cold engine looks like this took

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:34.550 
it's a cold engine looks like this took
care<00:03:33.510> of<00:03:33.540> the<00:03:33.630> problem<00:03:33.990> now<00:03:34.110> we<00:03:34.170> can<00:03:34.350> go<00:03:34.440> ahead

care of the problem now we can go ahead
and<00:03:34.800> put<00:03:35.640> our<00:03:35.760> bolts<00:03:35.880> back<00:03:36.180> together<00:03:36.360> put

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
and put our bolts back together put

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.060 
and put our bolts back together put
everything<00:03:36.960> back<00:03:37.200> together<00:03:37.410> the<00:03:37.710> way<00:03:37.740> it<00:03:37.920> came
