00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:04.940
 good night the truth that 

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:07.580
 still having a little great what has 

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:10.309
 gone so it's not to be expected is not the 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:12.530
 decision in the locker room and good a 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:15.890
 match that unbelievably goes away from us 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:17.810
 the hand that has passed because the 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:19.849
 resolution has been cruel you have made a 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.800
 party very well raised very well 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:23.710
 taken and suddenly in four minutes 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.640
 everything has gone down 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:29.949
 well I think they started throwing 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.750
 the balls are not in the area of ​​the 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:35.570
 desperation I take them and play that 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:40.130
 it was four minutes where practically 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:43.130
 they played what comes out and in the end I think 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:44.690
 they were very lucky not only 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.520
 finding the goals but also the 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.600
 situations that occur not from a third party 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.110
 maybe in you know 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.660
 and good that 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:56.430
 they are situations that are of soccer but 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.920
 where it really has little to do 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.480
 not good play are not situations 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.580
 where they actually had a lot 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.020
 lucky me my years of profession never 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.920
 had lived what you saw here when 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:06.510
 dug the party 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.860
 you were practically all waiting 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.180
 the replays on the screens and 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.790
 you have confirmed that there was 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.790
 game is played by the third goal not all 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.180
 world it fits well 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:19.760
 to be expected not wear was tremendous 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.160
 and I think everyone has made an effort 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.140
 superhuman and the truth that after 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.880
 everything goes to the rack for a 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.320
 mistake makes it clear that they will 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.690
 leave one more hot 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.080
 and now you have to calm down and treat 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.370
 to order things as they are 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:38.850
 obviously it is the disappointment is very 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:41.790
 We are not 4 minutes away from playing 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.400
 semifinals and well it is not gone 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.830
 everything to the tacho not in those minutes in the 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.970
 last roque understand that not many 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.770
 the desire to talk after what he has 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.150
 happened for the hobby that has 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.920
 displaced for those over 2000 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.410
 from Malaga who have been living a 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.869
 illusion for 90 minutes and everything is 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.810
 has fallen at the end that you can tell them 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:03.280
 what can you tell them 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:05.979
 or I think that I 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.340
 have witnessed a great party of 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:11.250
 one of a great team performance and 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:14.980
 well I think that the exception of them 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:17.230
 It looked like ours and well I think 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.300
 who are going to understand us about gas wear 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.680
 who made the team and who are going to go 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.200
 satisfied with the performance of the 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.390
 players now there's no need to see 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.010
 how the mood of the locker room rises and 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.630
 order what's left of the league, not the 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.970
 best possible way and to combine a 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:33.400
 an incredible season that we are 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:36.810
 living thanks and despite everything to 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.810
 despite the elimination congratulations
