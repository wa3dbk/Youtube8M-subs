00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 we are with luigi tivelli 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.670
 parliamentary adviser already head of 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.350
 cabinet in previous legislatures 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:13.170
 columnist of the messenger and 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:15.779
 morning and with him we make a comment 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.060
 starting from our editorial of 

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:19.740
 director andrea viscardi this morning has 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.780
 started the tug of war between the government 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.180
 who would like to save face and class 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:27.660
 political the skin and analyze a little 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.190
 current political situation it is true that 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.399
 the government wants to save face 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:34.890
 because the points and the face put it there 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.440
 he put it on so many aspects that there is 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.260
 put it compared to Europe the sun 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.699
 I don't think many are very happy to 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.829
 put your face in relation to Europe and 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:50.159
 to large countries like the united states and 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:54.089
 then see the press conferences of 

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:57.780
 berlusconi that ruin the face of the 

00:00:54.089 --> 00:01:03.899
 country with respect to Europe and forces 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:06.439
 policies of your editorial there 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.479
 they put the skin because they succeeded 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:12.329
 for the first time in Italian history 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.159
 to induce more than 50 percent of the 

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:15.810
 citizens not to go and vote for 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:20.609
 this way is not just data of the 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:23.880
 sicily but in the polls it seems also the 

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:26.939
 national figure because it is always more 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:30.719
 deep the distance between the forces 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:32.340
 country policies and not expert in 

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:35.520
 noon midday politics 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:38.189
 I have n't studied the current government so much 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.619
 what is it doing midday but 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:44.039
 the current government as far as I know 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:48.869
 is doing very positive things because 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:52.320
 first set up ministry for 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.240
 the cohesion policies entrusting it to 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.890
 a great expert on this because 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.430
 fabrizio barca the minister 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.860
 he is not just a great economist 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:04.200
 by the bank of italy research department 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.940
 but he is also an expert has been head of 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.260
 policy department of 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.920
 cohesion to the Ministry of Economy 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:14.160
 long is one of the very few in this 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:17.670
 country that knows how to attract European funds 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:21.540
 just the thing that the ruling class 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:23.459
 midday partly in basilicata 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.170
 something has been done but for the rest 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.420
 the political ruling class of the 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:31.590
 noon showed it was not 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:34.050
 absolutely capable of using i 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:37.800
 European structural funds often rise 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:39.840
 use them to fuel corruption 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:43.110
 so it's a strong signal that the government 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.480
 though this weighs too much talk 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:49.860
 little of midday and also the same 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:52.800
 government does not favor discussion about 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:55.769
 this should be and is the node 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:58.620
 fundamental of the country is for the 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:04.380
 negative aspects that for the potential 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:06.810
 positive because in midday 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:09.690
 there are also many shadows 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:12.120
 of the lights we speak little of the shadows 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:15.570
 because analyzing the shadows would serve to 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:18.930
 introduce new lights and never talk 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:21.630
 of the lights instead of which one should 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.980
 speak in his book and read 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.160
 to Italy especially in the south 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:28.160
 teems with prepared and motivated young people 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:31.829
 they can be their bright future 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:34.799
 but look there is a very nice book by 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:39.299
 a young camillus falasca published by 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:41.700
 rubbettino called terroni 2.0 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:44.110
 and this very agile booklet 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:49.020
 intelligent 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:52.900
 talk about all the young southerners who 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:57.340
 they emigrated to the central north of the 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:04:01.050
 country and that almost always have achieved 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.050
 relevant positions 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:08.500
 since a young age since 28 30 years 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.760
 in the universities in the professions in the 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.940
 companies 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.950
 the noon treasure could 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:19.660
 be these young people for these young people 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:24.160
 he calls them terroni 2.0 2.0 because 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:28.090
 I'm also the internet generation 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:31.600
 of the web and terroni because they have remained 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:34.630
 terroni are bound to their country one 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:38.080
 once a month they go to Calabria e 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:41.320
 the soppressata is brought to Milan 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:44.320
 I don't know but not only that continue 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:47.820
 to observe what happens in theirs 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:53.110
 territories here for example establish 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:56.410
 incentives for the return of these 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:59.050
 brains because brains are not alone 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:01.840
 those who make great discoveries but 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:05.130
 they are also those who work with 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:08.130
 success in different realities 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:11.200
 professional has for example establish 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:13.720
 incentives for the return of these 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:16.060
 young people I do an example it 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:18.160
 the collapse of midday derives broadly 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:21.010
 part from the collapse of the 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:22.690
 public administrations because of 

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:25.009
 regional administrations are one 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:28.309
 shame in the media administers them 

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:30.469
 of the southern regions and often it is 

00:05:28.309 --> 00:05:32.509
 so also for the provincial ones and 

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:36.229
 municipal except for some cases of 

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:40.119
 success then offer young people a 

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:44.659
 master and who is working on west one 

00:05:40.119 --> 00:05:49.339
 incentive agreement if you agree to do 

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:52.189
 the deputy director general of 

00:05:49.339 --> 00:05:54.979
 direction for the formation of 

00:05:52.189 --> 00:05:56.689
 Campania region where as in almost 

00:05:54.979 --> 00:05:59.569
 all regions also in the north 

00:05:56.689 --> 00:06:01.939
 vocational training only serves to 

00:05:59.569 --> 00:06:04.969
 to pay incapable professors or to do 

00:06:01.939 --> 00:06:05.740
 turn bribes bring these young people 

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:08.330
 positions 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:11.919
 it would be a line that the regions 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:11.919
 southerners should follow
