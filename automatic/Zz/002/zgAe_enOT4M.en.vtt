00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
going to unplug it and you can see a

going to unplug it and you can see a
steady<00:02:55.610> decrease<00:02:56.610> in<00:02:56.730> battery<00:02:57.330> power<00:02:57.630> I<00:02:57.810> have

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
steady decrease in battery power I have

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.780 
steady decrease in battery power I have
not<00:02:58.260> turned<00:02:58.650> it<00:02:58.860> on<00:02:59.120> at<00:03:00.120> all<00:03:00.770> and<00:03:01.770> still<00:03:02.340> the

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
not turned it on at all and still the

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:10.449 
not turned it on at all and still the
theme<00:03:03.030> is<00:03:03.300> when<00:03:03.510> I<00:03:03.540> left<00:03:03.870> it<00:03:05.570> over<00:03:06.570> the<00:03:06.930> battery

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:13.220 

and<00:03:11.459> we're<00:03:12.000> going<00:03:12.180> to<00:03:12.270> see<00:03:12.420> if<00:03:12.570> it<00:03:12.690> even<00:03:12.810> turns

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
and we're going to see if it even turns

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:18.350 
and we're going to see if it even turns
on<00:03:15.620> we'll<00:03:16.620> see<00:03:16.800> the<00:03:16.920> battery<00:03:17.190> power<00:03:17.520> like<00:03:18.180> I

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
on we'll see the battery power like I

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:24.640 
on we'll see the battery power like I
said<00:03:18.630> you<00:03:19.470> charged<00:03:19.890> it<00:03:20.070> up<00:03:20.190> the<00:03:21.000> full<00:03:21.209> charge

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.270 

so<00:03:25.650> the<00:03:25.770> battery<00:03:26.190> meter<00:03:26.400> should<00:03:26.700> say<00:03:26.970> full<00:03:28.280> and

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
so the battery meter should say full and

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:38.830 
so the battery meter should say full and
wasn't<00:03:29.910> saying<00:03:30.739> have<00:03:31.739> gone<00:03:33.380> got<00:03:34.430> even<00:03:35.430> more

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.690 

if<00:03:39.840> I<00:03:40.049> had<00:03:40.230> more<00:03:40.439> time<00:03:40.739> and<00:03:40.799> I<00:03:41.069> didn't<00:03:41.370> have<00:03:41.519> to

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
if I had more time and I didn't have to

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.130
