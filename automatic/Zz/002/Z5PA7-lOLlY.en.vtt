players<00:02:39.780> are<00:02:39.959> certainly<00:02:40.320> feeling<00:02:40.620> the<00:02:40.800> burn

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
players are certainly feeling the burn

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.760 
players are certainly feeling the burn
of<00:02:41.010> those<00:02:41.280> distributions<00:02:42.080> okay<00:02:43.080> that<00:02:43.620> is<00:02:43.739> a

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
of those distributions okay that is a

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.770 
of those distributions okay that is a
very<00:02:44.220> very<00:02:44.670> last-minute<00:02:45.120> save<00:02:45.510> by

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
very very last-minute save by

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.300 
very very last-minute save by
essentiality<00:02:46.260> there<00:02:46.650> but<00:02:46.770> it<00:02:46.860> does<00:02:47.040> look<00:02:47.070> like

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
essentiality there but it does look like

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.580 
essentiality there but it does look like
he's<00:02:47.730> going<00:02:47.970> to<00:02:48.090> go<00:02:48.270> I<00:02:48.330> can't<00:02:48.720> see<00:02:48.959> well<00:02:49.560> i

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
he's going to go I can't see well i

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.670 
he's going to go I can't see well i
don't<00:02:49.830> know<00:02:50.060> maybe<00:02:51.060> just<00:02:51.989> maybe<00:02:52.200> if<00:02:52.410> he<00:02:52.560> can

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
don't know maybe just maybe if he can

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.170 
don't know maybe just maybe if he can
tracks<00:02:52.920> that<00:02:53.100> hip<00:02:53.280> and<00:02:53.459> contracts<00:02:54.000> that

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
tracks that hip and contracts that

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.760 
tracks that hip and contracts that
shoulder<00:02:54.570> he<00:02:54.959> might<00:02:55.200> just<00:02:55.380> be<00:02:55.440> able<00:02:55.560> to<00:02:55.680> hold

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
shoulder he might just be able to hold

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.500 
shoulder he might just be able to hold
on<00:02:55.950> for<00:02:55.980> one<00:02:56.310> more<00:02:56.340> turn<00:02:56.670> but<00:02:56.880> that<00:02:56.970> is<00:02:57.060> highly

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
on for one more turn but that is highly

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.479 
on for one more turn but that is highly
highly<00:02:57.690> unlikely<00:02:58.080> that<00:02:58.410> was<00:02:58.800> a<00:02:58.830> very<00:02:59.220> very

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
highly unlikely that was a very very

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.310 
highly unlikely that was a very very
good<00:02:59.760> throw<00:03:00.000> by<00:03:00.120> alec<00:03:00.450> there<00:03:00.630> i'm<00:03:00.810> sure<00:03:01.110> we'll

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
good throw by alec there i'm sure we'll

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.020 
good throw by alec there i'm sure we'll
see<00:03:01.470> it<00:03:01.530> in<00:03:01.620> the<00:03:01.709> replay<00:03:01.980> just<00:03:02.070> confirmation<00:03:02.580> I

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
see it in the replay just confirmation I

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.539 
see it in the replay just confirmation I
doubt<00:03:03.660> ah<00:03:03.900> there<00:03:04.350> we<00:03:04.440> go<00:03:04.470> Alec<00:03:04.920> wins<00:03:05.130> round<00:03:05.370> one

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
doubt ah there we go Alec wins round one

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:07.310 
doubt ah there we go Alec wins round one
so<00:03:05.940> one<00:03:06.120> nail<00:03:06.330> to<00:03:06.450> Alec<00:03:06.720> lets<00:03:06.870> up<00:03:06.989> take<00:03:07.140> a<00:03:07.170> look

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
so one nail to Alec lets up take a look

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.990 
so one nail to Alec lets up take a look
at<00:03:07.380> that<00:03:07.410> throw<00:03:07.680> before<00:03:07.980> we<00:03:08.130> move<00:03:08.250> along<00:03:08.340> that

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
at that throw before we move along that

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.479 
at that throw before we move along that
was<00:03:09.090> a<00:03:09.150> really<00:03:09.360> nice<00:03:09.570> let<00:03:09.959> go<00:03:10.230> on<00:03:10.470> on<00:03:10.920> Alex<00:03:11.070> part

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
was a really nice let go on on Alex part

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:12.860 
was a really nice let go on on Alex part
that<00:03:11.670> I<00:03:11.700> was<00:03:11.880> really<00:03:12.090> well<00:03:12.269> done<00:03:12.299> i<00:03:12.540> don't<00:03:12.780> like

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
that I was really well done i don't like

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.650 
that I was really well done i don't like
essentiality<00:03:13.230> was<00:03:13.500> expecting<00:03:14.010> that<00:03:14.390> now<00:03:15.390> it's

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
essentiality was expecting that now it's

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:16.789

gonna<00:03:15.780> be<00:03:15.840> very<00:03:15.930> interesting<00:03:16.140> to<00:03:16.590> see<00:03:16.709> how

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
gonna be very interesting to see how

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:18.890 
gonna be very interesting to see how

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
see that a lot in twin swords that the

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.229 
see that a lot in twin swords that the
first<00:03:52.590> move<00:03:52.860> is<00:03:53.040> very<00:03:53.400> very<00:03:53.640> important<00:03:54.120> like

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
first move is very very important like

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:55.280 
first move is very very important like
what<00:03:54.390> we<00:03:54.450> just<00:03:54.480> saw<00:03:54.780> up<00:03:54.840> there<00:03:54.900> where<00:03:55.230> the

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
what we just saw up there where the

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.380 
what we just saw up there where the
first<00:03:55.470> move<00:03:55.709> has<00:03:56.280> definitely<00:03:57.120> set

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
first move has definitely set

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.449 
first move has definitely set
essentiality<00:03:57.810> back<00:03:58.230> now<00:03:58.440> hopefully<00:03:59.160> that<00:03:59.310> arm

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
essentiality back now hopefully that arm

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:00.770 
essentiality back now hopefully that arm
won't<00:03:59.640> roll<00:03:59.880> out<00:04:00.060> and<00:04:00.180> i<00:04:00.209> don't<00:04:00.480> think<00:04:00.570> it's

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
won't roll out and i don't think it's

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.180 
won't roll out and i don't think it's
going<00:04:00.959> to<00:04:01.079> the<00:04:01.260> way<00:04:01.350> he<00:04:01.530> relaxed<00:04:01.920> that<00:04:02.040> there

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
going to the way he relaxed that there

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.100 
going to the way he relaxed that there
has<00:04:02.340> definitely<00:04:02.370> saved<00:04:03.120> his<00:04:03.299> arm<00:04:03.840> from

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
has definitely saved his arm from

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.680 
has definitely saved his arm from
rolling<00:04:04.380> out<00:04:04.500> but<00:04:05.010> i<00:04:05.040> do<00:04:05.130> think<00:04:05.510> alec<00:04:06.510> is

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
rolling out but i do think alec is

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.030 
rolling out but i do think alec is
following<00:04:07.260> that<00:04:07.380> up<00:04:07.410> with<00:04:07.560> a<00:04:07.620> slash<00:04:07.800> to<00:04:07.950> his

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
following that up with a slash to his

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.740 
following that up with a slash to his
hand<00:04:08.220> he<00:04:08.370> manages<00:04:08.670> to<00:04:08.760> cut<00:04:08.940> the<00:04:09.030> other<00:04:09.209> arm<00:04:09.569> off

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
hand he manages to cut the other arm off

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:10.930 
hand he manages to cut the other arm off
essentially<00:04:10.230> out<00:04:10.319> he's<00:04:10.500> gonna<00:04:10.590> have

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:10.940 
essentially out he's gonna have

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.000 
essentially out he's gonna have
very<00:04:11.120> very<00:04:11.450> hard<00:04:11.660> job<00:04:11.750> getting<00:04:12.110> any<00:04:12.440> points<00:04:12.890> in

for<00:04:35.180> that<00:04:35.360> but<00:04:35.600> it<00:04:35.690> didn't<00:04:35.870> expect<00:04:36.140> it<00:04:36.200> to<00:04:36.320> do

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:36.410 
for that but it didn't expect it to do

essentiality<00:04:42.470> wins<00:04:42.950> with<00:04:43.370> a<00:04:43.400> very<00:04:43.850> nice

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 
essentiality wins with a very nice

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.330 
essentiality wins with a very nice
counter<00:04:44.510> /<00:04:44.720> to<00:04:44.930> Alex<00:04:45.200> crotch<00:04:45.440> and<00:04:45.680> that<00:04:46.130> body

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
counter / to Alex crotch and that body

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.250 
counter / to Alex crotch and that body
part<00:04:46.460> taps<00:04:46.910> him<00:04:47.150> out<00:04:47.300> one<00:04:47.630> or<00:04:47.810> we<00:04:48.020> go<00:04:48.140> to<00:04:48.200> our

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:48.260 
part taps him out one or we go to our

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.190 
part taps him out one or we go to our
final<00:04:48.800> round<00:04:49.360> now<00:04:50.360> I<00:04:50.390> think<00:04:50.750> if<00:04:50.840> there's<00:04:50.990> one

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:51.200 
final round now I think if there's one

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.330 
final round now I think if there's one
thing<00:04:51.260> we've<00:04:51.740> learned<00:04:51.770> from<00:04:52.130> the<00:04:52.220> previous

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.340 
thing we've learned from the previous

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.100 
thing we've learned from the previous
rounds<00:04:52.910> is<00:04:53.030> that<00:04:53.180> the<00:04:53.270> opener<00:04:53.780> and<00:04:53.900> through

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110 
rounds is that the opener and through

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:55.450 
rounds is that the opener and through
six<00:04:54.320> to<00:04:54.440> go<00:04:54.530> people<00:04:54.800> is<00:04:55.040> one<00:04:55.190> of<00:04:55.250> the<00:04:55.340> most

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460 
six to go people is one of the most

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.580 
six to go people is one of the most
important<00:04:56.210> openers<00:04:56.660> of<00:04:56.780> any<00:04:56.930> mod<00:04:57.200> we've<00:04:57.380> seen

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
important openers of any mod we've seen

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:59.530 
important openers of any mod we've seen
so<00:04:57.800> far<00:04:57.830> and<00:04:58.220> I<00:04:58.520> think<00:04:58.730> both<00:04:59.030> players<00:04:59.360> are

00:04:59.530 --> 00:04:59.540 
so far and I think both players are

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:01.390 
so far and I think both players are
shockingly<00:05:00.290> aware<00:05:00.620> of<00:05:00.650> that<00:05:00.860> especially

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.400 
shockingly aware of that especially

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.070 
shockingly aware of that especially
after<00:05:01.520> the<00:05:01.670> twist<00:05:01.880> in<00:05:02.060> the<00:05:02.120> previous<00:05:02.360> round<00:05:02.540> so

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 
after the twist in the previous round so

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.510 
after the twist in the previous round so
I<00:05:03.110> do<00:05:03.230> believe<00:05:03.650> both<00:05:03.950> players<00:05:04.220> are<00:05:04.310> gonna<00:05:04.400> be

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520 
I do believe both players are gonna be

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:05.650 
I do believe both players are gonna be
bringing<00:05:04.730> their<00:05:04.820> a-game<00:05:04.910> to<00:05:05.210> the<00:05:05.300> sore<00:05:05.450> neck

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:05.660 
bringing their a-game to the sore neck

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.120 
bringing their a-game to the sore neck
trying<00:05:05.840> to<00:05:05.930> do<00:05:05.990> as<00:05:06.080> much<00:05:06.110> damage<00:05:06.410> in<00:05:06.890> the<00:05:06.980> first

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.130 
trying to do as much damage in the first

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:09.040 
trying to do as much damage in the first
couple<00:05:07.310> of<00:05:07.430> frames<00:05:07.640> as<00:05:07.850> they<00:05:08.030> can<00:05:08.270> let's<00:05:08.870> take

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050 
couple of frames as they can let's take

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.080 
couple of frames as they can let's take
a<00:05:09.080> look<00:05:09.230> are<00:05:09.320> they<00:05:09.350> gonna<00:05:09.500> open<00:05:09.770> this<00:05:10.090> okay

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.090 
a look are they gonna open this okay

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:12.670 
a look are they gonna open this okay
yeah<00:05:11.330> we<00:05:11.450> got<00:05:11.480> both<00:05:11.780> players<00:05:12.050> really<00:05:12.470> trying

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:12.680 
yeah we got both players really trying

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.080 
yeah we got both players really trying
to<00:05:12.740> get<00:05:12.830> that<00:05:12.980> spin<00:05:13.310> kick<00:05:13.340> which<00:05:13.700> we've<00:05:13.850> seen

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.090 
to get that spin kick which we've seen

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:15.730 
to get that spin kick which we've seen
it's<00:05:14.570> interesting<00:05:15.080> that<00:05:15.260> essentially<00:05:15.680> out

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:15.740 
it's interesting that essentially out

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:17.320 
it's interesting that essentially out
contracted<00:05:16.250> is<00:05:16.340> neither<00:05:16.610> imagine<00:05:17.210> you<00:05:17.270> is

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:17.330 
contracted is neither imagine you is

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.180 
contracted is neither imagine you is
probably<00:05:17.690> going<00:05:17.870> for<00:05:18.050> a<00:05:18.110> kick<00:05:18.320> but<00:05:18.680> with<00:05:18.830> 50

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:19.190 
probably going for a kick but with 50

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:20.740 
probably going for a kick but with 50

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:20.750 
frames of turn lining stuff up like that

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:23.200 
frames of turn lining stuff up like that
is<00:05:20.900> very<00:05:21.200> very<00:05:21.350> difficult<00:05:21.950> notice<00:05:22.880> Matt<00:05:23.030> no

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.210 
is very very difficult notice Matt no

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:25.150 
is very very difficult notice Matt no

dislocations notice members as of yet
both<00:05:25.520> place<00:05:25.760> is<00:05:25.880> definitely<00:05:26.030> about<00:05:26.300> to<00:05:26.390> spin

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:26.780 
both place is definitely about to spin

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:28.090 
both place is definitely about to spin
into<00:05:26.930> each<00:05:27.110> other<00:05:27.290> which<00:05:27.440> I<00:05:27.530> imagine<00:05:27.620> is<00:05:27.919> gonna

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:28.100 
into each other which I imagine is gonna

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:30.070 
into each other which I imagine is gonna
cause<00:05:28.310> quite<00:05:28.880> a<00:05:28.940> lot<00:05:29.120> of<00:05:29.150> damage<00:05:29.390> if<00:05:29.600> I<00:05:29.690> do<00:05:29.750> say

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080 
cause quite a lot of damage if I do say

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.730 
cause quite a lot of damage if I do say
so<00:05:30.110> and<00:05:30.290> we<00:05:30.440> should<00:05:30.680> find<00:05:30.980> out<00:05:31.130> in<00:05:31.340> a<00:05:31.790> moment
