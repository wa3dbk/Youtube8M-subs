00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.959
 Towards last night probably has the satellite dish representative mother 

00:00:02.959 --> 00:00:04.410
 I watch the technicians 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.250
 your answer to everything i hoped technician not on anything i hope 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.009
 also remember the technique 

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:14.009
 although the once exhibited as a male technician 

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:18.199
 the statements, however, he was refunded 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:21.359
 so big that you can not call the technicians you just have to change the bowl 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.359
 align for a good reception what the technician mother made 

00:00:24.909 --> 00:00:28.459
 but tonight she comes with her ten non-stop on the TV yes 

00:00:28.459 --> 00:00:31.939
 you hear them I come right to you for the sake of giving the ball 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:33.580
 have to 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:35.130
 Pauli the ladder 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.380
 not that different and we have them five minutes 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.380
 I'm relieved 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.650
 I am so afraid of the leader 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.650
 instead, do not remember that I'm more easily bought 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:49.940
 as you can see it was done 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.220
 but why 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.339
 and how come I do not know 

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:56.670
 the comparison to 2008 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:57.830
 is there 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:58.860
 as questionable 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.500
 That's in North Rhine-Westphalia 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.190
 to realize that 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:04.410
 I climb first run 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:05.489
 and Credit Suisse 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.620
 Doris and Fernseh Kreis will become the work of dpa 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:13.329
 Porsche will make sure that the call forgets the technician 

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:16.329
 I am the technician 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.600
 the eyes lock was 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.150
 through the wars 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.160
 percent 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.330
 Wales 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.340
 Advisor to the Toronto Reuters 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:37.740

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:38.770

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.240
 how is it now 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.590
 a little better 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:42.750
 for the time being 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.750
 No, one worse in the other direction 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.700
 this server is the other direction, yes, exactly the time 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.600
 I said that the rest of the world goalkeeper but not at all 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:00.580
