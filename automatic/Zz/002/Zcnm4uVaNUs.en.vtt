00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
comic books he was more like a lone

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.110 
force recon kind of a character which I

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.410 
force recon kind of a character which I
guess<00:01:01.380> is<00:01:01.590> basically<00:01:02.340> what<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.520> survivalist<00:01:03.210> he

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
guess is basically what a survivalist he

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.810 
guess is basically what a survivalist he
is<00:01:03.540> in<00:01:03.750> this<00:01:03.899> in<00:01:04.170> this<00:01:04.379> context<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.460> so<00:01:05.670> while

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
is in this in this context and so while

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.480 
is in this in this context and so while
else<00:01:06.060> I<00:01:06.180> guess<00:01:06.360> is<00:01:06.570> more<00:01:07.140> of<00:01:07.229> an<00:01:07.350> easier<00:01:07.740> term

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
else I guess is more of an easier term

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.750 
else I guess is more of an easier term

have seen some people actually put that
in<00:03:27.299> there<00:03:27.590> unfortunately<00:03:28.590> because<00:03:28.890> it's<00:03:29.040> a

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
in there unfortunately because it's a

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
of do have to handle it by the shaft you

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.039 
of do have to handle it by the shaft you
can't<00:03:37.860> just<00:03:38.130> like<00:03:38.400> yeah<00:03:39.150> I<00:03:39.180> mean<00:03:39.360> obviously<00:03:39.840> it

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
can't just like yeah I mean obviously it

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:42.770 
can't just like yeah I mean obviously it
can<00:03:40.560> fit<00:03:40.890> on<00:03:41.040> with<00:03:41.370> the<00:03:41.519> gist<00:03:41.730> of<00:03:41.790> the<00:03:41.880> peg<00:03:42.090> but

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
can fit on with the gist of the peg but

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.819 
can fit on with the gist of the peg but
it<00:03:42.900> kind<00:03:43.079> of<00:03:43.140> looks<00:03:43.200> wrong<00:03:43.560> in<00:03:43.980> that<00:03:44.130> case

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:45.829 
it kind of looks wrong in that case

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:48.830 
it kind of looks wrong in that case
unlike<00:03:46.829> a<00:03:46.859> lot<00:03:47.100> of<00:03:47.130> other<00:03:47.430> flashy<00:03:48.180> t-shirts

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840

with the u survival written on it

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.509 
with the u survival written on it
actually<00:03:55.019> suits<00:03:55.560> them<00:03:55.769> because<00:03:56.130> it<00:03:56.220> really

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
actually suits them because it really

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:59.440 
actually suits them because it really
reminds<00:03:56.850> me<00:03:57.000> of<00:03:57.180> that<00:03:57.239> type<00:03:57.480> of<00:03:57.560> t-shirt<00:03:58.560> that

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450
