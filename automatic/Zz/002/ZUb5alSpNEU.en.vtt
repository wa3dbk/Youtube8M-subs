00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:07.440
 Hello friends with you your car 74 I 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:10.679
 returned not gone there a lot of people 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:13.139
 I was lost but I didn't get anywhere 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:18.539
 bit then decided to relax a bit 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:21.300
 to deal with your own affairs 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.890
 Yesterday came the ninth we were not 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.439
 opportunities guys i yesterday 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.470
 reinstalled Windows shorter there 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:31.230
 problems were with windows kai shorter here 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.020
 such is the trouble on the Internet now is not 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.700
 so easy to find 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:38.520
 the licensed version of the game is not hacked 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.350
 that is, I have the same license 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.500
 There are no 100 keys of the disk 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.230
 that's why yesterday I was looking for a very long time 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.969
 licensed Windows but still I found 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.469
 reinstalled you all know very well 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.510
 that I bought iron and not 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.910
 Windows reinstalled Windows buggy 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.989
 constantly hit problems were but now 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:02.989
 all this is fixed and god grant so 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:05.640
 congratulations to all of us for the great victory 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:11.960
 here today on my review 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:15.979
 ZIL 3901 with 1 is our manufacturer 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:19.729
 kefirchik he made it to the day of victory 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:23.130
 thank you so much and 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:25.680
 Wonder what he did, here I sit 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.560
 looking at you will see traces here 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.299
 I traveled a little bit to and fro 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.009
 so say so let's go 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.240
 directly to the model let's see what 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:40.590
 this and what it is eaten with 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:42.659
 But right now , I noticed and I watched 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.280
 looked twisted spit could not find a 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.560
 affects here 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.930
 Kalashnikov rifle lies on the torpedo 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:54.450
 now wonderful in appearance 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:57.100
 protection is done at all cool 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.040
 On such machines it is necessary to swamp and 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.320
 the desert ride that is in no other way 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.730
 because color is not 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.500
 green paint it does not fit or 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:12.120
 in the fall on such a machine somewhere 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:19.540
 hide warface ride on okay so 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:21.000
 damn it turret and why turret turret 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.400
 same this 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.680
 but oh well since we will remove on 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.240
 just in case because three addon 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.990
 set God forbid fly somewhere 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:35.140
 reluctance 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:41.350
 return and the light is screwed 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:43.210
 guys so gun is wonderful not 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:47.290

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:51.300
 and why do guns spintires in general but 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:58.570
 she can not do anything in spring 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:03:03.190
 we need a turret gives us repair glasses 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:08.640

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.180

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:31.959
 guys what are cylinders in general where is he 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:35.140
 there is written here that it is capacitive 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:37.840
 tank with 40 liter tank capacity 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:40.090
 that is, it is somewhere apparently inside 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:46.959
 the tank clings and you can 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:49.570
 fill 40 liters fine then your 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:53.620

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:56.380
 now I still cleave the civil 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.090
 dudes who sit in the car to me 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:01.950
 know that it is not like the fact that 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:05.320
 dude leg sticks out of car and ass 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:11.400
 background sits half dried 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:11.400
 and leaning out of the car as a heart 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:20.070
 let's go ride a gun clings will not 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.070

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:28.789

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:31.490
 I only know there and there I drove 

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:32.990
 I understand why we are driving so slowly she 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:35.919
 probably does not go faster just this 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.919

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:47.610
