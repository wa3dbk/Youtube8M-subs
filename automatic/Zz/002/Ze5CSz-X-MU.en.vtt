financial three no this one might be the
closest<00:00:58.710> when<00:00:58.890> I<00:00:58.920> again<00:00:59.430> again<00:00:59.730> I<00:00:59.760> thought<00:01:00.090> me

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
closest when I again again I thought me

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.000 
closest when I again again I thought me
any<00:01:00.390> pulled<00:01:00.600> out<00:01:00.750> last<00:01:01.050> two<00:01:01.230> rounds<00:01:01.379> we<00:01:01.739> didn't

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
any pulled out last two rounds we didn't

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.219 
any pulled out last two rounds we didn't
we<00:01:02.520> doing<00:01:02.820> that<00:01:03.000> wouldn't<00:01:03.300> that<00:01:03.480> last<00:01:03.750> time<00:01:03.989> I

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
we doing that wouldn't that last time I

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.770 
we doing that wouldn't that last time I
thought<00:01:04.920> I<00:01:05.280> thought<00:01:05.580> it<00:01:05.729> might<00:01:05.939> be<00:01:06.240> jar<00:01:06.570> the

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
thought I thought it might be jar the

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.600 
thought I thought it might be jar the
other<00:01:06.960> way<00:01:07.110> so<00:01:07.280> it<00:01:08.280> was<00:01:08.549> this<00:01:09.330> one<00:01:09.630> was<00:01:10.610> as

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
other way so it was this one was as

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.940 
other way so it was this one was as
tight<00:01:12.409> as<00:01:13.409> of<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.830> last<00:01:14.189> two<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:15.950> again

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
tight as of the last two and again

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.749 
tight as of the last two and again
Marquez<00:01:17.549> but<00:01:17.790> very<00:01:18.570> bravely<00:01:19.400> again<00:01:20.400> you<00:01:20.549> put

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
Marquez but very bravely again you put

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.580 
Marquez but very bravely again you put
them<00:01:20.909> he<00:01:21.090> put<00:01:21.270> that<00:01:21.299> muscle<00:01:21.840> on<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.200> so<00:01:22.320> forth

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
them he put that muscle on and so forth

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.050 
them he put that muscle on and so forth
and<00:01:22.710> I<00:01:22.830> thought<00:01:23.009> it<00:01:23.159> was<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.430> exchange<00:01:23.759> for

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060
