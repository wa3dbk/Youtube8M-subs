00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:10.750
 I arrived safely in landshut 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:10.750
 there is the cinquecento 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:30.200
 as more and more people eat this sport 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:32.119
 in generally good condition cinquecento 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.130
 his galvanized video maybe knows 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:37.670
 that's why it does not cost as much as that 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:41.930
 predecessor previous owners three previous owners 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:44.110
 and the last one of us the car 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:51.700
 to have 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:53.600
 what is there 90 93 1390 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.690
 experienced a break and for all 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.690
 there 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.460
 see you soon 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:14.909
 on the road in the fiat cinquecento sporting 

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:16.470
 what belongs to sporting equipment 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.350
 rev counter a leather steering wheel 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.140
 sports seats that give an extremely good 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.520
 I do not find the sun great 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.670
 Satisfied because my happy 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.130
 backbone and sometimes the most valuable and 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.020
 the chassis is also sporty it is 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.149
 it is relatively tight, relatively hard 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.159
 you can feel every wave of the find 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:38.280
 some not so great but the checker 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.570
 who says it like athletic to be a good thing 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.640
 really want a little bit on it 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:50.220
 we know what the 54 ps on the parquet 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:52.920
 bring on the 14 percent offers 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.810
 a lot of driving fun as far as he is concerned 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.030
 However, they are not offered 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.270
 sufficient security features none 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:04.220
 airbags no abs the only thing we did 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:06.299
 here are red safety belts and 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.860
 headrests and they are too 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.849
 sensational still around two millimeters 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.849
 height adjustable 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.680
 What I can not understand how you do it 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.320
 an ugly cockpit in so we are 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.870
 here in italy italy talk the country 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.440
 architecture is the land of art and 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.180
 then something 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.350
 It does not look like a car cockpit 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.830
 that looks more like social 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:35.240
 housing construction of the 70s 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:37.430
 eye cancer a pity where a plant 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.110
 should be a sad hole in the gap 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.920
 dashboard there must be the checker 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:44.030
 again singing group can go 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:58.220
 I will accompany myself immediately 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:03:01.400
 maybe something Italian the alu 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:04.370
 rim as standard while the fiat 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.670
 cinquecento sporting nice when you see them 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.440
 Has 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.030
 pretty to look at, however, tells us 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.740
 also a lot about the previous owners and 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.720
 at least one of the gentlemen or of 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.850
 The ladies had to park in front 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.930
 that's why she has some 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:17.980
 gotten scraps 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:20.860
 They had to rims Doctor Ripen 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:23.090
 as good as new 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.590
 the car was with the boys of the 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.170
 Preparation can be seen immediately on 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.550
 front bumper plastic primer 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.690
 was sprayed on it 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:35.720
 That's why it's so fresh and happy 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:38.099
 yes, the paint was processed with 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.900
 the big 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:43.299
 that's why shines too pretty but unfortunately 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.709
 It will be back in two months 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:46.090
 look like this 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:48.310
 Here are the guys with their machines 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.290
 not ran it is still so matthies 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.180
 bread will be back soon is one 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:56.040
 nice color but unfortunately very 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.040
 sensitive to uv radiation 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:03.269
 Rostan brake booster and the 

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:05.500
 associated distributor here behind 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:06.640
 bad that can be leaking and 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.079
 already the traffic safety is not 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.329
 more given than even small cars 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:10.780
 have to brake properly can be clearer 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:13.299
 case 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.670
 at four , the spare parts are not 

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:17.560
 especially expensive but many spare parts 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:20.470
 If I need to go back to sleep 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:23.289
 otherwise it is an honest engine 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:26.440
 no engine wash has experienced so looks 

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:29.820
 the timing belt has been changed 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:33.729
 83,000 332 kilometers in the year 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:35.470
 In 2004, every 80,000 kilometers is the 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:37.449
 timing belt replacement recommended 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:42.699
 we have a little bit for the next one 

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:46.180
 time and a typical fiat disease 

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:50.550
 a feature weakness in the valve cover 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:52.960
 If oil comes out , it looks wonderful here 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:56.680
 they did not manage that 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:59.349
 Colleagues from Italy but something 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:01.630
 Positive still behind it no rust on 

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:04.750
 sheet metal we have here to corrosion and 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:06.460
 there on the engine but the sheet metal is faultless 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:08.560
 okay and the car has no one 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:11.039
 the sign of an accident damage 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:13.660
 good cover 

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:15.490
 further now I still have it east 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:16.900
 discovered in the place where I 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.449
 not I find most 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:21.760
 windshield frame here and at 

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:24.099
 Rubber costs through moisture penetrates 

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:25.870
 where you are in there you get yourself 

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:27.130
 Bad again, this must be on 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:30.280
 all cases are made 

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:32.320
 the tooth of time gnaws stainless 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.400
 einstieg that's good for Italians 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.550
 but once managed to measure the 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:39.180
 cinquecento series from 92 to 98 a car 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:43.770
 to build with the rust is not an issue 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:43.770
 at least not on the body 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:57.210
 the tailgate dampers do their job 

00:05:55.379 --> 00:06:00.599
 no longer serve that regulation 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:02.490
 usually leads to headaches and one 

00:06:00.599 --> 00:06:05.759
 rubber mat no rust replacement wheel 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:09.030
 lift jack bit board tool so needs 

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:16.889
 it shut up monkey dead I do 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:19.370
 grow back my photo grow 

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:19.370
 scrape 

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:27.729
 I have overcome problems 

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:29.139
 but it may be that the 

00:06:27.729 --> 00:06:32.080
 engine does not burn properly it smells 

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:35.740
 a little bit after sprite the colleague what 

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:37.270
 we know who had leak in the tank and 

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:43.629
 the tank is still replaced 

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:44.979
 we'll do it we'll have it good 

00:06:43.629 --> 00:06:48.870
 is such a disease at cinquecento 

00:06:44.979 --> 00:06:54.580
 johnston all three houses are themselves 

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:58.120
 not sure what should cost there again 

00:06:54.580 --> 00:07:00.580
 from 319 negotiating basis of the last 

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:05.940
 word 1400 euro 1200 

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:05.940
 but thanks to that your own pool
