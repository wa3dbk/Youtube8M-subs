00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:28.689
 I'll be up to 34 Tijuana 

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:35.520
 this subtracted kind of music from roma in a fusion between ba protestan 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.010
 street war 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.530
 but we do not have a line this also marked other things is what we are 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.290
 noticing looking because it is what I like to touch to express ourselves this way this 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.550
 source with what we really do 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.480
 azorín took off little material but already possess metapán august also commented 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.410
 I left with the requests of the tragedy 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.040
 but this 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.040
 there we go and I hope you like this song too 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.280
 well, we came up 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.540
 it was the first time 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.290
 we treat everyone 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.680
 we share the stage for those who traveled to california efe 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.310
 a contest that there was in in elementary school 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.200
 on the part of nation challenges 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.760
 in my colleagues back here the surf or yemen they won the second place 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.320
 and then I have not left any place and then 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.890
 they told me that if I wanted to enter with them 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:28.150
 I settled 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.050
 and then here we are 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.050
 and what comes 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.340
 lately what we have done seen the normal of life that we carry either 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.340
 outside the nineteenth exterior human street 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.490
 it draws our attention, for example, as 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.850
 as there are many people who equip despite that 1 lagoon the 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.450
 he says that lucky they express that person to us the opportune that is 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.680
 usa has so much stuff whether material that 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.240
 what but they really are not satisfied we always want more we are always 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.080
 complaining not what we do not have 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.180
 we do not understand because a lot of people do not just do not give thanks 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.670
 so you already have 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.749
 and instead criticizing complaining 

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:12.329
