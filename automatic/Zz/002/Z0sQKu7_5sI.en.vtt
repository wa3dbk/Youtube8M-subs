00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
released a new and improved drop rate

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.920 
released a new and improved drop rate
today<00:00:04.859> for<00:00:05.430> the<00:00:05.609> l1<00:00:05.940> miss<00:00:06.180> bosses<00:00:06.629> on<00:00:06.720> old

update<00:00:09.179> a<00:00:09.360> very<00:00:09.570> long<00:00:09.719> time<00:00:09.929> ago<00:00:10.260> I<00:00:10.530> where<00:00:11.219> they

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
update a very long time ago I where they

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:12.740 
update a very long time ago I where they
brought<00:00:11.639> a<00:00:11.670> bunch<00:00:11.849> of<00:00:11.969> boss<00:00:12.179> is<00:00:12.389> there<00:00:12.570> and<00:00:12.690> a

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
brought a bunch of boss is there and a

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.360 
brought a bunch of boss is there and a
bunch<00:00:12.870> of<00:00:13.019> different<00:00:13.139> things<00:00:13.530> killing<00:00:14.070> things

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
bunch of different things killing things

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.760 
bunch of different things killing things
and<00:00:14.549> all<00:00:14.610> that<00:00:14.759> crap<00:00:14.910> so<00:00:15.809> there<00:00:16.080> is<00:00:16.109> three<00:00:16.529> new

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
and all that crap so there is three new

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.620 
and all that crap so there is three new
introduced<00:00:17.279> rings<00:00:17.580> which<00:00:17.880> technically<00:00:18.420> this

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
introduced rings which technically this

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.560 
introduced rings which technically this
look<00:00:18.840> like<00:00:18.869> the<00:00:19.289> other<00:00:19.320> rings<00:00:19.800> at<00:00:20.039> the<00:00:20.570> decays

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
look like the other rings at the decays

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.450 
look like the other rings at the decays
drop<00:00:21.900> but<00:00:22.109> just<00:00:22.289> kind<00:00:22.710> of<00:00:22.769> more<00:00:22.949> enhanced<00:00:23.369> I

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
drop but just kind of more enhanced I

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.460 
drop but just kind of more enhanced I
guess<00:00:23.640> those<00:00:24.449> new<00:00:24.660> rings<00:00:24.930> are<00:00:25.109> called<00:00:25.350> the

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
guess those new rings are called the

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.040 
guess those new rings are called the
ring<00:00:25.619> of<00:00:25.740> gods<00:00:25.949> i<00:00:26.279> thi<00:00:26.880> ranoco<00:00:27.390> ring<00:00:27.779> now<00:00:27.990> you

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
they have actually improved all the drop

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.100 
they have actually improved all the drop
rates<00:00:44.940> i'm<00:00:45.210> not<00:00:45.329> too<00:00:45.450> sure<00:00:45.480> if<00:00:45.690> they<00:00:45.899> actually

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
rates i'm not too sure if they actually

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.170 
rates i'm not too sure if they actually
like<00:00:46.800> just<00:00:47.070> made<00:00:47.250> them<00:00:47.340> drop<00:00:47.610> new<00:00:47.820> items<00:00:48.059> as

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
like just made them drop new items as

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.729 
like just made them drop new items as
well<00:00:48.210> or<00:00:48.539> just<00:00:48.570> that<00:00:49.050> they<00:00:49.170> could<00:00:49.469> they<00:00:49.620> drop

gaza look at the description but i'll

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:54.860 
gaza look at the description but i'll
read<00:00:53.670> off<00:00:53.789> some<00:00:54.059> of<00:00:54.120> these<00:00:54.180> items<00:00:54.360> that<00:00:54.629> does

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
read off some of these items that does

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.099 
read off some of these items that does
drop<00:00:55.230> so<00:00:56.129> these<00:00:56.250> bosses<00:00:56.489> do<00:00:56.879> drop<00:00:57.360> 200<00:00:57.719> blood

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
drop so these bosses do drop 200 blood

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.310 
drop so these bosses do drop 200 blood
rooms<00:00:58.320> at<00:00:58.590> 250<00:00:59.160> cannonballs<00:00:59.789> they<00:01:00.180> drop<00:01:00.449> 75

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
rooms at 250 cannonballs they drop 75

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.080 
rooms at 250 cannonballs they drop 75
rent<00:01:01.649> dragon<00:01:02.039> heights<00:01:02.219> which<00:01:02.370> is<00:01:02.460> quite<00:01:02.820> a<00:01:02.879> bit

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
rent dragon heights which is quite a bit

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.509 
rent dragon heights which is quite a bit
i<00:01:03.180> believe<00:01:03.449> ancient<00:01:04.320> staff<00:01:04.830> obviously<00:01:05.430> they

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
i believe ancient staff obviously they

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.730 
i believe ancient staff obviously they
drop<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.790> dragon<00:01:06.119> pick<00:01:06.299> ass<00:01:06.479> they<00:01:06.960> drop<00:01:07.200> 60

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
drop the dragon pick ass they drop 60

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.100 
drop the dragon pick ass they drop 60
onyx<00:01:08.220> bolts<00:01:08.520> which<00:01:08.640> is<00:01:08.820> like<00:01:09.090> for<00:01:09.689> us<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:10.049> this

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
onyx bolts which is like for us and this

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.160 
onyx bolts which is like for us and this
is<00:01:10.380> a<00:01:10.820> killing<00:01:11.820> spree<00:01:12.270> they<00:01:12.570> were<00:01:12.750> doing<00:01:12.960> and

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
is a killing spree they were doing and

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.020 
is a killing spree they were doing and
we<00:01:13.680> were<00:01:13.799> killing<00:01:14.100> with<00:01:14.490> four<00:01:14.729> people

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
we were killing with four people

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.850 
we were killing with four people
obviously<00:01:15.150> so<00:01:15.600> if<00:01:15.659> we<00:01:15.810> got<00:01:15.960> something<00:01:16.290> like<00:01:16.439> 60

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
obviously so if we got something like 60

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.039 
obviously so if we got something like 60
onyx<00:01:17.189> bolt<00:01:18.030> this<00:01:18.210> which<00:01:18.390> we<00:01:18.509> added<00:01:18.780> we

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
onyx bolt this which we added we

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.440 
onyx bolt this which we added we
actually<00:01:19.229> did<00:01:19.530> later<00:01:19.710> on<00:01:19.890> we<00:01:20.549> split<00:01:20.820> a<00:01:20.850> 15<00:01:21.240> each

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
actually did later on we split a 15 each

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.210 
actually did later on we split a 15 each
so<00:01:21.630> is<00:01:21.750> that<00:01:21.780> it<00:01:21.930> adds<00:01:22.380> up<00:01:22.650> i<00:01:22.770> guess<00:01:22.950> i<00:01:23.100> mean

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
so is that it adds up i guess i mean

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.890 
so is that it adds up i guess i mean
it's<00:01:23.280> not<00:01:23.549> like<00:01:23.610> a<00:01:23.790> huge<00:01:24.119> drop<00:01:24.360> if<00:01:24.540> you<00:01:24.659> have<00:01:24.780> to

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
it's not like a huge drop if you have to

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.980 
it's not like a huge drop if you have to
split<00:01:25.110> four<00:01:25.590> ways<00:01:25.939> but<00:01:26.939> they're<00:01:27.390> quite<00:01:27.630> common

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
split four ways but they're quite common

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.410 
split four ways but they're quite common
there's<00:01:28.799> 300<00:01:29.340> Oh<00:01:29.460> clings<00:01:29.820> this<00:01:30.119> free

there's 300 Oh clings this free

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.999 
there's 300 Oh clings this free
snapdragons<00:01:31.079> teachers<00:01:31.380> like<00:01:31.530> quite<00:01:31.740> a<00:01:31.770> bit<00:01:31.920> of

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
snapdragons teachers like quite a bit of
