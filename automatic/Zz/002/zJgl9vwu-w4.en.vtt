 in terms of its success 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.409
 but we see that it is very clear even if the site compared to the 36 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:21.690
 world selections 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.200

 m 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.699
 it's a little less 

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:14.059
 it's like that 

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:20.379
 we'll see that little more here to look at another one that's going to be all of 

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:21.019
 after 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:26.409
 bichkek located on the knowledge the complex tissue see like that 

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:27.939
 m

 I'm going to put my exclusion of 1,075 these rights points out this researcher 

00:02:32.749 --> 00:02:35.749

 like that m I'm going to do more 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:46.739
 I am going to set back 1,015 rights on dry lands 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:51.159
 exclusion in negative to create a depth before seeing yourself like that 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.209
 since Thursday night ok 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.689
 that's how my drawers to mobilize 

00:02:57.689 --> 00:02:58.749
 m 

00:02:58.749 --> 00:03:02.579
 one could think of what was bad he severely touches even 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:04.549
 principle 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:05.599
 m 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:07.339
 that's m 

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:10.859
 we could add or know for 100 m 

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:15.669
 small dots but when we see the shock under the driver 

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:18.310
 of the car social facets 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:19.150
 m 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.829
 drawers 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:25.609
 jean-franÃ§ois braun holy city like that 

00:03:26.149 --> 00:03:27.669
 m 

00:03:27.669 --> 00:03:31.130
 we take our site is the small bucket the Phocean 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:37.680
 worst we will go 3 it is a short rest it's a little our selection like that 

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:39.879
 m 

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:45.229
 in front of the situation that's why our site I would like for my wife 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:49.549
 one of his clients over two centuries like that 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:54.139
 by making of them and the exclusion one reaches a brake everything is possible 

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:57.059
 producers from here just below 

00:03:57.059 --> 00:04:00.439
 after selecting on each product 

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:03.819
 m 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:05.370
 your choice 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.299
 for exclusion m 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:08.850
 like that 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:10.279
 and we are at the point 

00:04:10.279 --> 00:04:11.670
 we could read 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.819
 sports people workers taking our site has a border 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:23.610
 and going from pc even though for me and six m eric schmidt 

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:26.199
 m 

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:30.529
 om who are a little more worked like that so that's it we do a 

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:35.910
 good little building good point also detached these kings this office is 

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:38.159
 question of being able to animate them 

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:40.650
 but we will start from its object and margins 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:41.590
 m 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.010
 m and that I have here 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:50.330
 good to know that I can for the church we see th m to read it 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:56.270
 so I do not select to differentiate you from the cfa institute assets I 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.529
 can call it bravo 

00:04:58.529 --> 00:04:59.719
 here 

00:04:59.719 --> 00:05:04.120
 yes but not if I get out of my office stock let me dream tomorrow a 

00:05:04.119 --> 00:05:07.339
 jm object 

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:10.149
 from its pivot point it's a bit new in terms of keeping the 

00:05:10.149 --> 00:05:12.699
 control of his troops these buildings 

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:17.610
 so I could select my drawer the back row numbers 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:20.760
 the spring festival or the summer we are especially worried 

00:05:21.689 --> 00:05:25.969
 when its release in europe at that time in 2008 ederson practically 

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:30.709
 zero with his own account and for good sense the balanced I want 

00:05:30.709 --> 00:05:32.990
 tour 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:35.400
 and flies 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.130
 I think of the little animation with his bedside it is this prototype m 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:42.270
 I react to the trees 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:43.060
 m 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:47.690
 at the end of carrara said that I wanted to do something like that we have full 

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:50.150
 small animations of an office 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:53.520
 with a choice that suffer 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.979
 obviously the chicken leaves something to be desired 

00:05:56.979 --> 00:06:00.449
 we had done the hard part it could look like a site 

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:02.830
 m 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:04.840
 m
