fills up with dirt and dust and crap

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.490 
fills up with dirt and dust and crap
inside<00:01:30.090> there<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:30.600> you<00:01:30.990> have<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.200> clean<00:01:31.380> it

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
inside there and you have to clean it

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.050 
inside there and you have to clean it
out<00:01:31.530> with<00:01:31.680> water<00:01:31.710> every<00:01:32.159> once<00:01:32.340> in<00:01:32.460> a<00:01:32.520> while<00:01:32.640> but

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
out with water every once in a while but

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.080 
out with water every once in a while but
otherwise<00:01:33.869> it's<00:01:34.590> pretty<00:01:34.829> good<00:01:34.979> case<00:01:35.189> even<00:01:36.030> I

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
otherwise it's pretty good case even I

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.690 
otherwise it's pretty good case even I
could<00:01:36.270> same<00:01:36.390> it<00:01:36.509> down<00:01:36.659> here<00:01:36.900> by<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.700> charging

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
could same it down here by the charging

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.850 
could same it down here by the charging
port<00:01:38.880> that<00:01:39.119> you<00:01:39.180> just<00:01:39.329> snap<00:01:39.659> open<00:01:39.900> so<00:01:40.710> it's

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
port that you just snap open so it's

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.190 
port that you just snap open so it's
waterproof<00:01:41.130> there<00:01:41.520> then<00:01:41.729> they<00:01:41.820> have<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:41.939> little

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
waterproof there then they have a little

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.940 
waterproof there then they have a little
