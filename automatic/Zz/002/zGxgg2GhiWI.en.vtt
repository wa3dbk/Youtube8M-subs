00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
three liquid guys I don't know I haven't

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:31.640 
three liquid guys I don't know I haven't
seen<00:02:30.450> them<00:02:30.510> play<00:02:30.630> in<00:02:30.750> a<00:02:30.810> while<00:02:30.960> obviously

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
seen them play in a while obviously

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:32.630 
seen them play in a while obviously
they've<00:02:31.770> been<00:02:31.950> getting<00:02:32.040> good<00:02:32.220> practice<00:02:32.520> with

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
they've been getting good practice with

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.000 
they've been getting good practice with
OGS<00:02:33.060> and<00:02:33.360> everyone<00:02:33.990> else<00:02:34.140> but<00:02:34.410> they<00:02:34.830> did

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
OGS and everyone else but they did

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.790 
OGS and everyone else but they did
haven't<00:02:35.340> really<00:02:35.490> posted<00:02:35.610> great<00:02:36.270> results<00:02:36.800> yet

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
haven't really posted great results yet

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.740 
haven't really posted great results yet
so<00:02:38.280> hopefully<00:02:39.090> they<00:02:39.360> make<00:02:39.450> it<00:02:39.600> a<00:02:39.630> little

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
so hopefully they make it a little

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.290 
so hopefully they make it a little
general<00:02:40.110> transformation<00:02:40.380> and<00:02:40.860> go<00:02:41.850> really<00:02:42.060> far

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
general transformation and go really far

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.270 
general transformation and go really far
but<00:02:42.660> we'll<00:02:42.780> see<00:02:42.930> yeah<00:02:43.440> I<00:02:43.470> know<00:02:43.560> that<00:02:43.800> would<00:02:43.950> be

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
but we'll see yeah I know that would be

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.530 
but we'll see yeah I know that would be
quite<00:02:44.580> awesome<00:02:44.700> we<00:02:44.940> get<00:02:45.030> a<00:02:45.090> whole<00:02:45.270> bunch<00:02:45.300> of

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
quite awesome we get a whole bunch of

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.420 
quite awesome we get a whole bunch of
foreigners<00:02:45.780> in<00:02:45.990> the<00:02:46.050> code<00:02:46.230> s<00:02:46.380> and<00:02:46.710> that

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
foreigners in the code s and that

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.490 
foreigners in the code s and that
wouldn't<00:02:47.700> that<00:02:48.060> is<00:02:48.210> my<00:02:48.390> dream<00:02:48.450> torch<00:02:49.200> that's

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
I intended to do as much as I possibly

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.560 
I intended to do as much as I possibly
can<00:03:25.230> in<00:03:25.380> practice<00:03:25.740> wise<00:03:25.890> up<00:03:26.280> until<00:03:26.700> MLG<00:03:27.360> and

then<00:03:28.290> I'm<00:03:28.650> going<00:03:29.370> to<00:03:29.400> need<00:03:29.550> to<00:03:29.670> re-evaluate<00:03:29.880> at

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
then I'm going to need to re-evaluate at

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:31.880 
then I'm going to need to re-evaluate at
that<00:03:30.450> point<00:03:30.690> whether<00:03:31.080> or<00:03:31.200> not<00:03:31.290> it<00:03:31.560> makes<00:03:31.590> sense

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
that point whether or not it makes sense

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.890 
that point whether or not it makes sense
for<00:03:32.070> me<00:03:32.160> to<00:03:32.190> keep<00:03:32.400> playing<00:03:32.430> or<00:03:32.940> if<00:03:33.600> I<00:03:33.660> should<00:03:33.690> be

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
for me to keep playing or if I should be

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.400 
for me to keep playing or if I should be
assisting<00:03:34.320> in<00:03:34.440> other<00:03:34.710> roles<00:03:35.930> yeah<00:03:36.930> no<00:03:37.230> I<00:03:37.260> mean
