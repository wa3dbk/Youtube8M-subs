 similar in Natal Gerald wanted to take him away from the bench to take the 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.120
 car two years later there's this traumatized 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.180
 it was the place and the family that wanted it on the canal is the concept that is not the opinion 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.540
 I searched

 need to move the squad to fight against the fortis bench you have to pull a 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.650

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:00.630
 just the finger on the ring the mechanism drives a spring that pulls ball to 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:04.470
 inside and holds the finger according to the Brazilian consumer association 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.470
 adopted 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.450
 for volkswagen from Brazil already my clients to repair the supposed failure of 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:12.320
 project 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.510
 sporting is exported to europe has a different system 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:17.910
 everything to rebate the bank 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:19.800
 in place of absence of ball 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.760
 to a Christmas lever parallel to the base in note the company says that the folding

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.680
 of the owner also says he regrets the accidents but in their assessment they 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.580
 occurred due to inattention, this specialist disagrees with 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.300

 Gustavo filed a lawsuit against the car assembler 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.289

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:05.860
