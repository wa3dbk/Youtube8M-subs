00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
large writing this could all be

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
large writing this could all be
condensed<00:02:51.320> into<00:02:51.380> a<00:02:52.010> third<00:02:52.700> of<00:02:52.910> this<00:02:53.060> size<00:02:53.800> but

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
condensed into a third of this size but

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.979 
condensed into a third of this size but
instead<00:02:55.220> he's<00:02:55.730> in<00:02:56.270> my<00:02:56.480> opinion<00:02:56.840> this<00:02:56.930> is

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
instead he's in my opinion this is

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:00.400 
instead he's in my opinion this is
padded<00:02:57.500> out<00:02:57.620> way<00:02:58.370> too<00:02:58.430> much<00:02:58.900> to<00:02:59.900> try<00:03:00.110> and<00:03:00.260> make

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
padded out way too much to try and make

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.590 
padded out way too much to try and make
it<00:03:00.560> look<00:03:00.800> like<00:03:00.860> it's<00:03:01.190> worth<00:03:01.400> 29.95

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
it look like it's worth 29.95

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.340 
it look like it's worth 29.95
the<00:03:03.260> actual<00:03:03.530> information<00:03:03.709> this<00:03:04.610> one<00:03:04.850> here<00:03:05.060> is

the actual information this one here is

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:10.720

module<00:03:06.350> six<00:03:07.570> again<00:03:08.570> you've<00:03:08.989> got<00:03:09.160> on<00:03:10.160> the<00:03:10.550> left

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
module six again you've got on the left

module six again you've got on the left
hand<00:03:10.880> side<00:03:11.150> completely<00:03:11.660> blank<00:03:11.959> I<00:03:12.260> look<00:03:12.800> at<00:03:12.890> the

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
hand side completely blank I look at the

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.860 
hand side completely blank I look at the
size<00:03:13.220> of<00:03:13.310> this<00:03:13.430> writing<00:03:13.730> and<00:03:14.060> that's<00:03:14.630> just

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
size of this writing and that's just

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.770 
size of this writing and that's just
ridiculous<00:03:16.090> let's<00:03:17.090> just<00:03:17.269> it's<00:03:17.450> just<00:03:17.600> taking

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
ridiculous let's just it's just taking

ridiculous let's just it's just taking
up<00:03:17.840> the<00:03:17.900> whole<00:03:18.049> page<00:03:19.690> again<00:03:21.310> your<00:03:22.310> space<00:03:22.760> they

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
up the whole page again your space they

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.479 
up the whole page again your space they
got<00:03:23.180> whitespace<00:03:23.660> everywhere<00:03:24.220> now<00:03:25.220> when<00:03:25.370> I've

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
got whitespace everywhere now when I've

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:27.009 
got whitespace everywhere now when I've
got<00:03:25.850> this<00:03:26.060> course<00:03:26.299> a<00:03:26.450> couple<00:03:26.660> of<00:03:26.750> years<00:03:26.810> ago

got this course a couple of years ago

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:30.670 
got this course a couple of years ago
just<00:03:27.410> images<00:03:28.010> massive<00:03:28.700> images<00:03:29.500> and<00:03:30.500> this

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
just images massive images and this

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.640 
just images massive images and this
again<00:03:31.040> is<00:03:31.870> you<00:03:32.870> know<00:03:32.959> you<00:03:33.019> think<00:03:33.290> it's<00:03:33.410> quite

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
again is you know you think it's quite

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.280 
again is you know you think it's quite
substantial<00:03:33.880> and<00:03:34.880> repay<00:03:35.209> jizz<00:03:35.420> but<00:03:36.080> in<00:03:36.170> fact

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
substantial and repay jizz but in fact

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.440 
substantial and repay jizz but in fact
is<00:03:36.440> just<00:03:36.560> fifty<00:03:36.890> pages<00:03:37.100> of<00:03:37.280> writing<00:03:37.430> much<00:03:38.269> of

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:41.110 
and there I'm not gonna knock that but
that<00:04:38.940> though<00:04:39.180> those<00:04:39.630> nine<00:04:39.840> modules<00:04:40.080> cost<00:04:40.500> me

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
that though those nine modules cost me

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.490 
that though those nine modules cost me

pounds and I think is ridiculous that

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.680 
pounds and I think is ridiculous that

could been condensed into two manuals or

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:50.240 
could been condensed into two manuals or
just<00:04:48.900> all<00:04:49.020> that<00:04:49.200> light<00:04:49.350> itself<00:04:49.650> two<00:04:49.920> manuals

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.250 
just all that light itself two manuals

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:51.080 
just all that light itself two manuals
no<00:04:50.490> more<00:04:50.670> than<00:04:50.760> that

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090 
no more than that

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.240 
no more than that
and<00:04:51.630> in<00:04:51.990> terms<00:04:52.170> of<00:04:52.380> the<00:04:52.530> you<00:04:52.710> know<00:04:52.740> the<00:04:52.830> value

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
and in terms of the you know the value

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.040 
and in terms of the you know the value
of<00:04:53.280> it<00:04:53.460> yeah<00:04:53.760> sure<00:04:54.030> you<00:04:54.180> might<00:04:54.210> say<00:04:54.570> okay<00:04:54.900> it's

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
of it yeah sure you might say okay it's

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.050 
of it yeah sure you might say okay it's
worth<00:04:55.230> a<00:04:55.530> lot<00:04:56.010> more<00:04:56.070> because<00:04:56.490> given<00:04:56.850> your<00:04:56.940> way

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
worth a lot more because given your way
