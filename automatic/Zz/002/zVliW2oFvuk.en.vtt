 first via orazio 73 napoli 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:58.830
 in 2001 mv augusta decided to browse 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:01.200
 of the hulls the f4 of 1998 that from 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:03.480
 it is always the most loved bike in the world 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.729
 the choice was guessed because in these 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.400
 12 years of history what came of it 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.460
 outside, that is, the brutal has done nothing else 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.500
 that collect successes and consents and the 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.840
 more beautiful, more innovative naked 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.240
 never been conceived and with every restyling 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.850
 does nothing but reconfirm his own 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.190
 statement last November in Milan 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.130
 then at the motorcycle show 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:28.649
 mv presented the latest version of the 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.930
 brutal the 800 that we have today in trial 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:34.320
 thanks to the coward for caserta and province 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:37.380
 bike harness the brutal 800 arises 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.600
 among the 6 7 5 versions with which the accompany 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.259
 frame the derived engines in turn 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:47.130
 from f3 and the most powerful 929 90 a 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:49.170
 1,078 and 1090 in short, there is something for all 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.840
 tastes but from the first impressions it is 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.640
 immediately realized that the 800 can be the 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.040
 right compromise for those who love 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.100
 the exclusivity of the brutal associated with 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.689
 versatile driving characteristics e 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.150
 performance this way surprised me 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.869
 an impressive 800 is something 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.120
 to try 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.580
 I expected 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.260
 a rather quieter fashion instead 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.960
 I enjoyed it so much today in 

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:15.230
 circuit here animals as mentioned on 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:18.510
 engine is the now famous 3-cylinder 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.950
 already equipped on the 675 in turn 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.990
 born for the f 3 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.630
 only the piston rods and the shaft change 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:26.670
 engine to get the volume of 800 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.100
 cubic centimeters that allow you to 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:32.370
 reach a full 125 horsepower 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:35.490
 declared and a torque peak of 8 kg 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.680
 three already in October on the track here in 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.840
 limatola, however, could be enjoyed 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.940
 this important power we would have 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.430
 wanted maybe a little more progressive 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.830
 the braille by wire accelerator indeed 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.750
 gives undeniable advantages but it is necessary 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.900
 get used to its use not really 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:54.300
 immediate 4 mappings and eight levels 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.340
 of traction control refer to 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.830
 considerable electronic management of the 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.420
 eldor control unit offering maps already 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.060
 configured and a single from 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.820
 always customize one of the points 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:08.820
 strong of the mv agusta and also in the 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:11.340
 so brutal is the chassis that also 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:13.350
 on the 800 it is composed primarily of the 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.450
 beautiful frame formed by one 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.190
 central truss structure and from 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.090
 plates that harpoon the single arm 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.070
 rear 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.650
 the engine obviously acts as an element 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:24.090
 carrier and help the complex 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.790
 handling of the bike 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.880
 the fork is a marzocchi with stems from 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:32.430
 Fully adjustable 43 mm diameter 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:35.520
 at the rear was placed mono sachs 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:37.560
 also fully adjustable the 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.100
 800 really something more than the 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.440
 others 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.000
 indeed today 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.340
 if we are going to compare them with the others 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.870
 naked let's say that it was by no means a 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.360
 product that is a little above 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.250
 all for the neophytes I would not say not so much 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.510
 because the bike that I repeat is 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.790
 releases so much power 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:56.230
 in case here it is bmw did well to 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:58.310
 begin to propose the 6 7 5 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.730
 let's say the 800 takes a long time 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.730
 handle 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:25.630
 to see it from the brutal 800 as it stops 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.760
 I also said in the beginning confirmation of 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.050
 be the most fascinating nude ever 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.300
 realized 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:34.090
 and it would be enough simply to have it down in 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:36.820
 garage to be gratified knowing of 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:38.620
 have an exceptional product but yes 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:40.030
 can have more because once a 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.820
 board realizes to be 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.720
 completely inserted in the bike and of 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:45.550
 be part of it 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.740
 looking forward to the time of 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:50.080
 start the engine and also use the 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:52.750
 characteristic interviews between these goes 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.910
 cited above all entrusted braking 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:58.180
 obviously in Bremen which provides for the 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:05:00.280
 brutal 800 two 320 front disks 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.710
 mm and a radial caliper with four 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:06.370
 pistons while at the rear there is a 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:07.630
 220 mm disc and two-piston caliper 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:09.190
 the braking force is in fact 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:11.920
 impressive but at the same time 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:13.750
 adjustable and studying brakes and 

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:16.840
 also associated with the reduced weight of the 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:18.940
 motorcycle that just 167 kg 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:21.850
 driving becomes intuitive and simple 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:24.370
 from the first turns even on the track of the 

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:25.810
 twenty I have not found the engine in the 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:28.330
 change you need to open a little bit 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:30.760
 the right place to go and change there 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.960
 you have to be very precise and the only one 

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:35.770
 black 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:39.490
 prices start at 9,990 euros up to 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:41.740
 ten 1990s of the Italian version and the 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:43.540
 motorcycle is available to be tested 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.940
 at the dealer for caserta and province 

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:47.500
 bike borrozzino that you will find precisely a 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:49.890
 santa maria capua vetere in the province of 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:52.300
 caserta in the hands of public Romans 

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:54.460
 we thank the local dealer 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:58.940
 rail station that gave us the chance 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:06:02.180
 today to try the 800 really 

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:03.890
 thank you and then follow us because 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.249
 in the next episodes 

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:06.899
 we will make you 

00:06:05.249 --> 00:06:09.949
 can also see the new f 

00:06:06.899 --> 00:06:09.949
