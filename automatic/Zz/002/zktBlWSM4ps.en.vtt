00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:05.080
 very good girls very good guys 

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:06.910
 indiscreet and we are in a news of 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:10.269
 big photo 5 and it is that has been found 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:13.749
 a solution to play gta 5 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:17.020
 installing the two discs on xbox 360 and 

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:19.570
 so we can solve the 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:22.870
 problems of both popping and the 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:26.140
 that exist in big picture 5 then when 

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:28.090
 we installed the two discs in our 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.890
 console in the xbox of 60 remember that 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.439
 comes in two dvds 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:35.440
 rockstar already warned that the version of xbox 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:37.630
 of 60 you just have to install one of 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.690
 the two discs that come inside 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:44.079
 the box since paradoxically install 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:46.480
 both discs would reduce performance 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:48.520
 of the game so remember that you had to 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.680
 extract the disk that was mandatory and 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.360
 the game disc that I know always 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.090
 we have inside because I did not have to 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.380
 settle down remember that a xbox 360 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.840
 have the option to install the game 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.750
 so that you do not force the lens so much 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.300
 well, good 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.010
 if we still want to install the two 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.050
 discs to enjoy this 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.570
 title without forcing the lens of the console 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.970
 of the xbox 360 which I always 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.220
 I recommend the guys from digital foundry 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.220
 have discovered that we can install the 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:20.460
 dvd pointing to play 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.740
 on a USB device doing so 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.390
 does not affect the performance on videos 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.940
 what's in the description are shown 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.410
 the problems of installing the 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.080
 game disc on the hard drive of the 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:34.590
 console and another when we install it in 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:36.600
 an external usb inserted in the 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.310
 console in this in the two videos 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.350
 comparative shows that there is no 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.920
 performance differences playing from 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.790
 the hard drive of the console or play it 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.460
 having it installed from a 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.229
 USB storage device 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.460
 that there is no problem like that 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.369
 that this is the solution they have 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:56.880
 So far found do not think 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:58.800
 star rock star then make a 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.020
 update but good I hope to know 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.729
 it has helped us and you know how it always 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.410
 leave your like and favorite and we 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.410
 we see in the next one
