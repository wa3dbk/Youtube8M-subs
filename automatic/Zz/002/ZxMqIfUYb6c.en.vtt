may come in handy here's a default seen
in<00:00:17.670> blender<00:00:18.320> 2.5<00:00:19.320> will<00:00:19.740> delete<00:00:20.070> this<00:00:20.340> cube<00:00:20.760> and

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
in blender 2.5 will delete this cube and

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.970 
in blender 2.5 will delete this cube and
you<00:00:21.359> can<00:00:21.480> see<00:00:21.689> that<00:00:21.990> little<00:00:22.230> crosshair<00:00:22.769> right

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
you can see that little crosshair right

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.849 
you can see that little crosshair right
there<00:00:23.279> and<00:00:23.850> that<00:00:24.000> is<00:00:24.210> your<00:00:24.539> 3d<00:00:25.109> cursor<00:00:25.380> and

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
there and that is your 3d cursor and

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.400 
there and that is your 3d cursor and
whenever<00:00:26.430> you<00:00:26.609> add<00:00:26.849> an<00:00:27.150> object<00:00:27.330> and<00:00:28.050> we'll

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
whenever you add an object and we'll

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.609 
whenever you add an object and we'll
just<00:00:28.619> add<00:00:28.830> a<00:00:28.859> sphere<00:00:29.699> here

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:30.619 
just add a sphere here

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:33.380 
just add a sphere here
it<00:00:31.619> adds<00:00:31.830> wherever<00:00:32.309> that<00:00:32.430> 3d<00:00:32.700> cursor<00:00:32.880> is<00:00:33.149> and

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
it adds wherever that 3d cursor is and

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.030 
it adds wherever that 3d cursor is and
if<00:00:33.750> you<00:00:33.870> left<00:00:34.050> click<00:00:34.260> somewhere<00:00:34.559> you<00:00:34.739> see<00:00:34.920> you

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
if you left click somewhere you see you

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.430 
if you left click somewhere you see you
can<00:00:35.190> move<00:00:35.460> that<00:00:36.030> cursor<00:00:36.270> will<00:00:37.140> have<00:00:37.260> another

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
can move that cursor will have another

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.190 
can move that cursor will have another
sphere<00:00:37.890> there<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:39.239> another<00:00:39.570> sphere<00:00:39.930> there

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
sphere there and another sphere there

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.209 
sphere there and another sphere there
now

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
now

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.810 
now
I<00:00:41.250> have<00:00:41.879> on<00:00:42.329> a<00:00:42.390> number<00:00:43.020> of<00:00:43.050> occasions

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 
I have on a number of occasions

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.510 
I have on a number of occasions
accidentally<00:00:44.820> move<00:00:45.570> that<00:00:45.930> cursor<00:00:46.520> somewhere

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
accidentally move that cursor somewhere

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.369 
accidentally move that cursor somewhere
usually<00:00:48.180> when<00:00:48.450> I'm<00:00:48.510> trying<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:48.899> split<00:00:49.289> the

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
usually when I'm trying to split the

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:50.510 
usually when I'm trying to split the
screen<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:49.829> I<00:00:49.860> don't<00:00:49.920> go<00:00:50.129> all<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.309> way<00:00:50.340> up<00:00:50.430> to

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
screen and I don't go all the way up to

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.920 
screen and I don't go all the way up to
the<00:00:50.610> corner<00:00:50.730> I<00:00:50.879> end<00:00:51.000> up<00:00:51.120> throwing<00:00:51.449> it<00:00:51.629> up<00:00:51.690> there

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
the corner I end up throwing it up there

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.639 
the corner I end up throwing it up there
somewhere<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:53.750> that<00:00:54.750> kind<00:00:55.199> of<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.320> pain<00:00:55.469> in<00:00:55.559> the

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
somewhere and that kind of a pain in the

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.380 
somewhere and that kind of a pain in the
butt<00:00:55.829> you<00:00:56.579> know<00:00:56.670> if<00:00:56.850> you're<00:00:56.969> trying<00:00:57.059> to<00:00:57.180> line

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
butt you know if you're trying to line

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.639 
butt you know if you're trying to line
things<00:00:57.660> up<00:00:57.960> you're<00:00:59.120> you<00:01:00.120> know<00:01:00.410> trying<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.469> get

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
things up you're you know trying to get

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.290 
things up you're you know trying to get
it<00:01:01.739> right<00:01:01.980> back<00:01:02.309> in<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.670> center<00:01:02.940> but<00:01:03.239> you

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
it right back in the center but you

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.880 
it right back in the center but you
never<00:01:03.510> get<00:01:03.780> it<00:01:03.930> perfect<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:04.650> you<00:01:04.710> gotta

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
never get it perfect and you gotta

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.380 
never get it perfect and you gotta
remember<00:01:04.979> you're<00:01:05.189> working<00:01:05.460> in<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:05.640> 3d<00:01:05.939> world<00:01:06.150> so

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
remember you're working in a 3d world so

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.670 
remember you're working in a 3d world so
if<00:01:06.479> I<00:01:06.570> go<00:01:06.689> in<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.869> side<00:01:07.049> view<00:01:07.200> here<00:01:07.260> you<00:01:07.530> see

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
if I go in the side view here you see

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:08.960 
if I go in the side view here you see
it's<00:01:07.799> still<00:01:08.010> not<00:01:08.040> since<00:01:08.430> you<00:01:08.520> got<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:08.760> come

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
it's still not since you got to come

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.719 
it's still not since you got to come
down<00:01:09.000> here<00:01:09.510> so<00:01:09.689> how<00:01:10.500> can<00:01:10.560> we<00:01:10.830> get<00:01:11.010> that<00:01:11.250> 3d

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
down here so how can we get that 3d

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.499 
down here so how can we get that 3d
cursor<00:01:12.510> back<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.619> center<00:01:14.119> it's<00:01:15.119> simple

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
cursor back to the center it's simple

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.160 
cursor back to the center it's simple
just<00:01:15.689> hit<00:01:16.400> shift<00:01:17.400> s<00:01:17.640> you<00:01:18.570> have<00:01:18.720> some<00:01:18.960> options

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
just hit shift s you have some options

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.600 
just hit shift s you have some options
here<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.180> cursor<00:01:21.180> to<00:01:21.780> Center

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
here and cursor to Center

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.690 
here and cursor to Center
boom<00:01:23.610> it's<00:01:23.909> sent<00:01:24.210> to<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.330> center<00:01:25.400> and<00:01:26.400> at<00:01:26.549> this

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
boom it's sent to the center and at this

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.469 
boom it's sent to the center and at this
point<00:01:26.990> we<00:01:27.990> can<00:01:28.229> add<00:01:28.439> a<00:01:28.920> sphere<00:01:29.460> there<00:01:29.729> now

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
point we can add a sphere there now

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.410 
point we can add a sphere there now
let's<00:01:31.439> say<00:01:31.710> you<00:01:31.770> did<00:01:32.340> have<00:01:32.610> a<00:01:32.640> sphere<00:01:33.210> over

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
let's say you did have a sphere over

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.080 
let's say you did have a sphere over
here<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:33.869> you<00:01:33.990> want<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:34.470> add<00:01:34.710> a<00:01:35.189> cube<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:35.970> you

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
here and you want to add a cube and you

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.960 
here and you want to add a cube and you
wanted<00:01:36.360> it<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.479> line<00:01:36.840> up<00:01:37.079> exactly<00:01:37.829> in<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.700> same

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
wanted it to line up exactly in the same

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.350 
wanted it to line up exactly in the same
Center<00:01:39.509> as<00:01:39.659> that<00:01:40.320> sphere<00:01:40.920> well<00:01:41.549> we<00:01:41.970> can<00:01:42.180> hit

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
Center as that sphere well we can hit

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.620 
Center as that sphere well we can hit
shift<00:01:42.570> S<00:01:43.290> and<00:01:43.860> you<00:01:44.310> can<00:01:44.430> see<00:01:44.670> there's<00:01:44.909> a<00:01:45.030> cursor

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
shift S and you can see there's a cursor

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.380 
shift S and you can see there's a cursor
to<00:01:45.899> selected<00:01:46.500> we'll<00:01:47.130> click<00:01:47.310> that<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:47.759> now<00:01:47.790> the

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
to selected we'll click that and now the

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.899 
to selected we'll click that and now the
cursor<00:01:48.780> is<00:01:48.960> centered<00:01:49.350> there<00:01:49.590> I<00:01:49.799> can<00:01:50.369> add<00:01:50.640> a

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
cursor is centered there I can add a

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.120 
cursor is centered there I can add a
cube<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:51.899> you<00:01:52.350> can<00:01:52.500> see<00:01:52.710> it's<00:01:52.890> exactly

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
cube and you can see it's exactly

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.999 
cube and you can see it's exactly
centered<00:01:54.030> around<00:01:54.240> that<00:01:54.570> sphere<00:01:55.229> so<00:01:55.829> that's

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
centered around that sphere so that's

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.389 
centered around that sphere so that's
moving<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.549> 3d<00:01:56.909> cursor<00:01:57.119> in<00:01:57.509> blender<00:01:58.100> 2.5

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
moving the 3d cursor in blender 2.5

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.340 
moving the 3d cursor in blender 2.5
I<00:01:59.850> believe<00:02:00.420> you<00:02:00.540> can<00:02:00.630> do<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:00.780> same<00:02:00.960> thing<00:02:01.229> in

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
I believe you can do the same thing in

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.440 
I believe you can do the same thing in
2.4<00:02:02.040> give<00:02:02.219> it<00:02:02.310> a<00:02:02.340> try<00:02:02.520> comment<00:02:03.030> if<00:02:03.119> it<00:02:03.210> doesn't

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
2.4 give it a try comment if it doesn't
