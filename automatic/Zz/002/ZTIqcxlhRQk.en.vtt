00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:13.339
 the energy to undertake the desire to create is what drove a couple 

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:16.339
 to embark on the adventure of a restaurant in app 

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:21.499
 created in 2006 remains there is a company based in paris and which 

00:00:21.499 --> 00:00:25.539
 today has 50 employees the concept best wine allows to order at 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:29.230
 home or office dishes listed on the map of different restaurants 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:30.029
 Parisian 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.820
 with restoring the restaurant does not come to you so how does it work 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.730
 demonstration we are now at the call center of the company 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.730
 we make a mention with his big comeback Saturday 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.960
 Michel Boyon and the former PQ leader 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.820
 they will work 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.650
 once again his image 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.650
 I sent thanks to you now for having a sister 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.390
 at the head of this society a clement beneath man and woman and then the 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:57.480
 planet 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.690
 it's 9 o'clock in the morning they're already both on the bridge with a 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.640
 turnover of 3 and a half million euros resto it is in full 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.640
 development and it's not a coincidence 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.420
 which gave me the energy to undertake 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.320
 I think in my opinion are at stake I always wanted to create a 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.439
 business and when I really had an idea that pleased me 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.420
 so the concept of staying 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.780
 % and I started Saturday at these facts in a natural way as I 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.960
 you said it just now chaos activities located 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.240
 in the basement 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.540
 so I showed you how it's going 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.540
 c 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.290
 a dozen people 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:34.800
 cream of orders 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.810
 So the clichÃ© with Iran 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.380
 order taking 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.380
 until the change of command restaurant 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.500
 drawn by is native the average age is around 25 years old put on 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.820
 on youth the new services are associated with young people and 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.490
 dynamic 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.850
 in constant euros absolutely no age-related barrier one is 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.540
 credible anyway by dropping on something beautiful to the 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:00.980
 generation to which they belong 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:02.750
 because contrary to popular belief 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.130
 for 45 minutes 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.320
 it happens there 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.569
 thomas pouzin 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:09.580
 in may but his head 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:15.780
 very she knew how to do the repair is not far so we went to see the 15 the 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:16.700
 restaurateur 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.110
 to offer them the concept we started in 40 square meters 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.330
 the three salons for the anecdote at abdelhak the reactors in arizona but 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:26.290
 wrongly 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.180
 dada la falaise here we went on red alert 

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:34.259
 - so what's up 

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:37.219
 nice yule has an appointment at one of the restaurateurs listed on the 

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:40.079
 map of human remains and this is a momentous moment for the quarters 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:43.309
 today he will discover the new catalog remains one of the figures 

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:47.509
 apparently he is happy 

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:50.859
 in the loire gilles clement to arrive what equates his concept of 

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:51.460
 quality 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.460
 it seduced me I was able 

00:02:56.279 --> 00:03:00.829
 let's pass apple do not deteriorate because of the product image and 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:02.920
 teaching nobody has not renewed 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.920
 and so much to test various places in the city of Europe by beating zahar 

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:10.319
 but while clement joly commercial while highly concentrated 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:13.319
 out of the 50 company employees return to the locker room 

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:17.329
 we find Clement who continues his marathon he now has appointment 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:20.599
 with the boss of a box that uses his services by the onf 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:21.859
 then after the track 

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:24.419
 particles per million 

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:26.289
 85 'and in this respect 

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:29.439
 in the instructions it was especially the most reliable given the deadlines of 

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:32.609
 delivery and the one that offered mostly the largest restaurant park in 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:35.199
 progression of 43 countries 

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:36.519
 the global wrapped 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:37.840
 we presented a budget 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.440
 for a company I do not see how they are emerging countries 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.499
 that a cool thing 

00:03:41.499 --> 00:03:44.409
 because they have a quality 

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:46.219
 the rating activity 

00:03:46.219 --> 00:03:48.509
 passionate who goes with 

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:52.239
 and the pizza so he just satisfies his customers that's the rule 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:55.329
 gold for clement and pilar and for now it works the work paid 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:59.199
 we had a lot of difficult moments and we will persevere and persevere 

00:03:59.199 --> 00:04:00.109
 persevere 

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:02.060
 we will work 7 days a week 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.060
 since the creation of the structure to get there 

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:09.340
 we met christine pujol president of the trade union and 

00:04:09.339 --> 00:04:12.059
 of hospitality industries she knows how much this sector of lack of 

00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:13.150
 serious and hard working 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.379
 hence the merit of staying real 

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:18.430
 it's still very difficult to get funding 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.810
 for our small businesses there is a potential of young people who are 

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:28.270
 pre to take back these small businesses including us 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:34.719
 of all these young people who come out of the training in the care the crp well even 

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:37.429
 who have already been examined experience within the trades 

00:04:37.429 --> 00:04:39.550
 associates it's still 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.470
 film and AIDS services is conviviality it's also about 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.550
 consulting services and this is where she puts herself at the service of people
