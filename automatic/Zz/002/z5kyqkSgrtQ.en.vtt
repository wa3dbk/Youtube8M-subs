 Good menu then the dessert so 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.060
 let's make a dessert very fast and there 

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:27.920
 more delicious we go on a cake 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.630
 plums the first thing we are going to do is 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:34.210
 the base for the cake we are going to put 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:36.190
 flour we are going to add sugar and salt 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.980
 mix all the dry and the next 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.570
 step let's put keel on the 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.750
 moment we get to have that 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:46.180
 slightly sandy texture good is the 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:49.360
 ideal time to add a bit of 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:52.269
 continuous water mixing the dough begins 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.730
 to take shape the butter fat 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:57.210
 begins to mix and merges with the 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.210
 wheat flour 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.880
 and now we only have to stretch it 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.909
 with the roller what's different is that we're going 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.860
 face using an aromatic herb that 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:14.259
 It is normally used for cymbals 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.060
 hand we will use the 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:19.700
 just to give you a lot but a lot 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:22.789
 a lot of flavor to this cake and it's about 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:27.340
 real mere spread the dough up 

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:27.340
 form a circle about 30 centimeters 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.790
 once the base is well extended 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:38.050
 take the roller to one of the 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:41.820
 ends that the dough sticks and starts 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:43.260
 to give it a lift lifts the dough 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.240
 take a tray in which 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:48.570
 you previously put some paper 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.460
 star or paper for oven 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.010
 and the next step what had you 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.900
 anticipated the plums this fruit that 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:59.070
 I love it and all you have to do 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:01.430
 it is simple to split them in half remove 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:05.450
 bone 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:07.900
 now let's go then these are come 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.900
 plums 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.150
 add the juice of half a lemon 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:20.209
 gave me all the power of sugar 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.209
 brunette 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:28.500
 because if not a little touch of 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:28.500
 cinnamon and come what happens British 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:35.120
 let's let the rosemary sugar 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.920
 they start working on plums and 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.349
 now let's go with this we need 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.450
 well then to paste the dough that just 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:44.290
 we did if it's just yolk 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.290
 egg and milk 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:57.010
 Mark four fingers from the center toward 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:58.780
 edges of your mass and in the space that 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.290
 it's just to the center we're going to 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.290
 do what 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.680
 now let's take the edges of the 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.989
 mass and we will take them to the 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:12.140
 center you realize we will let 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:14.319
 see what our cake is and now 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.319
 yes 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:21.090
 we varnish the edges and little by little 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:21.090
 we are going to be hitting what 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:31.750
 Now lightly sprinkle the dough with 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:34.120
 brown sugar 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.980
 and we go direct nonstop oven 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:40.650
 preheated to 180 degrees centigrade 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.650
 for approximately 25 minutes
