 If you are already used to cameras 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.680

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.509

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.000
 this winner spike all 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:17.570
 good ingredients is a very skewer 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.740
 simple does not have much that we have 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:24.490
 access to the yucca drum butter 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:31.869
 sugar Salt 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:38.530
 the grape itself and the eggs the milk the 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:41.110
 yeast that has my mother to me not 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.600
 I'm not good at all so this is what 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:47.110
 let's use it had less evil and 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:50.560
 we started to proceed with the with the 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:52.689
 impact of how the skewer is made 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.990
 champion please here we have that 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:58.830
 if we throw him the arbi don 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.830
 here we mix everything 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.179
 and here we put the yeast 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.010
 until it is a thin dough 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:22.060
 but I see here something that calls me a lot 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.040
 the attention apart from having here the 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.740
 skewer already prepared to then be able 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.360
 try out 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.090
 was the first in our program in 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:34.460
 I can prove it we see some bottles 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:38.340
 because bottles of wine the bottle and 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:41.780
 a container to reuse the bottles 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.780
 of wine that we have at work 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:51.630
 We work up as recycle is 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:55.080
 very fashionable to recycle but more important 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:03:06.740
 for me is to reuse first before 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:06.740
 be the winner of this year 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:19.910
 all your quiet work 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:23.020
 to the one of the last ones that we always put 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.020
 the egg and the milk 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:35.020
 perfect and there look a headquarters is stressed 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:37.730
 also with this story preparing more 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:39.560
 but surely that did not happen to you in the 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.190
 contest because I was super nervous 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.190
 the men 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:48.440

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:53.810

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:57.610
 to see what they are going to say they concentrated the 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:04:01.040
 pincho and that everything goes well does not have 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:03.320
 many many things we go that was 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:06.280
 super center very concentrated and very 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.280
 centered he pricked me 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:12.709
 imagine that you get it wrong because you have not 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:14.610

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:17.040

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:21.150
 the first time you won in particular 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:23.940
 this contest of pintxos 2012 but the 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:28.530
 restaurant where you work is not the 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:31.530
 first time we say we say what is 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:33.990

 in the restaurant the zagales that there 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:51.470
 sure you can taste a euro 80 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:05:01.110
 many things many things clear then 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:06.830
 let's see what we do good here do 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:06.830
 the balls are dismantled 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:18.850
 we produce species can be brazil 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:34.510
 then a piece of grapes if we introduce 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.510
 the house cake 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:41.229

 that this juice cited that we like with 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:54.400
 the surprise inside if we go that to me 

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:56.740
 Seeing it like that does not seem at all 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:06:01.509
 difficult to prepare but surely if 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:04.380
 I put myself to prepare it if then what 

00:06:01.509 --> 00:06:09.570
 We put if the mold 

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:14.850
 and then it goes to the oven and then we put it to 

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:17.700
 250 degrees 4 minutes then in the tom that 

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:20.550
 the time has come because you have 

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:24.680
 prepared everything so that people 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:30.870

00:06:55.670 --> 00:07:10.370
 things 

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:12.229
 is that they have told me that maybe 

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:13.759
 someone at home to encourage you to prepare it 

00:07:12.229 --> 00:07:16.539
