00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.740
 in space and working and preparing 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:13.860
 all because we have a job today there 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.139
 a job to do sir we're going to 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.439
 work with sealant and we're going to 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:22.439
 develop in the four programs of 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.029
 this month in the same project with 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.090
 different techniques and different 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.949
 products today we're going to work with 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.650
 sealant that that product we're going to 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.920
 present the sealer is a product to 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.380
 Water is applied with universal sealer 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.809
 she hard universal and used on 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.480
 pieces of wood you can apply it on 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:46.890
 for example on cloth racks or 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:49.140
 on any porous surface we go 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.050
 to apply it in this case within the framework of 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.790
 a clock 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.280
 we already have divided the 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.559
 surface in the sectors where we are going to 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.260
 work golden decoupage to the sheet and the 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:03.079
 rest let's work painting this 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.089
 let's do in this case the sealing 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:07.369
 once the sealing is done this 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:11.540
 I'll leave it aside and I'll work 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:14.509
 this is going to be the step by step we are going to 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:20.560
 make decoupage to occupy I'm going to 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:20.560
 work with pieces of guide paper 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.859
 with a little bit of reason we are going to 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:28.200
 apply this we already know how to do 

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:31.950
 because we did it many times we applied 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:35.429
 reasons and we are going to stick the 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:38.130
 different pieces of paper and with a 

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:41.579
 with a piece of nylon we will go 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.890
 fixing the paper once we fix it 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.500
 we are going to do as we are always going to do 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.020
 a protective hand with molds and a 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.500
 Once that is done the work we 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:56.220
 it stays like this this refers the past engine and 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:59.610
 is protected when we have this done 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:03.319
 the next step will be to work with 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:06.719
 sealer and let's mix a little bit 

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:08.759
 of old white and a little bit of color 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:11.879
 which is called territorial beige 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:15.540
 I'm going to pass it then I'm going to 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:17.400
 give you used it as a base to first without 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.160
 close all day to ensure the 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.860
 I'm not going to use it as a medium 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.769
 of kanaker this this glaze because 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.850
 because I will have the surface 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:29.640
 protected 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.590
 with a little bit of me 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.420
 translucent because what I want is 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.610
 that you notice that I'm working below 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.010
 with a recycled paper in the case of 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:42.810
 role of guide you think to be clear 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:45.540
 then we do this yes yes once 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:48.830
 we have this step finished we are going to 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.830
 let you see dry 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:56.870
 and let's move on to the next step that 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:59.170
 would apply in the framework we will return 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.170
 here 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:04.860
 we are going to apply on the surface that 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:08.670
 we have already a little bit of car marked 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:10.890
 say universal to give you time to 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.080
 take mordant point this we had already 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.850
 seen not only do we go sometimes but to 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.010
 I'm interested in showing you in this case it's 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:19.560
 the subject of it that has to two uses 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:22.560
 totally different one seal and the 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:25.380
 another one allows it to be used as a means to 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.330
 make an english a good glaze and this 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.130
 project continues this project by 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.740
 continue let's continue on Tuesday that 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.810
 come I say goodbye to everyone be good 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:35.520
 he waited for us next week we are not going to 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.090
 see how he's still behind and then thank you 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.090
