about<00:00:15.269> thirty<00:00:15.570> six<00:00:15.809> cents<00:00:16.049> a<00:00:16.170> mile<00:00:16.379> coming

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
about thirty six cents a mile coming

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.830 
about thirty six cents a mile coming
straight<00:00:16.920> out<00:00:16.980> of<00:00:17.100> school<00:00:17.630> thirty-six<00:00:18.630> cents

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
straight out of school thirty-six cents

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:19.310 
straight out of school thirty-six cents
a<00:00:18.900> mile

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
a mile

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.060 
a mile
you<00:00:19.410> can<00:00:19.619> basically<00:00:20.130> multiply<00:00:21.119> that<00:00:21.500> so<00:00:22.500> if

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
you can basically multiply that so if

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.800 
you can basically multiply that so if
you<00:00:23.160> do<00:00:23.279> three<00:00:23.490> thousand<00:00:23.939> miles<00:00:24.060> I<00:00:24.449> think<00:00:24.480> it's

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
you do three thousand miles I think it's

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.230 
you do three thousand miles I think it's
three<00:00:24.990> you<00:00:25.560> do<00:00:25.710> three<00:00:25.949> thousand<00:00:26.310> miles<00:00:26.460> time

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
three you do three thousand miles time

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.839 
three you do three thousand miles time
point<00:00:27.720> three<00:00:27.990> six<00:00:28.429> then<00:00:29.429> you<00:00:29.490> come<00:00:29.670> to<00:00:29.699> a

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
point three six then you come to a

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.089 
point three six then you come to a
thousand<00:00:30.330> eighty<00:00:30.539> and<00:00:30.869> that's<00:00:31.500> about<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.740> max

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
thousand eighty and that's about the max

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.069 
thousand eighty and that's about the max
you<00:00:32.309> can<00:00:32.520> make<00:00:32.790> if<00:00:32.969> you<00:00:33.059> do<00:00:33.239> three<00:00:33.630> thousand

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
you can make if you do three thousand

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.530 
you can make if you do three thousand
miles<00:00:34.489> well<00:00:35.489> you<00:00:35.610> do<00:00:35.790> three<00:00:36.030> thousand<00:00:36.420> miles

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
miles well you do three thousand miles

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.180 
miles well you do three thousand miles
there's<00:00:36.899> a<00:00:36.989> definitely<00:00:37.469> possibility<00:00:38.100> that

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
there's a definitely possibility that

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.729 
there's a definitely possibility that
you<00:00:38.370> can<00:00:41.390> they're<00:00:42.390> on<00:00:42.690> a<00:00:42.719> sliding<00:00:43.020> scale<00:00:43.140> so<00:00:43.649> if

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
you can they're on a sliding scale so if

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.380 
you can they're on a sliding scale so if
you<00:00:43.829> do<00:00:44.010> I<00:00:44.460> want<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:44.730> say<00:00:44.820> two<00:00:44.879> hundred<00:00:45.059> miles

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
or less it's forty eight cents a mile if

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.900 
or less it's forty eight cents a mile if
you<00:00:48.000> do<00:00:48.180> five<00:00:48.600> hundred<00:00:48.930> miles<00:00:49.640> or<00:00:50.640> less

that you get that way if you need to

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:37.340 
that you get that way if you need to
take<00:02:36.720> a<00:02:36.750> nap

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350

go off duty all right and what else
let's<00:02:44.940> see<00:02:46.040> now<00:02:47.040> another<00:02:47.280> way<00:02:47.430> to<00:02:47.460> maximize

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
let's see now another way to maximize

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.560 
let's see now another way to maximize
the<00:02:48.060> 70<00:02:48.480> is<00:02:48.720> is<00:02:49.350> by<00:02:49.560> recapping<00:02:50.450> basically<00:02:51.450> what

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
the 70 is is by recapping basically what

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.350 
the 70 is is by recapping basically what
recapping<00:02:52.020> is<00:02:52.140> is<00:02:52.380> on<00:02:52.680> Tuesday<00:02:53.220> let's<00:02:54.060> say<00:02:54.300> you

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
recapping is is on Tuesday let's say you

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.620 
recapping is is on Tuesday let's say you
were<00:02:54.840> on<00:02:55.200> duty<00:02:55.610> driving<00:02:56.610> or<00:02:56.700> on-duty<00:02:57.060> period

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
were on duty driving or on-duty period

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.160 
were on duty driving or on-duty period
for<00:02:57.900> 11<00:02:58.350> hours<00:02:58.610> then<00:02:59.610> that<00:02:59.990> Monday<00:03:00.990> at

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
for 11 hours then that Monday at

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.620 
for 11 hours then that Monday at
midnight<00:03:01.200> going<00:03:01.980> into<00:03:02.250> Tuesday<00:03:02.490> you<00:03:03.390> will<00:03:03.510> get

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
midnight going into Tuesday you will get

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.480 
midnight going into Tuesday you will get
that<00:03:03.840> those<00:03:04.260> hours<00:03:04.650> back<00:03:04.920> and<00:03:05.250> you<00:03:05.340> can

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:05.490 
that those hours back and you can

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:07.520 
that those hours back and you can
continue<00:03:05.790> to<00:03:05.940> drive<00:03:06.270> and<00:03:06.600> you<00:03:06.780> will<00:03:06.990> not<00:03:07.170> have

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
continue to drive and you will not have

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.340 
continue to drive and you will not have
to<00:03:08.030> sit<00:03:09.030> for<00:03:09.090> thirty<00:03:09.420> four<00:03:09.630> hours<00:03:09.900> to<00:03:09.990> reset

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
to sit for thirty four hours to reset

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.530 
to sit for thirty four hours to reset
your<00:03:10.500> 70<00:03:10.920> you<00:03:11.400> can<00:03:11.550> just<00:03:11.760> start<00:03:11.910> recapping

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
your 70 you can just start recapping

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.060 
your 70 you can just start recapping
that's<00:03:13.140> another<00:03:13.380> way<00:03:13.530> to<00:03:13.590> maximize<00:03:14.450> your<00:03:15.450> 70

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.070 
that's another way to maximize your 70

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:18.500 
that's another way to maximize your 70
the<00:03:17.070> reason<00:03:17.400> being<00:03:17.550> is<00:03:17.640> because<00:03:17.790> you<00:03:18.000> can<00:03:18.150> you

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
the reason being is because you can you

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.770 
the reason being is because you can you
can<00:03:18.720> continue<00:03:19.320> to<00:03:19.530> run<00:03:20.030> for<00:03:21.030> your<00:03:21.180> a<00:03:21.240> lot<00:03:21.600> of

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
can continue to run for your a lot of

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:27.040 
can continue to run for your a lot of
time<00:03:22.080> that<00:03:22.530> you<00:03:22.650> ran<00:03:22.860> that<00:03:23.070> day<00:03:23.280> a<00:03:23.720> week<00:03:24.720> before

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050 
time that you ran that day a week before

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:29.990 
time that you ran that day a week before
so<00:03:28.050> if<00:03:28.170> trucks<00:03:28.440> are<00:03:28.590> going<00:03:28.770> at<00:03:29.010> 62<00:03:29.580> you<00:03:29.820> might

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
so if trucks are going at 62 you might

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.450 
so if trucks are going at 62 you might
be<00:03:30.150> able<00:03:30.270> to<00:03:30.420> squeeze<00:03:30.660> 63<00:03:31.440> out<00:03:31.560> of<00:03:31.710> it<00:03:31.830> I<00:03:32.040> think

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:32.460 
be able to squeeze 63 out of it I think

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:37.450 
be able to squeeze 63 out of it I think
that<00:03:32.490> lease<00:03:32.820> operators<00:03:33.810> trucks<00:03:34.350> run<00:03:34.590> at<00:03:34.830> 68

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:37.460 
that lease operators trucks run at 68

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:39.680 
that lease operators trucks run at 68
but<00:03:38.460> if<00:03:38.640> you're<00:03:38.820> at<00:03:38.910> least<00:03:39.030> operated<00:03:39.600> you're

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
but if you're at least operated you're

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:40.940 
but if you're at least operated you're
paying<00:03:39.900> for<00:03:40.020> fuel<00:03:40.260> so<00:03:40.530> you<00:03:40.590> want<00:03:40.800> to<00:03:40.860> be

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
paying for fuel so you want to be

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.130 
paying for fuel so you want to be
mindful<00:03:41.310> of<00:03:41.610> trying<00:03:42.180> to<00:03:42.210> get<00:03:42.360> out<00:03:42.480> of<00:03:42.570> that<00:03:42.630> 68

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
mindful of trying to get out of that 68

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.930 
mindful of trying to get out of that 68
out<00:03:43.290> of<00:03:43.440> it<00:03:43.560> because<00:03:43.890> you<00:03:44.070> are<00:03:44.400> messing<00:03:44.760> up

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
out of it because you are messing up

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.580 
out of it because you are messing up
your<00:03:45.090> fuel<00:03:45.390> consumption<00:03:46.580> let's<00:03:47.580> see<00:03:47.820> if<00:03:48.180> I<00:03:48.630> can

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
your fuel consumption let's see if I can

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.630 
your fuel consumption let's see if I can
show<00:03:50.130> you<00:03:50.690> few<00:03:51.830> consumption<00:03:52.830> if<00:03:53.190> you<00:03:53.430> are

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
show you few consumption if you are

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.140 
show you few consumption if you are
thinking<00:03:54.060> about<00:03:54.120> doing<00:03:54.480> the<00:03:55.320> least<00:03:56.150> messaging

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
thinking about doing the least messaging

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:02.670
