you<00:00:35.280> know<00:00:35.370> Android<00:00:35.790> phones<00:00:36.000> stuff<00:00:36.270> like<00:00:36.420> that

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:37.309 
you know Android phones stuff like that

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:42.410 
you know Android phones stuff like that
mp3<00:00:38.309> players<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:39.620> it<00:00:40.620> is<00:00:41.040> it's<00:00:42.000> pretty<00:00:42.210> unique

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
mp3 players and it is it's pretty unique

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.139 
mp3 players and it is it's pretty unique
because<00:00:42.540> it's<00:00:42.899> all<00:00:42.989> digital<00:00:43.200> amplification

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:44.149 
because it's all digital amplification

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:46.490 
because it's all digital amplification
so<00:00:45.149> it's<00:00:45.239> it's<00:00:45.510> very<00:00:45.600> efficient<00:00:46.200> with<00:00:46.320> its

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
so it's it's very efficient with its

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.580 
so it's it's very efficient with its
power<00:00:46.739> so<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:50.480> built-in<00:00:51.480> it<00:00:51.840> has<00:00:51.870> a<00:00:52.020> simple<00:00:52.440> 4

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
power so the built-in it has a simple 4

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:53.689 
power so the built-in it has a simple 4
in<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.739> center<00:00:52.980> 5<00:00:53.160> no<00:00:53.309> quarter<00:00:53.579> inch

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
in the center 5 no quarter inch

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:54.889 
in the center 5 no quarter inch
subwoofer<00:00:54.120> then<00:00:54.329> it<00:00:54.420> has<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:54.539> speaker<00:00:54.870> on

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
subwoofer then it has a speaker on

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.869 
subwoofer then it has a speaker on
either<00:00:55.140> side<00:00:55.469> left<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:55.860> right<00:00:55.949> speaker<00:00:56.250> so

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
either side left and right speaker so

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.869 
either side left and right speaker so
it's<00:00:56.969> a<00:00:57.059> total<00:00:57.360> of<00:00:57.420> 130<00:00:58.050> watts<00:00:58.399> musical<00:00:59.399> system

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
it's a total of 130 watts musical system

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.630 
it's a total of 130 watts musical system
power<00:01:00.440> which<00:01:01.440> is<00:01:01.590> quite<00:01:01.859> a<00:01:01.890> bit<00:01:02.129> for<00:01:02.309> something
