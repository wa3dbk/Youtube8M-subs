00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
believe that's kilometres so it's a

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.109 
believe that's kilometres so it's a
little<00:01:15.990> less<00:01:16.229> miles<00:01:16.560> than<00:01:16.860> that<00:01:17.070> but<00:01:17.729> he<00:01:17.820> used

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
little less miles than that but he used

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.389 
little less miles than that but he used
it<00:01:18.330> in<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.600> rocks<00:01:18.840> so<00:01:19.800> the<00:01:19.890> wheels<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.310> can

00:01:20.389 --> 00:01:20.399
