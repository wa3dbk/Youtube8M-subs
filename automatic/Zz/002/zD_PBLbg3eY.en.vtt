00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
look inside here so now we've got two

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.719 
look inside here so now we've got two
objects<00:01:11.659> excuse<00:01:12.659> me<00:01:12.840> two<00:01:13.680> pieces<00:01:14.010> of<00:01:14.430> one

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
objects excuse me two pieces of one

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.929 
objects excuse me two pieces of one
object<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:15.390> I'm<00:01:16.170> going<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.380> go<00:01:16.560> into<00:01:17.400> edge

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
object and I'm going to go into edge

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.740 
object and I'm going to go into edge
mode<00:01:18.229> and<00:01:19.229> I'm<00:01:19.290> going<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.500> select<00:01:20.330> this<00:01:21.330> edge

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
mode and I'm going to select this edge

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.410 
mode and I'm going to select this edge
and<00:01:22.080> this<00:01:22.710> edge<00:01:25.009> now<00:01:26.009> that<00:01:26.790> those<00:01:26.970> two<00:01:27.270> are

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
and this edge now that those two are

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.249 
and this edge now that those two are
selected<00:01:27.780> I<00:01:27.869> can<00:01:27.930> press<00:01:28.229> ctrl<00:01:28.770> e<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:30.020> bring<00:01:31.020> up

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
selected I can press ctrl e and bring up

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.749 
selected I can press ctrl e and bring up
this<00:01:31.590> bridge<00:01:32.070> edge<00:01:32.490> loops<00:01:32.909> tool<00:01:33.570> and

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:34.759 
this bridge edge loops tool and

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:38.630 
this bridge edge loops tool and
theoretically<00:01:35.759> if<00:01:36.030> I<00:01:36.180> just<00:01:36.420> click<00:01:36.689> this<00:01:37.640> we're

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
theoretically if I just click this we're

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.260 
theoretically if I just click this we're
connected<00:01:39.360> back<00:01:39.659> up<00:01:39.900> again<00:01:40.880> so<00:01:41.880> there<00:01:42.030> you<00:01:42.150> go

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
connected back up again so there you go

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.020 
connected back up again so there you go
that's<00:01:42.630> how<00:01:42.840> to<00:01:42.990> connect<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:44.100> mouth<00:01:44.310> back<00:01:44.759> up

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
that's how to connect the mouth back up

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.770 
that's how to connect the mouth back up
with<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:46.590> head<00:01:46.799> and<00:01:47.100> also<00:01:48.000> taking<00:01:48.270> a<00:01:48.479> look<00:01:48.509> at

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
with the head and also taking a look at

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.020 
with the head and also taking a look at
the<00:01:48.869> teeth<00:01:49.140> here<00:01:49.619> they<00:01:50.310> may<00:01:50.490> need<00:01:50.700> to<00:01:50.850> move

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
the teeth here they may need to move

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.460 
the teeth here they may need to move
forward<00:01:51.720> just<00:01:51.750> a<00:01:52.079> bit<00:01:52.110> it's<00:01:52.710> always<00:01:54.470> difficult

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
forward just a bit it's always difficult

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.999 
forward just a bit it's always difficult
to<00:01:56.009> get<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.490> teeth<00:01:56.790> up<00:01:57.119> close<00:01:57.869> enough<00:01:58.290> to<00:01:58.619> the

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
to get the teeth up close enough to the

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.630 
to get the teeth up close enough to the
back<00:01:59.399> of<00:01:59.640> the<00:01:59.820> of<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.570> lips<00:02:01.100> I've<00:02:02.100> seen<00:02:02.399> so

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
back of the of the lips I've seen so

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.030 
back of the of the lips I've seen so
many<00:02:02.729> characters<00:02:03.270> with<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.630> teeth<00:02:03.869> way<00:02:04.649> far

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
many characters with the teeth way far

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.960 
many characters with the teeth way far
back<00:02:05.780> from<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:07.160> lips<00:02:08.160> and<00:02:08.399> that's<00:02:08.459> just<00:02:08.819> not

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
back from the lips and that's just not

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.690 
back from the lips and that's just not
the<00:02:09.179> way<00:02:09.300> it<00:02:09.330> is<00:02:09.590> but<00:02:10.590> let's<00:02:10.770> see<00:02:11.039> let<00:02:11.280> me<00:02:11.310> grab

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
the way it is but let's see let me grab

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.520 
the way it is but let's see let me grab

to<00:02:24.870> pull<00:02:25.050> them<00:02:25.140> for<00:02:25.350> just<00:02:25.500> a<00:02:25.590> bit<00:02:25.740> but<00:02:25.860> when<00:02:25.980> I

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
to pull them for just a bit but when I

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.720 
to pull them for just a bit but when I
do<00:02:26.160> they<00:02:26.450> break<00:02:27.450> out<00:02:27.630> of<00:02:27.810> the<00:02:27.870> gums<00:02:28.110> here<00:02:28.730> so

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
do they break out of the gums here so

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.340 
do they break out of the gums here so
what<00:02:30.240> I<00:02:30.390> can<00:02:30.540> do<00:02:31.850> is<00:02:32.850> just<00:02:33.420> take<00:02:33.720> this<00:02:33.990> edge

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
what I can do is just take this edge

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:39.830 
what I can do is just take this edge
here<00:02:34.790> and<00:02:35.930> move<00:02:36.930> that<00:02:37.140> forward<00:02:37.500> some<00:02:38.690> there<00:02:39.690> we

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
here and move that forward some there we

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:46.100 
here and move that forward some there we
go<00:02:42.740> all<00:02:43.740> right<00:02:44.010> I<00:02:44.250> think<00:02:45.120> we<00:02:45.600> are<00:02:45.720> good<00:02:45.930> to<00:02:46.080> go

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
go all right I think we are good to go

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:51.710 
go all right I think we are good to go
with<00:02:46.650> the<00:02:47.070> teeth<00:02:48.709> now<00:02:49.709> while<00:02:49.980> we're<00:02:50.160> here<00:02:50.720> we

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
with the teeth now while we're here we

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.420 
with the teeth now while we're here we
could<00:02:51.930> go<00:02:52.800> ahead<00:02:53.100> and<00:02:53.280> create<00:02:53.550> some<00:02:53.880> ears<00:02:54.150> too

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
could go ahead and create some ears too

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.920 
could go ahead and create some ears too
the<00:02:56.430> thing<00:02:56.640> about<00:02:56.850> the<00:02:57.030> character<00:02:57.450> is<00:02:57.630> that<00:02:57.810> it

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
the thing about the character is that it

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.160 
the thing about the character is that it
doesn't<00:02:58.200> have<00:02:58.680> really<00:02:59.160> ears<00:02:59.940> per<00:03:00.450> se<00:03:00.690> it's<00:03:00.959> got

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
doesn't have really ears per se it's got

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.060 
doesn't have really ears per se it's got
a<00:03:01.200> little<00:03:01.920> helmet<00:03:03.200> but<00:03:04.200> it<00:03:04.260> might<00:03:04.680> not<00:03:04.709> be<00:03:05.040> a

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
a little helmet but it might not be a

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.680 
a little helmet but it might not be a
bad<00:03:05.640> thing<00:03:05.700> to<00:03:06.090> go<00:03:06.480> ahead<00:03:06.600> and<00:03:07.230> create<00:03:07.860> some

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
bad thing to go ahead and create some

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.290 
bad thing to go ahead and create some
small<00:03:09.690> cartoony<00:03:10.440> ears<00:03:11.000> even<00:03:12.000> though<00:03:12.120> we're

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
small cartoony ears even though we're

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.180 
small cartoony ears even though we're
going<00:03:12.450> to<00:03:12.510> put<00:03:12.750> a<00:03:12.930> helmet<00:03:13.230> on<00:03:13.410> the<00:03:13.590> guy<00:03:13.739> after<00:03:14.130> a

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
going to put a helmet on the guy after a

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.590 
going to put a helmet on the guy after a
while<00:03:14.720> so<00:03:15.720> let's<00:03:15.959> see<00:03:16.110> how<00:03:16.260> we<00:03:16.320> might<00:03:16.440> do<00:03:16.800> that

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
while so let's see how we might do that

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.509 
while so let's see how we might do that
now<00:03:18.600> generally<00:03:19.019> speaking<00:03:19.049> the<00:03:19.590> ears<00:03:19.830> begin

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
now generally speaking the ears begin

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.660 
now generally speaking the ears begin
kind<00:03:20.910> of<00:03:20.970> at<00:03:21.060> the<00:03:21.150> bottom<00:03:21.510> of<00:03:21.660> the<00:03:22.070> nose<00:03:23.070> and

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
kind of at the bottom of the nose and

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.310 
kind of at the bottom of the nose and
end<00:03:24.090> around<00:03:24.510> the<00:03:25.049> top<00:03:25.560> of<00:03:25.590> the<00:03:25.769> eyes<00:03:26.209> generally

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:27.320 
end around the top of the eyes generally

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.840 
end around the top of the eyes generally
but<00:03:28.320> this<00:03:28.500> is<00:03:28.650> a<00:03:28.680> cartoon<00:03:29.100> character<00:03:29.370> so<00:03:29.730> I'm

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
but this is a cartoon character so I'm

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.630 
but this is a cartoon character so I'm
not<00:03:30.000> going<00:03:30.150> to<00:03:30.239> worry<00:03:30.390> too<00:03:30.600> much<00:03:30.630> about<00:03:30.840> that<00:03:31.640> I

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
not going to worry too much about that I

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.900 
not going to worry too much about that I
think<00:03:33.180> I'm<00:03:33.330> going<00:03:33.420> to<00:03:33.480> grab<00:03:33.750> these<00:03:34.260> two<00:03:34.910> faces

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
think I'm going to grab these two faces

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.100 
think I'm going to grab these two faces
for<00:03:36.840> this<00:03:37.610> and<00:03:38.610> all<00:03:38.970> I'm<00:03:39.090> going<00:03:39.209> to<00:03:39.269> do<00:03:39.480> is<00:03:39.780> just

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
for this and all I'm going to do is just

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:45.050 
for this and all I'm going to do is just
extrude<00:03:40.709> out<00:03:41.070> a<00:03:41.459> few<00:03:42.120> times<00:03:42.420> and<00:03:43.250> just<00:03:44.250> pull

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
extrude out a few times and just pull

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.990 
extrude out a few times and just pull
some<00:03:45.329> points<00:03:45.780> and<00:03:45.959> get<00:03:46.110> a<00:03:46.140> very<00:03:47.000> simple

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
some points and get a very simple

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.440 
some points and get a very simple
cartoon<00:03:48.480> ear<00:03:49.079> going<00:03:49.709> just<00:03:50.280> in<00:03:50.489> case<00:03:50.760> he's<00:03:51.090> ever

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
cartoon ear going just in case he's ever

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.120 
cartoon ear going just in case he's ever
without<00:03:51.870> his<00:03:52.170> helmet<00:03:52.560> but<00:03:52.590> generally

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
without his helmet but generally

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:54.319 
without his helmet but generally
speaking<00:03:53.459> I<00:03:53.610> think<00:03:53.640> he's<00:03:53.940> always<00:03:54.090> going<00:03:54.299> to

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:54.329 
speaking I think he's always going to

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:57.319 
speaking I think he's always going to
have<00:03:54.600> that<00:03:54.810> on<00:03:55.160> so<00:03:56.160> from<00:03:56.579> here<00:03:56.850> I'm<00:03:57.030> going<00:03:57.209> to

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:57.329 
have that on so from here I'm going to

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:00.949 
have that on so from here I'm going to
hit<00:03:57.450> a<00:03:57.530> efore<00:03:58.530> extrude<00:03:58.950> and<00:03:59.540> I'll<00:04:00.540> go<00:04:00.720> straight

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
hit a efore extrude and I'll go straight

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:03.620 
hit a efore extrude and I'll go straight
to<00:04:01.079> my<00:04:01.290> move<00:04:01.560> tool<00:04:01.590> and<00:04:02.220> pull<00:04:02.489> that<00:04:02.730> out<00:04:02.790> just<00:04:03.030> a

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
to my move tool and pull that out just a

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.289 
to my move tool and pull that out just a
little<00:04:03.660> bit<00:04:03.989> and<00:04:04.380> maybe<00:04:05.370> bring<00:04:05.670> it<00:04:05.820> up<00:04:05.970> some

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 
little bit and maybe bring it up some

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:12.610 
little bit and maybe bring it up some
and<00:04:06.840> just<00:04:07.829> kind<00:04:08.160> of<00:04:09.350> adjusting<00:04:10.350> as<00:04:10.500> I<00:04:10.650> go<00:04:10.890> here

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
so now I'm going to extrude again and

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.870 
so now I'm going to extrude again and
pull<00:04:17.880> straight<00:04:18.060> out<00:04:19.280> all<00:04:20.280> right<00:04:20.400> so<00:04:20.459> so<00:04:20.850> far

this is what I have and I'm going to
extrude<00:04:24.419> one<00:04:24.660> more<00:04:24.870> time

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:26.639 
extrude one more time

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:30.050 
extrude one more time
pull<00:04:26.939> straight<00:04:27.389> out<00:04:27.419> again<00:04:28.050> and<00:04:28.729> this<00:04:29.729> time

pull straight out again and this time

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:35.059 
pull straight out again and this time
I'm<00:04:30.449> going<00:04:30.629> to<00:04:30.689> scale<00:04:31.080> this<00:04:31.319> in<00:04:31.590> some<00:04:34.069> alright

00:04:35.059 --> 00:04:35.069 
I'm going to scale this in some alright

00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:40.459 
I'm going to scale this in some alright
it's<00:04:35.249> looking<00:04:35.610> kind<00:04:35.819> of<00:04:35.999> poofy<00:04:36.509> and<00:04:39.289> kind<00:04:40.289> of

00:04:40.459 --> 00:04:40.469 
it's looking kind of poofy and kind of

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:43.489 
it's looking kind of poofy and kind of
goofy<00:04:41.150> but<00:04:42.150> let's<00:04:42.479> begin<00:04:42.840> pulling<00:04:43.139> some

00:04:43.489 --> 00:04:43.499 
goofy but let's begin pulling some

00:04:43.499 --> 00:04:45.080 
goofy but let's begin pulling some
points<00:04:43.889> here<00:04:44.069> and<00:04:44.249> seeing<00:04:44.580> what<00:04:44.759> we<00:04:44.879> can

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
points here and seeing what we can

00:04:45.090 --> 00:05:00.670 
points here and seeing what we can
accomplish

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.499 

so<00:05:01.009> now<00:05:01.190> that<00:05:01.250> I've<00:05:01.490> pulled<00:05:01.759> some<00:05:02.000> points<00:05:02.360> this

00:05:02.499 --> 00:05:02.509 
so now that I've pulled some points this

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:04.300 
so now that I've pulled some points this
is<00:05:02.660> what<00:05:02.870> I<00:05:02.900> have<00:05:03.229> so<00:05:03.560> far

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.310 
is what I have so far

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:06.490 
is what I have so far
and<00:05:05.210> it's<00:05:05.389> getting<00:05:05.810> there<00:05:06.050> it's<00:05:06.199> still<00:05:06.440> a

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:06.500 
and it's getting there it's still a

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:09.219 
and it's getting there it's still a
little<00:05:06.889> bit<00:05:07.060> not<00:05:08.060> exactly<00:05:08.540> the<00:05:08.750> way<00:05:08.870> I'd<00:05:09.080> want

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:09.229 
little bit not exactly the way I'd want

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:14.469 
little bit not exactly the way I'd want
it<00:05:09.560> but<00:05:10.419> let's<00:05:11.419> now<00:05:12.370> go<00:05:13.370> into<00:05:13.610> face<00:05:14.030> mode<00:05:14.300> and

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:14.479 
it but let's now go into face mode and

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:17.740 
it but let's now go into face mode and
just<00:05:14.660> select<00:05:15.110> these<00:05:15.350> four<00:05:16.449> faces<00:05:17.449> at<00:05:17.600> the

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:17.750 
just select these four faces at the

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.779 
just select these four faces at the
front<00:05:18.139> of<00:05:18.320> the<00:05:18.440> ear<00:05:18.470> and<00:05:18.979> I'm<00:05:19.610> going<00:05:19.759> to

00:05:19.779 --> 00:05:19.789 
front of the ear and I'm going to

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:21.879 
front of the ear and I'm going to
extrude<00:05:20.330> and<00:05:20.660> go<00:05:20.840> straight<00:05:21.110> to<00:05:21.229> my<00:05:21.470> scale<00:05:21.860> tool

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:21.889 
extrude and go straight to my scale tool

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:25.029 
extrude and go straight to my scale tool
and<00:05:22.430> scale<00:05:22.759> this<00:05:23.000> down<00:05:23.060> and<00:05:23.720> pull<00:05:24.650> it<00:05:24.800> back

00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:25.039 
and scale this down and pull it back

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:31.960 
and scale this down and pull it back
some<00:05:25.690> so<00:05:26.690> you<00:05:26.780> get<00:05:26.930> a<00:05:26.960> general<00:05:30.639> shape<00:05:31.639> like

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:31.970 
some so you get a general shape like

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:37.420 
some so you get a general shape like
this<00:05:34.870> so<00:05:35.870> that's<00:05:36.050> generally<00:05:36.440> what<00:05:36.889> I'm<00:05:37.010> going

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:37.430 
this so that's generally what I'm going

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:41.340 
this so that's generally what I'm going
for<00:05:37.460> here<00:05:38.050> just<00:05:39.050> very<00:05:39.590> simple<00:05:40.280> cartoony<00:05:41.060> ears

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:41.350 
for here just very simple cartoony ears

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:44.430 
for here just very simple cartoony ears
now<00:05:42.350> of<00:05:42.500> course<00:05:42.770> I'd<00:05:42.979> take<00:05:43.220> some<00:05:43.250> time<00:05:43.820> and

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:44.440 
now of course I'd take some time and

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:50.740 
now of course I'd take some time and
pull<00:05:45.440> some<00:05:45.710> points<00:05:46.070> around<00:05:46.190> for<00:05:46.729> this<00:05:49.750> so

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:50.750 
pull some points around for this so

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:54.240 
pull some points around for this so
that's<00:05:50.960> how<00:05:51.229> I<00:05:51.260> would<00:05:51.470> create<00:05:51.949> cartoony<00:05:52.880> ears

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:54.250 
that's how I would create cartoony ears

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.409 
that's how I would create cartoony ears
well<00:05:55.250> our<00:05:55.400> character<00:05:55.849> is<00:05:55.910> looking<00:05:56.210> pretty

00:05:56.409 --> 00:05:56.419 
well our character is looking pretty

00:05:56.419 --> 00:06:00.670 
well our character is looking pretty
good<00:05:56.720> so<00:05:57.020> far<00:05:57.050> I<00:05:57.770> think<00:05:58.729> all<00:05:59.210> that's<00:05:59.570> left<00:06:00.380> of

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:00.680 
good so far I think all that's left of

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.129 
good so far I think all that's left of
the<00:06:00.830> base<00:06:01.099> character<00:06:01.550> now<00:06:01.970> is<00:06:02.330> just<00:06:02.780> the<00:06:02.960> eyes

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:03.139 
the base character now is just the eyes

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:06.820 
the base character now is just the eyes
and<00:06:04.180> maybe<00:06:05.180> we'll<00:06:05.419> take<00:06:05.720> a<00:06:05.750> look<00:06:06.169> at<00:06:06.440> the<00:06:06.680> eyes

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:06.830 
and maybe we'll take a look at the eyes

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:19.270 
and maybe we'll take a look at the eyes
in<00:06:07.389> the<00:06:08.389> next<00:06:08.810> video<00:06:09.370> see<00:06:10.370> you<00:06:10.490> then

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:19.280 

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.340
