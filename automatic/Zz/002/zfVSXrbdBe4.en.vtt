 wash it I learned this from a doctor 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.900
 specialized hair roots take 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:52.320
 long time to dry after a 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.660
 washed two or three days even that's why 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:57.780
 It is extremely important to use a 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:00.720
 dryer but only on the roots not 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.570
 on the tips that the tips remain 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.090
 wet is not a problem 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:08.910
 Eat healthily eat well 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:11.760
 it is very important to consume good 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:14.340
 quantities of fruits and vegetables too 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.810
 should do a diet focused on the 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.640
 proteins 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.580
 as the hair is composed by 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.830
 proteins a deficiency of these in the 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:25.530
 organism produces a weak hair and 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:28.260
 slow growth food 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:32.310
 Proteins include fish eggs 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:34.680
 the grains the yogurt et cetera the soy is 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:37.590
 another protein food that stimulates 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:40.500
 hair growth linseed oil 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.840
 the flax is a blue plant that 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.970
 grows in the Canadian prairies to 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.310
 collect your seeds 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:49.560
 the natural oil that is extracted from them 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.959
 It is highly recommended for nutrition 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:55.200
 general of the body for being a great 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:57.180
 source of essential acids serve by 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.880
 example to reduce the risk of 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.860
 coronary disease the daily dose 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.750
 recommended is at least 1,000 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.370
 milligrams between one and three times 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.370
 daily 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.110
 if you do not consume a lot of fish 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:12.599
 buy flaxseed oil to give the 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:14.760
 body all the vitamins you need 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:18.570
 and thereby accelerate the growth of 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:21.600
 hair trim the tips trim the 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:24.120
 Open ends is very important 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:26.520
 we ignore these tips we end up 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:29.340
 Taking a shorter hair due to 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.560
 that the tips break the deterioration 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.990
 of the tips expands to the rest of the 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.870
 hair so it is vital to eliminate the 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:38.970
 problem as soon as it appears not 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:42.090
 forget that hair does not create venues of 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:44.370
 the tips but from the roots that's why 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:47.130
 when we get rid of the tips 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:49.710
 open hair follicles should 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:52.620
 work less to repair the tips and 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:54.600
 the root work improves if you 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:59.510
 Trim your split ends with 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:59.510
 often the hair will grow faster
