HP makes different models that can also
use<00:00:17.400> this<00:00:17.670> and<00:00:18.859> unfortunately<00:00:19.859> those<00:00:20.220> laptops

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
use this and unfortunately those laptops

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.090 
use this and unfortunately those laptops
tend<00:00:21.270> to<00:00:21.359> have<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.660> same<00:00:21.689> problem<00:00:22.439> as<00:00:22.650> these

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
tend to have the same problem as these

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.150 
tend to have the same problem as these
are<00:00:23.369> three<00:00:23.609> thousands<00:00:24.350> which<00:00:25.350> specifically

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
are three thousands which specifically

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.250 
are three thousands which specifically
is<00:00:26.670> that<00:00:27.439> the<00:00:28.439> rear<00:00:28.980> DC<00:00:29.670> power<00:00:29.939> jack<00:00:30.359> that<00:00:31.230> you

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
is that the rear DC power jack that you

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.900 
is that the rear DC power jack that you
plug<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.830> laptop<00:00:32.219> into<00:00:34.610> comes<00:00:35.610> loose<00:00:35.880> from

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
plug the laptop into comes loose from

the motherboard and it's quite a common
issue<00:00:39.360> with<00:00:39.809> these<00:00:41.510> unfortunately<00:00:42.510> they're

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
issue with these unfortunately they're

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.459 
issue with these unfortunately they're
not<00:00:43.320> easy<00:00:44.070> to<00:00:44.280> get<00:00:44.579> to<00:00:44.910> so<00:00:45.360> taking<00:00:46.050> laptop

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
not easy to get to so taking laptop

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.639 
not easy to get to so taking laptop
apart<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.250> just<00:00:48.000> resaw<00:00:48.960> during<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.379> jack<00:00:49.620> to

apart and just resaw during the jack to

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.549 
apart and just resaw during the jack to
the<00:00:49.920> board<00:00:50.160> although<00:00:51.059> a<00:00:51.239> lot<00:00:51.750> of<00:00:51.780> people<00:00:51.899> can

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
the board although a lot of people can

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.119 
the board although a lot of people can
do<00:00:52.800> it<00:00:53.039> it's<00:00:53.760> just<00:00:54.180> not<00:00:54.420> it's<00:00:55.140> not<00:00:55.410> easy<00:00:55.680> it's

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
do it it's just not it's not easy it's

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.400 
do it it's just not it's not easy it's
not<00:00:56.219> for<00:00:56.579> novice<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:59.420> generally<00:01:00.420> even<00:01:00.930> if

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
not for novice and generally even if

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.889 
not for novice and generally even if
they<00:01:01.620> have<00:01:01.770> been<00:01:01.980> restored<00:01:02.640> they'll<00:01:03.600> need<00:01:03.870> to

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
they have been restored they'll need to

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.740 
they have been restored they'll need to
be<00:01:04.080> right<00:01:04.320> resolder<00:01:04.769> again<00:01:05.250> later

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
be right resolder again later

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.859 
be right resolder again later
just<00:01:07.380> because<00:01:07.650> they<00:01:07.770> they<00:01:08.100> tend<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.869> come

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
just because they they tend to come

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.039 
just because they they tend to come
loose<00:01:10.049> from<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.350> motherboard<00:01:10.619> over<00:01:11.310> time<00:01:11.490> and

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:12.049 
loose from the motherboard over time and

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:15.380 
loose from the motherboard over time and
that's<00:01:13.049> an<00:01:13.260> issue<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.680> compact<00:01:14.189> has<00:01:14.430> it's<00:01:15.270> an

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
that's an issue the compact has it's an

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.350 
that's an issue the compact has it's an
issue<00:01:15.509> that<00:01:15.659> HP<00:01:16.229> has<00:01:16.820> that's<00:01:17.820> an<00:01:18.030> issue<00:01:18.150> that

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
issue that HP has that's an issue that

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.679 
issue that HP has that's an issue that
this<00:01:19.259> computer<00:01:19.890> has<00:01:21.740> and<00:01:23.000> so<00:01:24.000> what<00:01:24.150> we<00:01:24.270> did<00:01:24.479> is

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
this computer has and so what we did is

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:31.069 
this computer has and so what we did is
we<00:01:24.720> developed<00:01:25.350> an<00:01:25.619> adapter<00:01:28.670> the<00:01:29.670> bypasses<00:01:30.659> the

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
we developed an adapter the bypasses the

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.850 
we developed an adapter the bypasses the
rear<00:01:31.259> DC<00:01:31.710> power<00:01:31.920> tracker<00:01:32.250> now<00:01:33.530> what<00:01:34.530> a<00:01:34.560> lot<00:01:34.650> of

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
rear DC power tracker now what a lot of

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.350 
rear DC power tracker now what a lot of
people<00:01:35.100> don't<00:01:35.250> understand<00:01:35.850> and<00:01:36.060> don't<00:01:36.119> know

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
people don't understand and don't know

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.350 
people don't understand and don't know
about<00:01:37.259> these<00:01:37.439> computers<00:01:38.100> is<00:01:38.820> right<00:01:39.119> here<00:01:39.270> on

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
about these computers is right here on

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.160 
about these computers is right here on
the<00:01:39.479> side<00:01:39.689> is<00:01:40.049> an<00:01:40.560> expansion<00:01:41.220> port<00:01:41.990> and<00:01:42.990> what

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
the side is an expansion port and what

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.039 
the side is an expansion port and what
that<00:01:43.350> port<00:01:43.649> does<00:01:43.920> is<00:01:44.159> it<00:01:44.450> can<00:01:45.450> be<00:01:45.479> plugged<00:01:45.780> into

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
that port does is it can be plugged into

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.350 
that port does is it can be plugged into
a<00:01:46.259> base<00:01:46.890> that<00:01:46.920> you<00:01:47.280> can<00:01:47.430> put<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.670> computer<00:01:48.030> in

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
a base that you can put the computer in

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.929 
a base that you can put the computer in
and<00:01:49.290> transfer<00:01:51.500> different<00:01:52.500> sort<00:01:52.710> of<00:01:52.770> data<00:01:52.979> and

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
and transfer different sort of data and

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:59.749 
and transfer different sort of data and
the<00:01:54.240> USB<00:01:54.450> video<00:01:55.079> and<00:01:55.729> power<00:01:56.729> also<00:01:58.130> so<00:01:59.130> what<00:01:59.579> we

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
the USB video and power also so what we

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.590 
the USB video and power also so what we
did<00:02:00.030> is<00:02:00.630> we<00:02:00.719> created<00:02:01.200> this<00:02:01.320> adapter<00:02:02.420> once<00:02:03.420> our

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
did is we created this adapter once our

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.630 
did is we created this adapter once our
rear<00:02:04.439> DC<00:02:04.860> power<00:02:05.250> tech<00:02:05.490> failed

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
rear DC power tech failed

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.340 
rear DC power tech failed
we<00:02:06.729> just<00:02:06.940> couldn't<00:02:07.300> couldn't<00:02:07.960> keep<00:02:08.289> doing

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350 
we just couldn't couldn't keep doing

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.000 
we just couldn't couldn't keep doing
that<00:02:09.340> option<00:02:09.850> we<00:02:10.840> decided<00:02:11.290> to<00:02:11.350> go<00:02:11.500> this<00:02:11.650> this

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
that option we decided to go this this

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.130 
that option we decided to go this this
all<00:02:12.220> from<00:02:12.430> the<00:02:12.550> route<00:02:12.760> and<00:02:13.150> so<00:02:13.480> what<00:02:13.720> I<00:02:13.870> want<00:02:14.050> to

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
all from the route and so what I want to

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.470 
all from the route and so what I want to
show<00:02:14.319> you<00:02:14.380> today<00:02:14.709> is<00:02:15.000> basically<00:02:16.000> just<00:02:16.240> how<00:02:16.360> it

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
show you today is basically just how it

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.880 
show you today is basically just how it
works<00:02:16.660> and<00:02:16.870> how<00:02:16.930> easy<00:02:17.230> it<00:02:17.440> is<00:02:17.530> to<00:02:18.069> put<00:02:18.280> on<00:02:18.400> now

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
works and how easy it is to put on now

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.610 
works and how easy it is to put on now
the<00:02:20.890> adapter<00:02:21.310> itself<00:02:21.400> is<00:02:22.110> this<00:02:23.110> two<00:02:23.410> piece

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
the adapter itself is this two piece

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.050 
the adapter itself is this two piece
unit<00:02:24.330> you<00:02:25.330> got<00:02:25.510> the<00:02:25.660> adapter<00:02:26.200> and<00:02:26.910> then<00:02:27.910> you've

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
unit you got the adapter and then you've

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.840 
unit you got the adapter and then you've
got<00:02:28.209> the<00:02:28.330> insert<00:02:28.780> and<00:02:29.650> what<00:02:30.100> you'll<00:02:30.280> find<00:02:30.310> on

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
got the insert and what you'll find on

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.479 
got the insert and what you'll find on
the<00:02:31.300> insert<00:02:31.840> is<00:02:32.110> on<00:02:32.380> one<00:02:32.560> side<00:02:32.590> there'll<00:02:33.100> be<00:02:33.130> a

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
the insert is on one side there'll be a

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:36.690 
the insert is on one side there'll be a
black<00:02:33.880> stripe<00:02:34.300> right<00:02:34.600> here<00:02:35.280> that's<00:02:36.280> gonna<00:02:36.489> be

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
black stripe right here that's gonna be

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.520

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070 
just using the battery and the fact that

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:05.630 
just using the battery and the fact that
I<00:03:00.430> don't<00:03:00.760> have<00:03:00.940> a<00:03:01.030> battery<00:03:01.239> anyway<00:03:04.050> this<00:03:05.050> works

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
else we tried to just be pulled out of

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.520 
else we tried to just be pulled out of
the<00:03:56.609> side<00:03:56.819> so<00:03:57.810> we<00:03:57.900> needed<00:03:58.170> something<00:03:58.379> that

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
the side so we needed something that

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.080 
the side so we needed something that
could<00:03:58.680> be<00:03:58.890> secured<00:03:59.430> to<00:03:59.519> it<00:04:01.579> and<00:04:02.579> using<00:04:02.940> this

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
could be secured to it and using this

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.140 
could be secured to it and using this
insert<00:04:03.569> and<00:04:03.930> bring<00:04:04.799> it<00:04:04.950> directly<00:04:05.069> to<00:04:05.970> the

over a year now and it just it just
works<00:05:24.599> great<00:05:24.949> sometimes<00:05:25.949> we'll<00:05:26.159> leave<00:05:26.340> this

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 
works great sometimes we'll leave this
