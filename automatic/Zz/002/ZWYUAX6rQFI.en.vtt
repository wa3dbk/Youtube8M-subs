00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.009 
blooming there's so many fabulous things
how<00:00:22.949> do<00:00:23.010> you<00:00:23.490> make<00:00:23.699> them<00:00:23.910> last<00:00:24.180> so<00:00:24.510> long<00:00:24.720> and

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
how do you make them last so long and

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.950 
how do you make them last so long and
look<00:00:25.410> fabulous<00:00:25.710> at<00:00:26.160> an<00:00:26.279> arrangement

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:28.960 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.710 

often<00:00:29.950> garden<00:00:30.490> flowers<00:00:30.850> have<00:00:31.090> stems<00:00:31.420> that<00:00:31.600> are

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:31.720 
often garden flowers have stems that are

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.690 
often garden flowers have stems that are
a<00:00:31.810> little<00:00:31.990> more<00:00:32.170> fragile<00:00:32.520> sometimes<00:00:33.520> they're

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:33.700 
a little more fragile sometimes they're

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.850 
a little more fragile sometimes they're
shorter<00:00:34.180> so<00:00:34.690> I'd<00:00:34.780> like<00:00:34.900> to<00:00:34.960> work<00:00:35.290> with<00:00:35.320> a<00:00:35.530> low

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:35.860 
shorter so I'd like to work with a low

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.700 
shorter so I'd like to work with a low
bowl<00:00:36.310> and<00:00:36.730> rather<00:00:37.300> than<00:00:37.600> using<00:00:38.110> just<00:00:38.140> fresh

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:38.710 
bowl and rather than using just fresh

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:40.200 
bowl and rather than using just fresh
water<00:00:39.040> where<00:00:39.400> there's<00:00:39.580> not<00:00:39.730> enough<00:00:40.030> support

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.210 
water where there's not enough support

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:41.760 
water where there's not enough support
because<00:00:40.720> of<00:00:40.810> the<00:00:40.870> height<00:00:41.080> of<00:00:41.110> the<00:00:41.290> bowl<00:00:41.530> or

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:41.770 
because of the height of the bowl or

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.190 
because of the height of the bowl or
foam<00:00:42.640> where<00:00:43.120> it<00:00:43.180> might<00:00:43.300> crush<00:00:43.660> their<00:00:43.900> tender

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:44.200 
foam where it might crush their tender

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.740 
foam where it might crush their tender
little<00:00:44.350> stems<00:00:44.739> I<00:00:45.070> go<00:00:45.550> to<00:00:45.610> floral<00:00:46.059> netting<00:00:46.540> and

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:46.750 
little stems I go to floral netting and

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.369 
little stems I go to floral netting and
create<00:00:47.440> an<00:00:47.590> armature<00:00:47.980> so<00:00:48.820> just<00:00:49.030> wad<00:00:49.450> that<00:00:49.480> the

00:00:50.369 --> 00:00:50.379 
create an armature so just wad that the

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:56.210 
create an armature so just wad that the
technical<00:00:50.830> term<00:00:51.250> and<00:00:52.199> then<00:00:53.199> place<00:00:53.590> it<00:00:53.620> down<00:00:54.100> in

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:56.220 
technical term and then place it down in

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.580 
technical term and then place it down in
spreading<00:00:57.220> it<00:00:57.340> out<00:00:57.520> and<00:00:57.930> then<00:00:58.930> to<00:00:59.050> anchor<00:00:59.500> it

00:00:59.580 --> 00:00:59.590 
spreading it out and then to anchor it

spreading it out and then to anchor it
in<00:00:59.710> place<00:01:00.090> using<00:01:01.090> just<00:01:01.390> a<00:01:01.540> bit<00:01:01.660> of<00:01:01.780> waterproof

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:02.380

when<00:01:27.970> designing<00:01:28.360> with<00:01:28.600> garden<00:01:28.960> flowers<00:01:29.350> I

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
when designing with garden flowers I

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.100 
when designing with garden flowers I
like<00:01:29.680> to<00:01:30.040> use<00:01:30.160> garden<00:01:30.700> foliage<00:01:31.240> things<00:01:31.930> that

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.110 
like to use garden foliage things that

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:33.690 
like to use garden foliage things that
you<00:01:32.200> wouldn't<00:01:32.410> be<00:01:32.620> used<00:01:32.890> to<00:01:33.010> seeing<00:01:33.400> in<00:01:33.640> a

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
you wouldn't be used to seeing in a

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.420 
you wouldn't be used to seeing in a
normal<00:01:34.300> everyday<00:01:34.720> flower<00:01:35.170> arrangement<00:01:35.890> for

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.430 
normal everyday flower arrangement for

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.030 
normal everyday flower arrangement for
this<00:01:36.670> I<00:01:36.910> chose<00:01:37.420> the<00:01:37.630> wedgie<00:01:38.050> Lia<00:01:38.320> it's<00:01:38.950> a

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 
this I chose the wedgie Lia it's a

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.060 
this I chose the wedgie Lia it's a
beautiful<00:01:39.670> variegated<00:01:40.050> coloration<00:01:41.070> cutting

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.070 
beautiful variegated coloration cutting

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:43.620 
beautiful variegated coloration cutting
it<00:01:42.190> down<00:01:42.220> with<00:01:42.610> a<00:01:42.640> knife<00:01:42.910> so<00:01:43.120> it<00:01:43.210> has<00:01:43.390> a<00:01:43.420> nice

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
it down with a knife so it has a nice

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.230 
it down with a knife so it has a nice
clean<00:01:43.930> cut<00:01:44.410> they'll<00:01:44.890> drink<00:01:45.190> well<00:01:45.490> and<00:01:45.790> then

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
clean cut they'll drink well and then

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.150 
clean cut they'll drink well and then
just<00:01:46.450> setting<00:01:46.840> it<00:01:46.990> right<00:01:47.140> down<00:01:47.590> into<00:01:47.800> the<00:01:47.920> wire

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:48.160 
just setting it right down into the wire

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.240 
just setting it right down into the wire
you<00:01:48.880> can<00:01:49.030> see<00:01:49.300> that<00:01:49.570> supports<00:01:50.170> it<00:01:50.380> holds<00:01:51.130> it

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
you can see that supports it holds it

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.320 
you can see that supports it holds it
into<00:01:51.430> place<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:53.020> repeating<00:01:53.970> letting<00:01:54.970> it<00:01:55.060> be<00:01:55.300> a

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
into place and repeating letting it be a

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.410 
into place and repeating letting it be a
little<00:01:55.780> bit<00:01:55.990> airy<00:01:56.440> coming<00:01:57.310> out<00:01:57.490> fuller<00:01:57.970> a

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
little bit airy coming out fuller a

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:04.490 
little bit airy coming out fuller a
little<00:01:59.080> a<00:01:59.290> gear<00:02:01.200> coming<00:02:02.200> out<00:02:02.350> to<00:02:02.560> the<00:02:02.710> side

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
little a gear coming out to the side

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.200 
little a gear coming out to the side
using<00:02:05.500> the<00:02:05.619> larger<00:02:06.220> leaves<00:02:06.369> towards<00:02:07.000> the

using the larger leaves towards the

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:12.320 
using the larger leaves towards the
center<00:02:07.720> to<00:02:08.080> help<00:02:08.320> create<00:02:08.619> the<00:02:08.800> accent<00:02:09.340> area

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330

this<00:02:13.330> soft<00:02:13.720> variegation<00:02:14.260> goes<00:02:14.950> so<00:02:15.370> well<00:02:15.700> with

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
this soft variegation goes so well with

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.479 
this soft variegation goes so well with
the<00:02:15.970> green<00:02:16.270> container<00:02:16.750> helps<00:02:17.740> create<00:02:18.100> unity

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
the green container helps create unity

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:26.010 
the green container helps create unity
from<00:02:18.970> the<00:02:19.120> very<00:02:19.360> beginning<00:02:19.900> of<00:02:19.959> the<00:02:20.110> design

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
now tucking in the flowers using that

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.370 
now tucking in the flowers using that
same<00:02:29.110> radial<00:02:30.100> format<00:02:30.730> feeding<00:02:31.630> into<00:02:32.230> the

same radial format feeding into the

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.800 
same radial format feeding into the
netting<00:02:32.830> so<00:02:33.490> it<00:02:33.550> gives<00:02:33.880> it<00:02:34.000> support<00:02:34.540> and

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
netting so it gives it support and
