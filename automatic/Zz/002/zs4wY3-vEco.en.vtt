00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
this dude who I prefer him the most

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.980 
this dude who I prefer him the most
because<00:01:49.170> he's<00:01:49.469> the<00:01:49.710> slowest<00:01:50.720> if<00:01:51.720> you<00:01:51.869> do<00:01:51.959> not

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
because he's the slowest if you do not

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.899 
because he's the slowest if you do not
know<00:01:52.259> a<00:01:52.500> lot<00:01:52.740> of<00:01:52.770> shooters<00:01:53.130> like<00:01:53.280> this<00:01:53.549> when

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
know a lot of shooters like this when

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.270 
know a lot of shooters like this when
you<00:01:54.030> hold<00:01:54.299> in<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.630> shop<00:01:54.869> button<00:01:55.200> it<00:01:55.649> slows<00:01:56.039> the

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
you hold in the shop button it slows the

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.190 
you hold in the shop button it slows the
craft<00:01:56.819> down<00:01:57.060> so<00:01:57.299> you<00:01:57.390> can<00:01:57.539> do<00:01:57.689> some<00:01:57.720> of<00:01:57.929> them<00:01:58.079> on

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
craft down so you can do some of them on

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.499 
craft down so you can do some of them on
navigating<00:01:58.890> of<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.700> bullet<00:01:59.939> patterns<00:02:00.270> at<00:02:00.420> a

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
navigating of the bullet patterns at a

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.480 
navigating of the bullet patterns at a
slower<00:02:00.720> pace<00:02:00.810> well<00:02:01.770> this<00:02:01.950> game<00:02:02.069> doesn't<00:02:02.280> seem

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
slower pace well this game doesn't seem

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.399 
slower pace well this game doesn't seem
to<00:02:02.579> have<00:02:02.729> that<00:02:02.909> so<00:02:03.060> these<00:02:03.179> two<00:02:03.390> people<00:02:03.750> are<00:02:04.020> so

00:02:06.559 --> 00:02:06.569 
fast I'm really not that good at dodging

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:09.889

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
missed this demyx i pled this one quite

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.740 
missed this demyx i pled this one quite
a<00:02:54.840> lot<00:02:55.109> compared<00:02:55.859> to<00:02:56.239> the<00:02:57.239> other<00:02:57.420> one<00:02:57.569> one

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
a lot compared to the other one one

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.840 
a lot compared to the other one one
thing<00:02:57.900> I<00:02:57.959> really<00:02:58.200> don't<00:02:58.380> like<00:02:58.730> what<00:02:59.730> I<00:02:59.760> see

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
thing I really don't like what I see

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.819 
thing I really don't like what I see
from<00:03:00.150> this<00:03:00.299> game<00:03:00.510> so<00:03:00.720> far<00:03:00.930> is<00:03:01.230> when<00:03:01.500> you<00:03:01.620> kill

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829 
from this game so far is when you kill

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:03.740 
from this game so far is when you kill
things<00:03:02.099> and<00:03:02.310> the<00:03:02.370> bullets<00:03:02.670> usually<00:03:03.060> disappear

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
things and the bullets usually disappear

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.020 
things and the bullets usually disappear
in<00:03:03.900> shmups<00:03:04.230> on<00:03:04.680> this<00:03:04.920> they<00:03:05.160> kind<00:03:05.400> of<00:03:05.459> turn<00:03:05.760> into

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
in shmups on this they kind of turn into

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.449 
in shmups on this they kind of turn into
a<00:03:06.060> white<00:03:06.930> boy<00:03:07.170> and<00:03:07.500> stay<00:03:07.859> there<00:03:08.099> and<00:03:08.310> it's

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
a white boy and stay there and it's

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.300 
a white boy and stay there and it's
really<00:03:08.760> confusing<00:03:09.000> I<00:03:09.920> would<00:03:10.920> rather<00:03:11.069> than

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
really confusing I would rather than

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.039 
really confusing I would rather than
just<00:03:11.489> go<00:03:11.700> I<00:03:11.970> would<00:03:12.180> rather<00:03:12.329> them<00:03:12.540> not<00:03:12.599> linger<00:03:13.019> a

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
just go I would rather them not linger a

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:15.920 
just go I would rather them not linger a
talks<00:03:13.349> when<00:03:13.650> they<00:03:13.769> do<00:03:13.829> linger<00:03:14.340> it<00:03:14.819> did<00:03:15.720> you<00:03:15.810> see

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
talks when they do linger it did you see

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.659 
talks when they do linger it did you see
my<00:03:15.959> pad<00:03:16.230> just<00:03:16.440> then<00:03:16.709> you<00:03:16.980> might<00:03:17.220> notice<00:03:17.430> I

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:17.669 
my pad just then you might notice I

00:03:17.669 --> 00:03:20.300 
my pad just then you might notice I
drifted<00:03:18.000> to<00:03:18.150> the<00:03:18.180> right<00:03:18.889> it's<00:03:19.889> about<00:03:19.980> time<00:03:20.280> I

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
drifted to the right it's about time I

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.430 
drifted to the right it's about time I
opened<00:03:20.790> a<00:03:21.000> fresh<00:03:21.450> pad<00:03:21.690> because<00:03:21.900> this<00:03:22.109> one<00:03:22.290> is

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
opened a fresh pad because this one is

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:23.780 
opened a fresh pad because this one is
is<00:03:22.620> getting<00:03:22.889> to<00:03:23.010> the<00:03:23.099> point<00:03:23.250> where<00:03:23.370> it's

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
is getting to the point where it's

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:24.750 
is getting to the point where it's
affecting

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
affecting

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.270 
affecting
precision<00:03:25.720> in<00:03:25.930> these<00:03:26.140> kind<00:03:26.409> of<00:03:26.470> games<00:03:26.650> so

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
precision in these kind of games so

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.250 
precision in these kind of games so
don't<00:03:27.459> expect<00:03:27.640> any<00:03:28.090> greatness<00:03:28.599> for<00:03:28.810> me<00:03:29.019> in

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
don't expect any greatness for me in

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:30.539 
don't expect any greatness for me in
this<00:03:29.470> demo<00:03:29.799> because<00:03:29.920> like<00:03:30.159> I<00:03:30.189> said<00:03:30.400> my

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:30.549 
this demo because like I said my

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:33.390 
this demo because like I said my
analogies<00:03:31.000> he's<00:03:31.689> no<00:03:32.140> good<00:03:32.319> and<00:03:32.950> if<00:03:33.040> you<00:03:33.129> see<00:03:33.280> my

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
analogies he's no good and if you see my

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.679 
analogies he's no good and if you see my
character<00:03:33.700> move<00:03:33.849> to<00:03:33.970> the<00:03:34.060> right<00:03:34.209> really

00:03:34.679 --> 00:03:34.689 
character move to the right really

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:36.809 
character move to the right really
sporadically<00:03:35.200> are<00:03:35.409> really<00:03:35.739> fast<00:03:36.040> fully<00:03:36.310> just

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:36.819 
sporadically are really fast fully just

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:40.699 
sporadically are really fast fully just
not<00:03:36.939> has<00:03:37.209> nothing<00:03:37.450> to<00:03:37.780> do<00:03:37.930> with<00:03:38.140> me<00:03:38.319> bit<00:03:39.189> well

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
not has nothing to do with me bit well

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.899 
not has nothing to do with me bit well
for<00:03:41.709> the<00:03:41.799> most<00:03:41.950> I<00:03:42.159> think<00:03:42.190> this<00:03:42.430> seems<00:03:42.730> like<00:03:42.819> a

00:03:42.899 --> 00:03:42.909 
for the most I think this seems like a

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:45.600 
for the most I think this seems like a
really<00:03:43.239> cool<00:03:43.510> fun<00:03:43.870> game<00:03:44.370> I'm<00:03:45.370> really

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610 
really cool fun game I'm really

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:46.979 
really cool fun game I'm really
interested<00:03:45.849> to<00:03:46.090> see<00:03:46.299> how<00:03:46.450> much<00:03:46.599> harder<00:03:46.900> it

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
interested to see how much harder it

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:49.020 
interested to see how much harder it
gets<00:03:47.079> because<00:03:47.290> as<00:03:47.409> I<00:03:47.500> mentioned<00:03:47.530> I<00:03:48.159> think<00:03:48.909> it

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
gets because as I mentioned I think it

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.050 
gets because as I mentioned I think it
took<00:03:49.150> me<00:03:49.299> two<00:03:49.510> attempts<00:03:50.019> to<00:03:50.920> beat<00:03:51.700> the<00:03:51.849> demo

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
took me two attempts to beat the demo

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:53.970 
took me two attempts to beat the demo
without<00:03:52.420> dying<00:03:52.720> and<00:03:53.349> my<00:03:53.379> score<00:03:53.739> at<00:03:53.859> the<00:03:53.920> end

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
without dying and my score at the end

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.099 
without dying and my score at the end
was<00:03:54.370> a<00:03:54.609> hundred<00:03:55.030> million<00:03:55.480> and<00:03:55.810> when<00:03:55.900> I<00:03:55.930> looked

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:56.109 
was a hundred million and when I looked

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:59.069 
was a hundred million and when I looked
at<00:03:56.319> the<00:03:56.730> achievements<00:03:57.730> there<00:03:58.540> was<00:03:58.690> one<00:03:58.870> for

00:03:59.069 --> 00:03:59.079 
at the achievements there was one for

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:00.660 
at the achievements there was one for
getting<00:03:59.379> a<00:03:59.470> hundred<00:03:59.769> million<00:03:59.950> score<00:04:00.370> so<00:04:00.640> I

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
getting a hundred million score so I

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:01.770 
getting a hundred million score so I
would<00:04:00.879> have<00:04:00.970> literally<00:04:01.239> got<00:04:01.450> it<00:04:01.569> on<00:04:01.659> this

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:01.780 
would have literally got it on this

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.610 
would have literally got it on this
level<00:04:02.049> so<00:04:02.799> it<00:04:03.670> makes<00:04:03.849> me<00:04:04.030> wonder<00:04:04.150> if<00:04:04.480> they<00:04:05.409> get

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
level so it makes me wonder if they get

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.589 
level so it makes me wonder if they get
scoring<00:04:06.040> on<00:04:06.159> this<00:04:06.340> mod<00:04:06.639> particular<00:04:07.329> mode<00:04:07.480> is

00:04:07.589 --> 00:04:07.599 
scoring on this mod particular mode is

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:09.059 
scoring on this mod particular mode is
quite<00:04:07.810> simple<00:04:08.200> and<00:04:08.379> I'd<00:04:08.500> already<00:04:08.650> picked<00:04:08.980> it

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:09.069 
quite simple and I'd already picked it

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:10.619 
quite simple and I'd already picked it
up<00:04:09.159> and<00:04:09.370> my<00:04:09.670> scarring<00:04:09.940> was<00:04:10.150> literally<00:04:10.450> quite

00:04:10.619 --> 00:04:10.629 
up and my scarring was literally quite

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:11.879 
up and my scarring was literally quite
black<00:04:10.840> things<00:04:11.139> and<00:04:11.349> killed<00:04:11.560> him<00:04:11.680> with<00:04:11.769> the

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:11.889 
black things and killed him with the

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:13.949 
black things and killed him with the
drill<00:04:12.129> I'm<00:04:13.030> being<00:04:13.450> a<00:04:13.510> little<00:04:13.540> bit<00:04:13.810> more

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 
drill I'm being a little bit more

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:15.539 
drill I'm being a little bit more
relaxed<00:04:14.079> here<00:04:14.500> because<00:04:14.650> am<00:04:14.889> I<00:04:15.010> at<00:04:15.069> my<00:04:15.250> lungs

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:15.549 
relaxed here because am I at my lungs

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:17.189 
relaxed here because am I at my lungs
being<00:04:15.760> shitty<00:04:16.030> and<00:04:16.570> when<00:04:16.690> I<00:04:16.720> was<00:04:16.870> playing<00:04:16.989> I

00:04:17.189 --> 00:04:17.199 
being shitty and when I was playing I

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:19.080 
being shitty and when I was playing I
wasn't<00:04:17.470> talking<00:04:17.859> so<00:04:18.130> I<00:04:18.340> could<00:04:18.669> just<00:04:18.820> kind<00:04:18.970> of

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
wasn't talking so I could just kind of

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:20.520 
wasn't talking so I could just kind of
focus<00:04:19.449> on<00:04:19.539> the<00:04:19.660> game<00:04:19.780> they're<00:04:19.840> going<00:04:20.199> to<00:04:20.410> my

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
focus on the game they're going to my

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:23.820 
focus on the game they're going to my
little<00:04:20.829> zone<00:04:21.070> but<00:04:22.060> I<00:04:22.710> think<00:04:23.710> there's

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
little zone but I think there's

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.140 
little zone but I think there's
something<00:04:24.010> to<00:04:24.130> be<00:04:24.280> said<00:04:24.310> for<00:04:24.520> the<00:04:24.699> genre<00:04:25.090> of

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
something to be said for the genre of

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:26.700 
something to be said for the genre of
games<00:04:25.180> I<00:04:25.630> think<00:04:25.840> it's<00:04:25.990> a<00:04:26.080> genre<00:04:26.110> that's<00:04:26.590> not

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
games I think it's a genre that's not

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.730 
games I think it's a genre that's not
really<00:04:26.889> represented<00:04:27.460> that<00:04:27.580> well<00:04:27.789> anymore<00:04:28.030> and

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
really represented that well anymore and

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.990 
really represented that well anymore and
cave<00:04:29.740> is<00:04:30.010> not<00:04:30.160> what<00:04:30.310> it<00:04:30.340> used<00:04:30.430> to<00:04:30.699> be<00:04:30.729> because

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
cave is not what it used to be because

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.600 
cave is not what it used to be because
the<00:04:31.240> people<00:04:31.539> who<00:04:31.660> made<00:04:31.900> care<00:04:32.520> pretty<00:04:33.520> much

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
the people who made care pretty much

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.750 
the people who made care pretty much
left<00:04:34.919> maybe<00:04:35.919> they'll<00:04:36.099> go<00:04:36.190> on<00:04:36.280> to<00:04:36.400> do<00:04:36.490> different

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:36.760 
left maybe they'll go on to do different

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.610 
left maybe they'll go on to do different
things<00:04:36.789> better<00:04:37.150> things<00:04:37.510> and<00:04:37.810> shooters<00:04:38.500> I'll

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:38.620 
things better things and shooters I'll

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.529 
things better things and shooters I'll
have<00:04:38.770> a<00:04:38.800> resurgence<00:04:39.460> but<00:04:39.699> there's<00:04:40.360> always

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:40.539 
have a resurgence but there's always

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:41.610 
have a resurgence but there's always
that<00:04:40.630> opportunities<00:04:41.260> always<00:04:41.530> that

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
that opportunities always that

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.860 
that opportunities always that
possibility<00:04:41.740> that<00:04:42.220> they<00:04:42.460> want<00:04:42.729> and<00:04:43.060> it'll<00:04:43.690> be

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
possibility that they want and it'll be

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:45.060 
possibility that they want and it'll be
really<00:04:44.050> sad<00:04:44.289> to<00:04:44.440> see<00:04:44.590> them<00:04:44.650> go<00:04:44.770> I<00:04:44.919> think

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.070 
really sad to see them go I think

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:47.070 
really sad to see them go I think
because<00:04:45.580> they're<00:04:45.789> one<00:04:46.599> of<00:04:46.630> my<00:04:46.690> favorite

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
because they're one of my favorite

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.480 
because they're one of my favorite
genres<00:04:47.410> energy<00:04:47.740> on<00:04:47.860> Ruth<00:04:48.039> at<00:04:48.130> not<00:04:48.280> a<00:04:48.310> lot<00:04:48.460> of

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
genres energy on Ruth at not a lot of

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:51.450 
genres energy on Ruth at not a lot of
people<00:04:48.580> I'll<00:04:49.419> even<00:04:49.539> remember<00:04:50.229> or<00:04:50.770> even<00:04:51.070> care

people I'll even remember or even care

at all for which once again I believe

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:56.850 
at all for which once again I believe
that's<00:04:54.310> quite<00:04:54.610> sad<00:04:54.849> and<00:04:55.410> not<00:04:56.410> starting<00:04:56.770> a

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
that's quite sad and not starting a

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.560 
that's quite sad and not starting a
negative<00:04:57.280> connotation<00:04:57.460> for<00:04:57.880> the<00:04:58.060> people<00:04:58.389> just

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:57.430 
have a lot of difficulty achieving that

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:00.869 
have a lot of difficulty achieving that
when<00:05:57.610> I'm<00:05:57.699> talking<00:05:58.830> people<00:05:59.830> think<00:06:00.039> playing

00:06:00.869 --> 00:06:00.879 
when I'm talking people think playing

00:06:00.879 --> 00:06:02.489 
when I'm talking people think playing
games<00:06:01.150> normally<00:06:01.599> and<00:06:01.719> talking<00:06:02.020> is<00:06:02.110> difficult

00:06:02.489 --> 00:06:02.499 
games normally and talking is difficult

00:06:02.499 --> 00:06:04.379 
games normally and talking is difficult
and<00:06:02.650> it<00:06:02.740> is<00:06:02.860> until<00:06:03.370> you<00:06:03.400> kind<00:06:03.729> of<00:06:03.879> get<00:06:03.999> used<00:06:04.060> to

00:06:04.379 --> 00:06:04.389 
and it is until you kind of get used to

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:06.629 
and it is until you kind of get used to
it<00:06:04.479> a<00:06:04.539> little<00:06:04.659> bit<00:06:04.900> it's<00:06:05.259> not<00:06:05.499> a<00:06:05.680> natural<00:06:06.460> thing

00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:06.639 
it a little bit it's not a natural thing

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:09.149 
it a little bit it's not a natural thing
to<00:06:06.849> do<00:06:07.349> but<00:06:08.349> you<00:06:08.469> want<00:06:08.620> to<00:06:08.650> try<00:06:08.830> playing
