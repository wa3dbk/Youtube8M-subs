 entertainment program browser 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.490
 dedicated to the world of martial arts today 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:19.439
 unscheduled release and entertainment 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.300
 perhaps there will be little in it the fact that 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.970
 only days ago in this world 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.829
 It became one size smaller and 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.579
 probably it would not be worth dedicating canceled 

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:28.710
 whole issue 

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:30.960
 if not for the cause of the circumstances and 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.610
 the consequences of his death further 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:40.920
 about all the details and the details you 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:43.559
 will learn from the feet to gone the name of the deceased from 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.239
 I will go Maguire Miras 35-year-old 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.070
 mexican wrestler conquered 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.309
 multiple titles rational level 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.320
 engaged in the hands of 15 years of age as 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.999
 easy to count him 20 years of experience 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.219
 except for such a scant description of him 

00:00:53.999 --> 00:00:58.829
 biography I could not find anything 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.989
 how about let's see footage from that 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.739
 the most ill-fated battle that became 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:07.200
 the cause of death of athletes battle took place 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.800
 in the Mexican city of Tijuana on the border 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.990
 USA 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.990
 n yards Rus dressed in all black 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.000
 and here is the fatal blow 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:38.009
 and we see that pedro is no longer 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:40.320
 reacts to the whole world around 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:45.299
 around continue to create shows what they 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:46.860
 must do for 2 nights wrestler 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.690
 Doctors brought to hospital 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.940
 stated death due to 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.229
 fracture of the cervical vertebrae is the same 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.020
 fatal blow struck 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:58.700
 rei mysterio younger successor known 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.700
 you 7 rey mysterio senior 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.960
 Here is such a completely joyless 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.530
 the story happened on the night of 21 to 22 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.360
 Martha 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.399
 what was surprising to me was that after 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.740
 this event on wrestlers who were 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.660
 in the ring fell charges and again 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:17.020
 remembered all the insults that brought 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.580
 bleed track but is this true 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:22.250
 Today it is almost no secret that 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.530
 wrestling is one big production and 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.230
 pre- rehearsed script but 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:29.209
 call the wrestlers mediocre my language 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.250
 does not turn try to explain 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:33.980
 how can I fall on my back like this 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.200
 so as not to feel the battle or how to 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.820
 jump from a height of two meters so that 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.100
 don't break your chest 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:42.260
 Opponent that do not say and do it 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.930
 extremely difficult and that means the difference 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.450
 such a safe sport and him too 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.640
 it is impossible to foresee everything as in 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.560
 In this case, according to the scenario Fedor 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.560
 romer and had to portray is ill 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.600
 asshole and everyone knew it but who knew 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.000
 that everything will turn out so it seems to me that 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.370
 death many spelled him but the script 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.800
 and no wrestler whatever he was 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.920
 fan of his business did not bring for his 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:09.200
 life on the altar of world wrestling glory 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.600
 but this is not the only death 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.700
 wrestler on the ling let's remember a couple 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:18.709

 very sad event but much 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.530

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.459
