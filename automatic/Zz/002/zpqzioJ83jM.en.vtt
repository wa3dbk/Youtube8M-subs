the fact it's called the lake Pro super
dry<00:00:41.309> is<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.460> new<00:00:41.640> family<00:00:42.239> of<00:00:42.270> lines<00:00:42.600> that<00:00:42.809> is

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
dry is a new family of lines that is

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.880 
dry is a new family of lines that is
based<00:00:43.920> on<00:00:44.129> an<00:00:44.250> entirely<00:00:44.640> new<00:00:45.410> material<00:00:46.410> the

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
based on an entirely new material the

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.770 
based on an entirely new material the
line<00:00:47.480> repels<00:00:48.480> water<00:00:49.219> unbelievably<00:00:50.219> well<00:00:50.430> and

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
line repels water unbelievably well and

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.509 
line repels water unbelievably well and
with<00:00:51.780> that<00:00:52.050> material<00:00:52.649> you<00:00:52.679> get<00:00:52.980> a<00:00:53.010> line<00:00:53.309> that

00:00:53.509 --> 00:00:53.519 
with that material you get a line that

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:56.229 
with that material you get a line that
not<00:00:53.760> only<00:00:53.910> floats<00:00:54.420> higher--<00:00:54.690> but<00:00:55.289> it<00:00:55.410> slides

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 
not only floats higher-- but it slides

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:58.970 
not only floats higher-- but it slides
incredibly<00:00:57.239> well<00:00:57.420> so<00:00:57.660> you<00:00:57.780> get<00:00:57.899> easy<00:00:58.320> distance

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
incredibly well so you get easy distance

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.430 
incredibly well so you get easy distance
lines<00:00:59.760> that<00:01:00.030> float<00:01:00.329> higher<00:01:00.600> are<00:01:00.899> easier<00:01:01.410> to

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
lines that float higher are easier to

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.770 
lines that float higher are easier to
manage<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.579> when<00:01:02.940> you're<00:01:03.059> trying<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:03.420> mend

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
manage and when you're trying to mend

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.100 
manage and when you're trying to mend
line<00:01:04.140> and<00:01:04.530> work<00:01:04.800> a<00:01:04.980> fly<00:01:05.220> back<00:01:05.490> and<00:01:05.820> these

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
line and work a fly back and these

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.630 
line and work a fly back and these
uneven<00:01:07.110> seams<00:01:07.410> water<00:01:08.010> currents<00:01:08.520> it's

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
uneven seams water currents it's

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.190 
uneven seams water currents it's
important<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.150> be<00:01:09.240> able<00:01:09.300> to<00:01:09.390> manage<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.960> line

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
important to be able to manage the line

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.830 
important to be able to manage the line
so<00:01:11.070> that's<00:01:11.280> why<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.550> super<00:01:12.060> dry<00:01:12.240> material<00:01:12.750> is

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
so that's why the super dry material is

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.790 
so that's why the super dry material is
unbeatable<00:01:13.800> this<00:01:13.980> line<00:01:14.820> has<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.630> longer<00:01:16.350> front

longer<00:01:19.380> front<00:01:19.710> taper<00:01:19.980> what<00:01:20.250> it<00:01:20.370> does<00:01:20.580> is<00:01:20.790> it

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:20.910 
longer front taper what it does is it

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:23.780 
longer front taper what it does is it
allows<00:01:20.940> me<00:01:21.630> to<00:01:22.350> manipulate<00:01:22.980> the<00:01:23.130> line<00:01:23.310> after<00:01:23.580> I

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
allows me to manipulate the line after I

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.910 
allows me to manipulate the line after I

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.280 
have less friction when I'm double
hauling<00:02:10.829> so<00:02:11.640> this<00:02:11.819> red<00:02:12.090> or<00:02:12.329> orange<00:02:12.540> section<00:02:13.170> is

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
hauling so this red or orange section is

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.500 
hauling so this red or orange section is
the<00:02:13.530> double<00:02:13.890> haul<00:02:14.069> zone

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:20.629 
area near my leader is more supple so I

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:22.839
