00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.500
 evans visitors and must be 20 years old 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.470
 books or probably accompanies me at one 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:29.100
 breast-op training so start with would be 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.680
 flying with dumbbells also oblique 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.449
 Bank we start a lot 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.780
 we'll do it with twelve repetitions then 

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:37.590
 we make 10 and 1 88 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.100
 important here is that we really 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:44.809
 work slowly because that's the first sentence 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.809
 want to build up with these before 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.240
 so the second round is one more 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:27.710
 then we will make four again 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.180
 sets of twelve again 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.220
 repetitions work our mother 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:35.979
 on 8 intermediate steps if then ten 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.979
 and eight repetitions and say go 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:20.490
 next comes the short 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.350
 suppress four sets again 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.080
 problems with twelve in the evening minutes 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.150
 on 10 then again 88 of course again 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.540
 so that you can just so in court 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.540
 rule 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.660
 the last breast exercise that neither 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:12.080
 learns the same sentence one of mine 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:13.940
 flat bench barbell chf 77 times ten 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.989
 repetitions between sentences 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:21.220
 we turn 30 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:21.220
 so that the screen is on the chest 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:27.159
 do 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.630
 do 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.959
 the 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:28.960
 here 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.860
 b 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:39.420
 u 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.830
 thÃ¼r 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.830
 O 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:58.630
 so now we start with trapez 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:02.080
 Here we start with my own 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:04.530
 So far Switzerland has been creating quite simple 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:07.470
 Exercises are very good for me 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:13.110
 as we do again four sets 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:13.110
 twelve repetitions and put on 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:36.670
 So the last exercise for the trapezoid now 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:39.010
 At the train the man office cross for the 

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:41.500
 Back shoulder again with here 

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:43.330
 four sets work from 15 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.580
 Repeats down to 8 that is 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:48.610
 we will then do twelve repetitions 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:51.990
 then ten and then the last eight then 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:51.990
 I would always say watch this way 

00:06:19.759 --> 00:06:24.330
 so that the bus trapezoidal workout 

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:27.389
 I hope you liked it for 

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:28.490
 criticism I am once subscribed 

00:06:27.389 --> 00:06:30.569
 the canal 

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:34.970
 but see you at the latest German 

00:06:30.569 --> 00:06:34.970
 championship of gwf and
