hello and welcome to minor talks about

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.100 
hello and welcome to minor talks about
an<00:00:02.460> age<00:00:02.669> of<00:00:02.790> empires<00:00:03.149> to<00:00:03.540> that<00:00:03.780> forgotten

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
an age of empires to that forgotten

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.680 
an age of empires to that forgotten
empires<00:00:04.400> technology<00:00:05.400> this<00:00:06.029> is<00:00:06.210> about<00:00:06.509> the

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
empires technology this is about the

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.020 
empires technology this is about the
hunt<00:00:06.899> and<00:00:07.020> their<00:00:07.950> new<00:00:08.130> you<00:00:08.580> need<00:00:08.730> technology

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
hunt and their new you need technology

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.070 
hunt and their new you need technology
they<00:00:09.389> can<00:00:09.510> get<00:00:10.490> so<00:00:11.490> a<00:00:11.820> bit<00:00:12.300> of<00:00:12.420> history<00:00:12.840> with

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
they can get so a bit of history with

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.129 
they can get so a bit of history with
the<00:00:13.410> Gauss<00:00:13.889> and<00:00:14.360> I<00:00:15.360> believe<00:00:15.570> I<00:00:15.630> explained<00:00:16.020> it

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
the Gauss and I believe I explained it

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.710 
the Gauss and I believe I explained it
in<00:00:16.260> the<00:00:16.289> actual<00:00:16.850> unit<00:00:17.850> technology<00:00:18.330> videos

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
in the actual unit technology videos

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.500 
in the actual unit technology videos
that<00:00:18.930> I<00:00:18.960> did<00:00:19.140> last<00:00:19.289> time<00:00:19.560> a<00:00:19.910> while<00:00:20.910> back<00:00:20.939> for

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
that I did last time a while back for

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.990 
that I did last time a while back for
the<00:00:21.810> Gauss<00:00:22.020> with<00:00:22.410> that<00:00:22.529> Anakin<00:00:22.920> perfusion<00:00:23.460> but

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
the Gauss with that Anakin perfusion but

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.370 
the Gauss with that Anakin perfusion but
the<00:00:24.090> idea<00:00:24.390> of<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.600> ghost<00:00:24.840> was<00:00:25.019> that<00:00:25.230> they

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
the idea of the ghost was that they

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.589 
the idea of the ghost was that they
could<00:00:25.820> they<00:00:26.820> were<00:00:26.880> very<00:00:27.119> much<00:00:27.330> sort<00:00:27.510> of

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
could they were very much sort of

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.660 
could they were very much sort of
slightly<00:00:27.930> nomadic<00:00:28.500> creatures<00:00:29.039> babba

slightly nomadic creatures babba
creatures<00:00:30.029> civilization<00:00:30.869> and<00:00:31.019> they<00:00:31.650> would

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
creatures civilization and they would

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.600 
creatures civilization and they would
walk<00:00:32.070> they<00:00:32.489> would<00:00:32.640> go<00:00:32.669> around<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:33.180> place<00:00:33.390> and

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:34.610 
walk they would go around the place and

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.240 
walk they would go around the place and
they<00:00:35.610> could<00:00:35.820> easily<00:00:36.329> get<00:00:37.079> soldiers<00:00:37.620> as<00:00:37.800> in<00:00:38.040> the

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
they could easily get soldiers as in the

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.459 
they could easily get soldiers as in the
house<00:00:38.430> girls<00:00:38.700> from<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.780> villages<00:00:40.110> that<00:00:40.320> they

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
house girls from the villages that they

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.240 
house girls from the villages that they
had<00:00:41.000> so<00:00:42.320> instead<00:00:43.320> of<00:00:43.379> having<00:00:43.500> properly

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
had so instead of having properly

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.100 
had so instead of having properly
trained<00:00:44.579> military<00:00:45.000> professional<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:45.960> then

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
trained military professional and then

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.700 
trained military professional and then
the<00:00:46.920> general<00:00:47.719> civilians<00:00:48.719> as<00:00:49.079> two<00:00:49.350> separate

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
the general civilians as two separate

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.260 
the general civilians as two separate
people<00:00:50.039> what<00:00:50.610> would<00:00:50.730> happen<00:00:50.879> if<00:00:51.120> the

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
people what would happen if the

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.880 
people what would happen if the
civilians<00:00:51.809> would<00:00:52.020> then<00:00:52.199> quickly<00:00:52.530> put<00:00:52.800> on

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
civilians would then quickly put on

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.040 
civilians would then quickly put on
tomorrow<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.460> fight<00:00:54.090> in<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.510> battle<00:00:54.840> and

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
tomorrow and fight in the battle and

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.180 
tomorrow and fight in the battle and
this<00:00:55.710> made<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:55.980> gaas<00:00:56.280> very<00:00:57.469> annoying<00:00:58.469> for<00:00:58.620> any

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
this made the gaas very annoying for any

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.590 
this made the gaas very annoying for any
enemies<00:00:59.640> because<00:01:00.000> they<00:01:00.120> would<00:01:00.210> just<00:01:00.390> suddenly

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
enemies because they would just suddenly

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.299 
enemies because they would just suddenly
have<00:01:00.989> a<00:01:01.020> large<00:01:01.320> army<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:03.860> the<00:01:04.860> same<00:01:05.070> actually

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
have a large army and the same actually

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.020 
have a large army and the same actually
happened<00:01:06.090> for<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.390> Huns<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:07.500> Huns<00:01:07.710> would

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
happened for the Huns the Huns would

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.550 
happened for the Huns the Huns would
they<00:01:09.030> were<00:01:09.090> quite<00:01:09.600> nomadic<00:01:10.110> creatures

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
they were quite nomadic creatures

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.080 
they were quite nomadic creatures
perhaps<00:01:10.799> of<00:01:11.159> people<00:01:11.610> as<00:01:11.700> well<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.150> so<00:01:14.090> they

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
perhaps of people as well and so they

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.399 
perhaps of people as well and so they
would<00:01:15.299> go<00:01:15.420> around<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.750> place<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:15.960> they<00:01:16.229> would

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
would go around the place and they would

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.200 
would go around the place and they would
do<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.560> very<00:01:16.860> similar<00:01:17.100> thing<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.729> Gulf<00:01:17.909> say

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
do a very similar thing to the Gulf say

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.600 
do a very similar thing to the Gulf say
they<00:01:18.509> are<00:01:18.689> roughly<00:01:19.350> in<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.530> same<00:01:19.799> area<00:01:20.159> in

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
they are roughly in the same area in

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.499 
they are roughly in the same area in
Europe<00:01:21.450> but<00:01:21.860> so<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:23.009> idea<00:01:23.100> with<00:01:23.580> them<00:01:23.880> the

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
Europe but so the idea with them the

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.260 
Europe but so the idea with them the
unit<00:01:25.049> technology<00:01:25.640> for<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.729> Huns<00:01:26.909> in<00:01:27.150> the

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
unit technology for the Huns in the

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.719 
unit technology for the Huns in the
castle<00:01:27.780> age<00:01:27.900> Marauders<00:01:28.590> is<00:01:28.979> that<00:01:29.520> you<00:01:29.610> can

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
castle age Marauders is that you can

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.940 
castle age Marauders is that you can
create<00:01:29.850> Tarkan's<00:01:30.450> at<00:01:30.720> stables<00:01:31.229> and<00:01:31.500> it<00:01:31.740> costs

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
create Tarkan's at stables and it costs

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.200 
create Tarkan's at stables and it costs
500<00:01:32.130> food<00:01:32.610> 200<00:01:33.360> gold<00:01:33.600> so<00:01:34.490> like<00:01:35.490> with<00:01:35.729> anarchy

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
500 food 200 gold so like with anarchy

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.179 
500 food 200 gold so like with anarchy
for<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.540> gauss<00:01:36.720> this<00:01:37.229> is<00:01:37.380> also<00:01:37.650> quite<00:01:37.740> useful

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
for the gauss this is also quite useful

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.060 
for the gauss this is also quite useful
doesn't<00:01:38.880> cost<00:01:39.060> that<00:01:39.180> much<00:01:39.329> at<00:01:39.689> all<00:01:39.840> really<00:01:40.200> so

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
doesn't cost that much at all really so

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.800 
doesn't cost that much at all really so
i<00:01:41.100> can<00:01:41.280> get<00:01:41.400> bored<00:01:42.000> as<00:01:42.180> you<00:01:42.210> can<00:01:42.390> see<00:01:42.509> i<00:01:42.540> can't

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
i can get bored as you can see i can't

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.690 
i can get bored as you can see i can't
get<00:01:42.990> talking<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.439> their<00:01:43.560> so<00:01:43.799> reward<00:01:44.369> us<00:01:44.549> and

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
get talking to their so reward us and

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.850 
get talking to their so reward us and
there<00:01:45.479> is<00:01:45.659> a<00:01:45.689> target<00:01:46.020> its<00:01:46.380> cost<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.710> same

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
there is a target its cost the same

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.880 
there is a target its cost the same
amount<00:01:47.189> as<00:01:47.729> it<00:01:47.850> does<00:01:48.030> in<00:01:48.060> a<00:01:48.210> castle<00:01:48.829> but<00:01:49.829> you

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
amount as it does in a castle but you

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.499 
amount as it does in a castle but you
can<00:01:50.280> just<00:01:51.149> create<00:01:51.329> it<00:01:51.630> a<00:01:51.840> bit<00:01:52.350> easier<00:01:52.380> and<00:01:53.509> that

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
can just create it a bit easier and that

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.690 
can just create it a bit easier and that
can<00:01:54.689> be<00:01:54.720> very<00:01:54.810> useful<00:01:55.130> because<00:01:56.130> as<00:01:56.520> i<00:01:56.579> said

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
can be very useful because as i said

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.429 
can be very useful because as i said
with<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.060> gauss<00:01:57.240> one<00:01:57.479> you<00:01:57.600> instead<00:01:58.259> of<00:01:58.290> having

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
with the gauss one you instead of having

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.910 
with the gauss one you instead of having
to<00:01:58.590> create<00:01:59.479> 650<00:02:00.479> stone<00:02:00.780> to<00:02:01.079> in<00:02:01.380> order<00:02:01.560> to<00:02:01.680> get<00:02:01.890> a

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
to create 650 stone to in order to get a

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.370 
to create 650 stone to in order to get a
castle<00:02:02.369> you<00:02:02.969> can<00:02:03.119> just<00:02:03.270> build<00:02:03.810> a<00:02:03.869> stable<00:02:04.049> which

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
castle you can just build a stable which

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.809 
castle you can just build a stable which
200<00:02:05.070> 175<00:02:06.380> would

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
200 175 would

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.399 
200 175 would
and<00:02:08.909> of<00:02:09.539> course<00:02:09.569> when<00:02:09.840> you<00:02:09.929> go<00:02:10.049> to<00:02:10.109> the

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:10.409 
and of course when you go to the

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:12.380 
and of course when you go to the
Imperial<00:02:11.099> age<00:02:11.219> you<00:02:11.430> can<00:02:11.579> still<00:02:11.849> do<00:02:11.999> the<00:02:12.150> same

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
Imperial age you can still do the same

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.899 
Imperial age you can still do the same
of<00:02:12.810> going<00:02:13.170> to<00:02:13.260> elite<00:02:13.469> talking<00:02:13.859> and<00:02:14.549> you<00:02:14.639> get<00:02:14.790> an

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:14.909 
of going to elite talking and you get an

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:17.449 
of going to elite talking and you get an
elite<00:02:15.120> talking<00:02:15.510> coming<00:02:15.930> out<00:02:16.170> and<00:02:17.040> they<00:02:17.310> have<00:02:17.340> a

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
elite talking coming out and they have a

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.989 
elite talking coming out and they have a
pretty<00:02:17.819> hefty<00:02:18.209> amount<00:02:18.629> of<00:02:18.900> hit<00:02:19.170> points<00:02:19.999> so

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:20.999 
pretty hefty amount of hit points so

00:02:20.999 --> 00:02:22.429 
pretty hefty amount of hit points so
that's<00:02:21.329> quite<00:02:21.510> useful<00:02:21.900> it's<00:02:22.200> very

00:02:22.429 --> 00:02:22.439 
that's quite useful it's very

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:25.729 
that's quite useful it's very
historically<00:02:23.219> relevant<00:02:23.909> I<00:02:24.299> suppose<00:02:24.599> but<00:02:25.590> then

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
historically relevant I suppose but then

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:29.990 
historically relevant I suppose but then
also<00:02:25.920> the<00:02:27.170> Imperial<00:02:28.170> age<00:02:28.340> technology<00:02:29.340> for<00:02:29.909> the

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
also the Imperial age technology for the

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.050 
also the Imperial age technology for the
Huns<00:02:30.209> atheism<00:02:31.250> it's<00:02:32.250> still<00:02:32.459> the<00:02:32.609> same<00:02:32.819> you

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
Huns atheism it's still the same you

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.879 
Huns atheism it's still the same you
have<00:02:33.389> a<00:02:33.569> next<00:02:33.780> 100<00:02:34.109> years<00:02:34.170> for<00:02:34.530> relic<00:02:34.769> and

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:34.889 
have a next 100 years for relic and

00:02:34.889 --> 00:02:39.259 
have a next 100 years for relic and

Wanda games and football the enemies and

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:42.020 
Wanda games and football the enemies and
spies<00:02:40.049> trees<00:02:40.560> and<00:02:40.769> technology<00:02:41.250> costs<00:02:41.519> fifty

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
spies trees and technology costs fifty

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.330 
spies trees and technology costs fifty
percent<00:02:42.659> less<00:02:42.989> and<00:02:43.260> for<00:02:43.889> the<00:02:43.980> same<00:02:44.129> matter

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
percent less and for the same matter

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.020 
percent less and for the same matter
12500<00:02:44.849> food<00:02:45.239> 500<00:02:45.780> gold<00:02:46.579> so<00:02:47.579> that's<00:02:47.760> quite<00:02:47.939> a

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
12500 food 500 gold so that's quite a

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.920 
12500 food 500 gold so that's quite a
nice<00:02:48.269> one<00:02:48.480> to<00:02:48.629> have<00:02:48.780> very<00:02:49.260> simple<00:02:49.650> very<00:02:50.930> as

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
nice one to have very simple very as

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.439 
nice one to have very simple very as
well<00:02:52.319> as<00:02:52.409> I<00:02:52.439> said<00:02:52.739> historically<00:02:53.340> relevant<00:02:53.549> so

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:54.449 
well as I said historically relevant so

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:56.479 
well as I said historically relevant so
thank<00:02:54.659> you<00:02:54.719> very<00:02:54.750> much<00:02:55.049> for<00:02:55.079> watching<00:02:55.290> I<00:02:55.829> just
