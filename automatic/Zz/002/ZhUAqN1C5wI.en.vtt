of stretch it and it falls into a groove
that<00:01:43.829> I<00:01:44.460> designed<00:01:45.060> over<00:01:45.329> here<00:01:45.570> especially<00:01:46.020> for

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
that I designed over here especially for

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.469 
that I designed over here especially for
this<00:01:46.740> leaves<00:01:47.040> and<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.759> same<00:01:47.970> thing<00:01:48.210> on<00:01:48.360> the

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
this leaves and the same thing on the

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.330 
this leaves and the same thing on the
other<00:01:48.509> side<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:49.229> it<00:01:49.350> locks<00:01:49.590> enter<00:01:49.920> into<00:01:50.130> a

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
other side and it locks enter into a

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.640 
other side and it locks enter into a
place<00:01:50.670> and

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:52.650 
place and

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.800 
place and
that<00:01:52.800> that<00:01:53.310> is<00:01:53.490> pretty<00:01:53.730> much<00:01:54.110> as<00:01:55.110> far<00:01:55.380> as<00:01:55.590> the

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
that that is pretty much as far as the

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
that that is pretty much as far as the
main<00:01:57.810> unit<00:01:58.290> I<00:01:59.030> did<00:02:00.030> I<00:02:00.270> took<00:02:00.330> a<00:02:00.590> liberté<00:02:01.590> to

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:01.830 
main unit I did I took a liberté to

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.630 
main unit I did I took a liberté to
install<00:02:02.370> this<00:02:03.120> part<00:02:03.420> before<00:02:04.220> so<00:02:05.220> there<00:02:05.520> is<00:02:05.610> a

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
install this part before so there is a

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.210 
install this part before so there is a
several<00:02:06.120> parts<00:02:06.450> as<00:02:06.570> you<00:02:06.690> can<00:02:06.870> see<00:02:07.140> that<00:02:07.920> comes

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
several parts as you can see that comes

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.990 
several parts as you can see that comes
with<00:02:08.550> it<00:02:08.759> and<00:02:09.000> one<00:02:09.179> of<00:02:09.210> the<00:02:09.420> part<00:02:09.750> is<00:02:09.990> a

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
with it and one of the part is a

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.270 
a hole and screw it in now we are
finishing<00:02:39.270> screwing<00:02:39.930> the<00:02:40.170> second<00:02:40.800> knob<00:02:41.010> in

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
finishing screwing the second knob in

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.340 
finishing screwing the second knob in
and<00:02:42.380> they<00:02:43.380> assembly<00:02:43.890> pretty<00:02:44.160> much<00:02:44.340> ready<00:02:44.610> for

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
and they assembly pretty much ready for

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:50.150 
and they assembly pretty much ready for
15<00:02:46.350> millimeter<00:02:46.800> rods<00:02:47.130> so<00:02:48.090> at<00:02:48.209> this<00:02:48.360> point<00:02:49.160> we

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
15 millimeter rods so at this point we

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.530 
15 millimeter rods so at this point we
are<00:02:50.190> inserting<00:02:51.709> the<00:02:52.709> rods<00:02:52.950> and<00:02:53.540> making

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
are inserting the rods and making

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.500 
are inserting the rods and making
advanced<00:02:55.530> adjustments<00:02:56.280> and<00:02:56.700> tighten<00:02:57.150> them<00:02:57.239> up

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
advanced adjustments and tighten them up

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:04.640 
advanced adjustments and tighten them up
like<00:02:58.320> this

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.770 

okay<00:03:05.650> and<00:03:05.920> now<00:03:06.100> the<00:03:06.160> part<00:03:06.790> I<00:03:06.940> just<00:03:06.970> assembled

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
okay and now the part I just assembled

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.560 
okay and now the part I just assembled
we're<00:03:08.140> going<00:03:08.380> to<00:03:08.820> actually<00:03:09.820> attach<00:03:09.910> to<00:03:10.420> the

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:10.570 
we're going to actually attach to the

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:14.070 
we're going to actually attach to the
rail<00:03:10.780> system<00:03:11.350> on<00:03:12.220> the<00:03:13.030> camera<00:03:13.420> so<00:03:13.690> all<00:03:13.930> I'm

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
rail system on the camera so all I'm

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.960 
rail system on the camera so all I'm
here<00:03:14.320> all<00:03:14.560> I<00:03:14.590> have<00:03:14.890> to<00:03:15.040> do<00:03:15.190> is<00:03:15.340> just<00:03:15.580> to<00:03:15.730> kind<00:03:15.940> of

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
here all I have to do is just to kind of

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
push it in a little bit make adjustments

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.120 
push it in a little bit make adjustments
and<00:03:19.720> give<00:03:20.470> it<00:03:20.590> a<00:03:21.540> untighten<00:03:22.540> don't<00:03:23.440> don't<00:03:23.800> make

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
and give it a untighten don't don't make
