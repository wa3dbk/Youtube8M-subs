00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:31.770

I<00:00:37.760> think<00:00:38.149> we<00:00:38.269> just<00:00:38.420> lacked<00:00:38.780> the<00:00:39.019> ball<00:00:39.289> movement

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:39.589 
I think we just lacked the ball movement

00:00:39.589 --> 00:00:43.899 
I think we just lacked the ball movement
and<00:00:40.039> the<00:00:40.699> energy<00:00:41.320> the<00:00:42.320> thrust<00:00:43.309> in<00:00:43.489> pace<00:00:43.670> that

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:43.909 
and the energy the thrust in pace that

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:46.149 
and the energy the thrust in pace that
we<00:00:44.059> played<00:00:44.510> with<00:00:44.659> the<00:00:44.750> first<00:00:45.050> time<00:00:45.230> did<00:00:45.979> you

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:46.159 
we played with the first time did you

00:00:46.159 --> 00:00:47.860 
we played with the first time did you
feel<00:00:46.579> like<00:00:46.729> over<00:00:47.149> there<00:00:47.239> was<00:00:47.359> a<00:00:47.390> sense<00:00:47.659> of

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
feel like over there was a sense of

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:49.750 
feel like over there was a sense of
complacency<00:00:48.530> with<00:00:48.890> Chris<00:00:49.129> Paul<00:00:49.370> not<00:00:49.579> out
