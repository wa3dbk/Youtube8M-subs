they were targeting before it was less

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:03.290 
they were targeting before it was less
of<00:07:01.770> a<00:07:01.950> priority<00:07:02.190> hopefully<00:07:02.850> now<00:07:03.000> that<00:07:03.030> they're

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:03.300 
of a priority hopefully now that they're

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:05.090 
of a priority hopefully now that they're
targeting<00:07:03.690> these<00:07:03.810> kind<00:07:04.050> of<00:07:04.110> high<00:07:04.500> end<00:07:04.710> users

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:05.100
