 in this new episode of ris low of 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.100
 the show that is there to give a 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:45.260
 second life to all these games that have us 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.640
 marked by the past and so today 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.079
 well, it is with great joy that 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.730
 will be able to go hunting 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:51.290
 dinosaurs and especially and well we're going 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.050
 find this good old nintendo 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:56.420
 64 to play a game that is this one 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:59.360
 to know turroques remember this 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.949
 good old years 1993 that we 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.559
 could for the first time see at 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:04.039
 cinema a certain movie called jurassic 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:05.449
 park 

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:06.770
 that good memories and we can say 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:09.140
 that at that time the dinosaur is 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.640
 become or come back in fashion either 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.170
 in cartoons the toys and 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.670
 even video games are from elsewhere 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.500
 that same year that iguana 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.869
 entertainment will release its first game 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.039
 on super nintendo and megadrive at and 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:21.140
 pink acrobats 

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:22.759
 after some games developed he decides 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.830
 to tackle a big fish in 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:26.929
 working with the publisher has claim on 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.330
 an adaptation of a comics in video games 

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:31.159
 turbo dinosaurs a mix of 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.200
 technology and nature everything is there for 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:34.819
 make a game with unique atmosphere that 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.020
 could stand out from the others 

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:38.209
 especially since the resources of the 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.940
 Nintendo 64 can create a 

00:01:38.209 --> 00:01:42.440
 vast and neat universe is so with 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.209
 this ambition that the creation of the game 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.250
 were companies taking advantage of the second 

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:48.979
 life of the work of rex matheson matthew 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.410
 h murphy paul newman and gaylord dubois 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:53.590
 because the series was taken over by 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:57.289
 the publishing house winning comics in 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.700
 1990 is thus in 1997 that the players 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:01.340
 can put their hands on the 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.280
 nintendo 64 and on this game that will us 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.869
 interesting rock dinosaur hunter the 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.640
 torch must be passed you are 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:09.200
 become the protector of the earth you 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.390
 are now turroques the hunter of 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.650
 dinosaurs made dinosaurs again 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.599
 an extinct race 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.500
 then it's clear that it promises true 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:17.500
 immediately in it's all that 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.670
 you control turbo an armed indian 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.439
 a bow and a knife that will have to 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.909
 eradicate the dinosaurs but not 

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:27.620
 only you will evolve into a 

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:29.090
 wild jungle looking for keys 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.799
 giving you access to all 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.790
 different levels of the game alternates 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:37.519
 so between forest temple cave forest 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.709
 in bigger forest rock temple but 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:41.359
 that's what we like so it goes 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:43.310
 so be question before anything else 

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:44.659
 exploration in very large 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.370
 environments maybe too much besides 

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:48.620
 happily the organized Indian that you 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.689
 are entitled to a small sum card 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.319
 all quite simple but that is enough to 

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:53.329
 herself 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:54.590
 good I imagine you already in the process of 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:55.849
 think this game is downright too 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.409
 ugly and that it looks to be design and 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:59.150
 with your feet but do not think again 

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:00.590
 already for the time we attended there 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.480
 graphically to a nice demonstration 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.439
 technical capabilities of the nintendo 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.180
 64 

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:07.099
 I remind you turroques is out 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.659
 when launching the console 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:10.790
 on the other hand he is a philosopher among 

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:12.590
 nicknamed you naraku who says one day that 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.669
 the best graphics card and 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.010
 imagination 

00:03:13.669 --> 00:03:17.480
 to meditate so the argument of this game is 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.950
 before all the immersion he's going to be 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.750
 fight hunting issue at the 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.579
 wild and so it is with great pleasure 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:26.530
 that we will be able to appreciate the quality of 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:26.530
 gameplay that wants to be nervous and effective 

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:30.889
 go come to you I hold knife but 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.629
 well there hop there is the little shot there 

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:34.159
 for the nation side of the did nothing like 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:35.599
 goethe in smoke the stern in the back to 

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:37.760
 aisles and come back come back we come to 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:41.780
 skiff end of Greek god was gone that's it 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:43.729
 this is a final cost to believe it 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.870
 almost run side of the game you 

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:46.879
 go as I meant to recover 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.739
 hidden keys skillfully in the 

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:50.629
 levels while ensuring that the 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:52.909
 maximum of your lives because yes the game over 

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:54.439
 Happily there are some points of 

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:56.120
 fairly regular backup and of course 

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:57.470
 checkpoints by the way death will be 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.120
 very often caused by a fall in 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.290
 the void both the playability raises concern 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.000
 in the platform phases 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.590
 if you do not look at your feet it is 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.449
 very hard to find your bearings as long as you 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:05.989
 have not gained a certain amount of 

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:07.459
 the remote 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:09.290
 luckily to help you you will 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:11.389
 items to pick up giving you a 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.979
 life all senses recover if you run away 

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:14.509
 was able to score the players it is also 

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:16.099
 for his dantesque boss fights 

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:18.380
 during which you will need 

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:19.789
 outdo note also the diversity 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.859
 weapons a big highlight for a 

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:22.710
 title which despite everything is posed as a 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:25.400
 alternative to 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:27.930
 me for fans of console fps 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.130
 this Turkish is a sacred game anyway and 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.870
 especially it's a damn hard game 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.400
 in my entourage besides for the 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.690
 little anecdote I know a lot of 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.520
 world having finished them but then by 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.650
 against they all used the codes 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.330
 because the game is too hard but good 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.550
 that did not stop his success in everything 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.050
 case and who says success says next and that's 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.030
 so what will we see immediately with 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:47.699
 the second episode called turroques 2 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:49.470
 this site offers a bowl first finding it 

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:50.880
 y to a solo but also to multi in order to 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.349
 shadowing the competition 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.060
 an asset that is added to 

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:56.039
 this nascent saga of the Turks 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.110
 so let's see what the solo offers 

00:04:56.039 --> 00:04:59.099
 attention on change of scenery 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.470
 to find yourself in an environment 

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:03.060
 a little more interior we find 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:04.320
 turroques who will have to fight against 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.940
 new creatures with always so much 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.889
 of liveliness the fights are always 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:09.660
 also nervous and you go of course 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:10.080
 retrieve new many 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:11.699
 arms 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.960
 besides you will notice the presence 

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:14.759
 a wheel that serves as a selection 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.380
 of weapons a well thought out system that 

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:18.270
 facilitate the transition from a weapon to 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:19.740
 the other in the heat of the action you 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:21.300
 note that enemy number fog 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.009
 1 of the games of the time is less 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.780
 present a big effort that place on 

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:27.060
 rock in the top fps in terms of 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:28.889
 techniques the adventurous long difficult 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.199
 and demanding you will need some 

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:32.580
 patience to overcome 

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:34.500
 thereafter two other games of the saga 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:36.990
 developed and edited by acclaim are 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.430
 released from rock free jazz and rock 3 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:40.380
 shadow of oblivion 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.909
 we still change environment but the 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:44.009
 principle remains the same the fans of the 

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:45.719
 many coming series of rock becomes 

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:47.159
 a very juicy license and we feel 

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:48.930
 that she is exploited until the 

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:50.550
 marrow there will be besides during this 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:52.320
 period equivalent Gameboy 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:53.610
 turroques game my modest faith but who 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.360
 will find their audience in the 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:56.699
 nomadic players 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:59.190
 it was not until 2002 that so 

00:05:56.699 --> 00:06:00.990
 on gamecube xbox and playstation 2 a 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:02.729
 new episode called turbo 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:04.020
 evolution this time we make ourselves well 

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:05.430
 account that the series after a little bang 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:06.000
 old and that it is not enough to 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:08.009
 herself 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.870
 the reception of the players will be mixed 

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:11.909
 some finding it too hard others 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:13.560
 anyway but we still find 

00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:14.699
 a few people who appreciated this 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:16.469
 game and have had a good time on 

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:18.539
 will be a little bit the same with the 

00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:21.539
 reboot of the saga you rock on pc 

00:06:18.539 --> 00:06:22.150
 xbox 360 and playstation 3 that tries to 

00:06:21.539 --> 00:06:23.740
 give a 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:25.810
 second wind at the license if the 

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:27.970
 critical wants murderous episode 

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:29.560
 will still find his audience 

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:31.270
 aside the dinosaur hunters warned 

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:33.400
 and will have been able to make the happiness of a lot 

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:34.420
 of people to return to the tyrol of the 

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:36.100
 nintendo 64 

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:38.230
 we can say what we want this sense of 

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:40.840
 games that still knew a lot 

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:42.700
 contributed to the development of fps on 

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:43.990
 console and in addition to that they are 

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:45.370
 games that are very immersive as I
