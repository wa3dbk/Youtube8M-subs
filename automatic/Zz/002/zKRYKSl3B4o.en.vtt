hello I'm Daniel Ballard I represent
precious<00:00:12.809> metals<00:00:13.170> West<00:00:13.410> today<00:00:14.280> I'm<00:00:14.940> going<00:00:15.059> to

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:15.180 
precious metals West today I'm going to

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:16.380 
precious metals West today I'm going to
show<00:00:15.330> you<00:00:15.389> what<00:00:15.840> goes

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:16.390

-<00:00:16.510> 14<00:00:17.170> karat<00:00:17.619> yellow<00:00:17.800> gold<00:00:18.900> jewelry<00:00:19.900> and

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:20.080 
- 14 karat yellow gold jewelry and

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.779 
- 14 karat yellow gold jewelry and
consumers<00:00:20.500> alike<00:00:20.680> wonder<00:00:21.250> what's<00:00:21.430> in<00:00:21.609> there

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:21.789 
consumers alike wonder what's in there

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:23.790 
consumers alike wonder what's in there
besides<00:00:22.029> that<00:00:22.539> 58<00:00:22.990> and<00:00:23.109> a<00:00:23.140> half<00:00:23.230> percent<00:00:23.439> gold

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:23.800 
besides that 58 and a half percent gold

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.550 
besides that 58 and a half percent gold
it's<00:00:23.980> in<00:00:24.099> 14<00:00:24.489> karat<00:00:24.820> so<00:00:25.509> before<00:00:26.259> we<00:00:26.380> actually

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:26.560 
it's in 14 karat so before we actually

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.409 
it's in 14 karat so before we actually
put<00:00:26.890> some<00:00:27.070> together<00:00:27.340> for<00:00:27.579> you<00:00:27.669> today<00:00:27.910> I<00:00:27.939> wanted

00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:28.419 
put some together for you today I wanted

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:31.109 
put some together for you today I wanted
to<00:00:28.509> show<00:00:28.689> you<00:00:28.750> what<00:00:28.989> all<00:00:29.109> goes<00:00:29.259> into<00:00:29.320> it<00:00:29.880> first

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:31.119 
to show you what all goes into it first

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:33.570 
to show you what all goes into it first
almost<00:00:31.480> all<00:00:31.750> the<00:00:31.899> gold<00:00:32.110> alloys<00:00:32.470> are<00:00:33.100> primarily

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:33.580 
almost all the gold alloys are primarily

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:36.750 
almost all the gold alloys are primarily
copper<00:00:34.089> very<00:00:35.080> pure<00:00:35.379> copper<00:00:35.650> oxygen<00:00:36.339> free<00:00:36.579> high

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:36.760 
copper very pure copper oxygen free high

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.720 
copper very pure copper oxygen free high
grade<00:00:37.059> and<00:00:37.600> then<00:00:37.839> we<00:00:37.960> make<00:00:38.140> some<00:00:38.170> grain<00:00:38.610> so<00:00:39.610> we

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:39.730 
grade and then we make some grain so we

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:40.710 
grade and then we make some grain so we
can<00:00:39.879> measure<00:00:40.030> it<00:00:40.239> accurately

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:40.720 
can measure it accurately

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.310 
can measure it accurately
the<00:00:41.500> next<00:00:41.829> most<00:00:42.790> common<00:00:42.940> ingredient<00:00:43.720> is

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:44.320 
the next most common ingredient is

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.189 
the next most common ingredient is
silver<00:00:44.829> always<00:00:45.489> in<00:00:45.699> 14<00:00:46.120> karat<00:00:46.390> yellow<00:00:46.420> alloy

00:00:47.189 --> 00:00:47.199 
silver always in 14 karat yellow alloy

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:49.500 
silver always in 14 karat yellow alloy
there's<00:00:47.620> some<00:00:47.769> silver<00:00:47.980> and<00:00:48.520> then<00:00:48.940> to<00:00:49.329> help

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510 
there's some silver and then to help

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.240 
there's some silver and then to help
that<00:00:49.660> nice<00:00:49.870> yellow<00:00:50.079> color<00:00:50.440> there's<00:00:50.829> some<00:00:50.980> zinc

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.250 
that nice yellow color there's some zinc

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.240 
that nice yellow color there's some zinc
zinc<00:00:51.550> is<00:00:52.480> interesting<00:00:52.989> because<00:00:53.710> when<00:00:54.010> you<00:00:54.100> mix

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:54.250 
zinc is interesting because when you mix

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:55.860 
zinc is interesting because when you mix
it<00:00:54.399> with<00:00:54.460> copper<00:00:54.760> you<00:00:55.269> actually<00:00:55.629> make<00:00:55.840> a

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:55.870 
it with copper you actually make a

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.660 
it with copper you actually make a
yellow<00:00:56.170> metal<00:00:56.350> called<00:00:56.710> brass<00:00:57.039> that<00:00:57.340> we<00:00:57.460> see

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 
yellow metal called brass that we see

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.610 
yellow metal called brass that we see
around<00:00:57.760> all<00:00:58.090> the<00:00:58.210> time<00:00:58.420> but<00:00:59.170> we<00:00:59.320> need<00:00:59.500> the

00:00:59.610 --> 00:00:59.620 
around all the time but we need the

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.490 
around all the time but we need the
silver<00:00:59.829> to<00:01:00.730> make<00:01:00.850> a<00:01:00.879> good<00:01:01.090> gold<00:01:01.359> alloy<00:01:01.539> when<00:01:02.350> we

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:02.500 
silver to make a good gold alloy when we

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.520 
silver to make a good gold alloy when we
mix<00:01:02.679> those<00:01:02.890> together<00:01:03.839> in<00:01:04.839> a<00:01:04.960> lot<00:01:05.170> of<00:01:05.199> quantity

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.530 
mix those together in a lot of quantity

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.880 
mix those together in a lot of quantity
with<00:01:05.979> a<00:01:06.009> lot<00:01:06.280> of<00:01:06.310> heat<00:01:06.640> and<00:01:07.149> in<00:01:07.990> a<00:01:08.020> great<00:01:08.619> big

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
with a lot of heat and in a great big

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.249 
with a lot of heat and in a great big
crucible<00:01:09.429> like<00:01:09.610> this<00:01:09.880> at<00:01:10.119> the<00:01:10.720> end<00:01:10.869> we'll<00:01:11.050> pour

00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:11.259 
crucible like this at the end we'll pour

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:15.320 
crucible like this at the end we'll pour
600<00:01:11.860> ounces<00:01:11.979> of<00:01:12.369> alloy<00:01:12.729> out<00:01:13.030> when<00:01:13.899> that's<00:01:14.110> done

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
600 ounces of alloy out when that's done

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.419 
600 ounces of alloy out when that's done
and<00:01:16.330> it's<00:01:17.140> dried<00:01:17.410> the<00:01:17.619> alloy<00:01:17.770> looks<00:01:18.130> a<00:01:18.250> lot

00:01:18.419 --> 00:01:18.429 
and it's dried the alloy looks a lot

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:20.460 
and it's dried the alloy looks a lot
like<00:01:18.610> this<00:01:18.880> and<00:01:19.149> this<00:01:19.240> is<00:01:19.420> exactly<00:01:19.600> the<00:01:20.140> alloy

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.470 
like this and this is exactly the alloy

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:22.859 
like this and this is exactly the alloy
that<00:01:20.829> gets<00:01:20.979> mixed<00:01:21.220> with<00:01:21.369> the<00:01:22.060> 24<00:01:22.540> karat<00:01:22.840> gold

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:22.869 
that gets mixed with the 24 karat gold

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:24.690 
that gets mixed with the 24 karat gold
and<00:01:23.290> we're<00:01:23.710> going<00:01:23.829> to<00:01:23.860> see<00:01:24.040> that<00:01:24.189> happen<00:01:24.579> in

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
and we're going to see that happen in

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.780 
and we're going to see that happen in
just<00:01:25.240> a<00:01:25.329> few<00:01:25.479> minutes
