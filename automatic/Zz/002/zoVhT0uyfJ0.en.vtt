there's<00:02:22.590> no<00:02:22.680> real<00:02:23.129> differences<00:02:24.000> i<00:02:24.120> think<00:02:24.299> the

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
there's no real differences i think the

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:25.789 
there's no real differences i think the
caller<00:02:24.659> might<00:02:25.019> have<00:02:25.230> a<00:02:25.260> little<00:02:25.530> bit<00:02:25.650> of<00:02:25.680> a

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:25.799 
caller might have a little bit of a

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:30.289 
caller might have a little bit of a
different<00:02:26.099> paint<00:02:26.340> job<00:02:26.640> on<00:02:26.879> it<00:02:27.560> um<00:02:28.560> I<00:02:28.940> mean<00:02:29.940> it's

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
different paint job on it um I mean it's

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:33.350 
different paint job on it um I mean it's
a<00:02:30.420> decent<00:02:30.870> canine<00:02:31.760> it's<00:02:32.760> not<00:02:32.909> exactly

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
a decent canine it's not exactly

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:40.369 
a decent canine it's not exactly
accurate<00:02:33.659> to<00:02:34.470> the<00:02:35.000> show<00:02:36.000> but<00:02:36.989> I<00:02:37.760> mean<00:02:39.379> the

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:40.379 
accurate to the show but I mean the

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:44.089 
accurate to the show but I mean the
accuracy<00:02:40.829> of<00:02:40.860> Cana<00:02:41.370> and<00:02:41.700> color<00:02:42.209> to<00:02:43.110> the<00:02:43.379> 70s<00:02:43.890> is

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
accuracy of Cana and color to the 70s is

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:45.949 
accuracy of Cana and color to the 70s is
not<00:02:44.280> really<00:02:44.549> something<00:02:44.730> i'm<00:02:45.120> too<00:02:45.569> worried

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
not really something i'm too worried

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:51.080 
not really something i'm too worried
about<00:02:47.569> so<00:02:48.569> that's<00:02:48.780> pretty<00:02:49.379> much<00:02:49.470> it<00:02:49.890> on<00:02:50.549> canine

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
know when I start out by saying that

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.509 
know when I start out by saying that
there's<00:03:00.420> a<00:03:00.480> little<00:03:00.810> black<00:03:01.140> smudge<00:03:01.769> of<00:03:01.799> glue<00:03:02.489> on

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
there's a little black smudge of glue on

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:04.250 
there's a little black smudge of glue on
his<00:03:02.760> nose<00:03:03.030> I<00:03:03.359> tried<00:03:03.569> getting<00:03:03.810> off<00:03:03.989> of<00:03:04.140> my

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
his nose I tried getting off of my

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.559 
his nose I tried getting off of my
fingernail<00:03:04.739> i<00:03:04.980> can't<00:03:05.940> i'm<00:03:06.180> gonna<00:03:06.329> have<00:03:06.420> to

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569

um<00:03:13.260> that's<00:03:13.620> what<00:03:13.859> that<00:03:13.980> it's<00:03:14.459> not<00:03:14.640> really<00:03:14.909> a

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
um that's what that it's not really a

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.569

the scarf isn't that accurate um it's

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:49.060 
the scarf isn't that accurate um it's
definitely<00:06:46.850> not<00:06:46.970> as<00:06:47.150> colorful<00:06:47.590> but<00:06:48.590> you<00:06:48.950> know

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:49.070 
definitely not as colorful but you know

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:52.420 
definitely not as colorful but you know
it<00:06:49.310> gets<00:06:49.430> the<00:06:49.640> point<00:06:49.670> across<00:06:49.940> and<00:06:51.220> mostly<00:06:52.220> it

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:52.430 
it gets the point across and mostly it

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:55.120
