00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:06.240
 in this second report on playstation 3 we will show how to connect 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.850
 our internet console without getting the so-called horror of the dncd and the 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:14.309
 Blissful sling type 3 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.730
 for this the first thing we must do is understand the computer 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.710
 to know the wireless configuration of it 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.970
 we then go to the taskbar and think twice 

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:27.470
 on the icon in the form of a mini computer screen 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.579
 and in the upper part of the newly opened window 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:33.700
 we go to the support tab and then to details 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.840
 to be shown to us was the kitchen 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.190
 then we collect this data 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:40.200
 sergio miter 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.790
 Default Gateway 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.790
 ben s 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.380
 already with the data obtained if we do not want the ps3 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.000
 nobody the q3 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.320
 we have to open all the ports that appear on the screen 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.940
 of course each cruise 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.590
 so if we want to know how we can open them 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.590
 let's hope to access the abc Latvian website 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.640
 we choose or manual rupert grint 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.510
 Once the ports are open, we pass 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.770
 sources in the newton the mossad 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.120
 settings regretted connection settings 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.920
 we select wireless to an artist scanner and legitimize sample 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.230
 and if we have the wep encryption key 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.230
 the latter what is 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.580
 When the director called us we are going to judge experts 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:38.750
 and to the signature not to him 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.040
 then put everything we trust at the beginning 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.450
 yes in the ip address 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.450
 the final number we will have to put a higher figure 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:49.480
 the computer is indicated 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.760
 then we were to accept that approve it 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.600
 and with a little bit of luck 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.780
 we have achieved our goal to have wireless internet connection mind 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.780
 and without adjudicating 3 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:08.270
 if on the contrary we do not have wireless connection so the steps of this 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.579
 vice until you are open 

00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:13.879
 although the financial sector 

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:17.759
 for the console itself to configure the connection 

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:18.779
 It is done 

00:02:18.779 --> 00:02:21.779
 niland internet ready to be used 

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:26.689
 although we hope that this article has served you for something 

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:30.290
