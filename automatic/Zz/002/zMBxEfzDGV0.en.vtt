00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:11.880
 hello welcome to the code of the 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.650
 route point fr I am christine your 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.870
 instructor and today we are going 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.870
 to approach the subject of the friendly report 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:23.390
 so compared to the friendly report on 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.019
 will see how to write it correctly 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:29.640
 and some tips on that 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:32.550
 so first of all you have a finding 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.309
 amiable who is european 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.630
 that is, all the members of the 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.070
 European community have the same 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.550
 finding except that it is obviously in 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.680
 their tongue 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.050
 so from the moment we are going to have 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.360
 an accident with another member of the 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.370
 of the European community we will have 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.470
 just fill in we will not need 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:54.860
 to learn the language 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:59.260
 so you have first at level 2 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:02.350
 from the top one has to fill well 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.940
 the vehicles the date the place where 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.130
 past the offense that happened 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.140
 the accident excuse me or it happened 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.399
 the accident so that's one in mind 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.340
 that we have to fill in and that is very 

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:15.549
 important because it's going to help 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.869
 possibly the insurer to know 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:19.539
 exactly where the accident happened 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:20.710
 then you logically have to 

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:22.149
 vehicles 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.220
 so compared to these two vehicles 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:26.880
 so you mark all your details 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:29.710
 the other will also mark his coordinates 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.479
 then you have we will ask you 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.520
 so at the level of your gray card 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:34.450
 your insurance know the person because 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.009
 that it is not obliged that is the 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.440
 person who drive the person from 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:41.679
 owner of the vehicle you are going to 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.750
 note that too then here too 

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:46.360
 have to note so this is at the level of 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.700
 its 2 columns is mostly 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.950
 indications in relation to you by 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.929
 report to a vehicle gray card 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.340
 insurance etc 

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:57.069
 then you have a little painting 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.869
 in relation to the point of impact of the shock 

00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:00.340
 so you have to try to be anyway 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:01.569
 the most evasive possible because 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.149
 times you can have a shock side 

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:06.129
 lateral and at the level of the bumper and 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:08.050
 then in fact its a pact it's a 

00:02:06.129 --> 00:02:09.489
 impact especially the front so if by 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.230
 example you had a shock before where 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:13.569
 you do a little cross obviously 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.420
 these places I knew a shock before 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:18.160
 you make a little cross on the front 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.650
 of the bumper and it shows that 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.959
 the crash took place the shock took place at 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.340
 this place 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:27.280
 then you have little crosses so 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.959
 there you have several situations so 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.080
 always choose the simplest at 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:34.390
 level of situations and in the end you 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.090
 note the number of 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.400
 the number of crosses you made 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.870
 so six admit I know I was stationary 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.640
 for example makes a cross I 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.380
 stationed and after if you do not 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.270
 only one cross you just put a 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.709
 so you put the number of crosses well 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.200
 like that at the insurance level 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:52.920
 they will look exactly if that 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.910
 corresponds then you have 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.390
 possibly the possibility of doing 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.010
 a drawing 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.959
 but be careful that they are not 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.220
 not to your detriment because if you 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.690
 make a drawing like what you have 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.070
 overtaken by the right and that you put 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.290
 not the gentleman who put his flashing 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:06.510
 left to turn and not see that 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.080
 voice storage etc. 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.100
 automatically we will tell you but 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.330
 you did not go over to the right 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.709
 and it's you who will take all the 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.970
 wrongs so that's why it takes 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:14.230
 pay attention to the drawing level and 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.450
 drawing is not an obligation 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.250
 so you have to pay attention to the drawings 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.380
 and then if you have annotations 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.570
 to note observations it must not be 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.519
 hesitate on your amicable report you 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.680
 have a second part behind who 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:30.130
 so lets that there is no double 1 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:32.410
 above but that makes it possible to note some 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.610
 for example if there are witnesses etc you 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:36.220
 can note the names and addresses of 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.650
 witnesses in relation to this 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.269
 more will be complete if you are not 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.380
 not even more will be complete and less 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:43.269
 you will have difficulties with 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.489
 your insurance to justify this 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:48.010
 accident 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:50.519
 then you have the findings the 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.870
 advice then at the level of advice 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:55.420
 to save time so I come back 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.130
 on the drawing to win the 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.350
 time you have to try to prepare it in 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.489
 head because from the moment when 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.950
 you have an accident especially as 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:04.750
 that young driver so good it's okay 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:08.320
 worry a little bit 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:10.150
 you carve a little bit so if you 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:11.260
 look for your gray card you are looking for 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.190
 your license you are looking for your 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.840
 insurance etc 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.550
 you risk making mistakes at 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.829
 level of writing from the moment 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:18.970
 where she is prepared in advance 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:20.380
 automatically you're quiet 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.850
 it's done is prepared so 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.560
 eventually if you notice it there 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.210
 and that the person with whom you had 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.130
 the accident wants at all costs the column 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.120
 blue in the worst case according to you have 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.530
 just arnaud you are what you have 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.700
 marked on your finding so you 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:32.110
 save time and you do not have 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.310
 need to scare you to search 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.860
 all your documents etc 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:38.050
 there is a contraindication versus 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.010
 to the obligation to sign normally if 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.120
 you do not agree with the 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:41.770
 person who is in front of you 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:45.280
 logically you do not have the obligation 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:47.230
 signed after there will be people 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.610
 who will tell you yes you are obliged to 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:50.500
 sign otherwise it is not valid 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.180
 it is true that from the moment of 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.280
 sign that means you are 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.630
 agree with the finding so if you 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.240
 really have a disagreement with the 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:59.200
 tale with the other driver 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.180
 I personally advise you to 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.500
 do not sign after trying to you 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.090
 get closer to your insurance to see 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.500
 than what you advise because at 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:07.120
 from the moment you sign and that 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:09.190
 you feel that you agree with 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.810
 the finding you can no longer come back in 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:11.919
 back 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:13.150
 no obligation to draw 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:14.919
 as I told you before 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:16.930
 that's also important because if 

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:19.420
 you make a drawing that is not 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:22.060
 correct automatically that it's going to 

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:23.680
 it will play against you and possibilities 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.510
 so note the dolphin complements 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.220
 information on the back as I tell you 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:29.470
 said just now to be able to 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:31.150
 have a maximum of information by 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:31.840
 report to an accident then me what 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.880
 I advise young drivers 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:35.260
 has often given you that you have 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.130
 always a laptop with lots of 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.410
 contacts inside 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:40.090
 put the number of your insurer 

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:42.190
 because from the moment you have 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:44.470
 an accident so obviously in the day 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:45.610
 working business office hours they 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:46.780
 can always advise you 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:48.250
 obviously even if they are not on 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.810
 the accident that did not see the situation 

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:52.990
 they can advise you a little bit 

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:54.550
 to complete this observation and do not hesitate 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:55.930
 possibly call your parents or if 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:58.150
 you have people who are in the 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:59.620
 street they say yes I know 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:02.290
 fill a statement do not hesitate to you 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:03.430
 get help be careful of if you 

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:04.810
 are not wrong times you go 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:06.250
 have the person in front of you who is going 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:07.540
 see a young driver and who goes in 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:08.590
 maybe enjoy a little bit of 

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:10.270
 people who are a bit used to doing 

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:12.220
 findings and that will happen a 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:13.870
 a little bit screaming, raising your arms 

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:15.880
 you know that might disturb you 

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:16.840
 a little bit so you risk yourself 

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:17.830
 risk making mistakes at 

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:20.590
 of your amicable report 

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:22.270
 so pay special attention to his thanks

 to have followed this video hoping 

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:27.420
 that it will be useful to you soon on 

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.420
 code of the road point fr 

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:35.370
