00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 Hello dear friends with you i'm eric 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:09.179
 seasons is a gameplay review on the game 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.320
 xcom enemy within hryvnia in general ggg as 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.620
 you were taught at school 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.049
 Well, the United States, this game is 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:18.539
 addition can say a little 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.779
 continuation of the game xcom and us a noun and 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:24.539
 gameplay and mainstream 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.910
 the toy itself is very similar 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.849
 on its predecessor, well worth it 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.189
 immediately mark this time the developers 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:33.930
 made a complete Russian localization then 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.440
 there is everything here translated into Russian 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.870
 language is a huge plus game and this 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.090
 she is better than her predecessor who 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.219
 somewhere a few months ago about 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.399
 Russia niche fearing spring 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:50.010
 also pleased us with the release of android 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.500
 here we will also play turn-based 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.350
 But in such battles to move 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.960
 actually according to his location 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:01.590
 arrange various sabotage against 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:05.280
 aliens who captured themselves 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.590
 our world and therefore all people of all countries 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.510
 of the world united and decided to bring 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.130
 order and show who is real 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:16.110
 master and who is the real folder here and 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.299
 so we found 1 alien 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.610
 which he moves someone over there 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.369
 by the way destroyed we will have it by the way 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.950
 also neutralize otherwise we will also 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:29.759
 quite problematic, and we have such extra 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:32.520
 problems are understandably not needed 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.799
 The graphics in the game are high enough and 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.369
 everything looks very very beautiful with 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.720
 using a drink that can zoom 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:41.549
 respectively zoom in and out 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.020
 camera all those 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.000
 This is done very conveniently so that 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.649
 turning the camera gives in is 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.200
 special buttons left and right 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.780
 which will allow you to rotate the camera by 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.520
 clockwise you can also choose 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.810
 your character's weapon 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:59.280
 as for weapons, here you are 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.950
 can improve and upgrade 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.780
 respectively on its military base 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.119
 to switch between players 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.489
 you must click on the icon with their 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.660
 names and then you will switch 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:13.210
 between existing 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:16.630
 units and accordingly make your 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:19.420
 tactical different moves in order 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.100
 so you can walk in order to 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.770
 move must do everything 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:26.230
 only double tap you have different 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.840
 tasks find a container and accordingly 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:31.420
 pick it up well, that the container is 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:35.290
 we found try with him something 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:38.500
 do try to pick it up so 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.660
 Vasiliev your information is understandable but 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.030
 if you like all the moves finished 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.370
 press the cross press ok 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:48.040
 your turn is completed. 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:51.580
 i.e. the alien moves 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:53.860
 and accordingly trying to attack you 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.950
 yes it was really unexpected then 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:59.080
 that an alien can break through the glass and 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.970
 most hit and hit us 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.650
 additional damage so let's 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.720
 try this time to capture 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.120
 the transmitter may be at this time at least 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.920
 get him to take 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:12.370
 No, for some reason, this transmitter does not want 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:14.410
 therefore probably will have to be taken then 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:18.340
 go to battle and try to win 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:21.550
 This fiend space so choose 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.310
 character and let's try to go 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:27.280
 somewhere closer 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:29.110
 graphics animation is all up to par 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.180
 allocates a toy probably of all 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.790
 similar tactical strategies that 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.100
 there is on android and indeed xcom was 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.570
 probably one of the best probably and 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:41.230
 is one of the best 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:43.570
 tactical strategies and so the game is by 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.640
 deserve the title of the best 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:48.400
 tactical strategy for android game 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:50.739
 nice and interesting and enjoy 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.230
 only those who really want to 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:55.570
 long and seriously plunge into the game 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:58.060
 process so if you like 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:59.200
 tactical strategies love games with 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.200
