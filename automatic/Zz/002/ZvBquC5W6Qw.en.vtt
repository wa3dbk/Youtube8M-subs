00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:08.730
 Hello viewers and subscribers of the channel 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.469
 Snake with you 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.509
 and today we will talk about better 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.959
 Stephen King's screen versions since 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.790
 shines i'm talking about the movie 1408 shoot 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:20.010
 film adaptation is very complicated and 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:22.350
 often not very profitable but take off 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.460
 film adaptation of the story like 1408 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.320
 difficult doubly 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.060
 firstly because the story is too 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.590
 short for full chronization 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.900
 and secondly because there is little in it 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.030
 events and it is based on emotions and 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.339
 experiences of the protagonist being 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.710
 in the country of the hotel room passing one 

00:00:35.339 --> 00:00:39.059
 after another all the circles of hell but swedish 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.059
 director mikael hofstrÃ¶m 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.039
 it was possible and very successfully important 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.260
 all did not lose the director this statement 

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:48.570
 on the lead role of john cusack he 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.309
 amazing playing and easily capable of 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.589
 alone draw the viewer's attention to 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.239
 screen throughout the entire movie in 

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:55.109
 lately, the kings have not been lucky with 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.530
 screen adaptations 

00:00:55.109 --> 00:01:00.449
 things needed secret window dream catcher 1408 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.149
 perhaps the first film on creativity 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.650
 the horror king who cannot be called 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:07.050
 mediocre though in essence 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.200
 the concept of the film is horribly trite it 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.790
 haunted house trivial this 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.010
 can only be a road thriller about 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.380
 wicked youth wilderness with 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.510
 maniac come up with some new plot 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.370
 on the topic of portrait in the house is almost unreal 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.530
 but steven king has always been a master 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:24.120
 your genre and from any banal idea 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.950
 he is able to make a masterpiece 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.290
 the protagonist of the film is my writers 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.660
 kensin author of many sensational novels 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.640
 genre horrors in search of new ideas he 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.440
 traveling around the country and exploring places 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.240
 where the paranormal phenomenon was observed 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.010
 mike skeptic not believing in 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.990
 plausibility most heard 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:42.270
 and then transferred from an and history 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.020
 a trip to the hotel dolphin is absolutely nothing 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.390
 didn't foretell 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.250
 another country number where for many years 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.110
 no one stopped due to the fact that 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.510
 he is rumored to be haunted and 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.370
 all sorts of horrible things happen despite 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:55.770
 on the prayers and requests of the hotel manager 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:58.200
 Gerald who incidentally played Alina 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.170
 samuel l jackson ensny still populates 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.690
 in the ill-fated 408 as you understand through 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.450
 half an hour from past cynicism and skepticism not 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.399
 left and trace 1408 is the very 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.229
 A rare example when a film attracts 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.790
 its magic atmosphere that most 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.720
 I wonder you do not aim 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.580
 scare the viewer fear it with 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.440
 and only a means a goal in my opinion 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.930
 show what consequences can 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.280
 bring human cockroaches in your head 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.200
 how much can life break 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.480
 some kind of fear some kind of stale from 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.190
 pain or phobia until the person finds himself 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.740
 the strength to join their fears in the fight 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.180
 relive them go on every minute 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.010
 films drags to the surface 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.290
 some subconsciously human 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.000
 fear and touches him as long as you 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.820
 you will not find a piece of fear in yourself 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.650
 we all have a lot of phobias but few 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.990
 who is truly afraid of a zombie or 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.970
 Monsters, but I think heights are afraid 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:48.580
 many some do not tolerate narrow 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.260
 premises or are afraid to drown the film as if 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.870
 pulls all these fears out of the depths 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.450
 our childhood our fantasies and lends 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.550
 their specific shape is probably the main thing 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.410
 what touches the movie is that all of his 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.510
 throughout the viewer binds the sensation 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.970
 anxiety and anxiety she pursues 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.370
 every second bewitching and do not let 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.720
 break away from what is happening on the screen 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.250
 interesting that until the very end we 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.350
 debt does not make it clear that in general 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.180
 River number happens so 8 whether 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.640
 this is all as usual the main character dreams 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.350
 whether it actually happens in king 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.360
 Vskih organizations generally lurks a lot 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.190
 unexplained most likely 100 per sheets 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.900
 also interested in giving 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.880
 viewers to think out what happened 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.650
 because in this case, our time he can 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.480
 present thousands of different options 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.160
 the continuation of events is impossible 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.530
 show in one thriller 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.120
 an hour and a half by the way as for the final 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.280
 the film has three 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.900
 Alternative ending I am extremely happy 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.820
 that for the official version chosen on 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.470
 my opinion is the strongest of them coming up 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:43.690
 By the end I would like to note that the film 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.850
 looked great at the box office as 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.739
 in america and around the world reaching out 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.720
 honorable 130 million dollars 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:51.730
 By the way, for a long time already, the adaptation of king 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.680
 enjoyed such noise oblique success 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.450
 remember only the last film adaptation 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.500
 riding a bullet that banged 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.180
 failed at the box office 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.070
 overall the film left a very strong 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.810
 impression and I can still long 

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:04.180
 talk about the press and this picture 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.920
 but perhaps just say if you have a fan 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.239
 stephen king or just love 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.430
 quality horror movies 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:11.200
 but have already forgotten that this is what you need here. 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.549
 if you want to look exactly 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.410
 psychological thriller 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:17.019
 they cover Vichy and tasteless horror 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:19.900
 hostel style then you are all the more here 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:22.120
 snow blood is overly violent and there is only 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.919
 deep atmosphere abundance of original 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.440
 directorial techniques and brilliant game 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:27.280
 john cusack thank you all for your attention with 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.320
 you were a snake
