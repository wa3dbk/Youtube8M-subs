00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:10.769
 So they are lucy and they have one 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.889
 problem with her aggression 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.550
 to bring control 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:20.550
 Do not think it's music video 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:24.020
 They are always called now 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.020
 behind the program 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.789
 So I had to have confused something 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:34.340
 there is also a completely different disorder 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.340
 why are you limiting a pokemon? 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:47.910
 So that's what they know 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:51.079
 aggression what is an action 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:54.480
 you can tell me that is completely 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.730
 typical behavior is not active 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.260
 experience 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.149
 So honestly, I think theirs 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.620
 Aggression not so bad now 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.570
 I think you have to 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.210
 but it's not like that 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.470
 If he would tear my head off right away 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.560
 a fight against me is something like that 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.119
 win with her short arm to be there 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.200
 We will not be out of the blue 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:20.430
 angry because we always get so angry when 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.530
 we ask so shit poses ok and and 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.350
 if they are there so angry to think what 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.320
 she then that all kag people shit 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:32.430
 are like they are here 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:35.810
 okay maybe a bit redundant though 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.810
 not so bad 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:46.430
 like a tomato devious to the 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.430
 dearest only surrounded by incompetence 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:44.180
 am I just incompetence surrounded us 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.180
 surround
