 ball that corresponds to the set 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.319
 Uruguayan 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:08.410
 take a breath at the national stadium 

00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:11.170
 for the Chileans when from the bottom 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:13.389
 will leave fernando very well place it 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:15.129
 outside the area we are entering the 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:16.930
 10th minute of the first time clearer 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:19.060
 chili at least of collective game 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:20.650
 ball from the bottom of müller long 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.480
 sending up looking for the rise of 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.160
 edison cavani then there are the mine pipes 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.930

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.580
 total domain of Chilean teams by 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:29.230
 at least with the ball is not reflected 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.000
 still on the scoreboard but it's going 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.920
 upwards he goes to look for gastón 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.840
 ramirez runs eduardo vargas cabecilla 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.219
 pivot and there comes comes number 11 not 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.289
 mark none of them is eduardo 

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:39.789
 Vargas per street with the middle one but it's 

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:41.350
 touching to the left so that both 

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:43.510
 they leave it halfway 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.100
 aguirregaray is left with a couple touches the 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.550
 ball in the area voices over the center 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.550
 collection 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.380
 yes 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.909
 with the departure of the Uruguayan team in 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:09.920
 Hiss the ball halfway in 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:11.570
 the regions and both were lifted 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.490
 cent and then a bad clearance of the 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.159
 athletic to the elusive esteban walls 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:23.440
 ladies and gentlemen we counted in the minute 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:23.440
 11 in the 11th minute of the first 100 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:33.440
 an error shared a Chinese team that 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.510
 was more first aguirregaray that was going to 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.300
 look for a ball that gives a certain bounce 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.980
 that leaves very weak locks the 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.090
 balls that arrives on the iata knows 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:44.150
 on the left 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.670
 ends by bouncing the stick 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:49.040
 pereira has walls to spend 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.800
 in pushing the Chilean set was more 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:54.380
 it did not weigh so much in the clear area when 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.000
 he started having so many gifts one of the 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.650
 right lateral aguirregaray and the other 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.840
 of the theoreticians was to see them pereira 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.570
 well said with so much gift I have to 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.330
 take advantage of it wins the red 1 to 0 uruguay 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.680
 that did not spend half the court here 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.940
 come an end I saw the ball towards the 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.530
 half you look chili three quarters of 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.540
 court eduardo vargas for matías 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.220
 Fernández manages it nuanced he plays well 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.580
 care comes the second of Chile the 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.580
 ball 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:37.329
 again errors in the celestial background of 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:40.329
 neighborhood that fernando molina does not find 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:46.109
 eduardo vargas ladies and gentlemen when 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:46.109
 we were at minute 33 36 seconds 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.780
 there is night that nothing comes out there is night 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.250
 the rebounds always have a team 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.380
 and today was the case of the selection 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.910
 Chilean the most complicated moment of 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.490
 match after a heads up that 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:08.190
 ends up getting the goalie well 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:10.320
 but the bounce is clear to vargas 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:13.440
 to mark the second to settle the 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:15.030
 match after a good hand in the 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.460
 in front of the muslera goalkeeper 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.170
 winning goalkeeper but heavenly 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:21.300
 clear the forward bounce that 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.310
 it is the eleven that accompanied well the 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.740
 play and the former man of the 'u' of chile 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.900
 vargas that pushes it simply the 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:30.990
 sends the most complicated moment to the bottom 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.970
 of the game to the Chilean team because 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:35.100
 Uruguay was close the draw appeared 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:40.160
 vargas appeared the second appears the 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:40.160
 goal 2 to 0 to 12 minutes from the end
