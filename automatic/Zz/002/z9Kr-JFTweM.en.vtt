rides and Buddy who started to make a
design<00:00:38.309> process<00:00:38.579> yeah<00:00:38.999> but<00:00:39.179> that's<00:00:39.269> it<00:00:39.600> then

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:39.749 
design process yeah but that's it then

00:00:39.749 --> 00:00:42.919 
design process yeah but that's it then
next<00:00:39.929> week<00:00:40.730> because<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:42.059> relic<00:00:42.359> changes<00:00:42.780> in

00:00:42.919 --> 00:00:42.929 
next week because the relic changes in

00:00:42.929 --> 00:00:45.950 
next week because the relic changes in
the<00:00:43.140> round<00:00:43.379> we<00:00:44.309> work<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:45.030> what<00:00:45.420> separates<00:00:45.809> us

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
the round we work to what separates us

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.450 
the round we work to what separates us
from<00:00:46.019> most<00:00:46.320> theaters<00:00:46.589> is<00:00:46.829> that<00:00:46.949> we<00:00:47.070> work<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.429> a

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
from most theaters is that we work to a

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.970 
from most theaters is that we work to a
television<00:00:48.089> standard<00:00:48.539> because<00:00:48.960> everyone<00:00:49.769> can

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
television standard because everyone can

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.610 
television standard because everyone can
see<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.489> hair<00:00:50.699> from<00:00:50.940> every<00:00:51.390> single<00:00:51.569> angle<00:00:51.899> so

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
see the hair from every single angle so

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.049 
see the hair from every single angle so
if<00:00:52.710> anything<00:00:52.949> is<00:00:53.100> wrong<00:00:53.339> with<00:00:53.519> it<00:00:53.670> it<00:00:53.819> will<00:00:54.030> be

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
if anything is wrong with it it will be

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.849 
if anything is wrong with it it will be
seen<00:00:54.449> and<00:00:54.719> reported

00:00:56.849 --> 00:00:56.859 
seen and reported

00:00:56.859 --> 00:00:59.040 
seen and reported
but<00:00:57.760> with<00:00:57.909> this<00:00:58.089> way<00:00:58.359> the<00:00:58.539> notes<00:00:58.690> we<00:00:58.870> keep

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.050 
but with this way the notes we keep

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.270 
but with this way the notes we keep
getting<00:00:59.320> back<00:00:59.469> from<00:00:59.679> the<00:00:59.829> designer<00:01:00.159> of

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
getting back from the designer of

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.829 
getting back from the designer of
