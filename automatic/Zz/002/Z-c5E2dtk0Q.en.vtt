leaves<00:00:23.460> make<00:00:23.760> great<00:00:24.180> mulch<00:00:24.630> because<00:00:25.050> they

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
leaves make great mulch because they

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.439 
leaves make great mulch because they
break<00:00:25.470> down<00:00:25.529> slowly<00:00:26.160> over<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:27.000> course<00:00:27.210> of<00:00:27.330> a

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
break down slowly over the course of a

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.179 
break down slowly over the course of a
season<00:00:27.689> and<00:00:28.050> they<00:00:28.140> add<00:00:28.289> nutrients<00:00:29.070> and

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
season and they add nutrients and

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.740 
season and they add nutrients and
organic<00:00:29.250> matter<00:00:29.670> back<00:00:30.000> to<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.210> soil<00:00:30.420> and

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
organic matter back to the soil and

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.749 
organic matter back to the soil and
they're<00:00:30.929> great<00:00:31.260> for<00:00:31.560> worms<00:00:31.710> worms<00:00:32.130> just<00:00:32.460> love

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
they're great for worms worms just love

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.569 
they're great for worms worms just love
to<00:00:33.030> live<00:00:33.210> under<00:00:33.510> a<00:00:33.540> nice<00:00:33.750> layer<00:00:34.050> of<00:00:34.140> leaves<00:00:34.579> the

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
to live under a nice layer of leaves the

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.549 
to live under a nice layer of leaves the
only<00:00:35.850> problem<00:00:36.180> with<00:00:36.239> leaves<00:00:36.570> is<00:00:36.719> if<00:00:36.870> you<00:00:37.020> mulch

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
only problem with leaves is if you mulch

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.440 
only problem with leaves is if you mulch
with<00:00:37.800> whole<00:00:38.040> leaves<00:00:38.430> they<00:00:38.730> tend<00:00:38.969> to<00:00:39.030> form<00:00:39.239> this

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
with whole leaves they tend to form this

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.110 
with whole leaves they tend to form this
really<00:00:39.719> gross<00:00:40.079> soggy<00:00:40.559> mat<00:00:40.950> when<00:00:41.579> they<00:00:41.700> get<00:00:41.850> wet

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
really gross soggy mat when they get wet

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.119 
really gross soggy mat when they get wet
and<00:00:42.420> that's<00:00:42.809> a<00:00:42.930> problem<00:00:43.170> if<00:00:43.500> you've<00:00:43.680> mulched

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
and that's a problem if you've mulched

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.740 
and that's a problem if you've mulched
with<00:00:44.219> leaves<00:00:44.550> over<00:00:44.910> perennials<00:00:45.390> because<00:00:45.660> it

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
with leaves over perennials because it

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.990 
with leaves over perennials because it
can<00:00:45.870> actually<00:00:45.899> smother<00:00:46.559> them<00:00:46.829> so<00:00:47.460> shredding

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
can actually smother them so shredding

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.430 
can actually smother them so shredding
your<00:00:48.120> leaves<00:00:48.300> is<00:00:48.480> a<00:00:48.510> good<00:00:48.719> idea<00:00:49.020> because<00:00:49.200> it

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
your leaves is a good idea because it

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.350 
your leaves is a good idea because it
keeps<00:00:49.649> them<00:00:49.829> light<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.280> fluffy<00:00:50.640> and<00:00:51.000> they

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
keeps them light and fluffy and they

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.180 
keeps them light and fluffy and they
don't<00:00:51.570> compact<00:00:51.989> they<00:00:52.469> also<00:00:52.620> break<00:00:52.920> down<00:00:53.160> a

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
don't compact they also break down a

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.209 
don't compact they also break down a
little<00:00:53.520> bit<00:00:53.640> faster<00:00:54.289> so<00:00:55.289> if<00:00:55.800> you<00:00:55.890> don't<00:00:56.039> have<00:00:56.160> a

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
little bit faster so if you don't have a

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.830 
little bit faster so if you don't have a
chipper<00:00:56.699> shredder<00:00:56.730> there's<00:00:57.360> a<00:00:57.449> couple<00:00:57.629> things

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
chipper shredder there's a couple things
