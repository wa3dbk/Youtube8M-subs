 with a hug cheers laughter and tears 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:12.350
 was fired eymar a little one of just 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:14.209
 six years he received a transplant from 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:17.650
 bone marrow in the cancer center 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:17.650

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.180
 above 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:34.210
 In addition, the transplant was performed in a 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:36.160
 patient of 6 years we have insisted on 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.770
 that a bone marrow transplant is not 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.700
 as a transplant of a solid organ 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:44.920
 consists of the transfusion of cells 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:47.470
 mother and that was done on May 5 and 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:50.410
 after this the care begins 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:53.320
 post transplant right now we go in the day 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:56.559
 plus 18 the first ones are very important 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:01:00.700
 100 days of the transplant where you will be 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:04.960
 mom and him for three months and 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:06.550
 later on August 15 he 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.340
 is 100 days after his transplant 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:12.580
 then he will be able to go to his house to a 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.440
 house that is also with the 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:18.160
 suitable conditions for the bivouac 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:19.630
 the first year of your transplant we hope 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.479
 that he recovers from everything not from his 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:25.149
 cells of your defenses and that the risk 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:27.729
 decrease from having some complication 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:29.890
 Imad's eyes not only showed the 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:31.600
 joy but the sadness of leaving 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.030
 who helped him and gave him his 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.960
 attention hugs to a nurse in 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.150

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.799
 long arm for several minutes and the 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.740
 Tears of the doctors made themselves felt 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:43.630
 in this goodbye of course all 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.200

 who together with doctors and nurses 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.980
 they released balloons as a symbol of 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:50.989
 hope after he was transferred to a 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.790
