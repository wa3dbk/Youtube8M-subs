00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
know if a lot of difference you know I

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.820 
know if a lot of difference you know I
thought<00:00:28.680> I<00:00:28.740> can<00:00:28.949> slip<00:00:29.609> out<00:00:29.760> there<00:00:29.970> over<00:00:30.830> there

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
thought I can slip out there over there

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.450 
thought I can slip out there over there
over<00:00:31.890> last<00:00:32.279> lap<00:00:32.579> I<00:00:33.239> got<00:00:33.570> there<00:00:34.219> wasn't<00:00:35.219> sure

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
over last lap I got there wasn't sure

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.790 
over last lap I got there wasn't sure
but<00:00:35.610> I<00:00:35.790> wouldn't<00:00:36.270> be<00:00:36.420> there<00:00:39.200> in<00:00:40.200> common<00:00:40.379> so<00:00:40.770> I

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
but I wouldn't be there in common so I

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.810 
but I wouldn't be there in common so I
just

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.740 

mossley<00:00:49.070> how<00:00:50.070> to<00:00:50.130> rope<00:00:50.340> it<00:00:50.520> currently<00:00:51.420> might

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
mossley how to rope it currently might

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.380 
mossley how to rope it currently might
have<00:00:51.870> helped<00:00:52.080> a<00:00:52.170> little<00:00:52.710> bit

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:55.390 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.920 

a<00:00:55.480> lot<00:00:56.110> of<00:00:56.140> adjustments<00:00:56.590> on<00:00:56.829> the<00:00:56.860> guard<00:00:57.250> we

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
a lot of adjustments on the guard we

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:04.770 
a lot of adjustments on the guard we
generally<00:00:58.930> get<00:00:59.079> better<00:00:59.760> race<00:01:00.760> goes<00:01:03.629> down<00:01:04.629> as

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
generally get better race goes down as

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.140 
generally get better race goes down as
great<00:01:04.989> we'll<00:01:05.170> have<00:01:05.290> a<00:01:05.320> shot<00:01:05.590> at<00:01:05.800> it<00:01:05.950> the<00:01:06.850> way<00:01:07.000> it

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.150 
great we'll have a shot at it the way it

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:12.870 
great we'll have a shot at it the way it
that<00:01:08.110> ballpark

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.370 

probably<00:01:13.880> actually<00:01:13.970> make<00:01:14.210> a<00:01:14.240> race<00:01:14.450> track<00:01:14.630> to

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
probably actually make a race track to

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.400 
probably actually make a race track to
get<00:01:15.590> on<00:01:15.680> the<00:01:15.800> top<00:01:16.010> has<00:01:16.780> really<00:01:17.780> run<00:01:17.930> real<00:01:18.140> hard

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:18.410 
get on the top has really run real hard

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:22.300 
get on the top has really run real hard
and<00:01:18.680> easy<00:01:19.190> for<00:01:19.460> guys<00:01:19.580> to<00:01:19.820> do<00:01:19.970> that
