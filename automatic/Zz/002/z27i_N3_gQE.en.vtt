storm you got to install the strength
and<00:00:18.030> stability<00:00:18.240> that<00:00:18.810> will<00:00:18.900> carry<00:00:19.140> you

the k-member for good mark 70 CUDA has

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.000 
the k-member for good mark 70 CUDA has
finally<00:00:27.330> arrived<00:00:27.660> from<00:00:27.869> Pennsylvania<00:00:28.560> and<00:00:28.890> I

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
gonna do is get ready for trial fit so

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.000 
gonna do is get ready for trial fit so
even<00:00:40.320> though<00:00:40.379> this<00:00:40.470> us<00:00:40.650> we<00:00:40.739> put<00:00:40.890> together

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
testing and it seen some development so

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.520 
testing and it seen some development so
I<00:03:19.519> think<00:03:19.760> that<00:03:20.000> looking<00:03:20.269> at<00:03:20.390> the<00:03:20.480> parts<00:03:20.780> a<00:03:21.049> lot

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
I think that looking at the parts a lot

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.740 
I think that looking at the parts a lot
of<00:03:21.650> it<00:03:21.769> kind<00:03:22.549> of<00:03:22.670> a<00:03:22.730> hybrid<00:03:22.879> between<00:03:23.239> street

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
all the links in the rottens and such I

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.550 
all the links in the rottens and such I
think<00:03:28.850> they<00:03:29.600> had<00:03:29.810> everything<00:03:30.019> lined<00:03:30.200> out<00:03:30.380> real

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
think they had everything lined out real

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:31.809 
think they had everything lined out real
well<00:03:30.680> with<00:03:30.739> the<00:03:30.950> correct<00:03:31.190> choice<00:03:31.340> of<00:03:31.489> hardware
