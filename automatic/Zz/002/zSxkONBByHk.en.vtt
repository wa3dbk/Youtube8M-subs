 and knock on the door 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.079
 the meter comes to unclog pipes 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.730
 we have seen them in the channel of holy moly 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.030
 that has made a pretty fun challenge 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.010
 and proposed to Piti to do poor 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.199
 she because we what are we going to 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.470
 do basically let's do the 

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:51.470
 captcha link 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.379
 the rest consists of we have two 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.870
 lots of pieces of paper one with parts of 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.190
 the face and another with and makeup we are going to 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.739
 go pulling out pieces of paper and we're going to go 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.199
 making up for one another what comes up 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.730
 and even as you are the indicated one I leave you 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:13.560
 that you take a piece of paper from each engine 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:15.650
 grill with chile scissors community 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.159
 and we can find some 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:21.170
 Oh God Perez is a brush 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:24.700
 for this tutorial I have chosen a 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.700
 concealer of the Chinese 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:37.240
 and it's the land on the eyelid 30 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.340
 if we want to get it basically is that 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:46.130
 the look is much deeper than 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:49.390
 let's draw the stripes of the three 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.390
 because the feet are very close 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.189
 and we have already achieved that his look 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.799
 be as deep as the tiger's 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.799
 cabárceno ceja goodbye lipstick 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.810
 and what are we going to achieve with this pretty 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.630
 it is a depth of the look and 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:09.140
 mixed with the shades cited their 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:11.380
 apply just above what we're going to 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.380
 get 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:23.600
 very well so the colony colony in 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.720
 my chin is liking, you have to go 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.459
 always well scented sanitized thing 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.300
 that the metro people do not have it 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:35.700
 still too internalized 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:38.190
 and me 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.379
 today I'm not going to throw up we're going to take advantage 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.480
 this space to comment a little 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:44.160
 of pop culture what do you think of the change 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.370
 of Justin Bieber that has left mustache 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.379
 I live with a mustache and blues on my forehead 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.209
 blusher on the forehead micro shadows me 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:53.550
 like very man if then what of the 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.630
 beard mind but he has no bar here 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.269
 he had a mustache and came out of an interview 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.680
 of dimension saying that it had been given 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:01.140
 account of the stupid things that 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.610
 done and from then on his mother 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.420
 also lose a little cane and 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.420
 he had died much more 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:26.420
 but the issue is if there are gods why 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.420
 or soon 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:40.560
 and do you think that management does not 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:42.920
 to be able to think of nothing alone of everything is a 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.920
 star 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.940
 what happens is that I am without eyes of me 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.760
 I do not see myself in the home depot reflex anymore 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.110
 accentuated the color of the eyebrow you think 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:56.250
 that the same thing will happen in sudcalifornia 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:57.900
 and in auryn I think they are going to ride us 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:02.000
 powerful also has many 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.000
 things that surprise of course what of 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:09.870
 it's not a mascara strategy in the 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:14.629
 most expensive rivals neck that is more expensive 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.629
 more expensive is to endorse the blue 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:21.989
 so we see deep ideas his neck to 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:21.989
 that have the deepest throat 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:40.570
 does not mean anything this is that you think of 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.550
 that miley cyrus and adriana grande are 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:45.160
 have come together to create the happy hippie 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.840
 fundation i love i love is the 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.840

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:51.730
 I am very in love with miley cyrus is 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.410
 say that he is very heterosexual but I 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:55.420
 They love to tell you, it surprised me 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:58.030
 but it comes big on the couch that where 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:59.980
 commented cyrus the happy birthday thing 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:02.230
 I never imagined I would never do anything 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:04.870
 so so normal I do not think many people 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:12.540
 I would like to make collaborations for your 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:12.540
 race but that the thigh 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:29.590

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.750
 been the year of whether it is necessary to mention 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:35.580
