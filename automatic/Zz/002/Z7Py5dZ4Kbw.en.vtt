hi I'm Nick from green sneakers and I'm
about<00:00:02.310> to<00:00:02.370> demonstrate<00:00:02.669> a<00:00:03.030> series<00:00:03.480> of

00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
about to demonstrate a series of

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:05.390 
about to demonstrate a series of
templates<00:00:04.290> called<00:00:04.560> the<00:00:04.680> action<00:00:05.130> car

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
templates called the action car

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.789 
templates called the action car
templates<00:00:05.850> they<00:00:06.000> make<00:00:06.150> moveable<00:00:06.720> cards<00:00:07.620> like

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
templates they make moveable cards like

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:09.919 
templates they make moveable cards like
this<00:00:07.980> this<00:00:08.220> is<00:00:08.429> the<00:00:08.460> flip<00:00:08.970> card<00:00:09.269> or<00:00:09.420> waterfall

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
this this is the flip card or waterfall

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.499 
this this is the flip card or waterfall
card<00:00:10.260> very<00:00:11.190> simply<00:00:11.639> there's<00:00:11.820> a<00:00:11.880> method<00:00:12.269> to<00:00:12.300> the

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
card very simply there's a method to the

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.299 
card very simply there's a method to the
madness<00:00:12.559> this<00:00:13.559> template<00:00:14.009> here<00:00:14.190> is

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
madness this template here is

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.640 
madness this template here is
eight-and-a-half<00:00:14.940> by<00:00:15.240> 11<00:00:15.690> inches<00:00:15.960> tall<00:00:16.230> so<00:00:16.500> on

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
eight-and-a-half by 11 inches tall so on

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:17.930 
eight-and-a-half by 11 inches tall so on
a<00:00:16.680> standard<00:00:17.100> piece<00:00:17.279> of<00:00:17.430> paper<00:00:17.640> there's

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
a standard piece of paper there's

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.330 
a standard piece of paper there's
minimal<00:00:18.240> cutting<00:00:18.690> so<00:00:19.320> you<00:00:19.380> just<00:00:19.619> place<00:00:19.920> it<00:00:19.949> and

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
minimal cutting so you just place it and

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.640 
minimal cutting so you just place it and
trace<00:00:21.060> it<00:00:21.090> and<00:00:21.449> what<00:00:21.869> I've<00:00:21.990> done<00:00:22.170> here<00:00:22.380> is<00:00:22.500> I've

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
trace it and what I've done here is I've

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.380 
trace it and what I've done here is I've
left<00:00:22.890> it<00:00:23.070> very<00:00:23.250> dark<00:00:23.609> so<00:00:23.820> that<00:00:23.939> you<00:00:24.060> can<00:00:24.210> see

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
left it very dark so that you can see

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:25.939 
left it very dark so that you can see
what<00:00:24.539> I've<00:00:24.660> done<00:00:24.689> there's<00:00:25.109> little<00:00:25.410> carrots

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
what I've done there's little carrots

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.099 
what I've done there's little carrots
here<00:00:26.099> that<00:00:26.369> are<00:00:26.490> indices<00:00:27.000> you<00:00:27.330> generally<00:00:28.019> you

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
here that are indices you generally you

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.750 
here that are indices you generally you
normally<00:00:28.470> would<00:00:28.619> not<00:00:28.769> make<00:00:29.010> them<00:00:29.189> that<00:00:29.369> dark

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
normally would not make them that dark

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.970 
normally would not make them that dark
but<00:00:30.390> I<00:00:30.420> did<00:00:30.660> it<00:00:30.779> for<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:30.990> demonstration<00:00:31.260> and

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
but I did it for the demonstration and

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.100 
but I did it for the demonstration and
they're<00:00:32.430> their<00:00:32.850> scoring<00:00:33.270> indices<00:00:33.870> so<00:00:34.050> you

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
they're their scoring indices so you

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.450 
they're their scoring indices so you
take<00:00:34.350> a<00:00:34.380> straightedge<00:00:34.770> and<00:00:35.040> you<00:00:35.160> score<00:00:35.430> a

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
take a straightedge and you score a

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.030 
take a straightedge and you score a
point<00:00:35.489> to<00:00:35.910> point<00:00:36.120> point<00:00:36.870> to<00:00:37.079> point<00:00:37.260> point<00:00:37.860> to

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
point to point point to point point to

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.770 
point to point point to point point to
point<00:00:38.219> point<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:38.850> point<00:00:39.030> and<00:00:39.480> when<00:00:39.660> you're

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
point point to point and when you're

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.270 
point point to point and when you're
done<00:00:40.020> you'll<00:00:40.320> end<00:00:40.500> up<00:00:40.590> with<00:00:40.739> something<00:00:41.160> like

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
done you'll end up with something like

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.389 
done you'll end up with something like
this<00:00:41.600> this<00:00:42.600> becomes<00:00:43.140> your<00:00:43.410> sleeve<00:00:43.800> you<00:00:43.829> push

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
this this becomes your sleeve you push

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.490 
this this becomes your sleeve you push
your<00:00:44.579> arm<00:00:44.820> through<00:00:45.120> your<00:00:45.270> sleeve<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:45.870> this<00:00:46.320> is

this I've been accused of taking the fun
out<00:01:28.259> of<00:01:28.290> measuring<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:28.979> this<00:01:29.070> is<00:01:29.250> what<00:01:29.430> I<00:01:29.460> mean

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
out of measuring and this is what I mean

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.929 
out of measuring and this is what I mean
by<00:01:29.729> that<00:01:29.939> you<00:01:30.799> place<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:32.040> trace<00:01:32.280> this<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:32.850> get

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
by that you place and trace this and get

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.120 
by that you place and trace this and get
it<00:01:32.970> down<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.240> size<00:01:33.540> there's<00:01:34.229> a<00:01:34.290> little<00:01:34.619> indicee

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
it down to size there's a little indicee

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.789 
it down to size there's a little indicee
here<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:35.810> let<00:01:36.810> me<00:01:36.900> back<00:01:37.079> up<00:01:37.259> for<00:01:37.290> a<00:01:37.470> second
