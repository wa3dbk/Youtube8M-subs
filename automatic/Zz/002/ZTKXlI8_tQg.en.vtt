actually did not do much research on
this<00:01:43.500> game<00:01:43.710> so<00:01:43.920> i<00:01:43.950> don't<00:01:44.189> know<00:01:44.280> I<00:01:44.310> do<00:01:44.430> know<00:01:44.520> that

that's why you always typically take the

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.719 
that's why you always typically take the
opposite<00:02:04.259> side<00:02:04.439> of<00:02:04.469> the<00:02:04.560> public<00:02:04.979> it's<00:02:05.640> the

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
who are dumb people are dumb but

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.080 
who are dumb people are dumb but
individuals<00:02:10.229> are<00:02:10.349> smart<00:02:10.679> that's<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.250> basic

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
individuals are smart that's the basic

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.540 
individuals are smart that's the basic
principle<00:02:12.480> a<00:02:12.690> is<00:02:12.870> so

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
principle a is so

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.070 
principle a is so
look<00:02:13.880> at<00:02:14.060> it<00:02:14.210> seventy-two<00:02:14.660> percent<00:02:14.780> of<00:02:15.020> the

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080
