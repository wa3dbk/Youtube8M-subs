00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
things too like riffs in the world these

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.020 
things too like riffs in the world these
can<00:02:03.140> kind<00:02:03.409> of<00:02:03.469> look<00:02:04.070> a<00:02:04.250> little<00:02:04.369> repetitive<00:02:04.729> at

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
can kind of look a little repetitive at

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:06.819 
can kind of look a little repetitive at
the<00:02:05.119> lower<00:02:05.270> levels<00:02:05.630> but<00:02:05.780> believe<00:02:06.170> me<00:02:06.200> once<00:02:06.649> you

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:06.829 
the lower levels but believe me once you

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:09.279 
the lower levels but believe me once you
get<00:02:07.100> up<00:02:07.340> into<00:02:07.759> higher<00:02:08.240> levels<00:02:08.660> they<00:02:08.869> get<00:02:09.020> more

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
get up into higher levels they get more

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:10.690 
get up into higher levels they get more
and<00:02:09.500> more<00:02:09.530> interesting<00:02:10.190> and<00:02:10.280> they're<00:02:10.430> become

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700
