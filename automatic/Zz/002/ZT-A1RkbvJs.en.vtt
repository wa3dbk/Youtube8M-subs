00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 good that being all my friends 

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:06.830
 today I bring you a new video tutorial 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:10.010
 how 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.840
 like 100% your ram memory already has 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:15.200
 all computers are enabled 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:18.259
 to be able to use 100% most of 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:20.869
 the computers when one buys from 

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:22.970
 new is scheduled to occupy 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:27.380
 we only have 60 percent of your 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:31.059
 memory notwithstanding that what we are going to 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.570
 to do today is to enable what is the other 

00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:34.850
 40% 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.949
 in your computer case 60 per 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.290
 percent let's enable that 40 by 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:41.900
 always good we go with the video 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:45.170
 good tutorial what we're going to do 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:48.549
 now it is to go to the beginning here I have my 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:53.720
 like how all the programs started 

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:56.450
 accessories run once 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.850
 but they have a vital energy we write 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.500
 alderman 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:03.470
 and we will accept 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:06.309
 this what came out once they entered 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.309
 enormously 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.050
 we go to the folder 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:20.690
 we are going to one to be in control 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.690
 and let's go 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.410
 session manager manager 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:30.760
 here as you can see the same 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:38.350
 I died to the first folder mind with 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.350
 best 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:45.830
 what we are going to do now is double click 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.830
 so that this does not come out 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.720
 but we give to modify 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.760
 we have to check hexadecimal and not 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:17.050
 of chasms so we left three decimals 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:22.310
 and then they will have it 0 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:23.960
 well what are we going to put we are not going to 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.670
 to accept 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:30.560
 because our sport 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.560
 we have again totally ordered 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:38.030
 and now only what would be missing is to have 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:41.960
 here an initial one once you restart your 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:44.450
 computer will see the change it has 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.310
 the freezer is good what I'm going to 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.580
 to do now is to go through my channel 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.580
 friend 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.709
 because 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:00.450
 and well here is a 16 so that it 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:04.209
 subscribe channel has very good videos 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:06.420
 and well that would be all and see you the 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:06.420
 next 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:10.560
 if they have any
