00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
looks horrible and because he's made it

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:05.960 
looks horrible and because he's made it
look<00:04:04.620> like<00:04:04.680> the<00:04:04.860> normal<00:04:05.100> chain<00:04:05.370> one<00:04:05.640> but

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
look like the normal chain one but

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.780 
look like the normal chain one but
flipping<00:04:06.570> epic<00:04:06.930> I<00:04:07.200> like<00:04:07.590> that<00:04:07.800> and<00:04:08.040> also<00:04:08.460> is

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.740 
flipping epic I like that and also is
updated<00:04:09.270> the<00:04:09.450> knight<00:04:09.810> edge<00:04:10.080> so<00:04:10.740> it<00:04:11.570> looks<00:04:12.570> like

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
updated the knight edge so it looks like

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.150 
updated the knight edge so it looks like
a<00:04:12.780> lightsaber<00:04:13.200> it<00:04:13.560> doesn't<00:04:13.770> make<00:04:13.860> the<00:04:13.980> same

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
a lightsaber it doesn't make the same

a lightsaber it doesn't make the same
noises<00:04:14.490> which<00:04:15.090> is<00:04:15.240> unfortunate<00:04:15.960> because

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:16.080 
noises which is unfortunate because

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.349 
noises which is unfortunate because
that's<00:04:16.530> written<00:04:16.799> I've<00:04:17.400> got<00:04:17.520> normal<00:04:17.850> here<00:04:18.150> and

edge<00:04:21.930> is<00:04:22.080> just<00:04:22.290> a<00:04:22.350> longer<00:04:22.590> version<00:04:22.980> of<00:04:23.220> the

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
edge is just a longer version of the

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:24.590 
edge is just a longer version of the
lights<00:04:23.550> over<00:04:23.850> now<00:04:23.970> well<00:04:24.210> it<00:04:24.330> looks<00:04:24.510> like

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
more powerful version so it's pretty
