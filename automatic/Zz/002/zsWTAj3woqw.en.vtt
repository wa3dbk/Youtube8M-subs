00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.809
 and today I'm going to teach you a 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.280
 technique called chic is a 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.279
 Japanese technique where we 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.110
 present with fabrics is legal because 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.880
 It looks pretty different and moreover 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.490
 because it will not play the game. 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.520
 tissue outside can reuse 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.779
 need different fabrics you 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.800
 choose what fabrics you want scissors 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:32.970
 elastic and also some embellishments 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.820
 christmas 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:38.399
 is for you to have a sense of the size 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.640
 You take your box and measure it on the fabric. 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.989
 most fans who are made with 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.149
 square fabric 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.089
 the woman not all I did a context 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.460
 rectangle but I already invented it and you? 

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:52.859
 measures the size of your carton makes a 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.780
 triangle and excess rooms and you have 

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:57.420
 a certain square 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.370
 It's in that first narration I'm going to do 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.530
 with this software silence the poet if 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.420
 they are not a little clearer and 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.580
 have a it the golden drawings i think 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.440
 There is a beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, you fold. 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.570
 from above but as you have seen 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.030
 underneath the box is that even part of 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.920
 low forgiveness and the top and dollar 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.690
 here to have a finish yet 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.330
 managed to score a goal with the 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:21.150
 even there only in the middle you will give a 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.310
 node and then give another node 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.310
 You have to pay attention not to 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.930
 stay the wrong side of the opposite side 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.850
 of the appearing tissue has to appear 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.880
 always dangle dinho drawn side 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.670
 right there you tie nofx in with 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.830
 care and then you put at the end or 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.840
 Christmas ornament that I saw I had 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.040
 At home I found cute different kick 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.790
 delicate 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:47.130
 The second technique is with two nodes. 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:51.240
 different then first you pick the 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:53.730
 crosses the ends and crosses two ends and 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.770
 it looks pretty cute or 75 always 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:58.470
 trying to climb up with the inside out with 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.330
 part with the inside of the fabric gives 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.620
 a node is not 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.070
 You said I caught on opposite ends. 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:06.900
 of a node and then another node lending 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.619
 Attention in what I said is to always leave 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:12.120
 the right side of the fabric appears there 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.830
 after only other tips 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.069
 left in the street there inside not staying 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:20.459
 looking the opposite of the fabric and we will give 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:21.500
 two more knots is to be careful to leave 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.360
 in the same direction 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.340
 A lot of people use the name from the bottom up. 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:29.210
 to stay in the same direction 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:31.430
 there we go side but another knot and pull the 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:33.530
 Right from the start, to be cute, you know. 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.020
 in paying attention to the finish you know the 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:39.020
 what makes the difference i think chic 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:42.709
 this second option the third you 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:44.600
 woman books is trying to be much bigger 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:46.850
 later you begin to engage the lady okay 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:50.420
 Seeing put the tips gives a 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:52.490
 Look at the book and then when it arrives at the 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.670
 half will you pick up and the tips of 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:58.520
 up will cross right you cross because 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:01.370
 he already speaks like a bag there 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:03.920
 Looks like this is where the footsteps are. 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.480
 in small number 1 seconds and then it is 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.360
 away some books Space 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:12.260
 get bigger hit is a grant us 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:15.380
 rolls to the top accounts of June 19 is e 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:18.980
 if you want you can spice it up 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:20.570
 handle with a ribbon or did not understand me 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.630
 I preferred to put a ribbon because 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:25.160
 You only know the one in this little bag, I got it. 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:28.940
 a green ribbon more or less the same 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:32.269
 color of the green one that has on the fabric and I wrapped 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:35.330
 there covering the knot trying to cover the 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:37.310
 name a legal way and after having a 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.959
 steel that I found very interesting I think 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.690
 what a cuter than to leave 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:43.670
 only ours knows I do not know the name leaves 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.260
 a bit annoyed but there goes of taste 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.610
 to leave or not to leave unless you go 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.610
 there and do ours like me 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:09.069
 Then just cut the ends of the tape and 

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:12.159
 It was cool that way . 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:13.930
 two books interesting and cute goes to 

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:16.479
 Who likes books like me? 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:19.870
 now let's go to our other package 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:22.270
 remember bottles is little piece of champagne 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.740
 costa rica or even cereser with the 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.479
 problem with the problem and take a 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.300
 cider i adore cider 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:30.340
 There you pick it up, you fold it. 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.259
 Seeing if you do it for a vai vai vou 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:34.690
 When you made that range of paper, 

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:35.410
 Same thing, take the elastic. 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.599
 to hold 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.849
 there we will at the other end do the same 

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:42.669
 thing that fills you with the neighbor of 

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:47.620
 paper we do here and makes the bend 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:50.020
 the back and forth of the fabric and 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:53.979
 puts on the fifth in the cock a neck of the 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:55.900
 bottle and tie with the elastic wobble 

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:59.169
 if you call red stich in your 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:01.180
 home're better because then and then I'll 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:03.280
 put a tape to assume to seal the 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:06.070
 People pull to make a guy, I do not know. 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:08.830
 It's a stupid thing, and there's 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:12.070
 people tie now what's left over 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:13.930
 together it pulls very hard and gives a knot 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:15.729
 if the text is softer than mine 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:18.130
 but this one was not too soft on the 

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:18.610
 I was not able to give only one 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:20.409
 at the 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.970
 but you can get 29 is more 

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:24.130
 legal is more critical 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:27.070
 There you get a red ribbon. 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:29.919
 color only to invite climate because it 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:32.289
 I think is cool is appearing people from 29 

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:34.780
 years and gets ready is cool because you 

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:36.699
 You can spruce a bottle of 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:37.990
 wine does not give just the bottle of 

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:39.909
 Wine does not carry the bottle of wine 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:42.789
 just in the hand so the champagne 

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:44.560
 I found it very cute, we have an option 

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:46.539
 that the person has two clients in one 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.949
 No, because you can do it with yourself. 

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:48.820
 scarf that you will give as a gift to 

00:05:47.949 --> 00:05:50.860
 person 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:53.409
 There is a book there, but you can give a 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:56.889
 book and gift you scroll to make 

00:05:53.409 --> 00:06:00.520
 a flower you see is always easy and 

00:05:56.889 --> 00:06:03.849
 last option is is not furoshiki, it 's me 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:06.400
 I picked up a fabric that is square in 

00:06:03.849 --> 00:06:09.370
 block no rectangular forgiveness and wrapped 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:12.190
 or my little box 

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:13.720
 There you go, I'll double it. 

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:16.780
 and then I do it as if it were paper 

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:18.640
 present and because in the arrow that 

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:21.130
 people because he does not have 

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:22.900
 Mooring understood I do I do one more 

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:27.220
 folding in the box 

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:30.010
 Then I'll take a tape and I'll hold the part. 

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:31.240
 from behind and I'll hug the bottom 

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:33.550
 this fold because I think the 

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:36.340
 cute and even matched with fabric is 

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:38.680
 green with these red berries 

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:40.810
 Then you pick it up and give it a password there. 

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:42.730
 Cantinho in the middle in the corner to stay 

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:45.700
 more delicate I thought it would be more 

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:50.080
 delicate as you like 

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:52.650
 There's only one knot there and it's ready. 

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.650
 another option 

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:59.560
 I hope you liked it then. 

00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:01.990
 that day the sky paper for Christmas and 

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:02.860
 stay cool a thing recyclable and very 

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:04.420
 cute 

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:07.680
 Then you can put your imagination to 

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:07.680
 fly kisses
