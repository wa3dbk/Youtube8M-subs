age<00:01:32.420> we<00:01:33.420> begin<00:01:33.750> a<00:01:33.930> procedure<00:01:34.409> which<00:01:34.799> is<00:01:34.950> called

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
age we begin a procedure which is called

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.940 
age we begin a procedure which is called
an<00:01:35.340> alveolar<00:01:35.640> bone<00:01:35.820> graft<00:01:36.770> this<00:01:37.770> is<00:01:37.920> a

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
an alveolar bone graft this is a

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.539 
an alveolar bone graft this is a
procedure<00:01:38.400> which<00:01:39.030> closes<00:01:39.450> this<00:01:40.049> area<00:01:40.680> of<00:01:40.920> the

procedure which closes this area of the

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.069 
procedure which closes this area of the
palate<00:01:41.939> where<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.299> teeth<00:01:42.509> come<00:01:42.780> through

palate where the teeth come through

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.789 
palate where the teeth come through
that's<00:01:43.229> called<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.040> alveolus<00:01:44.640> and<00:01:45.649> then<00:01:46.649> in

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
that's called the alveolus and then in

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.670 
that's called the alveolus and then in
the<00:01:46.920> teenage<00:01:47.310> years<00:01:47.640> up<00:01:48.450> until<00:01:48.720> children<00:01:49.439> are
