00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:15.960
 you walk in me not grip grip 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:18.330
 so so if my soft coupling 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:22.789
 will the score help you ? 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.789
 this lock from you 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:34.689
 here 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:34.689
 car something of tanks 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:41.510
 common aspiration passed thousands 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.309
 thirty forty 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:48.809
 here here is a significant development appeared but 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:51.600
 it's all around the city that is riding constantly 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:56.519
 In a traffic jam 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:01:01.589
 appeared and here you can see very much too 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:13.319
 workings with enough game discs 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:17.580
 something that also has four springs 6 

00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:20.550
 springs drive too for these 30 enough 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:24.770
 badly worn though no one burned 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.770
 nothing burned 

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:45.170
 gearing please 

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:54.140
 where the spring springs a little bit thicker 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:07.200
 the other side 

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:10.550
 Well, so you can say it will be clear 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.550
 how will walk of course 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:22.540
 now here closed here of course 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:26.200
 so openly more or less 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:30.280
 gated some one to me there 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:32.700
 of course immediately does not inspire confidence all 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:38.950
 the time here is here making 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:39.670
 going strong by the way on this one 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.940
 cart 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:45.280
 taller but lounged when i set 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.790
 somewhere in three thousand fell apart 1 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.790
 Releaser 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:51.940
 and after that I changed the releaser here 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.709
 drove all somewhere at 20 30 I do not know yet 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.830
 about odd so little very good 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:58.180
 the clutch changed it because 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:01.630
 that tore the plug 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:03.700
 many angles clutch fork and steel 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.580
 disassemble saw this whole production 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.380
 that everything is hanging on the disk decided 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.330
 immediately change because it was winter 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.850
 or did not want to climb again 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:15.310
 due to the fact that the disc rang out 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:18.840
 or baskets of course would hardly have collapsed 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.840
 but still everything is possible 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:31.239
 so if a video about him 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:33.670
 that ruined the way here how 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:36.909
 say those prices are fake riveting 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:47.110
 does not put a label although now jo 

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:48.849
 hijacking can be finished very easily so that 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:52.470
 if you see it is useful to someone 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:56.760
 subscribe to the channel put likes 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.760
 such here for parts
