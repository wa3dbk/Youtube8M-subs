00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:18.070
 lisbeth first teams is not no in its pension opinion I'm going to start 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.789
 to costumes benefits 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.609
 we have a different written for each one has explained is the one written by 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:26.220
 books 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.079
 has made the novels percent 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:32.250
 she lives inside the head those characters 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.980
 and that's why he has a deeper understanding of the world 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.100
 has a mba profile 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.070
 novels so we integrated it into a much larger wait and all that is 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.540
 possible face 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:53.420
 tepic always comes in the realejos with a first perspective of giving him good 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.080
 therefore the game system we look for what experiences we want to give that 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.720
 game system we want to make ipata motor of history to achieve 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.530
 I would not say that the story is simply an excuse to shoot the 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.100
 people or to make the Mossos fight 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.340
 goalkeepers you can see in our games we want to get involved in history and 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.850
 have a greater meaning for the players and that they stay in the 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.670
 head to the end of accounts 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.640
 percent if we give prime importance to the game system because if 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.479
 you have a good one that involves irma the story making a good rossi game 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:30.370
 has succumb legend and a good month a good story is a bad game that the 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:32.460
 Entire life 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.570
 the goal helped us a lot with the multiple they had 1 point 3 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.570
 millions of players 20 million yen stories 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:42.550
 we are ready for September 20 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.880
 when I saw that quarters the multiplayer feared 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:51.080
 thousand people who tried it between piquillín resources and when you see the 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.610
 first two days of x 2 there were 1 points 5 million people when they arrive 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.180
 he changed it a lot 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.420
 there he left us thinking that it works for me but not for 1 points 5 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.670
 millions so now with that goal we achieve that all these people 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:11.180
 come and try everything I have a lot of confidence before leaving says wait 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.080
 to be able to sleep on the 19th when the young lady was the first time people but now that 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.869
 we have the beta I know I can rest because 

00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:22.539
 I expect own servers for people so that everything happens perfectly 

00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:28.669
 ísmodes is basically an extensive five-player cooperative 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:33.010
 that we realize with young people and others that people wanted much more 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.189
 cooperative we start like we will for the rest 

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:40.759
 what he does here is public is what we think and because the monsters is something 

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:45.099
 particular of those who because many other factors do not want them is not that 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:48.489
 what we are looking for is to take advantage of these waiters 

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:50.379
 the designer 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:52.319
 is where everything is the monster 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:57.049
 and you have to study humans there are 12 hours all this falls back in time 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:02:58.919
 we start 

00:02:58.919 --> 00:03:02.459
 the weight but the way you can check it funny because you're a 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.939
 monster 3 hide but the noise that can soon detectives of the 

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:07.380
 operating theater angels 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.810
 in terms of physical survival rather than ways but you want it 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.700
 make fast and efficient which is to destroy them as quickly as 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.479
 possible 

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:18.859
 what happens is that you have the twelve waves and you have time and have the 

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:22.309
 Cutting ability Play with your friends change characters over time 

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:30.109
 once you played embroidery zero point children with fortifications and jones 

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:31.149
 walls 

00:03:31.149 --> 00:03:33.889
 It is a mixture of ota and itagüí ditaires 

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:37.819
 after all these things there you can develop skis and steel 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:39.149
 fortifications 

00:03:39.149 --> 00:03:44.149
 ungrateful with another place is different hotel garlic that that fee feels very 

00:03:44.149 --> 00:03:45.160
 different and I think that 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.160
 The type of game improved a lot 

00:03:50.219 --> 00:03:53.180
 use four complete games for us why not 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.900
 we do not do it like the others we do not think about having a hero and three 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.950
 clones we want a cooperative or four players in which the four 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:03.530
 characters have four different perspectives when speaking with face and you 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.870
 We said that we are not four characters in each scene and that is difficult 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:11.029
 also when looking at the game system we need four players who 

00:04:11.029 --> 00:04:14.479
 they could cover that they had ammunition that they could have now more 

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:16.629
 and they will try to attack a monster 

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:20.869
 we had to change the design of team vélez we are a bit stylish 

00:04:20.869 --> 00:04:23.869
 restlessness 1 where there was a lot of room to flank 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.939
 we create lambent that can affect many at the same time 

00:04:27.939 --> 00:04:32.569
 dyn that are covered or that shoot tc is covered and is that we had to capture 

00:04:32.569 --> 00:04:35.569
 Much seems cooperative 

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:41.169
 newly announced if they are peace is the possibility of pre-order dark but 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:45.749
 of them was more than that we stopped it multiple player so write 

00:04:45.749 --> 00:04:48.300
 has advocated to embroider possible 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:49.520
 even 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.879
 a story part for him for the campaign mode that has nothing to do with the 

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:55.180
 Catholic history 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.979
 also by the jumping characters and 

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:01.349
 weapons will not stop for multiplayer but 

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:04.349
 but a lot of content during the next 

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:12.309
 every time we kill a character but that competition 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:16.860
 curious but it's something that she makes whoever is here once 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.139
 willing to do whatever it takes 

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:24.020
 for history to have an impact I think that all the games we've done in 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:26.969
 we each kill four five characters 

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:27.949
 so 

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:32.060
 it's about him telling a story worthwhile and that the 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:36.110
 people stayed on we want people not to know what is going to happen but 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:39.110
 to be surprised as players 

00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:44.999
 that is agreed that this sense of being lost cost by 

00:05:44.999 --> 00:05:46.059
 example 

00:05:46.059 --> 00:05:49.919
 I do not know if that would turn me into the colca and the videogames now fire to 

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:52.919
 Mexico javier conesa educations 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.520
 I think maybe a great job as a spokesperson 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:02.400
 of the games and I think that being a child 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.740
 a person so better poured 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:09.870
 people underestimate them a bit so I think people would be surprised 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:14.349
 I wanted to work with him every day what he does in design as he contributes 

00:06:14.349 --> 00:06:16.050
 to the game and comfortable his vision 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:18.840
 he is a great talent that people should not underestimate
