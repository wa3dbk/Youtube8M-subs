00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:09.960
 this is the word of the samples and so 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.690
 Pontus Vernblum 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.250
 one of the main characters of this match is the author 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.710
 goal which brought cisco to league 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.160
 champions specifically for program 90 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.470
 minutes plus 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.420
 with cisco translator maximum head 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.850
 under this light Rostov rain 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.010
 which of course does not spoil the mood 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.269
 pontus but to none of the representatives 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.500
 cisco pontus your emotions please 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:34.170
 just led the team to the league 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.480
 champions this photo will shine something you 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.829
 a guest 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.750
 we descried very happy and very 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.700
 We played poorly all should immediately recognize and 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.530
 second half especially they only filed 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.940
 only stood fought back moped filed 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.309
 I tried again you wear 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.460
 in the end we were lucky we scored and 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.780
 leveled and made 11 and so here it is 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.699
 head you behaved in the Champions League 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.550
 so maxim translates very well 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.699
 there were immediately say unprintable words you 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.430
 from ponte vernblum but about 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:05.460
 characteristics of the game cisco honda that 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.140
 now it was in the locker room emotions understandable 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.520
 overlap maybe some 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.290
 separate education because with 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.880
 champion broke up long ago from 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.810
 getting into the Champions League was really 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.009
 the main task at the end of the season 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.409
 I think it was just 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:19.990
 colossal relief which in those 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:23.270
 guys 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:25.460
 so heavy oppressive was the state we 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.289
 lost 10 and this is the goal that we 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.030
 beat hardy champions and therefore 

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:31.640
 everyone cleaned up tremendous relief 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.439
 as if a huge burden fell from the shoulders and 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.539
 now just everything is happy there all 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:37.909
 jubilant everyone just rejoices and couldn't 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:39.770
 find a place for joy in the middle 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:41.270
 second half Leonid Slutsky you 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.610
 sent essentially to the position 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.860
 frontline how much for you it was 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.380
 unexpectedly and how comfortable you are to play 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.770
 in this position in the past you had 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.770
 such an experience 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.670
 I can say that was wonderful 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.710
 decision coach and because he read 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.720
 this situation long before the end 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.160
 the match pushed me forward because 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.560
 we are not so much defending bow to us 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.750
 it was necessary to score and compare the game 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.710
 so I pushed forward and I can 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.250
 say that's enough for me 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.750
 comfortable position usual around 2007 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.370
 eighth year just dropped play 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.110
 midfield before I basically played 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.180
 attack and feel enough 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.380
 comfortable not everything comes naturally 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.690
 I can not say that I can not score 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.790
 Goals I because all childhood grew up playing 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.920
 the position of the attacker is therefore accustomed 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.820
 score goals and in principle for me this 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.470
 was natural 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.150
 I am therefore very pleased that the training would 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.000
 orienting it was noticing him 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.830
 solutions you now have fans csk for 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.239
 back when you answered the previous one 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.870
 question listened to what they chanted 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:37.850
 Your name 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.870
 where it is necessary the binding is very large and the water in 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:43.820
 salsa genes 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:45.709
 I'm aida janga can you promise them 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:49.000
 that next season you will 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:51.660
 give way to cisco death 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.660
 I write that all 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.190
 I really would like to but I can not do anything 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.870
 promise because I'm afraid to break them 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.580
 Turn your hearts on if this is not 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.620
 get on the birds and I can not even all that 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.500
 we negotiate I don't know how they are 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.660
 completed so football is like 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.280
 business is our professional business 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.620
 so today I do not know how 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.360
 the situation will turn tomorrow 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.810
 I can not make any promises like 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.780
 to take 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:17.750
 on all the same you can tell if will 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:20.240
 everything depends only on you 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.400

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:25.250

 Moscow now you want to stay soon 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:30.260

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:00.830
 again on asking the club whether they want to 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.480

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:04.459
