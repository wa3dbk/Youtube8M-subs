armor<00:00:46.449> and<00:00:48.030> I've<00:00:49.030> always<00:00:49.329> kind<00:00:49.510> of<00:00:49.540> leaned

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:49.750 
armor and I've always kind of leaned

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.079 
armor and I've always kind of leaned
more<00:00:49.930> towards<00:00:50.440> Imperial<00:00:51.129> just<00:00:51.790> because<00:00:51.940> the

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:52.089 
more towards Imperial just because the

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:53.549 
more towards Imperial just because the
simple<00:00:52.329> fact<00:00:52.510> that<00:00:52.600> their<00:00:52.780> armor<00:00:53.079> looks<00:00:53.290> a

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:53.559 
simple fact that their armor looks a

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:56.130 
simple fact that their armor looks a
little<00:00:53.829> more<00:00:54.040> badass<00:00:54.760> than<00:00:54.970> Stormcloak<00:00:55.840> armor

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:56.140 
little more badass than Stormcloak armor

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.319 
little more badass than Stormcloak armor
but<00:00:56.710> now<00:00:57.219> I'm<00:00:57.399> definitely<00:00:57.940> leaning<00:00:58.059> more

00:00:58.319 --> 00:00:58.329 
but now I'm definitely leaning more

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:01.830 
but now I'm definitely leaning more
towards<00:00:58.629> Stormcloaks<00:00:59.109> because<00:00:59.469> this<00:01:00.280> is<00:01:00.840> just

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:01.840 
towards Stormcloaks because this is just

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.400 
towards Stormcloaks because this is just
regular<00:01:02.019> Stormcloak<00:01:02.679> grammar<00:01:02.890> now<00:01:04.170> well<00:01:05.170> I

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:05.410 
regular Stormcloak grammar now well I

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:07.230 
regular Stormcloak grammar now well I
don't<00:01:05.710> I<00:01:05.950> don't<00:01:06.190> know<00:01:06.369> if<00:01:06.460> like<00:01:06.759> you'll<00:01:07.060> see

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
don't I don't know if like you'll see

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.430 
don't I don't know if like you'll see
strong<00:01:07.479> cloaks<00:01:07.690> wearing<00:01:07.960> actually<00:01:08.229> I<00:01:08.289> think

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:08.440 
strong cloaks wearing actually I think

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.410 
strong cloaks wearing actually I think
you<00:01:08.649> will<00:01:08.830> I<00:01:09.070> think<00:01:09.700> that's<00:01:09.850> what<00:01:10.000> it<00:01:10.210> just

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
you will I think that's what it just

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.169 
you will I think that's what it just
replaces<00:01:10.960> the<00:01:11.560> strong<00:01:12.340> cloak<00:01:12.520> armor<00:01:12.910> itself

00:01:13.169 --> 00:01:13.179 
replaces the strong cloak armor itself

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:17.279 
replaces the strong cloak armor itself
um<00:01:13.860> but<00:01:14.860> yeah<00:01:14.950> that's<00:01:15.160> the<00:01:15.810> sleeved<00:01:16.810> version
