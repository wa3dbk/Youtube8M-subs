very well no water got inside I've
already<00:00:53.460> cracked<00:00:53.699> it<00:00:53.820> open<00:00:54.379> and<00:00:55.379> checked<00:00:55.649> it

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
already cracked it open and checked it

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.750 
already cracked it open and checked it
out<00:00:55.920> going<00:00:56.879> along<00:00:57.500> these<00:00:58.500> these<00:00:58.859> four<00:00:59.190> screws

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
out going along these these four screws

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.260 
out going along these these four screws
here<00:01:00.230> our<00:01:01.250> seals<00:01:02.250> that<00:01:02.489> wrap<00:01:02.879> around<00:01:03.149> that

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
here our seals that wrap around that

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.770 
here our seals that wrap around that
entire<00:01:03.629> case<00:01:04.350> of<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.830> body<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.760> red<00:01:06.479> seal

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
entire case of the body the red seal

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.780 
entire case of the body the red seal
there<00:01:07.049> so<00:01:07.619> here<00:01:07.799> I<00:01:07.830> take<00:01:08.070> that<00:01:08.189> apart<00:01:08.549> make

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
there so here I take that apart make

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.300 
there so here I take that apart make
sure<00:01:09.060> that<00:01:09.810> that<00:01:10.020> seal<00:01:10.320> lines<00:01:10.619> back<00:01:10.860> up<00:01:11.040> good

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
sure that that seal lines back up good

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.070 
sure that that seal lines back up good
and<00:01:11.580> while<00:01:12.060> you're<00:01:12.240> in<00:01:12.330> there<00:01:12.479> you<00:01:12.630> know<00:01:12.840> stop

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
and while you're in there you know stop

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.870 
and while you're in there you know stop
some<00:01:13.290> grease<00:01:13.530> on<00:01:13.680> it<00:01:13.740> split<00:01:14.159> up<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:14.430> try<00:01:14.640> out

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
some grease on it split up and try out

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.399 
some grease on it split up and try out
as<00:01:15.090> well<00:01:16.790> add<00:01:17.790> 20<00:01:18.180> pound<00:01:18.390> braid<00:01:18.689> on<00:01:18.840> this<00:01:18.990> field

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
as well add 20 pound braid on this field

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.280 
as well add 20 pound braid on this field
and<00:01:19.770> I<00:01:20.009> think<00:01:20.250> that's<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.729> pretty<00:01:21.299> good<00:01:21.600> setup

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
and I think that's a pretty good setup

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.789 
and I think that's a pretty good setup
for<00:01:22.409> this<00:01:22.710> size<00:01:22.979> as<00:01:23.549> 25<00:01:24.150> pounds<00:01:24.509> of<00:01:24.600> drag<00:01:24.810> so

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
for this size as 25 pounds of drag so

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.109 
for this size as 25 pounds of drag so
you<00:01:25.860> got<00:01:26.070> to<00:01:26.159> make<00:01:26.280> sure<00:01:26.460> you<00:01:26.610> wouldn't<00:01:26.820> overdo

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
you got to make sure you wouldn't overdo

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.789 
you got to make sure you wouldn't overdo
it<00:01:27.240> on<00:01:27.360> that<00:01:27.509> drag<00:01:27.780> because<00:01:27.990> you<00:01:28.140> can't<00:01:28.590> pop

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
it on that drag because you can't pop

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.539 
it on that drag because you can't pop
that<00:01:29.040> mind<00:01:29.250> this<00:01:29.970> is<00:01:30.180> an<00:01:30.360> all-metal<00:01:30.869> reel<00:01:31.229> and

that mind this is an all-metal reel and
the<00:01:32.549> weight<00:01:32.759> shows<00:01:33.030> for<00:01:33.329> it<00:01:33.450> it<00:01:33.810> is<00:01:33.869> a<00:01:34.049> little

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
the weight shows for it it is a little

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.010 
the weight shows for it it is a little
heavy<00:01:34.500> but<00:01:34.939> one<00:01:35.939> thing<00:01:36.150> this<00:01:36.299> is<00:01:36.570> it's<00:01:36.960> very

the<00:03:05.549> externals<00:03:06.390> in<00:03:06.720> case<00:03:07.019> you're<00:03:07.319> real<00:03:07.590> is

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
the externals in case you're real is

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.910 
the externals in case you're real is
laying<00:03:08.640> line<00:03:08.970> high<00:03:09.420> or<00:03:09.810> low<00:03:10.140> instead<00:03:10.530> of<00:03:10.620> even

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
laying line high or low instead of even

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.220 
laying line high or low instead of even
on<00:03:11.040> the<00:03:11.160> spool<00:03:11.459> cuz<00:03:12.209> you're<00:03:12.510> real<00:03:12.690> can<00:03:12.930> lay<00:03:13.079> it

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
on the spool cuz you're real can lay it

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.170 
on the spool cuz you're real can lay it
too<00:03:13.440> high<00:03:13.650> it'll<00:03:14.010> bulk<00:03:14.220> up<00:03:14.370> at<00:03:14.519> the<00:03:14.610> edges<00:03:14.819> it

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
too high it'll bulk up at the edges it

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.979 
too high it'll bulk up at the edges it
look<00:03:15.359> like<00:03:15.569> a<00:03:15.859> like<00:03:16.859> a<00:03:16.889> V<00:03:17.160> I<00:03:17.190> guess<00:03:17.810> more<00:03:18.810> line

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
look like a like a V I guess more line

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:20.569 
look like a like a V I guess more line
will<00:03:19.139> come<00:03:19.290> towards<00:03:19.620> the<00:03:19.739> top<00:03:19.980> versus<00:03:20.489> the

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
will come towards the top versus the

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:22.759 
will come towards the top versus the
bottom<00:03:20.910> and<00:03:21.150> vice<00:03:21.420> versa<00:03:21.720> so<00:03:22.380> they<00:03:22.470> give<00:03:22.650> you

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
extra extra little plastic washers to

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:27.860 
extra extra little plastic washers to
pull<00:03:26.609> over<00:03:26.760> top<00:03:26.970> of<00:03:27.000> that<00:03:27.269> you<00:03:27.480> know<00:03:27.599> help
