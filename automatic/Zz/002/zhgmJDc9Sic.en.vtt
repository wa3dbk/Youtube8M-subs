00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:20.888
 Hello, StarCraft II fans! 

00:00:20.948 --> 00:00:26.001
 Today we bring you a series of changes that will come in Patch 2.1. 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:29.001
 There are many great things to talk about, 

00:00:29.012 --> 00:00:31.101
 So let's start with the Arcade! 

00:00:31.812 --> 00:00:35.301
 With Patch 2.1, the Arcade is now free. 

00:00:35.378 --> 00:00:38.001
 This means that you, your friends and anyone 

00:00:38.056 --> 00:00:41.300
 you can download the Starter Edition version of StarCraft II for free 

00:00:41.352 --> 00:00:43.400
 and play any game of the Arcade. 

00:00:43.743 --> 00:00:48.801
 In addition, personalized games will also be available to users of the Starter Edition version. 

00:00:49.155 --> 00:00:53.301
 To complement this, we will also implement a function called Extension Mods. 

00:00:53.671 --> 00:00:55.528
 Extension Mods are a series of rules 

00:00:55.575 --> 00:00:57.783
 that can be applied to any map of the game. 

00:00:58.012 --> 00:00:59.972
 This will result in custom game types 

00:00:59.996 --> 00:01:02.900
 that can be played on any StarCraft II map. 

00:01:02.953 --> 00:01:05.300
 To give you an idea of ​​how these mods will work, 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.401
 we went ahead and introduced three initial mods: 

00:01:07.948 --> 00:01:09.501
 Explosive units, 

00:01:11.345 --> 00:01:12.781
 Big Game Hunters, 

00:01:14.081 --> 00:01:15.801
 and errant minerals. 

00:01:17.494 --> 00:01:19.089
 We also want to inform you 

00:01:19.114 --> 00:01:21.360
 that we add three new functions 

00:01:21.391 --> 00:01:24.500
 to interact and share StarCraft II with other users. 

00:01:24.752 --> 00:01:27.201
 The first one is Events, 

00:01:27.328 --> 00:01:28.899
 which are scheduled meetings 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:32.301
 established by the officers or the owner of the clan or club. 

00:01:32.391 --> 00:01:36.796
 They can configure the title, date, description and duration of the meeting 

00:01:36.828 --> 00:01:39.800
 to be able to talk about any important topic. 

00:01:40.023 --> 00:01:43.446
 We also wanted to give more character to the social groups. 

00:01:43.494 --> 00:01:47.601
 That's why we add custom icons to clans and clubs. 

00:01:47.843 --> 00:01:50.684
 Now it will be easier to represent your team and defend your symbol, 

00:01:50.708 --> 00:01:53.601
 because it will be easier to identify the clans and clubs. 

00:01:54.308 --> 00:01:56.832
 Speaking of symbols, we will also allow them 

00:01:56.856 --> 00:01:59.601
 Upload images to use as clan logos. 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.649
 Before, the logos were icons 

00:02:02.673 --> 00:02:04.172
 that surrounded your main structure 

00:02:04.173 --> 00:02:06.200
 and they appeared in some units and buildings. 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.701
 With the Patch 2.1, your clan's custom logo can 

00:02:10.747 --> 00:02:13.101
 fly over its base so friends and enemies can see it. 

00:02:13.508 --> 00:02:16.101
 By the way, did you notice anything special with the background music? 

00:02:16.397 --> 00:02:19.137
 In Patch 2.1, the soundtracks 

00:02:19.163 --> 00:02:21.271
 from StarCraft and StarCraft: Brood War 

00:02:21.285 --> 00:02:23.900
 they were remastered and implemented in the game. 

00:02:24.373 --> 00:02:26.600
 You will find the option to enable them 

00:02:26.638 --> 00:02:28.400
 in the sound section of the options menu. 

00:02:28.487 --> 00:02:32.001
 All these changes bring many new features to the game. 

00:02:32.056 --> 00:02:35.001
 That's why we add more progress and unlockable rewards! 

00:02:35.048 --> 00:02:38.901
 We increased the maximum level from 30 to 35 for each race, 

00:02:39.008 --> 00:02:43.100
 Experience bonuses for the first win of the day increased to 100,000 PE 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.907
 and we add great portraits and logos 

00:02:46.982 --> 00:02:50.301
 courtesy of our friend Jon Burton of Cabot Animations. 

00:02:53.078 --> 00:02:56.901
 Patch 2.1 is here, and StarCraft II never had much to offer them. 

00:02:56.944 --> 00:02:59.301
 Thanks for watching this video! See you online!
