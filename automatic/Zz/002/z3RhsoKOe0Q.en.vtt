00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:06.600
 hey what's up we take the we 

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:09.360
 christoph and the george and in this 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.769
 Video is about a RhÃ¤tische contest 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.809
 we have to be at the same height 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.910
 it will be about one 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.199
 rhetorical contest and indeed are now 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.630
 my picture looks at you 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.400
 at times it is the raw file is the 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.109
 daniel i have some time ago 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.840
 photographed and we are doing now 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.150
 Each of us here has one 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.640
 hour time exactly one hour this 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.650
 picture decided and we dazzle 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.360
 you now equal to one, the final images 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.120
 however, we do not write about it 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.550
 who they are and you have to vote 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.370
 to which images tutorial wanted to see 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.399
 So your paper has to work that way 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.190
 but all levels are there then 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.899
 where appropriate, that the retouching images 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.559
 normal in an extra video explain too 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.940
 can 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.460
 I'm not at all interested in winning 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.760
 or lose and as I said one 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.989
 hour time is still very important 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.030
 external textures are in the grounds 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.399
 not allowed yes because everyone has one 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.159
 different database of textures 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.530
 and it would be unfair so it will only be with you 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.479
 photoshop with tube plugins in the loud 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.850
 brush tip if resist what it 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.860
 but it does not allow any strangers 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:22.340
 textures or backgrounds from the net 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:25.350
 or somehow they still ask 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:28.979
 as long then greedy and sitting at the 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:31.979
 Retouch and get now the final 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.780
 pictures and are already faded in and 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.650
 then write in the comments 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.600
 picture 1 to 2 or 3 and the picture with the 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.630
 most comments or 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.320
 it was mentioned was an extra time 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.890
 Video 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:50.240
 in this sense now the pictures and up 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.240
 soon then at the retouching
