00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.049
 [music] 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:09.889
 our what will go true knight and in the name of 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.289
 saving his beloved 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:14.840
 from the clutches of Satan himself will sacrifice 

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:17.060
 own life but is it necessary 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.640
 lord of the netherworld how about 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:22.369
 the immortality of the soul in the kingdom of Lucifer 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.800
 hits millions of sinners but fallen 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:27.980
 angel they are not too interesting 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:30.560
 liars and murderers and perjurers and so 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:33.710
 he belongs to the right another thing 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.610
 the pure soul of the seemingly direct person 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.060
 the road to heaven 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:43.310
 however we run ahead let's obo 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:44.090
 all in order the protagonist than the 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:47.570
 silver on 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.890
 Of course Dante himself is not the creator 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.680
 divine comedy 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.330
 our dan you are much better controlled with 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.520
 ball than goose feather 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:58.160
 and human blood had shed 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.650
 so much that would be enough for a whole lake and 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:04.040
 all in the name of the Lord under warranty 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:06.200
 absolution yes yes you are perfectly 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.600
 correctly guessed unlike dante 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.340
 the poet is the hero of this game knight 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.619
 accompanying king richard lion 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.100
 heart in the third crusade and 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:17.509
 participated in many battles 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.030
 performance of holy mission in practice 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:22.369
 turned into a brutal slaughter and spending 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.679
 several long years in the east hero 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:27.979
 decided to return home to my beloved 

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:28.609
 Beatrice however and at home he finds peace 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:32.229
 failed 

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:35.210
 beloved killed her soul in the power of satan 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:38.860
 why do you have to find out 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:40.890
 independently having passed all 9 circles of hell 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.810
 I 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.300
 basic gameplay principles 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.790
 dante's inferno we pass 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:50.369
 fairly straightforward level crumble 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:54.030
 crowds of enemies and from time to time decide 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:56.670
 simple puzzles of course 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.979
 extermination of a variety of monsters worth 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.229
 pay close attention to those 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.800
 more that the battle in dante's inferno not 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.869
 only fascinating but also spectacular 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:09.149
 Dante's main weapon reclaimed from 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:12.270
 death spit suitable for combat in the near 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.760
 and the average distance the goat allows 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.950
 apply fast but relatively weak 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.170
 blows either perform powerful but not 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.150
 too fast attack which 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.640
 open you to counter attacks 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.560
 Of course the scythe can reach far 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.380
 not to any foe and for such 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.750
 cases, Dante has a cross moreover 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.700
 as the story progresses, the hero will receive 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.340
 opportunity to learn some magical 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.920
 spells gradually gaining experience 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:47.850
 Dante also masters new attacks and 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:50.610
 combo simply buy and what 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:53.130
 more circles of hell to those left behind 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:56.190
 the main character becomes more powerful 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:58.860
 good he has someone to be we 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:02.280
 Of course, we are talking about level wasps 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:04.530
 they are huge they are hardy they are extremely 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.450
 rarely fight alone preferring 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.090
 set on dante whole hordes 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.970
 minions they are capable of one blow 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:14.310
 pretty shake the knight's health if 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.950
 Of course you can not figure out how to 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.709
 from this blow evade however bosses 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:22.079
 becomes surprisingly vulnerable and worth 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:24.420
 you find the right pain point after 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:26.250
 this battle success depends 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:29.340
 solely on the ability to use 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:32.160
 available arsenal of attacking means well 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.680
 and very quickly press the necessary buttons 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.489
 when the turn comes to perform the chain 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.489
 contextual actions 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.680
 dante's inferno is hardly surprising 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.380
 anyone new 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.660
 or original ideas of them here simply 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:59.090
 No, but among the representatives of their genre 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.810
 the project does not look dull 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.239
 average 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:04.870
 and surely will be able to win the devotees 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:04.870
 fans 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.310
 [applause] 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.310
 but
