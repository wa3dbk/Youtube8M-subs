 good afternoon keep cooking cheese in 

00:00:07.229 --> 00:00:11.370
 at home I have now decided 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.769
 cook it from the store, I milk 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:17.040
 bought four and a half liters and now 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:19.430
 will need to heat it to 35 degrees in 

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:23.490
 a small amount of water diluted 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:25.859
 cheese making enzyme and this water 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.810
 cool and we will need another sieve 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.849
 in order to draw us 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.010
 need thermometers you can run 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.300
 I will use electronic and can be 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:36.750
 here's a regular thermometer 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.199
 for home canning milk 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:43.110
 heated to 35 degrees 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:45.920
 Pour the enzyme and mix in 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.820
 for two or three minutes 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.269
 mix everything well for 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:54.540
 two or three minutes and leave for 30 minutes 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:58.220
 or for an hour to milk 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:01:02.720
 turned into such a jelly-like mass 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.720
 this is the so-called first transformation 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:11.090
 now received clot 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:17.690
 starting to cut with a knife 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:17.690
 first then across 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:33.670
 now i have set the pan with this one 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:37.460
 the resulting jelly mass i 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:40.340
 installed in the sink and poured hot water and 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.650
 now supporting pouring here in 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.600
 hot water boiling water is necessary 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:48.580
 keep the temperature inside the pan 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:51.200
 at level 38 39 degrees 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.880
 3 hours have passed and now this 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:02:01.490
 thickened curd need 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:02:04.000
 weigh off the serum let's see 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:07.100
 how much is obtained from store milk 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.709
 cheese last time already prepared 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.200
 I got a village from 10 liters 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:14.660
 rustic milk 2 kilograms are ready 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:20.690
 you and how much is not obtained from the store 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:22.700
 we know now we learn so from us 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.040
 It turned out of four and a half liters 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.650
 shop milk fat 32 two 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.450
 tenths of a percent 750 grams of this 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.570
 cheese mass now we draw 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:36.310
 in order to salt i add 10 12 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:36.310
 grams of salt here on this amount 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.720
 mix 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:49.700
 and now the cheese needs to be drawn for 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.390
 this I decided to use ham 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.370
 white-sided 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.920
 this is my first robot don't know what 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:03:05.800
 but you have to try 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:05.800
 experiment i will listen to marley 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.180
 because the cheese came from me somewhere 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.460
 so here is not very much pressed 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.760
 it will be bad forever I set yes just 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:25.010
 dad glass jar close 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:29.630
 lid and leave the rice in advance 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:35.240
 turning to dripping dripping 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:37.520
 serum and let it cost 12 hours have passed 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:41.500
 15 hours apart see 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:41.500
 and see what we did 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:04:00.800
 neatly suppress our shoot 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:02.840
 gauze wide wonderful cook 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.459
 he pressed it with ham 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.260
 eat with ham 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:09.560
 provide some homemade ham 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:13.720
 but we will cut homemade cheese and 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:17.510
 let's look at the structure of the crude here 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:21.109
 the cut we have is very beautiful well 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:24.880
 thick enough cheese and to taste 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:27.560

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.560
 look and admire in order to 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:39.260

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:47.320
 pots of the same serum 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:47.320
 Well, that remained from the preparation
