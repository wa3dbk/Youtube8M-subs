00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:16.759
 presented for the repair of a downhill slope what we need 

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:19.489
 that we wake up down the repairs 

00:00:19.489 --> 00:00:20.839
 rooms 

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:23.839
 a period not easy 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.539
 why lyon fra lyon 

00:00:29.979 --> 00:00:32.979
 it is very important to work in a room well 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.910
 the comfortable pace serge furrier of the retirement district 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:46.920
 between the pan 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.130
 a first one follows 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.130
 as on all repairs 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.100
 p let it dry 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.260
 I was surprised 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.260
 a second layer it is necessary that these bags 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.440
 I remove my characters 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.440
 I position by three 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.990

 last repair title 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.690
 because your combination 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.420
 persistent flow 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.160

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.390
 with M 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.950
 tell us country this surface 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.240

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.720
 a piece of wall take they used only the mclaren 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.350
 yet somewhat uncertain 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.350
 cut them out 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:13.249

 and let it dry 

00:02:34.679 --> 00:02:37.369
 as for the first and not enough for my taste 

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:40.369
 you have to apply two coats of paint 

00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:56.589
 it's very very strong 

00:02:59.229 --> 00:03:00.419
 here is head 

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:02.339
