00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.690 

I<00:01:03.589> have<00:01:04.589> been<00:01:04.769> surprised<00:01:05.159> when<00:01:05.309> people<00:01:05.400> have

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
I have been surprised when people have

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.490 
I have been surprised when people have
tested<00:01:06.119> positive<00:01:06.570> but<00:01:06.600> I've<00:01:06.869> been<00:01:07.080> more

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
tested positive but I've been more

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:15.230 
tested positive but I've been more
surprised<00:01:07.860> when<00:01:08.070> people<00:01:08.100> test<00:01:08.610> negative

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.350 

I<00:01:15.409> think<00:01:16.409> now<00:01:17.070> people<00:01:17.490> are<00:01:17.579> quite<00:01:17.850> aware<00:01:18.060> that

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
I think now people are quite aware that

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.870 
I think now people are quite aware that
they<00:01:18.509> have<00:01:18.659> to<00:01:18.810> be<00:01:18.960> 95%<00:01:19.530> adherent<00:01:20.460> however

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
they have to be 95% adherent however

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.760 
they have to be 95% adherent however
that's<00:01:21.119> pretty<00:01:21.450> difficult<00:01:21.990> for<00:01:22.229> some<00:01:22.470> people

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
that's pretty difficult for some people

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.429 
that's pretty difficult for some people
to<00:01:23.399> adhere<00:01:23.720> 95%<00:01:24.720> for<00:01:24.899> the<00:01:24.990> general<00:01:25.320> population

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
to adhere 95% for the general population

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.370 
to adhere 95% for the general population
taking<00:01:26.340> something<00:01:26.580> every<00:01:27.450> single<00:01:27.600> day<00:01:27.780> all<00:01:28.229> of

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
taking something every single day all of

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.800 
taking something every single day all of
us<00:01:28.830> forget<00:01:29.159> so<00:01:29.880> when<00:01:30.060> we<00:01:30.149> tell<00:01:30.360> people<00:01:30.539> they

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
us forget so when we tell people they

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.080 
us forget so when we tell people they
have<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.140> be<00:01:31.259> 95%<00:01:31.799> adherent<00:01:32.520> sometimes<00:01:32.939> they

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
have to be 95% adherent sometimes they

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.940 
have to be 95% adherent sometimes they
need<00:01:33.240> support<00:01:33.720> so<00:01:33.780> we're<00:01:34.080> building<00:01:34.439> systems

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:56.460 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.000 

I<00:02:56.690> think<00:02:57.690> what<00:02:57.870> hasn't<00:02:58.110> changed<00:02:58.350> is<00:02:58.800> there's

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
I think what hasn't changed is there's

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.920 
I think what hasn't changed is there's
still<00:02:59.100> a<00:02:59.250> lot<00:02:59.430> of<00:02:59.550> stigma<00:02:59.970> around<00:03:00.000> HIV<00:03:00.420> and

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
still a lot of stigma around HIV and

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.770 
still a lot of stigma around HIV and
AIDS<00:03:01.110> but<00:03:01.680> what<00:03:01.860> has<00:03:02.070> changed<00:03:02.100> is<00:03:02.820> in<00:03:03.120> terms<00:03:03.540> of

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
AIDS but what has changed is in terms of

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.590 
AIDS but what has changed is in terms of
the<00:03:03.900> treatment<00:03:04.230> and<00:03:04.650> in<00:03:05.610> terms<00:03:05.970> of<00:03:06.240> what<00:03:06.480> we

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
the treatment and in terms of what we

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.210 
the treatment and in terms of what we
can<00:03:06.750> offer<00:03:06.900> people<00:03:07.440> and<00:03:07.590> that<00:03:07.680> we<00:03:07.800> do<00:03:07.980> offer

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
can offer people and that we do offer

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.490 
can offer people and that we do offer
treatment<00:03:08.760> to<00:03:09.030> anybody<00:03:09.510> that<00:03:10.110> there's<00:03:10.290> no

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
treatment to anybody that there's no

cost involved in treatment in British

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.230 
cost involved in treatment in British
Columbia<00:03:13.140> which<00:03:13.290> is<00:03:13.320> fantastic<00:03:14.130> and<00:03:14.280> we<00:03:15.000> also

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240 
Columbia which is fantastic and we also

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.150 
Columbia which is fantastic and we also
know<00:03:15.690> that<00:03:15.720> it's<00:03:16.080> on<00:03:16.200> death<00:03:16.470> sentence<00:03:16.860> we<00:03:17.040> have

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
know that it's on death sentence we have

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.370 
know that it's on death sentence we have
people<00:03:17.460> in<00:03:17.520> the<00:03:17.640> public<00:03:18.000> eye<00:03:18.180> such<00:03:18.840> as<00:03:19.020> Magic

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
people in the public eye such as Magic

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.740 
people in the public eye such as Magic
Johnson<00:03:19.920> that's<00:03:20.100> in<00:03:20.430> there<00:03:20.610> living<00:03:21.150> with<00:03:21.270> HIV

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
Johnson that's in there living with HIV

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.530 
Johnson that's in there living with HIV
for<00:03:21.930> twenty<00:03:22.230> years<00:03:22.260> so<00:03:22.710> it's<00:03:23.280> a<00:03:23.460> that's<00:03:24.000> kind

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
for twenty years so it's a that's kind

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.150 
for twenty years so it's a that's kind
of<00:03:24.600> the<00:03:24.720> changes<00:03:25.170> that<00:03:25.350> have<00:03:25.500> happened<00:03:25.650> within

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
of the changes that have happened within

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:33.450 
of the changes that have happened within
the<00:03:26.370> last<00:03:26.400> twenty<00:03:27.360> years

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:33.460 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:35.940 

I<00:03:33.540> think<00:03:34.540> the<00:03:34.660> message<00:03:34.840> is<00:03:35.200> is<00:03:35.440> you<00:03:35.590> cannot<00:03:35.890> see

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
I think the message is is you cannot see

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.610 
I think the message is is you cannot see
HIV<00:03:36.760> and<00:03:37.120> if<00:03:37.480> you're<00:03:37.660> not<00:03:37.930> using<00:03:38.380> a<00:03:38.470> condom

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
HIV and if you're not using a condom

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.770 
HIV and if you're not using a condom
you're<00:03:38.950> putting<00:03:39.280> yourself<00:03:39.610> at<00:03:39.790> risk<00:03:39.850> so<00:03:40.690> you

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
you're putting yourself at risk so you

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.920 
you're putting yourself at risk so you
need<00:03:41.080> to<00:03:41.340> treat<00:03:42.340> everybody<00:03:42.810> unfortunately<00:03:43.810> as

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
need to treat everybody unfortunately as

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.830 
need to treat everybody unfortunately as
potentially<00:03:45.180> affected<00:03:46.180> with<00:03:46.330> a<00:03:46.360> disease

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
potentially affected with a disease

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.480 
potentially affected with a disease
until<00:03:47.230> you<00:03:47.350> can<00:03:47.500> prove<00:03:47.710> otherwise<00:03:47.890> and<00:03:48.430> that

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:48.490 
until you can prove otherwise and that

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:57.509 
until you can prove otherwise and that
means<00:03:49.180> getting<00:03:49.570> both<00:03:50.380> sex<00:03:50.980> partners<00:03:51.370> tested

in terms of normalizing HIV testing we

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.220 
in terms of normalizing HIV testing we
need<00:04:00.650> to<00:04:01.010> ask<00:04:01.579> everyone<00:04:02.180> who<00:04:02.540> has<00:04:02.780> not<00:04:02.989> had<00:04:03.170> a
