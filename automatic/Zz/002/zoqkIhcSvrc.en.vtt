00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:06.360
 Hello, today we talk Head 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:09.450
 and on painting porolonovyh fishes there on 

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:13.590
 the channel was already making video 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.809
 foam fish and many ask a question 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.090
 how do you paint foam rubber here i 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:21.060
 quickly cut a pair of well porolonovaya fish 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.190
 from the foams hears it is not very 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.650
 good such a good nonetheless working 

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:29.310
 normal ferries cut out such a fish 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:32.430
 after all he sags everything when he gets wet 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:36.059
 that is, the fish starts to move in the water 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.820
 and now I want to show the whole 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.460
 the process of painting foam rubber this paint 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.550
 if you do not know will not have a camera or a 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:48.379
 she's upstairs how transparent this paint 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.670
 I sat down with a can 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:53.760
 such spray cans are sold 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:57.210
 up car paint but it is acrylic 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.160
 paint and goes fluorescent she here 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.370
 it is written there on the cans to the left 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.709
 and here there are spray cans clogged nozzle 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.600
 these spray cans and she is no longer 

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:08.369
 driven to use she 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.009
 elementary removed here from 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.829
 cap and just poking around and merge here 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:15.869
 such here in the container and apply this paint 

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:19.469
 then it can be the world and paint and all 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:22.740
 bolts shake it shakes easily 

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:26.310
 I'll show you the shade now 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.770
 later we will turn off the light as Jura 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.689
 showed for his bait here in 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.409
 ultraviolet like silicone bait 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:36.149
 shine all say that pike perch 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.659
 all lures are ultraviolet 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:41.849
 I need then the body view he has there 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.609
 Crystal some words very such 

00:01:41.849 --> 00:01:47.369
 to zucchini crystals then but this is not for 

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:50.099
 us for us the main thing that especially his 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.380
 proshib pecked and everything is ok 

00:01:50.099 --> 00:01:54.389
 immediately said if the dry foam rubber 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.859
 paint foam 

00:01:54.389 --> 00:02:00.149
 I opened the coloring I will choose us 

00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:02.700
 wet completely foam such 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:07.789
 soaked with water and and now look 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:10.440
 pony tail 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:17.150
 Here it turns out this is possible on the other 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:20.819
 sides all painted tail became 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:23.280
 this color can tint tummy 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:26.160
 works by color working baits 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.970
 traveled here I already see a classic 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.739
 By the way, Jura is already behind the sheep and he liked it 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.870
 you see she does not wash off the paint 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:36.450
 the only thing I will tell you immediately when she 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:39.090
 the paint will dry it will become oak but not 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.459
 pay that she will become oak type 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:45.989
 oak foam will be it literally 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:48.660
 after 15 minutes of fishing in the water becomes 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:51.450
 soft and all this paint is so strong 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:54.780
 does not close pores foam 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.849
 and look I showed who wants 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.010
 see how to mount the ferry 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:01.290
 bait there is a video montage too and 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.489
 punching with these scissors 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.459
 double start all 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:07.950
 and then I put this foam rubber on the battery 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.959
 within 20-30 minutes it dries and 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.720
 back here so here for example 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.889
 apparently bring the markers 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:17.760
 permanent markers which are not 

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:22.579
 washed off with water and now an hour here I promised 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.579
 I do not know the light switches can be turned off 

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:33.840
 so I turn off I do not know the camera will give 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:35.790
 You see, here's the paint, but here it is 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.220
 literally it's a different paint such 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:41.910
 orange that's how it burns in water 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:45.419
 the foam itself loses such ugly water 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:50.209
 color gray all tails and belly burns 

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:50.209
 on right to say yes here's such 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.680
 the advantage of such foam over ordinary 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.810
 working and simple hem but 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.910
 the advantage of such foam that he 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.940
 good at catching twilight or overcast 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:10.290
 the weather that is when the light 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:11.290
 reservoir bad here such foam rubber at times 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.570
 better losers 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:17.570
 so please write comments 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:19.460
 who are interested ask questions on 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:22.280
 the production of painting if something is not 

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:24.260
 The clear answer for the wobbler will be the video I 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:28.010
 promised to make 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:30.440
 there will be a lot of videos he doesnâ€™t know Yura 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:34.190
 them here new painting in it blero mind 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:35.180
 This then just look at the blouse all 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:38.660
 no flow 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:40.460
 also as a factory linda under 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:43.240
 factory irai is wonderful on the floor 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:46.780

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:50.260
 all the best for new meetings 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.260
