00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.100 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.279 

the<00:00:34.940> idea<00:00:35.239> really<00:00:35.449> is<00:00:35.570> to<00:00:35.660> try<00:00:35.960> and<00:00:35.989> put<00:00:36.199> the

00:00:36.279 --> 00:00:36.289 
the idea really is to try and put the

00:00:36.289 --> 00:00:38.410 
the idea really is to try and put the
engineering<00:00:36.680> theory<00:00:37.039> into<00:00:37.250> practice<00:00:37.430> so

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420 
engineering theory into practice so

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:39.759 
engineering theory into practice so
students<00:00:38.839> have<00:00:39.019> to<00:00:39.140> start<00:00:39.379> from<00:00:39.589> a<00:00:39.739> clean

00:00:39.759 --> 00:00:39.769 
students have to start from a clean

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:41.889 
students have to start from a clean
sheet<00:00:40.219> of<00:00:40.280> paper<00:00:40.399> and<00:00:41.030> they<00:00:41.269> are<00:00:41.329> really<00:00:41.539> you

00:00:41.889 --> 00:00:41.899 
sheet of paper and they are really you

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:43.450 
sheet of paper and they are really you
know<00:00:42.019> designing<00:00:42.500> everything<00:00:42.649> on<00:00:43.039> that<00:00:43.070> makes

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.460 
know designing everything on that makes

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.149 
know designing everything on that makes
a<00:00:43.640> complete<00:00:43.969> single<00:00:44.780> seater<00:00:44.960> racing<00:00:45.050> car<00:00:45.589> so

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:46.159 
a complete single seater racing car so

00:00:46.159 --> 00:00:47.950 
a complete single seater racing car so
we<00:00:46.519> have<00:00:46.640> to<00:00:46.730> design<00:00:46.879> a<00:00:47.030> chassis<00:00:47.539> suspension

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
we have to design a chassis suspension

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.869 
we have to design a chassis suspension
we<00:00:48.769> have<00:00:48.890> to<00:00:48.980> choose<00:00:49.190> what<00:00:49.430> engine<00:00:49.760> we're

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:49.879 
we have to choose what engine we're

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:51.280 
we have to choose what engine we're
going<00:00:50.000> to<00:00:50.059> use<00:00:50.239> we<00:00:50.449> have<00:00:50.570> to<00:00:50.690> select<00:00:50.899> the<00:00:51.019> tires

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:51.290 
going to use we have to select the tires

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:53.079 
going to use we have to select the tires
so<00:00:51.949> it's<00:00:52.040> probably<00:00:52.190> about<00:00:52.339> the<00:00:52.489> most<00:00:52.519> open

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:53.089 
so it's probably about the most open

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:54.700 
so it's probably about the most open
open<00:00:53.449> race<00:00:53.570> in<00:00:53.719> Formula<00:00:53.750> series<00:00:54.469> that<00:00:54.589> there
