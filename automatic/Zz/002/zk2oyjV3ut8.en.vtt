00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.980
 and it's in your premises 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.470
 so of a 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.890
 carrez 1 

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:18.700
 db so I have enough bbc 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.440
 the advantage of this construction is 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.779
 that they were assembled went up in 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.340
 two days space 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.020
 these are panels that comes from a 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:29.260
 length up to 13 m in length 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:31.630
 at most including refacing 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:34.150
 sealing by the outside is chained 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.920
 t interior the installation of joinery so 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.720
 the two levels since we are in 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.989
 r + 1 have been assembled in the space of 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.820
 two days with roof terraces we 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:44.800
 opted for a heater for the 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:48.700
 wound with a thermodynamic balloon and 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:50.560
 a boxing profit the goal being to 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.660
 save time at home 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.250
 wood frame at the joints 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.560
 heating and sanitary 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.540
 so today we can say that 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.860
 we will be bbc and we can go 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.050
 faster than some builders 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.940
 this is our first saturated house 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.320
 wood so we have more of the 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.939
 do it for ourselves because it's a 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.500
 witness flag 

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:10.180
 we actually propose it to 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.040
 the child of other future customers a 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.140
 benefit for the customer a house of this 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.000
 type can be delivered from the moment 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.040
 from the start of the project to the 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.970
 key collection in the space of three to 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.130
 four months 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.750
 today houses of this type at a 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.880
 very good insulation more than 25 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:28.420
 centimeters at the thickness level of the 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.800
 walls we will win between 40 and 50% 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.500
 heating at the electricity level 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.870
 also by putting to call it we have 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.970
 any 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.650
 we have no loss at the level of 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.420
 heating since it is not at all 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.840
 electric souad be gas 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.910
 so it's a clean energy we 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.620
 We will also be able to propose 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.780
 heaters by type of gas pump 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.310
 heat to respect so the new 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.210
 thermal regulation that arrives at 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.520
 Next January 1st 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.020
 or be compliant or wc the advantage 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.750
 of actually our range 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.580
 today is that we propose in 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.740
 the range sees houses typically 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.330
 contemporary we do not do 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.310
 rustic or traditional is that 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:08.220
 terraced roofs with shapes 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.320
 geometric a bit peculiar we are 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.580
 able to respond to any request but 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.250
 the goal being to do something 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.210
 they come out a little out of the ordinary 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.820
 as you will see on some 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.440
 photos or videos we can do some 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.790
 wooden frame house with roof 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.160
 terrace with shapes a little 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.660
 different who are a little bit 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.480
 different from the region and that make 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.340
 really the very very nice thing for 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.720
 finish so the goal actually this is 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.610
 to be able to respond to a customer 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.620
 today a little more demanding a little 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.540
 youngest first-time buyers of 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.000
 enter their budget propose them 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.580
 different choices in heating 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.720
 but also to aesthetics to be a 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.300
 little different from others 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.400
 we can also offer them 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.140
 options for roof terraces 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.000
 we can also offer them 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.070
 enlargement options really be 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.110
 at the most of their budget and this type 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.540
 of buildings respond perfectly 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.670
 so to the new standards so we 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.170
 we are ecological we are economical 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.959
 via the charges that will be very very 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.790
 low it's also homes that have 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:07.650
 been thought about the provisions 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.180
 pieces that will allow for great 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.400
 brightness so he will respond to 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.440
 a customer's needs to their comfort and 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.910
 we will be able to meet a 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.860
 really a lot of criteria that 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.010
 will be able to satisfy and please the future 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.010
 customers
