then we'll set anything else and then he

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.310 
then we'll set anything else and then he
says<00:01:32.880> oh<00:01:33.060> he's<00:01:33.240> got<00:01:33.390> some<00:01:33.509> weird<00:01:33.689> blue<00:01:33.990> stone

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
says oh he's got some weird blue stone

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.960 
says oh he's got some weird blue stone
as<00:01:34.530> well<00:01:34.560> if<00:01:34.829> I<00:01:34.920> want<00:01:35.130> that<00:01:35.310> I<00:01:35.460> have<00:01:35.700> that<00:01:35.850> say

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
as well if I want that I have that say

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.240 
as well if I want that I have that say
yes<00:01:36.210> or<00:01:36.659> no<00:01:37.020> option<00:01:37.409> B<00:01:37.710> just<00:01:37.950> says<00:01:38.040> goodbye

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
yes or no option B just says goodbye

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.850 
yes or no option B just says goodbye
against<00:01:38.640> will<00:01:38.790> click<00:01:38.939> option<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.390> and<00:01:39.630> he<00:01:40.619> we

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
against will click option a and he we

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.740 
against will click option a and he we
were<00:01:40.979> given<00:01:41.189> a<00:01:41.250> pointless<00:01:41.549> Blue<00:01:41.820> Rock<00:01:42.060> ride

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
were given a pointless Blue Rock ride

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.480 
were given a pointless Blue Rock ride
Bobby<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.350> I<00:01:43.770> believe<00:01:44.009> I<00:01:44.070> was<00:01:44.189> in<00:01:44.310> some<00:01:44.430> a

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
Bobby and I believe I was in some a

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.800 
Bobby and I believe I was in some a
mature<00:01:44.759> here<00:01:45.060> okay<00:01:45.329> so<00:01:45.390> there<00:01:45.659> are<00:01:45.689> my

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
mature here okay so there are my

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.859 
mature here okay so there are my
pointless<00:01:46.170> blue<00:01:46.320> box<00:01:47.240> so<00:01:48.240> yeah<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.780> way

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
pointless blue box so yeah and the way

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.539 
pointless blue box so yeah and the way
this<00:01:49.049> works<00:01:49.320> is<00:01:49.590> it<00:01:49.890> uses<00:01:50.009> a<00:01:50.159> score<00:01:50.399> but

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
this works is it uses a score but

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:51.889 
this works is it uses a score but
there's<00:01:50.729> only<00:01:50.790> one<00:01:51.030> command<00:01:51.509> block<00:01:51.540> under

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
there's only one command block under

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.480 
there's only one command block under
here<00:01:52.079> and<00:01:52.259> basically<00:01:52.799> using<00:01:53.280> an<00:01:53.369> objective

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
here and basically using an objective

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.050 
here and basically using an objective
called<00:01:54.030> chat<00:01:54.479> and<00:01:54.780> it<00:01:55.320> sets<00:01:55.590> my<00:01:55.740> score<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.130> 1<00:01:56.399> if

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
called chat and it sets my score to 1 if

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.179 
called chat and it sets my score to 1 if
we<00:01:57.180> come<00:01:57.329> over<00:01:57.360> here<00:01:57.750> this<00:01:58.500> is<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.710> Redstone

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
we come over here this is the Redstone

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.459 
we come over here this is the Redstone
that<00:01:59.430> is<00:01:59.820> used<00:02:00.240> in<00:02:00.450> it<00:02:00.570> ignore<00:02:01.020> that<00:02:01.290> for<00:02:01.409> now

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
that is used in it ignore that for now

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:02.990 
that is used in it ignore that for now
that<00:02:01.680> was<00:02:01.770> an<00:02:01.890> old<00:02:02.040> attempt<00:02:02.340> I've<00:02:02.490> tried<00:02:02.759> and

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
that was an old attempt I've tried and

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.999 
that was an old attempt I've tried and
there's<00:02:03.840> actually<00:02:04.079> a<00:02:04.110> lot<00:02:04.290> simpler<00:02:04.649> than<00:02:04.740> it

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
there's actually a lot simpler than it

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:05.359 
there's actually a lot simpler than it
looks

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
looks

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.039 
looks
really<00:02:05.909> it's<00:02:06.060> not<00:02:06.149> that<00:02:06.210> bad<00:02:06.450> this<00:02:06.689> block<00:02:06.869> here

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
really it's not that bad this block here

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.570 
really it's not that bad this block here
is<00:02:07.259> again<00:02:07.590> that<00:02:07.770> was<00:02:07.890> my<00:02:07.920> test<00:02:08.250> one<00:02:08.429> that's

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
is again that was my test one that's

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:09.800 
is again that was my test one that's
exactly<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.030> same<00:02:09.119> as<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.330> one<00:02:09.420> over<00:02:09.450> there

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
exactly the same as the one over there

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.000 
exactly the same as the one over there
so<00:02:09.959> we<00:02:10.050> don't<00:02:10.200> even<00:02:10.319> need<00:02:10.470> that<00:02:10.670> let's<00:02:11.670> just

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
so we don't even need that let's just

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.820 
so we don't even need that let's just
get<00:02:12.489> rid<00:02:12.670> of<00:02:12.730> all<00:02:13.209> those<00:02:13.450> there<00:02:13.840> we<00:02:13.900> go<00:02:14.050> now

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
get rid of all those there we go now

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:15.930 
get rid of all those there we go now
what<00:02:14.980> we<00:02:15.040> have<00:02:15.069> here<00:02:15.340> we've<00:02:15.459> got<00:02:15.580> a<00:02:15.640> clock

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
what we have here we've got a clock

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.600 
what we have here we've got a clock
testing<00:02:16.599> all<00:02:16.840> of<00:02:16.989> these<00:02:17.140> blocks<00:02:17.440> now<00:02:18.220> in<00:02:18.400> these

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
testing all of these blocks now in these

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.180 
testing all of these blocks now in these
this<00:02:19.000> one<00:02:19.209> is<00:02:19.299> testing<00:02:19.659> photos<00:02:19.959> score<00:02:20.290> of<00:02:20.409> 6<00:02:20.799> so

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
this one is testing photos score of 6 so

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.820 
this one is testing photos score of 6 so
if<00:02:21.549> my<00:02:21.790> score<00:02:22.030> is<00:02:22.120> 6<00:02:22.330> this<00:02:22.599> trigger<00:02:23.019> this<00:02:23.620> one

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
if my score is 6 this trigger this one

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.149 
if my score is 6 this trigger this one
is<00:02:23.920> 5<00:02:24.159> this<00:02:24.640> one's<00:02:24.879> for<00:02:25.180> this<00:02:25.510> one's<00:02:25.690> 3<00:02:26.049> 2<00:02:26.590> &amp;<00:02:26.890> 1

00:02:27.149 --> 00:02:27.159 
is 5 this one's for this one's 3 2 &amp; 1

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:29.759 
is 5 this one's for this one's 3 2 &amp; 1
so<00:02:27.640> when<00:02:28.120> you<00:02:28.330> stand<00:02:29.170> on<00:02:29.200> the<00:02:29.319> pressure<00:02:29.530> plate

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:29.769 
so when you stand on the pressure plate

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:32.460 
so when you stand on the pressure plate
will<00:02:29.950> give<00:02:30.190> me<00:02:30.310> a<00:02:30.340> score<00:02:30.580> of<00:02:30.610> 1<00:02:31.049> this<00:02:32.049> will<00:02:32.170> fire

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
will give me a score of 1 this will fire

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.559 
will give me a score of 1 this will fire
so<00:02:32.769> this<00:02:33.040> will<00:02:33.340> activate<00:02:33.610> now<00:02:34.180> the<00:02:34.239> reason

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
so this will activate now the reason

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:36.210 
so this will activate now the reason
it's<00:02:34.720> like<00:02:34.989> the<00:02:35.410> reason<00:02:35.530> the<00:02:35.769> blocks<00:02:36.010> will<00:02:36.160> up

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
it's like the reason the blocks will up

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.190 
it's like the reason the blocks will up
here<00:02:36.489> is<00:02:36.849> because<00:02:37.239> if<00:02:37.480> the<00:02:37.780> command<00:02:38.019> blocks

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
here is because if the command blocks

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.740 
here is because if the command blocks
were<00:02:38.319> in<00:02:38.410> this<00:02:38.650> section<00:02:39.190> here<00:02:39.340> powering<00:02:40.120> this

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
were in this section here powering this

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.470 
were in this section here powering this
one<00:02:41.019> would<00:02:41.379> also<00:02:41.560> power<00:02:41.890> that<00:02:42.129> one<00:02:42.280> as<00:02:42.400> well

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
one would also power that one as well

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.330 
one would also power that one as well
whereas<00:02:43.480> with<00:02:43.690> this<00:02:43.870> in<00:02:44.079> this<00:02:44.769> setup<00:02:45.040> it

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
whereas with this in this setup it

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.190 
whereas with this in this setup it
powers<00:02:45.700> the<00:02:45.730> stone<00:02:46.090> block<00:02:46.360> which<00:02:46.599> powers<00:02:46.810> only

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
powers the stone block which powers only

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.170 
powers the stone block which powers only
one<00:02:47.379> command<00:02:47.739> block<00:02:47.799> so<00:02:48.459> now<00:02:48.700> is<00:02:48.760> just<00:02:48.970> for

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
one command block so now is just for

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.150 
one command block so now is just for
making<00:02:49.750> it<00:02:49.930> more<00:02:50.079> compact<00:02:50.500> or<00:02:50.739> making<00:02:50.950> it<00:02:51.040> look

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
making it more compact or making it look

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.979 
making it more compact or making it look
neater<00:02:51.340> you<00:02:51.609> could<00:02:51.760> zigzag<00:02:52.180> it<00:02:52.329> but<00:02:52.450> anyway

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
neater you could zigzag it but anyway

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:57.360 
neater you could zigzag it but anyway
ignore<00:02:53.319> that<00:02:53.910> so<00:02:54.910> when<00:02:55.329> you<00:02:55.599> get<00:02:55.840> this<00:02:56.620> test

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
ignore that so when you get this test

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.550 
ignore that so when you get this test
for<00:02:57.579> command<00:02:57.879> it<00:02:58.090> fires<00:02:58.569> it<00:02:59.049> says<00:02:59.230> this<00:02:59.379> one

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
for command it fires it says this one

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.520 
for command it fires it says this one
first<00:02:59.829> now<00:03:00.519> this<00:03:00.730> is<00:03:00.879> a<00:03:00.910> big<00:03:01.329> tell<00:03:01.870> raw<00:03:02.109> command

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
first now this is a big tell raw command

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
right back to the start

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.539 
right back to the start
it<00:03:33.220> fires<00:03:33.609> a<00:03:33.669> command<00:03:34.060> that<00:03:34.150> sets<00:03:34.569> my<00:03:35.560> score<00:03:36.340> to

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:39.270 
it fires a command that sets my score to
6<00:03:36.880> so<00:03:37.780> it<00:03:37.959> fires<00:03:38.260> this<00:03:38.530> one<00:03:38.709> over<00:03:38.889> here<00:03:39.099> and

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
6 so it fires this one over here and

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.949 
6 so it fires this one over here and
this<00:03:39.340> is<00:03:39.400> the<00:03:39.609> one<00:03:39.730> saying<00:03:40.000> farewell<00:03:40.569> friend

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.110 
and then it sets my score back to 0
again<00:03:43.389> so<00:03:43.680> that's<00:03:44.680> the<00:03:44.859> very<00:03:45.040> first<00:03:45.099> bit<00:03:45.609> so<00:03:45.970> if

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
again so that's the very first bit so if

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.479 
again so that's the very first bit so if
you<00:03:46.269> do<00:03:46.450> click<00:03:46.660> option<00:03:47.079> a<00:03:47.230> it<00:03:47.829> sets<00:03:48.160> your<00:03:48.280> score

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
you do click option a it sets your score

you do click option a it sets your score
to<00:03:48.639> 2<00:03:48.880> so<00:03:49.269> this<00:03:49.419> then<00:03:49.569> turns<00:03:49.780> off<00:03:50.049> and<00:03:50.560> this<00:03:50.709> one

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:50.859 
to 2 so this then turns off and this one

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:52.589 
to 2 so this then turns off and this one
turns<00:03:51.040> on<00:03:51.310> and<00:03:51.489> this<00:03:51.880> is<00:03:51.940> the<00:03:52.060> next<00:03:52.299> part<00:03:52.569> of

00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:52.599 
turns on and this is the next part of

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:54.690 
turns on and this is the next part of
the<00:03:52.720> conversation<00:03:52.840> and<00:03:53.500> then<00:03:54.220> yeah<00:03:54.430> every

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
the conversation and then yeah every

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.039 
the conversation and then yeah every
single<00:03:55.000> part<00:03:55.209> of<00:03:55.239> the<00:03:55.329> conversation<00:03:55.900> it

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:56.049 
single part of the conversation it

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:57.960 
single part of the conversation it
relates<00:03:56.500> to<00:03:56.620> one<00:03:56.829> of<00:03:56.950> these<00:03:57.040> lines<00:03:57.370> here<00:03:57.700> so

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
relates to one of these lines here so

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.750 
relates to one of these lines here so
it's<00:03:58.959> a<00:03:58.989> very<00:03:59.200> compact<00:03:59.950> way<00:04:00.220> of<00:04:00.340> doing<00:04:00.609> it's

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
it's a very compact way of doing it's

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.009 
it's a very compact way of doing it's
very<00:04:00.940> neat<00:04:01.150> way<00:04:01.180> of<00:04:01.329> doing<00:04:01.690> it<00:04:01.810> you<00:04:01.870> can<00:04:01.900> just

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019 
very neat way of doing it you can just

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:03.449 
very neat way of doing it you can just
pull<00:04:02.139> this<00:04:02.349> underneath<00:04:02.709> the<00:04:02.829> building<00:04:03.220> where

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
pull this underneath the building where

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:05.640 
pull this underneath the building where
your<00:04:03.609> NPC<00:04:04.150> is<00:04:04.359> and<00:04:04.660> it's<00:04:05.049> not<00:04:05.109> actually<00:04:05.260> that

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
your NPC is and it's not actually that

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.539 
your NPC is and it's not actually that
hard<00:04:06.489> to<00:04:06.790> do<00:04:07.569> yourself<00:04:07.720> the<00:04:08.049> only<00:04:08.230> doing<00:04:09.099> like

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:09.549 
hard to do yourself the only doing like

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:12.119 
hard to do yourself the only doing like
I'd<00:04:09.790> say<00:04:10.030> confusing<00:04:10.690> bits<00:04:10.870> might<00:04:11.410> possibly<00:04:11.680> be

00:04:12.119 --> 00:04:12.129 
I'd say confusing bits might possibly be

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:16.289 
I'd say confusing bits might possibly be
the<00:04:12.370> teller<00:04:13.150> or<00:04:13.389> command<00:04:14.489> but<00:04:15.489> I<00:04:15.790> might<00:04:16.150> do<00:04:16.269> a

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
the teller or command but I might do a

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:18.180 
the teller or command but I might do a
video<00:04:16.570> on<00:04:16.660> that<00:04:16.900> in<00:04:17.079> the<00:04:17.260> future<00:04:17.289> and<00:04:17.859> explain

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
video on that in the future and explain

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.279 
video on that in the future and explain
