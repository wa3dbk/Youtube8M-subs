 a support you do as raul is 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.879
 doing at the height of the hip that 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.190
 the support is at the same height as the 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:59.079

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:52.000
 repetitions approximately between 15 and 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:53.890

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.770
 raul because you need a partner already 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.820
 I said that series has to look 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:34.960
 a partner who shares our 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.789

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:57.960
 strawberry raspberry also chocolate 

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:59.730
 vanilla and banana in the www more point 

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:02.940
 strong dotcom raul here you have the water 

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:04.800
 take with I do not know if you like it more or less 

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:07.050
 thick liquefied if you can not see 

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:09.300
 100 milliliters throwing something better 

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:12.150
 well, let's try it, well, either 

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:13.890
 he knows it much more in the glass but apart 

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:17.580
 I would love it if I do not know if it's there 

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:19.530
 but it dissolves perfectly fix you already 

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:23.860

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:26.050
 staker good raul take it you enjoy it 

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:28.060
 it's a garden event but now 

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:30.520
 the fibers themselves are demanding that 

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:32.319
 protein and apart from protein this 

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:34.300
 supplement that is made so much for 

00:07:32.319 --> 00:07:36.729
 you as you are going to 

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:39.219
 bring a lot of things more vitamins 

00:07:36.729 --> 00:07:40.509
 and very important minerals too 

00:07:39.219 --> 00:07:42.520
 they have very small percentage of 

00:07:40.509 --> 00:07:44.229
 carbohydrates that are also needed 

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:46.389
 and more after the exercise and for 

00:07:44.229 --> 00:07:49.750
 protein assumption how is raul 

00:07:46.389 --> 00:07:51.550
 as rather I have not done anything else I think

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:55.500
