00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:07.590
 good friends this is the second part of 

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:09.790
 the little dog good 

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:12.880
 I open it 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:15.300
 already validated we will be like this if they look 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:19.370
 we already validated it 

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.370
 if you look here it says it's already activated 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:27.150
 well back when it looks like this we 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:29.460
 it is when we have just installed it 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.470
 let's the soul all the activation the 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.920
 activation method will be seen here is 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:39.210
 activation methods I choose the second 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.210
 which says sends activator 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.379
 there is one that I like is almost 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:50.399
 down to the bottom but I put 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:54.090
 pinch calling page cainco us web 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:58.070
 you like this rule they give you click 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.070
 there and it will be like that 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.039
 we would stay like that look 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:17.090
 this is how we would stay if we want 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:20.480
 add more of these 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:25.060
 in formosa within two 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:25.060
 good stretches to 2 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.320
 we enter to doc 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.820
 to add more without cones there are inside 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.170
 two 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.720
 we go where it says 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:42.090
 sun kutz 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.090
 we went into short cut to add more 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:49.930
 most uncomfortable in doc let's edit in 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:53.870
 the corner 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:57.940
 for example, which we want to add 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.940
 let's say I want to add facebook 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:04.590
 or itunes 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.590
 and we give 2 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.490
 we went out 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:13.610
 after a Saturday 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:17.350
 if you call me it seems facebook that itunes 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.350
 and if we want to delete them 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.600
 we want to erase the entered again to 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:29.790
 touch 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.790
 let's go through short cut 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.990
 to erase them is the 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:40.470
 edit 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:42.950
 for example I want to remove fingers from 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.530
 iTunes 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:49.720
 I'm in eliminating 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.720
 it's only going to be removed from the touch 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.940
 a how is it called 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:03:01.440
 we are not going to erase this application 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:04.190
 it's going to erase us, it's never going to be 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.190
 in the doka 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.250
 they do not expand because they are not going to be deleted 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.620
 it's just going to be the doc if you look here I have 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:17.640
 I facebook that I have it has not been 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:22.310
 deleted and there are 2 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:27.130
 that I have it only was deleted in doc 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:27.130
 If you look I do not have here is the way 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:33.320

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:35.720
 small introduction so that they learn to 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:38.780

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.730
