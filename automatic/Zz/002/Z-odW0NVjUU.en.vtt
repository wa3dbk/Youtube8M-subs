00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:05.730
 I entered the match 

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:07.950
 It was hot and we were a long time ago 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.269
 heat but how many workouts of 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.940
 there is a match today with a team 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.070
 It takes almost a month to say to us 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.740
 I do not think the team has consumed 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:20.730
 good and good has known of the lack of 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:23.039
 exercised we do not play well we win and 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.590
 we are happy the preparation is 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.109
 running well and the goal is to continue 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.699
 thus, the players of the 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.590
 real madrid front warning team 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.970
 traced the initial goal of the Germans and 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.680
 showed that little by little he's catching 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.110
 rhythm of competition thinking about the 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.210
 start of the season we have 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.329
 to work we have to work hard 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.440
 to improve because the season does not 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.210
 it's only two parties 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.649
 I think he played a lot that in 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.539
 that height we're going to get there 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.070
 well it's good to be able to do 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.340
 make it our game but we have to 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.230
 keep working to improve for 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.789
 start the season in the best way 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:03.090
 and good are more three friendly matches 

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:04.559
 and that not what then we have to win and 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.600
 The best way to get it is 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.520
 marking as many as the three achieved 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.940
 before the Germans two of benzema and one 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.800
 more for 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.350
 ronaldo Christian who already adds five in 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.720
 this preseason I feel happy because 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.300
 is part of my job for what 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.650
 main objective was to win the team 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.300
 it's very well I have the headquarters 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.900
 Christian with the universia hand but the 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:27.060
 the witness has also been good 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.220
 it has not been so spectacular but it has been 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.050
 a game that we work a lot 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.880
 the pressure and well I think it has been 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.100
 a triangle for us to see if it has 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.840
 been your important an encounter 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.580
 more and there are four transfers 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.140
 they returned to perform at a high level all 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.000
 they have fit perfectly and 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.370
 they show match to match the reasons 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.580
 to wear the white shirt is 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:49.320
 away you're in a good preseason 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.210
 it affects us mind 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.100
 the new players that arrive in 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.860
 madrid and the match was being good 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.140
 same and did the best for us 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.290
 because it says a little more about those who 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.780
 they were already and we have to take out 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.229
 forward all the game and improve each 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.229
 training
