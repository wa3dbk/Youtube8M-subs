so confused and then I just blended it

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:37.800 
so confused and then I just blended it
into<00:01:36.100> little<00:01:36.220> the<00:01:36.460> way<00:01:36.610> that<00:01:36.850> I<00:01:36.880> wanted<00:01:37.450> and<00:01:37.690> it

into little the way that I wanted and it

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.350 
into little the way that I wanted and it
took<00:01:38.020> sort<00:01:38.500> of<00:01:38.620> my<00:01:39.040> whole<00:01:39.520> took<00:01:39.730> a<00:01:39.820> sort<00:01:40.150> of<00:01:40.240> a

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
took sort of my whole took a sort of a

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.940 
took sort of my whole took a sort of a
long<00:01:40.510> time<00:01:40.750> but<00:01:40.930> not<00:01:41.140> too<00:01:41.410> much<00:01:41.470> of<00:01:41.710> a<00:01:41.800> long

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
long time but not too much of a long

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.130 
long time but not too much of a long
time<00:01:42.220> until<00:01:42.790> I<00:01:42.970> got<00:01:43.180> it<00:01:43.360> to<00:01:43.510> like<00:01:43.720> the<00:01:43.870> perfect

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
time until I got it to like the perfect

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.130 
time until I got it to like the perfect
consistency<00:01:44.650> and<00:01:45.430> it<00:01:45.880> is<00:01:46.030> sort<00:01:46.330> of<00:01:46.390> hard<00:01:46.690> to<00:01:46.810> do

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
consistency and it is sort of hard to do

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:56.820 
consistency and it is sort of hard to do
so<00:01:47.530> just<00:01:48.520> be<00:01:48.729> patient<00:01:48.970> with<00:01:49.330> it
