00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:10.400
 a greeting to all friends of 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:13.269
 androidworld.it after seeing the 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:16.700
 review of 8 n 1 with kolarov 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:18.470
 that is, it is depersonalized as an afterthought 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.750
 having seen how to install cyanogenmod 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:23.540
 after a few days of testing it arrived 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:26.930
 the moment of non cyanogenmod of course 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:31.239
 but cyanogenmod to see like this 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:33.920
 let gen mode run on 8 n 1 then 

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:37.550
 I remember meanwhile that cyanogenmod is 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.289
 officially supported by or what 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.879
 means this means that the 

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:43.249
 installation procedure is a lot 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:45.859
 simple but you have already seen from ours 

00:00:43.249 --> 00:00:50.300
 previous video otherwise go and do it is 

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:52.249
 very simple and is certified thing 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.280
 means certified means that the 

00:00:52.249 --> 00:00:57.019
 gaffes or google maps are 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.149
 pre-installed does not need is not there 

00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:01.100
 need to install two packages if 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:02.390
 you know the cyanogenmod pressing you know 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.409
 what am i talking about 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.050
 the fact that it's a hair movie 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:07.970
 certificate also means that it is not a 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:12.440
 firmware router not root permissions 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:13.910
 it's a firmware like any other I give you 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.680
 I apologize a little for the color of 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:16.970
 this video unfortunately the light with which 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:21.020
 I'm doing in this shoot is not 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:23.360
 optimal but in short it should be well 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.920
 more than clear these 8 n 1 we do not know 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.120
 see the review with choir s 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:32.030
 and this is cyanogenmod then widget 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:33.890
 widgets in the screen lock possibility of 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.890
 enable the camera quickly from 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.080
 here and holding down possibility of 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.420
 open the browser calls 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.700
 music messages or unlock the 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.830
 phone directly from the interface is 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.880
 You can customize the home screen 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.060
 such as 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.100
 cyanogenmod version 10.2 then for 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.750
 example I have increased the number of 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.360
 icons that can be seen of the con 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.130
 screen in the notification bar if the 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.170
 drag from the left we have the bar 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.350
 of notifications if you drag it from the right 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.479
 We see it all and rapid Sen. 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.579
 in short, the circular battery if 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:09.759
 you know the firmware you will find some 

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:12.110
 everything you are used to 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:15.640
 we have the personalization of 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:19.160
 screen with the lock screen 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:21.470
 of the themes and the interface a little 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.170
 in general this menu is in quotes 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.060
 anything but intuitive well be clear 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.340
 actually Italian so it takes a while 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:31.910
 However, a search with respect to those es 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:34.060
 for example it is definitely a menu of 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.410
 more geeky settings to which 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.090
 probably accustomed you were there 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.299
 watching this video are present 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:44.299
 those profiles that are custom me 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:46.849
 I disabled them but you can manage them from 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:49.910
 here and then change them by holding the 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:54.019
 power button I turned them off 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:57.079
 because I don't need it is all enough 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:59.010
 everything you can imagine from 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:01.799
 this smartphone 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.239
 I already showed you off he did 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:04.530
 see if they have gen no not in 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:06.030
 particular but we have already done it 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.250
 see we are gen in various ways in various 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.170
 ways so i won't be watching you for a while 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.909
 all the settings but what 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:16.230
 I want to show in particular are the 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:20.329
 novelties that are present just thanks 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:25.530
 a cyanogenmod for example well meanwhile the 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:27.560
 camera that I remind you rotates 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.909
 camera is natively supported 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:33.420
 so now i 'm picking up the 

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:38.489
 my hand below, but if I rotate, here it is 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:41.459
 that our android appears is another 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:42.090
 what because I want to show you is the o 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:44.099
 click 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:48.840
 we were already in the god settings menu 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:51.000
 click that this remote control of which it has 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.280
 already spoken even in a focus that is 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:04:00.090
 perfectly supported by cyanogenmod 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:04:01.650
 so now I click and it doesn't happen 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:05.790
 absolutely nothing because it is not 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:13.639
 configured or click 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:13.639
 ops connect 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:19.019
 ok after a few minutes of attempts not 

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:21.150
 I managed to do official click 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:24.360
 so I show you the menu of 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.800
 configuration here it is that is similar or 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.770
 almost identical to that of those is 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:32.850
 so we can take photos find 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:34.590
 the phone make it ring when the 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:36.630
 phone is near click or when the 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.070
 phone is far to from or click 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:41.040
 but obviously the fact that he doesn't have 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:44.520
 worked is not exactly a 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:47.010
 great sign back there is an air 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:49.350
 square that made me very chic to make you 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:52.170
 see between success that is touch 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:55.440
 it's called or touch and it's not compatible 

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:57.200
 with cyanogenmod honestly it is both a 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.490
 good that an evil is good because 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:01.530
 honestly even on those east is not 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:03.620
 particularly useful is bad because 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:13.260
 maybe cyanogenmod is the opportunity for 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:22.640
 make it more interesting then vi 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:22.640
 I show the browser then chrome 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:44.099
 we await the loading we are waiting for 

00:05:41.939 --> 00:05:48.289
 we are waiting for hd all the images as 

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:48.289
 we had done in the kolarov test 

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:53.819
 ok it should have done it 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:57.629
 so at this point we can 

00:05:53.819 --> 00:06:00.150
 make scroll you see is the speed is 

00:05:57.629 --> 00:06:05.219
 Great 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:05.849
 double tap for zoom pinch zoom out e 

00:06:05.219 --> 00:06:08.909
 zhu min 

00:06:05.849 --> 00:06:10.229
 therefore still good performances for 

00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:11.699
 regarding the experience in general 

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:14.969
 user 

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:18.569
 I preferred colors because why 

00:06:14.969 --> 00:06:21.240
 added something more to android 

00:06:18.569 --> 00:06:23.219
 are gen mode in version 10.2 

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:26.909
 achieves so many functions of the 

00:06:23.219 --> 00:06:29.129
 make it particularly innovative though 

00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:31.919
 however, they are two very useful experiences 

00:06:29.129 --> 00:06:33.539
 different and both excellent color for 

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:35.939
 example does not make me crazy from the point of 

00:06:33.539 --> 00:06:38.009
 aesthetic view while the stock of 

00:06:35.939 --> 00:06:40.409
 android with some finishing of 

00:06:38.009 --> 00:06:42.120
 cyanogenmod I do not mind is a 

00:06:40.409 --> 00:06:43.680
 however a bit rough version I admit 

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:46.349
 because for example these feel here is 

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:48.930
 a 5 inch phone and 9 are 

00:06:46.349 --> 00:06:50.539
 huge they could certainly could 

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:52.139
 certainly be better than that 

00:06:50.539 --> 00:06:53.909
 at the interface the camera is 

00:06:52.139 --> 00:06:56.310
 obviously that stock of android that 

00:06:53.909 --> 00:06:58.379
 has everything to lose compared to 

00:06:56.310 --> 00:07:00.659
 an interface in this area the prize 

00:06:58.379 --> 00:07:03.210
 musical apollo and instead it is very much 

00:07:00.659 --> 00:07:04.740
 good and very very nice especially if 

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:08.189
 you know it 

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:10.770
 if not, try to try it 

00:07:08.189 --> 00:07:12.360
 for the rest it is not that there is such a thing 

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:14.250
 the torch is there to show you 

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:16.830
 pre-installed or Russian salad 

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:19.020
 rutler just to show you the permissions 

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:25.729
 root is not there so it is not a rom 

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:29.389
 ruth and then the torch goes well the torch 

00:07:25.729 --> 00:07:33.839
 which will not be will not be as beautiful as 

00:07:29.389 --> 00:07:36.529
 graphically like that of god does however 

00:07:33.839 --> 00:07:38.969
 very well his duty 

00:07:36.529 --> 00:07:43.830
 this was a very quick test of 

00:07:38.969 --> 00:07:45.240
 open1 with 10.1 stock if it is like this 

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:47.669
 we can therefore say official 

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:49.529
 installed on your smartphone 

00:07:47.669 --> 00:07:53.120
 a greeting to all we will give is not cisotti 

00:07:49.529 --> 00:07:53.120
