00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:10.030
 the image corresponds to a flight 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:12.460
 performed on Wednesday , January 23 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:14.080
 previous I observed as in screen 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:17.020
 enter an object that moves 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.610
 quickly under the aircraft the 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.279
 video was captured by the pilot 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:24.040
 comercial jose daniel araya who counts 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:28.060
 With more than 500 flight hours we arrived at 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:30.460
 a flight 447 and I saw the sunrise that was 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.790
 very nice then I really put the 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:35.710
 cellular nothing more to record against the wifi 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.770
 and aggravate the approach that is something 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:42.460
 what I do normally and separately for the 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:44.260
 dawn of I think good idea I put it 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:49.150
 simply and still attending the 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:51.700
 capital and suddenly I came back to see the 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:56.620
 camera a little bit and I heard it when the 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:01:00.160
 object finishes passing I peeked and came 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:02.050
 and there is nothing already but afterwards as 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.390
 Payroll does not pay attention when 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.070
 I arrived at the louis house and saw that there was no 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.890
 travel 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.960
 size piece for him the image is 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:14.500
 eloquent and attention should be paid 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:18.310
 it seems that if something happens that is normal 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:21.880
 with a different color than what you can 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:25.600
 give a plane and at a speed that a 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.890
 airplane at that height not normal for 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.050
 look for an answer to what happened 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.150
 we went to the astronomer jose alberto 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:34.930
 villalobos and the student of the phenomenon 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:36.759
 UFO Alexis acts Villalobos calculates that 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.070
 the object on the screen can have a 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:41.110
 long between 7 and 10 meters 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.690
 displacement would eventually reach 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.520
 the 3,600 kilometers per hour seven 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.860
 times more than the ship from which 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.720
 he captured the image but he could be 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.390
 a reflection product of the lens of the 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.850
 camera considered more reflection by the 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.970
 fact that it is not defined or is not 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:00.070
 you do not see him say a structure of 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:05.260
 small plane or an ultralight 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:09.369
 but rather like as a speck of 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:12.250
 let's say from window that is reflected in 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.930
 the on the surface of the ground 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.150
 for its part acts does not rule out that it is 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.970
 an object but also second theory 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:22.150
 of the reflection in the video you can see 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.400
 something that happens but we can not define if 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.010
 it is a solid object or not without 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.890
 But I've seen cases before 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:32.200
 of photographs that they send me and this 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.700
 they are effectively reflections of foci of 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.920
 very strong light more now that we have the 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.320
 sun in midsummer then it could 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.730
 be a reflection eventually the 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.620
 sighting of the southern area is not 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.680
 strange since that region of the country 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:47.500
 there are constant reports yes yes they have 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.570
 come a lot of testimony from 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.780
 people who have seen lights coming out 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:55.050
 of the sea in the coastal area is the area 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:59.710
 from for example palm north palms south 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:01.870
 this lights coming out come from the sea 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:03.220
 look like ship lanterns but 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.830
 that they are not because people are already 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.840
 used to seeing the image 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.580
 We show as such and with the criterion of 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.940
 the experts draw your own 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.940
 conclusions
