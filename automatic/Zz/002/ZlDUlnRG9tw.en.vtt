Something’s missing in this closed off world

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:44.650

Someone has certainly been looking beyond the horizon

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.250

that melts at ground level

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:06.430
望んだものが　偽りだとしても
Even if what I wished for is nothing but a lie

If in the end time turns into truth

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:19.850

then meaning and reason would really exist, right?

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:25.230
だけど見向きもしないでしょう
But it’ll be looked right past won’t it?

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:32.070

as I’m preparing to return home, it’s a lonely journey

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:44.830

Afterwards, after this dream, everyone will wave their hands

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.650

for some reason is in the nostalgic sky

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:12.670
儚げに　おぼろげに　どうしてそんな不安そうに
Fleetingly and vaguely, why so seeming anxiously

but even so my cloudy sake reflected the moon

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:46.950
近く楽園はもう　永遠じゃないと知り
Knowing that the close by paradise is no longer eternal

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:52.350
静かに役を終える
and quietly ending your duty

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:56.250

for example even if that day did come

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:03.050

you would continue to remain the same as you are wouldn’t you?

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:07.710
故に、永遠の巫女
And so, would be an eternal shrine maiden

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:14.190

everything that was forgotten

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:49.570
それは東の国の　名前のない御伽噺
That’s the nursery rhyme without a name from that eastern country

Far away off in the distance, the fantasies that were lost

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:58.870
続いてく
continue on
