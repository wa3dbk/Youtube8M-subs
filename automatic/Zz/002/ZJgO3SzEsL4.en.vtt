00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.390
 hello everyone today I bring you something 

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:06.669
 you may know if you want to see 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:08.500
 videos of things pancakes in games and 

00:00:06.669 --> 00:00:10.900
 If not, I've taught you something new 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.690
 this game is quite known for its 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:16.449
 esther pérez or easter eggs 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:18.730
 translated into Spanish especially about 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:20.140
 they are pretty bad roll and as I do not know 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.210
 They put a crepe and pasta of it 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.829
 quite absurd by the way I 'm not going to 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.419
 disprove the crepe and pasta good in 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:27.669
 really yes but what I want to do 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:28.449
 with this video is to explain why 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:30.039
 those images 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:32.320
 apart from telling you a bit about how 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:34.090
 this game consists because the truth is 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.310
 quite interesting who gets the 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:38.080
 merit of discovering the meaning 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:39.820
 images take it badly because if not 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:42.760
 out for the new video given of 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:45.220
 of none of this so well let's start 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.990
 Let's talk first about the camera before 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.150
 you will wonder what it is or 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:51.100
 I'm going to the chamber, you will not see it in a 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.080
 peripheral created by game freak that 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.420
 allowed to take pictures is from your dembow and 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.520
 edit them this accessory was fought 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.080
 until the gameboy advance you could also 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.430
 make screenshots of certain 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.320
 videogames the quality of 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:06.340
 photographs was not much of a thing 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:08.350
 resolution was 128 by 112 pixels 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.119
 color was four gray shades and if 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.369
 there was not much light the photographs 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:14.679
 they barely looked but despite all that 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:16.600
 the artist drew a lot of attention 

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:19.450
 Jong Luso for the cover of his album 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.890
 silver and gone and some people 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.479
 they have the courage to even do 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.459
 music video clips using these 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:26.170
 images the only downside that would take them 

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:28.119
 it was that he had a very memory space 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.369
 limited and luckily you could buy 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:32.740
 a device called well void printer 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:34.569
 to print them but it was more expensive than 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.490
 the gameboy camera although now there's 

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:38.229
 programs to do it from the pc a 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.780
 curious fact is that the camera won the 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:42.880
 guinness prize in 1999 for being the 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.130
 smaller camera but did not have much 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.049
 success and very few were sold to me the 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.759
 really I hit me a lot about this and I 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:51.340
 I would love to get some day though 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:53.079
 I 'm sure it's too expensive now 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.119
 let's talk about the games and the camera that 

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:56.950
 came with about 4 mini games that like 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:59.379
 you can imagine it could be you 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.959
 face to play is to say the character 

00:01:59.379 --> 00:02:04.000
 I would have your face or in one of the mini 

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:05.799
 Boxing games to your face too 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.799
 you could do animations and take out many 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:10.819
 photos of followed and other things but what 

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:12.950
 who made this famous were not 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:17.260
 the minigames and the fact of being able to take 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.260
 photos and edit them if not these images 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.610
 what are those images doing? 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.530
 you will ask between the options of 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.630
 game was a menu that seemed 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.870
 taken from a re pgr with an option 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.820
 call room or execute if you gave it 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.670
 click we run into these three images 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:49.490
 but the most disturbing was this with the 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.200
 message guard running down translated 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:53.330
 in Spanish as of who is going up 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.610
 in addition to the disturbing music that 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.930
 it sounded when you gave the screen and you 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.670
 it was frozen for a few seconds 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.440
 just a picture of a map of 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.140
 Africa with the phrase you are crossing the 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.360
 Ecuador in the Japanese version there were two 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:08.930
 faces plus another message that used to come out 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:12.050
 was where bits özil and forgive me for 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:14.690
 English produced in Spanish would be no 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:16.370
 be silly is that he used to go 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.560
 times alone when the game gave error 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.210
 that produced that many children picked 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.280
 fear of playing another game error 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:24.560
 there was a stream was when the photos were 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.090
 they edit alone sometimes it was not right 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.700
 editor the eyes the mouth the nose 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.800
 etcetera and in the end it ends up giving as 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.050
 result very disturbing things according to 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.490
 tell the legend these images are said 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:35.930
 that were made to some people who 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:37.040
 they were kidnapped by a sect 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.810
 satanic 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.329
 one of the images bears a star 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.859
 on the forehead from when the 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:44.900
 little stars that hit us in the face 

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:47.780
 when we were little they are stars 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:50.269
 satanic I thought they were so worth 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.769
 the images are disturbing but the 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:53.420
 gameboy camera was used to 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:55.579
 promote a zombie movie 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.530
 called bio zombie the images 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:59.780
 mainly belong to members of the 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:01.879
 nintendo staff how I discovered this 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.680
 simple looking at the game credits and 

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:05.659
 looking for images of those people by 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.549
 misfortune I only found two of those 

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:10.010
 five people since there are no images of 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:13.129
 all the staff two of them were that neither 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.930
 yamamoto and yoshio sakamoto I also thought 

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:17.479
 that the woman in the photo will be hattori 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.759
 but she did not participate in this 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:22.130
 video game sentences this I'm not 

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:24.889
 very safe but that each one believes what 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:27.770
 want the one about do not be silly would you refer 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:30.440
 to the typical phrase of that can not be 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:32.090
 to do since it was a mistake that came out like this 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.280
 connected bad console the printer 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.889
 just that as the game had its flaws 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:39.229
 he left when he wanted and the phrase of 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:41.210
 of who is going up I think it would be 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:43.639
 a reference to the zombie movie 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:45.560
 or that or making a joke as they rum 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:47.750
 it also means running to part of 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.940
 execute as I said the latter is not 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.710
 fixed but the most reasonable I think that 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:53.780
 no one nor then give a logic to these 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:55.220
 images as people rather 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:57.020
 take advantage of this kind of thing to 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:58.729
 increase visits in videos without 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.380
 give no explanation and because they are 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:01.039
 those things there making the rumor 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.660
 increase 

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:04.580
 I do not think nintendo did this with 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.800
 bad intention because if you look closely 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.569
 in the standard images he has hit from 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.460
 funny way like when we were kids 

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:13.220
 and we painted mustaches to the posters of 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:15.650
 bag to match or in magazines and 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:17.210
 newspapers I do not think that this game 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:18.949
 was directed exactly to the public 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:21.680
 childish since a digital camera in 

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:23.479
 that era was a whole past seems to be 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.550
 that people just noticed things 

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:28.009
 the faces of the game have many more 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:30.139
 secrets as in the credits in which 

00:05:28.009 --> 00:05:32.150
 pressed twice the time they left 

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:34.070
 they followed miyamoto dancing there are people 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:36.380
 who says that this gives bad news and such 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:38.659
 but I found it funny so 

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:42.220
 well this has been all I hope that you 

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:42.220
 have liked and until next time
