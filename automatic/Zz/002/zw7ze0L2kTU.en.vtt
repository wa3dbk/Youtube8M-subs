00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:46.860 

nicer<00:02:45.430> than<00:02:45.459> I<00:02:45.609> thought<00:02:45.670> they<00:02:45.969> they<00:02:46.629> look<00:02:46.780> a

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
nicer than I thought they they look a

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.140 
nicer than I thought they they look a
lot<00:02:47.079> better<00:02:47.439> than<00:02:47.530> person<00:02:48.510> not<00:02:49.510> to<00:02:49.540> be<00:02:49.810> honest
