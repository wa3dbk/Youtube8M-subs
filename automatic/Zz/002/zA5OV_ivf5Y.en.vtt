00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.550 

it's<00:00:42.820> all<00:00:43.030> about<00:00:43.060> red<00:00:43.750> than<00:00:44.020> different<00:00:44.350> kind

it's all about red than different kind

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.890 
it's all about red than different kind
of<00:00:44.740> red<00:00:44.920> and<00:00:45.190> it's<00:00:45.340> also<00:00:45.520> a<00:00:45.910> line<00:00:46.150> now<00:00:46.330> with<00:00:46.870> a

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:46.900 
of red and it's also a line now with a

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.330 
of red and it's also a line now with a
twist<00:00:47.230> but<00:00:47.380> I<00:00:47.440> mean<00:00:47.620> we<00:00:47.740> thought<00:00:47.890> that<00:00:47.920> it<00:00:48.190> that

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:48.340 
twist but I mean we thought that it that

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:49.770 
twist but I mean we thought that it that
will<00:00:48.490> become<00:00:48.580> too<00:00:48.850> predictable<00:00:48.970> substrate

beautiful<00:02:08.820> and<00:02:08.940> glamorous<00:02:09.149> but<00:02:09.660> only<00:02:09.959> us<00:02:10.200> who

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
beautiful and glamorous but only us who

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.960 
beautiful and glamorous but only us who
are<00:02:10.619> a<00:02:10.649> part<00:02:10.979> of<00:02:11.100> it<00:02:11.250> know<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:11.670> amount<00:02:11.820> of

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.070 
effort in the hard work that goes into

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:15.979 
effort in the hard work that goes into
doing<00:02:14.550> something<00:02:14.760> like<00:02:15.030> this<00:02:15.209> but<00:02:15.600> it's<00:02:15.780> fun<00:02:15.959> I

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989
