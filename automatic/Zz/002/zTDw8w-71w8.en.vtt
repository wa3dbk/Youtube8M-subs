00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
didn't want a lot of air mass around me

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.160 
didn't want a lot of air mass around me
and<00:01:01.800> actually<00:01:02.579> started<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.300> sweat<00:01:04.140> or

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
perspire a little bit more so I just

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:07.760 
perspire a little bit more so I just

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
original configuration and that let some

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.940 
original configuration and that let some
air<00:01:11.369> flow<00:01:11.670> around<00:01:11.880> me<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:12.930> that<00:01:13.229> just<00:01:13.740> kind<00:01:13.890> of

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
air flow around me and that just kind of

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.980 
air flow around me and that just kind of
put<00:01:14.130> these<00:01:14.280> underneath<00:01:14.640> me<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:15.270> it<00:01:15.720> just<00:01:15.869> made

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.550 

taking<00:02:12.370> a<00:02:12.459> little<00:02:12.700> Kershaw<00:02:13.120> again<00:02:13.510> and<00:02:13.750> just

taking a little Kershaw again and just

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.720 
taking a little Kershaw again and just
kind<00:02:14.799> of<00:02:14.860> running<00:02:15.129> it<00:02:15.220> through<00:02:15.250> its<00:02:15.519> paces

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
kind of running it through its paces

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.780 
kind of running it through its paces
right<00:02:16.150> now<00:02:16.329> and<00:02:17.010> just<00:02:18.010> wanted<00:02:18.340> to<00:02:18.370> see<00:02:18.579> how<00:02:18.760> it

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
right now and just wanted to see how it

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.770 
right now and just wanted to see how it
would<00:02:19.150> carve<00:02:19.510> up<00:02:19.750> on<00:02:20.970> some<00:02:21.970> projects<00:02:22.480> if<00:02:22.660> you

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
would carve up on some projects if you

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.420 
would carve up on some projects if you
needed<00:02:23.049> to<00:02:23.140> do<00:02:23.290> some<00:02:23.500> things<00:02:23.739> and<00:02:24.040> we've<00:02:24.310> been

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
needed to do some things and we've been

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.099 
needed to do some things and we've been
running<00:02:24.609> this<00:02:24.849> knife<00:02:25.060> for<00:02:25.329> a<00:02:25.359> day<00:02:25.540> now<00:02:25.780> and

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:26.109 
running this knife for a day now and

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:28.860 
running this knife for a day now and
just<00:02:26.680> you<00:02:27.340> can<00:02:27.370> see<00:02:27.670> if<00:02:27.819> I<00:02:27.970> want<00:02:28.209> to<00:02:28.390> I<00:02:28.420> can<00:02:28.660> take

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
just you can see if I want to I can take

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:34.470 
just you can see if I want to I can take
off<00:02:29.109> big<00:02:30.480> big<00:02:31.480> cuts<00:02:32.579> from<00:02:33.579> this<00:02:33.790> knife<00:02:34.000> and

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
off big big cuts from this knife and

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.809 
off big big cuts from this knife and
it's<00:02:34.720> still<00:02:34.989> still<00:02:35.890> holding<00:02:36.280> its<00:02:36.430> edge<00:02:36.579> up

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:36.819 
it's still still holding its edge up

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:39.240 
it's still still holding its edge up
very<00:02:37.569> nicely<00:02:37.870> the<00:02:38.829> reason<00:02:39.069> that<00:02:39.130> we're

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
very nicely the reason that we're

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.800 
very nicely the reason that we're
running<00:02:39.340> this<00:02:39.639> knife<00:02:39.819> is<00:02:40.120> that<00:02:40.180> it's

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
running this knife is that it's

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.620 
running this knife is that it's
inexpensive<00:02:41.290> and<00:02:41.709> I<00:02:42.489> say<00:02:43.269> that<00:02:43.480> it's

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
inexpensive and I say that it's

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.050 
inexpensive and I say that it's
inexpensive<00:02:44.349> not<00:02:44.859> cheap<00:02:45.250> there's<00:02:45.970> a

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
inexpensive not cheap there's a

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.610 
inexpensive not cheap there's a
difference<00:02:46.420> a<00:02:46.540> cheap<00:02:46.750> knife<00:02:46.959> isn't<00:02:47.440> going<00:02:47.560> to

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
difference a cheap knife isn't going to

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.830 
difference a cheap knife isn't going to
be<00:02:47.680> put<00:02:47.889> together<00:02:47.980> very<00:02:48.430> well<00:02:48.519> an<00:02:48.940> inexpensive

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
be put together very well an inexpensive

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.539 
be put together very well an inexpensive
knife<00:02:50.200> is<00:02:50.410> one<00:02:50.440> that's<00:02:50.799> put<00:02:50.980> together<00:02:51.099> well

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:51.549 
knife is one that's put together well

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:53.550 
knife is one that's put together well
and<00:02:51.760> it's<00:02:51.910> a<00:02:52.030> good<00:02:52.150> value<00:02:52.419> well<00:02:53.109> crystal<00:02:53.500> is

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
and it's a good value well crystal is

to go with that
while<00:03:00.410> that<00:03:01.410> didn't<00:03:01.680> take<00:03:01.800> any<00:03:01.980> effort

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
my hand now I'll just push it in and

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:08.690 
my hand now I'll just push it in and
open<00:03:08.310> that<00:03:08.460> up

like<00:03:09.420> make<00:03:09.750> sure<00:03:09.960> these<00:03:10.080> holes<00:03:10.380> are<00:03:10.590> wide

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
like make sure these holes are wide

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.860 
like make sure these holes are wide
enough<00:03:10.980> that<00:03:11.160> it<00:03:11.430> can<00:03:11.550> breathe<00:03:14.870> punctures

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
enough that it can breathe punctures

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.500 
enough that it can breathe punctures
right<00:03:16.110> through<00:03:17.660> very<00:03:18.660> well<00:03:18.870> so<00:03:19.230> let's<00:03:19.440> get

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
right through very well so let's get

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.150 
right through very well so let's get
let's<00:03:21.510> get<00:03:21.660> a<00:03:21.720> heat<00:03:21.930> tab<00:03:22.200> going
