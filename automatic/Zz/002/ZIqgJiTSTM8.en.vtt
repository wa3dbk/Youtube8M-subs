00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.080
 In this video tutorial we will learn how to prepare four red lights 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.759
 native president 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.030
 this failure can be seen many problems but in this case 

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:18.220
 overheating 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.159
 and it's the one we're going to do 

00:00:20.159 --> 00:00:23.470
 as you see nothing else turn on the consoles 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:24.950
 we see that it does not jump 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:27.950
 the notice of the three red lights 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:32.929
 due to overheating the console 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.070
 now we see the video tutorial of how to disassemble that about 3 60 and we arrived 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.070
 until the step where we create ourselves only with the motherboard 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.960
 we already have the silver to the sra what we have to fix is ​​in these two chips 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.560
 and through a stick we will clean everything that is silicone 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.560
 who found lodeiro ch 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.740
 As you can see, all this area of ​​the cicpc has a silicone which has been scattered 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:02.620
 medium heat sink and heat 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.670
 report of a stick we have to go around every way it seems totally 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.150
 clean 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.720
 simply if floating 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.970
 and removing it little by little once we have all this area of ​​the metro mic 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:15.620
 clean 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.030
 we proceed to clean 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.020
 the other micro 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.200
 the program that are still solvable and is due to some problems with the 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.600
 first consoles in the 3 60 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.560
 this by means of a heat adhesive that opels out here and have dissipated 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.420
 caused overheating of the console 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.410
 to approve we solve it by applying heat 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:39.290
 to all the subway so that the welds that knew of soldier 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.620
 Re-weld correctly 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.990
 but the repair process useful stretches in this case a charge gun 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.880
 there are other methods such as the paint stripper gun 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.200
 percent do not produce anything stable welding 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.600
 and they can burn the silver 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.479
 this process is quite delicate with who you are and we are not 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.080
 professionals we have no experience 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.090
 with the plates better than barcelona tied herbert palace so that what 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.580
 repair for us 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.639
 The first thing we will do will be 

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:12.639
 put the silver on a metal sheet 

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:19.229
 why is it for food mónaca that we apply carlos we do not have the 

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:20.789
 descent mission 

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:23.799
 remember that it has is detailed that seven plastic 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:26.799
 can cause all the plastic to melt on our body 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:30.909
 now we understand the rubber gun 

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:33.909
 at maximum air temperature 

00:02:35.139 --> 00:02:38.429
 we will start to apply little by little circularly 

00:02:38.429 --> 00:02:40.469
 movements on the myth 

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:43.769
 remember that it has to be headlines and non-stop 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:47.029
 the time to stop can cause you to fear the silver 

00:02:47.029 --> 00:02:50.159
 we will apply heat for five minutes on the two micros 

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:54.059
 always moment 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:15.569
 As you can see, the movement has to be totally 

00:03:18.179 --> 00:03:21.179
 with an average speed 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:26.449
 and little by little we will get the micros to be released correctly 

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:31.459
 We have already applied heat for two minutes for five minutes 

00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:35.169
 and now we want to leave the entity for about 15 minutes 

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:39.589
 Attention the square we will apply three drops 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:41.929
 the micros 

00:03:41.929 --> 00:03:44.069
 of thermal paste 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:47.069
 we will extend it 

00:03:49.649 --> 00:03:52.809
 now we simply cosmos data place the heatsinks 

00:03:56.979 --> 00:04:00.579
 hillá see the video tutorial of how to mount the whole plate 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:02.729
 and we can already be 

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:06.219
 using this console without heat problems for quite some time 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:10.339
 'a rare thing' console we found that the light is 

00:04:10.339 --> 00:04:13.339
 green feeling 

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:18.559
 As you can see, the operation is correct in moments of the red lights 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:21.959
 now simply 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:23.960
 we can put welbeck goals 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.599
 anyway in programs of 

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:27.139
 presentation 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:31.120
 I recommend that in Pongo is a fan to the consolidation 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.960
 I can probably go through the same mistake again 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.360
 since these consoles have their representation at 0 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.659
 Ministry of culture have surprised 

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:40.979
 as the expert related
