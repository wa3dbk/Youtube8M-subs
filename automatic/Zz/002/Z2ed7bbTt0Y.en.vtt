triplets<00:00:12.179> that<00:00:12.450> involves<00:00:13.139> the<00:00:13.230> snare<00:00:13.590> and

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
triplets that involves the snare and

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.160 
triplets that involves the snare and
moves<00:00:14.370> right<00:00:14.490> around<00:00:14.880> the<00:00:15.059> Tom's<00:00:15.330> it<00:00:15.990> moves

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
moves right around the Tom's it moves

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.810 
moves right around the Tom's it moves
along<00:00:16.350> fairly<00:00:16.619> quickly<00:00:16.949> and<00:00:17.279> it<00:00:17.400> works<00:00:17.609> really

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
along fairly quickly and it works really

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.510 
along fairly quickly and it works really
well<00:00:18.119> at<00:00:18.330> slow<00:00:18.750> or<00:00:19.080> medium<00:00:19.650> slow<00:00:20.310> medium

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
well at slow or medium slow medium

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.340 
well at slow or medium slow medium
tempos<00:00:21.090> this<00:00:21.510> is<00:00:21.630> the<00:00:21.720> pattern<00:00:21.960> I'll<00:00:22.140> play<00:00:22.289> it

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
tempos this is the pattern I'll play it

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:41.600 
tempos this is the pattern I'll play it
for<00:00:22.529> you<00:00:22.590> and<00:00:22.859> then<00:00:22.949> I'll<00:00:23.070> break<00:00:23.220> it<00:00:23.340> down<00:00:40.610> so

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
for you and then I'll break it down so

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:42.979 
for you and then I'll break it down so
you<00:00:41.640> can<00:00:41.850> see<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.120> actual<00:00:42.390> pattern<00:00:42.780> moves

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
you can see the actual pattern moves

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.270 
you can see the actual pattern moves
pretty<00:00:43.170> quickly<00:00:43.500> okay<00:00:43.920> you're<00:00:44.100> playing

thirty second note triplets or
sextuplets<00:00:46.260> which<00:00:46.500> six<00:00:47.280> per<00:00:47.460> beat<00:00:48.379> but<00:00:49.379> I'm

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
sextuplets which six per beat but I'm

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.350 
sextuplets which six per beat but I'm
not<00:00:49.680> actually<00:00:49.800> playing<00:00:50.190> at<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.370> fast<00:00:50.670> tempo<00:00:51.059> you

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
not actually playing at a fast tempo you

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.850 
not actually playing at a fast tempo you
know<00:00:51.449> this<00:00:51.600> sort<00:00:51.750> of<00:00:51.840> tempo<00:00:52.110> here<00:00:54.680> okay<00:00:55.680> it's

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
know this sort of tempo here okay it's

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.049 
know this sort of tempo here okay it's
definitely<00:00:56.039> not<00:00:56.370> you<00:00:56.489> know<00:00:56.520> an<00:00:56.699> up-tempo

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
definitely not you know an up-tempo

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.840 
definitely not you know an up-tempo
thing<00:00:57.449> or<00:00:57.899> anything<00:00:58.079> like<00:00:58.320> that<00:00:58.350> so<00:00:58.850> the

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
thing or anything like that so the

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.939 
thing or anything like that so the
actual<00:01:00.210> pattern<00:01:00.600> starts<00:01:01.230> with<00:01:01.680> an<00:01:01.800> upbeat

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
actual pattern starts with an upbeat

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.549 
actual pattern starts with an upbeat
like<00:01:02.940> preceding<00:01:03.539> beat<00:01:03.690> one<00:01:03.930> or<00:01:04.080> preceding

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
like preceding beat one or preceding

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:05.990 
like preceding beat one or preceding
beat<00:01:04.739> three<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:05.280> that<00:01:05.430> is<00:01:05.460> played<00:01:05.760> with<00:01:05.909> the

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
beat three and that is played with the

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.130 
beat three and that is played with the
left<00:01:06.150> hand<00:01:06.390> that's<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.720> first<00:01:06.930> thing<00:01:07.080> that

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
left hand that's the first thing that

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:15.000 
left hand that's the first thing that
you<00:01:07.320> hear<00:01:07.530> when<00:01:07.560> you<00:01:07.799> play<00:01:07.979> one<00:01:08.520> two<00:01:08.970> three

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.010 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.370 

okay<00:01:15.760> so<00:01:15.820> that's<00:01:16.120> the<00:01:16.300> triplet<00:01:16.690> before<00:01:17.140> beat

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
okay so that's the triplet before beat

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.190 
okay so that's the triplet before beat
one<00:01:17.940> let's<00:01:18.940> just<00:01:19.030> put<00:01:19.330> that<00:01:19.360> aside<00:01:19.600> and<00:01:19.840> learn

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
one let's just put that aside and learn

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.200 
one let's just put that aside and learn
the<00:01:20.740> actual<00:01:21.070> pattern<00:01:21.400> played<00:01:21.610> on<00:01:21.850> the<00:01:21.940> snare

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
the actual pattern played on the snare

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:23.790 
the actual pattern played on the snare
drum<00:01:22.360> and<00:01:22.450> around<00:01:22.720> the<00:01:22.810> times<00:01:23.080> the<00:01:23.380> sticking

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:23.800 
drum and around the times the sticking

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.960 
drum and around the times the sticking
pattern<00:01:24.100> is<00:01:24.430> just<00:01:24.970> right<00:01:25.450> left<00:01:26.290> left<00:01:27.070> for<00:01:27.880> the

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
pattern is just right left left for the

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.460 
pattern is just right left left for the
start<00:01:28.270> and<00:01:28.450> then<00:01:28.990> you<00:01:29.140> play<00:01:29.380> right<00:01:30.190> left<00:01:30.970> right

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
start and then you play right left right

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.160 
start and then you play right left right
bass<00:01:32.470> drum<00:01:32.800> okay<00:01:33.370> so<00:01:33.430> both<00:01:34.210> of<00:01:34.270> those<00:01:34.540> units<00:01:34.870> if

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
bass drum okay so both of those units if

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:36.690 
bass drum okay so both of those units if
you<00:01:35.260> just<00:01:35.410> split<00:01:35.680> it<00:01:35.800> in<00:01:35.890> half<00:01:35.920> they're<00:01:36.430> really

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
you just split it in half they're really

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.520 
you just split it in half they're really
common<00:01:37.030> patterns<00:01:37.330> we<00:01:37.450> always<00:01:37.780> use<00:01:38.020> right<00:01:38.260> left

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
common patterns we always use right left

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:44.580 
common patterns we always use right left
left<00:01:42.420> yeah<00:01:43.420> we<00:01:43.540> use<00:01:43.690> that<00:01:43.840> one<00:01:43.960> a<00:01:43.990> lot<00:01:44.230> and<00:01:44.260> this

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
left yeah we use that one a lot and this

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.730 
left yeah we use that one a lot and this
lick<00:01:44.800> here<00:01:45.010> just<00:01:45.280> going<00:01:46.170> we<00:01:47.170> use<00:01:47.350> that<00:01:47.500> a<00:01:47.560> lot

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
lick here just going we use that a lot

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.250 
lick here just going we use that a lot
too<00:01:48.030> whether<00:01:49.030> it's<00:01:49.240> being<00:01:49.540> played<00:01:49.690> just<00:01:50.110> like

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:50.260 
too whether it's being played just like

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.690 
too whether it's being played just like
that<00:01:52.290> or<00:01:53.290> as<00:01:53.740> part<00:01:54.070> of<00:01:54.160> maybe<00:01:54.370> you<00:01:54.520> know<00:01:54.610> the

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
that or as part of maybe you know the

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.310 
that or as part of maybe you know the
random<00:01:54.970> EQ<00:01:55.180> lick<00:01:57.450> things<00:01:58.450> like<00:01:58.690> that<00:01:58.870> so

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
random EQ lick things like that so

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.650 
random EQ lick things like that so
they're<00:01:59.650> both<00:01:59.830> really<00:02:00.520> common<00:02:00.820> patterns<00:02:01.120> so

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:01.660 
they're both really common patterns so

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.300 
they're both really common patterns so
once<00:02:02.020> again<00:02:02.170> the<00:02:02.350> pattern<00:02:02.530> is<00:02:02.710> just<00:02:02.950> right

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
once again the pattern is just right

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.900 
once again the pattern is just right
left<00:02:04.030> left<00:02:04.630> right<00:02:05.080> first<00:02:06.010> time<00:02:06.190> floor<00:02:06.700> tom

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:06.910 
left left right first time floor tom

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.350 
left left right first time floor tom
bass<00:02:07.360> drum<00:02:07.630> okay<00:02:08.290> so<00:02:08.530> that<00:02:09.010> first<00:02:09.790> right<00:02:10.119> is

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
bass drum okay so that first right is

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.020 
bass drum okay so that first right is
beat<00:02:10.720> one<00:02:10.750> and<00:02:11.170> the<00:02:12.040> bass<00:02:12.220> drum<00:02:12.459> is<00:02:12.580> beat<00:02:12.820> two

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
beat one and the bass drum is beat two

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.699 
beat one and the bass drum is beat two
so<00:02:13.300> the<00:02:13.420> six<00:02:13.690> notes<00:02:13.930> in<00:02:14.110> between<00:02:14.140> they're

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
so the six notes in between they're

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.800 
so the six notes in between they're
evenly<00:02:15.070> spaced<00:02:15.490> evenly<00:02:15.730> spaced<00:02:16.300> and<00:02:16.570> they<00:02:16.690> are

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
evenly spaced evenly spaced and they are

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.350 
evenly spaced evenly spaced and they are
thirty-second<00:02:17.350> note<00:02:17.470> triplets<00:02:17.860> one<00:02:18.760> two

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
thirty-second note triplets one two

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:34.910 
thirty-second note triplets one two
three<00:02:20.020> four<00:02:20.560> okay<00:02:25.440> and<00:02:26.440> a<00:02:26.470> little<00:02:26.709> faster<00:02:33.330> and

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
three four okay and a little faster and

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.229 
three four okay and a little faster and
of<00:02:35.920> course<00:02:36.160> I'm<00:02:36.340> playing<00:02:36.489> the<00:02:36.670> triplet<00:02:37.060> with

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
of course I'm playing the triplet with

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:39.720 
of course I'm playing the triplet with
the<00:02:37.330> left<00:02:37.570> hand<00:02:37.750> as<00:02:37.989> an<00:02:38.260> accent<00:02:38.680> before<00:02:39.190> beat

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
the left hand as an accent before beat

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.070 
the left hand as an accent before beat
one<00:02:39.940> or<00:02:40.180> before<00:02:40.480> beat<00:02:40.660> three<00:02:40.870> it's<00:02:41.019> the

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
one or before beat three it's the

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.770 
one or before beat three it's the
triplet<00:02:41.680> before<00:02:42.040> beat<00:02:42.220> one<00:02:42.400> or<00:02:42.640> three<00:02:42.880> one<00:02:43.750> and

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
triplet before beat one or three one and

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.890 
triplet before beat one or three one and
A<00:02:44.260> two<00:02:44.290> and<00:02:44.560> A<00:02:45.040> three<00:02:45.070> and<00:02:45.370> a<00:02:45.820> four<00:02:45.850> and<00:02:46.269> up<00:02:46.570> one

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
A two and A three and a four and up one

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.460 
A two and A three and a four and up one
okay<00:02:48.510> okay<00:02:49.510> so<00:02:49.570> just<00:02:49.900> throw<00:02:50.050> that<00:02:50.170> in<00:02:50.230> as<00:02:50.440> well

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
okay okay so just throw that in as well

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:56.720 
okay okay so just throw that in as well
one<00:02:50.950> two<00:02:51.489> three<00:02:52.120> four

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.479 

a<00:02:57.170> nice<00:02:58.170> little<00:02:58.379> variation<00:02:58.950> on<00:02:59.010> this<00:02:59.159> pattern

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
a nice little variation on this pattern

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.250 
a nice little variation on this pattern
is<00:02:59.640> to<00:02:59.790> add<00:02:59.909> one<00:02:59.940> more<00:03:00.269> note<00:03:00.659> on<00:03:00.780> the<00:03:01.019> snare

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
is to add one more note on the snare

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.470 
is to add one more note on the snare
drum<00:03:01.319> we<00:03:02.010> change<00:03:02.340> the<00:03:02.519> sticking<00:03:02.909> from<00:03:03.090> right

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
drum we change the sticking from right

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.390 
drum we change the sticking from right
left<00:03:03.810> left<00:03:04.049> going<00:03:05.569> and<00:03:07.010> then<00:03:08.010> the<00:03:08.099> pattern<00:03:08.340> at

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
left left going and then the pattern at

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.979 
left left going and then the pattern at
the<00:03:08.459> end<00:03:08.640> instead<00:03:09.060> of<00:03:09.269> playing<00:03:09.510> right<00:03:09.720> left

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
the end instead of playing right left

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.559 
the end instead of playing right left
left<00:03:10.140> at<00:03:10.349> the<00:03:10.409> start<00:03:11.180> we're<00:03:12.180> just<00:03:12.390> going<00:03:12.540> to

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
left at the start we're just going to

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:15.110 
left at the start we're just going to
play<00:03:12.780> right<00:03:13.260> right<00:03:13.680> left<00:03:14.069> left<00:03:14.310> so<00:03:14.760> double

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
play right right left left so double

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.820 
play right right left left so double
strokes<00:03:15.390> and<00:03:16.970> then<00:03:17.970> the<00:03:18.150> pattern<00:03:18.480> so<00:03:19.019> right

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
strokes and then the pattern so right

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.900 
strokes and then the pattern so right
right<00:03:20.340> left<00:03:20.819> left<00:03:21.239> right<00:03:21.480> left<00:03:22.080> right<00:03:22.910> okay

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
right left left right left right okay

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.130 
right left left right left right okay
that's<00:03:24.180> the<00:03:24.329> pattern<00:03:24.950> and<00:03:26.750> we<00:03:27.750> do<00:03:27.900> play<00:03:28.110> the

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
that's the pattern and we do play the

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.619 
that's the pattern and we do play the
accent<00:03:28.620> at<00:03:28.769> the<00:03:28.799> start<00:03:29.160> but<00:03:29.340> we'll<00:03:29.489> throw<00:03:30.450> that

00:03:30.619 --> 00:03:30.629 
accent at the start but we'll throw that

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:34.100 
accent at the start but we'll throw that
in<00:03:30.750> at<00:03:30.870> the<00:03:30.900> end<00:03:31.110> so<00:03:31.829> they're<00:03:32.129> the<00:03:32.250> 7<00:03:32.579> notes<00:03:32.790> 1<00:03:33.569> 2

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
in at the end so they're the 7 notes 1 2

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:39.110 
in at the end so they're the 7 notes 1 2
3<00:03:34.650> 4<00:03:35.250> 5<00:03:35.760> 6<00:03:36.299> 7<00:03:36.989> and<00:03:37.250> then<00:03:38.250> we<00:03:38.370> won't<00:03:38.489> land<00:03:38.760> on<00:03:38.940> beat

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
3 4 5 6 7 and then we won't land on beat

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.809 
3 4 5 6 7 and then we won't land on beat
2<00:03:39.299> or<00:03:39.569> 4<00:03:41.540> ok<00:03:42.569> when<00:03:43.079> you<00:03:43.200> put<00:03:43.410> that<00:03:43.500> in<00:03:43.680> time<00:03:43.980> it's

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 
2 or 4 ok when you put that in time it's

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:47.180 
2 or 4 ok when you put that in time it's
nice<00:03:45.150> to<00:03:45.480> play<00:03:45.660> it<00:03:45.840> just<00:03:46.019> a<00:03:46.500> little<00:03:46.709> bit<00:03:46.859> slower

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
nice to play it just a little bit slower

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.170 
nice to play it just a little bit slower
than<00:03:47.400> the<00:03:47.459> other<00:03:47.640> lick<00:03:47.849> you<00:03:47.940> know<00:03:48.030> if<00:03:48.090> you're

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
than the other lick you know if you're

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.150 
than the other lick you know if you're
playing<00:03:48.420> at<00:03:48.569> a<00:03:48.599> slow<00:03:49.049> tempo<00:03:49.079> rather<00:03:49.829> than<00:03:50.010> kind

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
playing at a slow tempo rather than kind

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.119 
playing at a slow tempo rather than kind
of<00:03:50.220> a<00:03:50.310> slow<00:03:50.700> medium<00:03:50.970> tempo<00:03:51.959> this<00:03:52.470> one<00:03:52.739> because

00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:53.129 
of a slow medium tempo this one because

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:55.400 
of a slow medium tempo this one because
it's<00:03:53.250> got<00:03:53.310> one<00:03:53.730> more<00:03:53.970> note<00:03:54.239> ok<00:03:54.720> seven<00:03:55.140> instead

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
it's got one more note ok seven instead

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.470 
it's got one more note ok seven instead
of<00:03:55.500> six<00:03:55.769> it<00:03:56.519> gives<00:03:56.730> you<00:03:56.819> that<00:03:56.940> nice<00:03:57.120> roll

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
of six it gives you that nice roll

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.660 
of six it gives you that nice roll
effect<00:03:57.870> at<00:03:58.049> slightly<00:03:58.620> slower<00:03:58.980> tempos<00:03:59.340> as<00:03:59.489> well

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
effect at slightly slower tempos as well

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:20.880 
effect at slightly slower tempos as well
so<00:04:00.239> you<00:04:00.299> might<00:04:00.540> use<00:04:00.569> this<00:04:00.870> one<00:04:01.079> like

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:20.890 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:23.230 

so<00:04:21.890> once<00:04:22.130> again<00:04:22.280> we<00:04:22.550> have<00:04:22.700> to<00:04:22.790> add<00:04:22.940> in<00:04:23.120> that

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
so once again we have to add in that

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.170 
so once again we have to add in that
triplet<00:04:23.570> the<00:04:23.960> upbeat<00:04:24.470> okay<00:04:25.100> before<00:04:25.310> beat<00:04:25.790> 1<00:04:26.000> or

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
triplet the upbeat okay before beat 1 or

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.440 
triplet the upbeat okay before beat 1 or
3

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.450 
3

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:31.810 
3
so<00:04:26.990> that<00:04:27.140> becomes<00:04:27.410> 1<00:04:27.800> &amp;<00:04:28.100> 2<00:04:28.610> &amp;<00:04:28.910> 3<00:04:28.970> &amp;<00:04:29.570> 4<00:04:29.810> &amp;<00:04:30.620> and<00:04:31.220> then

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820 
so that becomes 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp; and then

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:37.840 
so that becomes 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp; and then
straight<00:04:32.150> into<00:04:32.300> the<00:04:32.480> double<00:04:34.840> so<00:04:36.730> just<00:04:37.730> even

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:37.850 
straight into the double so just even

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:39.130 
straight into the double so just even
get<00:04:38.090> used<00:04:38.240> to<00:04:38.360> that<00:04:38.450> to<00:04:38.600> start<00:04:38.840> with<00:04:38.960> just

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:39.140 
get used to that to start with just

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:41.290 
get used to that to start with just
playing<00:04:39.320> it<00:04:39.470> in<00:04:39.620> free<00:04:39.980> time<00:04:40.190> just<00:04:40.520> going<00:04:40.760> right

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
playing it in free time just going right

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.600 
playing it in free time just going right
right<00:04:41.510> left<00:04:41.960> left<00:04:42.260> right<00:04:42.410> left<00:04:42.650> right<00:04:43.160> bass

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610 
right left left right left right bass

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.070 
right left left right left right bass
drum<00:04:43.850> okay<00:04:44.240> because<00:04:44.419> that's<00:04:44.630> the<00:04:44.810> pattern

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080 
drum okay because that's the pattern

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:51.159 
drum okay because that's the pattern
that's<00:04:45.140> the<00:04:45.320> tricky<00:04:45.590> part<00:04:49.690> it's<00:04:50.690> almost<00:04:50.930> like

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:51.169 
that's the tricky part it's almost like

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:52.780 
that's the tricky part it's almost like
you're<00:04:51.320> playing<00:04:51.350> a<00:04:51.800> five<00:04:52.160> stroke<00:04:52.430> roll<00:04:52.460> at<00:04:52.760> the

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:52.790 
you're playing a five stroke roll at the

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:54.580 
you're playing a five stroke roll at the
start<00:04:53.060> because<00:04:53.210> you're<00:04:53.510> playing<00:04:53.750> right<00:04:54.140> right

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:54.590 
start because you're playing right right

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:56.950 
start because you're playing right right
left<00:04:54.980> left<00:04:55.250> right<00:04:55.820> and<00:04:56.150> then<00:04:56.720> you're<00:04:56.840> moving

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 
left left right and then you're moving

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.720 
left left right and then you're moving
into<00:04:57.230> the<00:04:57.320> Tom's<00:04:57.650> so<00:04:58.190> it's<00:04:58.310> like<00:04:58.430> you're<00:04:58.550> going

00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:58.730 
into the Tom's so it's like you're going
