difficult<00:03:19.819> to<00:03:20.150> actually<00:03:20.329> record<00:03:20.689> when

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
difficult to actually record when

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.160 
difficult to actually record when
there's<00:03:22.269> something<00:03:23.269> loud<00:03:23.450> like<00:03:23.480> he's<00:03:23.900> playing

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
the background that's really the test

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:42.030 
the background that's really the test
Islands<00:03:26.209> these<00:03:27.140> are<00:03:27.409> just<00:03:27.680> so<00:03:27.829> frustrating

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.850 

so<00:03:44.049> okay<00:03:45.049> that<00:03:45.260> ought<00:03:45.290> to<00:03:45.379> work<00:03:45.500> actually

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:45.860 
so okay that ought to work actually

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:50.199 
so okay that ought to work actually
we're<00:03:46.610> better<00:03:47.470> the<00:03:48.700> with<00:03:49.700> the<00:03:49.849> lab<00:03:50.030> for

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
we're better the with the lab for

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:53.199 
we're better the with the lab for
testing<00:03:50.980> couple<00:03:51.980> people<00:03:52.310> on<00:03:52.430> vimeo<00:03:52.849> and<00:03:52.909> I

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209 
testing couple people on vimeo and I

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:58.420 
testing couple people on vimeo and I
know<00:03:53.269> everything<00:03:54.640> depends<00:03:55.640> on<00:03:57.099> my<00:03:58.099> first

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
know everything depends on my first

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.839 
know everything depends on my first
attempt<00:03:58.970> at<00:03:59.060> this<00:03:59.269> I<00:03:59.480> somehow<00:03:59.780> the<00:03:59.989> head<00:04:00.409> and

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:00.849 
attempt at this I somehow the head and

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:03.399 
attempt at this I somehow the head and
didn't<00:04:01.849> have<00:04:01.940> the<00:04:02.060> right<00:04:02.180> kind<00:04:02.360> of<00:04:02.450> Jack<00:04:02.870> going

00:04:03.399 --> 00:04:03.409 
didn't have the right kind of Jack going

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:07.259 
didn't have the right kind of Jack going
from<00:04:03.860> the<00:04:04.640> receiver<00:04:05.180> unit<00:04:05.709> into<00:04:06.709> the<00:04:06.950> camera

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:07.269 
from the receiver unit into the camera

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:13.030 
from the receiver unit into the camera
and<00:04:08.269> eject<00:04:09.019> I<00:04:09.200> used<00:04:09.500> one<00:04:10.250> via<00:04:10.819> stereo<00:04:11.329> RCA<00:04:12.040> male

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
and eject I used one via stereo RCA male

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:18.250 
and eject I used one via stereo RCA male
to<00:04:13.280> male<00:04:15.070> bunch<00:04:16.070> of<00:04:16.190> playing<00:04:16.430> boys<00:04:16.959> since<00:04:17.959> then

to male bunch of playing boys since then
I've<00:04:18.440> wired<00:04:18.680> it<00:04:18.979> in<00:04:19.220> and<00:04:19.549> I<00:04:19.940> think<00:04:20.120> they'll<00:04:20.239> get

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:20.329 
I've wired it in and I think they'll get

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:22.420 
I've wired it in and I think they'll get
a<00:04:20.389> better<00:04:20.570> idea<00:04:20.720> you<00:04:21.530> know<00:04:21.650> having<00:04:22.010> a<00:04:22.070> mic<00:04:22.250> like

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
a better idea you know having a mic like

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.450 
a better idea you know having a mic like
this<00:04:22.610> is<00:04:22.789> a<00:04:22.840> useful<00:04:23.840> for<00:04:24.229> totally<00:04:24.530> capturing

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
this is a useful for totally capturing

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.310 
this is a useful for totally capturing
everything<00:04:25.669> event<00:04:26.060> personal<00:04:26.600> space<00:04:26.930> and<00:04:27.199> I

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
everything event personal space and I

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.320 
everything event personal space and I
said<00:04:27.680> sometimes<00:04:28.340> it's<00:04:28.669> think<00:04:28.850> it's<00:04:29.060> really

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
said sometimes it's think it's really

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.390 
said sometimes it's think it's really
the<00:04:29.449> best<00:04:29.630> way<00:04:29.780> is<00:04:30.020> to<00:04:30.199> do<00:04:30.440> all<00:04:30.620> that<00:04:30.650> stuff<00:04:30.889> but

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
the best way is to do all that stuff but

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.659
