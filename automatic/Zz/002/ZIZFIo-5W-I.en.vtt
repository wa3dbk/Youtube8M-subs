00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:11.190
 the third generation is modern and dynamic 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.650
 of the skoda fabia you have not had 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.719
 completely new there is no denying the 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.369
 build quality level is high e 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.590
 this holds true for all models 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.840
 volkswagen is known to go under the 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.580
 brand of the parent company whether they appear 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.580
 in the skoda price list or if at 

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:32.670
 while maintaining the same physiognomy of the 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:34.980
 past its lines are now more decisive 

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:37.500
 and gritty with less than 4 meters of 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.610
 length is an ideal compact car for 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.410
 the city 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.210
 the interior has become more spacious e 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.840
 boasts the best trunk of the 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.030
 category 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.190
 sure some plastics turn out a little 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.739
 hard but all in all the whole is not 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.750
 the steps are also bad on a technological level 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.910
 ahead are as tangible as the system of 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.460
 connectivity that allows you to carry 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.920
 on the screen smartphone apps e 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.960
 the intuitive navigator in short, goodbye 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.379
 old concept of low cost 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.379
 but you know 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:09.720
 proposed in three versions the new fabia 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.840
 can accommodate 3 engines under the hood a 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.840
 petrol the 1000 3 cylinders of 60 and 75 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.810
 horses and the 1200 from ninety and one 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.120
 the 1400 diesel engine with 90 horsepower 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.030
 which later will be joined by a 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:26.160
 75 horsepower greenline version in 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.720
 able to consume just over 3 liters 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.720
 every 100 km 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:41.110
 on the Italian market fabia will come to 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:43.120
 January positioning itself probably a 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.670
 step under the cousin volkswagen polo 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:48.940
 and in the spring it will come to the variant 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.950
 wagon 4 meters long and 27 with a 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.960
 trunk that promises to be large 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.479
 extra topic to take in 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.090
 consider a skoda brand that 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:00.810
 despite everything in Italy it is still a 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.810
 little snubbed
