00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
look we're going to start with just the

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.990 
look we're going to start with just the
chord<00:01:06.320> progression<00:01:06.770> most<00:01:07.640> the<00:01:07.729> chords<00:01:07.909> are

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
chord progression most the chords are

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.039 
chord progression most the chords are
pretty<00:01:08.150> easy<00:01:08.299> to<00:01:08.390> play<00:01:08.630> we're<00:01:08.810> going<00:01:08.930> to<00:01:08.990> need

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:09.049 
pretty easy to play we're going to need

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:10.210 
pretty easy to play we're going to need
a<00:01:09.110> couple<00:01:09.320> of<00:01:09.439> bar<00:01:09.590> chords<00:01:09.920> we're<00:01:10.040> going<00:01:10.159> to

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
a couple of bar chords we're going to

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.010 
a couple of bar chords we're going to
see<00:01:10.549> probably<00:01:11.299> play<00:01:11.540> it<00:01:11.659> up<00:01:11.750> at<00:01:11.840> the<00:01:11.930> eighth

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
see probably play it up at the eighth

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.289 
see probably play it up at the eighth
fret<00:01:12.290> but<00:01:12.920> the<00:01:13.189> holy<00:01:13.369> would<00:01:13.729> be<00:01:13.850> played<00:01:14.060> really

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:14.299 
fret but the holy would be played really

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:16.929 
fret but the holy would be played really
without<00:01:14.509> without<00:01:15.350> any<00:01:15.409> bars<00:01:15.830> we<00:01:16.520> do<00:01:16.640> need<00:01:16.820> the

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:16.939 
without without any bars we do need the

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:18.910 
without without any bars we do need the
double-time<00:01:17.390> strumming<00:01:17.869> for<00:01:18.110> that<00:01:18.229> intro<00:01:18.650> the

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
double-time strumming for that intro the

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.910 
double-time strumming for that intro the
the<00:01:19.549> the<00:01:19.820> pinball<00:01:20.210> wizard<00:01:20.600> borrowed<00:01:21.590> borrowed

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
the the pinball wizard borrowed borrowed

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.420 
the the pinball wizard borrowed borrowed
thing<00:01:22.280> from<00:01:22.490> pinball<00:01:22.880> wizard<00:01:23.180> and<00:01:24.430> probably

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
thing from pinball wizard and probably

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:35.280 
thing from pinball wizard and probably
take<00:01:25.549> a<00:01:25.579> look<00:01:25.820> at<00:01:25.939> it

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:35.290 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.580 

I<00:01:36.450> know<00:01:37.450> I<00:01:37.570> might<00:01:37.750> might<00:01:37.960> delve<00:01:38.170> into<00:01:38.320> the<00:01:38.440> lead

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
I know I might might delve into the lead

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.230 
I know I might might delve into the lead
a<00:01:38.620> little<00:01:38.770> bit<00:01:38.980> too<00:01:39.100> because<00:01:39.430> it's<00:01:39.610> uh<00:01:39.700> it's

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
a little bit too because it's uh it's

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.970 
a little bit too because it's uh it's
it's<00:01:40.660> very<00:01:40.780> short<00:01:41.200> and<00:01:41.320> there's<00:01:41.440> those<00:01:41.590> kind

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:41.980 
it's very short and there's those kind

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.940 
it's very short and there's those kind
of<00:01:42.040> a<00:01:42.100> cool<00:01:42.280> thing<00:01:42.460> happening<00:01:43.330> in<00:01:43.420> there<00:01:43.630> and<00:01:43.950> I

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
of a cool thing happening in there and I

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:46.950 
of a cool thing happening in there and I
think<00:01:45.460> that's<00:01:45.730> about<00:01:45.880> it<00:01:46.030> in<00:01:46.660> the<00:01:46.750> next

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
think that's about it in the next

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
think that's about it in the next
segment<00:01:47.260> we'll<00:01:47.320> talk<00:01:47.380> about<00:01:47.530> we'll<00:01:47.950> talk

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:47.980 
segment we'll talk about we'll talk

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:49.980 
segment we'll talk about we'll talk
about<00:01:48.160> the<00:01:48.310> chords<00:01:48.640> and<00:01:48.910> it's<00:01:49.390> a<00:01:49.480> very<00:01:49.720> simple

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
about the chords and it's a very simple

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.090 
about the chords and it's a very simple
progression<00:01:50.230> basically<00:01:51.160> we've<00:01:51.700> got<00:01:51.730> a<00:01:53.100> Dorian

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
progression basically we've got a Dorian

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.200 
progression basically we've got a Dorian
progression<00:01:54.910> a<00:01:55.090> minor<00:01:55.390> to<00:01:56.200> a<00:01:56.400> with<00:01:57.400> a<00:01:57.430> change

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
progression a minor to a with a change

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.390 
progression a minor to a with a change
that's<00:01:58.900> usually<00:01:59.230> happening<00:01:59.590> on<00:01:59.710> the<00:01:59.860> on<00:02:00.010> the

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.400 
that's usually happening on the on the

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:10.380 
that's usually happening on the on the
up<00:02:08.160> of<00:02:09.160> course<00:02:09.399> we<00:02:09.490> have<00:02:09.610> the<00:02:09.700> same<00:02:09.880> thing<00:02:10.149> a

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
up of course we have the same thing a

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.740 
up of course we have the same thing a
cool<00:02:10.600> little<00:02:10.690> run

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.510 

on<00:02:15.020> the<00:02:15.230> same<00:02:15.410> progression<00:02:15.590> of<00:02:16.070> forth<00:02:16.310> higher

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
on the same progression of forth higher

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.630 
on the same progression of forth higher
so<00:02:16.850> anyway<00:02:17.540> coming<00:02:17.990> up<00:02:18.080> the<00:02:18.320> cords<00:02:18.650> then<00:02:19.310> a<00:02:19.490> lot

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
so anyway coming up the cords then a lot

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:20.740 
so anyway coming up the cords then a lot
of<00:02:19.730> talk<00:02:19.850> about<00:02:19.940> the<00:02:20.090> strumming<00:02:20.420> and<00:02:20.570> the

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
of talk about the strumming and the

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.140 
of talk about the strumming and the
rhythm<00:02:20.990> and<00:02:21.340> will<00:02:22.340> kind<00:02:22.610> of<00:02:22.700> work<00:02:22.820> through<00:02:23.060> the

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
rhythm and will kind of work through the

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.550 
rhythm and will kind of work through the
parts<00:02:23.420> to<00:02:24.170> Venus

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.020 

most<00:02:29.560> the<00:02:29.680> chords<00:02:29.950> we<00:02:30.010> need<00:02:30.220> in<00:02:30.400> Venus<00:02:30.790> are

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
most the chords we need in Venus are

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.270 
most the chords we need in Venus are
your<00:02:31.599> basic<00:02:31.989> chords<00:02:32.290> the<00:02:32.620> chord<00:02:32.830> progression

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
your basic chords the chord progression

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.839 
your basic chords the chord progression
is<00:02:33.489> e<00:02:33.790> -<00:02:34.360> two<00:02:34.510> A's<00:02:34.769> for<00:02:35.769> like<00:02:36.519> eight<00:02:36.670> measures

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:36.849 
is e - two A's for like eight measures

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:41.100 
is e - two A's for like eight measures
and<00:02:37.299> then<00:02:38.879> although<00:02:39.879> the<00:02:40.150> last<00:02:40.629> measure<00:02:40.840> stays

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
and then although the last measure stays

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.580

and at the speed of each stroke is an

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.090 
and at the speed of each stroke is an
agent<00:03:48.850> note<00:03:48.940> one<00:03:49.510> and<00:03:49.840> two<00:03:50.170> and<00:03:50.500> three<00:03:50.620> and

so<00:04:17.230> typically<00:04:18.040> when<00:04:18.250> you're<00:04:18.310> playing<00:04:18.549> percuss

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
so typically when you're playing percuss

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.570 
so typically when you're playing percuss
percussion<00:04:19.750> on<00:04:19.870> the<00:04:19.959> guitar<00:04:20.260> you<00:04:20.980> kill<00:04:21.340> beats

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:21.580 
percussion on the guitar you kill beats

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:30.480 
percussion on the guitar you kill beats
two<00:04:21.880> and<00:04:21.910> four

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.740 

almost<00:04:31.490> where<00:04:31.610> snare<00:04:31.880> drums<00:04:32.120> would<00:04:32.300> be<00:04:32.420> in<00:04:32.540> a

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
almost where snare drums would be in a

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:34.750 
almost where snare drums would be in a
lot<00:04:33.080> of<00:04:33.200> rhythm<00:04:33.500> rhythm<00:04:33.950> patterns<00:04:34.670> of

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:34.760 
lot of rhythm rhythm patterns of

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:58.290 
lot of rhythm rhythm patterns of
drummers<00:04:35.030> would<00:04:35.180> use

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.300 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:02.920 

there<00:04:59.300> you<00:04:59.419> have<00:05:00.580> the<00:05:01.580> lead<00:05:01.759> now<00:05:02.629> this<00:05:02.750> is<00:05:02.840> only

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930 
there you have the lead now this is only

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:04.990 
there you have the lead now this is only
an<00:05:03.349> approximation<00:05:03.919> what<00:05:04.580> I<00:05:04.610> could<00:05:04.789> kind<00:05:04.970> of

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
an approximation what I could kind of

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.050 
an approximation what I could kind of
hear<00:05:05.060> and<00:05:05.449> and<00:05:05.810> figure<00:05:06.530> out<00:05:06.590> and<00:05:07.220> and<00:05:07.669> maybe<00:05:07.879> if

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:08.060 
hear and and figure out and and maybe if

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.480 
hear and and figure out and and maybe if
maybe<00:05:08.300> altered<00:05:09.229> a<00:05:09.289> few<00:05:09.440> things<00:05:09.680> but<00:05:10.159> kind<00:05:10.400> of

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:10.490 
maybe altered a few things but kind of

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:12.070 
maybe altered a few things but kind of
got<00:05:10.580> the<00:05:10.759> the<00:05:11.090> main<00:05:11.449> idea<00:05:11.780> of<00:05:11.840> what's

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 
got the the main idea of what's

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.589 
got the the main idea of what's
happening<00:05:12.139> there<00:05:12.940> really<00:05:13.940> important<00:05:14.449> thing

00:05:14.589 --> 00:05:14.599 
happening there really important thing

00:05:14.599 --> 00:05:15.820 
happening there really important thing
about<00:05:14.840> this<00:05:15.050> is<00:05:15.259> that<00:05:15.289> some<00:05:15.530> of<00:05:15.620> these<00:05:15.680> notes

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:15.830 
about this is that some of these notes

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:17.499 
about this is that some of these notes
are<00:05:16.039> very<00:05:16.159> quick<00:05:16.490> in<00:05:16.639> order<00:05:16.789> to<00:05:17.090> make<00:05:17.270> this

00:05:17.499 --> 00:05:17.509 
are very quick in order to make this

00:05:17.509 --> 00:05:19.570 
are very quick in order to make this
work<00:05:18.289> you<00:05:18.319> have<00:05:18.620> to<00:05:18.740> go<00:05:18.830> you<00:05:18.979> have<00:05:19.129> to<00:05:19.159> go<00:05:19.310> back

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:19.580 
work you have to go you have to go back

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.629 
work you have to go you have to go back
into<00:05:20.050> double<00:05:21.050> time<00:05:21.289> picking<00:05:22.250> and<00:05:22.370> if<00:05:22.430> you<00:05:22.490> take

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:22.639 
into double time picking and if you take

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:24.070 
into double time picking and if you take
a<00:05:22.669> look<00:05:22.940> or<00:05:23.120> double<00:05:23.330> time<00:05:23.479> -<00:05:23.569> strumming<00:05:23.780> downs

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.080 
a look or double time - strumming downs

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.260 
a look or double time - strumming downs
and<00:05:24.259> ups<00:05:24.349> if<00:05:24.889> you<00:05:25.039> take<00:05:25.190> a<00:05:25.220> look<00:05:25.490> at<00:05:25.699> the<00:05:25.909> if<00:05:26.180> you

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:26.270 
and ups if you take a look at the if you

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:27.700 
and ups if you take a look at the if you
just<00:05:26.389> look<00:05:26.569> at<00:05:26.659> there<00:05:26.780> at<00:05:26.930> the<00:05:27.020> rhythm<00:05:27.169> we<00:05:27.409> see

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:27.710 
just look at there at the rhythm we see

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:30.040 
just look at there at the rhythm we see
sixteenth<00:05:28.400> notes<00:05:28.759> and<00:05:29.030> that<00:05:29.419> means<00:05:29.630> our<00:05:29.780> hand

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:30.050 
sixteenth notes and that means our hand

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:31.629 
sixteenth notes and that means our hand
for<00:05:30.169> most<00:05:30.560> of<00:05:30.860> it<00:05:31.009> at<00:05:31.159> least<00:05:31.220> for<00:05:31.430> the<00:05:31.490> first

00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:31.639 
for most of it at least for the first

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:34.659 
for most of it at least for the first
three<00:05:32.210> measures<00:05:32.830> needs<00:05:33.830> to<00:05:33.979> be<00:05:34.069> moving<00:05:34.460> at<00:05:34.550> the

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:34.669 
three measures needs to be moving at the

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:36.370 
three measures needs to be moving at the
speed<00:05:34.759> of<00:05:35.090> 16<00:05:35.659> so<00:05:35.780> which<00:05:35.870> means<00:05:36.080> we<00:05:36.169> have<00:05:36.289> to

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:36.380 
speed of 16 so which means we have to

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:40.480 
speed of 16 so which means we have to
get<00:05:36.500> into<00:05:36.740> our<00:05:37.610> eighth<00:05:38.150> note<00:05:38.630> downs<00:05:39.440> one<00:05:40.190> and

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:40.490 
get into our eighth note downs one and

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:45.219 
get into our eighth note downs one and
two<00:05:40.940> and<00:05:41.270> three<00:05:41.300> and<00:05:42.050> four<00:05:42.650> and<00:05:43.009> so<00:05:43.900> that<00:05:44.900> first

00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:45.229 
two and three and four and so that first

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:48.029 
two and three and four and so that first
little<00:05:45.620> lick

00:05:48.029 --> 00:05:48.039 

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:50.409 

that's<00:05:49.039> about<00:05:49.340> the<00:05:49.400> trickiest<00:05:49.819> part<00:05:50.150> as<00:05:50.300> far

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:50.419 
that's about the trickiest part as far

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:52.629 
that's about the trickiest part as far
as<00:05:50.539> speed<00:05:50.810> goes<00:05:50.990> the<00:05:51.169> rest<00:05:51.319> of<00:05:51.500> it<00:05:51.620> is<00:05:51.830> and<00:05:52.430> then

00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:52.639 
as speed goes the rest of it is and then

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:54.100 
as speed goes the rest of it is and then
it<00:05:52.789> happens<00:05:53.030> again<00:05:53.090> in<00:05:53.599> the<00:05:53.750> third<00:05:53.930> measure

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:54.110 
it happens again in the third measure

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:57.999 
it happens again in the third measure
pretty<00:05:54.440> much<00:05:54.590> the<00:05:54.740> same<00:05:54.919> but<00:05:56.380> so<00:05:57.380> we're

00:05:57.999 --> 00:05:58.009 
pretty much the same but so we're

00:05:58.009 --> 00:06:00.040 
pretty much the same but so we're
looking<00:05:58.219> at<00:05:58.310> notes<00:05:58.520> here<00:05:58.849> pairs<00:05:59.630> of<00:05:59.840> notes

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:00.050 
looking at notes here pairs of notes

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:03.039 
looking at notes here pairs of notes
that<00:06:00.169> are<00:06:00.289> sixth<00:06:00.710> apart
