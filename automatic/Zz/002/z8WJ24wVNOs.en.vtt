series speakers I brought up DXR 12 it's

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.420 
series speakers I brought up DXR 12 it's
an<00:00:18.210> active<00:00:18.690> loudspeakers<00:00:19.380> it's<00:00:19.680> by<00:00:19.920> amplified

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
an active loudspeakers it's by amplified

an active loudspeakers it's by amplified
and<00:00:20.550> that<00:00:20.640> means<00:00:20.850> it<00:00:21.030> has<00:00:21.180> 2<00:00:21.480> power<00:00:21.750> amplifiers

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
and that means it has 2 power amplifiers

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.500 
and that means it has 2 power amplifiers
built<00:00:22.590> into<00:00:22.890> it<00:00:23.010> and<00:00:23.160> it's<00:00:23.640> self<00:00:23.970> powered<00:00:24.330> you

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
built into it and it's self powered you

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:25.880 
built into it and it's self powered you
can<00:00:24.630> tell<00:00:24.810> about<00:00:24.900> a<00:00:24.990> little<00:00:25.290> light<00:00:25.470> that's<00:00:25.710> on

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
can tell about a little light that's on

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.500 
can tell about a little light that's on
the<00:00:26.010> front<00:00:26.250> of<00:00:26.340> it<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.850> amplifiers<00:00:27.330> are

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
the front of it the amplifiers are

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.110 
the front of it the amplifiers are
actually<00:00:27.810> in<00:00:27.990> it<00:00:28.020> there's<00:00:28.440> an<00:00:28.620> 8-inch<00:00:29.120> Wolford

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:30.120 
actually in it there's an 8-inch Wolford

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.990 
actually in it there's an 8-inch Wolford
version<00:00:30.540> 10<00:00:31.020> a<00:00:31.290> 12<00:00:31.830> which<00:00:32.219> you<00:00:32.369> see<00:00:32.550> here<00:00:32.820> and

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
version 10 a 12 which you see here and

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.170 
version 10 a 12 which you see here and
then<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.329> DX<00:00:33.660> R<00:00:33.840> 15<00:00:34.170> how<00:00:34.680> much<00:00:34.800> power<00:00:35.040> this<00:00:35.969> is

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
then the DX R 15 how much power this is

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.119 
then the DX R 15 how much power this is
a<00:00:36.210> total<00:00:36.660> 1,100<00:00:37.350> watts<00:00:37.499> Wow

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
a total 1,100 watts Wow

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.739 
a total 1,100 watts Wow
so<00:00:38.309> it<00:00:38.399> gives<00:00:38.609> you<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:38.910> maximum<00:00:39.089> output<00:00:39.510> of

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:39.749 
so it gives you the maximum output of

00:00:39.749 --> 00:00:44.119 
so it gives you the maximum output of
132<00:00:40.589> dB<00:00:41.129> so<00:00:41.519> it<00:00:41.670> is<00:00:41.820> one<00:00:42.149> loud<00:00:42.600> loudspeaker<00:00:43.440> who

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
132 dB so it is one loud loudspeaker who

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.470 
132 dB so it is one loud loudspeaker who
would<00:00:44.280> be<00:00:44.399> using<00:00:44.579> this<00:00:44.850> what's<00:00:45.329> the

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
would be using this what's the

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.869 
would be using this what's the
application<00:00:45.600> a<00:00:46.230> good<00:00:46.559> application<00:00:46.769> for<00:00:47.219> this

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
application a good application for this

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.799 
application a good application for this
sized<00:00:48.179> speaker<00:00:48.629> would<00:00:48.809> be<00:00:49.019> any<00:00:49.530> of<00:00:49.949> the<00:00:50.129> DJ's<00:00:50.579> a

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
sized speaker would be any of the DJ's a

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:53.509 
sized speaker would be any of the DJ's a
band<00:00:51.809> that's<00:00:52.079> looking<00:00:52.589> for<00:00:52.800> a<00:00:52.949> full-range

00:00:53.509 --> 00:00:53.519 
band that's looking for a full-range

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:55.369 
band that's looking for a full-range
speaker<00:00:53.909> maybe<00:00:54.839> they're<00:00:55.050> gonna<00:00:55.140> add<00:00:55.350> a

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
speaker maybe they're gonna add a

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.829 
speaker maybe they're gonna add a
subwoofer<00:00:55.890> later<00:00:56.339> that<00:00:56.909> would<00:00:57.089> allow<00:00:57.569> them<00:00:57.780> to

00:00:57.829 --> 00:00:57.839 
subwoofer later that would allow them to

00:00:57.839 --> 00:00:59.869 
subwoofer later that would allow them to
use<00:00:58.499> something<00:00:58.739> like<00:00:58.949> this<00:00:59.159> just<00:00:59.489> fine

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
the box of design oh this is a composite

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.560 
the box of design oh this is a composite
cabinet<00:01:13.110> we<00:01:13.560> designed<00:01:14.399> this<00:01:14.610> with<00:01:14.880> our<00:01:15.119> sister

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
cabinet we designed this with our sister

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.170 
cabinet we designed this with our sister
company<00:01:15.990> on<00:01:16.200> neck<00:01:16.770> so<00:01:16.979> this<00:01:17.460> cabinet<00:01:17.969> will

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
company on neck so this cabinet will

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.880 
company on neck so this cabinet will
have<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.570> fly<00:01:18.750> points<00:01:19.170> on<00:01:19.290> it<00:01:19.439> so<00:01:19.770> that<00:01:19.860> you

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
have the fly points on it so that you

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.709 
have the fly points on it so that you
can<00:01:20.100> hang<00:01:20.280> it<00:01:20.399> up<00:01:20.490> if<00:01:20.640> you<00:01:20.670> like<00:01:20.789> okay<00:01:21.329> and<00:01:21.570> it

00:01:21.709 --> 00:01:21.719 
can hang it up if you like okay and it

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:24.020 
can hang it up if you like okay and it
also<00:01:21.960> has<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.350> pull<00:01:22.680> socket<00:01:23.100> underneath<00:01:23.520> so<00:01:23.969> you

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
also has a pull socket underneath so you

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.940 
also has a pull socket underneath so you
can<00:01:24.180> put<00:01:24.299> it<00:01:24.390> on<00:01:24.420> a<00:01:24.600> pole<00:01:24.869> or<00:01:25.229> a<00:01:25.439> tripod

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
can put it on a pole or a tripod

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.859 
can put it on a pole or a tripod
something<00:01:26.310> like<00:01:26.460> this<00:01:26.670> but<00:01:27.240> it<00:01:27.360> also<00:01:27.509> tilts

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
something like this but it also tilts

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.260 
something like this but it also tilts
down<00:01:28.049> so<00:01:28.590> to<00:01:28.979> pull<00:01:29.250> sockets<00:01:29.670> so<00:01:29.759> you<00:01:30.119> can

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
down so to pull sockets so you can

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.999 
down so to pull sockets so you can
actually<00:01:30.420> fire<00:01:30.810> it<00:01:30.990> into<00:01:31.259> your<00:01:31.409> crowd<00:01:31.680> all

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
actually fire it into your crowd all

a<00:01:40.289> lot<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:40.770> they<00:01:41.130> don't<00:01:41.159> want<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:41.549> take<00:01:41.759> us<00:01:41.939> big

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
a lot and they don't want to take us big

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.399 
a lot and they don't want to take us big
mixer<00:01:42.600> out<00:01:42.750> with<00:01:42.930> them<00:01:43.020> so<00:01:43.170> if<00:01:43.259> you're<00:01:43.380> just

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
mixer out with them so if you're just

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.560 
mixer out with them so if you're just
gonna<00:01:43.740> play<00:01:44.159> back<00:01:44.369> music<00:01:44.850> maybe<00:01:45.030> and<00:01:45.299> only

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
gonna play back music maybe and only

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.330 
gonna play back music maybe and only
only<00:01:46.140> speak<00:01:46.409> through<00:01:46.439> a<00:01:46.619> microphone<00:01:47.100> you

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
only speak through a microphone you

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.090 
only speak through a microphone you
could<00:01:47.729> put<00:01:47.909> a<00:01:47.939> mic<00:01:48.509> in<00:01:48.750> okay<00:01:49.289> channel<00:01:49.649> one<00:01:49.829> and

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
could put a mic in okay channel one and

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.010 
could put a mic in okay channel one and
then<00:01:50.490> you'd<00:01:50.640> have<00:01:50.759> your<00:01:50.939> stereo<00:01:51.210> input<00:01:51.750> here

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
then you'd have your stereo input here

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.499 
then you'd have your stereo input here
or<00:01:52.170> here<00:01:52.920> for<00:01:53.189> either<00:01:53.429> an<00:01:53.640> iPod<00:01:54.060> or<00:01:54.090> maybe<00:01:54.420> a

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
or here for either an iPod or maybe a

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.389 
or here for either an iPod or maybe a
keyboard<00:01:54.990> something<00:01:55.380> like<00:01:55.500> this<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:56.009> then

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
keyboard something like this and then

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.279 
keyboard something like this and then
you'd<00:01:56.549> have<00:01:56.670> separate<00:01:57.149> level<00:01:57.479> controls<00:01:57.990> over

00:01:58.279 --> 00:01:58.289 
you'd have separate level controls over

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:00.380 
you'd have separate level controls over
each<00:01:58.409> one<00:01:58.439> of<00:01:58.710> them<00:01:59.009> and<00:01:59.189> then<00:01:59.909> what<00:02:00.090> we<00:02:00.210> did

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
each one of them and then what we did

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.139 
each one of them and then what we did
one<00:02:00.960> extra<00:02:01.469> thing<00:02:01.520> instead<00:02:02.520> of<00:02:02.579> just<00:02:02.850> giving

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
one extra thing instead of just giving

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.209 
one extra thing instead of just giving
you<00:02:03.240> a<00:02:03.270> loop<00:02:03.600> through<00:02:03.929> for<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:04.350> output<00:02:04.770> in

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
you a loop through for the output in

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.219 
you a loop through for the output in
order<00:02:05.369> that<00:02:05.670> we<00:02:05.759> keep<00:02:05.969> it<00:02:06.179> in<00:02:06.299> full<00:02:06.539> stereo<00:02:06.869> if

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
order that we keep it in full stereo if

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.249 
order that we keep it in full stereo if
you<00:02:07.679> use<00:02:07.890> this<00:02:08.160> link<00:02:08.520> mode<00:02:08.910> and<00:02:09.300> you<00:02:09.600> get<00:02:09.810> only

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
you use this link mode and you get only

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.110 
you use this link mode and you get only
the<00:02:10.470> right<00:02:10.679> channel<00:02:11.100> information<00:02:11.340> coming<00:02:12.000> out

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
the right channel information coming out

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.360 
the right channel information coming out
of<00:02:12.240> this<00:02:12.330> XLR<00:02:12.900> over<00:02:13.260> to<00:02:13.319> the<00:02:13.409> other<00:02:13.500> side<00:02:13.769> so<00:02:14.250> in

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
of this XLR over to the other side so in

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.040 
of this XLR over to the other side so in
other<00:02:14.489> words<00:02:14.760> your<00:02:15.090> microphone<00:02:15.720> and<00:02:15.900> being

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
mono out of those speakers but you

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.940 
mono out of those speakers but you
keep<00:02:18.209> your<00:02:18.420> full<00:02:18.630> stereo<00:02:19.080> from<00:02:19.380> your<00:02:19.590> stereo

keep your full stereo from your stereo

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.920 
keep your full stereo from your stereo
sense<00:02:20.280> okay<00:02:20.610> make<00:02:20.970> it<00:02:21.000> nice<00:02:21.270> and<00:02:21.300> clean<00:02:21.720> for

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
sense okay make it nice and clean for

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.150

your<00:02:21.989> hookup<00:02:22.349> all<00:02:22.560> right<00:02:22.739> nice

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
your hookup all right nice

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.309 
your hookup all right nice
you<00:02:23.310> got<00:02:23.430> a<00:02:23.459> DSP<00:02:23.760> section<00:02:24.360> over<00:02:24.569> here<00:02:24.599> yeah

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
you got a DSP section over here yeah

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:26.870 
you got a DSP section over here yeah
that's<00:02:25.650> probably<00:02:26.220> one<00:02:26.550> of<00:02:26.580> the<00:02:26.700> more

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
that's probably one of the more

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.720 
that's probably one of the more
important<00:02:27.360> and<00:02:27.569> overlooked<00:02:28.470> areas<00:02:28.920> of<00:02:29.160> the

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
important and overlooked areas of the

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.030 
important and overlooked areas of the
speaker<00:02:30.180> when<00:02:30.450> especially<00:02:30.810> in<00:02:31.170> the<00:02:31.290> story<00:02:31.590> you

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
speaker when especially in the story you

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.670 
speaker when especially in the story you
can't<00:02:32.310> see<00:02:32.520> behind<00:02:32.880> it<00:02:33.060> this<00:02:33.720> D<00:02:34.050> contour<00:02:34.590> or

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
can't see behind it this D contour or

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.070 
can't see behind it this D contour or
digital<00:02:35.130> contour<00:02:35.610> circuit<00:02:36.090> allow<00:02:36.569> so<00:02:36.780> we<00:02:36.900> can

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
digital contour circuit allow so we can

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.740 
digital contour circuit allow so we can
burn<00:02:37.319> in<00:02:37.500> EQ<00:02:37.950> for<00:02:38.370> you<00:02:38.580> that<00:02:38.849> sounds<00:02:39.150> really

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
burn in EQ for you that sounds really

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.890 
burn in EQ for you that sounds really
good<00:02:39.959> for<00:02:40.890> front<00:02:41.099> of<00:02:41.160> house<00:02:41.310> or<00:02:41.610> main<00:02:42.000> use<00:02:42.390> so

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
good for front of house or main use so

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.170 
good for front of house or main use so
this<00:02:43.110> allows<00:02:43.500> it<00:02:43.739> warms<00:02:44.160> up<00:02:44.310> the<00:02:44.489> bass<00:02:44.670> it's

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
this allows it warms up the bass it's

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.550 
this allows it warms up the bass it's
going<00:02:45.360> to<00:02:45.420> give<00:02:45.599> you<00:02:45.690> that<00:02:45.840> a<00:02:45.900> little<00:02:46.140> bit<00:02:46.349> more

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
going to give you that a little bit more

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.589 
going to give you that a little bit more
clarity<00:02:46.890> at<00:02:47.130> the<00:02:47.250> top<00:02:47.459> end<00:02:47.700> yeah<00:02:48.000> that<00:02:48.239> sort<00:02:48.450> of

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599 
clarity at the top end yeah that sort of

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:51.080 
clarity at the top end yeah that sort of
thing<00:02:48.780> and<00:02:49.110> you<00:02:49.680> can<00:02:49.830> turn<00:02:50.069> the<00:02:50.459> contour<00:02:50.880> off

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
thing and you can turn the contour off

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.539 
thing and you can turn the contour off
if<00:02:51.510> you're<00:02:51.930> using<00:02:52.170> multiple<00:02:52.440> cabinets<00:02:53.340> so

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 
if you're using multiple cabinets so

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:55.309 
if you're using multiple cabinets so
sometimes<00:02:53.970> you<00:02:54.090> get<00:02:54.209> that<00:02:54.360> bass<00:02:54.600> buildup<00:02:55.140> yeah

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
sometimes you get that bass buildup yeah

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:58.160 
sometimes you get that bass buildup yeah
and<00:02:55.620> then<00:02:56.220> the<00:02:56.790> other<00:02:56.940> feature<00:02:57.269> that<00:02:57.630> comes<00:02:57.900> on

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
and then the other feature that comes on

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.699 
and then the other feature that comes on
the<00:02:58.350> DX<00:02:58.860> ours<00:02:59.130> is<00:02:59.370> the<00:03:00.030> monitor<00:03:00.630> switch<00:03:01.200> which

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
the DX ours is the monitor switch which

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.039 
the DX ours is the monitor switch which
allows<00:03:01.739> you<00:03:02.190> to<00:03:02.250> use<00:03:02.340> it<00:03:02.489> as<00:03:02.790> a<00:03:02.819> floor<00:03:03.180> wedge<00:03:03.450> so

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049 
allows you to use it as a floor wedge so

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:06.050 
allows you to use it as a floor wedge so
for<00:03:04.260> instance<00:03:04.650> if<00:03:04.830> you<00:03:05.040> put<00:03:05.340> this<00:03:05.489> down<00:03:05.730> on<00:03:05.790> the

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
for instance if you put this down on the

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.880 
for instance if you put this down on the
floor<00:03:06.330> the<00:03:06.720> first<00:03:06.989> thing<00:03:07.260> any<00:03:07.440> monitor

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
floor the first thing any monitor

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.800 
floor the first thing any monitor
engineer<00:03:08.010> does<00:03:08.489> is<00:03:08.700> roll<00:03:08.940> off<00:03:09.120> low<00:03:09.299> end<00:03:09.540> so<00:03:09.720> you

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
engineer does is roll off low end so you

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.570 
engineer does is roll off low end so you
don't<00:03:09.840> get<00:03:10.080> that<00:03:10.230> Rumble<00:03:10.620> okay<00:03:10.980> it<00:03:11.160> does<00:03:11.370> that

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
don't get that Rumble okay it does that

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.729 
don't get that Rumble okay it does that
automatically<00:03:12.209> oh<00:03:12.480> nice<00:03:12.780> and<00:03:13.049> then<00:03:13.260> you<00:03:13.560> get<00:03:13.680> a

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
automatically oh nice and then you get a

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:15.470 
automatically oh nice and then you get a
bump<00:03:13.980> in<00:03:14.160> the<00:03:14.190> high<00:03:14.400> end<00:03:14.610> for<00:03:14.790> your<00:03:14.910> vocal

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
bump in the high end for your vocal
