lucky there but what you have to do in

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.469 
lucky there but what you have to do in
my<00:01:13.920> opinion<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.369> best<00:01:14.610> way<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:14.880> do<00:01:15.119> this<00:01:15.270> is

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
my opinion the best way to do this is

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.570 
my opinion the best way to do this is
you<00:01:15.659> go<00:01:15.810> on<00:01:15.900> gold<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:16.590> then<00:01:16.950> you<00:01:17.070> click<00:01:17.280> search

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
you go on gold and then you click search

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.060 
you go on gold and then you click search
and<00:01:17.850> then<00:01:18.360> you<00:01:18.509> move<00:01:18.750> it<00:01:18.960> from<00:01:19.229> gold<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.740> any

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
and then you move it from gold to any

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.370 
and then you move it from gold to any
and<00:01:20.430> you<00:01:20.759> need<00:01:20.939> to<00:01:21.030> repeatedly<00:01:21.420> do<00:01:21.900> this<00:01:22.140> so

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
and you need to repeatedly do this so

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.020 
and you need to repeatedly do this so
literally<00:01:22.799> you<00:01:22.830> just<00:01:23.100> keep<00:01:23.250> doing<00:01:23.670> this<00:01:23.820> until

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
literally you just keep doing this until

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.899 
literally you just keep doing this until
a<00:01:24.869> hole<00:01:25.080> comes<00:01:25.409> up<00:01:25.590> now<00:01:25.799> usually<00:01:26.549> this<00:01:26.729> will

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
a hole comes up now usually this will

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.690 
a hole comes up now usually this will
take<00:01:27.090> like<00:01:27.330> 10<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:28.200> 15<00:01:28.650> minutes<00:01:28.979> for<00:01:29.369> something

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
take like 10 to 15 minutes for something

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.249 
take like 10 to 15 minutes for something
to<00:01:29.850> come<00:01:30.000> up<00:01:30.119> depending<00:01:30.689> on<00:01:30.780> their<00:01:30.900> rarity

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
to come up depending on their rarity

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.069 
to come up depending on their rarity
it's<00:01:31.799> just<00:01:32.150> sometimes<00:01:33.150> it<00:01:33.479> glitches<00:01:33.720> up<00:01:33.960> as

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
it's just sometimes it glitches up as

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.370 
it's just sometimes it glitches up as
well<00:01:34.200> but<00:01:34.590> I'm<00:01:34.799> yeah<00:01:35.430> it's<00:01:35.640> it's<00:01:36.000> just

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
well but I'm yeah it's it's just

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.510 
well but I'm yeah it's it's just
patience<00:01:37.380> basically<00:01:37.890> just<00:01:38.130> need<00:01:38.220> to<00:01:38.369> keep

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520

Ferrara's<00:03:39.360> lay<00:03:39.570> and<00:03:39.780> it's<00:03:40.080> kind<00:03:40.290> of<00:03:40.350> stupid

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
Ferrara's lay and it's kind of stupid

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.920 
Ferrara's lay and it's kind of stupid
because<00:03:40.950> the<00:03:41.280> price<00:03:41.549> range<00:03:41.880> is<00:03:42.120> for<00:03:42.570> Herrera

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
because the price range is for Herrera

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.960 
because the price range is for Herrera
and<00:03:43.290> when<00:03:43.799> Fellaini<00:03:44.160> and<00:03:44.370> Carrick<00:03:44.670> were<00:03:44.790> there

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
and when Fellaini and Carrick were there

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.210 
and when Fellaini and Carrick were there
were<00:03:45.090> 30<00:03:45.420> k<00:03:45.750> and<00:03:46.049> that's<00:03:46.200> why<00:03:46.470> none<00:03:46.920> of<00:03:46.980> these

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
were 30 k and that's why none of these

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.580 
were 30 k and that's why none of these
cards<00:03:47.519> come<00:03:47.730> up<00:03:47.880> because<00:03:48.060> no<00:03:48.780> one<00:03:48.959> wants<00:03:49.380> to

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
cards come up because no one wants to

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.740 
cards come up because no one wants to
sell<00:03:50.130> them<00:03:50.310> for<00:03:50.519> just<00:03:50.549> a<00:03:50.850> geeky<00:03:51.180> be<00:03:51.600> I'll<00:03:51.720> be
