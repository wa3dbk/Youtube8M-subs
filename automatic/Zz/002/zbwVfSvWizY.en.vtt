now<00:00:08.309> to<00:00:08.370> do<00:00:08.550> this<00:00:08.670> problem<00:00:08.910> going<00:00:09.120> to<00:00:09.240> review

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
now to do this problem going to review

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.839 
now to do this problem going to review
some<00:00:09.840> rules<00:00:10.139> and<00:00:10.550> shifting<00:00:11.550> graphs

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
some rules and shifting graphs

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.940 
some rules and shifting graphs
horizontal<00:00:12.660> horizontally<00:00:13.500> and<00:00:13.620> vertically

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
horizontal horizontally and vertically

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:20.510 
horizontal horizontally and vertically
if<00:00:14.509> I<00:00:15.509> have<00:00:15.780> my<00:00:16.170> f<00:00:16.320> of<00:00:16.500> X<00:00:16.680> and<00:00:18.380> I<00:00:19.380> add<00:00:19.680> a<00:00:20.250> number

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
if I have my f of X and I add a number

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.859 
if I have my f of X and I add a number
outside<00:00:20.880> of<00:00:21.630> the<00:00:21.720> function<00:00:22.609> to<00:00:23.609> it<00:00:23.760> this<00:00:24.660> is

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
outside of the function to it this is

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:34.459 
outside of the function to it this is
going<00:00:25.230> to<00:00:25.470> be<00:00:25.680> a<00:00:25.859> vertical<00:00:26.640> shift<00:00:33.170> now<00:00:34.170> if<00:00:34.320> this

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
going to be a vertical shift now if this

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.930 
going to be a vertical shift now if this
number<00:00:34.680> is<00:00:34.860> positive<00:00:37.340> the<00:00:38.340> graph<00:00:38.370> will<00:00:38.820> be

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
number is positive the graph will be

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.619 
number is positive the graph will be
shifted<00:00:39.450> up<00:00:39.660> if<00:00:40.280> the<00:00:41.280> number<00:00:41.610> is<00:00:41.640> negative<00:00:42.120> if

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
shifted up if the number is negative if

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.549 
shifted up if the number is negative if
it's<00:00:43.230> f<00:00:43.379> of<00:00:43.500> X<00:00:43.710> minus<00:00:44.309> a<00:00:44.820> constant<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:46.260> shift

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
it's f of X minus a constant the shift

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.889 
it's f of X minus a constant the shift
is<00:00:46.739> going<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:46.950> go<00:00:47.129> down<00:00:50.300> the<00:00:51.300> next<00:00:51.539> one<00:00:51.629> I<00:00:51.660> want

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
is going to go down the next one I want

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.600 
is going to go down the next one I want
to<00:00:51.960> review<00:00:52.230> is<00:00:52.469> if<00:00:52.770> i<00:00:52.890> have<00:00:53.010> f<00:00:53.250> of<00:00:53.550> X<00:00:54.860> plus<00:00:55.860> C<00:00:56.340> and

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
to review is if i have f of X plus C and

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.330 
to review is if i have f of X plus C and
this<00:00:57.059> plus<00:00:57.360> C<00:00:57.570> is<00:00:57.629> within<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.739> function<00:00:58.949> and

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
this plus C is within the function and

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.220 
this plus C is within the function and
that's<00:01:00.030> kind<00:01:00.239> of<00:01:00.270> what's<00:01:00.449> going<00:01:00.660> on<00:01:00.899> in<00:01:01.109> our

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
that's kind of what's going on in our

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.380 
that's kind of what's going on in our
problem<00:01:01.710> this<00:01:02.370> is<00:01:02.550> going<00:01:02.789> to<00:01:03.090> be<00:01:03.390> a<00:01:05.390> horizontal

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
problem this is going to be a horizontal

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:14.730 
problem this is going to be a horizontal
shift

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:14.740 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.830 

now<00:01:15.640> horizontal<00:01:15.939> shifts<00:01:16.329> are<00:01:16.420> kind<00:01:16.600> of<00:01:16.659> weird

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
now horizontal shifts are kind of weird

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.730 
now horizontal shifts are kind of weird
because<00:01:17.079> if<00:01:17.500> this<00:01:17.979> is<00:01:18.130> positive<00:01:19.470> your<00:01:20.470> gut<00:01:20.710> and

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
because if this is positive your gut and

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.410 
because if this is positive your gut and
instinct<00:01:21.579> would<00:01:21.700> tell<00:01:21.939> you<00:01:22.060> it<00:01:22.149> while<00:01:22.299> it's

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
instinct would tell you it while it's

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:23.820 
instinct would tell you it while it's
going<00:01:22.450> to<00:01:22.600> be<00:01:22.659> moved<00:01:22.840> to<00:01:22.930> the<00:01:22.990> right<00:01:23.170> but<00:01:23.590> its

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:23.830 
going to be moved to the right but its

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.010 
going to be moved to the right but its
opposite<00:01:24.369> what<00:01:24.580> you<00:01:24.670> think<00:01:24.939> if<00:01:25.149> it's<00:01:25.689> positive

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
opposite what you think if it's positive

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.139 
opposite what you think if it's positive
it's<00:01:26.920> going<00:01:27.130> to<00:01:27.189> be<00:01:27.310> moving<00:01:27.490> to<00:01:28.149> the<00:01:28.240> left<00:01:28.590> and

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:30.149 
it's going to be moving to the left and

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:34.710 
it's going to be moving to the left and
if<00:01:31.149> this<00:01:31.360> was<00:01:31.630> X<00:01:31.930> minus<00:01:32.439> some<00:01:32.979> constant<00:01:33.570> if<00:01:34.570> it

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 
if this was X minus some constant if it

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.950 
if this was X minus some constant if it
was<00:01:34.840> negative<00:01:34.990> it's<00:01:35.710> going<00:01:35.799> to<00:01:35.950> be<00:01:36.039> a<00:01:36.070> shift<00:01:36.960> to

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
was negative it's going to be a shift to

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.969 
was negative it's going to be a shift to
the<00:01:37.990> right<00:01:39.030> so<00:01:40.030> looking<00:01:40.390> at<00:01:40.570> this<00:01:40.979> expression

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
the right so looking at this expression

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:45.179 
the right so looking at this expression
here<00:01:42.250> f<00:01:42.460> of<00:01:42.939> X<00:01:43.179> plus<00:01:43.509> 2<00:01:43.539> this<00:01:44.259> is<00:01:44.320> a<00:01:44.500> horizontal

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:45.189 
here f of X plus 2 this is a horizontal

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:47.430 
here f of X plus 2 this is a horizontal
shift<00:01:45.250> and<00:01:45.759> because<00:01:46.420> it's<00:01:46.570> positive<00:01:47.200> it's

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:47.440 
shift and because it's positive it's

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.809 
shift and because it's positive it's
going<00:01:47.770> to<00:01:47.830> be<00:01:47.979> shift<00:01:48.750> shifted<00:01:49.750> to<00:01:49.959> the<00:01:50.080> left

00:01:50.809 --> 00:01:50.819 
going to be shift shifted to the left

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:55.440 
going to be shift shifted to the left
too<00:01:52.500> so<00:01:53.500> here's<00:01:53.740> our<00:01:53.860> original<00:01:53.979> graph<00:01:54.459> and<00:01:54.759> if

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
too so here's our original graph and if

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.449 
too so here's our original graph and if
I<00:01:55.569> shifted<00:01:56.049> I<00:01:56.259> usually<00:01:56.649> just<00:01:56.709> take<00:01:56.950> one<00:01:57.159> point

00:01:57.449 --> 00:01:57.459 
I shifted I usually just take one point

00:01:57.459 --> 00:02:00.270 
I shifted I usually just take one point
move<00:01:57.850> it<00:01:58.000> over<00:01:58.060> to<00:01:58.380> so<00:01:59.380> there's<00:01:59.619> where<00:01:59.979> my<00:02:00.100> new

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
move it over to so there's where my new

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.029 
move it over to so there's where my new
vertex<00:02:00.670> should<00:02:01.360> be<00:02:01.539> if<00:02:01.720> i<00:02:02.289> look<00:02:02.440> at<00:02:02.590> my<00:02:02.740> graphs

00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:03.039 
vertex should be if i look at my graphs

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:08.459 
vertex should be if i look at my graphs
down<00:02:03.399> here<00:02:03.940> it's<00:02:04.840> going<00:02:05.110> to<00:02:05.289> be<00:02:05.470> choice<00:02:06.069> 3
