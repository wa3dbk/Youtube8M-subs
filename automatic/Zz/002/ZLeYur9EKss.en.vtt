tram and I'm gonna end it here I have
figured<00:06:50.210> out<00:06:50.420> a<00:06:50.480> way<00:06:51.100> apparently<00:06:52.100> to<00:06:54.370> get

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:55.370 
figured out a way apparently to get

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:57.400 
figured out a way apparently to get
longer<00:06:55.820> record<00:06:56.390> sessions<00:06:56.630> without<00:06:56.900> a<00:06:57.110> lot

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:57.410 
longer record sessions without a lot

00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:59.640 
longer record sessions without a lot
lagging<00:06:58.010> and<00:06:58.190> thats<00:06:58.460> fix<00:06:59.000> would<00:06:59.270> be

00:06:59.640 --> 00:06:59.650 
lagging and thats fix would be

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:02.350 
lagging and thats fix would be
completely<00:07:00.650> restarting<00:07:01.130> my<00:07:01.160> computer<00:07:01.360> fun
