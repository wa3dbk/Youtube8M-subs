a<00:00:36.210> closer<00:00:36.510> look<00:00:36.809> at<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.140> combs<00:00:37.469> and<00:00:38.090> hopefully

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
a closer look at the combs and hopefully

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.430 
a closer look at the combs and hopefully
you'll<00:00:39.239> be<00:00:39.270> able<00:00:39.390> to<00:00:39.629> tell<00:00:39.870> that<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.170> combs

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
you'll be able to tell that the combs

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.400 
you'll be able to tell that the combs
are<00:00:40.710> sort<00:00:41.100> of<00:00:41.420> beveled<00:00:42.420> on<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.780> end<00:00:42.960> there

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
are sort of beveled on the end there

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.630 
are sort of beveled on the end there
smoother<00:00:44.399> than<00:00:44.730> most<00:00:45.120> um<00:00:46.100> homes<00:00:47.100> they<00:00:47.460> don't

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
smoother than most um homes they don't

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.060 
smoother than most um homes they don't
have<00:00:47.820> like<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.780> prong<00:00:49.079> tip<00:00:49.969> and<00:00:51.829> so<00:00:52.829> they

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
have like the the prong tip and so they

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.979 
have like the the prong tip and so they
actually<00:00:53.670> go<00:00:54.149> into<00:00:54.329> your<00:00:54.600> hair<00:00:54.809> a<00:00:54.840> little

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
actually go into your hair a little

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.369 
actually go into your hair a little
easier<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:56.600> there's<00:00:57.600> a<00:00:57.750> better<00:00:57.930> look<00:00:58.140> at<00:00:58.289> what

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
easier and there's a better look at what

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.889 
easier and there's a better look at what
the<00:00:58.500> cap<00:00:58.710> looks<00:00:58.949> like<00:01:00.350> and<00:01:02.359> your<00:01:03.359> fingers<00:01:03.719> can

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
the cap looks like and your fingers can

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.990 
the cap looks like and your fingers can
go<00:01:04.080> through<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.500> cap<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:05.159> so<00:01:05.460> that<00:01:05.640> makes<00:01:05.880> it

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
go through the cap and so that makes it

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.700 
go through the cap and so that makes it
for<00:01:06.210> a<00:01:06.240> more<00:01:06.450> comfortable<00:01:06.720> fit<00:01:07.200> in<00:01:07.380> case<00:01:07.560> you

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
to give you a close-up of what it looks

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.020 
to give you a close-up of what it looks
like<00:02:30.860> you<00:02:31.860> can<00:02:32.040> see<00:02:32.280> that<00:02:32.310> it<00:02:32.580> matches<00:02:32.790> the

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
like you can see that it matches the

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:42.080 
like you can see that it matches the
texture<00:02:33.570> very<00:02:33.900> well<00:02:34.170> in<00:02:34.350> a<00:02:34.470> second<00:02:34.830> here<00:02:41.090> so

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
texture very well in a second here so

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.640 
texture very well in a second here so
you<00:02:42.150> can<00:02:42.269> see<00:02:42.300> the<00:02:42.540> color<00:02:42.780> and<00:02:43.050> the<00:02:43.080> texture<00:02:43.470> of

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
you can see the color and the texture of

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:49.930 
you can see the color and the texture of
it<00:02:43.920> matches<00:02:44.430> pretty<00:02:44.670> well<00:02:46.280> so<00:02:47.280> that<00:02:47.459> works

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.190 

just<00:02:50.940> take<00:02:51.090> your<00:02:51.209> fingers<00:02:51.600> and<00:02:51.630> try<00:02:51.900> to<00:02:51.959> blend

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
just take your fingers and try to blend

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.400 
just take your fingers and try to blend
it<00:02:52.410> in<00:02:53.269> it's<00:02:54.269> just<00:02:54.480> that<00:02:54.630> simple<00:02:54.810> no<00:02:55.170> heat

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
it in it's just that simple no heat

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:03.320 
it in it's just that simple no heat
required<00:03:01.070> now<00:03:02.070> I'm<00:03:02.220> finger<00:03:02.550> combing<00:03:02.850> it<00:03:03.090> and

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
required now I'm finger combing it and

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:04.759 
required now I'm finger combing it and
it's<00:03:03.450> a<00:03:03.540> little<00:03:03.690> thinner<00:03:04.200> than<00:03:04.470> I<00:03:04.590> would<00:03:04.739> like

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
it's a little thinner than I would like

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:09.350 
it's a little thinner than I would like
it<00:03:05.070> to<00:03:05.220> be<00:03:06.890> okay<00:03:07.890> so<00:03:08.190> wasn't<00:03:08.640> quite<00:03:08.820> as<00:03:08.970> full<00:03:09.239> as

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
it to be okay so wasn't quite as full as

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.630 
it to be okay so wasn't quite as full as
I<00:03:09.480> wanted<00:03:09.900> it<00:03:10.050> and<00:03:10.350> so<00:03:10.890> what<00:03:11.100> I'm<00:03:11.190> doing<00:03:11.459> now<00:03:11.489> is

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
I wanted it and so what I'm doing now is

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.590 
I wanted it and so what I'm doing now is
clipping<00:03:12.150> in<00:03:12.570> one<00:03:12.930> pack<00:03:13.230> of<00:03:13.500> the<00:03:13.970> same<00:03:14.970> texture

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
clipping in one pack of the same texture

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.380 
clipping in one pack of the same texture
SAMCRO<00:03:16.320> pattern<00:03:16.769> clip<00:03:17.370> in<00:03:17.550> so<00:03:17.850> I<00:03:17.880> just<00:03:18.120> wanted

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
SAMCRO pattern clip in so I just wanted

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.790 
SAMCRO pattern clip in so I just wanted
to<00:03:18.420> record<00:03:19.410> at<00:03:19.590> least<00:03:19.800> one<00:03:20.870> this<00:03:21.870> is<00:03:22.200> a<00:03:22.470> little

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 
to record at least one this is a little

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:29.390 
to record at least one this is a little
low<00:03:23.660> let's<00:03:24.660> see<00:03:24.900> if<00:03:25.050> I<00:03:25.170> can<00:03:25.200> tilt<00:03:26.130> you<00:03:26.250> up<00:03:28.400> okay

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
low let's see if I can tilt you up okay

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.750 
low let's see if I can tilt you up okay
so<00:03:29.970> here's<00:03:30.239> one<00:03:30.480> of<00:03:30.600> the<00:03:30.630> clip<00:03:30.900> ins<00:03:31.610> just<00:03:32.610> going

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
so here's one of the clip ins just going

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.500 
so here's one of the clip ins just going
to<00:03:32.850> open<00:03:32.880> up<00:03:33.120> the<00:03:33.239> clips<00:03:34.940> this<00:03:35.940> is<00:03:36.150> one<00:03:36.299> of<00:03:36.420> the

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
to open up the clips this is one of the

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.500 
to open up the clips this is one of the
longer<00:03:36.840> pieces<00:03:37.140> and<00:03:37.760> then<00:03:38.760> I've<00:03:38.910> had<00:03:38.940> half<00:03:39.480> the

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
longer pieces and then I've had half the

00:03:39.510 --> 00:04:39.510 
longer pieces and then I've had half the
hair<00:03:39.930> sectioned<00:03:40.440> off<00:03:40.530> on<00:03:40.739> the<00:03:40.799> back

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.850 

and<00:04:40.520> see<00:04:41.389> how<00:04:41.539> that's<00:04:41.750> just<00:04:42.020> making<00:04:42.440> it<00:04:42.650> a

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
and see how that's just making it a

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.649 
and see how that's just making it a
little<00:04:43.159> bit<00:04:43.310> more<00:04:43.460> full<00:04:43.789> so<00:04:44.360> i'm<00:04:44.419> going<00:04:44.569> to

00:04:44.649 --> 00:04:44.659 
little bit more full so i'm going to

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:46.089 
little bit more full so i'm going to
have<00:04:44.810> go<00:04:45.020> ahead<00:04:45.199> and<00:04:45.349> continue<00:04:45.470> to<00:04:45.710> do<00:04:45.919> that

00:04:46.089 --> 00:04:46.099 
have go ahead and continue to do that

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:50.080 
have go ahead and continue to do that
and<00:04:46.340> then<00:04:46.400> i'll<00:04:46.520> be<00:04:46.639> back<00:04:46.789> the<00:04:47.300> final<00:04:47.930> look
