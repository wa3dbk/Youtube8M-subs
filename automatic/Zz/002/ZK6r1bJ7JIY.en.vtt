00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.890 
I like to do this by using a shell
itself<00:02:19.650> to<00:02:19.830> assist<00:02:20.129> me<00:02:20.310> hoping<00:02:21.299> the<00:02:21.450> over<00:02:21.870> a

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
itself to assist me hoping the over a

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.860 
itself to assist me hoping the over a
container<00:02:22.319> and<00:02:22.760> just<00:02:23.760> shifting<00:02:24.269> the<00:02:24.629> yoke

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
container and just shifting the yoke

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:33.339 
container and just shifting the yoke
back<00:02:25.080> and<00:02:25.319> forth<00:02:25.590> until<00:02:26.420> the<00:02:27.420> white<00:02:28.250> comes<00:02:29.250> off

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:33.349 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:35.360 

and<00:02:34.349> now<00:02:34.650> if<00:02:34.769> you've<00:02:34.890> got<00:02:34.920> another<00:02:35.190> use<00:02:35.340> for

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
and now if you've got another use for

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.009 
and now if you've got another use for
the<00:02:35.580> egg<00:02:35.700> yolk<00:02:35.910> you<00:02:36.060> can<00:02:36.239> retain<00:02:36.540> the<00:02:36.660> egg<00:02:36.780> yolk

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
the egg yolk you can retain the egg yolk

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:42.080 
the egg yolk you can retain the egg yolk
but<00:02:37.200> I<00:02:37.290> don't<00:02:37.530> so<00:02:38.060> how'd<00:02:39.060> it<00:02:39.090> goes<00:02:40.819> in<00:02:41.819> this

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
but I don't so how'd it goes in this

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.789 
but I don't so how'd it goes in this
drink<00:02:42.299> we're<00:02:42.480> only<00:02:42.569> using<00:02:42.690> half<00:02:43.260> of<00:02:43.560> an<00:02:43.680> egg

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:43.799 
drink we're only using half of an egg

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:45.710 
drink we're only using half of an egg
white<00:02:44.040> part<00:02:44.940> of<00:02:45.000> the<00:02:45.060> reason<00:02:45.299> for<00:02:45.329> that<00:02:45.450> is

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
white part of the reason for that is

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.030 
white part of the reason for that is
they're<00:02:45.930> wanting<00:02:46.200> the<00:02:46.290> egg<00:02:46.410> white<00:02:46.620> to<00:02:46.739> provide

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
they're wanting the egg white to provide

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.039 
they're wanting the egg white to provide
a<00:02:47.069> foam<00:02:47.519> and<00:02:47.760> a<00:02:47.819> froth<00:02:48.030> to<00:02:48.269> it<00:02:48.360> but<00:02:48.480> not<00:02:48.599> too

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
a foam and a froth to it but not too

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:51.110 
a foam and a froth to it but not too
much<00:02:49.260> foam<00:02:49.500> and<00:02:49.650> not<00:02:49.769> too<00:02:49.890> much<00:02:50.040> for<00:02:50.250> us<00:02:50.280> and<00:02:50.459> so

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
much foam and not too much for us and so

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.690 
much foam and not too much for us and so
it's<00:02:51.299> not<00:02:51.450> really<00:02:51.810> an<00:02:52.200> accurate<00:02:52.440> measure<00:02:53.069> but

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
it's not really an accurate measure but

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:54.920 
it's not really an accurate measure but
just<00:02:53.849> take<00:02:54.030> and<00:02:54.269> don't<00:02:54.420> pour<00:02:54.690> the<00:02:54.810> entire

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
just take and don't pour the entire

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.030 
just take and don't pour the entire
thing<00:02:55.700> into<00:02:56.700> your<00:02:56.970> shaker<00:02:57.650> leave<00:02:58.650> some<00:02:58.859> of<00:02:58.890> it

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
thing into your shaker leave some of it

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.130 
thing into your shaker leave some of it
left<00:03:01.940> and<00:03:02.940> now<00:03:03.060> we're<00:03:03.180> going<00:03:03.269> to<00:03:03.329> add<00:03:03.480> a<00:03:03.750> half

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
left and now we're going to add a half

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:17.809 
left and now we're going to add a half
ounce<00:03:04.349> of<00:03:04.739> Mayors<00:03:05.010> canola<00:03:05.459> cure<00:03:16.519> to<00:03:17.519> aid<00:03:17.640> the

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
ounce of Mayors canola cure to aid the

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:19.280 
ounce of Mayors canola cure to aid the
frothing<00:03:18.209> that<00:03:18.599> the<00:03:18.690> egg<00:03:18.810> whites<00:03:19.049> going<00:03:19.200> to

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
frothing that the egg whites going to

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:20.569 
frothing that the egg whites going to
bring<00:03:19.500> to<00:03:19.620> the<00:03:19.739> drink<00:03:20.010> you<00:03:20.280> don't<00:03:20.400> want<00:03:20.519> to

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
bring to the drink you don't want to

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:22.400 
bring to the drink you don't want to
take<00:03:20.700> and<00:03:20.880> shake<00:03:21.090> it<00:03:21.120> with<00:03:21.359> ice<00:03:21.540> to<00:03:21.870> begin<00:03:22.169> with

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
take and shake it with ice to begin with

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.589 
take and shake it with ice to begin with
because<00:03:22.950> the<00:03:23.220> ice<00:03:23.340> will<00:03:23.549> actually<00:03:24.060> prevent

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:24.599 
because the ice will actually prevent

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:26.300 
because the ice will actually prevent
the<00:03:24.780> foam<00:03:25.109> from<00:03:25.380> getting<00:03:25.680> the<00:03:25.799> the<00:03:26.069> most

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
the foam from getting the the most

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.039 
the foam from getting the the most
volume<00:03:26.730> it<00:03:26.819> can<00:03:27.000> you<00:03:27.359> want<00:03:27.510> to<00:03:27.569> shake<00:03:27.690> it<00:03:27.720> dry

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
volume it can you want to shake it dry

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:30.650 
volume it can you want to shake it dry
and<00:03:28.620> I<00:03:28.829> like<00:03:29.010> to<00:03:29.130> take<00:03:29.340> the<00:03:29.730> strainer<00:03:30.209> the

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
and I like to take the strainer the

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.270 
and I like to take the strainer the
spring<00:03:31.139> strainer<00:03:31.440> off<00:03:31.650> of<00:03:31.799> a<00:03:31.889> standard

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
spring strainer off of a standard

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.860 
spring strainer off of a standard
Hawthorne<00:03:32.669> strainer<00:03:32.819> and<00:03:33.239> just<00:03:33.540> put<00:03:33.720> that

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
Hawthorne strainer and just put that

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:40.879 
Hawthorne strainer and just put that
into<00:03:34.139> the<00:03:35.040> shaking<00:03:35.400> tin<00:03:39.230> and<00:03:40.230> now<00:03:40.560> comes<00:03:40.799> the

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:40.889 
into the shaking tin and now comes the

00:03:40.889 --> 00:04:00.830 
into the shaking tin and now comes the
fun<00:03:40.980> part

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.060 

what<00:04:01.840> you're<00:04:01.960> trying<00:04:02.050> to<00:04:02.200> do<00:04:02.290> here<00:04:02.500> is<00:04:02.650> whisk

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:03.070 
what you're trying to do here is whisk

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:05.430 
what you're trying to do here is whisk
the<00:04:03.610> egg<00:04:03.730> white<00:04:03.970> really<00:04:04.420> well<00:04:04.570> to<00:04:05.170> add<00:04:05.230> a<00:04:05.290> lot

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
the egg white really well to add a lot

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:06.810 
the egg white really well to add a lot
of<00:04:05.470> good<00:04:05.650> foam<00:04:05.830> to<00:04:06.040> it<00:04:06.130> so<00:04:06.220> it's<00:04:06.310> going<00:04:06.400> to<00:04:06.460> take

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:06.820 
of good foam to it so it's going to take

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:09.530 
of good foam to it so it's going to take
a<00:04:06.850> while<00:04:07.150> perhaps<00:04:07.600> a<00:04:07.780> lot<00:04:08.230> of<00:04:08.320> energy<00:04:08.650> involved

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
a while perhaps a lot of energy involved

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.610 
a while perhaps a lot of energy involved
and<00:04:10.540> a<00:04:10.600> good<00:04:10.750> work<00:04:10.900> helped<00:04:11.200> it<00:04:11.260> helped<00:04:11.440> burn

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
and a good work helped it helped burn

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:19.040 
and a good work helped it helped burn
some<00:04:11.800> of<00:04:11.890> those<00:04:11.950> calories

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:19.050
