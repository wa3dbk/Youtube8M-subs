00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
eventually will go for a dive yep it's

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.230 
eventually will go for a dive yep it's
how<00:03:50.410> he<00:03:50.470> capitalizes<00:03:51.130> on<00:03:51.370> small<00:03:51.700> stuff<00:03:52.030> like

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:52.240 
how he capitalizes on small stuff like

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.390 
how he capitalizes on small stuff like
this<00:03:52.420> you<00:03:52.630> know<00:03:52.750> it's<00:03:53.140> like<00:03:53.290> a<00:03:53.560> lot<00:03:54.310> of

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
this you know it's like a lot of

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.980 
this you know it's like a lot of
Northmen<00:03:54.790> maybe<00:03:55.090> a<00:03:55.180> north<00:03:55.390> american<00:03:55.420> jungler

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:55.990 
Northmen maybe a north american jungler

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:57.449 
Northmen maybe a north american jungler
or<00:03:56.200> european<00:03:56.680> journal<00:03:56.800> would<00:03:57.010> have<00:03:57.100> done<00:03:57.280> this

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
or european journal would have done this

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:59.100 
or european journal would have done this
play<00:03:57.700> where<00:03:57.940> he<00:03:57.970> jumped<00:03:58.480> between<00:03:58.600> those<00:03:58.870> two

00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.110 
play where he jumped between those two

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:00.510 
play where he jumped between those two
words<00:03:59.290> where<00:03:59.500> there's<00:03:59.680> just<00:03:59.860> this<00:03:59.950> pocket<00:04:00.430> of

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:00.520

cognizance to know actually we can kill
their<00:04:04.750> mid<00:04:04.900> laner<00:04:05.080> well<00:04:05.410> it's<00:04:05.620> just<00:04:05.830> another

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
their mid laner well it's just another

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.820 
their mid laner well it's just another
example<00:04:06.550> of<00:04:07.060> him<00:04:07.240> thinking<00:04:07.840> like<00:04:08.050> three<00:04:08.530> moves

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830

ahead<00:04:09.040> on<00:04:09.430> the<00:04:09.550> chessboard<00:04:09.850> like<00:04:10.360> we<00:04:10.510> saw

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690 
ahead on the chessboard like we saw

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.449 
ahead on the chessboard like we saw
earlier<00:04:11.170> he's<00:04:11.650> able<00:04:11.830> to<00:04:11.980> predict<00:04:12.340> these

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
earlier he's able to predict these

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:13.949 
earlier he's able to predict these
movements<00:04:12.760> and<00:04:13.060> he's<00:04:13.180> able<00:04:13.270> to<00:04:13.450> capitalize<00:04:13.930> on

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 
movements and he's able to capitalize on

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:15.690 
movements and he's able to capitalize on
