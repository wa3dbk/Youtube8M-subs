00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.950
 Hello, my dear, glad that you 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.460
 again went to my channel and watch it 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:11.550
 video this video I already promised you a long time 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.960
 and in it I will tell about the morning pages 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:19.529
 I don't mention often enough and for sure 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:22.560
 in the morning about my morning you saw mine 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.720
 this notebook in which I write morning 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.390
 pages 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:32.450
 every morning at breakfast or even the house is not 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:41.790
 getting out of bed I open this notebook 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:44.010
 show you how it looks inside here here 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:50.730
 on top 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:51.840
 I write the date the day of the week and start 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.430
 fill 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:01:00.000
 one sheet is completely in such small print 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:04.379
 I fill a whole sheet of this notebook 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:09.090
 this notebook every morning in fact 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:12.240
 I began to do this probably more than two 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.310
 years ago that's exactly when we met 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.979
 book and julie cameron the artist's path 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.520
 there in the first chapters it is detailed like 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.080
 describe what morning pages are 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:25.049
 as I understand what morning is 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.270
 page someone calls them like i already 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:30.979
 I repeat the morning pages many times 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:33.720
 someone calls them freeriting ie 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:39.150
 free letter someone calls it 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:40.860
 Marani paper is basically the essence of what 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.790
 same is its rating or morning 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.829
 pages 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:49.100
 it is such a kind of meditation that is 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:52.409
 we are waking up in the morning 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:55.920
 just lay out on paper write out 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:59.460
 all your emotions all your thoughts are rude 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.890
 saying free our head from what 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.950
 then garbage from some things that 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.640
 there will be some 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.410
 ideas 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.739
 just open a clean sheet take a pen 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:15.450
 and start writing what you will describe 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:19.000
 it is absolutely not important the main thing to fill 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:23.170
 in general actually in julie's book 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.480
 cameron she talks about three A4 sheets 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.760
 but if you write here for example notebooks 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:31.810
 cage then one sheet is about as much 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:35.379
 whatever you get 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:38.560
 mood to dream about in me 

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:40.720
 you are ideas of some kind of creative people 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.810
 if some idea from the body in the head she 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:46.510
 does not rest she constantly turns there 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:49.030
 she reminds of herself and while you go where 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:52.269
 you will not write down and throw out this idea 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.110
 she will be there spinning and proper 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:58.629
 saying get in the way 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:03:01.450
 creating new ideas what how do I share 

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:04.900
 for example, I just write the text and now if 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:07.150
 you can see the red with the red pen i 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:10.359
 I highlight just 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:13.049
 or ideas you need to remember and 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:17.400
 pay attention to them or some 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:17.400
 tasks that I later come from 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:23.230
 rewrite my diary or 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.269
 for example, some important things and 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.840
 I remember and write down here later 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:30.099
 stand it 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:33.419
 diary but basically it's just mine 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:36.099
 morning emotions like i 

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:39.519
 woke up there sign of a bad mood 

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:42.340
 what does it bother me what is in my head 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:45.099
 maybe something I dreamed and but 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:48.099
 sometimes when I want to remember 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:50.440
 some kind of dream i also take it in 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:53.280
 the morning pages actually this here 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:57.959
 how for me it became like a morning wash 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:04:00.970
 that is, I open the notebook I just 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:03.669
 mechanically automatically as 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:06.190
 says free letter free 

00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:11.109
 form just fill in the pages and 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:13.800
 clear my brain for new ideas for 

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:16.470
 new perception that was the place 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:19.290
 something new get something from this 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:23.040
 of the day but don't forget her any 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:25.650
 reaching the old is not a personal diary 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:29.840
 that is , you donâ€™t need it here , so I think 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:32.430
 that for me I do not write down any 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:38.010
 life incident some emotions 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:39.990
 No, here I am recording exactly my kind 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:42.420
 creative ideas and everything related to 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:44.690
 creativity that is just for 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:48.450
 creative people it seems to me 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:50.460
 the best way to understand yourself is to understand 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:52.020
 what do you really think you are 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:56.040
 feel what you want from life 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:58.200
 see some goals say they don't 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:00.840
 need to reread the morning pages in 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:02.670
 within three months passed and morning 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:05.610
 I have not reread the pages for about a year 

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:09.060
 and that's just the beginning of this year I decided 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:12.870
 reread them and when i start them 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:13.650
 read and I realized that a lot of things 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:16.050
 has changed 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:19.669
 it is my internal state she 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:23.280
 become much better much fresher 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:24.050
 that if I cleared some some 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.850
 husk 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:31.430
 for your consciousness thanks to this 

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:35.310
 morning pages so i see in this 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:38.250
 how would a positive impact on your 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:42.510
 emotional state on your 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:44.640
 performance and of course sometimes I 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:47.940
 wake up and think yes why do i need it 

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:50.970
 need it all this garbage I don't need this 

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:52.680
 waste of time is better i will sleep but i 

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:55.890
 I understand what's inside me talking my 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:58.460
 inner center which of course 

00:05:55.890 --> 00:06:01.950
 likes to just lie on the couch and talk 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:05.070
 what I am and how awful my terrible 

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:06.720
 creativity that nobody needs it 

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:09.690
 nobody wants to look at nobody 

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:11.460
 wants to listen to it all terrible at the very 

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:15.000
 I really have no talent and so 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:20.220
 further but if i give in here 

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:23.080
 these here near the water of my censor 

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:25.740
 Of course I can not achieve anything 

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:28.479
 I would not do what I do now 

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:29.139
 so here is my opinion about you not 

00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:31.930
 pages 

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:34.930
 if you are interested in learning more about them 

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:37.330
 you can just find a book on the internet 

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:40.240
 julie camera download and more 

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:45.819
 read or can type in 

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:48.759
 search word autofocus or 

00:06:45.819 --> 00:06:50.379
 freeriting and the same more intelligent 

00:06:48.759 --> 00:06:52.840
 I will tell you what it is 

00:06:50.379 --> 00:06:55.650
 thank you very much for your attention everyone 

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:55.650
 good luck everyone bye
