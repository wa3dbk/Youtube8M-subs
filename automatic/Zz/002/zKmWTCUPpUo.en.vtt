course<00:00:45.120> I<00:00:45.300> have<00:00:45.450> to<00:00:45.480> have<00:00:45.660> my<00:00:45.780> Chili<00:00:46.079> Peppers<00:00:47.030> I

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
course I have to have my Chili Peppers I

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.040 
course I have to have my Chili Peppers I
score<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.930> fish<00:00:49.140> by<00:00:49.289> making<00:00:49.590> two<00:00:49.770> cuts<00:00:50.100> on

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
score the fish by making two cuts on

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.639 
score the fish by making two cuts on
both<00:00:52.050> sides<00:00:52.469> of<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:53.789> fish<00:00:54.149> and<00:00:54.660> that<00:00:55.379> just

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
both sides of the fish and that just

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.090 
both sides of the fish and that just
helps<00:00:56.010> with<00:00:56.570> making<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:58.230> steaming<00:00:58.530> process<00:00:58.800> a

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
helps with making the steaming process a

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.880 
helps with making the steaming process a
little<00:00:59.280> faster<00:01:00.980> and<00:01:01.980> here<00:01:02.250> I<00:01:02.309> add<00:01:03.890> vegetable

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
little faster and here I add vegetable

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.910 
little faster and here I add vegetable
oil<00:01:04.920> I<00:01:05.810> just<00:01:06.810> realized<00:01:07.170> I<00:01:07.290> did<00:01:07.500> not<00:01:07.650> put<00:01:07.830> any

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
oil I just realized I did not put any

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.130 
oil I just realized I did not put any
garlic<00:01:08.460> in<00:01:09.619> sherry<00:01:10.619> cooking<00:01:10.830> wine<00:01:11.040> I<00:01:12.140> guess

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
garlic in sherry cooking wine I guess

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.940 
garlic in sherry cooking wine I guess
the<00:01:13.260> reason<00:01:13.439> is<00:01:13.710> because<00:01:14.040> my<00:01:14.670> mom<00:01:14.880> never<00:01:15.950> when

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
the reason is because my mom never when

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.590 
the reason is because my mom never when
she<00:01:17.130> made<00:01:17.280> it<00:01:17.430> never<00:01:17.729> put<00:01:17.909> any<00:01:18.060> garlic<00:01:18.420> on<00:01:18.570> it

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
she made it never put any garlic on it

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:25.820 
she made it never put any garlic on it
so<00:01:19.939> soy<00:01:20.939> sauce

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.990 

and<00:01:25.950> on<00:01:26.760> top<00:01:27.030> of<00:01:27.060> that<00:01:27.240> goes<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:28.790> ginger<00:01:29.790> and

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
and on top of that goes the ginger and

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.440 
and on top of that goes the ginger and
the<00:01:30.060> hot<00:01:30.570> chili<00:01:30.840> peppers<00:01:31.260> I<00:01:31.910> guess<00:01:32.910> the<00:01:33.090> ginger

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
the hot chili peppers I guess the ginger

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.290 
the hot chili peppers I guess the ginger
the<00:01:33.480> peppers<00:01:34.020> mix<00:01:34.320> made<00:01:35.250> up<00:01:35.400> for<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:36.060> lack<00:01:36.270> of

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:36.300 
the peppers mix made up for the lack of

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.130 
the peppers mix made up for the lack of
garlic<00:01:37.310> here<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.490> water<00:01:38.670> is<00:01:38.790> boiling<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:39.510> my

garlic here the water is boiling and my

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.840 
garlic here the water is boiling and my
double<00:01:40.410> boiler<00:01:40.650> can<00:01:40.950> only<00:01:41.100> accommodate<00:01:41.460> one

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
double boiler can only accommodate one

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.900 
double boiler can only accommodate one
fish<00:01:42.180> at<00:01:42.390> a<00:01:42.420> time<00:01:42.590> and<00:01:43.590> I<00:01:44.220> put<00:01:44.430> an<00:01:44.520> upside-down

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:06.510 
looking at the ice it's gone from black

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.169 
looking at the ice it's gone from black
to<00:02:06.540> white<00:02:06.990> and<00:02:07.260> also<00:02:07.980> you<00:02:08.250> can<00:02:08.550> put<00:02:08.820> the

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
to white and also you can put the

to white and also you can put the
chopstick<00:02:09.840> through<00:02:10.200> and<00:02:10.530> it<00:02:11.070> becomes<00:02:11.400> so

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
chopstick through and it becomes so

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.230 
chopstick through and it becomes so
clean<00:02:11.940> then<00:02:12.690> it's<00:02:13.380> done<00:02:13.680> also<00:02:14.640> you<00:02:14.700> can<00:02:15.060> look

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240

clean then it's done also you can look
at<00:02:15.450> the<00:02:15.600> mean<00:02:15.840> if<00:02:16.080> it<00:02:16.890> turned<00:02:17.190> from<00:02:17.310> a

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
at the mean if it turned from a

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.510 
at the mean if it turned from a
