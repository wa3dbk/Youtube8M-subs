00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.100 
threaded bolt that goes in and you can
put<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:20.759> safety<00:01:21.450> pin<00:01:21.689> on<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.869> other<00:01:21.960> side

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
put a safety pin on the other side

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.710 
put a safety pin on the other side
tighten<00:01:23.070> this<00:01:23.130> down<00:01:23.189> and<00:01:23.670> it<00:01:24.000> basically<00:01:24.150> makes

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
pull them down flat and then we can fold

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.780 

to<00:02:08.080> install<00:02:08.350> some<00:02:08.560> bikes<00:02:08.770> first<00:02:09.310> off<00:02:09.550> we<00:02:09.729> need

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:09.790 
to install some bikes first off we need

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:11.760 
to install some bikes first off we need
to<00:02:09.940> loosen<00:02:10.420> posts<00:02:11.050> so<00:02:11.140> we<00:02:11.230> can<00:02:11.350> fold<00:02:11.530> them<00:02:11.650> up

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
to loosen posts so we can fold them up

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.170 
to loosen posts so we can fold them up
into<00:02:12.070> the<00:02:12.220> up<00:02:12.340> position<00:02:12.490> and<00:02:14.280> then<00:02:15.280> probably<00:02:16.150> a

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
into the up position and then probably a

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.580 
into the up position and then probably a
good<00:02:16.270> idea<00:02:16.360> to<00:02:16.570> go<00:02:16.900> ahead<00:02:16.990> and<00:02:17.140> just<00:02:17.230> take<00:02:17.380> off

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
good idea to go ahead and just take off

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.570 
good idea to go ahead and just take off
these<00:02:17.770> cradles<00:02:19.890> all<00:02:20.890> right<00:02:21.010> next<00:02:21.190> we<00:02:21.340> need<00:02:21.430> to

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
these cradles all right next we need to

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.350 
these cradles all right next we need to
take<00:02:21.910> off<00:02:22.030> our<00:02:22.180> straps<00:02:22.450> and<00:02:22.660> get<00:02:22.810> them<00:02:22.960> ready

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
take off our straps and get them ready

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.700 
take off our straps and get them ready
now<00:02:25.360> you<00:02:25.450> also<00:02:25.600> have<00:02:25.720> to<00:02:25.900> make<00:02:26.050> adjustments<00:02:26.170> to

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:26.710 
now you also have to make adjustments to

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.550 
now you also have to make adjustments to
the<00:02:26.860> wheel<00:02:27.400> holders<00:02:27.820> too<00:02:28.060> just<00:02:28.360> in<00:02:28.450> case

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
the wheel holders too just in case

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.300 
the wheel holders too just in case
because<00:02:29.560> all<00:02:29.650> bikes<00:02:29.890> are<00:02:29.980> a<00:02:30.040> little<00:02:30.160> bit

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
because all bikes are a little bit

because all bikes are a little bit
different<00:02:30.520> you<00:02:31.060> go<00:02:31.300> ahead<00:02:31.420> and<00:02:31.510> loosen<00:02:31.690> it

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040
