so<00:00:06.299> what<00:00:06.420> we're<00:00:06.540> gonna<00:00:06.629> do<00:00:06.839> is<00:00:06.930> we're<00:00:07.020> gonna

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
so what we're gonna do is we're gonna

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.490 
so what we're gonna do is we're gonna
have<00:00:07.200> a<00:00:07.319> look<00:00:07.589> at<00:00:07.799> our<00:00:07.830> crosswind<00:00:08.730> assist<00:00:09.090> and

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:09.500 
have a look at our crosswind assist and

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.290 
have a look at our crosswind assist and
this<00:00:10.500> is<00:00:10.679> a<00:00:10.710> 2015<00:00:11.400> van<00:00:11.670> the<00:00:11.880> van<00:00:11.910> that<00:00:12.179> I'm

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
this is a 2015 van the van that I'm

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.660 
this is a 2015 van the van that I'm
gonna<00:00:12.450> be<00:00:12.570> chasing<00:00:12.840> is<00:00:13.200> a<00:00:13.230> 2014<00:00:13.860> van<00:00:14.309> now<00:00:14.519> with

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
gonna be chasing is a 2014 van now with

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.990 
gonna be chasing is a 2014 van now with
the<00:00:14.759> 2014<00:00:15.269> van<00:00:15.809> the<00:00:16.740> ESP<00:00:17.279> system<00:00:17.460> can<00:00:17.850> detect

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
the 2014 van the ESP system can detect

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.300 
the 2014 van the ESP system can detect
yaw<00:00:18.600> so<00:00:19.020> rotation<00:00:19.500> this<00:00:19.890> way<00:00:20.070> which<00:00:20.279> is

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
yaw so rotation this way which is

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.330 
yaw so rotation this way which is
understeer<00:00:20.939> and<00:00:21.150> oversteer<00:00:21.480> and<00:00:22.260> when<00:00:23.070> we<00:00:23.189> get

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
understeer and oversteer and when we get

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.279 
understeer and oversteer and when we get
into<00:00:23.550> an<00:00:23.640> understeer<00:00:24.029> or<00:00:24.060> oversteer

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:24.289 
into an understeer or oversteer

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:26.870 
into an understeer or oversteer
situation<00:00:25.289> we<00:00:25.410> can<00:00:25.560> apply<00:00:25.800> brakes<00:00:26.130> to<00:00:26.369> one<00:00:26.730> of

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
situation we can apply brakes to one of

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.609 
situation we can apply brakes to one of
the<00:00:27.000> wheels<00:00:27.210> either<00:00:27.539> a<00:00:27.720> front<00:00:28.109> or<00:00:28.260> rear<00:00:28.590> wheel

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
the wheels either a front or rear wheel

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.950 
the wheels either a front or rear wheel
depending<00:00:29.310> on<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.490> skipped<00:00:29.789> over<00:00:30.029> here<00:00:30.210> so

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
depending on the skipped over here so

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.479 
depending on the skipped over here so
now<00:00:31.080> moving<00:00:31.439> to<00:00:31.590> this<00:00:31.710> van<00:00:31.949> where<00:00:32.189> we're<00:00:32.340> at

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
now moving to this van where we're at

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.520 
now moving to this van where we're at
2015<00:00:33.120> van<00:00:33.360> where<00:00:33.660> we<00:00:33.780> have<00:00:33.899> two<00:00:34.079> standard

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
2015 van where we have two standard

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.770 
2015 van where we have two standard
crosswind<00:00:35.010> assist<00:00:35.399> and<00:00:36.149> what<00:00:36.329> we've<00:00:36.450> done<00:00:36.630> is

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
crosswind assist and what we've done is

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.530 
crosswind assist and what we've done is
we've<00:00:36.989> recalibrated<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:38.070> yaw<00:00:38.280> sensor<00:00:38.879> so

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
we've recalibrated the yaw sensor so

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.080 
we've recalibrated the yaw sensor so
that<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.750> yaw<00:00:39.960> sensor<00:00:40.440> can<00:00:40.620> measure<00:00:41.090> lateral

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
that the yaw sensor can measure lateral

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.720 
that the yaw sensor can measure lateral
movement<00:00:42.570> this<00:00:42.780> way<00:00:43.020> or<00:00:43.350> this<00:00:43.710> way<00:00:43.770> so<00:00:44.579> when

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
movement this way or this way so when

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.250 
movement this way or this way so when
the<00:00:44.820> vehicle<00:00:45.210> is<00:00:45.239> moving<00:00:45.300> this<00:00:45.750> way

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
the vehicle is moving this way

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.200 
the vehicle is moving this way
what<00:00:46.620> will<00:00:46.770> happen<00:00:47.129> is<00:00:47.250> won't<00:00:47.460> fly<00:00:47.640> brakes<00:00:47.969> -

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
what will happen is won't fly brakes -

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.600 
what will happen is won't fly brakes -
two<00:00:48.450> of<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.660> wheels<00:00:48.930> on<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.980> side<00:00:50.219> where<00:00:50.489> it's

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
two of the wheels on the side where it's

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.040 
two of the wheels on the side where it's
coming<00:00:50.879> from<00:00:51.030> so<00:00:51.270> if<00:00:51.480> it's<00:00:51.600> coming<00:00:51.809> this

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
coming from so if it's coming this

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.170 
coming from so if it's coming this
direction<00:00:52.199> we<00:00:52.649> apply<00:00:52.890> brakes<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.370> this<00:00:53.489> these

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
direction we apply brakes to this these

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.310 
direction we apply brakes to this these
two<00:00:54.360> wheels<00:00:54.570> so<00:00:54.719> it's<00:00:54.870> going<00:00:55.020> that<00:00:55.199> direction

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
two wheels so it's going that direction

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.920 
two wheels so it's going that direction
we<00:00:55.710> apply<00:00:55.949> brakes<00:00:56.219> to<00:00:56.370> these<00:00:56.550> two<00:00:56.789> wheels<00:00:57.059> and

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
we apply brakes to these two wheels and

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.479 
we apply brakes to these two wheels and
what<00:00:58.140> that<00:00:58.289> does<00:00:58.469> is<00:00:58.620> it<00:00:58.770> keeps<00:00:58.920> us<00:00:59.160> in<00:00:59.340> our

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
what that does is it keeps us in our

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.900 
what that does is it keeps us in our
lane<00:00:59.670> now<00:01:00.800> here's<00:01:01.800> our<00:01:01.949> challenge<00:01:02.219> crosswind

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
lane now here's our challenge crosswind

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.880 
lane now here's our challenge crosswind
assist<00:01:03.300> is<00:01:03.449> something<00:01:03.809> that<00:01:03.930> happens<00:01:04.379> above

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
assist is something that happens above

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.950 
assist is something that happens above
50<00:01:05.400> miles<00:01:05.700> an<00:01:05.850> hour<00:01:05.970> so<00:01:06.299> I<00:01:06.330> need<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:06.689> get<00:01:06.840> the

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
50 miles an hour so I need to get the

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.350 
50 miles an hour so I need to get the
speed<00:01:07.229> up<00:01:07.409> to<00:01:07.979> just<00:01:08.189> above<00:01:08.430> 50<00:01:08.820> miles<00:01:09.030> an<00:01:09.240> hour

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
speed up to just above 50 miles an hour

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.149 
speed up to just above 50 miles an hour
and<00:01:10.049> we're<00:01:10.229> gonna<00:01:10.320> be<00:01:10.500> driving<00:01:10.710> through<00:01:11.010> the

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
and we're gonna be driving through the

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.740 
and we're gonna be driving through the
fans<00:01:11.400> over<00:01:11.640> there<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.119> those<00:01:12.270> fans<00:01:12.540> are<00:01:12.689> gonna

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
fans over there and those fans are gonna

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.870 
fans over there and those fans are gonna
be<00:01:12.990> pushing<00:01:13.710> out<00:01:13.950> wings<00:01:14.250> somewhere<00:01:14.640> between

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
be pushing out wings somewhere between

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.679 
be pushing out wings somewhere between
90<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:15.570> 100<00:01:16.049> miles<00:01:16.380> an<00:01:16.619> hour<00:01:17.390> probably<00:01:18.390> not<00:01:18.659> a

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
90 and 100 miles an hour probably not a

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.330 
90 and 100 miles an hour probably not a
scenario<00:01:19.080> you're<00:01:19.500> gonna<00:01:19.619> run<00:01:19.860> into<00:01:19.890> very

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
scenario you're gonna run into very

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.980 
scenario you're gonna run into very
often<00:01:20.729> but<00:01:20.850> it's<00:01:20.970> really<00:01:21.119> a<00:01:21.240> graphic<00:01:21.780> way<00:01:21.930> to

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
often but it's really a graphic way to

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.190 
often but it's really a graphic way to
demonstrate<00:01:22.610> how<00:01:23.610> this<00:01:23.880> system<00:01:24.119> works<00:01:24.330> the

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
demonstrate how this system works the

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.929 
demonstrate how this system works the
red<00:01:25.380> van<00:01:25.590> in<00:01:25.770> front<00:01:25.799> of<00:01:26.040> me<00:01:26.189> will<00:01:26.580> not<00:01:26.759> have

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
red van in front of me will not have

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.310 
red van in front of me will not have
cross<00:01:27.180> when<00:01:27.390> this<00:01:27.540> is<00:01:27.689> so<00:01:27.840> you're<00:01:27.990> gonna<00:01:28.080> see

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
cross when this is so you're gonna see

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.870 
cross when this is so you're gonna see
as<00:01:28.439> we<00:01:28.560> go<00:01:28.680> through<00:01:28.950> that<00:01:29.130> red<00:01:29.340> van<00:01:29.520> is<00:01:29.700> gonna

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
as we go through that red van is gonna

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.160 
as we go through that red van is gonna
come<00:01:30.090> through<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.390> wind<00:01:30.600> is<00:01:30.689> gonna<00:01:30.840> hit<00:01:31.049> it

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
come through the wind is gonna hit it

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.630 
come through the wind is gonna hit it
and<00:01:31.259> it's<00:01:31.439> gonna<00:01:31.560> move<00:01:31.829> something<00:01:32.220> like<00:01:32.340> this

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
and it's gonna move something like this

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.730 
and it's gonna move something like this
where<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.000> back<00:01:33.240> of<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.540> van<00:01:33.720> gets<00:01:34.470> pushed

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
where the back of the van gets pushed

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.100 
where the back of the van gets pushed
out<00:01:35.180> when<00:01:36.180> we<00:01:36.329> come<00:01:36.540> through<00:01:36.570> all<00:01:36.930> you're

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
out when we come through all you're

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.469 
out when we come through all you're
gonna<00:01:37.200> feel<00:01:37.500> is<00:01:37.560> a<00:01:37.979> very<00:01:38.759> little<00:01:39.210> bit<00:01:39.390> of

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
gonna feel is a very little bit of

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.210 
gonna feel is a very little bit of
motion<00:01:39.960> this<00:01:40.110> way<00:01:40.350> and<00:01:40.590> that's<00:01:40.740> really<00:01:40.950> the

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
motion this way and that's really the

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.090 
motion this way and that's really the
system<00:01:41.729> keeping<00:01:42.479> us<00:01:42.689> in<00:01:42.869> mind<00:01:43.140> you<00:01:43.710> guys<00:01:43.860> ready

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
system keeping us in mind you guys ready

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.069 
system keeping us in mind you guys ready
to<00:01:44.250> go<00:01:44.399> so<00:01:45.180> we're<00:01:45.270> gonna<00:01:45.390> come<00:01:45.600> around<00:01:45.720> this

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
to go so we're gonna come around this

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.260 
to go so we're gonna come around this
corner<00:01:46.439> here<00:01:46.799> at<00:01:46.920> 40<00:01:47.250> miles<00:01:47.430> an<00:01:47.700> hour<00:01:47.820> and<00:01:48.180> I

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
corner here at 40 miles an hour and I

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.880 
corner here at 40 miles an hour and I
think<00:01:48.360> you'll<00:01:48.720> be<00:01:48.780> quite<00:01:49.140> impressed<00:01:49.170> with<00:01:49.649> how

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
think you'll be quite impressed with how

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.080 
think you'll be quite impressed with how
well<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.310> Sprinter<00:01:50.640> holds<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.090> road

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
well the Sprinter holds the road

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.060 
well the Sprinter holds the road
so<00:01:53.659> we're<00:01:53.810> coming<00:01:53.930> up<00:01:54.170> to<00:01:54.229> the<00:01:54.350> crosswinds

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
so we're coming up to the crosswinds

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.490 
so we're coming up to the crosswinds
here<00:01:55.280> and<00:01:55.490> those<00:01:55.610> boats<00:01:56.119> are<00:01:56.390> moving<00:01:56.869> Eretz

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
here and those boats are moving Eretz

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:03.429 
here and those boats are moving Eretz
100<00:01:58.340> miles<00:01:58.549> an<00:01:58.759> hour<00:02:00.430> and<00:02:01.430> you<00:02:01.670> could<00:02:01.850> see<00:02:02.439> the

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 
100 miles an hour and you could see the

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:06.039 
100 miles an hour and you could see the
red<00:02:03.680> van<00:02:03.979> as<00:02:04.880> we<00:02:05.119> came<00:02:05.329> through<00:02:05.509> was<00:02:05.720> moving

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049 
red van as we came through was moving

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:08.050 
red van as we came through was moving
over<00:02:06.170> laterally<00:02:06.890> and<00:02:07.130> we<00:02:07.430> managed<00:02:07.789> to<00:02:07.909> just

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
over laterally and we managed to just

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.540 
over laterally and we managed to just
continue<00:02:08.539> in<00:02:08.690> a<00:02:08.780> straight<00:02:09.050> line<00:02:09.250> so<00:02:10.250> where

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
continue in a straight line so where

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.309 
continue in a straight line so where
does<00:02:10.670> cross<00:02:10.910> witnesses<00:02:11.450> come<00:02:11.660> from<00:02:11.870> why<00:02:12.050> do<00:02:12.110> we

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
does cross witnesses come from why do we

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:15.040 
does cross witnesses come from why do we
have<00:02:12.530> it<00:02:12.560> within<00:02:12.920> our<00:02:13.160> vehicles<00:02:13.700> the<00:02:14.660> question

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
have it within our vehicles the question

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.170 
have it within our vehicles the question
I<00:02:15.170> get<00:02:15.440> often<00:02:15.739> is<00:02:16.099> so<00:02:16.400> does<00:02:16.700> that<00:02:16.730> mean<00:02:17.000> that

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
I get often is so does that mean that

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.690 
I get often is so does that mean that
your<00:02:17.620> 2014<00:02:18.620> and<00:02:18.800> earlier<00:02:19.040> sprinters<00:02:19.550> are

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
your 2014 and earlier sprinters are

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.140 
your 2014 and earlier sprinters are
dangerous<00:02:20.269> and<00:02:20.480> really<00:02:20.690> they're<00:02:20.840> not<00:02:22.150> you

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
dangerous and really they're not you

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:24.970 
dangerous and really they're not you
know<00:02:23.180> we<00:02:23.390> saw<00:02:23.569> that<00:02:23.720> the<00:02:23.840> red<00:02:23.959> van<00:02:24.200> obviously

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
know we saw that the red van obviously

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.650 
know we saw that the red van obviously
didn't<00:02:25.250> tip<00:02:25.459> over<00:02:25.640> yeah<00:02:26.000> it<00:02:26.120> moved<00:02:26.330> over<00:02:26.480> a

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
didn't tip over yeah it moved over a

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.050 
didn't tip over yeah it moved over a
little<00:02:26.840> bit<00:02:27.080> but<00:02:27.140> how<00:02:27.860> often<00:02:28.069> do<00:02:28.340> we<00:02:28.459> see<00:02:28.610> a<00:02:28.640> 90

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
little bit but how often do we see a 90

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.630 
little bit but how often do we see a 90
mile<00:02:29.569> an<00:02:29.600> hour<00:02:29.840> cross<00:02:30.260> wings<00:02:30.620> so<00:02:31.370> in<00:02:31.519> this

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
mile an hour cross wings so in this

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.580 
mile an hour cross wings so in this
scenario<00:02:31.880> here<00:02:32.690> we<00:02:33.080> were<00:02:33.200> able<00:02:33.290> to<00:02:33.470> go

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
scenario here we were able to go

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.170 
scenario here we were able to go
straight<00:02:34.100> through<00:02:34.160> it<00:02:34.459> so<00:02:34.730> that's<00:02:34.880> ready<00:02:35.030> to

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
straight through it so that's ready to

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.030 
straight through it so that's ready to
the<00:02:35.569> safety<00:02:35.959> feature<00:02:36.200> but<00:02:36.620> it's<00:02:36.709> just<00:02:36.799> another

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
the safety feature but it's just another

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.160 
the safety feature but it's just another
functionality<00:02:37.670> that<00:02:38.480> we've<00:02:38.660> put<00:02:38.930> in<00:02:39.019> our

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
functionality that we've put in our

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.160 
functionality that we've put in our
adaptive<00:02:39.650> ESB
