really<00:00:24.640> is<00:00:24.730> quite<00:00:24.910> amazing<00:00:25.870> for<00:00:26.590> the<00:00:26.680> fact<00:00:26.890> is

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:27.130 
really is quite amazing for the fact is

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.510 
really is quite amazing for the fact is
that<00:00:27.340> it<00:00:27.460> is<00:00:27.610> different<00:00:28.090> to<00:00:28.330> the<00:00:29.280> speed<00:00:30.280> and

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:30.520 
that it is different to the speed and

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.130 
that it is different to the speed and
but<00:00:30.940> you<00:00:31.090> need<00:00:31.270> to<00:00:31.420> drive<00:00:31.630> the<00:00:31.750> car<00:00:31.930> really

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:32.140 
but you need to drive the car really

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:33.900 
but you need to drive the car really
