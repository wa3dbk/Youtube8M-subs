00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.840

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.810
 I say it because they are where you as 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.140
 there are some girls and I know it's the 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.880
 another favorite is the mustang so what 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.790
 what we are going to do today is to paint a 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.290
 pink mustang with what now 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.530
 he has been painting me 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.240
 the cars of hot wheels racing thing that 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.410
 I like it a lot so we're starting 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.410
 with this that goes for long 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:41.730
 now a little remover 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.730
 LOL 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:46.210
 oh, my God 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.720
 now a little water 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.390
 great i love this 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:01.380
 and this our next step is to put 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.380
 the 1st 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:12.240
 now a little wind and sun paint 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.240
 Blanca is sponsored by the fight 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.540
 since we have our white paint 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:21.739
 we have to let dry approximately 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:25.400
 an hour in the sun very well now using 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:27.380
 a little tape 3m we are going to put 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.800
 cover the parts 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:34.290
 that we want them to always be white 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:36.480
 taking care of the edges very well 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.519
 well the curb was already in fourth 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.709
 that's what a line should be 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:43.799
 take good care of these shores here so that 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:46.480
 we do not filter the same paint here 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:49.840
 I have my ribbon 3 cm 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:52.540
 that nobody pays me for sponsorship 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.870
 and so I'll just accommodating should 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:58.440
 teach and curb 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:01.730
 or just that they want to see me doing it on 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.730
 obviously curb 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.180
 for less we mark the edges I'm 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.180
 doing pure calculation 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:18.380
 and when you discover that things are 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:21.170
 bad I'm not going to do 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:24.050
 the truth that the sitting process is 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:26.060
 something complicated doing the lines and 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:28.670
 making it look good is very very difficult 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.110
 but with patience you can also there 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:33.530
 to take into account that if we do not 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:35.690
 well since all our work will be known 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.850
 that will have been in hand and we will have to 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:41.060
 unseal so now the process follows 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:43.550
 of good pink paint does not pass is a 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.910
 metallic nvidia let's see what goes through 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:45.910
 here 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:01.650
 one more hour of drying and removing the 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.090
 ribbons increases building that was 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.950
 recording and I started to remove the tapes 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:08.470
 good 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:11.650
 good that this should already be dry 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:14.340
 all here remove the tape with a lot 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.340
 watch out 

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:39.710
 in the awning 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:53.400
 now with my decals you already know 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:57.830
 lime is not coming back from cold paper 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.830
 let's cut out my logos 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:02.850
 with my kindergarten scissors 

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:12.250
 well I have already cut my 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:14.750
 decals is millionaire on each side 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:18.569
 I already have ready at the base through the 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:20.339
 mustang really was great 

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:23.089
 Now what we need is a bit of 

00:05:20.339 --> 00:05:23.089
 white gasoline 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:27.120
 a container 

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:33.280
 and I 

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:36.150
 when I 'm not like you do not stop 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:39.569
 engineer them to record by myself 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:42.589

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:42.589

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:49.110

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:54.220
 and arrange it with your finger 

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:06.170

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:06.170

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:38.440

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:45.010
