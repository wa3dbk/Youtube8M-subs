straight up in the air let it go and

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:16.839 
straight up in the air let it go and
then<00:05:15.349> catch<00:05:15.650> the<00:05:15.860> top<00:05:16.099> with<00:05:16.280> your<00:05:16.400> hand<00:05:16.669> and

00:05:16.839 --> 00:05:16.849 
then catch the top with your hand and

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:19.330 
then catch the top with your hand and
come<00:05:17.389> down<00:05:17.630> you<00:05:18.409> can<00:05:18.440> do<00:05:18.680> it<00:05:18.770> with<00:05:18.889> either<00:05:18.919> hand

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:19.340 
come down you can do it with either hand

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:21.820 
come down you can do it with either hand
but<00:05:20.270> I'll<00:05:20.389> show<00:05:20.569> the<00:05:20.750> application<00:05:20.960> in<00:05:21.530> which<00:05:21.710> I

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:21.830 
but I'll show the application in which I
