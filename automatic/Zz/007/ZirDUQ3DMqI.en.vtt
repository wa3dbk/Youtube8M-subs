00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
thoughts on pot of avarice things can go

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.870 
thoughts on pot of avarice things can go
out<00:01:49.530> of<00:01:49.770> hand<00:01:49.950> once<00:01:50.189> in<00:01:50.310> a<00:01:50.340> while<00:01:50.490> though<00:01:50.670> so

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
out of hand once in a while though so

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.639 
out of hand once in a while though so
it's<00:01:51.000> not<00:01:51.149> always<00:01:51.360> like<00:01:51.509> that<00:01:51.659> but<00:01:52.439> for<00:01:52.560> the

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
it's not always like that but for the

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.499 
it's not always like that but for the
most<00:01:52.770> part<00:01:52.920> I<00:01:53.220> just<00:01:53.549> rather<00:01:53.700> have<00:01:53.970> good<00:01:54.210> early

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
most part I just rather have good early

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.359 
most part I just rather have good early
game<00:01:54.659> cards<00:01:55.079> as<00:01:55.259> well<00:01:55.320> as<00:01:55.710> you<00:01:56.310> know<00:01:56.570> better

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
game cards as well as you know better

prison I was running to me or horse i

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.320 
prison I was running to me or horse i
opted<00:02:07.530> to<00:02:07.680> i<00:02:07.890> cut<00:02:08.610> them<00:02:08.700> air<00:02:08.849> force<00:02:09.030> down<00:02:09.179> to

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
opted to i cut them air force down to

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.180 
opted to i cut them air force down to

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
one in the deep risen to everyone's

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.920 
one in the deep risen to everyone's
running<00:02:11.340> a<00:02:11.489> starlight<00:02:12.180> road<00:02:12.330> so<00:02:12.599> that<00:02:12.629> was

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
running a starlight road so that was

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.229 
running a starlight road so that was
reasoning<00:02:13.319> then<00:02:14.280> you<00:02:14.340> got<00:02:14.459> the<00:02:14.549> 2<00:02:14.670> warning<00:02:14.849> to

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
reasoning then you got the 2 warning to

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.420 
reasoning then you got the 2 warning to
bottom<00:02:15.569> where<00:02:15.719> it's<00:02:15.840> to<00:02:16.049> torrential<00:02:16.430> those

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
bottom where it's to torrential those

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:18.890 
bottom where it's to torrential those
are<00:02:17.549> my<00:02:17.609> two<00:02:17.670> O's<00:02:17.909> then<00:02:18.180> for<00:02:18.450> the<00:02:18.540> one<00:02:18.659> knows

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
are my two O's then for the one knows

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.679 
are my two O's then for the one knows
you<00:02:18.959> got<00:02:19.079> your<00:02:19.530> force<00:02:19.769> dust<00:02:20.219> tornado<00:02:20.629> okay<00:02:21.629> so

00:02:21.679 --> 00:02:21.689 
you got your force dust tornado okay so

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:24.020 
you got your force dust tornado okay so
i'll<00:02:22.260> give<00:02:22.950> my<00:02:23.069> reasoning<00:02:23.459> for<00:02:23.579> that<00:02:23.640> after<00:02:23.849> i

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
i'll give my reasoning for that after i

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.410 
i'll give my reasoning for that after i
just<00:02:24.420> get<00:02:24.540> through<00:02:24.719> all<00:02:24.810> the<00:02:24.930> traps<00:02:25.170> umm<00:02:26.150> so<00:02:27.150> so

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
just get through all the traps umm so so

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.459 
just get through all the traps umm so so
solemn<00:02:28.400> compulsory<00:02:29.400> machine<00:02:30.200> so<00:02:31.200> the<00:02:31.349> reason

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:31.469 
solemn compulsory machine so the reason

00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:34.160 
solemn compulsory machine so the reason
for<00:02:31.709> Dustin<00:02:32.069> 80<00:02:32.189> is<00:02:32.569> okay<00:02:33.569> think<00:02:33.900> about<00:02:34.019> it

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
for Dustin 80 is okay think about it

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.929 
for Dustin 80 is okay think about it
like<00:02:34.260> this<00:02:34.469> lined<00:02:35.159> up<00:02:35.370> so<00:02:35.549> you<00:02:35.639> want<00:02:35.819> to<00:02:35.879> hit

that's<00:03:10.169> why<00:03:10.319> I<00:03:10.379> decided<00:03:10.560> to<00:03:10.799> run<00:03:10.980> it<00:03:11.099> I<00:03:11.159> thought

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
that's why I decided to run it I thought

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.920 
that's why I decided to run it I thought
it<00:03:11.459> was<00:03:11.519> a<00:03:11.579> really<00:03:11.760> good<00:03:11.939> choice<00:03:12.150> I<00:03:12.359> was<00:03:12.780> like

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
it was a really good choice I was like

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.780 
it was a really good choice I was like
man<00:03:13.139> I<00:03:13.319> want<00:03:13.500> to<00:03:13.560> run<00:03:13.680> more<00:03:13.829> than<00:03:13.889> three<00:03:14.310> of<00:03:14.430> st

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
man I want to run more than three of st

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.680 
man I want to run more than three of st
so<00:03:15.260> that's<00:03:16.260> why<00:03:16.439> throw<00:03:16.680> in<00:03:16.799> Dustin<00:03:17.129> eidos<00:03:17.370> I

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
so that's why throw in Dustin eidos I

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.149 
so that's why throw in Dustin eidos I
just<00:03:18.690> thought<00:03:18.840> it<00:03:18.959> was<00:03:19.049> really<00:03:19.229> good<00:03:19.379> card<00:03:19.680> so

00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:20.159 
just thought it was really good card so

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:23.030 
just thought it was really good card so
that's<00:03:20.310> a<00:03:20.430> 40<00:03:20.729> card<00:03:20.909> main<00:03:21.510> deck<00:03:21.690> I<00:03:21.870> had<00:03:22.079> 17

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
that's a 40 card main deck I had 17

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:35.099 
other people's decks and you can see

other people's decks and you can see
them<00:03:35.220> on<00:03:35.310> my<00:03:35.430> channel<00:03:35.760> serious<00:03:36.060> trouble<00:03:36.299> frog

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
but the reason I'm saying I that is

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:44.210 
but the reason I'm saying I that is
because<00:03:41.879> almost<00:03:42.569> everyone<00:03:42.900> was<00:03:43.139> running<00:03:43.290> wind

idea<00:04:30.540> but<00:04:30.750> I<00:04:31.080> think<00:04:31.350> it's<00:04:31.500> better<00:04:31.680> than

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
idea but I think it's better than

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.370 
idea but I think it's better than
Thunder<00:04:32.760> King<00:04:32.970> for<00:04:33.630> the<00:04:33.690> most<00:04:33.840> part<00:04:34.020> because

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
Thunder King for the most part because

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:35.930 
Thunder King for the most part because
they<00:04:34.620> have<00:04:34.770> too<00:04:35.070> many<00:04:35.190> monsters<00:04:35.400> that<00:04:35.700> can<00:04:35.820> run

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
they have too many monsters that can run

they have too many monsters that can run

one<00:05:17.820> I<00:05:17.850> played<00:05:18.180> against<00:05:18.510> but<00:05:19.169> yeah<00:05:19.290> I<00:05:19.320> thought

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
one I played against but yeah I thought

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.670 
one I played against but yeah I thought
I<00:05:19.590> had<00:05:19.710> a<00:05:19.740> good<00:05:19.950> matchup<00:05:20.130> so<00:05:20.460> I<00:05:20.490> just<00:05:20.760> uh<00:05:20.880> I

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680 
I had a good matchup so I just uh I

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.990 
I had a good matchup so I just uh I
didn't<00:05:22.680> really<00:05:22.800> care<00:05:23.070> too<00:05:23.220> much<00:05:23.250> about<00:05:23.430> citing

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.000 
didn't really care too much about citing

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.430 
didn't really care too much about citing
a<00:05:24.090> whole<00:05:24.240> bunch<00:05:24.450> of<00:05:24.570> extra<00:05:24.840> stuff<00:05:25.020> since<00:05:25.230> I<00:05:25.350> had

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 
a whole bunch of extra stuff since I had

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.080 
a whole bunch of extra stuff since I had
the<00:05:25.470> messengers<00:05:25.890> already<00:05:26.190> I<00:05:26.400> was<00:05:26.910> going<00:05:27.030> to

sadden<00:05:27.360> overworked<00:05:27.750> but<00:05:27.960> I<00:05:28.020> at<00:05:28.320> the<00:05:28.500> end<00:05:28.620> of

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:28.650 
sadden overworked but I at the end of

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.520 
sadden overworked but I at the end of
the<00:05:28.740> day<00:05:28.890> I<00:05:28.919> just<00:05:29.010> decided<00:05:29.220> to<00:05:30.080> put<00:05:31.080> in<00:05:31.200> level

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:31.530 
the day I just decided to put in level

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:33.140 
the day I just decided to put in level
in<00:05:31.620> it<00:05:31.740> over<00:05:31.980> it<00:05:32.130> because<00:05:32.280> my<00:05:32.490> friend<00:05:32.790> he

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:34.820 
in it over it because my friend he
didn't<00:05:33.419> overworked<00:05:33.870> and<00:05:34.050> I<00:05:34.200> thought<00:05:34.470> I<00:05:34.530> just

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:34.830 
didn't overworked and I thought I just

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:36.710 
didn't overworked and I thought I just
let<00:05:34.950> him<00:05:35.010> use<00:05:35.220> the<00:05:35.370> one<00:05:35.490> I<00:05:35.520> was<00:05:35.760> using<00:05:35.790> and<00:05:36.240> SAT

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:36.720 
let him use the one I was using and SAT

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:37.940 
let him use the one I was using and SAT
a<00:05:36.750> level<00:05:37.080> of<00:05:37.140> it<00:05:37.260> because<00:05:37.440> I<00:05:37.500> really<00:05:37.740> didn't

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:37.950 
a level of it because I really didn't

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:39.590 
a level of it because I really didn't
care<00:05:38.010> which<00:05:38.220> one<00:05:38.370> I<00:05:38.430> was<00:05:38.640> siding<00:05:38.790> this<00:05:39.450> is

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.600 
care which one I was siding this is

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.150 
care which one I was siding this is
really<00:05:39.930> good<00:05:40.080> against<00:05:40.410> fire<00:05:40.620> fist<00:05:40.860> as<00:05:40.980> well

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:41.160 
really good against fire fist as well

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.590 
really good against fire fist as well
but<00:05:41.340> it<00:05:41.460> doesn't<00:05:41.700> really<00:05:41.790> stop<00:05:42.090> there<00:05:42.300> exceed

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:42.600 
but it doesn't really stop there exceed

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.850 
but it doesn't really stop there exceed
monsters<00:05:43.020> and<00:05:44.390> then<00:05:45.390> the<00:05:45.479> traps<00:05:45.750> you<00:05:45.900> got<00:05:46.050> the

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:46.860 
monsters and then the traps you got the

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:48.409 
monsters and then the traps you got the
second<00:05:47.340> fiendish<00:05:47.580> chain<00:05:47.610> because<00:05:48.060> I<00:05:48.210> didn't

second fiendish chain because I didn't

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:49.760 
second fiendish chain because I didn't
want<00:05:48.450> to<00:05:48.600> meet<00:05:48.780> in<00:05:48.810> a<00:05:48.960> second<00:05:49.290> but<00:05:49.470> I<00:05:49.530> probably

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:49.770 
want to meet in a second but I probably

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:51.620 
want to meet in a second but I probably
would<00:05:50.010> in<00:05:50.160> retrospect<00:05:50.700> it's<00:05:51.210> just<00:05:51.390> really

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:51.630 
would in retrospect it's just really

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:55.820 
would in retrospect it's just really

my<00:07:33.150> opinion<00:07:33.419> so<00:07:34.260> I<00:07:34.590> I<00:07:34.710> thought<00:07:35.190> direwolf<00:07:35.580> will

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:35.700 
my opinion so I I thought direwolf will

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:37.490 
my opinion so I I thought direwolf will
be<00:07:35.820> a<00:07:35.850> bit<00:07:36.030> better<00:07:36.150> and<00:07:36.479> these<00:07:36.840> two<00:07:37.050> cards<00:07:37.350> can

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:37.500 
be a bit better and these two cards can

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:39.230 
be a bit better and these two cards can
do<00:07:37.620> different<00:07:37.800> things<00:07:38.010> I<00:07:38.490> know<00:07:38.910> they<00:07:39.150> have

somewhat<00:07:39.510> effects<00:07:39.750> but<00:07:39.990> they<00:07:40.080> can<00:07:40.229> do

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:40.350 
somewhat effects but they can do

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:41.830
