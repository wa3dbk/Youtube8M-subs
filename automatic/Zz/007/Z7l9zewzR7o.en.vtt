00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
alright so let's go over technique on

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:14.690 
alright so let's go over technique on
the<00:00:13.139> bench<00:00:13.290> press<00:00:13.500> it<00:00:13.650> might<00:00:13.799> not<00:00:13.920> be<00:00:13.980> what

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
the bench press it might not be what

the bench press it might not be what
you're<00:00:14.880> used<00:00:14.940> to<00:00:15.179> so<00:00:15.839> what<00:00:16.080> we<00:00:16.170> want<00:00:16.350> to<00:00:16.379> do

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
you're used to so what we want to do

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.630 
you're used to so what we want to do
here<00:00:16.560> is<00:00:18.170> like<00:00:19.170> so<00:00:19.380> many<00:00:19.560> other<00:00:19.710> things<00:00:19.770> focus

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
here is like so many other things focus

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.160 
here is like so many other things focus
on<00:00:20.760> what's<00:00:20.910> going<00:00:21.060> to<00:00:21.119> translate<00:00:21.539> over<00:00:21.779> to

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
on what's going to translate over to

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.290 
on what's going to translate over to
other<00:00:22.439> movements<00:00:22.949> and<00:00:23.130> be<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:24.119> most

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
other movements and be the most

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.750 
other movements and be the most
efficient<00:00:24.750> way<00:00:24.900> to<00:00:25.080> move<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.500> bar<00:00:25.680> so<00:00:26.250> this<00:00:26.580> is

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
efficient way to move the bar so this is

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.000 
efficient way to move the bar so this is
a<00:00:26.789> press<00:00:27.150> so<00:00:27.689> like<00:00:27.960> our<00:00:28.170> normal<00:00:28.529> press<00:00:28.769> when<00:00:28.949> we

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
a press so like our normal press when we

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.780 
a press so like our normal press when we
press<00:00:29.250> overhead<00:00:29.720> right<00:00:30.720> those<00:00:31.430> elbows<00:00:32.430> are<00:00:32.640> in

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
press overhead right those elbows are in

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.940 
press overhead right those elbows are in
so<00:00:33.420> it'll<00:00:33.540> be<00:00:33.600> in<00:00:33.719> that<00:00:33.809> same<00:00:34.079> position<00:00:34.320> except

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
so it'll be in that same position except

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.250 
so it'll be in that same position except
we're<00:00:35.070> just<00:00:35.219> gonna<00:00:35.309> be<00:00:35.399> pressing<00:00:35.760> out<00:00:35.910> okay<00:00:36.809> it
