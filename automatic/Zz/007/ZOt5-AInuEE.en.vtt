00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.780 

so<00:00:03.840> here<00:00:04.620> we<00:00:04.770> go<00:00:04.920> one<00:00:05.250> more<00:00:05.279> time

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
so here we go one more time

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.030 
so here we go one more time
this<00:00:06.210> is<00:00:06.480> a<00:00:06.839> Canon<00:00:07.440> EOS<00:00:07.680> 70d<00:00:08.990> which<00:00:09.990> as<00:00:10.290> many

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
this is a Canon EOS 70d which as many

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.009 
this is a Canon EOS 70d which as many
people<00:00:11.340> know<00:00:11.370> is<00:00:11.790> a<00:00:11.820> brand<00:00:12.030> new<00:00:12.300> model<00:00:12.480> camera

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
people know is a brand new model camera

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.320 
people know is a brand new model camera
it's<00:00:13.920> only<00:00:14.070> been<00:00:14.219> out<00:00:14.309> a<00:00:14.340> short<00:00:14.580> time<00:00:14.790> now

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
it's only been out a short time now

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.720 
it's only been out a short time now
here's<00:00:15.750> the<00:00:15.929> thing<00:00:16.139> most<00:00:16.590> of<00:00:16.859> the<00:00:16.949> people<00:00:17.190> are

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
here's the thing most of the people are

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.570 
here's the thing most of the people are
reviewing<00:00:18.510> this<00:00:18.690> camera<00:00:19.320> for<00:00:19.590> one<00:00:20.070> specific

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
reviewing this camera for one specific

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.050 
reviewing this camera for one specific
capability<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:22.260> dual<00:00:22.560> pixel<00:00:23.060> focusing

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
capability the dual pixel focusing

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.320 
capability the dual pixel focusing
system<00:00:24.480> which<00:00:24.660> is<00:00:24.869> primarily<00:00:25.740> for<00:00:26.010> video<00:00:26.330> it's

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
system which is primarily for video it's

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.359 
system which is primarily for video it's
also<00:00:27.539> for<00:00:27.869> stills<00:00:28.140> but<00:00:28.410> only<00:00:28.560> if<00:00:28.800> using<00:00:29.189> live

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
also for stills but only if using live

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.840 
also for stills but only if using live
view<00:00:29.400> which<00:00:29.730> real<00:00:30.359> photography<00:00:31.349> is<00:00:31.439> not

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:31.850 
view which real photography is not

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.819 
view which real photography is not
usually<00:00:32.850> I<00:00:32.880> don't<00:00:32.969> do<00:00:33.149> that<00:00:33.300> so<00:00:33.960> anyhow<00:00:34.230> we're

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
usually I don't do that so anyhow we're

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.209 
usually I don't do that so anyhow we're
now<00:00:35.010> shooting<00:00:35.420> with<00:00:36.420> a<00:00:36.690> non<00:00:37.020> STM<00:00:37.559> lens<00:00:37.860> most

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
now shooting with a non STM lens most

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.740 
now shooting with a non STM lens most
people<00:00:38.579> are<00:00:38.760> rarely<00:00:38.910> testing<00:00:39.480> it<00:00:39.570> with<00:00:39.629> the

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
people are rarely testing it with the

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.080 
people are rarely testing it with the
STM<00:00:40.140> lens<00:00:40.320> because<00:00:40.680> well<00:00:41.399> they're<00:00:41.820> made

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
STM lens because well they're made

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.760 
STM lens because well they're made
they're<00:00:42.480> made<00:00:42.660> for<00:00:42.780> each<00:00:42.840> other<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.320> STM

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
they're made for each other the STM

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.920 
they're made for each other the STM
lenses<00:00:44.190> are<00:00:44.460> stepper<00:00:44.820> motor<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.360> they<00:00:45.750> have

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
lenses are stepper motor and they have

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.700 
lenses are stepper motor and they have
very<00:00:46.110> smooth<00:00:48.050> just<00:00:49.050> tiny<00:00:49.649> incremental

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
very smooth just tiny incremental

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.590 
very smooth just tiny incremental
focusing<00:00:52.710> points<00:00:52.949> so<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:53.940> motors<00:00:54.300> are

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
focusing points so the motors are

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.560 
focusing points so the motors are
quieter<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:56.610> actual<00:00:59.449> mechanism<00:01:00.449> is

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
quieter and the the actual mechanism is

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.569 
quieter and the the actual mechanism is
a<00:01:00.600> little<00:01:00.750> smoother<00:01:01.079> so<00:01:01.649> here's<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.399> thing

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
a little smoother so here's the thing

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.090 
a little smoother so here's the thing
what<00:01:03.420> I'm<00:01:03.690> gonna<00:01:03.840> test<00:01:04.170> right<00:01:04.409> now<00:01:04.439> is<00:01:04.949> an

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
what I'm gonna test right now is an

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.310 
what I'm gonna test right now is an
honest<00:01:05.610> young<00:01:05.729> lens<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.540> in<00:01:06.869> fact<00:01:07.049> it's<00:01:07.229> a

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
honest young lens and in fact it's a

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.289 
honest young lens and in fact it's a
prime<00:01:07.619> lens<00:01:07.860> which<00:01:08.070> is<00:01:08.220> why<00:01:08.400> I<00:01:08.430> look<00:01:08.909> like<00:01:09.119> I'm

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
prime lens which is why I look like I'm

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.500 
prime lens which is why I look like I'm
practically<00:01:09.720> on<00:01:09.900> top<00:01:09.930> of<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.350> camera<00:01:11.119> it's<00:01:12.119> a

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
practically on top of the camera it's a

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.039 
practically on top of the camera it's a
50<00:01:12.930> millimeter<00:01:13.310> at<00:01:14.310> 1.4<00:01:15.000> now<00:01:15.180> with<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.390> 1.4

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
50 millimeter at 1.4 now with the 1.4

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.600 
50 millimeter at 1.4 now with the 1.4
we're<00:01:16.229> gonna<00:01:16.320> get<00:01:16.500> a<00:01:16.530> very<00:01:16.770> shallow<00:01:17.100> depth<00:01:17.460> of

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
we're gonna get a very shallow depth of

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.310 
we're gonna get a very shallow depth of
field<00:01:17.790> which<00:01:18.360> means<00:01:18.540> if<00:01:18.750> I<00:01:18.840> move<00:01:19.020> even<00:01:19.259> a

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
field which means if I move even a

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.440 
field which means if I move even a
little<00:01:19.560> bit<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:20.460> camera<00:01:20.880> is<00:01:20.970> gonna<00:01:21.090> have<00:01:21.330> to

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
little bit the camera is gonna have to

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.620 
little bit the camera is gonna have to
refocus<00:01:21.810> now<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.290> cool<00:01:22.560> thing<00:01:22.590> about<00:01:22.860> the

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
refocus now the cool thing about the

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.260 
refocus now the cool thing about the
dual<00:01:24.630> pixel<00:01:25.369> order<00:01:26.369> focus<00:01:26.640> on<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.939> on<00:01:27.180> the

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
dual pixel order focus on the on the

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.510 
dual pixel order focus on the on the
newer<00:01:27.420> Canon<00:01:27.869> this<00:01:28.619> is<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.799> only<00:01:28.920> camera<00:01:29.460> in

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
newer Canon this is the only camera in

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.890 
newer Canon this is the only camera in
the<00:01:29.579> world<00:01:29.670> it<00:01:29.880> has<00:01:29.909> this<00:01:30.210> capability<00:01:30.450> used

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
the world it has this capability used

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.260 
the world it has this capability used
its<00:01:31.049> ability<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.560> do<00:01:32.220> a<00:01:32.250> smooth<00:01:32.729> transition

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
its ability to do a smooth transition

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:39.230 
its ability to do a smooth transition
when<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:34.500> subject<00:01:34.979> moves<00:01:35.130> in<00:01:35.610> video<00:01:36.150> so<00:01:38.240> with

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
when the subject moves in video so with

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.780 
when the subject moves in video so with
a<00:01:39.270> shallow<00:01:39.540> depth<00:01:39.810> of<00:01:39.900> field<00:01:39.960> I'm<00:01:40.290> gonna<00:01:40.530> move

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
a shallow depth of field I'm gonna move

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.219 
a shallow depth of field I'm gonna move
it's<00:01:41.790> gonna<00:01:41.880> focus<00:01:42.299> now<00:01:42.509> of<00:01:42.659> course<00:01:42.840> I<00:01:42.960> should

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
it's gonna focus now of course I should

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.620 
it's gonna focus now of course I should
be<00:01:43.409> in<00:01:43.500> focus<00:01:43.860> and<00:01:43.979> that's<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.310> idea<00:01:44.670> the

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
be in focus and that's the idea the

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.139 
be in focus and that's the idea the
issue<00:01:45.780> is<00:01:46.140> with<00:01:46.649> a<00:01:46.680> non<00:01:46.920> STM<00:01:47.369> lens<00:01:47.640> is<00:01:47.820> it<00:01:47.970> as

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
issue is with a non STM lens is it as

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.870 
issue is with a non STM lens is it as
smooth<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.840> transition<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:49.680> it<00:01:50.040> is<00:01:50.189> is<00:01:50.430> how

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
smooth the transition and it is is how

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.880 
smooth the transition and it is is how
about<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.180> noises<00:01:51.420> are<00:01:51.899> we<00:01:52.020> hearing<00:01:52.320> lens

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
about the noises are we hearing lens

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.800 
about the noises are we hearing lens
noise<00:01:53.220> inside<00:01:53.610> there<00:01:53.850> I<00:01:53.909> would<00:01:54.149> imagine<00:01:54.570> we

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
noise inside there I would imagine we

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.660 
noise inside there I would imagine we
probably<00:01:55.049> are<00:01:55.290> hearing<00:01:55.500> a<00:01:55.590> lot<00:01:55.770> more<00:01:56.130> because

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
probably are hearing a lot more because

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.030 
probably are hearing a lot more because
it's<00:01:57.540> gonna<00:01:57.719> need<00:01:57.930> to<00:01:58.110> focus<00:01:58.500> a<00:01:58.680> lot<00:01:59.009> more

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
it's gonna need to focus a lot more

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.230 
it's gonna need to focus a lot more
often<00:01:59.729> if<00:02:00.540> in<00:02:00.960> fact<00:02:01.320> I'm<00:02:01.770> using<00:02:02.640> such<00:02:03.210> a

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
often if in fact I'm using such a

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.719 
often if in fact I'm using such a
shallow<00:02:03.750> depth<00:02:04.110> of<00:02:04.200> field<00:02:04.409> and<00:02:04.590> I<00:02:05.250> am<00:02:05.430> on

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
shallow depth of field and I am on

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.100 
shallow depth of field and I am on
purpose<00:02:06.240> using<00:02:06.450> a<00:02:07.220> 1.4<00:02:08.220> opening<00:02:08.989> for<00:02:09.989> the

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
purpose using a 1.4 opening for the

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.100 
purpose using a 1.4 opening for the
record<00:02:10.410> I<00:02:10.470> met<00:02:10.649> a<00:02:10.679> 600<00:02:11.400> ISO<00:02:12.270> and<00:02:12.629> a<00:02:12.720> thirtieth

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
record I met a 600 ISO and a thirtieth

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.830 
record I met a 600 ISO and a thirtieth
of<00:02:13.200> a<00:02:13.319> second<00:02:13.770> which<00:02:14.459> most<00:02:14.849> people<00:02:15.120> go<00:02:15.270> to<00:02:15.300> 60

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
of a second which most people go to 60

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.290 
of a second which most people go to 60
just<00:02:16.530> to<00:02:16.650> double<00:02:16.950> it<00:02:17.069> up<00:02:17.160> a<00:02:17.220> harm<00:02:17.760> but<00:02:18.150> I'm

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
just to double it up a harm but I'm

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.900 
just to double it up a harm but I'm
pushing<00:02:18.840> it<00:02:18.930> I<00:02:19.470> only<00:02:19.950> have<00:02:20.040> two<00:02:20.310> little<00:02:20.489> lamps

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
pushing it I only have two little lamps

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.140 
pushing it I only have two little lamps
on<00:02:21.060> here<00:02:21.360> and<00:02:21.420> it<00:02:21.569> is<00:02:21.780> actually<00:02:22.819> late<00:02:23.819> at<00:02:23.940> night

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
on here and it is actually late at night

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.540 
on here and it is actually late at night
so<00:02:24.480> it's<00:02:24.870> this<00:02:25.410> is<00:02:25.620> actually<00:02:25.980> just<00:02:26.099> room<00:02:26.340> light

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
so it's this is actually just room light

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.130 
so it's this is actually just room light
and<00:02:27.260> moving<00:02:28.260> around<00:02:28.879> hear<00:02:29.879> it<00:02:30.000> did<00:02:30.959> you<00:02:30.989> hear

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
and moving around hear it did you hear

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.800 
and moving around hear it did you hear
am<00:02:31.470> I<00:02:31.650> in<00:02:31.709> focus<00:02:31.890> to<00:02:32.250> move<00:02:33.090> over<00:02:33.300> here<00:02:33.480> it<00:02:33.540> is<00:02:33.629> it

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
am I in focus to move over here it is it

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.020 
am I in focus to move over here it is it
does<00:02:34.200> the<00:02:34.379> focus<00:02:34.680> seemed<00:02:35.010> smooth<00:02:35.310> the<00:02:35.970> whole

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
does the focus seemed smooth the whole

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.970 
does the focus seemed smooth the whole
idea<00:02:36.480> of<00:02:36.510> this<00:02:36.629> is<00:02:36.840> if<00:02:37.019> I<00:02:37.140> move<00:02:37.349> around<00:02:37.500> I<00:02:37.860> don't

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
idea of this is if I move around I don't

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.369 
idea of this is if I move around I don't
want<00:02:38.250> to<00:02:38.340> have<00:02:38.489> the<00:02:38.670> camera<00:02:38.910> trying<00:02:39.870> to<00:02:40.019> search

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:40.379 
want to have the camera trying to search

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:42.170 
want to have the camera trying to search
for<00:02:40.410> the<00:02:40.709> focus<00:02:41.069> it<00:02:41.190> just<00:02:41.370> really<00:02:41.790> is<00:02:41.910> not<00:02:42.120> a

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
for the focus it just really is not a

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.509 
for the focus it just really is not a
it's<00:02:42.510> not<00:02:42.599> a<00:02:42.750> nice<00:02:43.050> sight<00:02:43.349> so<00:02:44.010> this<00:02:44.250> time<00:02:44.489> I

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
it's not a nice sight so this time I

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:46.520 
it's not a nice sight so this time I
should<00:02:44.730> be<00:02:44.910> able<00:02:44.970> to<00:02:45.060> move<00:02:45.180> around<00:02:45.330> quite<00:02:46.319> a

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
should be able to move around quite a

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.119 
should be able to move around quite a
bit<00:02:46.580> and<00:02:47.580> it<00:02:47.819> should<00:02:47.849> keep<00:02:48.390> me<00:02:48.599> in<00:02:48.750> focus<00:02:49.129> even

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:50.129 
bit and it should keep me in focus even

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:53.240 
bit and it should keep me in focus even
to<00:02:50.310> the<00:02:50.489> extremes<00:02:51.120> and<00:02:51.540> each<00:02:52.290> time<00:02:52.650> that<00:02:52.680> I<00:02:52.920> am

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
to the extremes and each time that I am

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.360 
to the extremes and each time that I am
I<00:02:53.610> should<00:02:54.180> do<00:02:54.480> this<00:02:54.690> with<00:02:55.110> well<00:02:55.860> now<00:02:56.010> this<00:02:56.190> so<00:02:56.340> I

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
I should do this with well now this so I

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.880 
I should do this with well now this so I
can<00:02:56.610> actually<00:02:56.849> hear<00:02:57.090> the<00:02:57.120> camera<00:02:57.810> noise<00:02:58.019> but

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
can actually hear the camera noise but

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.460 
can actually hear the camera noise but
push<00:02:59.159> when<00:02:59.580> you<00:02:59.700> play<00:02:59.940> this<00:03:00.090> back<00:03:00.360> quite<00:03:01.230> a<00:03:01.260> bit

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
push when you play this back quite a bit

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.089 
push when you play this back quite a bit
more<00:03:01.769> this<00:03:02.489> is<00:03:02.700> a<00:03:03.000> non<00:03:03.390> STM<00:03:03.870> lens<00:03:04.140> and<00:03:04.379> people

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:05.099 
more this is a non STM lens and people

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:06.890 
more this is a non STM lens and people
have<00:03:05.190> asked<00:03:05.459> me<00:03:05.640> in<00:03:05.760> the<00:03:05.790> comments<00:03:06.629> to<00:03:06.750> my

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
have asked me in the comments to my

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.500 
have asked me in the comments to my
previous<00:03:07.170> videos<00:03:07.620> to<00:03:08.519> hear<00:03:08.700> the<00:03:08.849> sound<00:03:09.150> of<00:03:09.360> the

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
previous videos to hear the sound of the

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.720 
previous videos to hear the sound of the
STM's<00:03:10.050> and<00:03:10.290> the<00:03:10.349> nonde<00:03:10.769> stems<00:03:11.129> on<00:03:11.340> a<00:03:11.370> certain

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
STM's and the nonde stems on a certain

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.119 
STM's and the nonde stems on a certain
focus<00:03:12.180> and<00:03:12.510> conditions<00:03:12.900> and<00:03:13.170> in<00:03:13.769> this<00:03:13.890> case

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:14.129 
focus and conditions and in this case

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:15.830 
focus and conditions and in this case
I'm<00:03:14.370> giving<00:03:14.760> a<00:03:14.819> kind<00:03:15.060> of<00:03:15.120> a<00:03:15.209> torture<00:03:15.599> test

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
I'm giving a kind of a torture test

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.360 
I'm giving a kind of a torture test
because<00:03:16.140> it<00:03:16.290> is<00:03:16.319> a<00:03:16.489> 1.49<00:03:17.720> STM<00:03:18.720> lens<00:03:18.959> so<00:03:19.560> this<00:03:20.190> is

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
because it is a 1.49 STM lens so this is

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.540 
because it is a 1.49 STM lens so this is
a<00:03:20.690> really<00:03:21.690> revolutionary<00:03:22.040> new<00:03:23.040> focusing

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
a really revolutionary new focusing

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.289 
a really revolutionary new focusing
system<00:03:23.940> the<00:03:24.110> dual<00:03:25.110> pixel<00:03:25.459> AF<00:03:26.459> inside<00:03:27.030> of<00:03:27.180> the

system the dual pixel AF inside of the
70d<00:03:27.930> and<00:03:28.920> oh<00:03:29.640> the<00:03:30.030> other<00:03:30.150> thing<00:03:30.239> we're<00:03:30.540> testing

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
70d and oh the other thing we're testing

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.080 
70d and oh the other thing we're testing
here<00:03:31.080> this<00:03:31.379> time<00:03:31.590> is<00:03:31.890> the<00:03:32.159> built-in

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
here this time is the built-in

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.059 
here this time is the built-in
microphone<00:03:33.330> I'm<00:03:33.870> not<00:03:34.049> a<00:03:34.080> fan<00:03:34.440> of<00:03:34.470> the<00:03:34.709> built-in

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:35.069 
microphone I'm not a fan of the built-in

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:37.460 
microphone I'm not a fan of the built-in
microphone<00:03:35.280> and<00:03:36.060> most<00:03:36.269> of<00:03:36.510> my<00:03:36.659> videos<00:03:37.170> are<00:03:37.349> not

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
microphone and most of my videos are not

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.789 
microphone and most of my videos are not
done<00:03:37.739> with<00:03:37.890> the<00:03:37.980> built-in<00:03:38.340> microphone<00:03:39.799> but

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
done with the built-in microphone but

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:42.350 
done with the built-in microphone but
this<00:03:40.980> is<00:03:41.099> my<00:03:41.280> first<00:03:41.519> video<00:03:41.730> with<00:03:42.090> this<00:03:42.299> camera

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
this is my first video with this camera

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.649 
this is my first video with this camera
so<00:03:42.989> let's<00:03:43.409> see<00:03:44.010> how<00:03:44.069> it<00:03:44.220> sounds<00:03:44.250> so<00:03:45.180> once<00:03:45.510> again

00:03:45.649 --> 00:03:45.659 
so let's see how it sounds so once again

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:50.360 
so let's see how it sounds so once again
to<00:03:46.379> recap<00:03:46.739> we<00:03:46.890> are<00:03:47.010> on<00:03:47.099> a<00:03:47.129> 7d<00:03:47.849> D<00:03:48.629> and<00:03:49.010> I'm<00:03:50.010> moving

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
to recap we are on a 7d D and I'm moving

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.390 
to recap we are on a 7d D and I'm moving
around<00:03:50.610> another<00:03:51.239> 1.4

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
around another 1.4

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.880 
around another 1.4
this<00:03:54.030> is<00:03:54.239> the<00:03:54.360> 50<00:03:54.720> millimeter<00:03:54.930> prime<00:03:55.530> lens

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
this is the 50 millimeter prime lens

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.570 
this is the 50 millimeter prime lens
it's<00:03:56.220> the<00:03:56.430> Canon<00:03:56.819> prime<00:03:57.360> and

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 
it's the Canon prime and

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:04.580 
it's the Canon prime and
we<00:04:00.120> are<00:04:00.330> seeing<00:04:00.810> how<00:04:01.230> well<00:04:02.120> it<00:04:03.120> refocuses<00:04:03.600> with

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
we are seeing how well it refocuses with

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:09.130

that's<00:04:55.500> enough<00:04:55.710> torture<00:04:55.920> testing<00:04:56.400> for<00:04:56.580> now

that's enough torture testing for now

that's enough torture testing for now
