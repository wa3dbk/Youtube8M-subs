00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
on centimeters sometimes it works

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.730 
on centimeters sometimes it works
sometimes<00:02:33.970> it<00:02:34.390> doesn't<00:02:34.570> but<00:02:34.750> keep<00:02:35.440> it<00:02:35.560> there

in<00:02:39.820> you<00:02:40.120> do<00:02:40.300> get<00:02:40.510> a<00:02:40.680> unsupported<00:02:41.680> camera<00:02:41.980> film

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
in you do get a unsupported camera film

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.370 
in you do get a unsupported camera film
Gate<00:02:42.430> setting<00:02:42.850> air<00:02:43.030> which<00:02:43.330> is<00:02:43.510> just<00:02:44.170> their

Gate setting air which is just their

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:45.960 
Gate setting air which is just their
camera<00:02:44.890> and<00:02:44.920> light<00:02:45.280> wave<00:02:45.460> is<00:02:45.610> slightly

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
camera and light wave is slightly

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.140 
camera and light wave is slightly
different<00:02:46.330> than<00:02:46.600> you'd<00:02:46.810> see<00:02:47.080> in<00:02:48.040> in<00:02:48.610> max<00:02:48.910> you

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
different than you'd see in in max you

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.220 
different than you'd see in in max you
would<00:02:49.270> have<00:02:49.390> to<00:02:49.600> set<00:02:50.170> it<00:02:50.200> up<00:02:50.350> manually<00:02:52.230> okay

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
would have to set it up manually okay

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.320 
would have to set it up manually okay
there<00:02:53.560> it<00:02:53.650> is<00:02:53.770> we'll<00:02:54.160> go<00:02:54.310> ahead<00:02:54.400> and<00:02:54.490> set<00:02:55.000> our

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
there it is we'll go ahead and set our

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.350 
there it is we'll go ahead and set our
viewport<00:02:55.960> to<00:02:56.170> the<00:02:56.290> camera<00:02:56.820> and<00:02:57.820> look<00:02:58.000> at<00:02:58.210> it

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
viewport to the camera and look at it

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.760 
viewport to the camera and look at it
there<00:02:58.650> and<00:02:59.650> let's<00:03:00.400> switch<00:03:00.490> back<00:03:00.610> to<00:03:00.850> the<00:03:01.770> light

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:02.770 
there and let's switch back to the light

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.610 
there and let's switch back to the light
wave<00:03:02.980> and<00:03:03.250> see<00:03:03.400> how<00:03:03.520> it's<00:03:03.810> it's<00:03:04.810> aspect<00:03:05.320> ratio

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
wave and see how it's it's aspect ratio

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.530 
wave and see how it's it's aspect ratio
is<00:03:05.740> different<00:03:06.160> and<00:03:06.640> there's<00:03:06.880> no<00:03:06.970> textures<00:03:07.390> on

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
is different and there's no textures on

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.060 
is different and there's no textures on
it<00:03:07.720> max<00:03:08.080> okay<00:03:08.560> well<00:03:09.090> it<00:03:10.090> got<00:03:10.270> stripped<00:03:10.570> out<00:03:11.070> on

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.070 
it max okay well it got stripped out on

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:13.800 
it max okay well it got stripped out on
the<00:03:12.250> export<00:03:12.790> and<00:03:12.940> it's<00:03:13.120> there<00:03:13.540> and<00:03:13.750> the

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
the export and it's there and the

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.300 
the export and it's there and the
materials<00:03:14.230> editor<00:03:14.350> but<00:03:14.830> you<00:03:14.950> just<00:03:15.100> have<00:03:15.250> to

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
materials editor but you just have to

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.430 
materials editor but you just have to
repoint<00:03:15.730> it<00:03:15.910> back<00:03:16.090> so<00:03:16.330> we'll<00:03:16.480> do<00:03:16.600> that<00:03:16.750> now<00:03:16.990> so

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
repoint it back so we'll do that now so

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.760 
repoint it back so we'll do that now so
go<00:03:17.560> to<00:03:17.620> the<00:03:17.710> material<00:03:18.070> editor<00:03:18.780> use<00:03:19.780> the<00:03:20.080> pic

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:20.770 
go to the material editor use the pic

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:24.120 
go to the material editor use the pic
material<00:03:20.920> from<00:03:21.340> object<00:03:22.590> and<00:03:23.590> then<00:03:23.740> you've<00:03:23.890> got

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
material from object and then you've got

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.490 
material from object and then you've got
a<00:03:24.160> multi/sub-object<00:03:24.820> material<00:03:24.940> and<00:03:25.900> Max<00:03:26.110> and

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
a multi/sub-object material and Max and

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.030 
a multi/sub-object material and Max and
you've<00:03:27.430> got<00:03:27.610> a<00:03:27.640> front<00:03:28.360> inside<00:03:29.020> so<00:03:29.470> you<00:03:29.560> got<00:03:29.800> two

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
you've got a front inside so you got two

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.830 
you've got a front inside so you got two
material<00:03:30.670> IDs<00:03:31.000> here<00:03:31.270> and<00:03:31.450> so<00:03:31.600> we'll<00:03:31.690> go<00:03:31.780> ahead

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
material IDs here and so we'll go ahead

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.960 
material IDs here and so we'll go ahead
and<00:03:32.020> point<00:03:32.980> those<00:03:33.220> to<00:03:33.459> the<00:03:33.550> right<00:03:34.380> files<00:03:35.970> under

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
and point those to the right files under

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.560 
and point those to the right files under
maps<00:03:37.830> go<00:03:38.830> ahead<00:03:38.950> and<00:03:39.040> pick<00:03:39.160> the<00:03:39.280> front<00:03:39.570> and

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 
maps go ahead and pick the front and

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:43.690 
maps go ahead and pick the front and
you'll<00:03:40.720> get<00:03:40.840> an<00:03:40.959> error

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.210 

and<00:03:44.180> we'll<00:03:44.450> go<00:03:44.569> ahead<00:03:44.630> and<00:03:44.810> just<00:03:45.110> point<00:03:45.410> it<00:03:45.530> and

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
and we'll go ahead and just point it and

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.670 
and we'll go ahead and just point it and
I<00:03:46.340> put<00:03:46.520> all<00:03:46.610> the<00:03:46.730> the<00:03:47.120> textures<00:03:47.720> that<00:03:47.750> for<00:03:48.590> the

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
I put all the the textures that for the

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.360 
I put all the the textures that for the
scene<00:03:48.920> in<00:03:49.130> the<00:03:49.220> root<00:03:49.489> directory<00:03:50.030> of<00:03:50.120> the<00:03:51.370> FBX

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
scene in the root directory of the FBX

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.150 
scene in the root directory of the FBX
file<00:03:52.640> format<00:03:52.930> exported<00:03:53.930> out<00:03:54.050> of<00:03:54.080> Lightwave<00:03:54.890> so

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
file format exported out of Lightwave so

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.870 
file format exported out of Lightwave so
it'll<00:03:55.310> be<00:03:55.400> easier<00:03:55.670> to<00:03:56.090> locate<00:03:57.489> alright<00:03:58.489> so<00:03:58.700> it

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.880 
it'll be easier to locate alright so it

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.550 
it'll be easier to locate alright so it
loads<00:03:59.120> those<00:03:59.300> in<00:03:59.510> there<00:03:59.720> you<00:03:59.900> can<00:04:00.080> do<00:04:00.230> every

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
loads those in there you can do every

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.720 
loads those in there you can do every
single<00:04:00.860> map<00:04:02.290> for<00:04:03.290> the<00:04:03.530> specular<00:04:04.280> bump<00:04:04.550> and

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
single map for the specular bump and

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.190 
single map for the specular bump and
reflection<00:04:05.270> and<00:04:05.450> get<00:04:05.569> it<00:04:05.660> in<00:04:05.780> there<00:04:05.959> and<00:04:06.080> then

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200 
reflection and get it in there and then

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.790 
reflection and get it in there and then
go<00:04:06.380> go<00:04:06.950> back<00:04:07.190> up<00:04:07.610> here<00:04:08.060> and<00:04:08.360> do<00:04:08.930> the<00:04:09.080> side<00:04:09.319> as

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:09.800 
go go back up here and do the side as

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:13.720 
go go back up here and do the side as
well<00:04:11.860> and<00:04:12.860> then<00:04:13.160> you'll<00:04:13.280> have<00:04:13.430> all<00:04:13.610> the

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:13.730 
well and then you'll have all the

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:15.610 
well and then you'll have all the
textures<00:04:14.150> the<00:04:14.450> way<00:04:14.569> they<00:04:14.780> had<00:04:14.959> them<00:04:15.140> and<00:04:15.290> light

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
textures the way they had them and light

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.610 
textures the way they had them and light
wave<00:04:16.000> -<00:04:17.000> its<00:04:17.389> rendering<00:04:17.840> settings<00:04:18.049> and<00:04:18.440> things

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
wave - its rendering settings and things

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.819 
wave - its rendering settings and things
like<00:04:18.799> that<00:04:18.859> which<00:04:19.250> you<00:04:19.280> can<00:04:19.549> do<00:04:20.650> alright<00:04:21.650> so

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:21.829 
like that which you can do alright so

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:32.670 
like that which you can do alright so
let's<00:04:22.010> go<00:04:22.220> ahead<00:04:22.250> just<00:04:22.460> load<00:04:22.700> that<00:04:22.910> up

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.920 

and<00:04:32.889> since<00:04:33.790> the<00:04:33.910> aspect<00:04:34.270> ratio<00:04:34.360> is<00:04:34.630> not<00:04:34.810> the

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
and since the aspect ratio is not the

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:36.450 
and since the aspect ratio is not the
same<00:04:35.139> in<00:04:35.320> the<00:04:35.350> viewport<00:04:35.860> we<00:04:36.009> want<00:04:36.190> to<00:04:36.310> match

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
same in the viewport we want to match

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.210 
same in the viewport we want to match
what<00:04:36.820> what<00:04:37.449> the<00:04:38.050> layout<00:04:38.350> of<00:04:38.380> the<00:04:38.590> new<00:04:38.710> text<00:04:39.070> is

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:39.220 
what what the layout of the new text is

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.240 
what what the layout of the new text is
so<00:04:40.150> let's<00:04:40.330> go<00:04:40.509> ahead<00:04:40.660> and<00:04:40.979> change<00:04:41.979> our

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250 
so let's go ahead and change our

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:47.740 
so let's go ahead and change our
rendering<00:04:42.639> setup

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:47.750 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.880 

we'll<00:04:48.530> change<00:04:48.770> it<00:04:48.890> from<00:04:49.070> the<00:04:49.130> width<00:04:49.460> of<00:04:49.730> 640<00:04:50.890> to

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:51.890 
we'll change it from the width of 640 to

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:59.720 
we'll change it from the width of 640 to
a<00:04:51.920> 480<00:04:52.550> to<00:04:52.790> the<00:04:53.030> height<00:04:53.270> of<00:04:55.120> 840

00:04:59.720 --> 00:04:59.730 

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:01.310 

and<00:04:59.970> then<00:05:00.420> we'll<00:05:00.570> go<00:05:00.660> ahead<00:05:00.720> and<00:05:00.960> change<00:05:01.170> our

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 
and then we'll go ahead and change our
