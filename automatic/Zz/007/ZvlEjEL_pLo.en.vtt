 intense and recovered a bit 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.760
 distance what idea from east so much 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.529

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.480
 first comes or could take place in dominant 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.800
 roll then i'm the party so dominant 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.410
 standing in front well that was of course 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.599
 not so rest at the feast of something 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.660
 distance viewed but that is very cool 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.280
 to see and very intensely experienced the 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.920
 to enter stands to the ball 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.180
 between the psp sven we were so that was 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.950
 a classic look 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.360
 she left today and yesterday hand a nice one 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.430
 so celebrated 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.000
 unload what we use body 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.000
 brings good condition 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.730
 well to the against the, in any case that it is the 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.410
 vision that have put more nearly two 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.600
 years ago he now results 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.040
 It is the youngest PSV team 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.670
 ever let me tell that champion 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.620
 is becoming 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.870
 In addition , it also allows PSV team with 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.820
 most self-trained players 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.260
 oh is that has become champion well that 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.030
 are of course also where you where 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.860
 is very proud of training 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.180
 immediately realizes and hopefully the 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.710
 people around you hope that on the 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.020
 its right track and that we by 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.120
 to sit and that we are one 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.530
 direct result of sinister 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.750
 weighted merits of the technical 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.160
 staff and players from there but in it 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.810
 push there with the boys 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:27.770
 come through think it also became youth 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:29.660
 plays and then get through the year 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.090
 many requests from trainers 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:34.070
 interested people from companies that 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.290
 of who would like to see how we do things 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.960
 do they like philosophy of psv 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.820
 know the vision and how it looks on 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.740
 my throne that all that request is over 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.460
 then I will be fine with my job 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.470
 to fill 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.880
 but unfortunately that is not the case 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.600
 said we do a couple of times a year 2 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.430
 a 3 times a year 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.869
 Grab a day and look at these people 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.850
 all how you come and leave 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:53.150
 see everything and that is today was such 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.590
 day 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.570
 and that is very nice because you 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.240
 it gets to be different cultures with 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.520
 being together and trying to feel each other 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.900
 and we tell stories I do 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.670
 and watching and training trainer tells 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.960
 was done by the field after a few 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.400
 other employees do something about it 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.040
 for example scouting about facilitating 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:12.019
 things etcetera and well people don't go 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:13.459
 always so far our acting how well 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:15.739
 us are leaving very happy and happy 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.910
 worth of the latter and so sharing 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:18.620
 we also have a bit of what we do with the 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.480
 world and can also occasionally music and 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:24.760
 so go visit and not about our objection 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.760
 to fill monsieurs to ask how days 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:31.579
 well changing the as your team will 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.930
 unfortunately lost under 19 and under 17 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:34.519
 but at the in competitions in which it also 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.769
 to not to be so in 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:38.299
 exciting competitions but the main prize 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:40.340
 then both teams go for almost this 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:42.920
 result 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.790
 both teams hiss the youth team well 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.939

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.530
 won to the played here am so 

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:49.720

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:56.269
 flattered was a utrecht longer phase 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.310
 of the match was equivalent 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:59.989
 good match for our equivalent 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.200
 winning a match is also what you like 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:02.200
 want 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.190

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.939
 completing calls from the 

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:27.170
