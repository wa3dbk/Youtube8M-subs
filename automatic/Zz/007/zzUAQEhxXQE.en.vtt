there<00:02:54.239> might<00:02:54.420> be<00:02:54.450> a<00:02:54.629> mesh<00:02:55.230> of<00:02:55.379> mine<00:02:55.620> though<00:02:55.829> I

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 
there might be a mesh of mine though I

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:00.199 
there might be a mesh of mine though I
mean<00:02:56.489> like<00:02:56.670> something<00:02:57.090> i<00:02:57.180> downloaded<00:02:59.209> these

trees<00:03:00.599> could<00:03:00.720> be<00:03:00.959> placed<00:03:01.260> with<00:03:01.470> a<00:03:01.560> little<00:03:01.769> bit

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:01.859 
trees could be placed with a little bit

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:04.670 
trees could be placed with a little bit
more<00:03:02.040> variety<00:03:02.280> and<00:03:02.549> this<00:03:02.910> looks<00:03:03.329> sad<00:03:04.230> it<00:03:04.470> needs

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:41.530 

seems<00:03:28.110> that<00:03:28.380> this<00:03:28.500> may<00:03:28.740> have<00:03:28.770> glitched<00:03:38.450> yeah

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:49.309 

when<00:03:42.540> is<00:03:42.750> the<00:03:42.959> ramp<00:03:44.060> put<00:03:45.060> the<00:03:45.209> fog<00:03:47.720> yeah<00:03:48.720> so<00:03:49.020> it

when is the ramp put the fog yeah so it
it<00:03:49.739> broke<00:03:50.300> unfortunately<00:03:51.590> it<00:03:52.590> seems

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:57.770 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:05.950 

uh<00:04:01.540> well<00:04:02.540> while<00:04:02.930> we<00:04:03.140> wait<00:04:03.380> uh<00:04:04.120> I<00:04:05.120> guess<00:04:05.780> we'll
