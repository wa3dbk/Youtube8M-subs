00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:08.160
 the uni what goes on shorts at the 19 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.719
 un world climate conference in warsaw 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.519
 the recent natural disasters to 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.840
 biggest discussion topics are the representatives 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.309
 the philippines as well as others 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.540
 developing and emerging economies 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.279
 the meeting on wednesday prematurely 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.690
 it left in the last conversation 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.920
 above all, therefore, the poorer countries 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.689
 for the consequences of global warming 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.519
 could be compensated 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.840
 the industrialized countries out of fear of still 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.519
 higher costs the negotiations 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.920
 blocked the poor countries at the 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.420
 conference will be referred to as g77 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.430
 however, they suffer the most from that 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.870
 global climate wall are at the same time 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.010
 you also by your geographical location 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.690
 more frequent from weather disasters 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.879
 affected in the last 30 years 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.559
 25 million people were killed 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.120
 storm earthquakes and other nature 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.680
 this killed the resulting damage 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.450
 In the period to almost 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.309
 four billion dollars the United States 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.739
 Therefore, they plan in the context of green climate 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.730
 fund $ 100 billion annually for 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.469
 coping with such damage 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.760
 to provide so in particular the 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.170
 least developed countries 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.539
 Quick financial help available 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.680
 stands in addition to the g 77 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.600
 however, about building a new one 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.010
 Organization is negotiating the most 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.090
 damage means losses and damage 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.500
 and should collect for the 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.580
 helpful monies was responsible 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.840
 it was not all about 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.460
 financial compensation the 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.630
 conversations live from the dispute 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.280
 money determines a Filipino 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.110
 Delegate came to the beginning of the conference 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.760
 in the hunger strike to deal with the 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.320
 to protest with the nuclear disaster 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.450
 to become the green climate fund 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.340
 Germany is expected 3 billion 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.409
 dollars a year contribute the money 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.240
 this should be done both from the state funds 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.400
 as coming out of the private sector 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.110
 g77 request that the corresponding account 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.400
 at the World Bank as soon as possible 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.689
 are finally filled are the 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.000
 industrialized countries for global warming 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.710
 responsible for the natural disasters 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.630
 ultimately triggered a sinking 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.189
 Co2 emissions like those at the 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.990
 Last climate conferences decided 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.030
 would have been at the current time 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.259
 no longer influence on weather event 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.180
 demand because of it 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.740
 developing countries concrete measures 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.360
 and assistance to the catastrophes 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.470
 it is clear that at 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.060
 the conference a more comprehensive 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.220
 the climate treaty was drafted 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.020
 This could be signed in 2015 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.420
 the kyoto protocol should replace that 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.619
 1997 was decided and binding 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.909
 Targets for the output of 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.500
 greenhouse gases includes a 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.390
 entry into force of the new contract 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.070
 but only planned for 2020 and 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.659
 indirectly came at least a plan to 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.649
 fight against the forest destruction materialize 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.119
 the states in warsaw 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.470
 have passed that extra 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.000
 top up for lausanne damage 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.780
 but unlikely therefore already 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.280
 the green small with 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:18.480
 It is decided that the money will be 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.440
 paid from 2014 what do you think 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.390
 the industrial countries the 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.010
 developing countries with the consequences of 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.600
 help climate change by giving it more 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.069
 Money will provide your answer 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.450
 on it if the comments over here 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.830
