off-roading experience so obviously you

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:03.710 
off-roading experience so obviously you
can't<00:01:02.250> have<00:01:02.430> wires<00:01:02.729> connected<00:01:03.269> to<00:01:03.360> the<00:01:03.479> door

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
if you can remove them so that's what's

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
rock crawling capabilities we're not

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.340 
rock crawling capabilities we're not
doing<00:02:49.280> any<00:02:49.400> rock<00:02:49.640> crawling<00:02:49.940> right<00:02:50.240> now<00:02:50.450> but

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
doing any rock crawling right now but

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.280 
doing any rock crawling right now but
it's<00:02:52.130> nice<00:02:52.700> to<00:02:52.730> know<00:02:53.030> that<00:02:53.390> it<00:02:53.840> does<00:02:54.080> have

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
it's nice to know that it does have

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.380 
it's nice to know that it does have
those<00:02:54.470> capabilities<00:02:55.010> the<00:02:55.970> best<00:02:56.120> way<00:02:56.240> I<00:02:56.300> can

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
those capabilities the best way I can

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.870 
those capabilities the best way I can
describe<00:02:57.080> it<00:02:57.380> to<00:02:57.500> you<00:02:57.620> is<00:02:57.830> it<00:02:58.010> basically<00:02:58.400> has

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
describe it to you is it basically has

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.320 
describe it to you is it basically has
the<00:02:59.150> ability<00:02:59.720> to<00:03:00.560> crawl<00:03:01.370> almost<00:03:01.910> like<00:03:02.090> an

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
the ability to crawl almost like an

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.110 
the ability to crawl almost like an
animal<00:03:02.900> where<00:03:03.200> you<00:03:03.920> have<00:03:04.010> four<00:03:04.280> legs<00:03:04.550> and<00:03:04.910> and

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
any one of the legs can work depending

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.810 
any one of the legs can work depending
on<00:03:08.210> how<00:03:08.360> much<00:03:08.540> how<00:03:09.470> much<00:03:09.650> slippage<00:03:10.160> is

on how much how much slippage is

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:16.150 
on how much how much slippage is
required<00:03:11.330> it<00:03:12.290> is<00:03:12.350> in<00:03:12.770> the<00:03:13.040> terrain<00:03:13.670> too<00:03:15.160> to

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
required it is in the terrain too to

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.820 
required it is in the terrain too to
keep<00:03:16.280> the<00:03:16.340> vehicle<00:03:16.820> moving<00:03:17.270> my<00:03:18.260> land<00:03:18.530> cruiser

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610 
don't take it off-road if you take

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.310 
don't take it off-road if you take
advantage<00:03:49.850> of<00:03:50.150> the<00:03:50.240> off-road<00:03:50.630> capabilities

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:51.320 
advantage of the off-road capabilities

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.130 
advantage of the off-road capabilities
then<00:03:51.860> hell<00:03:52.520> yeah<00:03:52.730> it's<00:03:52.940> a<00:03:53.000> great<00:03:53.210> bargain<00:03:53.420> go

bucks for it

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.760 
bucks for it
so<00:04:04.730> that's<00:04:04.910> worth<00:04:05.120> it<00:04:05.360> fuel<00:04:05.870> economy<00:04:05.960> wise<00:04:06.440> I

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:06.770 
so that's worth it fuel economy wise I

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:08.620 
so that's worth it fuel economy wise I
mean<00:04:07.160> let's<00:04:07.850> be<00:04:07.940> honest<00:04:08.300> even<00:04:08.450> with<00:04:08.540> the

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:08.630 
mean let's be honest even with the

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:10.570 
mean let's be honest even with the
manual<00:04:08.990> you'll<00:04:09.200> be<00:04:09.290> lucky<00:04:09.440> to<00:04:09.650> get<00:04:09.800> a<00:04:10.070> combined

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:10.580 
manual you'll be lucky to get a combined

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:13.180 
manual you'll be lucky to get a combined
20<00:04:11.060> in<00:04:11.210> normal<00:04:11.930> driving<00:04:12.200> obviously<00:04:12.740> when<00:04:13.100> you

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
20 in normal driving obviously when you

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.670 
20 in normal driving obviously when you
go<00:04:13.280> off-roading<00:04:13.730> all<00:04:14.450> bets<00:04:14.780> are<00:04:14.900> off

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
go off-roading all bets are off

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.410 
go off-roading all bets are off
you<00:04:15.890> know<00:04:16.040> why<00:04:16.640> doesn't<00:04:16.880> it<00:04:17.000> get<00:04:17.120> good<00:04:17.270> fuel

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:17.420 
you know why doesn't it get good fuel

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:19.930 
you know why doesn't it get good fuel
economy<00:04:17.720> well<00:04:18.170> it's<00:04:18.590> relatively<00:04:19.040> heavy<00:04:19.340> you

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 
economy well it's relatively heavy you

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:21.400 
economy well it's relatively heavy you
could<00:04:20.090> see<00:04:20.299> this<00:04:20.450> windshield<00:04:20.780> that's<00:04:21.200> not

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
could see this windshield that's not

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:23.740 
could see this windshield that's not
very<00:04:21.560> aerodynamic<00:04:22.000> you<00:04:23.000> can<00:04:23.120> see<00:04:23.270> these<00:04:23.390> tires

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
very aerodynamic you can see these tires

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.480 
very aerodynamic you can see these tires
they're<00:04:24.500> not<00:04:24.680> blow<00:04:24.890> rolling<00:04:25.370> resistance

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 
they're not blow rolling resistance
