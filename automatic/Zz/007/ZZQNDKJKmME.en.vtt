00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
you want to do is kind of just start out

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.740 
you want to do is kind of just start out
with<00:01:21.509> a<00:01:21.570> handful<00:01:22.170> maybe<00:01:22.680> about<00:01:23.009> a<00:01:23.070> quarter<00:01:23.750> one

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
quarter cup and you're just going to

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.399 
quarter cup and you're just going to
plop<00:01:26.850> that<00:01:27.000> in<00:01:27.210> I'm<00:01:27.630> probably<00:01:27.930> going<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.229> put<00:01:28.380> a

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
plop that in I'm probably going to put a

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.510 
plop that in I'm probably going to put a
little<00:01:28.470> bit<00:01:28.950> more<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:31.100> what<00:01:32.100> you<00:01:32.220> want

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
little bit more and what you want

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.649 
little bit more and what you want
basically<00:01:33.000> is<00:01:33.329> it<00:01:33.570> is<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:34.259> create<00:01:34.619> a

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
basically is it is to create a

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:37.940 
basically is it is to create a
consistency<00:01:36.659> that<00:01:36.990> is<00:01:37.140> similar<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.680> play

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
consistency that is similar to play

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.359 
consistency that is similar to play
dough<00:01:38.009> so<00:01:38.460> gay<00:01:38.610> you're<00:01:38.909> able<00:01:39.299> to<00:01:39.509> mold<00:01:40.020> it

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
dough so gay you're able to mold it

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:44.780 
dough so gay you're able to mold it
together<00:01:41.780> into<00:01:42.780> little<00:01:43.049> balls<00:01:43.640> so<00:01:44.640> we're<00:01:44.759> just

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
together into little balls so we're just

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.280 
together into little balls so we're just
going<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.090> mix<00:01:45.210> that<00:01:45.360> and<00:01:45.659> come<00:01:45.810> back<00:01:45.930> when<00:01:46.140> it

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
going to mix that and come back when it

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.679 
going to mix that and come back when it
I<00:01:46.500> think<00:01:47.009> this<00:01:47.130> is<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.340> consistency<00:01:48.240> you<00:01:48.509> want

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
I think this is the consistency you want

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.929 
I think this is the consistency you want
it<00:01:49.409> to<00:01:49.770> be<00:01:49.920> you<00:01:50.040> can<00:01:50.189> see<00:01:50.340> how<00:01:50.549> it<00:01:50.729> really

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
it to be you can see how it really

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.539 
it to be you can see how it really
resembles<00:01:51.509> like<00:01:51.810> play-doh<00:01:52.220> so<00:01:53.220> my<00:01:53.340> tip<00:01:53.399> is

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
resembles like play-doh so my tip is

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.370 
resembles like play-doh so my tip is
just<00:01:53.909> to<00:01:54.240> start<00:01:54.630> out<00:01:54.750> with<00:01:54.869> a<00:01:54.930> little<00:01:55.170> bit<00:01:55.320> of

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
just to start out with a little bit of

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.139 
just to start out with a little bit of
icing<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:55.920> work<00:01:56.130> your<00:01:56.250> way<00:01:56.340> up<00:01:56.460> until<00:01:56.759> you<00:01:57.000> get

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
icing and work your way up until you get

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.120 
icing and work your way up until you get
the<00:01:57.479> right<00:01:57.509> consistency<00:01:58.049> where<00:01:58.860> you<00:01:58.950> can

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
the right consistency where you can

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.569 
the right consistency where you can
create<00:01:59.280> balls<00:01:59.729> now<00:02:00.570> for<00:02:01.140> scoops<00:02:01.740> I'm<00:02:02.189> going<00:02:02.460> to

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
create balls now for scoops I'm going to

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.850 
create balls now for scoops I'm going to
use<00:02:02.759> this<00:02:02.969> cookie<00:02:03.420> scoop<00:02:03.750> I<00:02:03.960> feel<00:02:04.500> that<00:02:04.680> the

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
use this cookie scoop I feel that the

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.950 
use this cookie scoop I feel that the
ice<00:02:04.979> cream<00:02:05.280> scoop<00:02:05.610> makes<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:06.180> balls<00:02:06.360> too<00:02:06.719> big

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
ice cream scoop makes the balls too big

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.749 
ice cream scoop makes the balls too big
but<00:02:07.590> what<00:02:07.860> I'm<00:02:07.950> going<00:02:08.099> to<00:02:08.160> do<00:02:08.310> is<00:02:08.399> I'm<00:02:08.550> going<00:02:08.580> to

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
but what I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:09.180 
but what I'm going to do is I'm going to
take<00:02:08.819> this

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
take this

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.870 
take this
he<00:02:09.340> scooped<00:02:09.670> and<00:02:10.030> I'm<00:02:10.270> gonna<00:02:10.450> scoop<00:02:10.869> to<00:02:11.380> I
