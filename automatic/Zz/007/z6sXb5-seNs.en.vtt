00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:32.559 
my right arm is doing a figure eight the

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:35.399 
my right arm is doing a figure eight the
most<00:00:32.890> basic<00:00:33.340> of<00:00:33.489> moves<00:00:33.730> figuring<00:00:34.570> right<00:00:34.809> we're

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:35.409 
most basic of moves figuring right we're

00:00:35.409 --> 00:00:37.290 
most basic of moves figuring right we're
making<00:00:35.500> a<00:00:35.739> circle<00:00:36.100> this<00:00:36.250> way<00:00:36.550> and<00:00:36.909> a<00:00:36.970> circle

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:37.300 
making a circle this way and a circle

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.180 
making a circle this way and a circle
this<00:00:37.420> way<00:00:37.659> this<00:00:37.960> was<00:00:38.140> in<00:00:38.260> the<00:00:38.440> very<00:00:38.710> basics

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.190 
this way this was in the very basics

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:40.439 
this way this was in the very basics
video<00:00:39.489> so<00:00:39.730> you<00:00:39.820> should<00:00:40.030> be<00:00:40.149> able<00:00:40.210> to<00:00:40.300> do<00:00:40.420> a

00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:40.449 
video so you should be able to do a

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:42.240 
video so you should be able to do a
figure<00:00:40.629> eight<00:00:40.780> and<00:00:41.079> here's<00:00:41.920> what's<00:00:42.159> gonna

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:42.250 
figure eight and here's what's gonna

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.630 
figure eight and here's what's gonna
happen<00:00:42.370> as<00:00:43.470> you<00:00:44.470> figure<00:00:44.620> it<00:00:44.829> crosses<00:00:45.519> over

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:45.640 
happen as you figure it crosses over

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.610 
happen as you figure it crosses over
onto<00:00:46.000> the<00:00:46.120> same<00:00:46.360> side<00:00:46.659> so<00:00:46.839> my<00:00:46.989> right<00:00:47.170> hand<00:00:47.470> as

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:47.620 
onto the same side so my right hand as

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:48.869 
onto the same side so my right hand as
soon<00:00:47.739> as<00:00:47.890> the<00:00:48.010> figure<00:00:48.190> that<00:00:48.309> crosses<00:00:48.670> on<00:00:48.790> the

00:00:48.869 --> 00:00:48.879 
soon as the figure that crosses on the

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:51.299 
soon as the figure that crosses on the
right<00:00:49.030> side<00:00:49.360> I'm<00:00:50.110> gonna<00:00:50.320> turn<00:00:50.589> my<00:00:50.800> back<00:00:50.829> in

faint and back okay so what we're gonna
do<00:01:41.409> cool<00:01:41.799> figure<00:01:42.250> eight<00:01:42.399> figure<00:01:42.670> eight<00:01:42.759> and<00:01:43.090> as

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:43.869 
do cool figure eight figure eight and as

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:45.990 
do cool figure eight figure eight and as
soon<00:01:44.049> as<00:01:44.200> it<00:01:44.320> crosses<00:01:44.469> over<00:01:44.950> we're<00:01:45.610> gonna<00:01:45.700> turn

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
soon as it crosses over we're gonna turn

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.959 
soon as it crosses over we're gonna turn
our<00:01:46.180> body<00:01:46.799> so<00:01:47.799> where<00:01:47.979> I'm<00:01:48.130> facing<00:01:48.640> the<00:01:48.729> wall

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:48.969 
our body so where I'm facing the wall

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:51.480 
our body so where I'm facing the wall
now<00:01:49.270> okay<00:01:49.869> so<00:01:50.170> I<00:01:50.200> was<00:01:50.380> facing<00:01:50.649> here<00:01:50.890> turning<00:01:51.250> 90

now okay so I was facing here turning 90

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.149 
now okay so I was facing here turning 90
degrees<00:01:51.759> and<00:01:52.270> I'm<00:01:52.659> taking<00:01:52.990> my<00:01:53.079> hand<00:01:53.289> back<00:01:53.500> and

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 
degrees and I'm taking my hand back and

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:58.270 
degrees and I'm taking my hand back and
it's<00:01:54.340> gonna<00:01:54.430> bounce<00:01:54.610> right<00:01:54.880> there

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.030 

if<00:01:59.150> you<00:01:59.360> wanted<00:01:59.630> to<00:01:59.690> integrate<00:02:00.380> that<00:02:00.710> moving

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
if you wanted to integrate that moving

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.710 
if you wanted to integrate that moving
the<00:02:01.130> hyper<00:02:01.340> style<00:02:01.820> you<00:02:01.970> can<00:02:02.120> even<00:02:02.240> go<00:02:02.420> from

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
the hyper style you can even go from

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.800 
the hyper style you can even go from
there<00:02:02.900> so<00:02:02.930> we're<00:02:03.260> going<00:02:03.380> here<00:02:03.800> boom<00:02:04.670> boom<00:02:05.360> this

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
there so we're going here boom boom this

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.529 
there so we're going here boom boom this
is<00:02:05.990> a<00:02:06.050> hyper<00:02:06.260> moon<00:02:06.590> we<00:02:07.430> can<00:02:07.580> bounce<00:02:07.790> it<00:02:07.970> gonna

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
is a hyper moon we can bounce it gonna

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.170 
is a hyper moon we can bounce it gonna
back<00:02:08.750> the<00:02:08.899> bicep<00:02:09.229> back<00:02:09.410> here<00:02:09.679> and<00:02:10.000> then<00:02:11.000> if<00:02:11.090> we

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
back the bicep back here and then if we

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.780 
back the bicep back here and then if we
pull<00:02:11.390> it<00:02:11.480> back<00:02:11.600> we<00:02:11.810> can<00:02:11.990> by<00:02:12.110> bounce<00:02:12.800> it<00:02:13.010> on<00:02:13.160> back

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
pull it back we can by bounce it on back

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.590 
pull it back we can by bounce it on back
of<00:02:13.970> our<00:02:14.650> tricep<00:02:15.650> over<00:02:15.860> there<00:02:16.010> so<00:02:16.330> bicep<00:02:17.330> here

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
of our tricep over there so bicep here

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.280 
of our tricep over there so bicep here
tricep<00:02:18.590> here<00:02:19.510> so<00:02:20.510> now<00:02:20.600> I<00:02:20.630> should<00:02:20.870> you<00:02:20.959> do<00:02:21.110> this

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
tricep here so now I should you do this

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.580 
tricep here so now I should you do this
we<00:02:21.740> have<00:02:22.270> the<00:02:23.270> feint<00:02:23.540> and<00:02:23.900> we<00:02:24.080> can<00:02:24.200> turn<00:02:24.350> back

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
we have the feint and we can turn back

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.240 
we have the feint and we can turn back
or<00:02:25.430> we<00:02:25.730> have<00:02:25.910> it's<00:02:26.870> quick<00:02:27.080> hyper<00:02:27.350> move<00:02:27.680> which

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
or we have it's quick hyper move which

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:29.860 
or we have it's quick hyper move which
of<00:02:28.400> course<00:02:28.610> the<00:02:28.760> next<00:02:28.970> step<00:02:29.060> we<00:02:29.360> could<00:02:29.540> just

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
of course the next step we could just

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.449 
of course the next step we could just
turn<00:02:30.050> this<00:02:30.260> direction<00:02:30.709> and<00:02:30.830> also<00:02:31.010> we're<00:02:31.340> back

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
turn this direction and also we're back

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:34.600 
turn this direction and also we're back
to<00:02:31.610> table<00:02:31.910> bounces<00:02:32.440> of<00:02:33.440> course<00:02:33.770> we're<00:02:34.459> going

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
to table bounces of course we're going

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.520 
to table bounces of course we're going
forward<00:02:35.300> the<00:02:35.450> aerial<00:02:35.840> I<00:02:35.989> just<00:02:36.170> want<00:02:36.350> you<00:02:36.470> to

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
forward the aerial I just want you to

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.560 
forward the aerial I just want you to
see<00:02:36.830> the<00:02:37.100> that<00:02:37.940> you<00:02:38.060> have<00:02:38.239> more<00:02:38.390> possibilities

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
see the that you have more possibilities

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.440 
see the that you have more possibilities
than<00:02:39.170> you<00:02:39.260> think<00:02:39.440> the<00:02:40.160> trick<00:02:40.370> to<00:02:40.520> the<00:02:40.640> aerial<00:02:41.060> I

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
than you think the trick to the aerial I

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.110 
than you think the trick to the aerial I
usually<00:02:42.260> use<00:02:42.410> three<00:02:42.709> fingers<00:02:42.739> and<00:02:43.280> it's<00:02:43.940> all

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
usually use three fingers and it's all

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.449 
usually use three fingers and it's all
about<00:02:44.390> that<00:02:44.630> flick<00:02:45.100> what<00:02:46.100> I<00:02:46.130> mean<00:02:46.310> by<00:02:46.400> the

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
about that flick what I mean by the

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:49.930 
about that flick what I mean by the
flick<00:02:46.730> is<00:02:46.910> if<00:02:47.300> you<00:02:47.570> just<00:02:48.100> throw<00:02:49.100> it<00:02:49.250> it's<00:02:49.820> gonna

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
flick is if you just throw it it's gonna

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.970 
flick is if you just throw it it's gonna
go<00:02:50.150> that<00:02:50.480> direction<00:02:50.720> because<00:02:51.650> what's

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
go that direction because what's

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.680 
go that direction because what's
happening<00:02:52.310> is<00:02:52.400> as<00:02:52.550> my<00:02:52.670> arm<00:02:52.880> is<00:02:53.030> sweeping<00:02:53.450> down

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
happening is as my arm is sweeping down

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.990 
happening is as my arm is sweeping down
the<00:02:54.500> angle<00:02:54.890> that<00:02:54.980> the<00:02:55.100> arm<00:02:55.280> is<00:02:55.400> making<00:02:55.850> is<00:02:55.970> a

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
the angle that the arm is making is a

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.090 
the angle that the arm is making is a
long<00:02:56.270> arm<00:02:56.570> right<00:02:56.840> so<00:02:57.410> if<00:02:57.560> you<00:02:57.650> were<00:02:57.709> to<00:02:57.800> let<00:02:57.920> go

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
long arm right so if you were to let go

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.890 
long arm right so if you were to let go
it's<00:02:58.730> going<00:02:58.880> to<00:02:58.970> continue<00:02:59.330> moving<00:02:59.450> in<00:02:59.660> the<00:02:59.750> arc

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
it's going to continue moving in the arc

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.720 
it's going to continue moving in the arc
that<00:03:00.080> your<00:03:00.200> arms<00:03:00.440> moving<00:03:00.709> which<00:03:01.310> is<00:03:01.489> that

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
that your arms moving which is that

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.460 
that your arms moving which is that
direction<00:03:02.030> we<00:03:02.720> don't<00:03:02.750> want<00:03:03.049> to<00:03:03.200> go<00:03:03.320> that

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
direction we don't want to go that

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.500 
direction we don't want to go that
direction<00:03:03.590> so<00:03:03.980> at<00:03:04.070> the<00:03:04.160> very<00:03:04.190> end<00:03:04.610> it's<00:03:05.299> really

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
direction so at the very end it's really

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.990 
direction so at the very end it's really
all<00:03:05.780> about<00:03:05.930> how<00:03:06.230> your<00:03:06.380> fingers<00:03:06.830> twist<00:03:07.519> flick

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
all about how your fingers twist flick

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000 
all about how your fingers twist flick
and<00:03:08.209> release<00:03:08.480> at<00:03:08.810> the<00:03:08.989> very<00:03:09.230> last<00:03:09.440> second<00:03:09.920> it

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
and release at the very last second it

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:11.949 
and release at the very last second it
should<00:03:10.250> be<00:03:10.370> an<00:03:10.640> upward<00:03:10.940> a<00:03:11.360> little<00:03:11.810> upward

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
doing there figure eight we're doing a

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:22.030 
doing there figure eight we're doing a
figure<00:03:19.700> eight<00:03:19.820> it<00:03:20.360> comes<00:03:20.600> under<00:03:20.989> and<00:03:21.260> as<00:03:21.830> soon

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
figure eight it comes under and as soon

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.560 
figure eight it comes under and as soon
as<00:03:22.070> it<00:03:22.280> reaches<00:03:22.640> a<00:03:22.670> little<00:03:22.940> bit<00:03:23.060> past<00:03:23.330> our

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
as it reaches a little bit past our

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:25.930 
as it reaches a little bit past our
waist<00:03:23.840> so<00:03:24.380> not<00:03:24.860> necessarily<00:03:25.489> in<00:03:25.640> the<00:03:25.700> center

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
waist so not necessarily in the center

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.819 
waist so not necessarily in the center
but<00:03:26.090> a<00:03:26.150> little<00:03:26.299> bit<00:03:26.450> past<00:03:26.810> the<00:03:27.079> waist<00:03:27.260> as<00:03:27.680> soon

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:27.829 
but a little bit past the waist as soon

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:29.680 
but a little bit past the waist as soon
as<00:03:27.920> it<00:03:28.040> reaches<00:03:28.280> over<00:03:28.489> here<00:03:28.700> you<00:03:29.329> notice<00:03:29.480> how

gonna flick like that flick flick this
may<00:03:37.700> take<00:03:37.880> a<00:03:37.940> little<00:03:38.060> bit<00:03:38.209> of<00:03:38.329> practice<00:03:38.480> but

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
may take a little bit of practice but

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.199 
may take a little bit of practice but
it's<00:03:38.930> gonna<00:03:39.019> look<00:03:39.079> like<00:03:39.200> this<00:03:39.410> click<00:03:40.120> or<00:03:41.120> a

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
it's gonna look like this click or a

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:43.840 
it's gonna look like this click or a
turn<00:03:41.420> and<00:03:41.540> catch<00:03:41.750> it<00:03:41.989> okay<00:03:42.560> right<00:03:43.519> now<00:03:43.640> though

turn and catch it okay right now though
we're<00:03:44.120> gonna<00:03:44.209> just<00:03:44.480> do<00:03:44.540> the<00:03:44.660> flicking<00:03:44.989> we're

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:45.079 
we're gonna just do the flicking we're

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:46.720 
we're gonna just do the flicking we're
gonna<00:03:45.200> let<00:03:45.350> it<00:03:45.440> fall<00:03:45.620> it<00:03:45.799> should<00:03:46.010> pass<00:03:46.280> through

gonna let it fall it should pass through

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:49.090 
gonna let it fall it should pass through
the<00:03:47.120> space<00:03:47.450> in<00:03:47.630> her<00:03:47.720> arm<00:03:47.989> and<00:03:48.500> a<00:03:48.650> ship<00:03:48.860> flick

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
the space in her arm and a ship flick
