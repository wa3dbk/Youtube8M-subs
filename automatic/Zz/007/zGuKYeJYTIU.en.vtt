those<00:00:48.780> are<00:00:48.960> my<00:00:49.050> DiMarzio<00:00:49.590> mainstay<00:00:50.100> among

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
those are my DiMarzio mainstay among

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.939 
those are my DiMarzio mainstay among
most<00:00:50.700> of<00:00:50.850> my<00:00:50.969> guitars<00:00:51.329> and<00:00:51.690> I<00:00:52.110> dig<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.710> sound

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
most of my guitars and I dig the sound

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.910 
most of my guitars and I dig the sound
so<00:00:53.160> I<00:00:53.190> already<00:00:53.430> knew<00:00:53.520> what<00:00:53.640> they<00:00:53.730> sounded<00:00:54.090> like

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
so I already knew what they sounded like

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.490 
so I already knew what they sounded like
Cooney<00:00:55.920> had<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.250> idea<00:00:56.640> of<00:00:56.910> putting<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:58.140> brass

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
Cooney had the idea of putting a brass

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.910 
Cooney had the idea of putting a brass
sustain<00:00:59.250> plate<00:00:59.899> grafted<00:01:00.899> onto<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.379> back<00:01:01.710> of

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
sustain plate grafted onto the back of

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.670 
sustain plate grafted onto the back of
this<00:01:02.070> tremolo<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:03.080> that<00:01:04.080> connects<00:01:04.439> to<00:01:04.589> the

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
this tremolo and that connects to the

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.880 
this tremolo and that connects to the
body<00:01:04.830> basically<00:01:05.280> it<00:01:05.640> resonates<00:01:06.420> so<00:01:07.110> that<00:01:07.350> you

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
body basically it resonates so that you

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.600 
body basically it resonates so that you
will<00:01:08.040> have<00:01:08.159> improved<00:01:09.110> fatness<00:01:10.610> massive

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
will have improved fatness massive

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.000 
will have improved fatness massive
Vickery<00:01:12.240> tones<00:01:12.630> will<00:01:12.990> come<00:01:13.170> out<00:01:13.290> of<00:01:13.409> it<00:01:13.530> as

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
Vickery tones will come out of it as

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.780 
Vickery tones will come out of it as
opposed<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.400> before<00:01:14.780> wasn't<00:01:15.780> very<00:01:15.930> resonant

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
opposed to before wasn't very resonant

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.580 
opposed to before wasn't very resonant
you<00:01:17.790> know<00:01:17.909> I'm<00:01:18.150> not<00:01:18.299> gonna<00:01:18.420> beat<00:01:18.990> up<00:01:19.170> peewee

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
you know I'm not gonna beat up peewee

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.399 
you know I'm not gonna beat up peewee
but<00:01:19.830> this<00:01:20.490> guitar<00:01:20.820> is<00:01:21.030> really<00:01:21.509> great<00:01:21.930> now<00:01:22.140> it

I'm playing through a PBJ SX and you

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.219 
I'm playing through a PBJ SX and you
guys<00:01:30.119> know<00:01:30.299> what<00:01:30.390> that<00:01:30.540> sounds<00:01:30.869> like<00:01:30.900> you<00:01:31.110> know

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
guys know what that sounds like you know

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.990 
guys know what that sounds like you know
it's<00:01:31.350> an<00:01:31.439> awesome<00:01:31.770> app<00:01:31.920> when<00:01:32.520> I<00:01:32.549> hear<00:01:32.790> some

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
it's an awesome app when I hear some

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.140 
it's an awesome app when I hear some
some<00:01:33.540> clean<00:01:33.810> tones<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:34.759> they<00:01:35.759> sound<00:01:36.030> like

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
some clean tones and they sound like

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:51.730 
some clean tones and they sound like
this

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:02:11.600 

that's<00:01:52.490> very<00:01:52.820> clean

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.460 

clean<00:02:12.610> sound<00:02:12.970> without<00:02:13.209> really<00:02:13.630> digging<00:02:13.990> and

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
clean sound without really digging and

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.770 
clean sound without really digging and
then<00:02:14.620> as<00:02:14.740> you<00:02:14.860> move<00:02:15.480> through<00:02:16.480> the<00:02:16.569> other

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
then as you move through the other

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.550 
then as you move through the other
positions<00:02:17.380> they<00:02:18.310> get<00:02:18.630> more<00:02:19.630> telling<00:02:20.140> sounding

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
positions they get more telling sounding

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:26.160 
positions they get more telling sounding
interestingly<00:02:21.220> enough<00:02:21.790> so<00:02:22.090> you<00:02:22.270> know<00:02:25.170> that's

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
interestingly enough so you know that's

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.110 
interestingly enough so you know that's
the<00:02:26.349> the<00:02:26.739> middle<00:02:27.010> position<00:02:27.099> between<00:02:27.640> the<00:02:27.850> two

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
the the middle position between the two

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:37.980 
the the middle position between the two
and<00:02:28.750> it's<00:02:28.900> really

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:40.560 

we<00:02:38.980> play<00:02:39.250> the<00:02:39.370> lead<00:02:39.580> stuff<00:02:39.970> which<00:02:40.210> is<00:02:40.240> great

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
we play the lead stuff which is great

00:02:40.570 --> 00:03:06.090 
we play the lead stuff which is great
because<00:02:41.580> it<00:02:42.580> gets<00:02:42.730> even<00:02:43.000> more<00:02:43.030> tele<00:03:04.980> even<00:03:05.980> in

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
because it gets even more tele even in

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:24.890 
because it gets even more tele even in
the<00:03:06.280> bridge<00:03:07.030> position<00:03:07.060> just<00:03:07.840> so<00:03:08.130> telling

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.450 

they're<00:03:25.900> gonna<00:03:26.020> start<00:03:26.290> splitting<00:03:26.770> coils
