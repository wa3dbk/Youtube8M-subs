in<00:00:11.280> this<00:00:11.610> lesson<00:00:11.849> we're<00:00:12.090> gonna<00:00:12.179> focus<00:00:12.420> on<00:00:12.719> an

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
in this lesson we're gonna focus on an

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.720 
in this lesson we're gonna focus on an
implied<00:00:13.170> metric<00:00:13.590> modulation<00:00:13.799> more

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
implied metric modulation more

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.019 
implied metric modulation more
specifically<00:00:15.269> a<00:00:15.360> 3/16<00:00:16.230> over<00:00:16.740> of<00:00:16.920> 4/4<00:00:17.369> what

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
specifically a 3/16 over of 4/4 what

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.179 
specifically a 3/16 over of 4/4 what
does<00:00:18.150> that<00:00:18.180> mean<00:00:18.510> okay<00:00:18.869> so<00:00:19.529> if<00:00:19.830> I<00:00:19.949> have<00:00:20.070> my

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
does that mean okay so if I have my

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:28.130 
does that mean okay so if I have my
metronome<00:00:20.460> here<00:00:20.789> set<00:00:21.539> into<00:00:21.779> 4<00:00:21.990> 4<00:00:22.170> 3<00:00:22.789> 4<00:00:23.789> 1<00:00:24.449> 2<00:00:24.750> 3<00:00:27.140> 3

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
metronome here set into 4 4 3 4 1 2 3 3

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:36.860 
metronome here set into 4 4 3 4 1 2 3 3
4<00:00:28.349> and<00:00:29.310> my<00:00:29.640> sixteenth<00:00:30.060> notes<00:00:30.300> are<00:00:30.420> here<00:00:35.870> I'm

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
4 and my sixteenth notes are here I'm

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.780 
4 and my sixteenth notes are here I'm
gonna<00:00:37.079> do<00:00:37.290> is<00:00:37.469> I'm<00:00:37.649> gonna<00:00:37.739> accent<00:00:38.250> every<00:00:38.550> third

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
gonna do is I'm gonna accent every third

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:57.880 
gonna do is I'm gonna accent every third
sixteenth<00:00:39.300> row<00:00:39.480> so<00:00:39.719> what<00:00:39.870> I'm<00:00:39.960> doing<00:00:39.989> is<00:00:40.200> this

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.479 

so<00:00:58.890> here's<00:00:59.129> another<00:00:59.309> way<00:00:59.520> count<00:00:59.820> to<00:01:00.660> three<00:01:01.489> one

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
so here's another way count to three one

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:03.560 
so here's another way count to three one
two<00:01:02.640> three<00:01:02.670> one<00:01:02.820> two<00:01:03.090> three<00:01:03.120> one<00:01:03.270> two<00:01:03.539> three

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
three one two three one now that we

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.570 
three one two three one now that we
explain<00:01:12.960> what<00:01:13.110> metric<00:01:13.439> modulation<00:01:13.619> is<00:01:14.189> and

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
explain what metric modulation is and

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.740 
explain what metric modulation is and
what<00:01:14.760> 3/16<00:01:15.330> is<00:01:15.540> now<00:01:15.810> this<00:01:15.960> applies<00:01:16.229> to<00:01:16.259> drumset
