00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.149
 hello everybody knows they 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.069
 came his side today we get 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.970
 find on my mac for a little tutorial 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:10.920
 which will consist of putting a ringtone on 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.320
 an iphone from itunes 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.199
 so I do not know if it works this windows 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.359
 but in any case know that it works 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:20.880
 so I have a villa solution where that 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.789
 walk times it does not work then everything 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.480
 first you plug your iphone to 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.760
 your mac 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:32.070
 then there is iphoto which is there and has 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.920
 had to suffer alone and there will be 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.590
 the iphone which will be there brief you will go in 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.950
 your pieces and you will choose a 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.719
 music 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:50.129
 so for me the door to japan 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:51.870
 this one here we go right click 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.860
 if you want to keep the music and has 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.710
 no problem you are doing directly 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:59.250
 create a version enough it's up to these 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:02.399
 abc reports you expect it takes 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.080
 not so much at all here you take 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.260
 the one you are going to change or do 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:10.310
 that he must you are going to get some 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:13.140
 information you go into options 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:17.009
 you will click on buses 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:19.320
 deceased then personally you 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.710
 choose but it must be 30 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:26.970
 maximum seconds we will make 30 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.680
 directly makes us ok then that 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.990
 will change nothing but by cons when you 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.909
 read the music 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.820
 so if you like for example that 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.409
 started at 13 it will start very brief 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:40.140
 you do cleebourg on music that 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:43.290
 you have changed and you have created again 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:46.860
 a version has enough and that's thirty 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:50.670
 seconds that one that you have 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:54.420
 actually create a version enough you the 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.909
 delete hop 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.920
 I took my pieces placed in the 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.740
 following trash will not touch you 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:07.439
 but the one of 30 seconds makes you click 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:10.229
 right displayed in finder and it is there 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.590
 so you do enter you take off the 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.150

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:30.510

 say itunes software is simpler here 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:11.980

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:16.260
