00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
the pan and just spread it out with a

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.740 
the pan and just spread it out with a
spatula<00:01:24.230> until<00:01:24.650> it's<00:01:25.460> evenly<00:01:25.820> spread<00:01:26.510> all

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750

over<00:01:26.810> the<00:01:27.230> pan<00:01:27.470> and<00:01:27.770> then<00:01:28.280> basically<00:01:28.820> you're

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
over the pan and then basically you're

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:30.790 
over the pan and then basically you're
just<00:01:29.000> going<00:01:29.180> to<00:01:29.390> let<00:01:29.510> it<00:01:29.600> sit<00:01:29.840> for<00:01:30.140> about<00:01:30.200> 10-15

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:30.800 
just going to let it sit for about 10-15

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.880 
just going to let it sit for about 10-15
minutes<00:01:31.100> until<00:01:31.490> it<00:01:31.970> firms<00:01:32.150> up<00:01:32.440> then<00:01:33.440> remove

minutes until it firms up then remove

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.530 
minutes until it firms up then remove
them<00:01:34.130> from<00:01:34.340> the<00:01:34.520> pan<00:01:34.700> using<00:01:34.940> a<00:01:35.180> little<00:01:35.300> bit<00:01:35.390> in

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540 
them from the pan using a little bit in

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.110 
them from the pan using a little bit in
foil<00:01:35.840> and<00:01:36.020> then<00:01:36.260> cut<00:01:36.530> them<00:01:36.620> into<00:01:36.800> squares<00:01:37.120> if

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:38.120 
foil and then cut them into squares if

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.240 
foil and then cut them into squares if
you<00:01:38.390> are<00:01:38.480> planning<00:01:38.750> on<00:01:38.960> stacking<00:01:39.320> these<00:01:39.650> put<00:01:40.220> a

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
you are planning on stacking these put a

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:41.530 
you are planning on stacking these put a
little<00:01:40.370> bit<00:01:40.490> of<00:01:40.610> wax<00:01:40.700> paper<00:01:40.850> in<00:01:41.120> between<00:01:41.180> the

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540 
little bit of wax paper in between the

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.300 
little bit of wax paper in between the
layers<00:01:41.750> because<00:01:42.530> they<00:01:42.680> have<00:01:42.770> a<00:01:42.800> tendency<00:01:43.280> to

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
layers because they have a tendency to

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.820 
layers because they have a tendency to
be<00:01:43.520> a<00:01:43.550> bit<00:01:43.670> sticky<00:01:43.880> on<00:01:44.120> the<00:01:44.150> bottom<00:01:44.540> these<00:01:45.500> are

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:45.830 
be a bit sticky on the bottom these are

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.830 
be a bit sticky on the bottom these are
really<00:01:46.190> really<00:01:46.430> good<00:01:46.610> the<00:01:46.850> combination<00:01:47.690> of

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.080 
next time to make these better is I
would<00:01:56.540> leave<00:01:57.229> some<00:01:57.620> of<00:01:57.650> the<00:01:58.010> Oreo<00:01:58.340> cookies<00:01:58.850> in

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
would leave some of the Oreo cookies in

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:00.880 
would leave some of the Oreo cookies in
larger<00:01:59.720> chunks<00:02:00.110> so<00:02:00.140> that<00:02:00.320> you'd<00:02:00.440> have<00:02:00.470> chunk

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
larger chunks so that you'd have chunk

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.730 
larger chunks so that you'd have chunk
of<00:02:01.010> Oreo<00:02:01.280> cookie<00:02:01.670> inside<00:02:02.600> of<00:02:02.780> the<00:02:02.900> bars<00:02:03.110> but

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
of Oreo cookie inside of the bars but

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.500 
of Oreo cookie inside of the bars but
other<00:02:04.010> than<00:02:04.190> that<00:02:04.310> it's<00:02:04.580> a<00:02:04.640> fantastic<00:02:04.880> recipe

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:05.510 
other than that it's a fantastic recipe

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.600 
other than that it's a fantastic recipe
just<00:02:05.960> on<00:02:06.080> its<00:02:06.260> own<00:02:06.409> and<00:02:06.830> what's<00:02:07.130> also<00:02:07.340> good

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
just on its own and what's also good

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.430 
just on its own and what's also good
about<00:02:07.850> it<00:02:08.030> is<00:02:08.179> that<00:02:08.360> if<00:02:08.720> you've<00:02:09.080> ever<00:02:09.229> made

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
about it is that if you've ever made

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.410 
about it is that if you've ever made
