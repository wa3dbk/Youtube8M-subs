why<00:00:00.480> engage<00:00:00.900> in<00:00:01.140> a<00:00:01.199> product<00:00:01.469> design<00:00:01.979> or

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:02.190 
why engage in a product design or

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:03.949 
why engage in a product design or
development<00:00:02.760> if<00:00:02.970> you<00:00:03.300> aren't<00:00:03.419> really<00:00:03.780> going

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:03.959 
development if you aren't really going

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:06.650 
development if you aren't really going
to<00:00:04.110> change<00:00:04.319> the<00:00:04.589> game<00:00:04.799> with<00:00:04.980> it<00:00:05.160> and<00:00:05.400> so<00:00:05.730> that's

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
to change the game with it and so that's

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.080 
to change the game with it and so that's
really<00:00:06.930> the<00:00:07.259> essence<00:00:07.620> of<00:00:07.740> roughly<00:00:08.010> four<00:00:08.880> years

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
really the essence of roughly four years

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.790 
really the essence of roughly four years
people<00:00:09.389> have<00:00:09.510> been<00:00:09.690> using<00:00:09.750> a<00:00:10.139> standard<00:00:10.590> bulb

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
people have been using a standard bulb

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.470 
people have been using a standard bulb
snap<00:00:11.099> and<00:00:11.340> I've<00:00:11.400> got<00:00:11.550> a<00:00:11.580> couple<00:00:11.820> here<00:00:12.210> that<00:00:12.269> I

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
snap and I've got a couple here that I

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.950 
snap and I've got a couple here that I
can<00:00:12.570> show<00:00:12.929> you<00:00:13.639> so<00:00:14.639> here's<00:00:14.910> a<00:00:14.969> standard<00:00:15.690> bolts

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
can show you so here's a standard bolts

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.120 
can show you so here's a standard bolts
nap<00:00:16.170> and<00:00:17.060> it's<00:00:18.060> you<00:00:18.619> know<00:00:19.619> it's<00:00:19.710> a<00:00:19.920> pretty

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
nap and it's you know it's a pretty

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.029 
nap and it's you know it's a pretty
common<00:00:20.460> piece<00:00:21.060> out<00:00:21.359> there<00:00:21.689> and<00:00:22.380> I<00:00:22.529> think<00:00:22.740> you

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
common piece out there and I think you

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.800 
common piece out there and I think you
know<00:00:23.130> somebody<00:00:23.430> use<00:00:23.730> these<00:00:23.970> in<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.330> equine

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
know somebody use these in the equine

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.050 
know somebody use these in the equine
industry<00:00:25.230> or<00:00:25.680> I'm<00:00:26.310> not<00:00:26.490> sure<00:00:26.670> where<00:00:26.849> they<00:00:27.029> came

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
industry or I'm not sure where they came

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.310 
industry or I'm not sure where they came
from<00:00:27.300> but<00:00:28.070> like<00:00:29.070> any<00:00:29.369> piece<00:00:29.550> of<00:00:29.580> hardware<00:00:30.320> it

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
from but like any piece of hardware it

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.130 
from but like any piece of hardware it
was<00:00:31.500> adopted<00:00:31.859> by<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.340> pet<00:00:32.730> industry<00:00:32.759> and<00:00:33.480> you

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
was adopted by the pet industry and you

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.840 
was adopted by the pet industry and you
know<00:00:34.230> it's<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.590> it's<00:00:34.770> a<00:00:35.010> pretty<00:00:35.190> standard<00:00:35.610> piece

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
know it's a it's a pretty standard piece

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.450 
know it's a it's a pretty standard piece
of<00:00:35.880> equipment<00:00:36.450> it's<00:00:36.660> got<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.170> little<00:00:37.320> hook<00:00:38.280> on

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
of equipment it's got the little hook on

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.190 
of equipment it's got the little hook on
it<00:00:38.520> and<00:00:38.820> then<00:00:39.059> just<00:00:39.239> slide<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.629> bolt<00:00:39.809> out<00:00:40.140> of

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
it and then just slide the bolt out of

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.220 
it and then just slide the bolt out of
the<00:00:40.410> way<00:00:40.530> you<00:00:40.590> can<00:00:40.980> snap<00:00:41.670> it<00:00:41.700> on<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:42.239> and<00:00:42.480> make

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
the way you can snap it on and and make

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.360 
the way you can snap it on and and make
that<00:00:43.440> work<00:00:43.760> the<00:00:44.960> challenge<00:00:45.960> for<00:00:46.140> us<00:00:46.469> is<00:00:46.829> that

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
that work the challenge for us is that

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.119 
that work the challenge for us is that
we<00:00:48.210> were<00:00:48.360> having<00:00:48.480> some<00:00:49.320> problems<00:00:49.680> with<00:00:49.739> the

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
we were having some problems with the

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.500 
we were having some problems with the
consistency<00:00:51.379> they<00:00:52.379> were<00:00:52.440> breaking<00:00:53.129> and<00:00:53.510> we

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
consistency they were breaking and we

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.420 
consistency they were breaking and we
didn't<00:00:54.750> have<00:00:54.840> many<00:00:55.110> of<00:00:55.260> them<00:00:55.440> break<00:00:55.649> but<00:00:55.920> as

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
didn't have many of them break but as

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.939 
didn't have many of them break but as
you<00:00:56.730> know<00:00:56.940> all<00:00:57.329> you<00:00:57.570> need<00:00:57.750> is<00:00:57.780> one<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.500> it's<00:00:58.859> a

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
you know all you need is one and it's a

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.000 
you know all you need is one and it's a
tragic<00:00:59.550> or<00:00:59.820> candy<00:01:00.390> a<00:01:00.449> tragic<00:01:00.899> scenario<00:01:01.620> and<00:01:01.859> so

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
tragic or candy a tragic scenario and so

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.039 
tragic or candy a tragic scenario and so
we<00:01:02.550> were<00:01:02.699> very<00:01:02.730> uncomfortable<00:01:03.629> we<00:01:03.750> didn't

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
we were very uncomfortable we didn't

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.289 
we were very uncomfortable we didn't
have<00:01:04.199> any<00:01:04.379> tragedies<00:01:04.949> but<00:01:05.159> we<00:01:05.369> certainly<00:01:05.549> you

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
have any tragedies but we certainly you

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.090 
have any tragedies but we certainly you
know<00:01:06.360> we're<00:01:06.540> here<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.840> enhance<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:07.740> inspire

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
know we're here to enhance and inspire

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.740 
know we're here to enhance and inspire
that<00:01:08.340> interaction<00:01:08.939> between<00:01:09.210> humans<00:01:09.360> and

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
that interaction between humans and

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.719 
that interaction between humans and
their<00:01:09.930> dogs<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.439> certainly<00:01:11.159> a<00:01:11.250> dog<00:01:11.490> getting

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
their dogs and certainly a dog getting

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.050 
their dogs and certainly a dog getting
hurt<00:01:12.060> under<00:01:12.900> your<00:01:13.110> watch<00:01:13.350> is<00:01:13.680> not<00:01:14.030> what<00:01:15.030> we

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
hurt under your watch is not what we

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.460 
hurt under your watch is not what we
want<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:16.100> have<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.400> so<00:01:17.659> so<00:01:18.659> with<00:01:19.290> the

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
want to have and so so with the

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.140 
want to have and so so with the
inconsistencies<00:01:20.189> that<00:01:20.369> we<00:01:20.640> were<00:01:20.729> having<00:01:20.850> with

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
inconsistencies that we were having with

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.960 
inconsistencies that we were having with
bolt<00:01:21.450> snaps<00:01:21.810> we<00:01:22.380> thought<00:01:22.710> that<00:01:23.070> there<00:01:23.820> was<00:01:23.909> a

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
bolt snaps we thought that there was a

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.850 
bolt snaps we thought that there was a
great<00:01:24.180> opportunity<00:01:24.360> for<00:01:24.810> us<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.110> improve<00:01:25.380> that

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
great opportunity for us to improve that

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.819 
great opportunity for us to improve that
solution<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:26.729> not<00:01:27.509> only<00:01:28.080> is<00:01:28.200> it<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.380> strength

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
solution and not only is it the strength

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.920 
solution and not only is it the strength
but<00:01:29.070> it's<00:01:29.220> also<00:01:29.369> just<00:01:29.700> that<00:01:29.880> interaction<00:01:30.659> if

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
but it's also just that interaction if

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.170 
but it's also just that interaction if
you<00:01:31.049> think<00:01:31.259> about<00:01:31.290> about<00:01:31.890> it<00:01:32.040> bulbs<00:01:32.310> now<00:01:32.460> when

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
you think about about it bulbs now when

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.640 
you think about about it bulbs now when
you<00:01:33.360> are<00:01:33.509> hooking<00:01:33.900> it<00:01:34.200> to<00:01:34.439> a<00:01:35.479> collar<00:01:36.650> you

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
you are hooking it to a collar you

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.390 
you are hooking it to a collar you
typically<00:01:38.009> have<00:01:38.280> a<00:01:38.780> d-ring<00:01:39.780> or<00:01:40.229> vray<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:41.040> you

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
typically have a d-ring or vray and you

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.370 
typically have a d-ring or vray and you
have<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.610> come<00:01:41.820> in<00:01:41.970> at<00:01:42.119> 90<00:01:42.659> degrees<00:01:42.689> you<00:01:43.290> have

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
have to come in at 90 degrees you have

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.960 
have to come in at 90 degrees you have
to<00:01:43.530> you<00:01:43.979> know<00:01:44.040> get<00:01:44.189> your<00:01:44.340> thumb<00:01:44.579> out<00:01:44.759> of<00:01:44.909> the

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
to you know get your thumb out of the

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.520 
to you know get your thumb out of the
way<00:01:45.090> you<00:01:45.149> have<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.540> clip<00:01:45.780> it<00:01:45.930> on<00:01:46.049> there<00:01:46.320> and

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
way you have to clip it on there and

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.499 
way you have to clip it on there and
then<00:01:46.950> you<00:01:47.070> can<00:01:47.220> release<00:01:47.490> it<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:48.149> you've<00:01:48.270> got<00:01:48.450> a

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
then you can release it and you've got a

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.630 
then you can release it and you've got a
hook<00:01:49.439> on<00:01:49.619> there<00:01:50.060> and<00:01:51.560> so<00:01:52.560> unhooking<00:01:53.369> is<00:01:53.520> the

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
hook on there and so unhooking is the

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.010 
hook on there and so unhooking is the
same<00:01:53.850> thing<00:01:54.090> you<00:01:54.270> have<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.420> get<00:01:54.689> in<00:01:54.810> there<00:01:54.960> and

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
same thing you have to get in there and

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.230 
same thing you have to get in there and
and<00:01:55.439> get<00:01:55.860> this<00:01:55.979> thing<00:01:56.040> 90<00:01:56.579> degrees<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:57.090> it's

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
and get this thing 90 degrees and it's

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.270 
and get this thing 90 degrees and it's
it's<00:01:57.509> kind<00:01:57.810> of<00:01:57.899> an<00:01:57.990> effort<00:01:58.170> we<00:01:58.979> thought<00:01:59.159> there

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
it's kind of an effort we thought there

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.160 
it's kind of an effort we thought there
must<00:01:59.460> be<00:01:59.670> a<00:01:59.700> better<00:01:59.880> way<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:00.630> that's<00:02:00.930> really

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
must be a better way and that's really

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.700 
must be a better way and that's really
where<00:02:01.500> our<00:02:01.770> talent<00:02:02.640> hook<00:02:02.790> came<00:02:03.090> in<00:02:03.329> and<00:02:03.710> the

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
where our talent hook came in and the

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.069 
where our talent hook came in and the
talent<00:02:05.070> hook<00:02:05.219> is<00:02:05.340> basically<00:02:05.850> a<00:02:05.880> scissor<00:02:06.750> type

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
talent hook is basically a scissor type

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.889 
talent hook is basically a scissor type
hook<00:02:07.439> and<00:02:08.009> if<00:02:08.280> you<00:02:08.369> look<00:02:08.520> at<00:02:08.670> it<00:02:08.700> it's<00:02:09.030> got<00:02:09.209> two

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
hook and if you look at it it's got two

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.800 
hook and if you look at it it's got two
ellipses<00:02:10.440> that<00:02:10.910> interface<00:02:11.910> or<00:02:12.180> interact<00:02:12.599> with

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
ellipses that interface or interact with

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.550 
ellipses that interface or interact with
one<00:02:12.959> another<00:02:13.020> there

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
one another there

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.479 
one another there
they're<00:02:13.950> over<00:02:15.410> over<00:02:16.410> concentric<00:02:16.980> there<00:02:17.160> over

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
they're over over concentric there over

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:19.760 
they're over over concentric there over
a<00:02:17.520> circle<00:02:18.000> and<00:02:18.120> so<00:02:18.300> at<00:02:18.569> any<00:02:18.959> one<00:02:19.200> point<00:02:19.230> time

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
a circle and so at any one point time

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.860 
a circle and so at any one point time
when<00:02:19.980> you<00:02:20.069> clip<00:02:20.370> on<00:02:20.580> the<00:02:21.180> more<00:02:21.390> you<00:02:21.540> pull<00:02:21.840> on

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
when you clip on the more you pull on

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.080 
when you clip on the more you pull on
this<00:02:22.200> thing<00:02:22.530> the<00:02:23.160> more<00:02:23.190> it<00:02:23.459> locks<00:02:23.670> up<00:02:23.880> it

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
this thing the more it locks up it

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.390 
this thing the more it locks up it
doesn't<00:02:24.540> want<00:02:24.720> to<00:02:24.810> come<00:02:25.020> I'm<00:02:25.319> done<00:02:26.130> when

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
doesn't want to come I'm done when

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.240 
doesn't want to come I'm done when
there's<00:02:26.550> tension<00:02:26.849> on<00:02:27.209> it<00:02:27.440> and<00:02:28.440> yet<00:02:28.739> it's<00:02:29.010> very

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
there's tension on it and yet it's very

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.870 
there's tension on it and yet it's very
easy<00:02:29.640> to<00:02:30.380> disconnect<00:02:31.380> and<00:02:31.560> undoing<00:02:32.220> I<00:02:32.550> think

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
easy to disconnect and undoing I think

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.220 
easy to disconnect and undoing I think
one<00:02:33.030> of<00:02:33.060> the<00:02:33.180> key<00:02:33.360> things<00:02:33.599> that<00:02:33.690> you<00:02:33.840> saw<00:02:33.989> there

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
one of the key things that you saw there

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.320 
one of the key things that you saw there
is<00:02:34.349> I<00:02:34.500> can<00:02:34.890> come<00:02:35.099> straight<00:02:35.340> in<00:02:35.459> I<00:02:35.819> can<00:02:36.030> connect

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
is I can come straight in I can connect

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.259 
is I can come straight in I can connect
to<00:02:36.480> my<00:02:36.630> collar<00:02:36.959> and<00:02:37.319> I<00:02:37.800> can<00:02:38.130> squeeze<00:02:38.489> and<00:02:38.970> I<00:02:39.090> can

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
to my collar and I can squeeze and I can

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:41.089 
to my collar and I can squeeze and I can
release<00:02:39.569> so<00:02:40.170> I<00:02:40.200> don't<00:02:40.440> have<00:02:40.560> to<00:02:40.620> do<00:02:40.860> any<00:02:41.010> of

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
release so I don't have to do any of

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:45.320 
release so I don't have to do any of
this<00:02:41.300> twisting<00:02:42.300> and<00:02:42.480> pulling<00:02:43.340> we<00:02:44.340> do<00:02:44.640> a<00:02:44.970> lot<00:02:45.269> of

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
this twisting and pulling we do a lot of

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.240 
this twisting and pulling we do a lot of
products<00:02:45.810> for<00:02:45.989> cold<00:02:46.319> weather<00:02:46.410> environments

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
products for cold weather environments

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.150 
products for cold weather environments
and<00:02:47.370> so<00:02:47.519> this<00:02:47.670> is<00:02:47.819> very<00:02:47.970> nice<00:02:48.330> and<00:02:48.660> and<00:02:48.920> easy<00:02:49.920> to

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
and so this is very nice and and easy to

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.870 
and so this is very nice and and easy to
use<00:02:50.190> with<00:02:50.370> gloves<00:02:50.880> on<00:02:51.260> and<00:02:52.459> it's<00:02:53.459> really<00:02:53.760> about

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
use with gloves on and it's really about

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.400 
use with gloves on and it's really about
you<00:02:54.330> know<00:02:54.420> getting<00:02:54.569> in<00:02:54.810> there<00:02:54.989> and<00:02:55.110> get

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
you know getting in there and get

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.559 
you know getting in there and get
clipping<00:02:55.739> on<00:02:55.970> the<00:02:56.970> other<00:02:57.090> thing<00:02:57.330> that<00:02:57.360> will

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
clipping on the other thing that will

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.720 
clipping on the other thing that will
point<00:02:57.810> out<00:02:57.959> is<00:02:58.290> that<00:02:58.319> oftentimes<00:02:59.040> people<00:02:59.400> see

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
point out is that oftentimes people see

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.210 
point out is that oftentimes people see
this<00:02:59.970> and<00:03:00.269> they<00:03:00.450> think<00:03:00.510> she<00:03:01.470> that's<00:03:01.739> a<00:03:01.860> really

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
this and they think she that's a really

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.830 
this and they think she that's a really
big<00:03:02.370> bulky<00:03:02.940> click<00:03:04.700> you<00:03:05.700> know<00:03:05.790> I<00:03:06.030> don't<00:03:06.540> think

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
big bulky click you know I don't think

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.839 
big bulky click you know I don't think
it's<00:03:07.110> going<00:03:07.380> to<00:03:07.500> work<00:03:07.769> for<00:03:08.010> us<00:03:08.040> because<00:03:08.340> it's

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:08.849 
it's going to work for us because it's

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:10.940 
it's going to work for us because it's
it's<00:03:09.330> way<00:03:09.630> bigger<00:03:09.870> and<00:03:10.140> bulkier<00:03:10.319> than<00:03:10.590> this

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
it's way bigger and bulkier than this

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.000 
it's way bigger and bulkier than this
the<00:03:11.549> reality<00:03:12.030> is<00:03:12.060> this<00:03:12.360> is<00:03:12.540> about<00:03:13.110> 41<00:03:13.680> grams

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
the reality is this is about 41 grams

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.720 
the reality is this is about 41 grams
and<00:03:14.370> this<00:03:15.000> is<00:03:15.239> 37<00:03:16.110> grams<00:03:16.319> so<00:03:16.709> much<00:03:17.340> lighter

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
and this is 37 grams so much lighter

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.590 
and this is 37 grams so much lighter
much<00:03:18.600> stronger<00:03:19.549> we<00:03:20.549> were<00:03:20.700> having<00:03:20.970> these<00:03:21.150> snaps

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
much stronger we were having these snaps

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.420 
much stronger we were having these snaps
break<00:03:21.989> for<00:03:22.829> us<00:03:22.950> at<00:03:23.570> about<00:03:24.570> 60<00:03:25.320> to<00:03:25.350> 100<00:03:25.890> pounds

break for us at about 60 to 100 pounds

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.410 
break for us at about 60 to 100 pounds
and<00:03:27.320> and<00:03:28.320> that's<00:03:29.130> a<00:03:29.310> pretty<00:03:29.640> light<00:03:29.970> when<00:03:30.299> you

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
and and that's a pretty light when you

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.680 
and and that's a pretty light when you
think<00:03:30.660> about<00:03:30.720> a<00:03:31.140> 60<00:03:31.739> pound<00:03:31.769> dog<00:03:32.280> if<00:03:32.690> they're

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
think about a 60 pound dog if they're

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.750 
think about a 60 pound dog if they're
running<00:03:33.900> at<00:03:34.170> 10<00:03:34.380> miles<00:03:34.560> an<00:03:34.739> hour<00:03:34.890> that<00:03:35.519> can

running at 10 miles an hour that can

generate about 600 pounds of force how

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
much more is it to use a talent hope

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:42.830 
much more is it to use a talent hope

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:48.110 
than the regular snap hook for you
cost-wise<00:03:45.290> this<00:03:46.290> is<00:03:46.680> about<00:03:47.010> sixty<00:03:47.489> cents<00:03:47.760> and

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
cost-wise this is about sixty cents and

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.460 
cost-wise this is about sixty cents and
this<00:03:48.510> cost<00:03:48.750> us<00:03:48.959> almost<00:03:49.170> three<00:03:49.530> dollars<00:03:51.019> so<00:03:52.019> so

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
this cost us almost three dollars so so

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
do the three dollar option because it's

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.460 
do the three dollar option because it's
not<00:03:57.870> about<00:03:59.900> certainly<00:04:00.900> we<00:04:01.049> want<00:04:01.170> to<00:04:01.319> keep

we're about again enhancing and

humans<00:04:21.959> and<00:04:22.080> their<00:04:22.260> dogs<00:04:22.470> and<00:04:23.479> if<00:04:24.479> you<00:04:24.690> have

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
humans and their dogs and if you have

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.050 
humans and their dogs and if you have
one<00:04:25.169> of<00:04:25.289> these

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
one of these

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:28.570 
one of these
you<00:04:26.180> know<00:04:26.270> just<00:04:26.600> the<00:04:26.780> everyday<00:04:27.590> connection

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
you know just the everyday connection

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.790 
you know just the everyday connection
and<00:04:28.730> disconnection<00:04:28.850> is<00:04:29.680> challenging<00:04:30.680> at

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
and disconnection is challenging at

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.140 
and disconnection is challenging at
times<00:04:30.830> because<00:04:31.220> your<00:04:31.430> thumbs<00:04:31.669> in<00:04:31.850> the<00:04:31.970> way

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
times because your thumbs in the way

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.740 
times because your thumbs in the way
you're<00:04:32.840> twisting<00:04:33.320> and<00:04:33.440> turning<00:04:34.210> and<00:04:35.210> they

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 
you're twisting and turning and they

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.420 
you're twisting and turning and they
don't<00:04:35.990> they're<00:04:36.350> not<00:04:36.380> consistent<00:04:37.130> to<00:04:37.250> their

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
don't they're not consistent to their

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:42.190 
don't they're not consistent to their
string<00:04:38.080> and<00:04:39.160> so<00:04:40.160> just<00:04:40.490> that<00:04:40.700> ease<00:04:41.270> of<00:04:41.600> use<00:04:41.840> that

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:42.200 
string and so just that ease of use that

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.730 
string and so just that ease of use that
that<00:04:42.620> function<00:04:42.919> that<00:04:43.340> performance<00:04:44.030> that's

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
that function that performance that's

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.290 
that function that performance that's
one<00:04:45.740> part<00:04:46.010> of<00:04:46.130> it<00:04:46.250> but<00:04:46.460> then<00:04:46.639> the<00:04:46.790> peace<00:04:47.270> of

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300 
one part of it but then the peace of

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.360 
one part of it but then the peace of
mind<00:04:47.660> and<00:04:47.840> the<00:04:47.930> safety<00:04:48.169> aspect<00:04:48.770> that's

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370 
mind and the safety aspect that's

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.330 
mind and the safety aspect that's
another<00:04:49.760> part<00:04:50.060> so<00:04:50.510> does<00:04:51.200> it<00:04:51.350> cost<00:04:51.530> the<00:04:52.010> the

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.340 
another part so does it cost the the

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.580 
another part so does it cost the the
consumer<00:04:52.910> a<00:04:52.940> lot<00:04:53.210> more<00:04:53.450> if<00:04:53.810> they<00:04:54.110> go<00:04:54.290> with<00:04:54.470> the

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:54.590 
consumer a lot more if they go with the

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:56.970 
consumer a lot more if they go with the
Talon<00:04:55.010> over<00:04:55.310> the<00:04:55.490> leash<00:04:56.180> with<00:04:56.360> a<00:04:56.389> snap<00:04:56.630> hook

Talon over the leash with a snap hook

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:00.610 
Talon over the leash with a snap hook
yes<00:04:57.980> our<00:04:58.280> our<00:04:58.850> leash<00:04:59.180> is<00:04:59.360> typically<00:04:59.720> run<00:05:00.050> about

walking<00:05:52.880> or<00:05:53.240> what<00:05:53.539> leash<00:05:53.990> so<00:05:54.680> it<00:05:55.400> costs<00:05:55.789> a

walking or what leash so it costs a

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:57.340 
walking or what leash so it costs a
little<00:05:56.030> bit<00:05:56.180> more<00:05:56.419> but<00:05:56.630> again<00:05:56.840> we're<00:05:57.080> trying

little bit more but again we're trying

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:59.340 
little bit more but again we're trying
to<00:05:57.530> add<00:05:57.710> functionality<00:05:58.700> and<00:05:59.030> performance

to add functionality and performance
this<00:06:00.350> talent<00:06:01.130> clip<00:06:01.310> is<00:06:01.490> really<00:06:01.669> the<00:06:01.910> tip<00:06:02.150> of

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:02.180 
this talent clip is really the tip of

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.690 
this talent clip is really the tip of
the<00:06:02.419> iceberg<00:06:02.570> for<00:06:03.169> us<00:06:03.320> we<00:06:04.100> like<00:06:04.250> to<00:06:04.400> think<00:06:04.580> that

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:04.700 
the iceberg for us we like to think that

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:08.950 
the iceberg for us we like to think that
we've<00:06:05.000> put<00:06:05.840> the<00:06:05.960> same<00:06:06.169> thought<00:06:06.530> into<00:06:07.160> the<00:06:08.030> clip

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:08.960 
we've put the same thought into the clip

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.080 
we've put the same thought into the clip
as<00:06:09.139> we<00:06:09.410> have<00:06:09.590> the<00:06:09.740> rest<00:06:09.919> of<00:06:10.100> the<00:06:10.250> leash<00:06:10.669> as<00:06:10.880> well

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:11.090 
as we have the rest of the leash as well

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:14.560 
as we have the rest of the leash as well
well<00:06:11.570> I<00:06:11.600> think<00:06:11.930> for<00:06:12.590> one<00:06:12.860> it's<00:06:13.760> pretty<00:06:14.090> easy<00:06:14.330> to

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:14.570 
well I think for one it's pretty easy to

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:18.010 
well I think for one it's pretty easy to
take<00:06:15.020> a<00:06:15.490> hook<00:06:16.490> put<00:06:17.090> it<00:06:17.120> on<00:06:17.300> a<00:06:17.330> piece<00:06:17.630> of<00:06:17.660> webbing

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:18.020 
take a hook put it on a piece of webbing

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:21.760 
take a hook put it on a piece of webbing
and<00:06:19.180> make<00:06:20.180> a<00:06:20.210> loop<00:06:20.450> on<00:06:20.690> it<00:06:20.840> and<00:06:20.990> call<00:06:21.320> it<00:06:21.350> a<00:06:21.560> leak

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:21.770 
and make a loop on it and call it a leak

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:25.540 
and make a loop on it and call it a leak
I<00:06:22.039> can<00:06:22.370> buy<00:06:22.550> any<00:06:23.180> number<00:06:23.900> of<00:06:23.930> those<00:06:24.229> at<00:06:24.590> the

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:25.550 
I can buy any number of those at the

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:29.050 
I can buy any number of those at the
grocery<00:06:26.180> store<00:06:26.210> for<00:06:27.160> about<00:06:28.160> the<00:06:28.370> same<00:06:28.400> cost<00:06:28.850> as

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:29.060 
grocery store for about the same cost as

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:32.140 
grocery store for about the same cost as
it<00:06:29.120> takes<00:06:29.720> to<00:06:29.930> make<00:06:29.960> our<00:06:30.289> talent<00:06:30.740> click<00:06:30.919> and<00:06:31.160> so

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:32.150 
it takes to make our talent click and so

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:34.450 
it takes to make our talent click and so
if<00:06:32.870> people<00:06:33.169> are<00:06:33.410> looking<00:06:33.710> for<00:06:33.919> just<00:06:34.220> an

the cost starts to come in when you've

got a wedding that is its strong and

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:55.440 
your hand and it takes instead of just

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:57.920 
your hand and it takes instead of just
taking<00:06:55.620> components<00:06:56.580> like<00:06:56.760> a<00:06:56.820> bolt<00:06:57.240> snap<00:06:57.570> and

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:57.930

some webbing and sewing them up we are

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:02.510 
some webbing and sewing them up we are

where<00:07:04.470> we<00:07:04.770> are<00:07:05.270> fabricating<00:07:06.270> our<00:07:06.389> own

where we are fabricating our own
