00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:18.869
 good to try the new body 

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.369
 because you remember that the first 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.050
 generation was made a small recital 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.029
 in a little face wash 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.770
 but this vehicle does change for 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.110
 complete first because it's done on 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.910
 a completely new platform a 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:32.129
 global type platform that is the 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.410
 policy that you are using for a level 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:36.840
 worldwide and that is included under the 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.850
 concept called one for that is a 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.370
 same forum for everyone in this 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.410
 case gave fruit to this coming vehicle 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.059
 of the Brazilian plant and that really 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.559
 it was very much waiting for 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.570
 ecosport let's do a little bit of 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.430
 history inaugurates a segment of the suv 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.379
 and light in fact the first 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.019
 generation was made on the 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.640
 platform ford party but stretched 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:59.549
 logically to take this kind of 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.710
 format that adopts the kinetic design 

00:00:59.549 --> 00:01:03.540
 design with large air intakes and 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.940
 the most ripped headlights is saying a lot 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:09.270
 more dynamic in the drawing in its lines 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:12.100
 in his musculature we can say and is 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.290
 important to say that it is a vehicle that 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.450
 we can say that it is of regional origin 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.040
 and that is taking a lot of authority 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.159
 worldwide presence not only that 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.299
 He was like one of the great 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.009
 participants stand in the hall 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:26.140
 gin of the ford brand but also 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:28.180
 that is entering the Chinese market with 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.430
 everything that this implies a market 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.080
 millionaire in terms of sales then 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.670
 It is a vehicle that is imposing itself 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.890
 world level we said with the same 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.539
 language for everyone in all 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.840
 continents are going to sell this same 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:42.610
 ecosport comes to our market in this 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.340
 case the one that we are testing 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:48.340
 with full titanium equipment and 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.500
 gasoline engine of 2 liters and 145 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:53.850
 horses that comes with a 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.850
 5-speed manual gearbox 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.260
 we already talked about the structure beyond 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.800
 I told you that it is a new 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:08.020
 platform maintains the length 424 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.940
 meters long however they extended 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.320
 a little the wheelbase you what 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.820
 I will say it seems few are three 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.280
 centimeters nothing but those three 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.540
 centimeters reach as to give a 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.670
 little more space in the squares 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.410
 back and it really shows a little more 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.910
 loose therefore the habitability is 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.100
 another of the aspects in which 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.780
 evolved also evolved in the 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.940
 taxi trains is completely new 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.340
 again the suspension diagram has 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.110
 a better one, although having a 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.390
 something high center of gravity because they are 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.220
 logically high clearance vehicles 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.770
 to dabble a bit in some 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.300
 terrain a little more challenging what 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.490
 is that having a legal center 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.440
 elevated have some inclination 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:47.050
 what usually with the language 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.959
 technical we call rolido but it's very 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:51.550
 well endowed in security and the s &amp; p by 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:53.470
 more than we enter a curve 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.480
 quite demanding and tends to do 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.250
 some strange maneuver accommodates you 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.020
 permanently because he is active in 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.280
 every moment and since I get into the 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.020
 part of equipment I want to tell you 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.209
 that comes with the traction control 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.160
 also with abs brakes with distribution 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:08.040
 braking electronics 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.480
 and that also brings isofix hooks 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:13.260
 automatic air conditioner armchair 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.260
 height adjustable driver 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.720
 the steering wheel also has keys 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.040
 multifunction and incorporates the button 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.050
 on say that a key by 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.910
 approximation in this case the version 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:32.470
 range top as I told you today called 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.090
 titanium has leather upholstery 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.850
 with a seam in red that is left 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.890
 really very good and overall online 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.870
 it is very well change the whole plate 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.820
 on board the entire front plate is 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.250
 practically identical to the party 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:46.810
 kinetic design therefore is much more 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.610
 modern also this vehicle is very 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.040
 well worked also from the 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:53.530
 soundproofing the trunk is somewhat small 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.450
 if you compare it out there with frost ter 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:58.330
 which is the most direct rival has just 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.970
 360 liters that logically can be 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.780
 expand if we lower the rear seats 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.580
 Then I want to tell you that he has 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.590
 16-inch alloy wheels in 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.270
 this case the top of range and I was 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.300
 leaving a security item that is very 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:12.250
 important that are the 6 airbags that this 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:14.440
 version brings for safety and 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:17.670
 logically completes a pretty combo 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.670
 considerable in that aspect 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:25.560
 then we have as final summary a 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.410
 very attractive vehicle that calls a lot 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:30.060
 the attention when they see him on the street 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:31.650
 it's like that kind of vehicle that 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:34.470
 still did not take off from the stage of 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:36.090
 concept because its its lines its forms 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.100
 they are really in some cases 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:42.210
 exaggerated in the best sense of the 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:44.040
 well finished word well equipped in 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.780
 general lines greatly improved the 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:49.170
 Dynamic behavior comfort 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:51.060
 board the security and logically the 

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:53.340
 sensations that you feel at the wheel 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.990
 so the second generation of the core 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:58.050
 for us we tried titanium version 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:05:01.130
 2- liter gasoline engine with 145 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:03.960
 horses manual box that is surpassing 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:06.870
 for a bit the 180 kilometers per hour 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:10.080
 the maximum speed and an acceleration in 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:12.540
 something like 11.5 seconds so from 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.890
 this mode passes the test of a vehicle 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:15.810
 global that is coming to Argentina 

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:18.690
 and that is making its first weapons 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:20.700
 in different continents and with the 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:22.140
 which is better, the brand of what 

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.630
 It has many but many 

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:27.010
 lay expectations 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:27.010
 number 2
