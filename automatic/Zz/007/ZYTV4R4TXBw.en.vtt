00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 hello everyone I'm coming back to you 

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:07.680
 hello everyone i'm coming back to you 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.670
 talk about a palette 6 is the last 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.790
 I will introduce you 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:15.509
 this is my favorite this is the 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:19.289
 original palette originates years because it 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:21.600
 there is no e in late May if you have 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.920
 the same book me it is impossible that 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.930
 you did not like this splendid 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.769
 joystick then I've already made you the 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:31.800
 swatch of swatch and even that here 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:34.500
 as you can see apart from the 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.600
 black there are only iridescent so if you 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.860
 do not like the colors done 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.980
 frankly we do not take it that does not 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.230
 serves as a kidney and for me I try to 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.899
 move arms slowly while remaining 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:50.160
 in the frame but for me frankly 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.410
 there are they are canons of what is I 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.910
 can not tell you much else 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.309
 so I'll try to talk to you about it 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:01.199
 still arm gymnastics so you 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:04.019
 have a little walleye who in the in the 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.040
 pallet is super bright or me he has me a 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.760
 little bit scary I did not use 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:11.930
 right now it's the one that I have 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.400
 not used right now but 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.229
 frankly it is super nice it's 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:22.200
 the one I wear on my eyelids 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:23.549
 today then you have one then 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.350
 it looks like they look like 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.380
 but this one is pink with golden reflections 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:31.200
 and the one next door and pink a lot more 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.509
 cold to redo with white reflections the 200 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.710
 cannon there you have a very orange copper 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:40.470
 there a brown how can I describe it 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.320
 beige brown very very 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.660
 iridescent a case that attracts golden highlights 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.550
 absolutely beautiful and above 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.760
 colors a little more live there it's a 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:53.940
 green and iridescent fir always a blue 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:56.790
 dark turquoise between blue duck one 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.980
 little bit they are also arrived so I 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:02.760
 go to read each time then you 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:03.390
 have blue a sky blue very bright a 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.610
 blue night 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.830
 channel we violated well franc well 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:11.430
 electric and black which is the only 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.720
 matt of this palette here and here where 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.700
 I do not have much else to tell you 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.959
 always the same packaging is not crazy 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.790
 for sure but then I love 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:20.130
 so much colors that I do not care 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.590
 there are two lighthouses that are much more 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:26.070
 powder that others it is this one the 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:29.400
 golden there and this one the rose which is a 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:31.110
 a little colder but frankly that's it 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.790
 it's not very very serious colors 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.330
 in super good when they are on the 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.780
 eyes so 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.700
 so that's the end of my journals 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.560
 6 haye pallets and I did them all 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.790
 there is just one that I have 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.980
 bought and actually I never used 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.050
 it's the snap shot I know it 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.650
 did not inspire me so I sold them 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.239
 directly 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.170
 this is so I tell myself that I am 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:53.400
 not completely crazy am not 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:56.130
 completely dazzled by this cop to the point 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:59.760
 not to have negotiated any more a 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:01.650
 palette that I did not like and that's it 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.420
 so that makes me a person 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.510
 who always had but swords ensures 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.130
 a little bit and then nothing else 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.110
 I hope you enjoyed these little ones 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.480
 reviews I make you big kisses 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.830
 take care of yourself and then tell me if 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.540
 you like it if you want to 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.519
 to crack too much too much 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.820
 shine for you in there I you 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:20.420
 embrace 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.420
 ciao
