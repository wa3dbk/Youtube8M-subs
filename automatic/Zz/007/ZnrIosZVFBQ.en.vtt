00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:17.030
 hi how about everyone in this new video 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:19.370
 tutorial I'm going to show you a little 

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:22.670
 trick to be able to eliminate what is the 

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:25.940
 application cache memory by 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:29.110
 facebook example of whatsapp and so on 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.110
 good let's start 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:35.410
 first of all what we need is 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:38.670
 install two applications 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:43.710
 we need what is this 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.710
 tilt from here 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:50.019
 this is the parade as you well 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:52.420
 you know those cydia installers are 

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:54.010
 they put silvia , they search for it and with 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.199
 the application name and they will 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.410
 install once installed these two 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:58.410
 Applications 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:05.210
 we go to what is here to 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:08.180
 configuration here in general what after 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.430
 abuse here in use in networks and what is 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.700
 the storage of the iphone or 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.700
 iphone 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.590
 which is what it contains that is in use and 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.600
 that is available from memory in 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.330
 this case facebook 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:27.290
 here it tells us that the size to the 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:29.150
 application weight to 102 megabytes and in 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:32.450
 documents and in data is telling us 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:34.310
 that weighs 90 points 5 mb this comes 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.950
 being what is the cache and some 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.869
 data that the application is accumulating 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:41.240
 as we are using it, this is what 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:42.950
 we want to eliminate because this is going 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.860
 consuming memory and memory until 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.570
 it is completely filled the only way 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.100
 eliminate this is eliminating the 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.860
 application 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.560
 but I 'm going to show you a little 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:57.650
 trick to be able to eliminate that cache and 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.960
 thus free memory whenever required 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.600
 no need to delete the application 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.920
 complete and reinstall then 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:08.030
 for this the first thing they have to 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:10.310
 do is go to eve and come file him 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:14.510
 they are going to give here in the house until here 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:17.270
 so that you leave them here in the part 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.250
 main of the main folders 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.230
 level of the year 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.590
 then once being here they will 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.180
 give here in application and as you 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.460
 can see here 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.940
 come folders with numbers and letters 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:34.010
 that are being the folders of the 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:37.070
 applications that have installed in the 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:39.280
 Minutes to be able to see them by names 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.470
 put here 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.120
 and configuration 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.520
 here in configuration gets the 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:48.770
 file manager and here 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:52.570
 you have to activate this box that says 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.570
 the application name know what 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:58.450
 once activated I'm going to put them now 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:01.300
 if folders with names 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.830
 applications then here locate what 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.260
 what is the application that you want 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:07.180
 delete in the cache for example in this 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.300
 case you have to eliminate this from 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:12.880
 facebook then I get here in the 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.740
 folders of the facebook application and what 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:18.390
 respond in any librar and here 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:18.390
 is this folder here 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:26.160
 here in cache where all are accumulated 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:27.840
 the cache files everything 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.630
 have to do is eliminate this 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.400
 folder only this folder have not 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.260
 removed another one because they can cause 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.630
 conflicts with the application and no longer 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.640
 work properly or if they are deleted 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:42.060
 that folder 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:44.940
 once eliminated they leave and return 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:50.120
 again to setup and they are going to give 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:50.120
 count to taste and they will realize 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:59.060
 it releases a little bit of memory they set 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:00.950
 says 77.5 when he says ninety-something 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.350
 so that the cleaning is 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.630
 still more 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:07.750
 are going to get into the next one 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:10.090
 application the second request that is 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:14.769
 tilt 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:18.100
 here I bent you they will give you clean for 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:20.709
 I finished cleaning all the 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.180
 files those that are unnecessary from 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:26.639
 the iphone keys applications are of 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:29.870
 applications and will start to clean 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:29.870
 and these are going to realize 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:36.410
 virtually eliminated all files 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:41.229
 unnecessary in the activist cache 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:41.229
 cache files and the term also 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:46.169
 more than anything is to help this 

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:48.319
 application to eliminate the cache of this 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:48.319
 application 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:02.270
 it's over once the crisis is over 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:06.360
 they restart do not restart 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:08.099
 just put in that they do not come out 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.409
 and they put in again those that 

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:12.270
 configuration to confirm that there 

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:13.530
 removed now if the cache of the 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.000
 application 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:18.930
 probably not completely eliminate 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.659
 but at least they will empty the 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:26.129
 great majority as they are fixed and now only 

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:28.459
 it tells me that I only have 2.1 megabytes 

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:31.289
 as you can see eliminated 

00:05:28.459 --> 00:05:33.929
 very much the book sorry very much 

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:37.469
 memory then you already with that 

00:05:33.929 --> 00:05:38.819
 they prevent the memory from becoming saturated 

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:40.679
 they come to the memory of files 

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:43.349
 unnecessary where they can not do with 

00:05:40.679 --> 00:05:45.709
 whatsapp that they are then can not 

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:50.249
 do know another application 

00:05:45.709 --> 00:05:52.800
 let's say dropbox like I've already 

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:54.659
 made with the vast majority and does not affect 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:58.110
 nothing in the application delete that 

00:05:54.659 --> 00:06:01.679
 cache folder and as last detail it 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:04.649
 I forgot to tell you that it's for 

00:06:01.679 --> 00:06:07.050
 make sure we free the memory well 

00:06:04.649 --> 00:06:11.279
 once deleting the folder they give 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:15.780
 here comes the little house and right here they give it 

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:20.259
 in free and then they give in 

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:21.910
 and file and here in the here is the dumpster 

00:06:20.259 --> 00:06:24.340
 of and file here they have to make sure 

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:27.280
 eliminate what is here in dumpster 

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:30.490
 so that it is completely removed 

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:33.340
 cache of the application and well good that 

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:35.349
 will be all any doubt leave them less 

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:37.960
 know in the comments if he has 

00:06:35.349 --> 00:06:41.409
 liked the video to like it would help me 

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:43.179
 very much and then that will be all 

00:06:41.409 --> 00:06:46.559
 See you in the next videos 

00:06:43.179 --> 00:06:46.559
 Goodbye tutorials
