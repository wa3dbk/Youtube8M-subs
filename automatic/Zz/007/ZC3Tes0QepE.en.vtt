whether it's for men or women I took

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.440 
whether it's for men or women I took
that<00:01:23.250> step<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:23.640> I<00:01:23.700> took<00:01:23.759> that<00:01:24.000> risk

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
that step and I took that risk

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.510 
that step and I took that risk
I<00:01:24.540> started<00:01:24.960> this<00:01:25.049> Academy<00:01:25.560> of<00:01:25.680> my<00:01:25.830> own<00:01:26.070> way

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
I started this Academy of my own way

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.149 
I started this Academy of my own way
back<00:01:26.729> then<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.299> it<00:01:27.750> flopped<00:01:28.320> miserably<00:01:28.500> I

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
back then and it flopped miserably I

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.890 
back then and it flopped miserably I
never<00:01:29.369> doubted<00:01:29.580> about<00:01:30.000> dance<00:01:30.299> and<00:01:30.509> my<00:01:30.659> love

never doubted about dance and my love
for<00:01:31.140> dance<00:01:31.259> but<00:01:31.590> I<00:01:31.619> really<00:01:31.920> doubted<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.400> ways

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
for dance but I really doubted the ways

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.520 
for dance but I really doubted the ways
and<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:32.939> methods<00:01:33.299> I<00:01:33.479> was<00:01:33.869> using<00:01:34.079> to<00:01:34.350> kind<00:01:34.500> of

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
and the methods I was using to kind of

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.890 
and the methods I was using to kind of
get<00:01:34.770> somewhere<00:01:35.220> my<00:01:35.579> ego<00:01:35.970> also<00:01:36.150> got<00:01:36.450> a<00:01:36.479> beating

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
get somewhere my ego also got a beating

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.719 
get somewhere my ego also got a beating
and<00:01:37.079> I<00:01:37.200> was<00:01:37.320> wondering<00:01:37.770> how<00:01:37.799> would<00:01:38.100> get<00:01:38.460> out<00:01:38.579> of

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
and I was wondering how would get out of

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:39.770 
and I was wondering how would get out of
this<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:39.030> then<00:01:39.090> I<00:01:39.180> said<00:01:39.360> okay<00:01:39.540> let<00:01:39.630> me<00:01:39.750> just

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.690 
this and then I said okay let me just
dabble<00:01:40.229> with<00:01:40.259> something<00:01:40.650> else

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700
