00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
big growth are some very very

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.280 
big growth are some very very
sophisticated<00:04:53.160> compared<00:04:54.120> to<00:04:54.180> this<00:04:54.330> who<00:04:55.140> will

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:55.290 
sophisticated compared to this who will

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:57.350 
sophisticated compared to this who will
have<00:04:55.440> all<00:04:55.650> the<00:04:56.070> agility<00:04:56.340> of<00:04:56.550> tetrapack<00:04:57.150> and

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
have all the agility of tetrapack and

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.330 
have all the agility of tetrapack and
they<00:04:58.170> will<00:04:58.320> buy<00:04:58.500> some<00:04:58.830> of<00:04:58.920> your<00:04:58.950> greatest

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
they will buy some of your greatest

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.120 
they will buy some of your greatest
talent<00:05:00.260> and<00:05:01.260> they'll<00:05:01.380> compete<00:05:01.740> with<00:05:01.950> you

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 
talent and they'll compete with you

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:04.700 
talent and they'll compete with you
outside<00:05:03.030> of<00:05:03.090> your<00:05:03.330> original<00:05:03.990> home<00:05:04.020> market<00:05:04.560> and

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710 
outside of your original home market and

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.040 
outside of your original home market and
then<00:05:05.700> knock<00:05:05.910> back<00:05:06.120> their<00:05:06.300> products<00:05:06.630> back<00:05:06.810> into

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.050 
then knock back their products back into

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:10.580 
then knock back their products back into
Europe<00:05:07.640> it's<00:05:08.640> a<00:05:08.760> big<00:05:08.940> challenge<00:05:09.360> and<00:05:09.600> we

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.590 
Europe it's a big challenge and we

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:12.080 
Europe it's a big challenge and we
cannot<00:05:10.860> stand<00:05:11.070> still<00:05:11.220> you<00:05:11.520> know<00:05:11.670> that<00:05:11.850> and

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
cannot stand still you know that and

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.570 
cannot stand still you know that and
that<00:05:12.810> is<00:05:12.960> actually<00:05:13.320> a<00:05:13.500> greatest<00:05:14.190> threat<00:05:14.400> to

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
that is actually a greatest threat to

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.270 
that is actually a greatest threat to
you<00:05:14.700> so<00:05:14.940> that<00:05:15.750> your<00:05:15.930> current<00:05:16.230> technology<00:05:16.770> will

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 
you so that your current technology will

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.490 
you so that your current technology will
be<00:05:17.400> copied<00:05:17.960> turn<00:05:18.960> around

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 
be copied turn around

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.380 
be copied turn around
slightly<00:05:20.130> inferior<00:05:20.520> version<00:05:21.000> will<00:05:21.120> be<00:05:21.150> put

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:21.390 
slightly inferior version will be put

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:22.880 
slightly inferior version will be put
back<00:05:21.540> out<00:05:21.720> but<00:05:21.960> it'll<00:05:22.110> be<00:05:22.200> one<00:05:22.380> third<00:05:22.620> of<00:05:22.830> the

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:22.890 
back out but it'll be one third of the

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:25.940 
back out but it'll be one third of the
price<00:05:23.900> so<00:05:24.900> we<00:05:24.990> have<00:05:25.110> these<00:05:25.230> two<00:05:25.470> tech<00:05:25.680> spec

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:25.950 
price so we have these two tech spec

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:27.560 
price so we have these two tech spec
worlds<00:05:26.340> that<00:05:26.490> develops<00:05:26.880> and<00:05:27.000> the<00:05:27.060> undeveloped

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:33.090 
where will the energy be is it even

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:34.490 
where will the energy be is it even
worth<00:05:33.240> having<00:05:33.600> a<00:05:33.690> European<00:05:34.170> version<00:05:34.290> of

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:34.500 
worth having a European version of

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.400 
worth having a European version of
tetrapack<00:05:34.890> on<00:05:35.130> current<00:05:35.460> trends<00:05:35.610> probably<00:05:36.000> not

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:36.410 
tetrapack on current trends probably not

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:38.570 
tetrapack on current trends probably not
according<00:05:37.410> to<00:05:37.500> you<00:05:37.590> guys<00:05:37.770> no<00:05:38.250> one's<00:05:38.400> going<00:05:38.550> to

according to you guys no one's going to

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:39.830 
according to you guys no one's going to
be<00:05:38.670> living<00:05:38.850> in<00:05:39.000> Europe<00:05:39.300> there<00:05:39.570> won't<00:05:39.690> be<00:05:39.750> a
