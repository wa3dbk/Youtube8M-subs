00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:32.010
 car 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:38.180
 Well this is the place to go easily if you have a peer eye first of all 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:38.180
 The movie sticks on that 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.170
 I like this too 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.880
 Well this is still Chapter 1 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:06.420
 It became a short lively though 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.420
 I wonder how far I will go 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:15.000
 I will keep in children straight hair 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:17.300
 Well in this area that Chapter 1 clear 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:24.260
 It is the mainstream this time Well 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:27.170
 There's always a fight scene for each chapter, so if you're a bit lively 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:31.370
 I think it makes sense 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:37.290
 Well this time with Kazuo Yayoi 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:42.230

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:42.230
