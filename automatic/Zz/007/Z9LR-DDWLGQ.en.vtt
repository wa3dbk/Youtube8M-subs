 this is the game watch version ball is 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.140
 a faithful reproduction we can say 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.920
 of the game watch is not the original one is 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:41.250
 but 20 years ago but almost 3 30 years 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.559
 it is because we are talking about 1980 so about 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.520
 30 years ago and it arrived thanks to the 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.670
 collection of points 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:51.420

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:54.180
 I have collected 7500 points if I'm not mistaken 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.449
 there are around 250 of them 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.940

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:08.100
 I mean 250 points or 200 for wii not me 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.570
 I remember now well and I gathering 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.010
 slowly the points decided to 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.390
 take this wonder for me is 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.189
 just a wonder indeed a 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.509
 beautiful a beautiful production 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.939
 so let's put some detail into how 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.970
 the little box is made and then we proceed 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:23.040
 unboxing here is the wall there 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.400
 front part we say to see right 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:32.130

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:35.340
 its branded beauty if it leaves 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:39.150
 he understands my moore then back here 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:42.689
 instead we all have them all 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.700
 the features we say in English there 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:48.689
 says how to operate it practically 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:51.540
 we have to remove the tongue la 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:54.360
 bullhound tongue ciancitto chumby for 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:57.570
 you and I know we pull away and then 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.210
 other things ok all the club 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.640
 nintendo reminds us of where 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.490
 we took it mou is this and the club 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.110
 nintendo 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.520
 american but we went on the star 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.200
 catalog of editions, of course 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:13.690
 Italian we don't have a bit to see 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.730
 opening it we have this beautiful 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:21.500
 special thanks to you with the two 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:23.180
 play figures just your own 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.569
 we open we find a lot of 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.099
 manuals here are many ad 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:31.970
 a little further back for the camera 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:34.040
 here we find so many booklets of 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.519
 user manual instructions made here 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:40.330
 that I don't know in what language 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:44.360
 then the use manual I think Spanish 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:45.799
 modem floyd manuel de tantissimi 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.810
 anyway up to that 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:49.340
 I believe the manual is correct 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:53.780
 of actual instructions we see a 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:55.850
 we deprive it of course that opens 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:59.000
 in a thousand and one thousand parts and I will not succeed 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:01.489
 after put it in the position you do n't have 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.459
 quite simple to put back is 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:06.860
 bent only in three parts we have the 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:10.609
 presentation of the game watch version 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:13.640
 ball nintendo of europe is contained 

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:15.380
 all city ​​tells us practically which 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.630
 so the keys are the whole manual 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.850
 how it is done 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:23.060
 obviously this is a little bit 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:25.640
 lcd screen then tells us the button panel is 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:28.549
 provided with five buttons plus one 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:31.370
 button key to cl that sets then 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:33.440
 aircraft combines then we said a 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.239
 indeed, the digital display 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.920
 present that will give us the opportunity to 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:39.260
 see our score at four 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.720
 figures also include the time 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.280
 now let's go straight to see the 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.970
 console in all its beauty 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:50.560
 Mini mostly console then that 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:52.209
 is contained in this beautiful 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.240
 cellophane 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:59.480
 here it is 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:02.030
 then here it is as I was saying throughout 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.190
 her beauty is a faithful one 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:07.400
 very very nice reproduction like 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:10.700
 I also said these game watch by now 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:14.090
 they are quite quite rare 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:15.320
 were produced from 1980 until 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:19.670
 1991 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:22.010
 so 21 years of production and this is 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:23.690
 one of the first if not the first now not 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:27.580
 I honestly know, however, I really think the 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.580
 first let's see in detail 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:36.350
 part of the main cover made like this 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:37.970
 back instead there is a bit of 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:40.669
 let's see if we can read 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:45.260
 something doesn't come out of my head 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:47.210
 then that in watch model no rgb ok le 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.590
 batteries however is always well on dates 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:51.950
 at the club, nintendo therefore makes us understand 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:53.000
 this is a fair fair copy 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:56.950
 tongue I told you before 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.390
 let's get my play started right away 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:04.040
 here we can decide the type of game 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:06.850
 by mag in b and the time i love we love 

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:09.770
 this faithful reproduction 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:11.750
 let's just move obviously and 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:15.800
 take the bales and the words about the 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:18.680
 bars and this is the first game i 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:20.630
 it seems he only has these two 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:24.169
 we can only move to the right left 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:25.430
 once we move only a few 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:27.650
 direction instead it seems to me that the game b 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:28.760
 it also makes our hands widen more 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:32.210
 obviously as you can see also 

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:34.160
 increases the speed of the balls and man 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:37.100
 hand that goes on with the game I think 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:40.729
 just that the speed also increases e 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:45.650
 the number of balls I'm showing 

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:48.440
 all here ok I have to take the time 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:52.790
 settle it I know what it was instead 

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:57.610
 than with three balls and even more 

00:05:52.790 --> 00:06:01.220
 difficult 8 but it is very nice 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:04.159
 oh well then guys and everything as I have 

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:07.370

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:09.199
 home this beautiful little thing to me 

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:12.650
 really like looking for it for a long time as I have 

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:15.289
 already said I made so much effort both at 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:18.800
 set aside all 7500 points though 

00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:21.080
 not too much and no kids there 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:22.639
