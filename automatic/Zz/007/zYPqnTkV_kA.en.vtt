00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:14.429
 yes hello and welcome 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:20.010
 Today we'll do a video about that 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:21.740
 differential and we were asked if 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.840
 make a little video again 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:27.619
 and now I was in favor of it 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.949
 differentiated apart 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:33.600
 For example, we have a little here 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:36.260
 differential where the stock is therefore up 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.210
 Of course that will be a bit finished 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.520
 Can you see that ? I hope so now 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:47.100
 here were on the axis rotate 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:50.100
 here are the gears if you like the whole 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.469
 before it looks like this 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.100
 from that I have no dirty fingers here 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:01:03.600
 wars that is almost the differential 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:06.750
 that is so together we still have potential 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.549
 is held together by these little ones 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.750
 screw 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:12.810
 if I put those in here so we build 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.790
 I'll take you out of here 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.530
 I can unscrew this upper one 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.250
 cover this upper number trans decrease 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.030
 and I have these timing belts here 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.229
 just a little bit of the seal 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.820
 take care that of course does not fit 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.820
 Of course, this is always China 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:34.790
 I wear this on this would have to 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.790
 actually fit 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:41.140
 that is the differential that is here in the 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:44.290
 in the box here in it 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.049
 Here we are in there we have one more 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:51.250
 counterpart here comes the wave against 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:53.409
 this is the wave in here now 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.690
 then she turns all the stuff 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:57.270
 this way the engine becomes so 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:00.640
 driven 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:03.430
 now the question was here in the 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.580
 differential are two small ones 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.539
 selected slices in it 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:12.330
 they are with me from the country at 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:14.680
 disassemble also flown out and 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.260
 I think that's it 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.120
 just makes sense that these two 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.690
 slices this victory live here 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.620
 together 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:27.430
 these two slices that hit those 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:32.260
 side of the gear on it belong the 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:35.590
 come over here and like me 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.940
 See are the chosen stop the run 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.040
 So the light in here 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.299
 they are chosen for the reason and 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.100
 come also from the reason on this 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:44.410
 page 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:46.110
 So that these two discs are the gear 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:49.329
 push in this direction 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:51.489
 that is when the educator team is running 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:53.680
 that the pressure rises here and that the 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:55.930
 Pressure does not go away because otherwise 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.329
 Here you can between the between the 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.680
 gears and if there is one now 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:01.000
 there is a little bit of air in between 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.870
 tremble and we would each 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.190
 great wear 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:07.480
 That's why I think that this 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.380
 on this side come with that 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.940
 is pressed over it 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.200
 I also had the problem that it 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.760
 has fallen off or where I am 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.799
 not sure where your hands are coming from 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.120
 but if you like that I have one 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:18.130
 thought through a bit and thought 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.140
 I tried that, I think 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:23.489
 so sure what's on the side 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.489
 That is the only thing that is 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:28.530
 of course now a friemel id on it 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:28.530
 to get 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:35.510
 that is of course difficult now 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.640
 they know exactly under this adjustment 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:40.010
 here 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:43.400
 That they are chosen is always 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:46.180
 maybe fiddle a bit like that 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:50.230
 I'll get that now 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:56.510
 that is as I said it is just modellbau 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:59.950
 There you before in here I try 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.950
 make it so here to press 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:07.340
 now this is going to look different in here 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:09.250
 we the spanier this distance if I 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.420
 Now this cover here on it 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.530
 Now this guide is in there too 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.830
 I want to get sand out of here 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:18.770
 then pressure is built up here 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:24.920
 and the gearwheel is then in this 

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:26.420
 pushed direction so that is here 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.890
 because here in between these 

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:29.330
 Both gears that he has no air 

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:34.640
 arises and the really nice clean 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:37.130
 run black so that was now thing 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:38.720
 So I'm holding the two giants 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:39.890
 the opinion works but the only thing 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.780
 makes sense I had tried 

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:44.540
 the two on the side or individually 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:46.190
 but it just fits that way and it does 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:50.360
 actually just makes it so look 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:57.560
 the pressure goes on so everyone gets 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:05:02.660
 Cover it again and then we have 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:04.730
 here the prevention has to be the whole only 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:07.370
 still to be assembled there are too 

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:08.380
 still fat that can do it 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:10.669
 There are also different ones 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:12.980
 viscous bit harder bit 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:14.810
 softer but I think he does 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:16.760
 really only performance areas 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:19.280
 are really racehorse but so for a 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:21.500
 Hobby area is completely sufficient 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:24.260
 the beautifully lubricated beautifully greased 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:25.430
 has always been important in assembling 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:28.720
 make sure that he does not sand 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:31.070
 come in or what do I know what's coming 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:34.310
 now that he's about in there 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:37.100
 here comes the wave then it sits 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:40.280
 because then the engine and then 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:42.340
 the halt driven so that hest 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:46.730
 Mahler video about the diff 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:51.200
 I hope that helped and 

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:53.750
 the potential a few pictures for his 

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:55.100
 photo series, we put it all in it 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:56.390
 we have taken another one apart 

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:59.990
 bit cleaned because it was totally 

00:05:56.390 --> 00:06:01.340
 dirty everything and are barely any more videos 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:03.740
 or what might probably 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:05.630
 videos come over the bumpers 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:07.670
 they are also made new 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:10.910
 pretty over there and always has to see 

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:12.320
 like that with those from the oil in it 

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:14.830
 is and the attitude that after 

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.830
 ground clearance 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:23.210
 otherwise wish you a nice 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:25.570
 a happy new year and the first one 

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:25.570
 form
