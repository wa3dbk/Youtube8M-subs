00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 eight sacks of stubble and I decided to do 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.020
 a very simple hairstyle that unites two 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.550
 tendencies coke and braid it is much more 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.469
 easy because I'm not going to use all my 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.719
 hair will use only half of it I go 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:16.109
 start with a modeling 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:18.770
 help attach the wires and also take the 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.770
 cold of my hair 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:30.929
 I'll apply here in this part by playing a 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:36.239
 back with the help of a 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:39.050
 brush I'm going to comb my hair is to leave 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.050
 well aligned 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:52.540
 now I will learn with elastic 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:53.980
 done hair I 'll do a braid 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.190
 with that part that I learned from my 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.190
 hair 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.990
 to learn the child with elastic 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.880
 Now I'm going to twist that braid to 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.909
 our court is doing with 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.420
 she does not get a lot of volume 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:29.860
 very big and I will not squeeze so much 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.670
 I'm going to hide the edge of my 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:36.119
 braid here inside you cop and learn 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.119

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.860

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.600
