um yeah and so what can I say it's a

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:20.520 
um yeah and so what can I say it's a
great<00:01:19.000> deal<00:01:19.150> to<00:01:19.300> it<00:01:19.390> i'm<00:01:19.510> not<00:01:19.540> totally<00:01:19.960> keen<00:01:20.350> on

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.610 
great deal to it i'm not totally keen on
its<00:01:20.710> slightly<00:01:21.100> smaller<00:01:21.490> than<00:01:21.610> some<00:01:21.910> of<00:01:22.030> the<00:01:22.090> am

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:22.620 
its slightly smaller than some of the am

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.530 
its slightly smaller than some of the am

obviously those slightly downsize them
slightly<00:01:27.700> um<00:01:28.890> so<00:01:29.890> we'll<00:01:30.040> see<00:01:30.130> that<00:01:30.310> is<00:01:30.460> a<00:01:30.490> bit

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:30.730 
slightly um so we'll see that is a bit

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:31.980 
slightly um so we'll see that is a bit

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
is a great little truck mode very

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.990 
is a great little truck mode very
reminiscent<00:01:50.560> of<00:01:50.860> ultra<00:01:51.250> magnus<00:01:51.580> especially

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
reminiscent of ultra magnus especially

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.840 
reminiscent of ultra magnus especially
in<00:01:52.060> robot<00:01:52.390> mode<00:01:52.420> um<00:01:53.409> it's<00:01:54.250> not<00:01:54.370> too<00:01:54.490> bad<00:01:54.610> as<00:01:54.790> you

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
in robot mode um it's not too bad as you

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.219 
in robot mode um it's not too bad as you
might<00:01:55.000> get<00:01:55.150> the<00:01:55.210> red<00:01:55.360> probe<00:01:55.570> labels<00:01:55.930> for<00:01:56.110> this

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
might get the red probe labels for this

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:58.160 
might get the red probe labels for this
guy<00:01:56.409> this<00:01:56.470> that<00:01:56.890> you<00:01:56.979> does<00:01:57.159> look<00:01:57.370> pretty<00:01:57.490> cool

about it in this mode those are pretty

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.229 
about it in this mode those are pretty
cool<00:02:07.649> alright<00:02:08.649> and<00:02:08.679> a<00:02:08.830> transmit<00:02:09.190> very<00:02:09.549> quickly

cool alright and a transmit very quickly

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:13.110 
cool alright and a transmit very quickly
should<00:02:10.989> be<00:02:11.049> that<00:02:11.170> hard<00:02:11.440> I'm<00:02:12.400> gonna<00:02:12.849> can<00:02:13.060> I

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
should be that hard I'm gonna can I

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.280 
should be that hard I'm gonna can I
rotate<00:02:13.569> these<00:02:13.750> knees<00:02:14.049> around<00:02:14.290> here<00:02:16.200> get<00:02:17.200> the

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
rotate these knees around here get the

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.229 
rotate these knees around here get the
feet<00:02:17.530> push<00:02:18.310> these<00:02:18.489> all<00:02:18.640> the<00:02:18.760> way<00:02:18.849> back

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:24.839 

somehow<00:02:22.290> get<00:02:23.290> some<00:02:23.620> waste<00:02:24.040> section<00:02:24.519> bring<00:02:24.760> it

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:24.849 
somehow get some waste section bring it

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:30.780 
somehow get some waste section bring it
forwards<00:02:26.400> separate<00:02:27.400> the<00:02:27.519> legs<00:02:27.760> ah<00:02:29.730> then<00:02:30.730> we're

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
forwards separate the legs ah then we're

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.440 
forwards separate the legs ah then we're
going<00:02:30.939> to<00:02:31.030> separate<00:02:31.510> these<00:02:31.689> little<00:02:32.049> bits<00:02:32.349> here

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
going to separate these little bits here

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.459 
going to separate these little bits here
just<00:02:34.450> disconnect<00:02:34.930> the<00:02:35.049> arms<00:02:35.319> they're

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:35.469 
just disconnect the arms they're

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:39.959 
just disconnect the arms they're
slightly<00:02:37.769> rotate<00:02:38.769> them<00:02:38.980> around<00:02:39.069> a<00:02:39.549> conscious

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:39.969 
slightly rotate them around a conscious

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:41.819 
slightly rotate them around a conscious
way<00:02:40.150> way<00:02:40.359> it<00:02:40.480> goes<00:02:40.659> there<00:02:40.959> we<00:02:41.079> can<00:02:41.200> rotate<00:02:41.469> them

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:41.829 
way way it goes there we can rotate them

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:45.569 
way way it goes there we can rotate them
around<00:02:43.349> like<00:02:44.349> that<00:02:44.590> nice<00:02:44.950> setting<00:02:45.250> up<00:02:45.400> there

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:45.579 
around like that nice setting up there

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:50.699 
around like that nice setting up there
we<00:02:45.670> go<00:02:48.150> nitrates<00:02:49.150> and<00:02:49.450> is<00:02:49.719> here<00:02:50.200> and<00:02:50.560> then

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
we go nitrates and is here and then

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:53.129 
we go nitrates and is here and then
rotate<00:02:51.430> them<00:02:51.579> around<00:02:51.639> at<00:02:52.000> the<00:02:52.090> elbows<00:02:52.569> as<00:02:52.870> well

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:53.139 
rotate them around at the elbows as well

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:56.909 
rotate them around at the elbows as well
let's<00:02:53.470> talk<00:02:53.560> about<00:02:53.680> that<00:02:53.859> oh<00:02:55.409> that's<00:02:56.409> his<00:02:56.650> arm

00:02:56.909 --> 00:02:56.919 
let's talk about that oh that's his arm

00:02:56.919 --> 00:03:00.869 
let's talk about that oh that's his arm
sort<00:02:57.310> of<00:02:57.400> done<00:02:57.609> then<00:02:58.359> we<00:02:58.480> got<00:02:58.659> raised<00:02:59.609> some<00:03:00.609> bit

00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:00.879 
sort of done then we got raised some bit

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:06.360 
sort of done then we got raised some bit
up<00:03:01.000> around<00:03:01.329> irritatingly<00:03:04.859> Sammy<00:03:05.859> I<00:03:06.040> would<00:03:06.219> do

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
up around irritatingly Sammy I would do

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.869 
up around irritatingly Sammy I would do
this<00:03:07.889> absently<00:03:08.889> raised<00:03:09.159> these<00:03:09.400> little<00:03:09.790> what

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:09.879 
this absently raised these little what

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:12.629 
this absently raised these little what
exerted<00:03:10.480> up<00:03:10.780> heads<00:03:11.230> up<00:03:11.409> hidden<00:03:11.620> and<00:03:12.400> then<00:03:12.519> this

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:12.639 
exerted up heads up hidden and then this

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:15.209 
exerted up heads up hidden and then this
pushes<00:03:13.090> whole<00:03:13.269> section<00:03:13.810> up<00:03:13.959> I'm<00:03:14.409> at<00:03:14.709> lots<00:03:14.950> to

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:15.219 
pushes whole section up I'm at lots to

00:03:15.219 --> 00:03:18.800 
pushes whole section up I'm at lots to
place<00:03:15.519> them<00:03:15.790> around<00:03:15.879> there<00:03:17.159> don't<00:03:18.159> know<00:03:18.219> why

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
place them around there don't know why

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.210 
place them around there don't know why
this<00:03:19.810> section<00:03:20.319> doesn't<00:03:20.530> want<00:03:20.739> to<00:03:20.829> fit<00:03:21.099> in<00:03:21.129> now

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
this section doesn't want to fit in now

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.229 
this section doesn't want to fit in now
anyway<00:03:24.220> that<00:03:24.519> does<00:03:24.699> get<00:03:24.909> around<00:03:24.970> here

somewhere I thought it's supposed to

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:30.479 
somewhere I thought it's supposed to
look<00:03:26.949> into<00:03:27.159> place<00:03:27.370> bills<00:03:27.639> he<00:03:27.849> not<00:03:28.060> I<00:03:29.489> bring

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
look into place bills he not I bring

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:36.669 
and that is basically your ultra magnus

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:39.360 
and that is basically your ultra magnus
in<00:03:36.909> robot<00:03:37.419> mode<00:03:37.449> and<00:03:37.989> it's<00:03:38.769> actually<00:03:39.129> pretty

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
in robot mode and it's actually pretty

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.129

reminiscent of ultra magnus there I

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:52.860 
reminiscent of ultra magnus there I
believe<00:03:52.090> the<00:03:52.209> instructions<00:03:52.629> say<00:03:52.810> you

believe the instructions say you

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:54.390 
believe the instructions say you
supposed<00:03:53.199> to<00:03:53.259> put<00:03:53.470> these<00:03:53.709> things<00:03:53.949> down<00:03:54.129> to<00:03:54.189> the

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
obviously the war for cybertron cuz it

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.980 
obviously the war for cybertron cuz it
is<00:04:46.620> slightly<00:04:47.190> a<00:04:47.460> different<00:04:47.550> mold<00:04:48.060> and<00:04:48.930> I

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
is slightly a different mold and I

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.700 
is slightly a different mold and I
thought<00:04:49.169> that'd<00:04:49.290> be<00:04:49.470> pretty<00:04:49.770> cool<00:04:51.500> you<00:04:52.500> cannot

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
thought that'd be pretty cool you cannot

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.170 
thought that'd be pretty cool you cannot
go<00:04:52.919> wrong<00:04:52.950> and<00:04:53.220> then<00:04:53.340> you<00:04:53.460> can<00:04:53.610> as<00:04:53.850> a<00:04:53.880> size

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
go wrong and then you can as a size

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.510 
go wrong and then you can as a size
comparison<00:04:54.360> obviously<00:04:55.110> there's<00:04:55.290> a<00:04:55.380> full<00:04:56.340> for

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
comparison obviously there's a full for

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.180 
comparison obviously there's a full for
Cybertron<00:04:56.970> shockwave<00:04:57.860> obviously<00:04:58.860> the<00:04:59.010> same

00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.190 
Cybertron shockwave obviously the same

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:01.280
