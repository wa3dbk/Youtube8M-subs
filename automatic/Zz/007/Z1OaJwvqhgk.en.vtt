it was that your knees coming together
not<00:00:53.839> go<00:00:54.110> apart<00:00:54.559> if<00:00:54.710> you<00:00:54.800> remember<00:00:55.070> when<00:00:55.190> your

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
stance and we don't like that at all

stance and we don't like that at all
today<00:00:59.030> we're<00:00:59.540> looking<00:00:59.629> at<00:00:59.809> your<00:00:59.989> hands<00:01:00.789> the

today we're looking at your hands the
real<00:01:02.030> thing<00:01:02.420> here<00:01:02.719> is<00:01:02.989> it's<00:01:03.230> just<00:01:03.289> like<00:01:03.590> with

real thing here is it's just like with
your<00:01:03.859> knees<00:01:04.160> your<00:01:04.729> instincts<00:01:05.330> really<00:01:05.509> let<00:01:05.810> you

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
your knees your instincts really let you

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.600 
your knees your instincts really let you
down<00:01:05.990> it's<00:01:06.500> one<00:01:06.770> of<00:01:06.860> those<00:01:06.920> things<00:01:07.220> you're<00:01:07.429> not

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
down it's one of those things you're not

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.580 
down it's one of those things you're not
going<00:01:07.789> to<00:01:07.850> get<00:01:07.970> right<00:01:08.330> just<00:01:08.840> by<00:01:09.020> doing<00:01:09.080> it<00:01:09.470> over

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
going to get right just by doing it over

going to get right just by doing it over
and<00:01:09.770> over<00:01:09.920> again<00:01:10.009> you<00:01:10.610> need<00:01:10.789> to<00:01:10.880> consciously

00:01:11.169 --> 00:01:11.179 
and over again you need to consciously

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:13.359 
and over again you need to consciously
think<00:01:11.539> about<00:01:11.990> what<00:01:12.410> you're<00:01:12.560> doing<00:01:12.830> so<00:01:13.130> this<00:01:13.220> is

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
think about what you're doing so this is

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:14.560 
think about what you're doing so this is
where<00:01:13.550> these<00:01:13.640> instincts<00:01:14.060> letting<00:01:14.330> you<00:01:14.390> down

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
where these instincts letting you down

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.090 
where these instincts letting you down
what<00:01:15.110> you're<00:01:15.259> interesting<00:01:15.590> to<00:01:15.679> tell<00:01:15.890> you<00:01:15.979> to

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
what you're interesting to tell you to

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.700 
what you're interesting to tell you to
do<00:01:16.280> is<00:01:16.520> to<00:01:16.970> sort<00:01:17.149> of<00:01:17.240> have<00:01:17.720> you<00:01:17.899> both<00:01:18.140> hands<00:01:18.590> on

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
do is to sort of have you both hands on

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.380 
do is to sort of have you both hands on
one<00:01:18.860> side<00:01:19.160> of<00:01:19.280> the<00:01:19.340> board<00:01:19.580> kind<00:01:19.880> of<00:01:19.970> like<00:01:20.149> this

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
one side of the board kind of like this

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.440 
one side of the board kind of like this
and<00:01:20.679> what<00:01:21.679> then<00:01:21.979> happens<00:01:22.490> is<00:01:22.670> that<00:01:23.300> you're

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
and what then happens is that you're

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.240 
and what then happens is that you're
trying<00:01:23.570> to<00:01:23.690> balance<00:01:23.929> using<00:01:24.380> your<00:01:24.679> bun<00:01:24.920> in<00:01:25.220> your

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
trying to balance using your bun in your

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.100 
trying to balance using your bun in your
head<00:01:25.610> so<00:01:25.880> you're<00:01:26.030> sort<00:01:26.179> of<00:01:26.270> wobbling

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
head so you're sort of wobbling

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.529 
head so you're sort of wobbling
backwards<00:01:27.649> and<00:01:27.800> forwards<00:01:28.250> like<00:01:28.460> this<00:01:28.729> the

00:01:29.529 --> 00:01:29.539 
backwards and forwards like this the

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:31.330 
backwards and forwards like this the
golden<00:01:29.960> rule<00:01:30.170> with<00:01:30.380> surfing<00:01:30.890> is<00:01:31.039> that<00:01:31.070> your

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
golden rule with surfing is that your

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.990 
golden rule with surfing is that your
leading<00:01:31.640> hand<00:01:32.209> must<00:01:33.050> be<00:01:33.140> outside<00:01:34.130> your<00:01:34.520> heel

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
leading hand must be outside your heel

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.779 
leading hand must be outside your heel
rail<00:01:35.660> so<00:01:36.170> just<00:01:36.739> stop<00:01:37.009> and<00:01:37.190> think<00:01:37.399> about<00:01:37.640> that

00:01:37.779 --> 00:01:37.789 
rail so just stop and think about that

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:39.940 
rail so just stop and think about that
for<00:01:37.849> a<00:01:38.090> moment<00:01:38.270> if<00:01:38.630> you're<00:01:38.810> a<00:01:38.840> goofy<00:01:39.410> footer<00:01:39.649> if

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
for a moment if you're a goofy footer if

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.070 
for a moment if you're a goofy footer if
you<00:01:40.099> put<00:01:40.310> your<00:01:40.459> right<00:01:40.759> foot<00:01:40.789> forward<00:01:41.119> it<00:01:41.660> means

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
you put your right foot forward it means

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.960 
you put your right foot forward it means
your<00:01:42.229> right<00:01:42.530> hand<00:01:42.890> is<00:01:43.130> going<00:01:43.459> to<00:01:43.520> be<00:01:43.610> on<00:01:43.849> the

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
your right hand is going to be on the

your right hand is going to be on the
right<00:01:44.300> hand<00:01:44.660> side<00:01:44.959> of<00:01:45.110> the<00:01:45.259> board<00:01:45.500> if<00:01:45.890> you're

00:01:46.059 --> 00:01:46.069 
right hand side of the board if you're

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:48.309

if<00:01:46.459> you're<00:01:46.489> a<00:01:46.670> natural<00:01:47.660> footer<00:01:47.899> and<00:01:48.020> you<00:01:48.080> put

if you're a natural footer and you put

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:49.870 
if you're a natural footer and you put

might be a forehand cut back it might be

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:10.319 
might be a forehand cut back it might be
a<00:03:08.439> backhand<00:03:08.980> bottom<00:03:09.340> term<00:03:09.579> it<00:03:10.030> might<00:03:10.180> be<00:03:10.299> a
