of<00:00:36.770> the<00:00:36.860> time<00:00:37.070> it<00:00:37.280> doesn't<00:00:37.309> work<00:00:37.700> perfectly

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:38.320 
of the time it doesn't work perfectly

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.599 
of the time it doesn't work perfectly
this<00:00:39.320> is<00:00:39.469> because<00:00:39.770> the<00:00:39.920> shadows<00:00:40.129> are<00:00:40.429> all

00:00:40.599 --> 00:00:40.609 
this is because the shadows are all

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:42.729 
this is because the shadows are all
applied<00:00:40.940> the<00:00:41.120> same<00:00:41.149> way<00:00:41.539> no<00:00:42.109> matter<00:00:42.289> what<00:00:42.469> part

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:45.009 
applied the same way no matter what part
of<00:00:42.769> the<00:00:42.829> body<00:00:43.010> is<00:00:43.280> but<00:00:44.269> if<00:00:44.329> you<00:00:44.420> watch<00:00:44.600> in<00:00:44.809> any

00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:45.019 
of the body is but if you watch in any

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:47.049 
of the body is but if you watch in any
mage<00:00:45.260> you<00:00:45.829> can<00:00:45.980> see<00:00:46.190> that<00:00:46.429> that<00:00:46.460> is<00:00:46.730> not<00:00:46.909> how

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:47.059 
mage you can see that that is not how

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:49.720 
mage you can see that that is not how
they<00:00:47.179> do<00:00:47.239> it<00:00:47.480> they<00:00:48.350> actually<00:00:48.890> apply<00:00:49.249> shadows

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
they do it they actually apply shadows

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.090 
they do it they actually apply shadows
in<00:00:49.909> different<00:00:50.269> ways<00:00:50.390> you<00:00:51.320> often<00:00:51.649> don't<00:00:51.859> see

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
in different ways you often don't see

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.189 
in different ways you often don't see
shadows<00:00:52.489> on<00:00:52.670> their<00:00:52.819> faces<00:00:53.059> and<00:00:53.449> there<00:00:54.109> are

00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:54.199 
shadows on their faces and there are

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:55.899 
shadows on their faces and there are
never<00:00:54.379> any<00:00:54.469> strokes<00:00:55.039> that<00:00:55.129> go<00:00:55.370> into<00:00:55.519> the<00:00:55.699> hair

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:55.909 
never any strokes that go into the hair

00:00:55.909 --> 00:00:58.360 
never any strokes that go into the hair
this<00:00:56.870> is<00:00:57.050> why<00:00:57.199> we<00:00:57.379> decided<00:00:57.559> to<00:00:57.920> have<00:00:58.010> multiple

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
this is why we decided to have multiple

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.759 
this is why we decided to have multiple
kinds<00:00:58.670> of<00:00:58.909> shaders<00:00:59.170> we<00:01:00.170> have<00:01:00.319> one<00:01:00.530> for<00:01:00.679> the

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:00.769 
kinds of shaders we have one for the

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:03.219 
kinds of shaders we have one for the
hair<00:01:00.949> one<00:01:01.609> for<00:01:01.819> the<00:01:01.909> skin<00:01:02.210> and<00:01:02.539> one<00:01:02.989> for<00:01:03.140> the

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:03.229 
hair one for the skin and one for the

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:06.550 
hair one for the skin and one for the
clothes<00:01:03.879> combining<00:01:04.879> this<00:01:05.210> allowed<00:01:06.020> us<00:01:06.050> to<00:01:06.260> get

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
clothes combining this allowed us to get

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.830 
clothes combining this allowed us to get
the<00:01:06.650> 3d<00:01:07.010> models<00:01:07.430> looking<00:01:08.150> really<00:01:08.330> close<00:01:08.659> to

while the backgrounds have a more
hand-drawn<00:01:22.189> field<00:01:22.899> so<00:01:23.899> we<00:01:24.200> went<00:01:24.350> with<00:01:24.560> the

00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:24.649 
hand-drawn field so we went with the

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:28.510 
hand-drawn field so we went with the
same<00:01:24.860> idea<00:01:25.250> for<00:01:25.549> arguing<00:01:26.259> this<00:01:27.259> is<00:01:27.469> why<00:01:27.680> in<00:01:28.340> our

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
actually worked very well for us because

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.499 
actually worked very well for us because
it<00:01:36.350> made<00:01:36.530> the<00:01:36.680> characters<00:01:36.920> pop<00:01:37.369> out<00:01:37.609> and<00:01:38.329> at
