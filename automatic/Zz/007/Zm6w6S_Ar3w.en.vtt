 they tell a few things apart and that is 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:33.320

 I know that if you notice me the audio is better 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.990
 because I change helmets right now 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.030
 I'm using the 720 writings that 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.320
 Print 3 used the better because I do not 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.840

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:02.270

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:04.850
 years since they no longer drink, they do not go anymore 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.280
 are broken the wire is broken the micro 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.869

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.630
 reflected enough in the videos worth 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.100
 well does video of the supplies that 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.290
 what it takes to record what I think 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.560
 it was an hour for the sound since it was 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.200
 record 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.020
 schwazer to a bad part and then I left it 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:24.440
 pass because I could not take it anymore and good 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.730
 let's go with the dna, it's worth it 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.220
 the newts commented and that 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.020
 I'll soon sell I'll 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.090

 video my reasons and all that topic but 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.810
 the ones used are really new 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:38.540
 two or three times nothing more good three 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:41.209
 Sometimes it's not worth 10 to 10 as very 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.830
 little seriously very little axis and 2 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.989
 relearn is worth and if you are interested then 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.150
 you know they are valued at 280 euros and 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:49.819
 those selling for 100 euros the truth is 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.890
 a quite high discount that well then 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:53.900

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.730
 so I will talk to you 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.470
 more quietly and all that subject is 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.720
 so really new the instructions 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.690

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:05.410

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:11.170
 and let's talk about the dna has been 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:15.400
 here in detroit domain heading with the 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:16.900
 asm 1 today the strike la la speakeasy 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.360
 that I sold it without wanting yes sir 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.830
 I'm a crack and I was here 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.870
 normal game in a game because 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:25.210
 I started quite by hand I started very and not 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.580
 I think they are 67 times the truth 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:29.590
 painful but thanks in my classmates 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:33.610
 Well, I knew how to keep serious 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.840
 thank you very much again to manel ya marx 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.420
 If I do not say it, I do not agree now 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.580
 same as well with them they 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.050
 they basically helped me get out what is 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.810
 the ruthless was playing with them 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:46.060
 quietly uy what a rooster and then of 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.800
 Suddenly, the 15-pound streak did not hit me 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.260
 I've been here a little bit 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.820
 sending spam in this area as is and 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.160
 I realized that the streak of 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:55.930
 15 at this time and I said issue that 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.330
 would have because he has it now because if not 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.430
 it's my chance to take out ore since 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:02.500
 I stayed at two the previous game 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.180
 I was two against all 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.100
 not the grave I stayed stone 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.320
 capturing but it was a brutal game 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:12.610
 find all that has always been the 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:14.230
 milk but note that I could not and we're going to 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:15.850
 increase the criticism a little bit 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.950
 and all that subject was when here what 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:19.780
 I repeat with the asm a speakeasy on model 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:22.030
 elite the best weapon in the game for me 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:25.660
 with quick fire and hilt and 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:28.120
 unsheathed and then he had the 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.740
 typical wow and hack that the record 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.170
 I recommend you take these gusts only 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:34.180
 to take out the dna since it's just going 

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:36.040
 analyze you do not need to take more 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.500
 rachas carry the egg with editor 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:41.530
 threat detector like this and with time 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:44.410
 extra and existing you carry it with what 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:45.669
 it would be blinding and extra time also the 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:47.890
 truth the time is it helps you quite 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:49.650
 and I think it's an extra time dominated all 

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:52.210
 it's an extra time of a minute and a half 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:55.030
 two and a half can arrive I do not know if I want 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:57.400
 to three but good and there I leave it I know if 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:58.810
 you know how to take advantage of the extra time if you 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.210
 will do eternal and you will keep a 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.740
 huge streak and threat detector what 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.919
 basically recommended by the 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:07.390
 campers through the fields a lady since 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:08.260
 they are practically already camping here 

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:10.840
 like 23 walls 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:13.300
 and the truth is that it's good, it's great 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:15.430
 and then I will comment on the tactics that 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.320
 use this game or aesthetic 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:18.850
 basically they are always responsible 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:21.220
 I will try to be accompanied by some colleagues 

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:21.910
 that they support you for that reason backs and always 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.680
 keep 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:25.750
 even the metais in space because the 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:28.030
 well it's not going to change they will come by 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:30.400
 back always sit down what is 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:32.080
 keep us quite far from answered 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.930
 on this side of the huts here are two 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:37.180
 booths here is the booth of what 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:39.190
 it would be the area of ​​more for whatever the 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:40.960
 flag should and the flag area of 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:43.420
 his responds as you see the Palestinian and 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:44.770
 bone is a respond so good that I 

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:46.480
 I remember taking advantage of it especially when 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:48.760
 these when some powerful game that 

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:50.380
 You see that you have not been here for a long time 

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:52.060
 As you can see, I took it out 

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:54.940
 pretty important pretty good 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:58.150
 starting a humble game is worth 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:06:00.580
 traps without anything else without review busti ni 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:02.020
 nothing and that is to say is well 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:04.720
 with the second I had that soon 

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:06.160
 will come to the channel and I'll talk about reviewing 

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:09.190
 boosting are now going up in plan 

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:11.260
 second I had my mother and my second dna 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:12.670
 not uploading in a background game 

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.689
 talking about the river bustin and everything 

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:15.639
 that topic 

00:06:13.689 --> 00:06:18.069
 so here I get the truth never 

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:20.339
 I would never think I thought you'll see fall 

00:06:18.069 --> 00:06:23.709
 against these people because I started I think that 

00:06:20.339 --> 00:06:25.149
 dying six or seven times and see what 

00:06:23.709 --> 00:06:28.239
 what can be done in a second round 

00:06:25.149 --> 00:06:29.860
 of domain if you play well if you occupy 

00:06:28.239 --> 00:06:31.629
 controlling the area with so many 

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:33.519
 respawn and also also worth 

00:06:31.629 --> 00:06:35.709
 controlling the parking area that is 

00:06:33.519 --> 00:06:37.509
 area that you see here and the truth is coming 

00:06:35.709 --> 00:06:40.119
 great, that is, this area plus the one that I have 

00:06:37.509 --> 00:06:43.989
 said before I recommend you to come in 

00:06:40.119 --> 00:06:46.089
 this trino detroit time I do not know how 

00:06:43.989 --> 00:06:47.919
 be on the maps but I recommend you 

00:06:46.089 --> 00:06:50.619
 that you come here because the truth is 

00:06:47.919 --> 00:06:52.779
 hallucinating seriously is amazing the 

00:06:50.619 --> 00:06:55.269
 amount of casualties that can reach you 

00:06:52.779 --> 00:06:57.369
 do if you get it really well and here 

00:06:55.269 --> 00:06:59.289
 it's going to end the game I hope that 

00:06:57.369 --> 00:07:01.629

00:06:59.289 --> 00:07:02.110
