00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:08.650
 I want to show you how to do it today 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.679
 a cute no box makes here 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.730
 you can give something nice about it here 

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:16.230
 I still have a piece of fabric 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:16.230
 covered because you can put something on it 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:22.900
 and it is quite simply a box 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:26.800
 you only need to make two 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:28.269
 fritter paper is square size 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.759
 Actually, the main thing is not both 

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:32.800
 the same size because that a fourth of 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:35.199
 blanket and the other and in the 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:38.170
 box then you need a heavy one 

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:40.300
 and a few things to decorate 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:44.080
 then either one below 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:46.000
 buy something nice so it works 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:49.900
 First, finish the box 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.309
 this is how this square leaf plays 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.309
 for each other 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.410
 there are again unfolded and 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.930
 now 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:10.020
 I hold that 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:12.480
 the other side so if i am out now 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:17.040
 I have a sustainable two here 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:20.090
 Now I can hold the one 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.090
 tip on the others 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.700
 today apart again and the same 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.110
 I'll do it again on the other 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.110
 side tip on top 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.690
 so 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.360
 now 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:43.020
 because I'm right up to the top 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.020
 Focus 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.369
 I'll do it 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.369
 everyone plays 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:59.400
 next 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:01.830
 In case I tore the top in between 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.800
 striped 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:06.750
 Here is also a small cross through 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:09.509
 kink edges and now, of course, exactly 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.899
 the point here up to this cross out 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.899
 the view 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.980
 I'm doing well now again 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:20.840
 every page now 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:25.959
 if I tip every single one again 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.959
 can drive up to the front clicks 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.710
 the sheer city now on one side 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.610
 here 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:43.610
 and landscapes 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.230
 which is quite handy to that before 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.540
 This pattern has been folded when 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:54.290
 easy now 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:58.910
 Can set 12 pictures so up to here 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:02.740
 still the top and here also at the same time 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.740
 right on the opposite 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.900
 here cuts 2 1 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.069
 and at the top 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.010
 here is 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:20.850
 because I'm the first one 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:23.360
 then I think the whole thing again 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:26.780
 Today I do the devices 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:30.410
 keep the tip clean and then 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:34.360
 I am still switching to the one here 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.360
 cut each in the middle 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.040
 you can see that it is a small one 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.530
 box will 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:56.209
 and I'll keep it at one side first 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:04:00.310
 stuck and should survive that 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:00.310
 over and 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:13.040
 here too I hold the whole up to now 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:14.450
 Clegg is her grandfather and everything is beautiful 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.480
 the same I do now give 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:16.480
 can 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.629
 and then 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:31.220
 a man holding a box over the 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.220
 other 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:46.550
 a small box is ready now 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:49.090
 Have fun with the nachzubasteln and up to 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.090
 next time
