career from lbc but have you noticed
this<00:00:59.269> plastic<00:01:01.540> if<00:01:02.540> you<00:01:02.899> receive<00:01:03.140> your<00:01:03.589> product

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
this plastic if you receive your product

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.660 
this plastic if you receive your product
and<00:01:04.640> it's<00:01:04.820> not<00:01:05.059> and<00:01:05.390> in<00:01:05.960> the<00:01:06.860> plastic<00:01:07.430> like

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
and it's not and in the plastic like

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:14.969 
and it's not and in the plastic like
this<00:01:09.280> basically<00:01:10.420> that's<00:01:11.420> not<00:01:12.520> brand-new<00:01:13.520> I

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:14.979 
this basically that's not brand-new I

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:18.160 
this basically that's not brand-new I
think<00:01:15.979> because<00:01:16.640> the<00:01:17.119> product<00:01:17.360> should<00:01:17.659> be<00:01:17.720> in

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
think because the product should be in

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.910 
think because the product should be in
this<00:01:19.039> kind<00:01:19.310> of<00:01:19.460> plastic<00:01:19.940> so<00:01:20.780> there's<00:01:21.619> some
