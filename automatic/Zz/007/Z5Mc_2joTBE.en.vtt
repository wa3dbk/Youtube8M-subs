00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.789
 to the public of sports climbing or 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.340
 the lighter and minimalist model as 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.990
 time the wheelchair is good or not one of the 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.000
 main chains of thesis chair 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.429
 is that all equipment is highly 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.320
 abrasion resistant 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.510
 I was talking to a place where you 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.030
 will drag on the rock a lot and that 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.700
 from here it will deteriorate - the 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.530
 rack are of different designs for 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.719
 two different types of equipment for 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.120
 you put it or you can put it 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.579
 cards and sewing in front and you 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.190
 Put your culture as it is 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.230
 This handle is covered with 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.090
 nylon your your equipment will not stay 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.969
 sliding all the time to 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.280
 However, an abrasion occurs in this 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.890
 material here another thing that called 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.989
 the attention in a positive way is the look 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.930
 of the chair he has instructions on how to 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.600
 should be used as much brake as node is a 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.580
 look sturdy and is not 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.130
 susceptible to abrasion 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.380
 however when he gets hung up 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.720
 It hurts a little in the part of the groin 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.189
 and she's not very comfortable for you 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.799

 sports routes 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.500
 to finish an evaluation of the chair 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.990
 cox of Pepsi brand or seat 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.850
 did very well in the evaluations 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.960
 however the chair in some 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.540
 evaluations only when I was 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.090
 hanging for a certain time or a 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.430
 gym training academy hurt 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.100
 bit my groin gym too 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.959
 It is releasing over time, ie 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.760
 the clip here she 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.860

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.780
