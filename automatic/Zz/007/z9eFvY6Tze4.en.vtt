how<00:00:30.240> to<00:00:30.320> make<00:00:31.320> one<00:00:31.489> it's<00:00:32.489> actually<00:00:32.759> a<00:00:33.000> very

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
how to make one it's actually a very

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.170 
how to make one it's actually a very
simple<00:00:34.020> tutorial<00:00:34.200> it<00:00:34.800> took<00:00:35.010> me<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.940> first

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
simple tutorial it took me the first

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.930 
simple tutorial it took me the first
time<00:00:36.300> I<00:00:36.450> ever<00:00:36.600> used<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.760> vinyl<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:39.149> editor<00:00:39.629> it

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 
time I ever used the vinyl the editor it

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.170 
time I ever used the vinyl the editor it
took<00:00:41.940> me<00:00:42.000> maybe<00:00:42.510> 20<00:00:43.320> minutes<00:00:43.530> 30<00:00:43.890> minutes<00:00:44.180> the

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
took me maybe 20 minutes 30 minutes the

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.389 
took me maybe 20 minutes 30 minutes the
second<00:00:45.600> time<00:00:45.750> I<00:00:45.960> did<00:00:45.989> it<00:00:46.739> while<00:00:47.219> I<00:00:47.250> was

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
second time I did it while I was

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.389 
second time I did it while I was
recording<00:00:47.850> it<00:00:48.239> took<00:00:48.480> me<00:00:48.629> about<00:00:48.840> maybe<00:00:49.399> 15

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
recording it took me about maybe 15

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.080 
recording it took me about maybe 15
minutes<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.210> I've<00:00:51.960> shortened<00:00:52.500> it<00:00:52.590> down<00:00:52.649> to

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.090 
minutes and I've shortened it down to

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:58.209 
minutes and I've shortened it down to
less<00:00:54.090> than<00:00:54.120> five<00:00:54.899> minutes<00:00:55.230> for<00:00:55.590> you<00:00:56.570> just<00:00:57.570> by

00:00:58.209 --> 00:00:58.219 
less than five minutes for you just by

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:02.360 
less than five minutes for you just by
speeding<00:00:59.219> up<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.699> footage<00:01:00.590> now<00:01:01.590> less<00:01:01.949> a<00:01:02.190> it's

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
speeding up the footage now less a it's

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.179 
speeding up the footage now less a it's
a<00:01:02.489> it's<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.789> it's<00:01:02.820> a<00:01:03.090> very<00:01:03.300> simple<00:01:03.719> logo<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.530> it

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
a it's a it's a very simple logo and it

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.600 
a it's a it's a very simple logo and it
doesn't<00:01:05.430> take<00:01:05.670> too<00:01:06.150> much<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.450> do<00:01:07.229> it<00:01:07.520> you<00:01:08.520> can

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
doesn't take too much to do it you can

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.539 
doesn't take too much to do it you can
use<00:01:08.790> it<00:01:08.939> with<00:01:09.090> pretty<00:01:09.330> much<00:01:09.510> all<00:01:09.780> primitive

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:10.549 
use it with pretty much all primitive

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:15.020 
use it with pretty much all primitive
objects<00:01:11.549> and<00:01:11.790> things<00:01:13.310> like<00:01:14.310> that<00:01:14.369> there's

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
objects and things like that there's

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.300 
objects and things like that there's
like<00:01:15.180> gradient<00:01:15.750> in<00:01:15.930> there<00:01:16.200> but<00:01:16.530> that's<00:01:16.890> pretty

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
like gradient in there but that's pretty

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.390 
like gradient in there but that's pretty
much<00:01:17.460> it<00:01:17.670> it's<00:01:18.290> very<00:01:19.290> simple<00:01:19.710> now<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.360> few

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400 
much it it's very simple now a few

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.700 
much it it's very simple now a few
little<00:01:23.400> tips<00:01:24.210> that<00:01:24.600> I<00:01:24.630> can<00:01:24.990> give<00:01:25.140> you<00:01:25.290> is<00:01:25.320> like

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
little tips that I can give you is like

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.100 
little tips that I can give you is like
when<00:01:25.890> you're<00:01:26.009> trying<00:01:26.250> to<00:01:26.580> size<00:01:27.060> objects<00:01:27.780> down

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
when you're trying to size objects down

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.460 
when you're trying to size objects down
and<00:01:28.500> get<00:01:28.979> them<00:01:29.130> in<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.369> right<00:01:29.400> place<00:01:30.229> you<00:01:31.229> can

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
and get them in the right place you can

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.160 
and get them in the right place you can
get<00:01:32.009> them<00:01:32.280> close<00:01:32.939> to<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.329> right<00:01:33.509> place<00:01:33.810> using

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
get them close to the right place using

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.319 
get them close to the right place using
the<00:01:34.590> left<00:01:35.250> control<00:01:35.759> stick<00:01:36.030> when<00:01:36.210> you're

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
the left control stick when you're

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.200 
the left control stick when you're
moving<00:01:36.509> them<00:01:36.810> around<00:01:36.900> or<00:01:37.759> sizing<00:01:38.759> things<00:01:39.030> like

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
moving them around or sizing things like

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.520 
moving them around or sizing things like
that<00:01:39.420> but<00:01:39.750> I<00:01:39.810> always<00:01:40.110> recommend<00:01:40.530> using<00:01:41.460> the

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
that but I always recommend using the

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.050 
that but I always recommend using the
directional<00:01:43.530> pad<00:01:43.740> for<00:01:44.310> very<00:01:44.729> minor

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
directional pad for very minor

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.370 
directional pad for very minor
adjustments<00:01:45.990> just<00:01:46.259> to<00:01:46.470> get<00:01:46.829> it<00:01:46.979> perfect<00:01:47.820> so

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
adjustments just to get it perfect so

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.499 
adjustments just to get it perfect so
that's<00:01:49.380> usually<00:01:49.799> what<00:01:50.280> i<00:01:50.310> use<00:01:50.610> and<00:01:50.640> its<00:01:51.299> really

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
that's usually what i use and its really

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.649 
that's usually what i use and its really
disorienting<00:01:52.320> as<00:01:52.740> well<00:01:52.950> trying<00:01:53.369> to<00:01:53.549> size<00:01:54.360> the

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
disorienting as well trying to size the

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.810 
disorienting as well trying to size the
object<00:01:55.170> when<00:01:55.439> you<00:01:56.189> control<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:57.649> the<00:01:58.649> scale<00:01:59.520> of

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
object when you control the the scale of

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.709 
object when you control the the scale of
it<00:02:00.000> up<00:02:00.600> down<00:02:01.380> left<00:02:01.710> and<00:02:02.250> right<00:02:02.399> using<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.299> same

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
it up down left and right using the same

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.679 
it up down left and right using the same
construct<00:02:04.259> control<00:02:04.680> stick<00:02:05.009> it<00:02:05.969> really<00:02:06.450> makes

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
construct control stick it really makes

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.990 
construct control stick it really makes
it<00:02:06.869> a<00:02:06.899> little<00:02:07.469> bit<00:02:07.649> difficult<00:02:07.890> to<00:02:08.340> find<00:02:08.670> the

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
it a little bit difficult to find the

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.150 
it a little bit difficult to find the
exact<00:02:09.479> spot<00:02:09.720> where<00:02:09.929> you<00:02:10.289> need<00:02:10.470> it

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
exact spot where you need it

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:18.870 
exact spot where you need it
and<00:02:14.010> this<00:02:15.010> was<00:02:15.280> the<00:02:16.080> best<00:02:17.080> order<00:02:17.650> I<00:02:17.860> found<00:02:18.220> to

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
and this was the best order I found to

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:24.930 
and this was the best order I found to
do<00:02:19.000> these<00:02:19.240> in<00:02:21.450> it<00:02:22.450> basically<00:02:23.110> the<00:02:23.940> gradient

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
do these in it basically the gradient

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.170 
do these in it basically the gradient
which<00:02:25.210> I'll<00:02:25.420> show<00:02:25.600> you<00:02:25.780> at<00:02:25.960> the<00:02:26.050> end<00:02:26.170> is

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
which I'll show you at the end is

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.550 
which I'll show you at the end is
lastest<00:02:28.180> because<00:02:28.360> that<00:02:28.510> kind<00:02:28.690> of<00:02:28.840> overlaps<00:02:29.380> a

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
lastest because that kind of overlaps a

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.500 
lastest because that kind of overlaps a
few<00:02:29.770> things<00:02:30.010> and<00:02:31.260> I'd<00:02:32.260> actually<00:02:33.360> make<00:02:34.360> sure

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
few things and I'd actually make sure

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.710 
few things and I'd actually make sure

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
the only thing that's really missing is

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:34.110 
the only thing that's really missing is
the<00:03:31.290> there's<00:03:32.290> the<00:03:32.709> look<00:03:33.459> the<00:03:33.580> actual<00:03:33.910> TV

screen<00:03:35.490> but<00:03:36.490> I<00:03:37.500> work<00:03:38.500> around<00:03:38.890> that<00:03:39.130> with<00:03:39.490> the

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
screen but I work around that with the

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.330 
screen but I work around that with the
gradient<00:03:40.209> which<00:03:40.360> you'll<00:03:40.510> see<00:03:40.540> after<00:03:41.200> I<00:03:42.480> the

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
gradient which you'll see after I the

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:49.830 
gradient which you'll see after I the
shading<00:03:45.340> on<00:03:45.489> the<00:03:45.600> antenna<00:03:46.600> there<00:03:47.850> and<00:03:48.850> this<00:03:49.660> is
