00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:07.140
 Talk to everyone, cesac eric 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.269
 critical hits and in the video let's talk 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.900
 about longer than they had 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.340
 Completely fucking shit if the 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.289
 past video the trend was more 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.580
 accessible to the general public of the 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.770
 Today's video we only talk about 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.750
 unhappy sequences even come on 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.000
 our first game today is one of the 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.590
 My favorite of talking badly is 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.300
 batman arkham home 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.189
 the game is a great slot machine game released 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.800
 by warner it was done by another 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.050
 producer that was not the rhox terry he 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.239
 actually while the hawks terry is 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.219
 doing the arcane night he hopes to launch 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.590
 this one to make a big money 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.770
 the game took place five years before the 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.510
 batman arkham asylum and in him actually 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.829
 has the first meeting of Batman and 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.480
 Joker the first meeting of batman 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.140
 with good on the first date in the neighborhood 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.390
 basically everybody the same night 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.850
 You can understand how this is wrong in 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.670
 It's true who ever read batman 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.789
 is a little fan of the D series as wrong 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.470
 this is in fact and the one with bossa could 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.810
 to get a story like this 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.049
 terry who is a talented and 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.939
 and what weight arkham asylum and arkham city 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:14.850
 He preferred not to touch this hornet's nest there for 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:17.100
 tell the story and there went the warner 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.350
 bros montreal and made the crappy story 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.540
 by the way, it 's not just a story that's bad 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.330
 in fact the game is full of bugs yet 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.280
 two years after their launch and 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.990
 they just will not fix it 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.939
 fuck who's locked in the middle of 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.740
 game and even has several bugs that 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.630
 spoil story have to start game 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.490
 all over again and lose all your 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.130
 progress because you lock in a room 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.479
 where the little guy can not get out 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.520
 honestly if this is not a job 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.520
 by the fact that it should not have 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.579
 released I do not know what else is ours 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.710
 Today's second game is devil may cry 2 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.840
 the game got all that devil may cry 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.610
 It had to be cool how guns can look after 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.320
 of the bosses with a strategy that 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.090
 what to put to face these bosses 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.070
 like the dante himself and simply 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.719
 shit all people 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.520
 the dante to start it becomes a 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:04.950
 mystery but guy of life he gets a 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.210
 click on the button and so on they still 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.069
 to reduce the difficulty 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.259
 as I have already said and reduce the details of 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.569
 scenarios to turn history into 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.290
 a dung on the truth and above all 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.900
 include a 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.459
 second cd where students went and 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.890
 Their missions are basically a 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:23.459
 dante's missions repeater used three 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.599
 only this is not a job for 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.569
 as done 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:30.780
 I really do not know what 's next 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:32.640
 of our list is brian epstein 10 on 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.560
 original was not a great game in the 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.200
 It was a game that ended in the 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.430
 inertia is to think fucking shit spent 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.040
 money in this game I will train once 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.620
 because the accounts are not so bad so 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.389
 which will stop playing but also 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.629
 It's not so good , I was going to do it. 

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:51.060
 so much pleasure playing there deep silver 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:54.209
 He simply took everything out of his way. 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.129
 which had original general and therefore only 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.650
 the bostas all in one replay of the game 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:03:00.540
 slow fight a bossa that those 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.810
 parts with water that are a bag of 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.590
 and I honestly can not 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.799
 understand how they can 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:10.139
 turning a bad game is something worse than 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:12.030
 it is too late was not Kiko is 

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:15.959
 that classic example of bad 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:18.959
 but it is good already the deri ipi is bad and it is 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:21.720
 a shit indeed a closing this 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:23.010
 license we have been 90 c13 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.659
 sincerely the most 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.489
 disappointing franchise 

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:28.220
 I really do not know what this is that 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:30.540
 He did not even want to play in this game anymore. 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.060
 sincerely the game tutorial has 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.129
 Almost 20 hours like this is possible 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.109
 involves not lasting 20 hours 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:39.780
 the characters are the most 

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:41.220
 boring the story does not go five 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.139
 minutes without wanting to punch in the face 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.419
 do not hope to spend a minute without wanting 

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:47.669
 give a punch to the face daniel the only one 

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:48.930
 cool character sase and moreover it is 

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:50.699
 extremely racist because he is a 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.709
 who chooses a game in the field of 

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:56.090
 his black power knows 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:59.189
 anyway the game is really bad and the 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:01.439
 unfortunately I bought an xbox 360 

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:04.290
 just to play the final fantasy 13 he went 

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:07.169
 which made me buy an xbox 360 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:11.759
 there in 2010 and you can imagine 

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:13.919
 my disappointment was that I simply 

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:16.199
 decided to insist after all 

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:17.190
 We did not see it set up and then they 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:20.459
 they released 10 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:22.139
 moreover the thirteen 2 or 3 2 others who also 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:24.659
 had a two-and- a- half release. 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:27.300
 10 2 it sucks too but at last it had 

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:29.009
 32 and moreover online the return 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.569
 these times they said that people 

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:32.940
 did not see a hundred of light and that 

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:35.069
 probably she and the guys in another 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:38.159
 game looks just right that shit 

00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:39.659
 The guys, I'm staying here because I do not know 

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:41.460
 subscribe to the favorite in dejem 

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:43.710
 comments in addition to other games 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.970
 which had a disappointing sequence and 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.509
 by tomorrow 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.509
