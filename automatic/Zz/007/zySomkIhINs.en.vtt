00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:16.730
 good afternoon the mechanical engineer works 

00:00:13.029 --> 00:00:20.660
 It's my timing car with the problem. 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:25.630
 sena presents a problem that does not 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:30.320
 flashes alert does not stop related 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:34.160
 because the button has given problems 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.030
 this button here was a very 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.270
 great 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:41.660
 Dismantling this whole panel I 've already 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:43.309
 on youtube no one found but me 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.629
 I'll show you here how it is 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:48.260
 unmount this panel 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:49.609
 It's okay, just look at us first. 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.840
 comes 

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:57.739
 at 12 the same serve from the side of the box 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:01:00.949
 and hurt the next exchange rate 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:03.190
 dismount here removed 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:08.240
 We 're going to have to take this step. 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:09.920
 here it is take this piece is a 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:15.590
 a little work 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:20.600
 She's stuck here for two years. 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:25.400
 bolts can see here two here 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:31.270
 screws I 'm the President 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:35.450
 I can only here right. 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:44.360
 Here strip ready therein is in the part that 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:46.100
 Conditional touches on a2 stravinsky is 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.160
 too much trouble to take away 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:54.860
 this one right only for the key 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:56.110
 slit and bassaki here is part of 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:00.790
 low 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:07.340
 there then just remove the air conditioning 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:11.090
 company here that 2 president has withdrawn 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:13.810
 he is fitting only engaged and comes 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:17.440
 Pull over to see part 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:20.470
 What here today has our 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:23.140
 'said-whose' which is our engine and the 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.540
 flashes alert there comes 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:29.190
 he is trapped by three screws here in the 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:32.260
 top that comes from right bottom 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:38.380
 here and he too 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:43.239
 three here on top of me here then the 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:47.080
 disassembly comes from bottom to top is here 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:50.739
 have a bay cover remove this group there 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:55.450
 then just do the process back right 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:58.450
 Looks good there are two locks here that 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.340
 I do not work to remove, just be careful. 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.120
 not to remember that all this in this 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.380
 car here is very fragile, right? 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:09.670
 so the ideal is that you have a 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:13.239
 spatula right that will not hurt nor 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.650
 scratch the car there after only around 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:16.930
 return 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.799
 the tip is to go to everyone there is no video 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:22.480
 on youtube so far, so I put 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:25.109
 problem, especially in 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:31.000
 palettes here or conditionally break 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:32.290
 very easy for us to change the exchange 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.850
 it is also very easy to see the 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:43.750
 screws here on the side 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:46.870
 can see a little work going on 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.660
 give it to do without having to pay 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:51.180
 mechanics out there 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:53.560
 warning that you have to be very careful 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.850
 because by the time I was trying to take 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:59.109
 who does not know how to open 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:04:02.290
 I just broke it just a little 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:13.109
 iron solder a little way will give everything 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:13.109
 right now in the careful assembly touch
