00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.140
 or not 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:32.410
 with your stories here I bring you a 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:34.449
 new tutorial on how to make this little house 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:39.210
 for the new horses of the new 

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:43.300
 1.6 update as we have here 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:45.530
 a man here we have a handsome man already and 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.079
 he will put a voice 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.969
 there is the house as for this 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:52.309
 survival issue when it's a little horse 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:57.900
 so that you have as a means of 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:01:00.480
 transportation is good 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:05.800
 first then obviously the reinforcements 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:08.800
 how is this up 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:12.240
 the tips that make the stairs the 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.240
 let's replace with this 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.299
 good here because then when I go 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.630
 deposit 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.630
 leaving 1 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:28.119
 I'm going to normally put these blocks 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:31.500
 of you and then we make the other game and 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:31.500
 that's all the same 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.840
 how 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:44.180
 and instead of windows they put 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:45.680
 berries because like a barn is going to have 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:49.330
 years 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.330
 if we are dominant 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.229
 with this 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.750
 same 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.750
 above 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.140
 on the steps 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.860
 with the scan 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.239
 and here 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.760
 Y 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.970
 all the blocks obviously you 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.970
 down 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:55.430
 and then we would be his his house for 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:58.430
 work more obviously because it illuminates 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.430
 as 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.300
 the crab 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:08.780
 let's take 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:12.319
 - to things where they compress the wheat in a 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:15.830
 picture but good here put the valleys 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:18.380
 where they are going to put their horse and they are going 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:20.980
 to put in and they're going to start here with a 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:23.840
 new rope is to see the animals 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.940
 but well here I'll be in the tutorial 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.970
 a very easy tutorial the truth I hope 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:31.280
 very father for the little horses of the 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:34.250
