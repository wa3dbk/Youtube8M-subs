as<00:01:14.590> some<00:01:15.369> of<00:01:15.490> you<00:01:15.640> may<00:01:15.790> have<00:01:15.820> noticed<00:01:16.450> the

as some of you may have noticed the

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.160 
as some of you may have noticed the
packaging<00:01:17.170> is<00:01:17.380> the<00:01:17.409> old<00:01:17.770> style<00:01:18.659> however<00:01:19.659> that

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
packaging is the old style however that

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.260 
packaging is the old style however that
makes<00:01:20.469> it<00:01:20.619> a<00:01:20.710> bit<00:01:20.920> easier<00:01:21.100> to<00:01:21.640> compare<00:01:22.030> in<00:01:22.180> a

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 
makes it a bit easier to compare in a

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.200 
makes it a bit easier to compare in a
way<00:01:22.450> because<00:01:23.110> they<00:01:23.350> are<00:01:23.380> more<00:01:23.649> like<00:01:23.920> as<00:01:24.210> you

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
way because they are more like as you

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.090 
way because they are more like as you
can<00:01:25.390> see<00:01:25.600> they<00:01:25.810> have<00:01:25.960> a<00:01:25.990> similar<00:01:26.409> color<00:01:26.710> scheme

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100
