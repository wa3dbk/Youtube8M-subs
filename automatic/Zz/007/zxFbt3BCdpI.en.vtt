barrel bolts in here and you can just
see<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.350> neck<00:01:58.740> fixings<00:01:59.310> in<00:01:59.549> there<00:01:59.820> so<00:02:00.270> there's

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
see the neck fixings in there so there's

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.030 
see the neck fixings in there so there's
an<00:02:00.509> end<00:02:00.630> of<00:02:00.840> lock<00:02:00.990> there<00:02:01.259> and<00:02:01.500> an<00:02:01.590> end<00:02:01.770> block

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
an end of lock there and an end block

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.700 
an end of lock there and an end block
there<00:02:02.310> keeps<00:02:02.759> it<00:02:02.850> nice<00:02:03.000> and<00:02:03.210> rigid<00:02:03.590> with<00:02:04.590> this

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
there keeps it nice and rigid with this

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.469 
there keeps it nice and rigid with this
perspex<00:02:05.189> top<00:02:05.399> I<00:02:05.430> did<00:02:05.670> wonder<00:02:05.969> about<00:02:06.060> putting<00:02:06.450> a

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
perspex top I did wonder about putting a

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:07.999 
perspex top I did wonder about putting a
sound<00:02:06.719> hole<00:02:06.990> in<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.290> top<00:02:07.439> and<00:02:07.530> I<00:02:07.619> was<00:02:07.740> worried

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
sound hole in the top and I was worried

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.639 
sound hole in the top and I was worried
about<00:02:08.069> splitting<00:02:08.550> this<00:02:08.849> perspex<00:02:09.649> and

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
about splitting this perspex and

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.380 
about splitting this perspex and
spoiling<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.280> pier<00:02:11.489> and<00:02:11.730> so<00:02:12.000> just<00:02:12.239> put<00:02:12.360> a

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
spoiling the pier and so just put a

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.280 
spoiling the pier and so just put a
sound<00:02:12.690> Porter

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
sound Porter

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.530 
sound Porter
and<00:02:13.439> I<00:02:13.500> say<00:02:13.650> this<00:02:13.769> passive<00:02:14.250> pick<00:02:15.030> up<00:02:15.180> it's

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
and I say this passive pick up it's

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.020 
and I say this passive pick up it's
quite<00:02:15.780> acoustically<00:02:16.650> which<00:02:17.250> I<00:02:17.519> should've

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
quite acoustically which I should've

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:25.130 
quite acoustically which I should've
expected<00:02:18.390> it<00:02:18.689> to<00:02:18.840> be<00:02:21.200> um<00:02:23.689> but<00:02:24.689> when<00:02:24.870> you<00:02:24.930> plug

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
expected it to be um but when you plug

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.009 
expected it to be um but when you plug
it<00:02:25.230> in<00:02:25.819> it's<00:02:26.819> not<00:02:27.000> terrific<00:02:27.329> but<00:02:27.569> because<00:02:27.870> it's

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
it in it's not terrific but because it's

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:50.509 
it in it's not terrific but because it's
a<00:02:28.079> passive<00:02:29.299> it's<00:02:30.299> a<00:02:30.390> passive<00:02:30.750> pH<00:02:31.049> so<00:02:48.920> sweet<00:02:49.920> see

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
a passive it's a passive pH so sweet see

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:58.210 
a passive it's a passive pH so sweet see
you<00:02:50.579> walking<00:02:50.909> down<00:02:51.150> the<00:02:51.689> street<00:02:51.959> I<00:02:55.669> Oh<00:02:56.669> waiver

we<00:02:59.220> should<00:02:59.370> say<00:02:59.489> the<00:02:59.609> treble<00:02:59.939> down<00:03:00.120> is<00:03:00.269> these

00:03:00.649 --> 00:03:00.659 
we should say the treble down is these

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:02.360 
we should say the treble down is these
things<00:03:00.870> are<00:03:00.930> very<00:03:00.959> traveling<00:03:01.560> that's<00:03:02.159> a<00:03:02.250> bit

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
things are very traveling that's a bit

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:26.020 
things are very traveling that's a bit
better<00:03:23.269> sinha<00:03:24.269> fur<00:03:24.449> so<00:03:24.930> there<00:03:25.169> we<00:03:25.290> go

with<00:03:33.959> the<00:03:34.049> bridge<00:03:34.379> what<00:03:34.680> I<00:03:34.709> did<00:03:35.989> it's<00:03:36.989> got<00:03:37.109> a

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:37.139 
with the bridge what I did it's got a

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:39.949 
with the bridge what I did it's got a
floating<00:03:37.560> bridge<00:03:37.889> and<00:03:38.280> they've<00:03:38.909> actually<00:03:39.090> put

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
floating bridge and they've actually put

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.649 
floating bridge and they've actually put
the<00:03:40.049> piezo<00:03:40.650> element<00:03:40.680> in<00:03:41.430> this<00:03:41.909> this<00:03:42.510> is

00:03:42.649 --> 00:03:42.659 
the piezo element in this this is

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:45.080 
the piezo element in this this is
actually<00:03:43.049> i<00:03:43.229> laminated<00:03:44.129> this<00:03:44.519> bridge<00:03:44.760> up<00:03:44.940> out

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
actually i laminated this bridge up out

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.360 
actually i laminated this bridge up out
of<00:03:45.120> three<00:03:45.510> pieces<00:03:45.840> with<00:03:46.500> an<00:03:46.650> arrow<00:03:46.829> center

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
of three pieces with an arrow center

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.020 
of three pieces with an arrow center
section<00:03:47.940> so<00:03:48.479> I<00:03:48.510> formed<00:03:48.900> a<00:03:48.959> little<00:03:49.229> pocket<00:03:49.709> in

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
section so I formed a little pocket in

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.599 
section so I formed a little pocket in
there<00:03:51.030> to<00:03:51.810> drop<00:03:52.019> the<00:03:52.260> PX<00:03:52.949> AIDS<00:03:53.159> I<00:03:53.340> didn't<00:03:53.519> have

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:53.609 
there to drop the PX AIDS I didn't have

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:56.030 
there to drop the PX AIDS I didn't have
to<00:03:53.729> bother<00:03:53.819> routing<00:03:54.419> it<00:03:54.569> out<00:03:54.780> so<00:03:55.500> the<00:03:55.620> piezo

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
to bother routing it out so the piezo

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.890 
to bother routing it out so the piezo
element<00:03:56.069> is<00:03:56.669> there<00:03:56.909> which<00:03:57.269> cable<00:03:57.689> goes

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
element is there which cable goes

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.219 
element is there which cable goes
through<00:03:58.169> to<00:03:58.319> the<00:03:58.439> little<00:03:59.629> tone<00:04:00.629> of<00:04:00.810> volume

00:04:01.219 --> 00:04:01.229 
through to the little tone of volume

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:04.610 
through to the little tone of volume
here<00:04:01.500> ah<00:04:02.030> with<00:04:03.030> a<00:04:03.060> with<00:04:03.599> a<00:04:03.629> bone<00:04:03.870> saddle<00:04:04.409> and

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
here ah with a with a bone saddle and

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.990 
here ah with a with a bone saddle and
bone<00:04:05.069> nut<00:04:05.340> and<00:04:06.620> there<00:04:07.620> you<00:04:07.739> go<00:04:07.849> quarter<00:04:08.849> bottle

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
bone nut and there you go quarter bottle

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.909
