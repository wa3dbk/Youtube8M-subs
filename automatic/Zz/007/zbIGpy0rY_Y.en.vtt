00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
names like eagle or I'd love to use

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.720 
names like eagle or I'd love to use
names<00:00:27.599> like<00:00:27.779> ego<00:00:28.140> but<00:00:28.619> we<00:00:29.070> work<00:00:29.250> with<00:00:29.429> what<00:00:29.460> we

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
names like ego but we work with what we

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.479 
names like ego but we work with what we
get<00:00:29.939> and<00:00:30.119> what<00:00:30.359> we<00:00:30.480> get<00:00:30.660> here<00:00:30.689> is<00:00:30.990> a<00:00:31.019> fabulous

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:31.489 
get and what we get here is a fabulous

get and what we get here is a fabulous
thin<00:00:32.489> TV<00:00:32.910> it's<00:00:33.059> less<00:00:33.300> than<00:00:33.329> a<00:00:33.540> centimeter

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
thin TV it's less than a centimeter

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.590 
thin TV it's less than a centimeter
thick<00:00:34.050> and<00:00:34.649> it's<00:00:35.070> because<00:00:35.460> we<00:00:35.579> use<00:00:35.730> LEDs<00:00:36.239> to

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
thick and it's because we use LEDs to

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.540 
thick and it's because we use LEDs to
light<00:00:36.840> it<00:00:37.050> so<00:00:37.260> just<00:00:37.530> like<00:00:38.010> in<00:00:38.040> our<00:00:38.340> bio

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
light it so just like in our bio

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.729 
light it so just like in our bio
notebooks<00:00:39.149> we've<00:00:39.329> done<00:00:39.660> this<00:00:39.809> for<00:00:40.050> years<00:00:40.320> we

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
notebooks we've done this for years we

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.619 
notebooks we've done this for years we
actually<00:00:41.070> put<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.340> LEDs<00:00:41.730> on<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.090> side<00:00:42.329> and

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
actually put the LEDs on the side and

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.260 
actually put the LEDs on the side and
face<00:00:43.170> them<00:00:43.440> in<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:43.829> that's<00:00:44.250> from<00:00:44.789> every<00:00:45.120> edge

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
face them in and that's from every edge

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.240 
face them in and that's from every edge
what<00:00:45.690> provides<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.320> lighting<00:00:46.649> that<00:00:47.039> allows

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
what provides the lighting that allows

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.160 
what provides the lighting that allows
us<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.579> get<00:00:47.730> really<00:00:48.270> really<00:00:48.450> thin<00:00:48.809> well<00:00:49.050> let's

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
us to get really really thin well let's

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.389 
us to get really really thin well let's
have<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.350> look<00:00:49.379> at<00:00:49.620> how<00:00:49.739> thin<00:00:50.010> this<00:00:50.160> thing

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
have a look at how thin this thing

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.400 
have a look at how thin this thing
really<00:00:50.550> is<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:50.910> this<00:00:51.000> just<00:00:51.480> blows<00:00:51.570> me<00:00:51.870> away

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.410 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.750 

all<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.530> controls<00:00:55.890> in<00:00:56.010> power<00:00:56.190> basically

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
all the controls in power basically

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.510 
all the controls in power basically
comes<00:00:57.030> with<00:00:57.180> this<00:00:57.239> box<00:00:57.770> that's<00:00:58.770> right<00:00:58.980> no<00:00:59.370> it

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
comes with this box that's right no it

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.010 
comes with this box that's right no it
doesn't<00:00:59.760> go<00:00:59.820> to<00:00:59.940> this<00:01:00.090> box<00:01:00.420> there's<00:01:00.719> a<00:01:00.780> small

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
doesn't go to this box there's a small

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.750 
doesn't go to this box there's a small
box<00:01:01.260> about<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.649> size<00:01:01.710> of<00:01:01.949> a<00:01:02.039> paperback<00:01:02.460> book

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
box about the size of a paperback book

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.460 
box about the size of a paperback book

wirelessly to it as well well again
let's<00:01:16.619> talk<00:01:16.740> about<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.009> technology<00:01:17.340> so<00:01:17.820> this

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
let's talk about the technology so this

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.410 
let's talk about the technology so this
is<00:01:18.119> an<00:01:18.270> LCD<00:01:18.570> panel<00:01:19.049> and<00:01:19.200> typically<00:01:20.119> how<00:01:21.119> are<00:01:21.299> we

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
is an LCD panel and typically how are we

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.840 
is an LCD panel and typically how are we
lighting<00:01:21.720> LCD<00:01:22.049> panels<00:01:22.409> usually<00:01:23.250> with<00:01:23.430> an<00:01:23.549> LCD

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
lighting LCD panels usually with an LCD

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.330 
lighting LCD panels usually with an LCD
panel<00:01:24.270> of<00:01:24.420> a<00:01:24.570> series<00:01:24.900> of<00:01:24.960> very<00:01:25.200> thin<00:01:25.320> tubes<00:01:26.009> so

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
panel of a series of very thin tubes so

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.580 
panel of a series of very thin tubes so
we'll<00:01:26.549> have<00:01:26.729> that<00:01:26.970> or<00:01:27.360> some<00:01:27.930> of<00:01:27.960> our<00:01:28.080> newer<00:01:28.290> tvs

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
we'll have that or some of our newer tvs

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.280 
we'll have that or some of our newer tvs
have<00:01:28.979> led<00:01:29.549> clusters<00:01:30.150> but<00:01:30.600> that<00:01:30.750> makes<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:31.020> TV

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
have led clusters but that makes the TV

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.859 
have led clusters but that makes the TV
quite<00:01:31.920> a<00:01:31.950> bit<00:01:32.159> more<00:01:32.369> thick<00:01:33.090> so<00:01:33.360> on<00:01:33.540> this<00:01:33.659> we

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
quite a bit more thick so on this we

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.929 
quite a bit more thick so on this we
actually<00:01:34.290> just<00:01:34.320> have<00:01:34.680> them<00:01:35.009> right<00:01:35.430> along<00:01:35.729> the

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
actually just have them right along the

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.760 
actually just have them right along the
edge<00:01:35.970> all<00:01:36.329> stacked<00:01:36.689> up<00:01:36.900> pointing<00:01:37.500> straight

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
edge all stacked up pointing straight

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.319 
edge all stacked up pointing straight
into<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.490> TV<00:01:39.799> bit<00:01:40.799> of<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:40.979> price<00:01:41.189> jump<00:01:42.060> on<00:01:42.180> this

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
into the TV bit of a price jump on this

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.330 
into the TV bit of a price jump on this
one<00:01:42.479> now<00:01:42.899> is<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.200> little<00:01:43.350> over<00:01:43.740> four<00:01:43.950> thousand

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
one now is a little over four thousand

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.859 
one now is a little over four thousand
dollars<00:01:44.610> is<00:01:44.790> definitely<00:01:45.329> for<00:01:45.479> someone<00:01:45.780> who

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
dollars is definitely for someone who

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.780 
dollars is definitely for someone who
wants<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.140> latest<00:01:46.590> in<00:01:46.740> technology<00:01:47.070> the
