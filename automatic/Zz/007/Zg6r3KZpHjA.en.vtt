00:00:52.029 --> 00:00:52.039 
be satisfied what we accomplished in the

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:53.259 
be satisfied what we accomplished in the
past<00:00:52.069> we<00:00:52.429> gotta<00:00:52.549> go<00:00:52.670> generate<00:00:53.059> at<00:00:53.149> all

00:00:53.259 --> 00:00:53.269 
past we gotta go generate at all
