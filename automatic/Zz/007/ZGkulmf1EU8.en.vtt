00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
have to start figuring out is this

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:31.970 
have to start figuring out is this

environmental issue the first things

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.860 
environmental issue the first things
probably<00:04:35.370> find<00:04:35.790> out<00:04:35.970> is<00:04:36.150> that<00:04:36.180> occurring<00:04:36.660> only

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
probably find out is that occurring only

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.720 
probably find out is that occurring only
in<00:04:37.050> one<00:04:37.380> family<00:04:37.920> if<00:04:38.010> it's<00:04:38.160> only<00:04:38.310> in<00:04:38.490> a<00:04:38.550> specific

in one family if it's only in a specific

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:40.220 
in one family if it's only in a specific

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:40.230 
sire family that would give you

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:42.280 
sire family that would give you
indications<00:04:40.890> that<00:04:41.100> there's<00:04:41.280> probably<00:04:41.850> a

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:42.290 
indications that there's probably a

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:44.510 
indications that there's probably a
genetic<00:04:43.290> origin<00:04:43.770> but<00:04:43.890> it<00:04:43.950> doesn't<00:04:44.220> mean<00:04:44.340> it

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
genetic origin but it doesn't mean it

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.120 
genetic origin but it doesn't mean it
definitely<00:04:44.970> is<00:04:45.260> also<00:04:46.260> you<00:04:46.320> might<00:04:46.560> ask<00:04:46.830> if<00:04:47.010> the

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130 
definitely is also you might ask if the

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.490 
definitely is also you might ask if the
animals<00:04:47.490> inbred<00:04:47.970> because<00:04:48.510> in<00:04:48.750> bred<00:04:49.020> animals

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:54.420 
most genetic defects are associated with

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.390 
most genetic defects are associated with

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:50.970 
go right what do you do if you suspect

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:53.540 
go right what do you do if you suspect
you<00:05:51.360> have<00:05:51.390> a<00:05:51.540> genetic<00:05:51.960> defect<00:05:52.140> in<00:05:53.040> an<00:05:53.190> animal

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:53.550 
you have a genetic defect in an animal

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:55.640 
you have a genetic defect in an animal
in<00:05:53.670> your<00:05:53.790> herd<00:05:54.000> probably<00:05:54.990> the<00:05:55.080> first<00:05:55.290> thing<00:05:55.560> to

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:55.650 
in your herd probably the first thing to

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:57.260 
in your herd probably the first thing to
do<00:05:55.710> is<00:05:55.830> take<00:05:56.040> pictures<00:05:56.070> take<00:05:56.730> lots<00:05:57.090> of

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:57.270 
do is take pictures take lots of

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:00.710 
do is take pictures take lots of
pictures<00:05:57.540> because<00:05:58.820> that<00:05:59.820> way<00:06:00.060> you<00:06:00.330> can<00:06:00.510> share

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:00.720 
pictures because that way you can share

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:03.500 
pictures because that way you can share
them<00:06:00.900> and<00:06:01.130> people<00:06:02.130> have<00:06:02.730> knowledge<00:06:03.420> about

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:03.510 
them and people have knowledge about

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:05.660 
them and people have knowledge about
defects<00:06:04.080> can<00:06:04.350> look<00:06:04.860> at<00:06:04.980> those<00:06:05.100> pictures<00:06:05.160> and

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:05.670 
defects can look at those pictures and

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:07.880 
defects can look at those pictures and
give<00:06:05.760> an<00:06:05.880> awful<00:06:06.150> lot<00:06:06.270> of<00:06:06.300> information<00:06:06.890> you

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:07.890 
give an awful lot of information you

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:08.990 
give an awful lot of information you
want<00:06:08.040> to<00:06:08.100> be<00:06:08.190> able<00:06:08.280> to<00:06:08.430> collect<00:06:08.670> a<00:06:08.790> blood

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:09.000 
want to be able to collect a blood

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.120 
want to be able to collect a blood
sample<00:06:09.300> or<00:06:09.600> a<00:06:09.630> hair<00:06:09.900> sample<00:06:10.170> and<00:06:10.560> if<00:06:10.710> you<00:06:10.800> dis<00:06:11.010> a

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:11.130 
sample or a hair sample and if you dis a

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:12.560 
sample or a hair sample and if you dis a
hair<00:06:11.310> sample<00:06:11.490> make<00:06:11.820> sure<00:06:11.970> you<00:06:12.090> get<00:06:12.210> one<00:06:12.420> that's

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:12.570 
hair sample make sure you get one that's

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:14.000 
hair sample make sure you get one that's
including<00:06:13.050> the<00:06:13.080> roots<00:06:13.440> because<00:06:13.680> that's

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:14.010 
including the roots because that's

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:15.770 
including the roots because that's
really<00:06:14.280> where<00:06:14.400> the<00:06:14.490> DNA<00:06:14.820> is<00:06:15.210> you<00:06:15.480> want<00:06:15.630> to<00:06:15.690> be

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:15.780 
really where the DNA is you want to be

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:17.900 
really where the DNA is you want to be
having<00:06:15.990> material<00:06:16.560> that<00:06:16.650> you<00:06:16.770> can<00:06:16.920> do<00:06:17.070> have<00:06:17.670> for

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:17.910 
having material that you can do have for

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:20.630 
having material that you can do have for
DNA<00:06:18.270> testing<00:06:18.860> also<00:06:19.860> collect<00:06:20.190> samples<00:06:20.580> from

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:20.640 
DNA testing also collect samples from

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:22.310 
DNA testing also collect samples from
the<00:06:20.820> parents<00:06:21.210> too<00:06:21.420> if<00:06:21.600> they<00:06:21.720> are<00:06:21.780> available

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:22.320 
the parents too if they are available

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:24.320 
the parents too if they are available
because<00:06:22.440> that'll<00:06:22.740> help<00:06:22.860> you<00:06:23.180> start<00:06:24.180> to

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:24.330 
because that'll help you start to

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:27.080 
because that'll help you start to
establish<00:06:24.480> a<00:06:24.840> family<00:06:25.140> relationship<00:06:26.130> you

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:27.090 
establish a family relationship you

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:28.730 
establish a family relationship you
should<00:06:27.240> contact<00:06:27.690> your<00:06:27.810> breed<00:06:28.020> association

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:28.740 
should contact your breed association

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:30.320 
should contact your breed association
and<00:06:28.860> report<00:06:29.220> the<00:06:29.340> issue<00:06:29.490> to<00:06:29.760> them<00:06:29.910> you<00:06:30.180> can

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:30.330 
and report the issue to them you can

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:31.880 
and report the issue to them you can
describe<00:06:30.630> it<00:06:30.900> to<00:06:31.020> them<00:06:31.260> probably<00:06:31.500> send<00:06:31.770> them

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:31.890 
describe it to them probably send them

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:33.400 
describe it to them probably send them
some<00:06:32.070> of<00:06:32.190> those<00:06:32.250> pictures<00:06:32.669> that<00:06:32.700> you've<00:06:32.970> taken

and representative the breed association
can<00:06:36.600> tell<00:06:36.840> you<00:06:36.960> if<00:06:37.080> it's<00:06:37.230> a

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:37.560 
can tell you if it's a

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:40.010 
can tell you if it's a
