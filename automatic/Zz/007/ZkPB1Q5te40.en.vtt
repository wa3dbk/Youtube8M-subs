the<00:00:42.149> ground<00:00:43.370> we<00:00:44.370> can<00:00:44.520> go<00:00:44.640> ahead<00:00:44.760> and<00:00:44.969> zoom<00:00:45.239> in

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
the ground we can go ahead and zoom in

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.740 
the ground we can go ahead and zoom in
on<00:00:45.960> one<00:00:46.140> of<00:00:46.170> these<00:00:46.469> leaves<00:00:47.160> maybe<00:00:48.090> get<00:00:48.539> some

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
on one of these leaves maybe get some

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.630 
on one of these leaves maybe get some
close-up<00:00:49.260> look<00:00:49.500> they<00:00:49.950> are<00:00:50.100> moving<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.520> little

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
close-up look they are moving a little

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.479 
close-up look they are moving a little
bit<00:00:50.760> because<00:00:50.940> of<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.300> wind<00:00:51.510> but<00:00:52.280> there's<00:00:53.280> that

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
bit because of the wind but there's that

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
it looks great on the screen I don't

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.819 
it looks great on the screen I don't
know<00:00:56.699> how<00:00:57.629> it's<00:00:57.780> going<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.050> look<00:00:58.140> once<00:00:58.649> i

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
not do any editing there's some long

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.000 
not do any editing there's some long
distance<00:01:03.149> I'm<00:01:03.780> going<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:03.989> attempt<00:01:04.350> to<00:01:04.409> zoom<00:01:04.769> in

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
distance I'm going to attempt to zoom in

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.420 
distance I'm going to attempt to zoom in
real<00:01:05.640> quick<00:01:05.820> just<00:01:06.720> pinch<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.260> zoom<00:01:07.290> in<00:01:07.710> you'll

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
real quick just pinch to zoom in you'll

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.800 
real quick just pinch to zoom in you'll
see<00:01:09.710> it<00:01:10.710> looks<00:01:11.159> fairly<00:01:11.760> blurry<00:01:12.270> I<00:01:12.360> just<00:01:12.600> touch

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
see it looks fairly blurry I just touch

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.480 
see it looks fairly blurry I just touch
on<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.110> screen<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.470> take<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:13.770> picture<00:01:14.070> as<00:01:14.280> well

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
on the screen to take a picture as well

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.060 
on the screen to take a picture as well
so<00:01:14.909> I<00:01:15.180> could<00:01:15.659> just<00:01:15.840> I<00:01:16.140> just<00:01:16.259> took<00:01:16.560> another<00:01:16.860> one

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
so I could just I just took another one

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.520 
so I could just I just took another one
so<00:01:17.280> hopefully<00:01:17.549> it<00:01:17.640> doesn't<00:01:17.790> affect<00:01:18.530> the

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
so hopefully it doesn't affect the

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.590 
so hopefully it doesn't affect the
quality<00:01:20.310> of<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.880> video<00:01:21.150> I'm<00:01:21.240> going<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.450> try

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
quality of the video I'm going to try

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.950 
quality of the video I'm going to try
and<00:01:21.630> zoom<00:01:21.869> in<00:01:22.020> on<00:01:22.110> these<00:01:22.229> leaves<00:01:22.560> as<00:01:22.860> well<00:01:23.960> so

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
and zoom in on these leaves as well so

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.770 
and zoom in on these leaves as well so
there<00:01:25.170> you<00:01:25.290> go<00:01:25.350> there's<00:01:25.619> that<00:01:26.150> looks<00:01:27.150> decent<00:01:27.390> I

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
there you go there's that looks decent I

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:28.789 
there you go there's that looks decent I
mean<00:01:27.990> obviously<00:01:28.110> you're<00:01:28.350> going<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.590> lose

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
mean obviously you're going to lose

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:34.640 
mean obviously you're going to lose
quality<00:01:29.670> when<00:01:30.420> you<00:01:30.540> do<00:01:31.159> zoom<00:01:32.159> in<00:01:33.530> but<00:01:34.530> there

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
quality when you do zoom in but there

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.399 
quality when you do zoom in but there
you<00:01:34.740> have<00:01:34.890> it<00:01:34.920> overall<00:01:35.579> just<00:01:36.110> test<00:01:37.110> video

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
you have it overall just test video

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.280 
you have it overall just test video
