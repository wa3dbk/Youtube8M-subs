I'm<00:00:25.080> gonna<00:00:25.170> be<00:00:25.289> using<00:00:25.730> bhinna<00:00:26.730> my<00:00:26.880> EDC<00:00:27.090> for

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
I'm gonna be using bhinna my EDC for

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.800 
I'm gonna be using bhinna my EDC for
over<00:00:27.779> a<00:00:27.840> year<00:00:27.900> now<00:00:28.080> and<00:00:29.210> it's<00:00:30.210> certainly<00:00:30.570> well

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
over a year now and it's certainly well

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.100 
over a year now and it's certainly well
I've<00:00:31.590> got<00:00:32.009> it<00:00:32.099> wet<00:00:32.309> outdoors<00:00:32.930> it's<00:00:33.930> been

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
I've got it wet outdoors it's been

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.450 
I've got it wet outdoors it's been
dropped<00:00:34.410> and<00:00:34.590> kicked<00:00:34.800> around<00:00:34.920> it's<00:00:35.250> being

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
dropped and kicked around it's being

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.860 
dropped and kicked around it's being
carried<00:00:35.880> on<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.090> chain<00:00:36.360> of<00:00:36.540> all<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.750> other

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
carried on the chain of all the other

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.090 
carried on the chain of all the other
stuff<00:00:37.140> and<00:00:37.410> it<00:00:37.649> always<00:00:37.829> always<00:00:38.250> works<00:00:38.820> but<00:00:39.690> now

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
stuff and it always always works but now

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.190 
stuff and it always always works but now
to<00:00:41.100> take<00:00:41.280> it<00:00:41.430> a<00:00:41.520> little<00:00:41.579> bit<00:00:41.730> further<00:00:42.090> I<00:00:42.719> want

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
to take it a little bit further I want

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.940 
to take it a little bit further I want
to<00:00:43.260> test<00:00:43.559> it<00:00:44.149> way<00:00:45.149> beyond<00:00:45.660> this<00:00:45.809> capability<00:00:46.140> so

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
to test it way beyond this capability so

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.459 
to test it way beyond this capability so
don't<00:00:47.789> be<00:00:47.879> surprised<00:00:48.270> if<00:00:48.390> it<00:00:48.539> fails<00:00:48.840> but<00:00:49.350> it's

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
don't be surprised if it fails but it's

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.170 
don't be surprised if it fails but it's
worth<00:00:49.680> doing<00:00:49.710> it's<00:00:50.219> important<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:50.879> know<00:00:51.000> the

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
worth doing it's important to know the

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.900 
worth doing it's important to know the
limitations<00:00:51.570> of<00:00:51.870> your<00:00:51.960> kick<00:00:52.260> so<00:00:52.829> what<00:00:53.820> we're

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
limitations of your kick so what we're

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.850 
limitations of your kick so what we're
going<00:00:54.000> to<00:00:54.059> do<00:00:54.180> now<00:00:54.390> is<00:00:55.289> which<00:00:55.559> is<00:00:55.680> from<00:00:55.800> the

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
going to do now is which is from the

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.670 
going to do now is which is from the
proof<00:00:56.100> one<00:00:56.520> exactly<00:00:57.090> what<00:00:57.329> we've<00:00:57.480> got<00:00:57.660> all<00:00:58.500> it

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
proof one exactly what we've got all it

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.189 
proof one exactly what we've got all it
is<00:00:58.829> it's<00:00:59.699> just<00:00:59.789> a<00:00:59.969> fog<00:01:00.149> standard<00:01:00.600> Joyce<00:01:00.989> out

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
is it's just a fog standard Joyce out

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.820 
is it's just a fog standard Joyce out
battery<00:01:01.620> it's<00:01:02.160> no<00:01:02.370> fancy<00:01:02.820> lithium<00:01:03.300> as<00:01:04.049> you<00:01:04.739> can

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
battery it's no fancy lithium as you can

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.609 
battery it's no fancy lithium as you can
see<00:01:05.040> it's<00:01:05.250> got<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.519> old<00:01:05.760> seal<00:01:06.030> on<00:01:06.180> there

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
see it's got the old seal on there

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:10.490 
see it's got the old seal on there
no<00:01:07.619> adaptions<00:01:08.100> and<00:01:08.960> that's<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.170> returned

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
no adaptions and that's the returned

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.690 
no adaptions and that's the returned
inside<00:01:11.299> we're<00:01:12.299> going<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.510> do<00:01:13.189> is<00:01:14.189> just<00:01:14.430> put<00:01:14.640> it

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
inside we're going to do is just put it

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:22.170 
inside we're going to do is just put it
together

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:22.180 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.150 

oh<00:01:22.210> it's<00:01:22.960> nice<00:01:23.050> and<00:01:23.320> tight<00:01:23.440> as<00:01:23.710> you<00:01:23.830> can<00:01:23.950> see

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
seal these bags up yep there we go the

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.840 
seal these bags up yep there we go the
light<00:02:07.180> is<00:02:07.330> in<00:02:07.479> the<00:02:07.570> back<00:02:07.720> of<00:02:07.900> water<00:02:08.550> now<00:02:09.550> let's

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
light is in the back of water now let's

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.690 
light is in the back of water now let's
put<00:02:10.000> it<00:02:10.060> in<00:02:10.149> a<00:02:10.179> freezer<00:02:10.540> I<00:02:11.310> want<00:02:12.310> is<00:02:12.400> to<00:02:12.430> be<00:02:12.670> a

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
put it in a freezer I want is to be a

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.580 
put it in a freezer I want is to be a
solid<00:02:13.300> block<00:02:13.450> of<00:02:13.600> ice<00:02:13.720> if<00:02:13.990> it's<00:02:14.110> still<00:02:14.320> lit

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
solid block of ice if it's still lit

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:20.010 
solid block of ice if it's still lit
that's<00:02:15.040> the<00:02:15.220> test<00:02:18.450> well<00:02:19.450> let's<00:02:19.630> see<00:02:19.810> how<00:02:19.900> we

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
that's the test well let's see how we

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:29.150 
that's the test well let's see how we
get<00:02:20.140> on

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.610 

see<00:02:30.160> we're<00:02:30.370> done<00:02:30.550> this<00:02:31.480> is<00:02:31.540> about<00:02:31.900> 40<00:02:32.410> minutes

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
see we're done this is about 40 minutes

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:53.540 
see we're done this is about 40 minutes
off

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:03:16.640 

well<00:02:54.550> can't<00:02:55.180> believe<00:02:55.450> that<00:03:05.250> check<00:03:06.250> it<00:03:06.370> out

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.930 

well<00:03:17.650> I<00:03:17.680> suppose<00:03:18.010> it<00:03:18.160> could<00:03:18.310> have<00:03:18.400> gone<00:03:18.580> in<00:03:18.760> for

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
well I suppose it could have gone in for

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.250 
well I suppose it could have gone in for
a<00:03:18.970> bit<00:03:19.090> longer<00:03:19.270> but<00:03:19.650> solid<00:03:20.650> enough<00:03:22.170> yeah<00:03:23.170> it

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
a bit longer but solid enough yeah it

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:31.410 
a bit longer but solid enough yeah it
still<00:03:23.500> works<00:03:29.910> that's<00:03:30.910> what<00:03:31.150> it's<00:03:31.300> worth

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
still works that's what it's worth

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:32.580 
still works that's what it's worth
getting<00:03:31.600> good<00:03:32.020> KITT

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
getting good KITT

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:38.130 
getting good KITT
so<00:03:33.280> there<00:03:33.430> it<00:03:33.520> is<00:03:36.030> I'm<00:03:37.030> not<00:03:37.240> being<00:03:37.510> paid<00:03:37.780> or

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 
so there it is I'm not being paid or

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.130 
so there it is I'm not being paid or
