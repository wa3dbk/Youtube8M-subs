00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
early I thought they were a little

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.600 
early I thought they were a little
nervous<00:01:12.750> as<00:01:13.080> team<00:01:13.380> got<00:01:13.680> going<00:01:13.920> is<00:01:14.070> actually<00:01:14.430> I

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
nervous as team got going is actually I

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.130 
nervous as team got going is actually I
was<00:01:14.790> kind<00:01:14.850> of<00:01:15.060> plead<00:01:15.299> to<00:01:15.420> better<00:01:15.570> we<00:01:15.840> got<00:01:15.960> more

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
was kind of plead to better we got more

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.840 
was kind of plead to better we got more
in<00:01:16.229> team<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.950> better<00:01:17.130> everything<00:01:17.580> fit

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
in team and the better everything fit

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.340 
in team and the better everything fit
together<00:01:17.970> they<00:01:18.360> got<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.540> little<00:01:18.689> more<00:01:18.869> i<00:01:19.020> think

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
together they got a little more i think

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.870 
together they got a little more i think
was<00:01:19.500> later<00:01:19.710> in<00:01:19.830> practice<00:01:20.189> they<00:01:20.340> start<00:01:20.610> feeling

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
was later in practice they start feeling

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.010 
was later in practice they start feeling
more<00:01:21.000> comfortable<00:01:21.180> with<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.570> ones<00:01:21.780> when<00:01:21.990> they

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
more comfortable with the ones when they

doing the wrong thing just make a high

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.880 
doing the wrong thing just make a high
throw<00:02:12.750> because<00:02:12.959> there's<00:02:13.380> more<00:02:13.500> nerves<00:02:13.740> and

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
throw because there's more nerves and

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.140 
throw because there's more nerves and
all<00:02:14.010> of<00:02:14.070> a<00:02:14.130> sudden<00:02:14.160> he<00:02:14.490> just<00:02:14.640> started<00:02:14.910> making

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
all of a sudden he just started making

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.600

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
the place so and I think the next we

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:18.860 
the place so and I think the next we
could<00:02:17.790> be<00:02:17.880> very<00:02:18.090> interesting<00:02:18.120> to<00:02:18.540> see<00:02:18.660> when<00:02:18.780> it

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
could be very interesting to see when it

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.570

anything<00:03:57.740> learn<00:03:57.980> some<00:03:58.160> things<00:03:58.190> could<00:03:58.520> be

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:58.580 
anything learn some things could be

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.310 
anything learn some things could be
beneficial<00:03:59.150> in<00:03:59.420> the<00:03:59.480> spring<00:03:59.870> and<00:04:00.050> maybe<00:04:00.200> he

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:00.320 
beneficial in the spring and maybe he

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.020 
beneficial in the spring and maybe he
just<00:04:00.350> didn't<00:04:00.680> have<00:04:00.710> time<00:04:00.950> to<00:04:01.160> work<00:04:01.310> on<00:04:01.490> while<00:04:02.000> I

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030
