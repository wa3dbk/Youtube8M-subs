00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 Welcome to the league of legends today 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:08.910
 I will be back 90 info will appear 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:10.679
 namely libya style Gerron also skips 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.670
 Friends say you have yourself 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.110
 between and he is in here now 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.219
 an armor packed looks 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:20.130
 bit like as one of the 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:22.920
 warhammer figures but space space 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.300
 Marine exactly space marine to the space 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.910
 itself has also done a lot 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.189
 I also think so now 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.420
 already very cool but also 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.840
 a lot has happened to the space 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:37.200
 if we ever throw in the cinema said 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:40.350
 with the sword, and that hurt ours 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.710
 sign get students around us I can 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.829
 yes show again are also very cool 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:51.180
 made from our marriage and says ours 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.710
 Judgment that we are attacking once 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.140
 they're really cool, too 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.440
 really great design and then to good 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.300
 Last of course, our ultimate and 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:03.449
 the ultimate looks like this and 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.590
 Although so comes a huge flash of 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:09.950
 sky and hits the 1 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:12.240
 yes that's it with the space 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.439
 yes you look old already 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.299
 already changed tremendously so I think 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.150
 The very successful looks really nice 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.530
 from that too with the sword 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.580
 whirl here this is really a great 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.960
 cool animation I made really cool 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:29.850
 I'll show you the same again 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:31.680
 emotes all then it was already 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.009
 again almost there we have for once 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.009
 the sound 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.240
 then we have the joke 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:02:04.990
 the dance and of course the laughs and too 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:05.710
 Of course you have the last good one 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.970
 recall 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:11.350
 because it's not exactly what he is 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:13.390
 has changed quite a bit but seems so 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.130
 In any case changed super yes 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.290
 I want to say what you want for today 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.490

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.340
 As always in the comments what you from 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.810
 new skin hold if you skins 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:27.100
 buy yourself picture yourself if often 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:29.050
 I like to play and yes then I would say 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.820

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.740
 you liked the idea and 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.910

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.540
