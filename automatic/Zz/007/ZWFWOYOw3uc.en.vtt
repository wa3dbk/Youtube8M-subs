00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.420
 hi to all this summer victim is 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:25.380
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:28.650
 special video that responds to a 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.050
 comment that told me how to shut up 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.260
 a green background charge on video not 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.969
 of video editor before starting life 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.980
 today thank you for the 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.040
 300 views on the chain that's what makes me 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:46.200
 extremely pleasure it makes balas effect 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:47.730
 very cold or 12 days we saw that we 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.449
 reaches the 200 cities is already at 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:54.449
 three hundred is extraordinary and so 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.190
 we will start the video without more 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.670
 delay I do not know if it says but 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.109
 it is not serious 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:03.390
 so you have you have your video 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.769
 with the green fund is the object to the 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.390
 nobody in front of me we'll say it's 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.560
 that's it it's a shame to say the 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.080
 funds poured room to all that is 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:17.100
 green that's the object the blue has stopped 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.270
 the object here it was for not for not 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.100
 have to make a video with a green background 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.470
 and everything and everything I told myself we're going 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.140
 putting green is a blue object in front of 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:28.700
 like that it makes a good contrast so 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.700
 we're going to open video pal video editor 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:39.180
 so hop we fear the project we add 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.490
 so already the video 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.649
 finally me it is the image with the fund 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.649
 green by you too it can be a 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:49.979
 picture there is no door no worries 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:53.140
 here and we add the deceased the yes the 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:57.130
 decor leu leu 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.460
 what was in the background we will 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.090
 say that 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:05.909
 I'm going to take that, so that's very 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:09.490
 important on the timeline plus the 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:13.209
 elements are down the more they are they 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:14.500
 are a layer underneath so I 'm 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:14.980
 very much if you understood but I'm going 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.150
 show you 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:23.380
 so already up here so here that's it I the 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:26.200
 put on top well that this image is going 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.120
 appear above this one observation 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.030
 we're going more 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.500
 this image if we see on stage has 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:36.180
 so here the two are superimposed you 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:38.590
 can see that it's over here and so 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.890
 we want everything to be transparent so 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:44.170
 you have to remove the green in fact 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:47.140
 green in transport so there are two 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:51.250
 ways to do the first way so 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:53.050
 you do not want to install others 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.030
 programs and everything and everything and you have 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:58.360
 that video no video editor is very 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:00.070
 simple you go into effect so you 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:04.989
 select well the green background dots 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:09.760
 Finally, the green fund actually efex fx 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:13.840
 here you add chroma key chroma 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:15.549
 key had germany you configure so 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:19.500
 by default it will take the color that 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:23.560
 had more sure about the sweat on the picture 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:25.060
 so so just do you just have to 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.380
 click somewhere and that will make it 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:30.250
 transparent nail of plant 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:33.610
 transparency to what you want and 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:36.370
 then got here you can see that there is 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:42.459
 little ones wait I'll try to 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:44.940
 zoom in to see if you're here 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:47.590
 little green pixels that remain 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.420
 around the blue and that will make me 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.640
 surprise who final so what I 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:54.070
 advises c2c to adjust a little the 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.340
 settings here to move a little bit for 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.470
 see 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.930
 I'm always doing it all the time but if 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.820
 it is sometimes if it is thick-bottomed 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.010
 have problems so you have to 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:04.010
 all the green disappear here we are 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:07.549
 you have your object 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:12.650
 blue to me I have the blue object you do 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:19.579
 ok then this clause and here you are 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:24.020
 had yes I did something 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:32.210
 bad month start again here at 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:33.560
 okay so I understand it actually 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.840
 must be well adjusted because it can 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.850
 make transparent as I do not see 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:41.120
 that's it's good good you need a little 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:43.660
 hit at at 7 bar you look at one 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:47.270
 little and normally it should work 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:49.940
 so here we have our video finally here 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:52.340
 with your object and the background behind that 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:53.419
 it was the first way 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.729
 the second way to do that with 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:56.690
 filter posts so I'm going to put the 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:59.270
 download link in the 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:05.150
 description with all this filter so 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:07.100
 you open it works only if it's 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:09.979
 an image so also it's a video 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:13.280
 made video no video editor if it's 

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:16.849
 an image to make it go faster 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:20.410
 you have on green background finally your thing 

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:25.580
 of funds to 6 and movie just a picture 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:29.690
 take this you do here colors of 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:33.410
 transparency ben the beautiful perf and yes the 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:35.360
 color so you choose that's it 

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:38.060
 I chose the green tolerance 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:42.050
 wanted it's ok and so all that is 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:45.500
 in small dot in small squares screening 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:46.669
 will be transparent on the final rendering so 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:53.210
 there workers there are little things 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:56.870
 so we can maybe increase a little bit 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:59.260
 goodbye to tolerance or increase it I know 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:03.229
 more who rent valdinguer months 

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:07.760
 had had to bleach it up 

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:11.419
 put 100% here and so all the green 

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:12.420
 gone and we have another object 

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:15.420
 with 

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:19.950
 a transparent background so I save 

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:25.260
 and under saves under penalty I have 

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:29.160
 always registered and we come back here 

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:34.560
 and then we add so that's for sure 

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:40.380
 office I believe yeah that's it we remove 

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:44.580
 that and we put the green fund here and so 

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:46.350
 you will have the same rendering his technique 

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:47.750
 with photofilter works only for 

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:50.910
 still images 

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:52.770
 if you have a video the first 

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:54.300
 Trial method is recommended because 

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:57.420
 that it makes me so much to take a 

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:58.950
 frame by frame and go would be a little too much 

00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:01.140
 hard month let them not that this video 

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:04.160
 you liked it we meet again 

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:04.160
 See you
