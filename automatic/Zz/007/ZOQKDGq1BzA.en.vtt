00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
Jesus far beyond any man why did Jesus

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.230 
Jesus far beyond any man why did Jesus
have<00:01:11.010> to<00:01:11.130> look<00:01:11.340> like<00:01:11.520> something<00:01:12.000> that<00:01:12.030> he

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
have to look like something that he

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.800 
have to look like something that he
wasn't

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
wasn't

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.190 
wasn't
here's<00:01:13.470> why<00:01:13.710> because<00:01:14.159> we<00:01:15.000> look<00:01:15.689> something

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
here's why because we look something

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.600 
here's why because we look something
look<00:01:16.560> like<00:01:16.740> something<00:01:17.159> we<00:01:17.280> were<00:01:17.400> never

creation

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.710 

so<00:01:21.830> Jesus<00:01:22.340> was<00:01:22.370> marked<00:01:22.940> beyond<00:01:23.150> any<00:01:23.390> manner

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
so Jesus was marked beyond any manner

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.080 
so Jesus was marked beyond any manner
because<00:01:24.710> we<00:01:24.920> had<00:01:25.130> looked<00:01:25.370> like<00:01:25.520> something<00:01:25.820> we

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
because we had looked like something we

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:27.730 
because we had looked like something we
were<00:01:26.210> never<00:01:26.420> created<00:01:26.630> the<00:01:27.020> people<00:01:27.380> versus

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
were never created the people versus

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.180 
were never created the people versus
nice<00:01:28.090> he<00:01:29.090> had<00:01:29.300> to<00:01:29.450> become<00:01:29.840> something<00:01:30.140> so<00:01:31.040> that

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.190 
nice he had to become something so that

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.240 
nice he had to become something so that

sense and the problem is is

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.970 
sense and the problem is is
theologically<00:03:26.660> it<00:03:26.989> will<00:03:27.170> make<00:03:27.319> sense<00:03:27.530> but
