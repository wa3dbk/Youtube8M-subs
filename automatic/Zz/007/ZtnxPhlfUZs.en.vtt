deck it's very colorful

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.560 
deck it's very colorful

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
and obviously it took five years to make

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.890 
and obviously it took five years to make
it's<00:01:48.810> very<00:01:48.990> detailed<00:01:49.400> at<00:01:50.400> the<00:01:51.060> bottom<00:01:51.390> of<00:01:51.600> the

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:51.900 
it's very detailed at the bottom of the

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.020 
it's very detailed at the bottom of the
current<00:01:52.290> version<00:01:52.680> is<00:01:52.890> a<00:01:52.920> key<00:01:53.310> word<00:01:53.520> to<00:01:53.940> the

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
current version is a key word to the

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.380 
current version is a key word to the
card<00:01:54.330> as<00:01:54.600> well<00:01:55.440> as<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.710> index<00:01:56.040> at<00:01:56.220> the<00:01:56.310> top<00:01:56.550> and

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
card as well as the index at the top and

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.440 
card as well as the index at the top and
then<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:58.650> nice<00:01:58.860> shiny<00:01:59.130> border<00:01:59.700> along<00:02:00.390> with

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
then the nice shiny border along with

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.040 
then the nice shiny border along with
the<00:02:00.870> graphic<00:02:01.260> in<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.409> middle<00:02:02.750> when<00:02:03.750> you<00:02:03.870> get

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.050 
the graphic in the middle when you get

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.469 
the graphic in the middle when you get
into<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.440> majors<00:02:04.830> like<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.790> hangman<00:02:06.210> here

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
into the majors like the hangman here

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.259 
into the majors like the hangman here
for<00:02:06.690> example<00:02:06.990> you'll<00:02:07.950> have<00:02:07.979> at<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:08.670> bottom<00:02:09.030> a

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:09.269 
for example you'll have at the bottom a

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:12.710 
for example you'll have at the bottom a
Hebrew<00:02:10.259> letter<00:02:10.500> and<00:02:10.830> an<00:02:11.580> astrological<00:02:12.060> symbol

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
Hebrew letter and an astrological symbol

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.020 
Hebrew letter and an astrological symbol
so<00:02:13.260> different<00:02:13.950> majors<00:02:14.400> have<00:02:14.640> different

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
so different majors have different

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.170 
so different majors have different
symbols<00:02:15.390> and<00:02:15.569> letters<00:02:16.580> for<00:02:17.580> example<00:02:18.030> and

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
symbols and letters for example and

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.590
