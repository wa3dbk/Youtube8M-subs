00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:05.670
 Wehrheim YouTube I'm afraid it will not and was pleased to have a tool com Tel 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.459
 with the Siemann 

00:00:08.459 --> 00:00:09.740
 Yes and 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.579
 First, the background of what I do not see a ps3 gm plans 

00:00:14.579 --> 00:00:17.329
 and Simon will remember what you say 

00:00:17.329 --> 00:00:21.579
 yes, it's a Dominik Gerzer BMW not rattling about Dominik Benedek 

00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:24.359
 but from another Dominik from our plan 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.919
 he is empty on his gun with the Parish 21 case called GP 2000 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:32.530
 with magazine expansion it will be, I think 

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:34.660
 Raider per full force per 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.250
 down in the ProB 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.680
 yes why the camp on the 4 3 n if so, as we believe ever mentioned 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.570
 Varela has a clear parade now 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:45.800
 gained 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:51.400
 and this is one of the Sanitärtrakt Christel Capture has the 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.980
 I meet again » 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.310
 as it was then and nobody wanted to 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:00.680
 Remmel important will make his air and my description of his whole none 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.840
 At the same time, however, it makes a difference to the prescriptions 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.970
 and it's just about 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:08.640
 Capture stabbing 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.920
 and well what happens so finale is not celebrated on irradiated 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.920
 Fire what if i explained why but just so it is a war and 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.230
 in order to see their more in Gampel London - so come by him so too 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:22.850
 on our Channel Geneva St 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.260
 but still an own goal 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.350
 Sewer pipes from time to time while trying to run could also stop by 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.370
 I then directly under the bonnet celebrated the description and now 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:34.840
 I can not go back yet he wanted something too 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.840
 yes to «The market is far from telling 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.630
 at years though is Gabriel 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.700
 After three days, the message that a ps3 pass has been introduced is bursting 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.010
 becomes 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.289
 To those who do not know 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:51.990
 The Christ series fits the simple temporary story one buys in 

00:01:51.989 --> 00:01:53.150
 play 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.680
 and with these there is still Socotra 5 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.259
 contain 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.539
 and this short you have to enter then just percent at the sudden 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.690
 and in this game that you bought also to play Euro 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.989
 the meaning of the whole story is that would be sold to players again 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:16.760
 Ladies money can be the buyer the used game which is not online 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:17.749
 play 

00:02:17.749 --> 00:02:23.749
 Summer has to buy it around at the ruler of the game this One Online Code 

00:02:23.749 --> 00:02:25.639
 so that can also play 

00:02:25.639 --> 00:02:27.379
 and we 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:30.139
 which one do you think about the whole thing 

00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:33.199
 hanns-ulrich Hafez has not heard of it yet, but I have to say 

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:35.019
 it has become pretty 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:39.489
 Percent of Latvia for our playstation player Merkel had because 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:40.509
 their 

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:43.389
 I think it's just that they can share the same custody 

00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:46.099
 Of course, Katy also wants to protect him in Kriftel 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:49.849
 things in that direction but when I used my game purchase contract 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:50.640
 or not 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.949
 I think there is also online play 

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:56.049
 and you can do that as a wall of protection you can think then one more 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:57.819
 Sell ​​Cortex or 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:00.579
 Germersheim sell 12 percent possible 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:01.639
 So if you are 

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:04.749
 A steak used up you have to practically there still a suitcase to buy 

00:03:04.749 --> 00:03:06.010
 and then wants to play man 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:06.760
 percent 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.370
 and this code he is more likely to have been the tree house costing around ten euros 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.799
 just did not even read gate to gate 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:18.140
 4 So my opinion is that she has been with it for months and more 

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:18.870
 play 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.159
 used buys but that each of the games then the same original and new 

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:23.549
 buys 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:27.269
 and at the moment moneymaking race is finally 5 so I'm feeling hungry 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:33.559
 I also think about the bills »May percent to at cost around the 10 

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:36.509
 20 euros 49 

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:40.339
 it dies and then so much MCE acquires new euro 

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:42.889
 Spier was already almost new press 

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:46.169
 a hall is almost rip off for me too 

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:49.109
 March has been on the Bernese 

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:53.659
 from the to-do-to-do-toilet or sudden-hit game said 

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:57.180
 the chancellor has his own opinion. Shoots make it that good 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.779
 or not, but I think masts will be 

00:03:59.779 --> 00:04:02.809
 This is so enjoyable especially and offers legs 

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:07.109
 Dr percent of your opinion is of course the quality of the Open 

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:10.979
 Company rewrite with subtitles 

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:17.880
 since I'm writing last topic and that the law percent 978 by the 

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:19.379
 right threw his head 

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:21.370
 and the law says that 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:22.599
 sda around 

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:26.989
 Year films must appear on and players on it 

00:04:27.569 --> 00:04:33.169
 on YouTube can not be shown without a license and percent of the same 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:35.099
 Bullshit Baltes 

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:38.099
 Vizio once said the oldest in Geneva 

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:43.059
 Schwarzenegger shared that Baltes is easy craters of celebrities 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:45.740
 what do you think about it 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:50.220
 I have no idea I always feel informed about the law 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.500
 but so I have listened to Pompeii several times now and that has changed 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:54.400
 inflamed 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.930
 Houses leadership goal 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:58.129
 so the forehead 

00:04:58.129 --> 00:05:01.319
 so if it's not affected then it's really stupid because 

00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:04.729
 I think we do not do anything forbidden so to speak so we 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:08.169
 it would be an advertisement we recommend games continue we say what they are good 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:12.490
 find what we think is bad it is a TV review also to play 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:15.490
 and thinks what should the game makers have against it 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.589
 Wasmeier 

00:05:17.589 --> 00:05:21.199
 that's also 30 Wendy Russian roulette Black Jack o did that 

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:23.479
 Game not played by yourself so 

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:25.050
 should he then 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:28.050
 stimulate, so to speak, to buy, that is perhaps on 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.819
 that is as I said free advertising in the east of the city do nothing 

00:05:32.819 --> 00:05:37.379
 the whole percent points the judges make their last it was recognized him 

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:37.990
 leaves 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:41.860
 and I'm going to buy the new game or get off the beach so scholl 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:44.189
 is the opioid for Guingamp noise 

00:05:44.189 --> 00:05:47.870
 this sum is from the player Kloft and the direction is there 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:51.600
 Well, the manager thinks he does not always say everything about the game 

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:55.180
 Everything is always beautifully shown, wood art and so on 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.029
 maybe not my graphic 

00:05:57.029 --> 00:06:00.099
 and then, of course, if you like to multiply, of course, if that's the case 

00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:01.689
 no longer works 

00:06:01.689 --> 00:06:04.889
 that probably switch to my lady or something, or is there for everyone 

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:05.930
 Platforms approx 

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:09.749
 Red I'm afraid I'll just apply to platform 

00:06:09.749 --> 00:06:13.939
 as for a platform registered in America because the net is out 

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:15.169
 America 

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:18.629
 So MyVideo so we are then increasingly strengthened 

00:06:19.319 --> 00:06:20.680
 so as not to 

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.680
 to help the hearing of two lolling 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:28.849
 at the Herner Straße they will show time 

00:06:28.849 --> 00:06:30.629
 look at the clock 

00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:32.439
 Not really 

00:06:32.439 --> 00:06:35.439
 Well you are there but will not look at the clock 

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:39.300
 I hope for understanding, unfortunately, piling up 

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.699
 for that he has a bit of jerking 

00:06:44.699 --> 00:06:46.090
 Art of the Sea Bonds 

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:47.000
 St 

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.699
 Aya here I'm at 59 

00:06:49.699 --> 00:06:52.400
 I have the option 2 price 

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:54.990
 Ziehm guest victory and Master started 

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:57.119
 and stuck for sun or 

00:06:57.119 --> 00:07:00.259
 yes we are almost about the time I think so 

00:07:00.259 --> 00:07:02.860
 yes, um 

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:07.069
 he waited again no matter whether you remember SEO question ever what should 

00:07:07.069 --> 00:07:08.960
 to know that again 

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:14.490
 EADS NV takes place here and who drives the PS off and from set 

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:17.509
 around 978 yes 

00:07:17.509 --> 00:07:18.759
 we are exactly 

00:07:18.759 --> 00:07:21.759
 It would be nice if we had eleven sick people 

00:07:22.529 --> 00:07:24.009
 yes and we could have her here 

00:07:24.009 --> 00:07:25.110
 we throw 

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:28.210
 Critics and houses whether such liked or not 

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:30.719
 and stop by the canal 

00:07:30.719 --> 00:07:33.270
 and so 

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:35.789
 Soto whose opera was last
