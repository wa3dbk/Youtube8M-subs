more exposure to numbers letters words
at<00:01:31.979> any<00:01:32.820> age<00:01:33.119> is<00:01:33.710> best<00:01:34.710> for<00:01:34.950> them<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.280> learn

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
at any age is best for them to learn

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:40.190 
at any age is best for them to learn
only<00:01:38.159> thing<00:01:38.520> I<00:01:38.640> found<00:01:38.939> probably<00:01:39.540> is<00:01:39.630> downfall

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
only thing I found probably is downfall

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.620 
only thing I found probably is downfall
with<00:01:40.380> it<00:01:40.560> is<00:01:40.770> it<00:01:41.070> does<00:01:41.280> take<00:01:41.310> them<00:01:41.970> so<00:01:42.509> they

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
with it is it does take them so they

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.219 
with it is it does take them so they
have<00:01:42.750> two<00:01:42.869> bigger<00:01:43.079> coins<00:01:44.240> like<00:01:45.240> that<00:01:45.509> size<00:01:45.780> and

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
have two bigger coins like that size and

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.700 
have two bigger coins like that size and
the<00:01:46.530> small<00:01:46.799> coins<00:01:47.100> like<00:01:47.310> that<00:01:48.350> not<00:01:49.350> that<00:01:49.560> much

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
the small coins like that not that much

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.819 
the small coins like that not that much
smaller<00:01:50.009> really<00:01:50.780> so<00:01:51.780> this<00:01:51.960> it<00:01:52.200> comes<00:01:52.350> with<00:01:52.590> ten

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
smaller really so this it comes with ten

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:57.679 
smaller really so this it comes with ten
coins<00:01:53.750> 10-spot<00:01:54.829> for<00:01:55.829> any<00:01:56.149> bigger<00:01:57.149> ones<00:01:57.390> five

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
coins 10-spot for any bigger ones five

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.530 
coins 10-spot for any bigger ones five
smaller<00:01:58.079> and<00:01:58.560> corresponding<00:01:59.490> the<00:02:00.090> same<00:02:00.299> in

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
smaller and corresponding the same in

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.420 
smaller and corresponding the same in
the<00:02:00.659> small<00:02:00.899> ones<00:02:01.110> we've<00:02:01.770> lost<00:02:01.950> some<00:02:02.250> of<00:02:02.280> our

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
the small ones we've lost some of our

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.980 
the small ones we've lost some of our
coins<00:02:02.700> along<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.119> way<00:02:03.240> well<00:02:03.570> they're<00:02:03.899> not

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
coins along the way well they're not

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.330 
coins along the way well they're not
lost<00:02:04.200> I'm<00:02:04.380> sure<00:02:04.530> they're<00:02:04.710> in<00:02:04.950> amongst

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
lost I'm sure they're in amongst

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.500 
lost I'm sure they're in amongst
somewhere<00:02:06.180> actually<00:02:06.450> now<00:02:06.570> to<00:02:06.630> area

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:07.510 
somewhere actually now to area

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:13.650 
somewhere actually now to area
and<00:02:10.140> yet<00:02:11.140> basically<00:02:11.560> the<00:02:12.190> child<00:02:12.880> it<00:02:13.180> just<00:02:13.420> puts

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
and yet basically the child it just puts

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:19.620 
and yet basically the child it just puts
the<00:02:13.810> coins<00:02:14.110> in<00:02:14.440> the<00:02:14.650> top<00:02:14.860> and<00:02:15.370> they<00:02:18.630> it's

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
the coins in the top and they it's

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.400 
the coins in the top and they it's
definitely<00:02:20.200> a<00:02:20.230> lot<00:02:20.380> of<00:02:20.470> fun<00:02:20.680> when<00:02:22.170> you<00:02:23.170> have<00:02:23.320> it

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
definitely a lot of fun when you have it

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.200 
definitely a lot of fun when you have it
on<00:02:23.500> the<00:02:23.620> counting<00:02:24.040> function<00:02:24.250> and<00:02:24.730> you<00:02:24.880> put<00:02:25.090> the

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210 
on the counting function and you put the

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:28.980 
on the counting function and you put the
coins<00:02:25.450> in<00:02:25.630> there's<00:02:26.050> a<00:02:26.140> little<00:02:27.690> clicker<00:02:28.690> in

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
coins in there's a little clicker in

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.590 
coins in there's a little clicker in
here<00:02:29.350> that<00:02:29.860> can<00:02:30.040> tell<00:02:30.310> when<00:02:30.760> you<00:02:31.060> put<00:02:31.270> a<00:02:31.300> point

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
here that can tell when you put a point

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.260 
here that can tell when you put a point
so<00:02:32.560> does<00:02:32.740> a<00:02:32.800> little<00:02:33.010> Google<00:02:33.430> so<00:02:33.670> it<00:02:33.790> counts<00:02:33.940> the

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
so does a little Google so it counts the

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:37.200 
so does a little Google so it counts the
coins<00:02:34.540> for<00:02:35.050> them<00:02:35.230> as<00:02:35.380> I<00:02:35.530> said<00:02:35.710> in<00:02:35.890> I'd<00:02:36.850> have<00:02:36.910> to

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210 
coins for them as I said in I'd have to

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.230 
coins for them as I said in I'd have to
say<00:02:37.390> it<00:02:37.540> takes<00:02:37.750> a<00:02:37.960> long<00:02:38.170> time<00:02:38.820> till<00:02:39.820> she<00:02:39.970> was<00:02:40.030> 18

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.240 
say it takes a long time till she was 18

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.180 
say it takes a long time till she was 18
months<00:02:40.750> to<00:02:41.110> be<00:02:41.230> able<00:02:41.350> to<00:02:41.500> my<00:02:41.920> older<00:02:42.160> daughter

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
months to be able to my older daughter

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.030 
months to be able to my older daughter
to<00:02:42.880> be<00:02:42.970> able<00:02:43.030> to<00:02:43.180> put<00:02:43.330> them<00:02:43.480> in<00:02:43.720> the<00:02:44.170> top<00:02:44.410> it<00:02:44.890> is

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
to be able to put them in the top it is

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.970 
to be able to put them in the top it is
a<00:02:45.070> bit<00:02:46.140> difficult<00:02:47.140> even<00:02:47.560> though<00:02:47.680> it's<00:02:47.890> a

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
a bit difficult even though it's a

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.160 
a bit difficult even though it's a
reasonable<00:02:48.370> sized<00:02:48.550> hole<00:02:48.820> it<00:02:49.120> takes<00:02:49.900> a<00:02:50.020> little

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
reasonable sized hole it takes a little

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.540 
reasonable sized hole it takes a little
school<00:02:50.470> I<00:02:50.590> guess<00:02:50.740> it<00:02:50.860> depends<00:02:51.100> on<00:02:51.220> the<00:02:51.310> kid

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
school I guess it depends on the kid

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:58.320 
school I guess it depends on the kid
really<00:02:51.970> and<00:02:54.990> there's<00:02:55.990> music<00:02:57.060> there<00:02:58.060> for<00:02:58.240> the
