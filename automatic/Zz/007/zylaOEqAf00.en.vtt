00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
it really quite simply boils down to

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.799 
it really quite simply boils down to
doing<00:00:37.980> some<00:00:38.160> stretching<00:00:38.550> exercises<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:39.570> help

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
Achilles which is it's kind of a long

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.410 
Achilles which is it's kind of a long
story<00:00:43.769> but<00:00:44.250> it<00:00:44.370> takes<00:00:44.519> a<00:00:44.670> lot<00:00:44.850> of<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.030> tension

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
story but it takes a lot of the tension

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.150 
story but it takes a lot of the tension
off<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.570> fascia<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:46.290> then<00:00:46.769> I<00:00:46.800> talked<00:00:47.070> to

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
off the fascia and then I talked to

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.799 
off the fascia and then I talked to
folks<00:00:47.309> about<00:00:47.489> getting<00:00:47.909> it<00:00:48.000> it's<00:00:48.120> some<00:00:48.390> sort<00:00:48.659> of

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
folks about getting it it's some sort of

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.079 
folks about getting it it's some sort of
an<00:00:48.930> arch<00:00:49.080> support<00:00:49.620> some<00:00:50.250> sort<00:00:50.460> of<00:00:50.519> a<00:00:50.640> well-made

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:51.089 
an arch support some sort of a well-made

an arch support some sort of a well-made
over-the-counter<00:00:51.540> supports<00:00:52.350> something<00:00:52.589> that

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:52.830 
over-the-counter supports something that

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:54.289 
over-the-counter supports something that
comes<00:00:53.040> with<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.370> shoe<00:00:53.610> already<00:00:54.000> like<00:00:54.269> a

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:54.299

like<00:00:56.370> that<00:00:56.430> something<00:00:57.360> pretty<00:00:57.690> simple

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:58.080 
like that something pretty simple

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.509 
like that something pretty simple
because<00:00:58.170> if<00:00:58.350> we<00:00:58.440> can<00:00:58.470> hold<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.920> arch<00:00:59.129> still

00:00:59.509 --> 00:00:59.519 
because if we can hold the arch still

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:01.250 
because if we can hold the arch still
and<00:00:59.850> if<00:01:00.330> we<00:01:00.360> can<00:01:00.510> get<00:01:00.570> people<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:00.989> stretch

it with just those two things alone it's

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.300 
it with just those two things alone it's
not<00:01:07.290> really<00:01:07.560> anything<00:01:07.740> that<00:01:07.890> requires

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
not really anything that requires

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.620 
not really anything that requires
surgery<00:01:08.820> it's<00:01:09.540> hardly<00:01:10.140> hardly<00:01:11.510> needing<00:01:12.510> an

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
surgery it's hardly hardly needing an

was<00:01:52.920> you<00:01:53.219> know<00:01:53.310> foot<00:01:53.579> and<00:01:53.700> ankle<00:01:53.789> so<00:01:54.060> it<00:01:54.179> all

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
was you know foot and ankle so it all

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.149 
was you know foot and ankle so it all
fit<00:01:54.479> in<00:01:54.600> rather<00:01:54.749> nicely<00:01:55.079> and<00:01:55.409> that's<00:01:55.560> there

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
fit in rather nicely and that's there

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.709 
fit in rather nicely and that's there
was<00:01:56.280> an<00:01:56.369> interest<00:01:56.700> in<00:01:56.820> it<00:01:56.969> and<00:01:57.240> we<00:01:57.479> had<00:01:57.600> the

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
was an interest in it and we had the

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.480 
was an interest in it and we had the
training<00:01:57.990> for<00:01:58.350> it<00:01:58.469> and<00:01:58.649> there<00:01:58.799> was<00:01:58.950> a<00:01:58.979> need<00:01:59.219> for

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
training for it and there was a need for

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.069 
training for it and there was a need for
it<00:01:59.520> so<00:01:59.729> that's<00:01:59.909> kind<00:02:00.390> of<00:02:00.420> how<00:02:00.569> I<00:02:00.600> felt<00:02:00.899> into

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
it so that's kind of how I felt into

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:08.719 
it so that's kind of how I felt into
that<00:02:01.229> I<00:02:05.810> think<00:02:06.810> what<00:02:06.960> I<00:02:06.990> like<00:02:07.289> what<00:02:08.250> I<00:02:08.280> like<00:02:08.340> the

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
that I think what I like what I like the

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.460 
that I think what I like what I like the
best<00:02:08.759> about<00:02:09.240> it<00:02:09.300> being<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:10.020> foot<00:02:10.229> and<00:02:10.380> ankle

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
best about it being the foot and ankle

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.360 
best about it being the foot and ankle
being<00:02:11.400> a<00:02:11.550> fairly<00:02:12.120> well<00:02:13.050> defined<00:02:13.560> area<00:02:14.069> is<00:02:14.310> that

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
being a fairly well defined area is that

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.330 
being a fairly well defined area is that
more<00:02:15.360> times<00:02:15.690> than<00:02:15.960> not<00:02:16.020> I<00:02:16.500> typically<00:02:17.160> have<00:02:17.310> a

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
more times than not I typically have a

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.250 
more times than not I typically have a
solution<00:02:17.760> for<00:02:17.970> the<00:02:18.240> patients<00:02:18.690> problems<00:02:18.960> when

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
solution for the patients problems when

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.720 
solution for the patients problems when
they<00:02:19.290> come<00:02:19.530> in<00:02:19.740> I<00:02:19.890> mean<00:02:20.100> there's<00:02:20.250> a<00:02:20.340> few<00:02:20.580> things

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
they come in I mean there's a few things

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.700 
they come in I mean there's a few things
that<00:02:20.970> baffle<00:02:21.360> me<00:02:21.390> and<00:02:21.750> there's<00:02:22.319> some<00:02:22.500> things

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
that baffle me and there's some things

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.460 
that baffle me and there's some things
that<00:02:22.800> I<00:02:22.950> just<00:02:23.220> can't<00:02:23.459> fix<00:02:23.959> and<00:02:24.959> this<00:02:25.260> may<00:02:25.409> be

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
that I just can't fix and this may be

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.350 
that I just can't fix and this may be
true<00:02:25.739> for<00:02:25.799> all<00:02:26.099> of<00:02:26.250> orthopedics<00:02:26.879> but<00:02:27.150> and

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
true for all of orthopedics but and

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.880 
true for all of orthopedics but and
that's<00:02:27.569> probably<00:02:27.959> the

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
that's probably the

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.710 
that's probably the
thing<00:02:29.010> to<00:02:29.130> say<00:02:29.280> is<00:02:29.430> it<00:02:29.610> orthopedics<00:02:30.569> is<00:02:30.660> a

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
thing to say is it orthopedics is a

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.140 
thing to say is it orthopedics is a
happy<00:02:31.110> specialty<00:02:31.680> because<00:02:32.069> we<00:02:32.460> can<00:02:32.640> go<00:02:32.760> fix

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
happy specialty because we can go fix

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:40.220 
happy specialty because we can go fix
