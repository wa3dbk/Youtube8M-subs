it the easy way you get too cheap so
here's<00:01:35.420> the<00:01:35.539> second<00:01:35.960> island<00:01:36.259> it's<00:01:36.560> a<00:01:36.799> bigger

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
here's the second island it's a bigger

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.880 
here's the second island it's a bigger
island<00:01:37.460> the<00:01:37.789> first<00:01:38.119> it's<00:01:38.649> got<00:01:39.649> some<00:01:39.799> more

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
island the first it's got some more

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.169 
island the first it's got some more
place<00:01:40.130> to<00:01:40.159> get<00:01:40.429> up<00:01:40.549> so<00:01:40.700> you<00:01:40.759> know<00:01:40.909> it's<00:01:41.030> like

00:01:41.169 --> 00:01:41.179 
place to get up so you know it's like

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:42.999 
place to get up so you know it's like
and<00:01:41.450> the<00:01:41.539> tree<00:01:41.810> is<00:01:41.990> next<00:01:42.259> to<00:01:42.320> the<00:01:42.380> arrow<00:01:42.590> which

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 
and the tree is next to the arrow which

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:46.539 
and the tree is next to the arrow which
is<00:01:43.159> how<00:01:43.789> you<00:01:43.850> know<00:01:44.799> it's<00:01:45.799> the<00:01:46.070> second<00:01:46.429> island

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:46.549 
is how you know it's the second island

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:48.940 
is how you know it's the second island
there's<00:01:47.030> a<00:01:47.149> big<00:01:47.360> tree<00:01:47.539> at<00:01:47.689> the<00:01:47.720> top<00:01:47.990> and<00:01:48.200> it

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
there's a big tree at the top and it

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.480 
there's a big tree at the top and it
points<00:01:49.340> right<00:01:49.549> to<00:01:49.789> the<00:01:51.070> it's<00:01:52.070> got<00:01:52.250> an<00:01:52.340> arrow

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
points right to the it's got an arrow

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.130 
points right to the it's got an arrow
next<00:01:52.700> to<00:01:52.789> a<00:01:52.850> tree<00:01:53.000> so<00:01:53.420> an<00:01:54.880> easier<00:01:55.880> way<00:01:56.119> to<00:01:56.149> find

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
next to a tree so an easier way to find

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.960 
next to a tree so an easier way to find
out<00:01:57.259> where<00:01:57.409> you're<00:01:57.530> going<00:01:57.799> it's<00:01:58.399> have<00:01:58.670> another

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
out where you're going it's have another

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.199 
out where you're going it's have another
person<00:01:59.450> with<00:01:59.659> you<00:01:59.869> so<00:02:00.799> it's<00:02:01.369> standing<00:02:01.789> next<00:02:02.030> to

00:02:02.199 --> 00:02:02.209 
person with you so it's standing next to

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:04.389 
person with you so it's standing next to
the<00:02:02.299> area<00:02:02.630> while<00:02:02.810> you<00:02:03.020> get<00:02:03.110> the<00:02:03.259> boat<00:02:03.440> ready<00:02:03.470> so

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 
the area while you get the boat ready so

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:06.609 
the area while you get the boat ready so
that<00:02:04.610> way<00:02:04.759> the<00:02:04.909> person<00:02:05.360> who's<00:02:05.539> with<00:02:05.750> you<00:02:05.899> can

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619 
that way the person who's with you can
