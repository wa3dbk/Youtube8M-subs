you're<00:01:02.219> on<00:01:02.309> your<00:01:02.460> commute<00:01:02.789> like<00:01:03.629> motion<00:01:03.989> did<00:01:04.140> a

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
you're on your commute like motion did a

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.750 
you're on your commute like motion did a
good<00:01:04.350> job<00:01:04.409> with<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.860> helmet<00:01:05.189> mounts<00:01:05.489> they're

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
good job with the helmet mounts they're

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.630 
good job with the helmet mounts they're
secure<00:01:06.210> easy<00:01:06.720> to<00:01:07.080> install<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:07.740> low-profile
