00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:09.990
 the very dark future that the future world 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:12.750
 good before before diving in 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.299
 the donuts of alcalá without a violin 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.190
 burn fat because I think they have 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.949
 puff pastry that's the feeling that gives me and 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.970
 some icing sugar and maybe cream 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.970
 pastry everything 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:34.160
 my land has given me in the stand of 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:39.320
 taste and others doing that invent the 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:41.750
 choir nuts and balines for pharmacy world 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:45.400
 natural point is purple corn yes very 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:48.760
 diuretic and feminist 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:52.440
 violet is the color of feminism that 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.440
 now be down with the fees 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:02.100
 they are also effective 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:04.730
 well let's go to the clear recipe that comes 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.730
 today as of 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:11.580
 and I was going to say one thing that 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:14.220
 I can say the Mayan beauty 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.100
 in this the Maya is that it brings a necklace 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:20.040
 very pretty very ethnic very totally 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.020
 maya the one to you feels very good what 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.020
 that the queen was like Christ 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.840
 two pistols that has appeared coming 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:31.050
 of guatemala is also good maya 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:34.320
 done there the maya is is half of the 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:36.390
 no more population and also the Mayan language 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.390
 that remains good to finish 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:42.650
 throwing up the mestizos but you'll see 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:48.900
 but good she brings a thing that is 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:51.810
 It is between frida Maya Aztec kahlo 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.490
 oxfam but you have left 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.150
 beautifully gold has been painted the 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.150
 lips of red 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.899
 good and clear donuts of alcalá 

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:04.759
 Alcalá donuts of all life are 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:07.369
 those sweets that many times like that 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:10.580
 we abandoned them I do not know why but I 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:15.410
 I remember I was going to say why because you 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:18.250
 You put it like a seal but we think it's 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:21.760
 x-ray of a whistle 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.980
 good the donuts of alcalá are super 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.590
 easy to do because the only thing 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:30.120
 we need is effectively puff pastry 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:32.410
 puff pastry that sell both frozen and 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.959
 refrigerated in supermarkets 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:38.950
 we have to get four layers 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:41.080
 of puff pastry on top of each other 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.880
 layers we will apply them a little bit with a 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.230
 roll so they stick a little 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.390
 simply so that they stick together 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.070
 we want to stretch the puff pastry and then 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.310
 we will cut the shapes of our 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:54.330
 rosquillas with a cortapastas with a 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.330
 glass what we want 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.390
 I want the moon 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.860
 then we make a hole for him 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.720
 center in the same way you are these 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.270
 threads we will put them in the oven 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:16.480
 preheated to 200 degrees and the 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:18.310
 we will have between 15 and 18 minutes until 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.290
 that they brown this celar with egg ni 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.860
 nothing this will grow 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.829
 and make our donut then by 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.659
 other side let's do the yolk bath 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:32.500
 for the bathroom we take to need 8 

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:36.219
 yolks 250 grams of sugar and 100 grams 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.329
 of water what kind of sugar normal sugar 

00:03:36.219 --> 00:03:39.640
 because what we are going to do is a 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:41.739
 syrup then let's mix the 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.340
 sugar and water in a saucepan and we're going to 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:46.930
 let it melt and make a 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:49.359
 syrup we will have about 10 minutes 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:52.000
 and go see so that it takes a point of 

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:54.700
 strand a little bit strong which is what 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.950
 call if 10 minutes 12 we will have it 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.109
 boiling fire on the other hand we will beat 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:01.780
 the yolks with a rod and little by little 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:04.720
 we will be adding that syrup to the yolks 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:07.030
 without stopping to beat so that the flame does not 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.680
 it settles with excess heat what 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.590
 we will put the fire without stopping 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:14.650
 Beat low fire until it reaches the 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:16.870
 consistency that we want or 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.519
 less to three minutes when the yolk is 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:21.549
 begins to separate well from the fat 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:23.360
 so that it is released so that it becomes yolk 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:25.460
 candied what 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.530
 then in this bud is where are we going to 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.389
 wet our donuts 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.070
 we will wet the donuts so that 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:33.200
 are well impregnated with the entire yolk 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:35.690
 and we will put them to drain on a 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.220
 we will have them drying some three 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.950
 hours until the bathroom is alright 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:42.410
 small and on the other hand we are going to 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:43.460
 Mix 100 grams of water with 100 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:45.200
 grams of icing sugar 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:47.330
 this is the icing that will go by 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.220
 out of the donut then when the 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.320
 donut has already dried well 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:54.020
 we introduce in the glaze the we return 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:56.249
 to take out and let it drain again 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:58.889
 very easy 

00:04:56.249 --> 00:05:01.109
 and this is a vice because when the 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:02.889
 yolk is homemade that is good 

00:05:01.109 --> 00:05:06.159
 really clear 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:08.340
 besides that you do not have the doubt says and this 

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:13.650
 egg donne 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:17.250
 of what century would the neighbor be 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:21.510
 will be and the hen was hen was 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:23.729
 mutant was the rooster of moron that is q 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:29.669
 see if there's something yellow is man 

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:33.690
 it looks like it looks bud but they really are 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:39.630
 those that are naranjitas takes the yolk 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:41.580
 bitter shirt you know they really know 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:43.200
 because today you make yourself an omelette 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:47.610
 French and is like whitish 

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:49.620
 paliducha that's because the one I like 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:55.590
 it has no calories we put a cheese and 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:59.130
 It is so clear that yes the tortilla 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:06:01.310
 onion and ham and cheese the tortilla 

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:01.310
 french 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:07.470
 teruel cortadito ham only seen and 

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:10.289
 seen that it becomes accurate and transparent 

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:13.620
 it's done and it's done but not fat pieces 

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:15.960
 that is an infinite finite error 

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:17.310
 dissolved there come the distemper of the 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:20.540
 tortilla 

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:22.700
 and sir and the taste a question 

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:25.150
 the taste of that yolk is like the 

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:28.730
 yemas de ávila 

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:30.830
 as the yolk candies as it says is like this 

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:33.230
 that is the flavor that with the puff pastry the 

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:34.520
 puff pastry then with the 

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:37.340
 bud 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:40.220
 a perfect sweet very well very well 

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:42.440
 that caloric pump does not affect us because 

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:45.830
 because we exercise we have a 

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:49.610
 healthy life and so on and so we have 

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:52.789
 to the brunette's doctor, what's the matter with me? 

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:53.960
 doctor what's up with the donuts that 

00:06:52.789 --> 00:06:56.289

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:56.289
 federico 

00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:01.879

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:04.180
 balance in drag too if 

00:07:01.879 --> 00:07:06.289
 then we have been fined Jewish 

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:07.789
 drugged you have to do a little bit of 

00:07:06.289 --> 00:07:11.570
 balance of this life at the end 

00:07:07.789 --> 00:07:14.280
 any excess is bad yes 

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:17.699
 friend is nothing else in life more than 

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:20.370
 is to yield more at this point I'm not going either 

00:07:17.699 --> 00:07:22.710
 to change any excess is bad but 

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:25.320
 to get bored there's always time like 

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:27.710
 I said that day I'll rest when I'm 

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:27.710
