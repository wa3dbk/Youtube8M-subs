 in this block we invite you to know 

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:15.089
 the production of the opera 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.570
 this item that has multiple gastronomic applications and good 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.330
 acceptance in the thirty works presented but in our country its 

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:24.199
 production 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:26.659
 practically unknown 

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:30.339
 we saw that the faculty of agricultural sciences specifically in the 

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:32.380
 department of sport and culture 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:37.070
 where the professor romualdo rivers did not give details of the production of 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.070
 this item 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.190
 the vegetable operation little known yet of our country 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.170
 but which is presented as an interesting alternative for 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.840
 producers for their gastronomic applications 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.760
 the immature pods are used for civilized canned soups or as a 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.860
 vegetable that can be consumed the project I forget also the flowers and 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.020

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.960
 I will make this cheese and live in our country 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.440
 it is a vegetable of the family of the mallow be the same as 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:34.840
 cotton amelia however produces some pages complain was 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.810
 inaes the edible part of Bilbao per cent leg 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.810
 that the tc despite being a process 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:44.620
 this 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:50.030
 passed by one for a wild pickle and there different dish is prepared 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:55.830
 that you can find in Korean and Japanese Chinese restaurants 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.100
 nowadays this species 13 in wild form in most countries 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.000
 from warm to temperate to warm weather being widely cultivated in the middle 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.680
 East 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.600
 towards there africa 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.530
 the experimental fields of the horticultural section of the faculty of 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.300
 agricultural sciences testify that it is a plant with perfect adaptation to 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.080
 conditions the apolo kick-ass and climatic of our country a 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.209
 vegetable 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:26.819
 It is very suspicious quesada has been very well to our country i efe harvest 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:30.399
 approximately two months inform continuous 

00:02:30.399 --> 00:02:36.159
 this makes the production large and highlights a very cost of production 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:37.129
 low 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:39.759
 this one can also be 

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:45.159
 an alternative pulpit for the cortijo producers that are found 

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:48.469
 the neighborhoods where they live a lot of Asian 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:51.689
 it's as if the eastern one for example 

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:56.290
 the pod of the uocra should be collected when they are still soft they should be 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.950
 arranged frequently at least every two days using pruning shears 

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:05.070
 to make clean cuts that do not damage the rest of the plant 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.769
 the production phase in the massive 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:13.409
 the seed once the plants have between 4 to 6 take the real one 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:19.019
 goes to the final place that has 140 centimeters between the floor and one meter 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:26.359
 between Rare is such density then would be give 222 thousand plants per 

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:27.569
 hectare 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:30.569
 i this good performance 

00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:35.859
 Your cycle will start soon after the transplant 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:40.889
 a month and a half ago the first fruiting was going on continuously 

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:46.299
 the fortified in two harvesting harvest and flowering permanently 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:51.039
 this makes a long approximate time of two months d harvest 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:54.240
 this type of vine varieties species 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.459
 not so well known 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:04:00.529
 so that it would be profitable, an infusion of which they are known would be lacking 

00:04:00.529 --> 00:04:04.799
 and thanks to you all we are showing this plantation for what 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:05.730
 A) Yes 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:06.710
 the 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:11.480
 producers can approach and receive relevant guidance for 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:12.360
 handling
