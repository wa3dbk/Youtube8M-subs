00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:21.099 
now if they start sitting too much you

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:23.850 
now if they start sitting too much you
can<00:02:21.250> reduce<00:02:21.519> the<00:02:21.730> heat<00:02:21.879> lightning<00:02:22.860> sometimes

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.619 
can reduce the heat lightning sometimes
you<00:02:24.280> find<00:02:24.459> that<00:02:24.640> if<00:02:24.760> you<00:02:24.849> had<00:02:24.970> too<00:02:25.209> many<00:02:25.360> to<00:02:25.599> the

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.960 

once<00:02:34.230> you<00:02:34.350> start<00:02:34.650> seeing<00:02:34.920> that<00:02:35.220> one<00:02:35.580> side<00:02:35.790> has
