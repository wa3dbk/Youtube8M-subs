I'm really enjoying this game I have
been<00:00:50.879> getting<00:00:51.090> quite<00:00:51.239> frustrated<00:00:51.930> but<00:00:52.079> I<00:00:52.289> have

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
been getting quite frustrated but I have

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.200 
been getting quite frustrated but I have
basically<00:00:53.039> come<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.550> conclusion<00:00:53.699> that

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
basically come to the conclusion that

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.569 
basically come to the conclusion that
this<00:00:54.809> game<00:00:55.079> is<00:00:55.110> nothing<00:00:55.680> like<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:55.980> of<00:00:56.070> ecology

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
this game is nothing like the of ecology

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.459 
this game is nothing like the of ecology
with<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:57.000> you<00:00:57.420> can't<00:00:57.660> play<00:00:57.899> this<00:00:58.050> game<00:00:58.230> like

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
with and you can't play this game like

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.260 
with and you can't play this game like
the<00:00:58.590> ecology<00:00:59.129> is<00:00:59.250> at<00:00:59.460> all<00:00:59.760> because<00:00:59.969> it<00:01:00.180> just

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
the ecology is at all because it just

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.880 
the ecology is at all because it just
will<00:01:00.480> not<00:01:00.660> work<00:01:00.840> for<00:01:01.109> you<00:01:01.230> and<00:01:01.440> I've<00:01:01.710> realized

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
will not work for you and I've realized

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.280 
will not work for you and I've realized
that<00:01:02.520> this<00:01:03.239> game<00:01:03.570> is<00:01:03.780> just<00:01:03.809> something

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
that this game is just something

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.500 
that this game is just something
completely<00:01:04.890> fresh<00:01:05.129> in<00:01:05.309> although<00:01:06.119> on<00:01:06.210> all<00:01:06.390> the

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
completely fresh in although on all the

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.179 
completely fresh in although on all the
ecology<00:01:07.080> is<00:01:07.260> I<00:01:07.439> used<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:07.770> get<00:01:07.890> like<00:01:08.040> you<00:01:08.100> know

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
ecology is I used to get like you know

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.120 
ecology is I used to get like you know
two<00:01:08.340> three<00:01:08.909> four<00:01:09.180> key<00:01:09.450> ratios<00:01:09.840> this<00:01:10.680> game<00:01:10.950> I'm

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
two three four key ratios this game I'm

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.620 
two three four key ratios this game I'm
really<00:01:11.700> struggling<00:01:11.939> just<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.299> pull<00:01:12.510> off<00:01:12.600> a

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
really struggling just to pull off a

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.050 
really struggling just to pull off a
two-point<00:01:13.140> que<00:01:13.320> diría<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.670> simple

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
two-point que diría and the simple

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.760 
two-point que diría and the simple
reason<00:01:15.240> it's<00:01:15.509> just<00:01:15.570> buy<00:01:15.960> them<00:01:16.110> completely

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
reason it's just buy them completely

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.830 
reason it's just buy them completely
different<00:01:17.220> by<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.430> looks<00:01:17.670> of<00:01:17.790> it<00:01:17.939> it<00:01:18.360> may<00:01:18.600> be<00:01:18.659> a

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
different by the looks of it it may be a

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.770 
different by the looks of it it may be a
complete<00:01:19.770> engine<00:01:20.189> redesign<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:21.000> by<00:01:21.540> that<00:01:21.720> I

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
complete engine redesign and by that I

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.320 
complete engine redesign and by that I
mean<00:01:21.869> you<00:01:22.200> know<00:01:22.320> you<00:01:22.350> die<00:01:23.009> easier<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:24.000> weapons

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
mean you know you die easier the weapons

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.670 
mean you know you die easier the weapons
have<00:01:24.479> different<00:01:24.840> effects<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.409> different

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
have different effects and different

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.399 
have different effects and different
damages<00:01:26.070> ranges<00:01:26.610> for<00:01:27.060> example<00:01:27.659> I<00:01:27.840> found<00:01:28.259> out

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
damages ranges for example I found out

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:29.990 
damages ranges for example I found out
something<00:01:28.439> today<00:01:28.920> that<00:01:29.040> I<00:01:29.490> didn't<00:01:29.880> really

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
something today that I didn't really

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.450 
something today that I didn't really
expect<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.689> that<00:01:30.780> was<00:01:30.930> when<00:01:31.439> you<00:01:31.530> using<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:31.979> gun

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
expect and that was when you using a gun

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.580 
expect and that was when you using a gun
if<00:01:32.729> you<00:01:32.880> do<00:01:33.000> put<00:01:33.150> a<00:01:33.210> sound<00:01:33.509> when<00:01:33.750> it<00:01:33.810> not<00:01:34.409> only

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
if you do put a sound when it not only

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.010 
if you do put a sound when it not only
decreases<00:01:35.070> arranged<00:01:35.520> it<00:01:36.000> decreases<00:01:36.600> a<00:01:36.630> damage

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
decreases arranged it decreases a damage

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.499 
decreases arranged it decreases a damage
also<00:01:37.259> which<00:01:37.770> is<00:01:38.009> is<00:01:38.430> really<00:01:38.820> good<00:01:39.119> actually<00:01:39.270> I

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
also which is is really good actually I

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:40.850 
also which is is really good actually I
was<00:01:39.869> quite<00:01:40.079> impressed<00:01:40.229> with<00:01:40.590> that<00:01:40.619> because

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
was quite impressed with that because

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.370 
was quite impressed with that because
it's<00:01:41.610> a<00:01:41.820> lot<00:01:41.970> more<00:01:42.119> realistic<00:01:42.479> in<00:01:42.810> a<00:01:42.899> sense<00:01:43.140> of

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
it's a lot more realistic in a sense of

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.050 
it's a lot more realistic in a sense of
killing<00:01:44.159> people<00:01:44.430> across<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.700> map<00:01:44.850> with<00:01:44.970> a

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
killing people across the map with a

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.590 
killing people across the map with a
salad<00:01:45.329> submachine<00:01:45.960> submachine<00:01:46.590> gun<00:01:46.829> would<00:01:47.600> we

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
salad submachine submachine gun would we

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.020 
salad submachine submachine gun would we
just<00:01:48.840> not<00:01:48.990> happen<00:01:49.380> it's<00:01:49.560> you<00:01:50.549> know<00:01:50.670> it's<00:01:50.700> quite

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
just not happen it's you know it's quite

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.149 
just not happen it's you know it's quite
unrealistic<00:01:51.509> but<00:01:52.259> now<00:01:52.590> I've<00:01:52.710> got<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:52.979> other

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
unrealistic but now I've got the other

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.679 
unrealistic but now I've got the other
worse<00:01:53.310> when<00:01:53.490> I<00:01:53.520> talk<00:01:53.729> a<00:01:53.759> lot<00:01:53.850> about<00:01:54.000> this<00:01:54.450> gun

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
worse when I talk a lot about this gun

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.459 
worse when I talk a lot about this gun
and<00:01:54.899> you<00:01:55.380> unlock<00:01:55.649> this<00:01:55.680> gun<00:01:56.040> at<00:01:56.250> level<00:01:57.110> 46<00:01:58.110> and

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
and you unlock this gun at level 46 and

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.249 
and you unlock this gun at level 46 and
I<00:01:59.280> think<00:01:59.369> level<00:01:59.759> 56<00:02:00.180> you<00:02:00.329> also<00:02:00.750> unlock<00:02:00.930> the

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
I think level 56 you also unlock the

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.039 
I think level 56 you also unlock the
Scorpion<00:02:02.100> and<00:02:02.280> these<00:02:03.270> two<00:02:03.540> guns<00:02:03.810> are
