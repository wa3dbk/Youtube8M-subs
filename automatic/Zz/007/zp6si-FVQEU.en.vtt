that I got this although the radio is

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.350 
that I got this although the radio is
Android<00:03:32.260> compatible<00:03:32.920> when<00:03:33.819> it<00:03:33.970> comes<00:03:34.180> to

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 
Android compatible when it comes to

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
it seems that it won't only work with

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:46.110 
it seems that it won't only work with
the<00:03:39.700> rifle<00:03:41.730> okay<00:03:42.730> but<00:03:44.220> here<00:03:45.220> you<00:03:45.489> also<00:03:45.700> have

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
different settings so you can set the

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.990 
different settings so you can set the
