00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.390
 she went on sale 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.480
 a sick fantasy of marketers foreshadowed 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.489
 that will sell up to 75,000 Aztecs in 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.680
 year but in the first year reality 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.140
 hurt smack their heads managed 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.780
 realize only 27 thousand copies and 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.869
 Further sales only fell so that already in

 July 2005 Aztec was discontinued 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.979
 in Russia, he became known after 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.960
 the release of the series in all grave where myself 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.960
 heisenberg went on such 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.020
 sbarro out a bow car unique 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.630
 was prepared specifically for 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.520
 2010 Geneva Motor Show and 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.620
 was a hodgepodge of 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.960
 seventies sport car concepts 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:34.840
 eighties and hot wheels 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:37.090
 in general, so disfigure a sports car you need 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.860
 was to try though we have a stock 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.860
 even more ugly specimens 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.880
 when you hear aston martin in your head 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:49.000
 these gorgeous sports cars pop up 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:51.580
 vantage rapid vanquish is generally beautiful 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.119
 and terribly expensive cars but it turns out that 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:57.729
 in 1979 this company almost let it go 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:58.690
 in the series one of the poorest sports cars 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:01.479
 in the history 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.520
 the bulldog created him as a competitor 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:06.160
 unforgettable lamborghini countach 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.560
 even put the engine there 5 liter v8 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.570
 issuing up to 700 horses 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.370
 and in tandem with five-speed mechanics 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:15.340
 allowed to shoot this monster 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:18.820
 up to a hundred in 5 one-tenth of a second at 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.920
 maximum speed in a breathtaking 381 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.570
 kilometer here only with appearance 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.880
 overdone and actually turned out 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:27.340
 tin can which customers 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.470
 companies did not want to buy at all 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.080
 Out of a planned series of 25 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.880
 instances only one was created which 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:41.080
 subsequently sold to a private collection 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:43.420
 for 130 thousand pounds but different freaks 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.970
 time did other grandees for example 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.940
 volkswagen in 1977 showed 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:51.250
 conceptual stake did not represent 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.380
 is just a colander on wheels 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.239
 and on the exterior of fantasy designers 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.640
 not over take a look at this 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:01.650
 gorgeous steering good for brains not 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.650
 let the car in the series was not enough 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.810
 Renault led satis became one of the brightest 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.129
 the misunderstandings of modern french 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:13.280
 automotive journalists called 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:16.340
 this business hatchback business even your 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.019
 mother is the ugliest car with 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.940
 pretentious french style then 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:22.040
 not ugly enough to be 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:24.590
 interesting as a result on the conveyor it 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:27.170
 misunderstanding just existed since 2002 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.030
 till 2009 and during this time it was 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:33.400
 built 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:33.400
 62 thousand copies of horror and only 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:40.730
 despite the fact that in viber faster van 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.500
 is today one of 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.170
 technically advanced 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:47.269
 hypercarry is able to accelerate from standstill 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.940
 up to 200 kilometers per hour for six and six 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:52.010
 tenths of a second and conquer the mark of 300 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:54.859
 kilometers per hour after another 10 seconds 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.780
 at maximum speed in the region of 400 kilometers 

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:59.569
 hour nevertheless have this car 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.879
 lack namely his appearance 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:02.359
 this device cannot be beautiful 

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:04.310
 to name 

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:06.620
 moreover which side does not look 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.970
 frank freak and his creator can 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.340
 only advise to find at least 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:13.180
 novice designer to draw 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.180
 beautiful silhouette 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:18.979
 modern car vision 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.109
 Koreans are often average 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:23.240
 European seems very strange 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:26.060
 so the guys from san yong are obviously something 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.919
 overdone creating radius feeling that 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.470
 first they created some bloated 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:32.720
 liftback then thought it was nice 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:34.910
 would make the trunk bigger and right 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.620
 steal on detuning the top in the end 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:38.479
 the car looks like an artisanal 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:41.419
 handicraft with disproportionately small 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:43.310
 wheels and a terrible body by the way the second 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:47.889
 The generation of this masterpiece is now being sold. 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:47.889
 in Russia and positioned as a crossover 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:55.520
 in principle, it was possible the whole of today 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:58.559
 issue dedicate to the Chinese auto industry 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:01.529
 freaks there the sea is bottled but today 

00:04:58.559 --> 00:05:03.449
 confine ourselves to this one chery qq6 

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:05.339
 designer geniuses who created this 

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:07.830
 car managed to attach to dow 

00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:09.839
 matiz trunk followed by car and 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:15.539
 swelled like a frog using a straw in 

00:05:09.839 --> 00:05:17.999
 anus and voila indian 

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:20.460
 auto industry however does not lag behind the Chinese 

00:05:17.999 --> 00:05:23.339
 I think everyone heard about the cheapest in the world 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:25.650
 cars tata nano its price is 

00:05:23.339 --> 00:05:28.050
 only 100 thousand Indian rupees or 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:29.580
 about two and a half thousand dollars 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.860
 Apparently the creators of this masterpiece 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:34.409
 inspired by the concept of tight 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:36.270
 car of the eye and thought that bought 

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:38.550
 must be aware all the time 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:40.289
 the insignificance of their being in general because 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:42.899
 that or the fact that the car was 

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:44.999
 too poor even by the standards of india but 

00:05:42.899 --> 00:05:46.740
 interest in the car has cooled down already 

00:05:44.999 --> 00:05:48.810
 year after the start of sales 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:51.569
 And on this I have all put huskies 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:53.909
 subscribe and write in the comments 

00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:56.639
 what cars do you think are ugly 

00:05:53.909 --> 00:06:00.169
 and perhaps we will create on the basis of your 

00:05:56.639 --> 00:06:00.169
 reviews another top
