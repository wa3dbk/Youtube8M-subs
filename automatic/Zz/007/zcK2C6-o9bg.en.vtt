changing that is such as charcoal we're
gonna<00:02:11.020> try<00:02:11.410> or<00:02:12.220> your<00:02:12.430> steel<00:02:18.239> little<00:02:19.239> darker

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
gonna try or your steel little darker

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:20.970 
gonna try or your steel little darker
doesn't<00:02:19.959> change<00:02:20.260> a<00:02:20.470> whole<00:02:20.650> lot

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
doesn't change a whole lot

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.300 
doesn't change a whole lot
and<00:02:21.250> then<00:02:22.290> let's<00:02:23.290> even<00:02:23.500> try<00:02:23.739> this<00:02:23.800> blue<00:02:24.190> right

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
and then let's even try this blue right

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:31.590 
and then let's even try this blue right
here<00:02:24.370> so<00:02:24.580> you<00:02:24.640> like<00:02:24.850> that<00:02:28.110> no<00:02:29.110> I<00:02:30.420> messed<00:02:31.420> up

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
here so you like that no I messed up

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.910 
here so you like that no I messed up
there<00:02:31.870> I<00:02:33.090> couldn't<00:02:34.090> change<00:02:34.390> that<00:02:34.600> back<00:02:34.920> you

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
there I couldn't change that back you

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.800 
there I couldn't change that back you
don't<00:02:36.070> have<00:02:36.160> to<00:02:36.220> do<00:02:36.340> all<00:02:36.489> the<00:02:36.580> same<00:02:36.850> but<00:02:37.750> I

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
don't have to do all the same but I

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.330 
don't have to do all the same but I
kinda<00:02:38.020> like<00:02:38.050> to<00:02:38.140> do<00:02:38.290> the<00:02:38.410> same<00:02:38.650> now<00:02:39.100> see<00:02:39.310> I

not<00:02:42.100> big<00:02:42.190> on<00:02:42.280> that<00:02:42.340> blue<00:02:42.610> so<00:02:43.540> let's<00:02:43.690> try<00:02:43.989> this

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
not big on that blue so let's try this

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:54.910 
not big on that blue so let's try this
one<00:02:45.250> right<00:02:45.280> here

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.119 

alright<00:02:55.920> that<00:02:56.430> looks<00:02:56.459> a<00:02:56.700> lot<00:02:56.790> better<00:02:57.110> so

00:02:58.119 --> 00:02:58.129 
alright that looks a lot better so

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:01.339 
alright that looks a lot better so
here's<00:02:59.129> my<00:02:59.340> tip<00:02:59.400> so<00:02:59.790> first<00:03:00.060> off<00:03:00.300> if<00:03:00.599> you<00:03:01.170> don't

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 
here's my tip so first off if you don't

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:05.660 
here's my tip so first off if you don't
know<00:03:01.620> what<00:03:02.160> you<00:03:02.280> like<00:03:02.780> randomize<00:03:04.550> once<00:03:05.550> you

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
know what you like randomize once you

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.490 
know what you like randomize once you
get<00:03:05.819> it<00:03:05.910> randomized<00:03:06.450> and<00:03:06.720> you<00:03:07.110> really<00:03:07.410> like

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
get it randomized and you really like

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.080 
get it randomized and you really like
this<00:03:07.650> color<00:03:07.920> but<00:03:08.129> maybe<00:03:08.430> you<00:03:08.580> want<00:03:08.760> to<00:03:08.849> screw

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
this color but maybe you want to screw

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.089 
this color but maybe you want to screw
around<00:03:09.150> with<00:03:09.330> a<00:03:09.420> little<00:03:09.690> bit<00:03:09.890> go<00:03:10.890> ahead<00:03:10.920> and

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:11.099 
around with a little bit go ahead and

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:12.740 
around with a little bit go ahead and
save<00:03:11.250> the<00:03:11.400> colors<00:03:11.700> so<00:03:11.910> we<00:03:12.000> got<00:03:12.120> charcoal<00:03:12.510> ash

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
save the colors so we got charcoal ash

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.750 
save the colors so we got charcoal ash
black<00:03:13.050> here<00:03:13.500> your<00:03:14.459> ash<00:03:14.670> black<00:03:15.000> and<00:03:15.390> then<00:03:16.760> it's

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
black here your ash black and then it's

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.160 
black here your ash black and then it's
arcane<00:03:18.239> blue<00:03:18.569> for<00:03:18.870> the<00:03:18.930> middle<00:03:19.200> and<00:03:19.790> then

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
arcane blue for the middle and then

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.440 
arcane blue for the middle and then
where<00:03:22.170> your<00:03:22.290> steel

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
where your steel

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.860 
where your steel
alright<00:03:24.500> so<00:03:25.500> now<00:03:25.700> anytime<00:03:26.700> you<00:03:27.390> want<00:03:27.720> to<00:03:27.750> come

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
under your save sets and I don't use

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.229 
under your save sets and I don't use
this<00:03:34.049> but<00:03:34.290> if<00:03:34.470> you<00:03:34.530> want<00:03:34.680> to<00:03:34.739> die<00:03:34.920> all<00:03:35.220> you<00:03:35.970> can

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
this but if you want to die all you can

you<00:03:37.049> know<00:03:37.110> let's<00:03:37.260> save<00:03:37.620> these<00:03:37.799> changes

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
you know let's save these changes

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.770 
you know let's save these changes
yeah<00:03:40.230> let's<00:03:40.410> accept<00:03:40.739> all<00:03:41.489> right<00:03:41.610> now<00:03:42.420> my<00:03:42.599> guys
