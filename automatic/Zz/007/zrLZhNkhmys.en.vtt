00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.390
 all right 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:18.310
 the maintenance of a pool 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:20.800
 by common sense we should start it 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.900
 at the moment we are filling 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:27.070
 for the first time the pool is to say 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:30.310
 when we incorporate the first water that 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:33.460
 water that comes without chlorination or that comes 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:35.530
 with coloring exclusively for the 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.010
 potability from the point of view of 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.840
 consumption that is totally insufficient 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.480
 for the treatment of the pool 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:46.839
 then that first water that we filled 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.760
 the pool that clean new water we have 

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:50.409
 than give it a first treatment that 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.610
 we call shock treatment or 

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:56.490
 super chlorination treatment 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:02.090
 this treatment is done with chlorine 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:04.850
 fast and the proportion that we have what 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:07.520
 and incorporate that water is approximately 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:10.250
 between 4 and 5 times higher than the one 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:13.370
 then we have to apply as a dose of 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:15.680
 maintenance with which when 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:18.590
 we fill a new water in a pool 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:21.670
 we have to do a treatment that is 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:26.060
 shock treatment and we have to 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:30.130
 super chlorinate that water initially to 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:33.280
 that we use a chlorine 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:36.280
 of rapid dissolution release that 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.890
 it is quickly diluted in water and that 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.920
 quickly take it from there 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:45.159
 it would be necessary to make a first revision of 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:48.130
 what is the debugger team that is 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:51.130
 ok the filter other than normally 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.590
 It is usually flint sand that when 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.600
 that water driven by the pump that 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.280
 we have in the purifier goes through that 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.159
 sand filter let's say that those 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.929
 impurities would remain in that arena to 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:04.569
 from there on from that first review 

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:08.769
 of the debugger team we should already 

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:10.920
 enter into the water analysis that 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:12.930
 we just arrived 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.080
 the water that we incorporate into a pool 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.150
 It can be of different origin can be 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.300
 of water from the network can be from a well 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.880
 of sounding can be a well of a well 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.160
 artesian and we should know what kind of 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.170
 water is where we have incorporated by 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.890
 what because there are parameters that we have 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.840
 to take into account when knowing 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.150
 what products or what proportion of 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:41.069
 products we have to cast then 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:44.250
 for that there is a one analysis kit and there 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:47.970
 that analyze that water you have to analyze 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:50.400
 the degree of ph and then the level of 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:53.790
 chlorine that we must incorporate to not 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:56.760
 happen to us and also produce stinging 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.210
 itching in the eye or not falling short and 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:02.010
 do not 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:04.840
 to do a water disinfection 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.010
 appropriate we should not forget that water 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.880
 of our pool has to be 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:11.890
 always there in that strip in the case of 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.310
 chlorine every time we do an analysis 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:19.330
 of our water has to give us between 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:23.140
 1 and 1 and a half of proportion and in the case 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:25.630
 of the ph the ours our test tube 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.850
 analysis has to give us between 72 and 76 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:30.950
 the maintenance of a pool is 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:33.020
 basically reduces 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.489
 and maintain those two parameters that we have 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:37.310
 said previously keep in the 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:38.600
 parameters of chlorine levels the ph and 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.090
 then 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:43.740
 cleaning the pool cup the 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:46.620
 cleaning the pool cup 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:48.840
 we can make it based on the 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.120
 pool location there are pools that 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:55.020
 they will be more prone to getting dirty 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:57.300
 There are swimming pools that make a sweep 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:59.400
 washed a background sweep once a 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:01.220
 week would be enough and yet 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.860
 there are swimming pools that are in an enclave 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:07.680
 where much more dirt will be generated 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:11.310
 cleaned every two or three days there will be 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:13.320
 to sweep the bottom or pass the clean to 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.900
 background as we call it the 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:19.290
 clean funds are traditionally 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:21.810
 manual ie manual is a pole 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:24.780
 and a fund that is directly connected 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:27.630
 to the treatment plant and the wastewater treatment plant 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:30.240
 a suction force so that we 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:32.110
 let's understand, it can be as close to 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:35.880
 a vacuum cleaner 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:39.610
 and then there would be another robotic system 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:42.690
 that would already be automatic and that 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:45.550
 lately they are very fashionable ie 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:49.180
 formerly the stamp to sweep the 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:51.940
 background was usual years ago and today 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:54.840
 there is a generation of clean thefts 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:58.630
 automatic fund with benefits 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:00.820
 great and that people already have a 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:03.930
 automatic pool cleaner that does that 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.930
 so ungrateful task 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:17.770
 yes
