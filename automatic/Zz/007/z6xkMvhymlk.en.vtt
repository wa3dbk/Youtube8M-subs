00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.660
I close my eyes and face forward. 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.430
My heart races beyond my control. 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.310
"Let go of my hand", came from my tearful voice; 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.590
Even though tears have vanished from my heart.

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:08.210
Even now, the sounds of the Earth and the sounds of the Moon have yet to meet.

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:20.390
The red eyes you so loved still fill with madness, cursed with solitude.

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:26.050
If I could but leave behind my memories, if I could leap to the far side of the moon;

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:31.130
Breaking my instincts, I shortened the distance between us.

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.530
Even though it's this painful, the less my tears the more its hurts. 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.210
I can't turn away

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.190
 I am entranced by the moon.

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.610
Moon light loves for me

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.710
Moon light hate for you

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.960
Your vanishing form is still clear in my mind 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:13.230
From when we said our goodbyes.

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:23.060
The red eyes you left behind were just, very briefly, wettened by tears.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:34.990
The rule decided by the Moon, that we cannot meet, manipulates our fates.

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.490
If I could but leave behind my memories, if I could leap to the far side of the moon;

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.760
I would cast aside fate, grab you and take you away

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:51.230
Even though it's this painful, the less my tears the more its hurts. 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:56.720
I turn away, embrace myself, and call your name.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:39.260
If I could but leave behind my memories, if I could leap to the far side of the moon;

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:44.420
Breaking my instincts, I shortened the distance between us.

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:49.760
Even though it's this painful, the less my tears the more its hurts. 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.370
I can't turn away

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.170
 I am entranced by the moon.

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:00.270
Moon light loves for me

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.280
Moon light hate for you

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.930
Moon light loves for me

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.700
Moon light hate for you
