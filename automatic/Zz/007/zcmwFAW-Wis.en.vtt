to ride bikes now the researchers also

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.580 
to ride bikes now the researchers also
saw<00:01:35.820> an<00:01:36.060> eleven<00:01:36.450> percent<00:01:36.720> increase<00:01:37.560> in

this<00:01:40.710> would<00:01:40.950> support<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.579> idea<00:01:41.909> that<00:01:42.000> some

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
this would support the idea that some

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.420 
this would support the idea that some
