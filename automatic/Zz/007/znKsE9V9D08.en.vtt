headsets<00:00:52.530> that<00:00:52.680> actually<00:00:53.160> fucking<00:00:53.399> works<00:00:53.730> the

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
headsets that actually fucking works the

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.910 
headsets that actually fucking works the
big<00:00:54.449> problem<00:00:54.629> with<00:00:54.930> virtual<00:00:55.230> reality<00:00:55.620> in<00:00:55.860> the

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
big problem with virtual reality in the

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.670 
big problem with virtual reality in the
past<00:00:56.340> has<00:00:56.699> been<00:00:56.730> that<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.329> latency<00:00:58.170> is<00:00:58.440> a<00:00:58.530> big

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
past has been that a latency is a big

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.040 
past has been that a latency is a big
issue<00:00:58.859> so<00:00:59.280> when<00:00:59.940> you<00:01:00.090> turn<00:01:00.359> your<00:01:00.600> head<00:01:00.809> the

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
issue so when you turn your head the

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.429 
issue so when you turn your head the
world<00:01:01.260> turns<00:01:01.680> too<00:01:02.359> slowly<00:01:03.359> it<00:01:03.780> doesn't<00:01:04.170> react

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
world turns too slowly it doesn't react

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.200 
world turns too slowly it doesn't react
to<00:01:04.680> you<00:01:04.799> in<00:01:04.920> time<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.339> it<00:01:05.430> gets<00:01:05.549> you<00:01:05.850> know

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
to you in time and it gets you know

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.570 
to you in time and it gets you know
motion<00:01:06.720> sickness<00:01:06.990> immediately<00:01:07.920> your<00:01:08.460> eyes

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
motion sickness immediately your eyes

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:09.500 
motion sickness immediately your eyes
are<00:01:08.700> saying<00:01:08.850> you're<00:01:08.939> not<00:01:09.060> moving<00:01:09.330> your<00:01:09.450> head

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
are saying you're not moving your head

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.770 
are saying you're not moving your head
is<00:01:09.659> telling<00:01:09.810> you<00:01:10.080> are<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.729> then<00:01:11.729> your<00:01:11.939> stomach

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
is telling you are and then your stomach

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.980 
is telling you are and then your stomach
comes<00:01:13.229> out<00:01:13.350> of<00:01:13.470> your<00:01:13.530> mouth<00:01:13.590> and<00:01:13.950> B<00:01:14.909> field<00:01:15.780> of

comes out of your mouth and B field of
view<00:01:16.110> was<00:01:16.590> a<00:01:16.619> big<00:01:16.830> problem<00:01:17.189> early<00:01:18.060> virtual

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
view was a big problem early virtual

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.240 
view was a big problem early virtual
reality<00:01:18.630> headsets<00:01:19.020> couldn't<00:01:19.409> simulate<00:01:19.860> the

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
your peripheral vision it was always a

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.929 
your peripheral vision it was always a
small<00:01:22.650> screen<00:01:23.100> in<00:01:23.130> front<00:01:23.340> of<00:01:23.490> you<00:01:23.580> it<00:01:23.820> always

small screen in front of you it always

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:24.679 
small screen in front of you it always
felt<00:01:24.150> like<00:01:24.299> you're<00:01:24.450> looking<00:01:24.540> through

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
felt like you're looking through

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.050 
felt like you're looking through
binoculars<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:25.860> it<00:01:26.189> never<00:01:26.369> really<00:01:26.580> felt

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
binoculars and it never really felt

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.319 
binoculars and it never really felt
immersive<00:01:28.009> but<00:01:29.009> since<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.670> last<00:01:29.820> time<00:01:30.030> anyone

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
immersive but since the last time anyone

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.990 
immersive but since the last time anyone
has<00:01:30.570> tried<00:01:30.689> virtual<00:01:31.200> reality<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:32.460> technology

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
has tried virtual reality the technology

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.880 
has tried virtual reality the technology
has<00:01:33.030> come<00:01:33.479> along<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.320> point<00:01:34.560> where<00:01:34.710> both

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
has come along to the point where both

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.770 
has come along to the point where both
of<00:01:34.920> those<00:01:35.130> are<00:01:35.340> actually<00:01:35.880> solvable<00:01:36.299> problems

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
of those are actually solvable problems

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.219 
of those are actually solvable problems
and<00:01:37.020> now<00:01:37.530> we<00:01:37.590> have<00:01:37.829> a<00:01:38.040> viable<00:01:38.750> virtual<00:01:39.750> reality

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
and now we have a viable virtual reality

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.050 
and now we have a viable virtual reality
solution<00:01:40.770> that<00:01:40.950> is<00:01:41.070> consumer<00:01:41.850> level

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
solution that is consumer level

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.940 
solution that is consumer level

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
dodging randomly like you would in

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.010

up<00:04:08.450> straight<00:04:08.990> above<00:04:09.200> you<00:04:09.410> and<00:04:09.440> behind<00:04:09.680> you<00:04:10.010> and

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360 
up straight above you and behind you and

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.850 
up straight above you and behind you and
look<00:04:11.360> and<00:04:11.570> see<00:04:11.660> where<00:04:12.320> the<00:04:12.530> missiles<00:04:12.830> are

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:12.860 
look and see where the missiles are

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.020 
look and see where the missiles are
coming<00:04:13.010> from<00:04:13.280> so<00:04:13.460> you<00:04:13.490> know<00:04:13.670> which<00:04:13.820> way<00:04:13.970> to

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 
coming from so you know which way to

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:16.150 
coming from so you know which way to
dodge<00:04:14.300> because<00:04:14.840> you<00:04:15.470> have<00:04:15.500> a<00:04:15.650> booster<00:04:16.130> that

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 
dodge because you have a booster that

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.680 
dodge because you have a booster that
you<00:04:16.430> can<00:04:16.609> outrun<00:04:16.970> the<00:04:17.120> Misses<00:04:17.359> for<00:04:17.390> five

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
you can outrun the Misses for five

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:18.880 
you can outrun the Misses for five
seconds<00:04:18.169> and<00:04:18.260> then<00:04:18.350> you<00:04:18.470> have<00:04:18.620> a<00:04:18.650> tighter

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:18.890 
seconds and then you have a tighter

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:20.500 
seconds and then you have a tighter
turning<00:04:19.190> radius<00:04:19.280> so<00:04:19.790> if<00:04:20.000> you<00:04:20.090> go<00:04:20.239> the<00:04:20.390> right

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.510 
turning radius so if you go the right

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:21.060 
turning radius so if you go the right
way

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
way

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.390 
way
