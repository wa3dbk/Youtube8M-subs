00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
disaster as soon as the movie started we

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.340

Kong<00:01:30.390> Phooey<00:01:30.659> looks<00:01:31.140> like<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:31.740> stuffed<00:01:32.159> animal

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
Kong Phooey looks like a stuffed animal

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.560 
Kong Phooey looks like a stuffed animal
and<00:01:33.030> his<00:01:33.630> in<00:01:33.869> CGI<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:34.829> spot<00:01:35.579> is<00:01:35.759> played<00:01:36.060> by<00:01:36.299> a

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
and his in CGI and spot is played by a

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.060 
and his in CGI and spot is played by a
real<00:01:37.110> cat<00:01:38.299> granted<00:01:39.299> they<00:01:39.450> use<00:01:39.659> CGI<00:01:40.229> on<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.829> cat

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
real cat granted they use CGI on the cat

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.270 
real cat granted they use CGI on the cat
for<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.759> mass<00:01:42.000> movement<00:01:42.689> and<00:01:42.930> for<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.799> facial

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
for the mass movement and for the facial

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.789 
for the mass movement and for the facial
reactions<00:01:44.970> but<00:01:45.329> it's<00:01:45.930> played<00:01:46.530> by<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:47.070> real<00:01:47.520> cat

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799 
reactions but it's played by a real cat

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:53.389 
reactions but it's played by a real cat
so<00:01:49.799> this<00:01:50.700> makes<00:01:51.030> no<00:01:51.509> sense<00:01:51.869> why<00:01:52.439> is<00:01:52.770> one<00:01:53.130> animal

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
so this makes no sense why is one animal

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.420 
so this makes no sense why is one animal
in<00:01:53.909> CGI<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.110> other<00:01:55.350> one<00:01:55.649> is<00:01:55.860> played<00:01:56.159> by<00:01:56.399> a

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
in CGI and the other one is played by a

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.969 
in CGI and the other one is played by a
real<00:01:56.700> animal<00:01:57.590> and<00:01:59.329> also<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.689> CGI<00:02:01.229> animal

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
real animal and also the CGI animal

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.569 
real animal and also the CGI animal
looks<00:02:02.340> really<00:02:02.939> ridiculous<00:02:04.159> compared<00:02:05.159> when

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
looks really ridiculous compared when

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.290 
looks really ridiculous compared when
it's<00:02:05.759> next<00:02:06.329> to<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.659> real<00:02:06.869> animal<00:02:07.469> by<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:07.740> way

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
it's next to the real animal by the way

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.420 
it's next to the real animal by the way

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
work hard when they came up with this

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.730
