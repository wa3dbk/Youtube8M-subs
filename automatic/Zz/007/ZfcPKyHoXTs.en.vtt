00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:05.940
 hi there, this is the day's distribution 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.910
 pokerstarter themselves Sergei Nikitin 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.740
 today our distribution will take place in 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.070
 tournament format a6 max barina 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.130
 22 dollars on to our hero distributed 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.100
 on the button of the king lady 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:23.900
 unsuited look to happen 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:26.670
 it opens from the button everything is fine 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:29.880
 get the big blind decks 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.820
 knock out defends we flop 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.390
 on the flop we see that we hit 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.730
 top couple 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.829
 and naturally after our check 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.500
 opponent we need to began to pick up 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:45.420
 best hands here do standard can 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:47.809
 get our hero does the same gets 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.809
 call from opponent 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:55.800
 the river repeats the jack our opponent 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.630
 checks again and we need here in my 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.810
 opinion to put the second barrel as 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:03.420
 Jack did not change the board structure 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:06.120
 we can still get from different 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.940
 draw from a variety of the best ladies so 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:12.690
 must put the turn 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:16.160
 continue to put and get 2 stabs 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:19.650
 turn on the turn to the river 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:22.259
 so on the river everything quickly happened on 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.590
 the river dropped google eight which 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:29.190
 closed backdoor flash and closed street 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:34.320
 nine and ten and our opponent here 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:35.100
 decides long and now we need to evaluate 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.860
 and spectrum 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:42.270
 Our opponent 's handouts 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:46.110
 Opponent described as 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:48.020
 unknown player and against standard 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.000
 blames an unknown player on the river 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.820
 will tell us either about nations which 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.750
 they themselves are afraid that we will drop back and 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:01.140
 thereby not getting us either a bluff 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:05.340
 henna missed drone bass nadra trying 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:07.470
 just squeeze us out of the bank and never 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.149
 my opinion we will not see there 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.310
 worst of the ladies because the worst yes we are 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:17.349
 still go in case 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:20.290
 and will strive cheaper to find 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:22.230
 but come out on showdown having a medium hand 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:26.080
 showdown valyu on such a board 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:28.540
 now we estimate how much can be here 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.420
 hands that beats us and how many in fact 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.670
 missed their firewood bike 3 count and 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.130
 flop and there are a lot of broadways in which 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:39.040
 a jack which could well be so 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:44.140
 play also on the river closed like me 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:45.990
 already said street hands 10 9 here you from 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.390
 flush draw here 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:51.350
 in my opinion in my opinion there will be little 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:54.500
 because small suited aces 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:58.680
 opponent preflop scribble drove 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:00.860
 either because it's a great hand to 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.960
 protect her with bluff guys 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:06.350
 large aces naturally he drove in 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:07.760
 3 bobkov 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.319
 also 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.110
 suited connectors got on 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:14.510
 river eight which gave him 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:16.849
 showdown value and that is 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:20.380
 many such connectors would likely 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:22.900
 our our 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:25.870
 no I wouldn't bluff 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:29.310
 Here is such a weak but Sheldon species so 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:32.080
 what do I think will need to fold here 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:34.780
 our hero against the unknown 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:37.150
 opponent and if our opponents neck 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:40.630
 the shaft is a great shine of his hand 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:44.260
 It turned out our hero still arrives 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:46.720
 great and that's despite the fact that we 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.940
 lost that deal but thought played 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.430
 we are here optimally but if 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.350
 Opponent case of 10 third time then us 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:56.590
 it would be necessary here to put 3 barrels 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:59.470
 run as in such a case on the spectrum 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:01.810
 opponent would leave many ladies weaker with 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:08.160
 which one could still collect here 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:10.570
 such distribution here makes us 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:13.780
 once again thought aspects 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:17.070
 opponent by his line and taking 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:21.850
 difficult decisions on the river 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:25.090
 shows what needs to be analyzed 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:29.140
 consider all the actions of our opponent 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:31.330
 on all the streets of commerce that's all everything 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:33.540
 thank you for the attention of luck in poker and in 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.540
 a life
