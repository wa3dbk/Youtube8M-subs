00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:05.510
 personal experience rubric 

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:07.520
 order up the restaurant video 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.340
 deliciously painted ingredients dishes we 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:12.329
 they didn't get what they wanted 

00:00:12.329 --> 00:00:15.189
 will you go again to this place 

00:00:15.189 --> 00:00:17.130
 often do you encounter so 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.669
 what expected more 

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:20.449
 so why put a similar situation 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:23.529
 your customers sometimes chasing the order 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:26.560
 novice photographers take what they 

00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:27.680
 not under force 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.190
 I also got rid of these errors 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:32.829
 please don't make them anymore 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:35.690
 if you are not confident in your abilities better 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:36.620
 give up 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.110
 or transfer orders more experienced 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.890
 Colleagues 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.210
 for example, and I will not take a subject 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.469
 since i'm generally full zero and awards 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:48.039
 I'd rather give the order to Dmitry Zuev 

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:50.750
 as pillars and specializes 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.270
 coming back past topic and trainers 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.330
 I just say that in the studio except 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.059
 there is nothing more paper 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:00.589
 and it will be harder for you to pose 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:02.850
 first time came to the photo shoot 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.990
 some of my clients after chic 

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:07.580
 photo shoots in the summer in the park asked 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.100
 take pictures of the baptism of the child i 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.020
 took but immediately said that in 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.890
 temple basement 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.290
 do not use the flash by making a walk 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.040
 beating two light sources today 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.300
 light bulbs will not give even close so bright 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.079
 and cool result 

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:27.700
 if i can do that i can be faithful 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:28.760
 conditions 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.960
 customers should know what he gets in the end 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.520
 after all, it included a reputation 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.680
 and try to promise less and do and 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:38.479
 more 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:40.790
 Of course, if the customer obama roads 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.010
 I have always sealed and processed 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.850
 more photos than spelled out in services 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.320
 and it all goes on and not 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.190
 one hour 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.060
 note the hour fifteen part 10 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.840
 and photographed filmed exactly 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.310
 shutter clicks as much as possible to 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.160
 choose the best 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.490
 and then to this a little bit more 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:02.680
 pester 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.570
 I hope that you 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.160
 understand my idea of ​​cape lodesma 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.940
 I will try to find a good guest blog 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.320
 which can from the moth go deep and 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.820
 tell on this topic 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.880
 I just tried to tell you how 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.469
 now and since it is archdiocese important 

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:23.229
 and please do not repeat their mistakes 

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:25.599
 it is very painful and very expensive 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:28.719
 since this is abashev's reputation even 

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:30.749
 Alexander Bourdon He says what to do 

00:02:30.749 --> 00:02:33.579
 since according to no need to forgive me 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:35.999
 repeat what the drivers in the portfolio 

00:02:35.999 --> 00:02:37.829
 other photographers 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:40.389
 sometimes it's ok sometimes not 

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:42.209
 please also form by 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.639
 this question your opinion but in any 

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:45.690
 case 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.220
 it’s better not to take on what was brought in and 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.680
 talk all the time 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.430
 the customer is worth anything to expect from you 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.130
 if this is your friend and mate you are shooting 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.740
 for super regular customers tell them 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.840
 that here is not always very strong 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.989
 and maybe either take it from another 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:03.909
 photographer a 

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:06.430
 either the results will be worse and elective 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.779
 let's not make less of a whale cop 

00:03:08.779 --> 00:03:11.169
 please be careful here still 

00:03:11.169 --> 00:03:13.689
 once customer expectations should be 

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:14.509
 all the time 

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:17.049
 so and what he would like that is all 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:19.590
 time say what happens at the end 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:20.540
 at least 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.220
 what do you understand what are you talking about one and 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.370
 same thing about the same finite 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.380
 As a result, it is very very important 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.630
 example if I photograph some 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.430
 order for store commercial there everything 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.160
 time is there a director card which 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.940
 looks at a computer monitor and shoot 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.680
 kozak mode bees and he looks and sees 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.239
 who is it or not 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.329
 whether you need to do it or not 

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:45.859
 already know what 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:47.869
 they want i will try for them 

00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:48.730
 to do everything 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.989
 so that they get this result so that 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:52.579
 they further worked with me 

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:55.650
 it's very very important talked but u 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.769
