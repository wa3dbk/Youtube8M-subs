00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.580

gonna take to bleach and die really well

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.130 
gonna take to bleach and die really well
I<00:02:35.920> also<00:02:36.370> have<00:02:36.819> a<00:02:36.850> lease<00:02:37.120> closure<00:02:37.510> and<00:02:37.900> it<00:02:37.989> came

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
I also have a lease closure and it came

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.790 
I also have a lease closure and it came
packaged<00:02:38.709> in<00:02:38.950> this<00:02:39.250> plastic<00:02:39.850> bag<00:02:40.150> and<00:02:40.540> I<00:02:41.350> love

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
packaged in this plastic bag and I love

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.979 
packaged in this plastic bag and I love
the<00:02:42.010> closure<00:02:42.340> because<00:02:42.730> it<00:02:43.239> does<00:02:43.480> have<00:02:43.780> the

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
the closure because it does have the

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:46.800 
the closure because it does have the
reinforced<00:02:44.530> edges<00:02:45.040> so<00:02:45.819> it<00:02:46.030> keeps<00:02:46.209> your<00:02:46.569> lace

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
reinforced edges so it keeps your lace

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.850 
reinforced edges so it keeps your lace
protected<00:02:47.650> and<00:02:48.209> it<00:02:49.209> doesn't<00:02:49.840> look<00:02:50.140> like<00:02:50.200> no

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
protected and it doesn't look like no

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.640 
protected and it doesn't look like no
the<00:02:51.010> nuts<00:02:51.220> are<00:02:51.549> not<00:02:51.880> bleached<00:02:52.390> but<00:02:53.019> I'll

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
the nuts are not bleached but I'll

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.979 
the nuts are not bleached but I'll
probably<00:02:54.010> go<00:02:54.610> in<00:02:54.880> and<00:02:55.209> bleach<00:02:55.450> these<00:02:55.750> knots

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
probably go in and bleach these knots

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:57.860 
probably go in and bleach these knots
because<00:02:56.410> I<00:02:56.620> have<00:02:56.980> been<00:02:57.220> doing<00:02:57.430> that<00:02:57.760> lately
