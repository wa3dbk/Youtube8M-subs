 let's see how to get infinite lives 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:14.680
 in the game candy crush saga 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:17.950
 first we are going to enter the game and 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:21.970
 we can see that there are 0 lives left and 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:24.640
 we have to wait about 20 minutes for 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.960
 have 5 lives or go get one 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:30.070
 by a 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:32.840

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:36.470
 we go back to press the button again 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:38.780
 go back out of the game is 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:41.890
 important that the game is linked to 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.890
 your facebook account 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:49.210
 we enter inside the menu of the device 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:52.030
 of our android in settings 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:54.210
 we enter applications or administer 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.210
 Applications 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:04.690
 we are looking for the candy crush app 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:07.210
 saga and we enter it 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:10.120
 will give us several options just 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:12.090
 we have to press the delete button 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:16.219
 data 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.219
 we accept the message that appears 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:23.620
 and once done we go back and 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:26.370
 we go back into the application of 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.370
 candy crush 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.270
 and we wait for him to load 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.140
 Once the application is started instead of 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.820
 press the play button what we have 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.580
 what to do is press the connect button 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:56.430
 as the first time is going to link from 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:59.250
 new with your facebook account 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:02.190
 we press the red button above the 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.490
 right and now if we press the button 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.700
 to play 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:10.539
 We can leave these screens 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.539
 by pressing the button on the X 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.989
 and as we can see, they appear 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:20.120
 the five lives and once I make them 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:22.879
 we have again we can do the same 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.640
 and so on and we would have lives 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:28.069
 infinite erasing the data since 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:31.220
 these data are stored directly in 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:32.959
 facebook and do not get lost and this process 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.180
 It can also be done in other 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:37.250

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.769
