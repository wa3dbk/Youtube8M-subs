00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.360 
can see how it fits in and it's now nice
and<00:03:04.190> flush<00:03:04.690> no<00:03:05.690> humps<00:03:05.990> in<00:03:06.110> the<00:03:06.200> floor<00:03:06.440> now<00:03:07.160> also

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
and flush no humps in the floor now also

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.100 
and flush no humps in the floor now also
we've<00:03:07.700> got<00:03:07.880> structural<00:03:08.330> beams<00:03:08.600> over<00:03:08.780> here

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
we've got structural beams over here

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:14.860 
we've got structural beams over here
that<00:03:10.810> ohio-based<00:03:12.070> the<00:03:13.070> walls<00:03:13.280> this<00:03:14.239> one<00:03:14.600> here

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
that ohio-based the walls this one here

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:16.540 
that ohio-based the walls this one here
and<00:03:15.110> that<00:03:15.170> wall<00:03:15.560> over<00:03:15.709> there<00:03:15.920> will<00:03:16.040> be<00:03:16.070> custom

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:16.550 
and that wall over there will be custom

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.420 
and that wall over there will be custom
cut<00:03:17.080> and<00:03:18.080> that<00:03:18.530> beam<00:03:18.800> will<00:03:18.950> hide<00:03:19.100> the<00:03:19.280> wall

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
cut and that beam will hide the wall

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.520 
cut and that beam will hide the wall
that<00:03:20.150> allows<00:03:20.209> us<00:03:20.450> to<00:03:20.690> put<00:03:20.930> in<00:03:21.019> a<00:03:21.080> bigger<00:03:21.260> beam

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
that allows us to put in a bigger beam

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.440 
that allows us to put in a bigger beam
without<00:03:21.739> any<00:03:22.100> one<00:03:22.280> I'm<00:03:22.940> going<00:03:23.090> to<00:03:23.150> know<00:03:23.300> it's

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
without any one I'm going to know it's

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.370 
without any one I'm going to know it's
there<00:03:23.690> so<00:03:24.050> it's<00:03:24.230> hidden<00:03:24.830> in<00:03:25.040> the<00:03:25.130> wall<00:03:26.380> looks

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
there so it's hidden in the wall looks

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.250 
there so it's hidden in the wall looks
great<00:03:27.620> up<00:03:27.769> here<00:03:28.120> little<00:03:29.120> bits<00:03:29.269> to<00:03:29.450> go<00:03:29.570> here

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
great up here little bits to go here

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.190 
great up here little bits to go here
I'll<00:03:32.220> be<00:03:32.340> coming<00:03:32.700> shortly<00:03:32.730> and<00:03:33.540> we've<00:03:34.019> already

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
I'll be coming shortly and we've already

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.750 
I'll be coming shortly and we've already
loaded<00:03:34.769> our<00:03:35.090> are<00:03:36.090> sheeting<00:03:36.510> for<00:03:36.540> our<00:03:36.780> walls

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
loaded our are sheeting for our walls

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.640 
loaded our are sheeting for our walls
probably<00:03:38.760> I<00:03:38.790> would<00:03:39.150> imagine<00:03:39.390> our<00:03:39.659> roof<00:03:39.900> up

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
probably I would imagine our roof up

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.820 
probably I would imagine our roof up
here<00:03:40.709> as<00:03:41.010> well<00:03:41.190> I<00:03:42.140> ready<00:03:43.140> to<00:03:43.260> rock<00:03:43.470> on<00:03:43.680> the

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
here as well I ready to rock on the

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:47.989 
here as well I ready to rock on the
walls<00:03:44.519> on<00:03:44.790> our<00:03:44.909> second<00:03:45.269> floor<00:03:45.299> and<00:03:45.599> tomorrow
