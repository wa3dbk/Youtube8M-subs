00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.540

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.890
 favorite cheese the green with gun and 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.900
 Bacon just tastes better 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.910
 then we cooked here before 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:55.840
 we still need 70 spaghetti 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:57.879
 milliliters of milk 48 form and for the 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.680
 root i take my pelvic floor rob 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:01.420
 the ingredients we need 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.129
 and then we start the eggs I have 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.590
 Now here in this shell given me 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:09.970
 then the milk is added 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:13.150
 and I say so and tart tablespoon 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.260
 from the bacon good job and the whole 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:19.150
 will be with a whisk 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:20.560
 The ice blends so nicely 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.670
 I'm preparing for that now 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.439
 set aside and we'll take care of it 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.510
 next to the mav in form and in the 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:27.130
 So I have a basin in the basin 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:32.530
 unpacked and I now share 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:33.820
 first in the middle of this half 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.759
 then slices worlds we live in our 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:40.270
 muffin form purely just so this one 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:42.369
 then take a bit overlap 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.920
 each two slices basin in one 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:46.590
 from that muffin square and yes 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.240
 that looks wonderful 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.859
 and now I'll grab those 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:55.600
 noodle the spaghetti and sit there 

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:57.399
 each a good handful pure that 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.479
 now is not so high survives 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:05.439
 But that's the power in form 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:07.179
 Well filled if you like our bacon 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:08.920

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:12.280

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:15.760
 our meddling and that's what we're going for 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:18.930
 now a little something here 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:23.740
 so do not overrun in this damage 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:27.090
 just that noodles then later 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.090
 be joined together nicely 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.680
 we could see that is exactly what is going on 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:36.600
 with the four eggs and the 60 milliliters 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.840

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.130
