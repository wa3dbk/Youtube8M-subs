00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.260
 today's tutorial is 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:15.570
 well for today we are going to learn then 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:18.240
 to paint a country- style bee and what 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.330
 what we are going to do first is with a 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:26.510
 kind of oval 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:29.290
 a little more or less chubby 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:33.369
 so that the bee looks like little 

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:33.369
 then another circle 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.780
 so we let dry 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:47.820
 we give him the brush 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:49.820
 and then with the white we are going to paint a 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.680
 of the wings 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.680
 that we painted it full 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:02.130
 and then we paint the other 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:11.290
 let's dry and apply two layers 

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:13.630
 I in this case already have a 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:16.170
 that had done previously good we 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.170
 lack 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.470
 make the antenitas 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:32.490
 and once it's dry then we're going to 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:35.420
 place these yellow lines just 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:39.049
 be very dry already for 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:42.340
 when it is already like this we are going to make a 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:42.340
 hairline here 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.250
 we delineate the entire half 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:57.920
 well and then just the little streaks that 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:00.409
 indicates that it is flying 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:05.420
 well I hope you liked it and that 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:07.960
 continue to decorate your projects with the 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.960
 country style
