00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.750
Today I'm going to show you how to break down
a chicken.

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:07.930
It's a really great skill to have.

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:11.190
It's going to save you a lot of money when
you go to the store and you get a whole chicken

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:17.029
verses buying a pre-broken down chicken with
the legs, thighs, breasts, wings already broken

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:18.029
down.

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.449
So, what you want to do is you want to get
a whole roasting chicken and there are several

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:22.449
ways to break it down.

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:28.240
What I like to do is start by breaking down
the backbone and then cut into two halves.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.150
So, take a really sharp knife.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:36.660
You really need a sharp knife and find the
sides of the back bone, and then just cut

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:46.620
right down the edge of that.

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:54.010
Then come over to the other side, and again
this is going to be a pretty tough cut.

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.629
You want a really good sharp knife.

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:00.640
When you get to the edge you can kind of trim
it off.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.089
Now, you want to have a waste bucket there,
so you can put in all the waste that you are

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:06.089
going to have.

00:01:06.089 --> 00:01:10.430
Now, take your chicken and kind of snap it
back.

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:15.940
You are going to follow the breast bone here,
and just cut right down the middle.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:25.800
This is going to leave you with two halves,
so we will sit this half over here and we

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.040
will work with this half.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:32.049
Now, there is some fat here on the back that
I like to get rid of.

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:37.829
Just take your knife and trim that off.

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:48.180
There is a natural gap here between the breast,
and the leg, and the thigh that you are just

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.000
going to follow.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.829
Turn it around.

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:01.840
So, now you've got two chicken quarters.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.420
This is great for barbeque chicken.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.909
This is what we like to cook with a lot of
times with the chicken quarters.

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:17.820
If you want to break this down even further,
you can pop out that leg from the thigh, and

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:25.170
again there is a natural curve in there.

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:36.400
I'm going to bring out a little bit bigger
knife, so I can kind of make this cut.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.060
So there is your first leg, and there is your
first thigh.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.209
Now, you can trim this thigh up a little bit
more, if you want to.

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.670
There are some pieces on here that you really
probably don't need to cook with that will

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.410
make it a little bit easier when it gets to
the dinner table.

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.650
You want to get any of these organs out of
there.

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:04.989
There is a little bit more skin and fat here.

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:12.200
There is the first thigh, and then the wing.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:21.690
We are going to take our bigger knife and
we are going to cut straight down.

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.879
We've got our wing and we've got our breast.

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:29.400
Now, we can do a couple of things here.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:35.319
We can either take out all of this bone, and
have a boneless breast, which we'll do with

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:43.180
this guy.

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:53.260
And we also have the tenderloin.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:59.659
This makes really nice nugget type things,
you can bread that, and fry that.

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:03.610
Then, we've got our boneless breast.

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:04.610
So there you go.

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:09.409
That's simply how to break down a chicken
into a breast, the tenderloin, the leg, the

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:14.120
thigh, and the wing, and you can repeat that
on the second side and you'll have yourself

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.030
a broken down chicken.
