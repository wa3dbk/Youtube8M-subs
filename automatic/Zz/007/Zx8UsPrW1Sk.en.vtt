some tomatoes in a plastic bag can you
show<00:01:07.380> us<00:01:07.409> how<00:01:07.890> this<00:01:08.070> method<00:01:08.490> works<00:01:09.590> so<00:01:10.590> what

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
show us how this method works so what

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.289 
show us how this method works so what
you<00:01:10.890> see<00:01:11.100> in<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.310> bag<00:01:11.490> right<00:01:11.760> now<00:01:11.820> is<00:01:12.180> you

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
you see in the bag right now is you

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.330 
you see in the bag right now is you
actually<00:01:12.689> see<00:01:12.930> visually<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.740> effect<00:01:14.130> or

now<00:01:52.619> I<00:01:52.799> want<00:01:53.009> to<00:01:53.159> know<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.310> little<00:01:53.520> bit<00:01:53.759> about

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
now I want to know a little bit about

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.469 
now I want to know a little bit about
the<00:01:54.119> advantages<00:01:54.479> of<00:01:55.140> this<00:01:55.500> process<00:01:55.790> ok<00:01:56.790> well

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
the advantages of this process ok well

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:58.999 
the advantages of this process ok well
there's<00:01:57.600> three<00:01:57.869> advantages<00:01:58.200> that<00:01:58.500> I<00:01:58.649> see<00:01:58.829> one

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
there's three advantages that I see one

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.459 
there's three advantages that I see one
of<00:01:59.159> them<00:01:59.280> is<00:01:59.460> is<00:01:59.700> the<00:02:00.200> energy<00:02:01.200> costs

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
of them is is the energy costs

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.380 
of them is is the energy costs

we're talking to fill a gallon size
package<00:02:06.090> with<00:02:06.509> this<00:02:06.630> ozone<00:02:07.079> we're<00:02:07.680> talking

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
package with this ozone we're talking

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.650 
package with this ozone we're talking
about<00:02:08.190> something<00:02:08.610> less<00:02:08.970> than<00:02:09.000> flipping<00:02:09.360> on<00:02:09.629> a

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
about something less than flipping on a

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:10.749 
about something less than flipping on a
light<00:02:09.929> bulb

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
light bulb

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:12.610 
light bulb
in<00:02:10.849> the<00:02:10.970> range<00:02:11.150> of<00:02:11.239> about<00:02:11.330> 30<00:02:11.689> to<00:02:11.870> 40<00:02:12.170> watts<00:02:12.409> of

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
in the range of about 30 to 40 watts of

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.500 
in the range of about 30 to 40 watts of
power<00:02:12.799> which<00:02:13.069> is<00:02:13.189> very<00:02:13.400> low<00:02:13.670> literally<00:02:14.120> less

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
power which is very low literally less

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.690 
power which is very low literally less
than<00:02:14.720> a<00:02:14.810> penny<00:02:15.019> per<00:02:15.739> package<00:02:16.250> to<00:02:16.430> do<00:02:16.549> this

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
than a penny per package to do this

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.460 
than a penny per package to do this
treatment<00:02:17.090> the<00:02:17.569> second<00:02:17.989> thing<00:02:18.140> with<00:02:18.349> the

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
treatment the second thing with the

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.770 
treatment the second thing with the
technology<00:02:18.829> is<00:02:19.250> it<00:02:19.430> allows<00:02:19.730> us<00:02:19.760> because<00:02:20.599> it's

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
technology is it allows us because it's

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.199 
technology is it allows us because it's
contained<00:02:21.379> within<00:02:21.709> the<00:02:21.950> package<00:02:22.430> it<00:02:23.030> actually

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
contained within the package it actually

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.110 
contained within the package it actually
allows<00:02:23.540> us<00:02:24.079> longer<00:02:24.560> contact<00:02:25.069> times<00:02:25.430> the<00:02:25.610> ozone

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
allows us longer contact times the ozone

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.050 
allows us longer contact times the ozone
to<00:02:26.629> react<00:02:26.959> and<00:02:27.170> kill<00:02:27.409> these<00:02:27.590> bacteria<00:02:28.280> and<00:02:28.549> the

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
to react and kill these bacteria and the

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.670 
to react and kill these bacteria and the
third<00:02:29.269> advantage<00:02:29.420> is<00:02:29.810> the<00:02:29.989> fact<00:02:30.019> that<00:02:30.319> its<00:02:30.500> low

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
third advantage is the fact that its low

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.220 
third advantage is the fact that its low
cost<00:02:30.980> to<00:02:31.519> set<00:02:31.730> up<00:02:31.909> so<00:02:32.209> basically<00:02:32.720> you<00:02:32.840> plug<00:02:33.079> it

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
cost to set up so basically you plug it

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.949 
cost to set up so basically you plug it
into<00:02:33.379> the<00:02:33.530> wall<00:02:33.560> and<00:02:34.040> it<00:02:34.579> starts<00:02:34.940> up<00:02:35.090> what<00:02:35.750> are

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
into the wall and it starts up what are

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:38.349 
into the wall and it starts up what are
some<00:02:35.989> of<00:02:36.409> your<00:02:36.440> future<00:02:36.920> plans<00:02:37.209> well<00:02:38.209> we're

units that would be it put into

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.860 
units that would be it put into
packaging<00:02:47.840> systems<00:02:48.290> for<00:02:48.739> fruit<00:02:48.920> vegetables
