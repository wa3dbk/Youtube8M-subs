00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.750 

all<00:00:01.410> right<00:00:01.589> so<00:00:01.890> I<00:00:01.920> get<00:00:02.220> a<00:00:02.250> little<00:00:02.370> makeshift

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
all right so I get a little makeshift

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.660 
all right so I get a little makeshift
workbench<00:00:03.270> here<00:00:03.480> and<00:00:04.370> most<00:00:05.370> of<00:00:05.490> the<00:00:05.549> way

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
workbench here and most of the way

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.700 
workbench here and most of the way
through<00:00:05.700> the<00:00:06.270> wiring<00:00:06.839> harness<00:00:07.259> you<00:00:07.410> can<00:00:07.529> see<00:00:07.649> I

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
through the wiring harness you can see I

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.310 
through the wiring harness you can see I
get<00:00:07.950> all<00:00:08.309> these<00:00:08.490> leads<00:00:09.389> started<00:00:09.780> up<00:00:09.900> and<00:00:10.110> for

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
get all these leads started up and for

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.480 
get all these leads started up and for
the<00:00:10.410> most<00:00:10.559> part<00:00:11.269> the<00:00:12.269> colors<00:00:12.599> just<00:00:12.809> match<00:00:13.049> up

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:13.490 
the most part the colors just match up

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:16.970 
the most part the colors just match up
one-to-one<00:00:14.490> so<00:00:15.650> it's<00:00:16.650> a<00:00:16.770> pretty

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
one-to-one so it's a pretty

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.470 
one-to-one so it's a pretty
straightforward<00:00:17.340> process<00:00:19.580> you<00:00:20.580> want<00:00:20.789> your

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
straightforward process you want your

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.620 
straightforward process you want your
heat<00:00:21.660> shrink<00:00:21.689> tubing<00:00:22.760> and<00:00:23.760> I<00:00:24.060> just<00:00:24.269> cut<00:00:24.480> those

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
heat shrink tubing and I just cut those

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.750 
heat shrink tubing and I just cut those
two<00:00:24.840> lengths<00:00:25.760> beforehand<00:00:28.340> you're<00:00:29.340> gonna<00:00:29.550> need

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
two lengths beforehand you're gonna need

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.510 
two lengths beforehand you're gonna need
your<00:00:29.820> wire<00:00:30.210> strippers<00:00:31.160> electrical<00:00:32.160> tape<00:00:32.369> if

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
your wire strippers electrical tape if

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.389 
your wire strippers electrical tape if
you're<00:00:32.669> not<00:00:32.790> using<00:00:32.969> heat<00:00:33.210> shrink<00:00:33.420> tubing<00:00:34.399> if

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
you're not using heat shrink tubing if

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:36.650 
you're not using heat shrink tubing if
you<00:00:35.550> are<00:00:35.640> using<00:00:35.790> heat<00:00:36.000> shrink<00:00:36.180> tubing<00:00:36.420> a<00:00:36.480> heat

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
you are using heat shrink tubing a heat

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.959 
you are using heat shrink tubing a heat
gun<00:00:36.809> helps<00:00:37.140> a<00:00:37.230> lot<00:00:37.380> to<00:00:37.860> seal<00:00:38.190> it<00:00:38.309> up<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.610> of

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
gun helps a lot to seal it up and of

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.410 
gun helps a lot to seal it up and of
course<00:00:39.149> your<00:00:39.329> soldering<00:00:39.660> iron<00:00:39.980> you<00:00:41.270> want<00:00:42.270> to

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
course your soldering iron you want to

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.080 
course your soldering iron you want to
strip<00:00:42.629> your<00:00:42.809> ends<00:00:43.559> of<00:00:43.620> your<00:00:43.710> wires<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:44.309> you

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
strip your ends of your wires and you

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.080 
strip your ends of your wires and you
want<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.300> just<00:00:45.390> apply<00:00:45.660> some<00:00:46.020> solder<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.739> the

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.090 
want to just apply some solder to the

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.819 
want to just apply some solder to the
stranded<00:00:48.090> end<00:00:48.270> of<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.539> wire<00:00:48.719> there<00:00:49.020> like<00:00:49.559> that

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
stranded end of the wire there like that

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.100 
stranded end of the wire there like that
so<00:00:50.700> even<00:00:51.090> before<00:00:51.270> these<00:00:51.570> you<00:00:51.870> know<00:00:51.960> this

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
so even before these you know this

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.119 
so even before these you know this
yellow<00:00:52.410> is<00:00:52.440> going<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:52.710> connect<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:53.039> this

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
yellow is going to connect to this

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.220 
yellow is going to connect to this
yellow<00:00:53.309> here<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:54.059> even<00:00:54.600> before<00:00:54.809> I've<00:00:54.989> got<00:00:55.140> it

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
yellow here and even before I've got it

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.990 
yellow here and even before I've got it
connected<00:00:55.469> I<00:00:55.949> want<00:00:56.340> to<00:00:56.399> have<00:00:56.489> some<00:00:56.610> solder<00:00:56.879> on

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
connected I want to have some solder on

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.840 
connected I want to have some solder on
it<00:00:57.680> and<00:00:58.680> then<00:00:58.920> you<00:00:59.100> want<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.309> remember<00:00:59.609> to

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
it and then you want to remember to

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.779 
it and then you want to remember to
slide<00:01:00.600> your<00:01:00.870> each<00:01:01.020> shrink<00:01:01.289> tubing<00:01:01.649> over<00:01:02.190> the

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
slide your each shrink tubing over the

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.850 
slide your each shrink tubing over the
wire<00:01:02.969> first<00:01:03.420> before<00:01:04.290> you<00:01:04.350> make<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.619> solder

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
wire first before you make the solder

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.490 
wire first before you make the solder
joint<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:05.880> you<00:01:06.570> just<00:01:06.689> slide<00:01:06.869> that<00:01:07.110> back<00:01:09.500> out

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
joint and you just slide that back out

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.399 
joint and you just slide that back out
of<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.710> way<00:01:11.330> and<00:01:12.330> now<00:01:12.780> that<00:01:13.049> these<00:01:13.200> are

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
of the way and now that these are

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.600 
of the way and now that these are
already<00:01:13.830> pre<00:01:14.100> tinned<00:01:15.560> I'm<00:01:16.560> just<00:01:16.950> using<00:01:17.100> a<00:01:17.280> clip

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
already pre tinned I'm just using a clip

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.190 
already pre tinned I'm just using a clip
because<00:01:18.210> I<00:01:18.270> only<00:01:18.390> have<00:01:18.509> one<00:01:18.570> set<00:01:18.930> of<00:01:19.020> hands

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
because I only have one set of hands

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.410 
because I only have one set of hands
here<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:19.710> basically<00:01:20.700> you<00:01:20.909> just<00:01:20.939> clip<00:01:21.330> them

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
here and basically you just clip them

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.240 
here and basically you just clip them
together<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:22.409> solder<00:01:22.680> now<00:01:22.979> that<00:01:23.130> it's

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
together the solder now that it's

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.410 
together the solder now that it's
already<00:01:23.400> ten<00:01:23.640> you'll<00:01:23.790> only<00:01:23.939> have<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.210> apply<00:01:24.270> a

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
already ten you'll only have to apply a

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.210 
already ten you'll only have to apply a
tiny<00:01:24.689> amount<00:01:25.020> of<00:01:25.140> solder<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.740> it'll<00:01:26.070> just

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
tiny amount of solder and it'll just

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.100 
tiny amount of solder and it'll just
flow<00:01:26.430> between<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.880> two<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:27.750> you'll<00:01:27.960> get<00:01:28.049> a

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
flow between the two and you'll get a

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.380 
flow between the two and you'll get a
nice<00:01:28.259> connection<00:01:29.240> so<00:01:30.240> let's<00:01:30.570> do<00:01:30.750> that

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
nice connection so let's do that

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.219 
nice connection so let's do that
all<00:01:33.390> right<00:01:33.540> so<00:01:33.689> once<00:01:33.869> you've<00:01:34.020> got<00:01:34.200> your

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
all right so once you've got your

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.170 
all right so once you've got your
connection<00:01:34.829> and<00:01:35.070> in<00:01:35.280> all<00:01:35.400> honesty<00:01:35.850> that's<00:01:36.030> not

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
connection and in all honesty that's not

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.819 
connection and in all honesty that's not
the<00:01:36.329> nicest<00:01:36.540> one<00:01:36.930> done<00:01:37.200> today<00:01:37.790> you<00:01:39.530> can<00:01:40.530> slide

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
the nicest one done today you can slide

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.410 
the nicest one done today you can slide
your<00:01:40.860> heat<00:01:41.159> shrink<00:01:41.189> back<00:01:41.670> up<00:01:41.909> that's<00:01:42.150> what<00:01:42.360> you

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
your heat shrink back up that's what you

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.380 
your heat shrink back up that's what you
should<00:01:42.570> put<00:01:42.750> it<00:01:42.810> on<00:01:42.869> there<00:01:43.079> before<00:01:43.399> and<00:01:47.390> just

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
should put it on there before and just

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:55.520 
should put it on there before and just
get<00:01:48.509> that<00:01:48.689> centered<00:01:49.170> just<00:01:54.229> take<00:01:55.229> your<00:01:55.409> heat

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
get that centered just take your heat

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:06.410 
get that centered just take your heat
gun<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:55.770> it

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.040 

shrinks<00:02:07.420> right<00:02:07.630> up<00:02:07.750> around<00:02:07.930> her<00:02:08.229> joint

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
shrinks right up around her joint

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.960 
shrinks right up around her joint
and<00:02:11.050> we're<00:02:11.319> all<00:02:11.440> set<00:02:12.090> onto<00:02:13.090> the<00:02:13.360> next<00:02:13.510> one<00:02:13.629> and

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
and we're all set onto the next one and

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.490 
and we're all set onto the next one and
the<00:02:15.970> key<00:02:16.150> to<00:02:16.269> solder<00:02:16.510> really<00:02:16.810> is<00:02:16.930> you<00:02:17.319> don't

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
the key to solder really is you don't

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:18.839 
the key to solder really is you don't
need<00:02:17.709> a<00:02:17.739> ton<00:02:18.010> of<00:02:18.069> solder<00:02:18.370> and<00:02:18.549> you<00:02:18.610> don't<00:02:18.760> need

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:18.849 
need a ton of solder and you don't need

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:21.210 
need a ton of solder and you don't need
a<00:02:18.909> ton<00:02:19.150> of<00:02:19.180> heat<00:02:19.420> and<00:02:19.860> you<00:02:20.860> know<00:02:20.950> I've<00:02:21.069> got

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
a ton of heat and you know I've got

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.580 
a ton of heat and you know I've got
cheapo<00:02:21.819> soldering<00:02:22.209> iron<00:02:22.510> there<00:02:22.690> but<00:02:22.870> the<00:02:23.110> the

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
cheapo soldering iron there but the the

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:24.899 
cheapo soldering iron there but the the
temperature-controlled<00:02:24.190> ones<00:02:24.640> are<00:02:24.790> much

00:02:24.899 --> 00:02:24.909 
temperature-controlled ones are much

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:27.440 
temperature-controlled ones are much
nicer<00:02:25.230> because<00:02:26.230> the<00:02:26.470> key<00:02:26.709> is<00:02:26.890> not<00:02:27.069> a

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
nicer because the key is not a

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.520 
nicer because the key is not a
tremendous<00:02:28.450> amount<00:02:28.569> of<00:02:28.810> heat<00:02:28.989> eventually

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
tremendous amount of heat eventually

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.110 
tremendous amount of heat eventually
you'll<00:02:29.799> just<00:02:29.830> start<00:02:30.190> burning<00:02:30.430> the<00:02:30.640> solder<00:02:30.910> the

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
you'll just start burning the solder the

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.240 
you'll just start burning the solder the
key<00:02:31.299> is<00:02:31.900> to<00:02:32.170> get<00:02:32.290> just<00:02:32.530> enough<00:02:32.650> for<00:02:32.950> the<00:02:32.980> solder

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
key is to get just enough for the solder

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.440 
key is to get just enough for the solder
to<00:02:33.370> flow<00:02:33.810> and<00:02:34.810> that's<00:02:35.049> all<00:02:35.290> the<00:02:35.379> heat<00:02:35.530> you<00:02:35.560> need

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
to flow and that's all the heat you need

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.089 
to flow and that's all the heat you need
all<00:02:37.450> right<00:02:37.629> series<00:02:38.230> you<00:02:38.379> can<00:02:38.500> see<00:02:38.769> I<00:02:38.799> got<00:02:39.069> all

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:39.099 
all right series you can see I got all

with the head unit going all the way
back<00:02:52.000> so<00:02:52.209> I'm<00:02:52.540> gonna<00:02:52.599> have<00:02:52.750> to<00:02:52.840> cut<00:02:53.049> a<00:02:53.319> little

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
back so I'm gonna have to cut a little

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:57.089 
back so I'm gonna have to cut a little
piece<00:02:54.099> out<00:02:54.250> here<00:02:54.310> and<00:02:55.709> just<00:02:56.709> to<00:02:56.829> allow<00:02:57.010> that

00:02:57.089 --> 00:02:57.099 
piece out here and just to allow that

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:59.729 
piece out here and just to allow that
you<00:02:57.400> just<00:02:57.640> slide<00:02:57.849> all<00:02:58.000> the<00:02:58.030> way<00:02:58.120> back<00:02:58.680> so<00:02:59.680> I'm

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
you just slide all the way back so I'm

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:01.920 
you just slide all the way back so I'm
gonna<00:02:59.799> go<00:02:59.950> ahead<00:03:00.069> and<00:03:00.160> do<00:03:00.250> that<00:03:00.280> now<00:03:00.640> with<00:03:01.569> a

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
gonna go ahead and do that now with a

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.089 
gonna go ahead and do that now with a
pair<00:03:02.470> of<00:03:02.500> diagonal<00:03:03.099> cutters<00:03:04.620> and<00:03:05.620> that's

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:06.099 
pair of diagonal cutters and that's

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:07.530 
pair of diagonal cutters and that's
probably<00:03:06.430> because<00:03:06.579> I<00:03:06.879> got<00:03:07.030> the<00:03:07.120> flush<00:03:07.269> mount

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
probably because I got the flush mount

probably because I got the flush mount
kit<00:03:07.780> Christ<00:03:08.440> sets<00:03:08.680> it<00:03:08.799> back<00:03:08.829> tiny<00:03:09.400> bit<00:03:09.609> farther

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:09.819 
kit Christ sets it back tiny bit farther

kit Christ sets it back tiny bit farther
and<00:03:10.359> that's<00:03:10.810> why<00:03:10.930> that's<00:03:11.140> interfering<00:03:11.709> but

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:11.859 
and that's why that's interfering but

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:13.830 
and that's why that's interfering but
that<00:03:12.010> much<00:03:12.280> rather<00:03:12.519> have<00:03:12.760> it<00:03:12.879> flush<00:03:13.060> mount<00:03:13.359> and

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
that much rather have it flush mount and

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.140 
that much rather have it flush mount and
trim<00:03:14.410> the<00:03:14.560> back<00:03:14.709> of<00:03:14.889> the<00:03:14.950> dash<00:03:15.130> then<00:03:15.940> to<00:03:16.090> have

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
trim the back of the dash then to have

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.390 
trim the back of the dash then to have
it<00:03:16.299> sticking<00:03:16.690> out<00:03:16.810> like<00:03:17.769> some<00:03:17.950> sort<00:03:18.160> of<00:03:18.220> goofy

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
it sticking out like some sort of goofy

it sticking out like some sort of goofy
