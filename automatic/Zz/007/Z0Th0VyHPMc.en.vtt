00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.600 

we're<00:00:01.170> going<00:00:01.290> to<00:00:01.350> work<00:00:01.500> on<00:00:01.829> a<00:00:02.220> drill<00:00:02.580> called

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
we're going to work on a drill called

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.820 
we're going to work on a drill called
policy<00:00:03.300> drill<00:00:03.810> but<00:00:04.020> it's<00:00:04.140> the<00:00:04.230> sensitivity

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
policy drill but it's the sensitivity

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.909 
policy drill but it's the sensitivity
flow<00:00:05.069> drill<00:00:05.400> and<00:00:05.779> it's<00:00:06.779> helped<00:00:07.680> you<00:00:07.770> develop

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
flow drill and it's helped you develop

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.180 
flow drill and it's helped you develop
some<00:00:08.309> of<00:00:08.429> your<00:00:08.519> reflexes<00:00:09.059> with<00:00:09.269> the<00:00:09.360> blade<00:00:09.570> and

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:10.190 
some of your reflexes with the blade and

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:12.919 
some of your reflexes with the blade and
so<00:00:11.190> it's<00:00:11.580> there's<00:00:11.880> a<00:00:11.969> lot<00:00:12.000> of<00:00:12.210> variables<00:00:12.599> on<00:00:12.809> it

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
so it's there's a lot of variables on it

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.450 
so it's there's a lot of variables on it
but<00:00:13.049> we'll<00:00:13.170> work<00:00:13.349> a<00:00:13.530> few<00:00:13.710> of<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:13.950> variables

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
but we'll work a few of the variables

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.109 
but we'll work a few of the variables
and<00:00:14.759> obviously<00:00:15.509> the<00:00:15.690> basic<00:00:16.279> idea<00:00:17.279> of<00:00:17.699> the

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
and obviously the basic idea of the

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.029 
and obviously the basic idea of the
start<00:00:18.990> out<00:00:19.109> pattern<00:00:19.529> and<00:00:19.680> then<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:19.830> pattern

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
start out pattern and then the pattern

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.179 
start out pattern and then the pattern
goes<00:00:20.670> into<00:00:21.260> freelance<00:00:22.260> after<00:00:22.650> a<00:00:22.680> while<00:00:22.859> but

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
goes into freelance after a while but

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.349 
goes into freelance after a while but
you're<00:00:23.340> going<00:00:23.460> to<00:00:23.550> start<00:00:23.789> out<00:00:23.880> with<00:00:24.060> some<00:00:24.269> of

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
you're going to start out with some of

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.320 
you're going to start out with some of
the<00:00:24.420> basics<00:00:24.810> so<00:00:25.380> one<00:00:26.039> guy<00:00:26.279> can<00:00:26.640> take<00:00:26.910> a<00:00:26.939> sock

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
the basics so one guy can take a sock

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.169 
the basics so one guy can take a sock
sock<00:00:27.570> grip<00:00:27.900> and<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.320> other<00:00:28.470> guy<00:00:28.590> can<00:00:28.800> take<00:00:29.179> the

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
sock grip and the other guy can take the

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.659 
sock grip and the other guy can take the
call<00:00:30.420> grip<00:00:30.720> where<00:00:31.410> you<00:00:31.470> can<00:00:31.650> have<00:00:31.830> known<00:00:32.309> as

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
call grip where you can have known as

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.880 
call grip where you can have known as
the<00:00:32.940> hammer<00:00:33.360> grip<00:00:33.660> and<00:00:33.870> an<00:00:33.960> icepick<00:00:34.380> grip<00:00:34.649> or

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
the hammer grip and an icepick grip or

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.600 
the hammer grip and an icepick grip or
various<00:00:35.399> other<00:00:35.520> names<00:00:35.640> so<00:00:36.890> the<00:00:37.890> one<00:00:38.129> will

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
various other names so the one will

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.250 
various other names so the one will
start<00:00:38.879> out<00:00:39.059> with<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.270> 5<00:00:39.570> thrust<00:00:40.020> which<00:00:40.230> is

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
start out with a 5 thrust which is

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.139 
start out with a 5 thrust which is
strength<00:00:40.770> thrust<00:00:41.100> that's<00:00:41.430> one<00:00:41.610> way<00:00:41.760> to<00:00:41.790> do<00:00:42.030> it

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
strength thrust that's one way to do it

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.170 
strength thrust that's one way to do it
and<00:00:42.540> you<00:00:42.899> could<00:00:43.050> do<00:00:43.260> with<00:00:43.559> a<00:00:43.590> cutting<00:00:44.460> good

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
and you could do with a cutting good

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.270 
and you could do with a cutting good
thing<00:00:45.390> going<00:00:45.719> on<00:00:45.840> here<00:00:45.899> and<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.829> next<00:00:47.039> motion

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
thing going on here and the next motion

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.610 
thing going on here and the next motion
then<00:00:47.610> goes<00:00:47.850> towards<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.329> kidney<00:00:48.750> and<00:00:48.930> then<00:00:49.469> he

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
then goes towards the kidney and then he

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.470 
then goes towards the kidney and then he
comes<00:00:49.829> up<00:00:49.980> to<00:00:50.160> go<00:00:50.250> towards<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.700> neck<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.329> then

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
comes up to go towards the neck and then

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.810 
comes up to go towards the neck and then
take<00:00:52.079> it<00:00:52.230> off<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:52.800> you<00:00:53.070> scoop<00:00:53.340> it<00:00:53.460> down<00:00:53.640> you

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
take it off and you scoop it down you

take it off and you scoop it down you
scoop<00:00:54.120> it<00:00:54.210> down<00:00:54.390> that's<00:00:54.539> representing<00:00:55.170> that

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
scoop it down that's representing that

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.529 
scoop it down that's representing that
you<00:00:55.379> can<00:00:55.500> go<00:00:55.590> in<00:00:55.770> for<00:00:56.460> this<00:00:56.610> when<00:00:57.180> you<00:00:57.270> do<00:00:57.390> the

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
you can go in for this when you do the

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.560 
you can go in for this when you do the
first<00:00:57.719> scoop<00:00:58.050> if<00:00:59.039> he<00:00:59.129> fees<00:00:59.340> of<00:00:59.489> 5<00:00:59.699> you<00:00:59.910> go<00:01:00.390> like

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
first scoop if he fees of 5 you go like

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.200 
first scoop if he fees of 5 you go like
this<00:01:00.809> it's<00:01:01.350> gonna<00:01:01.500> go<00:01:01.649> towards<00:01:02.489> this<00:01:02.820> kidney

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
this it's gonna go towards this kidney

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.960 
this it's gonna go towards this kidney
over<00:01:03.420> here<00:01:03.629> ok<00:01:04.500> now<00:01:04.650> when<00:01:04.920> you're<00:01:05.040> coming<00:01:05.850> back

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
over here ok now when you're coming back

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.660 
over here ok now when you're coming back
to<00:01:06.270> this<00:01:06.360> position<00:01:06.600> so<00:01:07.409> one<00:01:08.070> ways<00:01:08.250> he<00:01:08.520> could

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
to this position so one ways he could

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.460 
to this position so one ways he could
feed<00:01:08.790> a<00:01:08.820> 5<00:01:09.090> you<00:01:09.479> can<00:01:09.689> feed<00:01:09.900> it<00:01:09.930> slightly

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
feed a 5 you can feed it slightly

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.469 
feed a 5 you can feed it slightly
curving<00:01:11.070> this<00:01:11.369> way<00:01:11.430> where<00:01:11.850> he<00:01:11.909> can<00:01:12.030> feed<00:01:12.210> it<00:01:12.330> up

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
curving this way where he can feed it up

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.020 
curving this way where he can feed it up
so<00:01:13.140> we'll<00:01:13.710> start<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.040> flow<00:01:14.250> was<00:01:14.549> hopeful<00:01:14.880> feed

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
so we'll start the flow was hopeful feed

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.760 
so we'll start the flow was hopeful feed
it<00:01:15.150> on<00:01:15.299> a<00:01:15.330> higher<00:01:15.630> line<00:01:15.930> so<00:01:16.140> you<00:01:16.229> got<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.439> scoop

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
it on a higher line so you got to scoop

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.359 
it on a higher line so you got to scoop
down<00:01:17.780> the<00:01:18.780> yarn<00:01:19.020> go<00:01:19.380> towards<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.830> kidney<00:01:20.159> he

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
down the yarn go towards the kidney he

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.149 
down the yarn go towards the kidney he
comes<00:01:20.580> back<00:01:20.820> up<00:01:21.049> ok<00:01:22.049> she<00:01:22.110> comes<00:01:22.619> up<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:22.920> the

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
comes back up ok she comes up to the

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.370 
comes back up ok she comes up to the
neck<00:01:23.369> you're<00:01:23.549> going<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:23.759> splash<00:01:24.090> he<00:01:24.960> parries

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
neck you're going to splash he parries

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.289 
neck you're going to splash he parries
it<00:01:25.530> down<00:01:25.710> you<00:01:25.920> scoop<00:01:26.220> this<00:01:26.430> off<00:01:26.610> it's

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
it down you scoop this off it's

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.090 
it down you scoop this off it's
obviously<00:01:27.810> a<00:01:27.900> drill<00:01:28.200> so<00:01:28.320> you're<00:01:28.500> continuing

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
obviously a drill so you're continuing

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.569 
obviously a drill so you're continuing
to<00:01:29.130> flow<00:01:29.579> so<00:01:29.970> he<00:01:30.119> comes<00:01:30.329> back<00:01:30.570> scoop<00:01:31.530> go<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.340> the

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
to flow so he comes back scoop go to the

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.109 
to flow so he comes back scoop go to the
kidney<00:01:32.939> up<00:01:33.210> slash<00:01:33.869> back<00:01:34.439> okay<00:01:35.400> he<00:01:35.820> would<00:01:36.000> get

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
kidney up slash back okay he would get

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.929 
kidney up slash back okay he would get
the<00:01:36.329> 5<00:01:37.110> thrust<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:37.799> it<00:01:37.920> started<00:01:38.340> certified

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
the 5 thrust and it started certified

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.149 
the 5 thrust and it started certified
and<00:01:39.420> come<00:01:39.750> back<00:01:39.930> through<00:01:40.290> here<00:01:40.320> he<00:01:40.860> can<00:01:41.009> do

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
and come back through here he can do

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.630 
and come back through here he can do
another<00:01:41.880> curving<00:01:42.360> for<00:01:42.509> us<00:01:43.189> ok<00:01:44.189> so<00:01:44.280> we're<00:01:44.520> going

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
another curving for us ok so we're going

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.260

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
here and we go with the basic flow

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.589 
here and we go with the basic flow
sometimes<00:02:36.510> he<00:02:36.810> clocks<00:02:37.530> inside<00:02:38.099> and<00:02:38.489> you<00:02:39.300> scoop

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.089 
down and check it then he'll come back
with<00:02:53.099> a<00:02:53.160> stagger<00:02:53.489> go<00:02:54.269> over<00:02:54.420> it<00:02:54.780> so<00:02:55.769> this<00:02:55.890> is<00:02:55.980> the

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 
with a stagger go over it so this is the

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:58.759

basic knife love gives you some reflexes
and<00:02:59.310> you<00:02:59.730> put<00:02:59.940> the<00:03:00.030> variations<00:03:00.659> in<00:03:04.370> then<00:03:05.370> you

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
and you put the variations in then you

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:07.850 
and you put the variations in then you
can<00:03:05.580> go<00:03:05.670> back<00:03:05.700> inside<00:03:06.569> the<00:03:06.780> bud<00:03:06.959> with<00:03:07.590> all<00:03:07.739> the

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
can go back inside the bud with all the

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.160 
can go back inside the bud with all the
other<00:03:07.980> variations<00:03:08.550> of<00:03:08.700> this<00:03:08.909> but<00:03:09.780> then<00:03:09.930> flow

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
other variations of this but then flow

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:16.130 
other variations of this but then flow
back<00:03:10.409> into<00:03:10.440> the<00:03:10.860> drill<00:03:11.099> again<00:03:14.810> and<00:03:15.810> we'll<00:03:15.959> end

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
back into the drill again and we'll end

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.409 
back into the drill again and we'll end
it<00:03:16.200> there
