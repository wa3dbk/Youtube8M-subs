00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
little bit about the the versatility

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.149 
little bit about the the versatility
right<00:02:01.350> so<00:02:01.500> I<00:02:01.530> know<00:02:01.650> that<00:02:01.770> was<00:02:01.860> one<00:02:02.010> of<00:02:02.040> the

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.899 
things that with the team really weren't
kind<00:02:03.750> of<00:02:03.810> build<00:02:04.020> into<00:02:04.290> this<00:02:04.560> was<00:02:05.100> a<00:02:05.130> notion<00:02:05.670> of

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
kind of build into this was a notion of

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.820 
kind of build into this was a notion of
versatility<00:02:06.330> of<00:02:06.570> multi<00:02:07.049> modes<00:02:07.320> and<00:02:07.590> high<00:02:07.710> end
