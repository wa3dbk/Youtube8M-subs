all<00:00:15.719> right<00:00:15.870> so<00:00:16.110> I<00:00:16.139> thought<00:00:16.350> I'd<00:00:16.440> do<00:00:16.529> this<00:00:16.619> video

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
all right so I thought I'd do this video

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.359 
all right so I thought I'd do this video
on<00:00:17.010> how<00:00:17.160> torque<00:00:17.640> Evert<00:00:17.939> works<00:00:18.360> for<00:00:18.720> a<00:00:18.750> go-kart

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:19.369 
on how torque Evert works for a go-kart

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:21.620 
on how torque Evert works for a go-kart
this<00:00:20.369> is<00:00:20.520> a<00:00:20.610> torque<00:00:20.850> converter<00:00:20.910> off<00:00:21.390> at

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
this is a torque converter off at

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.530 
this is a torque converter off at
go-kart<00:00:22.080> right<00:00:22.259> there<00:00:22.490> um<00:00:23.490> what<00:00:23.790> you<00:00:23.880> have<00:00:24.119> is

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:24.540 
go-kart right there um what you have is

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.019 
go-kart right there um what you have is
your<00:00:24.960> clutch<00:00:25.500> assembly<00:00:25.740> this<00:00:26.340> is<00:00:26.520> a<00:00:26.550> common

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
your clutch assembly this is a common

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.460 
your clutch assembly this is a common
industries<00:00:27.689> it's<00:00:28.590> an<00:00:28.740> older<00:00:29.599> older<00:00:30.599> series<00:00:31.230> I

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
industries it's an older older series I

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.990 
industries it's an older older series I
don't<00:00:31.919> think<00:00:32.130> they<00:00:32.220> make<00:00:32.430> this<00:00:32.579> series

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
don't think they make this series

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.620 
don't think they make this series
anymore

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
anymore

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.630

this<00:00:34.110> piece<00:00:34.410> is<00:00:34.590> rust<00:00:34.920> and<00:00:35.160> sell<00:00:35.399> it<00:00:35.520> that

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
this piece is rust and sell it that

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.170 
this piece is rust and sell it that
brass<00:00:35.970> belt<00:00:36.510> runner<00:00:37.050> is<00:00:37.260> rust<00:00:37.590> and<00:00:37.800> solid<00:00:38.309> but

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
brass belt runner is rust and solid but

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.200 
brass belt runner is rust and solid but
um<00:00:40.130> it's<00:00:41.130> just<00:00:41.219> like<00:00:41.489> a<00:00:41.520> centrifugal<00:00:41.969> clutch

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
um it's just like a centrifugal clutch

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.299 
um it's just like a centrifugal clutch
this<00:00:42.450> is<00:00:42.630> the<00:00:42.750> older<00:00:43.079> style<00:00:43.410> what<00:00:43.800> it<00:00:43.920> does<00:00:44.100> is

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
this is the older style what it does is

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.360 
this is the older style what it does is
when<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.550> engine<00:00:44.820> speeds<00:00:45.149> up<00:00:45.949> this<00:00:46.949> spreads

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
when the engine speeds up this spreads

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.810 
when the engine speeds up this spreads
apart<00:00:47.550> catching<00:00:48.539> on<00:00:48.750> this<00:00:49.050> inside<00:00:49.710> here<00:00:50.190> thus

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
apart catching on this inside here thus

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.380 
apart catching on this inside here thus
creating<00:00:51.449> speed<00:00:52.249> now<00:00:53.249> the<00:00:53.309> motor<00:00:53.789> is<00:00:54.030> running

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
creating speed now the motor is running

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.579 
creating speed now the motor is running
a<00:00:54.510> fairly<00:00:54.870> low<00:00:55.199> rpm<00:00:56.660> but<00:00:57.660> your<00:00:57.839> belt<00:00:58.079> runs<00:00:58.409> on

00:00:58.579 --> 00:00:58.589 
a fairly low rpm but your belt runs on

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:02.090 
a fairly low rpm but your belt runs on
here<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.100> what<00:00:59.280> happens<00:00:59.760> when<00:00:59.879> this<00:01:01.100> pushes

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
here and what happens when this pushes

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.790 
here and what happens when this pushes
out<00:01:02.280> I<00:01:03.140> don't<00:01:04.140> know<00:01:04.230> if<00:01:04.320> you<00:01:04.379> can<00:01:04.500> see<00:01:04.650> what

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:04.800 
out I don't know if you can see what

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.160 
out I don't know if you can see what
this<00:01:04.949> whole<00:01:05.129> thing<00:01:05.400> moves<00:01:05.760> and<00:01:06.150> it's<00:01:06.390> put

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
this whole thing moves and it's put

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.240 
this whole thing moves and it's put
together<00:01:07.320> like<00:01:07.800> this<00:01:08.159> and<00:01:09.530> this<00:01:10.530> inner<00:01:10.860> piece

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
together like this and this inner piece

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.490 
together like this and this inner piece
right<00:01:11.520> here<00:01:12.229> moves<00:01:13.490> and<00:01:15.200> tightens<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.290> belt

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
right here moves and tightens the belt

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.290 
right here moves and tightens the belt
now<00:01:17.040> there's<00:01:17.280> one<00:01:17.400> more<00:01:17.460> part<00:01:17.820> that<00:01:18.000> goes<00:01:18.120> with

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:18.300 
now there's one more part that goes with

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.510 
now there's one more part that goes with
it<00:01:18.450> along<00:01:18.630> with<00:01:18.690> the<00:01:18.870> torque<00:01:19.140> converter<00:01:19.520> it's

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
it along with the torque converter it's

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.010 
it along with the torque converter it's
it's<00:01:20.850> raining<00:01:21.300> out<00:01:21.420> so<00:01:21.450> I'm<00:01:21.630> gonna<00:01:21.780> make<00:01:21.900> this

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
it's raining out so I'm gonna make this

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.470 
it's raining out so I'm gonna make this
quick<00:01:22.230> it's<00:01:23.010> this<00:01:23.220> big<00:01:23.460> pulley<00:01:23.790> right<00:01:24.120> here

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:24.480 
quick it's this big pulley right here

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.860 
quick it's this big pulley right here
and<00:01:24.660> the<00:01:24.750> belt<00:01:25.050> this<00:01:25.980> pulley<00:01:26.330> it's<00:01:27.330> a<00:01:27.450> common

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:27.870 
and the belt this pulley it's a common

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.230 
and the belt this pulley it's a common
industries<00:01:28.470> Richmond<00:01:29.040> Indiana<00:01:29.190> I<00:01:29.790> think<00:01:30.090> it's

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
industries Richmond Indiana I think it's

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.350 
industries Richmond Indiana I think it's
just<00:01:30.450> number<00:01:31.230> 20<00:01:31.590> or<00:01:31.710> something<00:01:31.890> like<00:01:32.130> it<00:01:32.360> but

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
just number 20 or something like it but

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.260 
just number 20 or something like it but
on<00:01:33.540> this<00:01:33.750> pulley<00:01:34.080> here<00:01:34.730> has<00:01:35.730> a<00:01:35.760> little<00:01:36.060> spring

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
on this pulley here has a little spring

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.930 
on this pulley here has a little spring
in<00:01:36.480> here<00:01:36.660> that<00:01:36.810> makes<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.230> speedin<00:01:37.830> whatnot

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 
in here that makes a speedin whatnot

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.490 
in here that makes a speedin whatnot
I<00:01:38.970> don't<00:01:39.420> know<00:01:39.510> what<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.840> technical<00:01:40.170> term<00:01:40.320> for

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
I don't know what the technical term for

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.990 
I don't know what the technical term for
this<00:01:40.710> pulley<00:01:40.950> is<00:01:41.070> I'll<00:01:41.190> call<00:01:41.370> it<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:41.520> flyback

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
this pulley is I'll call it a flyback

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.720 
this pulley is I'll call it a flyback
pulley<00:01:42.330> but<00:01:42.600> it<00:01:43.200> twists<00:01:43.800> like<00:01:43.830> this<00:01:44.280> when<00:01:44.550> it's

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:44.730 
pulley but it twists like this when it's

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:49.370 
pulley but it twists like this when it's
in<00:01:44.850> motion<00:01:45.120> and<00:01:45.600> all<00:01:45.960> that<00:01:46.200> good<00:01:46.380> stuff<00:01:48.380> but

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
in motion and all that good stuff but

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.200 
in motion and all that good stuff but
misses<00:01:49.800> an<00:01:49.920> older-style<00:01:50.340> torque<00:01:50.940> revert<00:01:51.150> I

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
misses an older-style torque revert I

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.580 
misses an older-style torque revert I
have<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:51.570> take<00:01:51.690> a<00:01:51.720> torque<00:01:52.080> converter<00:01:52.110> off<00:01:52.470> the

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
have to take a torque converter off the

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.530 
have to take a torque converter off the
other<00:01:52.740> Murray<00:01:53.010> go-cart<00:01:53.520> and<00:01:53.640> show<00:01:54.390> you<00:01:54.510> all

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
other Murray go-cart and show you all

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.210 
other Murray go-cart and show you all
one<00:01:54.750> day<00:01:54.870> guys<00:01:55.020> are<00:01:55.110> gonna<00:01:55.200> replace<00:01:55.530> a<00:01:55.590> bolt<00:01:56.040> in

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
one day guys are gonna replace a bolt in

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.650 
one day guys are gonna replace a bolt in
it<00:01:56.340> anyways<00:01:56.730> but<00:01:56.970> yeah<00:01:57.180> this<00:01:57.360> torque

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:57.660 
it anyways but yeah this torque

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.420 
it anyways but yeah this torque
converters<00:01:58.050> screwed<00:01:58.710> up<00:01:58.890> I<00:01:59.040> don't<00:01:59.190> even<00:01:59.280> think

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
converters screwed up I don't even think

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:05.840 
converters screwed up I don't even think
it's<00:01:59.760> even<00:02:00.000> movable<00:02:01.010> weird<00:02:04.670> okay<00:02:05.670> I've<00:02:05.790> seen

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
it's even movable weird okay I've seen

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.330 
it's even movable weird okay I've seen
I've<00:02:06.150> lost<00:02:06.330> my<00:02:06.540> hammer<00:02:06.840> oh<00:02:07.729> wait<00:02:08.729> here<00:02:08.970> it<00:02:09.000> is

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
yes II hear this piece here moves this

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.670 
yes II hear this piece here moves this
talk<00:02:20.150> of<00:02:20.180> murders<00:02:20.570> might<00:02:21.020> still<00:02:21.320> be<00:02:21.410> good<00:02:21.560> but

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
talk of murders might still be good but

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:27.340 
talk of murders might still be good but
see<00:02:21.890> here<00:02:22.130> it<00:02:22.250> is<00:02:22.520> piece<00:02:23.380> moves<00:02:26.050> sits<00:02:27.050> in<00:02:27.200> here

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
see here it is piece moves sits in here

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:33.910 
see here it is piece moves sits in here
like<00:02:27.560> is<00:02:31.780> these<00:02:32.780> are<00:02:32.960> friction<00:02:33.500> discs<00:02:33.770> out

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
like is these are friction discs out

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.890 
like is these are friction discs out
think<00:02:34.220> these<00:02:34.310> are<00:02:34.430> magnets<00:02:35.030> some<00:02:35.750> of<00:02:35.840> these

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
think these are magnets some of these

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.040 
think these are magnets some of these
clutches<00:02:36.170> had<00:02:36.500> magnets<00:02:37.070> and<00:02:37.340> I'm<00:02:37.430> gonna<00:02:38.050> tell

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
clutches had magnets and I'm gonna tell

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.680 
clutches had magnets and I'm gonna tell
these<00:02:39.170> are<00:02:39.230> friction<00:02:39.770> discs<00:02:40.160> okay<00:02:40.700> this<00:02:41.480> one's

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
these are friction discs okay this one's

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.210 
these are friction discs okay this one's
crack<00:02:42.050> so<00:02:42.350> this<00:02:42.560> tour<00:02:42.770> covered

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
holy someone's used as this torque

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.110 
holy someone's used as this torque
converters<00:02:45.740> obviously<00:02:46.190> shot<00:02:46.580> I'd<00:02:46.820> have<00:02:47.000> to

converters obviously shot I'd have to

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.800 
converters obviously shot I'd have to
rebuild<00:02:47.450> it<00:02:47.920> but<00:02:48.920> yeah<00:02:49.070> this<00:02:49.280> mass<00:02:49.660> bearing<00:02:50.690> oh

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
rebuild it but yeah this mass bearing oh

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.020 
rebuild it but yeah this mass bearing oh
god<00:02:51.170> some<00:02:51.500> of<00:02:51.620> them<00:02:52.610> that<00:02:52.820> key
