hamster for example hated um Katie food

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.390 
hamster for example hated um Katie food
because<00:01:28.229> I<00:01:28.500> don't<00:01:28.770> know<00:01:28.890> why<00:01:29.040> they<00:01:29.250> just

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
because I don't know why they just

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.219 
because I don't know why they just
wouldn't<00:01:29.700> eat<00:01:29.850> it<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.240> then<00:01:30.329> I<00:01:30.360> bought<00:01:30.930> them

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
wouldn't eat it and then I bought them

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.780 
wouldn't eat it and then I bought them
