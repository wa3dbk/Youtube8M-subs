00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 team match gives me the badge of 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.440
 triple low I could not put the clip 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.240
 from before because I split it in two and 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.730
 erase the previous one believing that it was 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.679
 erased but good without under a triple 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.529
 fit and how are you watching the game by 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.990
 neox the Zen friend being the host of the 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.640
 departure when he is host to me I never 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.980
 gives four clubs and I when you guys 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.140
 he never gave him four clubs but he did more 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.180
 a normal game that we started playing 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.730
 for like one of many others that we play 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:34.239
 al blanco box black ops tops 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:39.400
 and it has been the game of mourning for 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:45.400
 equipment that gives more beating I've won the 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:48.010
 We left 75 to 18 casualties, that is, one 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:50.710
 real beating and how are you seeing 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.089
 right now we go 18 2 on the scoreboard 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:56.470
 triple triple fit 

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:59.350
 there's neox and I told me look at the 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:01.300
 marker and betty 12 and has seen that the 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.610
 first time in the first death I've 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.440
 done I was at the start of the game 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.300
 I just got in there hit him a hit 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.880
 marker to the uncle who did not take the market 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:13.360
 and that just killed me then I here 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:16.000
 I already have a hype in the air that is strange to me 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.729
 that are not pulling was waiting for me 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.920
 to get me the ub sab 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:22.899
 and when you have 2 west and 2 For 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.149
 it's just retiring a little and 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:27.280
 wait for the partners to kill you 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:29.530
 is loading the bar from a couple of 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.940
 short more agile marker I did not want it 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.550
 play because I say I know I have left 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:36.689
 here little for lights like that and we 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:41.979
 I'm not going to go 33 either 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:44.560
 35 3 or is it a real beating what 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:47.679
 what happens in this game or is it a 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:50.649
 massacre in life I played myself a 

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:53.500
 starting in no duty heat that has 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:56.520
 won so easily and with so much 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:00.179
 difference whenever we play neox and I 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:03.490
 between him and me without exaggeration we do not 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:05.200
 50% wrong of the team's losses he 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.019
 It is usually done 30 casualties and I usually 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.519
 do between 20 and 30 also generally 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:11.950
 but it also depends on the day but he 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:13.870
 usually kill a little more than me but 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.329
 Between the two of us , we always do it at a minimum 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.130
 minimum minimum 50 casualties then play 

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:21.370
 with us in idle by team is 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.959
 practically insure 50 casualties because 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.299
 the man then there is the possibility of 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:26.650
 that of some failures that we 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:28.630
 let's get a bad game but 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.560
 Usually when we play that happens 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:34.770
 look 53 6 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:37.830
 my mother gilmar management that diverse and 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:40.530
 dying giving does not work the equipment 54 7 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.239
 how many games a day of mourning 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.099
 team on target 2 where they 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:46.920
 stay like this do not die no no no no no 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:49.200
 I will not fix more than death a couple 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.500
 of times and there is no need to die more 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.120
 It's a real savage I caught myself now 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.709
 the one of closing of the ground that wants that 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.080
 I had the normal look, I say good for 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.550
 if I do a double low with that of being 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.650
 then put bald list and I can 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.150
 get something to vary something combo but 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.680
 I was wearing the variable zoom lens and 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.239
 when I looked to kill the 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.690
 enemy I saw that he was from to take for 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:12.680
 ass and fail and managed to kill me the other 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.680
 have those marks 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:21.520
 so that he speaks or speaks or good 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:24.190
 guys and I wanted to show you this game 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:26.980
 because it is true that there are times that you 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:29.740
 they play a bad team but there are other 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.130
 times that the bad team goes in the 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:35.140
 another team and we're going to start 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:38.190
 very simple and brutal nothing but 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:40.720
 admire and the marker and you take out 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.970
 our conclusions for me the kill 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.710
 camps and I liked this game of 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.880
 team duel of this authentic 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:49.240
 beating 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:51.250
