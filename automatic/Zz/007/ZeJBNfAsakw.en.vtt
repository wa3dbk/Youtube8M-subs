 either at a distance, for sure 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.040
 The goal is in the rear 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.040

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.260

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:13.999
 important 

00:02:13.999 --> 00:02:15.569

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.569
 BMW strengthens 

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:22.870

 a greek wine 

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:44.690
 at the latest since 2004 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.690
 against the insight that it certainly 

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:54.619
 are also here again 

00:02:56.689 --> 00:02:59.689
 the yes-word given also run 

00:03:00.749 --> 00:03:02.899
 Russian agencies because 

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:05.559
 Pauli the euro is annualized 

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:07.439

 we are sitting here on the stage 

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:37.689
 like Galaxy anyway 

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:40.189

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:42.569
 Barrel declined 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:45.999
 This also does not disappoint individual investors 

00:03:45.999 --> 00:03:48.599
 I have not pretended to be like that 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:50.919
 it could have been received at the end of May 

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:54.749

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:07.299
 I think we have to go there 

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:10.320
 should be Amerell 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.320
 Project manager Reinhard Brandl 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.490
 that is slow to get started in the market in the first program 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.070
 a good race against both the Euro 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:36.440
 we do not have the customer's arrival because then 

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:40.550
 I am very happy what can I do for you 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.059
 Euro more than last year 

00:04:42.059 --> 00:04:45.829
 also very important mission we have to find the golden shade torpedo around 

00:04:45.829 --> 00:04:48.650
 to save a people from annihilation 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:53.070
 or why I'm talking WoW he's a particularly sophisticated one yet 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:54.129
 little 

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:57.520
 to bring in the homeowners again 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.189
 our job is not very difficult 

00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:03.440
 Bornheim must look for Sion 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.710
 the one about whom you can visit against anyone 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:09.029
 why did we come were anyway 

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:12.339
 must be present to the prevailing presentations 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.580
 Dollars from Hagen 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:20.559
 strictly prohibited and Assange violations is actually 

00:05:20.559 --> 00:05:23.830
 what the protest comes from perfection 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:28.990
 but I could be just waiting for the market to do what they want to do 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:31.479
 in her answer to her problems 

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:33.279
 that does not exist 

00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:34.669

 I believe that the nuclear power plant coach 

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:46.669
 Honda Accord type standard 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.400
 Proxy March 19 clock 

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:54.029
 the first idea was 

00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:57.029
 she likes to assimilate more 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:59.139
 Dollars off 

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:00.710
 we already know that 

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:01.669
