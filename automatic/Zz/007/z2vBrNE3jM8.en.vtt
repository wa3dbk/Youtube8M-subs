00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 hello to all guys well found by 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:07.020
 francesco siciliani the new video for 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.690
 iphoneitalia.com just installed the 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.990
 beta of what s ii 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.059
 let's find out more about this new one 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.680
 platform this new system 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.090
 operating for apple watch 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.279
 let's all find out a little 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.990
 details of the beta we start by doing a 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.660
 quick turn in the beta and then we see 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:28.130
 some focus of some functionality in 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.130
 particular let's start right away 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:44.949
 then I installed my beta like 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:46.720
 see at first glance there are already 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:49.180
 of the things we can notice of 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.129
 difference for example here we have one 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.079
 possibility to use the play 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:55.839
 so we already notice a lot 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:57.579
 interesting new then oh well here are 

00:00:55.839 --> 00:01:02.260
 the classic controls we already had 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:05.729
 here is a new new glance 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:09.070
 already pre-installed that I didn't know in short 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.679
 I'm not the first one right now 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:14.229
 still loaded then we'll find out better 

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:16.060
 let's go to the bar on the menu let's say 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:18.070
 general we hope we come to the le 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.520
 icons remain more or less the same there 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:23.610
 there is wallet here already active should 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.789
 be able to respond 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.270
 to mail directly from the client 

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:31.229
 official 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:36.210
 we see only a second then maybe 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:38.710
 we prepare a focus we do ad hoc 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.170
 also unlock my iphone in the case 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.490
 should serve to speed up the 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.420
 method 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:48.369
 let's see some to install the beta on 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.070
 apple watch you need to install 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:52.840
 also the beta of ios 9 on iphone and then 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.820
 install a configuration profile 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:58.540
 superpole watch that will allow us to 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:00.810
 go just to choose to do 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.810
 update 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.009
 we hope he has already in the meantime 

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:07.869
 loaded all the necessary data to the 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:12.100
 moment still nothing shall we continue 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:13.840
 with the say on this tour 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.620
 let's try with the kick force to go 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.360
 in 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.700
 watch face should be there 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:22.629
 possibility to add a watch face 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.150
 with a background from what I see then 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:26.110
 first here we have a time lapse 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.840
 so we have the possibility of 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.090
 choose this thing new face entry 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.900
 very very pretty we can also 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:37.959
 customize with various types of 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.879
 locations there are no other possibilities 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:42.250
 no we only have this how 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:44.650
 customization then there should be 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:47.379
 the possibility of going to add 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:50.829
 also a custom background 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:53.440
 in fact needle us here photo album from here 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:55.329
 we can then go and choose the album 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.930
 photographic I think we should choose 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:03:01.090
 from iphone the one to go to use 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:05.109
 then on apple os i think it is from 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:07.900
 apple watch application that you do 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:09.090
 can do this thing here because al 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.849
 moment not 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:14.910
 does not give me any photographs here 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:16.920
 below we try to rehabilitate it 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.110
 so we at this moment nothing then 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.930
 I think it's something you can do 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:24.690
 directly from the man 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:27.480
 in short, from the application of apple 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:30.060
 watch or from the application of 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.549
 photos in short now I do not know but not 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.830
 I saw it again, let's go and see for a while 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:37.319
 best for this functionality 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:41.489
 we continue this quick tour in the 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:44.190
 ios novelties of watch two then of 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:45.870
 this new system was called le le 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.750
 face voices are almost always the same 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:52.260
 except these two additions let's move on 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:54.599
 still then we see some 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.280
 does not change very general 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:58.739
 of the interface also because at the moment 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.569
 there are no complications made by 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:03.599
 developers because the has just been released 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:07.680
 beta are not there yet 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:09.870
 not even the new native apps then 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.849
 at the moment it is a bit difficult to go to 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.500
 see all the potential of this 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:14.190
 system however here for example we have a 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.729
 layout 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:19.650
 already the possibility of choosing to 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:21.419
 add contacts manually from here 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.960
 that go to create groups of 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:26.520
 therefore contacts are already rather things 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:29.460
 interesting at the center level 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.320
 notifications practically nothing changes 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:35.100
 let's see if there are any 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:38.190
 active life or workout 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:41.910
 let's see some stability is a little more 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:42.930
 functional naha lenses compared to 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.129
 official version 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.529
 in conclusion 

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:47.719
 obviously there are some little ones 

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:51.539
 small bugs 

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:54.569
 at the moment he doesn't give me any with 

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:56.699
 edit let's try now to see the beauty 

00:04:54.569 --> 00:04:59.189
 music then you will also have to adapt to 

00:04:56.699 --> 00:05:01.080
 apple music so it will work will work 

00:04:59.189 --> 00:05:03.119
 better with the release of apple music 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.669
 we wait here for the right emails for 

00:05:03.119 --> 00:05:07.110
 take a look at one of the things 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:07.860
 most important things for the answer 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.639
 of the mails 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:14.489
 certainly with regards to the 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:17.519
 answer via iphone there will be 

00:05:14.489 --> 00:05:19.830
 very simple and intuitive options 

00:05:17.519 --> 00:05:21.360
 I was certainly saying about it 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:24.990
 instead the possibility to use 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:26.459
 better all the sensors to use the 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:27.869
 short microphone for the various 

00:05:26.459 --> 00:05:30.029
 applications that will be things that 

00:05:27.869 --> 00:05:32.699
 we will see as they come out 

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:35.300
 native applications with the apple sdk 

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:39.719
 at the moment the news is rather 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:41.729
 limited to on apple watch with watch v s 

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:43.979
 ii why we tell the truth right now 

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:45.809
 there are only very few news already 

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:48.539
 integrated so everything else is a 

00:05:45.809 --> 00:05:49.559
 support that can arrive later for the 

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:50.969
 developers 

00:05:49.559 --> 00:05:55.259
 I thank you for seeing this 

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:57.599
 little taste of what s2c we meet again 

00:05:55.259 --> 00:05:59.969
 for the next two focuses or sixth or 

00:05:57.599 --> 00:06:02.490
 also something more interesting from 

00:05:59.969 --> 00:06:04.349
 show them and nothing then us there 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:08.059
 let's review the next videos from francesco 

00:06:04.349 --> 00:06:08.059
 Sicilian is all to you soon
