mila kunis is a Russian immigrant of
sorts<00:01:05.820> I<00:01:05.909> guess<00:01:05.939> she's<00:01:06.270> come<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:06.869> Chicago<00:01:07.530> and

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
sorts I guess she's come to Chicago and

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.359 
sorts I guess she's come to Chicago and
she<00:01:08.640> is<00:01:08.939> I<00:01:09.409> guess<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.439> human<00:01:10.890> race<00:01:11.070> is

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
she is I guess the human race is

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.740 
she is I guess the human race is
descending<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.240> this<00:01:12.600> sci-fi<00:01:12.869> dystopia<00:01:13.710> and

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
descending and this sci-fi dystopia and

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.090 
descending and this sci-fi dystopia and
Channing<00:01:15.750> Tatum<00:01:16.080> has<00:01:16.110> come<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.680> save<00:01:16.890> her

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
Channing Tatum has come to save her

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.350 
Channing Tatum has come to save her
because<00:01:17.220> her<00:01:17.580> life<00:01:17.850> is<00:01:18.060> in<00:01:18.090> danger

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
because her life is in danger

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.280 
because her life is in danger
unbeknownst<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.259> her

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.920 

so<00:01:22.860> I<00:01:23.130> guess<00:01:23.310> she<00:01:23.430> gets<00:01:23.580> kidnapped<00:01:23.790> here<00:01:24.270> by

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
so I guess she gets kidnapped here by

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.410 
so I guess she gets kidnapped here by
some<00:01:25.110> scientists<00:01:25.860> they<00:01:26.730> have<00:01:26.910> to<00:01:27.030> confirm

00:04:32.559 --> 00:04:32.569 
atlas was hit or miss for me because it

00:04:32.569 --> 00:04:35.290 
atlas was hit or miss for me because it
was<00:04:32.599> so<00:04:33.349> much<00:04:33.530> of<00:04:33.710> a<00:04:33.860> just<00:04:34.310> a<00:04:34.490> jumbling<00:04:35.060> of

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
was so much of a just a jumbling of

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.320 
was so much of a just a jumbling of
genres<00:04:36.080> and<00:04:36.349> moods<00:04:36.680> but<00:04:37.400> i<00:04:37.430> think<00:04:37.759> this<00:04:37.909> you

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330 
genres and moods but i think this you

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.059 
genres and moods but i think this you
know<00:04:38.449> they're<00:04:38.659> sticking<00:04:39.050> to<00:04:39.139> one<00:04:39.500> thing<00:04:39.770> and<00:04:40.009> i

00:04:40.059 --> 00:04:40.069 
know they're sticking to one thing and i

00:04:40.069 --> 00:04:41.230 
know they're sticking to one thing and i
think<00:04:40.310> it's<00:04:40.430> what<00:04:40.580> they<00:04:40.669> do<00:04:40.789> best<00:04:40.970> and<00:04:41.180> that's

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
think it's what they do best and that's

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.180 
think it's what they do best and that's
sci-fi<00:04:41.780> so<00:04:42.500> what'd<00:04:42.620> you<00:04:42.650> think<00:04:42.710> of<00:04:42.860> the<00:04:42.919> trail

movie<00:04:45.590> is<00:04:45.740> i<00:04:45.889> think<00:04:46.069> it's<00:04:46.310> very<00:04:46.400> for<00:04:46.699> me<00:04:46.759> it's

00:04:46.899 --> 00:04:46.909 
movie is i think it's very for me it's

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:48.550 
movie is i think it's very for me it's
very<00:04:46.940> vague<00:04:47.300> what<00:04:47.479> the<00:04:47.599> plot<00:04:47.750> is<00:04:47.930> absolutely

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 
very vague what the plot is absolutely

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:49.689 
very vague what the plot is absolutely
