 in the cycling note that for the first time will run in the Peruvian highlands 

00:00:10.689 --> 00:00:13.280
 miguelón invests resources 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.430
 make a proposed sidewalk sport 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:18.800
 over the top 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.380
 Peru will seek to write its name in the Guinness Book of Records with the 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.760
 called the first international note of the alpaca 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:30.279
 that will bring together cyclists from all over the country 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:34.860
 and from bolivia chile and argentina so far shows teams time to give 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.940
 dissemination to your presentation of the national performances and guest guides 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.410
 but those who have confirmed their participation are 41 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.070
 g moscow 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.480
 chimbote 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.510
 an expensive team 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.950
 and after culiacán and arequipa that some equipment has appeared 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.220
 Inca are the ways to avoid foreign age 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.540
 There are two teams from Bolivia 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.290
 one from chile and the team from argentina is about to confirm 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.980
 lilita we have waited for more Peruvian team in this regard 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.720
 he will surely happen in the seven days 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.190
 well this is still the operation was not a Juarez who played 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.100
 him but we always decide 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.680
 ivana 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.680
 find to go to the website 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.750
 the new one directly marinates the operation thanks to the initiative of the 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.750
 right-wing private company 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:34.060
 this test will be held the highest in the world at 4 thousand 873 meters above 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.210
 sea ​​level 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.420
 you have the ticket this fight by stages is 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.350
 from cumulated time bush to the winner of the test 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.190
 despite the fact that at the end of the four stages 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.170
 have less time 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.170
 but apart each each stage can have a winner 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.530
 that will not necessarily be the real final test 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.040
 for this type of tests 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.880
 a preparation is required 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.010
 and of great physical strength 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.880
 not everyone dares to take on this challenge 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.289
 it is extremely hard many for the type of competition 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:14.009
 p that stage and I left from 3900 

00:02:15.249 --> 00:02:17.249
 this increase is from juliaca 

00:02:17.249 --> 00:02:20.249
 and it will reach a high point of 4 9800 

00:02:21.149 --> 00:02:26.809
 of 87 meters and then descend 4500 which is more or less what it is to chop the 

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:29.189
 de macusani's sales 

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:33.659
 with 180 kilometers of route is a very hard stage not 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:38.549
 and that requires people who are very prepared and who and always avoiding 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:43.049
 sport and I think that in that sense there is an advantage of 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:47.559
 teams that actually practice sports in town skip their record 

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:52.139
 culiacán the same all teams of arequipa Tamil per day vs if it is 

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:54.719
 true we are two thousand 300 meters common 

00:02:54.719 --> 00:02:56.309
 the sea level peru 

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:58.169
 They are permanently 

00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:01.090
 participating in missions where the explosion 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:02.949
 also at 4000 no 

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:04.769
 its about 4 thousand meters 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:06.879
 nine thousand soles in prizes 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:12.150
 will be the greatest motivation besides being for posterity 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.299
 feat in the Guinness Book of World Records 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:17.340
 I see a cut will come out 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.350
 as the world's highest ride average cyclist 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:25.639
 they arrived very well if they plan the wing 

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:30.400
 they organize it and the correct one I hope they will help us but if it does not reach 

00:03:30.399 --> 00:03:35.879
 organized mestalla and of pylon ballast stage are 4 thousand and pico meters of 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:38.109
 average height of the cereso no 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:39.249
 it will not have 

00:03:39.249 --> 00:03:43.400
 of another other branch object being the record is the route 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.349
 of the alpaca 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:48.300
 organized by the uni equipazo cycling union 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.839
 because they are the names of those who develop 

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:56.319
 ran the lap plus it is given to the highest in the world at a level of 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:59.799
 average of 4 thousand meters I see that Isabel travel yes 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:04.339
 the route will consist of four stages and cross to juliaca 

00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:05.269
 pucará 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:08.529
 macusani allariz and azángaro 

00:04:08.529 --> 00:04:12.040
 so you can not miss this opportunity 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.409
 and when entering your favorite cyclists I will wait for the 

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:20.090
 that the alpaca route will soon reach your city 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.090
 in your costs 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.509
 November 25 as closing date 

00:04:30.509 --> 00:04:31.340
 adored 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:37.380
 In other words, to be around that to resort to an average of 164 kilometers 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.980
 that a judgment court of course p 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:44.559
 is very important for the iphone and the ipod also imposed itself I understood 

00:04:44.559 --> 00:04:49.629
 is our country that is humanly important as we did at the beginning of the 

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:52.529
 sport and tourism program 

00:04:52.529 --> 00:04:57.359

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:18.500
 tintin 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:24.740
 diego salgado very special as still in this hamlet of montalvo action by 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.839
 outside and is much more accurate 

00:05:27.839 --> 00:05:30.889
 we are not in a hurry we find ourselves animal skin 

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:37.909
