finger in right here and that way you

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.050 
finger in right here and that way you
see<00:00:41.820> how<00:00:41.880> it<00:00:41.940> creates<00:00:42.090> some<00:00:42.360> space<00:00:42.480> and<00:00:43.020> so<00:00:44.060> go

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:45.060 
see how it creates some space and so go

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:46.760 
see how it creates some space and so go
ahead<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.270> throw<00:00:45.450> that<00:00:45.660> thing<00:00:45.690> in<00:00:45.990> then<00:00:46.470> give

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.420 
and I can actually take both hands here
you<00:01:06.720> can<00:01:06.900> spread<00:01:07.170> it<00:01:07.320> just<00:01:07.500> like<00:01:07.680> so<00:01:07.710> you<00:01:08.190> want

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
you can spread it just like so you want

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.020 
you can spread it just like so you want
to<00:01:08.520> get<00:01:08.760> it<00:01:08.880> spread<00:01:09.330> to<00:01:09.409> you<00:01:10.409> know<00:01:10.670> the<00:01:11.670> the

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
to get it spread to you know the the

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.969 
to get it spread to you know the the
size<00:01:12.360> of<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.750> rap<00:01:12.960> you<00:01:13.170> want<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.470> do<00:01:13.590> and<00:01:13.800> then

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
size of the rap you want to do and then

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.310 
size of the rap you want to do and then
you<00:01:14.190> go<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.790> length<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.270> so<00:01:15.600> since<00:01:16.229> this

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
you go to the length and so since this

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.620 
you go to the length and so since this
is<00:01:16.500> still<00:01:16.619> really<00:01:17.130> loose<00:01:17.340> in<00:01:17.580> here<00:01:17.760> if<00:01:18.240> I<00:01:18.360> want

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
is still really loose in here if I want

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.770 
is still really loose in here if I want
longer<00:01:18.990> I<00:01:19.380> can<00:01:19.800> just<00:01:20.010> touch<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:21.270> bottom<00:01:21.600> end

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
longer I can just touch the bottom end

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.540 
longer I can just touch the bottom end
with<00:01:21.900> this<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.350> it'll<00:01:22.590> it'll<00:01:22.800> go<00:01:23.040> out<00:01:23.070> further

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:23.550 
with this and it'll it'll go out further

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:29.930 
with this and it'll it'll go out further
just<00:01:24.150> like<00:01:24.330> so<00:01:25.580> okay<00:01:27.110> this<00:01:28.110> is<00:01:28.259> really<00:01:28.790> can<00:01:29.790> be

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 
just like so okay this is really can be

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.890 
just like so okay this is really can be
a<00:01:29.970> very<00:01:30.240> delicate<00:01:30.900> process<00:01:31.940> okay<00:01:32.940> and<00:01:33.119> so<00:01:33.330> and

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
a very delicate process okay and so and

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.390 
a very delicate process okay and so and
that's<00:01:34.050> probably<00:01:34.500> about<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.830> length<00:01:35.040> I<00:01:35.190> want

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
that's probably about the length I want

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.770 
that's probably about the length I want
right<00:01:35.640> there<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:36.060> so<00:01:36.180> you<00:01:36.240> see<00:01:36.450> how<00:01:36.509> you<00:01:36.570> have

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780
