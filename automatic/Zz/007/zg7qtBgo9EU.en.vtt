00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
to image resize and you can bring it

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.130 
to image resize and you can bring it
down<00:00:18.600> to<00:00:19.310> if<00:00:20.310> you<00:00:20.460> add<00:00:20.550> 512<00:00:21.119> by<00:00:21.240> 512<00:00:21.449> sword<00:00:22.080> you

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
know how to explain this like if it's 64

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.479 
know how to explain this like if it's 64
by<00:00:42.450> 64<00:00:42.480> you<00:00:43.290> would<00:00:43.379> have<00:00:43.559> to<00:00:43.710> downscale<00:00:44.070> it<00:00:44.309> to

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
by 64 you would have to downscale it to

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.420 
by 64 you would have to downscale it to
32<00:00:45.239> by<00:00:45.450> 32<00:00:45.750> 16<00:00:46.469> by<00:00:46.559> 16<00:00:46.620> or<00:00:47.100> 8<00:00:47.309> by<00:00:47.460> 8<00:00:48.559> so<00:00:49.559> let's<00:00:49.920> say

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
32 by 32 16 by 16 or 8 by 8 so let's say

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.310 
32 by 32 16 by 16 or 8 by 8 so let's say
this<00:00:50.670> one's<00:00:50.850> 5<00:00:51.000> 4<00:00:51.180> by<00:00:51.270> 5<00:00:51.420> 12<00:00:51.690> I<00:00:51.840> can<00:00:51.989> change<00:00:52.199> this

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
this one's 5 4 by 5 12 I can change this

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.360 
this one's 5 4 by 5 12 I can change this
to<00:00:52.530> 1<00:00:53.039> 20<00:00:53.250> at<00:00:53.460> that<00:00:53.579> 128

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.480 

um<00:00:58.790> sorry<00:00:59.780> I<00:00:59.900> just<00:01:00.080> kind<00:01:00.320> of<00:01:00.410> I<00:01:00.950> got<00:01:01.220> a<00:01:01.280> message

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:03.980 
so you can change it out to 128 by 128

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.260 
so you can change it out to 128 by 128
and<00:01:04.580> it'll<00:01:05.089> be<00:01:05.239> down<00:01:05.780> scaled<00:01:06.260> to<00:01:06.650> that<00:01:06.860> and<00:01:07.270> you

below it which is 256 if you have a 512

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.400 
below it which is 256 if you have a 512
and<00:01:14.510> it<00:01:14.600> looks<00:01:14.750> perfectly<00:01:15.080> fine<00:01:15.729> now<00:01:16.729> for<00:01:17.410> the

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
glow effect I'm going to be doing a an

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.560 
glow effect I'm going to be doing a an
example<00:01:25.130> of<00:01:25.220> like<00:01:25.369> a<00:01:25.490> water<00:01:25.850> known<00:01:26.119> sword<00:01:26.479> I

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
example of like a water known sword I

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.690

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819 
the original color and to make this look

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:46.000 
the original color and to make this look
a<00:02:43.940> little<00:02:44.060> better<00:02:44.270> I<00:02:44.690> usually<00:02:45.230> put<00:02:45.440> my<00:02:45.470> radius

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
a little better I usually put my radius

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.970 
a little better I usually put my radius
a<00:02:46.250> little<00:02:46.280> bit<00:02:46.640> up<00:02:46.819> to<00:02:47.090> about<00:02:47.330> 15<00:02:47.930> your<00:02:48.680> brain

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
a little bit up to about 15 your brain

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:54.640 
a little bit up to about 15 your brain
knows<00:02:49.420> about<00:02:50.420> negative<00:02:51.050> 7<00:02:51.980> maybe<00:02:53.200> negative<00:02:54.200> 7

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
knows about negative 7 maybe negative 7

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.880 
knows about negative 7 maybe negative 7
to<00:02:54.770> 5<00:02:54.980> looks<00:02:55.370> okay<00:02:55.880> input<00:02:56.420> 9<00:02:56.540> to<00:02:56.660> 5<00:02:56.840> and<00:02:57.770> then

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
to 5 looks okay input 9 to 5 and then

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.370 
to 5 looks okay input 9 to 5 and then
for<00:02:58.069> your<00:02:58.160> contrast<00:02:58.750> you're<00:02:59.750> gonna<00:02:59.870> want<00:03:00.170> this

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
for your contrast you're gonna want this

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:01.590 
for your contrast you're gonna want this
about<00:03:00.770> 25

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
about 25

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.390 
about 25
or<00:03:01.780> more<00:03:01.990> or<00:03:02.800> 25<00:03:03.490> yeah<00:03:04.090> 25<00:03:04.570> or<00:03:04.870> more<00:03:05.280> the<00:03:06.280> higher

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
or more or 25 yeah 25 or more the higher

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.790 
or more or 25 yeah 25 or more the higher
you<00:03:06.580> got<00:03:06.760> the<00:03:07.090> less<00:03:07.270> you<00:03:07.660> get<00:03:07.870> so<00:03:08.380> I'm<00:03:08.620> gonna

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:08.800 
you got the less you get so I'm gonna

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.940 
you got the less you get so I'm gonna
put<00:03:08.920> mine<00:03:09.040> on<00:03:09.070> 25<00:03:09.670> and<00:03:10.320> as<00:03:11.320> you<00:03:11.500> can<00:03:11.590> see<00:03:11.740> it

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
put mine on 25 and as you can see it

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.690 
put mine on 25 and as you can see it
really<00:03:12.310> makes<00:03:12.550> like<00:03:13.360> this<00:03:13.660> part<00:03:13.990> pop<00:03:14.320> out<00:03:14.700> but

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
really makes like this part pop out but

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.670 
really makes like this part pop out but
for<00:03:15.910> the<00:03:16.000> darker<00:03:16.330> colors<00:03:16.630> such<00:03:16.840> as<00:03:17.050> this<00:03:17.350> it

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
for the darker colors such as this it

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.820 
for the darker colors such as this it
doesn't<00:03:17.980> do<00:03:18.250> it<00:03:18.400> as<00:03:18.520> much<00:03:18.760> because<00:03:19.000> it's<00:03:19.830> you

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 
doesn't do it as much because it's you

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:22.410 
doesn't do it as much because it's you
know<00:03:20.890> darker<00:03:21.460> colors<00:03:21.790> it<00:03:22.000> doesn't<00:03:22.300> really

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
know darker colors it doesn't really

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.390 
know darker colors it doesn't really
work<00:03:22.660> well<00:03:22.960> like<00:03:23.200> I<00:03:23.590> don't<00:03:23.650> know<00:03:24.100> if<00:03:24.220> you<00:03:24.280> can

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
work well like I don't know if you can

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.520 
work well like I don't know if you can
do<00:03:24.520> this<00:03:24.670> with<00:03:24.820> any<00:03:25.060> other<00:03:25.230> color<00:03:26.230> than<00:03:26.500> black

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
do this with any other color than black

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.260 
do this with any other color than black
I<00:03:26.980> haven't<00:03:27.250> really<00:03:27.430> played<00:03:27.760> with<00:03:28.000> it<00:03:28.150> that

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:28.270 
I haven't really played with it that

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:31.290 
I haven't really played with it that
much<00:03:28.980> simply<00:03:29.980> for<00:03:30.130> the<00:03:30.190> fact<00:03:30.310> I<00:03:30.490> only<00:03:30.640> use<00:03:30.940> glow

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:31.300 
much simply for the fact I only use glow

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.070 
much simply for the fact I only use glow
to<00:03:31.360> make<00:03:31.750> my<00:03:32.410> skies<00:03:32.770> brighter<00:03:33.480> but<00:03:34.480> as<00:03:34.780> you<00:03:35.020> can

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
to make my skies brighter but as you can

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.050 
to make my skies brighter but as you can
see<00:03:35.140> for<00:03:35.710> the<00:03:35.800> lighter<00:03:36.010> colors<00:03:36.340> it<00:03:36.550> does<00:03:36.580> work

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
see for the lighter colors it does work

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.560 
see for the lighter colors it does work
better<00:03:37.360> like<00:03:37.690> up<00:03:38.050> here<00:03:39.060> but<00:03:40.060> for<00:03:40.240> darker

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 
better like up here but for darker

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:43.830 
better like up here but for darker
colors<00:03:40.840> again<00:03:41.140> it<00:03:41.320> looks<00:03:41.440> pretty<00:03:41.590> bad<00:03:42.720> and<00:03:43.720> you

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840
