all<00:00:06.670> right<00:00:06.759> so<00:00:06.940> here<00:00:07.120> we<00:00:07.150> have<00:00:07.450> a<00:00:08.019> selection

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:08.620 
all right so here we have a selection

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.150 
all right so here we have a selection
edgy<00:00:09.190> tools<00:00:09.490> for<00:00:10.150> the<00:00:10.240> 5<00:00:10.480> 5s<00:00:11.110> and<00:00:11.410> the<00:00:11.440> iPad<00:00:11.770> 2<00:00:11.950> 3

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:12.160 
edgy tools for the 5 5s and the iPad 2 3

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.549 
edgy tools for the 5 5s and the iPad 2 3
and<00:00:12.280> 4<00:00:12.490> there's<00:00:13.389> also<00:00:13.540> a<00:00:13.690> corner<00:00:14.049> tool<00:00:14.260> for<00:00:14.500> the

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:14.559 
and 4 there's also a corner tool for the

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:16.380 
and 4 there's also a corner tool for the
iPad<00:00:14.889> Mini<00:00:15.190> and<00:00:15.400> air<00:00:15.730> they're

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:16.390 
iPad Mini and air they're

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.350 
iPad Mini and air they're
interchangeable<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:17.890> corner<00:00:18.160> tool<00:00:18.340> is<00:00:18.550> it's

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:19.360 
interchangeable the corner tool is it's

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.030 
interchangeable the corner tool is it's
not<00:00:19.540> here<00:00:19.810> on<00:00:19.930> the<00:00:20.020> table<00:00:20.200> but<00:00:20.590> it<00:00:20.770> works<00:00:20.950> the

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:21.040 
not here on the table but it works the

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.189 
not here on the table but it works the
same<00:00:21.130> as<00:00:21.310> these<00:00:21.550> and<00:00:21.880> so<00:00:22.600> what<00:00:22.930> we<00:00:23.020> have<00:00:23.170> here

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:23.199 
same as these and so what we have here

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:26.279 
same as these and so what we have here
is<00:00:23.590> first<00:00:24.010> this<00:00:24.220> is<00:00:24.279> going<00:00:24.460> to<00:00:24.640> be<00:00:24.789> the<00:00:25.180> 5<00:00:25.990> and

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:26.289 
is first this is going to be the 5 and

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:29.130 
is first this is going to be the 5 and
5s<00:00:26.590> edge<00:00:27.010> tool<00:00:27.430> and<00:00:27.699> so<00:00:28.480> the<00:00:28.570> way<00:00:28.689> that<00:00:28.720> this

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:29.140 
5s edge tool and so the way that this

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.200 
5s edge tool and so the way that this
works<00:00:29.619> is<00:00:29.920> that<00:00:30.550> it's<00:00:30.670> a<00:00:30.730> very<00:00:30.910> simple

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:31.210 
works is that it's a very simple

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.840 
works is that it's a very simple
clamping<00:00:31.720> mechanism<00:00:32.220> that's<00:00:33.220> going<00:00:33.400> to<00:00:33.460> drive

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:33.850 
clamping mechanism that's going to drive

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.869 
clamping mechanism that's going to drive
this<00:00:34.540> rear<00:00:34.840> part<00:00:35.199> into<00:00:35.769> the<00:00:36.220> actual<00:00:36.550> chrome

00:00:36.869 --> 00:00:36.879 
this rear part into the actual chrome

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:39.719 
this rear part into the actual chrome
portion<00:00:37.330> that<00:00:37.510> you<00:00:37.690> see<00:00:37.900> and<00:00:38.110> so<00:00:38.920> what<00:00:39.309> what

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:39.729 
portion that you see and so what what

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:41.219 
portion that you see and so what what
works<00:00:39.970> here<00:00:40.210> is<00:00:40.360> that<00:00:40.600> when<00:00:40.780> you<00:00:40.809> take<00:00:41.049> the

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:41.229 
works here is that when you take the

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:42.899 
works here is that when you take the
screen<00:00:41.530> off<00:00:41.680> of<00:00:41.890> the<00:00:42.040> iPhone<00:00:42.430> it's<00:00:42.610> actually

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:42.909 
screen off of the iPhone it's actually

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:45.240 
screen off of the iPhone it's actually
going<00:00:43.030> to<00:00:43.120> set<00:00:43.299> in<00:00:43.449> like<00:00:43.629> this<00:00:43.900> and<00:00:44.229> so<00:00:45.190> it

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.250 
going to set in like this and so it

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:46.710 
going to set in like this and so it
helps<00:00:45.549> great<00:00:45.760> not<00:00:45.940> the<00:00:46.089> edges<00:00:46.420> you<00:00:46.570> would

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:46.720 
helps great not the edges you would

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.020 
helps great not the edges you would
simply<00:00:46.900> tighten<00:00:47.350> it<00:00:47.440> down<00:00:47.470> and<00:00:47.830> then<00:00:47.920> work<00:00:48.850> it

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.030 
simply tighten it down and then work it

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.119 
simply tighten it down and then work it
and<00:00:49.210> then<00:00:49.540> work<00:00:49.870> your<00:00:50.019> way<00:00:50.110> down<00:00:50.140> across<00:00:50.860> the

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:51.129 
and then work your way down across the

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:54.750 
and then work your way down across the
edges<00:00:51.960> all<00:00:52.960> the<00:00:53.019> way<00:00:53.379> around<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:54.489> the<00:00:54.580> goal

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.760 
edges all the way around and the goal

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.460 
edges all the way around and the goal
here<00:00:54.790> is<00:00:55.059> to<00:00:55.210> get<00:00:55.479> the<00:00:55.690> edges<00:00:56.080> toward<00:00:56.409> the

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:56.470 
here is to get the edges toward the

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:57.810 
here is to get the edges toward the
glass<00:00:56.739> can<00:00:56.979> seat<00:00:57.190> down<00:00:57.369> into<00:00:57.670> them

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:57.820 
glass can seat down into them

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:58.609 
glass can seat down into them
appropriately

00:00:58.609 --> 00:00:58.619 
appropriately

00:00:58.619 --> 00:01:00.960 
appropriately
the<00:00:59.619> next<00:00:59.830> one<00:00:59.979> that<00:01:00.159> we<00:01:00.250> have<00:01:00.400> here<00:01:00.729> is<00:01:00.879> going

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:00.970 
the next one that we have here is going

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.030 
the next one that we have here is going
to<00:01:01.119> be<00:01:01.330> the<00:01:01.869> corner<00:01:02.260> tool<00:01:02.440> for<00:01:02.710> the<00:01:02.799> same

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:03.040 
to be the corner tool for the same

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.789 
to be the corner tool for the same
iPhone<00:01:03.460> 5<00:01:03.760> 5<00:01:04.059> s<00:01:04.119> so<00:01:05.110> that<00:01:05.140> it<00:01:05.500> would<00:01:05.619> work<00:01:05.740> the

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:05.799 
iPhone 5 5 s so that it would work the

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:07.890 
iPhone 5 5 s so that it would work the
same<00:01:05.920> it<00:01:06.220> would<00:01:06.310> just<00:01:06.520> go<00:01:06.640> like<00:01:06.670> this<00:01:07.030> and<00:01:07.330> then

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:07.900 
same it would just go like this and then

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.570 
same it would just go like this and then
you<00:01:08.049> would<00:01:08.140> tighten<00:01:08.350> it<00:01:08.560> down<00:01:08.590> and<00:01:08.770> use<00:01:09.220> that

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.580 
you would tighten it down and use that

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.290 
you would tighten it down and use that
to<00:01:10.330> help<00:01:10.479> to<00:01:10.690> reshape<00:01:11.200> the<00:01:11.680> full<00:01:12.580> sides<00:01:12.940> all

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:13.300 
to help to reshape the full sides all

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.750 
to help to reshape the full sides all
the<00:01:13.360> way<00:01:13.630> around<00:01:13.930> the<00:01:14.050> iPhone<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:15.310> goal<00:01:15.490> here

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:15.760 
the way around the iPhone the goal here

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.910 
the way around the iPhone the goal here
is<00:01:15.790> to<00:01:16.090> bring<00:01:16.210> this<00:01:16.420> back<00:01:16.780> into<00:01:17.080> spec<00:01:17.500> so<00:01:17.800> that

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
is to bring this back into spec so that

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.380 
is to bring this back into spec so that
when<00:01:18.070> you<00:01:18.160> install<00:01:18.580> a<00:01:18.610> new<00:01:18.760> piece<00:01:19.060> of<00:01:19.090> glass

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
when you install a new piece of glass

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.410 
when you install a new piece of glass
it'll<00:01:20.350> just<00:01:20.650> lay<00:01:20.830> it<00:01:20.950> right<00:01:20.980> down<00:01:21.280> into<00:01:21.490> it<00:01:21.670> any

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
it'll just lay it right down into it any

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.450 
it'll just lay it right down into it any
part<00:01:23.050> of<00:01:23.140> the<00:01:23.200> reshaping<00:01:23.590> or<00:01:23.860> anything<00:01:24.070> won't

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
part of the reshaping or anything won't

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.190 
part of the reshaping or anything won't
be<00:01:24.550> causing<00:01:24.910> that<00:01:25.030> glass<00:01:25.330> to<00:01:25.570> lift<00:01:25.810> back<00:01:25.960> up

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
be causing that glass to lift back up

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.480 
be causing that glass to lift back up
it's<00:01:26.560> not<00:01:26.680> going<00:01:26.830> to<00:01:26.920> be<00:01:27.010> giving<00:01:27.250> you<00:01:27.370> any

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
it's not going to be giving you any

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.820 
it's not going to be giving you any
trouble<00:01:27.610> it<00:01:28.480> should<00:01:28.750> set<00:01:28.990> in<00:01:29.140> perfectly

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 
trouble it should set in perfectly

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.130 
trouble it should set in perfectly
because<00:01:30.550> these<00:01:30.880> are<00:01:31.090> after<00:01:31.300> all<00:01:31.540> precision

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
because these are after all precision

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:33.600 
because these are after all precision
great<00:01:32.440> tools<00:01:32.800> they're<00:01:33.130> going<00:01:33.280> to<00:01:33.340> bring<00:01:33.490> it

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610 
great tools they're going to bring it

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.480 
great tools they're going to bring it
exactly<00:01:34.210> back<00:01:34.420> to<00:01:34.660> how<00:01:34.750> it<00:01:34.930> should<00:01:35.200> be<00:01:35.380> and<00:01:36.310> so

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
exactly back to how it should be and so

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:37.620 
exactly back to how it should be and so
that's<00:01:36.700> how<00:01:36.850> it's<00:01:37.030> going<00:01:37.120> to<00:01:37.180> work<00:01:37.300> on<00:01:37.450> the

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
that's how it's going to work on the

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:44.100 
that's how it's going to work on the
iPhone<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:43.090> iPad<00:01:43.420> is<00:01:43.600> a<00:01:43.630> little<00:01:43.990> bit

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
iPhone the iPad is a little bit

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.980 
iPhone the iPad is a little bit
different<00:01:44.500> but<00:01:44.710> largely<00:01:45.130> the<00:01:46.030> same<00:01:46.270> concept

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
different but largely the same concept

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.870 
different but largely the same concept
and<00:01:47.260> so<00:01:47.800> what<00:01:47.920> you'll<00:01:48.070> see<00:01:48.130> here<00:01:48.490> is<00:01:48.580> this<00:01:48.700> is

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
and so what you'll see here is this is

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.250 
and so what you'll see here is this is
an<00:01:49.000> iPad<00:01:49.390> edge<00:01:49.659> tool<00:01:50.110> for<00:01:50.440> the<00:01:50.530> iPad<00:01:51.220> 2<00:01:51.460> 3<00:01:51.760> and<00:01:51.909> 4

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:52.260 
an iPad edge tool for the iPad 2 3 and 4

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.780 
an iPad edge tool for the iPad 2 3 and 4
you<00:01:53.260> can<00:01:53.380> see<00:01:53.440> it's<00:01:53.710> got<00:01:53.890> this<00:01:54.040> lip<00:01:54.370> that<00:01:54.550> comes

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:54.790 
you can see it's got this lip that comes

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.450 
you can see it's got this lip that comes
out<00:01:54.940> on<00:01:55.090> the<00:01:55.210> bottom<00:01:55.510> the<00:01:56.320> purpose<00:01:56.710> of<00:01:56.860> that<00:01:56.890> is

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
out on the bottom the purpose of that is

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.180 
out on the bottom the purpose of that is
so<00:01:58.150> that<00:01:58.180> this<00:01:58.659> actual<00:01:59.260> device<00:01:59.560> can<00:01:59.800> be<00:01:59.890> seated

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:00.190 
so that this actual device can be seated

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.760 
so that this actual device can be seated
on<00:02:00.430> to<00:02:00.670> the<00:02:00.760> iPad<00:02:01.150> like<00:02:01.330> so<00:02:01.630> and<00:02:01.900> you'll<00:02:02.590> see

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
on to the iPad like so and you'll see

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.170 
on to the iPad like so and you'll see
that<00:02:02.920> the<00:02:03.100> lip<00:02:03.310> is<00:02:03.490> kind<00:02:03.670> of<00:02:03.760> what's<00:02:03.909> holding

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
that the lip is kind of what's holding

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.390 
that the lip is kind of what's holding
it<00:02:04.270> there<00:02:04.479> and<00:02:04.659> then<00:02:05.620> if<00:02:05.740> you<00:02:05.860> simply<00:02:06.190> just

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.400 
it there and then if you simply just

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.770 
it there and then if you simply just
screw<00:02:06.670> this<00:02:06.760> down<00:02:06.940> a<00:02:07.000> little<00:02:07.210> bit<00:02:07.420> you<00:02:07.600> can<00:02:07.750> use

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
screw this down a little bit you can use

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.869 
screw this down a little bit you can use
that<00:02:08.229> to<00:02:08.409> reshape<00:02:08.739> the<00:02:08.799> iPad<00:02:09.250> it's<00:02:09.399> actually

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:09.879 
that to reshape the iPad it's actually

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:11.100 
that to reshape the iPad it's actually
going<00:02:10.030> to<00:02:10.090> give<00:02:10.239> it<00:02:10.360> enough<00:02:10.599> clamp<00:02:10.869> that<00:02:10.959> you

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
going to give it enough clamp that you

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.770 
going to give it enough clamp that you
can<00:02:11.260> hold<00:02:11.560> it<00:02:11.769> just<00:02:12.700> by<00:02:13.000> the<00:02:13.060> clamp<00:02:13.450> and<00:02:13.629> don't

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
can hold it just by the clamp and don't

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.400 
can hold it just by the clamp and don't
even<00:02:13.870> have<00:02:14.049> to<00:02:14.140> touch<00:02:14.349> the<00:02:14.560> iPad

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
even have to touch the iPad

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:16.960 
even have to touch the iPad
and<00:02:15.680> then<00:02:15.830> to<00:02:15.950> reshape<00:02:16.280> it<00:02:16.460> you<00:02:16.520> just<00:02:16.670> move<00:02:16.850> it

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
and then to reshape it you just move it

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.320 
and then to reshape it you just move it
down<00:02:17.200> work<00:02:18.200> it<00:02:18.520> tightening<00:02:19.520> and<00:02:19.700> loosening<00:02:19.880> as

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
down work it tightening and loosening as

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.750 
down work it tightening and loosening as
you<00:02:20.480> go<00:02:20.630> so<00:02:21.440> that<00:02:21.650> you<00:02:21.770> can<00:02:21.920> start<00:02:22.160> to<00:02:22.280> reshape

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
you go so that you can start to reshape

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.090 
you go so that you can start to reshape
these<00:02:23.060> edges<00:02:23.570> back<00:02:23.750> out<00:02:24.050> to<00:02:24.830> where<00:02:24.950> they're

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
these edges back out to where they're

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.740 
these edges back out to where they're
going<00:02:25.130> to<00:02:25.340> not<00:02:25.700> interfere<00:02:26.270> with<00:02:26.300> the<00:02:26.510> glass

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
going to not interfere with the glass

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.970 
going to not interfere with the glass
line<00:02:27.080> down<00:02:27.610> the<00:02:28.610> corner<00:02:28.910> for<00:02:29.090> the<00:02:29.210> iPad<00:02:29.570> tool

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
line down the corner for the iPad tool

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.800 
line down the corner for the iPad tool
actually<00:02:30.980> looks<00:02:31.190> like<00:02:31.340> this<00:02:31.750> this<00:02:32.750> is

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
actually looks like this this is

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.070 
actually looks like this this is
actually<00:02:33.320> just<00:02:33.650> the<00:02:33.830> headset<00:02:34.550> and<00:02:34.820> so<00:02:35.480> this<00:02:35.960> is

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
actually just the headset and so this is

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.600 
actually just the headset and so this is
a<00:02:36.110> question<00:02:36.500> we've<00:02:36.620> been<00:02:36.650> getting<00:02:36.920> a<00:02:36.980> lot<00:02:37.010> a

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
a question we've been getting a lot a

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.880 
a question we've been getting a lot a
lot<00:02:38.090> of<00:02:38.150> on<00:02:38.480> the<00:02:38.630> phones<00:02:38.870> is<00:02:39.260> what's<00:02:39.830> the

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
lot of on the phones is what's the

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.920 
lot of on the phones is what's the
difference<00:02:40.010> between<00:02:40.280> the<00:02:40.790> full<00:02:41.060> tool<00:02:41.390> and<00:02:41.690> the

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
difference between the full tool and the

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.350 
difference between the full tool and the
headset<00:02:42.290> well<00:02:42.680> this<00:02:42.800> is<00:02:42.980> the<00:02:43.220> headset<00:02:43.670> it's

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
headset well this is the headset it's

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.030 
headset well this is the headset it's
going<00:02:44.540> to<00:02:44.600> come<00:02:44.810> with<00:02:44.960> screws<00:02:45.350> and<00:02:45.620> an<00:02:45.710> allen

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
going to come with screws and an allen

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.250 
going to come with screws and an allen
wrench<00:02:46.280> and<00:02:46.880> what<00:02:47.360> it<00:02:47.480> does<00:02:47.720> is<00:02:47.930> it<00:02:48.080> actually

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
wrench and what it does is it actually

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.370 
wrench and what it does is it actually
replaces<00:02:49.190> the<00:02:49.340> headset<00:02:49.730> that's<00:02:49.910> here<00:02:50.360> and<00:02:50.510> so

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
replaces the headset that's here and so

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.710 
replaces the headset that's here and so
this<00:02:51.710> piece<00:02:52.010> right<00:02:52.040> here<00:02:52.640> would<00:02:53.240> actually

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
this piece right here would actually

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.660 
this piece right here would actually
interchange<00:02:54.260> with<00:02:54.500> that<00:02:54.680> piece<00:02:54.920> like<00:02:55.160> so<00:02:55.430> and

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
interchange with that piece like so and

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.780 
interchange with that piece like so and
you<00:02:56.330> can<00:02:56.480> see<00:02:56.540> how<00:02:56.900> they're<00:02:57.110> shapes<00:02:57.380> similar

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
you can see how they're shapes similar

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.070 
you can see how they're shapes similar
down<00:02:58.790> here<00:02:59.060> where<00:02:59.210> it<00:02:59.270> actually<00:02:59.420> attaches<00:03:00.020> to

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
down here where it actually attaches to

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.170 
down here where it actually attaches to
the<00:03:00.260> tool<00:03:00.470> the<00:03:01.310> headsets<00:03:01.700> going<00:03:01.850> to<00:03:01.940> do<00:03:02.030> the

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
the tool the headsets going to do the

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.060 
the tool the headsets going to do the
same<00:03:02.390> thing<00:03:02.690> head<00:03:03.200> units<00:03:03.530> going<00:03:03.650> to<00:03:03.740> replace

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.070 
same thing head units going to replace

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:06.460 
same thing head units going to replace
it<00:03:04.250> just<00:03:04.460> like<00:03:04.640> that<00:03:04.670> it<00:03:05.570> gets<00:03:05.720> installed<00:03:06.080> with

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
it just like that it gets installed with

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.760 
it just like that it gets installed with
arrows<00:03:06.920> pointing<00:03:07.370> to<00:03:07.400> each<00:03:07.700> other<00:03:08.500> and<00:03:09.500> so

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:09.770 
arrows pointing to each other and so

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:11.860 
arrows pointing to each other and so
whenever<00:03:10.010> the<00:03:10.430> device<00:03:10.790> here<00:03:11.210> is<00:03:11.300> closed<00:03:11.630> it's

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
whenever the device here is closed it's

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.540 
whenever the device here is closed it's
going<00:03:12.020> to<00:03:12.080> close<00:03:12.260> that<00:03:12.290> down<00:03:12.560> and<00:03:12.980> cause<00:03:13.220> the

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550 
going to close that down and cause the

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.790 
going to close that down and cause the
corner<00:03:14.300> to<00:03:14.540> be<00:03:14.690> forced<00:03:15.050> back<00:03:15.230> into<00:03:15.290> shape

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 
corner to be forced back into shape

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.910 
corner to be forced back into shape
again<00:03:16.210> the<00:03:17.210> concept<00:03:17.570> here<00:03:17.810> is<00:03:17.930> the<00:03:18.110> same<00:03:18.380> if

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
again the concept here is the same if

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.380 
again the concept here is the same if
this<00:03:19.130> were<00:03:19.280> actually<00:03:19.400> installed<00:03:19.910> on<00:03:20.060> the<00:03:20.150> tool

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
this were actually installed on the tool

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.330 
this were actually installed on the tool
you<00:03:20.540> would<00:03:20.720> simply<00:03:20.900> get<00:03:21.140> it<00:03:21.290> lined<00:03:21.500> up<00:03:21.740> onto

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
you would simply get it lined up onto

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.550 
you would simply get it lined up onto
your<00:03:22.460> device<00:03:22.820> and<00:03:23.150> then<00:03:23.900> you<00:03:24.080> would<00:03:24.260> use<00:03:24.290> the

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
your device and then you would use the

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.930 
your device and then you would use the
other<00:03:25.250> portion<00:03:25.700> of<00:03:25.850> the<00:03:25.910> tool<00:03:26.390> to<00:03:27.940> cause

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
other portion of the tool to cause

the corners aren't going to be pushing

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:43.630 
the corners aren't going to be pushing
up<00:03:42.170> like<00:03:42.380> this<00:03:42.590> the<00:03:42.950> edges<00:03:43.280> aren't<00:03:43.430> going<00:03:43.580> to

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:43.640 
up like this the edges aren't going to

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.750 
up like this the edges aren't going to
be<00:03:43.700> pushing<00:03:43.940> in<00:03:44.390> or<00:03:44.870> out<00:03:45.140> which<00:03:46.130> can<00:03:46.310> interfere

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:59.510 
with how the glass is going to adhere
and<00:03:48.800> so<00:03:49.870> that's<00:03:50.870> how<00:03:51.020> you<00:03:51.080> use<00:03:51.380> the<00:03:51.410> G<00:03:51.740> tool
