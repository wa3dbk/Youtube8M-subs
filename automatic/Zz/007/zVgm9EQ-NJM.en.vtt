how<00:01:36.090> to<00:01:36.119> assemble<00:01:36.720> this<00:01:37.250> I've<00:01:38.250> never<00:01:38.399> flown<00:01:38.909> an

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
how to assemble this I've never flown an

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.969 
how to assemble this I've never flown an
RC<00:01:39.450> anything<00:01:39.990> before<00:01:40.380> so<00:01:40.619> this<00:01:40.770> will<00:01:40.890> be

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
RC anything before so this will be

RC anything before so this will be
really<00:01:41.159> fun<00:01:41.330> but<00:01:42.330> it<00:01:42.420> looks<00:01:42.600> like<00:01:42.720> we've<00:01:42.869> got

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
the main machine right here and then

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.969 
the main machine right here and then
we've<00:01:47.130> got<00:01:47.310> everything<00:01:47.729> to<00:01:48.060> hook<00:01:48.270> up<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:49.440> the

pretty fancy take a look at that and
I'll<00:02:04.739> have<00:02:04.920> to<00:02:05.039> learn<00:02:05.160> how<00:02:05.340> to<00:02:05.369> use<00:02:05.580> all<00:02:05.610> of

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
I'll have to learn how to use all of

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.509 
I'll have to learn how to use all of
this<00:02:06.149> so<00:02:06.360> I'm<00:02:06.450> really<00:02:06.599> excited<00:02:07.399> let's<00:02:08.399> go

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
at how easy this whole machine was to

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.880 
at how easy this whole machine was to
assemble<00:02:18.269> and<00:02:18.629> start<00:02:19.110> going<00:02:19.230> right<00:02:19.650> out<00:02:19.860> of

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
assemble and start going right out of

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.619 
assemble and start going right out of
the<00:02:20.069> box<00:02:20.310> it<00:02:20.580> didn't<00:02:20.790> have<00:02:20.970> an<00:02:21.090> instruction

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:21.629

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
but the company did put together very

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.920 
but the company did put together very

waiting for the battery to charge up
after<00:02:33.900> about<00:02:34.050> an<00:02:34.170> hour<00:02:34.440> after<00:02:35.220> opening<00:02:35.909> the

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
was very easy didn't take any real skill

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.780 
was very easy didn't take any real skill
to<00:02:54.030> learn<00:02:54.360> how<00:02:54.540> to<00:02:54.569> use<00:02:54.930> it<00:02:55.790> pretty

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
to learn how to use it pretty

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.550 
to learn how to use it pretty
self-explanatory<00:02:57.239> and<00:02:57.780> that's<00:02:57.930> really<00:02:58.290> what

now<00:03:42.290> one<00:03:42.800> complaint<00:03:43.190> people<00:03:43.400> have<00:03:43.520> had<00:03:43.670> about

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:43.820 
now one complaint people have had about

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:47.080 
now one complaint people have had about
this<00:03:44.120> is<00:03:44.270> the<00:03:44.810> wobble<00:03:45.260> effect<00:03:45.410> that<00:03:46.340> when<00:03:46.910> they

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
this is the wobble effect that when they

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.180 
this is the wobble effect that when they
fly<00:03:47.390> it<00:03:47.660> because<00:03:48.050> of<00:03:48.170> the<00:03:48.230> four<00:03:48.500> blades<00:03:48.860> it

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
fly it because of the four blades it

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:50.890 
fly it because of the four blades it
creates<00:03:49.459> this<00:03:49.550> kind<00:03:49.730> of<00:03:49.880> wobbly<00:03:50.390> image<00:03:50.690> now<00:03:50.870> I

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
creates this kind of wobbly image now I

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.390 
creates this kind of wobbly image now I
have<00:03:51.140> not<00:03:51.260> experienced<00:03:51.770> that<00:03:51.860> at<00:03:51.980> all<00:03:52.100> and<00:03:52.280> the

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
have not experienced that at all and the

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.890 
have not experienced that at all and the
footage<00:03:52.670> you're<00:03:52.790> watching<00:03:53.209> here<00:03:53.360> today<00:03:53.630> is

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
footage you're watching here today is

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.860 
footage you're watching here today is
from<00:03:54.230> my<00:03:54.950> actual<00:03:55.190> first<00:03:55.880> flight<00:03:56.360> and<00:03:56.630> there

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
from my actual first flight and there

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.560 
from my actual first flight and there
was<00:03:57.020> no<00:03:57.470> wobble<00:03:58.340> that<00:03:58.370> I<00:03:58.580> can<00:03:58.790> really<00:03:58.940> see<00:03:59.300> and

00:03:59.560 --> 00:03:59.570 
was no wobble that I can really see and

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:02.800 
was no wobble that I can really see and
I'm<00:03:59.990> quite<00:04:00.470> happy<00:04:00.709> with<00:04:01.100> that<00:04:01.370> I<00:04:01.820> think<00:04:02.330> really

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
I'm quite happy with that I think really

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.600 
I'm quite happy with that I think really
it's<00:04:03.020> just<00:04:03.080> about<00:04:03.350> getting<00:04:03.680> better<00:04:03.920> at<00:04:04.250> how<00:04:04.550> to

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.610 
it's just about getting better at how to

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.810 
it's just about getting better at how to
maneuver<00:04:05.180> the<00:04:05.709> machine<00:04:06.709> the<00:04:06.920> copter<00:04:07.340> so<00:04:07.640> that

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:07.820 
maneuver the machine the copter so that

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:10.920 
maneuver the machine the copter so that
you<00:04:07.910> can<00:04:08.060> have<00:04:08.269> a<00:04:08.570> smoother<00:04:09.350> shots<00:04:09.820> flybys

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
you can have a smoother shots flybys

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.570 
you can have a smoother shots flybys
panning<00:04:11.930> and<00:04:12.200> pan<00:04:12.530> out<00:04:12.680> etc<00:04:12.860> but<00:04:13.280> I<00:04:13.370> think<00:04:13.519> you

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:13.580 
panning and pan out etc but I think you

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:15.670 
panning and pan out etc but I think you
can<00:04:13.700> have<00:04:13.790> a<00:04:13.820> lot<00:04:14.030> of<00:04:14.120> fun<00:04:14.300> with<00:04:14.480> this<00:04:14.630> so<00:04:15.560> I'm
