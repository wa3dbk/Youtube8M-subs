00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:07.970 

I'd<00:00:06.720> like<00:00:06.930> to<00:00:07.049> continue<00:00:07.259> with<00:00:07.560> the<00:00:07.649> modak

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
I'd like to continue with the modak

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.379 
I'd like to continue with the modak
calculus<00:00:08.400> that<00:00:08.519> we<00:00:08.580> keep<00:00:08.760> up<00:00:08.970> the<00:00:09.150> flow

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
calculus that we keep up the flow

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.060 
calculus that we keep up the flow
because<00:00:09.780> we've<00:00:09.990> been<00:00:10.110> working<00:00:10.290> on<00:00:10.590> that<00:00:10.800> so

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
because we've been working on that so

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.680 
because we've been working on that so
I'd<00:00:11.370> like<00:00:11.460> to<00:00:11.610> address<00:00:11.790> some<00:00:12.030> other<00:00:12.120> aspects

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
I'd like to address some other aspects

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.859 
I'd like to address some other aspects
of<00:00:12.809> it<00:00:12.990> so<00:00:13.849> John<00:00:14.849> please<00:00:15.150> circle<00:00:15.599> around

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.960 

just<00:00:19.439> starting<00:00:19.800> with<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:20.070> basic<00:00:20.730> things

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
just starting with the basic things

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.150 
just starting with the basic things
would<00:00:21.390> somebody<00:00:21.600> grabs<00:00:22.529> you<00:00:22.650> you<00:00:22.980> obviously

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
would somebody grabs you you obviously

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.730 
would somebody grabs you you obviously
don't<00:00:23.640> want<00:00:23.850> to<00:00:23.970> stay<00:00:24.330> there<00:00:24.570> so<00:00:25.380> you<00:00:25.470> want<00:00:25.590> to

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
don't want to stay there so you want to

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.140 
don't want to stay there so you want to
start<00:00:25.980> moving<00:00:26.189> right<00:00:26.430> away

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
start moving right away

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.679 
start moving right away
and<00:00:27.689> try<00:00:27.960> to<00:00:28.019> keep<00:00:28.230> a<00:00:28.380> 45<00:00:28.890> degree<00:00:29.039> angle<00:00:29.689> so

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
and try to keep a 45 degree angle so

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.850 
and try to keep a 45 degree angle so
when<00:00:31.109> he<00:00:31.289> reaches<00:00:31.679> to<00:00:31.830> grab<00:00:33.260> first<00:00:34.260> off<00:00:34.500> you

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
when he reaches to grab first off you

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.410 
when he reaches to grab first off you
want<00:00:35.040> to<00:00:35.100> I<00:00:35.309> don't<00:00:35.520> want<00:00:35.640> to<00:00:35.730> go<00:00:35.820> back<00:00:36.120> because

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
want to I don't want to go back because

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.729 
want to I don't want to go back because
if<00:00:36.719> I<00:00:36.840> go<00:00:37.020> back<00:00:37.350> right<00:00:38.280> I<00:00:38.489> just<00:00:38.700> go<00:00:39.059> back<00:00:39.739> he's

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
if I go back right I just go back he's

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.619 
if I go back right I just go back he's
already<00:00:41.070> going<00:00:41.340> to<00:00:41.399> be<00:00:41.610> pushing<00:00:41.910> me<00:00:42.180> this<00:00:42.390> way

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
already going to be pushing me this way

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.750 
already going to be pushing me this way
he's<00:00:42.960> going<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.200> drive<00:00:43.440> forward<00:00:43.829> and<00:00:44.489> I'm<00:00:44.640> in

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
he's going to drive forward and I'm in

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.459 
he's going to drive forward and I'm in
trouble<00:00:45.000> are<00:00:45.300> you<00:00:47.300> okay<00:00:48.300> sorry<00:00:48.750> I<00:00:48.899> want<00:00:49.350> to

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
trouble are you okay sorry I want to

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.020 
trouble are you okay sorry I want to
take<00:00:49.680> him<00:00:49.860> off<00:00:50.039> with<00:00:50.219> an<00:00:50.340> angles<00:00:50.700> and<00:00:50.879> he

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
take him off with an angles and he

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:57.080 
take him off with an angles and he
reaches<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.570> grab<00:00:52.160> have<00:00:53.160> a<00:00:53.190> vigil<00:00:55.820> okay<00:00:56.820> taking

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
reaches to grab have a vigil okay taking

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:03.979 
reaches to grab have a vigil okay taking
this<00:00:57.360> way<00:01:00.859> so<00:01:01.859> let's<00:01:02.789> step<00:01:03.120> off<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.899> side

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
this way so let's step off to the side

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.700 
this way so let's step off to the side
initially<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:05.299> don't<00:01:06.299> let<00:01:06.659> him<00:01:06.960> see<00:01:07.560> if

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
initially and don't let him see if

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.010 
initially and don't let him see if
there's<00:01:07.920> something<00:01:08.130> you<00:01:08.610> know<00:01:08.760> in<00:01:09.420> physics

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
there's something you know in physics

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.810 
there's something you know in physics
where<00:01:10.260> you<00:01:10.650> have<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:11.040> overcome<00:01:11.189> static

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
where you have to overcome static

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.310 
where you have to overcome static
friction<00:01:12.540> if<00:01:12.810> he<00:01:12.990> grabs<00:01:13.290> me<00:01:13.560> here<00:01:15.140> okay

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
friction if he grabs me here okay

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.530 
friction if he grabs me here okay
he's<00:01:16.680> already<00:01:17.070> got<00:01:17.430> a<00:01:17.460> static<00:01:18.000> friction<00:01:18.390> with

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
he's already got a static friction with

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.240 
he's already got a static friction with
the<00:01:18.570> floor<00:01:18.689> it's<00:01:19.500> going<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.770> take<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:19.979> lot<00:01:20.220> to

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
the floor it's going to take a lot to

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.230 
the floor it's going to take a lot to
overcome<00:01:20.850> that<00:01:21.060> so<00:01:22.159> now<00:01:23.159> trying<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.670> move<00:01:23.970> him

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
overcome that so now trying to move him

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.330 
overcome that so now trying to move him
and<00:01:24.420> he's<00:01:24.630> stable<00:01:26.689> okay<00:01:27.689> if<00:01:28.200> I<00:01:28.500> can<00:01:28.710> get<00:01:28.950> him<00:01:29.130> so

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
and he's stable okay if I can get him so

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.090 
and he's stable okay if I can get him so
this<00:01:29.520> peak<00:01:29.850> never<00:01:30.119> settled<00:01:30.689> that's<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.860> best

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
this peak never settled that's the best

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:39.080 
this peak never settled that's the best
so<00:01:32.670> he<00:01:32.850> grabs<00:01:36.110> get<00:01:37.110> it<00:01:37.259> from<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.650> get-go<00:01:38.090> but

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
so he grabs get it from the get-go but

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.569 
so he grabs get it from the get-go but
don't<00:01:39.420> try<00:01:39.780> to<00:01:39.840> work<00:01:40.350> for<00:01:40.799> speed

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
don't try to work for speed

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:59.520 
don't try to work for speed
worthless<00:01:42.509> slowly<00:01:43.320> and<00:01:44.030> just<00:01:45.030> catch<00:01:45.390> that

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.130 

so<00:02:00.530> let's<00:02:01.040> try<00:02:01.250> to<00:02:01.340> just<00:02:01.640> move<00:02:01.970> off<00:02:02.360> line<00:02:02.390> and

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
so let's try to just move off line and

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.060 
so let's try to just move off line and
keep<00:02:03.650> blowing<00:02:04.070> don't<00:02:04.730> let<00:02:04.940> him<00:02:05.120> stop<00:02:05.710> so<00:02:06.710> even

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
keep blowing don't let him stop so even

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.110 
keep blowing don't let him stop so even
if<00:02:07.220> he<00:02:07.250> grabs<00:02:08.060> you<00:02:08.830> people<00:02:09.830> with<00:02:09.979> it<00:02:10.130> here<00:02:10.880> and

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
if he grabs you people with it here and

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.690 
if he grabs you people with it here and
they<00:02:11.750> do<00:02:12.260> it<00:02:12.380> slow<00:02:12.650> and<00:02:13.010> the<00:02:13.130> person<00:02:13.490> maybe

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
they do it slow and the person maybe

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.650 
they do it slow and the person maybe
tighten<00:02:14.240> up<00:02:14.390> here<00:02:15.490> don't<00:02:16.490> let<00:02:16.760> it<00:02:16.880> stop<00:02:17.300> if<00:02:17.630> you

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
tighten up here don't let it stop if you

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.750 
tighten up here don't let it stop if you
feel<00:02:17.780> that<00:02:18.140> tension<00:02:18.410> just<00:02:19.190> keep<00:02:19.370> your<00:02:19.550> back

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
feel that tension just keep your back

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.640 
feel that tension just keep your back
straight<00:02:19.790> and<00:02:20.330> wrong<00:02:22.630> okay<00:02:23.660> keep<00:02:24.260> your<00:02:24.440> back

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
straight and wrong okay keep your back

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:30.760 
straight and wrong okay keep your back
straight<00:02:24.680> and<00:02:27.940> you<00:02:28.940> build<00:02:29.240> tension<00:02:29.770> don't

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
straight and you build tension don't

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.630 
straight and you build tension don't
struggle<00:02:31.310> to<00:02:32.090> his<00:02:32.240> attention<00:02:33.370> find<00:02:34.370> that

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
struggle to his attention find that

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.400 
struggle to his attention find that
tension<00:02:35.120> it<00:02:35.300> is<00:02:35.330> finger<00:02:35.780> pointing<00:02:36.230> to<00:02:36.260> the

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
tension it is finger pointing to the

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
tension it is finger pointing to the
ground<00:02:36.640> in<00:02:37.640> front<00:02:40.209> you<00:02:41.209> see<00:02:41.890> but<00:02:42.890> keep<00:02:43.220> this

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
ground in front you see but keep this

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.620 
ground in front you see but keep this
alignment<00:02:43.910> if<00:02:44.330> you<00:02:45.020> lose<00:02:45.320> your<00:02:45.530> structure<00:02:46.280> and

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
alignment if you lose your structure and

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:52.110 
alignment if you lose your structure and
you<00:02:47.630> stop<00:02:47.959> breathing<00:02:49.270> you're<00:02:50.270> going<00:02:50.540> to<00:02:50.660> be

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
you stop breathing you're going to be

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.040 
you stop breathing you're going to be
finding<00:02:53.120> something<00:02:53.390> you<00:02:53.630> don't<00:02:53.780> want<00:02:53.930> to
