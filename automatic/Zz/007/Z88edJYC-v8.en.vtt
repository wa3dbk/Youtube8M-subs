broken so I think mine suffered some a
bit<00:01:08.549> in<00:01:08.700> shipping<00:01:09.240> but<00:01:09.740> if<00:01:10.740> you<00:01:10.950> get<00:01:11.130> this

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
bit in shipping but if you get this

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.700 
bit in shipping but if you get this
hopefully<00:01:11.610> yours<00:01:11.850> won't<00:01:12.030> be<00:01:12.240> so<00:01:13.080> let's<00:01:13.470> see<00:01:13.650> if

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
hopefully yours won't be so let's see if

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.020 
hopefully yours won't be so let's see if
this<00:01:13.890> is<00:01:14.010> about<00:01:14.280> how<00:01:15.090> cool<00:01:15.509> okay<00:01:16.850> there<00:01:17.850> you<00:01:17.880> go

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
this is about how cool okay there you go

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.450 
this is about how cool okay there you go
so<00:01:18.360> it's<00:01:18.479> like<00:01:18.570> an<00:01:18.689> ice<00:01:18.930> cream<00:01:19.170> cone<00:01:19.259> and<00:01:19.710> the

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
so it's like an ice cream cone and the

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.670 
so it's like an ice cream cone and the
shell<00:01:21.060> seems<00:01:21.630> like<00:01:21.780> just<00:01:22.049> like<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:22.200> regular<00:01:22.380> ice

time<00:03:09.940> but<00:03:10.330> really<00:03:10.630> fun<00:03:10.840> so<00:03:14.400> this<00:03:15.400> two<00:03:15.670> got

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
time but really fun so this two got

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.940 
time but really fun so this two got
melted<00:03:16.090> in<00:03:16.390> shipping<00:03:16.840> so<00:03:17.170> it's<00:03:17.410> really<00:03:17.680> ugly

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
but again you get the idea it has the

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.780 
but again you get the idea it has the
sugar<00:03:22.780> cone<00:03:22.990> or<00:03:23.290> not<00:03:23.530> the<00:03:23.620> true<00:03:23.770> from<00:03:23.920> the<00:03:24.130> cake

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
sugar cone or not the true from the cake

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.640 
sugar cone or not the true from the cake
cone<00:03:25.000> but<00:03:25.600> instead<00:03:25.750> of<00:03:25.810> being<00:03:26.020> chocolate<00:03:26.440> it's

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
cone but instead of being chocolate it's

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.780 
cone but instead of being chocolate it's
um<00:03:27.130> the<00:03:27.430> vanilla<00:03:27.670> kind<00:03:27.940> and<00:03:29.610> the<00:03:30.610> top

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
um the vanilla kind and the top

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:37.130 
um the vanilla kind and the top
strawberry<00:03:31.330> so<00:03:31.900> let's<00:03:32.380> try<00:03:32.560> it<00:03:32.620> ready<00:03:34.770> mmm

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.760 
strawberry so let's try it ready mmm
same<00:03:38.140> thing<00:03:38.380> very<00:03:39.720> chocolaty<00:03:40.720> stuff<00:03:41.470> with

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:41.770 
same thing very chocolaty stuff with

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:43.440 
same thing very chocolaty stuff with
white<00:03:41.980> up<00:03:42.250> with<00:03:42.610> regular<00:03:43.000> chocolate<00:03:43.330> in<00:03:43.390> the

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
white up with regular chocolate in the

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.080 
white up with regular chocolate in the
middle<00:03:44.070> but<00:03:45.070> this<00:03:45.220> time<00:03:45.400> it's<00:03:45.610> flavored<00:03:45.940> like

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
middle but this time it's flavored like

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.040 
middle but this time it's flavored like
strawberry<00:03:46.960> Pocky<00:03:47.140> it's<00:03:47.710> good<00:03:48.160> I<00:03:48.460> love<00:03:48.730> it

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 
strawberry Pocky it's good I love it

strawberry Pocky it's good I love it
artificial<00:03:50.050> strawberry<00:03:50.260> flavor<00:03:51.270> but<00:03:52.270> I<00:03:52.540> think

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
artificial strawberry flavor but I think

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.000 
artificial strawberry flavor but I think
the<00:03:52.990> thing<00:03:53.140> that's<00:03:53.170> going<00:03:53.500> for<00:03:53.710> this<00:03:53.800> is<00:03:53.980> a

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
the thing that's going for this is a

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.320 
the thing that's going for this is a
texture<00:03:54.580> it's<00:03:55.540> a<00:03:55.570> really<00:03:55.780> light<00:03:56.050> airy<00:03:56.410> texture

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
texture it's a really light airy texture

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.960 
texture it's a really light airy texture
and<00:03:58.830> so<00:03:59.830> it<00:03:59.890> doesn't<00:04:00.040> feel<00:04:00.220> so<00:04:00.370> dense<00:04:00.640> and<00:04:00.910> so

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
and so it doesn't feel so dense and so

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.860 
and so it doesn't feel so dense and so
heavy<00:04:01.560> in<00:04:02.560> terms<00:04:02.680> of<00:04:03.040> flavor<00:04:03.280> sweetness<00:04:04.060> it's

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
heavy in terms of flavor sweetness it's

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.110 
heavy in terms of flavor sweetness it's
about<00:04:04.990> the<00:04:05.110> same<00:04:05.350> as<00:04:05.500> a<00:04:05.530> pokey<00:04:05.950> or<00:04:06.340> Sam<00:04:06.880> the

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
about the same as a pokey or Sam the

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.900 
about the same as a pokey or Sam the
same<00:04:07.300> as<00:04:07.570> a<00:04:07.890> trying<00:04:08.890> to<00:04:08.980> think<00:04:09.130> or<00:04:09.250> Union<00:04:09.730> or

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 
same as a trying to think or Union or

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:11.160 
same as a trying to think or Union or
something<00:04:10.180> like<00:04:10.300> that<00:04:10.510> I<00:04:10.690> think<00:04:10.990> I<00:04:11.080> actually

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170 
something like that I think I actually

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.650 
something like that I think I actually
like<00:04:11.410> the<00:04:11.530> strawberry<00:04:11.890> better<00:04:12.420> but<00:04:13.420> I<00:04:13.450> think

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
like the strawberry better but I think

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.080 
like the strawberry better but I think
it's<00:04:13.810> definitely<00:04:14.280> it's<00:04:15.280> because<00:04:15.610> of<00:04:15.730> my<00:04:15.940> own

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
it's definitely it's because of my own

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.260 
it's definitely it's because of my own
taste<00:04:16.750> preference<00:04:17.320> I<00:04:17.560> like<00:04:18.520> the<00:04:18.910> strawberry

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:19.270

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:21.030 
taste preference I like the strawberry
taste<00:04:19.810> flow<00:04:20.080> better<00:04:20.350> than<00:04:20.530> the<00:04:20.620> cookies<00:04:20.890> and

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:21.040 
taste flow better than the cookies and

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.200 
taste flow better than the cookies and
cream<00:04:21.160> I<00:04:21.280> feel<00:04:21.430> like<00:04:21.520> this<00:04:21.669> is<00:04:21.760> just<00:04:21.880> more<00:04:22.060> like

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
cream I feel like this is just more like

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.260 
cream I feel like this is just more like
vanilla<00:04:22.540> with<00:04:23.200> Oreo<00:04:23.500> cookie

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270
