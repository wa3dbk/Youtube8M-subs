00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850 
hey folks this is Austin from wonder how

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.300 
hey folks this is Austin from wonder how
to<00:00:02.909> calm<00:00:03.540> and<00:00:04.020> I'm<00:00:04.440> gonna<00:00:04.560> demonstrate<00:00:04.770> a

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
to calm and I'm gonna demonstrate a

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.550 
to calm and I'm gonna demonstrate a
Minecraft<00:00:05.940> machine<00:00:06.420> gun<00:00:06.690> which<00:00:07.109> is<00:00:07.140> both

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
Minecraft machine gun which is both

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:08.000 
Minecraft machine gun which is both
deadly

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
deadly

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.169 
deadly
and<00:00:08.189> practical<00:00:10.040> it's<00:00:11.040> a<00:00:11.340> really<00:00:11.910> really<00:00:12.150> easy

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
and practical it's a really really easy

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.600 
and practical it's a really really easy
design<00:00:12.750> this<00:00:13.349> designs<00:00:13.679> been<00:00:13.860> around<00:00:14.070> for<00:00:14.340> for

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
design this designs been around for for

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.080 
design this designs been around for for
quite<00:00:14.730> a<00:00:14.790> long<00:00:14.969> time<00:00:16.580> basically<00:00:17.580> you<00:00:17.910> have

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
quite a long time basically you have

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.590 
quite a long time basically you have
here<00:00:18.359> a<00:00:18.390> rapid<00:00:19.050> pulsar<00:00:19.439> which<00:00:20.340> we<00:00:21.240> have<00:00:21.420> an

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
here a rapid pulsar which we have an

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.420 
here a rapid pulsar which we have an
earlier<00:00:22.080> tutorial<00:00:22.289> on<00:00:22.800> how<00:00:22.890> to<00:00:22.920> build<00:00:23.130> is

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
earlier tutorial on how to build is

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.380 
earlier tutorial on how to build is
really<00:00:23.789> simple<00:00:25.250> connected<00:00:26.250> to<00:00:26.490> a<00:00:26.880> dispenser

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
really simple connected to a dispenser

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.950 
really simple connected to a dispenser
and<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:28.320> dispenser<00:00:28.650> is<00:00:28.980> full<00:00:29.220> of<00:00:29.310> arrows<00:00:29.720> as<00:00:30.720> I

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
and the dispenser is full of arrows as I

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.520 
and the dispenser is full of arrows as I
never<00:00:31.830> mind<00:00:32.070> it<00:00:32.250> is<00:00:32.340> not<00:00:32.369> full<00:00:32.669> of<00:00:32.700> arrows<00:00:33.530> but

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
never mind it is not full of arrows but

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.369 
never mind it is not full of arrows but
now<00:00:34.680> it<00:00:34.829> is<00:00:35.270> so<00:00:36.469> we<00:00:37.469> have<00:00:37.649> a<00:00:39.079> repeater<00:00:40.079> here

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
now it is so we have a repeater here

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.250 
now it is so we have a repeater here
which<00:00:41.040> stabilizes<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:42.450> redstone<00:00:43.020> current

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
which stabilizes the redstone current

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.240 
which stabilizes the redstone current
and<00:00:43.770> helps<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.700> dispenser<00:00:45.629> work<00:00:45.780> properly

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 
and helps the dispenser work properly

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.150 
and helps the dispenser work properly
you'll<00:00:47.250> probably<00:00:47.700> want<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.210> adjust<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.899> delay

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.160 
you'll probably want to adjust the delay

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.209 
you'll probably want to adjust the delay
depending<00:00:50.160> on<00:00:50.280> how<00:00:50.489> laggy<00:00:50.910> your<00:00:51.210> server<00:00:51.449> is

00:00:52.209 --> 00:00:52.219 
depending on how laggy your server is

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:54.889 
depending on how laggy your server is
mine<00:00:53.219> is<00:00:53.399> on<00:00:53.550> one<00:00:53.789> delay<00:00:54.059> right<00:00:54.270> now<00:00:54.449> which<00:00:54.750> I

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
mine is on one delay right now which I

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.720 
mine is on one delay right now which I
found<00:00:55.140> works<00:00:55.350> best<00:00:55.440> on<00:00:55.739> our<00:00:55.829> server<00:00:56.070> but<00:00:56.460> your

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
found works best on our server but your

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:57.590 
found works best on our server but your
results<00:00:57.120> may<00:00:57.270> vary

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
results may vary

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:06.730 
results may vary
so<00:00:58.440> anyway<00:00:59.430> you<00:00:59.699> just<00:00:59.730> flip<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.239> switch<00:01:04.729> and

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
so anyway you just flip the switch and

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.210 
so anyway you just flip the switch and
things<00:01:07.740> are<00:01:08.070> buried<00:01:08.880> under<00:01:09.150> a<00:01:09.180> hail<00:01:09.450> of<00:01:09.479> arrows

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
things are buried under a hail of arrows

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.429 
things are buried under a hail of arrows
so<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:12.150> difference<00:01:12.540> here<00:01:12.630> is<00:01:12.960> that<00:01:12.990> well

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
so the difference here is that well

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.649 
so the difference here is that well
that's<00:01:13.619> that's<00:01:14.280> not<00:01:14.700> a<00:01:14.760> very<00:01:14.939> practical<00:01:15.270> way

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
that's that's not a very practical way

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.050 
that's that's not a very practical way
to<00:01:15.689> kill<00:01:15.990> something<00:01:16.409> I<00:01:16.920> mean<00:01:17.369> it's<00:01:17.549> a<00:01:17.670> stylish

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
to kill something I mean it's a stylish

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.390 
to kill something I mean it's a stylish
way<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.450> kill<00:01:18.659> something<00:01:18.930> but<00:01:19.229> it's<00:01:20.070> not<00:01:20.280> very

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
way to kill something but it's not very

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.520 
way to kill something but it's not very
practical<00:01:21.060> because<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.540> arrows<00:01:21.869> go<00:01:22.380> out

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
practical because the arrows go out

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.070 
practical because the arrows go out
pretty<00:01:22.860> fast<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:23.549> it'll<00:01:24.000> dispenser<00:01:24.869> only

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
pretty fast and it'll dispenser only

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.880 
pretty fast and it'll dispenser only
hold<00:01:25.320> so<00:01:25.650> many<00:01:25.770> arrows<00:01:26.240> well<00:01:27.650> another<00:01:28.650> way

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
hold so many arrows well another way

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.649 
hold so many arrows well another way
that<00:01:29.159> this<00:01:29.280> is<00:01:29.400> interesting<00:01:29.640> is<00:01:30.119> you<00:01:30.299> may<00:01:30.420> note

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
that this is interesting is you may note

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.870 
that this is interesting is you may note
that<00:01:30.689> this<00:01:30.990> is<00:01:31.140> a<00:01:31.170> I'm<00:01:32.130> picking<00:01:32.430> them<00:01:32.520> up<00:01:32.640> here

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
that this is a I'm picking them up here

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.280 
that this is a I'm picking them up here
but<00:01:33.060> this<00:01:33.509> is<00:01:33.659> a<00:01:33.689> pretty<00:01:34.070> evenly<00:01:35.070> distributed

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
but this is a pretty evenly distributed

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.440 
but this is a pretty evenly distributed
pattern<00:01:37.290> a<00:01:37.560> pattern<00:01:37.920> of<00:01:38.009> arrows<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:38.670> they're

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
pattern a pattern of arrows and they're

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.660 
pattern a pattern of arrows and they're
sort<00:01:39.689> of<00:01:39.810> they're<00:01:40.110> almost<00:01:40.229> all<00:01:40.619> entirely<00:01:41.310> in

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
sort of they're almost all entirely in

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.620 
sort of they're almost all entirely in
this<00:01:41.820> row<00:01:42.090> of<00:01:42.119> blocks<00:01:44.000> over<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.119> course<00:01:45.329> of

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
this row of blocks over the course of

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.590 
this row of blocks over the course of
about<00:01:46.259> about<00:01:46.680> six<00:01:47.070> blocks<00:01:47.220> long<00:01:48.210> as<00:01:48.479> the

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
about about six blocks long as the

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.700 
about about six blocks long as the
target<00:01:48.930> area<00:01:49.170> so<00:01:50.180> coming<00:01:51.180> in<00:01:51.390> Minecraft<00:01:51.840> 1.3

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
target area so coming in Minecraft 1.3

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.249 
target area so coming in Minecraft 1.3
is<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.549> ability<00:01:53.759> for<00:01:54.210> arrows<00:01:54.630> to<00:01:54.960> trigger

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
is the ability for arrows to trigger

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.749 
is the ability for arrows to trigger
both<00:01:55.860> pressure<00:01:56.250> plates<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:57.200> tripwires

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 
both pressure plates and tripwires

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:04.330 
both pressure plates and tripwires
so<00:01:59.759> if<00:02:00.210> you<00:02:00.840> set<00:02:01.170> up<00:02:01.350> a<00:02:01.619> couple<00:02:02.250> of<00:02:02.520> I<00:02:03.180> guess<00:02:03.659> six

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
so if you set up a couple of I guess six

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.639 
so if you set up a couple of I guess six
pressure<00:02:05.340> plates<00:02:05.670> here<00:02:06.200> you're<00:02:07.200> you're

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
pressure plates here you're you're

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.550 
pressure plates here you're you're
nearly<00:02:08.310> guaranteed<00:02:08.879> for<00:02:09.330> an<00:02:09.420> arrow<00:02:09.660> to<00:02:10.410> hit

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
nearly guaranteed for an arrow to hit

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.400 
nearly guaranteed for an arrow to hit
one<00:02:10.739> of<00:02:10.770> them<00:02:10.979> and<00:02:11.300> particularly<00:02:12.300> if<00:02:12.450> you<00:02:12.660> can

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
one of them and particularly if you can

practically guaranteed to get redstone

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.180 
practically guaranteed to get redstone
out<00:02:22.560> of<00:02:22.710> it<00:02:22.830> so<00:02:23.820> that's<00:02:24.660> like<00:02:24.930> a<00:02:24.990> it's<00:02:25.950> about<00:02:26.040> a

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
out of it so that's like a it's about a

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.460 
out of it so that's like a it's about a
six<00:02:26.610> block<00:02:26.970> long<00:02:27.270> length<00:02:29.360> minimum<00:02:30.410> that<00:02:31.410> you

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
six block long length minimum that you

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.310 
six block long length minimum that you
can<00:02:31.860> shoot<00:02:32.160> an<00:02:32.280> arrow<00:02:32.460> and<00:02:32.910> get<00:02:33.810> redstone

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
can shoot an arrow and get redstone

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.130 
can shoot an arrow and get redstone
power<00:02:34.700> so<00:02:35.700> that's<00:02:36.150> a<00:02:36.240> great<00:02:36.480> way<00:02:36.540> if<00:02:36.840> you<00:02:36.990> want

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
power so that's a great way if you want

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.720 
power so that's a great way if you want
to<00:02:37.230> hide<00:02:37.550> your<00:02:38.550> redstone<00:02:39.360> wire<00:02:40.100> so<00:02:41.100> that<00:02:41.130> it's

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
to hide your redstone wire so that it's

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.820 
to hide your redstone wire so that it's
just<00:02:41.880> arrows<00:02:42.480> that<00:02:42.750> set<00:02:42.960> it<00:02:43.080> off<00:02:43.200> which<00:02:43.680> is

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
just arrows that set it off which is

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.090 
just arrows that set it off which is
pretty<00:02:44.040> cool<00:02:44.250> and<00:02:44.520> then<00:02:45.120> additionally

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
pretty cool and then additionally

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.340 
pretty cool and then additionally
tripwire<00:02:47.100> will<00:02:47.910> also<00:02:48.300> be<00:02:48.480> set<00:02:48.720> off<00:02:48.810> by<00:02:49.020> arrows

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
tripwire will also be set off by arrows

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.080 
tripwire will also be set off by arrows
and<00:02:49.740> all<00:02:50.010> you<00:02:50.160> have<00:02:50.280> to<00:02:50.370> do<00:02:50.490> is<00:02:50.610> run<00:02:50.910> that

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
and all you have to do is run that

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.290 
and all you have to do is run that
across<00:02:51.540> and<00:02:52.110> if<00:02:52.980> an<00:02:53.130> arrow<00:02:53.340> passes<00:02:54.030> through<00:02:54.270> a

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
across and if an arrow passes through a

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:59.240 
across and if an arrow passes through a
square<00:02:54.750> with<00:02:56.240> with<00:02:57.240> string<00:02:57.660> on<00:02:57.960> it<00:02:57.990> it'll<00:02:58.920> set

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
square with with string on it it'll set

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.290 
square with with string on it it'll set
that<00:02:59.430> off<00:02:59.720> so<00:03:00.720> that's<00:03:01.680> a<00:03:01.860> really<00:03:02.190> cool<00:03:02.430> and<00:03:03.030> I

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
that off so that's a really cool and I

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:04.730 
that off so that's a really cool and I
think<00:03:03.600> the<00:03:03.690> tripwire<00:03:04.050> will<00:03:04.320> be<00:03:04.410> a<00:03:04.440> little<00:03:04.590> bit

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740 
think the tripwire will be a little bit

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.910 
think the tripwire will be a little bit
more<00:03:04.890> reliable<00:03:05.190> than<00:03:05.640> the<00:03:05.670> pressure<00:03:05.880> plates

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
more reliable than the pressure plates

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.610 
more reliable than the pressure plates
just<00:03:08.210> just<00:03:09.210> I<00:03:09.330> think<00:03:09.390> it<00:03:10.020> hasn't<00:03:10.260> come<00:03:10.470> out<00:03:10.560> yet

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
just just I think it hasn't come out yet

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.130 
just just I think it hasn't come out yet
so<00:03:10.830> but<00:03:11.790> but<00:03:12.330> that's<00:03:12.450> so<00:03:12.690> that's<00:03:12.780> a<00:03:12.930> really

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
so but but that's so that's a really

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.370 
so but but that's so that's a really
cool<00:03:13.350> way<00:03:13.590> to<00:03:13.620> make<00:03:13.890> use<00:03:14.280> of<00:03:14.310> something<00:03:14.700> that

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
cool way to make use of something that

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.170 
cool way to make use of something that
until<00:03:16.380> recently<00:03:16.530> was<00:03:16.890> not<00:03:17.520> tremendously

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
until recently was not tremendously

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.240 
until recently was not tremendously
useful<00:03:18.470> so<00:03:19.470> anyway<00:03:20.310> check<00:03:20.910> the<00:03:21.390> tutorial

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
useful so anyway check the tutorial

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
useful so anyway check the tutorial
listed<00:03:23.250> in<00:03:23.370> the<00:03:23.459> description<00:03:23.580> for<00:03:24.120> how<00:03:24.209> to

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270 
listed in the description for how to

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:29.390 
listed in the description for how to
build<00:03:24.510> it<00:03:24.660> and<00:03:25.040> I<00:03:26.040> hope<00:03:26.250> you<00:03:27.120> enjoy
