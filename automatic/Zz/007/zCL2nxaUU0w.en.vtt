that just because again just enjoying
people's<00:03:02.450> company<00:03:02.660> so<00:03:03.020> you<00:03:03.350> might<00:03:03.530> see<00:03:03.770> some

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
people's company so you might see some

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.890 
people's company so you might see some
of<00:03:04.070> that<00:03:04.280> in<00:03:04.430> their<00:03:04.610> videos<00:03:04.790> but<00:03:05.270> I<00:03:05.480> really

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
of that in their videos but I really

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.390 
of that in their videos but I really
wanted<00:03:06.020> to<00:03:06.170> keep<00:03:06.320> this<00:03:06.470> more<00:03:06.680> lifting<00:03:07.040> focus

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
wanted to keep this more lifting focus

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.190 
wanted to keep this more lifting focus
and<00:03:07.580> I<00:03:07.610> know<00:03:07.670> it's<00:03:07.880> probably<00:03:08.000> not<00:03:08.270> good<00:03:08.510> only

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
and I know it's probably not good only

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.449 
and I know it's probably not good only
because<00:03:09.320> this<00:03:09.590> was<00:03:09.740> supposed<00:03:09.980> to<00:03:10.010> be<00:03:10.100> an<00:03:10.190> epic

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
because this was supposed to be an epic

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:12.010 
because this was supposed to be an epic
colab<00:03:10.820> but<00:03:11.090> it<00:03:11.450> was<00:03:11.540> really<00:03:11.750> good<00:03:11.870> just

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.020 
colab but it was really good just

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.560 
colab but it was really good just
hanging<00:03:12.170> out<00:03:12.380> and<00:03:12.560> meeting<00:03:12.800> these<00:03:12.980> guys<00:03:13.570> you

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
see my second working set here come up

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.310 
see my second working set here come up
so<00:03:16.370> again<00:03:16.610> it's<00:03:16.760> 310<00:03:17.269> the<00:03:17.510> goal<00:03:17.720> today<00:03:17.959> was<00:03:18.110> to

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
so again it's 310 the goal today was to

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.440 
so again it's 310 the goal today was to
get<00:03:18.560> anywhere<00:03:18.890> between<00:03:19.100> two<00:03:19.550> to<00:03:19.580> four<00:03:19.880> sets<00:03:20.209> of

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
get anywhere between two to four sets of

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.050 
get anywhere between two to four sets of
four<00:03:21.230> reps<00:03:21.470> so<00:03:21.680> the<00:03:21.800> first<00:03:22.070> set<00:03:22.370> I<00:03:22.519> struggled

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
four reps so the first set I struggled

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.550 
four reps so the first set I struggled
on<00:03:23.180> and<00:03:23.390> I<00:03:23.420> was<00:03:23.540> worried<00:03:23.840> about<00:03:23.900> this<00:03:24.230> second

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
on and I was worried about this second

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.620 
on and I was worried about this second
one<00:03:24.709> but<00:03:25.250> the<00:03:25.400> second<00:03:25.730> one<00:03:25.850> actually<00:03:26.239> went<00:03:26.510> a

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
one but the second one actually went a

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.720 
one but the second one actually went a
lot<00:03:26.810> better<00:03:26.870> and<00:03:27.380> I<00:03:27.440> managed<00:03:27.830> to<00:03:27.920> get<00:03:28.130> all<00:03:28.310> four

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
lot better and I managed to get all four

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.880 
lot better and I managed to get all four
reps<00:03:29.030> now<00:03:29.690> as<00:03:29.870> part<00:03:30.170> of<00:03:30.290> this<00:03:30.440> one<00:03:30.709> of<00:03:30.830> the

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
reps now as part of this one of the

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:32.530 
reps now as part of this one of the
things<00:03:31.070> I<00:03:31.190> will<00:03:31.400> say<00:03:31.610> and<00:03:31.790> I'm<00:03:31.880> not<00:03:32.030> making<00:03:32.390> an

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
things I will say and I'm not making an

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.780 
things I will say and I'm not making an
excuse<00:03:32.989> necessarily<00:03:33.739> but<00:03:34.340> me<00:03:34.519> and<00:03:34.610> Maddie

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
excuse necessarily but me and Maddie

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:36.430 
excuse necessarily but me and Maddie
kind<00:03:35.060> of<00:03:35.150> had<00:03:35.239> this<00:03:35.360> discussion<00:03:35.570> to<00:03:35.989> we<00:03:36.260> were

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
kind of had this discussion to we were

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.680 
kind of had this discussion to we were
really<00:03:36.680> kind<00:03:36.980> of<00:03:37.160> thrown<00:03:37.730> off<00:03:37.880> by<00:03:38.090> this<00:03:38.150> bench

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
really kind of thrown off by this bench

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.620 
really kind of thrown off by this bench
only<00:03:38.930> because<00:03:39.380> where<00:03:40.130> the<00:03:40.400> actual<00:03:40.790> pad<00:03:41.150> is<00:03:41.390> I

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 
only because where the actual pad is I

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:43.420 
only because where the actual pad is I
typically<00:03:42.080> set<00:03:42.380> up<00:03:42.470> further<00:03:42.739> back<00:03:43.070> so<00:03:43.100> the

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
typically set up further back so the

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.580 
typically set up further back so the
bars<00:03:43.670> probably<00:03:44.510> right<00:03:44.660> above<00:03:44.930> my<00:03:45.050> clavicles

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
bars probably right above my clavicles

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.310 
bars probably right above my clavicles
when<00:03:45.709> I<00:03:45.769> start<00:03:46.070> not<00:03:46.640> to<00:03:46.790> mention<00:03:46.940> for<00:03:47.390> me<00:03:47.630> this

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:48.320 
when I start not to mention for me this

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.320 
when I start not to mention for me this
rack<00:03:48.590> was<00:03:48.830> very<00:03:49.100> low<00:03:49.340> so<00:03:49.610> I<00:03:49.640> definitely<00:03:50.000> needed

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:50.330 
rack was very low so I definitely needed

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:51.880 
rack was very low so I definitely needed
a<00:03:50.510> lift<00:03:50.690> off<00:03:50.870> on<00:03:51.019> the<00:03:51.140> heavier<00:03:51.350> sets<00:03:51.709> because

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
a lift off on the heavier sets because

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:53.830 
a lift off on the heavier sets because
it<00:03:52.220> was<00:03:52.340> about<00:03:52.580> halfway<00:03:52.910> up<00:03:53.150> of<00:03:53.420> where<00:03:53.600> I<00:03:53.630> would

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
it was about halfway up of where I would

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.960 
it was about halfway up of where I would
normally<00:03:54.019> racket<00:03:54.650> you<00:03:55.130> see<00:03:55.310> Bob<00:03:55.519> here<00:03:55.730> do<00:03:55.940> a

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
normally racket you see Bob here do a

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.380 
normally racket you see Bob here do a
great<00:03:56.269> single<00:03:56.690> of<00:03:56.870> 295<00:03:57.650> as<00:03:57.950> well<00:03:58.220> so<00:03:59.030> after

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390 
great single of 295 as well so after

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:01.630 
great single of 295 as well so after
those<00:04:00.050> first<00:04:00.230> two<00:04:00.470> sets<00:04:00.709> I<00:04:00.860> decided<00:04:01.190> not<00:04:01.370> to<00:04:01.519> go

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640 
those first two sets I decided not to go

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.310 
those first two sets I decided not to go
any<00:04:01.820> further<00:04:01.970> only<00:04:02.480> because<00:04:02.750> they<00:04:02.900> were<00:04:02.959> kind

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:03.320 
any further only because they were kind

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:04.810 
any further only because they were kind
of<00:04:03.410> tough<00:04:03.680> I<00:04:03.890> wasn't<00:04:04.070> really<00:04:04.310> necessarily

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:04.820 
of tough I wasn't really necessarily

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:06.280 
of tough I wasn't really necessarily
feeling<00:04:05.150> it<00:04:05.360> and<00:04:05.480> that's<00:04:05.600> an<00:04:05.720> important<00:04:06.140> part

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
feeling it and that's an important part

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:07.990 
feeling it and that's an important part
of<00:04:06.350> dance<00:04:06.590> program<00:04:07.070> is<00:04:07.280> really<00:04:07.430> knowing<00:04:07.700> when

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
it a lot as a training tool as long as

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:36.690 
it a lot as a training tool as long as
it's<00:04:35.200> used<00:04:35.530> correctly<00:04:35.740> and<00:04:36.160> hopefully<00:04:36.490> you

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:36.700 
it's used correctly and hopefully you

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.280 
it's used correctly and hopefully you
guys<00:04:37.180> know<00:04:37.390> how<00:04:37.450> to<00:04:37.480> use<00:04:37.600> your<00:04:37.840> tool<00:04:38.020> and<00:04:38.230> if

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:38.290 
guys know how to use your tool and if

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:40.440 
guys know how to use your tool and if
not<00:04:38.410> practice<00:04:38.920> always<00:04:39.280> makes<00:04:39.490> perfect<00:04:39.940> but

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:40.450 
not practice always makes perfect but

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:41.820 
not practice always makes perfect but
it's<00:04:40.570> a<00:04:40.660> tool<00:04:40.840> to<00:04:40.990> use<00:04:41.020> and<00:04:41.350> not<00:04:41.380> something<00:04:41.680> to

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
it's a tool to use and not something to

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.290 
it's a tool to use and not something to
be<00:04:41.890> relied<00:04:42.190> on<00:04:42.220> because<00:04:42.520> yes<00:04:42.670> it<00:04:42.850> does<00:04:43.060> make

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
be relied on because yes it does make

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.420 
be relied on because yes it does make
the<00:04:43.450> lifts<00:04:43.690> easier<00:04:44.020> however<00:04:44.710> I<00:04:44.800> like<00:04:45.100> it<00:04:45.280> to

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
the lifts easier however I like it to

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.220 
the lifts easier however I like it to
help<00:04:45.580> overload<00:04:46.120> the<00:04:46.360> actual<00:04:46.750> weight<00:04:46.930> as<00:04:47.170> well

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:47.230 
help overload the actual weight as well

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:49.170 
help overload the actual weight as well
as<00:04:47.560> feel<00:04:47.710> more<00:04:47.920> comfortable<00:04:48.190> using<00:04:48.760> heavier

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 
as feel more comfortable using heavier

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.870 
as feel more comfortable using heavier
weights<00:04:49.480> so<00:04:50.050> going<00:04:50.320> forward<00:04:50.740> if<00:04:51.370> I<00:04:51.430> don't<00:04:51.700> use

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:51.880 
weights so going forward if I don't use

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.670 
weights so going forward if I don't use
the<00:04:52.000> slingshot<00:04:52.450> I<00:04:52.480> know<00:04:52.630> for<00:04:53.020> example<00:04:53.110> I<00:04:53.500> done

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
the slingshot I know for example I done

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.670 
the slingshot I know for example I done
315<00:04:54.490> 45<00:04:54.880> before<00:04:55.270> that<00:04:55.810> mental<00:04:56.170> edge<00:04:56.320> for<00:04:56.560> me

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 
315 45 before that mental edge for me

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.950 
315 45 before that mental edge for me
personally<00:04:56.920> is<00:04:57.280> very<00:04:57.490> huge<00:04:57.910> another<00:04:58.750> nice

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
personally is very huge another nice

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.540 
personally is very huge another nice
thing<00:04:58.990> with<00:04:59.230> this<00:04:59.470> link<00:04:59.740> shot<00:04:59.920> is<00:05:00.040> it<00:05:00.250> really

thing with this link shot is it really

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.370 
thing with this link shot is it really
forces<00:05:00.850> you<00:05:01.000> to<00:05:01.210> tuck<00:05:01.420> your<00:05:01.450> elbows<00:05:01.600> more<00:05:02.170> so

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:02.380 
forces you to tuck your elbows more so

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.080

you see Matty give this a try as well
now<00:05:10.540> unfortunately<00:05:10.690> one<00:05:11.350> of<00:05:11.380> the<00:05:11.530> downsides

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
now unfortunately one of the downsides

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.470 
now unfortunately one of the downsides
of<00:05:12.100> working<00:05:12.160> out<00:05:12.580> with<00:05:12.760> others<00:05:13.060> and<00:05:13.270> having

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:13.480 
of working out with others and having

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.060 
of working out with others and having
limited<00:05:13.870> time<00:05:14.080> in<00:05:14.290> the<00:05:14.410> gym<00:05:14.560> because<00:05:14.740> of<00:05:15.010> the

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:15.070 
limited time in the gym because of the

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:17.520 
limited time in the gym because of the
fitness<00:05:15.370> festival<00:05:15.580> that<00:05:16.120> I<00:05:16.180> mentioned<00:05:16.480> is<00:05:16.810> the

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:17.530 
fitness festival that I mentioned is the

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:19.230 
fitness festival that I mentioned is the
fact<00:05:17.770> that<00:05:17.890> we<00:05:18.130> really<00:05:18.400> didn't<00:05:18.670> get<00:05:18.790> a<00:05:18.850> ton<00:05:19.210> of

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:19.240 
fact that we really didn't get a ton of

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:20.910 
fact that we really didn't get a ton of
work<00:05:19.480> in<00:05:19.750> so<00:05:19.990> I<00:05:20.020> think<00:05:20.140> we<00:05:20.440> ended<00:05:20.620> up<00:05:20.860> doing

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:20.920 
work in so I think we ended up doing

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.700 
work in so I think we ended up doing
probably<00:05:21.880> somewhere<00:05:22.660> between<00:05:22.720> eight<00:05:23.350> to<00:05:23.410> nine

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:23.710 
probably somewhere between eight to nine

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.550 
probably somewhere between eight to nine
sets<00:05:24.130> of<00:05:24.340> bench<00:05:24.640> press<00:05:25.000> each<00:05:25.270> and<00:05:25.660> that's

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:26.560 
sets of bench press each and that's

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.620 
sets of bench press each and that's
really<00:05:26.740> all<00:05:27.190> we<00:05:27.280> did<00:05:27.580> we<00:05:27.790> didn't<00:05:28.000> do<00:05:28.120> any<00:05:28.360> other

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:28.630 
really all we did we didn't do any other

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:30.090 
really all we did we didn't do any other
accessory<00:05:29.020> work<00:05:29.380> just<00:05:29.620> because<00:05:29.740> we<00:05:30.010> were

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:30.100 
accessory work just because we were

short on time already we were hungry the

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.530 
short on time already we were hungry the
gym<00:05:32.740> was<00:05:32.890> closing<00:05:33.370> just<00:05:33.910> didn't<00:05:34.180> really<00:05:34.270> work
