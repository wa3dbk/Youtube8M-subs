00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:16.859
 we are in the year 2070 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.859
 I just turned 50 

00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:22.170
 but my appearance 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.170
 this someone of 85 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.829
 serious kidney problems why type 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:31.849
 very little water 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:33.380
 I think it's not here 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.520
 Little time 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.570
 today 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.100
 I am one of the oldest people in this society 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.230
 I remember when I was five years old 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.990
 everything was very different 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:51.440
 also many trees in the parks 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.440
 the houses had beautiful gardens 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.549
 and if I could enjoy a bath 

00:00:57.549 --> 00:01:00.569
 want or half-low of the many pure one hour 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.670
 now 506 of ore have not been darkened to clean the skin 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.150
 all those women showed 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.150
 her beautiful hair 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.070
 from the map I'm not the head to keep it clean sincere 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.720
 before my father used to water the car with the water that came out of a hose 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.770
 today children do not believe that the opposition and sabha that way 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.980
 I remember that there were many announcements that decide 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:36.760
 take care of the water 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.810
 just that nobody else 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.009
 they thought that the water could never be finished 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.160
 now 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.900
 all rivers 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:48.850
 dams 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:54.210
 lagoons and in aquifers is the GDP should simply contaminated or 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.890
 exhausted 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.250
 immense deserts constitute the country there is a single day everywhere 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.820
 gastrointestinal infections diseases of the skin and of the 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.270
 association arias are the main causes of death 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:14.309
 the industry is paralyzed 

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:16.099
 and unemployment 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:18.759
 it's more than cook 

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:23.079
 Sami Saad factories hours are the main source of employment 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:24.759
 and they pay you 

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:26.669
 with drinking water 

00:02:26.669 --> 00:02:29.599
 instead he added 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:33.730
 Assaults by a water can are common in deserted streets 

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:38.659
 the community is percent synthetic 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:46.239
 before the amount of water indicated as ideal to drink identical eight glasses 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:47.519
 newspapers per day 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:49.359
 for an adult 

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:50.649
 today 

00:02:50.649 --> 00:02:52.389
 I can only lose 

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:55.539
 medium term 

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:58.049
 the clothes are disposable 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:01.069
 what increases the amount of garbage 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:05.599
 we had to go back to the blind wells or septic tanks like the last century 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:09.739
 because sewer networks can not be used due to lack of water 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:13.989
 the appearance of the population 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:16.149
 shields 

00:03:16.149 --> 00:03:17.639
 bodies of deceased 

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:20.639
 2 lawyers for the president always 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:23.590
 since then and until it refers 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.590
 by the ultraviolet Uruguayans who do not have the ozone layer that the 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.590
 they filtered in the atmosphere 

00:03:31.429 --> 00:03:35.800
 because of the dryness of the skin, a young woman of 20 years old 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.899
 as if he had 40 

00:03:38.899 --> 00:03:41.899
 Scientists investigate 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:44.829
 there is no possible solution 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:47.859
 music can make water 

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:52.819
 oxygen is also gained due to lack of trees, which decreased the 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:54.489
 intelligence quotient 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:57.799
 of the new generations 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:02.189
 altered the morphology of the esther matos solidity of many individuals 

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:05.219
 due 

00:04:05.219 --> 00:04:11.040
 there are many boys with inadequacies mutations inge formations 

00:04:12.219 --> 00:04:13.809
 government 

00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:16.779
 He even charges us for the air we breathe 

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:20.799
 137 cubic meters per day per inhabitant and adult 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:26.069
 there are people who can not pay is removed from the area are thrown 

00:04:26.069 --> 00:04:30.909
 that are equipped with gigantic mechanical lungs that work with 

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:32.569
 solar energy 

00:04:32.569 --> 00:04:34.639
 They are not of good quality 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:37.599
 but you can breathe 

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:39.009
 the average age 

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:42.159
 what is 35 years 

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:47.119
 in some countries there were patches of vegetation with their respective video 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.780
 which is heavily guarded by the army 

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:56.870
 if it were a treasure much coveted more than gold the diamonds 

00:04:58.529 --> 00:05:00.159
 here instead 

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:01.729
 there's no trees 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:03.229
 because almost 

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:05.909
 never rain 

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:08.990
 and when I did record a rainfall 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:12.009
 I am I hated city 

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:15.499
 when my daughter asks me to talk to her about when I was young 

00:05:15.499 --> 00:05:18.580
 I write you how beautiful it was in the woods 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.370
 She asks me 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:23.409
 because water is proposed 

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:26.409
 So I feel a lump in the throat 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:31.289
 I can not stop feeling guilty 

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:35.139
 because I belong to the generation that ended up destroying the environment 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:37.189
 possibly 

00:05:37.189 --> 00:05:39.210
 we do not take into account 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:41.800
 so many notices 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:42.969
 now 

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:44.600
 our children pay 

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.550
 a high price 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:49.229
 I sincerely believe that life on earth 

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:52.060
 It will not be possible in very little time 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:54.400
 because the destruction of the environment 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:55.360
 He said 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.360
 to an irreversible point 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:04.789
 I would like to go back and do 

00:06:04.789 --> 00:06:07.699
 stillness humanity 

00:06:07.699 --> 00:06:10.199
 understood this 

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:13.080
 when everything was done we could do something 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:14.599
 to save 

00:06:14.599 --> 00:06:17.999
 our planet 

00:06:17.999 --> 00:06:19.520
 to show 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:23.639
 there was a moment to another 

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:30.669
 it has helped me for nothing there was no one min 

00:06:52.240 --> 00:07:07.180
 but now a threat now real was high 

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:07.879
 like now
