00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.850
 hello welcome to the graphic soup channel 

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:09.180
 this time I bring you an unpacked 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:13.519
 the nvidia geforce city graphics card 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:16.800
 720 manufacturing tvg this is a model 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:21.679
 2014 is a graph now range 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:25.349
 medium-low with 2 gb of memory ddr3 

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:30.960
 running at 1600 megahertz while 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:34.040
 the gpu reaches 797 megahertz 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:37.230
 It has a 64-bit memory interface 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:41.449
 you do not need a high power source 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:45.989
 just 300 watts has an hdmi port 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:48.150
 with a vga entry is not compatible with 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:52.360
 blu-ray for this function does not 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:54.940
 I recommend even for movies or videos 4k 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:59.180
 or games with all the benefits or is 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:01.730
 say in full resolution 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.950
 well from my experience with the card 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.590
 barely a month I was disappointed that 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:09.860
 apparently the game is closed 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:13.070
 gta 5 after playing about 10 or 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:15.160
 30 minutes and this is something very annoying and 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.680
 apparently it is because of its low capacity 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:20.570
 I've learned that there are expensive cards 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.430
 that bring only one gigabyte of memory and 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.910
 work better than memories 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:28.550
 that bring 2 and 4 gigas of 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:30.890
 memories do not be fooled if they are 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:34.160
 looking for a good graphic dora and they 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:36.649
 offer one of a modest price and not very 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:39.500
 expensive to probably so be your 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:41.660
 performance even bring 2 to 4 gigas 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.670
 of memory always search and read 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:46.880
 inquire there will always be someone who already 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.920
 have bought and give their opinion but 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.259
 out of this is a very good card 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.050
 It helps a lot to solve the problems 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:56.149
 of pasting the operating system and it's a 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:02:00.200
 good investment if what you are looking for is a 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:02.450
 average speed in web browsing if 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.470
 what I need is the rendering of 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.140
 video 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:10.250
 and high resolution gamer performance 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:13.190
 this card is not for you it's not going very 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:17.360
 ok with a game is a latest model 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:19.430
 so to speak but if it will help you a lot 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:23.680
 with eggs of about two or three years 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:27.310
 back well, well, here I have shown you 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.310
 how is the box 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:34.170
 well here I show you what the 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:37.110
 box inside 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:40.140
 the price of this card ranges from 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:43.200
 the 190 thousand and the 220 thousand pesos 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:45.410
 Colombians I insist that they do not leave 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.410
 cheat 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:58.390
 here we have what is inside the 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.390
 box 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.020
 well this side is not 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.019
 here we have 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:26.220
 what is the graph 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:29.549
 It's a pretty small card in 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:33.470
 size compared to other graphics is 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:39.629
 Half the size is quite small 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:43.010
 but this is a plus point if your cpu 

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:43.010
 board is small too 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:55.200
 they have a double bag that is a detail 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:58.830
 to highlight and well here we have what it is 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:03.130
 the card with a vga port and a port 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:06.080
 hdmi the other is a port for 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:08.950
 television or something like that actually not 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.950
 I am very sure 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:23.800
 here the heat sink that is 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:26.520
 pretty simple and its micro 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.520
 components 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:32.129
 his envy remark 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:37.360
 very well 

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:52.800
 here we have the dora graphic card 

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:58.940
 issues 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:58.940
 parts that secure the work card 

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:10.040
 are two look at each other 

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:17.169
 well this is all that is inside of 

00:05:14.379 --> 00:05:20.069
 the box is the screw too but not 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:20.069
 I'm going to show you 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:31.640
 well I want to finish making a 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:35.680
 comparison of this card with the 

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:38.660
 gta 5 game requirements in cura corts 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:41.690
 Take care of corts is like the amount of 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:45.230
 cores that has a graphics card is 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:47.840
 similar to charters and that's what it does 

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:49.840
 that the graph is now powerful is to me 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:53.040
 point of view a more important fact 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:56.550
 that the gigas of memory 

00:05:53.040 --> 00:06:03.780
 well the gta 5 needs a minimum 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:07.770
 geforce gt 980 card that has 112 q 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:10.470
 da corts we remember that you need like 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:12.660
 minimum this card but guys I'll 

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:15.900
 I assure you that this card is only going to 

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:18.990
 start and you will not be able to play the game 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:23.010
 it's going to close late that early 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:29.850
 and the card that gta recommends for the 

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:35.340
 game gta 5 is the nvidia gtx 660 of 2 gb 

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:37.350
 this card has 960 q gives corts and you 

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:39.680
 I assure you that you can play very well with 

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:43.350
 this card plus you can 

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:46.800
 develop and perform better in your 

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:47.580
 activities on your pc and now the question 

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:50.190
 is 

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:54.960
 you know how many caring corts have 

00:06:50.190 --> 00:07:00.000
 the geforce nvidia 17 20 

00:06:54.960 --> 00:07:02.280
 has only 192 hp of corso 

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.430
 card that I would recommend although there 

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:07.770
 quite controversial about it would be the 

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:14.220
 that I am about to acquire nvidia 

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:18.330
 geforce gtx 970 this one has in 1664 cuda 

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:20.289
 corts with a price of 970 thousand pesos 

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:24.180
 Colombians 

00:07:20.289 --> 00:07:24.180
 It is an excellent card 

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:29.480
 I will show you photos of the product while 

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:31.310
 I say goodbye please like that 

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:34.340
 would help a lot to be able to continue 

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:36.980
 sharing material so subscribe 

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:39.530
 comment if you would like to see another boxing 

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:43.430
 or unpacking some product or 

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:46.310
 some card and share if you have 

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:48.520
 liked David and even the
