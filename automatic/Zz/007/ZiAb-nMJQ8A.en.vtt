00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
place the saucer bricks on top of the

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.850 
place the saucer bricks on top of the
head<00:01:17.960> now<00:01:18.960> I'm<00:01:19.110> not<00:01:19.290> sure<00:01:19.320> if<00:01:19.440> it's<00:01:19.620> called<00:01:19.800> a

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
head now I'm not sure if it's called a

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.260 
head now I'm not sure if it's called a
saucer<00:01:20.070> bricks<00:01:20.400> with<00:01:20.550> right<00:01:20.730> in<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.880> comments

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
saucer bricks with right in the comments

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.550 
saucer bricks with right in the comments
below<00:01:21.390> what<00:01:21.900> they<00:01:22.050> are<00:01:22.610> just<00:01:23.610> like<00:01:23.760> that<00:01:24.560> now

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
below what they are just like that now

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.870 
below what they are just like that now
you're<00:01:25.770> going<00:01:25.950> to<00:01:26.010> take<00:01:26.160> your<00:01:26.310> nozzle<00:01:26.670> bricks

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
you're going to take your nozzle bricks

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.000 
you're going to take your nozzle bricks
and<00:01:27.150> you're<00:01:27.240> going<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.510> place<00:01:27.840> them<00:01:28.140> in<00:01:28.170> we

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.010 
and you're going to place them in we

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:30.950 
and you're going to place them in we
have<00:01:29.130> to<00:01:29.250> press<00:01:29.850> down<00:01:29.880> until<00:01:30.420> they<00:01:30.510> click<00:01:30.750> like

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
have to press down until they click like

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.660 
have to press down until they click like
that<00:01:31.200> so<00:01:31.740> there's<00:01:31.950> very<00:01:32.160> little<00:01:32.340> space

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
that so there's very little space

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.390 
that so there's very little space
between<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.150> top<00:01:33.330> of<00:01:33.480> the<00:01:33.570> dish<00:01:34.560> and<00:01:34.890> the

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
between the top of the dish and the

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:42.560 
between the top of the dish and the
actual<00:01:35.700> nozzle<00:01:36.150> and<00:01:36.540> do<00:01:37.110> it<00:01:37.290> again<00:01:41.480> so<00:01:42.480> they

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
actual nozzle and do it again so they

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.180 
actual nozzle and do it again so they
should<00:01:42.780> look<00:01:42.900> like<00:01:42.960> this<00:01:43.290> move<00:01:43.860> these<00:01:44.040> aside

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:44.190 
should look like this move these aside

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.080 
should look like this move these aside
bring<00:01:45.030> back<00:01:45.240> this<00:01:46.200> now<00:01:46.860> take<00:01:47.130> your<00:01:47.400> 1<00:01:47.760> by<00:01:47.910> 1

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
bring back this now take your 1 by 1

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.010 
bring back this now take your 1 by 1
cylinder<00:01:49.130> place<00:01:50.130> it<00:01:50.310> on<00:01:50.430> top

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
cylinder place it on top

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.370 
cylinder place it on top
now<00:01:52.020> take<00:01:52.680> your<00:01:52.800> streetlamp<00:01:54.200> you're<00:01:55.200> going<00:01:55.320> to

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
now take your streetlamp you're going to

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.730 
now take your streetlamp you're going to
put<00:01:55.530> it<00:01:55.620> on<00:01:55.910> that<00:01:56.910> now<00:01:57.840> make<00:01:58.170> sure<00:01:58.320> that<00:01:58.440> you're

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
put it on that now make sure that you're

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.850 
put it on that now make sure that you're
they're<00:01:59.070> parallel<00:01:59.550> to<00:01:59.610> one<00:01:59.880> another<00:02:00.860> making

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
they're parallel to one another making

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.550 
they're parallel to one another making
sure<00:02:02.340> that<00:02:02.700> they're<00:02:03.770> just<00:02:04.770> right<00:02:05.100> place<00:02:06.560> lamps

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
sure that they're just right place lamps

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.080 
sure that they're just right place lamps
on<00:02:08.310> either<00:02:08.700> side

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
on either side

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.979 
on either side
now<00:02:11.970> this<00:02:12.970> is<00:02:13.150> what<00:02:13.300> your<00:02:13.420> street<00:02:13.630> lamp<00:02:13.870> should

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989 
now this is what your street lamp should

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:15.089 
now this is what your street lamp should
come<00:02:14.200> out<00:02:14.230> to<00:02:14.470> look<00:02:14.560> like<00:02:14.680> it's<00:02:14.980> actually

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099 
come out to look like it's actually

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:16.589 
come out to look like it's actually
quite<00:02:15.489> tall<00:02:15.700> so<00:02:15.730> it's<00:02:16.030> hard<00:02:16.180> to<00:02:16.270> show<00:02:16.390> it<00:02:16.510> on

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599 
quite tall so it's hard to show it on

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:18.870 
quite tall so it's hard to show it on
