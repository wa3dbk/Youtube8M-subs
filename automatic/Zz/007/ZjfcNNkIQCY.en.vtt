00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.440
 the artist who was as a player does not 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.800
 it needs to be explained 

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:12.740
 and he showed it for so many years 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.900
 let's say what I always said 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.410
 the forward for being forward 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:20.110
 before Palermo and before the current 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:23.560
 of mouth juniors 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:25.900
 optimism is something that trust 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.180
 that you have to create yourself is very 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.710
 important because one after the 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.150
 confidence but you have to do it yourself 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.980
 create 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.350
 and when one is convinced of something what 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.949
 ends up achieving 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.980
 and being one of the qualities that I had 

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:43.920
 I had a martyr 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.329
 when they arrive like to focus foxx 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.860
 Well, he said he does not have the equipment 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.970
 confirmed not even the 18 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.300
 concentrated for the game on Sunday 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:54.150
 I ask you a little more an analysis of 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:57.010
 championship as it evaluates the mouth level 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:59.559
 up to this point 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:03.609
 that you tell me you the question seems 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:05.500
 something similar we talked about why not 

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:09.520
 you were improving you said it was because 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:12.399
 I knew how to listen long ago and I 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:16.049
 My point is that if we nasa rÃ pita 

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:16.049
 we were losing against you against the river 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.400
 against rosaries and a very party 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.230
 right we had to have defined 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.970
 the 15 points second time in the 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:25.090
 rosary court and today we see where it is 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.189
 rosary beads 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.990
 cons the lorenzo inheritance if we won 

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:31.570
 in a problem class against colom 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.429
 also against the quilmes also if I 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.909
 what I say if there is so much possibility of 

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:40.229
 that we the parties want to say 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:42.909
 that we play better than the opponent does not 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:46.030
 maybe as I say we always sin of the 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:47.259
 little lack of effectiveness because if we create 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.409
 the goal situations and not the 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:53.649
 concretely makes the result be 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:55.420
 so that they know tie say let's 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:57.340
 according to the mouth level not me 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.590
 never one one is always satisfied 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.000
 think that you have to give much more is 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.399
 one logical thing you can say is not 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.439
 confuse as the soccer player one 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:07.460
 when it reaches a certain level it thinks 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:10.190
 that can give a little more 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:14.000
 and the team has to think like that I think 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:15.620
 that I see the ball possession of the 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.780
 last games and it's us who 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.450
 we have the position of the ball 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.880
 we are the ones who say 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.700
 we create so many situations or more than the 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.530
 adversary is what concretize them makes 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.480
 a team is here a result and you 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.489
 he believes himself responsible or is responsible 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.980
 when mouth plays badly if I feel 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:35.750
 very, very responsible, I think that 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.790
 every technician feels responsible 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:41.200
 when your team does not play well or not 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.200
 play as he pretends
