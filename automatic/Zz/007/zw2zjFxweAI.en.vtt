hopefully<00:00:42.090> win<00:00:42.540> both<00:00:43.050> of<00:00:43.230> them<00:00:43.350> out<00:00:43.530> I<00:00:43.559> think

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
hopefully win both of them out I think

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.010 
hopefully win both of them out I think
it's<00:00:44.010> unlikely<00:00:44.160> I<00:00:44.700> said<00:00:44.940> this<00:00:45.480> year<00:00:45.809> here's

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
it's unlikely I said this year here's

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.479 
it's unlikely I said this year here's
one<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.289> Giro<00:00:46.590> so<00:00:46.860> I'd<00:00:46.980> say<00:00:47.160> that<00:00:47.340> it's

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
one the Giro so I'd say that it's

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.819 
one the Giro so I'd say that it's
possible<00:00:47.879> and<00:00:48.329> after<00:00:48.570> 15<00:00:48.960> days<00:00:48.989> of<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.620> Giro

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
possible and after 15 days of the Giro

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.889 
possible and after 15 days of the Giro
d'Italia<00:00:50.219> I<00:00:50.579> said<00:00:50.789> to<00:00:50.910> myself<00:00:51.059> he'll<00:00:51.629> do<00:00:51.870> the

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
d'Italia I said to myself he'll do the

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.229 
d'Italia I said to myself he'll do the
double<00:00:52.289> in<00:00:52.410> probably<00:00:52.980> think<00:00:53.760> it's<00:00:53.940> really

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
double in probably think it's really

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.869 
double in probably think it's really
possible<00:00:54.270> for<00:00:54.690> cantera<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.350> do<00:00:55.469> it<00:00:55.879> because

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
possible for cantera to do it because

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.729 
possible for cantera to do it because
I'm<00:00:57.239> not<00:00:57.360> sure<00:00:57.570> he<00:00:57.629> did<00:00:57.840> that<00:00:58.050> many<00:00:58.500> efforts

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
I'm not sure he did that many efforts

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.639 
I'm not sure he did that many efforts
during<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.370> Giro<00:00:59.730> to<00:00:59.940> win<00:01:00.090> it<00:01:00.239> he<00:01:00.989> only<00:01:01.410> had

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
during the Giro to win it he only had

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.990 
during the Giro to win it he only had
like<00:01:01.829> two<00:01:01.890> guys<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.609> look<00:01:02.730> at<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:04.519> the<00:01:05.519> rivals

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
like two guys to look at and the rivals

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.750 
like two guys to look at and the rivals
were<00:01:06.180> not<00:01:06.450> that<00:01:06.570> strong<00:01:06.920> certainly<00:01:07.920> can<00:01:08.250> but

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
were not that strong certainly can but

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.530 
were not that strong certainly can but
in<00:01:09.360> my<00:01:09.810> opinion<00:01:10.020> is<00:01:10.830> not<00:01:11.640> going<00:01:11.880> to<00:01:12.060> win<00:01:12.360> the

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
in my opinion is not going to win the

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.170 
in my opinion is not going to win the
tool<00:01:12.720> for<00:01:13.110> me<00:01:13.229> with<00:01:13.439> this<00:01:13.650> far<00:01:13.950> cool<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.580> for

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
tool for me with this far cool and for

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.630 
tool for me with this far cool and for
Contador<00:01:15.780> is<00:01:16.020> going<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:16.799> be<00:01:16.890> very<00:01:17.009> difficult<00:01:17.189> i

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
Contador is going to be very difficult i

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.149 
Contador is going to be very difficult i
remember<00:01:18.000> for<00:01:18.180> years<00:01:18.299> ago<00:01:18.780> he<00:01:19.290> won<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.590> Giro

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
remember for years ago he won the Giro

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.990 
remember for years ago he won the Giro
but<00:01:20.369> he<00:01:20.610> arrived<00:01:21.000> only<00:01:21.240> 15<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.080> tour<00:01:22.430> so<00:01:23.430> in<00:01:23.790> my

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
but he arrived only 15 the tour so in my

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.060 
but he arrived only 15 the tour so in my
opinion<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.479> double<00:01:25.049> freema<00:01:25.439> will<00:01:25.920> be

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
opinion the double freema will be

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.640 
opinion the double freema will be
complicated<00:01:26.869> some<00:01:27.869> different<00:01:28.259> points<00:01:28.530> of

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
complicated some different points of

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.530 
complicated some different points of
view<00:01:28.860> then<00:01:29.130> but<00:01:29.400> there<00:01:29.549> was<00:01:29.670> no<00:01:29.909> doubting<00:01:30.450> the

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
view then but there was no doubting the

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.330 
view then but there was no doubting the
nature<00:01:30.869> of<00:01:30.900> Contador's<00:01:31.500> victory<00:01:31.979> at<00:01:32.280> the

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
nature of Contador's victory at the

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.359 
nature of Contador's victory at the
gtalk<00:01:32.909> i<00:01:33.409> think<00:01:34.409> it<00:01:34.470> was<00:01:34.560> usually<00:01:34.920> impressive

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
gtalk i think it was usually impressive

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.399 
gtalk i think it was usually impressive
from<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.670> point<00:01:35.820> of<00:01:35.939> view<00:01:36.000> that<00:01:36.180> his<00:01:36.960> team<00:01:37.200> was

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
from the point of view that his team was

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.550 
from the point of view that his team was
very<00:01:37.650> poor<00:01:38.780> you<00:01:39.780> know<00:01:39.840> we<00:01:39.960> certainly<00:01:40.200> expected

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
very poor you know we certainly expected

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.830 
very poor you know we certainly expected
a<00:01:40.650> stronger<00:01:41.040> performance<00:01:41.189> from<00:01:41.610> tinkov<00:01:42.060> so<00:01:42.659> he

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
a stronger performance from tinkov so he

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.630 
a stronger performance from tinkov so he
found<00:01:43.020> himself<00:01:43.170> isolated<00:01:43.920> on<00:01:44.040> most<00:01:44.369> of<00:01:44.520> the

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
found himself isolated on most of the

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.450 
found himself isolated on most of the
final<00:01:45.000> clients<00:01:45.360> in<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.509> Giro<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:46.049> and<00:01:47.040> he

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
final clients in the Giro and and he

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.660 
final clients in the Giro and and he
really<00:01:48.530> he<00:01:49.530> took<00:01:49.770> everything<00:01:50.009> that<00:01:50.159> asana

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
really he took everything that asana

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.910 
really he took everything that asana
could<00:01:50.880> throw<00:01:51.090> at<00:01:51.270> him<00:01:51.479> there<00:01:52.409> was<00:01:52.500> only<00:01:52.590> one

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
could throw at him there was only one

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.649 
could throw at him there was only one
stage<00:01:53.430> where<00:01:54.000> he<00:01:54.060> was<00:01:54.149> in<00:01:54.270> any<00:01:54.450> real

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
too deep and survived that scare well I

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.080 
too deep and survived that scare well I
must<00:02:09.720> confess<00:02:09.959> that<00:02:10.250> Contador<00:02:11.250> victories<00:02:11.910> in

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
must confess that Contador victories in

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.130 
must confess that Contador victories in
the<00:02:12.209> Giro<00:02:12.450> it's<00:02:12.660> ringing

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
the Giro it's ringing

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.330 
the Giro it's ringing
presently<00:02:14.720> especially<00:02:15.720> because<00:02:16.110> he<00:02:16.980> didn't

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
presently especially because he didn't

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.510 
presently especially because he didn't
need<00:02:17.490> to<00:02:17.550> show<00:02:17.910> his<00:02:18.420> best<00:02:19.069> performances<00:02:20.069> in<00:02:20.280> my

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
need to show his best performances in my

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.330 
need to show his best performances in my
opinion<00:02:20.970> to<00:02:21.360> win<00:02:21.870> this<00:02:22.110> Giro<00:02:22.500> and<00:02:22.770> also

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
opinion to win this Giro and also

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.990 
opinion to win this Giro and also
because<00:02:23.670> if<00:02:23.970> FEMA<00:02:24.600> was<00:02:25.530> not<00:02:26.160> really<00:02:26.580> strong

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
because if FEMA was not really strong

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.300 
because if FEMA was not really strong
especially<00:02:27.330> in<00:02:27.660> the<00:02:27.780> climes<00:02:28.110> so<00:02:28.830> yes<00:02:29.069> he's

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
especially in the climes so yes he's

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.480 
especially in the climes so yes he's
impressing<00:02:29.910> me<00:02:30.320> and<00:02:31.320> if<00:02:31.560> the<00:02:31.680> double<00:02:32.010> is<00:02:32.160> on

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
impressing me and if the double is on

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.580 
impressing me and if the double is on
for<00:02:32.760> Contador<00:02:33.240> where<00:02:33.810> would<00:02:33.959> that<00:02:34.020> place<00:02:34.410> him

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
for Contador where would that place him

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.080 
for Contador where would that place him
among<00:02:34.680> those<00:02:35.010> who've<00:02:35.340> achieved<00:02:35.459> the<00:02:35.910> feat

among those who've achieved the feat

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.460 
among those who've achieved the feat
already

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
already

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.800 
already
there<00:02:39.160> has<00:02:39.310> been<00:02:39.550> a<00:02:39.580> lot<00:02:39.850> of<00:02:39.910> talk<00:02:40.270> about<00:02:40.540> it

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
there has been a lot of talk about it

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.770 
there has been a lot of talk about it
people<00:02:41.590> say<00:02:41.860> it's<00:02:42.280> quite<00:02:42.520> rare<00:02:42.730> because<00:02:43.480> it

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
people say it's quite rare because it

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.900 
people say it's quite rare because it
hasn't<00:02:43.960> been<00:02:44.230> done<00:02:44.290> for<00:02:44.770> for<00:02:45.460> quite<00:02:45.670> a<00:02:45.700> few

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
hasn't been done for for quite a few

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.570 
hasn't been done for for quite a few
years<00:02:46.180> since<00:02:46.870> pant<00:02:47.140> any<00:02:47.350> but<00:02:48.100> if<00:02:48.220> you<00:02:48.400> take

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
years since pant any but if you take

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.880 
years since pant any but if you take
history<00:02:49.300> of<00:02:49.510> cycling<00:02:49.900> as<00:02:50.020> a<00:02:50.050> whole<00:02:50.260> it's<00:02:50.530> not

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
history of cycling as a whole it's not

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.220 
history of cycling as a whole it's not
that<00:02:51.040> rare<00:02:51.280> I<00:02:51.550> mean<00:02:51.880> I<00:02:52.090> think<00:02:52.330> there<00:02:52.510> have<00:02:53.020> been

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
that rare I mean I think there have been

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.220 
that rare I mean I think there have been
like<00:02:53.410> 12<00:02:53.980> doubles<00:02:54.550> in<00:02:54.760> the<00:02:54.910> in<00:02:55.090> the<00:02:55.120> history<00:02:55.510> by

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
like 12 doubles in the in the history by

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.290 
like 12 doubles in the in the history by
seven<00:02:56.590> different<00:02:56.620> riders<00:02:57.160> in<00:02:57.700> the<00:02:57.760> range<00:02:58.030> ed

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
seven different riders in the range ed

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.810 
seven different riders in the range ed
twice<00:02:58.570> and<00:02:59.070> so<00:03:00.070> I<00:03:00.100> think<00:03:00.190> it's<00:03:00.610> really

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
twice and so I think it's really

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.820 
twice and so I think it's really
possible<00:03:00.940> for<00:03:01.360> consider<00:03:01.840> to<00:03:02.020> do<00:03:02.170> it<00:03:02.290> the

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
possible for consider to do it the

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:07.110 
possible for consider to do it the
maximum<00:03:03.250> level<00:03:03.400> is<00:03:04.150> max<00:03:04.630> he<00:03:05.290> won<00:03:05.890> 11<00:03:06.580> grand

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
maximum level is max he won 11 grand

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.440 
maximum level is max he won 11 grand
tools<00:03:07.420> but<00:03:07.750> only<00:03:08.590> one<00:03:08.770> word<00:03:09.010> for<00:03:09.280> example<00:03:09.700> 5<00:03:10.090> 20

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
and 50 new one well that in victorious

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.140 
and 50 new one well that in victorious
of<00:03:13.030> Contador<00:03:13.780> are<00:03:14.110> more<00:03:14.800> shared<00:03:15.250> in<00:03:15.640> the<00:03:15.880> three

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
of Contador are more shared in the three

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.010 
of Contador are more shared in the three
different<00:03:16.600> grant<00:03:17.200> tools<00:03:17.610> and<00:03:18.610> will<00:03:19.209> double<00:03:19.750> in

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:20.020 
different grant tools and will double in

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.070 
different grant tools and will double in
my<00:03:20.290> opinion<00:03:20.650> it<00:03:21.130> could<00:03:21.459> be<00:03:21.730> considered<00:03:22.480> for

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080 
my opinion it could be considered for

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:28.350 
my opinion it could be considered for
the<00:03:23.770> grand<00:03:24.040> tool<00:03:24.930> at<00:03:25.930> the<00:03:26.200> level<00:03:26.560> of<00:03:26.700> Mercer<00:03:27.700> in

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
the grand tool at the level of Mercer in

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.520 
the grand tool at the level of Mercer in
or<00:03:28.660> in<00:03:29.140> line<00:03:29.790> with<00:03:30.790> the<00:03:31.090> double<00:03:31.570> more<00:03:32.410> or<00:03:32.500> less

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
or in line with the double more or less

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.460 
or in line with the double more or less
the<00:03:32.800> same<00:03:32.830> level<00:03:33.250> l<00:03:33.520> and<00:03:34.020> we<00:03:35.020> have<00:03:35.110> also<00:03:35.260> to

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
the same level l and we have also to

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.310 
the same level l and we have also to
remember<00:03:36.100> that<00:03:36.310> if<00:03:36.550> it<00:03:36.910> is<00:03:37.480> going<00:03:37.870> to<00:03:38.020> win<00:03:38.170> the

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:38.320 
remember that if it is going to win the

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.370 
remember that if it is going to win the
tour<00:03:38.530> I<00:03:39.060> can<00:03:40.060> I<00:03:40.209> think<00:03:40.570> that<00:03:40.780> a<00:03:40.810> really<00:03:41.200> good

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.040 
tour I can I think that a really good
thing<00:03:41.410> to<00:03:41.830> go<00:03:42.040> to<00:03:42.070> alpha<00:03:42.640> house<00:03:43.540> the<00:03:43.690> doll<00:03:43.840> will

thing to go to alpha house the doll will

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:46.050 
thing to go to alpha house the doll will
face<00:03:44.290> stiff<00:03:44.530> opposition<00:03:44.680> at<00:03:45.430> the<00:03:45.550> tour<00:03:45.760> than

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
face stiff opposition at the tour than

00:05:17.559 --> 00:05:17.569 
also on Alberto yeah it's difficult to

00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:19.059

timer right now and it's esteem is quite

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:42.730 
timer right now and it's esteem is quite
strong<00:05:40.599> so<00:05:41.599> what<00:05:41.900> you<00:05:42.020> won't<00:05:42.199> lose<00:05:42.349> that<00:05:42.529> much

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:42.740 
strong so what you won't lose that much

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:44.439 
strong so what you won't lose that much

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:47.330
