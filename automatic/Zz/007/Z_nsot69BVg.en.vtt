00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
that's good enough for me but that's not

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.690 
that's good enough for me but that's not
to<00:00:45.329> say<00:00:45.539> that<00:00:45.809> I<00:00:46.559> haven't<00:00:46.920> seen<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.340> practical

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
to say that I haven't seen the practical

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.490 
to say that I haven't seen the practical
benefits<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:48.210> applications<00:00:48.719> of<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:48.960> ipad<00:00:49.379> it

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
benefits and applications of the ipad it

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.150 
benefits and applications of the ipad it
is<00:00:49.649> actually<00:00:49.980> very<00:00:50.219> very<00:00:50.850> good<00:00:51.149> and<00:00:51.980> one<00:00:52.980> thing

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
is actually very very good and one thing

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.340 
is actually very very good and one thing
I<00:00:53.219> will<00:00:53.280> say<00:00:53.460> is<00:00:53.879> although<00:00:54.180> yeah<00:00:54.899> technically

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
I will say is although yeah technically

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.970 
I will say is although yeah technically
I<00:00:55.440> suppose<00:00:55.590> it<00:00:55.860> is<00:00:55.980> just<00:00:56.489> a<00:00:56.699> larger<00:00:57.739> iphone<00:00:58.739> or

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
I suppose it is just a larger iphone or

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.130 
I suppose it is just a larger iphone or
ipod<00:00:59.250> touch<00:00:59.460> but<00:00:59.820> so<00:01:00.300> too<00:01:00.359> are<00:01:00.600> all<00:01:00.960> the

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
ipod touch but so too are all the

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.170 
ipod touch but so too are all the
Android<00:01:01.620> tablets<00:01:02.160> versus<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.850> android

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
Android tablets versus the android

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.210 
Android tablets versus the android
phones<00:01:03.539> out<00:01:03.930> there<00:01:03.960> they're<00:01:04.739> basically<00:01:05.129> the

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
phones out there they're basically the

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.770

can into the consumer area already has

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:41.890 
can into the consumer area already has
over<00:03:40.320> two<00:03:40.650> million<00:03:40.830> of<00:03:40.980> them<00:03:41.100> so<00:03:41.250> of<00:03:41.310> course

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
over two million of them so of course

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.030 
over two million of them so of course
tablets<00:03:42.900> have<00:03:42.959> been<00:03:43.020> around<00:03:43.290> for<00:03:43.709> a<00:03:43.740> while<00:03:43.800> and

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
tablets have been around for a while and

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.110 
tablets have been around for a while and
this<00:03:44.160> is<00:03:44.310> the<00:03:44.400> first<00:03:44.430> one<00:03:44.790> that's<00:03:44.850> really

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
this is the first one that's really

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.020 
this is the first one that's really
cracked<00:03:45.390> the<00:03:45.510> consumer<00:03:45.810> market<00:03:45.870> and<00:03:47.030> really

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
cracked the consumer market and really

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.080 
cracked the consumer market and really
if<00:03:48.180> there's<00:03:48.390> a<00:03:48.480> few<00:03:48.750> things<00:03:49.170> I<00:03:49.350> didn't<00:03:49.650> like

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
if there's a few things I didn't like

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.640 
if there's a few things I didn't like

can't tether it to your phone there's no

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.430 
can't tether it to your phone there's no
real<00:03:53.070> file-sharing<00:03:54.000> to<00:03:54.270> speak<00:03:54.510> of<00:03:54.690> YZ<00:03:55.200> I<00:03:55.230> can't

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
real file-sharing to speak of YZ I can't

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:56.990 
real file-sharing to speak of YZ I can't
transfer<00:03:55.920> thing<00:03:56.190> connect<00:03:56.610> to<00:03:56.700> it<00:03:56.790> like<00:03:56.910> it

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
transfer thing connect to it like it

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.600 
transfer thing connect to it like it
yeah<00:03:57.239> I<00:03:57.300> got<00:03:57.330> that<00:03:57.810> I<00:03:57.870> don't<00:03:58.140> like<00:03:58.459> there<00:03:59.459> was

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
yeah I got that I don't like there was

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:03.290 
yeah I got that I don't like there was
no<00:04:00.950> this<00:04:01.950> obviously<00:04:02.250> is<00:04:02.340> no<00:04:02.430> cameras<00:04:02.940> which<00:04:03.180> is

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:03.300 
no this obviously is no cameras which is

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.800 
no this obviously is no cameras which is
a<00:04:03.330> big<00:04:03.510> drawback<00:04:03.930> how<00:04:04.620> perfect<00:04:05.220> would<00:04:05.430> it<00:04:05.580> be

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
a big drawback how perfect would it be

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.540 
a big drawback how perfect would it be
presumably<00:04:06.810> on<00:04:07.020> the<00:04:07.140> next<00:04:07.470> iPad<00:04:08.340> we<00:04:08.430> could

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:08.550 
presumably on the next iPad we could

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:09.800 
presumably on the next iPad we could
have<00:04:08.670> a<00:04:08.700> front<00:04:08.940> facing<00:04:08.970> camera<00:04:09.510> so<00:04:09.630> going<00:04:09.780> to

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
have a front facing camera so going to

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.720 
have a front facing camera so going to
be<00:04:09.900> able<00:04:09.989> to<00:04:10.140> do<00:04:10.260> the<00:04:10.560> facetime<00:04:11.220> which<00:04:11.489> we<00:04:11.610> now

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
be able to do the facetime which we now

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.050 
be able to do the facetime which we now
see<00:04:11.910> on<00:04:11.940> the<00:04:12.120> iphone<00:04:12.420> 4<00:04:13.100> presumably<00:04:14.100> hopefully

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
see on the iphone 4 presumably hopefully

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.330 
see on the iphone 4 presumably hopefully
they'll<00:04:15.239> get<00:04:15.360> that<00:04:15.540> sorted<00:04:15.840> over<00:04:16.169> a<00:04:16.310> 3g<00:04:17.310> or

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
they'll get that sorted over a 3g or

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.670 
they'll get that sorted over a 3g or
probably<00:04:17.820> future<00:04:18.270> 4g<00:04:18.750> network<00:04:19.109> which<00:04:19.500> would

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
probably future 4g network which would

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.310 
probably future 4g network which would
be<00:04:19.799> great<00:04:20.690> rather<00:04:21.690> than<00:04:21.750> just<00:04:21.930> over<00:04:22.140> Wi-Fi

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
be great rather than just over Wi-Fi

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.630 
be great rather than just over Wi-Fi
which<00:04:22.710> car<00:04:22.890> line<00:04:23.180> and<00:04:25.190> yeah<00:04:26.190> there's<00:04:26.400> a<00:04:26.460> few

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:26.640 
which car line and yeah there's a few

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.010 
which car line and yeah there's a few
things<00:04:26.850> that<00:04:27.090> i<00:04:27.120> would<00:04:27.270> like<00:04:27.390> to<00:04:27.540> see<00:04:27.690> would<00:04:27.900> be

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
things that i would like to see would be

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.880 
things that i would like to see would be
nice<00:04:28.169> actually<00:04:28.440> if<00:04:28.650> it<00:04:29.040> just<00:04:29.580> had<00:04:29.820> a<00:04:30.890> USB

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:31.890 
nice actually if it just had a USB

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:33.200 
nice actually if it just had a USB
connection<00:04:32.039> as<00:04:32.370> well<00:04:32.490> conventional<00:04:33.030> but

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
connection as well conventional but

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.080 
connection as well conventional but
these<00:04:34.050> are<00:04:34.200> small<00:04:34.440> gripes<00:04:34.770> overall<00:04:35.340> I<00:04:35.370> think

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
these are small gripes overall I think

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.540 
these are small gripes overall I think
definitely<00:04:36.830> the<00:04:37.830> other<00:04:38.010> thing<00:04:38.160> i'd<00:04:38.280> love<00:04:38.430> to

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
definitely the other thing i'd love to

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:39.770 
definitely the other thing i'd love to

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.740 
wouldn't it be great to have iMovie on
the<00:04:43.740> iPad<00:04:44.100> and<00:04:44.340> won't<00:04:44.460> be<00:04:44.550> perfect<00:04:44.880> to<00:04:45.240> edit

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
the iPad and won't be perfect to edit

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:47.150 
the iPad and won't be perfect to edit
video<00:04:45.990> on<00:04:46.139> that<00:04:46.169> I'm<00:04:46.470> sure<00:04:46.740> it's<00:04:46.949> only<00:04:47.130> a

matter of time it's known that I don't
things<00:04:49.080> any<00:04:49.229> great<00:04:49.530> need<00:04:49.889> for<00:04:50.270> iMovie<00:04:51.270> to<00:04:51.419> have

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
things any great need for iMovie to have

things any great need for iMovie to have
a<00:04:52.080> camera<00:04:52.830> on<00:04:53.100> the<00:04:53.280> device<00:04:53.490> that<00:04:53.520> it's<00:04:53.820> being

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
a camera on the device that it's being

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.090 
a camera on the device that it's being
used<00:04:54.060> on<00:04:54.449> so<00:04:54.750> there's<00:04:55.080> that's<00:04:55.620> not<00:04:55.860> to<00:04:55.949> say

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100 
used on so there's that's not to say

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:57.140 
used on so there's that's not to say
that<00:04:56.250> the<00:04:56.370> existing<00:04:56.699> light<00:04:56.820> pipe<00:04:57.030> is

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
that the existing light pipe is

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.270 
that the existing light pipe is
certainly<00:04:57.389> powerful<00:04:57.540> enough<00:04:57.990> be<00:04:58.680> great<00:04:59.010> to

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
certainly powerful enough be great to

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.300 
certainly powerful enough be great to
have<00:04:59.400> iMovie<00:04:59.910> that<00:05:00.090> would<00:05:00.240> be<00:05:00.360> fantastic<00:05:01.310> but

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310

have iMovie that would be fantastic but
that's<00:05:02.490> my<00:05:03.199> that's<00:05:04.199> my<00:05:04.350> opinion<00:05:04.710> on<00:05:04.979> the<00:05:05.130> ipad

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490
