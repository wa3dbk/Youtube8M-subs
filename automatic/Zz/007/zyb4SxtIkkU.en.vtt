00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.450
 my name is your placed in doha and criticize the last teacher aires 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.660
 obviously there will be available so if you want to see how bad it is 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:12.139
 this movie alone do not watch the video 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:15.949
 I always liked the series to be dishonest this movie the 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:17.429
 considered an insult 

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:19.029
 good let's start 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:22.239
 the story of the movie is the same as that of the series 

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:26.139
 katara and sokka found while they were fishing a frozen child in a 

00:00:26.139 --> 00:00:27.029
 inspection 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.980
 then they discover that the avatar is the only teacher who can control the 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.879
 four elements and that its duty is to stop a war that began a hundred years ago 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:35.770
 years 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.230
 very well the story is faithful 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.750
 the positive points are 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.870
 they are simply beautiful they are well made it is a pity that the address 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.220
 and the camera movement will not let see the days 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:49.719
 special effects 

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:53.899
 while they are not spectacular they look real it seems they really are 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:55.760
 controlling the 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.650
 and good soundtrack 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.360
 sure there is something more 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.710
 everything else is garbage 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.460
 performances are disgusting show the feelings of the characters 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.320
 the only actor who does a decent job that to a tour who played 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:13.180
 to country 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.180
 Noah Ringer shows him the hyperactivity he had 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.890
 in a few words to is a serious character 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.380
 in the film 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.730
 I do not know which performance was worse that of nicola peltz playing 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.220
 thus adding rhythm 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.710
 curtis playing 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.960
 one of the stupidest things in the movie is that afÃº has it 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.630
 approximately 10 years 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.000
 his old 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 in the series I was 14 or 15 years old 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.500
 another thing that bothers me about the movie is how the elements are controlled if 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.869
 well I already mentioned that the elements e of the government the problem is that when 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.790
 the actors do a stupid dance except for gallant 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.370
 more than giving us emotion what it gives us is laughter 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:59.490
 another thing to mention is the avatar test 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.670
 I do not know if they will remember that in the series a anv they gave him a choice between hundreds 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.460
 of toys and will attend he chose the same as his ancestors he was the 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:08.239
 avatar 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:10.859
 Well, in this movie, not here, the test is 

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:14.729
 spilling water on a table in front of him putting a candle and a rock 

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:18.909
 and if it turned into a circle the water the Belgian turned towards and the rock 

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:20.669
 excite vigo separated 

00:02:20.669 --> 00:02:24.669
 then it was the avatar is not that this test is bad that's what the 

00:02:24.669 --> 00:02:26.899
 of toys is more original 

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:29.899
 another thing that I should mention is that there is no career partners 

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:33.509
 they did not have to see places 

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:34.619
 but what 

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:38.509
 the warriors that were important characters in the series now I do not 

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:42.089
 I understand how they're going to do it in the second movie so that zone can 

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:43.509
 enter other insects 

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:46.940
 I imagine they will have to figure out another way for the train 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.940
 but they would have saved their work if there were 

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:54.439
 another thing is that fire masters can not create game by themselves 

00:02:57.839 --> 00:03:01.719
 that is to say that one of the many reasons why firebenders were 

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:05.339
 so intimidating will be because they could create play from this tragically 

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:08.809
 nothing here you just turn off the torch you have beside you and you're done 

00:03:09.529 --> 00:03:14.200
 the temple scientist turns north is not a scientist with that I already tell you 

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.949
 much 

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:18.289
 it even looks like a bee when it's flying, that's why I think 

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:21.299
 there is no king bhumibol and wise men of the fire 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:25.109
 and everything is narrated very quickly is seriously represent 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:28.819
 Carpio yearned if suddenly they are already in the temple of the street 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:32.299
 the movie lasts about 1 hour with 44 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:37.010
 my opinion must have been longer so that they could include certain 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.109
 important elements like those before 

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:41.539
 warrior actions that osiptel 

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:46.239
 who could rescue a scene from the movie would be the end when there 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:47.459
 the arrested avatar 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:48.850
 to this movie I com 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:50.279
 set of ten 

00:03:50.279 --> 00:03:54.229
 and in that was my fierce criticism I will do everything I can to make the next one 

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:55.159
 longer 

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:56.239
 until next April
