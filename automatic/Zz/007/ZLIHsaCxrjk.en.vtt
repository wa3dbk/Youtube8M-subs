00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.659
 good guys are very good 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.819
 welcome back to the channel 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.430
 welcome to a new call of video 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:11.400
 advanced advanced guard loans when with 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:13.110
 the m1 gun that all medium 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.730
 deciding to upload it to the channel from 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.289
 a lot ago for those of you who are 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.940
 long subscribed you already know what 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.190
 mean for me the revolvers the 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.360
 pistols in call of duty have always 

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:23.160
 I have always been delighted 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.990
 well and the truth to be sincere 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.910
 I have always been very good at this 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.230
 the first game that he used it with 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.490
 accessories you already know that the first 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.199
 obviously you nations you have to 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.589
 take off because if not then well as you play 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.940
 with them I had the laser sight go 

00:00:34.589 --> 00:00:38.700
 here 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.440
 the peephole is smaller to be able 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.000
 stop the advantage of being able to recharge 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.160
 while you run as it is quite useful 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.210
 if I only have the revolver that 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.760
 it's another thing for the one I want 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.010
 speak talk I took what was said in that and 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.230
 to do more damage from afar so I was going 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.460
 quite pretty good this command for 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.380
 me are the two best that you can 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.790
 put still not the same product 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.900
 because as I said, this is 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.730
 simply the first game that 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.310
 We use with non- approved accessories 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.080
 so we'll see how to do it but yes 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:06.970
 it's true that as I'm saying 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.650
 now it's very good to also say 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.080
 departure has only used that is 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.910
 only he threw it by the weapon a streak 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.650
 saved class I think it has taken me 16 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:15.970
 another level of saved you are going to see 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.380
 also in a moneto at the moment 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.000
 it gets super frantic plan the 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.460
 word I get I have a streak that 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.990
 hallucinate and by the way is I want to comment 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.820
 a few things one of them about the 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.280
 weapon or I honestly if I had 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.350
 put this weapon in the game not what 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.420
 I would have put as main 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.820
 sorry because you have it puts you like 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.170
 principal in special tasks if you do not 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.580
 you have set as what it is that is a 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.979
 gun 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.270
 do not worry, the gun is going well 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:41.890
 okay but it's not a gun you say 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.290
 that kills with a shot 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.810
 you have to delight the heat 24 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:49.360
 was more than anything that is in my 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:52.330
 opinion the truth the magnum of 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.680
 warfare 3 was more or less the same was 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.860
 pretty much the same and they were all 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:59.950
 secondary put this is main then 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:02.170
 I do not see it well I do not see it well the truth 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.490
 because I think there should be more 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.170
 it would be cooler 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.540
 you can also say in your fifa 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.970
 because what you need to be 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.989
 realistic are pretty pitiful like this 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.340
 that I think it did look good as 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:13.690
 secondary but good at least great 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.580
 since he is a person who goes very 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.959
 well stir the ones that there are me and 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.400
 here you will see what would be or be here 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.830
 is where it starts to fuss as I get 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.330
 in the house I take out here a triple firm 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.800
 is the one behind me charge 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.690
 they also came to me because of your being able to be 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.130
 put me recharging all the time with the 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.239
 quick recharge of it I do not think about it 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.170
 in a moment big to have to 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:30.310
 recharge 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.380
 little by little I charge this one 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.730
 there were also up there with the 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.290
 two bullets that I had left and in the end I 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.790
 I notice with the shotgun I charge it too 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.400
 I love when he fired the gun 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.780
 melanie as dad is guilty that is 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.489
 flipante is beautiful but good here 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.739
 You see, I put the mess in that house 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:46.420
 hallucinate if I felt like playing I was going to play 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:48.600
 more in plan to heading domain to 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.600
 final 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.530
 in short distances 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.850
 two shots accidentally because he was 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.030
 firing the first the second in the 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:02.920
 head but I do not know I do not know something weird 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.800
 the game happened there as I said 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.450
 it became super frenetic it's almost 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.370
 ending or the ones when pure and some 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.660
 how many times until the moment in which 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.490
 you kill a lot because the responsible 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.690
 Encounters favor quotes and do not 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:16.210
 correspond 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.280
 as I say anticipate who is to foresee well 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:20.080
 the here this month grievance killed him 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.670
 you can foresee who supported it but there 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.130
 Sometimes you have bad luck and then 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.720
 they just show up behind you and things 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.370
 well and let's go what it is what it is 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.140
 contract but not but good guys 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.910
 I wanted to upload a video with the gun 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.190
 I promised when I was half blinded 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:36.280
 eyes for the operation and I already had 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.570
 you're already 24, so from 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.890
 now you will also have game is 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:41.710
 quite different I'm preparing it 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:44.830
 all blue now as half average state 

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:46.740
 solid of the eyes and over afterwards it 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:50.200
 I was annoyed I'm going to see if I get 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:51.910
 Earn enough videos for e3 and more 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.800
 little things so nothing but that I have 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.240
 liked the video here is almost there 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.580
 finishing I was just one I'll say 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:59.500
 to try to make the plant half epic to 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:03.000
 see if I get something and such but good to 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.000
 I now had to kill normalito 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:10.720
 nobody knows that he killed me with a half bullet 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:12.340
 the nsa or you so nothing the boys 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.380
 I hope you liked the video you go 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:18.670
 to see last advances that is good 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:22.140
 at the end and I hope you have purple us 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:22.140
 we see in the next goodbye
