start<00:04:33.770> noticing<00:04:33.920> anything<00:04:34.430> once<00:04:34.730> they<00:04:34.970> build

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
start noticing anything once they build

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.620 
start noticing anything once they build
you<00:04:36.650> notice<00:04:36.980> says<00:04:37.190> that<00:04:37.400> you<00:04:38.000> know<00:04:38.090> like<00:04:38.240> bindi

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.160 
benefits of green leafy vegetables and I

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.950 
benefits of green leafy vegetables and I
get<00:04:58.310> tired<00:04:58.520> of<00:04:58.700> eating<00:04:58.790> spinach<00:04:59.120> all<00:04:59.540> the<00:04:59.780> time

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
get tired of eating spinach all the time

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.470 
get tired of eating spinach all the time
so<00:05:00.200> this<00:05:00.320> is<00:05:00.470> a<00:05:00.500> great<00:05:00.860> another<00:05:01.280> option<00:05:01.850> you

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:02.480 
so this is a great another option you

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.000 
so this is a great another option you
know<00:05:02.600> just<00:05:02.810> to<00:05:02.870> try<00:05:03.020> out<00:05:03.260> something<00:05:03.500> different

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.010 
know just to try out something different

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:05.710 
know just to try out something different
and<00:05:04.250> flavor<00:05:04.640> is<00:05:04.820> completely<00:05:05.270> different<00:05:05.420> than

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:05.720 
and flavor is completely different than

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.290 
and flavor is completely different than
spinach<00:05:06.250> so<00:05:07.250> if<00:05:07.310> you<00:05:07.430> notice<00:05:07.730> all<00:05:08.000> the

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:08.300 
spinach so if you notice all the

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.600 
spinach so if you notice all the
sliminess<00:05:08.840> has<00:05:09.350> gone<00:05:09.680> from<00:05:09.890> this<00:05:10.070> one<00:05:10.280> release

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.610 
sliminess has gone from this one release

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:14.350 
sliminess has gone from this one release
and<00:05:11.450> we<00:05:11.630> cooked<00:05:11.840> it<00:05:11.990> about<00:05:12.610> 10-12<00:05:13.610> minutes<00:05:13.850> but

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360 
and we cooked it about 10-12 minutes but

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.480 
and we cooked it about 10-12 minutes but
we<00:05:14.510> have<00:05:14.630> a<00:05:14.660> larger<00:05:14.930> quantity<00:05:15.110> so<00:05:15.620> I<00:05:15.860> would<00:05:16.370> say

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490 
we have a larger quantity so I would say

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.040 
we have a larger quantity so I would say
probably<00:05:16.640> about<00:05:16.910> 710<00:05:17.420> minutes<00:05:17.480> should<00:05:17.930> be

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.050 
probably about 710 minutes should be

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:21.970 
probably about 710 minutes should be
plenty<00:05:19.270> and<00:05:20.270> we'll<00:05:20.720> switch<00:05:20.930> this<00:05:21.110> off<00:05:21.290> and

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:21.980 
plenty and we'll switch this off and

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:23.380 
plenty and we'll switch this off and
we're<00:05:22.190> still<00:05:22.370> waiting<00:05:22.640> for<00:05:22.670> the<00:05:22.790> pressure<00:05:23.030> in

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:23.390 
we're still waiting for the pressure in

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:25.600 
we're still waiting for the pressure in
our<00:05:23.540> dal<00:05:23.810> to<00:05:23.960> go<00:05:24.050> down<00:05:24.230> okay<00:05:25.040> the<00:05:25.190> pressures

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:25.610 
our dal to go down okay the pressures

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:39.719 
our dal to go down okay the pressures
gone<00:05:25.820> from<00:05:26.210> the<00:05:26.980> dal<00:05:29.200> it's<00:05:30.200> not<00:05:30.470> safe<00:05:31.310> to<00:05:31.340> open

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:39.729 

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:41.340 

perfect

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:41.350 
perfect

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:44.379 
perfect
so<00:05:42.350> the<00:05:42.500> doll<00:05:42.680> is<00:05:42.949> ready<00:05:43.220> and<00:05:43.550> we're<00:05:44.000> going<00:05:44.180> to

00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:44.389 
so the doll is ready and we're going to

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:48.029 
so the doll is ready and we're going to
turn<00:05:45.289> on<00:05:45.470> a<00:05:45.500> stove<00:05:45.889> again<00:05:46.220> and<00:05:46.520> we've<00:05:47.449> allowed

00:05:48.029 --> 00:05:48.039 
turn on a stove again and we've allowed

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:50.800 
turn on a stove again and we've allowed
the<00:05:49.039> mixture<00:05:49.400> to<00:05:49.520> heat<00:05:49.759> up<00:05:49.789> and<00:05:50.270> to<00:05:50.509> this<00:05:50.630> we're

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:50.810 
the mixture to heat up and to this we're

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:54.300 
the mixture to heat up and to this we're
gonna<00:05:50.930> add<00:05:51.020> tomatoes<00:05:51.590> now<00:05:51.740> this<00:05:51.889> is<00:05:52.070> our<00:05:52.699> own

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:54.310 
gonna add tomatoes now this is our own

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:57.070 
gonna add tomatoes now this is our own
concoction<00:05:55.310> and<00:05:55.610> we<00:05:55.940> really<00:05:56.360> like<00:05:56.600> the<00:05:56.840> color

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:57.080 
concoction and we really like the color

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.249 
concoction and we really like the color
and<00:05:57.910> we<00:05:58.910> think<00:05:59.180> it<00:05:59.300> tastes<00:05:59.600> really<00:05:59.780> good<00:06:00.020> now

00:06:00.249 --> 00:06:00.259 
and we think it tastes really good now

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:02.950 
and we think it tastes really good now
if<00:06:00.530> you're<00:06:00.680> not<00:06:00.800> very<00:06:01.280> fond<00:06:02.090> of<00:06:02.240> very<00:06:02.630> sour

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:02.960 
if you're not very fond of very sour

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:08.320 
if you're not very fond of very sour
stuff<00:06:03.380> then<00:06:04.600> skip<00:06:05.600> it<00:06:06.460> and<00:06:07.460> just<00:06:07.789> quickly<00:06:07.970> give

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:08.330 
stuff then skip it and just quickly give

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:10.510 
stuff then skip it and just quickly give
it<00:06:08.419> a<00:06:08.479> mix<00:06:08.720> so<00:06:09.229> that<00:06:09.260> the<00:06:09.620> tomatoes<00:06:10.310> get<00:06:10.430> a

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:10.520 
it a mix so that the tomatoes get a

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:15.129 
it a mix so that the tomatoes get a
little<00:06:10.760> bit<00:06:10.850> of<00:06:11.000> the<00:06:11.180> oil<00:06:11.590> coated<00:06:13.990> and<00:06:14.990> we're

00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:15.139 
little bit of the oil coated and we're

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:19.570 
little bit of the oil coated and we're
go<00:06:15.260> ahead<00:06:15.380> and<00:06:15.500> add<00:06:15.590> the<00:06:15.710> darlin<00:06:16.430> though<00:06:18.580> now

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:19.580 
go ahead and add the darlin though now

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:20.890 
go ahead and add the darlin though now
we're<00:06:19.669> gonna<00:06:19.760> mix<00:06:19.970> this<00:06:20.120> well<00:06:20.330> and<00:06:20.720> if<00:06:20.780> you'll

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:20.900 
we're gonna mix this well and if you'll

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:22.719 
we're gonna mix this well and if you'll
notice<00:06:20.960> this<00:06:21.350> is<00:06:21.410> a<00:06:21.560> lot<00:06:21.860> thicker<00:06:22.100> than<00:06:22.520> most

00:06:22.719 --> 00:06:22.729 
notice this is a lot thicker than most

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:24.550 
notice this is a lot thicker than most
people<00:06:23.030> like<00:06:23.240> there<00:06:23.389> though<00:06:23.539> so<00:06:23.960> this<00:06:24.199> is<00:06:24.410> the

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:24.560 
people like there though so this is the

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.029 
people like there though so this is the
perfect<00:06:24.770> time<00:06:25.070> to<00:06:25.100> add<00:06:25.460> water<00:06:25.690> we<00:06:26.690> can<00:06:26.840> add

00:06:27.029 --> 00:06:27.039 
perfect time to add water we can add

00:06:27.039 --> 00:06:29.290 
perfect time to add water we can add
probably<00:06:28.039> up<00:06:28.220> to<00:06:28.340> a<00:06:28.400> cup<00:06:28.610> and<00:06:28.639> a<00:06:28.849> half<00:06:28.880> and

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:29.300 
probably up to a cup and a half and

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:30.520 
probably up to a cup and a half and
it'll<00:06:29.479> be<00:06:29.570> fine<00:06:29.810> but<00:06:30.080> really<00:06:30.199> it's<00:06:30.440> your

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:30.530 
it'll be fine but really it's your

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:32.800 
it'll be fine but really it's your
personal<00:06:30.889> preference<00:06:31.280> I<00:06:31.550> think<00:06:32.449> with<00:06:32.570> the

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:32.810 
personal preference I think with the

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:35.189 
personal preference I think with the
with<00:06:33.080> rice<00:06:33.349> you<00:06:33.680> want<00:06:33.830> it<00:06:34.009> a<00:06:34.070> little<00:06:34.220> more

00:06:35.189 --> 00:06:35.199 
with rice you want it a little more

00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:39.010 
with rice you want it a little more
liquidy<00:06:36.199> and<00:06:36.470> also<00:06:37.460> you<00:06:37.820> know<00:06:37.940> over<00:06:38.300> time<00:06:38.509> like

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:39.020 
liquidy and also you know over time like

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:40.810 
liquidy and also you know over time like
if<00:06:39.169> you<00:06:39.289> make<00:06:39.560> it<00:06:39.710> in<00:06:39.830> the<00:06:39.919> afternoon<00:06:40.400> and<00:06:40.669> by

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:40.820 
if you make it in the afternoon and by

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:43.000 
if you make it in the afternoon and by
evening<00:06:41.030> it<00:06:41.419> does<00:06:41.599> tend<00:06:42.080> to<00:06:42.169> thicken<00:06:42.440> up<00:06:42.650> so

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:43.010 
evening it does tend to thicken up so

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:45.670 
evening it does tend to thicken up so
just<00:06:43.370> keep<00:06:43.520> that<00:06:43.550> in<00:06:43.789> mind<00:06:44.229> so<00:06:45.229> the<00:06:45.349> only<00:06:45.470> thing

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:45.680 
just keep that in mind so the only thing

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.279 
just keep that in mind so the only thing
left<00:06:45.830> to<00:06:45.979> do<00:06:46.190> now<00:06:46.220> is<00:06:46.760> adjust<00:06:47.330> your<00:06:47.539> salt<00:06:47.810> give

00:06:48.279 --> 00:06:48.289 
left to do now is adjust your salt give

00:06:48.289 --> 00:06:50.560 
left to do now is adjust your salt give
it<00:06:48.380> a<00:06:48.440> taste<00:06:48.620> test<00:06:48.919> and<00:06:49.340> turn<00:06:50.090> up<00:06:50.210> your<00:06:50.360> heat

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:50.570 
it a taste test and turn up your heat

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:52.120 
it a taste test and turn up your heat
and<00:06:50.810> let<00:06:50.960> it<00:06:51.050> come<00:06:51.139> to<00:06:51.320> a<00:06:51.349> boil<00:06:51.620> let<00:06:51.919> it<00:06:51.949> all

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:52.130 
and let it come to a boil let it all

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:54.279 
and let it come to a boil let it all
heat<00:06:52.340> through<00:06:52.610> and<00:06:53.120> it's<00:06:53.539> come<00:06:53.720> to<00:06:53.870> a<00:06:53.900> boil

00:06:54.279 --> 00:06:54.289 
heat through and it's come to a boil

00:06:54.289 --> 00:06:58.540 
heat through and it's come to a boil
give<00:06:54.680> it<00:06:54.770> one<00:06:54.800> quick<00:06:55.190> stir<00:06:55.460> and<00:06:57.370> switch<00:06:58.370> off

00:06:58.540 --> 00:06:58.550 
give it one quick stir and switch off

00:06:58.550 --> 00:06:59.080 
give it one quick stir and switch off
