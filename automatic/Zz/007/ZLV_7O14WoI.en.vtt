00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.710 

midi<00:00:00.539> clock<00:00:01.550> now<00:00:02.550> mini<00:00:03.000> clock<00:00:03.210> is<00:00:03.419> used<00:00:03.629> to

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
midi clock now mini clock is used to

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.869 
midi clock now mini clock is used to
synchronize<00:00:04.170> devices<00:00:04.830> together<00:00:05.190> so<00:00:05.670> i<00:00:05.730> can

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
synchronize devices together so i can

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.110 
synchronize devices together so i can
synchronize<00:00:06.299> this<00:00:06.629> machine<00:00:07.049> with<00:00:07.379> my<00:00:08.120> let's

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
synchronize this machine with my let's

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.030 
synchronize this machine with my let's
say<00:00:09.330> pro<00:00:09.719> tools<00:00:10.019> it's<00:00:10.230> not<00:00:10.349> probative<00:00:10.620> reasons

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
say pro tools it's not probative reasons

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.640 
say pro tools it's not probative reasons
so<00:00:11.580> first<00:00:11.759> i'll<00:00:11.940> go<00:00:11.969> press<00:00:12.269> play<00:00:12.570> and<00:00:13.320> i<00:00:13.469> can

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
so first i'll go press play and i can

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:20.929 
so first i'll go press play and i can
play<00:00:13.799> the<00:00:14.040> song<00:00:14.219> for<00:00:14.370> the<00:00:14.460> beginning<00:00:19.939> and

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
play the song for the beginning and

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.480 
play the song for the beginning and
press<00:00:21.210> stop<00:00:21.510> so<00:00:22.199> I'm<00:00:22.380> in<00:00:22.560> sing<00:00:22.859> but<00:00:23.220> I'm<00:00:23.310> using

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
press stop so I'm in sing but I'm using

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.340 
press stop so I'm in sing but I'm using
it<00:00:23.609> to<00:00:23.670> midi<00:00:24.000> clock<00:00:24.240> what<00:00:24.420> happens<00:00:24.720> this<00:00:24.779> MNC

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
it to midi clock what happens this MNC

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.890 
it to midi clock what happens this MNC
is<00:00:25.380> sending<00:00:25.710> midi<00:00:25.920> clock<00:00:26.130> thing<00:00:26.369> around<00:00:26.630> so<00:00:27.630> in

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
is sending midi clock thing around so in

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.349 
is sending midi clock thing around so in
addition<00:00:28.320> to<00:00:28.470> midi<00:00:28.740> clock<00:00:29.010> it's<00:00:29.970> used<00:00:30.240> to

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
addition to midi clock it's used to

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.500 
addition to midi clock it's used to
synchronize<00:00:30.840> no-repeat<00:00:31.410> as<00:00:31.679> well<00:00:31.969> so<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.120> MPD

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
synchronize no-repeat as well so the MPD

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.250 
synchronize no-repeat as well so the MPD
can<00:00:34.050> be<00:00:34.380> a<00:00:34.410> master<00:00:34.860> or<00:00:35.370> slave<00:00:36.090> for<00:00:36.719> midi<00:00:36.960> clock

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
can be a master or slave for midi clock

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.880 
can be a master or slave for midi clock
purposes<00:00:38.660> now<00:00:39.660> this<00:00:39.870> value<00:00:40.110> is<00:00:40.230> internal<00:00:40.770> that

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
purposes now this value is internal that

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.830 
purposes now this value is internal that
means<00:00:41.129> internal<00:00:41.520> means<00:00:41.879> here<00:00:42.120> that<00:00:42.329> this

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
means internal means here that this

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.330 
means internal means here that this
machine<00:00:43.200> is<00:00:43.290> a<00:00:43.350> controller<00:00:43.680> it's<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:43.950> master

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
machine is a controller it's the master

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.850 
machine is a controller it's the master
for<00:00:44.520> internal<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.780> external<00:00:46.020> means<00:00:46.680> that

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
the machine tap tempo average now this

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.830 
the machine tap tempo average now this
means<00:01:05.309> that<00:01:05.489> if<00:01:05.640> I<00:01:05.760> tap<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.240> tempo

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
means that if I tap the tempo

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.490 
means that if I tap the tempo
tap<00:01:07.710> tap<00:01:07.950> tap<00:01:08.010> two<00:01:08.460> or<00:01:08.549> three<00:01:08.729> times<00:01:09.500> by

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
tap tap tap two or three times by

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.440 
tap tap tap two or three times by
tapping<00:01:12.619> and<00:01:13.619> I<00:01:13.680> tap<00:01:13.920> it<00:01:14.040> several<00:01:14.280> times<00:01:14.520> it's

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
tapping and I tap it several times it's

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.999 
tapping and I tap it several times it's
like<00:01:15.479> an<00:01:15.750> average<00:01:15.960> it's<00:01:16.320> gonna<00:01:16.439> say<00:01:16.619> we<00:01:16.799> tap

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
like an average it's gonna say we tap

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.370 
like an average it's gonna say we tap
two<00:01:17.100> three<00:01:17.310> times<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:17.939> those<00:01:18.570> three<00:01:18.869> taps

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
two three times and those three taps

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.100 
two three times and those three taps
what<00:01:19.799> was<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.009> average<00:01:20.460> speed<00:01:20.850> those<00:01:21.150> taps<00:01:21.450> it

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
what was the average speed those taps it

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.810 
what was the average speed those taps it
maybe<00:01:23.240> 120<00:01:24.240> BPM<00:01:24.659> maybe<00:01:24.960> 80<00:01:25.380> bpm<00:01:26.130> meaning<00:01:26.580> beats

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
maybe 120 BPM maybe 80 bpm meaning beats

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.469 
maybe 120 BPM maybe 80 bpm meaning beats
per<00:01:27.060> minute<00:01:27.360> so<00:01:28.579> this<00:01:29.579> is<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:29.759> great<00:01:29.939> way<00:01:30.119> for<00:01:30.150> us

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
per minute so this is a great way for us

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.300 
per minute so this is a great way for us
to<00:01:30.630> make<00:01:30.780> sure<00:01:30.810> that<00:01:31.140> when<00:01:31.439> we<00:01:31.530> tap<00:01:31.829> that<00:01:32.040> pad

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
to make sure that when we tap that pad

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.160 
to make sure that when we tap that pad
what's<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:32.880> time<00:01:33.060> it's<00:01:33.210> like<00:01:33.299> over<00:01:33.630> over<00:01:33.659> 18

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
what's the time it's like over over 18

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.289 
what's the time it's like over over 18
times<00:01:34.380> to<00:01:34.619> get<00:01:34.710> an<00:01:34.799> average<00:01:34.920> on<00:01:35.729> top<00:01:35.939> of<00:01:36.060> two<00:01:36.180> or

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
times to get an average on top of two or

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.600 
times to get an average on top of two or
three<00:01:36.479> times<00:01:36.689> I'm<00:01:36.900> a<00:01:36.930> four<00:01:37.170> three<00:01:37.380> tabs<00:01:37.619> those

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
three times I'm a four three tabs those

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.100 
three times I'm a four three tabs those
three<00:01:38.820> times<00:01:39.030> I<00:01:39.119> put<00:01:39.299> down<00:01:39.450> should<00:01:39.810> be<00:01:39.900> good

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
three times I put down should be good

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.200 
three times I put down should be good
two<00:01:40.710> taps<00:01:41.009> a<00:01:41.220> little<00:01:41.460> too<00:01:41.549> quick<00:01:41.729> for<00:01:41.759> me<00:01:41.939> one

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
two taps a little too quick for me one

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.090 
two taps a little too quick for me one
tap<00:01:42.509> of<00:01:42.750> course<00:01:43.110> not<00:01:43.259> at<00:01:43.320> all<00:01:43.409> so<00:01:43.979> the

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
tap of course not at all so the

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.859 
tap of course not at all so the
difference<00:01:44.460> is<00:01:44.579> we<00:01:44.700> have<00:01:44.729> two<00:01:45.060> three<00:01:45.420> or<00:01:45.600> four

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
difference is we have two three or four

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.260 
difference is we have two three or four
I<00:01:46.140> stick<00:01:46.890> with<00:01:46.920> three<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.490> mid-ground<00:01:47.729> a<00:01:47.939> safe

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
I stick with three the mid-ground a safe

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.499 
I stick with three the mid-ground a safe
set<00:01:48.600> up<00:01:48.720> this<00:01:49.590> means<00:01:49.950> I<00:01:50.159> can<00:01:50.430> save<00:01:50.729> I<00:01:50.939> just<00:01:51.270> did

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
set up this means I can save I just did

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.859 
set up this means I can save I just did
I<00:01:51.720> change<00:01:52.200> some<00:01:52.409> parameters<00:01:52.560> my<00:01:53.250> tap<00:01:53.909> tempo<00:01:54.270> I

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
I change some parameters my tap tempo I

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.410 
I change some parameters my tap tempo I
could<00:01:55.439> have<00:01:55.530> changed<00:01:55.799> my<00:01:56.189> threshold<00:01:56.939> for<00:01:57.360> the

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
could have changed my threshold for the

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.929 
could have changed my threshold for the
pads<00:01:57.659> I<00:01:58.110> could<00:01:58.710> say<00:01:58.950> this<00:01:59.100> entire<00:01:59.399> setup<00:01:59.700> that

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
pads I could say this entire setup that

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.120 
pads I could say this entire setup that
means<00:02:00.149> I'm<00:02:00.270> gonna<00:02:00.390> save<00:02:00.689> whatever<00:02:01.439> global

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
means I'm gonna save whatever global

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.569 
means I'm gonna save whatever global
parameters<00:02:02.579> I<00:02:02.670> did<00:02:02.939> set<00:02:03.240> here<00:02:03.540> so<00:02:04.340> to<00:02:05.340> do<00:02:05.520> that

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
parameters I did set here so to do that

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.930 
parameters I did set here so to do that
on<00:02:05.939> a<00:02:06.180> scroll<00:02:06.570> there<00:02:06.780> I<00:02:06.960> can<00:02:07.290> press<00:02:07.500> ENTER<00:02:07.940> and

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
on a scroll there I can press ENTER and

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.170 
on a scroll there I can press ENTER and
I<00:02:09.660> saved<00:02:09.959> my<00:02:10.140> setup

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
I saved my setup

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.270 
I saved my setup

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
and it stayed right there so you'd say

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.250 
and it stayed right there so you'd say
once<00:02:13.549> it's<00:02:13.670> saved<00:02:13.879> it<00:02:14.390> goes<00:02:14.599> back<00:02:14.840> to<00:02:15.079> the

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
once it's saved it goes back to the

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
course this for this value here we can

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:57.550 
course this for this value here we can
turn<00:02:55.609> our<00:02:55.760> values<00:02:56.180> our<00:02:56.359> preset<00:02:56.870> we've<00:02:57.049> got<00:02:57.230> one

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
turn our values our preset we've got one

turn our values our preset we've got one
see<00:02:58.549> so<00:02:59.090> we<00:02:59.209> have<00:02:59.239> up<00:02:59.569> to<00:02:59.599> 30<00:03:00.109> preset<00:03:00.769> so<00:03:01.159> we<00:03:01.760> can

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
see so we have up to 30 preset so we can

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.929 
see so we have up to 30 preset so we can
transfer<00:03:02.629> the<00:03:03.019> preset<00:03:03.680> information<00:03:04.220> right

00:03:04.929 --> 00:03:04.939

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:07.059 
transfer the preset information right
now<00:03:05.150> we're<00:03:05.420> in<00:03:05.510> preset<00:03:05.989> two<00:03:06.260> obviously<00:03:06.799> right

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:07.069 
now we're in preset two obviously right

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:11.470 
now we're in preset two obviously right
now<00:03:08.409> you<00:03:09.409> can<00:03:09.530> also<00:03:09.680> load<00:03:10.099> preset<00:03:10.579> data<00:03:10.790> into

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
now you can also load preset data into

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.280 
now you can also load preset data into
the<00:03:11.599> MPD<00:03:12.019> 32<00:03:12.620> from<00:03:13.310> an<00:03:13.459> external<00:03:13.730> source<00:03:14.290> by

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
the MPD 32 from an external source by

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:21.729 
the MPD 32 from an external source by
playing<00:03:15.709> the<00:03:17.230> Sussex<00:03:18.230> file<00:03:19.329> into<00:03:20.329> the<00:03:20.510> MPD<00:03:21.109> 32

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
playing the Sussex file into the MPD 32

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:23.740 
playing the Sussex file into the MPD 32
so<00:03:22.310> we<00:03:22.430> can<00:03:22.549> actually<00:03:22.730> save<00:03:23.239> these<00:03:23.419> on<00:03:23.569> to<00:03:23.720> a

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
so we can actually save these on to a

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.360 
so we can actually save these on to a
different<00:03:23.959> machine<00:03:24.199> that<00:03:24.620> takes<00:03:25.069> in

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
different machine that takes in

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.939 
different machine that takes in
substance<00:03:25.790> information<00:03:26.530> it'll<00:03:27.530> Trant<00:03:27.799> will

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:27.949 
substance information it'll Trant will

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:29.860 
substance information it'll Trant will
transfer<00:03:28.250> to<00:03:28.280> there<00:03:28.549> and<00:03:29.299> we<00:03:29.389> can<00:03:29.510> trap<00:03:29.750> it

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
transfer to there and we can trap it

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.909 
transfer to there and we can trap it
back<00:03:30.109> in<00:03:31.810> this<00:03:32.810> can<00:03:32.989> be<00:03:33.139> done<00:03:33.349> with<00:03:33.680> a<00:03:33.709> variety

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:33.919 
back in this can be done with a variety

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:36.520 
back in this can be done with a variety
of<00:03:34.220> social<00:03:34.370> applications<00:03:35.030> many<00:03:35.870> of<00:03:36.019> which<00:03:36.260> are
