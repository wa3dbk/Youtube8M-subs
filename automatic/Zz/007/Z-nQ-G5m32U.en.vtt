because I think other places are not you

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.590 
because I think other places are not you
know<00:01:49.409> doing<00:01:50.340> this<00:01:50.490> kind<00:01:50.729> of<00:01:50.759> thing<00:01:51.060> I<00:01:51.210> think<00:01:51.509> if

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
know doing this kind of thing I think if

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.420
