00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.809
 you want to see how I prepared this 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:18.260
 delicious hot chocolate made in 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:30.860
 house practically identical chopin then 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:34.399
 stay here after evening for ours 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:38.840
 hot chocolate for two people you will have 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:41.149
 need 400 ml of milk 2 tablespoons of 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:44.090
 sweet cocoa what you use for the 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:47.960
 vaughan milk and squeak a teaspoon 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:52.550
 of sugar and three beautiful teaspoons of 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:54.680
 potato starch let's go together 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:01:00.860
 to our very hot chocolate 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:13.510
 similar to sugar you have to unite together 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:13.510
 first of all cocoa sugar 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.670
 and 3 though in potato starch 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.080
 2 and 3 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:38.799
 and mix everything after mixing 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:47.369
 add everything a little at a time 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:51.429
 milk and mix well 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:55.240
 eliminating lumps and so until not 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:57.579
 you will have dissolved protected and now 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.399
 let's pass this mixture over the fire 

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:02.799
 now put everything on low to medium heat 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:04.929
 and stir until everything is done 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:05.920
 thickens falls consistency 

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:07.420
 desired 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.049
 when you see it begins to make bubbles 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:13.049
 it means that we can no longer thicken 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:13.049
 over 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.750
 then I do armor a little bit like that 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.270
 maybe the process hastens so many wishes 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:33.370
 you see that you start making bubbles see 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:36.030
 the density is now perfect and I go to 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.030
 remove from heat 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:43.230
 I turn off to start against the girls like that 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.230
 I'll show you the density well 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:55.800
 and this healthy see right and what you do 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.800
 cups are given 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:09.900
 here it is but if you want to take care of my love 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.900
 I put on some cinnamon 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.540
 I do not like 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:33.410
 then a little whipped cream and me 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:36.160
 I put some cocoa for him a little 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:36.160
 cinnamon on top 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:46.560
 and here are our hot chocolates 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.400
 now we're going to drink merry christmas 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.950
 to all 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:52.790
 and then a bacione recipe complains 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.790
 bye Bye
