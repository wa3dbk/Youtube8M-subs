00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
speed but other racing games is what I

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.680 
speed but other racing games is what I
was<00:02:06.190> meant<00:02:06.250> to<00:02:06.430> say<00:02:06.610> such<00:02:06.940> as<00:02:07.210> burn<00:02:07.450> out

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 
was meant to say such as burn out

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.060 
was meant to say such as burn out
because<00:02:07.870> burnout<00:02:08.229> is<00:02:08.380> probably<00:02:08.680> one<00:02:08.920> of<00:02:08.950> the

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.070 
because burnout is probably one of the

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:10.800 
because burnout is probably one of the
best<00:02:09.220> racing<00:02:09.640> games<00:02:09.850> and<00:02:10.060> because<00:02:10.690> obviously

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
best racing games and because obviously

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:11.910 
best racing games and because obviously
you<00:02:11.080> got<00:02:11.200> all<00:02:11.350> the<00:02:11.470> different<00:02:11.740> game<00:02:11.890> modes

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
you got all the different game modes

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.010 
you got all the different game modes
such<00:02:12.310> as<00:02:12.370> take<00:02:12.760> down<00:02:13.000> own<00:02:13.180> which<00:02:13.690> is<00:02:13.840> where

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
such as take down own which is where

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.330 
such as take down own which is where
basically<00:02:14.350> you<00:02:14.440> just<00:02:14.530> have<00:02:14.740> to<00:02:14.860> smash<00:02:15.100> every

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
basically you just have to smash every

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.770 
basically you just have to smash every
other<00:02:15.460> player<00:02:15.730> in<00:02:15.820> the<00:02:16.030> race<00:02:16.240> and<00:02:16.270> take<00:02:16.630> them

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
other player in the race and take them

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.450 
other player in the race and take them
out<00:02:16.900> but<00:02:17.080> this<00:02:17.290> game<00:02:17.530> really<00:02:17.860> does<00:02:18.130> give<00:02:18.310> it<00:02:18.400> a

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
out but this game really does give it a

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.010 
out but this game really does give it a
good<00:02:18.580> run<00:02:18.760> for<00:02:18.910> its<00:02:19.030> money<00:02:19.060> because<00:02:19.750> it<00:02:19.870> has

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
good run for its money because it has

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:21.780 
good run for its money because it has
kind<00:02:20.320> of<00:02:20.410> involved<00:02:20.950> that<00:02:21.100> more<00:02:21.370> kind<00:02:21.670> of

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
kind of involved that more kind of

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.940 
kind of involved that more kind of
violent<00:02:22.240> driving<00:02:22.720> slashing<00:02:23.260> hitting<00:02:23.740> players
