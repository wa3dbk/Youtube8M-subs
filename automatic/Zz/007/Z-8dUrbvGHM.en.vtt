volume<00:01:37.860> side<00:01:38.040> first<00:01:38.280> so<00:01:38.520> that<00:01:39.060> way<00:01:39.210> you<00:01:39.600> have

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
volume side first so that way you have

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.399 
volume side first so that way you have
the<00:01:40.409> volume<00:01:40.950> there<00:01:41.729> I<00:01:41.760> mean<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.409> headphone

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
the volume there I mean the headphone

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.670 
the volume there I mean the headphone
and<00:01:43.620> dock<00:01:44.210> connection<00:01:45.210> exposed<00:01:45.750> so<00:01:46.500> that<00:01:46.590> way

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
and dock connection exposed so that way

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.050 
and dock connection exposed so that way
you<00:01:46.770> can<00:01:46.890> just<00:01:46.920> charge<00:01:47.549> a<00:01:47.760> plug<00:01:47.970> your

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
you can just charge a plug your

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.300 
you can just charge a plug your
headphones<00:01:48.240> anywhere<00:01:49.049> on<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.320> go<00:01:49.500> and<00:01:49.979> as<00:01:50.159> you

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
headphones anywhere on the go and as you

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.520 
headphones anywhere on the go and as you
can<00:01:50.400> see<00:01:50.610> it<00:01:51.420> doesn't<00:01:51.690> really<00:01:51.840> stick<00:01:52.140> out

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
can see it doesn't really stick out

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.230 
can see it doesn't really stick out
there<00:01:52.740> you<00:01:52.830> can<00:01:52.979> even<00:01:53.220> push<00:01:53.460> it<00:01:53.580> down<00:01:53.729> more<00:01:54.000> so

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
there you can even push it down more so

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.810 
there you can even push it down more so
then<00:01:54.390> it's<00:01:54.540> fully<00:01:54.840> flushed<00:01:55.200> out<00:01:55.409> and<00:01:55.820> now

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
then it's fully flushed out and now

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.360 
then it's fully flushed out and now
here's<00:01:57.180> look<00:01:57.570> with<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.380> cards<00:01:58.740> here

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:01.370
