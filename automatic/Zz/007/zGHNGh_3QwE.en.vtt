this<00:00:29.789> is<00:00:29.970> pre-purchase<00:00:30.689> piping<00:00:31.140> this<00:00:31.349> piping

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
this is pre-purchase piping this piping

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.440 
this is pre-purchase piping this piping
comes<00:00:31.980> with<00:00:32.160> about<00:00:32.369> a<00:00:32.399> 3/8<00:00:32.940> inch<00:00:33.149> seam

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
comes with about a 3/8 inch seam

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.180 
comes with about a 3/8 inch seam
allowance<00:00:33.480> but<00:00:34.200> if<00:00:34.290> we<00:00:34.410> want<00:00:34.620> to<00:00:34.710> only<00:00:34.920> have<00:00:35.040> a

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
allowance but if we want to only have a

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.479 
allowance but if we want to only have a
corner<00:00:35.760> it's<00:00:36.360> very<00:00:36.690> easy<00:00:36.989> for<00:00:37.320> us<00:00:37.380> to<00:00:37.530> use<00:00:38.129> the

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
corner it's very easy for us to use the

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.340 
corner it's very easy for us to use the
grooves<00:00:38.820> that<00:00:39.180> are<00:00:39.239> located<00:00:39.780> in<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:39.960> back<00:00:40.110> of

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
grooves that are located in the back of

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.190 
grooves that are located in the back of
this<00:00:40.500> piping<00:00:40.890> ruler<00:00:41.280> to<00:00:42.149> hold<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.809> piping

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
this piping ruler to hold the piping

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.900 
this piping ruler to hold the piping
cord<00:00:43.469> in<00:00:43.590> place<00:00:43.860> while<00:00:44.190> we<00:00:44.280> cut<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.700> seam

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
cord in place while we cut the seam

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.970 
cord in place while we cut the seam
allowance<00:00:45.270> and<00:00:45.420> it<00:00:45.480> becomes<00:00:45.750> very<00:00:45.840> even<00:00:46.500> so<00:00:46.920> if

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
allowance and it becomes very even so if

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.709 
allowance and it becomes very even so if
we<00:00:47.100> just<00:00:47.280> put<00:00:47.460> it<00:00:47.550> up<00:00:47.610> on<00:00:47.760> one<00:00:48.000> side<00:00:48.270> of<00:00:48.329> it<00:00:48.570> and

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
we just put it up on one side of it and

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.520 
we just put it up on one side of it and
just<00:00:49.020> slide<00:00:49.350> it<00:00:49.620> right<00:00:49.649> up<00:00:50.420> that<00:00:51.420> piping<00:00:51.870> then

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
just slide it right up that piping then

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.819 
just slide it right up that piping then
we<00:00:52.680> can<00:00:52.829> take<00:00:53.039> our

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:54.829 
we can take our

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:59.240 
we can take our
then<00:00:55.829> we<00:00:55.920> can<00:00:56.070> take<00:00:56.309> our<00:00:57.230> rotary<00:00:58.230> cutter<00:00:58.590> and

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
then we can take our rotary cutter and

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.140 
then we can take our rotary cutter and
just<00:00:59.820> cut<00:01:00.150> the<00:01:00.870> excess<00:01:01.320> off<00:01:01.620> and<00:01:02.040> what<00:01:02.700> is<00:01:02.820> left

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:03.150 
just cut the excess off and what is left

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.299 
just cut the excess off and what is left
is<00:01:03.900> going<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.379> be<00:01:04.530> our<00:01:04.680> quarter<00:01:04.979> inch<00:01:05.100> seam

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
is going to be our quarter inch seam

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.660 
is going to be our quarter inch seam
allowance<00:01:05.369> on<00:01:05.850> our<00:01:05.970> piping<00:01:06.300> you<00:01:07.130> can<00:01:08.130> do<00:01:08.520> the

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
allowance on our piping you can do the

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.420 
allowance on our piping you can do the
same<00:01:08.909> thing<00:01:09.270> using<00:01:09.840> your<00:01:10.050> on<00:01:10.290> trudeau<00:01:10.770> a<00:01:11.070> lot

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
same thing using your on trudeau a lot

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.100 
same thing using your on trudeau a lot
of<00:01:11.610> times<00:01:11.850> I<00:01:12.030> want<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.330> do<00:01:12.450> it<00:01:12.509> needs<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:12.930> be<00:01:13.080> a

of times I want to do it needs to be a

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.090 
of times I want to do it needs to be a
quarter<00:01:13.470> of<00:01:13.590> an<00:01:13.710> inch<00:01:13.800> seam<00:01:14.070> allowance

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
quarter of an inch seam allowance

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.130 
quarter of an inch seam allowance
instead<00:01:14.820> of<00:01:14.940> the<00:01:15.060> half<00:01:15.270> inch<00:01:15.540> that<00:01:15.780> it<00:01:15.869> comes

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
instead of the half inch that it comes

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.740 
instead of the half inch that it comes
with<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:17.250> entre<00:01:17.520> dough<00:01:17.729> which<00:01:18.300> is<00:01:18.330> called

railroad<00:01:19.080> tracks<00:01:19.350> for<00:01:19.560> pants<00:01:19.950> has<00:01:20.369> these

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
railroad tracks for pants has these

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.190 
railroad tracks for pants has these
railroad<00:01:21.000> tracks<00:01:21.240> down<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.479> middle<00:01:21.810> that<00:01:22.050> are

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
railroad tracks down the middle that are

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.960 
railroad tracks down the middle that are
a<00:01:22.290> little<00:01:22.500> bit<00:01:22.619> raised<00:01:23.070> from<00:01:23.610> its<00:01:23.759> seam

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
a little bit raised from its seam

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.359 
a little bit raised from its seam
allowance<00:01:24.360> on<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.600> side<00:01:24.840> you<00:01:25.619> can<00:01:25.770> take<00:01:26.130> that

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
allowance on the side you can take that

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.550 
allowance on the side you can take that
same<00:01:26.729> groove<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.509> distance<00:01:27.930> of<00:01:28.110> this<00:01:28.259> group

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
same groove the distance of this group

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.560 
same groove the distance of this group
happens<00:01:29.039> to<00:01:29.220> be<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.490> same<00:01:29.729> width<00:01:29.940> is<00:01:30.149> art<00:01:30.330> on

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
happens to be the same width is art on

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.639 
happens to be the same width is art on
trudeau<00:01:30.990> so<00:01:31.830> if<00:01:31.890> we<00:01:31.979> take<00:01:32.190> that<00:01:32.250> groove<00:01:32.820> and

00:01:33.639 --> 00:01:33.649 
trudeau so if we take that groove and

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:37.850 
trudeau so if we take that groove and
put<00:01:34.649> it<00:01:34.770> into<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.250> into<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:36.030> with<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:37.050> entre

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
put it into the into the with the entre

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.400 
put it into the into the with the entre
dough<00:01:38.009> into<00:01:38.250> that<00:01:38.580> groove<00:01:38.940> then<00:01:39.930> we<00:01:40.050> can<00:01:40.200> also

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:40.410 
dough into that groove then we can also

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.499 
dough into that groove then we can also
cut<00:01:40.860> that<00:01:41.070> seam<00:01:41.490> allowance<00:01:41.910> and<00:01:42.149> you<00:01:42.210> just

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
cut that seam allowance and you just

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.480 
cut that seam allowance and you just
keep<00:01:42.690> sliding<00:01:42.990> it<00:01:43.229> up<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:43.619> cutting<00:01:43.979> as<00:01:44.220> much

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
keep sliding it up and cutting as much

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.700 
keep sliding it up and cutting as much
as<00:01:44.670> you<00:01:44.789> need<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.240> and<00:01:45.690> you<00:01:45.720> wind<00:01:46.259> up<00:01:46.380> with<00:01:46.440> your

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
as you need to and you wind up with your
