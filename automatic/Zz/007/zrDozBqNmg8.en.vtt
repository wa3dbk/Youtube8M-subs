internet<00:02:16.300> when<00:02:16.660> I'm<00:02:16.810> gaming<00:02:17.320> it<00:02:17.470> only<00:02:17.650> gets<00:02:17.920> to

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
internet when I'm gaming it only gets to

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.830 
internet when I'm gaming it only gets to
a<00:02:18.220> maximum<00:02:18.580> of<00:02:18.730> 30<00:02:19.590> so<00:02:20.590> as<00:02:21.360> you<00:02:22.360> can<00:02:22.450> see<00:02:22.690> the

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
a maximum of 30 so as you can see the
