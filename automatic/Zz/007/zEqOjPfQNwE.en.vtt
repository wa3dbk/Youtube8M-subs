and when you lock it you'll stay

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.200 
and when you lock it you'll stay
centered<00:01:17.720> for<00:01:17.840> sure<00:01:18.070> so<00:01:19.070> in<00:01:19.970> terms<00:01:20.150> of

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
centered for sure so in terms of

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:21.640

drop<00:02:28.730> just<00:02:29.569> look<00:02:29.750> at<00:02:29.870> yourself

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
drop just look at yourself

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:34.840 
drop just look at yourself
ledge<00:02:32.950> when<00:02:33.950> you<00:02:34.069> acting<00:02:34.400> you<00:02:34.520> have<00:02:34.610> to<00:02:34.700> know

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
ledge when you acting you have to know

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.030 
ledge when you acting you have to know
you<00:02:34.910> have<00:02:35.239> this<00:02:35.390> trick<00:02:35.690> because<00:02:36.560> as<00:02:36.830> soon<00:02:36.920> as

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
you have this trick because as soon as

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.100 
you have this trick because as soon as
you<00:02:37.160> overshoot<00:02:37.690> you're<00:02:38.690> on<00:02:38.780> the<00:02:38.900> oh<00:02:38.930> you're

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
you overshoot you're on the oh you're

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.000 
you overshoot you're on the oh you're
sliding<00:02:39.350> on<00:02:39.530> top<00:02:39.709> you're<00:02:39.890> getting<00:02:39.950> stuck<00:02:40.540> so

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
sliding on top you're getting stuck so

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.610 
sliding on top you're getting stuck so
the<00:02:43.010> trick<00:02:43.250> is<00:02:43.569> concentrate<00:02:44.569> focus<00:02:45.140> on<00:02:45.530> the

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
the trick is concentrate focus on the

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.690 
the trick is concentrate focus on the
distance<00:02:46.010> your<00:02:46.730> feet<00:02:47.230> spin<00:02:48.230> and<00:02:48.590> don't<00:02:49.519> think

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
distance your feet spin and don't think

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.729 
distance your feet spin and don't think
about<00:02:49.850> anything<00:02:50.060> else<00:02:50.290> just<00:02:51.290> think<00:02:51.500> about<00:02:51.590> the

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
about anything else just think about the

00:02:51.739 --> 00:03:04.660 
about anything else just think about the
chicane<00:02:52.040> grain

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.420 

so<00:03:05.270> the<00:03:05.990> basic<00:03:06.380> idea<00:03:06.500> that<00:03:06.950> you<00:03:07.040> kind<00:03:07.280> of

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
so the basic idea that you kind of

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:13.770 
so the basic idea that you kind of
bathroom<00:03:08.200> stay<00:03:09.200> concept<00:03:09.680> is<00:03:09.800> like<00:03:09.830> a<00:03:10.280> drug

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.290 

and<00:03:14.260> to<00:03:14.380> do<00:03:14.500> that<00:03:14.530> you<00:03:15.400> can<00:03:15.550> test<00:03:15.760> it<00:03:15.910> by<00:03:15.970> trying

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.300 
and to do that you can test it by trying

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.800 
and to do that you can test it by trying
make<00:03:16.480> it<00:03:16.600> too<00:03:16.750> busy<00:03:17.020> first

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.729 

far<00:03:20.349> out<00:03:20.560> you<00:03:20.770> jump

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
far out you jump

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:23.679 
far out you jump
if<00:03:21.980> you<00:03:22.099> know<00:03:22.489> away<00:03:22.670> jump<00:03:23.180> aren't<00:03:23.569> you

00:03:23.679 --> 00:03:23.689 
if you know away jump aren't you

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:26.170 
if you know away jump aren't you
busy<00:03:24.140> bring<00:03:25.010> your<00:03:25.099> feet<00:03:25.280> out<00:03:25.459> and<00:03:25.700> just<00:03:26.030> go

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
busy bring your feet out and just go

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.420 
busy bring your feet out and just go
topside<00:03:26.450> you<00:03:26.810> chew<00:03:26.989> crying<00:03:27.430> same<00:03:28.430> concept

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
topside you chew crying same concept

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.130 
topside you chew crying same concept
there<00:03:31.430> is<00:03:31.519> a<00:03:31.549> possibility<00:03:31.939> of<00:03:32.090> wrecking<00:03:32.390> it<00:03:32.450> be

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
there is a possibility of wrecking it be

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:34.630 
there is a possibility of wrecking it be

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.320 

all<00:03:58.870> right<00:03:59.050> so<00:03:59.319> true<00:04:00.010> kind<00:04:00.280> grind<00:04:00.550> down<00:04:01.060> well

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.330 
all right so true kind grind down well

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:03.330 
all right so true kind grind down well
same<00:04:01.599> rules<00:04:01.870> if<00:04:02.709> you're<00:04:02.890> bringing<00:04:03.069> it<00:04:03.190> to<00:04:03.310> a
