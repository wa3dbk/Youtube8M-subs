just<00:01:00.680> keep<00:01:00.829> in<00:01:00.949> mind<00:01:01.010> that<00:01:01.339> Rihanna<00:01:01.699> does<00:01:01.909> have

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:02.089 
just keep in mind that Rihanna does have

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:04.029

a<00:01:02.119> darker<00:01:02.449> skin<00:01:02.750> tone<00:01:02.960> so<00:01:03.199> this<00:01:03.440> look<00:01:03.649> is<00:01:03.890> going

00:01:04.029 --> 00:01:04.039 
a darker skin tone so this look is going

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:05.350 
a darker skin tone so this look is going
to<00:01:04.100> look<00:01:04.220> completely<00:01:04.339> different<00:01:04.759> on<00:01:05.119> someone

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
to look completely different on someone

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.700 
to look completely different on someone
who<00:01:05.420> has<00:01:05.509> darker<00:01:05.899> skin<00:01:06.200> is<00:01:06.320> going<00:01:06.409> to<00:01:06.470> probably

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
who has darker skin is going to probably

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.010 
who has darker skin is going to probably
look<00:01:07.070> a<00:01:07.220> little<00:01:07.399> bit<00:01:07.610> more<00:01:07.729> like<00:01:08.030> Brianna<00:01:08.330> but

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
look a little bit more like Brianna but

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.210 
look a little bit more like Brianna but
that's<00:01:09.259> why<00:01:09.380> it<00:01:09.440> looks<00:01:09.500> a<00:01:09.649> little<00:01:09.740> dark<00:01:09.950> from

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220
