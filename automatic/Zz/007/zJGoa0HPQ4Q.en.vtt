a CVT transmission basically it

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.210 
a CVT transmission basically it

see<00:02:32.400> here<00:02:32.730> the<00:02:33.600> complete<00:02:33.840> adjustability<00:02:34.140> AC

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
see here the complete adjustability AC

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.830 
see here the complete adjustability AC
standard<00:02:35.670> it's<00:02:35.850> kind<00:02:36.030> of<00:02:36.090> a<00:02:36.150> must<00:02:36.390> these<00:02:36.600> days

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
standard it's kind of a must these days

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.200 
standard it's kind of a must these days
now<00:02:37.590> the<00:02:37.710> cool<00:02:37.950> thing<00:02:37.980> is<00:02:38.190> the<00:02:38.340> auto<00:02:38.520> feature<00:02:38.820> I

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
now the cool thing is the auto feature I

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.300 
now the cool thing is the auto feature I
have<00:02:39.840> it<00:02:39.990> set<00:02:40.170> to<00:02:40.200> a<00:02:40.320> really<00:02:40.590> low<00:02:40.740> setting<00:02:41.130> here

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
have it set to a really low setting here

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.740 
have it set to a really low setting here
on<00:02:41.430> the<00:02:41.520> AC<00:02:41.670> but<00:02:42.090> if<00:02:42.180> I<00:02:42.240> want<00:02:42.420> it<00:02:42.480> to<00:02:42.510> get<00:02:42.660> really

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
on the AC but if I want it to get really

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.070 
on the AC but if I want it to get really
cold<00:02:43.050> set<00:02:43.950> it<00:02:44.070> to<00:02:44.160> the<00:02:44.250> low<00:02:44.430> and<00:02:44.460> hit<00:02:44.790> Auto<00:02:45.080> and

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
cold set it to the low and hit Auto and

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.360 
cold set it to the low and hit Auto and
now<00:02:46.170> it's<00:02:46.320> going<00:02:46.440> to<00:02:46.470> adjust<00:02:46.890> to<00:02:47.040> get<00:02:47.190> it<00:02:47.280> as

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
now it's going to adjust to get it as

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:48.860 
now it's going to adjust to get it as
cold<00:02:47.490> as<00:02:47.670> it<00:02:47.760> can<00:02:47.940> go<00:02:48.090> and<00:02:48.330> you<00:02:48.570> can<00:02:48.690> actually

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
cold as it can go and you can actually

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.020 
cold as it can go and you can actually
set<00:02:49.200> it<00:02:49.260> to<00:02:49.350> the<00:02:49.440> certain<00:02:49.740> degrees<00:02:50.100> and<00:02:50.880> it's

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
set it to the certain degrees and it's

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.490 
set it to the certain degrees and it's
going<00:02:51.150> to<00:02:51.210> adjust<00:02:51.510> to<00:02:51.690> hit<00:02:51.810> that<00:02:51.960> degree<00:02:52.230> for

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
going to adjust to hit that degree for

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.960 
going to adjust to hit that degree for
you<00:02:52.650> so<00:02:53.070> right<00:02:53.220> underneath<00:02:53.460> the<00:02:53.640> climate

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
you so right underneath the climate

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.280 
you so right underneath the climate
center<00:02:54.180> we<00:02:54.270> can<00:02:54.360> have<00:02:54.450> our<00:02:54.510> 12<00:02:54.810> volt<00:02:54.900> plug-in

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
center we can have our 12 volt plug-in

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:56.990 
center we can have our 12 volt plug-in
usually<00:02:56.040> used<00:02:56.190> for<00:02:56.340> a<00:02:56.370> car<00:02:56.580> charge<00:02:56.850> or

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
usually used for a car charge or

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.970 
usually used for a car charge or
anything<00:02:57.180> else<00:02:57.420> that's<00:02:57.570> car<00:02:57.780> accessible<00:02:58.290> then

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
anything else that's car accessible then

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.160 
anything else that's car accessible then
we<00:02:59.040> have<00:02:59.130> our<00:02:59.250> USB<00:02:59.760> and<00:02:59.880> auxiliary<00:03:00.020> port<00:03:01.020> as

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
we have our USB and auxiliary port as

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:02.810 
we have our USB and auxiliary port as
well<00:03:01.200> so<00:03:01.650> not<00:03:01.800> only<00:03:01.920> is<00:03:02.040> a<00:03:02.070> bluetooth<00:03:02.400> capable

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
well so not only is a bluetooth capable

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.940 
well so not only is a bluetooth capable
but<00:03:02.910> you<00:03:03.000> can<00:03:03.120> plug<00:03:03.270> in<00:03:03.450> the<00:03:03.650> Accord<00:03:04.650> just<00:03:04.860> like

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
but you can plug in the Accord just like

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.370 
but you can plug in the Accord just like
you<00:03:05.040> have<00:03:05.190> from<00:03:05.340> your<00:03:05.400> previous<00:03:05.670> car<00:03:06.090> now<00:03:07.050> for

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
you have from your previous car now for

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.140 
you have from your previous car now for
the<00:03:07.440> transmission<00:03:08.070> again<00:03:08.250> this<00:03:08.520> is<00:03:08.640> the<00:03:08.730> CVT

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
the transmission again this is the CVT

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.520 
the transmission again this is the CVT
transmission<00:03:09.750> but<00:03:09.870> I<00:03:09.900> just<00:03:10.080> want<00:03:10.230> to<00:03:10.290> show<00:03:10.440> you

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
transmission but I just want to show you

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:11.480 
transmission but I just want to show you
what<00:03:10.650> it<00:03:10.710> looks<00:03:10.860> like<00:03:10.950> when<00:03:11.100> I<00:03:11.160> throw<00:03:11.340> it<00:03:11.400> in

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:11.490 
what it looks like when I throw it in

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.850 
what it looks like when I throw it in
Reverse<00:03:11.820> right<00:03:12.120> up<00:03:13.050> on<00:03:13.170> the<00:03:13.260> screen<00:03:13.530> here<00:03:13.560> it's

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
Reverse right up on the screen here it's

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.170 
Reverse right up on the screen here it's
going<00:03:13.980> to<00:03:14.040> give<00:03:14.190> us<00:03:14.280> a<00:03:14.400> projected<00:03:14.850> path<00:03:14.970> of

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
going to give us a projected path of

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.640 
going to give us a projected path of
what's<00:03:15.300> behind<00:03:15.420> you<00:03:15.750> right<00:03:16.320> now<00:03:16.350> I'm<00:03:16.560> up

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
what's behind you right now I'm up

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.020 
what's behind you right now I'm up
against<00:03:16.890> the<00:03:16.980> curb<00:03:17.190> right<00:03:17.430> up<00:03:17.550> against<00:03:17.880> that

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
against the curb right up against that

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.699 
against the curb right up against that
red<00:03:18.209> line<00:03:18.420> so<00:03:18.660> it<00:03:18.780> knows<00:03:19.170> I'm<00:03:19.380> a<00:03:19.410> little<00:03:19.590> bit

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
red line so it knows I'm a little bit

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.949 
red line so it knows I'm a little bit
too<00:03:19.830> close<00:03:20.100> and<00:03:20.580> another<00:03:21.330> cool<00:03:21.510> feature<00:03:21.750> of

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
too close and another cool feature of

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:24.350 
too close and another cool feature of
the<00:03:22.230> the<00:03:22.980> automatic<00:03:23.130> is<00:03:23.670> when<00:03:23.940> I'm<00:03:24.030> down<00:03:24.180> in

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
the the automatic is when I'm down in

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.430 
the the automatic is when I'm down in
Drive<00:03:24.600> say<00:03:24.870> you're<00:03:24.990> getting<00:03:25.080> off<00:03:25.260> in<00:03:25.380> the

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
Drive say you're getting off in the

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.230 
Drive say you're getting off in the
interstate<00:03:25.830> and<00:03:26.010> you<00:03:26.580> want<00:03:26.730> to<00:03:26.820> ease<00:03:26.940> up<00:03:26.970> on

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:27.240 
interstate and you want to ease up on

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.940 
interstate and you want to ease up on
the<00:03:27.360> brakes<00:03:27.570> a<00:03:27.720> little<00:03:27.810> bit<00:03:28.020> if<00:03:28.620> you<00:03:28.740> knock<00:03:28.920> it

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
the brakes a little bit if you knock it

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:30.500 
the brakes a little bit if you knock it
over<00:03:29.310> into<00:03:29.430> this<00:03:29.580> technically<00:03:30.330> it's<00:03:30.480> called

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
over into this technically it's called

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.590 
over into this technically it's called
sport<00:03:30.959> mode<00:03:31.110> but<00:03:31.709> essentially<00:03:32.100> you<00:03:32.190> can<00:03:32.600> shift

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
sport mode but essentially you can shift

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.750 
sport mode but essentially you can shift
down<00:03:33.840> a<00:03:33.870> couple<00:03:34.170> gears<00:03:34.530> and<00:03:34.709> use<00:03:35.310> the<00:03:35.459> engine

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
down a couple gears and use the engine

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.280 
down a couple gears and use the engine
brakes<00:03:36.000> to<00:03:36.240> uh<00:03:36.270> slow<00:03:36.570> down<00:03:36.600> instead<00:03:37.050> of<00:03:37.140> using

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
brakes to uh slow down instead of using

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:38.960 
brakes to uh slow down instead of using
the<00:03:37.410> actual<00:03:37.560> brakes<00:03:37.920> it'll<00:03:38.100> save<00:03:38.340> you<00:03:38.430> a<00:03:38.459> save

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
the actual brakes it'll save you a save

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.310 
the actual brakes it'll save you a save
you<00:03:39.060> a<00:03:39.090> lot<00:03:39.240> on<00:03:39.270> the<00:03:39.450> brakes<00:03:39.660> so<00:03:40.230> you

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
you a lot on the brakes so you

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.380 
you a lot on the brakes so you
definitely<00:03:40.410> have<00:03:40.650> that<00:03:40.770> option<00:03:41.209> now<00:03:42.209> we<00:03:42.270> have

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
definitely have that option now we have

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:43.790 
definitely have that option now we have
this<00:03:42.480> little<00:03:42.660> button<00:03:42.930> here<00:03:43.020> looks<00:03:43.380> like<00:03:43.500> a<00:03:43.560> car

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
this little button here looks like a car

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.220 
this little button here looks like a car
with<00:03:44.010> a<00:03:44.040> couple<00:03:44.250> of<00:03:44.280> squiggly<00:03:44.580> lines<00:03:45.050> and<00:03:46.050> it

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
with a couple of squiggly lines and it

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:47.780 
with a couple of squiggly lines and it
says<00:03:46.410> off<00:03:46.650> essentially<00:03:47.280> as<00:03:47.400> your<00:03:47.580> traction

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
says off essentially as your traction

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.090 
says off essentially as your traction
control<00:03:47.970> so<00:03:48.959> whenever<00:03:49.410> you're<00:03:49.650> driving<00:03:49.739> it's

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
control so whenever you're driving it's

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.380 
control so whenever you're driving it's
gonna<00:03:50.190> come<00:03:50.400> on<00:03:50.489> automatically<00:03:51.030> unless<00:03:51.209> you

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
gonna come on automatically unless you

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:52.760
