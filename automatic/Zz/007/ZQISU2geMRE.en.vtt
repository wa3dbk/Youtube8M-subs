00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.950

 So let's take a black rubber 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.869
 pull it straight over both again 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.790

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.580
 now we are missing on our pens the 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:32.620

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.620
 So we just put the brown over it 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:41.500
 and now pull the golden over in 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:46.660

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.660
 drop over in the middle 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:52.990
 now the golden comes back 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.910
 Black take over 10 in the middle 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.910
 drop 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.380
 Now he's black again 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:19.570
 and you do that now as long as it is 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:23.040
 needs that are always about for 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:27.870
 a dam wrist between 50 and 55 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.870
 Gummies and on we go 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:58.970
 so my life we ​​are nearing the end 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:04.460
 try if that's enough for ours 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:07.640
 Just test your wrist and see if 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:14.480
 you come around and if that is the 

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:17.780
 case, then you do not take a new rubber 

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:20.720
 more on but take the bottom of 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:21.440
 the two on this are also still 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.080
 over 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:27.260
 that means you also pull the lower one 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:29.810
 once let it fall in the middle 

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:32.450
 the same on the other side like that 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:34.400
 that we are practically a rubber 

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:36.380
 on each side 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:40.210
 we'll take that with ours now 

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:48.380
 Crochet hook on it down again 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:51.260
 once and twice we saw that up 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:55.100
 our needle and now we can here 

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:58.450
 conveniently a hook it just kick it 

00:05:55.100 --> 00:06:03.130
 nice to pull long and hooked with the ass 

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:03.130
 go in both here 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:14.590
 then you can remove the needle and 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:18.270
 Could the other side of the car 

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:18.270
 attach to the other end 

00:06:35.849 --> 00:06:42.360
 and already the beautiful is finished looks 

00:06:39.819 --> 00:06:47.220
 like a beautiful area pattern 

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:47.220
 and easily made 

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:52.410
 have lots of fun with it
