00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.940
 hello friends of youtube good then here 

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:07.490
 we already have the last concentrate that 

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:10.519
 we got out of the louis box after 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:13.480
 clean all the gravel and be nil 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:15.440
 in a fine way here is the 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:18.940
 concentrated 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:22.390
 and what do we find ourselves with? 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:25.390
 good although we have some particles 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:28.470
 very very light black like you 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.470
 can see here 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:42.910
 in those parts 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.910
 regularly focuses hair 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:51.300
 let's concentrate on the lower part 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.329
 and here we can see some particles 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.399
 but as the saying goes, not everything 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.770
 What shines is gold, this seems to me 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.260
 make copper or pyrite 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:05.510
 because it looks a color this 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.510
 reddish the particle that we have here 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:14.969
 this particle looks a reddish color 

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:14.969
 then all this not only 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:18.650
 only the particles as per 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:22.160
 example is that it was one more color 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:26.470
 more yellow that is going around here that 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.470
 it's good we're going to do 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:37.719
 little by little waiting to throw only the 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:37.719
 life and not heavy things 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.119
 Well, for example 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:08.440
 what we saw here 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:11.610
 it's not just because because this is less 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:14.970
 dense that gold this is this is copper 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:18.480
 we discard all the gold is going to 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.580
 deposit in this part are only not 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.330
 they are deposited in no other place 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.330
 odor 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:29.080
 remember that all this we do for 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:31.830
 a given life that then have the same 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.680
 density to his 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:39.440
 lead then we can trust this 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.440
 everything is going to circulate by gravity 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:45.760
 if a material reaches the part of 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:48.180
 up or stay up simply 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.180
 it's not only 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:11.670
 we must have concentrated acceptable 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.670
 we will decant again 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:18.569
 so now we are going to look for what 

00:03:14.499 --> 00:03:18.569
 result we got 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:38.390
 it is assumed that gold should be in 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:40.790
 in this part we see almost almost 1 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:43.360
 some light gold particles in 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.360
 this part 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:49.120
 and only black sand and a piece 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:52.080
 it seems that d 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.080
 it's a line 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:59.930
 pieces of small this 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:04:02.980
 green crystals that way wait for the 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.980
 countries with Mr. 23 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.650
 all the green crystals well let's 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:11.650
 leave them here 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:24.230
 and if only in some small 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:27.530
 gold particles and mostly 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:29.150
 we got copper so friends do the 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:33.200
 case they have said not everything that shines is 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:36.170
 gold and well then do not despair in your 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:38.540
 search because then there is this question 

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:41.380
 of gold and everything that is here if 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.380
 is it gold 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:48.039
 in the pursuit of gold is 90% 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:48.039
 search 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.430
 and 10% of results usually 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:59.620
 good friends of youtube I hope you have them 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:02.500
 liked the video we are seeing in 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:05.229
 the next we will go to a location 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:08.050
 very interesting in the warrior state 

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:12.090
 to have more of this results and 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:12.090
 methods to search until later
