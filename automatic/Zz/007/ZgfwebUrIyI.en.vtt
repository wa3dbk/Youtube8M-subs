00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:06.470
 celestine whoever says 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.070
 he 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:35.590
 but in fact it was late 2009 we were 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:36.610
 nothing without qatar finishing a 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.280
 animation film called to 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:42.339
 daoukro panic panic to the village and the 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:44.530
 producer of the film producing the film 

00:00:42.339 --> 00:00:47.230
 vincent tavier had met the 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.430
 producer of ernest and celestine and he 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.440
 is tempting to search in click at 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.780
 director to help benjamin from 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.339
 resnais and asked us if that we 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.070
 interested in working on this project 

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:59.530
 so we were nevertheless we saw the 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.479
 script we saw the first tests that 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.710
 had been doing the drawings of the first 

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:04.510
 animation tests and have found that 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.890
 beautiful so we went back into 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.119
 order in the project directly and 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:17.049
 this is a bit like that it has 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:18.690
 started for us it was all 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:21.330
 again because 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:25.380
 in kind work on our own 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.940
 scenarios our own the universe is here 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.560
 it was a universe that we 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.740
 did not belong to us it's a 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.930
 exercise a little bit new and that's it 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.940
 we all thought the development was 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.670
 and is super nice so here it was 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:52.530
 nice gift for us to participate in this 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:56.220
 project actually we use software 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.470
 to animate the watercolor because it's 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.120
 the whole drawing in fact if we got one 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.620
 little tribute to the work of watercolors 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.840
 what gabriel vincent was doing the author 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.510
 of ernest and celestine is the challenge he 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.500
 had to do it was both 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.910
 reproduce the pencil line but that 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.610
 was repeated with class software 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:14.010
 and that above all it was to animate the 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.850
 color the color in watercolor for 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.290
 give that impression 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.720
 and it had to use software 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:29.970
 particular which allowed to obtain 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:32.459
 this effect there the fact of working 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.670
 just a little old fashion design 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:39.300
 like that finally little vintage old drawings 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:44.000
 and you still had to find a 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:46.520
 way to make a little bit of 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.160
 the drawing of gabriel vincent live with 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.930
 animation was not an easy thing 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.650
 initially but with the new 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.040
 technology 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:57.530
 precisely that allowed us to develop 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.390
 that and what's interesting is that 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.940
 we could really keep the side 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:04.910
 animated watercolors and it's really at 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:09.140
 from software that have been that have 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:11.900
 been really thought for this project and 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.280
 that was interesting for example 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.230
 all the lamination work that 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.740
 benjamin did it was certainly not the 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.590
 graphics 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:23.060
 he has more paper so it's really 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:27.340
 the perfect marriage of tradition and 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.340
 new technologies every 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:38.870
 Thursdays no mouse in a house in 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.400
 done yeah actually we are mostly 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.530
 intervened at the beginning of the film from 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.940
 far the script was done with benjamin 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.100
 we met we discussed the 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.930
 project we were discussing the universe all 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.610
 the same three there are two people who 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.230
 intervened as a maryse to music that 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:54.290
 minded the readers all that and then 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:57.080
 we actually parts of the script and 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.970
 we split the script into different 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.350
 sequences we shared months and 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:02.000
 vincent on our side we were working at 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:03.470
 brussels in our corner 11n the drawing 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.970
 and we did the storyboards and 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:07.280
 benjamins on his side working on 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.930
 other parts of the script to do 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.120
 also the storyboards and then we 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:13.100
 gathered who talked together and 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.140
 at the same time to get to keep this 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.489
 important energy because that's the 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.989
 end of the film is the conclusion of the film 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:20.419
 we see here it's a little bit everything 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:21.890
 senna who took us a lot of 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:23.900
 work and then after we intervened 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:25.880
 also in the preparation part 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.690
 animation but for the animation of 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:37.669
 proper that it is especially 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:39.860
 benjamin who take care of it but that's 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:41.479
 really we are very greedy game 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.260
 face stéphane and I really have the 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:45.810
 even 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:47.580
 the same attractions for the same things 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.080
 for example we are we like 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.760
 walk when we get here in a 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.470
 city ​​like toronto we do not know 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.030
 like to walk a lot so here 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:55.470
 even the animals we register 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:59.660
 many for example the dogs the 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:59.660
 cats the flesh a lot and are good 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.310
 I was alone
