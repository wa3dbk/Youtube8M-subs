and how successful a bait they are not
only<00:00:18.690> they<00:00:18.900> convene<00:00:19.230> it<00:00:19.410> because<00:00:19.590> they<00:00:19.710> come

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
only they convene it because they come

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.300 
only they convene it because they come
in<00:00:20.010> these<00:00:20.130> nice<00:00:21.320> easy<00:00:22.320> to<00:00:22.470> carry<00:00:22.740> jars<00:00:23.070> and

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
in these nice easy to carry jars and

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.310 
in these nice easy to carry jars and
they're<00:00:23.430> plastic<00:00:23.820> so<00:00:23.970> they<00:00:24.000> won't<00:00:24.269> break<00:00:24.480> come

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
they're plastic so they won't break come

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.960 
they're plastic so they won't break come
in<00:00:25.439> a<00:00:25.500> good<00:00:25.680> range<00:00:25.920> of<00:00:26.099> varieties<00:00:26.699> but

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
in a good range of varieties but

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.820 
in a good range of varieties but
probably<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:27.900> single<00:00:28.349> best<00:00:28.470> thing<00:00:28.619> about

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
probably the single best thing about

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.560 
probably the single best thing about
them<00:00:29.099> is<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:29.279> fact<00:00:29.310> that<00:00:29.550> they<00:00:29.699> float<00:00:30.000> it's

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
them is the fact that they float it's

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:31.970 
them is the fact that they float it's
when<00:00:30.689> we're<00:00:30.840> fishing<00:00:31.170> areas<00:00:31.470> like<00:00:31.619> this<00:00:31.830> it

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
when we're fishing areas like this it

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.500 
when we're fishing areas like this it
like<00:00:32.099> you<00:00:32.279> can<00:00:32.489> burn<00:00:32.579> a<00:00:32.640> lake<00:00:32.910> jindabyne<00:00:33.090> in

got the sherbet burst again molded quite
quite<00:01:26.340> well<00:01:26.610> so<00:01:26.729> it<00:01:26.909> sits<00:01:27.090> on<00:01:27.240> your<00:01:27.330> hook

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
quite well so it sits on your hook

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.569 
quite well so it sits on your hook
nicely<00:01:28.020> what<00:01:28.799> will<00:01:28.920> happen<00:01:29.250> is<00:01:29.369> that<00:01:29.490> we'll

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
nicely what will happen is that we'll

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.069 
nicely what will happen is that we'll
sit<00:01:29.790> on<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:29.970> bottom<00:01:30.270> you'll<00:01:30.479> have<00:01:30.600> one<00:01:30.840> bait

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
sit on the bottom you'll have one bait

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.410 
sit on the bottom you'll have one bait
sitting<00:01:31.470> up<00:01:31.680> here<00:01:32.070> in<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.250> water<00:01:32.400> column<00:01:32.700> and

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
sitting up here in the water column and

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.510 
sitting up here in the water column and
with<00:01:33.630> this<00:01:33.750> slightly<00:01:34.110> hit<00:01:34.470> longer<00:01:35.009> leader<00:01:35.250> is

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
with this slightly hit longer leader is

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.359 
with this slightly hit longer leader is
it<00:01:36.450> will<00:01:36.540> be<00:01:36.689> sitting<00:01:37.020> up<00:01:37.110> just<00:01:38.070> a<00:01:38.159> little<00:01:38.280> bit

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
it will be sitting up just a little bit

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:39.740 
it will be sitting up just a little bit
higher<00:01:38.640> in<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.909> water<00:01:39.090> column<00:01:39.299> so<00:01:39.570> it<00:01:39.630> gives

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
higher in the water column so it gives

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.179 
higher in the water column so it gives
the<00:01:39.930> fish<00:01:40.110> as<00:01:40.290> they're<00:01:40.439> cruising<00:01:40.829> along<00:01:40.920> the

the fish as they're cruising along the

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.069 
the fish as they're cruising along the
weed<00:01:41.369> beds<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:42.150> they<00:01:42.240> see<00:01:42.299> these<00:01:42.720> they're

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
weed beds and they see these they're

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.590 
weed beds and they see these they're
almost<00:01:43.229> irresistible<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.430> trap<00:01:44.700> rain

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
almost irresistible to the trap rain

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.539 
almost irresistible to the trap rain
base<00:01:45.780> in<00:01:45.960> particular<00:01:46.290> love<00:01:46.740> them<00:01:46.890> but<00:01:47.399> they
