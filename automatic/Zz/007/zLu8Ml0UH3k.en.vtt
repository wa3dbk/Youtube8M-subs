this one decides to go bad after a
couple<00:01:18.750> of<00:01:18.840> weeks<00:01:19.280> instead<00:01:20.280> of<00:01:20.460> what<00:01:20.850> the

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
couple of weeks instead of what the

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.840 
couple of weeks instead of what the
instruction<00:01:21.479> says<00:01:21.720> is<00:01:21.900> drop<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.320> tank<00:01:22.530> and

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
some mechanics lift the bed so I wasn't

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.399 
some mechanics lift the bed so I wasn't
going<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.310> do<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.610> one<00:01:26.759> so<00:01:27.060> basically<00:01:28.020> cut<00:01:28.259> my

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
going to do the one so basically cut my

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:29.870 
going to do the one so basically cut my
hole<00:01:28.590> here<00:01:28.890> you<00:01:29.250> can<00:01:29.400> see<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.700> measurements

hole here you can see the measurements

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.010 
hole here you can see the measurements
on<00:01:30.329> part<00:01:30.600> one<00:01:30.810> video<00:01:31.020> I<00:01:32.090> explained<00:01:33.090> how<00:01:33.119> I<00:01:33.360> cut

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
on part one video I explained how I cut

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.100 
on part one video I explained how I cut
it<00:01:34.170> it's<00:01:34.380> pretty<00:01:34.590> simple<00:01:34.619> unibit<00:01:35.369> and<00:01:35.700> uh

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
it it's pretty simple unibit and uh

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.499 
it it's pretty simple unibit and uh
jigsaw<00:01:37.110> or<00:01:37.140> or<00:01:38.040> sawzall<00:01:38.880> whatever<00:01:39.210> you<00:01:39.329> have

and<00:01:40.140> if<00:01:40.650> you<00:01:40.770> use<00:01:40.950> these<00:01:41.100> exact<00:01:41.520> measurements

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
and if you use these exact measurements

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.819 
and if you use these exact measurements
with<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.720> same<00:01:42.990> model<00:01:43.320> truck<00:01:43.560> of<00:01:43.770> course

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
with the same model truck of course

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.139 
with the same model truck of course
you're<00:01:44.100> going<00:01:44.220> to<00:01:44.280> want<00:01:44.340> to<00:01:44.520> climb<00:01:44.670> under<00:01:45.030> and

you're going to want to climb under and

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.550 
you're going to want to climb under and
check<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.630> make<00:01:45.659> sure<00:01:45.810> nobody's<00:01:46.229> made<00:01:46.380> any

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
check to make sure nobody's made any

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.310 
check to make sure nobody's made any
modifications<00:01:46.680> on<00:01:47.430> your<00:01:47.549> truck<00:01:47.820> you<00:01:48.320> should

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
modifications on your truck you should

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.170 
modifications on your truck you should
be<00:01:49.500> safe<00:01:49.770> you<00:01:50.070> always<00:01:50.490> want<00:01:50.670> to<00:01:50.700> check<00:01:50.790> though

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
be safe you always want to check though

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.960 
be safe you always want to check though
you<00:01:52.140> know<00:01:52.259> measure<00:01:52.500> three<00:01:52.799> times<00:01:53.040> cut<00:01:53.399> once<00:01:53.640> in

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
you know measure three times cut once in

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.020 
you know measure three times cut once in
this<00:01:54.240> case<00:01:54.509> it's<00:01:54.780> really<00:01:55.079> important<00:01:55.880> but<00:01:56.880> it

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
this case it's really important but it

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.030 
this case it's really important but it
does<00:01:57.210> really<00:01:57.600> help<00:01:57.810> so<00:01:58.140> once<00:01:58.409> I<00:01:58.530> snapped<00:01:58.890> this

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
does really help so once I snapped this

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.389 
does really help so once I snapped this
bedliner<00:01:59.520> back<00:01:59.759> in<00:01:59.969> nobody<00:02:00.360> will<00:02:00.509> ever<00:02:00.630> know

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:01.399 
bedliner back in nobody will ever know

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:03.740 
bedliner back in nobody will ever know
and<00:02:02.399> as<00:02:02.520> long<00:02:02.700> as<00:02:02.729> I'm<00:02:02.969> not<00:02:03.119> putting<00:02:03.450> you<00:02:03.659> know

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
and as long as I'm not putting you know

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.209 
and as long as I'm not putting you know
100<00:02:04.110> pounds<00:02:04.350> of<00:02:04.439> pressure<00:02:04.649> in<00:02:04.829> this<00:02:04.950> little

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
100 pounds of pressure in this little

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.219 
100 pounds of pressure in this little
area<00:02:05.399> I<00:02:05.759> don't<00:02:06.450> even<00:02:06.659> have<00:02:06.810> to<00:02:06.960> build<00:02:07.140> a

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
area I don't even have to build a

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.919 
area I don't even have to build a
trapdoor<00:02:07.500> and<00:02:07.890> I<00:02:07.950> can<00:02:08.220> later<00:02:08.459> I<00:02:08.729> can<00:02:09.660> build<00:02:09.840> a

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
trapdoor and I can later I can build a

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.280 
trapdoor and I can later I can build a
little<00:02:10.110> trapdoor<00:02:11.120> to<00:02:12.120> kind<00:02:12.270> of<00:02:12.330> keep<00:02:12.480> the

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
little trapdoor to kind of keep the

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.800 
little trapdoor to kind of keep the
edge<00:02:13.379> strength<00:02:13.709> back<00:02:13.950> up<00:02:13.980> so<00:02:14.640> there's<00:02:15.569> the

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
edge strength back up so there's the

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.589 
edge strength back up so there's the
update<00:02:16.200> and<00:02:16.469> if<00:02:16.739> you<00:02:16.860> can<00:02:17.010> see<00:02:17.219> right<00:02:17.400> here<00:02:17.599> the

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
update and if you can see right here the

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:20.660 
update and if you can see right here the
hardest<00:02:18.959> part<00:02:19.200> about<00:02:19.260> replacing<00:02:19.950> this<00:02:20.069> pump

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
hardest part about replacing this pump

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.750 
hardest part about replacing this pump
was<00:02:20.909> pulling<00:02:21.359> it<00:02:21.480> out<00:02:21.569> was<00:02:21.719> easy<00:02:22.760> was

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
was pulling it out was easy was

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.240 
was pulling it out was easy was
threading<00:02:24.329> this<00:02:24.510> ring<00:02:25.260> around<00:02:25.500> here<00:02:25.950> without

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
threading this ring around here without

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.580 
threading this ring around here without
getting<00:02:26.549> it<00:02:26.609> cross<00:02:26.849> threaded<00:02:27.359> so<00:02:28.200> I<00:02:28.230> had<00:02:28.469> to

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
getting it cross threaded so I had to

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.830 
getting it cross threaded so I had to
maneuver<00:02:29.010> the<00:02:29.159> pump<00:02:29.400> like<00:02:29.849> one<00:02:30.299> way<00:02:30.510> or

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
maneuver the pump like one way or

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.130 
maneuver the pump like one way or
another<00:02:31.370> to<00:02:32.370> get<00:02:32.519> it<00:02:32.670> around<00:02:33.299> these<00:02:33.569> because

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
another to get it around these because

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.020 
another to get it around these because
the<00:02:34.260> Det<00:02:34.470> clearance<00:02:34.890> between<00:02:35.250> this<00:02:35.400> ring<00:02:35.700> and

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
the Det clearance between this ring and

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.960 
the Det clearance between this ring and
this<00:02:36.840> back<00:02:37.319> deal<00:02:37.590> here<00:02:37.920> was<00:02:38.280> was<00:02:38.640> kind<00:02:38.879> of

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
this back deal here was was kind of

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.960 
this back deal here was was kind of
weird<00:02:39.180> so<00:02:39.450> I<00:02:39.480> moved<00:02:40.349> the<00:02:40.470> pump<00:02:40.680> that<00:02:40.769> way<00:02:41.189> got

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
weird so I moved the pump that way got

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.089 
weird so I moved the pump that way got
it<00:02:42.000> started<00:02:42.450> and<00:02:42.900> I'm<00:02:43.049> up<00:02:43.409> not<00:02:43.650> everybody

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
it started and I'm up not everybody

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:45.679 
it started and I'm up not everybody
might<00:02:44.280> have<00:02:44.549> that<00:02:44.700> problem<00:02:44.909> but<00:02:45.090> I<00:02:45.150> did<00:02:45.450> and

00:02:45.679 --> 00:02:45.689 
might have that problem but I did and

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:47.420 
might have that problem but I did and
then<00:02:46.379> I<00:02:46.439> got<00:02:46.620> the<00:02:46.739> ring<00:02:46.920> go<00:02:47.129> in<00:02:47.220> there<00:02:47.340> without

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
then I got the ring go in there without

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.429 
then I got the ring go in there without
cross<00:02:47.790> threading<00:02:48.180> but<00:02:48.329> there's<00:02:48.989> our<00:02:49.200> green

00:02:49.429 --> 00:02:49.439 
cross threading but there's our green

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:51.319 
cross threading but there's our green
indicator<00:02:50.040> right<00:02:50.250> here<00:02:50.489> on<00:02:50.609> this<00:02:50.790> one<00:02:51.030> you

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329 
indicator right here on this one you

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:52.879 
indicator right here on this one you
can't<00:02:51.569> see<00:02:51.659> it<00:02:51.959> but<00:02:52.079> maybe<00:02:52.260> you<00:02:52.409> can<00:02:52.590> there

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:52.889 
can't see it but maybe you can there

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:54.890 
can't see it but maybe you can there
that's<00:02:53.819> where<00:02:54.060> it's<00:02:54.180> supposed<00:02:54.419> to<00:02:54.480> line<00:02:54.720> up

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
that's where it's supposed to line up

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.330 
that's where it's supposed to line up
with<00:02:54.930> this<00:02:55.230> arrow<00:02:55.530> and<00:02:55.769> those<00:02:55.919> two<00:02:56.099> plastic

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
with this arrow and those two plastic

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.429 
with this arrow and those two plastic
notches<00:02:57.000> but<00:02:57.150> the<00:02:57.629> thing<00:02:57.840> was<00:02:58.019> really<00:02:58.049> getting

00:02:58.429 --> 00:02:58.439 
notches but the thing was really getting

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:00.409 
notches but the thing was really getting
tight<00:02:58.799> so<00:02:59.129> I<00:02:59.159> think<00:02:59.280> it's<00:02:59.669> just<00:02:59.970> this<00:03:00.150> new

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:00.419 
tight so I think it's just this new

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:02.869 
tight so I think it's just this new
rubber<00:03:00.980> gasket<00:03:01.980> that's<00:03:02.129> in<00:03:02.310> between<00:03:02.430> there's

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:02.879 
rubber gasket that's in between there's

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:06.349 
rubber gasket that's in between there's
sticker<00:03:03.359> or<00:03:03.799> it's<00:03:04.799> so<00:03:05.010> new<00:03:05.250> here's<00:03:06.000> the<00:03:06.180> old

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:06.359 
sticker or it's so new here's the old

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:09.379 
sticker or it's so new here's the old
one<00:03:06.769> that<00:03:07.769> uh<00:03:07.799> I<00:03:08.220> was<00:03:08.730> afraid<00:03:08.970> that<00:03:09.090> it<00:03:09.329> was

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:09.389 
one that uh I was afraid that it was

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:10.759 
one that uh I was afraid that it was
going<00:03:09.510> to<00:03:09.599> pop<00:03:09.810> off<00:03:09.989> the<00:03:10.200> threads<00:03:10.500> here<00:03:10.709> I

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
going to pop off the threads here I

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:12.589 
going to pop off the threads here I
didn't<00:03:11.099> want<00:03:11.220> to<00:03:11.280> break<00:03:11.459> this<00:03:11.730> so<00:03:11.939> it's<00:03:12.329> really

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:12.599 
didn't want to break this so it's really

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:15.920 
didn't want to break this so it's really
tight<00:03:13.819> so<00:03:14.819> I<00:03:14.849> didn't<00:03:15.209> I<00:03:15.299> didn't<00:03:15.599> crank<00:03:15.810> it

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
tight so I didn't I didn't crank it

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.409 
tight so I didn't I didn't crank it
around<00:03:16.169> all<00:03:16.919> the<00:03:17.280> way<00:03:17.370> to<00:03:17.430> the<00:03:17.639> arrow<00:03:17.909> like<00:03:18.239> it

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:18.419 
around all the way to the arrow like it

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:20.119 
around all the way to the arrow like it
was<00:03:18.569> before<00:03:18.989> but<00:03:19.229> it's<00:03:19.650> okay

00:03:20.119 --> 00:03:20.129 
was before but it's okay

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:22.309 
was before but it's okay
I'll<00:03:20.790> keep<00:03:21.030> an<00:03:21.209> eye<00:03:21.299> on<00:03:21.329> it<00:03:21.690> looks<00:03:22.019> like<00:03:22.169> it

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:22.319 
I'll keep an eye on it looks like it

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:24.469 
I'll keep an eye on it looks like it
could<00:03:22.470> rain<00:03:22.680> today<00:03:22.979> here<00:03:23.190> in<00:03:23.280> Texas<00:03:23.669> so<00:03:23.879> that's

00:03:24.469 --> 00:03:24.479 
could rain today here in Texas so that's

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:27.080 
could rain today here in Texas so that's
my<00:03:24.690> update<00:03:24.720> it<00:03:25.409> works<00:03:25.739> great<00:03:26.069> I<00:03:26.280> cut<00:03:26.579> a<00:03:26.699> hole<00:03:26.790> in

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
my update it works great I cut a hole in

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.250 
my update it works great I cut a hole in
my<00:03:27.180> bed<00:03:27.419> and<00:03:28.290> I<00:03:28.889> suggest<00:03:29.389> anybody<00:03:30.389> do<00:03:30.780> that<00:03:30.810> if

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
my bed and I suggest anybody do that if

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.309 
my bed and I suggest anybody do that if
they<00:03:31.470> I<00:03:32.000> think<00:03:33.000> it<00:03:33.359> improves<00:03:33.690> the<00:03:33.870> value<00:03:33.900> of

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319 
they I think it improves the value of

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:36.680 
they I think it improves the value of
the<00:03:34.440> truck<00:03:34.709> if<00:03:34.859> you<00:03:34.919> have<00:03:35.159> a<00:03:35.190> slip<00:03:36.120> in<00:03:36.299> bedliner

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
the truck if you have a slip in bedliner

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.210 
the truck if you have a slip in bedliner
and<00:03:36.930> you<00:03:37.169> you<00:03:37.379> know<00:03:37.500> you're<00:03:37.799> going<00:03:37.889> to<00:03:37.979> sell

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
and you you know you're going to sell

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.099

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
going to do in research and this was my

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:58.789 
going to do in research and this was my
solution<00:03:57.599> so<00:03:57.930> I'm<00:03:58.049> going<00:03:58.169> to<00:03:58.229> fire<00:03:58.409> the<00:03:58.439> truck

fires right up and of course I cranked
it<00:04:26.530> up<00:04:26.650> one<00:04:26.889> more<00:04:26.919> time<00:04:27.280> before<00:04:27.430> I<00:04:27.639> did<00:04:27.789> the

it up one more time before I did the

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.480 
it up one more time before I did the
video<00:04:28.030> just<00:04:28.479> so<00:04:28.660> it<00:04:28.750> wouldn't<00:04:28.990> be<00:04:29.050> a<00:04:29.490> wasted

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
video just so it wouldn't be a wasted

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.219 
video just so it wouldn't be a wasted
video<00:04:30.759> here<00:04:31.030> at<00:04:31.090> the<00:04:31.240> end<00:04:31.330> so<00:04:31.570> I<00:04:31.600> did<00:04:31.900> fire<00:04:32.139> it

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:32.229 
video here at the end so I did fire it

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:35.340
