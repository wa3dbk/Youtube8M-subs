00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
find yourself an audio source like an

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.360 
find yourself an audio source like an
iPod<00:00:42.690> shuffle<00:00:42.719> as<00:00:43.350> you<00:00:43.469> can<00:00:43.620> see<00:00:43.829> there's<00:00:44.190> the

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
iPod shuffle as you can see there's the

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.549 
iPod shuffle as you can see there's the
iPod<00:00:44.730> shuffle<00:00:44.760> compared<00:00:45.539> next<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.469> the

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
iPod shuffle compared next to the

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.830 
iPod shuffle compared next to the
volcano<00:00:46.950> volcano<00:00:47.940> weighs<00:00:48.360> about<00:00:48.510> three

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
volcano volcano weighs about three

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:57.010 
volcano volcano weighs about three
ounces<00:00:49.250> you<00:00:50.250> plug<00:00:50.550> it<00:00:50.670> in<00:00:50.850> oops<00:00:51.600> you<00:00:52.460> push<00:00:53.460> play

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:57.020 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.040 

now<00:00:58.020> it's<00:00:58.230> really<00:00:58.440> cool<00:00:58.829> about<00:00:59.160> it<00:00:59.340> is<00:00:59.640> that

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 
now it's really cool about it is that

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.460 
now it's really cool about it is that
you<00:01:01.050> can<00:01:01.199> adjust<00:01:01.320> it<00:01:01.710> give<00:01:02.399> it<00:01:02.430> a<00:01:02.520> little<00:01:02.579> turn

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
you can adjust it give it a little turn

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.920 
you can adjust it give it a little turn
and<00:01:04.470> you<00:01:04.589> get<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:04.739> deeper<00:01:05.220> bass<00:01:05.489> sound<00:01:06.180> so<00:01:06.750> there

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
and you get a deeper bass sound so there

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.020 
and you get a deeper bass sound so there
it<00:01:07.020> is<00:01:07.110> with<00:01:07.290> it

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
it is with it

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.270 
it is with it
doesn't<00:01:10.030> sound<00:01:10.240> as<00:01:10.390> good<00:01:10.420> a<00:01:10.780> little<00:01:10.900> bit<00:01:11.200> a<00:01:11.560> lot

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
doesn't sound as good a little bit a lot

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.640 
doesn't sound as good a little bit a lot
more<00:01:12.520> mid-range<00:01:12.930> lift<00:01:13.930> it<00:01:14.080> up<00:01:14.200> and<00:01:14.410> then<00:01:14.530> you

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:14.650 
more mid-range lift it up and then you

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:24.330 
more mid-range lift it up and then you
get<00:01:21.660> now<00:01:22.660> it's<00:01:22.840> really<00:01:23.020> cool<00:01:23.320> is<00:01:23.920> that<00:01:23.950> if<00:01:24.220> you

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
get now it's really cool is that if you

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:31.170 
get now it's really cool is that if you
have<00:01:24.520> to<00:01:27.360> take<00:01:28.360> the<00:01:28.480> same<00:01:28.720> adapter<00:01:30.060> plug<00:01:31.060> it

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
have to take the same adapter plug it

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.570 
have to take the same adapter plug it
into<00:01:31.330> the<00:01:31.510> back

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:33.580 
into the back

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.740 
into the back
turn<00:01:34.580> it<00:01:34.700> on<00:01:36.130> and<00:01:37.130> it<00:01:37.280> gets<00:01:37.430> even<00:01:37.580> louder<00:01:37.880> you

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
turn it on and it gets even louder you

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:45.940 
turn it on and it gets even louder you
can<00:01:38.870> do<00:01:38.930> the<00:01:39.050> same<00:01:39.260> thing<00:01:44.320> it's<00:01:45.320> pretty<00:01:45.530> cool

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
can do the same thing it's pretty cool

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.680 
can do the same thing it's pretty cool
theoretically<00:01:46.490> you<00:01:46.670> could<00:01:46.790> daisy<00:01:47.060> chain<00:01:47.480> as

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:47.690 
theoretically you could daisy chain as

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.410 
theoretically you could daisy chain as
many<00:01:48.080> as<00:01:48.320> you<00:01:48.590> want<00:01:48.620> but<00:01:49.610> what's<00:01:49.790> also<00:01:49.970> cool<00:01:50.240> as

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
many as you want but what's also cool as

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.200 
many as you want but what's also cool as
well<00:01:50.630> is<00:01:50.840> that<00:01:50.960> it<00:01:51.050> does<00:01:51.200> come<00:01:51.320> with<00:01:51.500> a<00:01:51.590> cable

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
well is that it does come with a cable

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.840 
well is that it does come with a cable
so<00:01:53.210> if<00:01:53.510> you'd<00:01:53.630> like<00:01:54.010> you<00:01:55.010> just<00:01:55.220> plug<00:01:55.460> into<00:01:55.640> the

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
so if you'd like you just plug into the

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.950 
so if you'd like you just plug into the
side<00:01:56.090> here<00:01:56.360> you<00:01:58.360> can<00:01:59.360> plug<00:01:59.510> in<00:01:59.630> the<00:01:59.720> charge

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
side here you can plug in the charge

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.260 
side here you can plug in the charge
cable<00:02:00.320> into<00:02:00.530> here<00:02:00.740> you<00:02:01.310> can<00:02:01.460> plug<00:02:01.610> it<00:02:01.730> into<00:02:01.880> any

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
cable into here you can plug it into any

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.570 
cable into here you can plug it into any
USB<00:02:03.110> charge<00:02:03.680> so<00:02:03.800> you<00:02:03.890> can<00:02:04.010> charge<00:02:04.220> it<00:02:04.370> up<00:02:04.460> you

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
USB charge so you can charge it up you

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.100 
USB charge so you can charge it up you
can<00:02:04.700> also<00:02:04.820> plug<00:02:05.060> it<00:02:05.210> into<00:02:05.330> your<00:02:05.450> computer<00:02:05.930> or

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
can also plug it into your computer or

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.200 
can also plug it into your computer or
if<00:02:06.680> you'd<00:02:06.950> like<00:02:06.980> you<00:02:07.400> can<00:02:07.490> actually<00:02:07.850> plug<00:02:08.030> it

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:08.210 
if you'd like you can actually plug it

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.410 
if you'd like you can actually plug it
right<00:02:08.360> into<00:02:08.600> your<00:02:08.810> computer<00:02:09.410> and<00:02:09.820> you<00:02:10.820> could

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
right into your computer and you could

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.380 
right into your computer and you could
be<00:02:11.510> charging<00:02:11.960> it<00:02:12.730> while<00:02:13.730> you're<00:02:13.910> listening<00:02:14.270> to

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
be charging it while you're listening to

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:20.320 
be charging it while you're listening to
the<00:02:16.540> orange<00:02:17.540> audio<00:02:18.280> volcano<00:02:19.280> cool<00:02:20.120> little

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330
