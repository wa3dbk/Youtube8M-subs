like<00:01:28.170> me<00:01:28.409> you<00:01:28.680> want<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.460> go<00:01:29.640> to<00:01:29.700> your<00:01:29.939> base<00:01:30.180> and

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
like me you want to go to your base and

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.270 
like me you want to go to your base and
queued<00:01:30.720> up<00:01:30.840> from<00:01:31.049> your<00:01:31.229> base<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.740> eliminate

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
queued up from your base to eliminate

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.640 
queued up from your base to eliminate
the<00:01:32.400> loading<00:01:32.790> screen<00:01:33.090> because<00:01:33.750> sometimes<00:01:34.290> you

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
the loading screen because sometimes you

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.560 
the loading screen because sometimes you
will<00:01:34.799> load<00:01:35.070> in<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.520> you're<00:01:35.820> already<00:01:36.090> half

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
will load in and you're already half

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.170 
will load in and you're already half
dead<00:01:36.900> by<00:01:37.170> time<00:01:37.470> you<00:01:37.680> load<00:01:37.890> into<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.369> match<00:01:38.579> so

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
dead by time you load into the match so

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.179 
dead by time you load into the match so
you<00:01:39.240> want<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:39.570> go<00:01:39.689> to<00:01:39.750> your<00:01:40.020> base<00:01:40.229> and<00:01:40.530> queue<00:01:41.100> it

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
you want to go to your base and queue it

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.370 
you want to go to your base and queue it
up<00:01:41.280> from<00:01:41.490> your<00:01:41.640> base<00:01:41.820> just<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:42.659> eliminate<00:01:42.960> that

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
up from your base just to eliminate that

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.200 
up from your base just to eliminate that
loading<00:01:43.799> screen<00:01:43.829> so<00:01:44.399> whereas<00:01:44.700> you<00:01:44.850> can<00:01:45.000> just

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
loading screen so whereas you can just

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.510 
loading screen so whereas you can just
it<00:01:45.689> would<00:01:45.869> just<00:01:46.079> switch<00:01:46.710> you<00:01:46.890> over<00:01:46.920> and

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
it would just switch you over and

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.429 
it would just switch you over and
without<00:01:47.970> going<00:01:48.180> into<00:01:48.479> any<00:01:48.630> loading<00:01:49.049> screen

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
without going into any loading screen

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.200 
without going into any loading screen
you<00:01:49.950> will<00:01:50.130> see<00:01:50.310> that<00:01:50.460> in<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.759> video<00:01:51.030> in<00:01:51.180> the
