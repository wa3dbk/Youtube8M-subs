00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:06.069
 hello all guys I'm the vegan cat 

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:09.780
 I wanted to make a blog because I'm 

00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:12.579
 pretty angry and I've done it today 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.249
 Do not do it another day when you are 

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:17.790
 even more pissed off and I would like to know 

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:22.120
 what happens to veterinarians 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:24.680
 Spaniards I do not understand why they are like that 

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:26.660
 because they act in that way 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.180
 because they do what they do because 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.160
 things do them the way they do 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.620
 cases pay for doing things wrong 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:37.280
 perhaps they have lost the reality of what 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.960
 it 's your job I sometimes think the 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.690
 veterinarians reject veterinarians 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.180
 because they do not know what to do is true 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:47.470
 that not all are like that I will not put 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:49.780
 all in the same bag but 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:53.200
 the vast majority with which I have to 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:55.510
 find is amazing sometimes there is no 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:59.050
 you can question simply why not 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:02.370
 you have the race I do not know how or how 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:06.730
 talk about this topic without pretending 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:09.280
 offend anyone but at the same time 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:12.220
 as a call the sanity if a 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.920
 veterinarian does not have any kind of 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:19.240
 vocation if you do not seem to like 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:23.100
 animals yes that you go with that has 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:27.030
 broken a nail and want to sacrifice them 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:29.640
 but what happens seriously what happens to you 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.420
 Sometimes I feel like I like 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:37.560
 dÃ©u companies as well with them diesen 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:39.840
 a plus every time they sacrifice it or I 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.960
 I do not know when it really is everything 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.240
 against more animals have more 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.180
 business for them 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.979
 troops, even if you want to kill all the 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.710
 bugs that go through your queries 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.320
 A) Yes 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.810
 I do not understand why an animal has 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.760
 abandoned an animal that has in 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.700
 welcome waiting for a new one again 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.219
 home 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.860
 have to have fewer privileges than 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:07.470
 one that has a home 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.360
 and those that you do not have in shelter maybe not 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.210
 you will understand this with those who have the 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.430
 lucky to deal with another kind of 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:18.270
 veterinarians that I tell you I 've had 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:21.650
 lucky to deal with veterinarians who 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:25.459
 they are really veterinarians 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:28.069
 but most of you already tell you that I do not know what 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:30.799
 it happens to them that when the channel does not 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:32.930
 they'll shit it in another if you do not like it 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:36.379
 your work 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:39.980
 change jobs if you are afraid of 

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:44.270
 animals because those vets if you 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:46.970
 They are disgusting because I am a veterinarian 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:51.050
 we really fills save the life 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:55.130
 an animal considers more letting it die 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:57.500
 or sacrifice it to the first exchange I 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:00.860
 I know a lot of people that I 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:03.260
 is watching he will not say anything but he 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.990
 understands why I say so many things 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.060
 that I will not say and 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:11.540
 because I do not want to enter into a 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:14.180
 controversial because there are other countries there 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.810
 excellent excellent veterinarians 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.810
 surgeons 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:23.030
 because I can not see it here in Spain 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:25.500
 there are people totally capable of doing what 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:28.040
 that I only want 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.030
 that they open their eyes a little and 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.920
 think again because if they have 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.620
 veterinarians and if they did it because no 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.140
 I gave them the note we look for another job 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.570
 that will come better and if they did 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:43.290
 really for the love of animals 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:45.810
 regain that passion and do it for 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:49.550
 them so well see you in the 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.550
 next video then
