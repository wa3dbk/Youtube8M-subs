well don't want to have to do that every

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:58.179 
well don't want to have to do that every
time<00:03:54.919> and<00:03:55.930> sat<00:03:56.930> on<00:03:57.109> it<00:03:57.230> and<00:03:57.409> then<00:03:57.859> I'm<00:03:58.010> like

00:03:58.179 --> 00:03:58.189 
time and sat on it and then I'm like

00:03:58.189 --> 00:04:01.240 
time and sat on it and then I'm like
well<00:03:58.549> I<00:03:58.579> could<00:03:59.439> because<00:04:00.439> i'm<00:04:00.590> using<00:04:00.919> the<00:04:01.040> lady

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
well I could because i'm using the lady

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:06.369 
well I could because i'm using the lady
timer<00:04:01.639> /<00:04:02.000> app<00:04:03.760> I<00:04:04.760> know<00:04:05.510> if<00:04:05.629> I<00:04:05.750> sched<00:04:06.019> all<00:04:06.200> this

00:04:06.369 --> 00:04:06.379 
timer / app I know if I sched all this

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:11.699 
timer / app I know if I sched all this
already<00:04:06.730> this<00:04:07.730> app<00:04:08.000> is<00:04:08.329> the<00:04:08.780> lady<00:04:09.019> timer<00:04:09.760> and

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:11.709 
already this app is the lady timer and

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:16.509 
already this app is the lady timer and
so<00:04:13.000> it<00:04:14.000> tells<00:04:14.419> you<00:04:14.689> when<00:04:14.959> you're<00:04:14.989> most<00:04:15.519> fertile

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:16.519 
so it tells you when you're most fertile

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:18.610 
so it tells you when you're most fertile
ovulate<00:04:17.389> and<00:04:17.419> all<00:04:17.630> that<00:04:17.870> and<00:04:18.169> then<00:04:18.229> when<00:04:18.530> you

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
ovulate and all that and then when you

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.080 
ovulate and all that and then when you
should<00:04:18.799> have<00:04:18.889> your<00:04:19.010> period<00:04:19.220> is<00:04:19.430> it<00:04:19.579> so<00:04:19.970> it's

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
should have your period is it so it's

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:22.450 
should have your period is it so it's
kind<00:04:20.269> of<00:04:20.329> cool<00:04:20.599> to<00:04:20.630> even<00:04:20.959> track<00:04:21.229> your<00:04:21.470> period

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
kind of cool to even track your period

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:23.830 
kind of cool to even track your period
on<00:04:22.639> there<00:04:22.849> it's<00:04:23.030> supposed<00:04:23.360> to<00:04:23.479> tell<00:04:23.659> you<00:04:23.750> you

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840
