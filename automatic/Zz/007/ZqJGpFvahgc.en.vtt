00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:16.090
 me 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:20.560
 Yes I will continue to answer comments today is a main product role 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:25.270
 I want you to tell me about the black, but the breathing is painful 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:30.770
 150 meters is the limit I am not good at swimming slowly 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:35.720
 Hand can not be only in one of the twice profit is 4 times 2 times countries 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:40.170
 But more will be said to strain too much in the future would be good or Chikki 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:46.850
 It is that I do not understand even if I do not know the power 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:48.170
 This Well it is but a little I do not know and do not look at the Toka the swim 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.180
 That 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:55.070
 Strangely 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:01:00.980
 I do not think it is necessary to determine the number of breaths 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:07.150
 So I think it would be better to make diz instead 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:07.150
 For example, if it is the action of Emma-breathing 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.290
 The form 121212 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.440
 I can get a nose overnight 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:20.020
 There Hmm 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:25.900
 I think it would be better to make the rhythm in the form of 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:30.640
 Gone is surprisingly this breathing trouble of Tteyuu that would unexpectedly become this breathing painful 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:34.460
 I'm out breathing afterward , but I can't make a rhythm . 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:39.320
 a In the smell while the rhythm of this body is not ready 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:42.440
 I think that there are many things, so always make as much as possible and 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:50.119
 Where Tteyuu 150m limit 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:53.600
 First Nde I think that the adversely the nagana voice is a little distance to go to 25m relax 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:59.689
 Why First, once in each of should we reach out 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:02:02.990
 A little biz 6 I like a short distance rather than to challenge the long grade 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:06.350
 It is 25m that I will make 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:08.720
 Please try to gradually doing extended to gradually 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.390
 How is it? 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:15.230
 It is this big question 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:19.400
 Well, that's why I still have something I don't understand 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:25.520
 I think there are many things I can not do even if I can 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:31.380
 Also everyone You and N Hayashi it is another long-awaited and this music is more and more comments taken 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:39.270
 Is if you do not know even it's we create a system that will more and more acceptance of I mean 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:44.850
 I will answer it soon that everyone will ring on that day, so you practice 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:48.740
 I think that everyone will come up with a question for a minute, so I will wait by all means, so the contents of today 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:53.390
 See you again and 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:54.380
 From that part I say I Do I ah in this kind of wind to see the videos only have been linked by all means 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.920
 I think 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.920
 There was
