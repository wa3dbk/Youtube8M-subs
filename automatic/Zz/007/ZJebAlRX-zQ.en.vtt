00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 hello how about in this video for 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:07.290
 show you a nest of starlings I think 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.450
 is what we call starlings the 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.019
 black birds that I discovered in one 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.019
 of the cypresses 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.400
 judging by the egg by one of the 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:20.490
 eggs for two babies that have already been born 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:24.050
 and there is still an egg and for the egg 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.550
 I think it's that kind of bird 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.880
 in the nest was in that cypress tree there 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:30.070
 as you can see, it 's pretty 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:34.259
 it's pretty flat on top and they've 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.259
 used to make the nest 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.620
 there are two pups you see that it is believed that 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.820
 his mother has come and he has opened his mouth 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.800
 to eat the other one too 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.940
 there are two young and one egg has not yet 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:57.610
 cooked the last egg 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.440
 Well, nothing is 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.800
 we are going to leave them now so that the 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.570
 light mother can continue to feed 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.780
 because it seems you have enough 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.780
 man 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:23.950
 there we can see the mother yes 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:27.299
 it seems to be in a starling 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.299
 they have given me friends 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.270
 to feed 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.860
 good to say that the mother or 

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:35.870
 father 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:39.010
 Here you can see the nest with deer 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.010
 very small successes 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:45.520
 and good yet 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.520
 you can see it still chosen 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:50.260
 and we are going to leave it so that it can come 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.670
 the mother incubate good as this has been 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.470
 a small sample of the fauna that 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.440
 he lives in the home garden among the 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:58.600
 bushes and trees we cover with some 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.480
 nest of some other species that does not 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:05.760
 we had seen we will continue to show 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.760
 well then until next time
