00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:17.430
 yes hello people is a literal one 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:20.789
 we show at anno 15 03 here you see 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.930
 it can be again at 15 o'clock 37 or 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.570
 I'll hedge 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.630
 so that we get more money what 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.090
 yes, now I'll show you this as 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.059
 first goes well so or 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:36.960
 Computer here makes me do that 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:39.510
 where it goes on computer then times 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:43.590
 in front of your computer linux or base 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.300
 which pc acer or asus after and 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.270
 I'm going to go sing now then I'm going 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.820
 on programs in parentheses x 86 you can 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.449
 and then go here on calls 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.890
 to accept 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:58.020
 3 then on data and b groups 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:04.140
 I 'll be very short for this 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:06.720
 not noticed programs on 15 03 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:13.590
 So I could do it differently with everyone 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:15.780
 make 503 data groups then you go 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.340
 where we can open the groups so 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.330
 but i would like you the first time 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:26.340
 guess right click never edit eight 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:29.220
 open with editor then you do that 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.020
 small here and you can see it here now 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.090
 now stand the whole price 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.150
 what should be up there a bit 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.329
 for demand goods as are usually 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.560
 this here 45 or so with food 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:43.320
 So here the demanded goods are the 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:47.820
 yes, people need you if you 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:50.790
 here is food 280 then pay 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.770
 for this 82 usually 40 weapons 40 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.560
 or I do not know now whatever 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.509
 would have to arise there is currently 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.420
 grows and 445 I think is normal 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:03.479
 Just write here 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:07.470
 299 or 1000 I do not know how much you know 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:10.800
 I always want to do that 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.300
 sometimes three moments if you can 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.709
 you change all the things here 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.040
 For example , I have 220 250 spices 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.750
 down 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:24.170
 one goes to file save as 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:26.970
 you walk it that way on the desktop like that 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.680
 the groups have to name that 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.959
 stay that must be called b groups and 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:34.769
 then save that on the desktop then 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:35.130
 Do you have this down below? 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:38.730
 Left 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:40.709
 then you can close it again like that 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.959
 and then you'll be alright again 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.880
 I 'm going to make you small so you take it 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:49.160
 this file and pushes the in here 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:51.480
 but comes this file and here 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:55.310
 There is already a file 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:58.500
 these same took place in one place 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:01.260
 now clicked move and replace 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:04.319
 not that and not that at the time 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.060
 move and replace you need 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:09.560
 administrators are given both 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:12.560
 blocks continue on 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.959
 so now became 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.630
 the other one erased the other and you 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:19.190
 now have the file in there so now 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:22.450
 I show you that worked too 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:26.500
 goes the 1 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.500
 it always takes a bit of your time 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.459
 customer still it packs a bit now 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:37.190
 with me because that does not work with me 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:55.700
 while recording and playing games but 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:58.959
 I hope you see it yet extremely so 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:01.010
 it is here on single player and 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:10.950
 games load depending on what kind 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:15.720
 play and go ok then wait 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:18.150
 little apology if the music 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:21.359
 So now is a bit loud and 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:25.260
 louder to talk so well that mine 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:27.540
 small world like that and if you are here now 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:33.200
 on such a house clicks then you see 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:35.790
 yes I already have 16,000 270 in 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:39.889
 so in positive and if you are now 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:42.389
 here on these markets you click here 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:46.290
 You see, we pay for example 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:49.020
 tobacco 135 for spices 270 s 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:51.139
 it was realized that here you are 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.139
 knowledge 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:05:00.540
 after the food is so now 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:02.970
 here 300 for food and 228 for salt like that 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:06.050
 this will normally be 540 or so and 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:06.050
 he can change that 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:14.130
 yes that 's it and I hope it has 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:17.820
 you like it 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:20.240
