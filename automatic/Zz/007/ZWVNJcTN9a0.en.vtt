majora so let's go back and take a look
at<00:01:04.400> snapping<00:01:04.879> bite<00:01:05.059> let's<00:01:05.840> say<00:01:06.050> the<00:01:06.200> damage

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
at snapping bite let's say the damage

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.260 
at snapping bite let's say the damage
was<00:01:06.770> initially<00:01:07.370> rolled<00:01:07.610> for<00:01:09.190> 675,000<00:01:10.270> first

was initially rolled for 675,000 first

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:12.910 
was initially rolled for 675,000 first
this<00:01:11.479> damage<00:01:11.900> would<00:01:12.020> be<00:01:12.080> mitigated<00:01:12.740> by<00:01:12.770> a

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
this damage would be mitigated by a

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.469 
this damage would be mitigated by a
passive<00:01:13.490> physical<00:01:13.880> damage<00:01:14.210> reduction

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
passive physical damage reduction

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:17.740 
passive physical damage reduction
granted<00:01:15.050> by<00:01:15.170> sanctuary<00:01:16.300> armor<00:01:17.300> would<00:01:17.510> also

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
granted by sanctuary armor would also

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.140 
granted by sanctuary armor would also
come<00:01:18.110> into<00:01:18.260> effect<00:01:18.470> now<00:01:19.340> the<00:01:19.400> character<00:01:19.909> sheet

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:20.150 
come into effect now the character sheet

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.420 
come into effect now the character sheet
gives<00:01:20.450> a<00:01:20.630> physical<00:01:21.020> damage<00:01:21.409> mitigation<00:01:21.650> value

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
gives a physical damage mitigation value

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.260 
gives a physical damage mitigation value
that<00:01:23.360> you<00:01:23.510> would<00:01:23.630> have<00:01:23.840> versus<00:01:24.380> a<00:01:24.409> level<00:01:24.740> 90

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
that you would have versus a level 90

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.290 
that you would have versus a level 90
tortas<00:01:26.270> however<00:01:26.870> is<00:01:27.050> a<00:01:27.110> level<00:01:27.500> 93<00:01:28.100> boss<00:01:28.310> so<00:01:29.120> the

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:29.300 
tortas however is a level 93 boss so the

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.940 
tortas however is a level 93 boss so the
damage<00:01:29.600> reduction<00:01:29.900> our<00:01:30.230> armor<00:01:30.530> provides

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
damage reduction our armor provides

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.370 
damage reduction our armor provides
against<00:01:31.580> or<00:01:31.790> toes<00:01:32.000> can<00:01:32.600> be<00:01:32.750> determined<00:01:33.320> with

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
against or toes can be determined with

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.040 
against or toes can be determined with
this<00:01:33.680> formula<00:01:34.310> if<00:01:34.490> we<00:01:35.210> were<00:01:35.270> to<00:01:35.480> plug<00:01:35.690> in<00:01:35.870> the

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.050 
this formula if we were to plug in the

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.070 
this formula if we were to plug in the
variables<00:01:36.560> using<00:01:37.010> my<00:01:37.610> armor<00:01:38.090> value<00:01:38.420> then<00:01:38.870> we

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080 
variables using my armor value then we

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.040 
variables using my armor value then we
would<00:01:39.200> get<00:01:39.350> 50.8<00:01:40.220> percent<00:01:40.850> damage<00:01:41.600> reduction

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.050 
would get 50.8 percent damage reduction

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.410 
would get 50.8 percent damage reduction
against<00:01:42.680> physical<00:01:43.130> attacks<00:01:43.220> so<00:01:44.000> now<00:01:44.150> we<00:01:44.210> can

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
against physical attacks so now we can

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.750 
against physical attacks so now we can
apply<00:01:44.510> the<00:01:44.660> damage<00:01:45.140> reduction<00:01:45.380> from<00:01:45.740> armor<00:01:46.190> to

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:46.760 
apply the damage reduction from armor to

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.030 
apply the damage reduction from armor to
the<00:01:46.790> snapping<00:01:47.330> bite<00:01:47.510> attack<00:01:47.840> which<00:01:48.530> reduces

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
the snapping bite attack which reduces

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.270 
the snapping bite attack which reduces
the<00:01:49.280> damage<00:01:49.430> taking<00:01:50.030> considerably<00:01:51.100> let's<00:01:52.100> say

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
the damage taking considerably let's say

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.610 
the damage taking considerably let's say
I<00:01:52.310> got<00:01:52.550> lucky<00:01:53.000> and<00:01:53.120> block<00:01:53.390> the<00:01:53.600> attack<00:01:53.930> we

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:54.620 
I got lucky and block the attack we

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.200 
I got lucky and block the attack we
would<00:01:54.740> gain<00:01:54.920> an<00:01:55.070> additional<00:01:55.340> thirty<00:01:55.850> percent

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
would gain an additional thirty percent

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.020 
would gain an additional thirty percent
damage<00:01:56.450> reduction<00:01:57.010> now<00:01:58.010> if<00:01:58.610> we<00:01:58.820> aren't

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
damage reduction now if we aren't

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.210 
damage reduction now if we aren't
completely<00:01:59.540> awful<00:02:00.080> at<00:02:00.290> playing<00:02:00.770> a<00:02:00.890> protection
