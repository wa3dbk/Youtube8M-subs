they<00:06:37.569> might<00:06:37.779> have<00:06:38.620> an<00:06:38.770> assistant<00:06:39.039> and<00:06:39.550> I<00:06:39.610> think

00:06:39.839 --> 00:06:39.849 
they might have an assistant and I think

00:06:39.849 --> 00:06:41.189 
they might have an assistant and I think
when<00:06:39.969> you<00:06:40.060> watch<00:06:40.240> that<00:06:40.270> side<00:06:40.719> of<00:06:40.779> him<00:06:41.020> I<00:06:41.080> know

00:06:41.189 --> 00:06:41.199 
when you watch that side of him I know

00:06:41.199 --> 00:06:42.929 
when you watch that side of him I know
he's<00:06:41.289> not<00:06:41.409> the<00:06:41.529> artists<00:06:41.800> working<00:06:42.009> playable

00:06:42.929 --> 00:06:42.939 
he's not the artists working playable

00:06:42.939 --> 00:06:45.360 
he's not the artists working playable
the<00:06:43.599> assists<00:06:44.020> that<00:06:44.139> he<00:06:44.229> does<00:06:44.409> and<00:06:44.439> round<00:06:45.249> the

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:45.370 
the assists that he does and round the

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:47.179 
the assists that he does and round the
box<00:06:45.490> is<00:06:45.729> quite<00:06:45.939> clever<00:06:46.210> from<00:06:46.419> the<00:06:46.539> movement<00:06:46.960> so

00:06:47.179 --> 00:06:47.189 
box is quite clever from the movement so

00:06:47.189 --> 00:06:50.339 
box is quite clever from the movement so
and<00:06:48.189> I<00:06:48.310> think<00:06:48.339> Lee<00:06:48.849> becomes<00:06:49.300> very<00:06:49.509> channeled

00:06:50.339 --> 00:06:50.349 
and I think Lee becomes very channeled

00:06:50.349 --> 00:06:52.409 
and I think Lee becomes very channeled
in<00:06:50.860> what<00:06:51.039> he<00:06:51.129> does<00:06:51.279> and<00:06:51.460> predictable<00:06:52.089> was<00:06:52.270> like

00:06:52.409 --> 00:06:52.419 
in what he does and predictable was like

00:06:52.419 --> 00:06:55.019 
in what he does and predictable was like
single<00:06:52.779> and<00:06:53.319> looking<00:06:54.039> to<00:06:54.249> bow<00:06:54.550> warren<00:06:54.909> ellis
