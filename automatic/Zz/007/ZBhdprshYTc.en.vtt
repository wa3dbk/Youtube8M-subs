how much the difference it makes
recording<00:00:15.590> but<00:00:16.609> usually<00:00:17.609> this<00:00:17.699> game<00:00:17.940> is<00:00:18.150> not

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
recording but usually this game is not

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.170 
recording but usually this game is not
so<00:00:18.810> laggy<00:00:19.529> but<00:00:19.740> when<00:00:20.039> i<00:00:20.070> start<00:00:20.490> recording<00:00:20.820> it

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
so laggy but when i start recording it

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
up in in air hauler to get another

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.020 
up in in air hauler to get another
airplane<00:00:42.030> because<00:00:42.329> i've<00:00:43.290> flown<00:00:44.010> so<00:00:44.489> many

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
airplane because i've flown so many

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.720 
airplane because i've flown so many
flights<00:00:45.390> and<00:00:45.780> i'm<00:00:45.989> still<00:00:46.530> a<00:00:46.920> long<00:00:47.280> way<00:00:47.550> off

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
flights and i'm still a long way off

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.860 
flights and i'm still a long way off
because<00:00:48.180> it<00:00:49.140> seems<00:00:49.379> like<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.739> use<00:00:50.129> value<00:00:50.870> of

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
because it seems like the use value of

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.799 
because it seems like the use value of
this<00:00:52.020> aircraft<00:00:52.649> is<00:00:52.860> not<00:00:53.129> a<00:00:53.160> lot<00:00:53.430> like<00:00:53.809> 40,000

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
this aircraft is not a lot like 40,000

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.560 
this aircraft is not a lot like 40,000
the<00:00:55.469> cheapest<00:00:56.190> airplane<00:00:56.699> which<00:00:56.910> is<00:00:57.090> like<00:00:57.300> an

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
the cheapest airplane which is like an

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.959 
the cheapest airplane which is like an
upgrade<00:00:58.079> from<00:00:58.230> this<00:00:58.469> airplane<00:00:58.829> it's<00:00:59.730> like

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
upgrade from this airplane it's like

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.520 
upgrade from this airplane it's like
thing<00:01:00.239> at<00:01:00.570> least<00:01:01.579> 120,000<00:01:02.579> so<00:01:03.439> basically<00:01:04.439> i

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
thing at least 120,000 so basically i

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.550 
thing at least 120,000 so basically i
need<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:04.979> earn<00:01:05.220> a<00:01:05.250> lot<00:01:05.760> of<00:01:06.119> money<00:01:06.360> because<00:01:07.290> i'm

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
need to earn a lot of money because i'm

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.230 
need to earn a lot of money because i'm
on<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.920> hardest<00:01:09.830> difficulty<00:01:10.830> so<00:01:11.760> i<00:01:11.790> think<00:01:11.939> i'm

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
on the hardest difficulty so i think i'm

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.480 
on the hardest difficulty so i think i'm
going<00:01:12.420> to<00:01:12.479> be<00:01:12.600> flying<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:13.170> c-max<00:01:13.650> for<00:01:14.010> quite<00:01:14.250> a

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
going to be flying the c-max for quite a

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.969 
going to be flying the c-max for quite a
while<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.570> other<00:01:15.720> thing<00:01:15.930> that's<00:01:15.960> annoying<00:01:16.470> is

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
while the other thing that's annoying is

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.100 
while the other thing that's annoying is
sometimes<00:01:17.700> like<00:01:18.090> just<00:01:18.450> before<00:01:18.570> i<00:01:18.810> started

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
sometimes like just before i started

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.370 
sometimes like just before i started
recording<00:01:19.470> this<00:01:19.710> video<00:01:19.920> i<00:01:20.369> try<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.330> fly<00:01:21.900> a

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.250 

mission<00:01:25.380> and

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:28.260 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.660 

for<00:01:29.130> some<00:01:29.370> reason<00:01:30.030> when<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:31.350> when<00:01:31.680> I<00:01:32.070> open

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
for some reason when the when I open

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.040 
for some reason when the when I open
explain<00:01:34.460> the<00:01:35.460> airplane<00:01:36.180> freaked<00:01:36.750> out

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:37.050 
explain the airplane freaked out

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.620 
explain the airplane freaked out
occasionally<00:01:37.980> in<00:01:38.580> x-plane<00:01:38.850> it<00:01:39.120> would<00:01:39.270> do<00:01:39.420> this

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
occasionally in x-plane it would do this

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.890 
occasionally in x-plane it would do this
I<00:01:39.810> don't<00:01:39.960> know<00:01:40.140> why<00:01:40.440> but<00:01:40.830> it's<00:01:41.730> like<00:01:42.000> yeah<00:01:42.300> when

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:42.900 
I don't know why but it's like yeah when

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.230 
I don't know why but it's like yeah when
the<00:01:43.050> airplane<00:01:43.410> loaded<00:01:43.980> I<00:01:44.280> didn't<00:01:44.910> have<00:01:45.060> any

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
the airplane loaded I didn't have any

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.360 
the airplane loaded I didn't have any
like<00:01:45.660> I<00:01:45.840> wasn't<00:01:46.080> really<00:01:46.350> touching<00:01:46.920> any<00:01:47.070> of<00:01:47.190> the

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:47.370 
like I wasn't really touching any of the

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:51.800 
like I wasn't really touching any of the
controls<00:01:47.880> usually<00:01:50.210> explain<00:01:51.210> it<00:01:51.450> will<00:01:51.600> just

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
controls usually explain it will just

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.270 
controls usually explain it will just
open<00:01:52.910> and<00:01:54.410> obviously<00:01:55.410> the<00:01:55.590> airplane<00:01:56.010> it<00:01:56.190> will

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
open and obviously the airplane it will

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.390 
open and obviously the airplane it will
be<00:01:56.430> on<00:01:56.580> the<00:01:56.780> runway<00:01:57.780> or<00:01:58.080> you<00:01:58.350> know<00:01:58.500> at<00:01:59.130> the

00:01:59.390 --> 00:01:59.400 
be on the runway or you know at the

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.570 
be on the runway or you know at the
airport<00:01:59.850> on<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.540> ground<00:02:00.870> waiting<00:02:01.770> for<00:02:02.340> you<00:02:02.430> to

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
airport on the ground waiting for you to

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.390 
airport on the ground waiting for you to
start<00:02:02.910> now<00:02:03.570> very<00:02:03.960> very<00:02:04.320> occasionally<00:02:05.190> what

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 
start now very very occasionally what

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.490 
start now very very occasionally what
happens<00:02:05.880> for<00:02:06.060> some<00:02:06.270> reason<00:02:06.690> is<00:02:06.870> it<00:02:07.080> will<00:02:07.229> load

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
happens for some reason is it will load

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.889 
happens for some reason is it will load
and<00:02:08.310> it<00:02:08.580> will<00:02:08.760> freak<00:02:09.149> out<00:02:09.360> and<00:02:09.420> it<00:02:09.750> will

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
and it will freak out and it will

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.830 
and it will freak out and it will
suddenly<00:02:10.170> like<00:02:10.679> take<00:02:11.130> off<00:02:11.430> and<00:02:11.790> flip<00:02:12.090> flip<00:02:12.660> in

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
suddenly like take off and flip flip in

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.770 
suddenly like take off and flip flip in
the<00:02:12.870> air<00:02:13.880> unfortunately<00:02:14.880> that<00:02:14.910> just<00:02:15.300> happened

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
the air unfortunately that just happened

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.980 
the air unfortunately that just happened
so<00:02:16.160> although<00:02:17.160> I<00:02:17.340> was<00:02:17.670> trying<00:02:18.000> to<00:02:18.060> fly<00:02:18.420> really

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
so although I was trying to fly really

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.060 
so although I was trying to fly really
carefully<00:02:20.930> you<00:02:21.930> know<00:02:22.080> I've<00:02:22.560> been<00:02:22.800> playing

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
carefully you know I've been playing

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.270 
carefully you know I've been playing
really<00:02:23.280> carefully<00:02:23.760> and<00:02:23.910> I<00:02:23.970> had<00:02:24.209> two

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
really carefully and I had two

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.010 
really carefully and I had two
deliveries<00:02:26.280> loaded<00:02:26.820> on<00:02:26.940> my<00:02:26.970> airplane<00:02:27.690> and

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
deliveries loaded on my airplane and

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.910 
deliveries loaded on my airplane and
when<00:02:28.320> it<00:02:28.470> flips<00:02:28.800> out<00:02:29.040> like<00:02:29.340> that<00:02:29.610> it<00:02:29.940> still

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
when it flips out like that it still

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.320 
when it flips out like that it still
registers<00:02:31.920> on<00:02:32.130> air<00:02:32.430> hablar<00:02:32.910> because<00:02:33.209> it

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
registers on air hablar because it

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.030 
registers on air hablar because it
thinks<00:02:33.570> you're<00:02:33.900> flying<00:02:34.260> it<00:02:34.530> thinks<00:02:34.920> it's

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
thinks you're flying it thinks it's

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.520 
thinks you're flying it thinks it's
you'd<00:02:35.310> as<00:02:35.520> doing<00:02:35.880> that<00:02:35.910> crazy<00:02:36.390> stuff<00:02:36.780> so<00:02:37.350> then

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
you'd as doing that crazy stuff so then

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.729 
you'd as doing that crazy stuff so then
I<00:02:37.770> had<00:02:38.040> two<00:02:39.140> deliveries<00:02:40.140> that<00:02:40.320> then<00:02:40.530> got

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
I had two deliveries that then got

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:43.430 
I had two deliveries that then got
really<00:02:41.160> damaged<00:02:41.670> my<00:02:42.390> airplane<00:02:42.840> got<00:02:43.050> damaged

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
really damaged my airplane got damaged

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.770 
really damaged my airplane got damaged
it's<00:02:43.650> like<00:02:43.800> that's<00:02:44.010> gonna<00:02:44.250> cost<00:02:44.580> me<00:02:44.880> thousands

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
it's like that's gonna cost me thousands

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.380 
it's like that's gonna cost me thousands
right<00:02:46.050> there<00:02:46.350> so<00:02:47.220> that<00:02:47.580> kind<00:02:47.760> of<00:02:47.880> annoyed<00:02:48.150> me

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
right there so that kind of annoyed me

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.240 
right there so that kind of annoyed me
because<00:02:48.480> that's<00:02:48.660> going<00:02:48.959> to<00:02:49.050> actually<00:02:49.170> set<00:02:50.070> me

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
because that's going to actually set me

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.800 
because that's going to actually set me
back<00:02:50.400> even<00:02:50.850> further<00:02:51.090> I'm<00:02:51.390> going<00:02:51.570> to<00:02:51.630> have<00:02:51.750> to

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
back even further I'm going to have to

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.750 
back even further I'm going to have to
do<00:02:52.080> a<00:02:52.110> couple<00:02:52.410> of<00:02:52.680> missions<00:02:52.920> you<00:02:53.400> know<00:02:53.519> like

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
do a couple of missions you know like

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.440 
do a couple of missions you know like
flies<00:02:54.150> just<00:02:55.110> to<00:02:55.290> make<00:02:55.470> that<00:02:55.680> money<00:02:55.920> back<00:02:56.450> so

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
flies just to make that money back so

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.270 
flies just to make that money back so
that's<00:02:57.540> why<00:02:57.810> I<00:02:57.840> say<00:02:58.170> seriously<00:02:58.680> I'm<00:02:58.860> going<00:02:59.220> to

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
that's why I say seriously I'm going to

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.940 
that's why I say seriously I'm going to
be<00:02:59.370> flying<00:02:59.640> this<00:03:00.110> c-max<00:03:01.110> for<00:03:01.470> quite<00:03:01.769> a<00:03:01.800> long

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
be flying this c-max for quite a long

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.920 
be flying this c-max for quite a long
time<00:03:02.989> yeah<00:03:04.220> so<00:03:05.220> like<00:03:05.940> I<00:03:06.150> said<00:03:06.209> at<00:03:06.450> the<00:03:06.540> start<00:03:06.600> I

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
time yeah so like I said at the start I

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.620 
time yeah so like I said at the start I
wanted<00:03:07.170> to<00:03:07.260> show<00:03:07.590> you<00:03:07.620> guys<00:03:07.830> this<00:03:08.630> landing

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
wanted to show you guys this landing

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.050 
wanted to show you guys this landing
because<00:03:10.170> it<00:03:10.380> wasn't<00:03:10.709> in<00:03:11.040> my<00:03:11.130> eyes<00:03:11.580> it<00:03:11.910> was<00:03:12.000> a

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
because it wasn't in my eyes it was a

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.420 
because it wasn't in my eyes it was a
good<00:03:12.330> landing<00:03:12.840> one<00:03:13.380> of<00:03:13.470> my<00:03:13.590> first<00:03:13.890> good

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
good landing one of my first good

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.080 
good landing one of my first good
landings<00:03:14.970> I've<00:03:15.300> done<00:03:15.570> in<00:03:16.260> this<00:03:16.470> game<00:03:16.800> and<00:03:17.090> as

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
landings I've done in this game and as

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.060 
landings I've done in this game and as
you<00:03:18.239> can<00:03:18.390> see<00:03:18.420> the<00:03:18.750> weather<00:03:18.930> was<00:03:19.170> quite<00:03:19.500> rough

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
you can see the weather was quite rough

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.860 
you can see the weather was quite rough
it<00:03:20.370> was<00:03:20.400> quite<00:03:20.730> some<00:03:21.530> rainy<00:03:22.530> there<00:03:23.070> was<00:03:23.220> some

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
it was quite some rainy there was some

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:29.630 
it was quite some rainy there was some
low-lying<00:03:24.870> cloud<00:03:26.060> and<00:03:27.060> stuff<00:03:27.420> like<00:03:27.630> that

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
low-lying cloud and stuff like that

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.190 
low-lying cloud and stuff like that
but<00:03:30.569> it<00:03:31.380> was<00:03:31.560> you<00:03:32.490> know<00:03:32.520> I<00:03:32.880> think<00:03:33.540> I'm<00:03:33.810> slowly

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
but it was you know I think I'm slowly

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.260 
but it was you know I think I'm slowly
learning<00:03:34.530> when<00:03:35.340> I<00:03:35.370> first<00:03:35.730> started<00:03:35.910> playing

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.270 
learning when I first started playing

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.330 
learning when I first started playing
this<00:03:36.600> the<00:03:36.870> problem<00:03:37.200> i<00:03:37.290> had<00:03:37.530> i'm<00:03:37.890> just<00:03:38.160> going<00:03:38.310> to

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
this the problem i had i'm just going to

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.250 
this the problem i had i'm just going to
speed<00:03:38.640> this<00:03:38.670> up<00:03:39.030> wobble<00:03:39.510> in<00:03:39.600> this<00:03:39.780> little<00:03:40.080> bit

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
speed this up wobble in this little bit

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.820 
speed this up wobble in this little bit
they<00:03:41.190> go<00:03:41.430> problems<00:03:42.030> so<00:03:42.780> you<00:03:42.870> can<00:03:42.990> see<00:03:43.200> the<00:03:43.440> the

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
they go problems so you can see the the

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.699 
they go problems so you can see the the
one<00:03:44.040> ways<00:03:44.250> ahead<00:03:44.520> of<00:03:44.790> me<00:03:44.970> and<00:03:45.240> I'm<00:03:46.110> lining<00:03:46.440> out

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
one ways ahead of me and I'm lining out

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:52.310 
one ways ahead of me and I'm lining out
pretty<00:03:47.100> well<00:03:47.990> i<00:03:49.820> think<00:03:50.820> i've<00:03:51.180> had<00:03:51.990> an<00:03:52.170> issue

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
pretty well i think i've had an issue

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.640 
pretty well i think i've had an issue
like<00:03:52.890> since<00:03:53.670> i've<00:03:53.880> been<00:03:53.910> playing<00:03:54.240> explain<00:03:54.840> my

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
like since i've been playing explain my

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.300 
like since i've been playing explain my
landings<00:03:56.280> have<00:03:56.430> not<00:03:56.790> been<00:03:57.980> great<00:03:58.980> because

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
landings have not been great because

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.290 
landings have not been great because
i've<00:03:59.670> not<00:04:00.030> been<00:04:01.520> getting<00:04:02.520> to<00:04:02.940> a<00:04:02.970> lower

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:03.300 
i've not been getting to a lower

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.300 
i've not been getting to a lower
altitude<00:04:03.570> fast<00:04:04.380> enough<00:04:04.890> so<00:04:04.920> I've<00:04:05.190> been

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
altitude fast enough so I've been

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.870 
altitude fast enough so I've been
finding<00:04:05.700> that<00:04:06.239> I<00:04:06.300> keep<00:04:07.070> like<00:04:08.070> landing<00:04:08.730> at<00:04:08.850> the

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
finding that I keep like landing at the

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.360 
finding that I keep like landing at the
very<00:04:09.209> end<00:04:09.450> of<00:04:09.959> the<00:04:10.080> runway<00:04:10.320> and<00:04:10.860> not<00:04:11.100> on<00:04:11.310> the

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
very end of the runway and not on the

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.870 
very end of the runway and not on the
runway<00:04:12.120> you<00:04:12.660> know<00:04:12.920> it's<00:04:13.920> not<00:04:14.160> in<00:04:14.310> a<00:04:14.400> good

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
runway you know it's not in a good

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.870 
runway you know it's not in a good
position<00:04:15.090> because<00:04:15.570> I<00:04:15.810> don't<00:04:16.350> seem<00:04:16.769> to<00:04:16.950> get<00:04:17.359> my

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
position because I don't seem to get my

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.060 
position because I don't seem to get my
altitude<00:04:20.880> low<00:04:21.510> enough<00:04:21.810> fast<00:04:22.200> enough<00:04:22.440> but<00:04:22.830> I<00:04:22.890> am

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
altitude low enough fast enough but I am

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.380 
altitude low enough fast enough but I am
slowly<00:04:23.430> improving<00:04:24.800> so<00:04:25.800> this<00:04:25.950> was<00:04:26.130> one<00:04:26.400> landing

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:27.390 
slowly improving so this was one landing

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:31.040 
slowly improving so this was one landing
who<00:04:27.510> i<00:04:27.570> believe<00:04:27.690> i<00:04:28.520> did<00:04:29.520> a<00:04:29.550> lot<00:04:29.820> better<00:04:29.850> i<00:04:30.720> lined

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
who i believe i did a lot better i lined

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.310 
who i believe i did a lot better i lined
up<00:04:31.290> very<00:04:31.560> nicely<00:04:31.800> with<00:04:32.160> the<00:04:32.190> runway<00:04:32.669> I<00:04:33.110> got<00:04:34.110> my

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
up very nicely with the runway I got my

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.030 
up very nicely with the runway I got my
altitude<00:04:34.760> you<00:04:35.760> know<00:04:36.500> decreasing<00:04:37.500> at<00:04:37.650> a<00:04:37.680> good

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.040 
altitude you know decreasing at a good

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:44.540 
altitude you know decreasing at a good
rate<00:04:38.660> and<00:04:39.660> also<00:04:42.710> you<00:04:43.710> know<00:04:43.860> so<00:04:44.130> that<00:04:44.160> it<00:04:44.400> would

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550 
rate and also you know so that it would

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.180 
rate and also you know so that it would
kind<00:04:44.820> of<00:04:44.910> naturally<00:04:45.720> be<00:04:46.590> at<00:04:46.710> the<00:04:46.890> correct

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
kind of naturally be at the correct

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.730 
kind of naturally be at the correct
altitude<00:04:47.400> when<00:04:47.970> the<00:04:48.300> one<00:04:48.479> way<00:04:48.690> is<00:04:48.930> under<00:04:49.260> me<00:04:49.410> if

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
altitude when the one way is under me if

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.900 
altitude when the one way is under me if
you<00:04:49.890> know<00:04:50.010> what<00:04:50.220> I<00:04:50.250> mean<00:04:50.540> so<00:04:51.540> I<00:04:52.610> was<00:04:53.610> pretty

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:53.910 
you know what I mean so I was pretty

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:57.700 
you know what I mean so I was pretty
happy<00:04:54.150> with<00:04:54.450> that<00:04:54.510> say<00:04:55.320> the<00:04:55.470> least

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.710 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:01.290 

and

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.240 

quite<00:05:02.300> a<00:05:02.330> nice<00:05:02.659> approach<00:05:03.169> I<00:05:03.500> mean<00:05:03.710> it<00:05:03.830> still<00:05:04.069> is

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 
quite a nice approach I mean it still is

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:06.219 
quite a nice approach I mean it still is
not<00:05:04.430> perfect<00:05:05.000> I'm<00:05:05.090> sure<00:05:05.300> that<00:05:05.509> people<00:05:05.930> will<00:05:06.199> be

00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:06.229 
not perfect I'm sure that people will be

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:08.800 
not perfect I'm sure that people will be
out<00:05:06.349> of<00:05:06.469> paper<00:05:06.740> holes<00:05:07.039> in<00:05:07.280> it<00:05:07.400> my<00:05:08.210> airspeed<00:05:08.659> is

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:08.810 
out of paper holes in it my airspeed is

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:14.140 
out of paper holes in it my airspeed is
not<00:05:08.990> bad<00:05:11.020> maybe<00:05:12.020> a<00:05:12.139> little<00:05:12.379> bit<00:05:12.680> slow<00:05:13.310> I<00:05:13.699> don't

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.150 
not bad maybe a little bit slow I don't

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:21.209 
not bad maybe a little bit slow I don't
know<00:05:14.270> it<00:05:14.569> seems<00:05:14.780> ok<00:05:15.110> actually<00:05:18.699> here<00:05:19.699> we<00:05:19.819> go

00:05:21.209 --> 00:05:21.219 
know it seems ok actually here we go

00:05:21.219 --> 00:05:24.520 
know it seems ok actually here we go
usually<00:05:22.219> this<00:05:22.340> airplane<00:05:22.729> is<00:05:22.819> quite<00:05:23.360> lively<00:05:24.169> in

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:24.530 
usually this airplane is quite lively in

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:27.760 
usually this airplane is quite lively in
the<00:05:24.770> winds<00:05:25.539> so<00:05:26.539> you'll<00:05:26.930> see<00:05:27.199> that<00:05:27.349> as<00:05:27.530> I'm

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:27.770 
the winds so you'll see that as I'm

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:33.490 
the winds so you'll see that as I'm
coming<00:05:28.310> in<00:05:28.550> to<00:05:28.699> land<00:05:29.169> I'm<00:05:30.169> quite<00:05:30.919> all<00:05:32.409> over<00:05:33.409> the

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:33.500 
coming in to land I'm quite all over the

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.249 
coming in to land I'm quite all over the
world<00:05:33.650> a<00:05:33.919> little<00:05:34.129> bit<00:05:34.400> all<00:05:34.610> over<00:05:34.639> the<00:05:34.969> place

00:05:35.249 --> 00:05:35.259 
world a little bit all over the place

00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:38.580 
world a little bit all over the place
but<00:05:36.259> not<00:05:36.439> bad<00:05:36.650> up<00:05:36.889> and<00:05:37.219> I<00:05:37.340> held<00:05:37.580> it<00:05:37.759> pretty<00:05:38.000> well

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:38.590 
but not bad up and I held it pretty well

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:45.450 
but not bad up and I held it pretty well
not<00:05:39.590> bad

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:45.460 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:49.170 

yes<00:05:46.090> let's<00:05:47.050> see<00:05:47.199> if<00:05:47.410> it<00:05:47.530> was<00:05:47.650> a<00:05:47.680> heavy<00:05:48.180> landing

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:49.180 
yes let's see if it was a heavy landing

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:55.050 
yes let's see if it was a heavy landing
see<00:05:49.840> I'm<00:05:49.990> flailing<00:05:50.800> a<00:05:51.160> bit<00:05:51.310> there<00:05:53.910> starts<00:05:54.910> to

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:55.060 
see I'm flailing a bit there starts to

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:56.640 
see I'm flailing a bit there starts to
move<00:05:55.270> around<00:05:55.509> a<00:05:55.810> bit<00:05:55.840> i<00:05:55.960> try<00:05:56.259> to<00:05:56.319> bring<00:05:56.530> it<00:05:56.620> down

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:56.650 
move around a bit i try to bring it down

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:01.170 
move around a bit i try to bring it down
slowly<00:05:58.349> the<00:05:59.349> wheels<00:05:59.620> are<00:05:59.830> going<00:05:59.949> to<00:06:00.009> touch<00:06:00.250> it

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:01.180 
slowly the wheels are going to touch it

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:05.100 
slowly the wheels are going to touch it
was<00:06:01.509> ok<00:06:01.979> not<00:06:02.979> perfect<00:06:03.639> i<00:06:03.870> find<00:06:04.870> that<00:06:04.990> this

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:05.110 
was ok not perfect i find that this

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:07.710 
was ok not perfect i find that this
airplane<00:06:05.500> when<00:06:05.800> you<00:06:05.919> on<00:06:06.069> the<00:06:06.099> ground<00:06:06.449> likes<00:06:07.449> to

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:07.720 
airplane when you on the ground likes to

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:12.210 
airplane when you on the ground likes to
move<00:06:07.900> around<00:06:07.960> the<00:06:08.560> lot<00:06:10.380> there<00:06:11.380> you<00:06:11.470> go<00:06:11.590> so<00:06:11.979> i

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:12.220 
move around the lot there you go so i

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:15.140 
move around the lot there you go so i
would<00:06:12.400> say<00:06:12.580> that<00:06:12.610> so<00:06:13.360> far<00:06:13.389> my<00:06:13.990> best<00:06:14.259> x<00:06:14.650> plane

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:15.150 
would say that so far my best x plane

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:21.089 
would say that so far my best x plane
landing<00:06:16.150> so<00:06:16.870> far<00:06:18.270> it<00:06:19.270> is<00:06:19.660> not<00:06:20.020> I'm<00:06:20.380> sure<00:06:20.650> you

00:06:21.089 --> 00:06:21.099 
landing so far it is not I'm sure you

00:06:21.099 --> 00:06:22.770 
landing so far it is not I'm sure you
know<00:06:21.220> I<00:06:21.250> still<00:06:21.550> have<00:06:21.669> a<00:06:21.699> lot<00:06:21.789> to<00:06:22.030> learn<00:06:22.240> but

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:22.780 
know I still have a lot to learn but

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:25.920 
know I still have a lot to learn but
it's<00:06:23.680> like<00:06:23.860> I<00:06:24.009> said<00:06:24.039> in<00:06:24.370> a<00:06:24.669> previous<00:06:25.449> video

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:25.930 
it's like I said in a previous video

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:27.779 
it's like I said in a previous video
this<00:06:26.320> air<00:06:26.620> haul<00:06:26.889> the<00:06:27.070> thing<00:06:27.280> is<00:06:27.400> going<00:06:27.550> to<00:06:27.639> be<00:06:27.759> a

00:06:27.779 --> 00:06:27.789 
this air haul the thing is going to be a

00:06:27.789 --> 00:06:30.360 
this air haul the thing is going to be a
great<00:06:28.060> way<00:06:28.449> for<00:06:28.509> me<00:06:28.780> to<00:06:28.810> learn<00:06:29.169> how<00:06:29.229> to<00:06:29.650> do<00:06:30.039> that

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:30.370 
great way for me to learn how to do that

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:34.200 
great way for me to learn how to do that
thus<00:06:31.150> in<00:06:31.830> flying<00:06:32.849> because<00:06:33.849> I've<00:06:34.030> been

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:34.210 
thus in flying because I've been

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:36.480 
thus in flying because I've been
learning<00:06:34.360> so<00:06:34.810> much<00:06:35.050> about<00:06:35.110> the<00:06:35.590> basics<00:06:36.130> flying

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:36.490 
learning so much about the basics flying

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:39.480 
learning so much about the basics flying
an<00:06:36.610> aircraft<00:06:36.789> is<00:06:37.360> very<00:06:37.930> very<00:06:38.169> simple<00:06:38.490> like

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:39.490 
an aircraft is very very simple like

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:41.969 
an aircraft is very very simple like
this<00:06:39.729> one<00:06:40.000> I've<00:06:40.539> had<00:06:40.870> to<00:06:41.080> learn<00:06:41.259> the<00:06:41.320> very<00:06:41.740> very

00:06:41.969 --> 00:06:41.979 
this one I've had to learn the very very

00:06:41.979 --> 00:06:44.159 
this one I've had to learn the very very
basics<00:06:42.490> of<00:06:42.639> navigation<00:06:43.389> I've<00:06:43.599> had<00:06:43.810> to<00:06:43.990> learn

00:06:44.159 --> 00:06:44.169 
basics of navigation I've had to learn

00:06:44.169 --> 00:06:49.680 
basics of navigation I've had to learn
the<00:06:44.229> very<00:06:45.060> basics<00:06:46.060> VFR<00:06:47.020> flying<00:06:48.419> visual<00:06:49.419> flight

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:49.690 
the very basics VFR flying visual flight

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:53.670 
the very basics VFR flying visual flight
rules<00:06:49.979> flying<00:06:50.979> so<00:06:51.880> and<00:06:52.330> like<00:06:53.139> I<00:06:53.199> said<00:06:53.380> in<00:06:53.620> the

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:53.680 
rules flying so and like I said in the

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.230 
rules flying so and like I said in the
previous<00:06:53.919> video<00:06:54.250> I've<00:06:54.520> been<00:06:54.699> learning<00:06:54.849> how<00:06:55.180> to

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:55.240 
previous video I've been learning how to

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.860 
previous video I've been learning how to
trim<00:06:55.720> and<00:06:56.229> stuff<00:06:56.620> like<00:06:56.830> this<00:06:56.889> and<00:06:57.039> obviously

00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:57.870 
trim and stuff like this and obviously

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:01.080 
trim and stuff like this and obviously
the<00:06:58.870> takeoff<00:06:59.409> and<00:06:59.680> landing<00:07:00.490> stuff<00:07:00.789> in<00:07:00.940> this

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:01.090 
the takeoff and landing stuff in this

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:03.360 
the takeoff and landing stuff in this
airplane<00:07:01.479> if<00:07:01.930> I<00:07:02.139> can<00:07:02.409> actually<00:07:02.560> do<00:07:02.919> it<00:07:03.070> well<00:07:03.250> in

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:03.370 
airplane if I can actually do it well in

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:05.520 
airplane if I can actually do it well in
this<00:07:03.490> airplane<00:07:03.880> that<00:07:04.150> should<00:07:04.389> help<00:07:04.539> me<00:07:04.840> you

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:05.530 
this airplane that should help me you

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:06.930 
this airplane that should help me you
know<00:07:05.680> and<00:07:05.830> then<00:07:05.919> obviously<00:07:06.070> hopefully<00:07:06.789> in<00:07:06.909> the

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:06.940 
know and then obviously hopefully in the

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:09.060 
know and then obviously hopefully in the
future<00:07:07.150> I<00:07:07.419> be<00:07:07.570> able<00:07:07.719> to<00:07:07.780> upgrade<00:07:07.930> the<00:07:08.560> aircraft

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:09.070 
future I be able to upgrade the aircraft

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:11.909 
future I be able to upgrade the aircraft
in<00:07:09.250> air<00:07:09.400> hauler<00:07:09.930> to<00:07:10.930> get<00:07:11.169> a<00:07:11.199> slightly<00:07:11.590> better

00:07:11.909 --> 00:07:11.919 
in air hauler to get a slightly better

00:07:11.919 --> 00:07:14.939 
in air hauler to get a slightly better
one<00:07:12.340> so<00:07:13.150> that<00:07:13.449> then<00:07:13.780> i'll<00:07:14.229> probably<00:07:14.620> have<00:07:14.889> to

00:07:14.939 --> 00:07:14.949 
one so that then i'll probably have to
