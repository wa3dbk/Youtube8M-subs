a Greenlee 2003 pulsar broken wires are
frustrating<00:00:17.710> problem<00:00:18.100> it<00:00:18.369> can<00:00:18.550> be<00:00:18.640> caused<00:00:18.850> by

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:19.060 
frustrating problem it can be caused by

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.960 
frustrating problem it can be caused by
poor<00:00:19.330> splices<00:00:19.869> or<00:00:20.310> even<00:00:21.310> a<00:00:21.400> tree<00:00:21.640> root<00:00:21.820> that

poor splices or even a tree root that

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.120 
poor splices or even a tree root that
you're<00:00:22.119> growing<00:00:22.240> through<00:00:22.420> the<00:00:22.450> wire<00:00:23.130> many

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:24.130 
you're growing through the wire many

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.100 
you're growing through the wire many
times<00:00:24.460> the<00:00:25.090> only<00:00:25.180> way<00:00:25.360> to<00:00:25.419> fix<00:00:25.630> this<00:00:25.840> is<00:00:26.050> to

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:26.110 
times the only way to fix this is to

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:27.929 
times the only way to fix this is to
replace<00:00:26.590> the<00:00:26.800> entire<00:00:27.070> wire<00:00:27.369> from<00:00:27.880> the

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:27.939 
replace the entire wire from the

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:29.609 
replace the entire wire from the
controller<00:00:28.300> to<00:00:28.450> the<00:00:28.480> valve<00:00:28.720> I'm<00:00:29.410> going<00:00:29.560> to

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:29.619 
controller to the valve I'm going to

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:31.650 
controller to the valve I'm going to
show<00:00:29.710> you<00:00:29.770> a<00:00:29.860> better<00:00:29.950> way<00:00:30.070> I<00:00:30.369> used<00:00:31.210> a<00:00:31.329> volt<00:00:31.509> ohm

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:31.660 
show you a better way I used a volt ohm

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.450 
show you a better way I used a volt ohm
meter<00:00:31.869> to<00:00:32.079> verify<00:00:32.439> that<00:00:32.470> the<00:00:32.739> broken<00:00:32.950> wire<00:00:33.220> was

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:33.460 
meter to verify that the broken wire was

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.910 
meter to verify that the broken wire was
actually<00:00:33.760> the<00:00:33.850> common<00:00:34.180> wire<00:00:34.470> so<00:00:35.470> to<00:00:35.530> use<00:00:35.770> the

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:35.920 
actually the common wire so to use the

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.779 
actually the common wire so to use the
pulsar<00:00:36.310> I'll<00:00:36.579> take<00:00:37.090> the<00:00:37.239> red<00:00:37.390> lead<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:39.250> I'll

00:00:39.779 --> 00:00:39.789 
pulsar I'll take the red lead and I'll

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:43.110 
pulsar I'll take the red lead and I'll
hook<00:00:39.910> it<00:00:40.030> up<00:00:40.120> to<00:00:40.239> the<00:00:40.359> common<00:00:40.660> wire<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.879> black

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:43.120 
hook it up to the common wire the black

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:53.310 
hook it up to the common wire the black
lead<00:00:43.359> will<00:00:43.539> go<00:00:43.629> to<00:00:43.690> ground<00:00:51.960> I'm<00:00:52.960> going<00:00:53.109> to<00:00:53.170> turn

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:53.320 
lead will go to ground I'm going to turn

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.279 
lead will go to ground I'm going to turn
the<00:00:53.410> unit<00:00:53.620> on<00:00:53.910> it'll<00:00:54.910> send<00:00:55.059> 2,400<00:00:55.870> volts<00:00:56.109> DC

00:00:56.279 --> 00:00:56.289 
the unit on it'll send 2,400 volts DC

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:59.069 
the unit on it'll send 2,400 volts DC
through<00:00:57.070> the<00:00:57.190> wire<00:00:57.370> I'll<00:00:57.879> use<00:00:58.300> the<00:00:58.449> receiver

00:00:59.069 --> 00:00:59.079 
through the wire I'll use the receiver

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:05.570 
through the wire I'll use the receiver
to<00:00:59.980> pinpoint<00:01:00.249> the<00:01:00.609> location<00:01:00.640> of<00:01:01.359> the<00:01:01.719> break

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.399 

the<00:01:06.580> receiver<00:01:06.940> goes<00:01:07.210> parallel<00:01:07.960> with<00:01:08.140> the<00:01:08.260> wire

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:08.409 
the receiver goes parallel with the wire

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:10.710 
the receiver goes parallel with the wire
path<00:01:08.710> and<00:01:09.040> when<00:01:09.909> you<00:01:10.000> turn<00:01:10.150> it<00:01:10.300> on<00:01:10.360> there's<00:01:10.600> an

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:10.720 
path and when you turn it on there's an

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.600 
path and when you turn it on there's an
analog<00:01:11.050> meter<00:01:11.290> that<00:01:11.560> you'll<00:01:11.710> watch<00:01:11.890> when<00:01:12.520> the

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
analog meter that you'll watch when the

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.400 
analog meter that you'll watch when the
needle<00:01:12.880> bounces<00:01:13.240> to<00:01:13.360> the<00:01:13.390> right<00:01:13.660> that's<00:01:14.260> the

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:14.410 
needle bounces to the right that's the

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:16.380 
needle bounces to the right that's the
direction<00:01:14.770> of<00:01:15.010> the<00:01:15.130> fault<00:01:15.370> if<00:01:15.760> it<00:01:15.880> bounces<00:01:16.240> to

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
direction of the fault if it bounces to

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.510 
direction of the fault if it bounces to
the<00:01:16.480> left<00:01:16.660> is<00:01:16.810> to<00:01:16.960> the<00:01:17.080> left<00:01:17.260> right<00:01:18.040> now<00:01:18.220> it's

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
the left is to the left right now it's

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.430 
the left is to the left right now it's
showing<00:01:18.610> that<00:01:18.940> the<00:01:19.090> fault<00:01:19.420> is<00:01:19.630> over<00:01:20.320> there

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:20.440 
showing that the fault is over there

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.110 
showing that the fault is over there
somewhere<00:01:20.740> so<00:01:21.250> we're<00:01:21.400> going<00:01:21.520> to<00:01:21.580> go<00:01:21.730> get<00:01:22.060> a

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:22.120 
somewhere so we're going to go get a

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:28.170 
somewhere so we're going to go get a
closer<00:01:22.360> look<00:01:22.540> now<00:01:26.610> all<00:01:27.610> we<00:01:27.730> have<00:01:27.850> to<00:01:27.880> do<00:01:28.060> is

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.180 
closer look now all we have to do is

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:29.730 
closer look now all we have to do is
follow<00:01:28.420> the<00:01:28.600> needle<00:01:28.930> on<00:01:29.020> the<00:01:29.080> analog<00:01:29.440> meter

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
follow the needle on the analog meter

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.530 
follow the needle on the analog meter
right<00:01:30.400> now<00:01:30.520> it's<00:01:30.670> telling<00:01:30.910> us<00:01:30.940> that<00:01:31.030> the<00:01:31.210> vault

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:31.540 
right now it's telling us that the vault

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.750 
right now it's telling us that the vault
is<00:01:31.750> this<00:01:32.230> direction<00:01:32.710> so<00:01:33.130> I'll<00:01:33.250> pick<00:01:33.460> it<00:01:33.490> up<00:01:33.640> and

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:33.760 
is this direction so I'll pick it up and

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:40.260 
is this direction so I'll pick it up and
move<00:01:33.910> it<00:01:38.040> and<00:01:39.040> it's<00:01:39.460> bouncing<00:01:39.820> back<00:01:40.000> to<00:01:40.150> the

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
move it and it's bouncing back to the

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.900 
move it and it's bouncing back to the
right<00:01:40.450> so<00:01:40.990> I'm<00:01:41.080> going<00:01:41.230> to<00:01:41.260> flag<00:01:41.790> from<00:01:42.790> the

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:42.910 
right so I'm going to flag from the

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:46.170 
right so I'm going to flag from the
center<00:01:43.180> point<00:01:43.360> of<00:01:43.540> the<00:01:43.630> receiver<00:01:45.060> move<00:01:46.060> it

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
center point of the receiver move it

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.370 
center point of the receiver move it
back<00:01:46.330> again

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.380 

it's<00:01:50.380> bouncing<00:01:50.770> this<00:01:50.890> direction<00:01:51.430> now<00:01:51.580> so<00:01:52.360> I

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
it's bouncing this direction now so I

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.360 
it's bouncing this direction now so I
know<00:01:52.510> that<00:01:52.660> the<00:01:52.900> break<00:01:53.140> is<00:01:53.710> in<00:01:53.920> between<00:01:54.040> these

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:54.370 
know that the break is in between these

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:56.550 
know that the break is in between these
two<00:01:54.580> flags<00:01:54.910> now<00:01:55.780> I'm<00:01:55.930> going<00:01:56.110> to<00:01:56.170> pivot<00:01:56.350> the

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
two flags now I'm going to pivot the

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.600 
two flags now I'm going to pivot the
receiver<00:01:57.390> and<00:01:59.100> figure<00:02:00.100> out<00:02:00.190> where<00:02:00.340> the<00:02:00.430> break

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
receiver and figure out where the break

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:06.960 
receiver and figure out where the break
is<00:02:00.820> this<00:02:01.600> direction<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:06.640> needle<00:02:06.880> is<00:02:06.940> moving

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
is this direction the needle is moving

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:14.990 
is this direction the needle is moving
to<00:02:07.270> the<00:02:07.330> left<00:02:07.570> so<00:02:07.750> I'm<00:02:07.810> going<00:02:07.870> to<00:02:08.020> pivot<00:02:08.170> around

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.430 

okay<00:02:16.000> so<00:02:16.060> now<00:02:16.270> I<00:02:16.300> know<00:02:16.450> that<00:02:16.780> the<00:02:16.960> vault<00:02:17.230> is

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
okay so now I know that the vault is

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.980 
okay so now I know that the vault is
somewhere<00:02:17.770> within<00:02:17.950> this<00:02:18.130> grouping<00:02:18.550> of<00:02:18.640> flags

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
somewhere within this grouping of flags
