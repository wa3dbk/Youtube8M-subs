00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
rotate that this way a little bit so I

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.310 
rotate that this way a little bit so I
can<00:00:51.420> do<00:00:51.629> this<00:00:51.750> easier<00:00:52.699> there's<00:00:53.699> two<00:00:53.910> pieces

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.320 
can do this easier there's two pieces

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.860 
can do this easier there's two pieces
and<00:00:55.320> then<00:00:55.530> there's<00:00:55.710> two<00:00:55.949> screws<00:00:56.539> the<00:00:57.539> screws

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
kind of worrying me because they don't

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.510 
kind of worrying me because they don't
feel<00:01:00.300> like<00:01:00.480> they<00:01:00.600> come<00:01:00.870> out<00:01:00.899> you<00:01:01.410> know<00:01:02.219> I<00:01:02.250> just

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
don't want to lose them and there's a

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.179 
don't want to lose them and there's a
little<00:01:06.659> area<00:01:07.020> that<00:01:07.049> goes<00:01:07.320> under<00:01:07.740> here<00:01:08.010> for

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
little area that goes under here for

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.940 
little area that goes under here for
your<00:01:08.549> hands<00:01:08.760> to<00:01:09.030> touch<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.330> screen<00:01:09.799> so<00:01:10.799> let's

your hands to touch the screen so let's

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.289 
your hands to touch the screen so let's
see<00:01:11.010> how<00:01:11.070> fast<00:01:11.340> I<00:01:11.520> can<00:01:11.670> do<00:01:11.790> this<00:01:11.939> because<00:01:12.180> this

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
see how fast I can do this because this

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.580 
see how fast I can do this because this
is<00:01:12.360> one<00:01:12.570> of<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.750> things<00:01:12.960> I'm<00:01:13.140> worried<00:01:13.530> about

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.580 

kind<00:01:37.720> of<00:01:37.750> worried<00:01:37.990> about<00:01:38.110> the<00:01:38.290> screws

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
kind of worried about the screws

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.300 
kind of worried about the screws
scratching<00:01:39.190> the<00:01:39.280> screen<00:01:39.550> a<00:01:39.580> little<00:01:39.850> bit

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
scratching the screen a little bit

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.830 
scratching the screen a little bit
hopefully<00:01:42.310> my<00:01:42.760> mic<00:01:43.000> is<00:01:43.300> it's<00:01:43.900> kind<00:01:44.140> of<00:01:44.170> windy

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
hopefully my mic is it's kind of windy

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:56.730 
hopefully my mic is it's kind of windy
so<00:01:46.840> hopefully<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:49.750> winds<00:01:49.960> to<00:01:50.140> my<00:01:50.260> back

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.889 

lining<00:01:57.579> up<00:01:57.670> the<00:01:57.820> screws<00:01:58.150> is<00:01:58.329> hard<00:01:58.570> because<00:01:58.720> you

00:01:58.889 --> 00:01:58.899 
lining up the screws is hard because you

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:06.859 
lining up the screws is hard because you
can't<00:01:59.170> see<00:01:59.820> but<00:02:00.820> there's<00:02:01.060> the<00:02:01.270> first<00:02:01.450> one<00:02:02.130> and

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.729 

is<00:02:07.869> the<00:02:08.110> second<00:02:08.470> one<00:02:09.720> and<00:02:10.720> when<00:02:10.840> they're<00:02:11.020> in<00:02:11.050> it

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:11.739 
is the second one and when they're in it

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:14.759 
is the second one and when they're in it
definitely<00:02:12.099> feels<00:02:12.220> like<00:02:12.370> their<00:02:12.610> end<00:02:13.769> so

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
definitely feels like their end so

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:18.390 
definitely feels like their end so
that's<00:02:14.920> the<00:02:15.160> first<00:02:15.370> part<00:02:16.980> as<00:02:17.980> you<00:02:18.099> can<00:02:18.220> see

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
that's the first part as you can see

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.949 
that's the first part as you can see
here<00:02:19.140> the<00:02:20.140> second<00:02:20.500> part<00:02:20.739> is<00:02:21.370> magnetic<00:02:22.000> what<00:02:22.900> I

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
here the second part is magnetic what I

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.410 
here the second part is magnetic what I
like<00:02:23.140> to<00:02:23.230> do<00:02:23.380> is<00:02:23.620> kind<00:02:24.580> of<00:02:24.670> crease<00:02:24.910> these<00:02:25.090> over

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
like to do is kind of crease these over

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.410 
like to do is kind of crease these over
first<00:02:25.720> because<00:02:26.590> they<00:02:26.680> have<00:02:26.769> magnets<00:02:27.190> in<00:02:27.250> them

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
first because they have magnets in them

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.000 
first because they have magnets in them
because<00:02:28.420> if<00:02:28.540> you<00:02:28.660> don't<00:02:28.900> it<00:02:29.530> kind<00:02:29.739> of<00:02:29.769> flops

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
because if you don't it kind of flops

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.280 
because if you don't it kind of flops
off<00:02:30.480> and<00:02:31.480> I<00:02:31.540> don't<00:02:31.630> think<00:02:31.750> it<00:02:31.930> really<00:02:32.019> matters

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
off and I don't think it really matters

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.979 
off and I don't think it really matters
which<00:02:32.620> direction<00:02:32.920> you<00:02:33.100> put<00:02:33.250> it<00:02:33.340> on<00:02:33.660> and<00:02:34.660> you

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
which direction you put it on and you

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:39.630 
which direction you put it on and you
can<00:02:35.140> see<00:02:35.380> or<00:02:36.160> even<00:02:36.310> hear<00:02:37.230> the<00:02:38.230> magnetic<00:02:38.769> but

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
can see or even hear the magnetic but

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.539 
can see or even hear the magnetic but
you<00:02:39.730> can<00:02:39.850> see<00:02:40.000> right<00:02:40.180> here<00:02:40.950> it<00:02:41.950> sometimes

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:42.549 
you can see right here it sometimes

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:43.949 
you can see right here it sometimes
works<00:02:42.850> and<00:02:43.060> sometimes<00:02:43.239> doesn't<00:02:43.660> that's<00:02:43.840> why<00:02:43.930> I

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
works and sometimes doesn't that's why I

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.920 
works and sometimes doesn't that's why I
have<00:02:44.080> to<00:02:44.170> kind<00:02:44.319> of<00:02:44.380> crease<00:02:44.590> it<00:02:44.799> now<00:02:45.930> you

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
have to kind of crease it now you

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.990 
have to kind of crease it now you
actually<00:02:47.110> mount<00:02:47.530> it<00:02:47.680> to<00:02:47.739> this<00:02:48.370> screw<00:02:48.970> right

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
actually mount it to this screw right

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.770 
actually mount it to this screw right
here<00:02:49.830> so<00:02:50.830> let's<00:02:51.280> loosen<00:02:51.970> this<00:02:52.299> up<00:02:53.400> and<00:02:54.720> see<00:02:55.720> if

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
here so let's loosen this up and see if

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:02.650 
here so let's loosen this up and see if
we<00:02:55.840> can<00:02:55.959> rotate<00:02:56.140> this<00:02:56.470> in

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:08.650 

and<00:03:03.050> I<00:03:05.230> really<00:03:06.230> didn't<00:03:06.500> bring<00:03:07.420> yeah<00:03:08.420> I<00:03:08.450> could

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
and I really didn't bring yeah I could

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.190 
and I really didn't bring yeah I could
do<00:03:08.780> this<00:03:08.930> yeah<00:03:09.170> I'm<00:03:09.230> like<00:03:09.470> right<00:03:09.710> there<00:03:09.950> I

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
do this yeah I'm like right there I

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.440 
do this yeah I'm like right there I
should<00:03:12.200> have<00:03:12.440> brought<00:03:12.650> was<00:03:12.950> my<00:03:13.190> other<00:03:13.310> arm<00:03:13.610> so

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
should have brought was my other arm so

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:15.490 
should have brought was my other arm so
I<00:03:14.480> could<00:03:14.630> extend<00:03:14.840> it<00:03:15.080> out<00:03:15.230> a<00:03:15.260> little<00:03:15.380> bit

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
I could extend it out a little bit

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.160 
I could extend it out a little bit
further<00:03:15.800> because<00:03:16.070> right<00:03:16.340> here<00:03:16.370> it's<00:03:17.110> kind<00:03:18.110> of

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
further because right here it's kind of

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.660 
further because right here it's kind of
tough<00:03:18.410> but<00:03:19.370> now<00:03:19.840> let's<00:03:20.840> go<00:03:20.960> ahead<00:03:21.080> and<00:03:21.670> mount

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
tough but now let's go ahead and mount

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.160 
tough but now let's go ahead and mount
this<00:03:23.030> and<00:03:23.330> you<00:03:23.390> can<00:03:23.540> see<00:03:23.690> it<00:03:23.750> goes<00:03:23.870> right<00:03:24.050> in

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
this and you can see it goes right in

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.650 
this and you can see it goes right in
the<00:03:24.290> side<00:03:24.500> pretty<00:03:24.770> easily

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
the side pretty easily

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.210 
the side pretty easily
cameras<00:03:27.350> already<00:03:27.530> on<00:03:27.650> again<00:03:27.950> it's<00:03:28.070> really

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
cameras already on again it's really

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.210 
cameras already on again it's really
hard<00:03:28.490> to<00:03:28.610> see<00:03:28.730> the<00:03:28.850> screen<00:03:28.940> let's<00:03:29.390> turn<00:03:29.600> on<00:03:29.780> the

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
hard to see the screen let's turn on the

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.790 
hard to see the screen let's turn on the
Shogun<00:03:31.780> you<00:03:32.780> have<00:03:32.900> to<00:03:32.990> wait<00:03:33.140> a<00:03:33.170> few<00:03:33.380> seconds

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:33.800 
Shogun you have to wait a few seconds

and cons well anyway let me change the

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:48.040 
and cons well anyway let me change the
framing<00:04:44.600> on<00:04:44.720> here<00:04:44.900> just<00:04:45.050> to<00:04:45.170> make<00:04:45.380> sure<00:04:46.990> no<00:04:47.990> I

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
framing on here just to make sure no I

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.989 
framing on here just to make sure no I
don't<00:04:48.410> like<00:04:48.590> it<00:04:48.620> over<00:04:48.980> there

00:04:50.989 --> 00:04:50.999 
don't like it over there

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:53.029 
don't like it over there
and<00:04:51.360> over<00:04:51.689> here<00:04:51.899> it<00:04:51.989> looks<00:04:52.019> pretty<00:04:52.439> good<00:04:53.009> I

00:04:53.029 --> 00:04:53.039 
and over here it looks pretty good I

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:57.109 
and over here it looks pretty good I
think<00:04:53.429> include<00:04:53.909> those<00:04:54.089> trees<00:04:55.459> and<00:04:56.459> then<00:04:56.729> in

00:04:57.109 --> 00:04:57.119 
think include those trees and then in

00:04:57.119 --> 00:04:59.869 
think include those trees and then in
terms<00:04:57.360> of<00:04:57.860> yeah<00:04:58.860> like<00:04:59.099> having<00:04:59.459> those<00:04:59.610> rocks

00:04:59.869 --> 00:04:59.879 
terms of yeah like having those rocks

00:04:59.879 --> 00:05:04.939 
terms of yeah like having those rocks
there<00:05:01.489> and<00:05:02.489> you<00:05:02.729> can<00:05:02.909> tell<00:05:03.119> the<00:05:03.299> Sun<00:05:03.709> is<00:05:04.709> kind

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:04.949

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:07.279 
there and you can tell the Sun is kind
of<00:05:05.009> going<00:05:05.279> in<00:05:05.429> and<00:05:05.549> out<00:05:05.699> there's<00:05:06.539> a<00:05:06.659> few<00:05:07.049> little

working on my a7 s course as well and

00:05:26.279 --> 00:05:27.829 
working on my a7 s course as well and
you<00:05:26.369> can<00:05:26.459> always<00:05:26.579> recover<00:05:26.969> those<00:05:27.269> super

00:05:27.829 --> 00:05:27.839 
you can always recover those super

00:05:27.839 --> 00:05:30.469 
you can always recover those super
whites<00:05:28.459> to<00:05:29.459> bring<00:05:29.669> those<00:05:29.819> down<00:05:30.029> and<00:05:30.149> recover

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:30.479 
whites to bring those down and recover

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:32.629 
whites to bring those down and recover
some<00:05:30.719> of<00:05:30.749> those<00:05:30.869> highlights<00:05:31.229> so<00:05:31.979> sometimes<00:05:32.399> I

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:32.639 
some of those highlights so sometimes I

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:36.079 
some of those highlights so sometimes I
don't<00:05:32.699> actually<00:05:33.029> go<00:05:33.239> by<00:05:33.599> the<00:05:34.909> Zebras<00:05:35.909> I

00:05:36.079 --> 00:05:36.089 
don't actually go by the Zebras I

00:05:36.089 --> 00:05:37.909 
don't actually go by the Zebras I
actually<00:05:36.299> come<00:05:36.659> more<00:05:36.869> by<00:05:37.019> the<00:05:37.079> histogram<00:05:37.649> on

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:37.919 
actually come more by the histogram on

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:40.249 
actually come more by the histogram on
here<00:05:38.399> because<00:05:38.579> it's<00:05:39.029> actually<00:05:39.360> more<00:05:39.749> accurate

00:05:40.249 --> 00:05:40.259 
here because it's actually more accurate

00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:42.679 
here because it's actually more accurate
because<00:05:40.439> you<00:05:40.679> actually<00:05:40.979> see<00:05:41.159> where<00:05:41.459> it<00:05:42.089> starts

00:05:42.679 --> 00:05:42.689 
because you actually see where it starts

00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:44.659 
because you actually see where it starts
you<00:05:42.809> start<00:05:43.019> clipping<00:05:43.259> the<00:05:43.499> whites<00:05:43.709> so

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:44.669 
you start clipping the whites so

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:47.619 
you start clipping the whites so
sometimes<00:05:45.059> I'll<00:05:45.239> record<00:05:45.719> a<00:05:45.839> few<00:05:46.019> seconds<00:05:46.469> of

00:05:47.619 --> 00:05:47.629 
sometimes I'll record a few seconds of

00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:51.199 
sometimes I'll record a few seconds of
footage<00:05:49.459> where<00:05:50.459> I<00:05:50.519> know<00:05:50.579> it's<00:05:50.699> properly

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:51.209 
footage where I know it's properly

00:05:51.209 --> 00:05:52.819 
footage where I know it's properly
exposed<00:05:51.509> but<00:05:51.779> then<00:05:51.929> sometimes<00:05:52.229> I'll<00:05:52.499> bump<00:05:52.679> it

00:05:52.819 --> 00:05:52.829 
exposed but then sometimes I'll bump it

00:05:52.829 --> 00:05:55.519 
exposed but then sometimes I'll bump it
up<00:05:52.919> a<00:05:53.509> third<00:05:54.509> or<00:05:54.719> two<00:05:54.839> thirds<00:05:55.019> of<00:05:55.169> a<00:05:55.289> stop

00:05:55.519 --> 00:05:55.529 
up a third or two thirds of a stop

00:05:55.529 --> 00:05:57.199 
up a third or two thirds of a stop
because<00:05:56.099> I<00:05:56.309> know<00:05:56.369> I'll<00:05:56.579> be<00:05:56.610> able<00:05:56.759> to<00:05:56.909> recover

00:05:57.199 --> 00:05:57.209 
because I know I'll be able to recover

00:05:57.209 --> 00:05:59.719 
because I know I'll be able to recover
it<00:05:57.529> that's<00:05:58.529> pretty<00:05:58.800> much<00:05:58.919> all<00:05:59.099> I<00:05:59.159> need<00:05:59.369> just<00:05:59.579> a

00:05:59.719 --> 00:05:59.729 
it that's pretty much all I need just a

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:01.309 
it that's pretty much all I need just a
few<00:05:59.759> seconds<00:06:00.269> of<00:06:00.360> this<00:06:00.449> for<00:06:00.689> my<00:06:00.779> opening<00:06:01.079> shot

00:06:01.309 --> 00:06:01.319 
few seconds of this for my opening shot

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:05.089 
few seconds of this for my opening shot
and<00:06:02.119> it's<00:06:03.119> pretty<00:06:03.329> much<00:06:03.479> it<00:06:03.629> for<00:06:03.719> review<00:06:04.099> it's

00:06:05.089 --> 00:06:05.099 
and it's pretty much it for review it's

00:06:05.099 --> 00:06:09.169 
and it's pretty much it for review it's
kind<00:06:05.369> of<00:06:05.459> expensive<00:06:05.999> it's<00:06:06.269> a<00:06:06.360> like<00:06:07.099> $79<00:06:08.179> we

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:09.179 
kind of expensive it's a like $79 we

00:06:09.179 --> 00:06:12.169 
kind of expensive it's a like $79 we
shows<00:06:09.389> like<00:06:09.739> $39<00:06:10.739> and<00:06:11.249> I'm<00:06:11.489> not<00:06:11.639> a<00:06:11.669> big<00:06:11.909> fan<00:06:12.119> of

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:12.179 
shows like $39 and I'm not a big fan of

00:06:12.179 --> 00:06:14.269 
shows like $39 and I'm not a big fan of
having<00:06:12.419> all<00:06:12.749> the<00:06:12.989> their<00:06:13.409> logo<00:06:13.769> all<00:06:13.949> over<00:06:13.979> it

having all the their logo all over it

00:06:14.279 --> 00:06:16.909 
having all the their logo all over it
since<00:06:14.429> it's<00:06:14.669> such<00:06:14.819> a<00:06:14.849> big<00:06:15.119> area<00:06:15.569> I<00:06:15.959> rather<00:06:16.589> be

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:16.919 
since it's such a big area I rather be

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:18.679 
since it's such a big area I rather be
all<00:06:17.039> black<00:06:17.309> and<00:06:17.579> they<00:06:17.699> had<00:06:17.849> a<00:06:17.879> very<00:06:18.089> small<00:06:18.239> logo
