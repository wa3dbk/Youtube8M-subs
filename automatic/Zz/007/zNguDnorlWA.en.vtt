only downside had police say to him

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.920 
only downside had police say to him
really<00:01:43.890> apart<00:01:44.759> from<00:01:44.880> anything<00:01:45.299> else<00:01:45.509> it<00:01:45.899> just

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
really apart from anything else it just

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.870 
really apart from anything else it just
he<00:01:46.110> gets<00:01:46.320> up<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.619> pitch<00:01:46.829> way<00:01:47.159> too<00:01:47.220> much<00:01:47.610> he's

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
he gets up the pitch way too much he's

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.310 
he gets up the pitch way too much he's
always<00:01:48.240> playing<00:01:48.390> that<00:01:48.570> left<00:01:48.840> wing<00:01:49.079> role

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
always playing that left wing role

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.780 
always playing that left wing role
rather<00:01:49.530> than<00:01:49.710> a<00:01:49.829> left-back<00:01:50.280> role<00:01:50.549> which<00:01:50.700> I

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
rather than a left-back role which I

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.249 
rather than a left-back role which I
don't<00:01:51.030> like<00:01:51.270> maybe<00:01:51.600> if<00:01:51.780> you<00:01:51.869> use<00:01:52.020> him<00:01:52.140> as<00:01:52.229> a

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
don't like maybe if you use him as a

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.380 
don't like maybe if you use him as a
left<00:01:52.500> wing<00:01:52.740> back<00:01:52.950> he'd<00:01:53.460> be<00:01:53.610> phenomenal<00:01:54.210> and<00:01:54.299> I

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
left wing back he'd be phenomenal and I

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.690 
left wing back he'd be phenomenal and I
might<00:01:54.570> be<00:01:54.600> trying<00:01:54.930> that<00:01:55.170> later<00:01:55.530> on<00:01:55.680> but<00:01:56.430> to<00:01:56.670> be

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
might be trying that later on but to be

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.490 
might be trying that later on but to be
honest<00:01:57.060> in<00:01:57.270> that<00:01:57.540> left<00:01:57.719> back<00:01:57.899> role<00:01:58.140> he's<00:01:58.320> just

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
honest in that left back role he's just

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.050 
honest in that left back role he's just
too<00:01:58.680> far<00:01:58.860> at<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.100> pitch<00:01:59.280> he<00:01:59.430> does<00:01:59.579> leave<00:01:59.729> a<00:01:59.759> big

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
too far at the pitch he does leave a big

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.580 
too far at the pitch he does leave a big
gap<00:02:00.420> in<00:02:00.630> that<00:02:00.689> left<00:02:00.960> back<00:02:01.170> role<00:02:01.350> that's<00:02:01.469> the

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
gap in that left back role that's the

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.380 
gap in that left back role that's the
only<00:02:01.979> reason<00:02:02.159> I<00:02:02.399> dislike<00:02:02.790> him<00:02:03.000> apart<00:02:03.270> from

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
only reason I dislike him apart from

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.209 
only reason I dislike him apart from
that<00:02:03.479> he's<00:02:03.840> a<00:02:03.869> really<00:02:04.469> quality<00:02:04.829> all<00:02:05.159> around

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
that he's a really quality all around

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.459

left<00:02:05.939> back<00:02:06.119> he<00:02:06.210> can<00:02:06.329> score<00:02:06.600> goals<00:02:06.659> get<00:02:07.079> assists

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
left back he can score goals get assists

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.979 
left back he can score goals get assists
and<00:02:07.649> tackle<00:02:08.190> people<00:02:08.520> very<00:02:08.819> very<00:02:08.879> well<00:02:09.360> and<00:02:09.569> his
