00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.000 
have both characters on screen we might
as<00:03:00.359> well<00:03:00.389> moment<00:03:00.989> but<00:03:01.379> when<00:03:01.530> you<00:03:01.650> base<00:03:01.859> an

means<00:04:29.610> I<00:04:29.730> think<00:04:29.820> it's<00:04:30.090> gonna<00:04:30.240> work<00:04:30.480> well<00:04:30.720> and

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 
means I think it's gonna work well and

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.690 
means I think it's gonna work well and
let's<00:04:31.320> not<00:04:31.470> forget<00:04:31.530> Man<00:04:32.010> of<00:04:32.130> Steel's<00:04:32.370> trailer

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:32.700 
let's not forget Man of Steel's trailer

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.760 
let's not forget Man of Steel's trailer
also<00:04:33.090> promised<00:04:33.390> Big<00:04:33.570> Ideas<00:04:33.930> at<00:04:34.020> the<00:04:34.110> time<00:04:34.320> but

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
also promised Big Ideas at the time but

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.020 
also promised Big Ideas at the time but
you<00:04:34.860> know<00:04:34.980> what<00:04:35.190> when<00:04:35.460> all<00:04:35.580> is<00:04:35.700> said<00:04:35.850> and<00:04:35.880> done

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
you know what when all is said and done

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.090 
you know what when all is said and done
I<00:04:36.360> actually<00:04:36.840> think<00:04:37.260> they<00:04:37.500> may<00:04:37.650> have<00:04:37.680> a<00:04:37.860> fair

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
I actually think they may have a fair

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.600 
I actually think they may have a fair
shot<00:04:38.280> of<00:04:38.430> pulling<00:04:38.670> through<00:04:38.820> with<00:04:38.970> this<00:04:39.060> one<00:04:39.300> I

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
shot of pulling through with this one I

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.740 
shot of pulling through with this one I
really<00:04:41.610> like<00:04:42.240> the<00:04:42.390> premise<00:04:42.600> behind

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
really like the premise behind

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.840 
really like the premise behind
Terminator<00:04:43.470> 5<00:04:43.770> back<00:04:44.310> when<00:04:44.520> the<00:04:44.640> teaser

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:44.850 
Terminator 5 back when the teaser

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:46.850 
Terminator 5 back when the teaser
trailer<00:04:45.000> was<00:04:45.300> the<00:04:45.600> only<00:04:45.870> trailer<00:04:46.290> I<00:04:46.530> liked

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
trailer was the only trailer I liked

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:47.780 
trailer was the only trailer I liked
that<00:04:46.950> they<00:04:47.160> were<00:04:47.250> going<00:04:47.430> in<00:04:47.580> the<00:04:47.670> new

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:47.790 
that they were going in the new

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:49.520 
that they were going in the new
direction<00:04:48.120> whilst<00:04:48.480> also<00:04:48.690> following<00:04:49.230> the<00:04:49.320> same

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
direction whilst also following the same

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.080 
direction whilst also following the same
traditional<00:04:50.040> cat-and-mouse<00:04:50.460> chase<00:04:50.700> plus

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090 
traditional cat-and-mouse chase plus

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:52.280 
traditional cat-and-mouse chase plus
outline<00:04:51.510> I<00:04:51.660> liked<00:04:51.930> that<00:04:52.110> they<00:04:52.230> were

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:52.290 
outline I liked that they were

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:54.140 
outline I liked that they were
subverting<00:04:52.860> expectations<00:04:53.160> and<00:04:53.730> seeming<00:04:54.060> like

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
subverting expectations and seeming like

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:55.580 
subverting expectations and seeming like
a<00:04:54.210> lame<00:04:54.420> rehash<00:04:54.840> to<00:04:55.050> reveal<00:04:55.290> that<00:04:55.470> they're

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
a lame rehash to reveal that they're

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.020 
a lame rehash to reveal that they're
going<00:04:55.680> to<00:04:55.740> be<00:04:55.860> altering<00:04:56.220> the<00:04:56.370> timeline<00:04:56.580> I

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
going to be altering the timeline I

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.300 
going to be altering the timeline I
liked<00:04:57.480> that<00:04:57.570> the<00:04:57.780> Oder<00:04:57.960> t800<00:04:58.740> was<00:04:58.890> gonna<00:04:59.040> fight

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
liked that the Oder t800 was gonna fight

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.520 
liked that the Oder t800 was gonna fight
the<00:04:59.430> younger<00:04:59.760> version<00:05:00.120> from<00:05:00.270> 1984<00:05:00.990> again

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.530 
the younger version from 1984 again

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:02.930 
the younger version from 1984 again
because<00:05:01.860> it<00:05:01.980> looks<00:05:02.100> like<00:05:02.250> a<00:05:02.280> fun<00:05:02.520> little<00:05:02.640> bit

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 
because it looks like a fun little bit

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:04.880 
because it looks like a fun little bit
and<00:05:03.180> nothing<00:05:03.510> more<00:05:03.750> and<00:05:03.930> hey<00:05:04.320> they<00:05:04.500> got<00:05:04.650> Arnold

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:04.890 
and nothing more and hey they got Arnold

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:08.000 
and nothing more and hey they got Arnold
back<00:05:05.130> I<00:05:05.340> liked<00:05:05.790> all<00:05:06.000> that<00:05:06.360> stuff<00:05:06.720> the<00:05:07.650> second

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.010 
back I liked all that stuff the second

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:10.580 
back I liked all that stuff the second
trailer<00:05:08.160> on<00:05:08.370> the<00:05:08.460> other<00:05:08.580> hand<00:05:09.440> there's<00:05:10.440> some

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.590 
trailer on the other hand there's some

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:12.170 
trailer on the other hand there's some
weird<00:05:10.890> thing<00:05:11.190> about<00:05:11.430> the<00:05:11.550> Terminator<00:05:12.000> they're

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 
weird thing about the Terminator they're

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:13.910 
weird thing about the Terminator they're
trying<00:05:12.420> to<00:05:12.510> survive<00:05:12.840> actually<00:05:13.170> being<00:05:13.680> John

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:13.920 
trying to survive actually being John

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.070 
trying to survive actually being John
Connor<00:05:14.190> or<00:05:14.580> some<00:05:15.210> amalgamation<00:05:15.870> of<00:05:15.930> the

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
Connor or some amalgamation of the

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.560 
with John Connors face I'm not really
sure<00:05:20.400> what<00:05:20.520> it's<00:05:20.610> meant<00:05:20.760> to<00:05:20.850> be<00:05:20.940> if<00:05:21.360> we're

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:21.570 
sure what it's meant to be if we're

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:22.970 
sure what it's meant to be if we're
legitimately<00:05:22.110> supposed<00:05:22.440> to<00:05:22.530> think<00:05:22.740> it's<00:05:22.860> the

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:22.980 
legitimately supposed to think it's the

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:24.650 
legitimately supposed to think it's the
real<00:05:23.130> dude<00:05:23.340> himself<00:05:23.790> or<00:05:24.060> if<00:05:24.180> that<00:05:24.330> twist

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:24.660 
real dude himself or if that twist

real dude himself or if that twist
moment<00:05:25.020> shown<00:05:25.230> is<00:05:25.410> just<00:05:25.590> a<00:05:25.650> crappy<00:05:25.980> fake<00:05:26.220> house

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:26.430 
moment shown is just a crappy fake house

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:28.280 
moment shown is just a crappy fake house
sequence<00:05:26.820> lasting<00:05:27.210> 10<00:05:27.390> seconds<00:05:27.870> in<00:05:27.990> the<00:05:28.050> film

sequence lasting 10 seconds in the film
itself<00:05:28.590> I<00:05:28.860> can't<00:05:29.190> quite<00:05:29.340> say<00:05:29.580> this<00:05:29.730> makes<00:05:29.910> it

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:30.090 
itself I can't quite say this makes it

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:31.640 
itself I can't quite say this makes it
look<00:05:30.120> bad<00:05:30.570> just<00:05:31.050> that<00:05:31.080> it<00:05:31.230> makes<00:05:31.380> it<00:05:31.530> look

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:31.650 
look bad just that it makes it look

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:33.200 
look bad just that it makes it look
worryingly<00:05:32.100> complicated<00:05:32.790> for<00:05:32.940> the<00:05:33.030> sake<00:05:33.180> of

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:33.210 
worryingly complicated for the sake of

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.750 
worryingly complicated for the sake of
complication<00:05:33.960> or<00:05:34.169> who<00:05:34.980> knows<00:05:35.190> maybe<00:05:35.220> they're

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:35.760 
complication or who knows maybe they're

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.280 
complication or who knows maybe they're
just<00:05:35.790> trying<00:05:36.120> to<00:05:36.150> pull<00:05:36.330> a<00:05:36.360> Total<00:05:36.720> Recall<00:05:36.840> on<00:05:37.169> us

just trying to pull a Total Recall on us

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:38.900 
just trying to pull a Total Recall on us
and<00:05:37.470> the<00:05:37.530> intent<00:05:37.860> really<00:05:38.130> is<00:05:38.370> to<00:05:38.550> just<00:05:38.730> have

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:38.910 
and the intent really is to just have

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:40.220 
and the intent really is to just have
everyone<00:05:39.180> mess<00:05:39.450> about<00:05:39.570> with<00:05:39.720> the<00:05:39.870> timeline

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:40.230 
everyone mess about with the timeline

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:41.480 
everyone mess about with the timeline
till<00:05:40.440> there's<00:05:40.590> some<00:05:40.710> kind<00:05:40.890> of<00:05:40.919> breaking<00:05:41.250> point

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:41.490 
till there's some kind of breaking point

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:43.070 
till there's some kind of breaking point
I<00:05:41.669> will<00:05:42.000> say<00:05:42.030> that<00:05:42.360> I<00:05:42.419> like<00:05:42.600> how<00:05:42.750> all<00:05:42.900> these

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 
I will say that I like how all these

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.510 
I will say that I like how all these
clips<00:05:43.380> seem<00:05:43.590> to<00:05:43.740> suggest<00:05:43.890> we're<00:05:44.190> gonna<00:05:44.310> see

awful

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:24.250 
awful

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:25.890 
awful
not<00:07:24.460> so<00:07:24.580> much<00:07:24.670> down<00:07:24.880> to<00:07:25.000> the<00:07:25.090> effect<00:07:25.420> like<00:07:25.780> the

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:25.900 
not so much down to the effect like the

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:27.060 
not so much down to the effect like the
Jurassic<00:07:26.260> world<00:07:26.440> trailer<00:07:26.740> looking

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:27.070 
Jurassic world trailer looking

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:29.010 
Jurassic world trailer looking
unfinished<00:07:27.520> but<00:07:28.120> more<00:07:28.300> simply<00:07:28.660> that<00:07:28.810> it<00:07:28.870> looks

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:29.020 
unfinished but more simply that it looks

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:30.570 
unfinished but more simply that it looks
nothing<00:07:29.320> like<00:07:29.470> Jamie<00:07:29.860> Bell<00:07:30.130> which<00:07:30.430> is

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:30.580 
nothing like Jamie Bell which is

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:31.740 
nothing like Jamie Bell which is
especially<00:07:30.880> embarrassing<00:07:31.540> when<00:07:31.630> you

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:31.750 
especially embarrassing when you

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:33.240 
especially embarrassing when you
consider<00:07:32.110> they<00:07:32.260> probably<00:07:32.500> spent<00:07:32.980> an<00:07:33.070> awful

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:33.250

lot of money on this thing that as it

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:36.870 
lot of money on this thing that as it
turns<00:07:35.500> out<00:07:35.650> looks<00:07:36.040> worse<00:07:36.250> than<00:07:36.430> a<00:07:36.550> physical

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:36.880
