00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 Personal ai no good then could not 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.450
 show you five more apps 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.980
 favorite of the moment is here my 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.660
 cell phone from my iphone 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.210
 Only I want to talk to you first. 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.969
 We send a little something we know but 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.220
 Regina is doubtful, a lot of people do not know. 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.939
 that I'm single your youngest 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.500
 single piece and it is the following I 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.820
 I posted an instagram false then 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.010
 always posting photo with my friends 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.269
 also 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:30.330
 imagine without asking there they are giving 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.340
 very much in marriage or reject single 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.980
 latina is living for no rodrigo 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:38.040
 I know what did not yesterday yesterday. 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.020
 determined that it's been a while since 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.079
 A few weeks ago I was waiting for the 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.300
 matter calm down a bit and I myself am 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.250
 not feel safe to talk about it 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.170
 so I was letting some time pass 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.120
 to be able to clarify all this to 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.620
 you and I think one of the games 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.809
 brazil wrote on instagram 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.910

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.520

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.469

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.159
 I'm commenting with you guys. 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.909
 It happened that I was single in this 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.580
 time 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.080
 So, who commented this in relation to 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.990
 whom you want I have there is the 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:16.170
 my kiss and all the people that is 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.939
 They really understood that I got the time. 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.070
 I love you, I do not know what I think . 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.930
 You and I know who likes me but 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.210
 my side and will understand if it goes back 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.549
 Whoever dated this happens a person. 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.590
 common only you are here to clarify 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.900
 This everything I'm single I'm happy 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.369
 that way then let's go 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.520
 I'll show you my five 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:38.100
 applications of three grandchildren and the first 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.070
 the adult people this app is 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:44.009
 very successful and he is very good 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:47.970
 because youtube is like a 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:50.310
 youtube where do you think of your videos 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.729
 find music videos with any movie 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.159
 thing and you low them you low them 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.630
 that's when he upload thinks on youtube 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.610
 here where you are seeing me here stay 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.979
 carrying a business is as if this 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:05.219
 business of charging only once 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:07.200
 have always loaded to offend and he 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.819
 No need on the internet next time 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.200
 only need one of the internet that 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.730
 can carry and all 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.920
 so I found super 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:17.099
 I think it's very cool, I've already said some 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.500
 songs I've done here for liz tis show 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:24.239
 for you 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:28.140
 look at the app is this music here 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:29.700
 the historical hellish which is one of my 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.620
 favorites 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.290
 and here is for you to look for the songs 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.360
 this application is free and is 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.340
 giving a show everyone is talking 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.290
 which is very good and really application 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.329
 well cool only who spends a lot of battery 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.670
 But romelsa in these people is always 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:46.079
 listening a lot of good music and such 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.230
 the other program I'll show 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:51.269
 you other application is the asteroid 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:54.180
 many people ask me there and how 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:57.030
 You take the clear photos that you put 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:00.870
 this effect so do not know what hurt by 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:03.660
 flight is a paid application I think the 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.819
 1 99 if I'm not mistaken just that it's very good 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.310
 and I always recommend people worth it 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:09.060
 it is this application that makes those bundles 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.739
 of light 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.840
 look here I will reveal to you see the 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:16.500
 photos and it is this application that makes 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:19.590
 beams of light that makes the effects have 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.419
 a lot of fun in the application and I'm going 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:25.889
 kill you put a photo here 

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:30.239
 Anybody look at the photo here, you? 

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:33.030
 You can use the filters it rains here you can 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:34.560
 selecting the filters you can select the 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.510
 beams of light 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.819
 Our people have a lot of things to do. 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.519
 doing is interesting and will only have 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:43.620
 paid another program that is free and 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:46.470
 that many people ask me is also the 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:48.989
 This is a photo editor that is 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:51.209
 that as you put full photo 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:53.579
 on instagram whats he cut he does 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:56.010
 only that he chooses just a little square and 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:59.489
 as you put the whole fact is 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:02.430
 by rehearsal people record that the areas 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:05.069
 leave the names all my post that goes 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.690
 of the team at home down here is 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:08.069
 It 's easy, then I'll go 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:12.590
 That same way I showed you 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:16.590
 You're born light and I put it here. 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:19.380
 From here I already share pro cru is 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:22.229
 big and he already gets the whole picture, so it's 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.630
 very practical and super fast and has filters 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:24.730
 also 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:27.160
 and if you can make assemblies have 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:29.800
 you can do several things 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:33.070
 so it's very useful too it's super free 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:36.070
 easy i adore i think super useful adora 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:38.950
 even another application always uses the 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:43.030
 state can realize the application year 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:45.250
 what a game is paid is more people think 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:48.280
 Which is better because I already did because I 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:51.100
 game 88 very very much 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:54.400
 it's the verse verse zombies plants of these 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:56.470
 an encore is very good is that I'm so 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.770
 quiet that when I recorded cup made 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.770
 ozu 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:07.690
 he is very good to pause here that 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:11.260
 I've always played with my friend. 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:13.380
 so we always play and it all 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:15.640
 funds an encore and does all its planting 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:18.670
 against zombies every people has a 

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:20.380
 cool things have they got in 

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:21.940
 separate but also that I paid the 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:24.700
 extended version né 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:27.070
 in the last application end this application 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:29.590
 It is the essence of my favorite and he is 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:32.980
 very useful, so be so much to me it's very 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:34.210
 useful right which is the film where the ville 

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:36.040
 you are 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:39.760
 you can see which movies are in 

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:40.450
 movie poster will be on the look of mine 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:43.150

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:45.610

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:49.420
 passing on rio de janeiro was the taison 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:53.500
 such a white river can be in any 

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:55.330
 place he talks about the theaters 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:57.250
 who is more likely to have a poster that 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:59.140
 The time is passing so I 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:00.010
 I always leave here my creek of the 

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:01.990

 Look at our upcoming movies. 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:20.620
 so it's cool, I think it's super useful 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:22.660
 where I'm just like the people speak 

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:24.400

 If you liked the news, I too. 

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:45.490
 I feel sorry for what I said and I 'm happy. 

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:47.830
 that way and I wanted to ask for two 

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:50.410
 favorites to you first mentioned here 

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:52.150

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:54.280
 wherever it appears that 

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:55.960
 you respect and one that 

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:57.280
 subject ends here I do not want 

00:06:55.960 --> 00:07:01.240
 No one comes back I do not want anyone to 

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:03.130
 Please, we came back but came back. 

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:04.360
 bad so we decided to stay separate 

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:06.430
 stay friends 

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:07.930
 This way it 's better for us, I did not like it 

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:10.000
 because it's a personal thing . 

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:12.130
 My, I do not need to keep counting. 

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.590
 so openly for everybody right that 

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:19.479
 There are a lot of people who see that I prefer to stay 

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:21.490

00:07:19.479 --> 00:07:23.199
