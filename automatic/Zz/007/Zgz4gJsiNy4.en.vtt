that<00:00:32.969> it<00:00:33.180> would<00:00:33.329> be<00:00:33.420> better<00:00:33.600> to<00:00:33.719> write<00:00:34.050> their

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
that it would be better to write their

that it would be better to write their
own<00:00:34.260> articles<00:00:34.649> instead<00:00:35.219> of<00:00:35.399> paying<00:00:35.640> for<00:00:35.880> PLR

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
own articles instead of paying for PLR

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.750 
own articles instead of paying for PLR
articles<00:00:36.390> that<00:00:37.079> they<00:00:37.230> have<00:00:37.380> to<00:00:37.559> rewrite<00:00:37.890> but

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
articles that they have to rewrite but

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.729 
articles that they have to rewrite but
it's<00:00:38.879> actually<00:00:39.239> very<00:00:39.450> easy<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:39.989> do<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:40.530> pretty

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
it's actually very easy to do and pretty

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:41.330 
it's actually very easy to do and pretty
fast

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340

so<00:00:41.790> using<00:00:42.030> PLR<00:00:42.629> can<00:00:42.870> still<00:00:43.170> be<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.559> most<00:00:43.770> cost

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
so using PLR can still be the most cost

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.279 
so using PLR can still be the most cost
efficient<00:00:44.579> and<00:00:44.730> timely<00:00:45.149> option<00:00:45.809> for<00:00:46.079> fresh
