them too big so you can see now take

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.340 
them too big so you can see now take
your<00:04:05.700> pointy<00:04:06.030> tool<00:04:06.180> and<00:04:06.420> poke<00:04:06.630> in<00:04:06.810> the<00:04:06.870> hole<00:04:07.140> on

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
your pointy tool and poke in the hole on

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.350 
your pointy tool and poke in the hole on
top<00:04:07.380> because<00:04:07.800> um<00:04:08.250> your<00:04:08.790> strawberry<00:04:09.210> would

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
top because um your strawberry would

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.990 
top because um your strawberry would
have<00:04:09.480> a<00:04:09.510> little<00:04:10.010> indention<00:04:11.010> there<00:04:11.190> and<00:04:11.400> you

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
have a little indention there and you

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:19.190 
have a little indention there and you
can<00:04:12.350> continue<00:04:13.350> to<00:04:15.890> get<00:04:16.890> those<00:04:17.130> little<00:04:18.200> the

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
can continue to get those little the

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:24.590 
can continue to get those little the
little<00:04:19.230> green<00:04:19.650> part<00:04:19.950> down<00:04:21.590> and<00:04:22.640> there<00:04:23.640> is<00:04:23.880> that

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
little green part down and there is that

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.270 
little green part down and there is that
would<00:04:24.780> be<00:04:24.930> a<00:04:24.960> finished<00:04:25.410> one<00:04:25.920> finished

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
would be a finished one finished

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.930 
would be a finished one finished
strawberry<00:04:26.760> for<00:04:27.540> the<00:04:28.190> distal<00:04:29.190> I<00:04:29.430> on<00:04:29.670> the

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
strawberry for the distal I on the

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.900 
strawberry for the distal I on the
outside<00:04:30.300> it's<00:04:30.510> not<00:04:30.630> a<00:04:30.690> tarp<00:04:31.380> strawberry<00:04:31.920> or

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 
outside it's not a tarp strawberry or

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.790 
outside it's not a tarp strawberry or
sliced<00:04:33.840> what<00:04:34.020> I<00:04:34.050> mean<00:04:34.230> if<00:04:34.980> you<00:04:35.430> want<00:04:35.760> to<00:04:36.420> have

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
sliced what I mean if you want to have

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:42.410 
sliced what I mean if you want to have
seeds<00:04:37.800> on<00:04:38.160> it<00:04:38.810> you<00:04:39.810> can<00:04:40.020> do<00:04:40.260> that<00:04:40.500> as<00:04:40.740> well<00:04:41.420> it

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:42.420 
seeds on it you can do that as well it

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:45.650 
seeds on it you can do that as well it
looks<00:04:43.160> to<00:04:44.160> me<00:04:44.190> I<00:04:44.610> like<00:04:44.910> the<00:04:45.060> one<00:04:45.210> that<00:04:45.330> does<00:04:45.510> not

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
looks to me I like the one that does not

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.210 
looks to me I like the one that does not
have<00:04:45.840> seeds<00:04:46.050> because<00:04:46.320> I<00:04:46.470> think<00:04:46.740> it<00:04:46.830> looks<00:04:47.040> more

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 
have seeds because I think it looks more

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.150 
have seeds because I think it looks more
realistic<00:04:47.610> with<00:04:48.000> just<00:04:48.270> the<00:04:48.420> little

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.160 
realistic with just the little

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.680 
realistic with just the little
indentions<00:04:50.160> but<00:04:50.580> if<00:04:50.730> you<00:04:50.850> want<00:04:51.060> seeds<00:04:51.330> on<00:04:51.540> it

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:51.690 
indentions but if you want seeds on it

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:55.340 
indentions but if you want seeds on it

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:47.090 
and I kind of get a little aggressive
with<00:05:44.730> it<00:05:44.760> and<00:05:45.120> you<00:05:46.110> beat<00:05:46.440> it<00:05:46.590> against<00:05:46.860> the

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:47.100 
with it and you beat it against the

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:53.960 
with it and you beat it against the
walls<00:05:49.820> and<00:05:52.340> you're<00:05:53.340> going<00:05:53.490> to<00:05:53.550> lose<00:05:53.730> all

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:53.970 
walls and you're going to lose all

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:56.780 
walls and you're going to lose all
indentions<00:05:54.840> and<00:05:55.200> well<00:05:56.010> pretty<00:05:56.370> much<00:05:56.550> all

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:56.790 
indentions and well pretty much all

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:58.940 
indentions and well pretty much all
intentions<00:05:57.390> and<00:05:57.600> you're<00:05:58.200> going<00:05:58.320> to<00:05:58.380> have<00:05:58.740> to

00:05:58.940 --> 00:05:58.950 
intentions and you're going to have to

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:00.930 
intentions and you're going to have to
reshape<00:05:59.340> it

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:00.940 
reshape it

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:10.350 
reshape it
but<00:06:03.330> can<00:06:04.330> get<00:06:04.510> by<00:06:05.640> night<00:06:06.640> and<00:06:07.860> anyway<00:06:08.860> so<00:06:09.360> you

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:10.360 
but can get by night and anyway so you

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:13.050 
but can get by night and anyway so you
just<00:06:10.600> keep<00:06:10.980> squishing<00:06:11.980> it<00:06:12.400> until<00:06:12.760> you<00:06:12.880> get

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:13.060 
just keep squishing it until you get

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:14.730 
just keep squishing it until you get
enough<00:06:13.180> beads<00:06:13.600> on<00:06:13.840> there<00:06:14.110> that<00:06:14.140> it<00:06:14.440> looks<00:06:14.620> like

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:14.740 
enough beads on there that it looks like

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:20.940 
enough beads on there that it looks like
tons<00:06:15.730> of<00:06:15.910> little<00:06:16.120> seeds<00:06:19.440> you<00:06:20.440> have<00:06:20.560> to<00:06:20.710> roll

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:20.950 
tons of little seeds you have to roll

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:29.400 
tons of little seeds you have to roll
them<00:06:21.100> in<00:06:21.250> make<00:06:21.490> sure<00:06:21.520> you<00:06:27.870> make<00:06:28.870> sure<00:06:29.020> that<00:06:29.260> the

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:29.410 
them in make sure you make sure that the

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:31.620 
them in make sure you make sure that the
seeds<00:06:29.680> are<00:06:29.890> flush<00:06:30.520> with<00:06:30.550> the<00:06:30.940> skin<00:06:31.360> they're

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:31.630 
seeds are flush with the skin they're

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:34.110 
seeds are flush with the skin they're
not<00:06:31.780> sticking<00:06:32.260> up<00:06:32.470> because<00:06:33.310> if<00:06:33.550> they're

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:34.120 
not sticking up because if they're

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.330 
not sticking up because if they're
sticking<00:06:34.660> up<00:06:34.810> then<00:06:35.050> they<00:06:35.260> look<00:06:35.410> you<00:06:35.740> know<00:06:35.860> fake

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:36.340
