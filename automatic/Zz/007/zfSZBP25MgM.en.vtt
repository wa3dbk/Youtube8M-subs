00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.930 

skip<00:02:10.490> the<00:02:10.610> cutscene<00:02:12.400> jump<00:02:13.400> over<00:02:13.640> the<00:02:13.730> biggie

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
skip the cutscene jump over the biggie

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.170 
skip the cutscene jump over the biggie
here<00:02:14.210> so<00:02:14.450> I<00:02:14.510> could<00:02:15.040> watch<00:02:16.040> it<00:02:16.280> see<00:02:16.850> the<00:02:16.940> Viper

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
here so I could watch it see the Viper

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.780 
here so I could watch it see the Viper
pretty<00:02:17.540> much<00:02:17.690> smokes<00:02:18.080> ass

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.589 

so<00:02:22.299> use<00:02:22.420> him<00:02:22.599> 220<00:02:23.260> now<00:02:24.030> the<00:02:25.030> quarterback<00:02:25.299> can

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:25.599 
so use him 220 now the quarterback can

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:30.040 
so use him 220 now the quarterback can
only<00:02:25.750> do<00:02:25.989> about<00:02:26.230> 209<00:02:26.980> 210

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.230 

so<00:02:30.980> the<00:02:31.100> Viper<00:02:31.310> pretty<00:02:31.640> much<00:02:31.790> wins<00:02:32.000> every<00:02:32.180> time

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240 
so the Viper pretty much wins every time

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.180 
so the Viper pretty much wins every time
there's<00:02:32.570> always<00:02:32.690> three<00:02:33.140> three<00:02:33.650> races<00:02:33.860> on

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
there's always three three races on

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.760 
there's always three three races on
