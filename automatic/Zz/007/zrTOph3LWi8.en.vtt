00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:10.410
 and good morning to all and banks get 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.849
 find today for a small 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.990
 video on battlefield hardline one 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.790
 gameplay I'm going to record just 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.870
 after the update so that has nerve and 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.430
 the sniper and you will be able 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.109
 find that despite that was always 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.820
 possible sniper game against it's 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.920
 at the only condition of play on a map 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.029
 like banks and so a map where we are 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.289
 practically all the time to the body at 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.369
 body one because if not long 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.019
 distance I did some tests on the 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.630
 conquest it really became very 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.529
 difficult to play the sniper so 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.099
 Besides, we're going to talk a lot 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.690
 samphire 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.489
 little anecdote we are with sir 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.530
 dick said we have in the squad where the 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.879
 title of the video and so it is 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.680
 always alive if it reassures you 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.940
 and know that he promised me there is 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.200
 some time on twitter that forces a 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.840
 release in a next video 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.700
 before 2010 so be reassured before 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.890
 before 2007 we will have a new video of 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.899
 ten guides x lol one is also with 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.340
 aq sister joely to gtx in the scop is 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.050
 what you hear in the background 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.670
 I recorded my microphone so I 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.199
 recommend on top of that we have already 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.239
 did four he rather rather 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.980
 not bad and you see that these are 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.270
 kills a pretty short distance 1 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.890
 even the objects killed when I jumped 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.720
 stairs he was close enough to me 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.280
 it's the limit at the distance level 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.869
 after that gets really too hardcore 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.280
 so precisely did they have 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.810
 Nerve the sniper with the balls 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.570
 magnum because I always have the most 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.729
 malignant or is it all right 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.920
 donor has become useless a point he 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.509
 have already asked the number one question 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.400
 what is a well balanced sniper 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.750
 in a game with regard to good sniper 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.360
 the boss lipper you see he was shooting 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.820
 he makes the chill a hoof snipers gallop 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.979
 - snipers he was shooting year touch that's 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.970
 not a nice sniper you see me I was 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.560
 obliged to do this I 'm sorry 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.579
 so a good sniper for me what is it 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.799
 it's a server that will benefit 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.700
 long distance gameplay obviously he 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.560
 must not be totally 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.810
 useless at short distance 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.860
 thereby reducing this damage to 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.450
 long distance as they did 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.070
 with the Balmanese I do not find that 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.479
 necessarily very logical look at the web 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.490
 on the 16 go a game that is still 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.439
 very very well balanced since since 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.259
 as long as we have house cs the time of 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.390
 work on the cotton wool on one shot 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.460
 whatever the distance 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.259
 however, the damage obviously decreases 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.729
 and especially the damage decreases when we 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.840
 shoot in the legs or for me that 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.280
 hyper must one thing when we shoot 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.680
 in the upper body during this charter 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.090
 when we are very long distance 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.259
 choose to favor shooting in 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.090
 the head so when one pulls present in 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.470
 the upper body and without lips to 90% of 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.210
 life after will take out the peso you 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.130
 put a second shot to kill the 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.250
 opposite person is another point that 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:21.290
 is positive with loud in 16 go 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.980
 is that when we shoot his first push 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.600
 up down 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.520
 we do not have time to draw one 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.920
 second on the spleen that is to say that the 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.170
 no one in front the 1st 4 or or has only 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.650
 we kill if we are pretty much with 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:36.290
 maximum 50 m is a pure - snipers fingers 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.209
 how to say having a reload to his 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.260
 long eyelashes and very powerful lasson 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:41.180
 reloading must be all the more 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.830
 long that he is powerful brings 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.630
 distance and so that's for example 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.459
 rather than nerve and damage from 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.150
 magnum flights it would have had to increase the 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:49.520
 reload time 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:53.480
 even with the ammann breech offers the 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.950
 wmc an example or so in this case 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.970
 if we miss his first shoot and we 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.260
 wants to leave the chance anyway at 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.450
 sniper not to die in melee this 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.370
 what to do is increase the end 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.600
 ten minutes of switch speed 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.130
 of weapons that is to say that return on 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.750
 his main weapon and miss his 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.680
 shot we can still have the time to 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.070
 to take a few steps of his weapon 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.390
 secondary 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:09.739
 so if ever the studio will 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.940
 it's to make a sniper who sees chet 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:11.870
 not at short distance to anywhere else and 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.910
 abderrahmane distance 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.290
 it could in this case increase the 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.090
 switch well because it's not going at all 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.620
 is possible that I snip there you 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.459
 see gameplay in haiti on a map 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.470
 who is very small 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:23.870
 who really is when each time 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.850
 we shift a wall we went to go to 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.930
 20 meters 30 meters away from the opponents 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.160
 it's really very very close 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.510
 these games if you play in account is 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.930
 to conquer by whose gameplay 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:34.070
 become the dog ie that instead 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.450
 to do 29 points like I do 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:37.280
 on this part I'm going I was doing some 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.260
 scores reassure ratios of 1.1 and 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.640
 half what is not good for a 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.260
 sniper at long distance because I 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.600
 played long distance it's very very 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.560
 very complicated on the line of play 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.600
 long distance sniper 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.549
 I do not find it necessarily very logical 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.200
 we always blamed for having a kid 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:53.030
 of gameplay or snipers at the call of 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.620
 Duty ie wadi that AÃ¯ssi 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.329
 quick scope is not like that 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.470
 must have a sniper but precisely these 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:59.720
 people there who find that I play 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:01.640
 like a kikoo have to agree 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.989
 with you on the fact a sniper must be 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.329
 advantage at long distance, that is to say 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:07.640
 that it must end due to good 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:09.140
 things it must do the receiving 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.700
 full head or upper body 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.079
 after we will say that they can 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.060
 move the short distance area this is to 

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:16.220
 to say that you can one shot in the lobby at 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.420
 i saved axr jo you can one shot in 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.380
 The belly 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:21.200
 while I can not do it long 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.370
 distance red say but the sniper must 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.570
 to be favored at long distance because 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:24.800
 that is the logic of the gameplay 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.390
 do not hesitate to tell me this is 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.520
 agree or totally disagree with this 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:29.870
 what I say in the comments is 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.430
 what for you a good snipers 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:34.150
 how to balance a sniper 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:36.830
 to be properly playable 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:38.480
 in play and that is balanced by to screw 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.430
 gun shotguns 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.630
 assault and that's it really and this is where 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.310
 typically see I have no less than 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:45.470
 shock we are at thirty meters I'm going 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:48.020
 shoot roughly at the level of the soft belly 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:49.400
 it's in his back so it seems to me 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.410
 to say logical because I was pretty 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.450
 far I shot in the lower abdomen 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:54.980
 who are doing one shot it does not shock me 

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:56.960
 does he can find a happy medium 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:58.850
 between sniper gameplay that allows 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.860
 to be or judge her I have a little bit of 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:01.970
 badly a tamm a geek angels allowed 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.920
 to be playable whatever it is 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:05.600
 either the distance and a sniper gameplay 

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:08.000
 who will also avoid that two people 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.380
 to camp because to certify 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.300
 snipers are less distant people are going 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:12.620
 start camping on the roofs we have 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.360
 already seen a few during beta 2 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.520
 airlines and frankly it breaks them 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.810
 balls to everyone in his own 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.530
 team the fact of not playing a 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:20.090
 goal 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:21.470
 it makes you lose the game and in 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:23.300
 the team opposite is super boring 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:23.780
 fashion by Mekhe on an intuable roof etc 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.580
 etc. 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:27.980
 so we have to find a happy medium 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:29.600
 between an aggressive sniper abusing and a 

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:31.220
 long-range sniper whether they be 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.600
 playable without allowing 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.890
 camping every time so here you are 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.390
 have my point of view on the scared style 

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:36.410
 tell me what you think about them in 

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:37.730
 comments if you think that at 

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:38.690
 otherwise a server must be played at 

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:40.280
 long distance is no problem I 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:41.270
 completely understand 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.400
 me it's not like that I play 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:45.139
 since the target years of 2000 because 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:47.210
 that it's top I was playing acs so 

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:49.639
 pretty aggressive too with the voice peace 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:51.260
 with the scout at the time but I 

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:52.820
 understand that we can have a point of 

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:55.730
 quite different view just needs that 

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:57.800
 you told me why you see them 

00:05:55.730 --> 00:06:00.169
 things otherwise cocoon compass the ad-pa 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:02.410
 a real debate and not just nantes and
