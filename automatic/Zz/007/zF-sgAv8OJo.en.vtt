00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:11.010
 miguelito rubiano good morning very close 

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:12.630
 to start the turn of italy that the 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.389
 message that you want to send to all 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.370
 colombia good morning profe yes yes the 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.560
 message is that they support us during 

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:21.210
 all the turn very motivated to leave or 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.090
 criticizes the team is very good with 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.970
 great expectations we expect or criticize 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.920
 These three stages of Northern Ireland 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.500
 overcome them well because they are a bit 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.230
 difficult with this climate but good 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.420
 when we go to italy it was all better 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.100
 experience that tells you of this turn of 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.989
 italy where the knowledge that counts 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.719
 you have italy the same 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.239
 race where he has won stage where is 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.430
 a very important good runner this 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.199
 I turn particularly I see that you are 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.190
 three stages are not easy because 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:54.690
 they have a little bit of hills and wind 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.760
 difficult roads also because the 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.430
 asphalt that is a bit is asphalt 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.469
 draining then hard asphalt after 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.930
 We arrived in Italy where once and for all 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.080
 begin difficult stages stages 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.140
 complicated because 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:12.170
 in the first week and we found 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:14.720
 four arrivals in his life in at tico and 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:17.000
 and the second week logically other 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.700
 four and to top off the third week 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.370
 there are already four other hard hard stages 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.500
 hard that's where you decide the 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:27.320
 general as I found you in this 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:30.380
 team in this year I found myself well 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:33.050
 I've had support from all 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:37.100
 the staff and everyone very well always 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:39.409
 comfortable the calendar was very good 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.780
 if I'm really happy to be 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:43.400
 here and for representing Colombia and 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.190
 especially now for being the champion 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.840
 national is like a special brand and 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:51.440
 give the national champion shirt no 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:54.420
 yes of course yes that pass feels a lot 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:57.180
 big pride satisfaction 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.369
 on the road they recognize me already some 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.140
 Colombian flag yell at her 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.290
 once from colombia colombiano after 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.729
 is motivating because then in Italy a 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.940
 little did they know me and whites with the 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.979
 T-shirt will be much nicer shipyard 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.080
 what does it mean to you since the year 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.060
 past and are part of the colombia battalion 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.800
 we had and this year is almost the same 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.900
 number of runners some meaning 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.340
 special to have 14 Colombian runners 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:25.769
 in the lot of the thread yes of course yes 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:29.239
 this particular year that the years year 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:29.239
 previous we already found 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:35.430
 two squad leaders per tour for 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:38.280
 Colombians for the victory of the turn 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.680
 so then the Colombians are equal 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.110
 stronger this year we more 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.180
 Motivated as a team 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.460

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.250
 experience they have where last year 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:54.030
 I saw that he says they became big 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:56.730
 prominence then this year 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.440
 we are more motivated we even encourage 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.740

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.810

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:05.130
