yeah<00:01:22.229> I<00:01:22.259> know<00:01:22.350> this<00:01:22.590> genetics<00:01:23.070> and<00:01:23.220> stuff<00:01:23.340> like

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
yeah I know this genetics and stuff like

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.859 
yeah I know this genetics and stuff like
that<00:01:23.490> but<00:01:23.610> it's<00:01:23.820> also<00:01:24.030> training<00:01:24.540> and

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
that but it's also training and

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.359 
that but it's also training and
nutrition<00:01:25.340> so<00:01:26.479> one<00:01:27.479> thing<00:01:27.630> I<00:01:27.750> noticed<00:01:28.110> about

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
nutrition so one thing I noticed about

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:30.499

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
beef like weeks before I guess they

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:28.640
