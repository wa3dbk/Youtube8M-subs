so<00:03:09.110> far<00:03:09.140> in<00:03:09.590> my<00:03:09.680> opinion<00:03:09.920> the<00:03:10.550> Bliss<00:03:10.730> has

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
so far in my opinion the Bliss has

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.550 
so far in my opinion the Bliss has
really<00:03:11.060> cool<00:03:11.270> comes<00:03:11.720> in<00:03:11.870> really<00:03:12.020> quickly<00:03:12.290> but

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
really cool comes in really quickly but

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.440 
really cool comes in really quickly but
a<00:03:12.710> lot<00:03:12.830> of<00:03:12.860> hit<00:03:13.040> markers<00:03:13.370> that<00:03:13.580> pisses<00:03:14.270> me<00:03:14.420> off

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
a lot of hit markers that pisses me off

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:20.500 
a lot of hit markers that pisses me off
so<00:03:15.350> this<00:03:15.500> one<00:03:16.450> see<00:03:17.450> here<00:03:18.820> do<00:03:19.820> fifty<00:03:20.150> one<00:03:20.270> shot

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
so this one see here do fifty one shot

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.870 
so this one see here do fifty one shot
kills<00:03:20.810> and<00:03:21.140> then<00:03:21.440> my<00:03:22.340> short<00:03:22.550> things<00:03:22.700> are<00:03:22.760> going

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.460 
kills and then my short things are going
to<00:03:22.940> be<00:03:23.090> I'll<00:03:23.630> go<00:03:23.780> and<00:03:23.930> try<00:03:24.050> to<00:03:24.110> do<00:03:24.170> that<00:03:24.260> today

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
to be I'll go and try to do that today

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.560 
to be I'll go and try to do that today
and<00:03:24.950> tomorrow<00:03:25.280> try<00:03:25.610> to<00:03:25.640> get<00:03:25.820> this<00:03:25.970> one<00:03:26.150> golden

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:26.570 
and tomorrow try to get this one golden

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:28.690 
and tomorrow try to get this one golden
and<00:03:26.780> make<00:03:27.620> it<00:03:27.710> Freddie<00:03:27.860> about<00:03:28.070> make<00:03:28.280> snipers

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
and make it Freddie about make snipers

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.420 
and make it Freddie about make snipers
gold<00:03:28.970> but<00:03:29.480> auto<00:03:30.290> vice<00:03:30.470> video<00:03:30.770> too<00:03:30.920> long<00:03:30.950> so<00:03:31.370> i

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
gold but auto vice video too long so i

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.090 
gold but auto vice video too long so i
guess<00:03:31.460> i<00:03:31.670> get<00:03:31.820> golden<00:03:32.090> guns<00:03:32.270> is<00:03:32.420> really<00:03:32.630> easy
