hey people as the title says i am going
to<00:00:06.150> be<00:00:06.240> given<00:00:06.540> a<00:00:06.629> review<00:00:07.080> on<00:00:07.319> the<00:00:08.010> mac

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
to be given a review on the mac

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.910 
to be given a review on the mac
mineralized<00:00:09.240> satin<00:00:09.690> finish<00:00:10.080> liquid

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
mineralized satin finish liquid

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.999 
mineralized satin finish liquid
foundation<00:00:11.809> I<00:00:12.809> know<00:00:13.200> this<00:00:13.469> has<00:00:13.620> brought<00:00:13.799> out<00:00:13.980> a

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
foundation I know this has brought out a

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.010 
foundation I know this has brought out a
few<00:00:14.250> years<00:00:14.309> ago<00:00:14.580> but<00:00:15.480> I<00:00:15.540> think<00:00:15.660> there<00:00:15.900> was<00:00:15.929> a

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
few years ago but I think there was a

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.599 
few years ago but I think there was a
problem<00:00:16.320> with<00:00:16.560> sourcing<00:00:17.220> some<00:00:17.369> of<00:00:17.490> the

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
problem with sourcing some of the

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.510 
problem with sourcing some of the
ingredients<00:00:17.699> and<00:00:18.300> it<00:00:18.359> was<00:00:18.449> slowly<00:00:18.660> phased<00:00:19.020> out

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:19.520 
ingredients and it was slowly phased out

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.689 
ingredients and it was slowly phased out
so<00:00:20.520> it<00:00:20.730> was<00:00:20.850> either<00:00:21.859> relaunched<00:00:22.859> this<00:00:23.100> year<00:00:23.430> in

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
so it was either relaunched this year in

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.179 
so it was either relaunched this year in
the<00:00:23.970> UK<00:00:24.269> or<00:00:24.810> it<00:00:25.380> should<00:00:25.590> have<00:00:25.800> it<00:00:26.010> just

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
the UK or it should have it just

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.980 
the UK or it should have it just
happened<00:00:26.490> to<00:00:26.519> be<00:00:26.580> hype<00:00:26.820> heavily<00:00:27.180> promoted<00:00:27.720> so

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
happened to be hype heavily promoted so

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.070 
happened to be hype heavily promoted so
I<00:00:28.019> thought<00:00:28.289> I'd<00:00:28.529> give<00:00:28.740> it<00:00:28.769> a<00:00:28.859> try<00:00:29.449> it<00:00:30.449> costs

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
I thought I'd give it a try it costs

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.729 
I thought I'd give it a try it costs
around<00:00:31.640> 23<00:00:32.640> pounds<00:00:32.880> here<00:00:33.329> in<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.570> UK<00:00:33.719> and<00:00:34.230> I

to unlock and lock we're not in use this

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.020 
to unlock and lock we're not in use this
is<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.579> edge<00:01:02.699> bonus<00:01:03.239> because<00:01:04.670> otherwise<00:01:05.670> I

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
is the edge bonus because otherwise I

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.580 
is the edge bonus because otherwise I
would<00:01:06.150> have<00:01:06.180> had<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.510> go<00:01:06.659> out<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:06.810> buy<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.140> pump

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
would have had to go out and buy a pump

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.140 
would have had to go out and buy a pump
for<00:01:07.740> mac<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:07.979> I<00:01:08.220> think<00:01:08.430> that<00:01:08.549> that's<00:01:08.580> around

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
for mac and I think that that's around

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.440 
for mac and I think that that's around
three<00:01:09.450> pounds<00:01:09.840> here<00:01:10.610> it's<00:01:11.610> not<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.939> best<00:01:12.090> pump

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
three pounds here it's not the best pump

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:19.539 
three pounds here it's not the best pump
lid<00:01:12.720> but<00:01:13.650> it<00:01:13.860> does<00:01:14.340> its<00:01:14.520> job<00:01:14.760> so<00:01:15.270> they<00:01:16.110> go<00:01:17.689> now

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:19.549 
lid but it does its job so they go now

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:22.789 
lid but it does its job so they go now
for<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.640> purpose<00:01:21.060> of<00:01:21.180> this<00:01:21.240> video<00:01:21.509> I've<00:01:22.110> just

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
for the purpose of this video I've just

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.170 
for the purpose of this video I've just
freshly<00:01:23.369> applied<00:01:23.610> this<00:01:24.150> on<00:01:24.509> with<00:01:25.229> my<00:01:26.180> Sigma

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
freshly applied this on with my Sigma

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:33.190 
freshly applied this on with my Sigma
f80<00:01:27.840> brush<00:01:29.509> over<00:01:30.509> my<00:01:30.689> foundation<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.500> primer

throughout time I'm wearing this and

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.890 
throughout time I'm wearing this and
even<00:02:48.760> then<00:02:49.290> after<00:02:50.290> about<00:02:50.379> 3-4<00:02:51.069> hours<00:02:51.579> I<00:02:51.900> find

even then after about 3-4 hours I find

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.949 
even then after about 3-4 hours I find
that<00:02:53.049> I<00:02:53.109> don't<00:02:53.650> have<00:02:53.769> any<00:02:54.599> coverage<00:02:55.599> left

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
that I don't have any coverage left

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.429 
that I don't have any coverage left
around<00:02:56.290> my<00:02:56.469> t-zone<00:02:56.680> and<00:02:58.049> around<00:02:59.049> my<00:02:59.169> cheeks

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:04.379 
around my t-zone and around my cheeks

where most of my oils are so I end up
starting<00:03:04.810> to<00:03:05.049> look<00:03:05.169> a<00:03:05.290> bit<00:03:05.469> patchy<00:03:06.060> which

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
starting to look a bit patchy which

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.490 
starting to look a bit patchy which
isn't<00:03:07.239> good<00:03:08.969> also<00:03:09.969> it<00:03:10.299> says<00:03:10.629> it<00:03:10.780> has<00:03:10.930> light<00:03:11.290> to

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
isn't good also it says it has light to

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
medium coverage that is buildable now I

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.259 
medium coverage that is buildable now I
find<00:03:15.069> that<00:03:15.310> this<00:03:15.549> is<00:03:15.790> very<00:03:16.259> sheer<00:03:18.000> to<00:03:19.000> have

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
find that this is very sheer to have

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:23.069 
find that this is very sheer to have
coverage<00:03:19.659> anywhere<00:03:20.500> near<00:03:21.150> say<00:03:22.150> their<00:03:22.479> studio

00:04:02.999 --> 00:04:03.009 
definitely do but despite all that when

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:06.629 
definitely do but despite all that when

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:06.639 
it's freshly put on it's amazing it

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:11.159 
it's freshly put on it's amazing it
makes<00:04:08.039> my<00:04:09.039> skin<00:04:09.099> look<00:04:09.609> brighter<00:04:09.879> it<00:04:10.569> makes<00:04:11.019> my

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:11.169 
makes my skin look brighter it makes my

00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:13.249 
makes my skin look brighter it makes my
skin<00:04:11.229> look<00:04:11.469> healthier<00:04:12.069> and<00:04:12.340> I<00:04:12.549> have<00:04:12.759> a<00:04:12.789> nice

00:04:13.249 --> 00:04:13.259 
skin look healthier and I have a nice

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:15.990 
skin look healthier and I have a nice
glow<00:04:14.340> especially<00:04:15.340> out<00:04:15.489> in<00:04:15.519> the<00:04:15.759> sunlight

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
glow especially out in the sunlight

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.319 
glow especially out in the sunlight
where<00:04:16.959> the<00:04:17.289> light<00:04:17.799> hits<00:04:18.519> the<00:04:18.849> shimmery

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329 
where the light hits the shimmery

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:21.420 
where the light hits the shimmery
particles<00:04:19.959> and<00:04:20.169> it<00:04:20.799> just<00:04:20.979> looks<00:04:21.190> really

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
particles and it just looks really

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
particles and it just looks really
really<00:04:21.760> good<00:04:23.969> so<00:04:24.969> this

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
really good so this

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:29.030 
really good so this
so<00:04:25.870> this<00:04:26.380> in<00:04:26.920> general<00:04:27.520> would<00:04:27.760> make<00:04:28.120> a<00:04:28.540> good

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
so this in general would make a good

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.130 
so this in general would make a good
summer<00:04:30.040> foundation<00:04:30.850> if<00:04:31.150> it<00:04:31.630> wasn't<00:04:31.900> for<00:04:31.930> the

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:32.140 
summer foundation if it wasn't for the

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:33.570 
summer foundation if it wasn't for the
fact<00:04:32.320> it<00:04:32.560> doesn't<00:04:32.710> have<00:04:32.890> a<00:04:32.920> lot<00:04:33.070> of<00:04:33.100> holding

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
fact it doesn't have a lot of holding

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.710 
fact it doesn't have a lot of holding
power<00:04:35.370> the<00:04:36.370> I<00:04:36.400> suppose<00:04:36.760> it<00:04:37.030> would<00:04:37.060> also<00:04:37.450> make<00:04:37.660> a

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 
power the I suppose it would also make a

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.160 
power the I suppose it would also make a
good<00:04:38.020> winter<00:04:38.800> foundation<00:04:39.370> as<00:04:39.460> well

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:40.170 
good winter foundation as well

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:43.020 
good winter foundation as well
considering<00:04:41.170> my<00:04:41.440> skin's<00:04:42.070> hits<00:04:42.280> do<00:04:42.460> tends<00:04:42.910> to

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
considering my skin's hits do tends to

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:48.030 
considering my skin's hits do tends to
get<00:04:43.150> quite<00:04:43.390> doll<00:04:43.660> in<00:04:43.900> the<00:04:43.990> winter<00:04:44.410> and<00:04:46.500> if<00:04:47.500> I

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:48.040 
get quite doll in the winter and if I

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.120 
get quite doll in the winter and if I
put<00:04:48.250> this<00:04:48.280> on<00:04:48.610> I'm<00:04:49.000> assuming<00:04:49.750> that<00:04:50.200> it<00:04:50.800> would

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.130 
put this on I'm assuming that it would

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.160 
put this on I'm assuming that it would
at<00:04:51.610> least<00:04:51.790> look<00:04:52.090> a<00:04:52.180> bit<00:04:52.360> healthier<00:04:52.570> and

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:53.170 
at least look a bit healthier and

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:56.730 
at least look a bit healthier and
brighter<00:04:53.590> and<00:04:54.930> also<00:04:55.930> my<00:04:56.110> skins<00:04:56.410> are<00:04:56.650> not

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:56.740 
brighter and also my skins are not

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.580 
brighter and also my skins are not
drying<00:04:57.040> boletus<00:04:57.700> so<00:04:58.600> maybe<00:04:58.870> it<00:04:59.080> will<00:04:59.170> stay<00:04:59.560> on

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
drying boletus so maybe it will stay on

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:05.520 
drying boletus so maybe it will stay on
better<00:05:01.140> anyway<00:05:02.670> overall<00:05:03.670> I<00:05:04.260> don't<00:05:05.260> recommend

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:05.530 
better anyway overall I don't recommend

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:08.070

but if you're just gonna go out for a

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:54.540 
but if you're just gonna go out for a
couple<00:05:52.960> of<00:05:53.050> hours<00:05:53.230> and<00:05:53.860> you<00:05:54.010> just<00:05:54.220> don't<00:05:54.340> want

couple of hours and you just don't want

to put a lot of makeup on then just

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:01.350 
to put a lot of makeup on then just
quickly<00:05:58.660> set<00:05:58.930> this<00:05:59.050> on<00:05:59.290> it<00:06:00.280> lasts<00:06:00.610> a<00:06:01.030> couple<00:06:01.060> of

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:01.360 
quickly set this on it lasts a couple of

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.560 
quickly set this on it lasts a couple of
hours<00:06:01.510> if<00:06:02.050> you've<00:06:02.380> got<00:06:03.150> normal<00:06:04.150> to<00:06:04.330> dry<00:06:04.360> skin
