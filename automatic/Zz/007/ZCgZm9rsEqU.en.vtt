00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:22.230
 hello dear friends is nice to me 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.439
 your job at briggs ahead 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:31.259
 This time I have the 21 109 for you 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:34.920
 lego 107 the access judt the set came as 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:39.030
 lego exclusive article in summer 2014 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.460
 the market a total of 321 parts two mini 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.830
 figures and the age recommendation is 12 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.180
 plus the interest and the driver 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.160
 After this set is really incredible 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.320
 even at lego this was partial 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.570
 already sold out and is located 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.159
 currently too much sweat again in the delivery 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.239
 residue, we come but first 

00:00:53.159 --> 00:01:00.360
 to the mini figures and that's the same 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.369
 like his colleague a classic space 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.140
 lego figurine pose of course is the 

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:06.240
 helm something different and green gave it the 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.659
 never, but only a blue 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.210
 white red and yellow that 's now peet 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.799
 Kolleg Fc comes with an accessory and 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.369
 Although this is a wireless device that know 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:20.250
 We are from numerous lego city chiefs and 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.470
 pete are on their way in space around 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.570
 to follow the signal as we will later 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.430
 that explains why 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.770
 the minifigures are a bit more modern 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.310
 look like the classic space 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.920
 characters 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.810
 I have two space figures by chance 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.370
 get here, we now have even a 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.620
 red and a yellow as you can see 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:40.640
 the helmets are a bit different 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:44.400
 These are still original figures from the 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.260
 In 1980 he years the two figures in red 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.150
 and yellow are of course not in this one 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.040
 set included now I want you the 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.620
 show first construction phase these sets 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.450
 that is a small platform 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.550
 that's the green here 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.340
 transparent round flow to the 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:01.020
 corners and two yellow barrels and 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.720
 next to that we already see that is 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.310
 a robot shields these herbs 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.530
 Tortoise is a surveillance and 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.299
 Survive drone and support the 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.790
 two green astronauts at theirs 

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:13.890
 missions on foreign planets 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.049
 navigation or by one 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.590
 Supersonic can do without them on theirs 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:21.450
 the silver armor bears the armor 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.580
 turtle on the back wearing that is 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.340
 a very rare element that know 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.650
 but some of you for sure from vw t1 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.740
 camping bus of it is the hubcaps 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:35.340
 Now we come to the exit here 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:37.890
 we are the good piece with a height of 22 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.690
 centimeters with antenna and 17 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.470
 centimeters without antenna 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:46.500
 He has a total arm spread 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:49.350
 27 cm of extrusion or even that 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.240
 is exoskeleton in this case here a 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.860
 mechanical maintenance unit the whole 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.170
 is not for the war and the fight 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.450
 constructed but just serves 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.060
 as mechanical support for the 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.940
 human body, so to speak an outside 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.980
 skeleton to lift eg heavy loads 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.950
 which a single person never master 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.750
 Could this exoskeleton already exist in it 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.210
 to watch a number of films including the 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:15.090
 suit of ironman's another art 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:16.710
 exclusive because he supports the carrier 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.560
 just like this boy is there 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:22.890
 much more compact or in the movie 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:25.080
 alien there she was even in a yellow xto 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.720
 to see the conclusion in which they are 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.230
 defend against each other on the alien 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.960
 could 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:33.240
 At the bottom of the exile we find another 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:35.640
 printed tile this also quite rare 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:38.850
 and so far is only in two teams 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:41.010
 appeared more rare parts are 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:43.980
 the large light gray slices of the 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:46.260
 Exot, so to speak on the thigh has this 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:51.120
 There was only the ultimate collectors 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:53.280
 r2d2 the a 10 25 the beautiful thing about this 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.190
 model it is is incredibly flexible 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.260
 There are several ball joints themselves 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.600
 hands you can turn and every finger 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.640
 You can move the figure in one by one 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.620
 every position brings you how you do it 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.090
 would like to 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.920
 the model has it all over 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.050
 beautiful details but unfortunately 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.600
 also very filigree and especially at 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:14.000
 Adjust the figure and position 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.560
 can easily go off 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.840
 therefore I would say to play 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.910
 the model rather unsuitable there 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.640
 of course assembly has huge fun 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.590
 made and on a space diorama 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.310
 it is certainly a wonderful 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.780
 eye-catcher 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.790
 Now I want to show you again 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.980
 How the hands grab an object 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.520
 here for example with one of the yellow ones 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:35.370
 barrels 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.500
 now it looks a bit awkward 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.940
 but that's no problem because 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.010
 Now let's just position those 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.580
 figure some new fruit there is already 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:45.259
 happened as I have said it before us 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.930
 solve the small but fine 

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:50.720
 details often times when implementing the 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:52.219
 figurine whether or when playing but with lego 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.509
 Of course this is not a problem the whole 

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:56.120
 will be put together again and 

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:58.580
 ratzfatzi the whole right again 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.620
 tip off if now ours 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.270
 astronautin his exotic something else 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.520
 support then needs help 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:08.569
 example our friend iron builds from the 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:10.879
 lego movie set 70 807 because that is 

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:13.580
 almost as tall as the colleague in 

00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:16.610
 his suit now here again all 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:18.500
 complete the parts of the set when collecting 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:20.090
 I am information about this set 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:22.520
 again on the lego book 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:25.460
 pushed and it is when leafing through 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:28.669
 me in the last pages in the eye 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:32.210
 fallen here on page 1 195 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:34.819
 you can see him immediately the exit suit that 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:36.740
 is there the first original draft the 

00:05:34.819 --> 00:05:39.919
 my book is already out of the 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:41.569
 year 2010 2014 grave sartres set on the 

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:44.830
 market but the design comes from 

00:05:41.569 --> 00:05:47.300
 most likely from october 2008 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:49.370
 after the set at lego kusel now 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:51.949
 means levi us was published 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:53.750
 was then diligently matched by the 

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:55.940
 fans that of course has 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:56.900
 is produced as it is here in me 

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:58.879
 to hold hands 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:01.159
 Now we come to the construction manual 

00:05:58.879 --> 00:06:02.690
 Here again is a part coach and 

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:04.009
 in the construction manual at first 

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:06.770
 pages we will learn a short 

00:06:04.009 --> 00:06:08.449
 story about this set for here 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:10.039
 is it about peet and eve im 

00:06:08.449 --> 00:06:11.690
 Space travel along with 

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:13.719
 your robot turtle around you 

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:16.219
 mysterious signal to follow 

00:06:13.719 --> 00:06:18.800
 the signal then leads you to one 

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:21.349
 actually find lifeless planets there 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:24.050
 she forgot a forty years 

00:06:21.349 --> 00:06:25.759
 cargo spacecraft of classical space 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:28.310
 astronauts and the rest 

00:06:25.759 --> 00:06:30.770
 Browse this spaceship find 

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:32.810
 They dozens of these extrusions them 

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:35.360
 of course could use wonderfully 

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:36.830
 so of course, the bridge became wonderful 

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:39.620
 beaten to the classic 

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:42.469
 space heroes of lego from the late 

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:44.629
 70s and 80s the 

00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:46.909
 space adventures have always been one 

00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:49.069
 popular theme at lego already 

00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:51.680
 starting with the classic series 

00:06:49.069 --> 00:06:54.020
 then the futures came the black trond the 

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:56.940
 m then dreams of a reissue of 

00:06:54.020 --> 00:07:00.960
 plektron then the space sweater 

00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:03.500
 or the uni trance still smells 

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:06.180
 driving your monorail through space 

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:10.020
 The latest space heroes were then 

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:13.080
 the galaxy squad out in 2013 the 

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:15.870
 with futuristic weapons brave against 

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:17.190
 nasty outer space beetles have been fighting here 

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:19.530
 we now have more parts 

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:21.420
 list as mentioned before is the whole 

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:23.280
 from lego ii diaz and there are still here 

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:24.930
 some information on the whole 

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:26.760
 Thank you for the 

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:30.770
 attention and hope you have time 

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:30.770
 back here at Briggs watchers
