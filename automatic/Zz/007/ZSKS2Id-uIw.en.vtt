into iOS 6 which is now starting to show

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.550 
into iOS 6 which is now starting to show

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
taller so they started diving into iOS 6

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.959 
taller so they started diving into iOS 6
and<00:00:30.960> found<00:00:31.109> that<00:00:31.199> when<00:00:31.710> we<00:00:31.830> use<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.550> iOS

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
and found that when we use the the iOS

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.610 
and found that when we use the the iOS
simulator<00:00:33.270> which<00:00:33.660> developers<00:00:34.110> use<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.440> test

out<00:00:34.770> applications<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:35.460> make<00:00:35.579> sure<00:00:35.700> to<00:00:35.790> run

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
out applications to make sure to run

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.610 
out applications to make sure to run
correctly<00:00:36.270> on<00:00:36.540> their<00:00:36.660> phone<00:00:36.870> as<00:00:37.290> far<00:00:37.469> as<00:00:37.559> the

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.389 
anyway when you run it at 640 x 1136
you're<00:00:42.390> able<00:00:42.719> to<00:00:42.840> properly<00:00:43.290> get<00:00:43.590> five<00:00:43.920> rolls

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
you're able to properly get five rolls

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.119 
you're able to properly get five rolls

iPhone simulator on the iOS simulator

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.069 
iPhone simulator on the iOS simulator
there<00:00:49.289> now<00:00:49.620> we<00:00:49.710> running<00:00:50.100> iOS<00:00:50.399> 5.1<00:00:51.120> you<00:00:51.750> put

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
there now we running iOS 5.1 you put

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.510 
there now we running iOS 5.1 you put
bump<00:00:52.289> it<00:00:52.379> up<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:52.500> that<00:00:52.710> same<00:00:52.890> resolution<00:00:53.190> that

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
bump it up to that same resolution that

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.760 
bump it up to that same resolution that
still<00:00:53.699> doesn't<00:00:53.940> correctly<00:00:54.390> show<00:00:54.660> five<00:00:55.469> rows

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
still doesn't correctly show five rows

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.740 
still doesn't correctly show five rows
axillary<00:00:56.129> shows<00:00:56.370> four<00:00:56.699> rolls<00:00:57.059> of<00:00:57.210> application

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
axillary shows four rolls of application

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.299 
axillary shows four rolls of application
that<00:00:57.870> you<00:00:57.960> can<00:00:58.079> have<00:00:58.230> on<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.440> home<00:00:58.559> screen<00:00:58.739> now

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
that you can have on the home screen now

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.500 
that you can have on the home screen now
so<00:00:59.550> what<00:00:59.670> this<00:00:59.760> means<00:00:59.969> is<00:01:00.030> that<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.300> next

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
so what this means is that the next

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.420 
so what this means is that the next
iPhone<00:01:00.629> going<00:01:01.379> all<00:01:01.530> these<00:01:01.739> Hardware<00:01:02.100> rumors

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
iPhone going all these Hardware rumors

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.979 
iPhone going all these Hardware rumors
looks<00:01:02.670> like<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.879> software<00:01:03.300> and<00:01:03.329> iOS<00:01:03.690> 6<00:01:03.899> is

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
looks like the software and iOS 6 is

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.870 
looks like the software and iOS 6 is
going<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.199> be<00:01:04.290> aware<00:01:04.680> of<00:01:04.739> a<00:01:04.979> taller<00:01:05.280> iphone

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
going to be aware of a taller iphone

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.160 
going to be aware of a taller iphone
screen<00:01:06.210> so<00:01:06.600> what<00:01:06.720> does<00:01:06.780> this<00:01:06.869> mean<00:01:07.020> for

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
going to be taking too much of the

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.179 
going to be taking too much of the
action<00:01:22.140> they'll<00:01:22.409> be<00:01:22.500> able<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.680> push<00:01:22.860> those<00:01:23.009> to

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
action they'll be able to push those to

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.920 
action they'll be able to push those to
the<00:01:23.280> side<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:23.759> you<00:01:24.000> still<00:01:24.180> be<00:01:24.299> able<00:01:24.390> to<00:01:24.479> see<00:01:24.689> as

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
the side and you still be able to see as

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.179 
the side and you still be able to see as
much<00:01:25.259> as<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.470> action<00:01:25.740> as<00:01:25.830> you<00:01:25.920> can<00:01:26.070> without

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
much as the action as you can without

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.649 
much as the action as you can without
your<00:01:26.460> fingers<00:01:26.729> blocking<00:01:27.119> it<00:01:27.240> so<00:01:27.479> that's<00:01:27.630> just

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
your fingers blocking it so that's just

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.539 
your fingers blocking it so that's just
another<00:01:27.810> example<00:01:28.259> but<00:01:28.680> i<00:01:28.740> think<00:01:28.950> that<00:01:28.979> Apple

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
another example but i think that Apple

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:30.830 
another example but i think that Apple
is<00:01:29.579> going<00:01:29.640> to<00:01:29.790> also<00:01:29.909> be<00:01:30.119> taking<00:01:30.360> advantage<00:01:30.689> of

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
is going to also be taking advantage of

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.300 
is going to also be taking advantage of
this<00:01:31.170> extra<00:01:31.500> screen<00:01:31.710> real<00:01:31.740> estate<00:01:31.920> with

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
this extra screen real estate with

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.260 
this extra screen real estate with
whatever<00:01:32.549> they're<00:01:32.759> going<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:32.939> be<00:01:33.000> putting

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
whatever they're going to be putting

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.730 
whatever they're going to be putting
else<00:01:33.450> something<00:01:33.930> extra<00:01:34.350> hopefully<00:01:34.590> they<00:01:34.680> be

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
else something extra hopefully they be

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.140 
else something extra hopefully they be
putting<00:01:35.009> in<00:01:35.070> iOS<00:01:35.340> 6<00:01:35.549> to<00:01:35.640> make<00:01:35.759> it<00:01:35.850> a<00:01:35.880> little<00:01:35.970> bit

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150
