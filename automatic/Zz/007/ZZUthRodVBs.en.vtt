00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.980
 first congratulations and 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.840
 You look back on that first victory 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.280
 is it so important to you or 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:19.510
 have we made it all my size and 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.800
 it was near days though I'll give up 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.529
 it will be a sure thing for sure 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.369
 in the media in the outside world 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:26.020
 and it was very important to us 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:27.009
 to grab three points in order to 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.930
 to connect with it 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:31.660
 left row and we have done that now 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:34.390
 so in that respect it is no item with 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:36.130
 in terms of victories and now everything again 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.930
 focused on the coming Friday 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.850
 looking ahead to the next game 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.500
 you know the opponent I assume 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.320
 nsr and what else do you know about that 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.240
 plow well at the moment they are standing 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.520
 win at the bottom but last weekend 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:50.430
 she just with three two from hz 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.840
 surprise but well deserved according to me 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.310
 but okay 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.970
 this year they are only 2 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:01:00.010
 had a victory but also was 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.150
 very many draws a number of 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.590
 last minute matches 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.700
 so what had that 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.199
 regards high can be the 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:08.560
 rankings you are to fight her 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:10.600
 due form certifying that is well 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.679
 lately due form I on 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.060
 understood of course a frieze 

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:15.909
 had camps with him making the 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.289
 yes then you have to come back but 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:19.420
 after that actually quite quickly though 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:20.560
 resumed at level and 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.119
 and as a team we are a little better there 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.460
 personally spin bullet in my level 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:25.990
 so I hope to hold on 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.280
 well then the rumors go to i know 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.319
 probably didn't want it 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.429
 but it is true that there are rumors 

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:32.439
 does indicate that you are in 

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:34.090
 yes a bit of an image that must be 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:35.350
 feel good 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.450
 yes no a lot is spoken and 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.880
 hope is said to be a lot of interest 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.380
 abroad only as long as not 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.639
 specific or not known to the club 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.630
 is made or becomes known to me 

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:44.770
 made then I can't really do it so much 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.729
 many join in 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.709
 then I try as much as possible there 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:50.850
 to close and just get full full on the 

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:53.229
 focus on utrecht returning to nec 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.789
 which players you can be there now are one 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:56.439
 bit dangerous who are you watching 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:58.450
 to hold 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:00.490
 oh yeah well i know a lot in itself 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.409
 selection is a natural daan 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.549
 Bovenberg plays former player of it 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:04.370
 utrecht 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:06.160
 yes they have 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:08.180
 had a lot of young ones from abroad 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.220
 young boy see last match 

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:12.050
 that yes they pronounce name so difficult 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.740
 but jan at bachchan something like that i want it 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:17.810
 and they have a long striker that I do 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.030
 here i believed then six made one 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.280
 so there are some dangerous players 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.440
 it has some seated at the beginning and 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.420
 season and let 's hope we do 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.970
 just doing sin makes the three points 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.710
 the gal hard because last year you know 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.110
 how that went 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:36.140
 the week still very well yes after being lost 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.860
 No 2063 and it was just back as well 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.660
 her 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.320
 signed off if we don't agree 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.430
 bring we played is even very moderate 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.710
 and she went here with the 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.640
 earned point home and that was already 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:50.150
 the last 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:52.040
 home defeat so far inquire the 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.330
 everyone a prediction and position and 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.940
 they go or score 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.410
 worrying though parents and let's tunnel 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.510
 just two then score the 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:02.270
 then I am very satisfied and then push who 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:05.350
 Steve Steve a goaltje and after he and 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:05.350
 Jon Snow I want to give do
