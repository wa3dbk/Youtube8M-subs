00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
to drive the story along maybe they

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.549 
to drive the story along maybe they
almost<00:00:55.460> break<00:00:55.879> up<00:00:56.090> at<00:00:56.359> one<00:00:56.510> point<00:00:56.719> there's<00:00:57.500> a

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:57.559 
almost break up at one point there's a

00:00:57.559 --> 00:00:59.439 
almost break up at one point there's a
bit<00:00:57.710> in<00:00:57.739> the<00:00:57.890> middle<00:00:58.010> where<00:00:58.399> she<00:00:59.030> moves<00:00:59.269> out

00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449 
bit in the middle where she moves out

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:01.209 
bit in the middle where she moves out
April<00:00:59.870> moves<00:01:00.050> a<00:01:00.230> lot<00:01:00.469> awkward<00:01:00.920> and<00:01:01.039> they<00:01:01.129> have

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:01.219 
April moves a lot awkward and they have

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:04.509 
April moves a lot awkward and they have
arguments<00:01:01.579> and<00:01:02.030> things<00:01:02.839> like<00:01:02.989> that<00:01:03.050> and<00:01:03.519> but

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
arguments and things like that and but

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.490 
arguments and things like that and but
they<00:01:04.610> but<00:01:04.670> they<00:01:05.030> work<00:01:05.300> it<00:01:05.449> out<00:01:05.570> because<00:01:06.290> they

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
they but they work it out because they

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.410 
they but they work it out because they
were<00:01:06.560> meant<00:01:06.830> to<00:01:06.950> be<00:01:06.980> together<00:01:07.330> something<00:01:08.330> like

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
were meant to be together something like

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.940 
were meant to be together something like
that<00:01:08.450> I<00:01:08.840> think<00:01:10.180> so<00:01:11.180> maybe<00:01:11.420> April<00:01:12.410> leaves<00:01:12.620> John

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
that I think so maybe April leaves John

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.410 
that I think so maybe April leaves John
for<00:01:13.310> someone<00:01:13.970> else<00:01:15.970> you<00:01:16.970> know<00:01:17.060> it's<00:01:17.240> really

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
for someone else you know it's really

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.540 
for someone else you know it's really
sad<00:01:17.720> and<00:01:18.050> it's<00:01:18.230> like<00:01:18.410> they<00:01:18.590> broken<00:01:19.070> as<00:01:19.280> his<00:01:19.370> big

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:19.550 
sad and it's like they broken as his big

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.210 
sad and it's like they broken as his big
nasty<00:01:19.820> bring<00:01:20.210> up<00:01:20.450> he<00:01:21.050> learns<00:01:21.260> to<00:01:21.470> he<00:01:21.890> learns<00:01:22.100> to

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
like they're coming you being this start

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.360 
like they're coming you being this start
off<00:01:26.480> together<00:01:26.660> and<00:01:26.990> then<00:01:27.110> they<00:01:27.290> go<00:01:27.410> apart<00:01:27.980> but

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:28.370 
off together and then they go apart but

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:31.330 
off together and then they go apart but
it's<00:01:28.640> that<00:01:28.930> journey<00:01:29.930> you<00:01:30.770> follow<00:01:31.040> them<00:01:31.220> on

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
it's that journey you follow them on

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.210 
it's that journey you follow them on
that<00:01:31.490> journey<00:01:31.760> in<00:01:32.030> it<00:01:32.150> what<00:01:33.050> if<00:01:33.200> April<00:01:33.830> leaves

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
that journey in it what if April leaves

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.330 
that journey in it what if April leaves
John<00:01:34.550> for<00:01:35.000> his<00:01:35.090> identical<00:01:35.510> twin<00:01:36.280> okay<00:01:37.280> so

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
John for his identical twin okay so

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.520 
John for his identical twin okay so
that's<00:01:37.610> not<00:01:37.760> right<00:01:37.910> it<00:01:38.180> needs<00:01:38.360> to<00:01:38.510> be<00:01:38.660> more<00:01:39.050> so

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
that's not right it needs to be more so

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.020 
that's not right it needs to be more so
I<00:01:39.800> think<00:01:41.200> so<00:01:42.200> maybe<00:01:43.160> he<00:01:43.460> has<00:01:43.670> a<00:01:43.700> terminal

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
I think so maybe he has a terminal

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.450 
I think so maybe he has a terminal
illness<00:01:44.240> and<00:01:44.930> she<00:01:45.290> so<00:01:45.680> she's<00:01:45.920> left<00:01:46.130> him<00:01:46.340> and

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
illness and she so she's left him and

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.300 
illness and she so she's left him and
she<00:01:46.580> comes<00:01:46.760> back<00:01:47.030> to<00:01:47.930> look<00:01:48.050> after<00:01:48.200> him<00:01:48.500> and<00:01:48.710> and

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
she comes back to look after him and and

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:50.710 
she comes back to look after him and and
and<00:01:49.700> help<00:01:49.940> him<00:01:50.060> through<00:01:50.210> his<00:01:50.330> terminal

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
and help him through his terminal

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.330 
and help him through his terminal
illness<00:01:50.960> and<00:01:51.110> then<00:01:51.200> he<00:01:51.320> like<00:01:51.470> he<00:01:51.890> dies<00:01:52.100> all

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
illness and then he like he dies all

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:53.980 
illness and then he like he dies all
over<00:01:52.550> at<00:01:52.670> the<00:01:52.760> end<00:01:52.880> and<00:01:53.060> he's<00:01:53.300> sad<00:01:53.540> but<00:01:53.840> you

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
over at the end and he's sad but you

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:59.650 
over at the end and he's sad but you
know<00:01:55.570> you<00:01:56.570> know<00:01:57.910> okay<00:01:58.910> so<00:01:59.180> what<00:01:59.330> if<00:01:59.420> jon<00:01:59.630> was

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
this parallel between them I think that

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.170 
this parallel between them I think that
would<00:02:38.870> work<00:02:38.900> I<00:02:39.350> know<00:02:40.070> I've<00:02:40.400> got<00:02:40.640> it<00:02:40.790> the

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
would work I know I've got it the

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.000 
would work I know I've got it the
identical<00:02:41.570> twin<00:02:41.810> was<00:02:42.020> actually<00:02:42.350> their<00:02:42.650> son

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010

identical twin was actually their son
from<00:02:43.459> the<00:02:43.610> future<00:02:44.060> so<00:02:44.840> when<00:02:45.650> April<00:02:46.160> leaves

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
from the future so when April leaves

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.540 
from the future so when April leaves
John<00:02:46.790> for<00:02:47.300> the<00:02:47.989> Dada<00:02:48.319> no<00:02:48.830> because<00:02:49.069> then<00:02:49.280> she'd

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
John for the Dada no because then she'd

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:53.350 
John for the Dada no because then she'd
be<00:02:49.670> sleeping<00:02:50.000> with<00:02:50.090> her<00:02:50.209> son<00:02:52.090> that<00:02:53.090> doesn't

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
be sleeping with her son that doesn't

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:59.590 
be sleeping with her son that doesn't
work<00:02:54.070> ahmad<00:02:55.540> okay<00:02:56.540> so<00:02:57.400> what<00:02:58.400> if<00:02:58.550> the<00:02:59.120> identical

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600

there's just like flashback bit at the

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.670 
there's just like flashback bit at the
end<00:03:08.090> where<00:03:08.510> April<00:03:08.750> realizes<00:03:09.350> that<00:03:09.380> they're

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
end where April realizes that they're

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
cool ways that he tricked her into

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:14.530 
cool ways that he tricked her into
thinking<00:03:13.640> that<00:03:13.850> they<00:03:14.060> would<00:03:14.180> differ<00:03:14.360> two

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
thinking that they would differ two

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:15.759 
thinking that they would differ two
different<00:03:14.840> people<00:03:15.140> when<00:03:15.320> actually<00:03:15.620> they<00:03:15.739> were

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:15.769
