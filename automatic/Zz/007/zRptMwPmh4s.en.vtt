00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:13.360
 sweeping on youtube to start I have

 that we explain to everyone how their

00:00:36.909 --> 00:00:40.960
 oven and that everything can be done in 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.579
 minutes which is great my mom 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.289
 I made cookies without an oven all the time 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:46.300
 when the girl and I started doing them 

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:48.069
 with healthy substitutes and approve 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.379
 new tasty recipes for breakfast 

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:52.989
 and I realized how easy it was to do 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:55.479
 healthy and delicious meals too 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:57.249
 because you follow so many good women 

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:58.989
 my recipes are simple and easy to 

00:00:57.249 --> 00:01:02.350
 continue and I'm taking pictures of the process 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:04.150
 to see how it looks recipe while 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.799
 I'm doing I share my tests of 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.260
 trial and error so that they avoid committing 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:09.820
 the same mistakes you spoke of your mother 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.100
 and of these meals 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:15.340
 have you eaten healthy, not for 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.690
 nothing when I got married nine years ago the 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.780
 truth is that I could barely cook 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.340
 thinking and toasted cheese and then 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.320
 I started to experiment at home doing 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.260
 healthier versions 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.910
 of the dishes that we all love and I gave 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.890
 I realized how easy it was and I put them 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:32.350
 online to share with my friends 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:35.140
 and it has grown a lot if I can do it 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:37.420
 I say the kitchen and this blog are just my 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.950
 hobbies if I can do all the 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.540
 others also without knowing 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.280
 curious to see this approach without 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.200
 oven let's start with the bowl of 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.780
 breakfast with strawberries in the microwave not 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.430
 this is one of my favorite breakfasts 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.410
 because it 's different from a normal pot of 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.050
 oatmeal but it takes less time in fact 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:54.940
 we have oat bran all are 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.700
 healthy ingredients and flour 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.380
 oats and ground flax seeds that I know 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.899
 which is one of your favorites also a 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.090
 little cinnamon hooker ok goes way of 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:05.740
 bake and a pinch of salt just one 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.200
 whit a city that and then the 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:11.400
 wet we have a little vanilla and 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:13.990
 unsweetened applesauce 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.280
 I have almond milk but you 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.800
 They can use any milk that they 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.180
 like today we are using strawberries but 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.190
 can use the fruit they like and that 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.200
 have in the refrigerator so you're 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.420
 according to exactly and only 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.760
 they mix all this together then they take a 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.220
 suitable container a cup of coffee and you 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.900
 spray with nonstick spray is what 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.760
 dumps there and takes it to the microwave 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.100
 for a minute and a half and something comes out 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:41.100
 as this is all is all in one 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:41.100
 minute and a half I would not like to try it 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.620
 it's not well done it's very good and 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.720
 It can also be done in less than one 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.670
 minute and a half okay 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:57.239
 before we continue we have to count the 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.799
 calories that are 225 I think that 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:01.110
 for a breakfast dish is a very 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:03.450
 good amount of calories with 12 grams 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.910
 fat was pointed out by all this stuff 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.769
 what I'm talking about today takes very little 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.049
 time to do it but it's also done 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:11.760
 with healthy ingredients so the 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:13.379
 12 grams of fat can look a lot like 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.970
 especially for some but they have 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:16.319
 almond milk flax seeds 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.120
 healthy sources of fat that the 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:21.090
 body needs exactly so that fat 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.640
 happens to me then then we have 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.049
 a recipe without a main dish oven 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.730
 so this is one of my things 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:29.040
 favorite to do at home we are going to 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.750
 make this risotto in the microwave to 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.090
 start but instead of using rice let's 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.099
 to use oatmeal so you still have this 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.900
 creamy texture but on the one hand is 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:38.400
 gluten free and on the other you can 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.530
 do in the microwave because it takes less 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.510
 cooking time so we have a 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.569
 cup of quick-cooking oatmeal or some 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.879
 Similary 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:49.219
 two cups of low-sodium broth that 

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:50.599
 can be vegetable or chicken and that 

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:52.639
 cook in the microwave for two 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:54.189
 minutes for the oatmeal to cook and 

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:56.329
 when we take them out you can mix 

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:57.950
 frozen peas or any other 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:59.540
 kind of legumes that want one of my 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.069
 favorite ingredients is to use cheese 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.840
 low fat cream 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:04.939
 milena in the creaminess is without adding 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.159
 a lot of fat you can replace it with 

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:09.680
 yogurt if you want yes exact but if it is 

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:11.840
 with yogurt I would put it in the end that 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.669
 mix well is cooked for two minutes 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.980
 so that the oatmeal is finished cooking 

00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:17.599
 and then add some salt and pepper 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.060
 or the seasoning when you say cook it 

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:21.530
 put in the microwave and accurate so 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.930
 you have to make sure you have a pot 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:25.370
 deep because this is going to cook and 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.650
 then it is done in the microwave 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.509
 it takes about 45 minutes in total and you 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.400
 you can add some pre-cooked chicken and 

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:33.530
 so you have a main course in 5 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.389
 minutes and as a working mother you can 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:36.949
 Doing this when you return does not require 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:38.630
 a lot of preparation act all have 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:40.430
 oatmeal usually and some kind of 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:42.710
 vegetable in the refrigerator or peas 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:44.900
 frozen and the table is very easy 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:49.030
 in about 10 minutes before counting the 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:49.030
 calories let's try it here 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:55.960
 good thing this is what happens 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:58.330
 well now 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:00.000
 for the risotto without rice in turned out without 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:03.370
 rice that was our main dish 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.590
 280 calories are 5 and a half grams of 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:07.690
 fat which means that you're going to 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:09.729
 disappear if you keep losing so much 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:11.680
 think about the last healthy recipe without 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:14.080
 oven is a dessert because of this I think that 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.660
 So many women follow you as they do 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.830
 Greek cheese sandwiches these this 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:19.960
 It's one of my dessert recipes 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.870
 favorite are so easy are snacks 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.280
 of Greek cheese and yogurt 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:25.320
 everyone wants some chocolate dessert 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.880
 quick and easy and sometimes you want something 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.920
 with dark chocolate but make it a 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:30.660
 little more than a piece so these 

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:33.150
 dark chocolate scattered inside the 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:34.650
 containers for cupcakes and are left in 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.480
 the refrigerator for a couple of 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:39.360
 minutes to harden again 

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:42.180
 and then we take this cream cheese low in 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.890
 fats and a little icing sugar and the 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:46.680
 we mix with one of my favorites that 

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:49.710
 is the Greek yogurt mixes together and 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:51.720
 this is the filling I require yogurt to me 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:53.700
 I like the orange sets so 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:55.740
 let's use a bit of that too but 

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:57.900
 can oppose using lemon or 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:01.320
 any other flavor mixes everything 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:03.090
 together and it is very thick almost like the 

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:06.840
 mix with cheesecake and then we put it 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:08.760
 with a spoon inside these bowls 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:12.810
 of chocolate 

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:16.890
 a bit like that and there you have them 

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:19.530
 leave them at least cheesecake bad 

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:21.390
 or chocolate base can be added 

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:23.130
 more chocolate above to put some 

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:24.750
 minutes in the refrigerator and when 

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:27.420
 are ready to serve your stack on 

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:29.970
 paper for cupcakes and they remain as 

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:32.550
 these are snacks filled with 

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:34.280
 cheese and yogurt and you take these ideas not what 

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:37.220
 he 

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:40.130
 they're really I do not know especially because 

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:42.380
 I started cooking only nine years ago and 

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:44.419
 my husband gives me ideas I see things out there 

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:46.430
 and I think I could do them more 

00:06:44.419 --> 00:06:48.350
 healthy or what could you put another 

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:50.300
 stuffing or something like that that's a great model 

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:51.800
 to follow they could copy this and create their 

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:53.780
 ideas but let's go to the account of 

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:58.669
 calories for these cheese sandwiches 

00:06:53.780 --> 00:07:01.150
 and Greek yogurt 145 calories and 7.5 grams 

00:06:58.669 --> 00:07:03.710
 of fat before we get to celebrate 

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:07.270
 we have to see if people like it 

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:07.270
 they want to try some 

00:07:08.169 --> 00:07:13.790

 you too and while I'm going to take a 

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:21.760
 hole and then with something else we're going to 

00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:21.760
 judge together 

00:07:22.949 --> 00:07:27.990
 branding these are the best are very
