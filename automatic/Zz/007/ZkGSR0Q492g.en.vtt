00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:09.180
 hi everyone this is android 500 whether dads 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.550
 updated green robot into stuff 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.800
 lolly pop design is brand new 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.900
 approach to appearance is beautiful 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.640
 android and even very first of all 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.619
 all standard icons have been updated 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.990
 applications they are addressed in a single 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.029
 moonshine style instead of the usual buttons 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.400
 controls now on and the simplest 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.710
 geometric shapes triangle circle and 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.470
 square versus android l 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.420
 they got a little smaller and more beautiful in 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.660
 status bar, too, all the icons are new and 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.410
 a bunch of right ones appeared super-simple 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.230
 animations 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.329
 up to which everything looks very cool 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.800
 standard applications got new 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.660
 design and new icons 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.309
 changed lockscreen now to 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.620
 open the camera you need to hold on the right 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.020
 to the left and to open the phone on the left 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.420
 right to unlock the phone you need 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.760
 just pull up the curtain of notifications 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.539
 now looks like this if you pull it down 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.850
 again 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.829
 the quick settings panel will open and in 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.750
 Compared with android l appeared here 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.240
 one cool thing namely icon 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.009
 flashlight is very useful themselves 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.679
 notifications can now be customized 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:12.990
 we clamp any application we press here 

00:01:10.679 --> 00:01:15.060
 here three points do not show at all 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.579
 notifications show priority 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.289
 confidentiality is important not to show 

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:22.020
 notifications on the lock screen 

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:23.490
 go nowhere and the clear button is on 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.799
 location desk 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.829
 the concept remains the same as in android 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:31.349
 4 4 left google now by the way now also in 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.929
 material on the right new work tables and 

00:01:31.349 --> 00:01:36.749
 menu of all applications looks like white 

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:38.399
 the substrate and has a cool animation this 

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:40.349
 now generally it can be considered a folder 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:42.209
 it looks like the menu in principle 

00:01:40.349 --> 00:01:43.079
 desktop settings left so 

00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:45.630
 same as in kitkat 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:48.149
 but we have a new multitasking menu 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.829
 seen in android l here it is the same but 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.079
 finally realized one cool 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:54.509
 opportunity for chrome all tabs 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.649
 are now in multitasking as 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.719
 individual applications 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.489
 but if someone doesnâ€™t like it 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.039
 return to the usual tabs in the settings 

00:01:59.489 --> 00:02:04.109
 chrome here and there is such a thing as 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:06.029
 pin you can click on it if 

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:07.590
 someone passed the phone a person can 

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:09.330
 be only in that application on 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.610
 which was installed this pin 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.440
 to get out we pin a triangle and 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.210
 square and get on lokskrin 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.860
 Already with the password it is convenient at 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.120
 initial phone setup 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.640
 2 new ones appeared 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.870
 very cool chips first this 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.210
 restore phone from another 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.090
 working phone is enough to connect 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:28.050
 their nfc 2 is also recovery from 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.000
 backup copy 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.950
 but from the cloud of any of your android 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.050
 devices and when you recover 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.850
 you can choose which applications to download 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.100
 which is not and when the phone is already 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.470
 restored immediately to the desktop 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.950
 a picture appears with ending a 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.800
 by me 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.840
 something like we saw you one more 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.730
 good news in phones on android 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.010
 Now there is a multi user Nastya she 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.780
 competent to change users as 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.450
 gloves can be from the center of fast 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.010
 the settings are cool and useful even 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.140
 in the phone go further 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.000
 headzap notifications when you arrive 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.530
 the alarm clock is ringing 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.540
 distract from the application in 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.640
 which you can sit and any other 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.270
 open comfortably very comfortable in 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.550
 using 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:10.500
 due to the fact that there is a notification now and 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:12.240
 On the lock screen, when setting a password, you can 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.580
 select show notifications on screen 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:17.070
 lock is limited to show or 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.989
 do not show yourself notice 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:21.030
 work in three modes all sounds 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:23.400
 calls from favorites and completely without 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.830
 sound even without an alarm clock in android in no 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.420
 te vi appeared energy saving mode 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.970
 it was developed under the code name 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:32.310
 project volt when the mode is on 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.769
 the phone starts to slow down but well 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.930
 save energy can be done and so 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:38.310
 that it will turn on automatically at 5 or 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.130
 15 percent charge 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:43.140
 android among other chips 50 into a p 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.730
 the form of the only virtual machine gave 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.700
 the century is no more also android 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.950
 supports 64-bit processors exactly 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.470
 same stands in nexus 9 then the players are one 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:55.769

 as well as eat sevan m8 and moto g google 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.549
 play edition 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:08.160
 these devices are the first wave in 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:10.260
 the second wave turned out to be nexus 4 and nexus 7 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.480
 2012 and nexus 10 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.820

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:22.830
 rest 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.389
 many manufacturers 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.009
 promise to update their priorities 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:28.439
 gadgets 3 months after 

00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:31.650
 official release and this is somewhere in January 

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:33.509
 2015, the benefit of motorola has already told 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:35.340
 that its device will be updated on 5 

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:35.789
 android very quickly after a few 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.069
 weeks 

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:40.439
 I just did not have enough Google 

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:42.900
 who would come up said brother do 

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:44.879
 beautifully apparently he appeared and yes now 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:47.250
 the very moment you can say that 

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:49.469
 android has become more beautiful and weight is 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:51.629
 really so but there are those things 

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:53.520
 which is missing in android 50 

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:55.680
 First I would like to see the amount 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:58.080
 notifications on badges as a war with 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:00.060
 I would like to finally hide the labels in 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.159
 application menu as do samsung 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:04.530
 not enough separate adjustment 

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:07.969
