00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
a half inch board now we've made our

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.810 
a half inch board now we've made our
marks<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:58.770> now<00:00:59.100> it's<00:00:59.250> time<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.489> get<00:00:59.699> to

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
marks and now it's time to get to

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.389 
marks and now it's time to get to
cutting<00:01:00.180> but<00:01:00.780> as<00:01:00.930> anything<00:01:01.590> that<00:01:01.620> involves<00:01:02.309> a

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
cutting but as anything that involves a

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:13.690 
cutting but as anything that involves a
saw<00:01:02.640> we<00:01:02.940> need<00:01:03.059> to<00:01:03.149> make<00:01:03.300> sure<00:01:03.409> safety<00:01:04.409> first

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.310 

and<00:01:14.700> as<00:01:14.820> we've<00:01:14.939> got<00:01:15.090> all<00:01:15.210> of<00:01:15.240> our<00:01:15.479> materials

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
and as we've got all of our materials

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.070 
and as we've got all of our materials
cut<00:01:16.560> we're<00:01:16.799> gonna<00:01:16.950> take<00:01:17.100> a<00:01:17.130> look<00:01:17.280> at<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.520> CD

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
cut we're gonna take a look at the CD

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.050 
cut we're gonna take a look at the CD
the<00:01:19.080> CD<00:01:19.259> is<00:01:19.560> actually<00:01:20.100> four<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:20.820> three

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
the CD is actually four and three

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.170 
the CD is actually four and three
quarters<00:01:21.479> by<00:01:21.990> five<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:22.440> a<00:01:22.470> half<00:01:22.530> inches<00:01:22.979> wide

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
quarters by five and a half inches wide

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.680 
quarters by five and a half inches wide
which<00:01:24.590> allows<00:01:25.590> us<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:26.070> fit<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.729> CD<00:01:27.090> directly

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:27.690 
which allows us to fit the CD directly

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.190 
which allows us to fit the CD directly
into<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.200> casing<00:01:28.740> usually<00:01:29.369> now<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.540> few<00:01:30.810> few

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
into the casing usually now a few few

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.330 
into the casing usually now a few few
other<00:01:31.409> measurements<00:01:31.920> you<00:01:31.979> need<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.190> know

other measurements you need to know

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.420 
other measurements you need to know
about<00:01:32.840> the<00:01:33.840> boards<00:01:34.110> are<00:01:34.229> actually<00:01:34.430> three

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
about the boards are actually three

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.870 
about the boards are actually three
quarters<00:01:35.820> of<00:01:35.970> an<00:01:36.060> inch<00:01:36.180> wide<00:01:36.630> and<00:01:37.670> five<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:38.850> a

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
quarters of an inch wide and five and a

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.990 
quarters of an inch wide and five and a
half<00:01:39.030> wide<00:01:39.770> knowing<00:01:40.770> that<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:40.979> board<00:01:41.190> is<00:01:41.490> five

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
half wide knowing that the board is five

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.700 
half wide knowing that the board is five
and<00:01:42.180> a<00:01:42.240> half<00:01:42.270> we're<00:01:42.780> gonna<00:01:42.899> put<00:01:43.110> a<00:01:43.140> mark<00:01:43.440> right

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
and a half we're gonna put a mark right

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.249 
and a half we're gonna put a mark right
in<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:44.039> middle<00:01:44.220> of<00:01:44.460> it<00:01:44.610> at<00:01:45.060> two<00:01:45.929> and<00:01:46.080> three

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
in the middle of it at two and three

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.070 
in the middle of it at two and three
quarters<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:47.610> reason<00:01:47.970> why<00:01:48.300> we're<00:01:48.600> doing<00:01:48.630> this

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 
quarters the reason why we're doing this

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.550 
quarters the reason why we're doing this
is<00:01:49.380> we're<00:01:50.100> going<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.490> notch<00:01:50.819> out<00:01:51.119> a<00:01:51.179> 3/4<00:01:52.020> cut<00:01:52.350> on

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
is we're going to notch out a 3/4 cut on

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.190 
is we're going to notch out a 3/4 cut on
these<00:01:52.710> pieces<00:01:53.009> we're<00:01:53.819> creating<00:01:54.420> a<00:01:54.600> type<00:01:55.170> of

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200
