00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:08.830 
always tried to do something that was

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:12.760 
always tried to do something that was
innovative<00:06:09.830> and<00:06:10.490> so<00:06:11.479> far<00:06:11.840> from<00:06:12.620> the

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:12.770 
innovative and so far from the

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:15.219 
innovative and so far from the
mainstream<00:06:12.979> and<00:06:13.610> that's<00:06:14.419> why<00:06:14.600> he's<00:06:14.750> stuck<00:06:15.020> out

00:06:15.219 --> 00:06:15.229
