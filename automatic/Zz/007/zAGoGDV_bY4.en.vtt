00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.970 

and<00:02:19.000> see<00:02:19.239> I'm<00:02:19.450> already<00:02:20.010> and<00:02:22.470> the<00:02:23.470> multiplier

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
and see I'm already and the multiplier

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:32.880 
and see I'm already and the multiplier
times<00:02:24.280> two

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.280 

it's<00:02:33.490> better<00:02:33.970> if<00:02:34.120> you<00:02:34.240> do<00:02:34.360> it<00:02:34.390> with<00:02:34.660> two<00:02:34.870> people

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
it's better if you do it with two people

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:42.040 
it's better if you do it with two people
since<00:02:35.710> then<00:02:35.920> the<00:02:37.110> possible<00:02:38.110> new<00:02:38.410> york<00:02:38.620> is<00:02:39.010> much

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.610 

Oh

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.520 

by<00:04:08.190> the<00:04:08.250> way<00:04:08.400> if<00:04:08.519> you<00:04:08.640> get<00:04:08.819> down<00:04:09.530> your

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
by the way if you get down your

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.949 
by the way if you get down your
multiplier<00:04:11.370> would<00:04:11.580> start<00:04:11.849> going<00:04:12.420> down<00:04:12.569> slowly

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
multiplier would start going down slowly

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:16.280 
multiplier would start going down slowly
unless<00:04:13.379> you<00:04:13.500> get<00:04:13.620> revived<00:04:13.920> and<00:04:14.959> if<00:04:15.959> you<00:04:16.079> die

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
unless you get revived and if you die

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:20.900 
unless you get revived and if you die
then<00:04:16.919> you'll<00:04:17.699> just<00:04:17.940> lose<00:04:18.630> your<00:04:19.910> multiplying

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
then you'll just lose your multiplying

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.730 
then you'll just lose your multiplying
over<00:04:21.120> to<00:04:21.239> start<00:04:21.540> from<00:04:21.690> one
