aggressive<00:01:43.130> South<00:01:44.130> American<00:01:44.579> cichlids<00:01:45.140> they

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
aggressive South American cichlids they

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.450 
aggressive South American cichlids they
can<00:01:46.380> go<00:01:46.560> through<00:01:46.770> what's<00:01:46.979> called<00:01:47.189> a<00:01:47.250> hyper

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
so these fish always come with a risk

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.490 
so these fish always come with a risk
