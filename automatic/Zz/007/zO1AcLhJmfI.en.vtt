console means that there's probably a
very<00:00:27.340> probably<00:00:27.730> a<00:00:27.820> general<00:00:28.300> hardware<00:00:28.690> failure

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
very probably a general hardware failure

very probably a general hardware failure
it's<00:00:30.160> more<00:00:30.670> severe<00:00:31.030> than<00:00:31.150> one<00:00:31.330> or<00:00:31.480> two<00:00:31.510> lights

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:31.930 
it's more severe than one or two lights

and it's indicative of a few problems
the<00:00:36.040> main<00:00:36.250> problems<00:00:36.670> will<00:00:36.790> be<00:00:37.300> along<00:00:37.840> the

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:37.990 
the main problems will be along the

instance if you're under warranty I

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.020 
instance if you're under warranty I
would<00:00:50.200> definitely<00:00:50.410> send<00:00:51.370> it<00:00:51.520> back<00:00:51.700> to

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
would definitely send it back to

would definitely send it back to
Microsoft<00:00:52.870> to<00:00:53.020> get<00:00:53.170> repaired<00:00:53.700> which<00:00:54.700> will

meantime which which won't void your
warranty<00:01:08.950> is<00:01:09.549> to<00:01:09.870> actually<00:01:10.870> turn<00:01:11.229> it<00:01:11.380> off<00:01:11.500> and

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:11.530 
warranty is to actually turn it off and

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.289 
warranty is to actually turn it off and
let<00:01:12.100> it<00:01:12.130> cool<00:01:12.400> down<00:01:12.460> because<00:01:12.940> it's<00:01:13.030> probably

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:13.299 
let it cool down because it's probably

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:18.300 
let it cool down because it's probably
overheated<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:15.820> also<00:01:16.180> just<00:01:16.390> check<00:01:17.159> check<00:01:18.159> all

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
overheated and also just check check all

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.740 
overheated and also just check check all
the<00:01:18.510> connections<00:01:19.510> of<00:01:20.260> video<00:01:20.799> connections

isn't<00:01:27.510> hasn't<00:01:28.510> fixed<00:01:28.690> it<00:01:28.930> then<00:01:29.220> you've

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
isn't hasn't fixed it then you've

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:31.980 
isn't hasn't fixed it then you've
definitely<00:01:30.460> got<00:01:30.729> a<00:01:30.760> hardware<00:01:31.270> failure<00:01:31.510> where
