beginning<00:00:54.719> you<00:00:55.410> want<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.680> make<00:00:55.800> sure<00:00:55.829> that<00:00:56.129> you

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
beginning you want to make sure that you

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.430 
beginning you want to make sure that you
overlap<00:00:56.789> about<00:00:56.969> half<00:00:57.390> of<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.780> tape<00:00:57.989> so<00:00:58.350> you

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
overlap about half of the tape so you

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.380 
overlap about half of the tape so you
have<00:00:58.590> sufficient<00:00:58.890> tape<00:00:59.489> to<00:00:59.699> stuff<00:00:59.969> in<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.270> end

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
have sufficient tape to stuff in the end

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.779 
have sufficient tape to stuff in the end
of<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.600> bar<00:01:00.780> with<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.440> bar<00:01:01.620> end<00:01:01.829> plug<00:01:02.039> wrap

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
of the bar with the bar end plug wrap

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:12.320 
of the bar with the bar end plug wrap
away<00:01:03.180> from<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.539> bike

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.590 

notice<00:01:13.110> I'm<00:01:13.350> keeping<00:01:14.000> pressure<00:01:15.000> on<00:01:15.300> the<00:01:15.420> tape

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
notice I'm keeping pressure on the tape

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.500 
notice I'm keeping pressure on the tape
so<00:01:15.840> it<00:01:15.930> doesn't<00:01:16.200> want<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.380> unravel<00:01:16.760> and<00:01:17.760> also

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:18.510 
so it doesn't want to unravel and also

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.010 
so it doesn't want to unravel and also
to<00:01:18.980> make<00:01:19.980> sure<00:01:20.010> that<00:01:20.190> you<00:01:20.520> keep<00:01:21.180> even<00:01:21.480> spacing

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
to make sure that you keep even spacing

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:32.679 
to make sure that you keep even spacing
on<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.380> tape

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:32.689 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:34.719 

when<00:01:33.439> wrapping<00:01:33.829> the<00:01:33.920> bar<00:01:34.100> you<00:01:34.340> want<00:01:34.460> to<00:01:34.579> make

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
when wrapping the bar you want to make

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:36.819 
when wrapping the bar you want to make
sure<00:01:34.939> you<00:01:35.060> keep<00:01:35.420> tension<00:01:35.899> on<00:01:36.170> the<00:01:36.229> tape<00:01:36.530> not

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:36.829 
sure you keep tension on the tape not

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:38.709 
sure you keep tension on the tape not
stretching<00:01:37.249> it<00:01:37.520> while<00:01:38.119> holding<00:01:38.450> your<00:01:38.600> thumb

stretching it while holding your thumb

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:57.999 
stretching it while holding your thumb
over<00:01:39.109> so<00:01:39.350> it<00:01:39.409> doesn't<00:01:39.649> want<00:01:39.770> to<00:01:39.890> unravel
