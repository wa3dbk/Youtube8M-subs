that's<00:04:15.570> got<00:04:15.810> the<00:04:15.930> area<00:04:16.260> I<00:04:16.380> think<00:04:16.620> that<00:04:16.800> the<00:04:16.980> the

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
that's got the area I think that the the

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.850 
that's got the area I think that the the
41st<00:04:17.880> elite<00:04:18.300> troop<00:04:18.720> is<00:04:18.989> the<00:04:19.140> only<00:04:19.260> one<00:04:19.440> to<00:04:19.680> have

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:19.860 
41st elite troop is the only one to have

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:28.160

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:30.500 
the aerial on the backpack and this one
I<00:04:28.500> think<00:04:29.160> it<00:04:29.250> is<00:04:29.430> slightly<00:04:29.790> older<00:04:30.240> one<00:04:30.360> I<00:04:30.390> think

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510
