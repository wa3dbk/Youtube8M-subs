00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 hello people in this video you see that 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:12.210
 review of the apple leather kay is for 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:13.590
 the iphone 5 and 5 it has apple on 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.420
 the keynote not only the iphone 5 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.180
 but also presented new cases for 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.500
 the device and a leather case that 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.199
 I have here now in two colors 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.600
 once black once product red here 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.900
 sees the packaging so looks the whole 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.480
 out 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.289
 It will be delivered in a case cost 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.119
 39 euros 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.270
 So it's already a bit steep 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.219
 however, an original apple case and 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.989
 Made of leather The leather feels for me 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.140
 really very very cool 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.370
 if you have the iphone in your hand it 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.010
 really works well it feels 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.149
 wonderful at it you can serve everything 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.039
 what you want to serve you can do 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.350
 unlock buttons work all 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:54.899
 Volume buttons down is everything 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:56.850
 protected and generally it looks easy 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.890
 It's probably great 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.770
 that it has designed apple and it's perfect 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.930
 matched to the iphone is for 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.950
 example here the white iphone will fit 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:11.010
 great for the red apple case we have 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.710
 here a punched out or a one 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.080
 well of the apple logo is at 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.030
 the little bit darker with the black one 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.320
 Model is nothing in there that is 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.159
 it's just that's why you see it 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.490
 probably if I stop like that 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.290
 not at all just deep and 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:30.150
 the black fits the black one 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:33.680
 wonderful if I answer it close 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.680
 upright there must still leather 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.620
 Of course it's perfect for everything 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.700
 cut out like apple just got it 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:47.230
 want everything now accessible 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.060
 You also have a light label design 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:52.060
 you also see forward more easily the 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.460
 Frame from the iphone at the red maybe 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.640
 a little bit better the gold is okay too 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.800
 but not as you can see that is mine 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.370
 old iphone 5 that also went great 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:05.140
 Nothing slips in nothing is nothing 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.490
 the hardware actually look good 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.800
 nothing has changed 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.720
 yes, if we all from the beginning 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.190
 look at the black actually fits 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.620
 I want to say the black best 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.330
 you should go to the white models 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.320
 colored cases look great I think 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.220
 Here's a great pleasure 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:25.840
 combination white iphone red case you 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:27.340
 but from behind cool yes I can 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.190
 Whole recommend only if here 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.960
 Original Apple Case Volt is made of leather 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.990
 a little more expensive you have to think about whether 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:36.550
 you want to spend so much on a case 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:38.440
 I can not fault a case 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.250
 Here you see the red model again 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.720
 from near 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.100
 Of course it's not just in there 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.830
 red and black the whole thing is there too 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:47.290
 still in brown beige yellow and blue 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.810
 what he likes about the product red version 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.780
 horny if you buy the 35 euros 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:55.570
 apple automatically donates ten percent 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.860
 the purchase price to an aids foundation 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.350
 and with that you can do something good 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.310
 then do if the red version buys 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.850
 but you can see the red version very much 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.000
 very cool 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:06.190
 also sees the black version 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.709
 actually both horny as said it 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.570
 are also other colors brown beige blue 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:12.270
 I think that was something else 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:15.190
 other 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:17.140
 yes write the comments 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.030
 which color combination is best for you 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.890
 could still be on the apple side 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.660
 Let's try which iphone on 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.450
 best to which color from the case fits 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.340
 and then I say it was with the 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.650
 Review of the apple leather case for that 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.750

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.489
 watch everyone like me 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.980
 Of course, I am all the more pleased 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:37.630

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.220

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:42.100
