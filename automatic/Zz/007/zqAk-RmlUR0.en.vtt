00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:09.650 
welcome to the c500 and Arri Alexa

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.669 
welcome to the c500 and Arri Alexa
camera<00:00:10.650> shootout<00:00:11.750> this<00:00:12.750> was<00:00:12.960> we're<00:00:13.620> gonna

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
camera shootout this was we're gonna

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.730 
camera shootout this was we're gonna
start<00:00:14.040> with<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.219> area<00:00:14.519> Alexa<00:00:14.969> at<00:00:15.330> 5600<00:00:16.199> ISO

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
start with the area Alexa at 5600 ISO

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.109 
start with the area Alexa at 5600 ISO
200<00:00:17.520> I<00:00:17.730> like<00:00:18.570> to<00:00:18.750> do<00:00:18.960> is<00:00:19.529> Oh<00:00:19.980> tests<00:00:20.490> in<00:00:20.640> the<00:00:20.880> day

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
200 I like to do is Oh tests in the day

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.390 
200 I like to do is Oh tests in the day
as<00:00:21.449> well<00:00:21.960> as<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:22.199> night<00:00:22.760> but<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:23.939> day<00:00:24.210> tend<00:00:24.960> to

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:25.400 
as well as the night but the day tend to

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.460 
as well as the night but the day tend to
show<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.539> noise<00:00:27.750> a<00:00:27.810> little<00:00:28.170> better

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
show the the noise a little better

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.120 
show the the noise a little better
because<00:00:28.949> at<00:00:29.279> night<00:00:29.519> of<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.510> blackness<00:00:31.130> is

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
because at night of the blackness is

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.299 
because at night of the blackness is
able<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:32.730> hide<00:00:33.210> and<00:00:33.570> mask<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.530> noise<00:00:34.559> levels

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
able to hide and mask the noise levels

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.540 
able to hide and mask the noise levels
so<00:00:35.940> I<00:00:36.270> want<00:00:36.510> to<00:00:36.540> just<00:00:36.840> really<00:00:37.380> kind<00:00:37.649> of<00:00:37.800> look<00:00:38.309> at

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
so I want to just really kind of look at

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.340 
so I want to just really kind of look at
each<00:00:38.879> one<00:00:38.940> of<00:00:39.329> these<00:00:39.660> is<00:00:40.050> OS<00:00:40.469> to<00:00:41.030> analyze<00:00:42.350> when

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
each one of these is OS to analyze when

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.790 
each one of these is OS to analyze when
the<00:00:43.559> noise<00:00:43.770> starts<00:00:44.700> to<00:00:44.940> become<00:00:45.800> fairly

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
the noise starts to become fairly

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.319 
the noise starts to become fairly
apparent<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:47.489> if<00:00:48.329> as<00:00:48.780> we<00:00:49.260> crank<00:00:49.860> up<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.760> ISO

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
apparent and if as we crank up the ISO

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.720 
apparent and if as we crank up the ISO
where<00:00:51.989> it<00:00:52.170> tends<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.649> get<00:00:53.280> a<00:00:53.340> little<00:00:53.520> more

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
where it tends to get a little more

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.389 
where it tends to get a little more
contrast<00:00:54.329> here<00:00:54.750> when<00:00:55.289> it<00:00:55.440> gets<00:00:55.739> off<00:00:56.039> of<00:00:56.070> the

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
contrast here when it gets off of the

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.450 
contrast here when it gets off of the
native<00:00:56.760> ISO<00:00:57.270> of<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:58.440> area<00:00:58.739> Alexa<00:00:59.160> which<00:00:59.309> is

800 ISO and whether it feels to get kind

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.429 
800 ISO and whether it feels to get kind

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
of thin and with its bit depth and and

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.370 
of thin and with its bit depth and and
color<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.360> what<00:01:09.360> we<00:01:09.510> were<00:01:09.659> noticing<00:01:10.200> right

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
color and what we were noticing right

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.530 
color and what we were noticing right
off<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.680> bat<00:01:10.860> now<00:01:11.070> this<00:01:11.430> color<00:01:11.700> correction<00:01:12.330> is

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
off the bat now this color correction is

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.410 
off the bat now this color correction is
one<00:01:12.810> that<00:01:13.020> was<00:01:13.170> done<00:01:13.700> for<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.850> movie<00:01:15.210> we<00:01:15.390> were

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
one that was done for the movie we were

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.460 
one that was done for the movie we were
going<00:01:15.930> in<00:01:16.170> much<00:01:16.619> more<00:01:16.860> earth<00:01:17.130> tones<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:18.470> so

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
going in much more earth tones and so

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.620 
going in much more earth tones and so
there's<00:01:19.740> you<00:01:20.670> know<00:01:20.700> some<00:01:21.030> brown<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:21.570> the

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
there's you know some brown and the

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.740 
there's you know some brown and the
blacks<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:22.830> be<00:01:22.950> able<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.220> go<00:01:23.729> for<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.540> look

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
blacks to be able to go for the the look

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.550 
blacks to be able to go for the the look
of<00:01:25.020> Need<00:01:25.350> for<00:01:25.380> Speed<00:01:26.600> you<00:01:27.600> can<00:01:27.810> see<00:01:28.049> that<00:01:28.320> the

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
of Need for Speed you can see that the

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.399 
of Need for Speed you can see that the
bit<00:01:28.740> depth<00:01:29.009> is<00:01:29.250> holding<00:01:29.729> fairly<00:01:30.509> well<00:01:30.810> even

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
bit depth is holding fairly well even

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.740 
bit depth is holding fairly well even
though<00:01:32.100> we're<00:01:32.369> we're<00:01:32.790> increasing<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.630> ISO

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
though we're we're increasing the ISO

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.130 
though we're we're increasing the ISO
we're<00:01:34.320> up<00:01:34.439> to<00:01:34.590> 1280<00:01:35.240> what<00:01:36.240> I<00:01:36.270> noticed<00:01:36.869> is<00:01:37.110> the

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
we're up to 1280 what I noticed is the

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.140 
we're up to 1280 what I noticed is the
camera<00:01:37.770> got<00:01:37.920> you<00:01:38.460> know<00:01:38.579> fairly<00:01:39.030> noisy<00:01:39.390> at<00:01:40.070> 1600

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150 
camera got you know fairly noisy at 1600

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.810 
camera got you know fairly noisy at 1600
you<00:01:42.150> can't<00:01:42.479> see<00:01:42.810> it<00:01:42.930> as<00:01:43.079> much<00:01:43.320> here<00:01:44.159> but<00:01:44.670> on<00:01:44.759> a

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
you can't see it as much here but on a

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.929 
you can't see it as much here but on a
big<00:01:45.090> screen<00:01:45.479> it<00:01:45.689> became<00:01:45.990> very<00:01:46.259> apparent<00:01:46.939> and

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
big screen it became very apparent and

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.130 
big screen it became very apparent and
then<00:01:48.329> you<00:01:48.869> know<00:01:48.990> at<00:01:49.250> 3200<00:01:50.250> we<00:01:50.820> were<00:01:51.000> really<00:01:51.659> you

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
then you know at 3200 we were really you

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.830 
then you know at 3200 we were really you
know<00:01:52.259> fairly<00:01:53.630> good<00:01:54.630> noise<00:01:54.899> levels<00:01:56.420> but<00:01:57.420> it's

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
know fairly good noise levels but it's

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.109 
know fairly good noise levels but it's
bit<00:01:58.140> depth<00:01:58.409> its<00:01:58.680> structure<00:01:59.219> its<00:01:59.460> color<00:01:59.790> all

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
bit depth its structure its color all

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.530 
bit depth its structure its color all
seemed<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:00.810> hold<00:02:01.399> very<00:02:02.399> nicely<00:02:02.700> now<00:02:03.240> we're<00:02:03.420> up

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
seemed to hold very nicely now we're up

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.419 
seemed to hold very nicely now we're up
to<00:02:03.570> 3200<00:02:04.530> ISO<00:02:04.680> here<00:02:05.520> and<00:02:06.500> this<00:02:07.500> finishes<00:02:08.129> the

starting<00:02:13.020> at<00:02:13.260> 400<00:02:13.920> ISO<00:02:14.510> now<00:02:15.770> immediately<00:02:16.770> what

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
starting at 400 ISO now immediately what

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.890 
starting at 400 ISO now immediately what
I<00:02:17.130> saw<00:02:17.660> was<00:02:18.660> the<00:02:19.280> color<00:02:20.330> difference

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
I saw was the color difference

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.070 
I saw was the color difference
I<00:02:22.070> saw<00:02:23.070> something<00:02:23.730> that<00:02:24.000> came<00:02:24.240> up<00:02:24.270> even<00:02:24.960> though

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
I saw something that came up even though

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.880 
I saw something that came up even though
we<00:02:25.230> went<00:02:25.380> for<00:02:25.710> the<00:02:25.740> more<00:02:26.100> D<00:02:26.370> saturated<00:02:27.150> and<00:02:27.480> in

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
we went for the more D saturated and in

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.780 
we went for the more D saturated and in
earthy<00:02:28.890> tones<00:02:29.190> there<00:02:30.060> seemed<00:02:30.390> to<00:02:30.510> be<00:02:30.600> a

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
earthy tones there seemed to be a

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.210 
earthy tones there seemed to be a
warmness<00:02:32.790> and<00:02:33.240> a<00:02:33.330> golden<00:02:34.020> as'<00:02:34.320> in<00:02:34.590> the<00:02:34.890> skin

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
tones that was not apparent in the Alexa

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.090 
tones that was not apparent in the Alexa
footage<00:02:41.310> and<00:02:41.520> with<00:02:42.510> the<00:02:42.810> Canon<00:02:43.380> log<00:02:43.620> it's<00:02:43.980> a

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
footage and with the Canon log it's a

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.640

much<00:02:44.280> softer<00:02:44.610> log<00:02:45.120> file<00:02:45.510> so<00:02:45.870> all<00:02:46.140> the<00:02:46.350> colors

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
much softer log file so all the colors

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.160 
much softer log file so all the colors
are<00:02:47.100> pretty<00:02:47.400> much<00:02:47.640> there<00:02:48.030> you<00:02:48.330> just<00:02:48.780> have<00:02:49.020> to

are pretty much there you just have to

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.130 
are pretty much there you just have to
you<00:02:49.590> know<00:02:49.620> cut<00:02:50.190> through<00:02:50.610> the<00:02:51.239> flatness<00:02:51.870> and

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
you know cut through the flatness and

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.860 
you know cut through the flatness and
the<00:02:52.500> image<00:02:52.800> comes<00:02:53.130> up<00:02:53.989> fairly<00:02:55.310> nicely<00:02:56.310> with<00:02:57.270> C

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
the image comes up fairly nicely with C

it's a has greenish tones and you're
constantly<00:03:04.620> kind<00:03:05.220> of<00:03:05.430> dialing<00:03:06.000> that<00:03:06.150> magenta

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
constantly kind of dialing that magenta

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.610 
constantly kind of dialing that magenta
out<00:03:07.250> are<00:03:08.250> sarli<00:03:08.850> dialing<00:03:09.300> the<00:03:09.420> green<00:03:09.720> out<00:03:09.959> and

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.610 
out are sarli dialing the green out and
you<00:03:10.950> have<00:03:11.100> to<00:03:11.220> add<00:03:11.340> magenta<00:03:12.000> to<00:03:12.209> do<00:03:12.360> that<00:03:12.630> this

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
you have to add magenta to do that this

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.970 
you have to add magenta to do that this
would<00:03:14.550> see<00:03:14.910> five<00:03:15.090> hundred<00:03:15.660> I<00:03:16.019> really<00:03:16.799> wasn't

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
would see five hundred I really wasn't

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.539 
would see five hundred I really wasn't
having<00:03:17.430> to<00:03:17.549> do<00:03:17.820> any<00:03:18.120> of<00:03:18.269> that<00:03:19.340> dialing<00:03:20.340> the

having to do any of that dialing the

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:24.920 
having to do any of that dialing the
green<00:03:20.820> out<00:03:21.030> so<00:03:21.690> the<00:03:22.080> colors<00:03:23.060> came<00:03:24.060> in<00:03:24.299> much

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
green out so the colors came in much

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.910 
green out so the colors came in much
more<00:03:25.140> pure<00:03:25.560> and<00:03:26.780> we<00:03:27.780> you<00:03:28.200> know<00:03:28.230> both<00:03:28.560> Scotty

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
more pure and we you know both Scotty

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.310 
more pure and we you know both Scotty
and<00:03:29.130> I<00:03:29.220> really<00:03:29.610> responded<00:03:30.239> to<00:03:30.269> the<00:03:30.570> tones<00:03:30.870> that

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
and I really responded to the tones that

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.670 
and I really responded to the tones that
were<00:03:31.920> on<00:03:32.420> their<00:03:33.420> faces<00:03:33.750> and<00:03:34.230> in<00:03:34.590> the

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
were on their faces and in the

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.949 
were on their faces and in the
background<00:03:35.090> we're<00:03:36.090> up<00:03:36.180> to<00:03:36.330> 2500<00:03:37.200> ISO<00:03:37.680> here<00:03:38.070> and

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 
background we're up to 2500 ISO here and

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:43.250 
background we're up to 2500 ISO here and
it's<00:03:39.959> still<00:03:40.200> looking<00:03:40.410> very<00:03:41.370> clean<00:03:42.079> 3200<00:03:43.079> so

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
it's still looking very clean 3200 so

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.530 
it's still looking very clean 3200 so
that's<00:03:43.440> where<00:03:43.650> we<00:03:43.769> were<00:03:43.920> with<00:03:44.130> the<00:03:44.160> Alexa<00:03:44.760> when

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
that's where we were with the Alexa when

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.600 
that's where we were with the Alexa when
that<00:03:45.810> topped<00:03:46.110> out<00:03:46.410> now<00:03:46.860> we're<00:03:47.040> gonna<00:03:47.130> take<00:03:47.430> it

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
that topped out now we're gonna take it

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:51.560 
that topped out now we're gonna take it
even<00:03:47.820> further<00:03:48.060> so<00:03:48.750> now<00:03:48.780> we're<00:03:49.079> at<00:03:49.220> 4000<00:03:50.220> no<00:03:51.209> on

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
even further so now we're at 4000 no on

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:54.530 
even further so now we're at 4000 no on
the<00:03:52.170> big<00:03:52.350> screen<00:03:52.709> what<00:03:52.980> we<00:03:53.130> noticed<00:03:53.519> is<00:03:53.670> 4000

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
the big screen what we noticed is 4000

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:59.090 
the big screen what we noticed is 4000
was<00:03:54.660> really<00:03:55.110> the<00:03:55.260> cap<00:03:55.500> off<00:03:55.799> of<00:03:56.130> noise<00:03:57.140> and<00:03:58.140> the

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
was really the cap off of noise and the

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.030 
was really the cap off of noise and the
this<00:03:59.549> color<00:03:59.970> and<00:04:00.329> the<00:04:00.840> bit<00:04:01.049> depth<00:04:01.380> of<00:04:01.620> the

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
this color and the bit depth of the

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.410 
this color and the bit depth of the
image<00:04:02.340> seemed<00:04:02.880> to<00:04:03.030> get<00:04:03.209> thin<00:04:03.780> so<00:04:04.739> we<00:04:05.340> set<00:04:06.209> our

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
image seemed to get thin so we set our

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.620 
image seemed to get thin so we set our
sights<00:04:06.480> on<00:04:07.079> 4000<00:04:08.010> was<00:04:08.220> absolutely<00:04:09.060> extreme

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
sights on 4000 was absolutely extreme

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.979 
sights on 4000 was absolutely extreme
that's<00:04:09.930> as<00:04:10.110> far<00:04:10.290> as<00:04:10.470> we<00:04:10.620> would<00:04:10.829> go<00:04:11.010> and<00:04:11.340> then<00:04:12.030> we

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
that's as far as we would go and then we

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:16.340 
that's as far as we would go and then we
kept<00:04:13.290> it<00:04:13.410> more<00:04:13.650> around<00:04:13.950> 2000<00:04:14.760> to<00:04:14.820> 2500<00:04:15.360> as<00:04:15.870> our

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
kept it more around 2000 to 2500 as our

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:21.020 
kept it more around 2000 to 2500 as our
top<00:04:17.419> most<00:04:18.419> of<00:04:18.660> the<00:04:18.720> film<00:04:18.930> I<00:04:19.260> shot<00:04:19.290> at<00:04:19.979> 850<00:04:20.669> which

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
top most of the film I shot at 850 which

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.830 
top most of the film I shot at 850 which
is<00:04:21.180> C<00:04:22.169> 500s<00:04:22.740> native

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
is C 500s native

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.220 
is C 500s native
and<00:04:23.930> we<00:04:24.169> went<00:04:24.350> up<00:04:24.440> to<00:04:24.590> 1600<00:04:25.400> in<00:04:25.660> 2004<00:04:26.660> all<00:04:26.900> the

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.230 
and we went up to 1600 in 2004 all the

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:30.850 
and we went up to 1600 in 2004 all the
night<00:04:27.590> action<00:04:28.340> sequences<00:04:29.060> the<00:04:30.050> car<00:04:30.260> races<00:04:30.710> and

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:30.860 
night action sequences the car races and

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.070 
night action sequences the car races and
everything<00:04:31.310> so<00:04:31.550> we<00:04:31.669> could<00:04:31.820> get<00:04:32.030> a<00:04:32.540> little<00:04:32.900> more

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
everything so we could get a little more

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.990 
everything so we could get a little more
focus<00:04:33.620> we<00:04:33.800> didn't<00:04:34.070> have<00:04:34.160> to<00:04:34.280> shoot<00:04:34.490> it<00:04:34.639> a<00:04:34.760> two

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 
focus we didn't have to shoot it a two

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.360 
focus we didn't have to shoot it a two
or<00:04:35.419> a<00:04:35.750> two<00:04:36.050> and<00:04:36.169> a<00:04:36.230> half<00:04:36.440> we<00:04:36.770> could<00:04:36.919> be<00:04:37.040> more<00:04:37.250> in

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
or a two and a half we could be more in

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.940 
or a two and a half we could be more in
a<00:04:37.460> two<00:04:37.639> eight<00:04:37.790> and<00:04:37.940> a<00:04:37.970> half<00:04:38.200> four<00:04:39.200> split<00:04:39.710> and

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:39.950 
a two eight and a half four split and

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:43.480 
a two eight and a half four split and
that<00:04:40.880> enabled<00:04:41.419> us<00:04:41.570> to<00:04:42.010> hold<00:04:43.010> things<00:04:43.280> a<00:04:43.400> little

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
that enabled us to hold things a little

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.250 
that enabled us to hold things a little
more<00:04:43.730> in<00:04:43.820> focus<00:04:44.030> and<00:04:44.419> we<00:04:44.510> could<00:04:44.660> really<00:04:44.960> whip

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:45.260 
more in focus and we could really whip

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.230 
more in focus and we could really whip
the<00:04:45.410> camera<00:04:45.800> around<00:04:45.889> and<00:04:46.490> not<00:04:46.730> have<00:04:46.760> such<00:04:47.210> a

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
the camera around and not have such a

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:48.400 
the camera around and not have such a
shallow<00:04:47.540> depth-of-field

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:48.410 
shallow depth-of-field

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:50.740 
shallow depth-of-field
we're<00:04:49.190> up<00:04:49.280> to<00:04:49.430> sixteen<00:04:49.970> thousand<00:04:50.570> you<00:04:50.630> can

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750 
we're up to sixteen thousand you can

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.320 
we're up to sixteen thousand you can
really<00:04:51.169> start<00:04:51.440> to<00:04:51.530> see<00:04:51.620> 20,000<00:04:52.610> the<00:04:52.700> noise<00:04:52.940> is

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
really start to see 20,000 the noise is

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.409 
really start to see 20,000 the noise is
taking<00:04:53.720> over<00:04:53.990> their<00:04:54.110> whole<00:04:54.350> face<00:04:55.180> this<00:04:56.180> is

00:04:56.409 --> 00:04:56.419 
taking over their whole face this is

00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:58.629 
taking over their whole face this is
extreme<00:04:56.960> but<00:04:57.470> it's<00:04:57.740> a<00:04:57.860> heck<00:04:58.040> of<00:04:58.070> a<00:04:58.280> different

00:04:58.629 --> 00:04:58.639 
extreme but it's a heck of a different

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:01.950 
extreme but it's a heck of a different
look<00:04:58.850> so<00:04:59.590> now<00:05:00.590> we're<00:05:00.740> gonna<00:05:00.830> do<00:05:01.070> side<00:05:01.340> by<00:05:01.550> side

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960 
look so now we're gonna do side by side

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.030 
look so now we're gonna do side by side
so<00:05:02.960> you<00:05:02.990> can<00:05:03.169> really<00:05:03.229> see<00:05:03.710> the<00:05:03.860> color

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:04.040 
so you can really see the color

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:07.360 
so you can really see the color
difference<00:05:04.660> so<00:05:05.660> the<00:05:06.110> Alexa<00:05:06.620> definitely<00:05:07.130> looks

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.370 
difference so the Alexa definitely looks

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:11.260 
difference so the Alexa definitely looks
more<00:05:07.790> magenta<00:05:08.540> to<00:05:08.930> my<00:05:09.080> eye<00:05:09.490> the<00:05:10.490> cannon<00:05:10.940> looks

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:11.270 
more magenta to my eye the cannon looks

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:14.350 
more magenta to my eye the cannon looks
a<00:05:11.419> little<00:05:11.570> more<00:05:11.810> yellowish<00:05:12.620> golden<00:05:13.400> and<00:05:13.669> this

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360 
a little more yellowish golden and this

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.560 
a little more yellowish golden and this
is<00:05:14.540> what<00:05:14.780> Scotty<00:05:15.380> and<00:05:15.560> I<00:05:15.740> really<00:05:16.570> gravitated

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:17.570 
is what Scotty and I really gravitated

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:23.080 
is what Scotty and I really gravitated
towards<00:05:18.440> we<00:05:18.830> loved<00:05:19.250> that<00:05:21.070> kind<00:05:22.070> of<00:05:22.190> skin<00:05:22.790> tone

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.090 
towards we loved that kind of skin tone

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:25.690 
towards we loved that kind of skin tone
we<00:05:23.450> knew<00:05:23.690> we<00:05:24.440> were<00:05:24.560> gonna<00:05:24.680> be<00:05:24.979> airing<00:05:25.430> much

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:25.700 
we knew we were gonna be airing much

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:28.510 
we knew we were gonna be airing much
more<00:05:25.970> on<00:05:26.240> the<00:05:26.510> gold<00:05:26.840> than<00:05:27.080> a<00:05:27.200> yellow<00:05:27.560> where

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:28.520 
more on the gold than a yellow where

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.279 
more on the gold than a yellow where
we'd<00:05:28.789> much<00:05:29.030> rather<00:05:29.060> make<00:05:29.570> people<00:05:29.900> look<00:05:30.140> a

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:30.289 
we'd much rather make people look a

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:33.580 
we'd much rather make people look a
little<00:05:30.440> more<00:05:30.620> jaundiced<00:05:30.979> then<00:05:31.550> pink<00:05:32.320> we<00:05:33.320> hate

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:33.590 
little more jaundiced then pink we hate

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:37.360 
little more jaundiced then pink we hate
pink<00:05:33.919> as<00:05:34.130> a<00:05:34.160> color<00:05:34.460> so<00:05:35.740> the<00:05:36.740> cannon<00:05:37.130> just

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:37.370 
pink as a color so the cannon just

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:40.870 
pink as a color so the cannon just
really<00:05:38.030> seemed<00:05:38.330> to<00:05:38.419> come<00:05:38.750> up<00:05:38.919> nicely<00:05:39.919> with<00:05:40.700> all

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:40.880 
really seemed to come up nicely with all

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.409 
really seemed to come up nicely with all
that<00:05:41.090> and<00:05:42.250> what<00:05:43.250> I<00:05:43.280> also<00:05:43.520> noticed<00:05:44.030> is<00:05:44.150> see<00:05:44.300> how

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:44.419 
that and what I also noticed is see how

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:47.650 
that and what I also noticed is see how
we're<00:05:44.600> cranking<00:05:44.870> up<00:05:45.200> the<00:05:45.229> ISO<00:05:45.940> the<00:05:46.940> Alexa

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:47.660 
we're cranking up the ISO the Alexa

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:49.840 
we're cranking up the ISO the Alexa
definitely<00:05:48.140> gets<00:05:48.350> much<00:05:48.620> more<00:05:48.800> contrast<00:05:49.460> here

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:49.850 
definitely gets much more contrast here

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:54.100 
definitely gets much more contrast here
in<00:05:50.030> the<00:05:50.750> shadow<00:05:51.380> areas<00:05:51.950> than<00:05:52.490> the<00:05:52.970> c500<00:05:53.479> and

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:54.110 
in the shadow areas than the c500 and

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:57.000 
in the shadow areas than the c500 and
that's<00:05:54.860> one<00:05:55.100> thing<00:05:55.310> I<00:05:55.490> loved<00:05:55.820> is<00:05:56.090> how<00:05:56.270> the<00:05:56.330> c500

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:57.010 
that's one thing I loved is how the c500

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:00.820 
that's one thing I loved is how the c500
fell<00:05:58.010> off<00:05:58.250> into<00:05:58.669> the<00:05:58.880> shadows<00:05:59.380> it<00:06:00.380> seemed<00:06:00.710> to

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:00.830 
fell off into the shadows it seemed to

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:05.230 
fell off into the shadows it seemed to
have<00:06:01.010> a<00:06:01.090> nicer<00:06:03.070> nicer<00:06:04.070> fall-off<00:06:04.520> which<00:06:04.880> I<00:06:05.060> knew

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:05.240 
have a nicer nicer fall-off which I knew

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.390 
have a nicer nicer fall-off which I knew
with<00:06:05.510> all<00:06:05.660> our<00:06:05.810> night<00:06:06.050> work<00:06:06.289> being<00:06:06.620> up<00:06:06.830> to<00:06:06.860> 16

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:07.400 
with all our night work being up to 16

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.360 
with all our night work being up to 16
or<00:06:07.639> 2000<00:06:08.300> ISO<00:06:08.720> I<00:06:08.990> really<00:06:09.590> would

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:10.370 
or 2000 ISO I really would

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:13.840 
or 2000 ISO I really would
it<00:06:10.820> did<00:06:11.240> not<00:06:11.389> be<00:06:11.690> so<00:06:12.020> crunchy<00:06:12.380> and<00:06:12.860> losing<00:06:13.820> that

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:13.850 
it did not be so crunchy and losing that

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:15.850 
it did not be so crunchy and losing that
detail<00:06:14.389> on<00:06:14.570> the<00:06:14.660> blacks<00:06:14.960> it<00:06:15.289> was<00:06:15.440> very

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:15.860 
detail on the blacks it was very

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:18.070 
detail on the blacks it was very
