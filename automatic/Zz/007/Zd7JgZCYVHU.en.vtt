Jackson<00:04:50.820> so<00:04:51.479> I<00:04:51.509> look<00:04:51.750> at<00:04:51.840> this<00:04:51.990> team<00:04:52.259> and<00:04:52.410> I

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:52.470 
Jackson so I look at this team and I

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:53.629 
Jackson so I look at this team and I
think<00:04:52.710> they're<00:04:53.039> going<00:04:53.160> to<00:04:53.220> put<00:04:53.400> up<00:04:53.490> good

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:53.639 
think they're going to put up good

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:55.070 
think they're going to put up good
numbers<00:04:53.699> this<00:04:54.030> passing<00:04:54.509> attacks<00:04:54.780> going<00:04:54.960> to<00:04:55.020> be

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
numbers this passing attacks going to be

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.870 
numbers this passing attacks going to be
better<00:04:55.289> it's<00:04:55.560> a<00:04:55.650> team<00:04:55.830> that<00:04:55.979> bounces<00:04:56.430> back<00:04:56.610> off

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 
better it's a team that bounces back off
