00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.660
 every day maria de lourdes better known 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.799
 like a 31-year-old black woman runs 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.139
 very 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.480
 living in igarassu she became known 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.269
 for leaving the profession of domestic 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.029
 to dedicate to the race and today does not lose 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.460
 a vile proof of this is the hundreds of 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.920
 medals accumulated over more than 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.099
 ten years of practicing sport 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.320
 the money won at the races pretinha 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.340
 You're already building the house. 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.960
 own 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.660
 but this story has not always been 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.239
 good things and do not seek guidance from 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.710
 At the beginning she lived the drama of staying 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.950
 injured 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.500
 everything was going well, the side was from the side 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.440
 left knee and then could not even 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.170
 knee work is to wear a pair of pants 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.870
 was complicated and when he was 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.210
 run only managed to do 20 minutes 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.120
 if it increased a little more then 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.670
 I cried and was way stop even 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.250
 but it has been held back is a 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.220
 example of life because it has 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.090
 difficulties in training are on the road 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.090
 of land 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.080
 conditioning is pulling the tire 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.439
 truck 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.900
 her tip is to get out of comfort and let 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:19.040
 the laziness aside will only begin to exist 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:22.380
 a little too hard and strong and also 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:25.500
 Do you understand that I can need a lot of 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:29.400
 thing did not put a little something 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.619
 antenna top and only running 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.350
 the daee looks taking advantage of this injection of 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.600
 examples of her 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.280
 start running because that's why we came here 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.409
 to the edge of a good trip a place 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.320
 public where you can start running 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.939
 without needing to pay anything but there we 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.070
 will explain some things some 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.869
 very important details for you 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.580
 start exercising 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.930
 Come on, let's start. 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.310
 what is the first step for who is 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.870
 wanting to run can not afford to 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.000
 pay a professional but must stay 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.350
 attentive to some of the best of us 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.010
 need to know at what level of 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:06.620
 conditioning is going to look for 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.450
 The doctor will let us know if he is 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.910
 for the activity and what level of 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.820
 conditioning, we're all okay 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.950
 With health it's time to start from there. 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:18.470
 stay tuned for some tips 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.750
 wear comfortable clothes giving attention 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.910
 special for tennis and run in 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.410
 cooler times early in the morning 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.390
 or at night 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.940
 controls the power to prevent 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.910
 no energy to run when 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:34.250
 practice notes this recommendation 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:37.070
 the ideal is to start slow and progressive 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.350
 up to the ideal training stimulus 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.690
 after finishing decreasing the 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.470
 from training to walking and 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.739
 rest 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:49.910
 it is vital that this prevents contracture injuries 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:53.330
 is the overload on the joints 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:55.790
 is even the feeling of well being of the 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.320
 athlete accelerates the recovery process 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.760
 look, people are paying attention now 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.410
 people are going to talk about the right way 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.450
 the posture some important details 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.310
 for who wants to run and deco go 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.260
 to observe a runner someone is coming 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.660
 the law that can explain to better people 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:11.209
 in practice let's just take 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.790
 Someone to talk a little about 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:16.670
 This can take her here that is 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.410
 arriving is very interesting to observe the 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:22.850
 arm movement 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:25.940
 the knee that he points to 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:28.250
 tread sert starting with the heel 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:31.430
 the arms it passes parallel to the trunk 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:33.650
 flexion of 90 degrees elbow and he 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.940
 it works as if it were a pendulum 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.230
 knee he will always have to be 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.840
 pointing forward 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:41.090
 unstable it does not swing from one side and 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.160
 another he also works as a 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.959
 pendulum or patrician people who are 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.750
 has been running for over a year 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:49.280
 Patricia, what benefits have you got? 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.140
 Do you think you've gotten along? 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.010
 more than one year thereafter. 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.349
 start by acim 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.730
 weight has improved my work 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:59.430
 respiratory 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.829
 so that 's how it gets a lot more 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.970
 healthy you feel you too 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:05.220
 healthy understood 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.560
 you give more resistant to everything you 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.930
 will not go up a breathless ladder any more 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.299
 understood then you mean it's very cool 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.310
 already who is starting like James who is 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:16.919
 made with the plot to month and a half is 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:19.019
 participate in groups to have 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:20.789
 more discipline as I know that all 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:22.229
 Tuesday and Thursday in training then already 

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:24.060
 I put it on my head that every Tuesday 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:25.350
 and Thursday evening and come back here then 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.590
 this way it is easier to maintain the 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.590
 subject
