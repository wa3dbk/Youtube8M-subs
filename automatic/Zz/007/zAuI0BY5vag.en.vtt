times<00:00:28.230> it's<00:00:28.590> kind<00:00:28.800> of<00:00:28.859> hard<00:00:29.070> to<00:00:29.130> think<00:00:29.220> about

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
times it's kind of hard to think about

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.519 
times it's kind of hard to think about
well<00:00:29.849> how<00:00:29.880> do<00:00:30.179> you<00:00:30.330> go<00:00:30.570> about<00:00:30.689> getting<00:00:30.869> apart

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
well how do you go about getting apart

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.500 
well how do you go about getting apart
all<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.740> different<00:00:32.040> florets<00:00:32.430> what's<00:00:33.270> really

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
all the different florets what's really

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.740 
all the different florets what's really
cool<00:00:33.780> and<00:00:34.489> if<00:00:35.489> you<00:00:35.670> garden<00:00:35.969> it's<00:00:36.450> just<00:00:36.630> a

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
cool and if you garden it's just a

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.720 
cool and if you garden it's just a
really<00:00:36.989> neat<00:00:37.200> way<00:00:37.380> to<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.980> learn<00:00:38.190> how<00:00:38.460> they're

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
really neat way to to learn how they're

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.060 
really neat way to to learn how they're
how<00:00:39.480> they<00:00:39.629> grow<00:00:39.899> so<00:00:40.500> if<00:00:40.590> you<00:00:40.680> look<00:00:40.860> at<00:00:40.950> the

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
how they grow so if you look at the

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.069 
how they grow so if you look at the
bottom<00:00:41.520> of<00:00:41.610> it<00:00:41.790> this<00:00:42.000> is<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.300> stock<00:00:42.629> so<00:00:42.989> it

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
bottom of it this is the stock so it

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.770 
bottom of it this is the stock so it
grows<00:00:43.350> on<00:00:43.500> a<00:00:43.530> stock<00:00:43.950> okay<00:00:44.850> so<00:00:44.910> when<00:00:45.180> you<00:00:45.300> get

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
grows on a stock okay so when you get

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.430 
grows on a stock okay so when you get
the<00:00:46.309> cauliflower<00:00:47.660> head<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.930> first<00:00:49.170> thing<00:00:49.350> you

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
the cauliflower head the first thing you

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.290 
the cauliflower head the first thing you
want<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.680> do<00:00:49.860> is<00:00:50.219> take<00:00:51.180> apart<00:00:51.719> these<00:00:52.110> pieces<00:00:53.300> on

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
want to do is take apart these pieces on

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.119 
want to do is take apart these pieces on
the<00:00:54.360> bottom<00:00:54.719> that<00:00:55.230> way<00:00:55.350> we<00:00:55.500> can<00:00:55.649> start<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:55.949> see

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
the bottom that way we can start to see

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.709 
the bottom that way we can start to see
where<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.370> florets<00:00:56.789> are<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:57.270> then<00:00:57.420> we<00:00:57.570> can

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
where the florets are and then we can

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.060 
where the florets are and then we can
cut<00:00:57.989> from<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.320> bottom<00:00:58.500> because<00:00:58.859> we<00:00:58.890> don't

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
cut from the bottom because we don't

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.650 
cut from the bottom because we don't
want<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.219> just<00:00:59.399> cut<00:00:59.640> through<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.000> entire<00:01:00.300> head

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
want to just cut through the entire head

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.360 
want to just cut through the entire head
because<00:01:01.230> that<00:01:01.379> leaves<00:01:01.590> a<00:01:01.649> lot<00:01:01.800> of<00:01:01.920> those<00:01:02.100> sharp

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
because that leaves a lot of those sharp

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.130 
because that leaves a lot of those sharp
jagged<00:01:02.789> edges<00:01:03.059> that<00:01:03.359> we<00:01:03.480> really<00:01:03.780> just<00:01:03.930> don't

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
jagged edges that we really just don't

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.500 
jagged edges that we really just don't
want<00:01:05.180> and<00:01:06.180> these<00:01:06.930> pieces<00:01:07.350> right<00:01:07.830> here<00:01:08.510> they

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
want and these pieces right here they

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:10.219 
want and these pieces right here they
are

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
are

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.380 
are
it's<00:01:10.650> like<00:01:10.830> cabbage<00:01:11.220> okay<00:01:11.520> so<00:01:11.580> you<00:01:12.210> know<00:01:12.299> if

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
it's like cabbage okay so you know if

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.750 
it's like cabbage okay so you know if
you<00:01:12.479> have<00:01:12.600> chickens<00:01:12.990> they<00:01:13.350> go<00:01:14.040> crazy<00:01:14.340> for<00:01:14.580> this

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
you have chickens they go crazy for this

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.550 
you have chickens they go crazy for this
or<00:01:14.939> you<00:01:15.150> can<00:01:15.299> save<00:01:15.540> this<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:15.780> put<00:01:16.080> into<00:01:16.290> stock

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
or you can save this to put into stock

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.260 
or you can save this to put into stock
because<00:01:17.070> that<00:01:17.220> will<00:01:17.369> flavor<00:01:17.610> it<00:01:17.880> really

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
because that will flavor it really

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.399 
because that will flavor it really
nicely<00:01:20.090> or<00:01:21.090> you<00:01:21.420> can<00:01:21.570> even<00:01:21.720> just<00:01:21.869> cut<00:01:22.229> them

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
nicely or you can even just cut them

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.170 
nicely or you can even just cut them
apart<00:01:22.939> and<00:01:25.280> saute<00:01:26.280> them<00:01:26.310> up<00:01:26.580> in<00:01:26.729> garlic<00:01:27.060> and

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
apart and saute them up in garlic and

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.429 
apart and saute them up in garlic and
olive<00:01:27.270> oil<00:01:27.450> it<00:01:27.600> tastes<00:01:27.750> great<00:01:27.990> too

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
olive oil it tastes great too

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.539 
olive oil it tastes great too
so<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.549> first<00:01:29.759> thing<00:01:29.939> you're<00:01:30.060> going<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.240> do<00:01:30.479> is

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
just start to take apart all these

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.260 
just start to take apart all these
different<00:01:36.210> two<00:01:36.360> pieces<00:01:36.950> on<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.579> stock<00:01:38.909> in<00:01:39.210> the

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
different two pieces on the stock in the

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.690 
different two pieces on the stock in the
bottom<00:01:39.720> okay<00:01:39.990> so<00:01:40.049> that<00:01:40.380> you<00:01:40.470> can<00:01:40.619> start<00:01:41.250> to<00:01:41.430> see

bottom okay so that you can start to see
that<00:01:45.229> the<00:01:46.229> whole<00:01:46.409> stock<00:01:46.740> coming<00:01:47.399> apart<00:01:47.780> and

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
that the whole stock coming apart and

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.450 
that the whole stock coming apart and
you<00:01:49.110> know<00:01:49.200> if<00:01:49.290> you<00:01:49.380> have<00:01:49.530> a<00:01:49.560> larger<00:01:50.009> end<00:01:50.250> right

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
you know if you have a larger end right

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.980 
you know if you have a larger end right
here<00:01:50.610> you<00:01:50.759> can<00:01:50.909> even<00:01:51.030> cut<00:01:51.329> that<00:01:51.509> straight<00:01:51.869> off

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
here you can even cut that straight off

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.480 
here you can even cut that straight off
but<00:01:52.020> you<00:01:52.320> know<00:01:52.350> this<00:01:52.590> one<00:01:52.710> wasn't<00:01:52.979> too<00:01:53.100> bad

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
but you know this one wasn't too bad
