speculation<00:00:04.380> video<00:00:04.740> we<00:00:05.069> finally<00:00:05.520> have<00:00:05.700> the

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
speculation video we finally have the

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.509 
speculation video we finally have the
official<00:00:06.450> images<00:00:06.960> of<00:00:07.020> the<00:00:07.230> blobby<00:00:08.010> blobs<00:00:08.370> that

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
official images of the blobby blobs that

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.030 
official images of the blobby blobs that
we've<00:00:08.730> been<00:00:08.849> hearing<00:00:09.120> about<00:00:09.590> so<00:00:10.590> good<00:00:10.830> to

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
we've been hearing about so good to

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.120 
we've been hearing about so good to
finally<00:00:11.460> be<00:00:11.670> able<00:00:11.820> to<00:00:11.910> see<00:00:12.090> them<00:00:12.710> legally<00:00:13.710> but

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
finally be able to see them legally but

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.340 
finally be able to see them legally but
what<00:00:14.280> the<00:00:14.460> scan<00:00:14.759> came<00:00:15.089> up<00:00:15.360> rainbow<00:00:15.780> of<00:00:16.049> hints

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
what the scan came up rainbow of hints

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.650 
what the scan came up rainbow of hints
so<00:00:16.500> it's<00:00:17.010> time<00:00:17.160> to<00:00:17.310> break<00:00:17.460> this<00:00:17.640> down<00:00:17.850> take<00:00:18.630> a

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
so it's time to break this down take a

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.290 
so it's time to break this down take a
look<00:00:18.840> at<00:00:18.990> this<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.980> blobs<00:00:20.250> there<00:00:20.699> they<00:00:20.850> are<00:00:20.880> in

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
look at this the blobs there they are in

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.599 
look at this the blobs there they are in
one<00:00:21.720> corner<00:00:22.020> we<00:00:22.140> have<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.680> blob<00:00:22.890> reunion<00:00:23.400> and

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
one corner we have the blob reunion and

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.189 
one corner we have the blob reunion and
in<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:23.939> other<00:00:24.119> corner<00:00:24.330> we<00:00:24.510> have<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:24.900> fourth

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
in the other corner we have the fourth

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.710 
in the other corner we have the fourth
to<00:00:25.350> mega<00:00:25.529> evolution<00:00:26.070> act<00:00:26.310> but<00:00:26.730> let's<00:00:27.240> focus<00:00:27.420> on

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
to mega evolution act but let's focus on

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.750 
to mega evolution act but let's focus on
the<00:00:27.779> blob<00:00:28.050> family<00:00:28.500> in<00:00:28.769> a<00:00:28.890> recent<00:00:29.279> video<00:00:29.519> I

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
the blob family in a recent video I

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.759 
the blob family in a recent video I
speculated<00:00:30.359> that<00:00:30.510> these<00:00:30.750> blob<00:00:31.140> amounts<00:00:31.590> are<00:00:31.710> a

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
speculated that these blob amounts are a

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.500 
speculated that these blob amounts are a
part<00:00:32.250> of<00:00:32.369> zygarde<00:00:32.850> and<00:00:33.030> could<00:00:33.180> be<00:00:33.360> the

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
part of zygarde and could be the

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.180 
part of zygarde and could be the
thousands<00:00:33.989> of<00:00:34.079> little<00:00:34.320> hexagons<00:00:34.829> that<00:00:35.070> it

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
thousands of little hexagons that it

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.340 
thousands of little hexagons that it
uses<00:00:35.340> to<00:00:35.610> fight<00:00:35.850> as<00:00:36.059> seen<00:00:36.719> when<00:00:36.899> it<00:00:36.960> used<00:00:37.170> a

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
uses to fight as seen when it used a

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.990 
uses to fight as seen when it used a
thousand<00:00:37.770> arrows<00:00:37.890> a<00:00:38.010> thousand<00:00:38.460> waves<00:00:38.610> and

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
thousand arrows a thousand waves and

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.030 
thousand arrows a thousand waves and
looking<00:00:39.690> at<00:00:39.809> them<00:00:39.960> in<00:00:40.050> this<00:00:40.140> image<00:00:40.410> it<00:00:40.770> really

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
looking at them in this image it really

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.950 
looking at them in this image it really
does<00:00:41.190> seem<00:00:41.430> like<00:00:41.610> that<00:00:41.760> could<00:00:41.940> be<00:00:42.059> true<00:00:42.360> but<00:00:42.690> I

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
does seem like that could be true but I

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.470 
does seem like that could be true but I
think<00:00:43.260> there's<00:00:43.469> more<00:00:43.530> to<00:00:43.739> it<00:00:44.100> zygarde<00:00:44.850> is<00:00:45.090> the

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
think there's more to it zygarde is the

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.690 
think there's more to it zygarde is the
guardian<00:00:45.899> of<00:00:45.960> Kalos<00:00:46.440> if<00:00:46.680> anything<00:00:47.190> happens<00:00:47.579> in

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
guardian of Kalos if anything happens in

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.729 
guardian of Kalos if anything happens in
the<00:00:47.760> region<00:00:48.180> it'll<00:00:48.600> awaken<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.200> spank<00:00:49.559> you

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
the region it'll awaken and spank you

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.950 
the region it'll awaken and spank you
and<00:00:49.950> you<00:00:50.160> can't<00:00:50.399> be<00:00:50.520> discrete<00:00:50.940> somehow<00:00:51.629> it

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
and you can't be discrete somehow it

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.750 
and you can't be discrete somehow it
will<00:00:52.170> know<00:00:52.469> if<00:00:52.739> something<00:00:53.129> is<00:00:53.250> happening<00:00:53.640> in

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
will know if something is happening in

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.850 
will know if something is happening in
the<00:00:53.850> region<00:00:54.239> what<00:00:54.690> if<00:00:54.809> these<00:00:55.020> blobs<00:00:55.410> are

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
the region what if these blobs are

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.729 
the region what if these blobs are
receptors<00:00:56.670> for<00:00:56.879> zygarde<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:57.600> how<00:00:57.899> it<00:00:58.230> is<00:00:58.559> able

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
receptors for zygarde and how it is able

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.220 
receptors for zygarde and how it is able
to<00:00:58.980> monitor<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.550> ecosystem<00:01:00.300> look<00:01:00.809> back<00:01:01.050> at

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
to monitor the ecosystem look back at

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.500 
to monitor the ecosystem look back at
its<00:01:01.350> pokedex<00:01:01.800> entry<00:01:02.160> it<00:01:02.430> monitors<00:01:03.000> those<00:01:03.270> who

in<00:01:32.759> this<00:01:32.970> screenshot<00:01:33.270> is<00:01:33.780> probably<00:01:34.170> trying<00:01:34.470> to

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
in this screenshot is probably trying to

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.770 
in this screenshot is probably trying to
use<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:34.979> blobs<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.430> get<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.790> zygarde<00:01:36.210> now<00:01:36.659> who

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
use the blobs to get to zygarde now who

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.690 
use the blobs to get to zygarde now who
would<00:01:36.900> that<00:01:36.930> human<00:01:37.350> being<00:01:37.560> I<00:01:37.770> don't<00:01:38.159> know<00:01:38.369> but

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
would that human being I don't know but

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.100 
for a future video let's not forget this
is<00:05:09.190> about<00:05:09.580> the<00:05:09.790> coral<00:05:10.090> corals<00:05:10.419> gun<00:05:10.630> but<00:05:10.960> one

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.110 
is about the coral corals gun but one

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:12.420 
is about the coral corals gun but one
thing<00:05:11.290> I<00:05:11.350> wanted<00:05:11.530> to<00:05:11.590> mention<00:05:11.770> before<00:05:12.220> I<00:05:12.250> end

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430 
thing I wanted to mention before I end

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:14.820 
thing I wanted to mention before I end
this<00:05:12.520> video<00:05:12.970> is<00:05:13.210> that<00:05:13.479> speculating<00:05:14.440> isn't

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:14.830 
this video is that speculating isn't

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:16.590 
this video is that speculating isn't
something<00:05:15.040> I<00:05:15.220> do<00:05:15.280> aiming<00:05:15.880> to<00:05:16.000> be<00:05:16.120> right

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:16.600 
something I do aiming to be right

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.420 
something I do aiming to be right
of<00:05:16.750> course<00:05:17.080> I'll<00:05:17.500> only<00:05:17.800> speculate<00:05:18.340> on

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.430 
of course I'll only speculate on

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.400 
of course I'll only speculate on
something<00:05:18.490> when<00:05:19.060> it<00:05:19.180> can<00:05:19.390> be<00:05:19.570> right<00:05:19.780> but<00:05:20.080> the

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:20.410 
something when it can be right but the

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:22.560 
something when it can be right but the
whole<00:05:20.440> fun<00:05:20.860> in<00:05:21.040> speculating<00:05:21.550> is<00:05:21.970> that<00:05:22.180> nobody

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:22.570 
whole fun in speculating is that nobody

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:24.600 
whole fun in speculating is that nobody
knows<00:05:22.750> whether<00:05:23.110> it's<00:05:23.410> right<00:05:23.620> or<00:05:23.650> wrong<00:05:23.950> I<00:05:24.340> like

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.610 
knows whether it's right or wrong I like

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:26.340 
knows whether it's right or wrong I like
to<00:05:24.760> speculate<00:05:25.210> because<00:05:25.389> it<00:05:25.810> opens<00:05:26.169> my<00:05:26.320> eyes

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:26.350 
to speculate because it opens my eyes

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:28.080 
to speculate because it opens my eyes
and<00:05:26.890> lets<00:05:27.130> us<00:05:27.250> all<00:05:27.460> explore<00:05:27.970> other

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:28.090 
and lets us all explore other

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:29.880 
and lets us all explore other
possibilities<00:05:28.990> instead<00:05:29.169> of<00:05:29.410> just<00:05:29.590> sitting

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:29.890 
possibilities instead of just sitting

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:31.469 
possibilities instead of just sitting
around<00:05:30.100> and<00:05:30.370> talking<00:05:30.400> about<00:05:31.000> what<00:05:31.150> everyone

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:31.479 
around and talking about what everyone

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:33.090 
around and talking about what everyone
already<00:05:31.720> knows<00:05:31.930> and<00:05:32.320> that's<00:05:32.590> why<00:05:32.830> for<00:05:32.890> example

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:33.100 
already knows and that's why for example

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:35.370 
already knows and that's why for example
after<00:05:33.760> talking<00:05:34.450> about<00:05:34.660> the<00:05:34.810> silhouette<00:05:35.110> being

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:35.380 
after talking about the silhouette being

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:37.440 
after talking about the silhouette being
zygarde<00:05:35.890> I<00:05:36.070> took<00:05:36.460> the<00:05:36.580> creative<00:05:36.940> approach<00:05:37.210> at

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:37.450 
zygarde I took the creative approach at

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:39.570 
zygarde I took the creative approach at
it<00:05:37.600> being<00:05:37.780> the<00:05:37.900> original<00:05:38.289> dragon<00:05:38.830> and<00:05:39.039> even

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:39.580 
it being the original dragon and even

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:41.159 
it being the original dragon and even
though<00:05:39.669> that<00:05:39.850> theory<00:05:40.120> made<00:05:40.360> perfect<00:05:40.780> sense<00:05:40.840> it

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:41.169 
though that theory made perfect sense it

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:43.230 
though that theory made perfect sense it
was<00:05:41.289> still<00:05:41.530> the<00:05:41.710> unpopular<00:05:42.430> opinion<00:05:42.880> I've

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:43.240 
was still the unpopular opinion I've

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.760 
was still the unpopular opinion I've
been<00:05:43.600> right<00:05:43.840> I<00:05:43.870> guess<00:05:44.229> in<00:05:44.380> a<00:05:44.440> lot<00:05:44.470> of<00:05:44.710> these

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:44.770 
been right I guess in a lot of these

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:46.680 
been right I guess in a lot of these
speculation<00:05:45.430> videos<00:05:45.760> but<00:05:46.090> it<00:05:46.240> doesn't<00:05:46.570> matter

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:46.690 
speculation videos but it doesn't matter

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:48.630 
speculation videos but it doesn't matter
whether<00:05:46.930> I<00:05:47.050> am<00:05:47.289> or<00:05:47.320> not<00:05:47.500> because<00:05:47.979> the<00:05:48.430> whole

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:48.640 
whether I am or not because the whole

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.580 
whether I am or not because the whole
point<00:05:48.940> is<00:05:49.210> to<00:05:49.240> have<00:05:49.419> fun<00:05:49.780> in<00:05:49.960> the<00:05:50.050> discussion

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:50.590 
point is to have fun in the discussion

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:52.409 
point is to have fun in the discussion
of<00:05:50.710> what<00:05:50.919> Pokemon<00:05:51.340> has<00:05:51.460> in<00:05:51.640> store<00:05:51.850> for<00:05:52.030> us<00:05:52.150> I'm

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:52.419 
of what Pokemon has in store for us I'm

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:54.150 
of what Pokemon has in store for us I'm
not<00:05:52.630> always<00:05:52.780> making<00:05:53.200> videos<00:05:53.470> on<00:05:53.680> things<00:05:53.950> less

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:54.160 
not always making videos on things less

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.550 
not always making videos on things less
likely<00:05:54.640> but<00:05:54.669> when<00:05:55.270> I<00:05:55.300> am<00:05:55.479> speculating<00:05:56.289> just

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:56.560 
likely but when I am speculating just

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.620 
likely but when I am speculating just
remember<00:05:57.039> that<00:05:57.220> it's<00:05:57.520> to<00:05:58.090> explore<00:05:58.479> and<00:05:58.600> have

00:05:58.620 --> 00:05:58.630 
remember that it's to explore and have

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:00.360 
remember that it's to explore and have
fun<00:05:58.780> and<00:05:59.350> not<00:05:59.470> to<00:05:59.650> show<00:05:59.830> the<00:06:00.010> world<00:06:00.130> that<00:06:00.250> I

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:00.370 
fun and not to show the world that I

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:02.490 
fun and not to show the world that I
think<00:06:00.460> I'm<00:06:00.820> right<00:06:01.030> anyway<00:06:01.539> Cora<00:06:02.020> Cora<00:06:02.229> tells

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:02.500 
think I'm right anyway Cora Cora tells

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:04.230 
think I'm right anyway Cora Cora tells
us<00:06:02.740> that<00:06:02.950> the<00:06:03.220> mystery<00:06:03.580> of<00:06:03.760> these<00:06:03.940> blobby

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:04.240 
us that the mystery of these blobby

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.540

blobs and zygotes Titan form will be

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:08.159 
blobs and zygotes Titan form will be
revealed<00:06:07.030> in<00:06:07.240> the<00:06:07.330> next<00:06:07.570> edition<00:06:07.780> a<00:06:07.990> month

from now but if Cora Cora wants to do
that<00:06:10.479> that's<00:06:10.720> fine<00:06:10.930> because<00:06:11.169> the<00:06:11.620> 2015

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:12.280

within<00:06:14.620> the<00:06:14.890> next<00:06:15.160> two<00:06:15.310> weeks<00:06:15.580> and<00:06:15.850> they've

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:16.510 
within the next two weeks and they've

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:18.150 
within the next two weeks and they've
had<00:06:16.720> a<00:06:16.750> pattern<00:06:17.080> of<00:06:17.289> revealing<00:06:17.620> things<00:06:17.979> like

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:18.160 
had a pattern of revealing things like

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:19.770 
had a pattern of revealing things like
mega<00:06:18.370> kangaskhan<00:06:19.000> so<00:06:19.270> there's<00:06:19.510> a<00:06:19.539> good<00:06:19.720> chance

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:19.780 
mega kangaskhan so there's a good chance

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:21.570 
mega kangaskhan so there's a good chance
that<00:06:20.320> we<00:06:20.500> won't<00:06:20.650> need<00:06:20.860> a<00:06:20.890> wait<00:06:21.070> for<00:06:21.280> this<00:06:21.340> piece

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:21.580 
that we won't need a wait for this piece
