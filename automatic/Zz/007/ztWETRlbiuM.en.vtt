00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:05.200 

I<00:00:02.949> think<00:00:03.949> from<00:00:04.100> a<00:00:04.220> distance<00:00:04.700> this<00:00:04.880> tree<00:00:05.180> is

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:05.210 
I think from a distance this tree is

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:07.659 
I think from a distance this tree is
starting<00:00:05.660> to<00:00:05.720> look<00:00:05.840> pretty<00:00:06.020> good<00:00:06.490> but<00:00:07.490> we're

00:00:07.659 --> 00:00:07.669 
starting to look pretty good but we're

00:00:07.669 --> 00:00:09.940 
starting to look pretty good but we're
left<00:00:07.879> with<00:00:08.059> now<00:00:08.360> is<00:00:08.690> this<00:00:09.080> bush<00:00:09.410> in<00:00:09.650> front

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:09.950 
left with now is this bush in front

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:12.730 
left with now is this bush in front
corner<00:00:10.660> let's<00:00:11.660> get<00:00:11.869> that<00:00:12.080> done<00:00:12.320> and<00:00:12.469> I<00:00:12.529> think

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:12.740 
corner let's get that done and I think

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:20.510 
corner let's get that done and I think
we're<00:00:12.889> finished<00:00:14.559> get<00:00:15.559> some<00:00:15.799> Browns<00:00:16.100> in<00:00:16.369> that

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.500 

if<00:00:21.330> it's<00:00:21.570> a<00:00:21.660> very<00:00:22.080> much<00:00:22.410> in<00:00:22.620> the<00:00:22.710> foreground

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
if it's a very much in the foreground

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.360 
if it's a very much in the foreground
and<00:00:25.200> then<00:00:25.350> we're<00:00:25.500> going<00:00:25.620> to<00:00:25.680> go<00:00:25.830> over<00:00:25.860> it<00:00:26.250> with

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:26.370 
and then we're going to go over it with

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:30.440 
and then we're going to go over it with
the<00:00:26.490> green<00:00:26.670> and<00:00:26.850> the<00:00:26.910> yellow<00:00:26.940> banner<00:00:29.270> and<00:00:30.270> then

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
too although those are a little

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.479 
too although those are a little
different<00:00:45.300> because<00:00:45.629> they're<00:00:45.870> more<00:00:46.050> opaque

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489 
different because they're more opaque

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
hard is to heat it a little bit just

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.980 
hard is to heat it a little bit just
kind<00:01:11.460> of<00:01:11.520> hold<00:01:11.729> it<00:01:11.940> near<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.240> heater<00:01:12.540> I've<00:01:12.810> got

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
kind of hold it near the heater I've got

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.980 
kind of hold it near the heater I've got
a<00:01:13.020> space<00:01:13.380> heater<00:01:13.620> here<00:01:14.010> off<00:01:14.970> stage<00:01:15.330> a<00:01:15.390> bit<00:01:15.810> and

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
a space heater here off stage a bit and

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.750 
a space heater here off stage a bit and
I'm<00:01:16.110> just<00:01:16.320> holding<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.830> stick<00:01:17.100> next<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.520> it

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:17.760 
I'm just holding the stick next to it

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
stroke coming off of it now at least a

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.420 
stroke coming off of it now at least a
part<00:01:27.119> of<00:01:27.210> it<00:01:27.330> was<00:01:27.659> eating<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.950> other<00:01:29.160> thing

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
part of it was eating the other thing

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.620 
part of it was eating the other thing
that's<00:01:29.610> good<00:01:29.910> is<00:01:29.940> to<00:01:30.240> try<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:31.670> pick<00:01:32.670> up<00:01:32.820> some

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
that's good is to try and pick up some

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.840 
that's good is to try and pick up some
water<00:01:33.980> work<00:01:34.980> with<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.400> damp<00:01:36.950> tip<00:01:37.950> that<00:01:38.760> will

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
water work with the damp tip that will

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.690 
water work with the damp tip that will
change<00:01:39.120> the<00:01:39.210> texture

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
change the texture

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.740 
change the texture
ok<00:01:43.219> now<00:01:44.219> let's<00:01:44.250> bring<00:01:44.909> some<00:01:45.119> more<00:01:45.210> bring<00:01:45.509> back

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
ok now let's bring some more bring back

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.820 
ok now let's bring some more bring back
in<00:01:45.960> here

and<00:01:49.370> where<00:01:49.550> the<00:01:49.670> water<00:01:49.880> was<00:01:50.000> it's<00:01:50.840> mixing<00:01:51.500> some

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
and where the water was it's mixing some

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.950 
and where the water was it's mixing some
of<00:01:51.890> the<00:01:51.950> colors<00:01:52.250> that<00:01:52.280> we've<00:01:52.640> got<00:01:52.910> you<00:01:53.720> have<00:01:53.840> to

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
of the colors that we've got you have to

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.880 
of the colors that we've got you have to
let<00:01:54.140> it<00:01:54.290> dry<00:01:54.320> in<00:01:54.890> order<00:01:55.190> to<00:01:56.290> lay<00:01:57.290> other<00:01:57.470> colors

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
let it dry in order to lay other colors

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.270 
let it dry in order to lay other colors
over<00:01:58.310> it

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.399 

and<00:02:02.810> we're<00:02:03.810> going<00:02:03.990> to<00:02:04.049> give<00:02:04.170> a<00:02:04.200> little

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
and we're going to give a little

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.190 
and we're going to give a little
contrast<00:02:05.070> here<00:02:05.549> put<00:02:05.940> some<00:02:06.180> more<00:02:06.330> brown<00:02:06.720> too

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.800 

a<00:02:18.489> little<00:02:19.489> bit<00:02:19.640> coming<00:02:19.849> up<00:02:20.060> through<00:02:20.330> it<00:02:20.540> there

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
a little bit coming up through it there

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.280 
a little bit coming up through it there
we<00:02:21.019> go<00:02:21.230> that's<00:02:22.099> an<00:02:22.430> interesting<00:02:22.610> feature<00:02:23.290> and

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
we go that's an interesting feature and
