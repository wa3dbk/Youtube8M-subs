I'm looking at his his stance from a

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.679 
I'm looking at his his stance from a
looking<00:01:35.670> at<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.820> way<00:01:35.939> he's<00:01:36.119> positioning<00:01:36.600> the

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
looking at the way he's positioning the

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.690 
looking at the way he's positioning the
ball<00:01:36.869> you<00:01:37.710> remember<00:01:37.950> as<00:01:38.070> an<00:01:38.189> offensive<00:01:38.640> player

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
ball you remember as an offensive player

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.120 
ball you remember as an offensive player
I<00:01:39.030> always<00:01:39.360> said<00:01:39.659> you<00:01:40.350> have<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:40.710> protect<00:01:41.009> the

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
I always said you have to protect the

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.399 
I always said you have to protect the
basketball<00:01:41.579> so<00:01:42.000> if<00:01:42.150> he's<00:01:42.299> not<00:01:42.509> protecting<00:01:43.320> the

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
basketball so if he's not protecting the

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.069 
basketball so if he's not protecting the
basketball<00:01:43.590> I<00:01:44.280> can<00:01:45.149> flick<00:01:45.420> at<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.659> basketball

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
basketball I can flick at the basketball

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.620 
basketball I can flick at the basketball
so<00:01:46.710> you<00:01:46.770> look<00:01:47.009> for<00:01:47.040> that<00:01:47.310> now<00:01:48.299> if<00:01:48.420> he<00:01:48.570> is

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
so you look for that now if he is

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.330 
so you look for that now if he is
