we're always attracted to novelty so
that's<00:02:53.489> probably<00:02:53.670> going<00:02:53.879> to<00:02:53.940> happen<00:02:54.239> at

that's probably going to happen at

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
its first actually growing itself I mean

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.589 
its first actually growing itself I mean
the<00:03:07.769> brain<00:03:07.980> I<00:03:08.220> mean<00:03:08.609> earlier<00:03:09.000> in<00:03:09.269> the<00:03:09.420> in<00:03:09.569> the

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:09.599 
the brain I mean earlier in the in the

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:11.990 
the brain I mean earlier in the in the
segment<00:03:09.959> one<00:03:10.920> of<00:03:11.010> our<00:03:11.129> instructors<00:03:11.250> at<00:03:11.849> New

segment one of our instructors at New

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.580 
segment one of our instructors at New
Directions<00:03:12.120> was<00:03:12.599> saying<00:03:12.840> you<00:03:12.959> know<00:03:13.079> the<00:03:13.319> brain

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
Directions was saying you know the brain

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.289 
Directions was saying you know the brain
doesn't<00:03:13.829> come<00:03:14.129> fully<00:03:14.459> develop<00:03:14.879> like<00:03:15.120> your

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
doesn't come fully develop like your

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:17.360 
doesn't come fully develop like your
heart<00:03:15.510> or<00:03:15.720> your<00:03:15.750> liver<00:03:16.049> or<00:03:16.170> another<00:03:16.920> part<00:03:17.280> of

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
heart or your liver or another part of

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.960 
heart or your liver or another part of
your<00:03:17.549> body<00:03:17.700> it<00:03:18.510> literally<00:03:18.840> grows<00:03:19.200> itself

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
your body it literally grows itself

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.759 
your body it literally grows itself
through<00:03:20.970> repetitive<00:03:21.540> use<00:03:22.019> and<00:03:22.290> through

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
through repetitive use and through

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:25.069 
through repetitive use and through
experiences<00:03:23.730> that<00:03:23.909> the<00:03:24.060> child<00:03:24.299> is<00:03:24.540> having<00:03:24.750> and

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
experiences that the child is having and

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:28.819 
experiences that the child is having and
so<00:03:26.090> something<00:03:27.090> like<00:03:27.120> television<00:03:28.049> has<00:03:28.500> a

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:28.829 
so something like television has a

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:32.390 
so something like television has a
detrimental<00:03:29.519> effect<00:03:30.090> before<00:03:30.959> age<00:03:31.470> to<00:03:31.889> where

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
detrimental effect before age to where

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.150 
detrimental effect before age to where
maybe<00:03:32.609> at<00:03:32.910> age<00:03:33.239> five<00:03:33.690> it<00:03:34.169> actually<00:03:34.859> can<00:03:34.949> be

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
maybe at age five it actually can be

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.509 
maybe at age five it actually can be
used<00:03:35.489> as<00:03:35.760> an<00:03:36.120> educational<00:03:36.750> tool<00:03:36.989> and<00:03:37.530> I<00:03:38.310> think

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
used as an educational tool and I think

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:40.430 
used as an educational tool and I think
it's<00:03:38.669> very<00:03:38.849> confusing<00:03:39.180> to<00:03:39.690> parents<00:03:40.079> that<00:03:40.290> they

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
it's very confusing to parents that they

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.289 
it's very confusing to parents that they
don't<00:03:40.620> understand<00:03:41.099> that<00:03:41.310> difference<00:03:41.699> but<00:03:41.909> the

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
don't understand that difference but the

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:43.759 
don't understand that difference but the
research<00:03:42.659> is<00:03:42.840> finally<00:03:43.199> coming<00:03:43.470> out<00:03:43.530> this

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
research is finally coming out this

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:46.009 
research is finally coming out this
summer<00:03:43.980> and<00:03:44.280> the<00:03:44.819> Journal<00:03:45.120> of<00:03:45.209> Pediatrics<00:03:45.599> was

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
summer and the Journal of Pediatrics was

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:48.770 
summer and the Journal of Pediatrics was
a<00:03:46.049> wonderful<00:03:46.829> study<00:03:47.099> that<00:03:47.790> showed<00:03:48.150> that<00:03:48.180> the

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
a wonderful study that showed that the

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.469 
a wonderful study that showed that the
baby<00:03:48.959> Einsteins<00:03:49.560> of<00:03:49.799> the<00:03:49.919> world<00:03:50.099> all<00:03:51.090> of<00:03:51.359> the

00:03:51.469 --> 00:03:51.479 
baby Einsteins of the world all of the

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:53.780 
baby Einsteins of the world all of the
dvds<00:03:52.199> and<00:03:52.440> so<00:03:52.560> on<00:03:52.680> that<00:03:52.799> many<00:03:53.280> parents<00:03:53.519> have

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
dvds and so on that many parents have

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.520 
dvds and so on that many parents have
been<00:03:53.940> led<00:03:54.150> to<00:03:54.180> believe<00:03:54.389> that<00:03:54.870> they<00:03:54.989> can<00:03:55.019> just

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
been led to believe that they can just

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.909 
been led to believe that they can just
put<00:03:55.590> their<00:03:55.739> six-month-old<00:03:56.519> in<00:03:56.699> front<00:03:56.970> of

00:03:57.909 --> 00:03:57.919 
put their six-month-old in front of

00:03:57.919 --> 00:04:01.399 
put their six-month-old in front of
actually<00:03:58.919> delay<00:03:59.639> the<00:04:00.120> initial<00:04:00.599> onset<00:04:01.229> of

00:04:01.399 --> 00:04:01.409 
actually delay the initial onset of

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:05.000 
actually delay the initial onset of
language<00:04:02.750> now<00:04:03.750> not<00:04:04.319> that<00:04:04.470> it's<00:04:04.620> going<00:04:04.769> to<00:04:04.829> stay

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
language now not that it's going to stay

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.009 
language now not that it's going to stay
that<00:04:05.040> way<00:04:05.280> forever<00:04:05.459> one<00:04:05.940> really<00:04:06.269> important

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:07.019 
that way forever one really important

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:10.399

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
it is never too late the brain remains

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.740 
it is never too late the brain remains
very<00:04:14.010> pliable<00:04:14.310> and<00:04:14.729> plastic<00:04:15.150> throughout<00:04:15.540> the

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
very pliable and plastic throughout the

because you and I can continue to learn
new<00:04:20.130> things<00:04:20.159> as<00:04:20.669> we<00:04:21.180> age<00:04:21.389> and<00:04:21.750> that<00:04:22.460> capacity

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
new things as we age and that capacity

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.100 
new things as we age and that capacity
of<00:04:23.580> a<00:04:23.669> brain<00:04:23.940> to<00:04:24.240> respond<00:04:24.690> to<00:04:24.870> its<00:04:24.990> environment

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
of a brain to respond to its environment

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.250 
of a brain to respond to its environment
stays<00:04:25.919> so<00:04:26.789> in<00:04:26.880> other<00:04:26.970> words<00:04:27.210> people<00:04:27.930> listening

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260 
stays so in other words people listening

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
attention at any given time on a

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.570 
attention at any given time on a
trajectory<00:04:38.390> along<00:04:39.140> the<00:04:39.260> way<00:04:39.290> what<00:04:40.130> what<00:04:40.430> we

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
trajectory along the way what what we

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.080 
trajectory along the way what what we
know<00:04:40.850> is<00:04:41.210> that<00:04:41.380> brains<00:04:42.380> respond<00:04:42.980> when<00:04:43.580> people

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
know is that brains respond when people

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.270 
know is that brains respond when people
pay<00:04:44.330> lots<00:04:44.600> of<00:04:44.750> attention<00:04:44.870> to<00:04:45.410> the<00:04:45.650> individual

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:46.280 
pay lots of attention to the individual

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.280 
pay lots of attention to the individual
and<00:04:46.490> that's<00:04:46.850> true<00:04:47.210> really<00:04:47.480> probably

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:48.290 
and that's true really probably

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:51.040 
and that's true really probably
throughout<00:04:48.560> our<00:04:48.860> lifetime<00:04:49.510> and<00:04:50.510> so<00:04:50.930> the
