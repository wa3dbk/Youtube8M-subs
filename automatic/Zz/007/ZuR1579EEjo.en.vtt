00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.120 
attention visibility is one of the big
things<00:00:29.939> for<00:00:30.779> you<00:00:31.140> seeing<00:00:31.470> where<00:00:31.710> you're<00:00:31.830> going

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
but also people seeing you traction is

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.170 
but also people seeing you traction is
diminished<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:37.219> sometimes<00:00:38.219> you<00:00:38.460> overreact

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
diminished and sometimes you overreact

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.700 
diminished and sometimes you overreact
one<00:00:39.870> of<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.079> things<00:00:40.170> I'd<00:00:40.350> like<00:00:40.440> you<00:00:40.559> to<00:00:40.649> think

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
one of the things I'd like you to think

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.430 
one of the things I'd like you to think
about<00:00:40.950> is<00:00:41.129> if<00:00:41.550> it<00:00:41.820> has<00:00:42.120> not<00:00:42.149> rained<00:00:42.480> yet<00:00:43.140> in<00:00:43.350> the

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
about is if it has not rained yet in the

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.069 
about is if it has not rained yet in the
year<00:00:43.829> or<00:00:44.040> it's<00:00:44.460> been<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:44.850> really<00:00:45.180> long<00:00:45.300> time<00:00:45.510> in

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
year or it's been a really long time in

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.100 
year or it's been a really long time in
between<00:00:46.289> reigns<00:00:46.829> once<00:00:47.789> it<00:00:47.969> starts<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.629> rain<00:00:48.660> I

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
between reigns once it starts to rain I

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.110 
between reigns once it starts to rain I
almost<00:00:49.410> recommend<00:00:49.920> pulling<00:00:50.160> off<00:00:50.430> grabbing<00:00:51.059> a

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
almost recommend pulling off grabbing a

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.180 
almost recommend pulling off grabbing a
cup<00:00:51.270> of<00:00:51.360> coffee<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.840> just<00:00:51.930> hanging<00:00:52.620> out<00:00:52.890> maybe

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
cup of coffee and just hanging out maybe

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.029 
cup of coffee and just hanging out maybe
half<00:00:53.520> hour<00:00:53.699> 45<00:00:54.149> minutes<00:00:54.539> let<00:00:55.260> that<00:00:55.289> initial

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
half hour 45 minutes let that initial

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.099 
half hour 45 minutes let that initial
rain<00:00:56.280> that's<00:00:56.520> hit<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.850> road<00:00:57.030> wash<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.780> oils

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
rain that's hit the road wash the oils

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.410 
rain that's hit the road wash the oils
off<00:00:58.320> so<00:00:58.649> that<00:00:58.680> you<00:00:58.890> have<00:00:59.070> a<00:00:59.340> greater<00:00:59.910> chance<00:01:00.000> of

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
off so that you have a greater chance of

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.349
