00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:15.210
 good to prepare spears or vox 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.439
 we are going to need 400 grams of flour 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:21.750
 100 grams of water 100 grams of milk 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:24.779
 50 grams of oil 20 degrees grams of 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.840
 baker's yeast after a little 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.580
 of salt and then for the filling 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.130
 that what we like most in this 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.230
 case would be sausages and that this 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:39.149
 It can also put a little 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:42.629
 Caramelized or fried onions can be 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.550
 put a ketchup can be put good 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:52.379
 mustard what you what we 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:54.060
 we want good to start because we're going 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:58.080
 to do is to put everything 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:01:01.400
 liquids together in the thermomix 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.400
 we start with the water 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.500
 the milk 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.680
 and the oil 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:21.060
 and we will put it 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:21.060
 for one minute 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:29.100
 one minute at temperature 37 and speed 2 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:37.120
 once you no longer need we will add 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:59.360
 and we will put it for a minute 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:05.720
 one minute temperature 37 again the 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.720
 speed 6 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:20.000
 once we have finished 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:20.000
 we will add you 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.550
 the sand 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:33.819
 add the flour and a teaspoon 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.580
 and we will put it to massa 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:52.750
 try 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.750
 4 minutes 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.250
 at speed write 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.430
 LOL 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:07.470
 well once it has already sounded 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.950
 we have 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:16.050
 the mass completely made and what 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:18.330
 We will do it, we will put it on a plate or 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.490
 where it goes better and we'll leave it 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:24.120
 rest the 30 minutes covered with a 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:26.040
 good film paper but we have covered with 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.850
 film paper what we have to leave I must be 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.850
 30 minutes 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:38.900
 as we can see the mass has gone up a lot 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:42.590
 and now what we're going to do is take it out 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:44.800
 dish and let's start making a 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:48.980
 shaping it is already creating it with a roller 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:51.470
 well we have put flour to the table 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.680
 I work with marble in this case and now 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:57.700
 let's go to 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.700
 to stretch the dough 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:06.670
 neither is it necessary to leave it very thin 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:14.090
 but now we have to stretch up 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.090
 get 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.220
 what interests us 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:26.360
 once we have stretched it 

00:04:24.439 --> 00:04:30.849
 what we are going to do is in the most 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:34.259
 wide we put the Frankfurt 

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:34.259
 and over we will put 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:43.400
 the cheese and now we are going to go 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.400
 rolling 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.920
 careful in the part 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:59.140
 of the tips we have to try that 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:59.140
 always rolled up inside 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:03.889
 and once we have it right 

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:05.880
 wound put it in the tray 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:09.540
 oven 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:11.750
 and now we continue doing the rest 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:11.750
 pieces 

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:25.250
 and once we have them ready 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.980
 the day the only thing we have to do 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:30.770
 will we will leave at least an hour 

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:33.860
 so they double the volume but what 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:35.930
 it would be good if we had to get wet 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:37.970
 a little with water so that the dough 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:40.160
 that does not stay dry enress either a 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:42.140
 trick for example if you do not have a brush 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:45.200
 of these silicone so you can catch 

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:47.600
 a kitchen paper as I did with a 

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:50.360
 little bit of water and with the mojo paper 

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:52.810
 of cooking, you are going to soak the 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.810
 dough 

00:05:55.009 --> 00:05:59.869
 and that's what we're doing with everyone 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:01.939
 then we cover it with a little more 

00:05:59.869 --> 00:06:04.779
 kitchen paper with a rag that 

00:06:01.939 --> 00:06:07.249
 we have and we can put it in the oven 

00:06:04.779 --> 00:06:09.409
 good time has passed we've 

00:06:07.249 --> 00:06:12.229
 commented before and as you can see has 

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:14.419
 pretty much raised the mass now we have 

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:17.149
 put to preheat the oven to 200 

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:19.789
 degrees and when we see that it is already 

00:06:17.149 --> 00:06:21.740
 hot we will put it but above all 

00:06:19.789 --> 00:06:24.499
 before putting it what we do want is 

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:26.389
 return to spend a little water more 

00:06:24.499 --> 00:06:30.469
 that nothing so that we do not stay 

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:39.409
 present the mass and we can and coscoja 

00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:41.569
 good color we just dunked it 

00:06:39.409 --> 00:06:43.819
 again as you see how it has 

00:06:41.569 --> 00:06:46.309
 commented and now we will put it in the 

00:06:43.819 --> 00:06:48.729
 oven for about 15-20 minutes until 

00:06:46.309 --> 00:06:50.919
 that are already 

00:06:48.729 --> 00:06:53.769
 good as you can see we already have it 

00:06:50.919 --> 00:06:56.959
 just pulled out of the oven 

00:06:53.769 --> 00:06:58.539
 You see that they have stayed well golden and 

00:06:56.959 --> 00:07:02.629
 Now all you have to do is 

00:06:58.539 --> 00:07:05.479
 if ye serve as I have done 

00:07:02.629 --> 00:07:07.429
 mustard on the inside because you did not have 

00:07:05.479 --> 00:07:09.649
 to put anything else or if not then now 

00:07:07.429 --> 00:07:11.959
 you could put ketchup and good mustard what 

00:07:09.649 --> 00:07:13.129
 that you can see the result as you can 

00:07:11.959 --> 00:07:15.919
 watch 

00:07:13.129 --> 00:07:18.529
 it still comes out even in the vapor of what 

00:07:15.919 --> 00:07:21.649
 hot that is and you can see that 

00:07:18.529 --> 00:07:23.779
 we have that is totally undone and 

00:07:21.649 --> 00:07:26.119
 ready to consume I hope you have 

00:07:23.779 --> 00:07:29.319
 liked and see you the following recipe 

00:07:26.119 --> 00:07:29.319
 thank you very much see you later
