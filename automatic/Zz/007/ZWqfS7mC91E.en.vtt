you complete customizability over the
tire<00:01:47.070> width<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:47.490> height<00:01:47.700> so<00:01:48.210> as<00:01:48.360> you<00:01:48.390> can<00:01:48.570> see

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
tire width and height so as you can see

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.429 
tire width and height so as you can see
here<00:01:48.990> you<00:01:49.320> can<00:01:49.380> just<00:01:49.590> change<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.250> height<00:01:50.399> and

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:51.439 
here you can just change the height and

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:54.170 
here you can just change the height and
also<00:01:52.439> if<00:01:52.590> you<00:01:52.740> can<00:01:52.860> see<00:01:53.009> now<00:01:53.159> with<00:01:53.220> 350<00:01:54.090> you

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
also if you can see now with 350 you

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.120 
also if you can see now with 350 you
have<00:01:54.390> three<00:01:54.720> tides<00:01:54.960> but<00:01:55.530> a<00:01:55.560> lot<00:01:55.740> of<00:01:55.799> blank

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
have three tides but a lot of blank

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.440 
have three tides but a lot of blank
space<00:01:56.399> here<00:01:56.610> just<00:01:57.329> make<00:01:57.570> it<00:01:58.640> for<00:01:59.640> 25<00:02:00.180> and<00:02:00.390> you

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
space here just make it for 25 and you

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.149 
space here just make it for 25 and you
see<00:02:00.630> there's<00:02:00.930> almost<00:02:01.079> no<00:02:01.350> margin<00:02:01.680> if<00:02:01.829> you

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
see there's almost no margin if you

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.160 
see there's almost no margin if you
would<00:02:02.340> change<00:02:02.909> to<00:02:03.210> more<00:02:03.390> you<00:02:03.540> have<00:02:03.659> only<00:02:03.869> two

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
would change to more you have only two

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.069 
would change to more you have only two
but<00:02:04.979> I<00:02:05.009> think<00:02:05.340> 425<00:02:06.060> is<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.360> sweet<00:02:06.600> spot<00:02:06.630> on

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
but I think 425 is the sweet spot on

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.859 
but I think 425 is the sweet spot on
landscape<00:02:07.710> mode<00:02:07.890> and<00:02:08.000> also<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.119> same<00:02:09.330> here<00:02:09.629> as

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
landscape mode and also the same here as

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.930 
landscape mode and also the same here as
you<00:02:10.440> can<00:02:10.470> see<00:02:10.619> you<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:11.069> article<00:02:11.370> is<00:02:11.550> now<00:02:11.700> cut

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
you can see you the article is now cut

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:12.920 
you can see you the article is now cut
off<00:02:12.090> at<00:02:12.239> this<00:02:12.360> point

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
off at this point

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.809 
off at this point
and<00:02:13.079> if<00:02:13.379> you<00:02:13.500> but<00:02:13.859> if<00:02:13.980> you<00:02:14.099> change<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:14.489> height

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
and if you but if you change the height

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.440 
and if you but if you change the height
you<00:02:15.599> will<00:02:15.780> get<00:02:16.079> more<00:02:16.290> content<00:02:16.769> so<00:02:17.760> if<00:02:18.060> you<00:02:18.209> want

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
not just change the tiled height for

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.709 
not just change the tiled height for
something<00:02:25.950> bigger<00:02:26.129> and<00:02:26.609> you<00:02:26.760> can<00:02:27.000> already<00:02:27.269> see

most of the article at once I think this

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:33.140 
most of the article at once I think this
is<00:02:30.719> pretty<00:02:30.900> handy<00:02:31.349> but<00:02:32.250> once<00:02:32.519> we<00:02:32.730> enter<00:02:33.000> an

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
is pretty handy but once we enter an

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.110 
is pretty handy but once we enter an
article<00:02:33.629> the<00:02:34.500> next<00:02:34.799> options<00:02:35.159> we<00:02:35.310> have<00:02:35.340> here

right now then you have readability it

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:09.470 
right now then you have readability it
gives<00:03:07.620> you<00:03:07.739> just<00:03:07.980> the<00:03:08.129> text<00:03:08.609> so<00:03:09.030> we<00:03:09.120> won't<00:03:09.299> get

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:49.859 
smaller or make it bigger but I think

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:52.159 
smaller or make it bigger but I think
this<00:03:50.400> one<00:03:50.669> is<00:03:50.699> the<00:03:50.879> more<00:03:51.060> efficient<00:03:51.449> one<00:03:51.569> to

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:52.169
