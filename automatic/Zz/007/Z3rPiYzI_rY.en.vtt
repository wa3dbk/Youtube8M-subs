00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:01.350 
what are you going to see in a moment

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:03.139 
what are you going to see in a moment
are<00:00:01.709> some<00:00:01.890> demonstrations<00:00:02.790> in<00:00:03.030> our

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
are some demonstrations in our

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:05.390 
are some demonstrations in our
laboratory<00:00:03.449> of<00:00:04.049> some<00:00:04.110> of<00:00:04.770> the<00:00:04.830> component

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
laboratory of some of the component

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.179 
laboratory of some of the component
parts<00:00:05.790> that<00:00:06.029> make<00:00:06.210> up<00:00:06.240> fireworks<00:00:06.960> so<00:00:07.890> we're

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
parts that make up fireworks so we're

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.070 
parts that make up fireworks so we're
going<00:00:08.309> to<00:00:08.490> show<00:00:08.790> you<00:00:08.849> some<00:00:09.269> colored<00:00:09.719> flames

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
going to show you some colored flames

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.870 
going to show you some colored flames
which<00:00:10.380> will<00:00:10.559> be<00:00:10.650> colored<00:00:11.040> by<00:00:11.070> the<00:00:11.280> chemicals

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
which will be colored by the chemicals

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.970 
which will be colored by the chemicals
which<00:00:12.059> are<00:00:12.210> used<00:00:12.420> in<00:00:12.599> fireworks<00:00:13.049> to<00:00:13.710> give<00:00:13.889> you

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
which are used in fireworks to give you

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.630 
which are used in fireworks to give you
those<00:00:14.130> vivid<00:00:14.460> reds<00:00:15.000> yellows<00:00:15.389> greens<00:00:16.640> also

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
those vivid reds yellows greens also

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.429 
those vivid reds yellows greens also
we've<00:00:17.820> got<00:00:17.940> one<00:00:18.090> or<00:00:18.210> two<00:00:18.359> violent<00:00:18.869> reactions

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
we've got one or two violent reactions

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.620 
we've got one or two violent reactions
and<00:00:19.859> of<00:00:20.250> course<00:00:20.430> fireworks<00:00:20.939> are<00:00:21.180> generally

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
and of course fireworks are generally

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.820 
and of course fireworks are generally
violent<00:00:22.320> reactions<00:00:22.800> within<00:00:23.730> their

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:24.830 
violent reactions within their

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.710 
violent reactions within their
confinement<00:00:25.830> so<00:00:26.789> you'll<00:00:27.210> see<00:00:27.359> some<00:00:27.539> of<00:00:27.570> those

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
confinement so you'll see some of those

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.900 
confinement so you'll see some of those
as<00:00:27.930> well<00:00:28.080> safely<00:00:28.619> done<00:00:28.769> in<00:00:28.890> our<00:00:29.010> laboratory<00:00:29.279> so

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
as well safely done in our laboratory so

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.609 
as well safely done in our laboratory so
the<00:00:30.000> first<00:00:30.179> element<00:00:30.660> we're<00:00:30.990> going<00:00:31.140> to<00:00:31.230> use<00:00:31.439> is

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
the first element we're going to use is

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.340 
the first element we're going to use is
strontium<00:00:32.600> strontium<00:00:33.600> is<00:00:33.690> not<00:00:33.809> really<00:00:34.110> used

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
strontium strontium is not really used

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.979 
strontium strontium is not really used
for<00:00:34.590> very<00:00:34.739> much<00:00:34.980> other<00:00:35.309> than<00:00:35.630> coloring<00:00:36.630> flames

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
for very much other than coloring flames

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.500 
for very much other than coloring flames
and<00:00:37.290> making<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:38.040> red<00:00:38.219> flares<00:00:38.579> that<00:00:38.790> you<00:00:39.149> see

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
and making the red flares that you see

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.040 
and making the red flares that you see
for<00:00:40.070> rescue<00:00:41.070> operations<00:00:41.780> we're<00:00:42.780> then<00:00:42.899> going

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
for rescue operations we're then going

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.220 
for rescue operations we're then going
to<00:00:43.140> follow<00:00:43.379> that<00:00:43.649> with<00:00:44.129> sodium<00:00:45.000> which<00:00:45.329> is<00:00:45.600> such

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
to follow that with sodium which is such

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.560 
to follow that with sodium which is such
a<00:00:46.260> well-known<00:00:46.559> element<00:00:47.309> but<00:00:48.000> when<00:00:48.149> you<00:00:48.239> spray

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
a well-known element but when you spray

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.779 
a well-known element but when you spray
sodium<00:00:49.050> into<00:00:49.289> a<00:00:49.320> flame<00:00:49.770> you<00:00:50.309> get<00:00:50.520> a<00:00:50.550> more

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
sodium into a flame you get a more

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.900 
sodium into a flame you get a more
intense<00:00:51.180> yellow<00:00:52.079> so<00:00:52.440> we've<00:00:52.559> gone<00:00:52.649> from<00:00:52.890> red<00:00:53.160> to

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
intense yellow so we've gone from red to

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.240 
intense yellow so we've gone from red to
a<00:00:53.940> sort<00:00:54.270> of<00:00:54.300> yellowy<00:00:54.660> amber<00:00:55.230> color<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:55.770> then

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
a sort of yellowy amber color and then

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.709 
a sort of yellowy amber color and then
we're<00:00:56.399> going<00:00:56.489> to<00:00:56.579> follow<00:00:56.760> that<00:00:57.030> with<00:00:57.270> green

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
we're going to follow that with green

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.670 
we're going to follow that with green
and<00:00:58.500> we're<00:00:58.980> going<00:00:59.100> to<00:00:59.160> use<00:00:59.309> barium<00:00:59.989> to<00:01:00.989> color

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
and we're going to use barium to color

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.470 
and we're going to use barium to color
the<00:01:01.859> flame<00:01:02.100> green<00:01:02.520> so<00:01:02.789> that<00:01:02.910> we<00:01:02.969> get<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.120> traffic

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
the flame green so that we get a traffic

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.140 
the flame green so that we get a traffic
light<00:01:03.719> effect<00:01:04.110> in<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.350> end<00:01:04.500> it's<00:01:05.189> again<00:01:05.820> a

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
light effect in the end it's again a

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.230 
light effect in the end it's again a
fairly<00:01:06.659> unusual<00:01:07.560> element<00:01:08.430> but<00:01:08.820> it<00:01:08.970> gives<00:01:09.060> us

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
fairly unusual element but it gives us

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.480 
fairly unusual element but it gives us
that<00:01:09.360> intense<00:01:09.780> green<00:01:10.140> we're<00:01:10.950> going<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.310> look

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
that intense green we're going to look

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.870 
that intense green we're going to look
at<00:01:11.670> some<00:01:12.200> metal<00:01:13.200> powders<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:13.979> these<00:01:14.700> are

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
at some metal powders and these are

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.570 
at some metal powders and these are
often<00:01:15.180> used<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.689> make<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:16.320> golden<00:01:17.130> rain<00:01:17.369> or

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
often used to make the golden rain or

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.160 
often used to make the golden rain or
silver<00:01:18.030> rain<00:01:18.210> that<00:01:18.420> you<00:01:18.479> get<00:01:18.659> in<00:01:18.780> fireworks

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
silver rain that you get in fireworks

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.300 
silver rain that you get in fireworks
iron<00:01:20.009> when<00:01:20.670> it's<00:01:20.820> in<00:01:21.720> very<00:01:21.900> small<00:01:22.049> pieces<00:01:22.500> if

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
iron when it's in very small pieces if

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.590 
iron when it's in very small pieces if
it's<00:01:23.490> put<00:01:23.640> into<00:01:23.759> a<00:01:23.850> flame<00:01:24.119> that<00:01:24.240> will<00:01:24.299> give<00:01:24.479> you

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
it's put into a flame that will give you

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.160 
it's put into a flame that will give you
a<00:01:24.630> golden<00:01:25.170> rain<00:01:25.790> in<00:01:26.790> contrast<00:01:27.390> aluminium

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
a golden rain in contrast aluminium

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.580 
a golden rain in contrast aluminium
which<00:01:29.009> of<00:01:29.130> course<00:01:29.159> is<00:01:29.490> used<00:01:29.790> in<00:01:30.180> strong<00:01:30.840> as<00:01:31.530> a

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
which of course is used in strong as a

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.980 
which of course is used in strong as a
strong<00:01:31.860> light<00:01:32.070> material<00:01:32.670> for<00:01:33.030> aerospace<00:01:33.570> and

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
strong light material for aerospace and

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.200 
strong light material for aerospace and
other<00:01:34.500> things<00:01:34.799> something<00:01:35.159> maybe<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.640> bicycles

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
other things something maybe a bicycles

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.090 
other things something maybe a bicycles
made<00:01:36.420> of<00:01:36.540> aluminium<00:01:36.659> and<00:01:37.170> that<00:01:37.740> will<00:01:37.829> give<00:01:37.979> you

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
made of aluminium and that will give you

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.880 
made of aluminium and that will give you
a<00:01:38.130> more<00:01:38.820> intense<00:01:39.270> color<00:01:39.780> so<00:01:40.140> that's<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:40.650> sort<00:01:40.829> of

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
a more intense color so that's a sort of

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.760 
a more intense color so that's a sort of
silver<00:01:41.250> rain<00:01:41.430> rather<00:01:41.670> than<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:42.030> golden<00:01:42.420> rain

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
silver rain rather than a golden rain

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.830 
silver rain rather than a golden rain
and<00:01:43.770> then<00:01:43.920> as<00:01:44.040> a<00:01:44.070> finale<00:01:44.520> we've<00:01:45.270> got<00:01:45.420> a<00:01:45.450> strip

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
and then as a finale we've got a strip

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.889 
and then as a finale we've got a strip
of<00:01:45.960> magnesium<00:01:46.740> magnesium<00:01:47.670> is<00:01:48.240> often<00:01:48.540> used<00:01:48.720> in

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
of magnesium magnesium is often used in

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.039 
of magnesium magnesium is often used in
expensive<00:01:49.500> camera<00:01:49.950> bodies<00:01:50.310> as<00:01:51.000> a<00:01:51.060> cast<00:01:51.450> metal

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
expensive camera bodies as a cast metal

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.730 
expensive camera bodies as a cast metal
it's<00:01:52.829> very<00:01:53.220> lightweight<00:01:53.549> it's<00:01:53.970> very<00:01:54.210> strong

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
it's very lightweight it's very strong

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.679 
it's very lightweight it's very strong
but<00:01:55.740> it<00:01:55.860> does<00:01:56.130> burn<00:01:56.430> very<00:01:56.790> intensely<00:01:57.390> and

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
but it does burn very intensely and

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.690 
but it does burn very intensely and
you'll<00:01:58.049> see<00:01:58.290> a<00:01:58.320> very<00:01:58.619> intense<00:01:59.070> light<00:01:59.340> as<00:01:59.549> we

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
you'll see a very intense light as we

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.410 
you'll see a very intense light as we
burn<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.659> magnesium<00:02:01.229> strip<00:02:01.979> and<00:02:02.270> we've<00:02:03.270> got

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
burn the magnesium strip and we've got

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.910 
burn the magnesium strip and we've got
an<00:02:03.509> experiment<00:02:04.079> which<00:02:04.200> is<00:02:04.350> known<00:02:04.530> as<00:02:04.560> the

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
an experiment which is known as the

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.550 
an experiment which is known as the
thermite<00:02:05.600> experiment<00:02:06.600> or<00:02:06.810> thermite<00:02:07.530> reaction

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
thermite experiment or thermite reaction

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.360 
thermite experiment or thermite reaction
and<00:02:08.340> that's<00:02:09.020> been<00:02:10.020> used<00:02:10.319> historically<00:02:10.590> to

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
and that's been used historically to

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.850 
and that's been used historically to
weld<00:02:11.670> railway<00:02:12.599> lines<00:02:12.840> we're

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
weld railway lines we're

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.170 
weld railway lines we're
going<00:02:13.950> to<00:02:14.010> show<00:02:14.130> you<00:02:14.190> a<00:02:14.280> very<00:02:14.490> small<00:02:14.760> amount<00:02:15.090> of

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
going to show you a very small amount of

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.670 
going to show you a very small amount of
that<00:02:15.330> because<00:02:15.450> it's<00:02:15.660> an<00:02:15.720> incredibly<00:02:16.200> vigorous

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
that because it's an incredibly vigorous

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.940 
that because it's an incredibly vigorous
reaction<00:02:16.860> and<00:02:17.600> finally<00:02:18.600> we<00:02:19.290> hope<00:02:19.500> to<00:02:19.680> show<00:02:19.890> you

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
reaction and finally we hope to show you

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.460 
reaction and finally we hope to show you
a<00:02:21.200> chemical<00:02:22.200> volcano<00:02:22.920> and<00:02:23.570> this<00:02:24.570> is<00:02:24.810> a

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
a chemical volcano and this is a

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.900 
a chemical volcano and this is a
substance<00:02:26.220> which<00:02:26.400> when<00:02:26.970> we<00:02:27.450> heat<00:02:27.660> it<00:02:27.740> produces

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
substance which when we heat it produces

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.750 
substance which when we heat it produces
an<00:02:29.910> effect<00:02:30.330> that<00:02:30.420> looks<00:02:30.780> like<00:02:30.990> a<00:02:31.050> volcano

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
an effect that looks like a volcano

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.550 
an effect that looks like a volcano
years<00:02:32.760> ago<00:02:33.000> they<00:02:33.150> used<00:02:33.180> to<00:02:33.450> be<00:02:33.600> used<00:02:33.960> as<00:02:34.200> indoor

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
years ago they used to be used as indoor

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.950 
years ago they used to be used as indoor
fireworks<00:02:34.970> but<00:02:35.970> because<00:02:36.270> they<00:02:36.420> it's<00:02:36.660> in<00:02:36.780> fact

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
fireworks but because they it's in fact

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.750 
fireworks but because they it's in fact
a<00:02:37.110> very<00:02:37.290> toxic<00:02:37.530> substance<00:02:38.190> it's<00:02:38.400> no<00:02:38.520> longer

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
a very toxic substance it's no longer

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.630 
a very toxic substance it's no longer
used<00:02:39.210> so<00:02:39.900> only<00:02:40.320> the<00:02:40.530> older<00:02:40.920> members<00:02:41.040> who<00:02:41.459> are

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
used so only the older members who are

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.160 
used so only the older members who are
looking<00:02:41.910> at<00:02:42.030> this<00:02:42.150> can<00:02:42.450> perhaps<00:02:42.600> remember

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
looking at this can perhaps remember

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.140 
looking at this can perhaps remember
those<00:02:43.320> little<00:02:43.470> volcanoes<00:02:44.130> used<00:02:44.430> to<00:02:44.580> get<00:02:44.760> in

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
those little volcanoes used to get in

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.660 
those little volcanoes used to get in
christmas<00:02:45.570> crackers<00:02:45.990> all<00:02:46.110> those<00:02:46.290> years<00:02:46.470> ago

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
christmas crackers all those years ago

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.220 
christmas crackers all those years ago
we<00:02:47.670> now<00:02:47.820> have<00:02:48.000> to<00:02:48.120> do<00:02:48.240> it<00:02:48.360> very<00:02:48.510> carefully<00:02:48.780> in<00:02:49.080> a

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
we now have to do it very carefully in a

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.110 
we now have to do it very carefully in a
fume<00:02:49.470> hood<00:02:49.500> because<00:02:50.250> of<00:02:50.370> the<00:02:50.490> toxicity<00:02:51.090> of

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
fume hood because of the toxicity of

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.470 
fume hood because of the toxicity of
those<00:02:51.420> materials<00:02:52.760> not<00:02:53.760> to<00:02:53.880> say<00:02:54.030> that<00:02:54.209> all<00:02:54.450> of

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
those materials not to say that all of

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.479 
those materials not to say that all of
chemistry<00:02:55.200> is<00:02:55.410> just<00:02:55.860> about<00:02:56.070> fireworks

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
chemistry is just about fireworks

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:57.920 
chemistry is just about fireworks
there's<00:02:56.760> so<00:02:56.910> many<00:02:57.000> other<00:02:57.180> things<00:02:57.300> too<00:02:57.720> it's<00:02:57.870> a

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
there's so many other things too it's a

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.750 
there's so many other things too it's a
really<00:02:58.080> fascinating<00:02:58.320> subject<00:02:59.040> but<00:02:59.550> certainly

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
really fascinating subject but certainly

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.240 
really fascinating subject but certainly
the<00:02:59.970> fireworks<00:03:00.360> helped<00:03:00.780> in<00:03:00.959> inspiring<00:03:01.950> me<00:03:02.220> to

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
the fireworks helped in inspiring me to

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.930 
the fireworks helped in inspiring me to
take<00:03:02.970> a<00:03:03.000> career<00:03:03.300> in<00:03:03.330> chemistry
