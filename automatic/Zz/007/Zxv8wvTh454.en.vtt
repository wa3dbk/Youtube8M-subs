00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:08.509 
Virginia this morning I'd like to talk a
little<00:00:07.259> bit<00:00:07.470> about<00:00:07.500> vibrato<00:00:08.220> as<00:00:08.429> an

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
little bit about vibrato as an

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.280 
little bit about vibrato as an
expressive<00:00:08.880> device<00:00:09.330> and<00:00:09.690> I<00:00:09.809> know<00:00:09.870> that<00:00:10.080> if<00:00:10.230> I

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
expressive device and I know that if I

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.140 
expressive device and I know that if I
brought<00:00:10.440> is<00:00:10.590> a<00:00:10.620> very<00:00:10.830> subjective<00:00:11.040> issue<00:00:11.550> and

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
brought is a very subjective issue and

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.580 
brought is a very subjective issue and
it's<00:00:12.690> something<00:00:12.870> that<00:00:12.990> everybody's<00:00:13.410> probably

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
it's something that everybody's probably

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.499 
it's something that everybody's probably
got<00:00:13.769> a<00:00:13.799> different<00:00:14.160> opinion<00:00:14.910> on<00:00:15.179> a<00:00:15.210> different

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
got a different opinion on a different

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.210 
got a different opinion on a different
interpretation<00:00:15.780> on<00:00:16.410> how<00:00:16.650> to<00:00:16.710> do<00:00:16.920> it<00:00:17.039> but<00:00:17.130> I

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
interpretation on how to do it but I

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.529 
interpretation on how to do it but I
like<00:00:17.340> to<00:00:17.369> just<00:00:17.789> to<00:00:17.910> kind<00:00:18.180> of<00:00:18.240> express<00:00:18.510> a

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
like to just to kind of express a

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:19.880 
like to just to kind of express a
different<00:00:18.750> viewpoint<00:00:19.050> on<00:00:19.350> how<00:00:19.680> you<00:00:19.740> can

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
different viewpoint on how you can

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.560 
different viewpoint on how you can
produce<00:00:20.039> a<00:00:20.220> vibrato<00:00:20.490> if<00:00:21.000> I<00:00:21.119> brought<00:00:21.300> it<00:00:21.420> on<00:00:21.510> the

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
produce a vibrato if I brought it on the

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.509 
produce a vibrato if I brought it on the
saxophone<00:00:22.050> is<00:00:22.230> produced<00:00:22.859> different<00:00:23.340> than<00:00:23.430> it

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
saxophone is produced different than it

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.230 
saxophone is produced different than it
is<00:00:23.609> on<00:00:23.760> any<00:00:23.850> other<00:00:24.000> wind<00:00:24.210> instrument<00:00:25.130> the<00:00:26.150> on<00:00:27.150> a

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
is on any other wind instrument the on a

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.640 
is on any other wind instrument the on a
flute<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.750> vibrato<00:00:28.019> is<00:00:28.199> produced<00:00:28.500> with<00:00:28.619> a

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
flute the vibrato is produced with a

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.830 
flute the vibrato is produced with a
diaphragm<00:00:29.160> from<00:00:29.460> from<00:00:29.849> down<00:00:30.029> here<00:00:30.300> on<00:00:30.449> the

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
diaphragm from from down here on the

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.810 
diaphragm from from down here on the
trumpet<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.320> vibrato<00:00:31.800> is<00:00:31.980> produced<00:00:32.340> course

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
trumpet the vibrato is produced course

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.400 
trumpet the vibrato is produced course
with<00:00:33.000> with<00:00:33.450> moving<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:33.930> fingers<00:00:34.200> on<00:00:34.320> the

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
with with moving the fingers on the

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.870 
with with moving the fingers on the
valves<00:00:34.739> trombone<00:00:35.100> of<00:00:35.250> course<00:00:35.430> with<00:00:35.550> a<00:00:35.579> slide

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
valves trombone of course with a slide

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.760 
valves trombone of course with a slide
but<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.750> saxophone<00:00:37.200> is<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.380> only<00:00:37.590> wind

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
but the saxophone is the only wind

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.920 
but the saxophone is the only wind
instrument<00:00:38.219> where<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:38.879> vibrato<00:00:39.180> is<00:00:39.420> the

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
instrument where the vibrato is the

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.049 
instrument where the vibrato is the
vibrato<00:00:40.170> is<00:00:40.410> produced<00:00:40.739> with<00:00:41.100> just<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:41.879> lower

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
vibrato is produced with just the lower

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.560 
vibrato is produced with just the lower
jaw<00:00:42.329> so<00:00:42.629> usually<00:00:42.870> we<00:00:43.290> teach<00:00:43.500> that<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.450> use<00:00:45.450> the

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
jaw so usually we teach that the use the

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.270 
jaw so usually we teach that the use the
lower<00:00:45.719> jaw<00:00:45.930> for<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.350> vibrato<00:00:46.649> and<00:00:46.920> then<00:00:47.039> after

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
lower jaw for the vibrato and then after

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.400 
lower jaw for the vibrato and then after
you<00:00:47.370> get<00:00:47.489> used<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:47.940> concept<00:00:48.360> then<00:00:49.020> you<00:00:49.260> can

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
you get used to the concept then you can

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.350 
you get used to the concept then you can
the<00:00:49.950> vibrato<00:00:50.309> can<00:00:50.550> be<00:00:50.640> created<00:00:50.940> with<00:00:50.969> just<00:00:51.090> the

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
the vibrato can be created with just the

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.150 
the vibrato can be created with just the
lower<00:00:51.510> lip<00:00:51.780> but<00:00:52.289> it<00:00:52.410> is<00:00:52.500> a<00:00:52.530> lower<00:00:52.739> lip<00:00:52.980> and

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
lower lip but it is a lower lip and

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.689 
lower lip but it is a lower lip and
lowered<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:53.820> in<00:00:54.480> ja-ja<00:00:55.170> vibrato<00:00:55.579> the<00:00:56.579> other

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
lowered and in ja-ja vibrato the other

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.069 
lowered and in ja-ja vibrato the other
thing<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:56.940> keep<00:00:57.059> in<00:00:57.180> mind<00:00:57.239> with<00:00:57.539> saxophone

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
thing to keep in mind with saxophone

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.080 
thing to keep in mind with saxophone
vibrato<00:00:58.469> is<00:00:58.770> that<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.399> pitch<00:00:59.699> can<00:00:59.910> only

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
vibrato is that the the pitch can only

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.090 
vibrato is that the the pitch can only
come<00:01:00.359> up<00:01:00.390> where<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:00.960> vibrato<00:01:01.260> can<00:01:01.379> only<00:01:01.770> come

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
come up where the vibrato can only come

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.860 
come up where the vibrato can only come
up<00:01:02.219> to<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.460> pitch<00:01:02.609> level<00:01:02.969> this<00:01:03.449> is<00:01:03.510> a<00:01:03.690> pitch

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
up to the pitch level this is a pitch

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.050 
up to the pitch level this is a pitch
level<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.320> vibrato<00:01:04.589> comes<00:01:04.860> down<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.400> back<00:01:06.030> up

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
level the vibrato comes down and back up

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.300 
level the vibrato comes down and back up
and<00:01:06.360> it<00:01:06.750> can't<00:01:06.960> go<00:01:07.110> above<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.530> pitch<00:01:07.710> like<00:01:08.189> you

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
and it can't go above the pitch like you

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.000 
and it can't go above the pitch like you
can<00:01:08.520> another<00:01:08.820> wind<00:01:09.030> instruments<00:01:09.830> so<00:01:10.830> what<00:01:10.979> I

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
can another wind instruments so what I

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.460 
can another wind instruments so what I
usually<00:01:11.220> do<00:01:11.430> with<00:01:11.549> my<00:01:11.670> students<00:01:12.060> is<00:01:12.350> have<00:01:13.350> them

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
usually do with my students is have them

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.560 
usually do with my students is have them
play<00:01:13.650> an<00:01:13.830> octave<00:01:13.979> G<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.549> then<00:01:14.939> as<00:01:15.119> I<00:01:15.210> lower<00:01:15.390> my

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
play an octave G and then as I lower my

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.289 
play an octave G and then as I lower my
hand<00:01:15.780> they<00:01:15.900> lower<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.229> pitch

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.789 

and<00:01:21.930> then<00:01:22.079> when<00:01:22.200> you<00:01:22.289> bring<00:01:22.380> your<00:01:22.530> hand<00:01:22.680> up

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
and then when you bring your hand up

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.139 
and then when you bring your hand up
they'll<00:01:22.979> find<00:01:23.219> that<00:01:23.429> they<00:01:23.549> can't<00:01:23.759> raise<00:01:23.939> the

00:01:24.139 --> 00:01:24.149 
they'll find that they can't raise the

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:25.520 
they'll find that they can't raise the
picture<00:01:24.420> at<00:01:24.479> all<00:01:24.509> you<00:01:24.630> can't<00:01:24.810> again<00:01:25.259> you<00:01:25.350> can't

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
picture at all you can't again you can't

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.149 
picture at all you can't again you can't
raise<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.859> pitch<00:01:25.950> on<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.159> saxophone

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:30.159 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:31.980 

you<00:01:30.880> can<00:01:30.999> pinch<00:01:31.240> and<00:01:31.450> bring<00:01:31.689> it<00:01:31.810> up<00:01:31.899> to

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
you can pinch and bring it up to

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.480 
you can pinch and bring it up to
slightly<00:01:32.380> but<00:01:32.560> basically<00:01:32.890> the<00:01:33.159> vibrato

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
slightly but basically the vibrato

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.789 
slightly but basically the vibrato
starts<00:01:33.969> at<00:01:34.119> one<00:01:34.270> flat<00:01:34.990> line<00:01:35.200> and<00:01:35.229> comes<00:01:35.619> down

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:35.799 
starts at one flat line and comes down

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:57.870 

you<00:01:56.859> want<00:01:57.039> to<00:01:57.099> be<00:01:57.159> careful<00:01:57.490> with<00:01:57.609> them<00:01:57.759> to

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
you want to be careful with them to

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.399 
you want to be careful with them to
shape<00:01:58.090> the<00:01:58.240> vibrato<00:01:58.569> shape<00:01:58.869> the<00:01:59.020> downward

curve of the wave of the vibrato and

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.899 
curve of the wave of the vibrato and
make<00:02:02.799> sure<00:02:02.920> that<00:02:03.039> it<00:02:03.159> doesn't<00:02:03.310> get<00:02:03.459> too<00:02:03.610> fast

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
make sure that it doesn't get too fast

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:06.479 
make sure that it doesn't get too fast
or<00:02:04.090> too<00:02:04.119> thin<00:02:04.479> usually<00:02:05.229> you<00:02:05.349> get<00:02:05.489> especially

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:06.489 
or too thin usually you get especially

00:02:06.489 --> 00:02:07.709 
or too thin usually you get especially
with<00:02:06.579> a<00:02:06.670> young<00:02:06.700> student<00:02:07.090> you<00:02:07.360> end<00:02:07.509> up<00:02:07.599> with

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:07.719 
with a young student you end up with

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:09.990 
with a young student you end up with
vibrato<00:02:08.110> sometimes<00:02:09.039> that's<00:02:09.310> too<00:02:09.429> fast<00:02:09.670> and

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000

exercise<00:03:12.450> you'll<00:03:13.450> notice<00:03:13.720> that<00:03:13.840> some<00:03:14.079> notes

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
exercise you'll notice that some notes

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:36.759 
exercise you'll notice that some notes
have<00:03:14.470> I<00:03:14.590> brought<00:03:14.799> on<00:03:14.950> some<00:03:15.129> of<00:03:15.220> them<00:03:15.310> don't

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:36.769 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:38.869 

so<00:03:37.769> you<00:03:37.829> notice<00:03:38.159> that<00:03:38.189> the<00:03:38.489> use<00:03:38.700> of<00:03:38.819> the

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:38.879 
so you notice that the use of the

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:40.610 
so you notice that the use of the
vibrato<00:03:39.150> doesn't<00:03:39.780> always<00:03:39.930> have<00:03:40.170> anything<00:03:40.470> to

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
vibrato doesn't always have anything to

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.979 
vibrato doesn't always have anything to
do<00:03:40.769> with<00:03:41.040> the<00:03:41.700> note<00:03:41.879> with<00:03:42.360> the<00:03:42.510> the<00:03:42.720> length<00:03:42.870> of

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:45.599 
you put the vibrato on the longer notes

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:46.970 
you put the vibrato on the longer notes
the<00:03:45.780> half<00:03:45.930> notes<00:03:46.170> and<00:03:46.379> you<00:03:46.470> wouldn't<00:03:46.769> put<00:03:46.890> the

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
the half notes and you wouldn't put the

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.190 
the half notes and you wouldn't put the
vibrato<00:03:47.250> in<00:03:47.459> the<00:03:47.519> moving<00:03:47.849> eighth<00:03:47.970> notes<00:03:48.209> but
