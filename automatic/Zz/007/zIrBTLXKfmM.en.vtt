for how to apply to graphics several

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.529 
for how to apply to graphics several
different<00:01:52.859> ways<00:01:53.039> I'm<00:01:53.880> kind<00:01:54.210> of<00:01:54.270> old-school

00:01:54.529 --> 00:01:54.539 
different ways I'm kind of old-school

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:57.289 
different ways I'm kind of old-school
and<00:01:54.899> I<00:01:55.020> like<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.439> wet<00:01:55.619> method<00:01:55.920> this<00:01:56.850> bottle

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
and I like the wet method this bottle

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.090 
and I like the wet method this bottle
cost<00:01:57.539> a<00:01:57.719> few<00:01:57.899> bucks<00:01:57.960> but<00:01:58.409> it<00:01:58.469> makes<00:01:58.679> life<00:01:58.920> a

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
cost a few bucks but it makes life a

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.219 
cost a few bucks but it makes life a
whole<00:01:59.130> lot<00:01:59.310> easier<00:01:59.490> on<00:01:59.939> installing<00:02:00.569> graphics

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
whole lot easier on installing graphics

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.950 
whole lot easier on installing graphics
I<00:02:01.549> get<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:02.639> graphic<00:02:03.060> place<00:02:03.329> and<00:02:03.689> then<00:02:03.780> use

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
I get the graphic place and then use

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.129 
I get the graphic place and then use
masking<00:02:04.469> tape<00:02:04.530> to<00:02:04.770> make<00:02:05.039> a<00:02:05.069> hinge<00:02:05.840> then<00:02:06.840> I<00:02:06.929> wet

00:02:07.129 --> 00:02:07.139 
masking tape to make a hinge then I wet

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:08.719 
masking tape to make a hinge then I wet
the<00:02:07.170> area<00:02:07.409> where<00:02:07.710> the<00:02:07.799> graphics<00:02:08.250> going<00:02:08.490> to<00:02:08.580> go

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
slow and make sure you pull a tape at a

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.960 
slow and make sure you pull a tape at a
very<00:02:43.270> steep<00:02:43.630> angle<00:02:44.100> the<00:02:45.100> graphic<00:02:45.520> might<00:02:45.700> try

very steep angle the graphic might try

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.370 
very steep angle the graphic might try
and<00:02:46.030> lift<00:02:46.330> a<00:02:46.480> little<00:02:46.630> bit<00:02:46.750> when<00:02:46.990> you're<00:02:47.080> doing

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
and lift a little bit when you're doing

and lift a little bit when you're doing
this<00:02:47.470> but<00:02:47.680> that's<00:02:47.860> easily<00:02:48.070> smooth<00:02:48.550> back<00:02:48.850> down

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
this but that's easily smooth back down
