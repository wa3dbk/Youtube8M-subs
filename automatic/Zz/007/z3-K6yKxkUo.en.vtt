have<00:01:52.110> nothing<00:01:52.320> now<00:01:52.619> and<00:01:52.890> I<00:01:53.250> scan<00:01:53.490> for<00:01:53.759> zero

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
have nothing now and I scan for zero

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.690 
have nothing now and I scan for zero
next<00:01:54.600> and<00:01:54.960> at<00:01:55.619> this<00:01:55.770> point<00:01:56.070> you<00:01:56.310> should<00:01:56.340> have

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
next and at this point you should have

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.120 
next and at this point you should have
maybe<00:01:57.030> five<00:01:57.750> addresses<00:01:58.409> or<00:01:58.560> so<00:01:58.770> left<00:01:59.070> in<00:01:59.369> your

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
maybe five addresses or so left in your

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.649 
maybe five addresses or so left in your
this<00:02:02.130> I<00:02:02.369> have<00:02:02.549> two<00:02:02.880> so<00:02:03.210> I'm<00:02:03.270> going<00:02:03.420> to<00:02:03.450> copy

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
this I have two so I'm going to copy

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.719 
this I have two so I'm going to copy
both<00:02:03.930> of<00:02:04.140> those<00:02:04.290> I<00:02:04.560> already<00:02:05.310> can<00:02:05.520> see<00:02:05.700> that

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
both of those I already can see that

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.249 
both of those I already can see that
this<00:02:06.000> is<00:02:06.180> not<00:02:06.329> the<00:02:06.450> right<00:02:06.570> one<00:02:06.780> because<00:02:07.079> it

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
this is not the right one because it

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.930 
this is not the right one because it
keeps<00:02:07.439> changing<00:02:07.619> even<00:02:08.429> though<00:02:08.670> I'm<00:02:08.759> not

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
keeps changing even though I'm not

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.150 
keeps changing even though I'm not
changing<00:02:09.239> anything<00:02:09.479> but<00:02:10.259> anyway<00:02:10.590> if<00:02:10.800> you<00:02:10.979> have

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
changing anything but anyway if you have

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.710 
changing anything but anyway if you have
like<00:02:11.400> five<00:02:11.700> addresses<00:02:12.270> you're<00:02:12.480> going<00:02:12.629> to

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
like five addresses you're going to

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.850 
like five addresses you're going to
double<00:02:13.050> click<00:02:13.230> all<00:02:13.530> of

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
double click all of

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.630 
double click all of
and<00:02:15.170> what<00:02:16.170> we're<00:02:16.320> going<00:02:16.500> to<00:02:16.590> do<00:02:16.680> right<00:02:16.830> now<00:02:17.070> the

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
and what we're going to do right now the

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.110 
and what we're going to do right now the
game<00:02:17.820> thinks<00:02:18.750> that<00:02:19.500> in<00:02:19.830> this<00:02:20.130> lot<00:02:20.520> that<00:02:20.970> is

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
game thinks that in this lot that is

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.180 
game thinks that in this lot that is
nothing<00:02:21.540> in<00:02:21.750> it<00:02:21.900> so<00:02:22.200> what<00:02:22.380> it<00:02:22.500> does<00:02:22.650> it<00:02:22.950> says

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
nothing in it so what it does it says

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.430 
nothing in it so what it does it says
it's<00:02:23.430> zero<00:02:23.760> nothing<00:02:24.360> in<00:02:24.510> it<00:02:24.630> so<00:02:25.170> what<00:02:25.320> we're

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
it's zero nothing in it so what we're

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.660 
it's zero nothing in it so what we're
going<00:02:25.590> to<00:02:25.650> do<00:02:25.800> we're<00:02:25.920> going<00:02:25.950> to<00:02:26.100> change<00:02:26.430> it

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
going to do we're going to change it

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.420 
going to do we're going to change it
what<00:02:27.420> should<00:02:27.630> we<00:02:27.780> change<00:02:28.050> it<00:02:28.260> to<00:02:28.470> well<00:02:29.280> we

what should we change it to well we
could<00:02:29.580> change<00:02:29.730> it<00:02:29.910> to<00:02:30.030> anything<00:02:30.300> let's<00:02:30.720> see

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
could change it to anything let's see

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.000 
could change it to anything let's see
forty<00:02:31.590> four<00:02:31.860> and<00:02:32.930> if<00:02:33.930> you<00:02:34.170> have<00:02:34.350> if<00:02:34.620> you<00:02:34.830> had

forty four and if you have if you had
multiple<00:02:35.280> addresses<00:02:35.940> just<00:02:36.330> change<00:02:36.840> all<00:02:37.080> of

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
multiple addresses just change all of

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.320 
multiple addresses just change all of
them<00:02:37.350> to<00:02:37.530> forty<00:02:37.890> four<00:02:38.160> and<00:02:38.400> what<00:02:39.000> you<00:02:39.150> should

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
them to forty four and what you should

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.010 
them to forty four and what you should
find<00:02:39.570> is<00:02:39.840> this<00:02:40.140> weird<00:02:40.680> key<00:02:41.100> apparently<00:02:42.020> it's

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
find is this weird key apparently it's

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.840 
find is this weird key apparently it's
old<00:02:43.260> key<00:02:43.620> okay<00:02:44.280> let's<00:02:44.490> change<00:02:44.640> it<00:02:44.820> to

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
old key okay let's change it to

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.750 
old key okay let's change it to
something<00:02:45.150> else<00:02:45.360> maybe<00:02:45.720> like<00:02:45.990> ten<00:02:46.320> oh<00:02:46.670> look<00:02:47.670> at

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
something else maybe like ten oh look at

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.630 
something else maybe like ten oh look at
that<00:02:47.790> I<00:02:47.940> just<00:02:48.210> pawned<00:02:48.510> a<00:02:48.660> bazooka<00:02:49.050> or<00:02:49.440> a<00:02:49.640> rocket

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
that I just pawned a bazooka or a rocket

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.290 
that I just pawned a bazooka or a rocket
launcher<00:02:51.890> so<00:02:52.890> I<00:02:52.920> can<00:02:53.190> just<00:02:53.370> put<00:02:53.610> it<00:02:53.730> in<00:02:53.850> here<00:02:54.090> if

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
launcher so I can just put it in here if

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.300 
launcher so I can just put it in here if
I<00:02:54.420> want<00:02:54.660> to<00:02:54.840> and<00:02:55.110> it<00:02:55.740> just<00:02:55.770> can't<00:02:56.190> keep

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
I want to and it just can't keep

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.090 
I want to and it just can't keep
spawning<00:02:56.910> items<00:02:57.480> this<00:02:57.720> way<00:02:57.960> remember<00:02:58.830> if<00:02:58.980> you

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
spawning items this way remember if you

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.850 
spawning items this way remember if you
have<00:02:59.280> multiple<00:03:00.090> addresses<00:03:00.390> just<00:03:01.200> change<00:03:01.620> all

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
have multiple addresses just change all

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.700 
have multiple addresses just change all
of<00:03:02.100> them<00:03:02.250> until<00:03:03.240> one<00:03:03.570> of<00:03:03.720> them<00:03:03.900> works<00:03:04.200> I<00:03:04.560> know

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:04.710 
of them until one of them works I know

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:07.310 
of them until one of them works I know
that<00:03:05.010> this<00:03:05.190> one<00:03:05.430> works<00:03:05.730> for<00:03:06.000> me<00:03:06.270> so<00:03:07.140> I'm<00:03:07.200> going

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
that this one works for me so I'm going

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.130 
that this one works for me so I'm going
to<00:03:07.410> change<00:03:07.650> it<00:03:07.770> to<00:03:07.800> maybe<00:03:07.980> 64<00:03:08.850> what<00:03:09.240> it's<00:03:09.540> this

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
to change it to maybe 64 what it's this

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.580 
to change it to maybe 64 what it's this
is<00:03:10.380> what<00:03:10.920> is<00:03:11.040> this<00:03:11.420> stone<00:03:12.420> ring<00:03:12.750> okay<00:03:13.440> it's

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
is what is this stone ring okay it's

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.430 
is what is this stone ring okay it's
probably<00:03:14.160> used<00:03:14.940> somewhere<00:03:15.420> so<00:03:16.110> that's<00:03:16.290> the

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
probably used somewhere so that's the

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.340 
probably used somewhere so that's the
way<00:03:16.590> you<00:03:16.650> can<00:03:16.980> hack<00:03:17.220> items<00:03:17.730> in<00:03:17.910> this<00:03:18.030> game<00:03:18.350> I'm

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
way you can hack items in this game I'm

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.680 
way you can hack items in this game I'm
pretty<00:03:19.890> sure<00:03:20.160> you<00:03:20.280> can<00:03:20.430> find<00:03:20.700> ammo<00:03:21.209> as<00:03:21.420> well

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
pretty sure you can find ammo as well

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.960 
pretty sure you can find ammo as well
and<00:03:22.850> yeah<00:03:25.010> that's<00:03:26.010> the<00:03:26.190> way<00:03:26.370> it<00:03:26.489> works<00:03:26.730> I<00:03:26.940> guess

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
and yeah that's the way it works I guess

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.770 
and yeah that's the way it works I guess
so<00:03:27.300> 3<00:03:27.720> is<00:03:27.989> handgun<00:03:28.760> if<00:03:29.760> you<00:03:29.910> want<00:03:30.150> a<00:03:30.330> handgun

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
so 3 is handgun if you want a handgun

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.320 
so 3 is handgun if you want a handgun
