and I think diversity not just about
racial<00:03:50.690> or<00:03:50.780> ethnicity<00:03:50.920> differences<00:03:51.920> flow<00:03:52.190> so

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:52.460 
racial or ethnicity differences flow so

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:55.390 
racial or ethnicity differences flow so
about<00:03:52.730> differences<00:03:53.270> in<00:03:53.710> opinions<00:03:54.710> and<00:03:55.310> I

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
about differences in opinions and I

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.790 
about differences in opinions and I
think<00:03:55.670> that<00:03:55.940> diversity<00:03:56.150> open<00:03:56.870> really<00:03:57.200> I<00:03:57.410> mean

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:57.800 
think that diversity open really I mean

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.850 
think that diversity open really I mean
really<00:03:57.980> opened<00:03:58.430> my<00:03:59.030> mind<00:03:59.239> and<00:03:59.750> perspective<00:04:00.739> up
