00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.080 
already down to the 30s 39 degrees so
looks<00:00:55.140> like<00:00:55.199> we<00:00:55.410> will<00:00:55.620> reach<00:00:56.100> freezing<00:00:56.820> again

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
looks like we will reach freezing again

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.880 
looks like we will reach freezing again
freezing<00:00:57.539> being<00:00:57.750> 32<00:00:58.050> degrees<00:00:58.469> but<00:00:58.620> looks<00:00:58.829> like

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
freezing being 32 degrees but looks like

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.439 
freezing being 32 degrees but looks like
we<00:00:59.100> could<00:00:59.250> even<00:00:59.430> reach<00:00:59.699> welt<00:00:59.969> sub-freezing

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
we could even reach welt sub-freezing

we could even reach welt sub-freezing

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
temperatures into the overnight hours so

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:03.470 
temperatures into the overnight hours so
we'll<00:01:02.489> have<00:01:02.579> more<00:01:02.760> on<00:01:02.820> that<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.180> of<00:01:03.239> course

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
we'll have more on that and of course

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
that's just for the high desert so we're

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.830 
that's just for the high desert so we're

take it up to the high desert we're

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.580 
take it up to the high desert we're
looking<00:01:39.479> at<00:01:39.570> a<00:01:39.600> freeze<00:01:39.810> warning<00:01:39.990> again<00:01:40.380> in

looking at a freeze warning again in
effect<00:01:40.920> they're<00:01:41.159> going<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:41.640> affect<00:01:41.939> actually

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
effect they're going to affect actually

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.870 
effect they're going to affect actually
to<00:01:42.479> be<00:01:42.570> specific<00:01:43.049> 3am<00:01:43.619> lasting<00:01:44.280> through<00:01:44.430> 9am

to be specific 3am lasting through 9am

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.520 
to be specific 3am lasting through 9am
sub-freezing<00:01:45.329> temperatures<00:01:45.780> we<00:01:46.350> could

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
sub-freezing temperatures we could

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.710 
sub-freezing temperatures we could
potentially<00:01:46.649> see<00:01:47.189> 20s<00:01:47.850> in<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.240> forecast

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
potentially see 20s in the forecast

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:49.910 
potentially see 20s in the forecast
tonight<00:01:48.990> so<00:01:49.259> it's<00:01:49.380> going<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:49.560> start<00:01:49.680> to<00:01:49.799> become

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
tonight so it's going to start to become

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.289 
tonight so it's going to start to become
a<00:01:50.040> little<00:01:50.220> typical<00:01:50.610> we<00:01:50.729> start<00:01:50.939> to<00:01:51.030> see<00:01:51.060> these

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
a little typical we start to see these

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.600 
a little typical we start to see these
very<00:01:51.420> cool<00:01:51.780> nights<00:01:52.049> as<00:01:52.320> we<00:01:52.829> had<00:01:53.009> well<00:01:53.310> inch

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
very cool nights as we had well inch

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.789 
very cool nights as we had well inch
closer<00:01:53.909> to<00:01:54.119> winter<00:01:54.299> not<00:01:54.540> quite<00:01:54.780> there<00:01:54.990> yet<00:01:55.020> but

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
closer to winter not quite there yet but

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.859 
closer to winter not quite there yet but
before<00:01:56.219> then<00:01:56.430> we've<00:01:56.880> got<00:01:57.060> a<00:01:57.090> warm<00:01:57.420> up<00:01:57.540> and<00:01:57.780> then

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
before then we've got a warm up and then

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.929 
before then we've got a warm up and then
we're<00:01:58.350> cooling<00:01:58.590> down<00:01:58.890> take<00:01:59.310> a<00:01:59.340> look<00:01:59.640> at<00:01:59.759> this

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
we're cooling down take a look at this

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.719 
we're cooling down take a look at this
gorgeous<00:02:00.450> they're<00:02:01.350> making<00:02:01.530> snow<00:02:02.040> off<00:02:02.340> at<00:02:02.490> Blue

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
gorgeous they're making snow off at Blue

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.560 
gorgeous they're making snow off at Blue
Ridge<00:02:03.799> so<00:02:04.799> we<00:02:04.979> we<00:02:05.219> did<00:02:05.399> get<00:02:05.520> some<00:02:05.579> natural<00:02:06.060> snow

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
Ridge so we we did get some natural snow

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:07.730 
Ridge so we we did get some natural snow
now<00:02:06.840> we're<00:02:07.020> looking<00:02:07.170> at<00:02:07.350> a<00:02:07.409> little<00:02:07.560> bit<00:02:07.649> of

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
now we're looking at a little bit of

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.919 
now we're looking at a little bit of
man-made<00:02:08.099> snow<00:02:08.340> to<00:02:08.489> really<00:02:09.090> help<00:02:09.300> kick<00:02:09.690> up<00:02:09.810> the

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
man-made snow to really help kick up the

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.930 
man-made snow to really help kick up the
season<00:02:10.410> in<00:02:10.770> a<00:02:10.890> few<00:02:11.099> weeks<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.520> probably<00:02:11.819> a<00:02:11.849> lot

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
season in a few weeks the probably a lot

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.210 
season in a few weeks the probably a lot
of<00:02:12.030> people<00:02:12.270> heading<00:02:12.510> up

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
of people heading up

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.890 
of people heading up
to<00:02:13.340> the<00:02:13.430> mountains<00:02:13.820> there<00:02:14.090> so<00:02:14.360> we<00:02:14.540> did<00:02:14.720> get<00:02:14.840> a

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
to the mountains there so we did get a

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.470 
to the mountains there so we did get a
point<00:02:15.110> in<00:02:15.440> time<00:02:15.620> to<00:02:15.890> all<00:02:16.040> this<00:02:16.190> snow<00:02:16.670> and<00:02:17.000> we

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
point in time to all this snow and we

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.100 
point in time to all this snow and we
got<00:02:17.600> holidays<00:02:18.050> exactly<00:02:19.600> so<00:02:20.600> even<00:02:20.870> if<00:02:20.990> we

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
got holidays exactly so even if we

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:22.660 
got holidays exactly so even if we
didn't<00:02:21.350> produce<00:02:21.500> any<00:02:21.650> snow<00:02:21.980> on<00:02:22.130> her<00:02:22.220> own<00:02:22.370> well

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
didn't produce any snow on her own well

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.310 
didn't produce any snow on her own well
there<00:02:22.970> we<00:02:23.060> go<00:02:23.090> man<00:02:23.420> made<00:02:23.630> snow<00:02:23.810> up<00:02:24.020> there<00:02:24.050> but

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320 
there we go man made snow up there but

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.930 
there we go man made snow up there but
we<00:02:24.410> actually<00:02:24.860> saw<00:02:25.040> about<00:02:25.190> three<00:02:25.430> to<00:02:25.790> five

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
we actually saw about three to five

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.790 
we actually saw about three to five
inches<00:02:26.210> of<00:02:26.450> snow<00:02:26.660> and<00:02:26.900> some<00:02:27.230> of<00:02:27.320> our<00:02:27.470> higher

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
inches of snow and some of our higher

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.560 
inches of snow and some of our higher
elevations<00:02:28.490> in<00:02:28.580> the<00:02:28.700> mountains<00:02:29.090> with<00:02:29.420> this

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 
elevations in the mountains with this

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:31.390 
elevations in the mountains with this
last<00:02:29.810> storm<00:02:30.200> system<00:02:30.590> there's<00:02:30.980> actually

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
last storm system there's actually

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.650 
last storm system there's actually
another<00:02:31.550> one<00:02:31.790> coming<00:02:32.120> in<00:02:32.210> so<00:02:32.330> we'll<00:02:32.420> tell<00:02:32.630> you

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
another one coming in so we'll tell you

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.180 
another one coming in so we'll tell you
exactly<00:02:33.020> when<00:02:33.230> coming<00:02:33.560> up<00:02:33.680> in<00:02:33.770> just<00:02:33.890> a<00:02:34.040> minute

exactly when coming up in just a minute

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:35.980 
exactly when coming up in just a minute
want<00:02:34.670> to<00:02:34.730> focus<00:02:34.880> on<00:02:35.120> temperatures<00:02:35.630> for<00:02:35.930> a

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:35.990 
want to focus on temperatures for a

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:37.090 
want to focus on temperatures for a
moment<00:02:36.140> with<00:02:36.380> you<00:02:36.470> you'll<00:02:36.680> see<00:02:36.860> temperatures

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
moment with you you'll see temperatures

earlier<00:02:37.550> today<00:02:37.760> well<00:02:38.270> 64<00:02:38.870> degrees<00:02:39.020> only<00:02:39.440> was

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
earlier today well 64 degrees only was

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.250 
earlier today well 64 degrees only was
the<00:02:39.650> high<00:02:39.800> in<00:02:39.950> downtown<00:02:40.340> average<00:02:40.910> is<00:02:41.090> 75<00:02:41.900> so<00:02:42.170> we

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
the high in downtown average is 75 so we

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.780 
the high in downtown average is 75 so we
were<00:02:42.350> well<00:02:42.560> below<00:02:42.740> average<00:02:42.920> and<00:02:43.490> we're

were well below average and we're

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.280 
were well below average and we're
starting<00:02:43.910> to<00:02:44.150> inch<00:02:44.300> closer<00:02:44.540> to<00:02:44.750> average<00:02:44.870> as<00:02:45.170> we
