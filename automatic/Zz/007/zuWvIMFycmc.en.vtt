00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
I've really enjoyed training there but

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.340 
I've really enjoyed training there but
the<00:01:25.590> roads<00:01:25.830> really<00:01:26.160> are<00:01:26.400> quite<00:01:27.350> quite

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
the roads really are quite quite

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.760 
the roads really are quite quite
treacherous<00:01:28.650> in<00:01:29.160> terms<00:01:29.520> of<00:01:29.790> road<00:01:30.570> cycling<00:01:31.110> so

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
treacherous in terms of road cycling so

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.490 
treacherous in terms of road cycling so
any<00:01:32.220> any<00:01:32.520> cycling<00:01:33.030> I<00:01:33.090> do<00:01:33.150> do<00:01:33.420> in<00:01:33.540> Kenya<00:01:33.930> is<00:01:34.140> is

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
any any cycling I do do in Kenya is is

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.050 
any any cycling I do do in Kenya is is
it's<00:01:35.100> all<00:01:35.280> off-road<00:01:35.790> on<00:01:36.570> on<00:01:36.780> mountain<00:01:37.200> bikes

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
it's all off-road on on mountain bikes

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.810 
it's all off-road on on mountain bikes
but<00:01:39.060> it<00:01:39.210> obviously<00:01:39.570> gave<00:01:39.840> you<00:01:39.990> a<00:01:40.020> kind<00:01:40.320> of

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
but it obviously gave you a kind of

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.430 
but it obviously gave you a kind of
muscular<00:01:41.820> structure<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.600> as<00:01:42.840> I<00:01:42.960> say<00:01:43.200> those

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:43.440 
muscular structure and as I say those

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.990 
muscular structure and as I say those
lungs<00:01:44.780> but<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:45.960> sad<00:01:46.530> thing<00:01:46.560> surely<00:01:47.370> is<00:01:47.700> that

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
lungs but the sad thing surely is that

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.400 
lungs but the sad thing surely is that
you<00:01:48.810> caused<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:50.190> first<00:01:50.510> African<00:01:51.510> person<00:01:51.930> from

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:52.410 
you caused the first African person from

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:54.770 
you caused the first African person from
Africa<00:01:52.950> ever<00:01:53.580> to<00:01:53.790> win<00:01:53.970> this<00:01:54.180> I<00:01:54.420> know<00:01:54.480> you're<00:01:54.750> a

Brit but you're you will grew up there
in<00:01:56.880> Kenya<00:01:57.470> and<00:01:58.470> the<00:01:58.620> likelihood<00:01:59.040> of<00:01:59.190> any

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
in Kenya and the likelihood of any

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.940 
in Kenya and the likelihood of any
African<00:02:00.360> team<00:02:00.570> managing<00:02:01.080> to<00:02:01.260> compete<00:02:01.650> in<00:02:01.830> this

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
African team managing to compete in this

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.840 
African team managing to compete in this
race<00:02:02.040> it's<00:02:02.640> a<00:02:02.760> rich<00:02:02.940> man's<00:02:03.180> sport

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
race it's a rich man's sport

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.139 
race it's a rich man's sport
definitely<00:02:05.850> definitely<00:02:06.120> I<00:02:06.360> mean<00:02:06.570> it's<00:02:06.810> it's

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
definitely definitely I mean it's it's

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.729 
definitely definitely I mean it's it's
there's<00:02:09.149> there's<00:02:09.479> a<00:02:09.569> reason<00:02:09.780> why<00:02:10.140> that<00:02:10.409> there

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
there's there's a reason why that there

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.870 
there's there's a reason why that there
are<00:02:10.799> more<00:02:11.009> marathon<00:02:11.700> runners<00:02:11.999> in

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
in Kenya in Africa and then there are

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.370 
in Kenya in Africa and then there are
cyclists<00:02:16.410> and<00:02:18.090> 100%<00:02:19.090> cycling<00:02:19.870> is<00:02:19.990> a<00:02:20.020> sport

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
cyclists and 100% cycling is a sport

cyclists and 100% cycling is a sport
that<00:02:20.470> it<00:02:21.220> really<00:02:21.610> has<00:02:21.760> evolved<00:02:22.330> so<00:02:22.570> far<00:02:22.870> in

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
that it really has evolved so far in

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.280 
that it really has evolved so far in
terms<00:02:23.410> of<00:02:23.680> equipment<00:02:24.280> in<00:02:24.850> terms<00:02:24.910> of<00:02:25.480> the

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
whole element of it so it really is a

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.850

are more and more Africans making that

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.410 
are more and more Africans making that
making<00:02:44.110> that<00:02:44.260> that<00:02:44.650> that<00:02:45.340> leap<00:02:45.640> to<00:02:45.940> get<00:02:46.090> over

rise

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
rise

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.980
