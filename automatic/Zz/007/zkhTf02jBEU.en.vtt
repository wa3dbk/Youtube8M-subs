that<00:01:51.509> in<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.810> comments<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:52.670> I'll<00:01:53.670> think

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
that in the comments and I'll think

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.100 
that in the comments and I'll think
about<00:01:53.939> doing<00:01:54.210> that<00:01:54.390> for<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.570> alternative

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
about doing that for the alternative

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.910 
about doing that for the alternative
channel<00:01:55.409> it<00:01:56.369> just<00:01:56.579> takes<00:01:56.759> a<00:01:56.880> lot<00:01:57.090> of<00:01:57.119> I<00:01:57.920> guess

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
channel it just takes a lot of I guess

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.170 
channel it just takes a lot of I guess
time<00:01:59.219> to<00:01:59.399> edit<00:01:59.520> a<00:01:59.759> video<00:01:59.880> like<00:02:00.119> that

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180
