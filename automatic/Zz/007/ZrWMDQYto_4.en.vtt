 brush but a sponge look at the kits 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.629
 the same with the brush 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.850
 highlight the upper part of the 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.210
 lips at the bottom of the bra 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:10.260

 this pencil by paola p this is me 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.430
 been honored which is the number 5 that 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.780
 as for me for the color 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.090
 of my lips is absolutely 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.280
 perfect between the car is slightly hard 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.470
 I didn't understand at first if I did 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.720
 like I am then I have to tell you the fact 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.880
 that it is hard allows the pencil to stand 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.439
 stopping is not moving does not move for 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.090
 works sometimes I do all the 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.420
 lips only with pencil a file of 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:45.090
 perfect cocoa butter the idea of ​​only 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.710
 the central part again the part 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.880
 upper middle lower part of 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.920
 lips and fill the corners slightly 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:55.380
 up to here everything is clear 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.259
 in the benefit kit there is a smudge but me 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.299
 I believe it is not necessary as far as 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:03.509
 as for me the last step 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:05.700
 burrocacao this one of eos I use a little 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.600
 of cocoa butter for this is the result 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.690
 the final 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.430
 the lips are super natural I can 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.000
 say the fact of putting a 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.950
 lip balm allows 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.320
 they are actually actually materially 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.120
 hydrate for hours it doesn't take anything a 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.580
 retouch meeting that I have these 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:25.030
 produced in my clutch and goes smooth 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.720
 like the oil even during the 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.850
 day 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.160
 that's why I tell you, I don't take with you 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.990
 the small brush or a small brush taken from 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.030
 another Russian a hundred years ago and use 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:36.580
 that is the sponge type brush 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:39.070
 bow down that perfect one 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.500
 today it needs big hexagons 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:43.420
 tools to do it is very natural and 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.430
 very cool now that we're in 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.989
 spring as a director begins to do 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.200
 video out on the terrace 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:52.420

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.370
