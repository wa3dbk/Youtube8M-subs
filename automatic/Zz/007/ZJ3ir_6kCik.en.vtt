slider so pretty cool right I mean this
is<00:00:29.539> something<00:00:30.539> really<00:00:30.900> simple<00:00:31.769> a<00:00:32.189> simple<00:00:32.730> idea

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
is something really simple a simple idea

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.479 
is something really simple a simple idea
that<00:00:33.239> should<00:00:33.390> have<00:00:33.540> been<00:00:33.980> innovated<00:00:34.980> a<00:00:35.100> long

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
that should have been innovated a long

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.389 
that should have been innovated a long
time<00:00:35.790> ago<00:00:36.059> but<00:00:36.480> it's<00:00:36.719> finally<00:00:36.989> here<00:00:37.440> and<00:00:37.620> we're

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
time ago but it's finally here and we're

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.170 
time ago but it's finally here and we're
gonna<00:00:38.520> try<00:00:38.790> it<00:00:38.850> out<00:00:40.460> so<00:00:41.460> let's<00:00:41.760> open<00:00:41.940> this

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
gonna try it out so let's open this

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:52.220 
gonna try it out so let's open this
right<00:00:42.360> away<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:42.750> try<00:00:43.020> it<00:00:43.079> out

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.450 

that's<00:00:52.830> the<00:00:53.990> pendrive<00:00:54.990> just<00:00:55.560> a<00:00:55.740> quick<00:00:56.070> look<00:00:56.280> at

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
that's the pendrive just a quick look at

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.580 
that's the pendrive just a quick look at
it<00:00:56.610> it's<00:00:56.760> a<00:00:56.850> USB<00:00:57.240> 3<00:00:57.480> pendrive<00:00:57.870> with<00:00:58.050> fast<00:00:58.320> data

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
it it's a USB 3 pendrive with fast data

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.100 
it it's a USB 3 pendrive with fast data
rates<00:00:58.920> so<00:00:59.820> it's<00:01:00.150> currently<00:01:00.540> in<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.690> USB<00:01:00.900> OTG

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.110 
rates so it's currently in the USB OTG

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.369 
rates so it's currently in the USB OTG
mode<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:01.800> we<00:01:02.280> can<00:01:02.400> connect<00:01:02.700> this<00:01:02.880> to<00:01:03.540> any<00:01:03.930> USB

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.760 
mode and we can connect this to any USB
OTG<00:01:04.589> capable<00:01:05.250> device<00:01:05.570> and<00:01:06.570> if<00:01:07.020> we<00:01:07.290> slide<00:01:07.590> it

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
OTG capable device and if we slide it

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.130 
OTG capable device and if we slide it
this<00:01:07.950> way<00:01:08.190> it's<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.150> pen<00:01:09.330> drive<00:01:09.420> so<00:01:10.020> you<00:01:10.050> can

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
this way it's a pen drive so you can

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.810 
this way it's a pen drive so you can
connect<00:01:10.500> it<00:01:10.620> to<00:01:10.740> a<00:01:10.770> PC<00:01:11.010> and<00:01:11.400> transfer<00:01:11.790> files

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
connect it to a PC and transfer files

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.700 
connect it to a PC and transfer files
onto<00:01:12.390> it<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:12.750> you<00:01:12.900> can<00:01:13.020> notice<00:01:13.440> the<00:01:13.560> blue

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
onto it and you can notice the blue

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.010 
onto it and you can notice the blue
color<00:01:13.950> here<00:01:14.190> which<00:01:14.340> denotes<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.420> USB<00:01:15.780> 3

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
color here which denotes the USB 3

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.880 
color here which denotes the USB 3
speeds<00:01:16.490> so<00:01:17.490> let's<00:01:17.850> go<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.780> USB<00:01:19.229> OTG<00:01:19.410> mode

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
speeds so let's go to the USB OTG mode

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.070 
speeds so let's go to the USB OTG mode
so<00:01:20.100> this<00:01:20.280> is<00:01:20.400> in<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.790> OTG<00:01:21.150> mode<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:21.570> I'm<00:01:21.870> going

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
so this is in the OTG mode and I'm going

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.200 
so this is in the OTG mode and I'm going
to<00:01:22.110> connect<00:01:22.380> it<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.160> galaxy<00:01:23.670> note<00:01:23.820> 3<00:01:23.850> which

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
to connect it to the galaxy note 3 which

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.820 
to connect it to the galaxy note 3 which
has<00:01:24.360> USB<00:01:24.690> 3<00:01:24.990> support<00:01:26.390> and<00:01:27.390> USB<00:01:28.110> OTG<00:01:28.200> support<00:01:28.470> of

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:28.830 
has USB 3 support and USB OTG support of

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:30.859 
has USB 3 support and USB OTG support of
course<00:01:29.070> so<00:01:29.460> this<00:01:29.640> is<00:01:29.759> a<00:01:29.820> normal<00:01:29.940> microUSB<00:01:30.690> and

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
course so this is a normal microUSB and

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.730 
course so this is a normal microUSB and
it<00:01:30.990> will<00:01:31.380> not<00:01:31.619> possibly<00:01:32.040> transfer<00:01:32.610> in<00:01:33.380> USB<00:01:34.380> 3

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
it will not possibly transfer in USB 3

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.180 
it will not possibly transfer in USB 3
speeds<00:01:35.100> so<00:01:35.910> let's<00:01:36.240> connect<00:01:37.050> this<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:37.619> see

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190 
speeds so let's connect this and see

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.370 
speeds so let's connect this and see
what<00:01:38.520> it<00:01:39.150> shows<00:01:39.479> up<00:01:39.660> like<00:01:39.750> in<00:01:40.050> the<00:01:40.170> file

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
what it shows up like in the file

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.230 
what it shows up like in the file
manager

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.890 

so<00:01:46.240> it<00:01:46.990> says<00:01:47.250> USB<00:01:48.250> mass-storage<00:01:48.939> connected

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:49.900 
so it says USB mass-storage connected

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:59.179 
so it says USB mass-storage connected
and<00:01:50.619> you<00:01:51.549> can<00:01:51.729> notice

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.770 

and<00:01:59.759> you<00:02:00.479> can<00:02:00.630> notice<00:02:01.369> in<00:02:02.369> all<00:02:02.729> that<00:02:03.420> there<00:02:03.689> is

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
and you can notice in all that there is

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.050 
and you can notice in all that there is
a<00:02:03.810> USB<00:02:04.289> Drive<00:02:04.530> a<00:02:04.740> with<00:02:05.729> just<00:02:05.819> nothing

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
a USB Drive a with just nothing

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.479 
a USB Drive a with just nothing
currently<00:02:06.569> of<00:02:06.990> course<00:02:07.289> so<00:02:07.859> let's<00:02:08.190> move

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
currently of course so let's move

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:15.280 
currently of course so let's move
something<00:02:08.849> from<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.690> phone<00:02:11.480> like<00:02:12.480> a<00:02:13.459> picture

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
something from the phone like a picture

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.400 
something from the phone like a picture
so<00:02:16.290> this<00:02:16.470> is<00:02:16.650> a<00:02:16.680> picture<00:02:17.010> I<00:02:17.190> recently<00:02:17.610> took<00:02:18.410> so

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
so this is a picture I recently took so

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.670 
so this is a picture I recently took so
let's<00:02:19.860> copy<00:02:20.519> this

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.830 

copy<00:02:25.549> to<00:02:26.450> USB<00:02:26.930> Drive<00:02:27.409> a<00:02:27.620> and<00:02:27.950> paste<00:02:28.280> here<00:02:28.840> so

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
copy to USB Drive a and paste here so

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.089 
copy to USB Drive a and paste here so
that<00:02:30.110> item<00:02:30.560> has<00:02:30.890> showed<00:02:31.220> up<00:02:31.400> in<00:02:31.640> USB<00:02:32.239> Drive<00:02:32.510> a

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:33.099 
that item has showed up in USB Drive a

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:36.820 
that item has showed up in USB Drive a
in<00:02:34.099> the<00:02:34.280> root<00:02:34.459> folder<00:02:34.870> so<00:02:35.870> I'm<00:02:36.230> still<00:02:36.530> having

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
in the root folder so I'm still having

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.300 
in the root folder so I'm still having
the<00:02:37.340> USB<00:02:38.090> Drive<00:02:38.390> connected<00:02:38.870> here<00:02:39.290> so<00:02:40.010> I'll

the USB Drive connected here so I'll

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.380 
the USB Drive connected here so I'll
just<00:02:40.790> remove<00:02:41.690> it<00:02:41.870> or<00:02:42.110> maybe<00:02:42.769> we<00:02:43.069> can<00:02:43.390> safely

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
just remove it or maybe we can safely

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:50.030 
just remove it or maybe we can safely
remove<00:02:44.629> it<00:02:44.900> perhaps<00:02:47.079> there<00:02:48.079> is<00:02:48.170> any

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
remove it perhaps there is any

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.759 
remove it perhaps there is any
but<00:02:50.670> there<00:02:51.030> seems<00:02:51.150> to<00:02:51.480> be<00:02:51.689> no<00:02:51.810> option<00:02:52.200> so<00:02:52.379> let's

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
but there seems to be no option so let's

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:57.320 
but there seems to be no option so let's
just<00:02:53.159> remove<00:02:53.549> it

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.700 

so<00:02:57.990> now<00:02:58.490> you<00:02:59.490> can<00:02:59.670> see<00:02:59.880> that<00:03:00.240> there's<00:03:01.140> no<00:03:01.320> USB

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:01.710 
so now you can see that there's no USB

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:05.000 
so now you can see that there's no USB
drive<00:03:01.920> here<00:03:02.220> so<00:03:02.250> yes<00:03:02.930> that's<00:03:03.930> the<00:03:04.500> prodigy

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
drive here so yes that's the prodigy

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.620 
drive here so yes that's the prodigy
functionality<00:03:05.730> of<00:03:06.000> the<00:03:06.150> pendrive

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
functionality of the pendrive

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.020 
functionality of the pendrive
server<00:03:07.530> but<00:03:07.710> in<00:03:07.830> pendrive<00:03:08.280> as<00:03:08.670> you<00:03:08.790> can<00:03:08.910> see

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
server but in pendrive as you can see

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.650 
server but in pendrive as you can see
from<00:03:09.180> here

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
from here

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.490 
from here
so<00:03:10.050> let's<00:03:10.410> now<00:03:10.620> connect<00:03:11.010> it<00:03:11.160> to<00:03:11.370> a<00:03:11.400> PC<00:03:11.820> and<00:03:12.500> see

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
so let's now connect it to a PC and see

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.430 
so let's now connect it to a PC and see
if<00:03:14.040> we<00:03:14.640> can<00:03:14.790> see<00:03:14.940> the<00:03:15.060> files<00:03:15.270> there<00:03:15.540> so<00:03:16.110> this<00:03:16.290> is

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
if we can see the files there so this is

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.160 
if we can see the files there so this is
a<00:03:16.470> really<00:03:17.160> neat<00:03:17.340> solution<00:03:17.580> if<00:03:18.090> you<00:03:18.570> don't<00:03:18.810> want

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
a really neat solution if you don't want

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:26.620 
a really neat solution if you don't want
to<00:03:19.880> actually<00:03:20.880> use<00:03:21.120> a<00:03:21.720> cable<00:03:22.410> or<00:03:22.890> a<00:03:23.700> USB<00:03:24.060> OTG<00:03:24.360> USB

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
to actually use a cable or a USB OTG USB

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.630 
to actually use a cable or a USB OTG USB
OTG<00:03:27.630> cable<00:03:28.020> perhaps<00:03:28.530> that's<00:03:29.070> the<00:03:29.310> only<00:03:29.490> thing

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
OTG cable perhaps that's the only thing

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.520 
OTG cable perhaps that's the only thing
that'll<00:03:30.060> you<00:03:30.270> will<00:03:30.480> need<00:03:30.630> so<00:03:30.930> let's<00:03:31.110> connect

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
that'll you will need so let's connect

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.490 
that'll you will need so let's connect
it<00:03:31.710> to<00:03:31.950> the<00:03:32.070> surface<00:03:32.580> and<00:03:33.210> you<00:03:33.420> can<00:03:33.840> see<00:03:33.990> from

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
it to the surface and you can see from

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.840 
it to the surface and you can see from
here<00:03:34.830> that<00:03:35.130> the<00:03:36.000> image<00:03:36.210> has<00:03:36.690> showed<00:03:37.140> up<00:03:37.290> here

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:37.850 
here that the image has showed up here

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:42.590 
here that the image has showed up here
so<00:03:38.850> that's<00:03:39.000> the<00:03:39.270> image<00:03:39.450> I<00:03:39.600> copied<00:03:40.050> and<00:03:40.910> and<00:03:41.910> it

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
so that's the image I copied and and it

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.510 
so that's the image I copied and and it
shows<00:03:42.840> up<00:03:43.020> here<00:03:43.050> on<00:03:43.320> the<00:03:43.410> pendrive<00:03:43.710> so<00:03:43.980> pretty

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:44.520 
shows up here on the pendrive so pretty

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.870 
shows up here on the pendrive so pretty
neat<00:03:44.760> stuff<00:03:44.970> we<00:03:45.900> really<00:03:46.230> like<00:03:46.560> that<00:03:47.130> somebody

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
neat stuff we really like that somebody

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.230 
neat stuff we really like that somebody
has<00:03:48.120> thought<00:03:48.480> of<00:03:48.720> this<00:03:49.700> kind<00:03:50.700> of<00:03:50.790> unique

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:51.240 
has thought of this kind of unique

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:55.040 
has thought of this kind of unique
pendrive<00:03:51.750> with<00:03:52.680> dual<00:03:53.430> features<00:03:53.820> but<00:03:54.390> we<00:03:54.780> wish

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050 
pendrive with dual features but we wish

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:58.730 
pendrive with dual features but we wish
if<00:03:55.830> there<00:03:56.310> was<00:03:56.430> an<00:03:56.580> option<00:03:57.230> to<00:03:58.230> actually

00:03:58.730 --> 00:03:58.740 
if there was an option to actually

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:02.390 
if there was an option to actually
connect<00:03:59.130> and<00:03:59.400> or<00:04:00.330> probably<00:04:00.950> extend<00:04:01.950> this<00:04:02.130> as<00:04:02.340> a

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
connect and or probably extend this as a

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.150 
connect and or probably extend this as a
cable<00:04:02.730> then<00:04:03.570> it<00:04:03.840> would<00:04:04.020> be<00:04:04.170> really<00:04:04.440> nice

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
cable then it would be really nice

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.900 
cable then it would be really nice
like<00:04:05.840> for<00:04:06.840> example<00:04:06.870> extend<00:04:07.830> the<00:04:07.950> USB<00:04:08.400> as<00:04:08.670> well

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
like for example extend the USB as well

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.710 
like for example extend the USB as well
as<00:04:09.030> the<00:04:09.180> OTG<00:04:09.780> and<00:04:10.590> use<00:04:11.220> it<00:04:11.400> also<00:04:11.670> as<00:04:11.880> a<00:04:12.090> USB<00:04:12.630> OTG

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
as the OTG and use it also as a USB OTG

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.870 
as the OTG and use it also as a USB OTG
cable<00:04:13.170> that<00:04:13.500> would<00:04:13.739> be<00:04:13.890> really<00:04:14.280> nice<00:04:14.489> if

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
cable that would be really nice if

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.780 
cable that would be really nice if
somebody<00:04:15.360> does<00:04:15.690> that<00:04:16.040> so<00:04:17.040> yeah<00:04:17.250> that's<00:04:17.520> the

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:17.790 
somebody does that so yeah that's the

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.080 
somebody does that so yeah that's the
USB<00:04:18.209> OTG<00:04:18.390> pendrive<00:04:19.080> really<00:04:19.830> nice<00:04:20.040> we<00:04:20.820> pick
