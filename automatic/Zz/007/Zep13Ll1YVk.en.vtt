00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
adding this this game is a real example

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.460 
adding this this game is a real example
of<00:03:53.250> how<00:03:53.400> the<00:03:53.459> team<00:03:53.940> has<00:03:54.120> to<00:03:54.269> play<00:03:54.299> and<00:03:54.720> the<00:03:55.230> team

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
of how the team has to play and the team

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.520 
of how the team has to play and the team
win<00:03:55.680> the<00:03:55.829> game<00:03:56.010> and<00:03:56.360> she<00:03:57.360> voted<00:03:57.630> the<00:03:57.959> momentum

win the game and she voted the momentum

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.530 
win the game and she voted the momentum
change<00:03:58.860> what<00:03:59.190> you<00:03:59.370> got<00:03:59.519> to<00:03:59.670> 90<00:04:00.030> minutes<00:04:00.209> and

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
change what you got to 90 minutes and

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.150 
change what you got to 90 minutes and
you<00:04:00.630> knew<00:04:00.810> you<00:04:00.959> had<00:04:00.989> better<00:04:01.290> way<00:04:01.500> go

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160 
you knew you had better way go

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.730 
you knew you had better way go
obviously<00:04:04.090> it's<00:04:04.300> a<00:04:04.480> it's<00:04:05.020> a<00:04:05.110> nice<00:04:05.230> advantage

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:05.740 
obviously it's a it's a nice advantage

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:06.929 
obviously it's a it's a nice advantage
for<00:04:05.920> the

00:04:06.929 --> 00:04:06.939 
for the

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:10.149 
for the
equally<00:04:07.939> but<00:04:08.209> now<00:04:08.390> we<00:04:08.450> could<00:04:08.829> win<00:04:09.829> some<00:04:10.040> more

00:04:10.149 --> 00:04:10.159 
equally but now we could win some more

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:11.920 
equally but now we could win some more
time<00:04:10.370> play<00:04:10.730> a<00:04:10.760> little<00:04:11.060> more<00:04:11.359> possession

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
time play a little more possession

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:13.360 
time play a little more possession
because<00:04:12.049> we<00:04:12.349> didn't<00:04:12.560> have<00:04:12.590> to<00:04:12.799> find<00:04:13.040> that<00:04:13.189> goal

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
because we didn't have to find that goal

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.420 
because we didn't have to find that goal
and<00:04:13.519> if<00:04:13.670> you<00:04:13.760> score<00:04:13.969> that<00:04:14.120> quick<00:04:14.359> in<00:04:14.480> the<00:04:15.430> first

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
and if you score that quick in the first

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.210 
and if you score that quick in the first
half<00:04:16.609> of<00:04:16.639> the<00:04:16.759> extra<00:04:16.970> time<00:04:17.180> is<00:04:17.389> easier<00:04:17.570> to

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 
half of the extra time is easier to

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.110 
half of the extra time is easier to
after<00:04:19.220> to<00:04:19.340> manage<00:04:19.579> the<00:04:19.669> game<00:04:19.820> and<00:04:20.030> I<00:04:20.060> think

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
after to manage the game and I think

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.610 
after to manage the game and I think
we'll<00:04:20.449> fight<00:04:20.690> well<00:04:20.900> because<00:04:21.199> after<00:04:21.350> they

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
we'll fight well because after they

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.290 
we'll fight well because after they
didn't<00:04:21.829> had<00:04:21.949> a<00:04:21.979> really<00:04:22.400> big<00:04:22.759> opportunity<00:04:22.880> I

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
didn't had a really big opportunity I

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.719 
didn't had a really big opportunity I
