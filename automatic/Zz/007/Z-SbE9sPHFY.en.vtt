00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
switched over units pretty much we

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.070 
switched over units pretty much we
decided<00:00:19.619> on<00:00:19.710> going<00:00:19.740> uh<00:00:20.220> speedling<00:00:21.150> and<00:00:21.449> marine

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
decided on going uh speedling and marine

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.519 
decided on going uh speedling and marine
rush<00:00:22.350> pretty<00:00:22.859> much<00:00:24.109> it's<00:00:25.109> pretty<00:00:25.320> solid

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
rush pretty much it's pretty solid

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.220 
rush pretty much it's pretty solid
against<00:00:25.890> zerg<00:00:26.130> and<00:00:26.460> as<00:00:27.420> long<00:00:27.630> as<00:00:27.840> you<00:00:27.990> keep<00:00:28.170> the

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
against zerg and as long as you keep the

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.900 
against zerg and as long as you keep the
marine<00:00:28.619> safe<00:00:29.810> you'll<00:00:30.810> get<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.050> advantage<00:00:31.910> so

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
marine safe you'll get the advantage so

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.049 
marine safe you'll get the advantage so
here<00:00:33.690> you<00:00:33.899> see<00:00:33.930> I'm<00:00:34.200> going<00:00:34.500> for<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:35.059> spawning

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
here you see I'm going for the spawning

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.170 
here you see I'm going for the spawning
pool<00:00:36.300> extractor<00:00:38.420> the<00:00:39.420> toss<00:00:39.870> is<00:00:40.350> going

pool extractor the toss is going

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.310 
pool extractor the toss is going
subjects<00:00:42.180> core<00:00:42.540> so<00:00:42.719> he's<00:00:42.840> probably<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.170> come

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
subjects core so he's probably to come

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.000 
subjects core so he's probably to come
out<00:00:43.440> stalkers<00:00:44.040> there<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.840> zerg<00:00:45.840> as<00:00:46.230> well<00:00:46.710> is

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
out stalkers there and zerg as well is

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.040 
out stalkers there and zerg as well is
going<00:00:47.399> probably<00:00:47.730> definitely<00:00:48.450> going

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
going probably definitely going

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.209 
going probably definitely going
speedlings<00:00:49.890> right<00:00:50.100> here<00:00:50.399> and<00:00:51.620> my<00:00:52.620> partner<00:00:53.010> has

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
speedlings right here and my partner has

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.229 
speedlings right here and my partner has
a<00:00:53.360> bear<00:00:54.360> of<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.570> tech<00:00:54.750> lab<00:00:54.930> going<00:00:55.170> down<00:00:55.440> with

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 
a bear of the tech lab going down with

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:59.270 
a bear of the tech lab going down with
two<00:00:57.239> barracks<00:00:57.510> building<00:00:58.020> a<00:00:58.199> little<00:00:58.710> late<00:00:58.859> but

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
two barracks building a little late but

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.939 
two barracks building a little late but
uh<00:00:59.340> I<00:01:00.289> guess<00:01:01.289> uh<00:01:01.320> better<00:01:02.129> late<00:01:02.280> than<00:01:02.399> never<00:01:02.460> so

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:03.949 
uh I guess uh better late than never so

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:08.899 
uh I guess uh better late than never so
here<00:01:04.949> we<00:01:05.100> see<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.970> attack<00:01:06.780> ooh<00:01:07.729> that<00:01:08.729> looked

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
here we see the attack ooh that looked

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.630 
here we see the attack ooh that looked
like<00:01:08.939> it<00:01:09.030> was<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.299> move<00:01:09.510> not<00:01:09.840> in<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.049> tack<00:01:10.320> mood

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
like it was a move not in the tack mood

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.740 
like it was a move not in the tack mood
he<00:01:11.640> uses<00:01:12.060> some<00:01:12.299> servings<00:01:12.930> from<00:01:13.110> that

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
he uses some servings from that

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.190 
he uses some servings from that
regrouping<00:01:17.150> as<00:01:18.150> you<00:01:18.330> can<00:01:18.450> see<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.960> Marines

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
regrouping as you can see the Marines

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.690 
regrouping as you can see the Marines
are<00:01:19.350> behind<00:01:19.740> deserve<00:01:20.189> wings<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:22.430> the<00:01:23.430> melee

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
are behind deserve wings and the melee

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.350 
are behind deserve wings and the melee
can't<00:01:24.630> do<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:24.780> thing<00:01:24.869> about<00:01:25.140> it

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:36.980 

and<00:01:28.360> here<00:01:28.780> they<00:01:28.990> just<00:01:29.020> lose<00:01:29.980> their<00:01:30.520> attack

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.370 

and<00:01:37.610> the<00:01:38.610> worst<00:01:38.850> time<00:01:39.119> for<00:01:39.229> putting<00:01:40.229> down<00:01:40.350> a

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
and the worst time for putting down a

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.469 
and the worst time for putting down a
second<00:01:40.649> base<00:01:40.829> would<00:01:41.130> probably<00:01:41.759> be<00:01:42.119> right

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
second base would probably be right

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.050 
second base would probably be right
after<00:01:42.630> you<00:01:42.869> lose<00:01:43.079> a<00:01:43.140> rush<00:01:43.439> but<00:01:44.430> this<00:01:44.640> guy<00:01:44.820> did

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
after you lose a rush but this guy did

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.510 
after you lose a rush but this guy did
it<00:01:45.180> so<00:01:45.860> here<00:01:46.860> we<00:01:46.890> got<00:01:47.130> I<00:01:47.340> have<00:01:47.610> speedlings<00:01:48.149> now

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
it so here we got I have speedlings now

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:59.300 
it so here we got I have speedlings now
I'm<00:01:50.520> just<00:01:50.820> uh<00:01:51.470> following<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.560> Marines

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.320 

coming<00:02:00.310> to<00:02:00.400> the<00:02:00.430> base<00:02:00.640> waiting<00:02:01.060> for<00:02:01.270> the

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
coming to the base waiting for the

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.580 
coming to the base waiting for the
Marines<00:02:01.600> pretty<00:02:02.080> slow

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.940 

no<00:02:05.549> board<00:02:05.909> goes<00:02:06.090> down<00:02:06.679> you<00:02:07.679> see<00:02:07.799> they're

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
no board goes down you see they're

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.160 
no board goes down you see they're
trying<00:02:08.129> to<00:02:08.160> go<00:02:08.250> for<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.399> Marines<00:02:08.670> but<00:02:09.330> fail

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
trying to go for the Marines but fail

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.820 
trying to go for the Marines but fail
and<00:02:11.840> as<00:02:12.840> you<00:02:12.959> go<00:02:13.080> into<00:02:13.200> the<00:02:13.319> base<00:02:13.470> you'll<00:02:13.800> see

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
and as you go into the base you'll see

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.140 
and as you go into the base you'll see
mountains<00:02:16.830> service<00:02:17.220> or<00:02:17.400> a<00:02:17.430> ballot<00:02:17.790> evenly

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
mountains service or a ballot evenly

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:24.500 
mountains service or a ballot evenly
matched<00:02:18.360> but<00:02:18.810> those<00:02:18.959> greens<00:02:19.349> really<00:02:20.069> help<00:02:20.280> out

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.920 

and<00:02:24.810> the<00:02:25.290> Queen<00:02:25.500> goes<00:02:25.650> down<00:02:25.890> as<00:02:26.129> well<00:02:26.750> at<00:02:27.750> this

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
and the Queen goes down as well at this

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.780 
and the Queen goes down as well at this
point<00:02:28.170> as<00:02:28.439> long<00:02:28.650> as<00:02:28.799> those<00:02:28.920> Marines<00:02:29.310> stay<00:02:29.519> safe
