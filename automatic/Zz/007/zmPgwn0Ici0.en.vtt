00:00:00.789 --> 00:00:02.270
 how long my eyes 

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:05.200
 the routes choose general alternating 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.200
 with a topic 

00:00:12.439 --> 00:00:14.609
 I have the time when you first get in there 

00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:17.609
 the second race at Altenheim 30 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.159
 and the more food because it will eventually work 

00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:27.159
 Bachmann somewhat uneasy on Ammann 

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:35.370
 then come back to the sea 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.770
 Disputes Opera 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.770
 Nice 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.770
 who problems 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.060
 black children return the captain meters almost verdens 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.550
 and he can still choose now 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.040
 which car you want the ambitious 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.370
 Cynic or take 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.880
 Landscheidt Weather at 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.150
 the divorce was warm and you're right Schlamp lying 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.250
 Elitz carriage together 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.250
 very soft tires 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.550
 many women 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.090
 I do not know exactly what is but you can sometimes put a gate 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.440
 memory the most beautiful form 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.690
 hot water 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.650
 Take ContiTech bread 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.650
 thanks to youth a select 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.850
 Â«I have different but not titled track then succeed sometimes myself 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.860
 right down to the rhythm 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.610
 and 83 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.760
 The scope, while not really big, had three routes 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.090
 but 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:54.190
 this 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.840
 Bucher Mai makes sure that you can still train harder 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.140
 at the evening of the 3 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.880
 so hold differently 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.620
 the national games 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.620
 in more detail to game 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:17.119
 they shared 

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:19.589
 settle down a bit 

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:22.589
 the more economical cars 

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:25.859
 and then comes the good phase too 

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:29.269
 and Federer not applied 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:32.269
 because the cars are driving 

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:36.339
 but if we hopefully did that, she won% won 

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:41.359
 Valverde cars departure other cars 2000 

00:02:47.149 --> 00:02:50.149
 Zumthor and Weichen 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:52.879
 the profit something 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:55.339
 a lot of bizarre 

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:57.229
 only because he is on the 

00:02:57.229 --> 00:03:00.229
 and later again 

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:04.909
 Resulting in getting a fighter 

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:07.909
 no matter explain 

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:22.979
 but if the doubt how fits out there 

00:03:26.429 --> 00:03:29.429
 and 66 

00:03:34.429 --> 00:03:37.719
 to replay feature learns something cooking 

00:03:37.719 --> 00:03:40.119
 there you can also different 

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:41.779
 Bliesener camera angle 

00:03:41.779 --> 00:03:44.689
 but those are a technology standard camera looked at and 

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:46.939
 one of the farther away from the car 

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:50.389
 So not really interesting no one likes the scene 

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:51.879
 he is a member 

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:54.879
 so that's something recently 

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:03.589
 Computer science to drive and how do you actually nothing wrong 

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:04.519
 do 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:08.519
 This was already part of the version after that, of course 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:09.649
 the German 

00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:13.349
 they include the free version of the road are clearly preferable 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:16.219
 put into operation because of the better technology 

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:17.969
 UW in all three versions 

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:19.539
 there is the game more open 

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:21.129
 to buy these euros 

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:22.370
 it's worth it 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.830
 It does not matter if you are racing game test drive it is always great that 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.520
 Heiner and good and also 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.520
 RM multiplayer mode is fully developed 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:34.499
 and so I say goodbye 

00:04:34.499 --> 00:04:37.599
 really completely turned off 

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:41.020
 So you see again that's true if you wanted to hide 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.999
 or not he tries to do my best 

00:04:42.999 --> 00:04:46.400
 make this presence pilot to it 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:47.680
 Percent one has again
