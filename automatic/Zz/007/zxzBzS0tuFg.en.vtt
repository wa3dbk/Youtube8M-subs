00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
and i put a fresh one morning you could

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.360 
and i put a fresh one morning you could
just<00:03:18.409> tell<00:03:18.680> the<00:03:18.830> difference<00:03:19.250> of<00:03:19.310> the

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
just tell the difference of the

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.330 
just tell the difference of the
curliness<00:03:19.970> it<00:03:20.720> just<00:03:21.049> drops<00:03:21.410> down<00:03:21.709> and<00:03:22.069> to<00:03:22.190> this

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
curliness it just drops down and to this

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.550 
curliness it just drops down and to this
way<00:03:22.640> but<00:03:23.180> it<00:03:23.269> just<00:03:23.420> looked<00:03:23.660> like<00:03:23.720> this<00:03:23.989> manic

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
way but it just looked like this manic

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.000 
way but it just looked like this manic
wave<00:03:24.799> and<00:03:25.370> I<00:03:26.060> just<00:03:26.360> really<00:03:26.720> didn't<00:03:27.379> enjoy<00:03:27.530> it

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
wave and I just really didn't enjoy it

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.270 
wave and I just really didn't enjoy it
and<00:03:28.450> I<00:03:29.450> really<00:03:30.260> thought<00:03:30.440> this<00:03:30.590> won't<00:03:30.950> work<00:03:31.099> out

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
and I really thought this won't work out

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.100 
and I really thought this won't work out
because<00:03:31.489> she<00:03:32.000> is<00:03:32.180> so<00:03:32.360> much<00:03:32.540> shorter<00:03:32.930> and

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
because she is so much shorter and

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:39.930 
because she is so much shorter and
lightweight<00:03:33.709> then<00:03:34.400> Ruth<00:03:35.299> or<00:03:35.690> rush<00:03:36.910> but

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940
