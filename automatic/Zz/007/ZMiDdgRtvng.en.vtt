00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:14.900
 cost increases 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.920
 hello and welcome to the chain 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.890
 youtube from the website is from 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:30.720
 the year points like today I you 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:33.850
 this pink cycle at fred neil 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.379
 number 11 so that's blue is 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.860
 so for the white according to walter white's 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:40.660
 foot home comfortable chanel 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.699
 I make you a little motor cases that 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.699
 for a long time I did not make you 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:49.620
 so here I'm going to use the y 179 not 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:49.620
 so that's how it looks 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:56.050
 as usual in the world is 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:59.579
 always the hard film on the top 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.579
 there is only that left 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:13.360
 so here we take it off so we go 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.360
 put his little dots 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:25.720
 then I have a little flower that I m 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.070
 on this angle 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.990
 ok more 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:02:03.520
 of course you care about your nail polish 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:05.470
 really really super dry so like 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:09.090
 these are big big reasons 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:12.940
 be careful that they do not fly 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.440
 a puck so then for the coupons 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.920
 the banks I put on the varnish 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:22.980
 white ie the weight and white 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.980
 and I'm going to put them across for that 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:33.180
 I set before I go to cost 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.180
 first look what I need 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:42.840
 as length is not bad so I 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.840
 put in the other lake 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:49.510
 I will do the same with the chick I 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:03:00.100
 go on the edge of the nail cut is 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:03:03.640
 rather broad who one is second in 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:10.590
 the water i will get back my first and 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:14.340
 so here it is the first band 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.340
 take care of a second sell 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.769
 that's it's done 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:49.610
 so that's done then we go 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:51.200
 absorb the rest of your afterwards for 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:53.600
 the water shifts you do not leave you 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:57.440
 let you leave what's left a 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:04:01.100
 monopoly to overtake you do not bother 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:04.790
 to cut anything and so there I 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:06.320
 so go there to finalize my decor I 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.570
 I'll always use my page in 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:15.680
 before to finally paste I 'm going to put 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:18.010
 two small dots of glue for 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.010
 codemasters 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.320
 and so I took a white and humble 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:31.160
 as adecco is done on the theme of 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.160
 white and blue 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:51.750
 so here's the stage these are small 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:51.750
 really great metal costs flat 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:56.830
 and here it is super practical actually 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:59.940
 is super pretty his features but you have to 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.940
 his matisse is metallic what 

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:21.159
 so I'll wait until it dries 

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:29.899
 so it must be dry on 

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:33.939
 take his top coat and we'll have a 

00:05:29.899 --> 00:05:36.979
 layer of top coat over all that 

00:05:33.939 --> 00:05:38.419
 so where it overflows too and there on 

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:42.080
 the nail should not hesitate too had said 

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:46.879
 to pau from everywhere because that's where 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:49.479
 it will be removed what we put already there 

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:49.479
 its good 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:04.319
 so we just have to remove more 

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:04.319
 are removing what's pliers 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:22.729
 I think it's going to be good here too 

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:22.729
 it does not stay 

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:41.140
 So that's it's done and that's it 

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:43.940
 for this decoration y 179 

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:46.730
 it also exists in pink if you want 

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:51.250
 to make life exist 179 

00:06:46.730 --> 00:07:02.150
 this one his 279 to and so in the end 

00:06:51.250 --> 00:07:04.490
 discover super nice here is the 

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:07.370
 the blue was the 6 4 at home 

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:09.620
 sentence did not have 11 enjoy because 

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:10.850
 it's always the same concern an elf or 

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:13.520
 and fresnel we will have to stop 

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:16.690
 to import them from Korea simply 

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:18.710
 because of problems at the level of 

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:20.930
 deregulation europe european 

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:22.570
 which are relatively strict for 

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:25.940
 very small companies like us 

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:29.900
 so these are small stearns that have 

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:31.460
 been used for this douala and then and 

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:34.850
 then for the blond according to gwenan white 

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:37.150
 from china glaze and then mama like jean 

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:42.620
 sailor so that you want some
