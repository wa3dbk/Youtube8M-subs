00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:07.160
 hello everyone if you often flow 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:13.250
 axle seals 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:16.080
 or gland gear rear axle 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:18.660
 half-line bearings are you okay you 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.310
 change no hint there for 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.460
 failure bearing is not a whole 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.840
 broken and gland anyway through time 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.340
 starts to trickle 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:35.730
 snotty first thing do not forget 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:40.640
 I remind you to check the breather this here 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.640
 such a bag top fungus 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:47.370
 which has a function ie performs 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:52.680
 valve function which resets 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:54.780
 pressure we have when driving in crankcase 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:01:00.059
 rear axle rear axle 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:02.969
 pressure is created which 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.850
 nowhere to go if this one is clogged 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.220
 breather 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:11.909
 so this pressure is looking for weak 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:15.180
 parts and this we have is something of 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:18.900
 three oil seals mostly oil seals 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:23.759
 semiaxes 1 or right left begin 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.619
 graft so here it is a fungus here 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:29.070
 see even 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:36.210
 he performed this function here everything is in our 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:39.329
 oily pores ie pressure 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:42.360
 he is the pressure that is dumped from here 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:48.000
 here are oil pairs and invested in our 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:51.270
 all this here in the mud in general will give a function 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.720
 he did you but he didn't 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:58.710
 gets out scrolls in place and 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:03.700
 that's why I didn't soar my brain 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:09.489
 went bought a new 12 hryvnia he builds 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:14.170
 and this look at his example how he 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:16.230
 arranged take them to its top 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.230
 part 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:24.360
 removed that usually here is such a fitting 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.930
 through 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.930
 he connects to the atmosphere carter 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:40.220
 rear axle gearbox 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:42.739
 and here is such a rubber 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:48.830
 spring gasket 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:53.780
 which prevents getting into the crankcase 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:56.069
 here it is he is there spring 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.620
 prevents dust from entering the crankcase 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:02.519
 mud water and everything else 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:06.200
 but with pressure which is there 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:09.840
 created it is triggered compressed and 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:13.200
 pressure comes out steam and oil and that 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:17.459
 there may still be why do not forget 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:20.879
 this business is often hammered 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:23.819
 it is possible to remove this fungus like this 

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:26.190
 already showed the top to clear all 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:29.549
 This is the case who gets out better 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:35.720
 unscrew the purge and collect such here 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:38.959
 way into place just puts on 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.959
 need to get 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:48.269
 That's all the breather in our work consists 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:50.879
 was becoming our new breather want 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:55.260
 remind that the same breather is installed 

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:58.140
 on the gearbox on the gearbox so not 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:00.599
 forget to follow him too if you 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:05.099
 often the box gland flows 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:05.700
 then understand the reason may be a clogged 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:08.340
 breather 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:10.670
 For today, all up to the next video for everyone 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.670
 good luck
