00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:08.899
 it was hands 

00:00:08.899 --> 00:00:10.729
 a girl 

00:00:10.729 --> 00:00:13.049
 and she doesn't have it 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.160
 her father was an arnout fisherman and, moreover, able to sing in a house 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:22.210
 not far from it 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:24.810
 emperor's residence 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.830
 He ignored about a very large leave 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.359
 the president loved beautiful things 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:32.650
 like that parquet 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:34.730
 that's a worry 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.530
 the emperor's palace 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.600
 a piece of the Eredivisie 8 shines 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.070
 everywhere you looked 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.970
 spark on a large mt hofstede 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:51.210
 The Germanman collected porcelain jewelry paintings, beautiful clothes too much to put on 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.550
 to name 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.310
 yasuhito endo of beautiful things 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:58.830
 van der Geest and the debts of the fishes that her father 4 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:00.670
 of the sun 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.430
 the night in the sea was submerged in the starry sky from her bed 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.670
 could see 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.670
 of the singing of the nightingale 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.870
 the backyard of yasmine no that of the emperor 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.820
 right on the border 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.760
 fashion a nightingale 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.160
 spoke in a blue 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.600
 anyway every night 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.080
 that can cheat to send from work 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.220
 with the tones of his improper traffic jams minister 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.770
 there were more people who heard the nightingale sing 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.550
 and he told it further 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.170
 so the singing of the nightingale target audience throughout the country 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.540
 from far and wide every night more and more visitors for the nightingale 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.280
 one day it gets during the visit 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.440
 from ps to sex 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.310
 a cousin from a distant land 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.730
 proud to lead and palace teacher 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:02.600
 I don't think you are the silver candlesticks 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.950
 have you seen this is it from a delicate side 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.730
 art her ex nodded polite learning to belong to you all 

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:13.639
 but I don't see the best thing from a critical view here 

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:16.699
 the stallion bred 

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:18.909
 pop music 

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:20.269
 it's a beautiful one 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:24.329
 who publishes concerts every night in Pinckaers answers 

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:28.369
 of course the emperor does not have that 

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:31.319
 Brandy laughed at resources out there 2 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:32.919
