00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:02.349 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:03.989 

look<00:03:02.590> at<00:03:02.680> all<00:03:02.799> this<00:03:02.950> structure<00:03:03.549> that's<00:03:03.700> now<00:03:03.849> on

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:03.999 
look at all this structure that's now on

00:03:03.999 --> 00:03:05.789 
look at all this structure that's now on
the<00:03:04.030> ground<00:03:04.329> behind<00:03:04.510> me<00:03:04.870> and<00:03:05.260> it's<00:03:05.469> all<00:03:05.620> done

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:05.799 
the ground behind me and it's all done

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:07.500 
the ground behind me and it's all done
safely<00:03:06.310> so<00:03:06.519> now<00:03:06.639> we<00:03:06.700> can<00:03:06.939> come<00:03:07.030> in<00:03:07.180> with<00:03:07.239> big

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
safely so now we can come in with big

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.289 
safely so now we can come in with big
pieces<00:03:07.689> of<00:03:07.900> equipment<00:03:08.049> you<00:03:08.709> know<00:03:09.370> size<00:03:09.939> reduce

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:10.299 
pieces of equipment you know size reduce

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:12.780 
pieces of equipment you know size reduce
it<00:03:10.540> load<00:03:11.019> it<00:03:11.049> up<00:03:11.379> and<00:03:11.620> we<00:03:12.340> didn't<00:03:12.489> have<00:03:12.549> to<00:03:12.670> put

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
it load it up and we didn't have to put

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:20.520 
it load it up and we didn't have to put
people<00:03:13.120> in<00:03:13.209> harm's<00:03:13.329> way

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530
