discussion<00:00:18.810> on<00:00:19.289> fungi<00:00:19.680> let<00:00:20.189> us<00:00:20.310> quickly<00:00:20.550> look

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
discussion on fungi let us quickly look

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.880 
discussion on fungi let us quickly look
at<00:00:21.060> some<00:00:21.330> of<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.630> very<00:00:21.840> important<00:00:22.529> for<00:00:22.710> guide

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
at some of the very important for guide

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.040 
at some of the very important for guide
however<00:00:23.820> i've<00:00:24.060> discussed<00:00:24.480> all<00:00:24.720> different

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
however i've discussed all different

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.019 
however i've discussed all different
types<00:00:25.289> but<00:00:25.500> now<00:00:25.890> we<00:00:25.949> will<00:00:26.250> talk<00:00:26.430> about<00:00:26.580> few

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
types but now we will talk about few

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.150 
types but now we will talk about few
examples<00:00:27.630> of<00:00:27.750> Ally<00:00:28.080> which<00:00:28.289> are<00:00:28.470> very<00:00:28.680> commonly

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
examples of Ally which are very commonly

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.339 
examples of Ally which are very commonly
seen<00:00:29.279> by<00:00:29.730> all<00:00:29.910> of<00:00:30.119> us<00:00:30.240> so<00:00:30.900> let<00:00:31.050> us<00:00:31.080> talk<00:00:31.289> about

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
seen by all of us so let us talk about

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.500 
seen by all of us so let us talk about
some<00:00:31.830> common<00:00:32.040> forget<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.969> first<00:00:33.270> would<00:00:33.480> be

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
some common forget the first would be

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.000 
some common forget the first would be
east<00:00:35.210> east<00:00:36.210> is<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.719> only<00:00:36.960> unicellular<00:00:37.770> fungi

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
east east is the only unicellular fungi

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.310 
east east is the only unicellular fungi
other<00:00:38.640> than<00:00:38.850> that<00:00:39.030> all<00:00:39.300> other<00:00:39.660> fungi<00:00:40.110> are

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
other than that all other fungi are

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.380 
other than that all other fungi are
multicellular<00:00:40.770> so<00:00:41.340> that<00:00:41.489> is<00:00:41.610> one<00:00:41.790> interesting

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
multicellular so that is one interesting

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.150 
multicellular so that is one interesting
or<00:00:42.710> important<00:00:43.710> thing<00:00:43.920> about<00:00:44.160> East<00:00:46.160> however

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
or important thing about East however

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.209 
or important thing about East however
some<00:00:47.520> of<00:00:47.700> them<00:00:48.030> might<00:00:48.629> turn<00:00:49.110> multicellular<00:00:50.039> by

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
some of them might turn multicellular by

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.150 
some of them might turn multicellular by
formation<00:00:50.670> of<00:00:50.969> -<00:00:51.420> that<00:00:51.600> means<00:00:51.809> after<00:00:51.989> dig<00:00:52.890> all

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
formation of - that means after dig all

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.490 
formation of - that means after dig all
of<00:00:53.370> them<00:00:53.550> will<00:00:53.699> grow<00:00:53.910> as<00:00:54.059> -<00:00:54.300> so<00:00:55.020> now<00:00:55.110> when<00:00:55.350> they

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
of them will grow as - so now when they

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.680 
of them will grow as - so now when they
-<00:00:55.739> becomes<00:00:56.250> branched<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:56.879> filamentous<00:00:57.300> maybe

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
- becomes branched and filamentous maybe

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.650 
- becomes branched and filamentous maybe
they<00:00:57.870> will<00:00:57.930> group<00:00:58.199> together<00:00:58.379> to<00:00:58.829> form

00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.660 
they will group together to form

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.380 
they will group together to form
multicellular<00:01:01.309> they<00:01:02.309> do<00:01:02.370> not<00:01:02.670> need<00:01:02.969> sunlight

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
multicellular they do not need sunlight

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.920 
multicellular they do not need sunlight
for<00:01:04.019> growth<00:01:04.320> so<00:01:04.739> that<00:01:04.769> is<00:01:05.040> why<00:01:05.220> they<00:01:05.790> prefer<00:01:06.390> to

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
for growth so that is why they prefer to

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.960 
for growth so that is why they prefer to
grow<00:01:07.350> in<00:01:07.680> dark<00:01:08.400> places<00:01:10.310> organic<00:01:11.310> compounds

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
grow in dark places organic compounds

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.719 
grow in dark places organic compounds
are<00:01:12.090> utilized<00:01:12.810> for<00:01:13.290> energy<00:01:13.920> so<00:01:14.280> they<00:01:14.430> do<00:01:14.490> not

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
are utilized for energy so they do not

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.300 
are utilized for energy so they do not
need<00:01:14.970> sunlight<00:01:15.330> so<00:01:16.080> what<00:01:16.409> they<00:01:16.590> so<00:01:16.950> how<00:01:17.100> will

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
need sunlight so what they so how will

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.310 
need sunlight so what they so how will
they<00:01:17.400> get<00:01:17.549> energy<00:01:18.000> they<00:01:18.060> can<00:01:18.240> utilize<00:01:18.479> the

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
they get energy they can utilize the

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.880 
they get energy they can utilize the
organic<00:01:19.850> compounds<00:01:20.850> as<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.030> source<00:01:21.360> of<00:01:21.509> energy

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
organic compounds as a source of energy

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.590 
organic compounds as a source of energy
some<00:01:22.890> of<00:01:23.070> their<00:01:23.220> important<00:01:23.729> application<00:01:24.420> is

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
some of their important application is

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.210 
some of their important application is
they<00:01:24.780> are<00:01:24.900> used<00:01:25.170> in<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.500> preparation<00:01:25.799> of

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
they are used in the preparation of

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.120 
they are used in the preparation of
bread<00:01:26.580> beer<00:01:27.330> wine<00:01:28.049> these<00:01:28.500> are<00:01:28.680> some<00:01:28.860> of<00:01:29.009> the

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
bread beer wine these are some of the

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.789 
bread beer wine these are some of the
very<00:01:29.310> important<00:01:29.790> applications<00:01:29.970> of<00:01:30.810> East<00:01:31.229> that

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
very important applications of East that

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.010 
very important applications of East that
is<00:01:31.979> why<00:01:32.130> East<00:01:32.400> is<00:01:32.729> a<00:01:32.759> very<00:01:33.090> important<00:01:33.840> and

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
is why East is a very important and

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:40.010 
is why East is a very important and
learn<00:01:34.770> of<00:01:35.270> significance<00:01:36.890> it<00:01:37.970> is<00:01:38.970> found<00:01:39.540> almost

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
learn of significance it is found almost

portion<00:02:20.249> you<00:02:21.060> actually<00:02:21.480> have<00:02:21.659> these<00:02:21.900> ksk<00:02:22.620> like

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:22.859 
portion you actually have these ksk like

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:25.039 
portion you actually have these ksk like
structure<00:02:23.310> which<00:02:23.519> will<00:02:23.730> form<00:02:24.209> the<00:02:24.299> recipient

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:25.049 
structure which will form the recipient

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:26.660 
structure which will form the recipient
and<00:02:25.230> of<00:02:25.349> the<00:02:25.469> BC<00:02:25.769> diem<00:02:25.980> you<00:02:26.129> will<00:02:26.249> actually

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
and of the BC diem you will actually

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.309 
and of the BC diem you will actually
have<00:02:26.849> them<00:02:27.709> pose<00:02:28.709> and<00:02:29.540> the<00:02:30.540> third<00:02:30.840> one<00:02:31.109> would

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
have them pose and the third one would

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:34.339 
have them pose and the third one would
be<00:02:31.379> moulds<00:02:32.040> if<00:02:33.000> you<00:02:33.389> remember<00:02:33.810> while<00:02:34.079> I<00:02:34.200> was

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
be moulds if you remember while I was

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:36.050 
be moulds if you remember while I was
talking<00:02:34.680> about<00:02:34.769> Protista<00:02:35.459> I<00:02:35.489> told<00:02:35.760> you<00:02:35.909> that

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
talking about Protista I told you that

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.059 
talking about Protista I told you that
slime<00:02:36.359> molds<00:02:36.959> even<00:02:37.500> though<00:02:37.590> the<00:02:37.709> name<00:02:37.859> is

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
slime molds even though the name is

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:39.920 
slime molds even though the name is
worlds<00:02:38.549> but<00:02:38.700> they<00:02:38.849> are<00:02:39.000> not<00:02:39.180> and<00:02:39.419> then<00:02:39.569> fungi

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
worlds but they are not and then fungi

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:40.909 
worlds but they are not and then fungi
they<00:02:40.079> are<00:02:40.169> under<00:02:40.349> protest

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:40.919 
they are under protest

00:02:40.919 --> 00:02:42.709 
they are under protest
so<00:02:41.430> the<00:02:41.549> molds<00:02:41.969> are<00:02:42.060> actually<00:02:42.480> a<00:02:42.510> net

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:42.719 
so the molds are actually a net

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:44.659 
so the molds are actually a net
frontline<00:02:43.349> and<00:02:43.590> this<00:02:43.799> is<00:02:43.950> how<00:02:44.099> they<00:02:44.340> look<00:02:44.459> like

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:44.669 
frontline and this is how they look like

00:02:44.669 --> 00:02:46.849 
frontline and this is how they look like
so<00:02:45.180> when<00:02:45.269> I<00:02:45.299> talk<00:02:45.569> about<00:02:45.750> words<00:02:46.200> they<00:02:46.829> are

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:46.859 
so when I talk about words they are

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:49.300 
so when I talk about words they are
multicellular<00:02:47.280> they<00:02:47.849> grow<00:02:48.090> in<00:02:48.269> the<00:02:48.389> form<00:02:48.689> of

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
multicellular they grow in the form of

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.580 
multicellular they grow in the form of
interconnected<00:02:50.310> hyphy<00:02:51.079> several<00:02:52.079> drugs<00:02:52.379> are

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
interconnected hyphy several drugs are

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.949 
interconnected hyphy several drugs are
obtained<00:02:53.010> from<00:02:53.280> molds<00:02:53.819> one<00:02:54.480> of<00:02:54.629> the<00:02:54.719> best

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
obtained from molds one of the best

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.399 
obtained from molds one of the best
example<00:02:55.530> of<00:02:55.620> moles<00:02:55.889> would<00:02:56.189> be<00:02:56.430> penicillin<00:02:57.409> so

00:02:58.399 --> 00:02:58.409 
example of moles would be penicillin so

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:00.439 
example of moles would be penicillin so
the<00:02:58.560> antibiotic<00:02:59.129> penicillin<00:02:59.280> is<00:03:00.030> obtained

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:00.449 
the antibiotic penicillin is obtained

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:03.199 
the antibiotic penicillin is obtained
from<00:03:00.689> a<00:03:00.959> mold<00:03:01.500> right<00:03:02.219> so<00:03:02.730> these<00:03:02.909> were<00:03:03.180> some

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
from a mold right so these were some

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.439 
from a mold right so these were some
very<00:03:03.629> important<00:03:04.290> fungi<00:03:04.980> now<00:03:05.819> let<00:03:06.030> us<00:03:06.060> look<00:03:06.299> at

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:06.449 
very important fungi now let us look at

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:08.990 
very important fungi now let us look at
the<00:03:06.599> overall<00:03:06.989> importance<00:03:07.650> of<00:03:07.829> fungi<00:03:08.159> it<00:03:08.639> helps

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
the overall importance of fungi it helps

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.849 
the overall importance of fungi it helps
in<00:03:09.120> decomposition<00:03:09.900> of<00:03:09.959> organic<00:03:10.109> wastes

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:10.859 
in decomposition of organic wastes

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:12.949 
in decomposition of organic wastes
because<00:03:10.980> they<00:03:11.340> primarily<00:03:11.879> act<00:03:12.449> as<00:03:12.719> the

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
because they primarily act as the

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.379 
because they primarily act as the
composer<00:03:13.379> so<00:03:13.739> fungi<00:03:14.370> and<00:03:14.549> bacteria<00:03:14.609> they<00:03:15.239> go

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:15.389 
composer so fungi and bacteria they go

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:19.509 
composer so fungi and bacteria they go
hand-in-hand<00:03:15.840> in<00:03:16.370> cleaning<00:03:17.370> our<00:03:17.519> atmosphere

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 
hand-in-hand in cleaning our atmosphere

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:23.270 
hand-in-hand in cleaning our atmosphere
