00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:16.970
 good today I bring you a new trick this 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:19.430
 is the second that I upload to youtube so 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:22.279
 I hope you like it discovered it there and 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:25.340
 well let's go there we need the server 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:28.280
 have the james op plugin 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:31.010
 and we need two trunks an anvil the 

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:32.300
 posters and two diamonds and have something of 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.200
 experience and I have a lot does not 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:38.780
 missing so much 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:42.039
 we put both the two trunks 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.039
 in the middle 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:48.550
 let's go to the anvil 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:52.600
 we put a diamond and we change the 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:55.350
 name I'm going to change what they put a 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.350
 lowercase and you're done 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.500
 and there it is 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.410
 now we put a diamond on each side 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:11.850
 this is to show you that it works 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:11.850
 we take a poster 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.750
 we put the 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:30.750
 We put the poster to sell and we put 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:33.380
 a symbolic amount of a dollar 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.380
 so 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.080
 and here same 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.130
 symbolic amount of a pain and 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.820
 there is 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.200
 good now to check that it works 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.200
 I connect with another pc worth 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:06.860
 well once here I entered as I stumbled 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.990
 Well, we can see that I can buy 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:12.140
 we started with this 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:15.940
 with one he tried to buy two and I no longer 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:18.120
 leaves well then we try with the other 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.440
 buy one 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.510
 I bought 2 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.020
 and I can buy all you want 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.020
 as you can see 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:31.900
 well I go back with the other pg 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.100
 good back here we will see we will 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.930
 check the trunks 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.880
 here we can see that the diamond 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.260
 get 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.250
 however here 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.670
 there is no diamond 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:47.970
 this you can do with 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:50.220
 I think with almost all the items 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:53.270
 and only you need apart from all 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.270
 things have two accounts 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.410
 good 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.450
 up to here all I hope that I have 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.450
 liked
