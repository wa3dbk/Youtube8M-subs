to be upgraded and serviced by you

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.359 
to be upgraded and serviced by you
should<00:01:21.030> you<00:01:21.210> so<00:01:21.450> choose<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:22.619> retina<00:01:22.979> macbook

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
should you so choose the retina macbook

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.420 
should you so choose the retina macbook
pro<00:01:23.580> isn't<00:01:24.150> how<00:01:24.780> so<00:01:25.080> let's<00:01:25.830> start<00:01:26.130> with<00:01:26.310> the

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
pro isn't how so let's start with the

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.340 
pro isn't how so let's start with the
battery<00:01:26.729> instead<00:01:27.479> of<00:01:27.630> being<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:27.990> single

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350

battery instead of being a single
removable<00:01:29.100> unit<00:01:29.460> each<00:01:30.000> cell<00:01:30.600> is<00:01:30.869> glued<00:01:31.380> to<00:01:31.409> the

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.740 
removable unit each cell is glued to the
machines<00:01:32.009> case<00:01:32.310> this<00:01:33.060> makes<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.450> battery

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
machines case this makes the battery

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.510 
machines case this makes the battery
nearly<00:01:34.049> impossible<00:01:34.500> to<00:01:34.979> remove<00:01:35.220> without

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
nearly impossible to remove without

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.910 
nearly impossible to remove without
damaging<00:01:35.670> it<00:01:36.299> or<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:37.049> components<00:01:37.560> underneath

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
damaging it or the components underneath

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.370 
damaging it or the components underneath
it<00:01:38.610> also<00:01:38.820> means<00:01:39.180> you<00:01:39.509> can't<00:01:39.900> get<00:01:40.170> to<00:01:40.290> the

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
it also means you can't get to the

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.069 
it also means you can't get to the
components<00:01:40.829> under<00:01:40.979> it<00:01:41.189> like<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.790> trackpad

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:42.079 
components under it like the trackpad

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:44.179 
components under it like the trackpad
the<00:01:43.079> situation<00:01:43.619> doesn't<00:01:43.799> really<00:01:44.009> get<00:01:44.130> any

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
the situation doesn't really get any

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:44.749 
the situation doesn't really get any
better

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
better

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.850 
better
when<00:01:45.149> we<00:01:45.270> look<00:01:45.420> at<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.659> motherboard<00:01:46.229> there's

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
when we look at the motherboard there's

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.310 
when we look at the motherboard there's
a<00:01:46.979> proprietary<00:01:47.729> solid-state<00:01:48.450> drive<00:01:48.750> which

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
a proprietary solid-state drive which

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.960 
a proprietary solid-state drive which
means<00:01:49.530> you<00:01:49.680> won't<00:01:49.950> be<00:01:50.189> able<00:01:50.280> to<00:01:50.430> swap<00:01:50.700> it<00:01:50.850> out

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
means you won't be able to swap it out

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.539 
means you won't be able to swap it out
for<00:01:51.030> a<00:01:51.329> larger<00:01:51.750> third-party<00:01:52.530> one<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:53.340> RAM

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
for a larger third-party one and the RAM

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.399 
for a larger third-party one and the RAM
is<00:01:53.820> soldered<00:01:54.299> to<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.450> motherboard<00:01:54.540> so<00:01:55.320> you

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
is soldered to the motherboard so you

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.800 
is soldered to the motherboard so you
won't<00:01:55.590> be<00:01:55.680> upgrading<00:01:56.100> that<00:01:56.280> either<00:01:56.579> and<00:01:57.000> if

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
won't be upgrading that either and if

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.830 
won't be upgrading that either and if
all<00:01:58.079> this<00:01:58.380> wasn't<00:01:58.829> enough<00:01:59.390> Apple<00:02:00.390> also

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
all this wasn't enough Apple also

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.990 
all this wasn't enough Apple also
dropped<00:02:01.110> two<00:02:01.409> features<00:02:01.920> that<00:02:02.460> set<00:02:02.820> the

dropped two features that set the

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.749 
dropped two features that set the
