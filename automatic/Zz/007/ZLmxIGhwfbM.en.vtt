00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:36.200 
stories issue more attention to that and
the<00:05:33.390> Sunstrider<00:05:33.990> Thunderer<00:05:34.740> is<00:05:35.040> then<00:05:35.580> so<00:05:36.120> you

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.210 
the Sunstrider Thunderer is then so you

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.240 
the Sunstrider Thunderer is then so you
can<00:05:36.360> use<00:05:36.510> his<00:05:36.630> ability<00:05:37.050> but<00:05:37.410> one<00:05:38.040> ability

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:38.250 
can use his ability but one ability

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:40.730 
can use his ability but one ability
would<00:05:38.700> be<00:05:38.910> enough<00:05:39.210> to<00:05:39.510> do<00:05:39.630> it<00:05:39.780> now<00:05:40.350> there's<00:05:40.560> no

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 
would be enough to do it now there's no

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.160 
would be enough to do it now there's no
motor<00:05:41.040> to<00:05:41.250> power<00:05:41.430> and<00:05:42.210> he<00:05:42.660> should<00:05:42.840> provide

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:43.170 
motor to power and he should provide

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:45.320 
motor to power and he should provide
with<00:05:43.440> the<00:05:43.470> scavenger<00:05:44.040> to<00:05:44.250> sender<00:05:44.550> so<00:05:44.820> he<00:05:44.970> will

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:45.330 
with the scavenger to sender so he will

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.510 
with the scavenger to sender so he will
be<00:05:45.360> too<00:05:45.810> late<00:05:45.840> for<00:05:46.170> killing<00:05:47.130> the<00:05:47.220> more<00:05:47.400> to

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:47.520 
be too late for killing the more to

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.820 
be too late for killing the more to
tower<00:05:47.820> now<00:05:48.390> he's<00:05:48.600> trying<00:05:48.810> to<00:05:49.020> do<00:05:49.140> that<00:05:49.320> but<00:05:49.530> he

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:49.830 
tower now he's trying to do that but he

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:53.210 
tower now he's trying to do that but he
simply<00:05:50.210> erupted<00:05:51.210> and<00:05:51.390> now<00:05:51.930> sundar<00:05:52.500> needs<00:05:53.010> the

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:53.220 
simply erupted and now sundar needs the

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:56.180 
simply erupted and now sundar needs the
more<00:05:53.430> of<00:05:53.580> energy<00:05:54.030> to<00:05:54.360> get<00:05:54.630> to<00:05:55.230> use<00:05:55.890> his<00:05:56.040> special

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:56.190 
more of energy to get to use his special

00:05:56.190 --> 00:06:00.920 
more of energy to get to use his special
ability<00:05:56.370> now<00:05:57.030> he<00:05:57.090> has<00:05:57.420> it<00:05:57.630> and<00:05:57.900> he's<00:05:59.720> yes<00:06:00.720> I

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:00.930 
ability now he has it and he's yes I

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:02.990 
ability now he has it and he's yes I
think<00:06:01.230> he's<00:06:01.320> going<00:06:01.470> to<00:06:01.530> just<00:06:01.770> simply<00:06:02.670> kill

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.000 
think he's going to just simply kill

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.950 
think he's going to just simply kill
that<00:06:03.210> are<00:06:03.540> well<00:06:03.840> and<00:06:05.360> that<00:06:06.360> was<00:06:06.690> a<00:06:06.720> double

grumpy one erupted from each side so one

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:11.630 
grumpy one erupted from each side so one
parallel<00:06:09.960> down<00:06:10.290> again<00:06:10.590> and<00:06:10.620> one<00:06:11.100> main<00:06:11.340> force

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:11.640 
parallel down again and one main force

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:15.080 
parallel down again and one main force
down<00:06:11.880> again<00:06:12.800> yeah<00:06:13.800> y<00:06:14.070> lo<00:06:14.130> peor<00:06:14.430> hands<00:06:14.880> around

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:21.960 
only has around 370 and here we see it

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:24.740 
only has around 370 and here we see it
really<00:06:22.230> pays<00:06:22.560> out<00:06:22.740> into<00:06:23.160> the<00:06:23.250> void<00:06:23.400> power<00:06:23.750> so

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:24.750 
really pays out into the void power so

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:28.820 
really pays out into the void power so
now<00:06:25.020> again<00:06:25.230> another<00:06:26.100> attack<00:06:26.700> he<00:06:27.290> yeah<00:06:28.290> once

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:28.830

now again another attack he yeah once
keeping<00:06:29.190> on<00:06:29.280> the<00:06:29.370> pressure<00:06:29.640> since<00:06:30.030> the<00:06:30.870> long

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:31.050 
keeping on the pressure since the long

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:32.540 
keeping on the pressure since the long
run<00:06:31.260> he<00:06:31.290> has<00:06:31.560> even<00:06:31.860> more<00:06:31.980> of<00:06:32.130> an<00:06:32.220> advantage

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:32.550 
run he has even more of an advantage

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:35.270 
run he has even more of an advantage
especially<00:06:33.090> because<00:06:34.080> of<00:06:34.110> the<00:06:34.470> white<00:06:35.100> energy

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:35.280 
especially because of the white energy

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.940 
especially because of the white energy
that<00:06:35.760> he<00:06:35.910> has<00:06:36.030> more<00:06:36.270> now<00:06:36.900> scavenger<00:06:37.440> again<00:06:37.710> on

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:37.950 
that he has more now scavenger again on

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:39.860

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:42.540 
more the power 10 min would have been

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:44.690 
more the power 10 min would have been
enough<00:06:42.810> but<00:06:43.170> I<00:06:43.200> think<00:06:43.530> yeah<00:06:43.920> scavenger<00:06:44.460> dad

00:07:26.309 --> 00:07:26.319 
enough to kill the power well again so

00:07:26.319 --> 00:07:29.699 
enough to kill the power well again so
yeah<00:07:26.709> it<00:07:27.069> is<00:07:27.939> really<00:07:27.969> really<00:07:28.929> really<00:07:29.289> bad<00:07:29.529> for

00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:29.709 
yeah it is really really really bad for

00:07:29.709 --> 00:07:31.769 
yeah it is really really really bad for
Kafka<00:07:30.219> I<00:07:30.519> think<00:07:31.059> that's<00:07:31.239> why<00:07:31.389> I<00:07:31.419> became<00:07:31.509> the

00:07:31.769 --> 00:07:31.779 
Kafka I think that's why I became the

00:07:31.779 --> 00:07:34.559 
Kafka I think that's why I became the
president<00:07:32.289> role<00:07:32.799> in<00:07:32.979> Romans<00:07:33.399> and<00:07:33.639> yet<00:07:34.389> now
