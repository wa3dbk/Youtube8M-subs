00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
of the most important areas and we're

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.299 
of the most important areas and we're
all<00:00:30.630> talking<00:00:30.900> about<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.230> same<00:00:31.349> positions<00:00:31.980> but

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
all talking about the same positions but

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:33.410 
all talking about the same positions but
what's<00:00:32.489> your<00:00:32.610> take<00:00:32.759> I<00:00:33.000> don't<00:00:33.210> think<00:00:33.329> they're

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
what's your take I don't think they're

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.130 
what's your take I don't think they're
going<00:00:33.510> to<00:00:33.570> be<00:00:33.690> in<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:33.840> market<00:00:33.930> for

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
going to be in the market for

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.910 
going to be in the market for
quarterback<00:00:35.239> but<00:00:36.239> I<00:00:36.510> i<00:00:36.870> would<00:00:37.230> guess<00:00:37.469> it's<00:00:37.739> all

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
quarterback but I i would guess it's all

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.290 
quarterback but I i would guess it's all
the<00:00:38.040> obvious<00:00:38.520> they've<00:00:38.670> got<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:38.969> go<00:00:39.059> get<00:00:39.270> a

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
the obvious they've got to go get a

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.900 
the obvious they've got to go get a
corner<00:00:39.750> they've<00:00:40.050> got<00:00:40.230> to<00:00:40.350> get<00:00:40.469> it<00:00:40.649> safety<00:00:41.190> I

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
corner they've got to get it safety I

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.580 
corner they've got to get it safety I
think<00:00:42.239> a<00:00:42.300> big<00:00:42.510> decision<00:00:42.870> with<00:00:43.170> Brandon

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
think a big decision with Brandon

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.350 
think a big decision with Brandon
Meriweather<00:00:44.010> awaits<00:00:44.399> he<00:00:44.610> becomes<00:00:45.000> a<00:00:45.149> rate

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
Meriweather awaits he becomes a rate

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.660 
Meriweather awaits he becomes a rate
becomes<00:00:45.899> an<00:00:46.110> unrestricted<00:00:46.649> free<00:00:46.800> agent<00:00:47.430> five

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
becomes an unrestricted free agent five

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.819 
becomes an unrestricted free agent five
days<00:00:47.910> after<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.329> Super<00:00:48.629> Bowl<00:00:48.660> I<00:00:49.020> thought<00:00:49.590> he

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
days after the Super Bowl I thought he

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.939 
days after the Super Bowl I thought he
was<00:00:50.039> easily<00:00:50.520> their<00:00:51.510> most<00:00:51.809> talented<00:00:52.469> player<00:00:52.680> in

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
was easily their most talented player in

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.889 
was easily their most talented player in
the<00:00:53.039> secondary<00:00:53.489> if<00:00:53.640> he<00:00:53.699> can<00:00:53.820> stay<00:00:54.059> healthy<00:00:54.090> he

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
the secondary if he can stay healthy he

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.900 
the secondary if he can stay healthy he
learned<00:00:55.170> how<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.379> play<00:00:55.500> with<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.190> without<00:00:56.699> you

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
learned how to play with the without you

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.330 
learned how to play with the without you
know<00:00:57.000> getting<00:00:57.030> penalized<00:00:57.660> every<00:00:58.079> week<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.469> I

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
know getting penalized every week and I

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.860 
know getting penalized every week and I
think<00:00:59.820> they<00:00:59.910> should<00:01:00.090> bring<00:01:00.239> him<00:01:00.480> back<00:01:00.660> but

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
think they should bring him back but

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.569 
think they should bring him back but
they've<00:01:01.020> got<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.289> fill<00:01:01.530> secondary<00:01:02.370> needs

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
they've got to fill secondary needs

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.130 
they've got to fill secondary needs
they've<00:01:02.879> got<00:01:03.059> to<00:01:03.180> get<00:01:03.300> another<00:01:03.510> inside

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
they've got to get another inside

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.429 
they've got to get another inside
linebacker<00:01:04.650> or<00:01:04.979> two<00:01:05.450> potentially<00:01:06.450> you<00:01:07.409> know

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
linebacker or two potentially you know

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:08.960 
linebacker or two potentially you know
you<00:01:07.590> gotta<00:01:07.799> look<00:01:07.860> at<00:01:08.130> D<00:01:08.340> line<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:08.909> you

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
you gotta look at D line and you

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.190 
you gotta look at D line and you
probably<00:01:09.180> need<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.510> look<00:01:09.659> at<00:01:09.750> O<00:01:09.840> line<00:01:10.049> I'd

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
probably need to look at O line I'd

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.750 
probably need to look at O line I'd
still<00:01:10.439> look<00:01:10.590> at<00:01:10.680> wide<00:01:10.830> receiver<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:11.460> I<00:01:11.490> think

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
still look at wide receiver to I think

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.760 
still look at wide receiver to I think
they<00:01:11.850> need<00:01:12.000> another<00:01:12.240> playmaker<00:01:12.770> offensively

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
they need another playmaker offensively

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.820 
they need another playmaker offensively

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
the raiders where he's accumulated most

of<00:02:11.550> his<00:02:11.730> sacks<00:02:12.060> in<00:02:12.420> his<00:02:12.989> career

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
of his sacks in his career

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.950 
of his sacks in his career
I<00:02:13.920> think<00:02:14.220> he's<00:02:14.310> got<00:02:14.460> seven<00:02:14.970> combined<00:02:15.570> sacks

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
I think he's got seven combined sacks

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.570 
I think he's got seven combined sacks
and<00:02:16.200> two<00:02:16.350> career<00:02:16.740> games<00:02:16.770> against<00:02:17.250> the<00:02:17.340> raiders

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
and two career games against the raiders

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.580 
and two career games against the raiders
but<00:02:18.120> then<00:02:18.270> you<00:02:18.360> let<00:02:18.540> you<00:02:18.630> so<00:02:18.840> I<00:02:18.870> personally<00:02:19.320> I

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
don't think he's elite I don't think you

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.960

pretty<00:03:11.790> good<00:03:12.000> player<00:03:12.209> it's<00:03:12.840> not<00:03:12.989> like<00:03:13.170> he's<00:03:13.350> a

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
pretty good player it's not like he's a

stiff out there is a very good outside
linebacker<00:03:15.750> and<00:03:16.200> you<00:03:16.680> have<00:03:16.860> some<00:03:17.070> other

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
linebacker and you have some other

linebacker and you have some other
positions<00:03:17.670> in<00:03:17.790> need<00:03:17.940> on<00:03:18.150> the<00:03:18.269> inside<00:03:18.690> as<00:03:19.019> well

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
positions in need on the inside as well

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.250

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.770 
loves it so I think that's one of the
reasons<00:03:25.200> that<00:03:25.320> they<00:03:25.830> may<00:03:26.190> end<00:03:26.220> up<00:03:26.780> overpaying

play<00:04:38.590> center<00:04:39.039> I<00:04:39.160> think<00:04:39.400> that<00:04:39.430> maybe<00:04:39.699> in<00:04:39.940> a<00:04:40.270> more

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 
play center I think that maybe in a more

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.450 
play center I think that maybe in a more
natural<00:04:41.259> position<00:04:41.740> I'll<00:04:41.860> be<00:04:41.979> interested<00:04:42.220> to

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
natural position I'll be interested to

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.790 
natural position I'll be interested to
see<00:04:42.759> if<00:04:42.970> Gruden<00:04:43.660> and<00:04:43.930> his<00:04:44.110> staff<00:04:44.350> look<00:04:44.680> at

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 
see if Gruden and his staff look at

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.800 
see if Gruden and his staff look at
Liechtenstein<00:04:45.430> as<00:04:45.669> a<00:04:45.699> potential<00:04:46.150> center<00:04:46.660> in

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
Liechtenstein as a potential center in

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:48.600 
Liechtenstein as a potential center in
this<00:04:47.199> league<00:04:47.470> you're<00:04:47.650> right<00:04:47.889> i<00:04:48.130> mean<00:04:48.160> the<00:04:48.400> type

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.610 
this league you're right i mean the type

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.249 
this league you're right i mean the type
of<00:04:48.639> scheme<00:04:49.090> and<00:04:49.360> the<00:04:49.389> type<00:04:49.600> of<00:04:49.630> offensive

00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:50.259 
of scheme and the type of offensive

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:52.230 
of scheme and the type of offensive
lineman<00:04:50.650> they<00:04:51.039> want<00:04:51.370> is<00:04:51.580> still<00:04:51.880> unclear

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
lineman they want is still unclear

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.120 
lineman they want is still unclear
although<00:04:52.630> he<00:04:53.259> said<00:04:53.530> we're<00:04:53.740> going<00:04:53.860> to<00:04:53.919> run<00:04:54.100> some

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.130 
although he said we're going to run some

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:56.279 
although he said we're going to run some
of<00:04:54.490> that<00:04:54.669> inside<00:04:55.120> zone<00:04:55.509> some<00:04:55.930> of<00:04:56.020> his<00:04:56.139> own

00:04:56.279 --> 00:04:56.289 
of that inside zone some of his own

00:04:56.289 --> 00:04:58.529 
of that inside zone some of his own
stuff<00:04:56.590> that<00:04:56.770> the<00:04:56.919> alignments<00:04:57.610> a<00:04:57.699> line<00:04:58.180> coach

00:04:58.529 --> 00:04:58.539 
stuff that the alignments a line coach

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:01.140 
stuff that the alignments a line coach
is<00:04:58.780> still<00:04:58.990> there<00:04:59.199> first<00:04:59.979> or<00:05:00.130> is<00:05:00.220> still<00:05:00.430> there<00:05:00.669> I

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.150 
is still there first or is still there I

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.570 
is still there first or is still there I
think<00:05:01.570> center<00:05:02.020> is<00:05:02.169> a<00:05:02.229> if<00:05:02.949> you<00:05:03.190> were<00:05:03.280> to<00:05:03.400> rank

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:03.580 
think center is a if you were to rank

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.129 
think center is a if you were to rank
the<00:05:03.820> needs<00:05:04.060> along<00:05:04.360> the<00:05:04.509> offensive<00:05:04.630> line<00:05:04.990> I

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:05.139 
the needs along the offensive line I

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:07.230 
the needs along the offensive line I
think<00:05:05.259> Center<00:05:05.740> is<00:05:05.860> a<00:05:05.889> big<00:05:06.130> need<00:05:06.340> maybe<00:05:07.060> you

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 
think Center is a big need maybe you

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.210 
think Center is a big need maybe you
have<00:05:07.539> licked<00:05:08.139> and<00:05:08.259> stagger<00:05:08.620> on<00:05:08.740> the<00:05:08.860> roster

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:09.220 
have licked and stagger on the roster

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.310 
have licked and stagger on the roster
that<00:05:09.370> can<00:05:09.490> fill<00:05:09.789> in<00:05:09.970> that<00:05:10.419> spot<00:05:10.840> then<00:05:11.050> you<00:05:11.169> need

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:11.320 
that can fill in that spot then you need

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.999 
that can fill in that spot then you need
to<00:05:11.440> go<00:05:11.560> get<00:05:11.889> another<00:05:12.160> guard<00:05:12.520> to<00:05:13.120> replace<00:05:13.479> him

00:05:13.999 --> 00:05:14.009 
to go get another guard to replace him

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:16.200 
to go get another guard to replace him
Polumbus<00:05:15.009> would<00:05:15.220> not<00:05:15.430> be<00:05:15.610> the<00:05:15.789> number<00:05:16.180> one

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:16.210 
Polumbus would not be the number one

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:18.360 
Polumbus would not be the number one

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:18.370 
need for me as I look at that offensive

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:20.370 
need for me as I look at that offensive
line<00:05:18.400> but<00:05:18.910> you<00:05:19.509> certainly<00:05:19.810> would<00:05:20.110> like<00:05:20.259> to

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:20.380 
line but you certainly would like to

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.770 
line but you certainly would like to
upgrade<00:05:20.560> that<00:05:21.190> position<00:05:21.729> and<00:05:21.940> get<00:05:22.330> something

upgrade that position and get something
that's<00:05:22.990> better<00:05:23.410> but<00:05:23.770> you<00:05:24.130> look<00:05:24.310> at<00:05:24.430> right

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.610

that the tight end position was going to

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:45.810 
that the tight end position was going to

game<00:05:57.669> suspension<00:05:57.960> so<00:05:58.960> I<00:05:59.289> think<00:05:59.349> that<00:05:59.530> era

00:06:00.029 --> 00:06:00.039 
game suspension so I think that era

00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:02.370 
game suspension so I think that era
moves<00:06:00.610> on<00:06:00.849> in<00:06:01.120> the<00:06:01.210> potential<00:06:01.750> that<00:06:01.900> was<00:06:02.080> Fred

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:02.380 
moves on in the potential that was Fred

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:04.050 
moves on in the potential that was Fred
Davis<00:06:02.620> in<00:06:02.919> Washington<00:06:03.460> I<00:06:03.580> don't<00:06:03.759> think<00:06:03.940> is

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:04.060 
Davis in Washington I don't think is

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:06.629 
Davis in Washington I don't think is
going<00:06:04.210> to<00:06:04.270> ever<00:06:04.599> be<00:06:05.020> realized<00:06:05.500> you<00:06:06.159> the

00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:06.639 
going to ever be realized you the

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:09.480 
going to ever be realized you the
potential<00:06:07.360> at<00:06:07.630> tight<00:06:07.780> end<00:06:07.810> is<00:06:08.050> Jordan<00:06:08.349> Reed<00:06:08.500> he

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:09.490 
potential at tight end is Jordan Reed he

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:11.490 
potential at tight end is Jordan Reed he
we<00:06:09.639> saw<00:06:09.880> enough<00:06:10.210> of<00:06:10.389> him<00:06:10.630> to<00:06:10.659> know<00:06:11.110> that<00:06:11.349> that

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:11.500 
we saw enough of him to know that that
