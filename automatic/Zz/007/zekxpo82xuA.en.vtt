00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:10.200
 yow people welcome and nice that you look 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.670
 to new part of sibbald and if you 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.719
 my voice a different kind the i am 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.429
 maybe a new microphone is 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.809
 temporary is maybe me forever 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.000
 do n't know and I have you so much again 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.289
 to report because what do these two major do 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.810
 walls here 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.279
 trunk you explain quickly we have 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.220
 very many members added last 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.900
 time and you can register for one 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.980
 mind in protest is for a pvp 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.210
 kontest 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.910
 and that means then we look 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.790
 which people are good is also slightly less 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.680
 to see what we will do with it 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.260
 and if you think so the series is running 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.300
 very loud, because I live 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.110
 stream this series on shabat quite well 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.629
 often 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.219
 you can follow me witjes twitch that 4 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.200
 slash people soon 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.840
 I stream live or when I go live in it 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.670
 it usually gets off and then I go everything 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.350
 to do and I don't film or say that 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.789
 I was not on youtube 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.289
 so if you think what the form is about 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.699
 yes that's right it is still warm now 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.920
 because we have three prisoners there 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.470
 caltex doesn't have a drum like mine 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.860
 ideas from some will but i have 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.710
 for example, do not show that we 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.780
 oh to give position and just 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.500
 don't show that we really do 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:18.440
 have good luck 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.670
 so if you also think 80 then you can 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.200
 follow me on twitch 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.800
 and then you can see when you live 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.660
 stream and then the wi-fi I have is 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.729
 always very cozy most of the time 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:31.490
 or my record is now so far and 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.960
 90 look like really subtle of me 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.020
 i again i think life smart is really super 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.020
 nice 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.780
 no what and oh yes the query is also or the 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.910
 the couples ever meines very big 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.680
 has always been quick to see that will 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:45.830
 sit comfortably there with you you know beautiful 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:50.540
 made doors in it and so greasy nagoya 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:51.860
 before I forget top 5 and slash tip 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.560
 yes we are already the number five boys 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.119
 you restore number 5 from the top five 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.100
 seven seas of the entire server so that 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:01.220
 is pretty sick you can think about it 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.680
 and if i show them at five then do 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.990
 number 4 number 4 in the way say 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.250
 but that is also very hopeful of a de 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.899
 service we just number five and 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.209
 celebrate i tell you 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.980
 and this is our good eye 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:15.750
 will appear to 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:19.170
 what does our my boys do 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.860
 Click throws and he is as if I like 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.360
 triton 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.070
 if I was promised another side my 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.320
 back here 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:30.480
 yes I think it is here and then here 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:31.830
 oh and then holy shit what the fuck 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.420

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.270
 so still that i am really into being 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.530

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.810
 tjok very thick occurrence of a de 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.780
 fabrics all have a drum roll 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:46.110
 I didn't pass through the slots at all 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.820
 very close but the members are too 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.920

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.480
