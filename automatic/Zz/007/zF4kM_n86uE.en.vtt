 horizontal plate we see 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.340
 week ordinal numbers 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:32.669

 next to the rocks. 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:19.409
 the amount of the fee here in this column will be 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:22.170
 display the total amount of your mode 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:26.490
 cause you nose for all purposes on that 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:29.430
 week that is here for example 1 week is 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.610
 April 20 and here and when you will have 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:35.070
 created and target labels you will see 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:38.280
 the amount of wear further column balance on 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.829
 balance will show how much money 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.500
 respectively for which of the weeks you have 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.450
 on balance more access and finally 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.619
 column replenish the balance needed for 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:53.549
 so that you can plan ahead 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:55.890
 what week and how much do you need 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.700
 carry a super money box to pay for your 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.750
 prices and now let's take an example 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.780
 look at how it works 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.710
 this label will create several goals well 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:10.759
 for example in the fourth week of sun 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:12.920
 target for $ 10 digits amount mode 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:17.600
 the matter of dispersion, that is, we have chosen 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:24.850
 threads 4 here we take part week 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:24.850
 the current week we put push the button 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:37.670
 here we see that we will have four 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:40.820
 front of 4 weeks we see the date when we have 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:44.510
 in 1 4 weeks there will be our payout here 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:45.920
 we see the amount of what has changed in our 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.610
 other decks. 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:53.840
 we see that in the column the amount of the contribution 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:56.989
 appeared on each week the figure 10 then 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.769
 have ship weekly installment we have 10 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:02.810
 dollars over four weeks 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:06.680
 to us in the balance column on the balance 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:08.390
 we are displayed in this box 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.060
 see now this is red 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:13.010
 it means we have a minus because the balance 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:17.150
 you didn't replenish what happens when 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:19.220
 we will replenish the balance of your full 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:22.310
 debt in this column will be 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:25.250
 display minus minus value 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:28.489
 with a minus the biggest figure here we are 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:32.440
 We see that she is 40 we replenish 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:32.440
 balance at 40. 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:38.630
 and see that our red value is with us 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:42.200
 disappeared here is our goal completely 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.620
 paid for the third week you would go 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.750
 along 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.950
 and in the fourth week we see that 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.440
 leave on our balance sheet 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.540
 is 60 dollars let's create 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:54.470
 another goal and see how to change 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:59.110
 situation on the deeds create yet 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:04:04.470
 one goal dollars here we see how 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:08.110
 our goal here it is actually 105 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:11.620
 we see that the amount of the contribution has changed 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:14.440
 the first four weeks she became 20 y 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:16.420
 we are now directorate about 10 dollars a 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:19.959
 mean total weekly installment 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:22.330
 will be 20 dollars and we are not here already 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:26.560
 enough money to pay 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:28.720
 here we also see which week and 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:33.040
 how much money we lack we see 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:35.890
 that May 4 is missing $ 20 we can 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:39.970
 this day to make 20 can make 40 

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:41.410
 thousand as already it will be convenient and will transfer 40 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:45.190
 next week they just need 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:48.160
 will already contribute will make 40 see what we 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:51.870
 completely increased our debt then 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:55.210
 have we fully paid your goals and 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.280
 when the payment date comes from us on 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.350
 balance sheet 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:02.490
 available balance here will be 135 dollars 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:05.800
 which we can plan for spit 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:09.370
 that's the way they got it out and everything is left 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:13.000
 by zeros by the same principle you can 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:15.280
 create other targets in accordance 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:19.030
 with the capabilities of your personal 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:21.970
 Finally, a few rules are very important. 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:24.250
 by the way on working with the tablet in any way 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:28.150
 case, do not use the button further for 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:30.910
 cell cleaning better use here 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:33.400
 in this way there are even two ways here 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:36.190
 look we select a small square here side by side 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:38.680
 give our dial with the left mouse button 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:40.030
 we allocate plant here he 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.830
 leaves such a cross 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:46.169
 hold down the left mouse button and 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:49.120
 drag on this cell busy 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:51.729
 let go and this cell from us becomes 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:54.970
 free so we more often america 

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:57.600
 or using the kontrol price keys 

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:59.950
 this is a sleep copy a clean ring cell 

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:03.010
 insert it into the cell you want 

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:06.640
 release the control box and man 

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:08.890
 relieved them even if you want 

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:10.980
 completely clear the table and start 

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:13.970
