00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
few at a time you build up a stash i can

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.370

but<00:02:19.940> i<00:02:20.030> get<00:02:20.209> four<00:02:20.480> to<00:02:20.569> five<00:02:20.750> applications<00:02:21.260> on

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
but i get four to five applications on

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.880 
but i get four to five applications on
both<00:02:21.800> eyes<00:02:22.040> out<00:02:22.280> of<00:02:22.310> one<00:02:22.550> of<00:02:22.580> these<00:02:22.670> wands<00:02:23.300> um<00:02:23.930> I

formula<00:02:49.730> I<00:02:49.880> know<00:02:50.000> some<00:02:50.269> people<00:02:50.330> prefer<00:02:50.870> a

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
formula I know some people prefer a

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.800 
formula I know some people prefer a
wetter<00:02:51.320> formula<00:02:51.950> i<00:02:52.390> personally<00:02:53.390> prefer<00:02:53.420> a

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
wetter formula i personally prefer a

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.570 
wetter formula i personally prefer a
dryer<00:02:54.140> formula<00:02:54.769> because<00:02:55.100> i<00:02:55.220> think<00:02:55.280> it

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
dryer formula because i think it

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.960 
dryer formula because i think it
prevents<00:02:56.330> clumping<00:02:56.810> um<00:02:57.410> and<00:02:58.340> I<00:02:58.459> think<00:02:58.760> it

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
prevents clumping um and I think it

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.790 
prevents clumping um and I think it
dries<00:02:59.660> quicker<00:02:59.959> which<00:03:00.170> is<00:03:00.320> nice<00:03:00.500> because<00:03:00.680> you

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 
dries quicker which is nice because you

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.410 
dries quicker which is nice because you
can<00:03:00.890> go<00:03:01.070> right<00:03:01.250> back<00:03:01.370> and<00:03:01.430> forth<00:03:01.640> between<00:03:02.060> your

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
can go right back and forth between your

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.420 
can go right back and forth between your
two<00:03:03.230> coats<00:03:03.500> and<00:03:03.830> do<00:03:03.950> them<00:03:04.070> really<00:03:04.190> quickly<00:03:06.430> um

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
two coats and do them really quickly um

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.060 
two coats and do them really quickly um
so<00:03:08.120> this<00:03:08.360> is<00:03:08.570> actually<00:03:08.720> a<00:03:08.989> pretty<00:03:09.709> interesting

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.070 
so this is actually a pretty interesting

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:13.330 
so this is actually a pretty interesting
product<00:03:10.930> it's<00:03:11.930> good<00:03:12.320> if<00:03:12.440> you<00:03:12.560> travel<00:03:13.070> a<00:03:13.160> lot

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.070 
too because there's no liquid so that's

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:17.830 
too because there's no liquid so that's
one<00:03:16.220> less<00:03:16.250> thing<00:03:16.430> you<00:03:16.640> have<00:03:16.730> to<00:03:16.940> put<00:03:17.180> your<00:03:17.329> sort

drugstore mascaras are anywhere from
eight<00:05:56.340> to<00:05:56.580> the<00:05:56.610> eleven<00:05:57.120> dollars<00:05:57.300> these<00:05:57.690> days

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:57.930 
eight to the eleven dollars these days

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:01.279 
eight to the eleven dollars these days
so<00:05:58.199> it's<00:05:58.620> about<00:05:59.069> the<00:05:59.310> same<00:05:59.750> if<00:06:00.750> not<00:06:00.810> a<00:06:01.050> little

00:06:01.279 --> 00:06:01.289 
so it's about the same if not a little

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:02.930 
so it's about the same if not a little
bit<00:06:01.409> cheaper<00:06:01.830> if<00:06:01.949> you<00:06:01.979> just<00:06:02.310> opted<00:06:02.520> for<00:06:02.909> the

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:02.940 
bit cheaper if you just opted for the

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:07.339 
bit cheaper if you just opted for the
the<00:06:03.599> cake<00:06:03.840> um<00:06:05.569> now<00:06:06.569> the<00:06:06.629> reason<00:06:06.900> I<00:06:07.080> wouldn't

00:06:07.339 --> 00:06:07.349 
the cake um now the reason I wouldn't

00:06:07.349 --> 00:06:09.020 
the cake um now the reason I wouldn't
recommend<00:06:07.590> using<00:06:07.860> it<00:06:08.039> water<00:06:08.310> is<00:06:08.460> because<00:06:08.849> it

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:09.030 
recommend using it water is because it

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:11.119

necessarily my everyday mascara

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:41.300 
necessarily my everyday mascara
especially<00:06:40.409> not<00:06:40.560> early<00:06:40.860> in<00:06:40.949> the<00:06:41.009> morning

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:41.310 
especially not early in the morning

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:43.399 
especially not early in the morning
because<00:06:41.460> it<00:06:42.240> does<00:06:42.449> take<00:06:42.659> a<00:06:42.690> little<00:06:42.930> bit<00:06:43.169> more

00:06:43.399 --> 00:06:43.409
