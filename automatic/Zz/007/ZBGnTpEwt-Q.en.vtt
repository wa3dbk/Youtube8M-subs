00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
now we're looking for fold number 2 so

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.420 
now we're looking for fold number 2 so
we<00:01:41.939> have<00:01:42.150> our<00:01:42.329> two<00:01:42.659> number<00:01:43.020> twos<00:01:43.409> and<00:01:43.740> we<00:01:44.369> are

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
inch simply so that I'm not cutting my

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.759 
inch simply so that I'm not cutting my
template<00:02:38.010> through<00:02:38.220> the<00:02:38.370> many<00:02:38.549> layers<00:02:38.880> at<00:02:39.769> the

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
template through the many layers at the

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:42.559 
template through the many layers at the
bottom<00:02:41.370> you're<00:02:41.670> going<00:02:41.819> to<00:02:41.940> find<00:02:42.180> that<00:02:42.390> you

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
bottom you're going to find that you

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:45.320 
bottom you're going to find that you
folded<00:02:43.049> a<00:02:43.140> point<00:02:43.560> and<00:02:43.920> so<00:02:44.819> look<00:02:45.090> at<00:02:45.180> the

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
folded a point and so look at the

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.020 
folded a point and so look at the
template<00:02:45.840> find<00:02:46.410> the<00:02:46.560> word<00:02:46.739> large<00:02:47.130> again<00:02:47.580> and

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
template find the word large again and

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.870 
template find the word large again and
we're<00:02:48.599> going<00:02:48.690> to<00:02:48.750> take<00:02:49.049> our<00:02:49.349> hand<00:02:49.799> needle<00:02:50.310> and

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:36.329 
needle from the thread and then take the

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:41.840 
needle from the thread and then take the
two<00:03:36.750> threads<00:03:37.230> and<00:03:38.120> simply<00:03:39.120> tie<00:03:39.540> a<00:03:39.569> knot<00:03:40.850> we're

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
two threads and simply tie a knot we're

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.990 
two threads and simply tie a knot we're
gonna<00:03:42.030> pull<00:03:42.269> that<00:03:42.299> together<00:03:42.780> and<00:03:43.760> then<00:03:44.760> we're

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
gonna pull that together and then we're

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.930 
gonna pull that together and then we're
going<00:03:45.150> to<00:03:45.269> go<00:03:45.510> ahead<00:03:45.870> and<00:03:46.079> do<00:03:46.230> another<00:03:46.260> it

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
going to go ahead and do another it

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:57.820 
going to go ahead and do another it
overhand<00:03:48.799> knot

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:57.830 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:01.310 

and<00:03:58.830> I<00:03:58.950> do<00:03:59.340> a<00:03:59.370> third<00:03:59.760> one<00:03:59.790> just<00:04:00.510> to<00:04:00.750> be<00:04:00.870> secure

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.320 
and I do a third one just to be secure

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.980 
and I do a third one just to be secure
that<00:04:01.590> so<00:04:01.800> the<00:04:01.950> flower<00:04:02.160> isn't<00:04:02.520> going<00:04:03.030> to<00:04:03.240> come

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:03.990 
that so the flower isn't going to come

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:09.050 
that so the flower isn't going to come
apart<00:04:04.350> later<00:04:05.540> flip<00:04:06.540> it<00:04:06.690> over<00:04:06.840> and<00:04:07.640> voila<00:04:08.640> we

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
apart later flip it over and voila we

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:14.810 
apart later flip it over and voila we
have<00:04:09.720> our<00:04:10.440> frill<00:04:11.130> flower<00:04:11.550> template<00:04:12.210> pattern
