00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.310 
asked to do another video with my

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
glasses okay what the first question I

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.279 
glasses okay what the first question I
got<00:00:13.349> is<00:00:14.360> do<00:00:15.360> you<00:00:15.450> need<00:00:15.599> your<00:00:15.719> glasses<00:00:15.809> for

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
got is do you need your glasses for

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.529 
got is do you need your glasses for
reading<00:00:16.440> or<00:00:16.770> for<00:00:17.430> distance<00:00:17.850> I<00:00:19.939> tend<00:00:20.939> to<00:00:21.210> wear

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
reading or for distance I tend to wear

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.340 
reading or for distance I tend to wear
them<00:00:21.720> for<00:00:21.750> distance<00:00:22.500> because<00:00:23.160> I<00:00:24.080> can't<00:00:25.080> really

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
them for distance because I can't really

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.960 
them for distance because I can't really
say<00:00:25.680> far<00:00:25.949> away<00:00:26.130> without<00:00:26.310> it<00:00:26.550> being<00:00:26.670> super

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
say far away without it being super

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:27.410 
say far away without it being super
fuzzy

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
fuzzy

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.049 
fuzzy
so<00:00:28.320> I<00:00:28.939> guess<00:00:29.939> away<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.240> distance<00:00:30.740> but<00:00:31.740> I<00:00:32.130> mean

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
so I guess away the distance but I mean

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.729 
so I guess away the distance but I mean
really<00:00:33.390> with<00:00:33.540> them<00:00:33.750> really<00:00:34.440> early<00:00:34.620> in<00:00:34.680> the

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739
