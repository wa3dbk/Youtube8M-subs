00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
will be a temperature test with a laser

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.620 
will be a temperature test with a laser

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.030 
dermal well thermal gun infrared right
it's<00:00:12.870> gonna<00:00:13.049> test<00:00:13.290> the<00:00:13.440> temperature<00:00:13.620> out<00:00:14.009> of

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
it's gonna test the temperature out of

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.589 
it's gonna test the temperature out of
the<00:00:14.309> ps4<00:00:14.639> and<00:00:14.969> now<00:00:15.030> the<00:00:15.089> reason<00:00:15.389> I'm<00:00:15.450> doing

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
the ps4 and now the reason I'm doing

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.230 
the ps4 and now the reason I'm doing
this<00:00:15.750> is<00:00:15.870> because<00:00:16.080> the<00:00:16.350> laptop<00:00:16.800> cooler<00:00:17.130> I<00:00:17.520> want

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
this is because the laptop cooler I want

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.269 
this is because the laptop cooler I want
to<00:00:18.330> see<00:00:18.480> the<00:00:18.630> laptop<00:00:18.810> cooler<00:00:19.320> actually<00:00:20.070> is

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
to see the laptop cooler actually is

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.259 
to see the laptop cooler actually is
cooling<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.240> ps4<00:00:21.630> somewhat<00:00:22.380> in<00:00:22.500> some<00:00:22.740> ways<00:00:23.269> so

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
cooling the ps4 somewhat in some ways so

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.660 
cooling the ps4 somewhat in some ways so
let's<00:00:24.660> do<00:00:24.840> this<00:00:25.050> now<00:00:25.260> right<00:00:25.470> now<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:25.710> laptop

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
let's do this now right now the laptop

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.269 
let's do this now right now the laptop
cooler<00:00:26.910> is<00:00:27.150> running<00:00:27.570> as<00:00:27.689> we<00:00:27.840> speak<00:00:28.279> alright

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
cooler is running as we speak alright

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.890 
cooler is running as we speak alright
he's<00:00:29.400> been<00:00:29.550> running<00:00:29.789> for<00:00:30.060> about<00:00:30.269> an<00:00:30.390> hour<00:00:30.539> or

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
he's been running for about an hour or

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.010 
he's been running for about an hour or
so<00:00:31.109> so<00:00:31.380> you<00:00:32.340> know<00:00:32.489> give<00:00:32.759> it<00:00:32.880> a<00:00:32.910> true<00:00:33.210> test<00:00:33.600> so

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
so so you know give it a true test so

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.660 
so so you know give it a true test so
right<00:00:34.260> now<00:00:34.440> I'm<00:00:34.559> gonna<00:00:34.680> test<00:00:35.040> it<00:00:35.160> out<00:00:35.250> and<00:00:35.430> see

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
right now I'm gonna test it out and see

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.340 
right now I'm gonna test it out and see
what<00:00:35.820> temperature's<00:00:36.270> we<00:00:36.420> get<00:00:36.660> well<00:00:37.110> this<00:00:37.230> is

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
what temperature's we get well this is

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.540 
what temperature's we get well this is
really<00:00:37.559> quick<00:00:37.800> and<00:00:37.829> then<00:00:38.070> we'll<00:00:38.160> turn<00:00:38.309> it<00:00:38.460> our

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
really quick and then we'll turn it our

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.069 
really quick and then we'll turn it our
laptop<00:00:38.969> cooler<00:00:39.180> off<00:00:39.390> and<00:00:39.719> then<00:00:39.809> what's<00:00:39.960> at

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
laptop cooler off and then what's at

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.830 
laptop cooler off and then what's at
that<00:00:40.260> -<00:00:40.469> so<00:00:41.129> let's<00:00:41.550> do<00:00:41.670> this<00:00:41.820> now<00:00:42.090> here<00:00:42.300> we<00:00:42.390> go

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:44.840 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.880 

aim<00:00:45.840> it<00:00:45.960> around<00:00:46.200> here<00:00:46.710> and<00:00:46.860> as<00:00:47.460> you<00:00:47.640> can<00:00:47.700> see<00:00:47.850> I

aim it around here and as you can see I

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.400 
aim it around here and as you can see I
moved<00:00:49.890> around<00:00:50.629> different<00:00:51.629> different<00:00:52.140> parts

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
moved around different different parts

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.700 
moved around different different parts
of<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.590> ps4<00:00:53.070> does<00:00:53.399> read<00:00:53.670> up<00:00:53.820> higher<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.420> lower

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:05.320

the right front so there you go those
are<00:03:12.480> the<00:03:12.660> temperature<00:03:13.080> readings<00:03:13.410> we're

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
are the temperature readings we're

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:21.470 
are the temperature readings we're
having<00:03:13.950> right<00:03:14.100> now<00:03:18.980> and<00:03:20.210> that's<00:03:21.210> what<00:03:21.390> the

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
having right now and that's what the

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:37.310 
having right now and that's what the
laptop<00:03:21.930> colder<00:03:22.230> on

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.660 

so<00:03:38.320> we<00:03:38.500> got<00:03:38.650> a<00:03:38.680> highs<00:03:38.890> a<00:03:38.920> hundred<00:03:39.430> and<00:03:39.520> eight

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
so we got a highs a hundred and eight

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.910 
so we got a highs a hundred and eight
degrees<00:03:39.820> Fahrenheit<00:03:40.630> and<00:03:40.960> decided<00:03:41.530> to<00:03:41.560> ps4

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 
degrees Fahrenheit and decided to ps4

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.950 
degrees Fahrenheit and decided to ps4
now<00:03:42.310> I'm<00:03:42.370> gonna<00:03:42.490> turn<00:03:42.790> down<00:03:42.820> the<00:03:43.480> cooler<00:03:43.690> off

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:43.960 
now I'm gonna turn down the cooler off

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.420 
now I'm gonna turn down the cooler off
and<00:03:44.320> see<00:03:44.650> what's<00:03:44.800> the<00:03:44.890> difference<00:03:45.280> on<00:03:45.400> that

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
and see what's the difference on that

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.640 
and see what's the difference on that
and<00:03:45.880> obviously<00:03:46.630> right<00:03:46.900> here<00:03:47.110> and<00:03:47.230> this<00:03:47.350> side

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
and obviously right here and this side

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.290 
and obviously right here and this side
was<00:03:47.950> not<00:03:48.340> much<00:03:48.640> I<00:03:49.000> mean<00:03:49.240> I<00:03:50.940> think<00:03:51.940> it<00:03:52.000> wasn't<00:03:52.120> in

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:52.300 
was not much I mean I think it wasn't in

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:53.880 
was not much I mean I think it wasn't in
Hades<00:03:52.930> probably<00:03:53.320> was<00:03:53.500> it

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
Hades probably was it

00:03:53.890 --> 00:04:03.180 
Hades probably was it
that's<00:03:54.700> what<00:03:54.850> 79<00:03:55.420> now<00:03:58.500> then<00:03:59.500> a<00:03:59.710> knee<00:03:59.770> so<00:04:02.190> okay

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
that's what 79 now then a knee so okay

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.340 
that's what 79 now then a knee so okay
so<00:04:03.220> now<00:04:03.430> we're<00:04:03.580> going<00:04:03.670> to<00:04:03.730> turn<00:04:03.820> to<00:04:04.260> pull<00:04:05.260> her

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.350 
so now we're going to turn to pull her

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.230 
so now we're going to turn to pull her
off<00:04:05.530> and<00:04:05.950> bear<00:04:06.280> with<00:04:06.460> me

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:07.240 
off and bear with me

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.980 
off and bear with me

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:10.990 
hit the button here okay now the coolers

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:15.840 
hit the button here okay now the coolers
all<00:04:12.120> okay<00:04:13.120> so<00:04:13.150> now<00:04:13.600> the<00:04:14.590> laptop<00:04:15.070> cooler<00:04:15.340> is<00:04:15.580> off

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:15.850 
all okay so now the laptop cooler is off

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:19.530 
all okay so now the laptop cooler is off
and<00:04:17.580> we're<00:04:18.580> gonna<00:04:18.730> test<00:04:18.940> the<00:04:19.030> temperature<00:04:19.420> now

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:19.540 
and we're gonna test the temperature now

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:20.880 
and we're gonna test the temperature now
if<00:04:19.600> they're<00:04:19.780> running<00:04:19.900> for<00:04:20.200> about<00:04:20.410> 45<00:04:20.860> minutes

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:20.890 
if they're running for about 45 minutes

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:24.360 
if they're running for about 45 minutes
to<00:04:21.250> an<00:04:21.280> hour<00:04:21.400> this<00:04:21.670> ps4<00:04:22.000> and<00:04:22.960> is<00:04:23.650> test<00:04:24.160> the

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
to an hour this ps4 and is test the

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:25.530 
to an hour this ps4 and is test the
temperature<00:04:24.580> to<00:04:25.000> see<00:04:25.120> what<00:04:25.240> readings<00:04:25.480> are

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.540 
temperature to see what readings are

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:28.680 
temperature to see what readings are
gonna<00:04:25.660> get<00:04:25.870> right<00:04:26.020> now<00:04:27.150> so<00:04:28.150> we're<00:04:28.480> aiming

drives up and 84 yeah 84 all right got

00:06:49.599 --> 00:06:50.639 
drives up and 84 yeah 84 all right got
the<00:06:49.689> temperatures<00:06:50.169> right<00:06:50.349> here<00:06:50.469> in<00:06:50.559> the

00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:50.649 
the temperatures right here in the

00:06:50.649 --> 00:06:52.559 
the temperatures right here in the
readings<00:06:51.009> and<00:06:51.189> check<00:06:51.369> this<00:06:51.519> out<00:06:51.789> the<00:06:51.999> Green<00:06:52.300> is

00:06:52.559 --> 00:06:52.569 
readings and check this out the Green is

00:06:52.569 --> 00:06:54.959 
readings and check this out the Green is
the<00:06:52.599> laptop<00:06:53.019> cooler<00:06:53.559> being<00:06:53.919> on<00:06:54.069> and<00:06:54.369> the<00:06:54.729> red

00:06:54.959 --> 00:06:54.969 
the laptop cooler being on and the red

00:06:54.969 --> 00:06:57.689 
the laptop cooler being on and the red
is<00:06:55.269> the<00:06:55.449> laptop<00:06:55.689> cooler<00:06:56.379> being<00:06:56.769> off<00:06:57.039> as<00:06:57.369> you

00:06:57.689 --> 00:06:57.699 
is the laptop cooler being off as you

00:06:57.699 --> 00:06:59.189 
is the laptop cooler being off as you
can<00:06:57.849> see<00:06:58.029> it's<00:06:58.269> a<00:06:58.360> big<00:06:58.539> difference<00:06:58.959> in

00:06:59.189 --> 00:06:59.199 
can see it's a big difference in

00:06:59.199 --> 00:07:01.559 
can see it's a big difference in
temperature<00:06:59.740> and<00:07:00.129> it<00:07:00.610> is<00:07:00.819> cooling<00:07:01.240> off<00:07:01.389> the

00:07:01.559 --> 00:07:01.569 
temperature and it is cooling off the

00:07:01.569 --> 00:07:03.659 
temperature and it is cooling off the
ps4<00:07:01.899> so<00:07:02.319> get<00:07:02.469> into<00:07:02.680> a<00:07:02.709> laptop<00:07:02.919> cooler<00:07:03.369> it<00:07:03.639> will

00:07:03.659 --> 00:07:03.669 
ps4 so get into a laptop cooler it will
