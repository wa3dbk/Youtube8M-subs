time to stock up I'll probably go to
Target<00:03:25.590> and<00:03:25.680> Walmart<00:03:25.890> and<00:03:26.340> down<00:03:26.820> the<00:03:26.910> road

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
Target and Walmart and down the road

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.670 
Target and Walmart and down the road
once<00:03:27.209> I<00:03:27.300> finish<00:03:27.540> my<00:03:27.660> bobbles<00:03:28.050> actually<00:03:28.530> do<00:03:28.650> a

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
once I finish my bobbles actually do a

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.699 
once I finish my bobbles actually do a
you<00:03:29.340> know<00:03:29.459> redesign<00:03:29.940> of<00:03:30.060> this<00:03:30.270> so<00:03:31.050> what<00:03:31.530> I<00:03:31.560> was

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
you know redesign of this so what I was

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.050 
you know redesign of this so what I was
thinking<00:03:32.040> is<00:03:32.130> that<00:03:32.250> I<00:03:32.310> could<00:03:32.459> probably<00:03:32.700> store

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
thinking is that I could probably store

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.990 
thinking is that I could probably store
some<00:03:33.300> stuff<00:03:33.540> in<00:03:33.900> the<00:03:34.170> spare<00:03:34.410> tire<00:03:34.650> area<00:03:35.220> you

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
some stuff in the spare tire area you

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.770 
some stuff in the spare tire area you
know<00:03:36.060> I'm<00:03:36.150> probably<00:03:36.270> gonna<00:03:36.510> have<00:03:36.600> to<00:03:36.660> do

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
know I'm probably gonna have to do

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.449 
know I'm probably gonna have to do
similar<00:03:37.110> what<00:03:37.620> I'm<00:03:37.709> doing<00:03:37.860> with<00:03:37.950> my<00:03:38.010> bob<00:03:38.250> is

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
similar what I'm doing with my bob is

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:39.949 
similar what I'm doing with my bob is
have<00:03:38.730> things<00:03:38.940> in<00:03:39.060> little<00:03:39.240> compartments<00:03:39.810> you

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
have things in little compartments you

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:41.900 
have things in little compartments you
know<00:03:40.350> these<00:03:40.740> two<00:03:40.980> seats<00:03:41.250> the<00:03:41.490> seats<00:03:41.730> up<00:03:41.880> here

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
know these two seats the seats up here

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.180 
know these two seats the seats up here
right<00:03:42.480> now<00:03:42.630> so<00:03:42.900> I<00:03:43.260> could<00:03:43.380> possibly<00:03:43.920> store

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
right now so I could possibly store

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:45.910 
right now so I could possibly store
stick<00:03:44.430> just<00:03:44.580> like<00:03:44.670> this<00:03:44.940> underneath<00:03:45.300> the<00:03:45.480> seat

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
stick just like this underneath the seat

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.050 
stick just like this underneath the seat
preferred<00:03:46.920> but<00:03:47.070> not<00:03:47.220> to<00:03:47.310> slide<00:03:47.519> around<00:03:47.670> these

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
preferred but not to slide around these

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.060 
preferred but not to slide around these
two<00:03:48.269> front<00:03:48.540> seats<00:03:48.810> also<00:03:49.410> have<00:03:49.680> a<00:03:49.709> little<00:03:49.980> bit

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
two front seats also have a little bit

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:51.620 
two front seats also have a little bit
of<00:03:50.160> storage<00:03:50.400> underneath<00:03:50.670> again<00:03:51.180> it'd<00:03:51.450> have<00:03:51.570> to

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
of storage underneath again it'd have to

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.630 
of storage underneath again it'd have to
be<00:03:51.720> fairly<00:03:51.959> small<00:03:52.410> so<00:03:53.070> I<00:03:53.130> don't<00:03:53.340> think<00:03:53.459> I<00:03:53.489> could

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
be fairly small so I don't think I could

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.090 
be fairly small so I don't think I could
fit<00:03:53.730> a<00:03:53.760> full-sized<00:03:54.239> guest<00:03:54.510> han't<00:03:54.870> gas<00:03:55.709> cannon

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
fit a full-sized guest han't gas cannon

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.340 
fit a full-sized guest han't gas cannon
here<00:03:56.280> or<00:03:56.400> anything<00:03:56.580> like<00:03:56.790> that<00:03:57.019> and<00:03:58.019> I<00:03:58.140> might

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
here or anything like that and I might

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:59.780 
here or anything like that and I might
be<00:03:58.470> able<00:03:58.530> to<00:03:58.650> put<00:03:58.950> the<00:03:59.040> most<00:03:59.220> storage<00:03:59.519> in<00:03:59.610> here

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
be able to put the most storage in here

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.970 
be able to put the most storage in here
as<00:03:59.940> well<00:04:00.090> so<00:04:00.360> that's<00:04:01.290> kind<00:04:01.440> of<00:04:01.470> the<00:04:01.560> ideas<00:04:01.950> that

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
as well so that's kind of the ideas that

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.290 
as well so that's kind of the ideas that
I'm<00:04:02.160> having<00:04:02.430> right<00:04:02.519> now<00:04:02.700> I<00:04:02.730> don't<00:04:02.940> have<00:04:03.120> any

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:03.300
