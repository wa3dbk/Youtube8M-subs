00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
actually see that at the end of the

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.910 
actually see that at the end of the
second<00:01:26.490> version<00:01:26.700> of<00:01:26.970> this<00:01:27.090> war<00:01:27.479> /<00:01:27.770> slug<00:01:28.770> this

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
second version of this war / slug this

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.469 
second version of this war / slug this
type<00:01:29.130> of<00:01:29.159> level<00:01:29.430> so<00:01:31.130> it's<00:01:32.130> obviously<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.610> bit

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
type of level so it's obviously a bit

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:34.940 
type of level so it's obviously a bit
more<00:01:33.630> advanced<00:01:33.930> to<00:01:34.140> where<00:01:34.290> we<00:01:34.439> should<00:01:34.470> be<00:01:34.829> at

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
more advanced to where we should be at

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.399 
more advanced to where we should be at
this<00:01:35.070> moment

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:38.409 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:41.139 

now<00:01:39.409> we've<00:01:39.590> got<00:01:39.680> disappearing<00:01:40.610> platforms<00:01:41.030> we

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:41.149 
now we've got disappearing platforms we

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:43.569 
now we've got disappearing platforms we
don't<00:01:41.329> have<00:01:41.450> to<00:01:41.630> have<00:01:42.289> one<00:01:42.500> so<00:01:43.250> we're<00:01:43.369> going<00:01:43.490> to

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:43.579 
don't have to have one so we're going to

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:44.919 
don't have to have one so we're going to
find<00:01:43.700> that<00:01:43.789> easier<00:01:44.000> though<00:01:44.329> because<00:01:44.719> we're

00:01:44.919 --> 00:01:44.929 
find that easier though because we're

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:48.550 
find that easier though because we're
going<00:01:45.079> to<00:01:45.170> the<00:01:45.350> ride<00:01:47.170> that's<00:01:48.170> right<00:01:48.350> I'll

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560
