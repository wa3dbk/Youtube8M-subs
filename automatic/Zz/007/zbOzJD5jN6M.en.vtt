water it and into it today I need to
weigh<00:02:57.830> down<00:02:58.040> the<00:02:58.099> other<00:02:58.400> side<00:02:58.489> too<00:02:58.910> because

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 
weigh down the other side too because

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:01.119 
weigh down the other side too because
the<00:02:59.420> wind<00:02:59.629> can<00:02:59.810> catch<00:03:00.019> that<00:03:00.319> flap<00:03:00.650> over<00:03:00.950> there

00:03:01.119 --> 00:03:01.129 
the wind can catch that flap over there

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:04.869 
the wind can catch that flap over there
flip<00:03:02.060> it<00:03:02.209> over<00:03:02.360> and<00:03:02.540> all<00:03:03.400> of<00:03:04.400> a<00:03:04.459> sudden<00:03:04.489> your

00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:04.879 
flip it over and all of a sudden your

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:06.640 
flip it over and all of a sudden your
ponds<00:03:05.120> draining<00:03:05.690> and<00:03:05.840> you've<00:03:05.959> got<00:03:06.170> a<00:03:06.200> big<00:03:06.440> mud

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
ponds draining and you've got a big mud

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.650 
ponds draining and you've got a big mud
hole<00:03:07.870> okay<00:03:08.870> it's<00:03:09.349> all<00:03:09.440> done

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
hole okay it's all done

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.610 
hole okay it's all done
isn't<00:03:11.660> it<00:03:11.720> beautiful<00:03:13.690> no<00:03:14.690> actually<00:03:15.230> right<00:03:15.260> now

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
isn't it beautiful no actually right now

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.910 
isn't it beautiful no actually right now
it's<00:03:15.950> just<00:03:16.040> about<00:03:16.489> full<00:03:17.410> so<00:03:18.410> at<00:03:18.530> this<00:03:18.650> point

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
it's just about full so at this point

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.960 
it's just about full so at this point
you<00:03:19.130> want<00:03:19.310> to<00:03:19.400> find<00:03:19.640> the<00:03:19.760> places<00:03:20.209> where<00:03:20.480> it's

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
you want to find the places where it's

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.410 
you want to find the places where it's
going<00:03:22.970> to<00:03:23.150> leak<00:03:23.390> out<00:03:23.599> first<00:03:24.019> and<00:03:25.420> start

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
going to leak out first and start

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.130 
going to leak out first and start
putting<00:03:26.629> dirt<00:03:26.959> under<00:03:27.379> that<00:03:27.560> area<00:03:28.420> so<00:03:29.420> that<00:03:29.750> it

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
putting dirt under that area so that it

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.770 
putting dirt under that area so that it
will<00:03:30.319> eventually<00:03:30.470> be<00:03:31.220> all<00:03:31.670> exactly<00:03:32.390> the<00:03:32.540> same

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
will eventually be all exactly the same

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.619 
will eventually be all exactly the same
level<00:03:33.019> and<00:03:33.230> you<00:03:33.319> know<00:03:33.440> what<00:03:33.620> I'm<00:03:33.769> really<00:03:34.220> lucky

00:03:34.619 --> 00:03:34.629 
level and you know what I'm really lucky

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:37.180 
level and you know what I'm really lucky
because<00:03:35.629> this<00:03:35.840> pond<00:03:36.170> is<00:03:36.319> coming<00:03:36.680> out<00:03:36.829> pretty

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
because this pond is coming out pretty

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:42.160 
because this pond is coming out pretty
level<00:03:38.530> all<00:03:39.530> the<00:03:39.769> way<00:03:39.890> around<00:03:40.810> you<00:03:41.810> can<00:03:41.989> see

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
level all the way around you can see

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:45.129 
level all the way around you can see
I've<00:03:42.290> already<00:03:42.620> added<00:03:42.799> my<00:03:43.129> first<00:03:43.430> fish<00:03:44.139> this

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:45.139 
I've already added my first fish this

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:47.819 
I've already added my first fish this
water<00:03:45.470> in<00:03:45.709> here<00:03:45.920> is<00:03:45.980> a<00:03:46.190> few<00:03:46.459> days<00:03:46.670> old<00:03:46.910> so<00:03:47.090> it's

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:47.829 
water in here is a few days old so it's

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:50.650 
water in here is a few days old so it's
the<00:03:48.829> chlorines<00:03:49.310> out<00:03:49.489> of<00:03:49.670> it<00:03:49.760> so<00:03:50.000> it's<00:03:50.180> safe<00:03:50.420> for

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
the chlorines out of it so it's safe for

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.580 
the chlorines out of it so it's safe for
fishies

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590
