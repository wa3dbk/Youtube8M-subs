00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:25.400
 ceramics is also that the pottery is 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:28.560
 well below downstairs there she is 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.940
 submerged also because the track places 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:35.819
 A little bit up because she has a 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:45.419
