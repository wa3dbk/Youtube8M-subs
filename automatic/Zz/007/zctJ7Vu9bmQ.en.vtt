it up stream just slowly and let the

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.210 
it up stream just slowly and let the
water<00:02:44.150> just<00:02:44.510> hit<00:02:44.959> the<00:02:45.200> little<00:02:45.410> blade<00:02:45.889> all<00:02:46.099> by

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
water just hit the little blade all by

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.280 
water just hit the little blade all by
itself<00:02:46.579> and<00:02:47.299> usually<00:02:47.599> they'll<00:02:47.780> hit<00:02:47.930> this<00:02:48.019> very

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
itself and usually they'll hit this very

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:49.990 
itself and usually they'll hit this very
aggressively<00:02:48.769> and<00:02:49.340> you<00:02:49.609> don't<00:02:49.760> really<00:02:49.849> need

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
aggressively and you don't really need

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.390 
aggressively and you don't really need
to<00:02:50.090> set<00:02:50.299> the<00:02:50.389> hook<00:02:50.540> that<00:02:50.840> hard<00:02:51.500> when<00:02:52.280> you're

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
to set the hook that hard when you're

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.190 
to set the hook that hard when you're
fishing<00:02:52.579> on<00:02:52.790> the<00:02:52.849> river<00:02:53.019> reeling<00:02:54.019> in<00:02:54.109> an

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
fishing on the river reeling in an

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.280 
fishing on the river reeling in an
upstream<00:02:54.590> because<00:02:55.400> usually<00:02:56.030> they'll<00:02:56.840> bite<00:02:57.109> it

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
upstream because usually they'll bite it

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.099 
upstream because usually they'll bite it
and<00:02:57.470> then<00:02:57.919> it'll<00:02:58.790> go<00:02:59.000> downstream<00:02:59.540> and<00:02:59.870> right

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:00.109 
and then it'll go downstream and right

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:01.270 
and then it'll go downstream and right
when<00:03:00.230> you<00:03:00.290> start<00:03:00.530> reeling<00:03:00.680> it'll<00:03:00.919> just<00:03:01.069> pull

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
when you start reeling it'll just pull

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.680 
when you start reeling it'll just pull
right<00:03:01.459> back<00:03:01.519> into<00:03:01.880> the<00:03:02.090> top<00:03:02.299> of<00:03:02.450> their<00:03:02.540> mouth

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
right back into the top of their mouth

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.140 
right back into the top of their mouth
so<00:03:03.010> this<00:03:04.010> is<00:03:04.099> a<00:03:04.190> very<00:03:04.430> good<00:03:04.639> choice<00:03:04.849> to<00:03:05.030> get

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
so this is a very good choice to get

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.360 
so this is a very good choice to get
usually<00:03:05.630> I<00:03:05.660> use<00:03:05.780> the<00:03:06.079> white<00:03:06.260> color<00:03:06.590> but<00:03:06.859> the

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
usually I use the white color but the

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.569 
usually I use the white color but the
yellow<00:03:07.519> works<00:03:07.760> we<00:03:07.940> want<00:03:08.150> to<00:03:08.269> and<00:03:08.750> then<00:03:09.579> another

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:10.579 
yellow works we want to and then another

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:14.949 
yellow works we want to and then another
good<00:03:10.849> swap<00:03:11.180> lure<00:03:11.450> in<00:03:11.780> here<00:03:12.470> is<00:03:12.650> really<00:03:13.130> is<00:03:13.959> the

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
good swap lure in here is really is the

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.170 
good swap lure in here is really is the
zara<00:03:15.230> spook<00:03:15.530> I<00:03:15.829> think<00:03:16.459> this<00:03:16.549> is<00:03:16.639> a<00:03:16.669> five-inch

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
zara spook I think this is a five-inch

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.440 
zara spook I think this is a five-inch
it's<00:03:17.540> a<00:03:17.630> pretty<00:03:17.780> big<00:03:17.989> lure<00:03:18.230> but<00:03:18.849> you<00:03:19.849> usually

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
it's a pretty big lure but you usually

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.420 
it's a pretty big lure but you usually
just<00:03:20.810> twitch<00:03:21.109> it's<00:03:21.650> kind<00:03:21.859> of<00:03:21.889> hard<00:03:22.099> to<00:03:22.220> start

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
just twitch it's kind of hard to start

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.250 
just twitch it's kind of hard to start
off<00:03:22.549> with<00:03:22.730> but<00:03:23.030> you<00:03:23.450> twitch<00:03:23.750> it<00:03:23.930> and<00:03:24.049> it<00:03:24.139> goes

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
off with but you twitch it and it goes

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.170 
off with but you twitch it and it goes
that<00:03:24.410> way<00:03:24.620> slowly<00:03:25.099> retrieves<00:03:25.639> me<00:03:25.819> twitching

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
that way slowly retrieves me twitching

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.000 
that way slowly retrieves me twitching
it<00:03:26.299> goes<00:03:26.450> that<00:03:26.660> way<00:03:26.840> it<00:03:27.530> takes<00:03:27.739> a<00:03:27.829> lot<00:03:27.980> of

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
it goes that way it takes a lot of

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.309 
it goes that way it takes a lot of
mastery<00:03:28.459> but<00:03:28.669> the<00:03:29.450> white<00:03:29.630> color<00:03:29.930> is<00:03:30.109> usually

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:30.319 
mastery but the white color is usually

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:36.860 
mastery but the white color is usually
the<00:03:30.530> best<00:03:30.709> I'd<00:03:30.950> say<00:03:32.230> then

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.140 

think<00:03:37.870> that<00:03:38.080> might<00:03:38.440> be<00:03:38.470> all<00:03:38.920> I<00:03:39.250> think<00:03:39.700> I<00:03:39.880> have

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
think that might be all I think I have

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:46.020 
think that might be all I think I have
one<00:03:40.570> more<00:03:42.540> yesterday<00:03:43.590> okay<00:03:44.760> here's<00:03:45.760> some

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
one more yesterday okay here's some

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.910 
one more yesterday okay here's some
other<00:03:46.180> soft<00:03:46.450> plastics<00:03:49.170> then<00:03:50.170> what<00:03:50.650> I'll<00:03:50.770> use

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
other soft plastics then what I'll use

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.650 
other soft plastics then what I'll use
for<00:03:51.340> a<00:03:51.370> lot<00:03:51.580> of<00:03:51.730> them<00:03:51.940> this<00:03:52.360> is<00:03:54.180> like<00:03:55.180> a<00:03:55.210> green

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660 
for a lot of them this is like a green

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.590 
for a lot of them this is like a green
pumpkin<00:03:55.990> with<00:03:56.590> sparkles<00:03:57.340> in<00:03:57.490> it<00:03:57.580> I<00:03:57.790> think<00:03:58.300> it's

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
pumpkin with sparkles in it I think it's

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.660 
pumpkin with sparkles in it I think it's
called<00:03:58.750> magic<00:03:58.990> green<00:03:59.350> pumpkin<00:03:59.560> this<00:04:00.460> is<00:04:00.640> a
