 imagine life without him 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:44.230
 unfortunately it is a 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.910
 non-renewable resource every time we have 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.549
 what to look for the deposits in places 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:51.430

 percent of the national demand in addition to 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.160
 export crude to the rest of the world the 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:10.840
 Oil production is measured in barrels 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.950
 a unit of measurement of volume 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:16.980
 equivalent to 158.9 liters that is to say almost

 8 water jugs 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.090
 contrary to what is believed a barrel does not 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.190
 it's a tambo or the tankers go 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.530
 loaded with these the barrel is just one
