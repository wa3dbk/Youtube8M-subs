00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 released the gentleman in the list of 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.580
 the Pan-American soccer games 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.410
 men's soccer where they do not appear 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.740
 players of chivas carlos fierro raúl 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.120
 lópez acevedo salcedo who were not 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.700
 borrowed by the club because you have to 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.170
 remember that obviously not 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.750
 would prevent being in the first days 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.470
 of the start of the mx league is like in the 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.269
 good guadarrama field home not the 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.519
 called cárdenas and manuel a hood los 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.000
 archers that will be present in this 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.859
 tournament 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.140
 abella del santos edgardo marín de las 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.640
 chivas guzmán from tijuana jordan silva y 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.100
 toluca goes to the ranking of puma luís lópez 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.410
 de monterrey and osvaldo luna de los 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.660
 tigers on the defensive issue let's go 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.629
 the positions of fly attack 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.520
 front kevin flaky sperm 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:47.700
 daniel hernandez tamay cisneros unida 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.730
 daniel álvarez angel saldivar and frame 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.890
 well there is that also go read then 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.370
 Meet the Mexican Olympic Committee 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.350
 that ends up giving the whole list of 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.030
 the Mexican delegation and what good is there 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.000
 neither is it broom nor is the 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.729
 subject of the cube and the three are not 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.690
 reinforcements that could have grabbed this 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.340
 selection 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:12.120
 I do not know how much we can press him 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.160
 with this gold medal squad that is 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.800
 if I had arrived with the equipment that 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.540
 I was waiting with the fort with these five 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.210
 low we have spoken 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.280
 maybe I would have the requirement of today I think 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.680
 that the rung of the gold medal for 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.490
 this selection would have to be downloaded 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:32.610
 As for the obligation for me, it is not 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:36.440
 justification is I say in the understanding of 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.240
 that in 2011 was a situation 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.800
 it alternates because the games 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.990
 Pan-American Games will be in our country 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.640
 that I remember read no selection 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.400
 Pan-American man came with three 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:51.380
 reinforcements mexico was why it swept the 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:54.890
 Mexican team in Pan-American Games 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:58.370
 short salcedo is a strong low cube 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:02.470
 it is a strong low it is a low 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:04.730
 ports we return to the subject 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.250
 of hector gonzález and raúl what 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:09.800
 I remember that because I did not manage 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.780
 because the Aragonese of the teams have 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.570
 trumpeted the owners 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.400
 the selection you think they go rankin with 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:18.020
 the cougar team does not need it 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.470
 also put them, of course, what 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:23.270
 you need but you're not staying with a 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.220
 side here it seems to me that the 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.950
 Guadalajara is the one who is wrong if 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.120
 well it's true it's not an official tournament 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.010
 I also think that he is the Nestor of the 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.170
 tower led from the tower know what it is 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.820
 be on the bench of selections the 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.860
 problematic that of o magallán I think that 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.930
 the beings we agree that there is no 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.520
 names there are no kids who already like in 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.680
 that generation of Pan-Americans 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:45.020
 where output 2 is presented 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.790
 selection could cap I had to debut 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:50.030
 in the america irán mir already played with 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:52.160
 monterrey marked fabián herrera she already 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.770
 I was about to go to Europe 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.440
 the pocho ponce that is to say the reinforcements 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:59.780
 contribute but it was not so much not what 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.940
 they finally did because you remember 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.510
 that for eight and crown in the 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.510
 Pan American 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.500
 rodríguez 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:16.430
 of reinforcement until bullet to oribe and oribe 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:21.109
 peralta well 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:24.409
 but selection is not good you say is 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:26.420
 an experience that does not even 

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:30.409
 obviously poncho gonzález neither what 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:32.030
 lent for the Pan why 

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:33.829
 people are annoying not because 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.629
 we consider hope a failure 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:37.790
 of toulon that we also insist on the 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:40.219
 subject is a sub-20 tournament mexico was with 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.349
 a sub-22 selection with players from 

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:44.420
 older and who surely had more 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:46.579
 blank and said the people is that they are not 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:49.239
 five six seven headlines that are going 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:51.439
 the Pan-Americans because not completely 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:53.450
 wrong that information not because the 

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:55.879
 equipment not being a fifa date malaya 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.319
 I read not obligated or not 

00:03:55.879 --> 00:04:00.109
 forced to lend to footballers 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:01.579
 I insist the topic of Mexico was because 

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:02.810
 you had to win the gold medal 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:05.299
 being the Pan-American in Guadalajara 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:07.489
 there was no other option and it was a management 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:10.129
 who made the direction of selections 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:12.859
 national but let's be clear too 

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:15.319
 as media and as many fans 

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:17.349
 we expected this achievement 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:19.459
 that had been achieved in the last cycle 

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:20.810
 that she had not achieved the 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:22.849
 Central Americans hoped that the 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.180
 Pan-American Games and the Olympic Games that 

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:25.009
 are 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.870
 an obligation seems to me for this 

00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:29.360
 process today the theme the games 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:32.720
 Pan American Games has to be left in doubt and 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:35.720
 It seems to me that it is not valid to demand 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:38.180
 Pony gutiérrez gold medal more if 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:41.720
 demand a very good participation that 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:43.610
 could become fourth semifinal and 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.199
 Even being able to reach the final will be 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.120
 extraordinary but it is no longer the 

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:49.130
 obligation to bring the medal where 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.350
 I see that the problem is that 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:52.639
 raúl gutiérrez has not wanted to give 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:54.320
 account together with the address of 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:55.610
 national teams that is 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:58.910
 generation of soccer players 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:01.099
 honestly does not have the capacity nor 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:02.750
 even leave you the gold medal ni 

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:04.880
 even I believe in the Pan-American 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:07.099
 much less in the Olympians to compete 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:09.380
 for a medal how much work cost them 

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:11.990
 win the gold in the Central Americans of 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:13.580
 miracle they let us out a goal by raúl 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:14.990
 Lopez at the last minute what 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:18.830
 ends I understand today is not going to have to 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:20.690
 raúl lópez if he's not right, he's there already 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:23.599
 a clear armor for raúl gutiérrez 

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:26.000
 no one can claim you in case 

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:30.230
 do not win the gold medal 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:33.590
 there are forms and you will have and you will have every reason 

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:36.680
 so the guy comes out and complains and he 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:39.020
 justifies or a possible failure in that it does not 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:41.180
 counted on the players with the base of the 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:42.920
 team will be absolutely right so it's very 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:46.160
 complicated that you can work and say 

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:48.350
 I have world champion with these 

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:50.870
 tools that are giving you to go 

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:52.730
 to canada it 's very complicated I'm you 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:54.590
 honest to me I continue to impact other 

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:56.750
 Once Héctor González has not had 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:59.300
 the ability to negotiate at least 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:00.710
 those from chivas to poncho gonzález how many 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:04.100
 days were going to be out of the league 

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:06.080
 mx brings a name when the boot 

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:08.870
 alternate tournament start around 25 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:11.150
 July 26 Americans begin 7 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:13.940
 of July the first round for whatever 

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:16.660
 of 7 as anime 12 two days so 

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:16.660
 less clear
