00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:08.700
 [Music] 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.700
 [Applause] 

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:12.580
 after so many leaks and 

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:14.259
 officially presented the new 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.539
 flagship google and motorola 

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:18.279
 nexus 6 full of news and 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:19.989
 benefits that were from terminal a 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:21.640
 great premium fablet 

00:00:19.989 --> 00:00:24.790
 let's start with its screen with a size 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:29.369
 and 596 inches at a resolution of 2560 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:33.430
 x 1440 pixels with full hd technology 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:35.530
 amoled to 493 pp and so we will give a 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.910
 greater hue of colors in this case 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.980
 the screen is used much more 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.560
 glued frames a bed plus much more 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.660
 space not as it was in its predecessor 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.850
 the nexus 5 the format of this screen 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.370
 is sixteen ninths and has 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.739
 gorilla glass 3 as for the engine 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:54.220
 main we find a chipset 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:57.309
 qualcomm snapdragon 805 to four cores 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:59.980
 450 credit running a speed of 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:03.280
 27 gigahertz team accompanied by a 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:05.439
 great adreno 420 graphic engine and all that 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.780
 accompanied by 3 gigas of ram for a 

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:09.310
 much more than optimal performance in 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.369
 As for its physical aspect we find 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:15.340
 a size of 82 with 28 millimeters per 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:17.380
 159 mm by 10 06 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.000
 very similar to the two terminals of 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.009
 motorola as the new engine of the motorbike 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.950
 that a pretty premium finish 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:27.069
 nice with a weight of 184 grams and 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.810
 available in dark blue and white fits 

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:31.450
 highlight your biggest novelty running 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.610
 Android 5.0 lipo the name of the new 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.709
 Android version characterized by its 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.630
 aspect material design optimization and 

00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:39.340
 speed to those known as android 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.229
 you are in terms of the photographic aspect 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.929
 we found a rear camera of 3 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:45.729
 megapixels with optical stabilizer 

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:48.579
 Ring flash image and dual led 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:50.530
 rather improved its predecessor and the range 

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:52.810
 nexus this camera has a 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.420
 opening 2.0 with what we will have 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.670
 much more lighting in the photographs 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.979
 with capacity to record in 4 cam to 30 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.890
 frames per second your front camera 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:04.599
 it's still 2 megapixels something that 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.159
 remains discontent for many 

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:07.209
 users 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.560
 another improved aspect is the audio 

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:10.959
 we have two powerful speakers 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.209
 front panels with better audio quality 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:14.890
 in terms of connectivity will continue 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:18.030
 supporting the 4g high speed network 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:20.980
 lte youtube 4.1 and nfc 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.120
 another novel feature is the mode 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.640
 Turbo 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.310
 A longer usage time of up to 7 hours 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.870
 with 15 minutes of loading thing that will have 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.159
 to be seen also in reality in 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.099
 As for your internal storage 

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:35.200
 we found 32 gigs and this model of 64 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:37.360
 gb one of the most important aspects 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.150
 that the nexus range has never been worried 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.849
 and this time it is the size of the battery 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.920
 in this case we have 3200 media 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:46.750
 with a fairly high level to have 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.690
 greater autonomy and to conclude 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:52.780
 we have two wrecks 649 euros for the 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:55.030
 32gb model and 699 euros for the 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.709
 64 gigs model that can be reserved 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.019
 in the google play later this month 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:59.470
 in company in stores in the middle of 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:01.750
 November 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.459
 good this price because it will be possible to walk around 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.890
 more or less you from Mexico 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:07.780
 latin america make the transfer of euros 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.310
 to your local currency good as far as 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.470
 conclusions I consider to be a great 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.090
 terminal in terms of size also what 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.950
 particular I love I love the 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.659
 big phones the screen also I 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.430
 I really like that it has changed to mole of 

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:20.890
 that there are many applications with which 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.870
 we can save battery also that 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.370
 we have a bigger matter the truth 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.099
 it's a phone that's pretty good 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:29.020
 which I think it hits us in that 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:31.690
 tropez and all of us users 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:33.610
 at a rather high price which in 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.670
 those five came out with four hundred euros 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:39.850
 that it was worth in this case to leave 32 gigas 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:42.340
 that same of the 649 euros thing that 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:44.350
 it's quite high but we're going to 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.230
 think one thing many times they have 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.910
 spent on the iphone 6 for example that 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.610
 it's a lot more good money this 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.440
 ends the one that is worth 500 or 600 700 euros 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.750
 why not spend them on this piece of 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.100
 terminal that is a nexus much more 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.560
 improved that we see that also that is 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:01.630
 pretty good this price with which 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.550
 then whoever thinks of spending a 700 train 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:06.430
 terminal euro is not at all high 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:07.600
 but for us then another one if I 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.890
 I see pretty well in terms of 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.900
 storage is also quite 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.250
 well Android when it was true 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.320
 in the movie probably in their 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.940
 five I liked a lot so good yo 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:18.489
 I think it's a terminal that goes 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.650
 a lot in the size and it's going to be very good and 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:22.570
 competent then the other brands that in 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.190
 the market also the camera have 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.230
 improved many things have been achieved 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:29.530
 they are going to see you go inside and we have 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:31.990
 a much more powerful CPU a phone 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:33.370
 which is pretty much improved in 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.590
 as to the screen as I commented 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:37.480
 I really like pixels 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:40.330
 Actually I do not care but hey we 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:42.070
 make it a quality terminal so 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.020
 Well, I leave you with the question of what 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:45.940
 you think this long awaited in its six 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.860
 of our comments to be able to see 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.600
 well that it appeared to you from you and 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.680
 talk about this new terminal like this 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.720
 I hope you liked it 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:55.530
 this video we will see in another next 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.530
 video expte
