00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
your gun know that you're going to need

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.310 
your gun know that you're going to need
a<00:00:34.110> nine<00:00:34.440> point<00:00:34.649> six<00:00:34.920> volt<00:00:35.250> or<00:00:35.910> not<00:00:36.600> a<00:00:36.630> 9.6<00:00:37.260> volt

a nine point six volt or not a 9.6 volt
a<00:00:37.680> nunchuck<00:00:38.399> style<00:00:38.790> battery<00:00:39.270> I<00:00:39.480> recommend<00:00:40.290> a

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
a nunchuck style battery I recommend a

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.900 
a nunchuck style battery I recommend a
nine<00:00:40.469> six<00:00:40.739> gives<00:00:41.010> a<00:00:41.100> gun<00:00:41.250> a<00:00:41.280> great<00:00:41.579> rate<00:00:41.790> of

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
nine six gives a gun a great rate of

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.790 
nine six gives a gun a great rate of
fire<00:00:42.090> will<00:00:42.540> destroy<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.230> internals<00:00:43.649> like<00:00:43.770> a

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
fire will destroy the internals like a

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.660 
fire will destroy the internals like a
lipo<00:00:44.250> but<00:00:45.710> nunchuck<00:00:46.710> batteries<00:00:47.160> you<00:00:47.460> need

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
lipo but nunchuck batteries you need

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.119 
lipo but nunchuck batteries you need
them<00:00:47.910> you<00:00:48.210> can't<00:00:48.629> fit<00:00:48.989> any<00:00:49.500> other<00:00:49.680> battery<00:00:50.070> in

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
them you can't fit any other battery in

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.170 
them you can't fit any other battery in
here<00:00:50.280> you<00:00:50.370> might<00:00:50.520> get<00:00:50.670> away<00:00:50.760> with<00:00:51.030> some

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
here you might get away with some

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.930 
here you might get away with some
weird-ass<00:00:51.570> shaped<00:00:51.870> lipo<00:00:52.640> that's<00:00:53.640> if<00:00:53.789> you're

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
weird-ass shaped lipo that's if you're

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:54.439 
weird-ass shaped lipo that's if you're
lucky

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
lucky

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.600 
lucky
but<00:00:54.840> let's<00:00:55.559> get<00:00:55.710> onto<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:56.070> actual<00:00:56.430> tutorial

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
but let's get onto the actual tutorial

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.090 
but let's get onto the actual tutorial
here<00:00:57.239> now<00:00:58.199> that<00:00:58.350> you<00:00:58.410> got<00:00:58.530> your<00:00:58.590> nine<00:00:58.829> sticks

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
here now that you got your nine sticks

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.900 
here now that you got your nine sticks
you<00:00:59.280> got<00:00:59.399> your<00:00:59.550> gun<00:00:59.989> simply<00:01:01.520> pull<00:01:02.520> down<00:01:02.550> on<00:01:02.820> the

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
you got your gun simply pull down on the

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.170 
you got your gun simply pull down on the
adjustment<00:01:03.300> lever<00:01:03.570> and<00:01:04.640> your<00:01:05.640> crane<00:01:05.880> stock

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
adjustment lever and your crane stock

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.350 
adjustment lever and your crane stock
will<00:01:06.479> slide<00:01:06.780> right<00:01:07.290> off<00:01:07.820> so<00:01:08.820> this<00:01:09.150> is<00:01:09.240> where

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
will slide right off so this is where

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.020 
will slide right off so this is where
the<00:01:09.450> battery<00:01:09.750> is<00:01:09.810> kept<00:01:10.170> now<00:01:10.650> other<00:01:11.310> tutorials

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
the battery is kept now other tutorials

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.149 
the battery is kept now other tutorials
on<00:01:12.210> this<00:01:12.450> or<00:01:12.869> if<00:01:13.380> you<00:01:13.500> probably<00:01:13.799> get<00:01:14.010> your

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
on this or if you probably get your

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.649 
on this or if you probably get your
genie<00:01:14.640> you'll<00:01:14.909> notice<00:01:15.240> that<00:01:15.360> there's<00:01:15.600> a

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
genie you'll notice that there's a

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.740 
genie you'll notice that there's a
little<00:01:15.840> kind<00:01:16.259> of<00:01:16.409> a<00:01:16.650> battery<00:01:17.310> a<00:01:17.750> battery

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
little kind of a battery a battery

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.530 
little kind of a battery a battery
holder<00:01:19.409> in<00:01:19.619> there<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.100> what<00:01:20.790> it<00:01:20.880> does<00:01:21.060> is<00:01:21.390> it

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
holder in there and what it does is it

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.060 
holder in there and what it does is it
allows<00:01:21.570> this<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.500> be<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.650> little<00:01:22.860> more

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
allows this to be a little more

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.609 
allows this to be a little more
organized<00:01:23.610> I<00:01:23.909> don't<00:01:24.750> recommend<00:01:25.020> using<00:01:25.320> that

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
organized I don't recommend using that

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.620 
organized I don't recommend using that
because<00:01:25.770> when<00:01:26.490> you<00:01:26.610> use<00:01:26.820> it<00:01:27.000> in<00:01:27.090> here<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.509> way

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
because when you use it in here the way

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.140 
because when you use it in here the way
I'm<00:01:27.750> teaching<00:01:27.900> you<00:01:28.759> the<00:01:29.759> way<00:01:29.850> I'm<00:01:29.970> teaching

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
I'm teaching you the way I'm teaching

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.580 
I'm teaching you the way I'm teaching
just<00:01:30.570> putting<00:01:30.840> it<00:01:30.960> like<00:01:31.200> taking<00:01:31.409> off<00:01:31.560> the

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
just putting it like taking off the

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.140 
just putting it like taking off the
crane<00:01:31.860> stock<00:01:32.130> instead<00:01:32.430> of<00:01:32.640> taking<00:01:32.939> off<00:01:33.030> the

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
crane stock instead of taking off the

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.920 
crane stock instead of taking off the
rear<00:01:33.329> butt<00:01:33.509> pad<00:01:33.689> which<00:01:33.869> is<00:01:33.990> really<00:01:34.259> hard<00:01:35.930> you

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
rear butt pad which is really hard you

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.390 
rear butt pad which is really hard you
could<00:01:37.110> you<00:01:37.259> just<00:01:37.290> take<00:01:37.530> off<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.710> stock<00:01:38.009> itself

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
could you just take off the stock itself

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.770 
could you just take off the stock itself
and<00:01:38.729> then<00:01:38.820> you<00:01:38.880> can<00:01:39.000> slide<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.299> battery<00:01:39.479> in

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
and then you can slide the battery in

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.390 
and then you can slide the battery in
but<00:01:40.229> if<00:01:40.320> you<00:01:40.409> use<00:01:40.530> that<00:01:40.650> little<00:01:40.890> holder<00:01:41.250> that

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
but if you use that little holder that

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.639 
but if you use that little holder that
comes<00:01:41.579> with<00:01:41.790> it<00:01:41.880> it's<00:01:42.060> gonna<00:01:42.600> be<00:01:42.689> really<00:01:43.259> tough

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
comes with it it's gonna be really tough

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.819 
comes with it it's gonna be really tough
to<00:01:43.850> retract<00:01:44.850> all<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:46.079> way<00:01:46.229> so<00:01:46.290> it<00:01:46.649> won't

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
to retract all the way so it won't

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.139 
to retract all the way so it won't
really<00:01:46.979> be<00:01:47.070> up<00:01:47.280> to<00:01:47.399> here<00:01:47.549> it'll<00:01:47.790> be<00:01:47.850> up<00:01:48.030> to

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
really be up to here it'll be up to

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.700 
really be up to here it'll be up to
there<00:01:48.360> I<00:01:48.720> don't<00:01:49.049> recommend<00:01:49.350> using<00:01:49.590> that

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
there I don't recommend using that

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.569 
there I don't recommend using that
because<00:01:50.159> you<00:01:50.850> know<00:01:50.970> I<00:01:51.240> like<00:01:52.020> having<00:01:52.649> it<00:01:52.979> having

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
because you know I like having it having

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.249 
because you know I like having it having
the<00:01:53.670> option<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.119> go<00:01:54.329> wherever<00:01:54.509> I<00:01:54.689> want<00:01:54.960> but

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
the option to go wherever I want but

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.929 
the option to go wherever I want but
that's<00:01:55.380> just<00:01:55.590> me<00:01:55.770> if<00:01:55.979> you<00:01:56.130> don't<00:01:56.280> really<00:01:56.399> need

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
that's just me if you don't really need

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.969 
that's just me if you don't really need
that<00:01:57.149> then<00:01:57.299> go<00:01:57.450> ahead<00:01:57.540> and<00:01:57.630> use<00:01:57.719> a<00:01:57.810> holder<00:01:58.200> but

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
that then go ahead and use a holder but

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.760 
that then go ahead and use a holder but
yeah<00:01:59.360> in<00:02:00.360> this<00:02:00.899> video<00:02:01.170> I'm<00:02:01.290> not<00:02:01.350> gonna<00:02:01.680> be

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
yeah in this video I'm not gonna be

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.160 
yeah in this video I'm not gonna be
using<00:02:01.920> it<00:02:02.159> so<00:02:02.729> simply<00:02:03.210> take<00:02:03.509> off<00:02:03.719> these<00:02:03.899> two

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
using it so simply take off these two

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.530 
using it so simply take off these two
little<00:02:04.979> tabs<00:02:05.159> one<00:02:05.549> is<00:02:05.670> clockwise<00:02:06.090> and<00:02:06.329> one<00:02:06.420> is

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
little tabs one is clockwise and one is

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.570 
little tabs one is clockwise and one is
counterclockwise<00:02:07.190> and<00:02:08.190> now<00:02:08.280> that<00:02:08.429> you've

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
counterclockwise and now that you've

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.889 
counterclockwise and now that you've
done<00:02:08.729> that<00:02:08.789> you<00:02:09.599> can<00:02:09.660> install<00:02:10.050> your<00:02:10.110> battery

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
done that you can install your battery

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.759 
done that you can install your battery
simply<00:02:11.620> take<00:02:11.829> two<00:02:12.069> so<00:02:12.310> take<00:02:12.879> the<00:02:13.000> two<00:02:13.150> cells

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
simply take two so take the two cells

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:18.300 
simply take two so take the two cells
place<00:02:14.769> them<00:02:15.040> on<00:02:15.280> both<00:02:16.349> sides<00:02:17.349> of<00:02:17.829> the<00:02:17.980> little

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
place them on both sides of the little

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.429 
place them on both sides of the little
crane<00:02:19.060> stocks<00:02:19.420> as<00:02:19.689> you<00:02:19.840> can<00:02:19.989> see<00:02:20.140> I'm<00:02:20.260> doing

00:02:20.429 --> 00:02:20.439 
crane stocks as you can see I'm doing

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:22.860 
crane stocks as you can see I'm doing
here<00:02:20.790> you<00:02:21.790> can<00:02:22.030> see<00:02:22.180> that<00:02:22.299> you<00:02:22.390> just<00:02:22.450> slide

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
here you can see that you just slide

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:23.640 
here you can see that you just slide
right<00:02:22.900> in

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
right in

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.059 
right in
okay<00:02:24.159> now<00:02:24.400> that<00:02:24.549> this<00:02:25.019> in<00:02:26.019> the<00:02:26.620> crane<00:02:26.799> stock

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
okay now that this in the crane stock

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:27.569 
okay now that this in the crane stock
itself

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:27.579 
itself

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:33.059 
itself
take<00:02:28.269> your<00:02:28.650> Mia<00:02:29.650> connector<00:02:30.099> and<00:02:30.540> your<00:02:32.069> battery

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069 
take your Mia connector and your battery

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:37.860 
take your Mia connector and your battery
to<00:02:33.280> me<00:02:33.400> a<00:02:33.430> connector<00:02:33.909> and<00:02:34.769> connect<00:02:35.769> them<00:02:36.870> there

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
to me a connector and connect them there

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:38.399 
to me a connector and connect them there
we<00:02:37.959> go

00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:38.409 
we go

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:40.170 
we go
now<00:02:38.890> that<00:02:39.040> they're<00:02:39.189> connected<00:02:39.579> push<00:02:39.879> the<00:02:40.030> two

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
now that they're connected push the two

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.899 
now that they're connected push the two
cells<00:02:40.420> back<00:02:40.629> in<00:02:40.840> and<00:02:41.220> put<00:02:42.220> the<00:02:42.250> tabs<00:02:42.519> and<00:02:42.730> the

00:02:42.899 --> 00:02:42.909 
cells back in and put the tabs and the

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:44.729 
cells back in and put the tabs and the
tabs<00:02:43.120> work<00:02:43.420> really<00:02:43.629> well<00:02:43.870> of<00:02:44.200> folding<00:02:44.620> your

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
tabs work really well of folding your

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:46.559 
tabs work really well of folding your
battery<00:02:45.069> and<00:02:45.220> first<00:02:45.849> I<00:02:45.970> didn't<00:02:46.150> think<00:02:46.239> they<00:02:46.359> do

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:46.569 
battery and first I didn't think they do

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:48.240 
battery and first I didn't think they do
they<00:02:46.959> did<00:02:47.139> anything<00:02:47.379> so<00:02:47.650> I<00:02:47.709> just<00:02:47.829> never<00:02:47.980> really

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
they did anything so I just never really

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.000 
they did anything so I just never really
put<00:02:48.430> him<00:02:48.519> in<00:02:48.639> but<00:02:48.940> I<00:02:49.500> found<00:02:50.500> out<00:02:50.709> that<00:02:50.859> when<00:02:50.980> I

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
put him in but I found out that when I

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.369 
put him in but I found out that when I
was<00:02:51.159> playing<00:02:51.340> my<00:02:51.609> cells<00:02:52.299> were<00:02:52.659> like<00:02:52.870> sliding

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:53.379 
was playing my cells were like sliding

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:54.869 
was playing my cells were like sliding
out<00:02:53.440> of<00:02:53.560> crane<00:02:53.799> stock<00:02:54.069> so<00:02:54.310> these<00:02:54.549> are<00:02:54.700> pretty

00:02:54.869 --> 00:02:54.879 
out of crane stock so these are pretty

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:58.229 
out of crane stock so these are pretty
important<00:02:55.269> actually<00:02:55.859> don't<00:02:56.859> lose<00:02:56.980> them<00:02:57.239> and

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
important actually don't lose them and

00:02:58.239 --> 00:02:59.789 
important actually don't lose them and
then<00:02:58.510> what<00:02:58.720> you<00:02:58.810> want<00:02:58.959> to<00:02:59.019> do<00:02:59.170> is<00:02:59.409> take<00:02:59.620> the

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
then what you want to do is take the

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:02.360 
then what you want to do is take the
wires<00:03:00.040> and<00:03:00.459> arrange<00:03:00.790> them<00:03:01.030> in<00:03:01.180> sort<00:03:01.450> of<00:03:01.510> an<00:03:01.629> S

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
wires and arrange them in sort of an S

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.970 
wires and arrange them in sort of an S
shape<00:03:03.370> into<00:03:04.090> the<00:03:04.180> buffer<00:03:04.450> tube<00:03:04.629> like<00:03:04.780> this<00:03:04.989> now

you don't have to risk getting pinched

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.599 
you don't have to risk getting pinched
wires<00:03:26.019> which<00:03:26.590> is<00:03:26.709> what<00:03:26.859> I<00:03:26.889> like<00:03:27.190> I<00:03:27.310> don't<00:03:27.489> like

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:27.609 
wires which is what I like I don't like

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:28.800 
wires which is what I like I don't like
picking<00:03:27.909> wires<00:03:28.090> because<00:03:28.329> I<00:03:28.480> don't<00:03:28.629> want<00:03:28.750> to

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
picking wires because I don't want to

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.890 
picking wires because I don't want to
break<00:03:28.989> my<00:03:29.019> gun<00:03:29.730> or<00:03:30.730> not<00:03:31.239> break<00:03:31.419> the<00:03:31.540> gun<00:03:31.659> looks

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
break my gun or not break the gun looks

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.420 
break my gun or not break the gun looks
like<00:03:31.989> a<00:03:32.019> battery<00:03:32.470> batteries<00:03:32.919> aren't<00:03:33.190> really

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
like a battery batteries aren't really

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.030 
like a battery batteries aren't really
um<00:03:34.060> they're<00:03:34.449> not<00:03:34.599> too<00:03:34.840> cheap<00:03:35.230> nowadays<00:03:35.470> but

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
um they're not too cheap nowadays but

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.500 
um they're not too cheap nowadays but
yeah<00:03:36.879> it<00:03:37.690> retracts<00:03:37.959> fully<00:03:38.379> so<00:03:39.370> follow<00:03:40.359> this

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
yeah it retracts fully so follow this
