other things we want to make this a

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.639 
other things we want to make this a
circuit<00:00:50.579> so<00:00:50.760> it's<00:00:50.969> kind<00:00:51.180> of<00:00:51.239> all<00:00:51.449> going<00:00:51.960> try<00:00:52.590> to

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
circuit so it's kind of all going try to

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.799 
circuit so it's kind of all going try to
not<00:00:52.920> have<00:00:53.280> much<00:00:53.670> of<00:00:53.699> a<00:00:53.910> rest<00:00:54.180> time<00:00:54.420> in<00:00:54.660> between
