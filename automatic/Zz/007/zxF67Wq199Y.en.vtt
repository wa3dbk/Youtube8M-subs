00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
but third up we can we can kind of

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.640 
but third up we can we can kind of
choose<00:03:39.300> the<00:03:39.510> ninja<00:03:39.780> perk<00:03:39.960> to<00:03:40.140> go<00:03:40.260> hand<00:03:40.500> in<00:03:40.590> hand

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
choose the ninja perk to go hand in hand

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.880 
choose the ninja perk to go hand in hand
with<00:03:40.860> that<00:03:41.160> overall<00:03:42.030> stealth<00:03:42.780> approach<00:03:43.590> that

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
with that overall stealth approach that

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.190 
with that overall stealth approach that
the<00:03:44.010> Royal<00:03:44.220> Marines<00:03:44.430> commandos<00:03:45.060> are<00:03:45.900> trained

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
the Royal Marines commandos are trained

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.770 
the Royal Marines commandos are trained
in<00:03:46.460> obviously<00:03:47.460> yeah<00:03:47.730> being<00:03:48.180> a<00:03:48.330> being<00:03:48.690> a

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
in obviously yeah being a being a

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.510 
in obviously yeah being a being a
lightweight<00:03:49.140> commando<00:03:49.740> force<00:03:50.010> the<00:03:50.250> trained

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:50.520 
lightweight commando force the trained

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.180 
lightweight commando force the trained
in<00:03:50.910> in<00:03:51.270> stealth<00:03:51.600> tactics<00:03:51.840> and<00:03:52.380> are<00:03:52.890> often

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
in in stealth tactics and are often

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.000 
in in stealth tactics and are often
deployed<00:03:53.730> to<00:03:54.000> go<00:03:54.120> deep<00:03:54.390> behind<00:03:54.720> enemy<00:03:55.200> lines

so<00:03:56.490> as<00:03:56.790> for<00:03:56.910> killstreak<00:03:57.300> rewards<00:03:57.630> we<00:03:57.720> can<00:03:57.870> kind

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.050 
so as for killstreak rewards we can kind

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.950 
so as for killstreak rewards we can kind
of<00:03:58.140> choose<00:03:58.380> kill<00:03:59.070> streaks<00:03:59.340> that<00:03:59.900> kind<00:04:00.900> of

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:00.960 
of choose kill streaks that kind of

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.510 
of choose kill streaks that kind of
relate<00:04:01.260> to<00:04:01.290> what's<00:04:01.620> used<00:04:01.860> by<00:04:02.040> the<00:04:02.100> British

in<00:04:37.779> black<00:04:38.020> ops<00:04:38.229> but<00:04:38.439> we<00:04:38.499> do<00:04:38.620> have<00:04:38.800> the<00:04:38.979> it's

00:04:39.869 --> 00:04:39.879 
in black ops but we do have the it's

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:41.219 
in black ops but we do have the it's
like<00:04:39.939> they<00:04:40.180> get<00:04:40.449> slightly<00:04:41.050> newer

00:04:53.309 --> 00:04:53.319 
commandos you can kind of replicate it

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:55.320 
commandos you can kind of replicate it
as<00:04:53.409> best<00:04:53.529> we<00:04:53.620> can<00:04:53.830> with<00:04:54.490> the<00:04:54.639> weapons<00:04:55.090> and

00:05:07.589 --> 00:05:07.599 
the damn field in Black Ops is and isn't

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:10.350 
the damn field in Black Ops is and isn't
isn't<00:05:08.020> the<00:05:08.169> best<00:05:08.349> assault<00:05:08.740> rifle<00:05:09.099> but<00:05:09.129> I<00:05:09.789> mean

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
isn't the best assault rifle but I mean

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.850 
isn't the best assault rifle but I mean
especially<00:05:10.539> with<00:05:10.840> that<00:05:11.020> Susac<00:05:11.409> scope<00:05:11.710> the

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860 
especially with that Susac scope the

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.339 
especially with that Susac scope the
ACOG<00:05:12.189> it<00:05:12.939> doesn't<00:05:13.240> make<00:05:13.360> it<00:05:13.389> a<00:05:13.750> good<00:05:13.960> weapon<00:05:14.139> at

00:05:14.339 --> 00:05:14.349 
ACOG it doesn't make it a good weapon at

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:16.350 
ACOG it doesn't make it a good weapon at
all<00:05:14.439> but<00:05:14.740> like<00:05:15.129> I<00:05:15.159> said<00:05:15.400> this<00:05:15.550> is<00:05:15.729> for<00:05:15.939> trying

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:16.360 
all but like I said this is for trying

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.420 
all but like I said this is for trying
to<00:05:16.389> replicate<00:05:16.629> and<00:05:17.139> pay<00:05:17.379> homage<00:05:17.620> to<00:05:17.830> the<00:05:18.159> Royal
