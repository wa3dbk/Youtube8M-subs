automatically<00:00:34.829> a<00:00:34.950> meter<00:00:35.190> tall<00:00:35.989> so<00:00:36.989> if<00:00:37.079> you're

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
automatically a meter tall so if you're

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
squirrel at the size of you know your

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:49.069 
squirrel at the size of you know your
average<00:00:43.800> squirrel<00:00:45.559> now<00:00:47.180> that<00:00:48.180> is<00:00:48.420> I<00:00:48.719> thought

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
average squirrel now that is I thought

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.930 
average squirrel now that is I thought
that<00:00:49.170> was<00:00:49.260> interesting<00:00:49.379> and<00:00:50.100> I<00:00:50.430> thought<00:00:50.640> I'm

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
that was interesting and I thought I'm

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.479 
that was interesting and I thought I'm
wondering<00:00:51.239> why<00:00:51.510> is<00:00:51.570> that<00:00:51.719> so<00:00:52.280> well<00:00:53.280> I<00:00:53.340> think

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
wondering why is that so well I think

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.110 
wondering why is that so well I think
there's<00:00:53.640> a<00:00:53.699> couple<00:00:53.910> of<00:00:54.120> reasons<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:55.289> first<00:00:55.649> is

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
there's a couple of reasons the first is

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.720 
there's a couple of reasons the first is
mechanics<00:00:57.590> it<00:00:58.590> makes<00:00:58.980> it<00:00:59.160> a<00:00:59.219> lot<00:00:59.370> easier<00:00:59.430> on

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
mechanics it makes it a lot easier on

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.060 
mechanics it makes it a lot easier on
the<00:00:59.850> GM<00:01:00.180> if<00:01:00.480> you<00:01:00.690> don't<00:01:00.960> have<00:01:01.230> squirrels<00:01:01.800> this

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
the GM if you don't have squirrels this

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.660 
the GM if you don't have squirrels this
big<00:01:02.420> running<00:01:03.420> around<00:01:03.719> being<00:01:04.650> very<00:01:04.949> sneaky<00:01:05.430> and

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
big running around being very sneaky and

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.580 
big running around being very sneaky and
easy<00:01:05.790> to<00:01:05.970> hide<00:01:06.210> have<00:01:06.810> to<00:01:06.990> mention<00:01:07.170> how<00:01:07.409> do<00:01:07.470> you

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
easy to hide have to mention how do you

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.399 
easy to hide have to mention how do you
justify<00:01:07.950> having<00:01:08.430> a<00:01:09.090> lot<00:01:09.570> of<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.750> powers<00:01:10.140> or

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
justify having a lot of the powers or

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.140 
justify having a lot of the powers or
hitch<00:01:10.619> points<00:01:11.070> of<00:01:11.189> your<00:01:11.580> average<00:01:11.880> player

hitch points of your average player

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.530 
hitch points of your average player
character<00:01:12.630> in<00:01:12.810> a<00:01:13.049> size<00:01:13.350> this<00:01:13.799> big<00:01:14.220> it's<00:01:14.760> you

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
character in a size this big it's you

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.320 
character in a size this big it's you
know<00:01:15.659> it<00:01:16.100> might<00:01:17.100> make<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.549> GM<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:18.060> life<00:01:18.270> a

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
know it might make the GM to life a

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.969 
know it might make the GM to life a
little<00:01:18.450> difficult<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.830> second<00:01:20.159> is<00:01:20.549> I<00:01:20.790> think

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979 
little difficult the second is I think

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:27.170 
little difficult the second is I think
more<00:01:22.979> of<00:01:23.009> a<00:01:23.310> flavor<00:01:24.240> thing<00:01:24.930> but<00:01:25.920> what<00:01:26.460> if<00:01:26.700> you

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
more of a flavor thing but what if you

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.480 
more of a flavor thing but what if you
have<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.570> have<00:01:27.720> a<00:01:27.750> specific<00:01:28.080> size<00:01:28.560> or<00:01:28.950> minimum

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
have to have a specific size or minimum

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.160 
have to have a specific size or minimum
size<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:30.450> be<00:01:30.600> able<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.990> achieve<00:01:31.250> full<00:01:32.250> sapiens

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
game when it's been around for a very

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.510 
game when it's been around for a very
long<00:01:57.750> time<00:01:57.930> I<00:01:58.140> think<00:01:58.290> it<00:01:58.590> was<00:01:58.710> introduced<00:01:59.189> in

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
long time I think it was introduced in

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.700 
long time I think it was introduced in
the<00:01:59.610> first<00:01:59.850> edition<00:02:00.000> but<00:02:00.390> i'm<00:02:00.479> not<00:02:00.600> positive

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
the first edition but i'm not positive

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.429 
the first edition but i'm not positive
someone<00:02:01.710> could<00:02:01.950> probably<00:02:02.159> tell<00:02:02.369> me<00:02:02.520> that<00:02:03.439> and

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
someone could probably tell me that and

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.160 
someone could probably tell me that and
that<00:02:04.680> is<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:05.100> lils<00:02:05.430> now<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.329> littles<00:02:06.869> are

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
that is the lils now the littles are

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.469 
that is the lils now the littles are
described<00:02:07.829> as<00:02:08.009> diminutive<00:02:08.550> humans<00:02:09.149> with

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
described as diminutive humans with

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.100 
described as diminutive humans with
wings<00:02:10.310> often<00:02:11.310> dragonfly<00:02:12.060> or<00:02:12.330> butterfly<00:02:12.840> in

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
wings often dragonfly or butterfly in

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.610 
wings often dragonfly or butterfly in
nature

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
nature

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.680 
nature
they're<00:02:14.250> about<00:02:14.489> the<00:02:14.700> size<00:02:14.879> of<00:02:15.120> an<00:02:15.239> 11<00:02:15.569> inch

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
they're about the size of an 11 inch

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.140 
they're about the size of an 11 inch
action<00:02:15.900> figure<00:02:16.379> so<00:02:16.830> a<00:02:17.069> lil<00:02:17.459> is<00:02:17.640> about<00:02:17.849> this<00:02:18.090> big

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
action figure so a lil is about this big

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.789 
action figure so a lil is about this big
your<00:02:18.629> classic<00:02:19.230> GI<00:02:19.470> Joe<00:02:19.920> sighs<00:02:20.220> and<00:02:20.659> yet<00:02:21.799> the

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:22.799 
your classic GI Joe sighs and yet the

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:24.890 
your classic GI Joe sighs and yet the
lils<00:02:23.129> have<00:02:23.640> full<00:02:24.090> intelligence<00:02:24.480> factor

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
lils have full intelligence factor

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.809 
lils have full intelligence factor
arranged<00:02:25.409> ranked<00:02:25.769> as<00:02:25.890> high<00:02:26.159> so<00:02:26.580> I'm<00:02:26.640> going<00:02:26.790> to

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
arranged ranked as high so I'm going to

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:28.640 
arranged ranked as high so I'm going to
give<00:02:26.909> them<00:02:27.000> like<00:02:27.180> a<00:02:27.209> 12<00:02:27.599> maybe<00:02:28.200> even<00:02:28.349> little

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
give them like a 12 maybe even little

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.530 
give them like a 12 maybe even little
bit<00:02:28.830> maybe<00:02:28.950> even<00:02:29.159> a<00:02:29.280> 14<00:02:29.730> intelligence<00:02:30.000> there

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
bit maybe even a 14 intelligence there

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.830 
bit maybe even a 14 intelligence there
bright<00:02:31.019> and<00:02:31.879> yet<00:02:32.879> they're<00:02:33.269> the<00:02:33.420> size<00:02:33.540> of<00:02:33.750> an

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
bright and yet they're the size of an

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.559 
bright and yet they're the size of an
action<00:02:34.140> figure<00:02:34.400> how<00:02:35.400> do<00:02:35.459> they<00:02:35.940> achieve<00:02:36.329> that

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
action figure how do they achieve that

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:38.720 
action figure how do they achieve that
so<00:02:37.440> I<00:02:37.500> started<00:02:37.739> to<00:02:37.829> ponder<00:02:38.250> it<00:02:38.310> and<00:02:38.430> the

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
so I started to ponder it and the

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.630 
so I started to ponder it and the
littles<00:02:39.329> have<00:02:39.569> the<00:02:40.440> mutation<00:02:40.650> mass<00:02:41.250> mind

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
littles have the mutation mass mind

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.970 
littles have the mutation mass mind
which<00:02:42.180> allows<00:02:42.659> them<00:02:43.019> through<00:02:43.620> physical

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
which allows them through physical

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.910 
which allows them through physical
contact<00:02:44.569> to<00:02:45.569> pool<00:02:45.900> the<00:02:46.170> mental<00:02:46.470> energy<00:02:46.799> of

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
contact to pool the mental energy of

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.490 
contact to pool the mental energy of
more<00:02:47.129> than<00:02:47.160> one<00:02:47.400> person<00:02:47.810> into<00:02:48.810> boosting<00:02:49.379> a

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
more than one person into boosting a

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.559 
more than one person into boosting a
person<00:02:49.859> on<00:02:50.099> someone<00:02:50.430> else<00:02:50.579> so<00:02:51.150> they<00:02:51.180> can<00:02:51.390> like

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
person on someone else so they can like

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:53.809 
person on someone else so they can like
literally<00:02:52.049> supercharge<00:02:53.040> the<00:02:53.190> mental

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
literally supercharge the mental

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:55.910 
literally supercharge the mental
mutation<00:02:54.269> of<00:02:54.480> another<00:02:54.780> person<00:02:55.200> by<00:02:55.620> touching

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
mutation of another person by touching

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.500 
mutation of another person by touching
them<00:02:56.160> and<00:02:56.430> channeling<00:02:56.819> energy<00:02:56.940> through<00:02:57.359> them

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
them and channeling energy through them

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.240 
them and channeling energy through them
both<00:02:57.690> their<00:02:57.900> own<00:02:57.989> energy<00:02:58.170> and<00:02:58.560> the<00:02:58.859> energy<00:02:58.980> of

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
both their own energy and the energy of

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:00.440 
both their own energy and the energy of
the<00:02:59.310> other<00:02:59.400> so<00:02:59.640> you<00:02:59.730> could<00:02:59.879> literally<00:03:00.269> have<00:03:00.420> a

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
the other so you could literally have a

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.390 
the other so you could literally have a
chain<00:03:00.750> of<00:03:00.780> people<00:03:01.290> though<00:03:01.769> i<00:03:01.799> would<00:03:02.099> probably

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
chain of people though i would probably

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.670 
chain of people though i would probably
put<00:03:02.430> a<00:03:02.579> limit<00:03:02.760> based<00:03:03.000> on<00:03:03.329> power<00:03:03.930> of<00:03:04.260> the<00:03:04.349> person

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
put a limit based on power of the person

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:10.130 
put a limit based on power of the person
with<00:03:04.799> mass<00:03:05.010> mind<00:03:05.310> um<00:03:08.090> so<00:03:09.090> that's<00:03:09.299> a<00:03:09.480> that<00:03:09.959> was<00:03:10.109> a

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
with mass mind um so that's a that was a

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.360 
with mass mind um so that's a that was a
clue<00:03:10.560> so<00:03:11.310> I'm<00:03:11.459> thinking<00:03:11.629> that<00:03:12.629> the<00:03:12.900> lils<00:03:13.500> have

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
clue so I'm thinking that the lils have

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.539 
clue so I'm thinking that the lils have
a<00:03:14.400> hive<00:03:14.760> mind<00:03:15.650> now<00:03:16.650> you<00:03:16.769> could<00:03:16.920> do<00:03:17.040> a<00:03:17.069> number<00:03:17.340> of

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
a hive mind now you could do a number of

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:19.370 
a hive mind now you could do a number of
different<00:03:17.609> ways<00:03:17.849> you<00:03:18.150> have<00:03:18.269> a<00:03:18.299> hive<00:03:18.540> mind<00:03:18.840> you

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
different ways you have a hive mind you

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.520 
different ways you have a hive mind you
could<00:03:19.560> say<00:03:19.709> that<00:03:19.739> there<00:03:20.130> is<00:03:20.310> a<00:03:21.049> source<00:03:22.049> of<00:03:22.230> that

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
could say that there is a source of that

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.610 
could say that there is a source of that
hive<00:03:22.829> mind<00:03:23.160> say<00:03:23.880> say<00:03:24.090> it's<00:03:24.239> a<00:03:24.299> tree<00:03:24.690> a<00:03:25.019> tree<00:03:25.260> is

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
hive mind say say it's a tree a tree is

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.589 
hive mind say say it's a tree a tree is
the<00:03:25.829> source<00:03:26.069> of<00:03:26.280> the<00:03:26.400> lil<00:03:26.880> hive<00:03:27.239> mind<00:03:27.510> you're

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:27.599 
the source of the lil hive mind you're

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:28.849 
the source of the lil hive mind you're
going<00:03:27.720> to<00:03:27.780> play<00:03:27.959> up<00:03:28.109> the<00:03:28.200> whole<00:03:28.380> concept<00:03:28.739> that

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:28.859 
going to play up the whole concept that

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:30.319 
going to play up the whole concept that
they<00:03:29.010> are<00:03:29.129> actually<00:03:29.250> our<00:03:29.519> Pixies<00:03:29.910> are<00:03:29.940> fairies

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329 
they are actually our Pixies are fairies

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:32.390 
they are actually our Pixies are fairies
it<00:03:30.450> from<00:03:30.660> some<00:03:31.079> variety<00:03:31.500> or<00:03:31.739> very<00:03:32.099> you<00:03:32.370> know

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
it from some variety or very you know

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.119 
it from some variety or very you know
Faye<00:03:32.940> in<00:03:33.120> nature<00:03:33.510> so<00:03:33.930> they're<00:03:34.410> all<00:03:34.560> linked<00:03:34.980> to

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:35.129 
Faye in nature so they're all linked to

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:37.580 
Faye in nature so they're all linked to
a<00:03:35.160> tree<00:03:35.579> which<00:03:35.849> is<00:03:35.879> a<00:03:36.000> mobile<00:03:36.299> and<00:03:36.540> that<00:03:37.200> is<00:03:37.410> the

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
a tree which is a mobile and that is the

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.530 
a tree which is a mobile and that is the
center<00:03:37.950> of<00:03:37.980> their<00:03:38.370> hive<00:03:38.579> mind<00:03:38.910> you<00:03:39.299> could<00:03:39.450> say

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
center of their hive mind you could say

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.150 
center of their hive mind you could say
there's<00:03:39.720> a<00:03:39.750> giant<00:03:40.109> brain<00:03:40.440> in<00:03:40.650> a<00:03:40.709> jar<00:03:40.739> or

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
there's a giant brain in a jar or

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.009 
there's a giant brain in a jar or
something<00:03:41.220> like<00:03:41.459> that<00:03:41.519> you<00:03:41.730> know<00:03:41.940> a<00:03:42.060> mushroom

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
something like that you know a mushroom

have a minimum number of lils we're
going<00:04:22.380> to<00:04:22.440> just<00:04:22.650> throw<00:04:23.010> out<00:04:23.250> will<00:04:23.430> say<00:04:23.610> that

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
going to just throw out will say that

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.149 
going to just throw out will say that
the<00:04:24.960> score<00:04:25.260> their<00:04:25.469> intelligence<00:04:25.860> cards<00:04:26.070> are

the score their intelligence cards are

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:27.320 
the score their intelligence cards are
12<00:04:26.400> so<00:04:26.669> we're<00:04:27.000> going<00:04:27.090> to

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
12 so we're going to

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.869 
12 so we're going to

00:04:41.179 --> 00:04:41.189 
um actually what do you call it doesn't

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:43.129 
um actually what do you call it doesn't
doesn't<00:04:41.370> I<00:04:41.639> can't<00:04:42.000> remember<00:04:42.060> but<00:04:42.479> it's<00:04:42.870> a<00:04:42.990> name

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:43.139 
doesn't I can't remember but it's a name

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:45.619 
doesn't I can't remember but it's a name
for<00:04:43.379> its<00:04:43.590> case<00:04:43.770> it's<00:04:44.189> online<00:04:44.389> you<00:04:45.389> say<00:04:45.509> you've

00:04:45.619 --> 00:04:45.629 
for its case it's online you say you've

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:47.659 
for its case it's online you say you've
got<00:04:45.659> at<00:04:45.780> least<00:04:45.840> 120<00:04:46.439> to<00:04:46.530> 140<00:04:47.039> Lil's<00:04:47.430> in<00:04:47.610> the

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:47.669 
got at least 120 to 140 Lil's in the

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:52.010 
got at least 120 to 140 Lil's in the
group<00:04:47.879> you<00:04:48.659> have<00:04:48.990> an<00:04:49.259> intelligence<00:04:49.830> of<00:04:50.039> 12<00:04:51.020> now

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
group you have an intelligence of 12 now

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.050 
group you have an intelligence of 12 now
this<00:04:52.439> only<00:04:52.620> works<00:04:52.949> within<00:04:53.189> a<00:04:53.340> limited<00:04:53.520> area

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
this only works within a limited area

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.149 
this only works within a limited area
say<00:04:54.419> we'll<00:04:54.599> say<00:04:54.750> a<00:04:54.780> kilometer<00:04:55.409> just<00:04:55.590> because

00:04:56.149 --> 00:04:56.159 
say we'll say a kilometer just because

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:57.770 
say we'll say a kilometer just because
it's<00:04:56.280> convenient<00:04:56.729> size<00:04:57.030> so<00:04:57.509> within<00:04:57.629> a

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
it's convenient size so within a

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.899 
it's convenient size so within a
kilometer<00:04:58.289> of<00:04:58.319> these<00:04:58.560> Lil's<00:04:58.889> group<00:04:59.460> of<00:04:59.639> lils

00:04:59.899 --> 00:04:59.909 
kilometer of these Lil's group of lils

00:04:59.909 --> 00:05:04.040 
kilometer of these Lil's group of lils
they<00:05:00.750> all<00:05:00.990> have<00:05:01.440> 12<00:05:02.430> intelligence<00:05:02.969> now<00:05:03.810> for

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
they all have 12 intelligence now for

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.890 
they all have 12 intelligence now for
every<00:05:04.520> kilometer<00:05:05.520> beyond<00:05:05.940> that<00:05:06.330> a<00:05:06.539> little

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900 
every kilometer beyond that a little

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.619 
every kilometer beyond that a little
gets<00:05:07.430> their<00:05:08.430> intelligence<00:05:09.030> drops<00:05:09.270> by<00:05:09.449> one

00:05:09.619 --> 00:05:09.629 
gets their intelligence drops by one

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:12.350 
gets their intelligence drops by one
point<00:05:09.979> you<00:05:10.979> could<00:05:11.159> also<00:05:11.340> if<00:05:11.580> you<00:05:11.669> want<00:05:12.030> to

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 
point you could also if you want to

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.089 
point you could also if you want to
limit<00:05:12.900> their<00:05:13.139> abilities<00:05:13.620> but<00:05:13.800> i<00:05:13.889> think<00:05:14.069> that

00:05:14.089 --> 00:05:14.099 
limit their abilities but i think that

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:16.219 
limit their abilities but i think that
gets<00:05:14.340> a<00:05:14.370> little<00:05:14.490> more<00:05:14.669> complex<00:05:15.210> this<00:05:16.050> is<00:05:16.169> i

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:16.229 
gets a little more complex this is i

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:17.719 
gets a little more complex this is i
think<00:05:16.379> its<00:05:16.500> thing<00:05:16.770> this<00:05:16.800> simple<00:05:17.340> this<00:05:17.490> works

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:17.729 
think its thing this simple this works

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:19.670 
think its thing this simple this works
fairly<00:05:17.969> simply<00:05:18.539> and<00:05:18.779> yet<00:05:19.289> it's<00:05:19.440> have<00:05:19.560> an

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 
fairly simply and yet it's have an

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.589 
fairly simply and yet it's have an
effective<00:05:20.069> for<00:05:20.279> an<00:05:20.370> idea<00:05:21.000> for<00:05:21.419> role-playing

00:05:21.589 --> 00:05:21.599 
effective for an idea for role-playing

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:23.659 
effective for an idea for role-playing
kind<00:05:21.990> of<00:05:22.050> concept<00:05:22.440> so<00:05:22.919> for<00:05:23.099> every<00:05:23.310> kilometer

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:23.669 
kind of concept so for every kilometer

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:25.070 
kind of concept so for every kilometer
they<00:05:23.789> get<00:05:23.909> away<00:05:24.090> say<00:05:24.270> they<00:05:24.389> get<00:05:24.509> they<00:05:24.629> they're

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.080 
they get away say they get they they're

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.170 
they get away say they get they they're
just<00:05:25.590> chasing<00:05:26.189> something<00:05:26.400> or<00:05:26.789> they're<00:05:26.879> gonna

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:39.330 
mechanism when they are essentially is

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.540 
mechanism when they are essentially is
it<00:05:39.509> same<00:05:39.750> intelligence<00:05:40.050> as<00:05:40.379> an<00:05:40.529> insect<00:05:41.069> now

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:41.550 
it same intelligence as an insect now

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:42.980 
it same intelligence as an insect now
the<00:05:41.610> one<00:05:41.819> thing<00:05:42.029> they<00:05:42.210> have<00:05:42.389> left<00:05:42.659> besides

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:42.990 
the one thing they have left besides

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.439 
the one thing they have left besides
their<00:05:43.199> powers<00:05:43.650> would<00:05:44.069> be<00:05:44.250> a<00:05:44.279> homing<00:05:44.909> instinct

00:05:45.439 --> 00:05:45.449 
their powers would be a homing instinct

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:48.140 
their powers would be a homing instinct
so<00:05:46.199> they're<00:05:46.349> going<00:05:46.440> to<00:05:46.560> be<00:05:46.620> able<00:05:46.740> to<00:05:46.949> find<00:05:47.370> the

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:48.150 
so they're going to be able to find the

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.510 
so they're going to be able to find the
group<00:05:48.479> mind<00:05:48.779> that<00:05:49.050> they're<00:05:49.229> from<00:05:49.469> or<00:05:49.680> another

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:50.520 
group mind that they're from or another

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.850 
group mind that they're from or another
little<00:05:50.969> group<00:05:51.210> mind<00:05:51.509> that<00:05:52.199> there<00:05:52.469> that<00:05:52.710> they

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:52.860 
little group mind that there that they

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:57.529 
little group mind that there that they
can<00:05:53.069> then<00:05:53.250> hook<00:05:53.759> into<00:05:54.029> and<00:05:54.830> move<00:05:55.830> towards<00:05:56.539> so

00:05:57.529 --> 00:05:57.539 
can then hook into and move towards so

00:05:57.539 --> 00:05:59.749 
can then hook into and move towards so
you<00:05:57.990> can<00:05:58.139> have<00:05:58.349> a<00:05:58.560> little<00:05:58.830> group<00:05:59.129> that<00:05:59.430> breaks

00:05:59.749 --> 00:05:59.759 
you can have a little group that breaks

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:01.159 
you can have a little group that breaks
up<00:05:59.940> for<00:06:00.150> whatever<00:06:00.389> reason<00:06:00.779> their

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:01.169 
up for whatever reason their

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:03.709 
up for whatever reason their
intelligence<00:06:01.770> goes<00:06:01.979> down<00:06:02.250> they<00:06:03.180> go<00:06:03.330> out<00:06:03.479> hook

00:06:03.709 --> 00:06:03.719 
intelligence goes down they go out hook

00:06:03.719 --> 00:06:05.149 
intelligence goes down they go out hook
up<00:06:03.870> with<00:06:03.990> other<00:06:04.139> little<00:06:04.650> groups<00:06:04.860> and<00:06:05.039> their

00:06:05.149 --> 00:06:05.159 
up with other little groups and their

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:07.159 
up with other little groups and their
intelligence<00:06:05.639> goes<00:06:05.819> back<00:06:06.000> up<00:06:06.029> or<00:06:06.479> a<00:06:06.539> little

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:07.169 
intelligence goes back up or a little

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:09.499 
intelligence goes back up or a little
group<00:06:07.349> could<00:06:07.529> have<00:06:07.770> many<00:06:08.639> members<00:06:09.180> they<00:06:09.360> can

00:06:09.499 --> 00:06:09.509 
group could have many members they can

00:06:09.509 --> 00:06:10.820 
group could have many members they can
have<00:06:09.599> three<00:06:09.779> or<00:06:09.870> four<00:06:10.110> hundred<00:06:10.199> members<00:06:10.710> so

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:10.830 
have three or four hundred members so

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:13.510 
have three or four hundred members so
you<00:06:10.919> can<00:06:11.039> have<00:06:11.219> three<00:06:11.699> or<00:06:11.879> four<00:06:12.180> different

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:13.520 
you can have three or four different

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.070 
you can have three or four different
group<00:06:14.520> lines<00:06:14.819> within<00:06:15.180> this<00:06:15.509> and<00:06:15.779> maybe<00:06:15.900> you

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:16.080 
group lines within this and maybe you

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:17.439 
group lines within this and maybe you
could<00:06:16.259> like<00:06:16.440> you<00:06:16.620> wanted<00:06:16.860> to<00:06:16.919> do<00:06:17.159> the<00:06:17.279> whole

00:06:17.439 --> 00:06:17.449 
could like you wanted to do the whole

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:19.790 
could like you wanted to do the whole
faith<00:06:18.449> thing<00:06:18.479> you<00:06:18.870> could<00:06:18.990> have<00:06:19.020> the<00:06:19.349> Unseelie

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:19.800 
faith thing you could have the Unseelie

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.649 
faith thing you could have the Unseelie
in<00:06:20.039> the<00:06:20.159> Seelie<00:06:20.400> courts<00:06:20.789> you<00:06:21.330> know<00:06:21.449> in<00:06:21.599> a

00:06:21.649 --> 00:06:21.659 
in the Seelie courts you know in a

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:23.180 
in the Seelie courts you know in a
post-apocalyptic<00:06:22.139> setting<00:06:22.770> if<00:06:22.979> you<00:06:23.069> only

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:23.190 
post-apocalyptic setting if you only

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:24.680 
post-apocalyptic setting if you only
want<00:06:23.310> to<00:06:23.430> you<00:06:23.610> know<00:06:23.699> any<00:06:23.909> like<00:06:24.120> that<00:06:24.330> concept

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:24.690 
want to you know any like that concept

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:26.180 
want to you know any like that concept
of<00:06:25.110> course<00:06:25.440> you're<00:06:25.560> going<00:06:25.680> to<00:06:25.740> change<00:06:26.039> the

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:26.190 
of course you're going to change the

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:28.010 
of course you're going to change the
names<00:06:26.370> things<00:06:26.639> like<00:06:26.759> that<00:06:26.930> like<00:06:27.930> you

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:28.020 
names things like that like you

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:30.589 
names things like that like you
understand<00:06:28.379> the<00:06:28.440> politics<00:06:28.830> of<00:06:28.979> that<00:06:29.509> so<00:06:30.509> you

00:06:30.589 --> 00:06:30.599 
understand the politics of that so you

00:06:30.599 --> 00:06:33.829 
understand the politics of that so you
can<00:06:30.719> have<00:06:30.810> multiple<00:06:31.789> hive<00:06:32.789> minds<00:06:33.150> within<00:06:33.629> the

00:06:33.829 --> 00:06:33.839 
can have multiple hive minds within the

00:06:33.839 --> 00:06:37.020 
can have multiple hive minds within the
same<00:06:34.139> lil<00:06:34.800> community

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:37.030 
same lil community

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:39.270 
same lil community
and<00:06:37.750> this<00:06:37.900> is<00:06:38.020> entirely<00:06:38.410> fluff<00:06:38.830> this<00:06:39.130> this

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:39.280 
and this is entirely fluff this this

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.040 
and this is entirely fluff this this
this<00:06:39.460> really<00:06:39.760> probably<00:06:39.940> has<00:06:40.120> no<00:06:40.360> bearing<00:06:40.780> on

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:41.050 
this really probably has no bearing on

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:44.340 
this really probably has no bearing on
the<00:06:41.370> mechanics<00:06:42.370> of<00:06:42.520> the<00:06:42.670> game<00:06:42.700> whatsoever<00:06:43.420> but

the mechanics of the game whatsoever but

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:49.050 
the mechanics of the game whatsoever but
I<00:06:45.330> like<00:06:46.330> can<00:06:46.690> internal<00:06:47.320> consistency<00:06:48.280> it's<00:06:48.850> one

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:49.060 
I like can internal consistency it's one

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:52.860 
I like can internal consistency it's one
of<00:06:49.090> my<00:06:49.740> faults<00:06:50.740> and<00:06:51.130> virtues<00:06:51.480> i'm<00:06:52.480> not<00:06:52.630> sure

of my faults and virtues i'm not sure
but<00:06:53.140> i<00:06:54.480> wanted<00:06:55.480> to<00:06:55.570> know<00:06:55.750> why<00:06:56.110> is<00:06:56.170> it<00:06:56.560> that<00:06:56.590> a

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:56.770 
but i wanted to know why is it that a

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:58.860 
but i wanted to know why is it that a
little<00:06:57.100> creature<00:06:57.340> a<00:06:57.640> little<00:06:58.150> could<00:06:58.630> have<00:06:58.780> an

little creature a little could have an

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:00.960 
little creature a little could have an
intelligence<00:06:59.350> as<00:06:59.470> high<00:06:59.620> as<00:06:59.920> an<00:07:00.250> individual

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:00.970 
intelligence as high as an individual

that<00:07:01.120> has<00:07:01.300> to<00:07:01.480> be<00:07:01.600> a<00:07:01.630> minimum<00:07:01.960> of<00:07:02.170> one<00:07:02.380> meter

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:02.650 
that has to be a minimum of one meter

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:06.060 
that has to be a minimum of one meter
tall<00:07:03.010> and<00:07:03.430> there<00:07:04.090> you<00:07:04.270> have<00:07:04.300> it<00:07:04.620> they<00:07:05.620> can<00:07:05.830> have

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:06.070 
tall and there you have it they can have

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:10.560 
tall and there you have it they can have
it<00:07:06.120> because<00:07:07.120> they<00:07:07.480> are<00:07:07.660> a<00:07:07.690> hive<00:07:08.050> mind<00:07:08.500> so<00:07:09.570> I'm
