 plugin that adds money to you 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.440

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.340
 million at a few moments on add

 dollars and you earn dollars in 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.520
 killing mavs then 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:01.079
 otherwise you can build with this 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.340
 money and you can do several 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:07.140
 things 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:09.380
 first thing it is you can you 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.049
 can buy in stores 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.220
 so here is for example here it is 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.720
 me who made them the store so I 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.420
 can not buy them myself I can 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.119
 not you show it so simply 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.770
 crazy laughing you take the chart and you 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.680
 right click on the table where 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.850
 the block with a free hand 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.280
 if you put an object it's wrong 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.680
 walk you will lose the price that has 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:36.540
 marked down I took my marks and 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:38.159
 at the bottom of the panel so here is the big 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.100
 boss is tested it's marked in the 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.200
 bar he has he bought an apple for 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.939
 two of theirs so here there are others 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.360
 ways to spend the money you earn 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:50.189
 by killing furniture there is art here 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.259
 town hall that I love you still finished so 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.700
 that he will sell everything thick 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.909
 it 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.110
 and the most important to survive 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:58.770
 obviously it's summer ranks for 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.539
 build your house 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.729
 of course georges stores for 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:04.860
 able to purchase blocks and blocks 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:09.149
 of diamonds insane joke I think that 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.830
 it will be the most expensive and so 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.349
 for a 28 there and that there are four five 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.080
 and have almost 500 of them so 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:18.690
 asks you who is practically 400 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.799
 years of demand and not for the price 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.810
 why there are four hundred an hour 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:22.590
 simply because he has not what 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.510
 is yours because it's a 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.310
 especially a big lot it's 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.880
 because it is a basement and that 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.680
 I like and I put an hour to ten 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.340
 one and that I put you a 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.860
 authorization 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:38.610
 you want to allow is a 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.720
 floor and is a little bit more if you want 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.540
 it all depends on the size of the tasks that 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:45.540
 you do so here is the test on 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.880
 alter1fo so therefore there was more there 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.739
 several 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:52.170
 several occupations there is here there is the 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:53.280
 football field there there is access 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.410
 prison so I will not show it to you 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:59.910
 otherwise it's not too much war you 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:07.079
 will see please come on so that's it 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:09.980
 so we're going to go we're going to go 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:09.980
 go to the big boss 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:16.650
 so that's the entry these reasons he has 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:18.960
 put a lot of boston he likes so 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:22.550
 this is his floor small presentation 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:24.600
 of houses but an offside 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:29.460
 and if you want that side there is a 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:32.820
 enchantment table down so I think 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:34.500
 that the workshop has yes there is also a 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.940
 plugin do not try to ask a block 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.800
 in the city so because the plugin 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.880
 you forbid it 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.170
 if you try to put a block that goes 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.910
 tell you that you can not because 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.930
 you are not mine and the only ones 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.780
 places where you can lay blocks 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.120
 or break it is places where you 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.920
 bought the land 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.660
 so that's all it was for 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.040
 present his mistakes ah yes I was going 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.180
 forget 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.980
 so for you know see unburdened 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.770
 we connect to the server while 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:01.470
 simply you go on network 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:08.640
 join a network in the network idea 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:10.890
 you type city anti night zombies 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.050
 I chose either beef and well word 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.489
 pass it's a two three so 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:16.049
 normally there is a small bug 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:17.430
 here you are already a member of this network 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.989
 so I can not it's me 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.740
 the administrator so I'm going to enter 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:27.870
 many I will make antinomy city 

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:29.610
 2 3 4 and 5 little more because otherwise the 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:32.130
 server is going to work so you have to 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.060
 have loghman hamachi and join this 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.130
 network 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.150
 so I'll put I'll put the rest 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.340
 in the description and I leave 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:42.630
 end this video with by this big 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:44.190
