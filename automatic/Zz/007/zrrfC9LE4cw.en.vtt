00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.530
 play natal sharks at the time I 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:16.530
 do one more year of school in 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.660
 south africa 

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:20.220
 at the sporting level and after I had the 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.640
 opportunity to go play a few months 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.650
 in Italy 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.760
 at the time there were a lot of players 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.520
 South African who went to Italy 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.600
 to have an experience and after to 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.160
 come back play in south africa 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:32.700
 so I tried my luck doing the 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.020
 same course as others and suddenly 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.030
 when i arrive in italy i got the 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.190
 opportunity to come to France and 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.700
 are chained now I finish the 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.700
 square in France 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.290
 if there had been nine 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.180
 and to return but after I was 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.610
 so good is so happy 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.530
 to see come to france is to start my 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.360
 career here does not calculate duty 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.250
 restore the confidence that people 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.720
 like had done and not leave in 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.150
 South Africa it was more another 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.720
 experience and I regret not at all 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.720
 my choice 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.270
 I'm very lucky to be 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.950
 selected for the France team 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.219
 it's sure it's the highest level 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:17.680
 who can hope to tend and after 

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:18.759
 I think that better memories than 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.110
 I have this is the first shield of 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:22.750
 brennus we win with stadium 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:25.450
 French in 2003 I you the chances of 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.220
 see my parents my uncle and that I 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.439
 see two families who were there to 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.119
 share this moment with me and of course 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:33.280
 we all know how important it is 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:34.659
 of brennus then to be able to 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.899
 to share with families it was 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:36.899
 wonderful 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.760
 already I played a lot of golf a little bit of 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.610
 rest a little thought and now 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:49.860
 I'm recovering a little in the bath between 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.490
 quotes to make the 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.490
 projects that I have in mind 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:59.710
 camille's book actually I got 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:02.260
 the idea about a year ago and in fact 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.790
 it's based on my background and use 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.400
 everything I've learned over the years 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.900
 years that I did my career that I 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.910
 can share that so it's not 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.440
 necessarily rugby techniques that's 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.110
 more as everything will still 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.800
 field '' and to support a little the 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.680
 young South Africans 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.270
 the basic idea is to give just 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.340
 our opportunity to young people in 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.830
 South Africa 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:28.330
 a chance to come and try their luck 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:31.030
 in quotation marks in France and that's it and 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.770
 advise them to surround them with 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.610
 to encourage 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.950
 because I know all the difficulties 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.850
 which are for foreigners who come 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.950
 fault and in europe 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.480
 I also find that the championship of 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.460
 France becomes one of the best 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.650
 world so it's very interesting that 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.209
 we can give this chance to 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.930
 people who all dream of coming from 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:48.930
 high level players 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.510
 me already once 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.760
 meeting with statements the president 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.200
 itchy sir 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.420
 I immediately saw that here there is 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.489
 no problem for the entourages of 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.650
 players and that and strata and well taken 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:07.810
 support the players they are very very 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.099
 glad I think they are looking forward to it 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.349
 was qualified this week to play 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:14.980
 their first match then also I think 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:16.450
 to find the grounds after we go 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.849
 discuss with them they are very happy 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.400
 French they are already learning some 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:23.650
 words I think that's it but it's not 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.049
 said that's part of the experience that 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.670
 who are going to have here and I am very 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:30.209
 glad that for the first time that 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.209
 works well 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.220
 we can 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.890
 good of keyboard 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.990
 r what we saw all that the president 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:42.110
 gentlemen of me I'm doing these last 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:44.420
 a few years i really hope they 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:46.100
 did not have to stay in federal 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.200
 a I think it's up to 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:50.930
 put together a great team they all 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.000
 the structures what it takes for for 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.250
 reach those seven goals 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.410
 so here I am glad that if we 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.870
 so we can help a little 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:01.490
 way with young people with because 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.870
 it's always that we always say that 

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:06.680
 it's young people who are the future of 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:08.450
 clubs and future hopes then we're going 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:12.310
 try to do together 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.310
 nevers becomes a big club
