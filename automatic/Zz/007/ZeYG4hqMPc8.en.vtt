00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
around because I have a feeling that

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.890 
around because I have a feeling that
these<00:03:10.350> were<00:03:10.530> around<00:03:10.770> when<00:03:10.980> I<00:03:11.010> was<00:03:11.310> little<00:03:11.900> or

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
these were around when I was little or

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.900 
these were around when I was little or
something<00:03:13.320> very<00:03:13.470> much<00:03:13.590> like<00:03:13.950> them<00:03:14.220> that<00:03:14.700> I<00:03:14.730> was

something very much like them that I was

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.170

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.840 
not allowed to have um and they were in
doll<00:03:18.390> houses<00:03:18.720> and<00:03:19.530> I<00:03:19.650> suspect<00:03:20.190> maybe<00:03:20.459> it<00:03:20.700> was
