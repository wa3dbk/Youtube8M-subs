00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.049
 hello very good dear subscribers 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.970
 here we are with this new video for 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.820
 the channel we change third today we leave 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.849
 set aside gta 5 to return with targets 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.130
 2 and a gray to find the room 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.260
 secret of being that way is we are in the 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.460
 map of being and the only thing that we are going to 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.930
 have to do is access a 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.880
 room that is closed here in the 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.070
 top floor and to access this 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.990
 room is very simple and to you 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.060
 I leave to your responsibility under 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.670
 our responsibility as you use 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.380
 this clip although it can give a lot of play and 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.940
 I know that you are going to take advantage of it 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.590
 so well the only thing that needs to be done 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.780
 is to get up here to this railing here 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.059
 on the stairs the one you are seeing 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.350
 just ahead we're going to go up and 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.180
 let's move forward as much as we can 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.559
 stick to the wall to place it and be 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.690
 hundred so stick to that wall that 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.489
 I have already here in front and we put the 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.899
 tactical insertion there you have it placed 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.879
 and now what we are going to do is go up 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.199
 the floor above 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.579
 this is the room to see for this 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.469
 door through this gate not 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.870
 can logically access and we 're going to 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.120
 commit suicide here hitting the people and 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.710
 we commit suicide that's suicide I'm 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.510
 very crazy and what we are going to do is 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.559
 appear here on this railing where 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.510
 we had left our insertion 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.780
 tactics let's aim there the only thing that 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.380
 we have 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.549
 is to take a little jump of nothing and pum 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.320
 we automatically teleports mos 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.420
 inside what is this room 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.130
 secret of being and is pretty 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.830
 interesting is the line that we can 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.440
 shoot outward even pull 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.300
 grenades and will affect will affect 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.700
 complete to anyone who happens to 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.710
 any enemy that happens nothing you go to 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.490
 see the demonstration now of the grenade 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.200
 because I'm going to throw a one as you see 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.790
 shooting like crazy to throw some 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.040
 people so you can see the effect that 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.830
 have people about in this room 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:44.100
 there out there and you see as a shot for 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:46.170
 that you see that the bullets with the bullets 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.289
 it hurts logically the bullets are going to make 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.750
 hurt and nothing and you see how people threw 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:54.240
 it explodes and you see the pots and everything like 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.030
 how it moves and I do not expect anything to come out 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.700
 much match to this git do it with 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.110
 moderation with moderation and nothing like 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.460
 favorites and like the video we'll see you in 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.690
 the next video a greeting a pleasure 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.470
 be with you and until the next 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.470
 goodbye 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.740
 i 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.290
