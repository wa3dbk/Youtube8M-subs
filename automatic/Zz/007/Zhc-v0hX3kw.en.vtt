00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
and with the USB it will work fine and

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.979 
and with the USB it will work fine and
it<00:03:26.680> would<00:03:26.829> work<00:03:27.129> almost<00:03:27.579> like<00:03:27.670> a<00:03:27.790> console<00:03:28.480> so

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
it would work almost like a console so

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:31.009 
it would work almost like a console so
it<00:03:29.260> basically<00:03:29.379> feels<00:03:29.829> like<00:03:30.010> a<00:03:30.099> console<00:03:30.579> just

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
it basically feels like a console just

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:33.750 
it basically feels like a console just
instead<00:03:32.019> of<00:03:32.260> getting<00:03:32.859> a<00:03:33.010> keyboard<00:03:33.489> and<00:03:33.609> mouse

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
instead of getting a keyboard and mouse

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.819 
instead of getting a keyboard and mouse
it<00:03:34.269> will<00:03:34.420> be<00:03:34.510> a<00:03:34.540> lot<00:03:34.780> easier<00:03:34.959> playing<00:03:35.620> on<00:03:35.799> a

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:35.829 
it will be a lot easier playing on a

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:38.699 
it will be a lot easier playing on a
controller<00:03:36.430> less<00:03:37.420> thing<00:03:37.629> you<00:03:37.659> do<00:03:37.870> might<00:03:38.439> want

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
controller less thing you do might want

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:40.319 
controller less thing you do might want
to<00:03:38.799> get<00:03:38.889> again<00:03:39.250> this<00:03:39.370> is<00:03:39.549> an<00:03:39.670> optional<00:03:40.269> thing

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:40.329 
to get again this is an optional thing

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:44.159 
to get again this is an optional thing
is<00:03:40.659> a<00:03:40.689> nice<00:03:41.409> pair<00:03:41.889> of<00:03:41.949> 4k<00:03:42.760> monitors<00:03:43.329> just

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:44.169 
is a nice pair of 4k monitors just

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:46.259

monitors because the game will look

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:54.000 
monitors because the game will look
amazing<00:03:51.900> now<00:03:52.900> like<00:03:53.139> I<00:03:53.230> said<00:03:53.260> in<00:03:53.590> my<00:03:53.620> previous

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
amazing now like I said in my previous

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.220 
amazing now like I said in my previous
videos<00:03:54.549> 4k<00:03:55.239> monitors<00:03:55.599> are<00:03:55.750> extremely

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
videos 4k monitors are extremely

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:57.809 
videos 4k monitors are extremely
expensive<00:03:56.379> at<00:03:56.650> this<00:03:56.769> point<00:03:57.010> and<00:03:57.159> not<00:03:57.639> a<00:03:57.669> lot<00:03:57.790> of

00:03:57.809 --> 00:03:57.819 
expensive at this point and not a lot of

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:59.339 
expensive at this point and not a lot of
people<00:03:58.090> can<00:03:58.209> afford<00:03:58.359> them<00:03:58.659> so<00:03:58.930> it's<00:03:59.049> really

00:03:59.339 --> 00:03:59.349 
people can afford them so it's really

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:02.099 
people can afford them so it's really
not<00:04:00.069> affordable<00:04:00.699> if<00:04:00.909> you're<00:04:01.090> getting<00:04:01.299> more

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:02.109 
not affordable if you're getting more

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:04.500 
not affordable if you're getting more
than<00:04:02.349> one<00:04:02.620> 4k<00:04:03.220> monitor<00:04:03.639> because<00:04:04.150> like<00:04:04.299> me<00:04:04.480> I

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
to be really expensive so last thing I

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.199 
to be really expensive so last thing I
want<00:04:11.769> to<00:04:11.829> mention<00:04:11.889> it's<00:04:12.489> pretty<00:04:12.909> much<00:04:13.060> an

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:13.209 
want to mention it's pretty much an

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:15.059 
want to mention it's pretty much an
obvious<00:04:13.599> is<00:04:13.930> definitely<00:04:14.560> make<00:04:14.680> sure<00:04:14.859> that

00:04:15.059 --> 00:04:15.069 
obvious is definitely make sure that

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:16.830 
obvious is definitely make sure that
your<00:04:15.159> personal<00:04:15.430> computer<00:04:15.639> or<00:04:16.090> laptop<00:04:16.120> and

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
your personal computer or laptop and

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.979 
your personal computer or laptop and
matches<00:04:17.680> the<00:04:17.799> specifications<00:04:18.729> that<00:04:18.989> rockstar

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
matches the specifications that rockstar

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:23.070 
matches the specifications that rockstar
and<00:04:20.229> steam<00:04:20.680> released<00:04:21.220> for<00:04:21.880> the<00:04:21.909> game<00:04:22.360> to<00:04:22.630> run

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
and steam released for the game to run

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.320 
and steam released for the game to run
normally<00:04:23.800> at<00:04:23.979> so<00:04:24.639> there's<00:04:24.820> actually<00:04:25.090> two

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
normally at so there's actually two

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.960 
normally at so there's actually two
things<00:04:25.360> there's<00:04:25.960> a<00:04:26.110> minimum<00:04:27.039> specification

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
things there's a minimum specification

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:29.610 
things there's a minimum specification
list<00:04:28.180> and<00:04:28.330> there<00:04:28.419> is<00:04:28.510> also<00:04:28.630> recommended<00:04:28.960> I

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
list and there is also recommended I

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.339 
list and there is also recommended I
definitely<00:04:30.520> you<00:04:31.389> should<00:04:31.419> definitely<00:04:31.810> look<00:04:32.169> at

00:04:32.339 --> 00:04:32.349 
definitely you should definitely look at

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:34.279 
definitely you should definitely look at
the<00:04:32.500> recommended<00:04:33.130> list<00:04:33.340> because<00:04:33.669> the<00:04:33.789> minimum

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:34.289 
the recommended list because the minimum

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:36.719 
the recommended list because the minimum
specification<00:04:35.289> list<00:04:35.500> is<00:04:35.710> really<00:04:36.039> not<00:04:36.430> going

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:36.729 
specification list is really not going

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:38.850 
specification list is really not going
to<00:04:36.880> do<00:04:37.060> it<00:04:37.210> because<00:04:37.630> your<00:04:37.900> game<00:04:38.080> will<00:04:38.289> crash<00:04:38.620> it

really not going to do it just be

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.659 
really not going to do it just be
because<00:04:52.080> it's<00:04:52.380> really<00:04:52.680> not<00:04:53.009> worth<00:04:53.070> it<00:04:53.460> and

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:53.669 
because it's really not worth it and
