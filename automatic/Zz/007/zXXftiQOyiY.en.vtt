beloved animated films from the past
what<00:00:04.859> did<00:00:04.980> you<00:00:05.100> think<00:00:05.310> when<00:00:05.490> you<00:00:05.640> were

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
what did you think when you were

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.450 
what did you think when you were
presented<00:00:06.120> the<00:00:06.180> opportunity<00:00:06.750> to<00:00:07.470> convert<00:00:08.340> it

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
presented the opportunity to convert it

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.570 
presented the opportunity to convert it
into<00:00:08.639> 3d<00:00:08.910> I<00:00:09.300> thought<00:00:10.260> you<00:00:10.679> know<00:00:10.800> two<00:00:10.860> things<00:00:11.160> we

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
into 3d I thought you know two things we

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.070 
into 3d I thought you know two things we
know<00:00:11.730> both<00:00:11.910> this<00:00:12.360> is<00:00:12.420> a<00:00:12.599> great<00:00:12.809> responsibility

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
know both this is a great responsibility

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.829 
know both this is a great responsibility
because<00:00:14.009> this<00:00:14.190> is<00:00:14.340> such<00:00:14.549> it's<00:00:15.030> such<00:00:15.150> a<00:00:15.299> classic

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
because this is such it's such a classic

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.680 
because this is such it's such a classic
and<00:00:15.960> it's<00:00:16.139> so<00:00:16.260> beloved<00:00:16.650> and<00:00:17.400> then<00:00:18.210> you<00:00:18.570> know

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
and it's so beloved and then you know

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.779 
and it's so beloved and then you know
it's<00:00:19.260> it's<00:00:19.650> what<00:00:20.010> an<00:00:20.100> opportunity<00:00:20.640> because

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
it's it's what an opportunity because

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.820 
it's it's what an opportunity because
you<00:00:21.480> know<00:00:22.109> we<00:00:22.769> kind<00:00:23.699> of<00:00:23.789> as<00:00:24.689> an<00:00:24.840> artist<00:00:25.230> we<00:00:25.439> pour

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
you know we kind of as an artist we pour

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.580 
you know we kind of as an artist we pour
ourselves<00:00:26.099> into<00:00:26.760> these<00:00:26.910> things<00:00:27.210> and

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:27.590 
ourselves into these things and

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.900 
ourselves into these things and
sometimes<00:00:28.590> there's<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.160> magic<00:00:29.460> happens<00:00:29.789> and

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
sometimes there's the magic happens and

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.220 
sometimes there's the magic happens and
it<00:00:29.970> becomes<00:00:30.210> a<00:00:30.300> classic<00:00:30.449> sometimes<00:00:31.019> not

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
it becomes a classic sometimes not

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.330 
it becomes a classic sometimes not
here's<00:00:31.500> something<00:00:31.859> that's<00:00:31.980> already<00:00:32.219> a

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
here's something that's already a

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.959 
here's something that's already a
classic<00:00:32.809> and<00:00:33.809> then<00:00:34.050> you<00:00:34.710> know<00:00:34.829> what<00:00:35.550> my<00:00:35.760> task

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
classic and then you know what my task

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.180 
classic and then you know what my task
is<00:00:36.210> is<00:00:36.390> to<00:00:36.510> make<00:00:36.690> it<00:00:36.840> three-dimensional<00:00:37.530> and

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
is is to make it three-dimensional and

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.340 
is is to make it three-dimensional and
this<00:00:38.940> if<00:00:39.180> you<00:00:39.239> look<00:00:39.300> at<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.600> cinematography

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
this if you look at the cinematography

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.560 
this if you look at the cinematography
and<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.559> artwork<00:00:40.920> that's<00:00:41.399> already<00:00:41.730> you<00:00:42.480> know

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
and the artwork that's already you know

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.959 
and the artwork that's already you know
in<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:42.899> film<00:00:43.110> it's<00:00:43.379> so<00:00:43.620> dimensional<00:00:44.219> it's<00:00:44.370> you

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
in the film it's so dimensional it's you

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.760 
in the film it's so dimensional it's you
know<00:00:45.059> that<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.870> filmmakers<00:00:46.350> had<00:00:46.530> such<00:00:46.739> a

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
know that the the filmmakers had such a

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.860 
know that the the filmmakers had such a
sense<00:00:47.039> really<00:00:47.610> such<00:00:47.940> a<00:00:47.969> sense<00:00:48.239> of<00:00:48.360> 3d<00:00:48.719> even

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
sense really such a sense of 3d even

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.930 
sense really such a sense of 3d even
when<00:00:49.110> they<00:00:49.200> were<00:00:49.289> making<00:00:49.440> this<00:00:49.710> as<00:00:50.610> you<00:00:50.910> know

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
when they were making this as you know

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.380 
when they were making this as you know
as<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.449> film<00:00:51.930> for<00:00:52.140> 2d<00:00:52.440> projection<00:00:53.100> that<00:00:53.760> it<00:00:54.090> was

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
as a film for 2d projection that it was

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.630 
as a film for 2d projection that it was
you<00:00:55.170> know<00:00:55.260> I<00:00:55.289> just<00:00:55.559> couldn't<00:00:55.680> help<00:00:55.920> but<00:00:56.340> think

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
you know I just couldn't help but think

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:57.950 
you know I just couldn't help but think
what<00:00:56.699> a<00:00:56.879> greater<00:00:57.180> you<00:00:57.390> know<00:00:57.480> what<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.690> great

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
what a greater you know what a great

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.689 
what a greater you know what a great
opportunity<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.680> you<00:00:59.039> know<00:00:59.129> to<00:00:59.190> take<00:00:59.430> this

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
opportunity to you know to take this

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.970 
opportunity to you know to take this
because<00:01:00.390> you<00:01:00.899> know<00:01:01.020> like<00:01:01.530> I<00:01:01.590> said<00:01:01.710> it<00:01:01.859> already

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
because you know like I said it already

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.590 
because you know like I said it already
had<00:01:02.280> such<00:01:02.520> depth<00:01:02.760> in<00:01:02.910> it<00:01:02.940> take<00:01:03.239> it<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.420> put

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
had such depth in it take it and put

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.119 
had such depth in it take it and put
into<00:01:03.750> into<00:01:04.350> 3d<00:01:04.650> space

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
into into 3d space

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:14.719 
into into 3d space
what<00:01:07.130> challenges<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:12.860> well<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.010> content<00:01:14.640> is

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
what challenges and well the content is

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.760 
what challenges and well the content is
you<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.030> content<00:01:15.420> itself<00:01:15.689> is<00:01:15.900> is<00:01:16.290> a<00:01:16.380> bit<00:01:16.619> of<00:01:16.710> a

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
you the content itself is is a bit of a

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.499 
you the content itself is is a bit of a
challenge<00:01:17.130> because<00:01:17.250> your<00:01:17.880> main<00:01:18.060> characters

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
challenge because your main characters

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.280 
challenge because your main characters
are<00:01:18.750> quadrupeds<00:01:19.680> which<00:01:20.640> are<00:01:21.390> inherently<00:01:21.750> you

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
are quadrupeds which are inherently you

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.260 
are quadrupeds which are inherently you
know<00:01:22.409> with<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.580> methods<00:01:23.909> we<00:01:24.000> used<00:01:24.150> to

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
know with the the methods we used to

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.690 
know with the the methods we used to
dimensionalize<00:01:24.720> it's<00:01:25.409> inherently<00:01:25.799> more

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
dimensionalize it's inherently more

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.390 
dimensionalize it's inherently more
difficult<00:01:27.210> because<00:01:27.990> if<00:01:28.829> you<00:01:29.009> think<00:01:29.130> about<00:01:29.250> a

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
difficult because if you think about a

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.230 
difficult because if you think about a

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
quadrupeds

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.600

there's layer upon layer of depth with

mains and the snouts and you're talking

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.639 
mains and the snouts and you're talking
about<00:01:41.390> you're<00:01:42.390> talking<00:01:42.420> about<00:01:42.810> a<00:01:42.990> very

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
about you're talking about a very

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.560 
about you're talking about a very
dimensional<00:01:43.979> thing<00:01:44.490> much<00:01:45.060> more<00:01:45.240> so<00:01:45.390> than<00:01:45.509> a

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
dimensional thing much more so than a

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.899 
dimensional thing much more so than a
human<00:01:45.840> character<00:01:46.229> would<00:01:46.409> be<00:01:46.439> and<00:01:46.799> so<00:01:47.280> so<00:01:47.700> that

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
human character would be and so so that

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.880 
human character would be and so so that
was<00:01:48.450> it<00:01:48.659> was<00:01:48.810> a<00:01:48.840> big<00:01:49.049> challenge<00:01:49.259> right<00:01:49.619> off<00:01:49.740> the

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
was it was a big challenge right off the

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.859 
was it was a big challenge right off the
bat<00:01:50.040> inherent<00:01:50.700> in<00:01:50.790> that<00:01:50.820> you<00:01:51.600> know<00:01:51.689> and<00:01:51.810> then

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
bat inherent in that you know and then
