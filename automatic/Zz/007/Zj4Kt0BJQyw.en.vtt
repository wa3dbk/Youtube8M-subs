00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.979 
about Kirkman's
The<00:00:54.550> Walking<00:00:54.790> Dead<00:00:55.079> was<00:00:56.079> the<00:00:56.519> very<00:00:57.989> intensely

00:00:58.979 --> 00:00:58.989 
The Walking Dead was the very intensely

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:01.560

taken<00:01:01.750> I<00:01:02.250> thought<00:01:03.250> this<00:01:03.369> would<00:01:03.549> be<00:01:03.670> a<00:01:03.699> really

00:01:04.109 --> 00:01:04.119 
taken I thought this would be a really

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:07.440 
taken I thought this would be a really
great<00:01:04.420> sort<00:01:05.049> of<00:01:05.110> adult<00:01:05.560> way<00:01:06.130> of<00:01:06.460> exploring<00:01:07.240> of

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450 
great sort of adult way of exploring of

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.080 
great sort of adult way of exploring of
getting<00:01:07.780> into<00:01:07.960> the<00:01:08.080> zombie<00:01:08.790> sandbox<00:01:09.790> and

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
getting into the zombie sandbox and

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.390 
getting into the zombie sandbox and
playing<00:01:10.420> telling<00:01:11.049> this<00:01:11.200> kind<00:01:11.470> of<00:01:11.590> story<00:01:11.890> in<00:01:12.250> a

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:12.400 
playing telling this kind of story in a

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.330 
playing telling this kind of story in a
highly<00:01:12.939> serialized<00:01:13.689> long-term<00:01:14.500> manner<00:01:14.799> which

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
highly serialized long-term manner which

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:16.980
