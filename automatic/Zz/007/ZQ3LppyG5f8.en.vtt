00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.089 

so<00:00:06.180> last<00:00:06.359> year<00:00:06.450> I<00:00:06.569> did<00:00:06.810> three<00:00:07.170> events<00:00:07.500> at<00:00:08.040> the

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
so last year I did three events at the

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:09.500 
so last year I did three events at the
world<00:00:08.250> title<00:00:08.400> so<00:00:08.700> did<00:00:08.820> the<00:00:08.910> individual

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
world title so did the individual

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.150 
world title so did the individual
pursuit<00:00:09.719> omnium<00:00:10.170> and<00:00:10.349> team<00:00:10.500> pursuit<00:00:10.769> I<00:00:10.950> think

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
pursuit omnium and team pursuit I think

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.660 
pursuit omnium and team pursuit I think
the<00:00:11.610> three<00:00:12.450> events<00:00:12.599> was<00:00:12.809> quite<00:00:13.259> a<00:00:13.530> lot<00:00:13.860> so<00:00:14.639> I

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
the three events was quite a lot so I

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.609 
the three events was quite a lot so I
think<00:00:14.790> this<00:00:15.389> year<00:00:15.630> after<00:00:15.809> the<00:00:15.900> decider<00:00:16.230> the

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
think this year after the decider the

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:17.660 
think this year after the decider the
omnium<00:00:16.949> and<00:00:17.070> the<00:00:17.130> team<00:00:17.279> pursuit<00:00:17.520> and

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
omnium and the team pursuit and

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.490 
omnium and the team pursuit and
hopefully<00:00:18.060> turn<00:00:18.420> the<00:00:18.869> silver<00:00:19.230> and<00:00:19.410> bronze

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
hopefully turn the silver and bronze

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.570 
hopefully turn the silver and bronze
medal<00:00:19.859> into<00:00:20.070> gold

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
medal into gold

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.790 
medal into gold
I<00:00:20.840> think<00:00:21.840> that<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:22.080> Olympic<00:00:22.380> Games<00:00:22.529> was

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
I think that the Olympic Games was

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.500 
I think that the Olympic Games was
really<00:00:23.279> special<00:00:23.640> I<00:00:23.699> think<00:00:23.789> just<00:00:24.029> the<00:00:24.119> size<00:00:24.330> of

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
really special I think just the size of

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.259 
really special I think just the size of
it<00:00:24.600> all<00:00:24.720> was<00:00:25.529> incredible<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.970> number<00:00:27.180> of

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
it all was incredible the number of

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.060 
it all was incredible the number of
people<00:00:27.420> that<00:00:27.810> were<00:00:27.930> there<00:00:27.960> supporting<00:00:28.500> the

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
people that were there supporting the

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.290 
people that were there supporting the
number<00:00:29.279> of<00:00:29.369> athletes<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.910> size<00:00:30.119> of<00:00:30.240> the

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
number of athletes the size of the

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:30.800 
number of athletes the size of the
village

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
village

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.560 
village
it<00:00:31.019> was<00:00:31.170> just<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.560> totally<00:00:31.949> different<00:00:32.219> world

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
it was just a totally different world
