our films in 3d because it's truly

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:00.910 
our films in 3d because it's truly
what's<00:03:59.510> in<00:03:59.900> the<00:04:00.080> computer<00:04:00.440> it's<00:04:00.590> what<00:04:00.770> we're

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:00.920 
what's in the computer it's what we're

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.330 
what's in the computer it's what we're
creating<00:04:01.100> and<00:04:02.380> until<00:04:03.380> now<00:04:03.650> we've<00:04:03.920> only<00:04:04.130> been

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
creating and until now we've only been

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.100 
creating and until now we've only been
able<00:04:04.459> to<00:04:04.640> see<00:04:05.000> our<00:04:05.240> worlds<00:04:05.720> with<00:04:05.870> one<00:04:06.080> eye

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:06.110 
able to see our worlds with one eye

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:09.460 
able to see our worlds with one eye
closed<00:04:06.650> so<00:04:07.550> it's<00:04:08.090> nice<00:04:08.390> to<00:04:08.420> finally<00:04:08.870> have<00:04:09.170> a

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
closed so it's nice to finally have a

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.350 
closed so it's nice to finally have a
truly<00:04:09.860> three-dimensional<00:04:10.610> world<00:04:10.760> so<00:04:10.970> I<00:04:11.000> love

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:11.360 
truly three-dimensional world so I love

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.390 
truly three-dimensional world so I love
creating<00:04:11.720> our<00:04:11.810> films<00:04:12.110> in<00:04:12.260> 3d<00:04:12.410> the

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
creating our films in 3d the

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:14.920 
creating our films in 3d the
relationship<00:04:13.850> between<00:04:14.000> creativity<00:04:14.600> and

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
relationship between creativity and

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:16.390 
relationship between creativity and
technology<00:04:15.170> for<00:04:15.740> you<00:04:15.830> that's<00:04:16.040> a<00:04:16.160> great

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
technology for you that's a great

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.520 
technology for you that's a great
question<00:04:16.820> okay<00:04:17.239> I<00:04:17.420> was<00:04:17.959> trained<00:04:18.290> as<00:04:18.500> a

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
question okay I was trained as a

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:20.740 
question okay I was trained as a
traditional<00:04:18.830> animator<00:04:19.820> by<00:04:20.000> great<00:04:20.270> Disney

traditional animator by great Disney
artists<00:04:21.250> but<00:04:22.250> at<00:04:22.400> the<00:04:22.550> beginnings<00:04:23.120> of

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:23.419 
artists but at the beginnings of

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:25.750 
artists but at the beginnings of
computers<00:04:24.050> making<00:04:24.500> pictures<00:04:24.770> in<00:04:25.190> there

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:25.760 
computers making pictures in there

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.410 
computers making pictures in there
early<00:04:26.180> 80s<00:04:26.390> I<00:04:26.980> got<00:04:27.980> so<00:04:28.340> excited<00:04:28.520> about<00:04:29.090> the

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:29.420 
early 80s I got so excited about the

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:31.780 
early 80s I got so excited about the
possibility<00:04:30.290> of<00:04:30.320> this<00:04:30.590> I<00:04:30.860> was<00:04:31.370> constantly

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:31.790 
possibility of this I was constantly

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:34.660 
possibility of this I was constantly
inspired<00:04:32.510> by<00:04:32.810> the<00:04:32.870> technology<00:04:33.740> but<00:04:34.250> the<00:04:34.280> tools

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:34.670 
inspired by the technology but the tools

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:36.460 
inspired by the technology but the tools
back<00:04:35.030> then<00:04:35.240> were<00:04:35.420> so<00:04:35.690> primitive

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.470 
back then were so primitive

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:39.820 
back then were so primitive
I<00:04:36.500> kept<00:04:37.810> encouraging<00:04:38.810> when<00:04:39.350> I<00:04:39.410> started

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
I kept encouraging when I started

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.310 
I kept encouraging when I started
working<00:04:39.980> with<00:04:40.370> Lucasfilm<00:04:41.030> which<00:04:41.900> became

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 
working with Lucasfilm which became

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.520 
working with Lucasfilm which became
Pixar<00:04:42.980> the<00:04:43.580> sari<00:04:44.120> the<00:04:44.330> Lucasfilm<00:04:44.750> computer

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 
Pixar the sari the Lucasfilm computer

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:50.460 
Pixar the sari the Lucasfilm computer
division<00:04:45.830> became<00:04:46.540> Pixar<00:04:47.540> 25<00:04:48.200> years<00:04:48.470> ago<00:04:48.740> I

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470 
division became Pixar 25 years ago I

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.440 
division became Pixar 25 years ago I
realized<00:04:51.470> that<00:04:51.650> kept<00:04:51.860> giving<00:04:52.070> them<00:04:52.400> ideas<00:04:52.580> to

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:53.450 
realized that kept giving them ideas to

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:56.290 
realized that kept giving them ideas to
push<00:04:53.750> the<00:04:53.960> technology<00:04:54.850> but<00:04:55.850> during<00:04:56.180> the

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
push the technology but during the

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.260 
push the technology but during the
research<00:04:57.020> and<00:04:57.200> development<00:04:57.230> to<00:04:58.070> create<00:04:59.030> the

00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.270 
research and development to create the

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:02.080 
research and development to create the
technology<00:04:59.510> I<00:05:00.310> started<00:05:01.310> seeing<00:05:01.520> things<00:05:01.790> I've

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090 
technology I started seeing things I've

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.990 
technology I started seeing things I've
never<00:05:02.480> seen<00:05:02.750> before<00:05:02.840> in<00:05:03.080> my<00:05:03.260> life<00:05:03.500> and<00:05:04.000> that

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
never seen before in my life and that

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.320 
never seen before in my life and that
gave<00:05:05.240> me<00:05:05.270> ideas<00:05:05.810> I<00:05:06.080> would<00:05:06.200> have<00:05:06.440> never<00:05:06.650> had<00:05:07.330> so

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:08.330 
gave me ideas I would have never had so

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:11.470 
gave me ideas I would have never had so
I<00:05:08.780> I<00:05:09.410> thought<00:05:09.860> of<00:05:10.040> this<00:05:10.190> phrase<00:05:10.550> that<00:05:10.970> is<00:05:11.300> the

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:11.480 
I I thought of this phrase that is the

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:13.800 
I I thought of this phrase that is the
way<00:05:11.630> Pixar<00:05:12.170> works<00:05:12.440> is<00:05:12.740> that<00:05:13.340> the<00:05:13.430> art

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:13.810 
way Pixar works is that the art

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:17.410 
way Pixar works is that the art
challenges<00:05:14.810> technology<00:05:15.650> and<00:05:16.420> technology

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:17.420 
challenges technology and technology

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:21.790 
challenges technology and technology
inspires<00:05:18.170> the<00:05:18.650> art<00:05:19.000> it's<00:05:20.000> this<00:05:20.360> kind<00:05:21.290> of<00:05:21.470> I

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 
inspires the art it's this kind of I

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.340 
inspires the art it's this kind of I
call<00:05:22.310> it<00:05:22.430> a<00:05:22.520> yin<00:05:22.820> yang<00:05:22.850> it's<00:05:23.420> this<00:05:23.690> circle<00:05:24.170> and

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:24.350 
call it a yin yang it's this circle and

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:27.720 
call it a yin yang it's this circle and
that's<00:05:25.310> what<00:05:25.640> keeps<00:05:25.850> pushing<00:05:26.420> the<00:05:27.290> technology

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:27.730 
that's what keeps pushing the technology

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:31.060 
that's what keeps pushing the technology
Pixar<00:05:28.730> invented<00:05:29.420> much<00:05:29.810> of<00:05:30.170> computer

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:31.070 
Pixar invented much of computer

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:35.230 
Pixar invented much of computer
animation<00:05:31.220> and<00:05:32.560> and<00:05:33.560> it<00:05:33.740> keeps<00:05:33.980> every<00:05:34.700> film

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:35.240 
animation and and it keeps every film

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.570 
animation and and it keeps every film
pushes<00:05:35.780> it<00:05:35.960> to<00:05:36.110> that<00:05:36.290> technology<00:05:37.130> to<00:05:37.370> new

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:37.580 
pushes it to that technology to new

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.640 
pushes it to that technology to new
levels<00:05:37.880> and<00:05:38.330> where<00:05:39.020> it's<00:05:39.140> going<00:05:39.260> to<00:05:39.350> go<00:05:39.440> in<00:05:39.560> the

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:39.650 
levels and where it's going to go in the

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:41.800 
levels and where it's going to go in the
future<00:05:39.830> really<00:05:40.310> depends<00:05:40.880> on<00:05:40.970> the<00:05:41.120> stories<00:05:41.600> we

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:41.810 
future really depends on the stories we

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:44.860 
future really depends on the stories we
want<00:05:42.140> to<00:05:42.230> tell<00:05:42.580> we<00:05:43.580> let<00:05:43.820> the<00:05:43.970> stories<00:05:44.390> develop

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:44.870 
want to tell we let the stories develop

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:46.690 
want to tell we let the stories develop
the<00:05:44.990> technology<00:05:45.650> but<00:05:45.890> then<00:05:46.010> we<00:05:46.130> get<00:05:46.280> inspired

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:46.700 
the technology but then we get inspired

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:49.090 
the technology but then we get inspired
from<00:05:47.150> it<00:05:47.360> so<00:05:48.200> we're<00:05:48.380> not<00:05:48.530> just<00:05:48.860> kind<00:05:48.980> of

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:49.100 
from it so we're not just kind of

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:50.800 
from it so we're not just kind of
creating<00:05:49.490> technology<00:05:50.210> and<00:05:50.420> sort<00:05:50.660> of

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:50.810 
creating technology and sort of

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:52.360 
creating technology and sort of
predicting<00:05:51.560> where<00:05:51.770> it's<00:05:51.920> going<00:05:52.100> to<00:05:52.160> go

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:52.370 
predicting where it's going to go

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:54.640 
predicting where it's going to go
because<00:05:52.850> it's<00:05:53.150> all<00:05:53.420> in<00:05:53.720> the<00:05:53.960> service<00:05:54.440> of

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:54.650 
because it's all in the service of

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:58.300 
because it's all in the service of
telling<00:05:55.160> the<00:05:55.310> story<00:05:56.620> technology<00:05:57.620> never

00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:58.310 
telling the story technology never

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:01.540 
telling the story technology never
inspires<00:05:58.850> or<00:05:59.570> never<00:05:59.870> entertains<00:06:00.590> an<00:06:01.070> audience

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:01.550 
inspires or never entertains an audience

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:03.790 
inspires or never entertains an audience
by<00:06:01.850> itself<00:06:02.540> it's<00:06:02.870> what<00:06:03.080> you<00:06:03.260> do<00:06:03.560> with<00:06:03.770> a

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:03.800 
by itself it's what you do with a

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.800 
by itself it's what you do with a
technology<00:06:04.310> that<00:06:04.760> entertains<00:06:05.240> an<00:06:05.420> audience

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:05.810 
technology that entertains an audience

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:10.570 
technology that entertains an audience
but<00:06:06.440> we<00:06:06.680> love<00:06:07.540> the<00:06:08.540> technology<00:06:09.290> at<00:06:09.530> Pixar<00:06:10.070> it
