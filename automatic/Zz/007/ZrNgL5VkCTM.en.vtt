week or at least wanting to going into
the<00:03:11.799> week<00:03:11.950> I<00:03:12.190> think<00:03:12.489> the<00:03:12.579> big<00:03:12.760> thing<00:03:12.790> I<00:03:13.090> talked

the week I think the big thing I talked

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.020 
the week I think the big thing I talked
to<00:03:13.660> our<00:03:13.840> players<00:03:14.079> about<00:03:14.260> this<00:03:14.500> we've<00:03:15.010> got<00:03:15.220> a<00:03:15.250> we

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
to our players about this we've got a we

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.420 
to our players about this we've got a we
got<00:03:16.060> to<00:03:16.239> know<00:03:16.540> what<00:03:16.840> we're<00:03:16.989> doing<00:03:17.200> then<00:03:18.190> we've

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
got to know what we're doing then we've

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.550 
got to know what we're doing then we've
got<00:03:18.459> to<00:03:18.700> learn<00:03:18.820> how<00:03:19.239> to<00:03:19.299> do<00:03:19.600> it<00:03:19.780> if<00:03:20.079> we<00:03:20.380> know

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
got to learn how to do it if we know

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:21.840 
got to learn how to do it if we know
what<00:03:20.799> we're<00:03:20.950> doing<00:03:21.130> it<00:03:21.370> can<00:03:21.489> write<00:03:21.700> it<00:03:21.820> down

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
what we're doing it can write it down

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.479 
what we're doing it can write it down
and<00:03:22.420> talk<00:03:22.959> through<00:03:23.230> it<00:03:23.350> and<00:03:23.470> get<00:03:23.590> lon<00:03:23.769> DUP<00:03:24.040> then

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
and talk through it and get lon DUP then

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:26.520 
and talk through it and get lon DUP then
we<00:03:24.700> can<00:03:24.880> really<00:03:25.180> work<00:03:25.360> on<00:03:25.570> how<00:03:25.900> to<00:03:25.959> do<00:03:26.290> it<00:03:26.440> and

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
we can really work on how to do it and

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.080 
we can really work on how to do it and
that's<00:03:27.040> the<00:03:27.160> key<00:03:27.370> but<00:03:27.579> if<00:03:27.670> you<00:03:27.790> don't<00:03:27.970> know

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
that's the key but if you don't know

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.670 
that's the key but if you don't know
what<00:03:28.239> you're<00:03:28.420> doing<00:03:28.660> then<00:03:28.989> you<00:03:29.110> can't<00:03:29.350> work<00:03:29.500> on

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
what you're doing then you can't work on

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.860 
what you're doing then you can't work on
the<00:03:29.799> rest<00:03:29.950> of<00:03:30.160> it<00:03:30.280> and<00:03:30.400> that's<00:03:31.090> the<00:03:31.180> whole<00:03:31.390> key

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
the rest of it and that's the whole key

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.979 
the rest of it and that's the whole key
for<00:03:32.110> us<00:03:32.230> know<00:03:32.799> what<00:03:33.010> to<00:03:33.130> do<00:03:33.299> learn<00:03:34.299> how<00:03:34.660> to<00:03:34.720> do

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
for us know what to do learn how to do

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:36.750 
for us know what to do learn how to do
it<00:03:35.140> and<00:03:35.290> when<00:03:35.620> we<00:03:35.709> get<00:03:35.860> 10<00:03:36.100> days<00:03:36.280> out<00:03:36.459> from<00:03:36.519> the

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
it and when we get 10 days out from the

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.610 
it and when we get 10 days out from the
first<00:03:36.970> opponent<00:03:37.450> we've<00:03:37.930> got<00:03:38.140> that<00:03:38.320> stuff

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
first opponent we've got that stuff

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.740 
first opponent we've got that stuff
there<00:03:38.860> and<00:03:39.280> still<00:03:39.549> learning<00:03:39.940> a<00:03:40.209> little<00:03:40.450> bit<00:03:40.600> of

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
there and still learning a little bit of

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.360 
there and still learning a little bit of
how<00:03:40.870> to<00:03:40.930> do<00:03:41.140> it<00:03:41.260> but<00:03:41.590> we're<00:03:41.769> focused<00:03:42.190> now<00:03:42.340> on

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
how to do it but we're focused now on

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.460 
how to do it but we're focused now on
opponents<00:03:42.790> so<00:03:43.060> we<00:03:43.180> can<00:03:43.329> study<00:03:43.570> opponents<00:03:44.140> in

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
opponents so we can study opponents in

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.410 
opponents so we can study opponents in
terms<00:03:44.799> of<00:03:44.950> known<00:03:45.250> what<00:03:45.459> to<00:03:45.489> do<00:03:45.730> where<00:03:46.299> do<00:03:46.360> you

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
terms of known what to do where do you

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.120 
terms of known what to do where do you
guys<00:03:46.540> stand<00:03:46.620> you<00:03:47.620> know<00:03:47.650> I<00:03:47.769> think<00:03:47.890> we're

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 
guys stand you know I think we're

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.130 
guys stand you know I think we're
getting<00:03:48.250> there<00:03:48.579> I'm<00:03:49.239> pleased<00:03:49.630> as<00:03:49.840> where<00:03:50.019> we're

at<00:03:50.170> we<00:03:50.650> still<00:03:51.220> got<00:03:51.340> a<00:03:51.370> ways<00:03:51.579> to<00:03:51.610> go<00:03:51.760> but<00:03:52.269> as<00:03:52.360> far

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
at we still got a ways to go but as far

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.330 
at we still got a ways to go but as far
as<00:03:52.570> everything<00:03:52.810> we've<00:03:53.170> got<00:03:53.320> in<00:03:53.530> i<00:03:53.769> think<00:03:54.220> the

as everything we've got in i think the

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:55.949 
as everything we've got in i think the
guys<00:03:54.519> have<00:03:54.820> got<00:03:55.030> a<00:03:55.060> grass<00:03:55.420> but<00:03:55.690> they're<00:03:55.870> still

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
guys have got a grass but they're still

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:57.539 
guys have got a grass but they're still
having<00:03:56.290> to<00:03:56.410> study<00:03:56.590> it<00:03:56.799> but<00:03:56.980> they've<00:03:57.370> got<00:03:57.400> a

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:57.549 
having to study it but they've got a

00:03:57.549 --> 00:03:59.670 
having to study it but they've got a
grasp<00:03:57.850> and<00:03:58.239> and<00:03:58.360> they<00:03:58.900> can<00:03:59.079> make<00:03:59.230> them<00:03:59.410> stake

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
grasp and and they can make them stake

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.800 
grasp and and they can make them stake
and<00:03:59.890> correct<00:04:00.250> themselves<00:04:00.459> or<00:04:00.970> teammate<00:04:01.570> Ken

and correct themselves or teammate Ken

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.140 
and correct themselves or teammate Ken
is<00:04:02.109> it<00:04:02.260> more<00:04:02.440> technique<00:04:02.950> in<00:04:03.190> snow<00:04:03.609> just<00:04:03.910> a<00:04:04.000> big

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
is it more technique in snow just a big

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.880 
is it more technique in snow just a big
thing<00:04:04.329> for<00:04:04.359> us<00:04:04.600> is<00:04:04.690> right<00:04:05.350> now<00:04:05.470> his<00:04:05.620> knowledge

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890 
thing for us is right now his knowledge

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.130 
thing for us is right now his knowledge
of<00:04:06.280> what<00:04:06.820> to<00:04:06.970> do<00:04:07.120> we've<00:04:07.630> got<00:04:07.810> a<00:04:07.840> lot<00:04:08.109> of

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.140 
of what to do we've got a lot of

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.080 
of what to do we've got a lot of
different<00:04:08.590> answers<00:04:08.980> in<00:04:09.130> our<00:04:09.489> schemes<00:04:09.850> not

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
different answers in our schemes not

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:12.599 
different answers in our schemes not
complicated<00:04:10.750> but<00:04:11.109> the<00:04:11.290> answer<00:04:11.620> based<00:04:11.920> on<00:04:12.160> what

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:12.609 
complicated but the answer based on what

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:14.729 
complicated but the answer based on what
the<00:04:12.760> offense<00:04:13.090> is<00:04:13.239> doing<00:04:13.540> is<00:04:13.780> the<00:04:14.500> things

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:14.739 
the offense is doing is the things

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:15.690 
the offense is doing is the things
they've<00:04:14.920> got<00:04:15.069> to<00:04:15.160> understand

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700 
they've got to understand

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.090 
they've got to understand
and<00:04:15.819> once<00:04:16.359> they<00:04:16.600> get<00:04:16.780> that<00:04:17.049> down<00:04:17.320> then<00:04:17.919> they'll

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.100 
and once they get that down then they'll

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.610 
and once they get that down then they'll
work<00:04:18.639> more<00:04:18.940> on<00:04:18.970> how<00:04:19.630> to<00:04:19.690> execute<00:04:20.350> your

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
work more on how to execute your

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.920 
work more on how to execute your
technique<00:04:21.040> and<00:04:21.250> the<00:04:21.280> trends<00:04:22.240> of<00:04:22.300> it<00:04:22.450> is<00:04:22.510> the

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
technique and the trends of it is the

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.990 
technique and the trends of it is the
closer<00:04:23.230> you<00:04:23.380> are<00:04:23.530> to<00:04:23.710> the<00:04:23.830> ball<00:04:24.070> the<00:04:24.730> less<00:04:24.970> you

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
closer you are to the ball the less you

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.060 
closer you are to the ball the less you
have<00:04:25.389> to<00:04:25.450> know<00:04:25.690> what<00:04:25.870> to<00:04:25.990> do<00:04:26.139> and<00:04:26.710> the<00:04:26.860> better

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
have to know what to do and the better

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.129 
have to know what to do and the better
you've<00:04:27.310> got<00:04:27.460> to<00:04:27.580> be<00:04:27.700> at<00:04:27.850> it<00:04:27.970> instantly<00:04:28.540> so<00:04:28.990> our

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:29.139 
you've got to be at it instantly so our

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:31.200 
you've got to be at it instantly so our
defensive<00:04:29.680> linemen<00:04:30.040> have<00:04:30.400> less<00:04:30.760> to<00:04:31.000> learn

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
defensive linemen have less to learn

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.300 
defensive linemen have less to learn
mentally<00:04:31.720> but<00:04:32.139> so<00:04:32.560> they<00:04:32.710> know<00:04:32.919> what<00:04:33.070> to<00:04:33.130> do

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
mentally but so they know what to do

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.670 
mentally but so they know what to do
right<00:04:33.490> now<00:04:33.669> their<00:04:34.120> work<00:04:34.330> on<00:04:34.690> techniques<00:04:35.260> our

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
right now their work on techniques our

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.500
