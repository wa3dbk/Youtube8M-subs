00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
this little additional footage because

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.189 
this little additional footage because
that<00:00:14.160> particular<00:00:14.340> video<00:00:14.880> was<00:00:15.330> way<00:00:15.570> too<00:00:15.630> long

it was 20 minutes long and it was 300
megabytes<00:00:20.189> which<00:00:20.490> I<00:00:20.609> had<00:00:20.760> to<00:00:20.850> compress<00:00:21.210> down

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449

the<00:00:21.630> ninety<00:00:21.930> nine<00:00:22.080> megabytes<00:00:22.289> and<00:00:23.189> thereby

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
the ninety nine megabytes and thereby

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.089 
the ninety nine megabytes and thereby
reducing<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.150> quality<00:00:24.269> of<00:00:24.689> it<00:00:25.050> and<00:00:25.230> if<00:00:25.949> you're

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099

various web cams but really the bottom

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.560 
various web cams but really the bottom
line<00:01:07.260> is<00:01:07.850> webcams<00:01:08.850> are<00:01:09.090> pretty<00:01:09.390> much

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
line is webcams are pretty much

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.190 
line is webcams are pretty much
processor<00:01:10.260> intensive<00:01:10.790> if<00:01:11.790> your<00:01:12.450> webcams<00:01:12.900> not

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
processor intensive if your webcams not

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.260 
processor intensive if your webcams not
working<00:01:13.560> very<00:01:13.740> good<00:01:14.040> it<00:01:14.310> made<00:01:14.729> this<00:01:14.939> be

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
working very good it made this be

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.969 
working very good it made this be
because<00:01:15.420> your<00:01:15.780> computer's<00:01:16.259> not<00:01:16.439> get<00:01:16.680> enough

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
because your computer's not get enough

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.020 
because your computer's not get enough
but<00:01:17.729> this<00:01:17.939> particular<00:01:18.860> webcam<00:01:19.860> to<00:01:20.610> me<00:01:20.790> really

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
but this particular webcam to me really

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.700 
but this particular webcam to me really
does<00:01:21.299> seem<00:01:21.540> like<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.750> pretty<00:01:21.990> good<00:01:22.200> compromise

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
does seem like a pretty good compromise

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.580 
does seem like a pretty good compromise

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
it requires a pretty good computer

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.060 
it requires a pretty good computer
