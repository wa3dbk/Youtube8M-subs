00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:09.240
 We are back here for luck 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.250
 germany has the eighth finals 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.099
 done and our last wm oracle 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.960
 were not that bad 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:17.340
 they marched in portugal 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.070
 against ghana we had one after 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.720
 defeat for germany and typed 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.609
 victorious against usa is true again so 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.260
 means is now so completely but where they are 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:30.480
 It was not an outstanding victory either 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:32.640
 is 38 Algeria 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.489
 that means for us we start again 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.809
 press watch starts again and there 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.149
 I would say that one at once 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.989
 Direct gas then by the way only as short 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.180
 before we start 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.070
 Fans players like Mark Walsh do not tricks 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.420
 only with twenties for us last time 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:51.559
 this career market which age 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:01:02.300
 colleague sees Germany moritz bank 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:01:02.300
 Algeria takes over Germany heavily 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.840
 minute the 1 0 for the dream pass in the 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.610
 top 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.799
 so you can still go or people 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.060
 here second minute algeria directly 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:25.100
 in the barriers 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.660
 and jerky us only still awake will 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.070
 already look longer here 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:39.590
 start off and with a minimum 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:43.300
 five to one wins almost to mario 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.300
 The place is in franc position 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.420
 Besides 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:56.900
 the dare is not there yet is 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:58.580
 no vgw but that was the will 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:01.040
 you can tell it's a bit more 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:08.899
 Steam now behind it as if they had 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:11.120
 secretly practiced toni kroos 20 largest 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.500
 Kopfballtor that's the aftermath 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:20.090
 deceived tangible 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:23.270
 jogi löw likes to celebrate cope now 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.040
 they will be short again now 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.290
 Of course now I half sue 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.350
 time was the fire on your 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.870
 half of both götze therefore 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:35.660
 45 minute özil would have thought so yes 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.730
 already two gates have to be yes 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.049
 Algeria would measure up like that I would 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.000
 I'm going right the second half 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:51.380
 definitely and look something else 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:59.840
 is possible for the Algerians we have 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:03:02.209
 the control is exchanged now but only 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.440
 20 meters further to ninja and he would be 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:05.440
 maybe also dangerous 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:13.670
 Defensive error and the flank was 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.920
 fantastic the flank so if he 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:19.760
 almost seven meters tall would have been 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:21.220
 the sturgeon would have probably 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.200
 still caught 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:26.900
 but here the Algerians get into it 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.840
 So the use is right you have to 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:32.010
 really say so 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:33.120
 nothing to lose the defense of 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:39.870
 German but also just a bit 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:42.379
 careless but very nice now 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.379
 nice, very nice 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:50.150
 pulls in and a quiet is that 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:53.300
 321 mesut ozil yes that's not clear yet 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:54.920
 Interestingly enough, a nice goal 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.750
 our wm oracle always meet the the 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.940
 then never actually meet 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.570
 so no klose there probably no goal shot 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:03.950
 but our last game is two goals against 

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:05.690
 play germany is comfortable down 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.570
 to spare power then for france 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:13.640
 or Nigeria depending on again to 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:18.769
 left and the flank no to it 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:20.120
 slowly forward and that's 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:25.820
 unbelievable why are you doing such a ball ? 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:29.050
 next to it with the free kick but 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:33.080
 I will give you back because he is like that 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:35.300
 This team friendship is incredibly good 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:45.350
 but also the Germans already quite 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:49.419
 So fit in the head now from Germany 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:52.060
 Algeria 3212 times looks once sat 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:54.020
 slimani for algeria 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.640
 the soft ones for an exciting one 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:58.040
 quarterfinals are put 

00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:00.200
 I'm definitely looking forward to being in 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:02.780
 Germany will compete says Frank 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.980
 year old is not over france very much 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.570
 nice quarterfinals I think 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:07.790
 French people are in a good mood too 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:09.410
 we could be a bit steamy 

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:12.550
 see you again as soon as the 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:16.550
 quarterfinal matches are fixed and 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:17.630
 I'll see who gets on well 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.310
 hope you have some fun with it 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:22.210
