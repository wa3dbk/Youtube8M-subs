easier<00:02:07.479> than<00:02:07.960> free<00:02:08.590> line<00:02:08.800> I<00:02:08.830> think<00:02:09.510> my<00:02:10.510> feet

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
easier than free line I think my feet

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.690 
easier than free line I think my feet
and<00:02:10.990> my<00:02:11.080> brain<00:02:11.470> have<00:02:11.740> to<00:02:11.920> work<00:02:12.070> together<00:02:12.280> a<00:02:12.580> lot

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
and my brain have to work together a lot

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.520 
and my brain have to work together a lot
more<00:02:13.060> than<00:02:13.240> they<00:02:13.390> do<00:02:13.450> on<00:02:13.959> a<00:02:14.170> skateboard

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
more than they do on a skateboard

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.590 
more than they do on a skateboard
because<00:02:15.190> my<00:02:15.310> feet<00:02:15.550> are<00:02:15.580> steering<00:02:15.940> agent<00:02:16.390> and

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
because my feet are steering agent and

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.760 
because my feet are steering agent and
its<00:02:16.780> gates<00:02:17.080> so<00:02:17.770> I<00:02:18.130> think<00:02:18.459> it's<00:02:18.760> kind<00:02:19.180> of<00:02:19.300> like<00:02:19.420> a
