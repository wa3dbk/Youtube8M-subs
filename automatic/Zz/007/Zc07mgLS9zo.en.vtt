00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:09.219
 hello all the students themselves castle and me 

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:11.420
 Mikhail Grigoriev in this video I 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:12.809
 tell you how to install and 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.169
 tune 

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:15.759
 for realistic 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:18.099
 images straight into this 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:20.109
 on the third how to tell where 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:22.980
 take foreman planing as well as install 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.519
 I would like to say 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:27.359
 then still it is generally used and why 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.149
 convenient to use with lacquer 

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:32.529
 my understanding of ashgar is just convenient 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:34.649
 a way to get all the quality 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.990
 image in difficult shooting conditions 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:38.280
 or for example 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.390
 for example new commercial 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.340
 real estate photographer 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.730
 and you were given the task of taking pictures of everything 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.950
 rooms of a luxury hotel by the sea 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.550
 Naturally the customer wants to 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.380
 the photographs showed an elegant image 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.170
 half a period of $ magnificent 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.230
 species which opens 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.630
 from windows on one measure 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.430
 do it in one frame ordinary camera m 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.129
 most likely will not work 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.259
 you will have none too dark trimer 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:10.590
 and it was too white for the windows 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.590
 this situation you have two choices 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:14.390
 did not have 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.090
 used external sources 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:17.340
 Sveta 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.470
 set up lighting systems 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.220
 hide what you don't need shadow n what 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.600
 the most beautiful will highlight the opposite 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.170
 to ask 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.830
 display options 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.610
 make a frame and you get what you 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.530
 need to 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.020
 but if rub 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.380
 and at the basis of such a possibility for example 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.080
 the hotel has 500 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.900
 rooms and all of them need to cling to Russia 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.220
 then 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.680
 technology zhdyar so this is what 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.840
 you will save your task 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.580
 because you can in pretty quickly 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.130
 make service a series of several citrix 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.190
 positions 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:55.730
 process in special 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:58.070
 program and get the output pretty 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:59.190
 decent 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.840
 the quality of the photo that should 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.900
 arrange customer 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.450
 I always strive to learn 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.179
 realistic image 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.809
 vlad most natural 

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:13.229
 so-called 

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:14.829
 but because 

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:16.869
 the customer usually wants it 

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:19.609
 this criterion meets the image 

00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:21.479
 which is obtained 

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:24.479
 yes she comes out the program orange news 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:27.030
 applying the cause of guaranteeing 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.939
 got a bunch of flowers 

00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:31.569
 ap photo will look much stronger 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:34.019

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:56.119
 word files 

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:59.569
 startup options must be specified manually 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:02.129
 agree it is rather inconvenient when 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:05.299
 large volumes of photos 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:07.669

 that's why they say I use planets 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.829
 body eu market because they allow 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:34.529
 not all program starts 

00:03:34.529 --> 00:03:37.529
 write off the roman we will not be the leader manually 

00:03:37.529 --> 00:03:40.509
 all these tedious options 

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:41.979
 just copy enough 

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:44.689
