to check this out i'm just going to give
you<00:00:49.410> a<00:00:49.440> brief<00:00:49.680> overview<00:00:49.860> of<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.790> hardware

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:51.150 
you a brief overview of the hardware

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.000 
you a brief overview of the hardware
here<00:00:51.540> and<00:00:51.750> then<00:00:51.840> we<00:00:51.960> will<00:00:52.140> run<00:00:52.290> a<00:00:52.350> benchmark

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
here and then we will run a benchmark

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.770 
here and then we will run a benchmark
test<00:00:53.280> on<00:00:53.490> it<00:00:53.520> so<00:00:53.970> you<00:00:54.000> can<00:00:54.240> kind<00:00:54.480> of<00:00:54.570> get<00:00:54.690> an

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
test on it so you can kind of get an

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.510 
test on it so you can kind of get an
idea<00:00:54.870> where<00:00:55.290> it<00:00:55.380> sits<00:00:55.560> in<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:55.950> smartphone

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
idea where it sits in the smartphone

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.280 
idea where it sits in the smartphone
world<00:00:56.790> but<00:00:57.390> let's<00:00:57.570> go<00:00:57.660> ahead<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:57.870> take<00:00:58.080> a<00:00:58.110> look

at the device here on the top left we do

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.900 
at the device here on the top left we do
have<00:01:00.990> our<00:01:01.200> 1.3<00:01:02.130> megapixel<00:01:02.670> front-facing

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910

camera and then in the middle we have

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.380 
camera and then in the middle we have
our<00:01:04.800> earpiece<00:01:05.309> followed<00:01:05.850> by<00:01:05.940> the<00:01:06.000> proximity

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
our earpiece followed by the proximity

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.630 
our earpiece followed by the proximity
sensor<00:01:06.600> hidden<00:01:07.170> over<00:01:07.380> on<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.800> right<00:01:08.040> side<00:01:08.370> on

the<00:01:09.060> bottom<00:01:09.330> of<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.570> device<00:01:09.720> we<00:01:10.080> do<00:01:10.260> have<00:01:10.470> a

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
the bottom of the device we do have a

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.410 
the bottom of the device we do have a

which you can use to charge up the 2300
milliamp<00:01:52.560> hour<00:01:52.770> battery<00:01:52.890> found<00:01:53.520> inside<00:01:54.000> so

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
milliamp hour battery found inside so

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.850 
milliamp hour battery found inside so
let's<00:01:54.630> go<00:01:54.720> ahead<00:01:54.750> and<00:01:54.960> power<00:01:55.259> on<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.830> device

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
let's go ahead and power on the device

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.940 
let's go ahead and power on the device
and<00:01:56.220> we<00:01:57.090> can<00:01:57.210> get<00:01:57.360> it<00:01:57.479> set<00:01:57.690> up<00:01:57.720> with<00:01:58.080> my<00:01:58.440> account

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
and we can get it set up with my account

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.400 
and we can get it set up with my account
information<00:01:59.729> and<00:01:59.970> we<00:02:00.119> will<00:02:00.330> run<00:02:00.509> a<00:02:00.750> geekbench

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:01.410 
information and we will run a geekbench

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.440 
information and we will run a geekbench
test<00:02:01.800> now<00:02:02.009> I'm<00:02:02.250> going<00:02:02.520> to<00:02:02.580> be<00:02:02.670> using<00:02:02.759> Geekbench

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
test now I'm going to be using Geekbench

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.690 
test now I'm going to be using Geekbench
3<00:02:03.569> for<00:02:04.229> this<00:02:04.500> test<00:02:04.740> so<00:02:04.890> we<00:02:05.009> can<00:02:05.190> kind<00:02:05.340> of<00:02:05.490> get<00:02:05.610> an

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
3 for this test so we can kind of get an

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.210 
3 for this test so we can kind of get an
idea<00:02:05.789> of<00:02:06.030> where<00:02:06.360> this<00:02:06.539> sits<00:02:06.869> in<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.679> world<00:02:07.920> of

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
idea of where this sits in the world of

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.309 
idea of where this sits in the world of
smartphones<00:02:08.819> as<00:02:09.119> far<00:02:09.360> as<00:02:09.509> performance<00:02:09.720> goes

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
smartphones as far as performance goes
