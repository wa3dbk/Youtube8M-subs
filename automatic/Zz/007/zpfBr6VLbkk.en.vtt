00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:13.660
 Hector CÃ©sia was born on January 2 , 1959 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:16.460

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:25.930
 etc 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:29.010
 I lived up to the age of 16 17 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:29.010
 years when I retired 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:35.200
 a few months here at the university 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:37.510
 the reality is that there was not in that in 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.950
 that time in nicaragua what to me 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.280
 loved to study what engineering was 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:41.280
 mechanics 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.629
 with only 23 years old hector got the 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:54.750
 position of general director of the 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.539
 firefighters in nicaragua and led one of 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.719
 the largest fires registered in 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:03.059
 our country was a very beautiful life the 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:07.570
 enjoyment 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:10.290
 managed a fleet of 200 300 trucks to 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.290
 national level 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:16.730
 I had the good fortune to visit a lot 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.590
 countries in academies in schools in 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:21.910
 purchase of equipment in exchanges 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:25.580
 international to become 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:27.700
 ad honorem advisor of the air group 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.990
 for issues of disaster issues 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.260
 for the non - government outside the 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.260
 state 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.280
 there are many experiences that mark you 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.140
 life for me 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.140
 the first impact when it saves the 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.940
 first life was recorded for me 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.190
 forever 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.990
 then I remember tragedy of many children 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.580
 in the channels when this rain 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.810
 etc. etc. I do not know how many children 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:00.649
 we saved or are still saving the firemen 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.130
 but if experience lasts in a bell 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:05.350
 the mitch 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.760
 the eruptions of the black hill volcano 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.720
 not 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.720
 92 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:16.130
 and both the September 2 tsunami 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.960
 1992 attack destroyed the entire coast 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.340
 of the Pacific all the infrastructure 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:23.370
 tourist of nicaragua 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:26.099
 there we had to walk will not know how many 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:29.819
 days without sleep without eating without anything 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:32.790
 trying to save victims currently 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:34.920
 Hector is already retired however 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.799
 loses contact with the general management 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.400
 of the firefighters assuring that the new 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:42.540
 generation has a lot to promise 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.489
 Nicaragua has a very platform 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.299
 solid on that what makes 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:51.740
 lack is to endow it with all the resources 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:56.140
 needed to be able to route what 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:59.090
 that is to say in other words there is a there is a 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:01.910
 trained human resource prepared and in 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:04.820
 which I obviously trust the technique 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.440
 over the years it has been depreciating or 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.970
 it's been wearing away etcetera but I have 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.040
 understood that there are very government plans 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.660
 serious to equip with a technology 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.400
 modern to the institution 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.620
 and I think it's going to be a very leap 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.110
 qualitative in Nicaragua on 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.720
 fire protection enjoy 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:23.210
 his family especially his granddaughter is 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:27.120
 priority for hector right now 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:29.950
 but he also has future projects 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:33.610
 I have been writing three books 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:35.810
 one is going to call my girlfriend security 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.300
 the other book speaks 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.280
 memory of a fireman where I narrate my 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:43.370
 life experience throughout 28 29 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.960
 years of firefighters in Nicaragua and the 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.160
 world 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:50.540
 and a third book an effort for 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.250
 rescue a little the characters of the 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.610
 village 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:57.760
 from that for there are many characters 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:04:01.160
 that have a long tradition scope 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.480
 Latin the one from the fish market all these people 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.420
 talk about all those experiences 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.870
 children that we live and enjoy with 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.870
 the friends 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:13.470
