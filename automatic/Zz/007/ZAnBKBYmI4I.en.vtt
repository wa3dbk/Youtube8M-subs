plays<00:02:12.040> a<00:02:12.070> role<00:02:12.370> in<00:02:12.400> linking<00:02:12.790> the<00:02:13.120> endocrine

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
plays a role in linking the endocrine

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.229 
plays a role in linking the endocrine
and<00:02:13.930> nervous<00:02:13.989> systems<00:02:14.680> it<00:02:15.340> also<00:02:15.370> plays<00:02:15.970> a<00:02:16.000> role

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
and nervous systems it also plays a role

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:19.430 
and nervous systems it also plays a role
in<00:02:16.270> many<00:02:16.450> metabolic<00:02:17.380> processes

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
in many metabolic processes

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.010 
in many metabolic processes
I<00:02:19.520> chose<00:02:20.520> to<00:02:20.700> do<00:02:20.790> my<00:02:20.820> model<00:02:21.390> on<00:02:21.420> the<00:02:21.780> brain

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
I chose to do my model on the brain

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.990 
I chose to do my model on the brain
because<00:02:22.470> unlike<00:02:22.800> other<00:02:22.980> organs<00:02:23.460> and<00:02:23.610> tissues

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
because unlike other organs and tissues

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.600 
because unlike other organs and tissues
it<00:02:24.390> controls<00:02:25.050> a<00:02:25.230> multitude<00:02:25.620> of<00:02:25.920> functions<00:02:26.130> in

it controls a multitude of functions in

it controls a multitude of functions in
the<00:02:26.850> human<00:02:27.120> body
