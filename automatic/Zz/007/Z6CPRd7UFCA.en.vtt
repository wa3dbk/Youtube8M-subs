100<00:00:36.390> quarts<00:00:36.750> of<00:00:36.960> water<00:00:37.020> now<00:00:37.980> you<00:00:38.010> can<00:00:38.340> use

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
100 quarts of water now you can use

100 quarts of water now you can use
activated<00:00:39.270> nuts<00:00:39.930> which<00:00:40.200> means<00:00:40.530> that<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:41.160> nuts

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
activated nuts which means that the nuts

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.819 
activated nuts which means that the nuts
have<00:00:41.640> been<00:00:41.850> soaked<00:00:42.239> overnight<00:00:42.719> in<00:00:43.200> water<00:00:43.559> then

have been soaked overnight in water then

have been soaked overnight in water then
drained<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:44.280> rinsed<00:00:44.489> this<00:00:45.059> is<00:00:45.180> a<00:00:45.210> really<00:00:45.480> good

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
drained and rinsed this is a really good

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.479 
drained and rinsed this is a really good
point<00:00:45.809> because<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.500> enzymes<00:00:46.890> become<00:00:47.219> more

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
point because the enzymes become more

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.310 
point because the enzymes become more
bioavailable<00:00:47.910> when<00:00:48.690> you<00:00:48.780> do<00:00:48.899> that<00:00:49.050> but<00:00:49.230> today

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
bioavailable when you do that but today

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.360 
bioavailable when you do that but today
we're<00:00:49.620> just<00:00:49.710> going<00:00:49.890> to<00:00:49.980> use<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.190> ones

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
we're just going to use the ones

if you run out of milk at any time I'm

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.420 
if you run out of milk at any time I'm
gonna<00:00:54.180> blender<00:00:54.690> for<00:00:54.809> 35<00:00:55.320> seconds<00:00:55.829> until

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
gonna blender for 35 seconds until

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:12.859 

five<00:01:11.219> seconds<00:01:11.579> feels<00:01:11.850> like<00:01:11.969> a<00:01:12.000> long<00:01:12.299> time<00:01:12.570> when

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
five seconds feels like a long time when

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.319 
five seconds feels like a long time when
the<00:01:12.930> blenders<00:01:13.350> going<00:01:13.520> now<00:01:14.520> you<00:01:14.549> can<00:01:14.820> leave<00:01:15.090> the

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:15.329 
the blenders going now you can leave the

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:17.120 
the blenders going now you can leave the
mixture<00:01:15.479> like<00:01:15.899> this<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:16.530> strain<00:01:16.920> it<00:01:17.100> through

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
mixture like this and strain it through

you're gonna use it with kids they

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.169 
you're gonna use it with kids they
usually<00:01:22.500> like<00:01:22.770> it<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:22.950> little<00:01:23.070> bit<00:01:23.250> sweeter<00:01:23.490> so

some<00:01:32.429> success<00:01:32.880> salt<00:01:33.119> is<00:01:33.240> amazing<00:01:33.780> for<00:01:33.869> has

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
some success salt is amazing for has

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.749 
some success salt is amazing for has
that<00:01:34.319> same<00:01:34.560> chemical<00:01:35.009> structure<00:01:35.429> as

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
that same chemical structure as

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.580 
that same chemical structure as
embryonic<00:01:36.119> fluid<00:01:36.479> so<00:01:36.810> it's<00:01:36.960> really<00:01:37.200> easily

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
embryonic fluid so it's really easily

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.499 
embryonic fluid so it's really easily
absorbed<00:01:38.009> into<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.460> body<00:01:38.579> with<00:01:39.119> all<00:01:39.210> of<00:01:39.390> the

00:01:45.919 --> 00:01:45.929 
vanilla seed or vanilla pod so I'm gonna

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:49.309 
vanilla seed or vanilla pod so I'm gonna
take<00:01:46.200> my<00:01:46.259> knife<00:01:46.789> slice<00:01:47.789> gently<00:01:48.360> down<00:01:48.569> one<00:01:48.959> side

00:01:49.309 --> 00:01:49.319 
take my knife slice gently down one side

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:50.839 
take my knife slice gently down one side
not<00:01:49.649> all<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:49.950> way<00:01:50.039> through<00:01:50.069> with<00:01:50.490> just<00:01:50.670> one

00:01:50.839 --> 00:01:50.849 
not all the way through with just one

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:54.020 
not all the way through with just one
side<00:01:51.209> of<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.990> vanilla<00:01:52.289> seed<00:01:52.740> once<00:01:53.640> I've<00:01:53.819> got

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
side of the vanilla seed once I've got

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.830 
side of the vanilla seed once I've got
to<00:01:54.209> the<00:01:54.330> end<00:01:54.569> I<00:01:54.899> can<00:01:55.319> peel<00:01:55.619> that<00:01:55.890> open<00:01:56.429> and<00:01:57.330> then

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
to the end I can peel that open and then

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.719 
to the end I can peel that open and then
use<00:01:58.080> the<00:01:58.229> edge<00:01:58.349> of<00:01:58.500> a<00:01:58.619> spoon<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:59.159> scrape<00:01:59.459> out

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
use the edge of a spoon to scrape out

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.580 
use the edge of a spoon to scrape out
the<00:01:59.789> tiny<00:02:00.240> little<00:02:00.420> seeds<00:02:00.869> that<00:02:01.409> are<00:02:01.470> inside

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
the tiny little seeds that are inside

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:17.080 
the tiny little seeds that are inside
the<00:02:02.189> vanilla<00:02:02.520> sea<00:02:03.380> there<00:02:04.380> we<00:02:04.560> go

well<00:03:28.450> you<00:03:28.570> can<00:03:28.720> actually<00:03:28.870> dehydrate<00:03:29.710> just<00:03:30.280> the

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:30.460 
well you can actually dehydrate just the

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:32.670 
well you can actually dehydrate just the
pulp<00:03:30.700> itself<00:03:31.120> to<00:03:31.300> make<00:03:31.420> an<00:03:31.540> almond<00:03:31.930> flour<00:03:32.260> to

be used in baking if you're not a real

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.050 
be used in baking if you're not a real

so that's a great way of making your

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.860 
so that's a great way of making your
face<00:03:38.590> for<00:03:38.860> a<00:03:38.890> gluten-free<00:03:39.280> fat<00:03:39.820> flour<00:03:40.240> to<00:03:40.840> make

that's<00:03:43.240> left<00:03:43.570> over<00:03:43.830> altogether<00:03:44.830> so<00:03:45.040> we<00:03:45.130> simply

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
that's left over altogether so we simply

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.610 
that's left over altogether so we simply
keep<00:03:45.640> making<00:03:46.000> sure<00:03:46.210> the<00:03:46.690> pulp<00:03:46.960> comes<00:03:47.230> into<00:03:47.530> the
