00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:09.070
 let's see now how we did the 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:11.830
 another day we had a plan to see castle 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:13.990
 activated with breach of 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:16.170
 contractual situations that we had 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.420
 agreed with 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.970
 the company organizing the action 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.510
 caps therefore we have activated the plan 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.970
 see the plan see that it will start from 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:30.330
 of July 21 with a 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.250
 initial concentration montecastillo that 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.280
 out the match on the 23rd against the 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:39.239
 athletic club and later on day 25 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:42.059
 there will be another game that I think 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.129
 our next days we will leave 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.809
 closed from there we will leave 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.489
 of Germany in the concentration that 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.250
 was planned where they disputed the two 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:53.590
 matches 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:56.060
 and the return is scheduled for day 2 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.260
 to Seville where the 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.390
 trainings that attend the 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.160
 planning to the fund was planned 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.890
 say we have replaced this 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.869
 concentration this fiber in turkey by 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:09.320
 a master city for a concentration 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:11.840
 closest in montecastillo and we have 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.520
 maintained or we will maintain the level of 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.200
 the friendly matches that is to say was 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.660
 planned to play against olympique de 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.880
 marseille against olympiacos we can 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.680
 against the athletic club and another match 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.210
 that is about to determine that I believe that 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:27.470
 the next few days we will have it closed 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.420
 the carranza with an option that 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.180
 we contemplate 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:35.450
 and we contemplate it especially because 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.880
 sports level is a good option but 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.890
 we also contemplate another seam for 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.700
 so much I believe that the final decision the 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:45.619
 We will take it within a maximum period of two days 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:48.740
 well I'll answer you very 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:50.450
 honestly and I when I accepted the challenge 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.759
 to come to Real Betis football 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.470
 logically he was informed of all 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:57.110
 the projects that were open in the 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.520
 club is to say something is for me 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.070
 same I have four meters 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.310
 said this because the president of the 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:06.740
 board of directors put us 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:09.319
 on Friday the situation both to me as 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.480
 the technical body transmitted to us 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:14.720
 tranquility 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:18.110
 and if I tell the truth or a child never 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.950
 my name is my only 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.380
 obligations to do things the best 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.180
 possible for the outside honestly 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.349
 I have to isolate me a bit from the 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.610
 situation 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:30.840
 I have to think that this does not owe me 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.400
 slow down in no time to get 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.050
 make the best possible team that 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.300
 let's have the best sports project 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:39.450
 possible and good I think for the good 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:44.099
 of beticism along the coast at the end 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:45.930
 of the road they will be able to right themselves I think 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:47.970
 that people are interested in today 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.950
 what is going to be your get and what will be the 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.720
 prototype and that what we're going to see the 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.120
 next year in the villamarÃ­n and for 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.860
 So there is where I have to be 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.060
 concentrated hundred percent and where 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.950
 coaching staff has to be 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.370
 concentrated one hundred percent where the 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.360
 players have the planning 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.000
 we are fulfilling it scrupulously and 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:09.269
 We will continue to fulfill it 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.340
 moved at all an exact apex from 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:13.709
 the board of directors that has not 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.150
 transferred this tranquility and this 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:17.849
 eternity to work for so much 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.100
 I will scrupulously fulfill the 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:22.830
 planning as 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:25.000
 2 on May 1 that was my arrival at 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:27.760
 real betis football 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.760
 as for the exit operation we had 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:33.099
 we were always working 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.319
 there are situations that are progressing as 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:37.329
 better a little more slowly than 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:39.430
 we would like but this is progressing 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:41.140
 I insist too many people 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.689
 footballers we are not that those of 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:46.120
 always as much as we can have 

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:48.069
 agreements between clubs no matter how much 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.450
 let's see that the situation is good for a 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:51.790
 footballer our other product 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:54.549
 tried to convince him not then in this 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:57.010
 I can not push myself 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:58.989
 other clubs the footballers have to 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.599
 have really debate let's go 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:04.090
 advancing I am I am I can be 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:06.900
 quiet not on the other hand as the 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:09.400
 names will come many will have many 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:13.060
 usual story now and again 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.799
 listen to a footballer man who can 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.630
 make futuribles for the betis like 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:19.060
 want to call him 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:22.600
 the reality that now after having 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:24.820
 seated the team in what is the part 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:27.610
 back what is the center of the field 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:30.210
 we are going to focus a little more on 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:32.350
 reinforce what is the offensive part 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.870
 I'm not going to tell you the number of players 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:37.390
 but really at least two players 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:39.610
 of offensive features with another 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:42.160
 contribution in speed of this balance and 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:44.539
 that give us more consistency more strength 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.830
 in attack we are going to bring 

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:49.770
 the characteristics of these players 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:51.569
 Well, what is the type of football like? 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:54.090
 that we want to perform vertical soccer 

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:55.770
 precision football speed soccer 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:58.410
 therefore he has to be a footballer who 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:00.289
 you adapt and that great in what already 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:02.589
 we have behind you 

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:04.039
 even gave the name is telling me 

00:05:02.589 --> 00:05:06.439
 will lose 

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:07.849
 it's worth clarifying it is not a 

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:09.669
 footballer who enters our plans 

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:11.869
 while to project the equation 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:13.969
 just to tell you or just like 

00:05:11.869 --> 00:05:16.809
 said the other day another player is not a 

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:16.809
 our objective
