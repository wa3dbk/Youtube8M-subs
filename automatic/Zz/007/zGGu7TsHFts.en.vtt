00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.900
 hey people and welcome here 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.990
 closes hardware and software 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:17.090
 reviews today with 29 noiseblockers 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.910
 fan out of the evp series 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.850
 Thanks in advance for the first 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.200
 support from noiseblocker and as always 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:26.120
 the same as the note in the video 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:30.710
 description there is more information 

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:35.180
 and also useful internet links so we 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:37.850
 have here the club b12 minus one and 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.920
 the second version of it 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.220
 There are also three and four who are themselves 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:47.090
 then of course in efficiency 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:50.720
 speak apm number or english scenery 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:52.520
 or airflow yes I sign pack 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:56.210
 this time out the b1 where the 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:59.600
 differences between b a joke - is - 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:03.079
 1 and 2 I will still lie to you 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.729
 explain in this video so before here 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:06.409
 to the packaging here are new 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:10.969
 blogger equal to a few information 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:14.889
 we have 0 001 persons 800 pm 

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:20.749
 and we have a dcb development at 

00:01:14.889 --> 00:01:24.049
 783 and a flight defect of 57 3 

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:26.149
 cubic meters the hour on the back 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:29.359
 we have a few more 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:30.350
 Information about the rated voltage to the 

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:34.219
 revolutions 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.719
 but that's all there 

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:39.289
 pictured here is again the 

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:42.649
 connection 1 3 pin molex or again 3 

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:44.450
 pin connection fell further important there 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:47.749
 it's the new packaging did not 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:52.159
 same is on this as well as on 

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:53.719
 fan with the blexer offers here 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:55.819
 new blogger the way the 

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:59.359
 Cable length determine yourself have here 

00:01:55.819 --> 00:02:02.299
 we have some liftes cable in the black 20 

00:01:59.359 --> 00:02:04.819
 centimeters long the same in again 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:07.700
 a length of 50 centimeters with the 3 

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:09.440
 pin connection as well as the czech with 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.410
 screw me nuts and bolts 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.730
 and then of course even in the 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.010
 hatch fan 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.900
 This is very stable built I think 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.260
 also here at the corners are to the 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:23.110
 vibration attached to the rubbers 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.160
 now we have in the three pin 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.810
 I hope you can do that now 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.840
 See everything like that when I'm constantly that 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:34.550
 something sharper and here we have 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:38.030
 because again the logo with the loop mb 2 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:39.519
 - is a slogan yes why are they 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.420
 fan so special 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:47.569
 yes this is a biological design 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:50.360
 is based on nature and thereby 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:53.420
 Here can be very high performance 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.940
 but also be achieved very low 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.519
 There are also noises 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:01.040
 possible we see here a complete 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:03.140
 new fashion compared to one 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.750
 Location fans like this year 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:09.860
 you can see the rotor blades are here 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:13.069
 this xl two individually attached and in the 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.720
 contrast to the fan has this 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:17.239
 rotor blades again in a frame 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:22.310
 the complete rom pulls out here and 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:25.310
 so everything moves so what I come to 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:27.970
 The fans still say that is each 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:30.410
 entry level model so the first version 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:34.579
 and the 1 is in the back of the case for 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:37.459
 the rather low number of apm as well as the 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:41.870
 low noise and in contrast 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:44.450
 this is a duck - two fans as well 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:49.959
 12 - two more powerful we have 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:53.680
 here for example also 1300 pm as well as a 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:56.510
 logo or an air supply amount of 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:59.750
 86.9 cubic meters of hours so already 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:02.359
 a bit more and also well suited though 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:06.769
 that was decidable at 16 7 what 

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:08.780
 very quiet indeed is the 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:10.489
 Packaging content is identical to 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.310
 all four versions 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:15.739
 if I'm not around now and me 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:18.200
 would say we look at us now 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:20.030
 like this fan in general 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:23.180
 that helps now connected 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:25.310
 like ripe in cable to molex adapter on 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:27.590
 the 12 volt rail is a separate one 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:28.280
 power supply and I start it all 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.130
 just times 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:33.250
 and this is where the fan starts 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:38.240
 yes to turn 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:39.980
 so now at 800 pm maximum speed 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.420
 I really can not do that first 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:44.150
 determine vibration 

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:46.430
 he walks very quietly from the fan 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:49.160
 At the moment the cameras are 40 cm apart 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:52.160
 as I hear from you there, nothing 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.910
 but I notice a very good one here 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.820
 annoy 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:57.050
 which gives me a positive surprise 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:59.210
 in any case a thumb 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:03.430
 high for this top performance even at 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:05.480
 this entry-level model of the series 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.160
 and yes I can stop that 

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:11.660
 maybe you can hear something 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:16.610
 but I do not believe him and go 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:18.080
 me the whole yes and I notice 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:20.030
 even if I keep the now 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.860
 Another good frostbite after 50 cm 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:26.840
 distance this to something further from the 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:28.640
 Camera away and yes that should now 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:30.170
 actually been 

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:32.210
 I thank you at this point 

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:33.920
 to watch again with her 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:34.490
 Comment rating and subscribe 

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.710
 looking forward 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:39.760
 yes you give the feedback to the 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:39.760
 climax home 

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:53.669
