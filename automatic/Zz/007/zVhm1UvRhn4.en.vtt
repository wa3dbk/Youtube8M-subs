we are going to talk about backing up
hard<00:00:16.350> drives<00:00:16.680> and<00:00:17.060> for<00:00:18.060> this<00:00:18.380> demonstration

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
hard drives and for this demonstration

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:20.840 
hard drives and for this demonstration
we're<00:00:20.010> going<00:00:20.189> to<00:00:20.250> use<00:00:20.369> a<00:00:20.400> program<00:00:20.699> called

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
we're going to use a program called

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.349 
we're going to use a program called
norton<00:00:21.420> ghost<00:00:21.449> 9<00:00:22.170> is<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:23.250> best<00:00:23.580> program<00:00:24.240> you

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
norton ghost 9 is the best program you

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.480 
norton ghost 9 is the best program you
can<00:00:24.510> get<00:00:24.779> to<00:00:25.289> do<00:00:25.439> this<00:00:25.590> sort<00:00:25.830> of<00:00:25.949> thing<00:00:26.010> and

can get to do this sort of thing and

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.820 
can get to do this sort of thing and
we're<00:00:27.300> going<00:00:27.330> to<00:00:27.480> do<00:00:27.630> a<00:00:27.660> simple<00:00:28.410> kind<00:00:28.740> of

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
we're going to do a simple kind of

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.429 
we're going to do a simple kind of
backup<00:00:29.039> like<00:00:29.939> you<00:00:30.420> can<00:00:30.599> restore<00:00:30.810> files<00:00:31.230> in

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
backup like you can restore files in

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:32.749 
backup like you can restore files in
folder<00:00:31.800> which<00:00:31.949> means<00:00:32.219> you<00:00:32.369> can<00:00:32.520> backup

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
folder which means you can backup

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.350 
folder which means you can backup
individual<00:00:33.540> files<00:00:33.930> or<00:00:34.200> folders<00:00:34.640> but<00:00:35.640> in<00:00:36.210> this

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
individual files or folders but in this

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.930 
individual files or folders but in this
case<00:00:36.770> we're<00:00:37.770> going<00:00:37.920> to<00:00:37.980> do<00:00:38.100> an<00:00:38.190> entire<00:00:38.460> back<00:00:38.760> up

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
case we're going to do an entire back up

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.030 
case we're going to do an entire back up
we're<00:00:39.059> going<00:00:39.180> to<00:00:39.270> take<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.690> entire<00:00:39.989> c<00:00:40.739> drive

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
we're going to take the entire c drive

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.569 
we're going to take the entire c drive
with<00:00:41.309> windows<00:00:41.579> XP<00:00:41.910> is<00:00:42.800> reciting<00:00:43.800> it<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:44.370> we're

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
with windows XP is reciting it and we're

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.639 
with windows XP is reciting it and we're
going<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.789> back<00:00:45.450> it<00:00:45.690> up<00:00:45.809> in<00:00:46.050> case<00:00:46.260> i<00:00:46.440> get<00:00:46.500> a

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
going to back it up in case i get a

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.889 
going to back it up in case i get a
virus<00:00:46.980> or<00:00:47.280> something<00:00:47.579> in<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.910> future<00:00:48.120> i<00:00:48.539> can

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
virus or something in the future i can

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.690 
virus or something in the future i can
always<00:00:49.050> take<00:00:49.379> that<00:00:49.649> back<00:00:49.920> up<00:00:50.160> that<00:00:50.309> i<00:00:50.399> did<00:00:50.610> in

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
always take that back up that i did in

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.760 
always take that back up that i did in
the<00:00:50.820> past<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:51.360> restore<00:00:52.199> it<00:00:52.230> back<00:00:52.500> so

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
the past and restore it back so

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.330 
the past and restore it back so
basically<00:00:53.250> you're<00:00:53.460> taking<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.829> picture<00:00:55.829> of<00:00:56.160> a

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
basically you're taking a picture of a

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.220 
basically you're taking a picture of a
point<00:00:56.670> in<00:00:56.789> time<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:57.180> computer<00:00:57.600> worked<00:00:57.809> fine

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
point in time the computer worked fine

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.990 
point in time the computer worked fine
and<00:00:58.559> in<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.010> future<00:00:59.160> if<00:00:59.399> it<00:00:59.460> stops<00:00:59.760> working

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
and in the future if it stops working

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.819 
and in the future if it stops working
you<00:01:00.480> can<00:01:00.629> always<00:01:00.870> take<00:01:01.230> that<00:01:01.469> picture<00:01:01.710> and

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
you can always take that picture and

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.939 
you can always take that picture and
restore<00:01:02.340> it<00:01:02.370> back<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:02.969> it'll<00:01:03.300> be<00:01:03.539> fine<00:01:03.780> again

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:03.949 
restore it back and it'll be fine again

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:09.440 
restore it back and it'll be fine again

drive but that's okay

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.010

so<00:02:14.069> I<00:02:14.099> already<00:02:14.190> made<00:02:14.580> a<00:02:14.610> backup<00:02:14.879> in<00:02:15.150> a<00:02:15.450> while

so I already made a backup in a while

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.949 
so I already made a backup in a while
ago<00:02:16.440> and<00:02:16.650> I'm<00:02:17.069> okay<00:02:17.430> so<00:02:17.489> let's<00:02:18.090> pretend<00:02:18.480> when

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
ago and I'm okay so let's pretend when

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:20.690

you<00:02:19.110> do<00:02:19.260> this<00:02:19.440> if<00:02:19.680> you<00:02:19.800> have<00:02:19.920> enough<00:02:20.190> space<00:02:20.459> on

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
you do this if you have enough space on

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.150 
you do this if you have enough space on
the<00:02:20.879> destination<00:02:21.300> drive<00:02:22.050> this<00:02:22.739> will<00:02:22.980> not

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
the destination drive this will not

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.550 
the destination drive this will not
appear<00:02:23.550> and<00:02:23.790> if<00:02:23.879> it<00:02:24.030> appears<00:02:24.480> it<00:02:24.810> means<00:02:25.349> you

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
appear and if it appears it means you

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.860 
appear and if it appears it means you
need<00:02:25.680> to<00:02:25.739> erase<00:02:26.310> some<00:02:26.580> stuff<00:02:26.610> on<00:02:27.090> that<00:02:27.120> hard
