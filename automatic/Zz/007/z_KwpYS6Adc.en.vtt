00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.520 
you guys to see my range too much so
we're<00:00:36.629> going<00:00:36.720> to<00:00:36.809> go<00:00:36.840> ahead<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.080> minimize

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
we're going to go ahead and minimize

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.540 
we're going to go ahead and minimize
that<00:00:37.890> but<00:00:38.699> um<00:00:39.530> decks<00:00:40.530> or<00:00:40.800> luck<00:00:41.070> or<00:00:41.100> strength

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
that but um decks or luck or strength

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.850 
that but um decks or luck or strength
any<00:00:41.850> stat<00:00:42.360> could<00:00:42.659> now<00:00:42.870> go<00:00:42.930> above<00:00:43.760> 999<00:00:44.760> max<00:00:45.180> and

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:45.860 
any stat could now go above 999 max and

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.780 
any stat could now go above 999 max and
it's<00:00:46.860> really<00:00:47.070> cool<00:00:47.309> that<00:00:47.370> they<00:00:47.580> did<00:00:47.760> that

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:47.790 
it's really cool that they did that

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.390 
it's really cool that they did that
because<00:00:48.120> you<00:00:48.479> know<00:00:48.510> since<00:00:49.019> level<00:00:49.650> 200<00:00:50.159> is<00:00:50.280> no

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:50.400 
because you know since level 200 is no

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.280 
because you know since level 200 is no
longer<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.790> max<00:00:50.970> level<00:00:51.180> you<00:00:51.839> know<00:00:51.960> they

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:52.290 
longer the max level you know they

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.560 
longer the max level you know they
finally<00:00:52.739> decided<00:00:53.070> that<00:00:53.339> since<00:00:54.150> that's<00:00:54.420> no

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
finally decided that since that's no

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.899 
finally decided that since that's no
longer<00:00:54.720> the<00:00:54.900> max<00:00:55.080> level<00:00:55.580> 999<00:00:56.580> should<00:00:56.790> no

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:56.909 
longer the max level 999 should no

00:00:56.909 --> 00:01:00.350 
longer the max level 999 should no
longer<00:00:56.940> be<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.300> max<00:00:57.570> level<00:00:57.750> of<00:00:58.050> 9<00:00:59.180> it<00:01:00.180> would

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:00.360 
longer be the max level of 9 it would

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.869 
longer be the max level of 9 it would
have<00:01:00.479> what<00:01:00.920> max<00:01:01.920> that<00:01:02.159> should<00:01:02.460> no<00:01:02.549> longer<00:01:02.580> be

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
have what max that should no longer be

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.060 
have what max that should no longer be
you<00:01:03.269> know<00:01:03.390> captain<00:01:04.290> 999<00:01:05.780> so<00:01:06.780> I'm<00:01:07.650> going<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:07.979> go

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:46.240 
your eye out for them but a bad thing

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.360 
your eye out for them but a bad thing
about<00:02:46.330> them<00:02:46.600> is<00:02:46.720> you<00:02:46.780> can<00:02:47.050> only<00:02:47.110> use<00:02:47.260> one<00:02:47.410> every

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
about them is you can only use one every

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:49.890 
about them is you can only use one every
like<00:02:48.550> 15<00:02:49.060> minutes<00:02:49.270> or<00:02:49.450> something<00:02:49.570> like<00:02:49.840> that

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
like 15 minutes or something like that

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.590 
like 15 minutes or something like that
let's<00:02:50.260> see<00:02:50.350> if<00:02:50.440> it<00:02:50.560> says<00:02:50.830> the<00:02:50.980> exact<00:02:51.220> time

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
let's see if it says the exact time

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.670 
let's see if it says the exact time
doesn't<00:02:52.600> say<00:02:52.690> the<00:02:52.810> exact<00:02:53.110> time<00:02:53.290> but<00:02:53.320> I<00:02:53.470> believe

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
doesn't say the exact time but I believe

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.500 
doesn't say the exact time but I believe
you<00:02:53.800> can<00:02:53.890> only<00:02:54.040> use<00:02:54.190> one<00:02:54.220> per<00:02:54.610> 15<00:02:54.970> minutes<00:02:55.270> and

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
you can only use one per 15 minutes and

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.660 
you can only use one per 15 minutes and
they<00:02:55.660> only<00:02:55.810> last<00:02:56.050> about<00:02:56.200> a<00:02:56.320> minute<00:02:56.680> so<00:02:56.980> you

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
they only last about a minute so you

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.900 
they only last about a minute so you
know<00:02:57.760> it's<00:02:57.970> a<00:02:58.030> quick<00:02:58.270> short<00:02:58.540> burst<00:02:58.900> of<00:02:59.910> you

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
know it's a quick short burst of you

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.260

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
through intervals of 15 minutes and so

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:08.490
