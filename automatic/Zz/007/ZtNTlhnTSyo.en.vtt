00:00:03.129 --> 00:00:06.609
 but first of all what is it that 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:08.050
 this story anthony morel anthony 

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:09.160
 morel has in his hands and I describe it 

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:10.840
 for you ladies gentlemen a watch 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.110
 connected to the bo connected watch 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:17.199
 again it is made by crossroads 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:19.000
 they beat shattered and apple they have 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:23.259
 beaten at the apple post here's a crossroads 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.609
 the crossroads where is our case where this 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:26.439
 thing there it's not them who makes it 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:28.029
 obviously but finally there is there they 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:29.499
 have it manufactured it markets this 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:30.640
 so shows who's called then they 

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:32.680
 have they not brand and crossroads 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.000
 he takes some peak watches called that 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.320
 and so it's a shame reconnect 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.790
 then like that of samsø you can 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.220
 do you can take pictures 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.710
 you can read your sms on the screen the 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.240
 watch on TV you can you 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.220
 can even make calls also a 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.690
 play pressed here you have you go the 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.540
 small screen with them with the numbers and 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.490
 you will be able to support and have passed 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.500
 went up close by a sim card in 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:55.450
 this gold trunk knows exactly that's 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.670
 that the specificity is that in fact that 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.600
 it is autonomous and that was because 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.740
 that good every time I talked about 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.600
 connected watches saying yeah but 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.950
 it must connect to a smartphone that 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.809
 breaks and a little james bond effect so 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:06.070
 you want and here we have a real 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:07.600
 shows the james bond that is to say 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.859
 can put a sim card in it and we 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.840
 can use it as a real 

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:12.159
 cell phone but what is 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.569
 it's that story but it's a 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:15.219
 crazy thing but yeah that's very 

00:01:13.569 --> 00:01:17.069
 crossroads and its shopping crossroads serious 

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:19.270
 not come no but it's very personal 

00:01:17.069 --> 00:01:21.549
 that same name but I have a very small 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.649
 also stéphane cuffs it's still 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:24.639
 a phone has to work it is 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:25.630
 a little say she's thick she's 

00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:27.219
 a little thicker than the watch 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.090
 samsung you know when I started to 

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:29.409
 to work on the world I was a little 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.909
 part with the priori I had said good 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:32.530
 go this is the samsung of the poor at wholesale 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:33.579
 and in fact not at all interesting 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.200
 because they respond to weaknesses 

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:36.310
 watches that exists on the market 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.789
 today ie it is 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.889
 autonomous 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:40.899
 she is autonomous she works with 

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:41.889
 all cell phones when we 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:43.539
 wants to connect her to her phone 

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:44.920
 portable while the weakness of the 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:47.020
 Samsung watch today is that it 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.700
 must have the latest samsung that costs 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.049
 700 euros apple she connects them 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.609
 same to iphone she connects to 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:52.990
 iphone and connects to iphone os 

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:54.260
 watch android at all every 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.710
 smartphones 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:59.060
 crazy crossroads ladies gentlemen 7:04 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.620
 and more must be at the price 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.780
 crossroads gb exactly and that's two 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:08.210
 times cheaper c 130 euros 130 euros 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.479
 marie coeurderoy wants to know my 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.479
