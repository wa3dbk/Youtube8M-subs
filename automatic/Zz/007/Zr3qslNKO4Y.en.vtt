have to check which is the possible

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.920 
have to check which is the possible
highest<00:01:10.260> map<00:01:10.799> that<00:01:11.070> has<00:01:11.340> speed<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.720> best

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
highest map that has speed and the best

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.960 
highest map that has speed and the best
way<00:01:13.110> to<00:01:13.170> compare<00:01:13.650> those<00:01:13.830> two<00:01:14.100> is<00:01:14.340> to<00:01:14.580> go<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:14.790> the

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
way to compare those two is to go to the

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.060 
way to compare those two is to go to the
market<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:15.479> compare<00:01:16.020> which<00:01:16.259> speed<00:01:16.619> is<00:01:16.799> higher

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
market and compare which speed is higher

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.999 
market and compare which speed is higher
than<00:01:17.520> your<00:01:18.090> mat<00:01:18.390> that<00:01:18.750> you<00:01:18.780> have<00:01:19.080> right<00:01:19.290> now<00:01:19.320> so

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
than your mat that you have right now so

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.070 
than your mat that you have right now so
if<00:01:20.520> you<00:01:20.700> want<00:01:20.729> more<00:01:21.030> speed<00:01:21.330> you<00:01:21.360> always<00:01:21.930> have

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
if you want more speed you always have

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.960 
if you want more speed you always have
to<00:01:22.229> check<00:01:22.470> which<00:01:22.680> matte<00:01:22.920> is<00:01:23.130> available<00:01:23.759> for

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
to check which matte is available for

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.179 
to check which matte is available for
you<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.570> actually<00:01:24.930> put<00:01:25.409> on<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.799> weapon

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
you to actually put on the weapon

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.950 
you to actually put on the weapon
because<00:01:26.580> you<00:01:26.700> can't<00:01:26.909> just<00:01:27.060> put<00:01:27.150> all<00:01:27.450> your<00:01:27.630> crap

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
weapon and you know you can't do that

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.050 
weapon and you know you can't do that
because<00:01:31.890> you<00:01:32.189> got<00:01:32.310> to<00:01:32.490> really<00:01:32.729> look<00:01:32.909> at<00:01:33.030> your

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
because you got to really look at your

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.630 
because you got to really look at your

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
stats I really like this new crafting

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.630 
stats I really like this new crafting
system<00:01:35.790> it<00:01:36.360> gives<00:01:36.630> you<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:36.840> better<00:01:37.170> opportunity

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
system it gives you a better opportunity

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.760 
system it gives you a better opportunity
to<00:01:38.659> replace<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.930> mats<00:01:40.170> if<00:01:40.470> you<00:01:40.590> have

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
to replace the mats if you have

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.639 
to replace the mats if you have
something<00:01:41.070> better<00:01:41.400> so<00:01:42.210> for<00:01:42.479> example<00:01:42.990> if<00:01:43.170> you

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
something better so for example if you

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.859 
something better so for example if you
have<00:01:43.829> a<00:01:43.860> purple<00:01:44.460> weapon<00:01:44.909> and<00:01:45.090> you<00:01:45.570> want<00:01:45.750> to

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
have a purple weapon and you want to

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.380 
have a purple weapon and you want to
