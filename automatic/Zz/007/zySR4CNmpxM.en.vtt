you know I would be able to look back
years<00:02:03.370> from<00:02:03.520> now<00:02:03.670> and<00:02:04.030> say<00:02:04.150> I<00:02:04.540> tried

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
years from now and say I tried

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:06.540 
years from now and say I tried
everything<00:02:05.409> I<00:02:05.590> could<00:02:05.650> it<00:02:05.980> just<00:02:06.159> wasn't<00:02:06.490> meant

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:06.550 
everything I could it just wasn't meant

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.190 
everything I could it just wasn't meant
to<00:02:06.640> be<00:02:06.730> and<00:02:07.390> that<00:02:07.420> was<00:02:07.630> kind<00:02:07.900> of<00:02:07.930> the<00:02:08.050> driving

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
to be and that was kind of the driving

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.510 
to be and that was kind of the driving
factor<00:02:08.920> in

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
factor in

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.460 
factor in
in<00:02:09.580> making<00:02:09.820> the<00:02:10.090> change<00:02:10.390> and<00:02:10.660> this<00:02:10.990> was<00:02:11.200> just

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
in making the change and this was just

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.050 
in making the change and this was just
an<00:02:11.590> instance<00:02:11.950> where<00:02:12.220> we<00:02:12.550> turned<00:02:12.790> a<00:02:12.910> negative

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
an instance where we turned a negative

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.170
