connector<00:03:15.120> thing<00:03:15.620> that'll<00:03:16.620> secular<00:03:17.130> thing<00:03:17.400> on

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
connector thing that'll secular thing on

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.120 
connector thing that'll secular thing on
where<00:03:18.540> the<00:03:18.630> circular<00:03:19.080> thing<00:03:19.290> is<00:03:19.470> up<00:03:19.739> against

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
where the circular thing is up against

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.310 
where the circular thing is up against
that<00:03:20.280> cylinder<00:03:21.060> it'll<00:03:21.300> be<00:03:21.450> tilted<00:03:22.019> just<00:03:22.200> a

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
that cylinder it'll be tilted just a

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.860 
that cylinder it'll be tilted just a
little<00:03:22.590> but<00:03:23.190> that's<00:03:23.400> fine<00:03:23.700> so<00:03:24.480> it<00:03:24.540> should<00:03:24.720> look

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
little but that's fine so it should look

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.470

like<00:03:24.930> this<00:03:25.260> right<00:03:25.500> now<00:03:25.650> and<00:03:25.910> then<00:03:26.910> you<00:03:27.030> put<00:03:27.209> two

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
like this right now and then you put two

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.070 
like this right now and then you put two
antennas<00:03:27.630> on<00:03:29.030> sides<00:03:30.030> of<00:03:30.209> that<00:03:30.239> bottom<00:03:30.810> and<00:03:30.959> you

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
antennas on sides of that bottom and you

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:39.640 
antennas on sides of that bottom and you
face<00:03:31.320> them<00:03:31.560> inward<00:03:32.190> light<00:03:32.820> hold<00:03:33.269> on<00:03:36.080> like<00:03:37.080> this
