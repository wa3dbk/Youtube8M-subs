hi there and welcome back to another how
2<00:00:03.830> episode<00:00:04.830> today<00:00:05.759> we're<00:00:06.690> using<00:00:07.140> engineering

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
2 episode today we're using engineering

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.169 
2 episode today we're using engineering
tool<00:00:08.220> box<00:00:08.550> again<00:00:09.530> because<00:00:10.700> you<00:00:11.700> all<00:00:11.849> seem<00:00:12.150> to

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
tool box again because you all seem to

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.099 
tool box again because you all seem to
like<00:00:12.509> when<00:00:12.960> I<00:00:12.990> do<00:00:13.230> that<00:00:13.469> oh<00:00:13.710> great<00:00:14.070> it's<00:00:14.250> rainy

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:15.109 
like when I do that oh great it's rainy

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:17.660 
like when I do that oh great it's rainy
let<00:00:16.109> me<00:00:16.170> just<00:00:16.320> turn<00:00:16.529> off<00:00:16.590> the<00:00:16.710> rain<00:00:17.010> there<00:00:17.250> for

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
let me just turn off the rain there for

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.080 
let me just turn off the rain there for
a<00:00:17.699> minute<00:00:18.859> so<00:00:19.859> today<00:00:20.430> we're<00:00:20.699> going<00:00:20.850> to<00:00:20.939> be

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
a minute so today we're going to be

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.599 
a minute so today we're going to be
doing<00:00:21.539> another<00:00:21.960> power<00:00:22.410> generation<00:00:22.949> this<00:00:23.369> time

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
doing another power generation this time

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:29.179 
doing another power generation this time
using<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:24.359> hydro<00:00:26.330> electric<00:00:27.330> turbines<00:00:28.189> now

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
using the hydro electric turbines now

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.470 
using the hydro electric turbines now
the<00:00:29.250> first<00:00:29.519> thing<00:00:29.670> you<00:00:29.910> need<00:00:30.029> to<00:00:30.090> know<00:00:30.179> when

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
the first thing you need to know when

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.240 
the first thing you need to know when
you're<00:00:30.630> using<00:00:30.750> these<00:00:30.990> is<00:00:31.260> they<00:00:31.439> have<00:00:31.650> to<00:00:31.830> be<00:00:31.980> in

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
you're using these is they have to be in

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.680 
you're using these is they have to be in
a<00:00:33.290> river<00:00:34.290> biome<00:00:34.800> so<00:00:35.070> if<00:00:35.370> you<00:00:35.489> hook<00:00:35.700> up<00:00:35.940> f3<00:00:36.480> there

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
a river biome so if you hook up f3 there

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.750 
a river biome so if you hook up f3 there
you<00:00:36.899> can<00:00:37.050> see<00:00:37.079> that<00:00:37.500> I<00:00:37.530> have<00:00:37.620> a<00:00:37.770> river<00:00:38.040> biol

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
you can see that I have a river biol

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.869 
you can see that I have a river biol
just<00:00:39.510> here<00:00:39.809> across<00:00:40.110> here<00:00:40.500> so<00:00:41.399> we're<00:00:41.610> going<00:00:41.730> to

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
just here across here so we're going to

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.910 
just here across here so we're going to
push<00:00:42.329> ourselves<00:00:43.910> I'm<00:00:45.050> some<00:00:46.050> hydroelectric

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
push ourselves I'm some hydroelectric

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.940 
push ourselves I'm some hydroelectric
generators<00:00:47.460> here<00:00:47.760> so<00:00:48.629> it's<00:00:49.020> very<00:00:49.379> simple<00:00:49.680> all

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
generators here so it's very simple all

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.100 
generators here so it's very simple all
you<00:00:50.010> really<00:00:50.340> need<00:00:50.610> is<00:00:50.640> some<00:00:51.149> modular<00:00:51.629> sockets

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
you really need is some modular sockets

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.319 
you really need is some modular sockets
which<00:00:53.070> we've<00:00:53.309> gone<00:00:53.520> through<00:00:53.760> before<00:00:53.910> how<00:00:54.270> to

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
which we've gone through before how to

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.029 
which we've gone through before how to
build<00:00:54.629> they're<00:00:54.930> fairly<00:00:55.230> easy<00:00:55.469> to<00:00:55.590> build<00:00:55.829> and

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
build they're fairly easy to build and

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.979 
build they're fairly easy to build and
you<00:00:56.670> can<00:00:56.789> build<00:00:56.969> a<00:00:57.059> coupler<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:57.510> then<00:00:57.870> you

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
you can build a coupler and then you

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.229 
you can build a coupler and then you
need<00:00:58.170> hydro<00:00:58.739> electric<00:00:59.309> turbines<00:01:00.410> which<00:01:01.410> are

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
need hydro electric turbines which are

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:06.320 
need hydro electric turbines which are
we<00:01:03.239> get<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.570> recipe<00:01:03.899> up<00:01:04.850> weighted<00:01:05.850> pressure

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
we get the recipe up weighted pressure

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.899 
we get the recipe up weighted pressure
plates<00:01:06.750> heavy<00:01:07.970> iron<00:01:08.970> basically<00:01:10.340> and<00:01:11.340> some

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
plates heavy iron basically and some

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.950 
plates heavy iron basically and some
psu's<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:12.960> an<00:01:13.680> energy<00:01:14.189> input<00:01:14.600> and<00:01:15.600> then<00:01:15.810> of

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
psu's and an energy input and then of

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.330 
psu's and an energy input and then of
course<00:01:15.990> if<00:01:16.290> you<00:01:16.380> want<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.650> get<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.890> energy<00:01:17.250> out

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
course if you want to get the energy out

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.490 
course if you want to get the energy out
of<00:01:17.369> these<00:01:17.580> things<00:01:17.820> we'll<00:01:18.060> need<00:01:18.210> some<00:01:18.540> energy

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
of these things we'll need some energy

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.120 
of these things we'll need some energy
outputs<00:01:20.509> so<00:01:21.509> as<00:01:21.840> I<00:01:22.200> said<00:01:22.259> they're<00:01:22.799> very<00:01:23.040> easy

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
outputs so as I said they're very easy

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.359 
outputs so as I said they're very easy
to<00:01:23.400> make<00:01:23.880> you<00:01:24.509> just<00:01:24.720> stick<00:01:25.229> it<00:01:25.380> on<00:01:25.530> one<00:01:26.340> side

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
to make you just stick it on one side

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.520 
to make you just stick it on one side
the<00:01:27.210> side<00:01:27.420> you<00:01:27.600> stick<00:01:27.840> it<00:01:27.930> on<00:01:28.049> does<00:01:28.290> need<00:01:28.500> a

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
the side you stick it on does need a

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.890 
the side you stick it on does need a
spoiler<00:01:28.979> saw<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.340> water<00:01:29.759> source<00:01:30.180> block<00:01:30.509> beside

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
spoiler saw a water source block beside

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.100 
spoiler saw a water source block beside
it<00:01:31.079> so<00:01:31.320> make<00:01:31.500> sure<00:01:31.560> you<00:01:31.829> have<00:01:31.979> that<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:33.110> then

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
it so make sure you have that and then

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.710 
it so make sure you have that and then
if<00:01:34.320> we<00:01:34.530> have<00:01:34.770> an<00:01:35.070> output<00:01:35.549> if<00:01:35.880> we<00:01:36.450> want<00:01:36.659> to

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
if we have an output if we want to

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:45.310 
if we have an output if we want to
output<00:01:36.960> this<00:01:37.350> so<00:01:38.250> let's<00:01:39.619> pick<00:01:40.619> this<00:01:40.680> up<00:01:40.890> and

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.910 

we'll<00:01:46.320> just<00:01:46.530> put<00:01:47.310> it<00:01:47.430> down<00:01:47.460> here

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
we'll just put it down here

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.670 
we'll just put it down here
and<00:01:49.009> you<00:01:50.000> can<00:01:50.150> see<00:01:50.360> that<00:01:50.390> it's<00:01:50.810> charging<00:01:51.229> up<00:01:51.500> an

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
and you can see that it's charging up an

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.190 
and you can see that it's charging up an
or<00:01:51.890> F<00:01:52.040> which<00:01:52.790> is<00:01:52.939> cool<00:01:53.150> so<00:01:53.810> let's<00:01:53.990> get

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
or F which is cool so let's get

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.130 
or F which is cool so let's get
ourselves<00:01:54.320> an<00:01:54.799> energy<00:01:55.250> cell<00:01:55.490> and<00:01:56.140> possibly

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
ourselves an energy cell and possibly

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.320 
ourselves an energy cell and possibly
some<00:01:57.409> conduits<00:01:58.070> and<00:01:58.310> if<00:01:58.640> we<00:01:58.759> put<00:01:58.970> this<00:01:59.119> down

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 
some conduits and if we put this down

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.010 
some conduits and if we put this down
here<00:01:59.750> and<00:02:01.119> make<00:02:02.119> sure<00:02:02.149> that<00:02:02.360> it's<00:02:02.689> set<00:02:02.899> the

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
here and make sure that it's set the

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.090 
here and make sure that it's set the
input<00:02:03.909> you'll<00:02:04.909> see<00:02:05.500> that<00:02:06.500> it's<00:02:06.680> starting<00:02:06.979> to

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
input you'll see that it's starting to

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.029 
input you'll see that it's starting to
charge<00:02:07.310> up<00:02:07.549> the<00:02:07.670> energy<00:02:08.000> cell<00:02:08.209> but<00:02:08.899> again<00:02:09.500> it's

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
charge up the energy cell but again it's

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.910 
charge up the energy cell but again it's
not<00:02:10.250> that<00:02:10.520> fast<00:02:10.959> we<00:02:11.959> kind<00:02:12.260> of<00:02:12.350> want<00:02:12.530> more<00:02:12.800> than

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
not that fast we kind of want more than

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:21.520 
not that fast we kind of want more than
that<00:02:12.980> so<00:02:13.489> let's<00:02:13.730> go<00:02:13.970> a<00:02:14.000> bit<00:02:14.209> crazy<00:02:18.760> so<00:02:20.380> what<00:02:21.380> we

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
that so let's go a bit crazy so what we

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.190 
that so let's go a bit crazy so what we
want<00:02:21.709> to<00:02:21.769> do<00:02:22.360> I'm<00:02:23.360> going<00:02:23.510> to<00:02:23.690> do<00:02:23.810> this<00:02:23.959> up<00:02:24.170> here

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
want to do I'm going to do this up here

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:31.059 
want to do I'm going to do this up here
is<00:02:25.510> we<00:02:26.510> want<00:02:26.720> to<00:02:26.810> get<00:02:26.959> some<00:02:27.430> energy<00:02:28.690> inputs<00:02:30.069> and

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069 
is we want to get some energy inputs and

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:33.030 
is we want to get some energy inputs and
we're<00:02:31.250> going<00:02:31.370> to<00:02:31.400> put<00:02:31.489> the<00:02:31.730> energy<00:02:31.910> inputs<00:02:32.480> on

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
we're going to put the energy inputs on

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:42.490 
we're going to put the energy inputs on
this<00:02:34.040> side<00:02:34.310> and<00:02:36.040> also<00:02:37.040> on<00:02:37.420> the<00:02:38.420> bottom<00:02:38.720> and<00:02:41.500> in

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
this side and also on the bottom and in

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.680 
this side and also on the bottom and in
fact<00:02:42.799> we're<00:02:43.280> going<00:02:43.400> to<00:02:43.459> put<00:02:43.640> one<00:02:43.910> on<00:02:44.180> the<00:02:44.510> back

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
fact we're going to put one on the back

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.020 
fact we're going to put one on the back
as<00:02:44.870> well<00:02:44.900> and<00:02:45.350> then<00:02:46.040> we're<00:02:46.190> going<00:02:46.280> to<00:02:46.340> get<00:02:46.730> our

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
as well and then we're going to get our

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.970 
as well and then we're going to get our
energy<00:02:47.209> outputs<00:02:47.840> and<00:02:48.110> we're<00:02:48.350> going<00:02:48.470> to<00:02:48.500> put

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
energy outputs and we're going to put

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.229 
energy outputs and we're going to put
this<00:02:49.280> direction<00:02:49.670> as<00:02:50.000> well<00:02:51.700> so<00:02:52.700> what<00:02:52.910> I<00:02:52.940> want<00:02:53.180> to

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
this direction as well so what I want to

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:55.090 
this direction as well so what I want to
do<00:02:53.420> is<00:02:53.690> I<00:02:53.810> want<00:02:53.840> to<00:02:54.109> get<00:02:54.230> loads<00:02:54.560> of<00:02:54.739> them<00:02:54.890> like

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
do is I want to get loads of them like

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.199 
do is I want to get loads of them like
this<00:02:55.340> am<00:02:55.730> and<00:02:56.540> just<00:02:57.370> put<00:02:58.370> them<00:02:58.549> along<00:02:58.850> in<00:02:59.120> a

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
this am and just put them along in a

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:03.160 
this am and just put them along in a
line<00:02:59.480> in<00:02:59.900> the<00:03:00.109> river<00:03:00.320> so<00:03:01.160> the<00:03:01.489> output<00:03:02.390> will

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
line in the river so the output will

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.710 
line in the river so the output will
come<00:03:03.380> out<00:03:03.560> this<00:03:03.769> side<00:03:04.040> and<00:03:04.609> then<00:03:04.910> in<00:03:05.209> this<00:03:05.450> side

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
come out this side and then in this side

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.650 
come out this side and then in this side
of<00:03:05.989> the<00:03:06.140> one<00:03:06.290> next<00:03:06.530> to<00:03:06.680> it<00:03:06.799> so<00:03:07.730> in<00:03:08.000> a<00:03:08.030> sense<00:03:08.150> they

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
of the one next to it so in a sense they

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.099 
of the one next to it so in a sense they
all<00:03:08.780> get<00:03:08.989> chained<00:03:09.380> up<00:03:09.620> together<00:03:09.859> so<00:03:11.109> let's

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:12.109 
all get chained up together so let's

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:21.490 
all get chained up together so let's
grab<00:03:12.769> this<00:03:12.920> and<00:03:13.190> put<00:03:13.640> this<00:03:13.670> back<00:03:14.120> down<00:03:20.290> so<00:03:21.290> this

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
grab this and put this back down so this

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.520 
grab this and put this back down so this
is<00:03:21.530> now<00:03:21.859> charging<00:03:22.370> up<00:03:22.640> and<00:03:22.850> RF<00:03:23.150> and<00:03:23.570> if<00:03:24.200> we<00:03:24.350> get

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
is now charging up and RF and if we get

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.960 
is now charging up and RF and if we get
ourselves<00:03:26.470> and<00:03:27.470> I<00:03:27.739> here's<00:03:28.100> some<00:03:28.370> I<00:03:28.579> made<00:03:28.790> it

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
ourselves and I here's some I made it

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.910 
ourselves and I here's some I made it
earlier<00:03:31.600> I've<00:03:32.600> made<00:03:32.840> two<00:03:33.410> different<00:03:33.769> ones

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
earlier I've made two different ones

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.069 
earlier I've made two different ones
here<00:03:34.160> and<00:03:35.150> I<00:03:35.239> just<00:03:35.269> want<00:03:35.600> to<00:03:35.690> change<00:03:35.900> the

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:36.079 
here and I just want to change the

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:37.390 
here and I just want to change the
creative<00:03:36.410> mode<00:03:36.560> you'll<00:03:36.829> obviously<00:03:36.950> have<00:03:37.280> to

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
creative mode you'll obviously have to

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.830 
creative mode you'll obviously have to
do<00:03:37.519> this<00:03:37.640> yourself<00:03:38.090> I<00:03:38.359> have<00:03:39.290> one<00:03:40.660> for<00:03:41.660> this

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
do this yourself I have one for this

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.960 
do this yourself I have one for this
side<00:03:42.109> which<00:03:42.590> is<00:03:42.620> the<00:03:43.040> right<00:03:43.220> hand<00:03:43.459> side<00:03:43.579> this

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
side which is the right hand side this

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.000 
side which is the right hand side this
one<00:03:44.209> and<00:03:44.390> then<00:03:44.930> I'm<00:03:45.230> also<00:03:45.440> going<00:03:45.709> to<00:03:45.799> put<00:03:45.980> one

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
one and then I'm also going to put one

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.080 
one and then I'm also going to put one
down<00:03:46.420> behind<00:03:47.420> it<00:03:47.930> like<00:03:48.170> this<00:03:49.040> to<00:03:49.730> get<00:03:49.880> the

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
down behind it like this to get the

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:51.819 
down behind it like this to get the
other<00:03:50.239> side<00:03:50.569> of<00:03:50.600> the<00:03:50.750> river<00:03:50.959> and<00:03:51.230> this<00:03:51.709> is

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:51.829 
other side of the river and this is

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:54.670 
other side of the river and this is
going<00:03:52.040> to<00:03:52.130> output<00:03:52.459> on<00:03:53.000> that<00:03:53.840> side<00:03:54.079> into<00:03:54.530> this

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
going to output on that side into this

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.070 
going to output on that side into this
side<00:03:54.950> so<00:03:55.160> in<00:03:55.579> a<00:03:55.670> sense<00:03:55.880> they<00:03:56.180> will<00:03:56.329> all<00:03:56.510> come<00:03:56.780> to

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:57.080 
side so in a sense they will all come to

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.700 
side so in a sense they will all come to
the<00:03:57.110> top<00:03:57.409> right-hand<00:03:58.099> one<00:03:58.580> here<00:03:58.940> so<00:03:59.810> let's

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:00.710 
the top right-hand one here so let's

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:05.110 
the top right-hand one here so let's
go<00:04:01.220> ahead<00:04:01.550> and<00:04:01.820> just<00:04:02.590> kind<00:04:03.590> of<00:04:03.680> make<00:04:04.310> it<00:04:04.550> this

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
go ahead and just kind of make it this

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:13.450 
go ahead and just kind of make it this
one<00:04:05.390> here<00:04:05.690> like<00:04:05.870> this<00:04:06.080> and<00:04:11.920> yeah<00:04:12.920> I<00:04:12.950> thought<00:04:13.310> as

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:13.460 
one here like this and yeah I thought as

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:19.870 
one here like this and yeah I thought as
much<00:04:13.490> the<00:04:16.450> no<00:04:17.450> no<00:04:17.810> it<00:04:18.260> should<00:04:18.440> be<00:04:18.470> okay<00:04:18.880> so

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
much the no no it should be okay so

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:29.020 
much the no no it should be okay so
let's<00:04:20.420> go<00:04:21.290> absolutely<00:04:22.250> crazy<00:04:22.750> and<00:04:27.760> yes<00:04:28.760> I<00:04:29.000> have

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
let's go absolutely crazy and yes I have

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.840 
let's go absolutely crazy and yes I have
to<00:04:29.180> shift<00:04:29.360> look<00:04:29.710> let's<00:04:30.710> completely<00:04:31.430> fill<00:04:31.700> up

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:31.850 
to shift look let's completely fill up

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:47.439 
to shift look let's completely fill up
this

00:04:47.439 --> 00:04:47.449 

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:50.200 

and<00:04:48.020> we<00:04:48.139> can<00:04:48.319> really<00:04:48.590> make<00:04:49.129> it<00:04:49.159> just<00:04:49.699> a<00:04:49.819> huge

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
and we can really make it just a huge

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:54.100 
and we can really make it just a huge
hydroelectric<00:04:51.050> power<00:04:51.650> plant<00:04:51.949> here<00:04:52.809> this<00:04:53.809> is

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110 
hydroelectric power plant here this is

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.579 
hydroelectric power plant here this is
going<00:04:54.770> to<00:04:54.830> be<00:04:54.979> pretty<00:04:55.219> big<00:04:56.229> but<00:04:57.229> it<00:04:57.349> should<00:04:57.559> be

00:04:57.579 --> 00:04:57.589 
going to be pretty big but it should be

00:04:57.589 --> 00:05:00.159 
going to be pretty big but it should be
able<00:04:57.770> to<00:04:58.039> generate<00:04:58.490> a<00:04:58.909> sufficiently<00:04:59.839> large

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:00.169 
able to generate a sufficiently large

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:06.129 
able to generate a sufficiently large
amount<00:05:00.800> of<00:05:00.949> energy<00:05:01.729> and<00:05:03.909> so<00:05:04.909> I<00:05:05.270> might<00:05:05.599> leave<00:05:05.990> it

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:06.139 
amount of energy and so I might leave it

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:09.249 
amount of energy and so I might leave it
at<00:05:06.229> just<00:05:06.559> one<00:05:06.860> layer<00:05:07.550> but<00:05:07.879> I'll<00:05:08.870> put<00:05:09.080> in<00:05:09.199> a

00:05:09.249 --> 00:05:09.259 
at just one layer but I'll put in a

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:11.350 
at just one layer but I'll put in a
couple<00:05:09.559> of<00:05:09.650> this<00:05:09.889> second<00:05:10.339> layer<00:05:10.460> that<00:05:11.120> one

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:11.360 
couple of this second layer that one

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:16.989 
couple of this second layer that one
won't<00:05:11.539> work<00:05:12.729> and<00:05:14.979> you<00:05:15.979> in<00:05:16.159> a<00:05:16.309> sense<00:05:16.339> get<00:05:16.849> what

00:05:16.989 --> 00:05:16.999 
won't work and you in a sense get what

00:05:16.999 --> 00:05:19.749 
won't work and you in a sense get what
I'm<00:05:17.120> doing<00:05:17.360> here<00:05:17.569> so<00:05:18.259> all<00:05:18.409> of<00:05:18.439> these<00:05:18.680> with<00:05:19.639> the

00:05:19.749 --> 00:05:19.759 
I'm doing here so all of these with the

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:22.499 
I'm doing here so all of these with the
energy<00:05:20.120> inputs<00:05:20.569> and<00:05:20.749> energy<00:05:21.139> but<00:05:21.469> should

00:05:22.499 --> 00:05:22.509 
energy inputs and energy but should

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:30.219 
energy inputs and energy but should
transfer<00:05:23.509> between<00:05:23.749> each<00:05:24.080> other<00:05:28.990> and<00:05:29.990> I'll

00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:30.229 
transfer between each other and I'll

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:33.429 
transfer between each other and I'll
show<00:05:30.469> you<00:05:30.499> just<00:05:31.449> put<00:05:32.449> one<00:05:32.629> more<00:05:32.839> on<00:05:33.110> the<00:05:33.139> other

00:05:33.429 --> 00:05:33.439 
show you just put one more on the other

00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:35.829 
show you just put one more on the other
side<00:05:33.740> to<00:05:34.009> show<00:05:34.189> you<00:05:34.249> what<00:05:34.520> would<00:05:35.240> happen<00:05:35.300> there

00:05:35.829 --> 00:05:35.839 
side to show you what would happen there

00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:38.829 
side to show you what would happen there
so<00:05:36.379> if<00:05:36.499> i<00:05:36.650> put<00:05:36.729> just<00:05:37.729> like<00:05:37.909> this<00:05:38.120> on<00:05:38.419> this<00:05:38.629> side

00:05:38.829 --> 00:05:38.839 
so if i put just like this on this side

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:42.869 
so if i put just like this on this side
so<00:05:38.870> the<00:05:39.139> hydro<00:05:39.499> is<00:05:39.740> on<00:05:40.039> there<00:05:40.389> on<00:05:41.389> this<00:05:41.810> side<00:05:42.080> so

00:05:42.869 --> 00:05:42.879 
so the hydro is on there on this side so

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:47.049 
so the hydro is on there on this side so
it<00:05:43.879> looks<00:05:44.089> in<00:05:44.539> a<00:05:44.810> sense<00:05:45.050> like<00:05:45.649> a<00:05:45.680> cool<00:05:46.069> hydro

00:05:47.049 --> 00:05:47.059 
it looks in a sense like a cool hydro

00:05:47.059 --> 00:05:50.980 
it looks in a sense like a cool hydro
plant<00:05:47.449> our<00:05:48.289> dam<00:05:48.770> which<00:05:49.699> looks<00:05:50.120> kind<00:05:50.689> of<00:05:50.779> cool

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:50.990 
plant our dam which looks kind of cool

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:53.559 
plant our dam which looks kind of cool
to<00:05:51.289> be<00:05:51.560> honest<00:05:51.860> so<00:05:52.490> let's<00:05:52.699> go<00:05:52.969> ahead<00:05:52.999> and<00:05:53.240> put

00:05:53.559 --> 00:05:53.569 
to be honest so let's go ahead and put

00:05:53.569 --> 00:05:58.600 
to be honest so let's go ahead and put
our<00:05:53.599> energy<00:05:53.930> cell<00:05:54.439> here<00:05:57.219> switching<00:05:58.219> back<00:05:58.399> to<00:05:58.430> a

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:58.610 
our energy cell here switching back to a

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:02.170 
our energy cell here switching back to a
survival<00:05:59.360> so<00:06:00.229> if<00:06:00.319> we<00:06:00.349> put<00:06:00.560> this<00:06:00.710> here<00:06:01.039> you<00:06:01.999> can

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:02.180 
survival so if we put this here you can

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:03.999 
survival so if we put this here you can
see<00:06:02.360> how<00:06:02.599> quickly<00:06:02.990> that's<00:06:03.319> going<00:06:03.649> up<00:06:03.740> that's

00:06:03.999 --> 00:06:04.009 
see how quickly that's going up that's

00:06:04.009 --> 00:06:06.459 
see how quickly that's going up that's
pretty<00:06:04.550> impressive<00:06:04.939> and<00:06:05.449> that<00:06:06.080> is<00:06:06.259> one

00:06:06.459 --> 00:06:06.469 
pretty impressive and that is one

00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:09.579 
pretty impressive and that is one
hundred<00:06:06.680> percent<00:06:06.919> free<00:06:07.370> energy<00:06:08.439> once<00:06:09.439> you

00:06:09.579 --> 00:06:09.589 
hundred percent free energy once you

00:06:09.589 --> 00:06:11.170 
hundred percent free energy once you
place<00:06:09.860> it<00:06:10.069> it<00:06:10.339> will<00:06:10.520> just<00:06:10.669> keep<00:06:10.879> generating

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:11.180 
place it it will just keep generating

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:13.689 
place it it will just keep generating
forever<00:06:12.050> and<00:06:12.349> you<00:06:12.949> can<00:06:13.099> just<00:06:13.249> keep<00:06:13.459> putting

00:06:13.689 --> 00:06:13.699 
forever and you can just keep putting

00:06:13.699 --> 00:06:17.559 
forever and you can just keep putting
them<00:06:13.999> a<00:06:14.300> whole<00:06:14.629> line<00:06:14.930> of<00:06:14.959> these<00:06:16.539> which<00:06:17.539> is

00:06:17.559 --> 00:06:17.569 
them a whole line of these which is

00:06:17.569 --> 00:06:20.040 
them a whole line of these which is
pretty<00:06:17.899> cool<00:06:18.169> so<00:06:18.649> there<00:06:18.800> is<00:06:18.830> just<00:06:19.159> a<00:06:19.279> quick

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:20.050 
pretty cool so there is just a quick

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:23.139 
pretty cool so there is just a quick
how-to<00:06:21.050> video<00:06:21.589> on<00:06:21.649> how<00:06:21.919> to<00:06:21.949> setup<00:06:22.339> yourself<00:06:22.879> a

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:23.149 
how-to video on how to setup yourself a

00:06:23.149 --> 00:06:27.159 
how-to video on how to setup yourself a
hydro<00:06:23.959> dam<00:06:24.529> to<00:06:25.339> provide<00:06:25.939> yourself<00:06:26.360> with<00:06:26.419> or<00:06:26.899> F

00:06:27.159 --> 00:06:27.169 
hydro dam to provide yourself with or F

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:30.790 
hydro dam to provide yourself with or F
power<00:06:27.819> which<00:06:28.819> is<00:06:29.029> kind<00:06:29.689> of<00:06:29.749> cool<00:06:29.810> and<00:06:30.139> that's

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:30.800 
power which is kind of cool and that's

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.529 
power which is kind of cool and that's
charging<00:06:31.310> really<00:06:31.639> fast<00:06:31.879> now<00:06:32.089> we<00:06:32.240> don't<00:06:32.360> even

00:06:32.529 --> 00:06:32.539 
charging really fast now we don't even

00:06:32.539 --> 00:06:34.329 
charging really fast now we don't even
have<00:06:32.719> all<00:06:32.839> those<00:06:33.110> then<00:06:33.349> it<00:06:33.740> would<00:06:33.919> take<00:06:34.159> you<00:06:34.310> a

00:06:34.329 --> 00:06:34.339 
have all those then it would take you a

00:06:34.339 --> 00:06:37.389 
have all those then it would take you a
while<00:06:34.550> to<00:06:34.610> make<00:06:34.969> these<00:06:35.209> all<00:06:35.389> but<00:06:36.110> you<00:06:36.770> probably

00:06:37.389 --> 00:06:37.399 
while to make these all but you probably

00:06:37.399 --> 00:06:39.670 
while to make these all but you probably
agree<00:06:37.550> that<00:06:37.939> it's<00:06:38.120> worth<00:06:38.330> it<00:06:38.539> in<00:06:38.659> the<00:06:38.689> end<00:06:38.779> so

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:39.680 
agree that it's worth it in the end so

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:42.040 
agree that it's worth it in the end so
thanks<00:06:40.639> for<00:06:40.729> watching<00:06:41.060> this<00:06:41.180> I<00:06:41.539> hope<00:06:41.899> you

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:42.050 
thanks for watching this I hope you

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:45.999 
thanks for watching this I hope you
enjoyed<00:06:42.469> it<00:06:42.649> and<00:06:42.889> I<00:06:42.949> will<00:06:43.490> see<00:06:43.879> you<00:06:43.909> later
