00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:28.509 
first scissor you saw and the beginning

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:33.360 
first scissor you saw and the beginning
of<00:00:28.570> my<00:00:28.689> dark<00:00:28.960> storm<00:00:29.289> combo<00:00:31.410> I<00:00:32.410> can't<00:00:33.160> think<00:00:33.220> of

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:33.370 
of my dark storm combo I can't think of

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:34.410 
of my dark storm combo I can't think of
anything<00:00:33.580> so<00:00:33.820> I'm<00:00:33.879> just<00:00:34.030> going<00:00:34.150> to<00:00:34.210> call<00:00:34.390> it

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:34.420 
anything so I'm just going to call it

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.860 
anything so I'm just going to call it
scissor<00:00:34.750> spinning<00:00:35.230> but<00:00:36.570> essentially<00:00:37.570> what

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:37.870 
scissor spinning but essentially what

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:39.540 
scissor spinning but essentially what
you<00:00:38.019> do<00:00:38.199> and<00:00:38.470> I'm<00:00:38.559> not<00:00:38.949> going<00:00:39.040> to<00:00:39.100> show<00:00:39.280> you<00:00:39.339> all

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:39.550 
you do and I'm not going to show you all

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.310 
you do and I'm not going to show you all
my<00:00:39.580> variance<00:00:40.239> that<00:00:40.360> I<00:00:40.480> have<00:00:40.720> to<00:00:40.930> it<00:00:41.050> i'm<00:00:41.199> going

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:41.320 
my variance that I have to it i'm going

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.470 
my variance that I have to it i'm going
to<00:00:41.410> show<00:00:41.589> you<00:00:41.760> what<00:00:42.760> I<00:00:42.790> initially<00:00:43.210> started

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:43.480 
to show you what I initially started

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.810 
to show you what I initially started
with<00:00:44.079> what<00:00:44.500> I<00:00:44.530> learned<00:00:44.829> on<00:00:45.010> and<00:00:45.250> then<00:00:45.400> you<00:00:45.699> know

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:45.820 
with what I learned on and then you know

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.460 
with what I learned on and then you know
you<00:00:45.879> can<00:00:46.180> come<00:00:46.360> up<00:00:46.480> with<00:00:46.629> your<00:00:46.750> variance<00:00:47.140> and

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:47.470 
you can come up with your variance and

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:49.380 
you can come up with your variance and
how<00:00:47.980> you<00:00:48.040> want<00:00:48.309> to<00:00:48.339> integrate<00:00:48.550> it<00:00:48.820> into<00:00:48.940> combos

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 
how you want to integrate it into combos

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:50.549 
how you want to integrate it into combos
from<00:00:49.570> there<00:00:49.719> because<00:00:49.899> it's<00:00:50.050> actually<00:00:50.170> really

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:50.559 
from there because it's actually really

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:53.130 
from there because it's actually really
Universal<00:00:51.100> trick<00:00:51.600> I'm<00:00:52.600> not<00:00:52.780> sure<00:00:52.930> if<00:00:53.050> you

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:53.140 
Universal trick I'm not sure if you

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:54.569 
Universal trick I'm not sure if you
would<00:00:53.260> call<00:00:53.440> this<00:00:53.559> advanced<00:00:54.250> intermediate

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:54.579 
would call this advanced intermediate

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:56.639 
would call this advanced intermediate
beginner<00:00:55.120> I<00:00:55.420> don't<00:00:56.020> know<00:00:56.079> i'll<00:00:56.230> let<00:00:56.410> you<00:00:56.500> be

00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:56.649 
beginner I don't know i'll let you be

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:59.549 
beginner I don't know i'll let you be
the<00:00:56.770> judge<00:00:56.910> but<00:00:58.020> what<00:00:59.020> your<00:00:59.140> initially<00:00:59.469> going

00:00:59.549 --> 00:00:59.559 
the judge but what your initially going

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:01.500 
the judge but what your initially going
to<00:00:59.680> do<00:00:59.770> and<00:00:59.920> this<00:01:00.430> is<00:01:00.550> how<00:01:00.699> i<00:01:00.730> started<00:01:01.239> it

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
to do and this is how i started it

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.279 
to do and this is how i started it
because<00:01:01.780> i<00:01:02.320> did<00:01:02.500> a<00:01:02.530> basic<00:01:02.739> aerial<00:01:03.370> from<00:01:04.360> the

00:01:05.279 --> 00:01:05.289 
because i did a basic aerial from the

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:06.810 
because i did a basic aerial from the
safe<00:01:05.500> handle<00:01:05.860> up<00:01:05.979> in<00:01:06.130> the<00:01:06.190> bite<00:01:06.340> handle<00:01:06.670> down

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:06.820 
safe handle up in the bite handle down

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.109 
safe handle up in the bite handle down
and<00:01:07.630> whenever<00:01:08.289> come<00:01:08.710> up<00:01:08.890> i'll<00:01:09.369> a<00:01:09.550> flying<00:01:09.880> it<00:01:10.000> up

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:10.119 
and whenever come up i'll a flying it up

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:12.719 
and whenever come up i'll a flying it up
had<00:01:10.720> almost<00:01:11.170> directly<00:01:11.619> straight<00:01:12.220> in<00:01:12.399> front<00:01:12.610> of

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:12.729 
had almost directly straight in front of

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:13.859 
had almost directly straight in front of
me<00:01:12.820> so<00:01:12.970> it<00:01:13.060> looked<00:01:13.210> like<00:01:13.300> i'm<00:01:13.450> looking<00:01:13.720> at<00:01:13.810> you

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:13.869 
me so it looked like i'm looking at you

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:16.620 
me so it looked like i'm looking at you
know<00:01:14.110> sticks<00:01:14.500> and<00:01:14.830> then<00:01:14.950> and<00:01:15.240> i<00:01:16.240> called<00:01:16.509> it

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
know sticks and then and i called it

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.810 
know sticks and then and i called it
kind<00:01:16.810> of<00:01:16.869> scissor<00:01:17.110> catch<00:01:17.640> well<00:01:18.640> when<00:01:18.789> I

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
kind of scissor catch well when I

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.230 
kind of scissor catch well when I
brought<00:01:19.060> it<00:01:19.119> down<00:01:19.390> I<00:01:19.979> bring<00:01:20.979> it<00:01:21.190> out<00:01:21.729> of<00:01:22.030> that

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
brought it down I bring it out of that

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.109 
brought it down I bring it out of that
vertical<00:01:23.310> plane<00:01:24.310> and<00:01:24.580> take<00:01:24.789> it<00:01:24.910> into<00:01:25.030> a

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:25.119 
vertical plane and take it into a

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:27.839 
vertical plane and take it into a
horizontal<00:01:25.780> plane<00:01:26.220> for<00:01:27.220> a<00:01:27.250> full<00:01:27.520> twirl<00:01:27.819> like

00:01:27.839 --> 00:01:27.849 
horizontal plane for a full twirl like

00:01:27.849 --> 00:01:31.320 
horizontal plane for a full twirl like
that<00:01:28.300> but<00:01:29.289> I<00:01:29.530> stop<00:01:29.979> right<00:01:30.220> there<00:01:30.459> and<00:01:30.729> I<00:01:31.119> use

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
that but I stop right there and I use

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.960 
that but I stop right there and I use
the<00:01:31.479> momentum<00:01:31.780> that<00:01:32.110> it's<00:01:32.259> carrying<00:01:32.619> to<00:01:33.550> swing

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
the momentum that it's carrying to swing

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.710 
the momentum that it's carrying to swing
it<00:01:34.090> around<00:01:34.979> back<00:01:35.979> down<00:01:36.310> into<00:01:36.640> a<00:01:37.479> vertical

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 
it around back down into a vertical

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.440 
it around back down into a vertical
plane<00:01:38.080> and<00:01:38.410> then<00:01:39.069> back<00:01:39.340> up<00:01:39.610> and<00:01:39.819> on<00:01:40.239> that

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
plane and then back up and on that

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.529 
plane and then back up and on that
momentum<00:01:41.020> I<00:01:41.200> let<00:01:41.530> go<00:01:41.560> and<00:01:42.039> it<00:01:42.910> swings<00:01:43.179> into

00:01:43.529 --> 00:01:43.539 
momentum I let go and it swings into

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:45.730 
momentum I let go and it swings into
this<00:01:44.289> position

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
this position

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.520 
this position
and<00:01:45.920> then<00:01:46.460> I<00:01:46.520> come<00:01:46.729> around<00:01:47.540> almost<00:01:48.259> like<00:01:48.380> i'm

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
and then I come around almost like i'm

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.249 
and then I come around almost like i'm
going<00:01:48.649> to<00:01:48.740> chaplain<00:01:49.420> but<00:01:50.420> i<00:01:50.450> don't<00:01:50.750> chaplain

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:51.259 
going to chaplain but i don't chaplain

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:53.109 
going to chaplain but i don't chaplain
and<00:01:51.409> bring<00:01:52.070> it<00:01:52.189> back<00:01:52.220> into<00:01:52.579> the<00:01:52.670> vertical

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
and bring it back into the vertical

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:57.510 
and bring it back into the vertical
plane<00:01:53.270> and<00:01:53.799> then<00:01:54.799> bring<00:01:54.979> it<00:01:55.100> back<00:01:55.130> around<00:01:55.780> here

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
plane and then bring it back around here

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.469 
plane and then bring it back around here
and<00:01:59.080> throw<00:02:00.080> it<00:02:00.229> from<00:02:00.350> that<00:02:00.560> position<00:02:01.479> particle

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
and throw it from that position particle

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:06.310 
and throw it from that position particle
again<00:02:02.750> facing<00:02:03.289> me<00:02:03.470> and<00:02:04.600> catch<00:02:05.600> it<00:02:05.630> again<00:02:05.899> into

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
again facing me and catch it again into

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.490 
again facing me and catch it again into
this<00:02:06.439> position<00:02:06.649> and<00:02:07.100> that's<00:02:08.140> how<00:02:09.140> you<00:02:09.200> can

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
this position and that's how you can

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.420 
this position and that's how you can
continue<00:02:10.009> the<00:02:10.729> scissor

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.520 

anyways<00:02:15.209> I<00:02:15.450> hope<00:02:15.810> that's<00:02:16.170> what<00:02:16.290> you're

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
anyways I hope that's what you're

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.769 
anyways I hope that's what you're
looking<00:02:16.769> for<00:02:18.260> enjoy<00:02:19.260> the<00:02:19.439> story
