00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.410
 I do not know who to visit a farm with the modern system of air conditioning 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.410
 of milk collection at conferences 

00:00:08.949 --> 00:00:13.329
 in the last 15 years the national milk production has gone from 11 vehicles 

00:00:13.329 --> 00:00:15.040
 billions of liters 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.919
 to 25 point 7 billion 

00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:20.979
 this represents a growth of 131% 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:26.970
 Brazil is the sixth largest milk producer in the world 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.550
 main milk producing state and continues to lead the number of farms 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.920
 in milk activity 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.160
 we are here on a property where we produce 4 thousand and 500 liters of milk per 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:38.760
 day 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.769
 and here quality nutrition and animal health are priorities it seems that the 

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:49.710
 quality really makes a difference yes because the whole herd is kept in the system 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.070
 confined 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:56.460
 is done, and disease prophylaxis is all balancing 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.300
 production based on the production of each lot 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.830
 and food items are essential to have a good 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:07.090
 productivity 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.270
 the enclosed intensive system 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:15.740
 high quality bulky and concentrated feed is essential year round 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.000
 are based on the total diet 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.820
 corn silage compounds expensive their soybean meal and minerals 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:29.170
 finally, it is a technical follow-up of management and property management 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.070
 there are taxos padinha in its milk production with labor 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:39.730
 extremely lean a property that stay with its 3 and 4 and who saw them 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:41.460
 of milk per day 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.990
 this property in one has a shed with the modern system 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.800
 forced ventilation and cooling have been used in the search for 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:56.070
 improvements in environmental thermal conditions for dairy cows such as 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.710
 benefits because it helps to take the temperature out of the heat of the var 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.840
 remove the heat of the vote - the sixth store the representation is to improve 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.399
 the animal comfort mainly of the period 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:08.469
 ef 

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:09.779
 it's summer 

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:15.119
 series from October to the end of April where temperatures in boredom 

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:20.249
 urns I am extremely dry to high and as it is the herd already Maria Paula 

00:02:20.249 --> 00:02:23.919
 it is necessary to make this refrigeration 

00:02:23.919 --> 00:02:25.079
 to be able to 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:28.239
 provide greater thermal comfort to animals 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:34.489
 are excellent specimens that reach an average of 32 liters per day 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:40.360
 it is possible to see in this property a standardization of all cows with 

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:46.180
 lots of dairy strength excellent breast systems special highlight for everyone 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:51.969
 the anterior udders very well inserted into the wall of the abdomen support 

00:02:51.969 --> 00:02:57.830
 without such a strong support for the breast system that produces much 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:02:58.749
 milk 

00:02:58.749 --> 00:03:02.969
 besides these characteristics are another extremely important factor 

00:03:02.969 --> 00:03:05.969
 is hygiene at the moment of order 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:08.239
 it was observed that the 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:12.069
 the official had not counted any with the attitude of the animal was made 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:17.790
 remove the first jets was made cleaning the storm chef station with 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.039
 the specific products far fred 

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:25.489
 for removing bacteria kills bacteria that we happen to have come 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:28.109
 Squid from the area already feeding 

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:32.790
 and after that the introduction of the pitas was made the apparatus of order where 

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:37.919
 was picked up the milk and soon after was picked up again what he calls powders 

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:41.119
 dipp and that is a treatment made with specific products 

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:46.769
 is to protect even because it has its open channel called sphincter to 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:52.519
 protect against the entry of new bacteria is high milk yield 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:57.449
 and is really linked to animal handling care 

00:03:57.449 --> 00:04:03.499
 besides presenting in vigorous health the animals to a well treated hobby 

00:04:03.499 --> 00:04:04.899
 the desmandos of one of them
