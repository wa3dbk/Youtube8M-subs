and<00:01:39.180> very<00:01:40.079> close<00:01:40.350> in<00:01:40.530> here<00:01:40.680> there's<00:01:40.950> a

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
and very close in here there's a

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.550 
and very close in here there's a
titanium<00:01:41.490> sticker<00:01:42.270> decal<00:01:42.540> which<00:01:43.200> is<00:01:43.350> going<00:01:43.470> to

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
titanium sticker decal which is going to

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.980 
titanium sticker decal which is going to
kind<00:01:44.340> of<00:01:44.490> add<00:01:44.729> shininess<00:01:45.270> to<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.630> bike<00:01:45.780> I'm

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
kind of add shininess to the bike I'm

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.660 
kind of add shininess to the bike I'm
not<00:01:46.140> sure<00:01:46.290> this<00:01:46.439> is<00:01:46.500> really<00:01:46.770> making<00:01:47.310> your<00:01:47.520> bike

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
not sure this is really making your bike

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.399 
not sure this is really making your bike
better<00:01:47.909> but<00:01:48.509> it's<00:01:48.630> definitely<00:01:48.810> making<00:01:49.200> it

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
better but it's definitely making it

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:50.679 
better but it's definitely making it
cooler

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:50.689 
cooler

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:54.160 
cooler
so<00:01:51.530> I<00:01:51.560> like<00:01:51.799> it<00:01:52.479> one<00:01:53.479> thing<00:01:53.630> we've<00:01:53.810> done<00:01:53.929> on<00:01:54.079> a

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
so I like it one thing we've done on a

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.599 
so I like it one thing we've done on a
lot<00:01:54.319> of<00:01:54.439> our<00:01:54.560> custom<00:01:54.890> ROM<00:01:55.069> pins<00:01:55.340> is<00:01:55.460> we've

00:01:55.599 --> 00:01:55.609 
lot of our custom ROM pins is we've

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:57.520 
lot of our custom ROM pins is we've
installed<00:01:55.969> a<00:01:56.119> cambium<00:01:56.569> seatpost<00:01:56.810> to<00:01:57.319> match

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
installed a cambium seatpost to match

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.169 
installed a cambium seatpost to match
the<00:01:57.799> look<00:01:57.950> and<00:01:58.159> feel<00:01:58.310> of<00:01:58.520> the<00:01:58.700> brow<00:01:58.850> fication

00:01:59.169 --> 00:01:59.179 
the look and feel of the brow fication

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:01.330 
the look and feel of the brow fication
overall<00:02:00.140> it<00:02:00.259> just<00:02:00.289> looks<00:02:00.619> sleeker<00:02:01.009> sleeker

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
overall it just looks sleeker sleeker

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.520 
overall it just looks sleeker sleeker
faster<00:02:01.460> kind<00:02:02.450> of<00:02:02.539> makes<00:02:02.750> sense<00:02:02.990> of<00:02:03.380> the<00:02:03.439> whole

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
faster kind of makes sense of the whole

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:07.909 
that you're going to do make it the

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:10.059 
that you're going to do make it the
hinge<00:02:08.119> clamshells<00:02:08.660> because<00:02:09.470> this<00:02:09.799> is<00:02:09.950> not

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
hinge clamshells because this is not

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:12.550 
hinge clamshells because this is not
only<00:02:10.399> beautiful<00:02:10.670> but<00:02:10.879> really<00:02:11.330> practical<00:02:11.989> with

only beautiful but really practical with

only beautiful but really practical with
non<00:02:12.769> designs<00:02:13.160> you<00:02:13.549> have<00:02:13.730> a<00:02:13.760> magnetic<00:02:14.180> shell

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
non designs you have a magnetic shell

non designs you have a magnetic shell
which<00:02:15.470> actually<00:02:16.010> stick<00:02:16.519> to<00:02:16.790> the<00:02:16.910> bike<00:02:17.090> and

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:17.299 
which actually stick to the bike and

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:19.300 
which actually stick to the bike and
prevents<00:02:17.810> it<00:02:17.900> from<00:02:17.989> rotating<00:02:18.440> beyond<00:02:19.129> where

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
prevents it from rotating beyond where

prevents it from rotating beyond where
it<00:02:19.340> should<00:02:19.610> so<00:02:20.180> now<00:02:20.360> you're<00:02:20.660> saving<00:02:20.900> yourself

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
it should so now you're saving yourself

it should so now you're saving yourself

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
time by not having to fiddle with this

time by not having to fiddle with this
plant<00:02:23.180> mechanism<00:02:23.660> and<00:02:23.840> you<00:02:24.620> have<00:02:24.890> something<00:02:25.310> a

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:25.519 
plant mechanism and you have something a

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:27.400 
plant mechanism and you have something a
little<00:02:26.030> bit<00:02:26.120> shinier<00:02:26.599> a<00:02:26.810> little<00:02:27.110> bit<00:02:27.200> more

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
little bit shinier a little bit more

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.280 
little bit shinier a little bit more
kind<00:02:27.709> of<00:02:28.299> minimalist<00:02:29.299> and<00:02:29.540> beautiful<00:02:29.870> on<00:02:30.049> your

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
kind of minimalist and beautiful on your

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.830 
kind of minimalist and beautiful on your
bike<00:02:30.440> probably<00:02:31.400> one<00:02:31.610> of<00:02:31.640> the<00:02:31.819> the<00:02:32.450> funkiest

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
bike probably one of the the funkiest

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.390 
bike probably one of the the funkiest
little<00:02:33.140> bits<00:02:33.290> that<00:02:33.470> knob<00:02:33.650> makes<00:02:33.980> and<00:02:34.250> that's

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
little bits that knob makes and that's

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.479 
little bits that knob makes and that's
the<00:02:34.879> handlebar<00:02:35.360> catch<00:02:35.569> so<00:02:36.260> it's<00:02:37.190> different

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
the handlebar catch so it's different

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:39.190 
the handlebar catch so it's different
than<00:02:37.910> the<00:02:37.940> plastic<00:02:38.510> catch<00:02:38.690> and<00:02:38.900> that<00:02:38.989> it's<00:02:39.110> a

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
than the plastic catch and that it's a

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.530 
than the plastic catch and that it's a
tiny<00:02:39.379> little<00:02:39.500> piece<00:02:39.799> of<00:02:39.950> wire<00:02:40.099> and<00:02:40.370> it<00:02:41.329> is

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
tiny little piece of wire and it is

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.270 
tiny little piece of wire and it is
probably<00:02:42.109> 20%<00:02:42.410> of<00:02:42.769> the<00:02:42.859> weight<00:02:42.980> of<00:02:43.190> that

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
probably 20% of the weight of that

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.580 
probably 20% of the weight of that
little<00:02:43.519> piece<00:02:43.640> of<00:02:43.790> plastic<00:02:44.180> but<00:02:44.780> moreover<00:02:45.260> it

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
little piece of plastic but moreover it

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:46.900 
little piece of plastic but moreover it
just<00:02:45.799> makes<00:02:45.980> your<00:02:46.099> bike<00:02:46.280> look<00:02:46.579> a<00:02:46.730> whole<00:02:46.879> lot

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
just makes your bike look a whole lot

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.270 
just makes your bike look a whole lot
lighter<00:02:47.390> so<00:02:47.660> that<00:02:48.260> about<00:02:48.590> covers<00:02:48.890> it<00:02:48.920> for<00:02:49.040> what

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
lighter so that about covers it for what

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.589 
lighter so that about covers it for what
