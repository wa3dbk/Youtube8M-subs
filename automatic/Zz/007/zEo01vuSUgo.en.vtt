00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 I'm in what is minecraft 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.550
 pocket edition of my ipod touch that 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.600
 has like 

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:13.809
 that will be more than a year that did not record 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:17.470
 this on this map good on the ipod in 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:19.150
 This usually serious about a year ago in 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.580
 the tutorial of how to put them is client 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.520
 of pokemon here and good the skins and 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:26.849
 then it was lost with the update 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.849
 either way 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:34.740
 and here nothing is built nothing else 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:39.480
 It's a little tour of what is me 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:42.000
 this map is one to build 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.920
 is what I have built since I have 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.399
 the application from the first version 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.320
 that came out and well this here is what 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.210
 It's my castle, it's not that big 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.120
 has input and good I wanted to practice 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:58.320
 one thing that I had to do a while ago in 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:00.690
 the forums in the forums that are called 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.790
 youtube such chaos and it's like that help 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.770
 to help youtube 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:11.010
 they do not give you tips and advice on how to do 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:13.590
 how to make videos and edit things 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.810
 and well this one I found a guy from 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.320
 that in his jurisdiction in English not and the kid 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.750
 put 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.940
 a video of him from his channel that just 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.250
 do and is playing 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.350
 call of duty 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.860
 and well the guy asked for nothing more like 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:33.000
 is the opinion of those who were there 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:35.620
 to see what they could improve or do 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.530
 are the mines again right now 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:40.480
 because I will not cry and well the guy 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.540
 asked for his opinion of the forum's youth 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:48.130
 do not 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:48.130
 and it is of account that they say they say 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.590
 people pass there is a girl and others 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.450
 types of your life is shit and the show 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.850
 but the kids offended no but because 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.150
 says and well up tells you it's not that 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:03.510
 you have to use 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:05.640
 1080 resolution without other videos are 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:09.720
 shit because nowadays people do not see 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.490
 your videos if they are not 1080 or at least 720 and 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.340
 good and had as choice that his 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:17.040
 microphone his audio was shit too and 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:20.200
 she 's a lie because I swear to you 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:23.230
 I swear the audio sounded good or is 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:26.440
 it sounded great and the video looked good 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:29.470
 but but it was not hd 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.110
 and well that city ran out 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.290
 criticized 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:37.350
 this you can use him they mistreated him 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.850
 have a video according to them but the 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.540
 truth I was very entertained the 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:45.330
 driver was recorded well what is doing 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.640
 snipers killing people 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.710
 and good these people 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.010
 in two million percent they made a 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:54.830
 egg 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:57.019
 also put eggs and well these 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:00.950
 people will be responsible for humiliating the 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:03.860
 poor guy not for making the video disk 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:06.830
 ugly and those means like that things because 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:09.770
 I 'm subscribed in that forum 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:12.500
 I'm subscribed and the truth is that I have not 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:15.200
 wanted to put anything because exactly 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:18.349
 those people were no longer wanted me 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.840
 because that criticize you know what you 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:22.940
 they say you have to keep alive that 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:26.090
 you have to have a capture card 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:29.120
 I like four thousand pesos 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:31.340
 and they also ask you at least according to 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.590
 she does have a blues microphone 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:37.810
 or something like that 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:40.989
 just like it's called global club something like that 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:43.910
 they ask you to have that microphone because 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:47.750
 so that your audio is super professional 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:50.270
 and with anti pop filter those things 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:52.240
 and well I say how for here I say yes 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:54.760
 are you going to make a comment 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:57.490
 a tube of some things and I say I do not know 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:02.819
 more so much strange thing is needed and 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:05.640
 expensive and good the poor guy finished it 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:09.209
 and I wonder or is it so necessary 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:12.359
 think there are people who have videos 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:14.310
 since years ago and they are not hd and people 

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:14.609
 he keeps seeing it because at my point of 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.530
 view 

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:20.049
 while the content is good 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:22.180
 entertain you laugh it does not depend what 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:23.920
 I 'm seeing that it matters if it's hd or 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.620
 no or equal the audio while 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:28.870
 understandably, it matters if it is very high 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:32.280
 quality or not 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.280
 but good these people 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:37.499
 they really take themselves very seriously 

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:39.300
 from the che of now and well that is not 

00:04:37.499 --> 00:04:41.340
 they suppose to think that not everyone lives 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:44.610
 in the United States that where they have 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:48.420
 the fast super internet and computer 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:50.910
 super powerful and good to be 

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:55.400
 are those reasons pages of cher and 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:55.400
 I was recently looking for a laptop 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:00.620
 I think of asking in a forum 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:03.710
 those in English and also the same you 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:06.110
 they just criticize you because I who buy 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:08.539
 a laptop is normal or nano not very 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:11.120
 powerful but well enough to 

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:13.430
 play basic games and bad traffic 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.800
 things and good these people that they 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:18.520
 suggests a laptop that is good because 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:21.760
 you've seen work and no no no them 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:25.600
 at least one laptop 

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:28.810
 of those laptops that cost a thousand dollars 

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:32.120
 if they are not shit sa not stains exaggerates 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:35.540
 everything for me I know more 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.540
 unnecessary so much 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:42.210
 Enchanted salts do not exaggerate the same 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:44.530
 when he had a hamster that there is a tumor 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:47.770
 good these people in the forums of 

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:50.410
 English , this section also remains with you 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:53.860
 to tell you not to take the hamster to 

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:55.840
 fast veterinarian and well and the chair and 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:58.450
 as well as that but as healthy manchin here 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:00.960
 9 we had hamster over there maybe 

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:06.300
 but here there is no then 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:11.419
 here here veterinarians took him by 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:11.419
 please and good, they suggested that why 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:18.310
 because it was a tumor does not want to end 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:19.810
 of forces and I can not think because a 

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:21.910
 person because if it takes you determine 

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:23.919
 they did not leave 700 dollars for the operation 

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:26.650
 of a tumor and I can do you no 

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:29.080
 manches are like 8 thousand pesos to operate 

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:31.360
 a hamster that costs 25 pesos or 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:34.479
 where is the logic and can you buy 

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:37.449
 other monsters equal by 25 pesos the 

00:06:34.479 --> 00:06:39.880
 same color all appear they still with 

00:06:37.449 --> 00:06:41.380
 serve a year or two alive up to eight thousand 

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:44.960
 pesos is an animal that we all already know 

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:48.960
 will die we do not agree 

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:53.169
 I have that conflict with 

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:56.020
 with these people on the internet that 

00:06:53.169 --> 00:06:57.669
 exaggerate everything then I think that by 

00:06:56.020 --> 00:07:00.129
 that also better let videos 

00:06:57.669 --> 00:07:01.719
 in English because if it 's super 

00:07:00.129 --> 00:07:03.529
 complicated this people too 

00:07:01.719 --> 00:07:07.899
 exaggerated 

00:07:03.529 --> 00:07:07.899
 and well I'll see if 

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:12.879
 you can eat the eggs we have acute 

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:19.560
 you can eat 

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:22.590
 which I am about to die any more 

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:29.090
 I want to show you is not this 

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:29.090
 what did I do to a new game 

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:34.320
 and well , I think it's going to end here 

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:37.190
 well because the small sum that's there 

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:39.449
 I had with today's business 

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:42.409
 the truth that 

00:07:39.449 --> 00:07:42.409
 if it is done to me 

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:47.879
 well people 

00:07:45.449 --> 00:07:51.180
 I do not know what you think but good if 

00:07:47.879 --> 00:07:53.699
 follow our video signal comment a 

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:55.939
 comment like that if they put it for what 

00:07:53.699 --> 00:07:55.939
 will be 

00:07:57.090 --> 00:08:00.540
 put to add that you have my picture 

00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:01.770
 if they got here in the 

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:04.830
 video 

00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:07.319
 and it would be all in my tour of what 

00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:10.620
 it's the minecraft television on my ipod 

00:08:07.319 --> 00:08:12.330
 touch 4g and ya and then I'll see how it happens 

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:15.720
 this map to the nexus to play it and 

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:18.290
 better and good above all 

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:18.290
 bye
