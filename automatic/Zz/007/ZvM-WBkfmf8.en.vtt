how<00:00:37.680> bringing<00:00:38.399> out<00:00:38.550> paint<00:00:39.360> can<00:00:39.660> actually<00:00:41.090> call

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
how bringing out paint can actually call

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.799

up<00:00:42.120> some<00:00:44.059> some<00:00:45.059> ways<00:00:45.210> to<00:00:45.420> be<00:00:45.570> really

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
up some some ways to be really

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.830 
up some some ways to be really
unstructured<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:47.030> in<00:00:48.030> my<00:00:48.180> setting<00:00:48.629> that's

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
unstructured and in my setting that's

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.790 
unstructured and in my setting that's
not<00:00:49.110> really<00:00:50.210> conducive<00:00:51.260> when<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.379> paint<00:00:52.620> is

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
not really conducive when the paint is

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.610 
not really conducive when the paint is
presented<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:53.820> I've<00:00:54.230> feel<00:00:55.230> that<00:00:55.410> it's

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
presented and I've feel that it's

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.740 
presented and I've feel that it's
appropriate<00:00:55.890> and<00:00:56.399> helpful<00:00:56.730> in<00:00:57.090> therapeutic

happen with the fluidy things turn out

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.800 
happen with the fluidy things turn out
not<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.130> way<00:02:05.250> they<00:02:05.520> intended<00:02:06.090> so<00:02:06.329> it<00:02:06.479> becomes

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
not the way they intended so it becomes

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.360 
not the way they intended so it becomes
more<00:02:07.049> of<00:02:07.170> a<00:02:07.259> subconscious<00:02:08.690> medium<00:02:09.690> where<00:02:10.410> that

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
more of a subconscious medium where that

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.309 
more of a subconscious medium where that
