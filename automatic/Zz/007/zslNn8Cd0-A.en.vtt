00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:00.680
 August! 

00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:01.840
 August, from here! 

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:06.340
 Dusseldorf, Germany 

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.060
 I ate a winka bar and felt tasteless ... 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:11.680
 ... not chocolate, 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:13.820
 Or coconut, 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:15.660
 Or nut, 

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:17.320
 Or peanut butter, 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:18.780
 Or Nuga, 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.620
 Or fragile butter, or caramel, or sprinklers, (small pieces of candy used to decorate candy) 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.180
 So I looked and found the golden ticket. 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.500
 August, how did you celebrate? 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.460
 I ate more dessert. 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.560
 We learned that August will find the golden ticket. 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.780
 He ate lots of candy a day so it was not impossible for him to find him. 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.040
 Buckinghamshire, England. 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.200
 Ferroca, can you spell it for us please? 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.740
 F, Y, R, K, F, F, S, F, 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.940
 When Ferroca told me she wanted one of the gold tickets, 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.380
 I started to buy all the Winca candy that I could put my hands on. 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.060
 Thousands of them, hundreds of thousands. 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.340
 I'm not a walnut worker, you see, so I told my workers ... 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.020
 Good morning ladies, now you can stop working in peanuts ... 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.040
 ... and start removing the wrappers of this chocolate instead. 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.680
 A few days passed and we were not lucky. 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.020
 It was terrible. 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.640
 Petro Veruca began to disturb with the days more and more. 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.860
 Where is my gold ticket? I want a golden ticket! 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.360
 Well, gentlemen, I just hated to see my little girl feel so unhappy. 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.840
 I vowed that I would continue to search until I could get what I wanted. 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.780
 Finally, she found her ticket. 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.480
 Dad, I want another dowry. 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.500
 Atlanta, Georgia 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:50.880
 These are only 236 awards and medals won by Violet. 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.320
 I chew gum, often. 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.300
 But when I heard about these tickets, I put the gum down and turned it for dessert. 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.120
 She is just a young woman excited. 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.620
 I do not know where she came from. 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.880
 I am the world champion in chewing gum. 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.100
 This gum I chew, 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.540
 I work on it for three months. 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:10.860
 This is the record. 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.480
 Of course I participated awards, 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.100
 Stick mostly. 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.960
 Winka says he will be awarded a special prize, better than any award. 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.080
 I do not care who the four are. 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.900
 This child will get it? I will. 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.900
 Denver, Colorado. 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.380
 All you have to do is follow the manufacturing dates, 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.960
 Offset by the Nikkei weather and derivatives. 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.820
 Can delay the result. 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.440
 Most of the time I do not know what to talk about. 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.920
 Kids these days with all this technology. 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.860
 To the end! To the end! To the end! 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.780
 They do not seem to be keeping children for too long. 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.000
 In the end, I had only to buy one dessert. 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:03.640
 And how was it? 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.380
 I do not know. I hate chocolate.
