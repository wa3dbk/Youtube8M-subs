00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
rocky packaging looks like back here in

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.550 
rocky packaging looks like back here in
Malaysia<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.900> this<00:01:39.900> is<00:01:40.110> actually

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
Malaysia and this is actually

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.249 
Malaysia and this is actually
manufactured<00:01:41.280> in<00:01:41.430> Thailand<00:01:42.210> so<00:01:42.450> I<00:01:42.840> believe

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
manufactured in Thailand so I believe

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.370 
manufactured in Thailand so I believe
that<00:01:43.850> back<00:01:44.850> here<00:01:45.060> in<00:01:45.180> Asia<00:01:45.420> I<00:01:45.869> mean<00:01:46.140> like

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
that back here in Asia I mean like

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.630 
that back here in Asia I mean like
Singapore<00:01:47.240> Thailand<00:01:48.240> or<00:01:48.600> Malaysia<00:01:49.640> the

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
Singapore Thailand or Malaysia the

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.460 
Singapore Thailand or Malaysia the
packaging<00:01:51.149> of<00:01:51.240> poky<00:01:51.600> looks<00:01:51.810> like<00:01:51.990> this<00:01:52.200> I

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
packaging of poky looks like this I

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.340 
packaging of poky looks like this I
think<00:01:52.740> this<00:01:53.159> is<00:01:53.340> much<00:01:53.700> more<00:01:54.119> nicer<00:01:54.509> than<00:01:54.990> the

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
think this is much more nicer than the

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.359 
think this is much more nicer than the
Pocky<00:01:56.009> in<00:01:56.549> Japan<00:01:57.090> yeah<00:01:57.509> it<00:01:57.810> is<00:01:57.960> more<00:01:58.369> colorful

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
Pocky in Japan yeah it is more colorful

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.580 
Pocky in Japan yeah it is more colorful
and<00:02:00.149> then<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.810> packaging<00:02:01.259> is<00:02:01.380> more

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590
