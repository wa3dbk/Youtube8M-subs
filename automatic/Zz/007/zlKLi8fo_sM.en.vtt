00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:05.100
 watch out for one 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.870
 video card upgrade but interested 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.700
 do not want to spend that much money 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.809
 is right here because this is 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.460
 the gtx 960 and that is pretty cheap 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.839
 if you have more such videos 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.010
 Go giga games then give the 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.350
 video but a thumbs up and 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.820
 load comment because you like it 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.320
 has and does not forget the channel too 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.740
 subscribe to no video in the future 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.740
 to miss 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.370
 we introduce the series 960 se but 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.530
 first a bit in front of the cards 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.680
 costs were over 200 euro come with 2 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.210
 gb gddr5 memory and nvidia tried 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.800
 with this series a so-called sweet 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.060
 to hit the spot is called gamer in the 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.250
 middle class that's a lot of people 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:49.630
 out there and still they try 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.640
 you for these low prices 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:53.680
 super good 1080p gaming at high 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.760
 to offer attitudes and partly 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.690
 even at one of the games for the 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:00.640
 complete four k especially interesting 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.500
 is the 69 for upgrades speak if you 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.150
 already an existing pc gaming system 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.530
 But you can improve your graphics card 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.240
 you want to go then in any case 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.940
 relatively good with this card here 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.220
 performs about 50 percent better 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.200
 the 660 another card from this 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.790
 middle class series of media and is 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.800
 quasi new on the market 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.630
 first of all ask me our card 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.840
 We tested this before that 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:26.530
 the asus tricks gtx 69 that is from home 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:28.570
 comes from overclocked on 1291 megahertz 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.869
 with three displayport connectors one 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.550
 HDMI 2.0 connection and a DVI input 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:34.900
 who knows more about video connections 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.550
 I would like to be able to learn here 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.020
 In this episode again your is and there 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.910
 Let's talk fast and in the category 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.840
 simply screens access the 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.520
 I will also video sometime again 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.200
 decouple and put on league alone 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.509
 so you get there because quite straightforward 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.350
 and look at it all 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.880
 In addition, the card has one 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.530
 so-called file and gaming mode the 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.060
 means the fans of the map jump 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.130
 only when they are really needed 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.840
 and exceeded a certain temperature 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.880
 that means your card 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.500
 completely empty housing good straight at 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.030
 Gamestar never too demanding 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.440
 are computing and hard core gaming 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.880
 the card cools about 30 percent 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.520
 more efficient thanks to this relative 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.289
 intelligent systems in general is one 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.000
 nvidia graphics card speaks here is the 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.920
 funds extremely supported on the pc 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.810
 this is a software that automatically 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.610
 All driver software updates the 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.920
 Automatically your player optimized for 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.930
 the graphics card the euro 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.459
 team is built in with the feature of 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.989
 shadow plate for example you can play game 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.370
 scenes even record later 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.349
 after they happened 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.730
 there ensures that your performance at 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:28.620
 gaming is the same but you still 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.150
 still the game with nets can and that 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.770
 gamescom and on for example the over 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.510
 the shield tablet that supports deep 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.130
 of course, of course, who has one 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.390
 closer appointment again many tablet 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.530
 would like to see who can 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.450
 here there are the colleagues of 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.020
 giga android the whole time more accurate 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.810
 watched 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:45.209
 the graphics card processor of the gtx 69 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.650
 already builds like 79 and 89 and others 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.019
 predecessors of the series on the maxwell 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.060
 architecture allows the maximum effect 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:55.260
 including dynamic super resolution 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:57.209
 say 1 4 kg up to 1080p monitor 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.730
 still bleak that prevents wintering and 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.650
 input lag and graphics processors with max 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.840
 tecture are pretty energy and 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.459
 Power efficiency if power consumption 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.730
 somehow should be of interest to you 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:10.920
 this graphics card consumes relatively the 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:13.350
 also supports the whole mfs is 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.660
 a new ntl leasing method from via 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:18.120
 that works better or sms speaks 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:20.160
 make it better and even improve yours 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.690
 performance trend 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.100
 if there is not much to discover 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.780
 I would like to be able to do that too 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.310
 this success against torres doing talk 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.750
 We also decide about it 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.250
 antialiasing and let's talk a few 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.270
 variants how the whole works and 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.400
 what is actually looking for 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:33.900
 We come now to a few benchmarks 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.310
 we tested the whole thing on one 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.050
 relatively strong system with an i7 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.580
 processor just about possible 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.840
 bottleneck to prevent and look 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.670
 that no other hardware part 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.390
 somehow the benchmark negative 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.100
 impaired 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.510
 we have some synthetic ones 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.980
 benchmarks looked at as you are here completely 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.880
 good between different graphics cards 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.290
 can compare 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.640
 who will know the exact values 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.840
 he would like to do that we can 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.670
 read the article 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.920
 In addition, we were at Battlefield 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.120
 4 at ultra at about 60 frames what me 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.090
 very surprising but also very 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.460
 good for 1080p gaming at far cry 4 at 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.780
 1080p on ultra has the charta a little bit 

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.830
 weakened there we are under the 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.390
 30 fans liked 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.440
 but it's also great 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.360
 currently active the relative 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.170
 to render sophisticated is on high 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.700
 We already have attitudes 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.710
 significantly better values 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:16.020
 achieved with export titles like counter 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:17.400
 strike global window we have about 260 

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:19.920
 frames in the cut achieved at very 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.420
 high settings 1080p gaming that 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.590
 is because you should have no problem 

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:24.360
 with a liquid reproduction of the 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.160
 games and also league of legends and 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.210
 other titles run extremely smoothly 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.970
 with the map and league of legends 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.950
 even works on 4k at about 60 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:34.230
 up to 70 frames speak the ampegagerling 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:35.130
 interested is the can with league of 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:35.850
 legends in any case ever 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.340
 reinschnuppern 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:41.280
 So let's see a little conclusion 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:43.410
 GTX 69 The card performs for your 200 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.880
 euro this roundabout so costs as well 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.140
 as expected , no big 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.700
 surprises on ultra settings 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:48.600
 weaker sometimes a bit of the 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:50.310
 is also criticized by some people 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.990
 But I think this review is here 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:54.810
 completely out of place because that is here 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.610
 the 960 is not 79 81 that should not 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:57.840
 or it does not have to be the most up-to-date 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:00.210
 title on these ultra settings 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.320
 completely at 60 frames shake the 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.730
 make her up for it 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.210
 Settings pretty pretty good 

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:04.770
 I think 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.180
 The map is actually just right 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.790
 for a good upgrade if you like 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:10.140
 update volt is in the price range 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:11.760
 In any case, the best thing up to date 

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.690
 the market can get my opinion 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.160
 So you get a good one after that 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:17.900
 total package for 200 euro 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.900
 I was satisfied with the test
