00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
down a little bit not much and that's

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:38.420 
down a little bit not much and that's
what<00:00:32.189> it<00:00:32.309> does<00:00:36.110> then<00:00:37.110> I'm<00:00:37.230> hoping<00:00:37.590> yeah<00:00:38.190> yeah

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
there but then I figured out that it

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.930 
there but then I figured out that it
actually<00:00:46.710> fits<00:00:47.160> don't<00:00:47.489> mind<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.760> lab

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
actually fits don't mind the lab

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.940 
actually fits don't mind the lab
interesting<00:00:48.450> and<00:00:48.570> that's<00:00:48.690> what<00:00:48.899> you<00:00:49.020> keep<00:00:49.800> an

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
interesting and that's what you keep an

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.529 
interesting and that's what you keep an
eye<00:00:50.100> out<00:00:50.129> on<00:00:50.280> this<00:00:50.690> at<00:00:51.690> he<00:00:52.559> break<00:00:52.949> down<00:00:53.160> here<00:00:53.579> so

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
eye out on this at he break down here so

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.840 
eye out on this at he break down here so
I<00:00:54.570> can<00:00:54.629> see<00:00:54.899> where<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.110> water<00:00:55.320> level<00:00:55.739> is<00:00:55.850> gone

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
I can see where the water level is gone

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.560 
I can see where the water level is gone
a<00:00:56.879> little<00:00:57.149> bit<00:00:57.449> so<00:00:57.660> I<00:00:57.719> have<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:57.930> turn<00:00:58.079> it<00:00:58.230> down

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.020 
a little bit so I have to turn it down

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
so hopefully five morning yeah I think I

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.820 
so hopefully five morning yeah I think I
should<00:01:03.210> have<00:01:03.300> gave<00:01:03.420> it<00:01:03.570> like<00:01:03.690> another<00:01:03.899> day<00:01:04.199> or

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
should have gave it like another day or

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.260 
should have gave it like another day or
two<00:01:04.860> before<00:01:05.220> I<00:01:05.400> cleaned<00:01:05.670> it<00:01:05.790> that<00:01:05.970> way<00:01:06.090> could

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
two before I cleaned it that way could

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.510 
two before I cleaned it that way could
break<00:01:06.479> in<00:01:06.689> because<00:01:07.409> I<00:01:07.650> was<00:01:07.799> having<00:01:07.920> troubles

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
break in because I was having troubles

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.890 
break in because I was having troubles

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:10.900 
keeping it

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.170 
keeping it
even<00:01:11.530> doing<00:01:11.680> this<00:01:11.950> is<00:01:12.460> the<00:01:12.640> first<00:01:12.850> time<00:01:13.000> it

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 
even doing this is the first time it

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.950 
even doing this is the first time it
started<00:01:13.570> to<00:01:13.660> do<00:01:13.840> this<00:01:14.020> again<00:01:14.320> so<00:01:15.810> hoping<00:01:16.810> that

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
started to do this again so hoping that

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.650 
started to do this again so hoping that
it<00:01:17.050> changes<00:01:17.470> you<00:01:17.620> know<00:01:17.710> I<00:01:18.420> don't<00:01:19.420> know<00:01:19.480> if<00:01:19.570> you
