then<00:02:55.230> obviously<00:02:55.380> you<00:02:55.680> don't<00:02:55.860> want<00:02:55.980> to<00:02:56.040> see<00:02:56.130> the

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
then obviously you don't want to see the

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.380 
then obviously you don't want to see the
series<00:02:56.490> and<00:02:56.610> that<00:02:56.820> makes<00:02:57.000> it<00:02:57.060> pretty<00:02:57.180> simple

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
series and that makes it pretty simple

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.060 
series and that makes it pretty simple
but<00:02:57.660> I<00:02:57.870> know<00:02:58.050> that<00:02:58.260> a<00:02:58.290> lot<00:02:58.320> of<00:02:58.470> people<00:02:58.590> really

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
but I know that a lot of people really

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:00.170 
but I know that a lot of people really
enjoyed<00:02:59.400> this<00:02:59.580> when<00:02:59.760> I<00:02:59.790> was<00:02:59.880> doing<00:03:00.060> it<00:03:00.090> for

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
enjoyed this when I was doing it for

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.580 
enjoyed this when I was doing it for
battlefield<00:03:00.600> 3<00:03:00.810> so<00:03:01.020> I<00:03:01.050> think<00:03:01.140> it<00:03:01.350> would<00:03:01.470> go

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
battlefield 3 so I think it would go

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.560 
battlefield 3 so I think it would go
over<00:03:01.740> just<00:03:02.070> as<00:03:02.250> well<00:03:02.400> for<00:03:02.520> battlefield<00:03:02.910> 4<00:03:03.090> now

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
over just as well for battlefield 4 now

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:04.850 
over just as well for battlefield 4 now
when<00:03:03.720> I<00:03:03.750> did<00:03:03.960> this<00:03:04.080> in<00:03:04.260> battlefield<00:03:04.620> 3<00:03:04.650> I

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
when I did this in battlefield 3 I

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.770 
when I did this in battlefield 3 I
almost<00:03:05.220> always<00:03:05.430> played<00:03:06.000> team<00:03:06.330> deathmatch

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
almost always played team deathmatch

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.180 
almost always played team deathmatch
because<00:03:07.230> they're<00:03:07.380> just<00:03:07.500> the<00:03:07.590> easiest<00:03:07.950> way<00:03:08.130> to

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
because they're just the easiest way to

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:09.860 
because they're just the easiest way to
get<00:03:08.340> the<00:03:08.460> video<00:03:08.730> done<00:03:08.940> in<00:03:09.120> the<00:03:09.240> sense<00:03:09.480> that<00:03:09.570> I

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
get the video done in the sense that I

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.300 
get the video done in the sense that I
didn't<00:03:10.170> want<00:03:10.290> to<00:03:10.350> worry<00:03:10.530> about<00:03:10.650> it<00:03:10.890> being<00:03:11.130> a

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
didn't want to worry about it being a

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.040 
didn't want to worry about it being a
really<00:03:11.670> long<00:03:11.850> video<00:03:12.090> like<00:03:12.450> it<00:03:12.480> inevitably

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
really long video like it inevitably

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.630 
really long video like it inevitably
would<00:03:13.320> be<00:03:13.530> if<00:03:13.770> I<00:03:14.040> played<00:03:14.250> something<00:03:14.520> like

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
would be if I played something like

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.640 
would be if I played something like
conquests<00:03:15.210> it<00:03:15.300> could<00:03:15.420> be<00:03:15.540> a<00:03:15.570> 30<00:03:16.230> minute<00:03:16.440> match

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
conquests it could be a 30 minute match

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.220 
conquests it could be a 30 minute match
where<00:03:17.130> I<00:03:17.160> get<00:03:17.280> maybe<00:03:17.490> like<00:03:17.730> 10<00:03:18.000> 15<00:03:18.330> 20<00:03:18.990> kills

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
where I get maybe like 10 15 20 kills

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.080 
where I get maybe like 10 15 20 kills
well<00:03:19.650> I<00:03:19.709> typically<00:03:20.100> play<00:03:20.250> conquest<00:03:20.730> I<00:03:20.850> don't

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
well I typically play conquest I don't

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.120 
well I typically play conquest I don't
really<00:03:21.360> get<00:03:21.510> a<00:03:21.570> lot<00:03:21.750> of<00:03:21.810> kills<00:03:22.080> so<00:03:22.560> it's<00:03:22.920> kind

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
really get a lot of kills so it's kind

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.500 
really get a lot of kills so it's kind
of<00:03:23.190> counterproductive<00:03:23.550> to<00:03:24.000> choose<00:03:24.270> a<00:03:24.300> game

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
of counterproductive to choose a game

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.840 
of counterproductive to choose a game
mode<00:03:24.720> like<00:03:24.870> that<00:03:25.110> where<00:03:25.470> the<00:03:25.950> idea<00:03:26.400> is<00:03:26.640> to

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
mode like that where the idea is to

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:28.460 
mode like that where the idea is to
showcase<00:03:27.120> what<00:03:27.360> I<00:03:27.600> can<00:03:27.810> do<00:03:27.900> with<00:03:27.930> an<00:03:28.140> entire

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
showcase what I can do with an entire

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.440 
showcase what I can do with an entire
class<00:03:28.770> and<00:03:29.190> not<00:03:29.430> just<00:03:29.610> one<00:03:29.820> thing<00:03:30.150> in<00:03:30.390> that

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
class and not just one thing in that

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.300 
class and not just one thing in that
class<00:03:30.930> so<00:03:31.350> conquest<00:03:31.770> has<00:03:31.860> never<00:03:32.100> really

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
class so conquest has never really

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.090 
class so conquest has never really
worked<00:03:32.610> out<00:03:32.730> for<00:03:33.060> it<00:03:33.150> for<00:03:33.450> bf4<00:03:33.720> I<00:03:34.200> do<00:03:34.470> plan<00:03:35.070> on

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
worked out for it for bf4 I do plan on

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.650 
worked out for it for bf4 I do plan on
primarily<00:03:35.610> playing<00:03:35.970> a<00:03:36.180> thing<00:03:36.510> like

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
primarily playing a thing like

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.020 
primarily playing a thing like
domination<00:03:37.290> because<00:03:37.680> it's<00:03:38.190> not<00:03:38.400> just<00:03:38.459> TDM

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
domination because it's not just TDM

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.160 
domination because it's not just TDM
where<00:03:39.270> it's<00:03:39.420> running<00:03:39.630> around<00:03:39.810> like<00:03:40.050> a<00:03:40.110> chicken

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
where it's running around like a chicken

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.050 
where it's running around like a chicken
with<00:03:40.530> my<00:03:40.560> head<00:03:40.650> cut<00:03:40.770> off<00:03:40.980> just<00:03:41.370> spraying<00:03:41.880> and

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
with my head cut off just spraying and

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.490 
with my head cut off just spraying and
praying<00:03:42.120> and<00:03:42.420> hope<00:03:42.540> for<00:03:42.600> the<00:03:42.720> best<00:03:42.780> with

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
praying and hope for the best with

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.560 
praying and hope for the best with
domination<00:03:44.190> it<00:03:44.430> still<00:03:44.820> actually<00:03:45.060> requires<00:03:45.450> a

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
domination it still actually requires a

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:47.270 
domination it still actually requires a
little<00:03:45.630> bit<00:03:45.750> of<00:03:45.870> tactics<00:03:46.380> but<00:03:46.830> there's<00:03:47.190> a

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
little bit of tactics but there's a

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.310 
little bit of tactics but there's a
chance<00:03:47.520> for<00:03:47.670> a<00:03:47.820> lot<00:03:48.270> of<00:03:48.450> kills<00:03:48.720> in<00:03:48.870> the<00:03:48.959> two<00:03:49.110> so

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
chance for a lot of kills in the two so

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:50.900 
chance for a lot of kills in the two so
I<00:03:49.350> think<00:03:49.470> it<00:03:49.709> kind<00:03:49.830> of<00:03:49.950> gets<00:03:50.070> the<00:03:50.280> best<00:03:50.520> of<00:03:50.700> both

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
I think it kind of gets the best of both

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.880 
I think it kind of gets the best of both
worlds<00:03:51.360> I<00:03:51.480> would<00:03:51.900> like<00:03:52.020> to<00:03:52.080> mix<00:03:52.320> in<00:03:52.470> some<00:03:52.500> rush

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
worlds I would like to mix in some rush

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.190 
worlds I would like to mix in some rush
as<00:03:53.100> well<00:03:53.310> but<00:03:53.640> that<00:03:54.000> can<00:03:54.240> also<00:03:54.450> lead<00:03:54.840> to<00:03:54.870> be

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
as well but that can also lead to be

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.290 
as well but that can also lead to be
really<00:03:55.680> really<00:03:55.800> long<00:03:56.070> games<00:03:56.400> a<00:03:56.640> lot<00:03:56.670> depends

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 
really really long games a lot depends

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.330 
really really long games a lot depends
on<00:03:57.360> how<00:03:57.540> well<00:03:57.570> rush<00:03:58.020> could<00:03:58.200> work<00:03:58.380> out<00:03:58.560> ideally

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
on how well rush could work out ideally

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:00.650 
on how well rush could work out ideally
I<00:03:59.370> like<00:03:59.550> to<00:03:59.670> keep<00:03:59.790> the<00:03:59.940> videos<00:04:00.209> close<00:04:00.420> to<00:04:00.570> about

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
I like to keep the videos close to about

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.050 
I like to keep the videos close to about
50<00:04:01.050> minutes<00:04:01.320> that<00:04:01.560> at<00:04:01.740> the<00:04:01.890> max<00:04:02.220> 10<00:04:02.820> minutes

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
50 minutes that at the max 10 minutes

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.310 
50 minutes that at the max 10 minutes
actually<00:04:03.150> preferred<00:04:03.600> because<00:04:03.810> from<00:04:04.200> what

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
actually preferred because from what

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.560 
actually preferred because from what
I've<00:04:04.440> noticed<00:04:04.620> in<00:04:04.800> the<00:04:04.860> past<00:04:05.040> is<00:04:05.400> most<00:04:06.150> people

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
I've noticed in the past is most people

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.150 
I've noticed in the past is most people
like<00:04:06.750> to<00:04:06.780> see<00:04:07.050> it<00:04:07.140> about<00:04:07.320> 10<00:04:07.590> minutes<00:04:07.800> anything

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
like to see it about 10 minutes anything

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.710 
like to see it about 10 minutes anything
longer<00:04:08.370> than<00:04:08.490> that<00:04:08.730> and<00:04:08.910> viewers<00:04:09.390> start<00:04:09.630> to

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
longer than that and viewers start to

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.449 
longer than that and viewers start to
drop<00:04:09.900> off<00:04:10.140> pretty<00:04:10.440> rapidly<00:04:10.920> so<00:04:11.220> I<00:04:11.280> like<00:04:11.430> to

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
drop off pretty rapidly so I like to

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:12.979 
drop off pretty rapidly so I like to
keep<00:04:11.640> it<00:04:11.760> at<00:04:11.850> that<00:04:11.880> point<00:04:12.150> where<00:04:12.360> where<00:04:12.720> people

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
keep it at that point where where people
