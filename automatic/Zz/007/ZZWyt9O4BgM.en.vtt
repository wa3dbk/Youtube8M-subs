00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.310 
password in and it's just gonna run a
bunch<00:00:54.879> of<00:00:55.000> coding<00:00:55.449> and<00:00:55.600> as<00:00:55.690> you<00:00:55.869> can<00:00:56.019> see<00:00:56.199> on

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.320 
bunch of coding and as you can see on

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.319 
bunch of coding and as you can see on
this<00:00:56.500> screen<00:00:56.879> it's<00:00:57.879> me

00:00:58.319 --> 00:00:58.329 
this screen it's me

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:02.729 
this screen it's me
see<00:00:58.600> there's<00:00:59.079> I<00:00:59.850> can't<00:01:00.850> see<00:01:01.089> it<00:01:01.210> my<00:01:01.539> yeah<00:01:02.379> and

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:02.739 
see there's I can't see it my yeah and

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:05.369 
see there's I can't see it my yeah and
so<00:01:03.640> here's<00:01:04.269> what<00:01:04.330> the<00:01:04.539> connect<00:01:04.809> basically

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:05.379 
so here's what the connect basically

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.480 
so here's what the connect basically
works<00:01:05.590> it's<00:01:06.310> got<00:01:06.490> three<00:01:07.090> cameras<00:01:08.100> you<00:01:09.100> got<00:01:09.250> the

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 
works it's got three cameras you got the

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.230 
works it's got three cameras you got the
one<00:01:09.700> which<00:01:10.509> is<00:01:10.750> actual<00:01:11.259> video<00:01:11.619> that<00:01:11.950> one<00:01:12.700> is

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
one which is actual video that one is

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.800 
one which is actual video that one is
the<00:01:14.850> let's<00:01:15.850> see<00:01:16.030> if<00:01:16.090> that's<00:01:16.330> the<00:01:16.539> middle

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
the let's see if that's the middle

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.270 
the let's see if that's the middle
camera<00:01:17.380> to<00:01:17.740> the<00:01:18.130> right<00:01:19.030> of<00:01:19.360> the<00:01:19.869> LED<00:01:20.679> light<00:01:20.920> so

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
camera to the right of the LED light so

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:27.440 
camera to the right of the LED light so
it's<00:01:22.140> this<00:01:23.140> one<00:01:23.470> and<00:01:23.770> then<00:01:24.759> you<00:01:25.450> got<00:01:26.140> these<00:01:27.100> two

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
it's this one and then you got these two

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.690 
it's this one and then you got these two
got<00:01:28.450> the<00:01:28.600> outside<00:01:28.960> one<00:01:29.170> right<00:01:29.380> here<00:01:29.860> you<00:01:30.610> got

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
got the outside one right here you got

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.419 
got the outside one right here you got
the<00:01:30.850> other<00:01:30.940> one<00:01:31.149> over<00:01:31.240> here<00:01:31.420> which<00:01:32.319> is<00:01:32.890> this

00:01:33.419 --> 00:01:33.429 
the other one over here which is this

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:35.340 
the other one over here which is this
now<00:01:33.759> this<00:01:33.940> is<00:01:34.000> not<00:01:34.330> heat<00:01:34.659> this<00:01:34.899> is<00:01:35.020> actually

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
now this is not heat this is actually

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.980 
now this is not heat this is actually
distance<00:01:35.830> so<00:01:36.490> the<00:01:36.610> closer<00:01:36.909> I<00:01:37.119> bring<00:01:37.479> my<00:01:37.659> hand

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
distance so the closer I bring my hand

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:39.630 
distance so the closer I bring my hand
to<00:01:38.350> the<00:01:38.469> Kinect<00:01:38.740> sensor<00:01:39.100> the<00:01:39.219> darker<00:01:39.520> the

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
to the Kinect sensor the darker the

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.969 
to the Kinect sensor the darker the
color<00:01:39.670> the<00:01:40.360> farther<00:01:40.780> I<00:01:40.869> bring<00:01:41.200> it<00:01:41.350> back<00:01:41.380> the

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
color the farther I bring it back the

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:43.770 
color the farther I bring it back the
color<00:01:42.219> change<00:01:42.549> if<00:01:42.729> I<00:01:42.850> go<00:01:43.000> all<00:01:43.180> the<00:01:43.299> way<00:01:43.329> you<00:01:43.630> can

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
color change if I go all the way you can

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.179 
color change if I go all the way you can
see<00:01:43.960> my<00:01:44.079> back<00:01:44.289> wall<00:01:44.560> over<00:01:44.799> there<00:01:44.920> is<00:01:45.039> like<00:01:45.159> a

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:45.189 
see my back wall over there is like a

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:46.950 
see my back wall over there is like a
teal<00:01:45.460> color<00:01:45.610> as<00:01:46.479> -<00:01:46.630> because<00:01:46.780> it's<00:01:46.930> the

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
teal color as - because it's the

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.510 
teal color as - because it's the
farthest<00:01:47.380> away<00:01:47.500> from<00:01:47.619> the<00:01:47.890> Kinect<00:01:48.189> sensor

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
farthest away from the Kinect sensor

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.310 
farthest away from the Kinect sensor
that<00:01:48.640> I<00:01:48.729> could<00:01:48.939> read<00:01:49.149> so<00:01:49.840> there's<00:01:50.020> a<00:01:50.079> lot<00:01:50.289> of

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 
that I could read so there's a lot of

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.620 
that I could read so there's a lot of
things<00:01:50.530> I<00:01:50.740> can<00:01:50.890> end<00:01:51.039> up<00:01:51.130> doing<00:01:51.310> with<00:01:51.609> this<00:01:51.850> as

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
things I can end up doing with this as

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.069 
things I can end up doing with this as
of<00:01:52.899> now<00:01:53.079> I'm<00:01:53.380> actually<00:01:53.649> able<00:01:54.009> to<00:01:54.869> just<00:01:55.869> look

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:56.079 
of now I'm actually able to just look

00:01:56.079 --> 00:02:03.149 
of now I'm actually able to just look
better<00:01:56.289> tilt<00:01:57.039> the<00:01:57.189> camera<00:01:57.399> up<00:01:59.759> and<00:02:00.759> down<00:02:02.159> all

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:03.159 
better tilt the camera up and down all

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:08.279 
better tilt the camera up and down all
using<00:02:03.759> my<00:02:04.299> keyboard<00:02:04.570> it's<00:02:05.079> the<00:02:05.729> W<00:02:06.729> and<00:02:06.850> X<00:02:07.060> s<00:02:07.420> is

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
using my keyboard it's the W and X s is

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.830 
using my keyboard it's the W and X s is
auto-align<00:02:09.009> it'll<00:02:09.850> automatically<00:02:10.359> align<00:02:10.660> the

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
auto-align it'll automatically align the

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.170 
auto-align it'll automatically align the
camera<00:02:10.989> to<00:02:11.380> Center<00:02:11.730> there's<00:02:12.730> also<00:02:12.940> other

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
camera to Center there's also other

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.550 
camera to Center there's also other
things<00:02:13.420> you<00:02:13.570> can<00:02:13.750> do<00:02:13.900> I<00:02:13.930> don't<00:02:14.049> know<00:02:14.200> how<00:02:14.260> will

change<00:02:30.430> this<00:02:30.609> LED<00:02:31.060> color<00:02:31.390> I<00:02:31.750> don't<00:02:32.500> know<00:02:32.709> how

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
change this LED color I don't know how

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.470 
change this LED color I don't know how
well<00:02:33.100> you<00:02:33.130> guys<00:02:33.400> are<00:02:33.579> gonna<00:02:33.700> be<00:02:33.940> able<00:02:34.030> to<00:02:34.239> see

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
well you guys are gonna be able to see

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.800 
well you guys are gonna be able to see
that<00:02:34.690> there's<00:02:35.019> flashing<00:02:36.060> all<00:02:37.060> that's<00:02:37.420> with

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
that there's flashing all that's with

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.180 
that there's flashing all that's with
the<00:02:38.290> number<00:02:38.829> pad<00:02:39.069> 0<00:02:39.549> through<00:02:39.819> 6<00:02:40.060> changes<00:02:40.660> it<00:02:41.190> so

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
the number pad 0 through 6 changes it so

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.520 
the number pad 0 through 6 changes it so
that's<00:02:42.370> what<00:02:42.519> I<00:02:42.549> have<00:02:42.790> as<00:02:43.150> of<00:02:43.540> now<00:02:43.720> eventually

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
that's what I have as of now eventually

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
that's what I have as of now eventually
I'll<00:02:44.949> make<00:02:45.190> some<00:02:45.790> other<00:02:45.940> things

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
I'll make some other things

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.270 
I'll make some other things
plan<00:02:46.850> on<00:02:47.000> being<00:02:47.330> able<00:02:47.720> to<00:02:48.050> figure<00:02:48.440> out<00:02:48.710> speed

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
plan on being able to figure out speed

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.390 
plan on being able to figure out speed
of<00:02:49.490> an<00:02:49.580> object<00:02:49.810> based<00:02:50.810> on<00:02:51.050> the<00:02:51.290> color<00:02:51.650> and<00:02:51.980> over

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
of an object based on the color and over

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.050 
of an object based on the color and over
here<00:02:52.640> with<00:02:52.790> all<00:02:52.970> the<00:02:54.040> numbers<00:02:55.040> going<00:02:55.880> I'm

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
here with all the numbers going I'm

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.610 
here with all the numbers going I'm
pretty<00:02:56.360> sure<00:02:56.510> I<00:02:56.570> can<00:02:56.660> figure<00:02:56.990> out<00:02:57.260> if<00:02:57.470> I<00:02:57.560> do

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
pretty sure I can figure out if I do

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.740 
pretty sure I can figure out if I do
speed<00:02:58.160> equals<00:02:58.460> distance<00:02:58.520> over<00:02:58.850> time<00:02:59.030> if<00:02:59.630> I

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
speed equals distance over time if I

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.750 
speed equals distance over time if I
know<00:02:59.810> how<00:03:00.110> close<00:03:00.350> I<00:03:00.530> am<00:03:00.560> or<00:03:00.860> how<00:03:00.950> far<00:03:01.280> I<00:03:01.340> am<00:03:01.490> for

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
know how close I am or how far I am for

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.130 
know how close I am or how far I am for
the<00:03:01.850> sensor<00:03:02.240> depending<00:03:02.570> on<00:03:02.630> how<00:03:02.720> quickly<00:03:02.900> I

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
the sensor depending on how quickly I

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.720 
the sensor depending on how quickly I
got<00:03:03.410> there<00:03:03.620> I<00:03:03.650> can<00:03:03.830> figure<00:03:03.980> out<00:03:04.130> how<00:03:04.220> fast<00:03:04.550> an

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
got there I can figure out how fast an

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.670 
got there I can figure out how fast an
object<00:03:04.820> is<00:03:05.210> going<00:03:05.420> I<00:03:05.870> don't<00:03:06.350> know<00:03:06.470> what<00:03:06.590> it

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
object is going I don't know what it

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.170 
object is going I don't know what it
would<00:03:06.770> be<00:03:06.860> good<00:03:07.070> for<00:03:07.100> it's<00:03:07.490> not<00:03:07.610> like<00:03:07.730> a<00:03:07.760> police

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
would be good for it's not like a police

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.750 
would be good for it's not like a police
officer<00:03:08.600> is<00:03:08.660> gonna<00:03:08.810> carry<00:03:09.140> around<00:03:09.290> a<00:03:09.760> Kinect

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
officer is gonna carry around a Kinect

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.050 
officer is gonna carry around a Kinect
sensor<00:03:11.150> and<00:03:11.360> whatever<00:03:11.660> it<00:03:12.050> needs<00:03:12.320> but<00:03:12.740> uh<00:03:13.060> yeah

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
sensor and whatever it needs but uh yeah

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.490 
sensor and whatever it needs but uh yeah
I<00:03:14.090> plan<00:03:14.510> on<00:03:14.570> doing<00:03:14.690> a<00:03:14.960> bunch<00:03:15.170> of<00:03:15.260> other<00:03:15.410> things

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
I plan on doing a bunch of other things

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.380 
I plan on doing a bunch of other things

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
eventually that will probably release

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.870 
eventually that will probably release
this<00:03:21.170> I<00:03:21.410> don't<00:03:21.620> know<00:03:21.770> what<00:03:22.190> you<00:03:22.430> should<00:03:22.640> be<00:03:22.760> to
