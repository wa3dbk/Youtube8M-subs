00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:54.210
 psalms great love was violated 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.820
 common sunflower plants are not needed 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.100
 words when everything turns they come by themselves 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.589
 and I'll stay close to you even in the worst of times 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.540
 cases I will not be the best but you will know where 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:05.820

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.200
 that abandoned 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.590
 it is not the case for angry people to get excited 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.260
 accidents many spaces but between the low 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.450
 my soul to change the words thieves but 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.280
 my mouth would love but every door 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.800
 that you turn in my heart are jokes 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.050
 put everything you play into the game 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.640
 how I was someone else smile with 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.800

 torn the male soul I mica dies 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.790
 survives breathing that smell 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.920

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.320
 drop of dew on the leaf we are one 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.810
 merger and we cannot split but 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.340
 we can tighten up to touch 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:52.130
 the atmosphere that drives us here ok 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.290
 definitely nothing forever a deal 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.180
 the lesson but looking at the see 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:59.119
 exception will be a fixation 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:02.119
 surely but nothing detracts from mine 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:04.460
 mind I'm grotto never cooked and you for 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:06.619
 I don't know if I'm too hallucinated 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.160
 but I realized that my dream is 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:09.920
 came true 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:12.280
 because before I was dead and you never 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.280
 aroused 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.629
 we make the exchange we make an exchange 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.760
 fair 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:26.850
 take my life but don't make one 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.280
 waste 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:32.130
 everything that does not come back, stay close to me 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.350

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:42.150
 a lot of time goes by and with the wind love goes 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.940
 fading that unfortunately is not eternal 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.250

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.740

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:55.170
 against time sure that if it is different 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.090
 from they asked by saying of course will have a 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.770
 face under that mask you put on 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.410
 when everything is ready, he did 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:03.090
 exasperate a gram of your smile weighs 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.980
 as much as a kilo of gold and that is why 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.110
 that I will not share you with them 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.860
 changed girl home and church is done 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.930
 so much road 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.610
 the sultry suitcase now weighs as much as you do 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:15.560
 mirrors in certain sentences leaves out 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.560
 weight and time to make up
