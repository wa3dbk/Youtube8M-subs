00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
don't know what it is it's not good I

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.850 
don't know what it is it's not good I
don't<00:02:30.510> really<00:02:30.720> know<00:02:30.930> what<00:02:31.080> that<00:02:31.230> last<00:02:31.440> one<00:02:31.680> was

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
don't really know what that last one was

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.949 
don't really know what that last one was
and<00:02:32.280> it<00:02:32.700> might<00:02:32.880> be<00:02:33.000> cinnamon<00:02:33.570> it<00:02:33.750> didn't

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
and it might be cinnamon it didn't

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:35.810 
and it might be cinnamon it didn't
really<00:02:34.050> taste<00:02:34.380> like<00:02:34.530> cinnamon<00:02:34.800> to<00:02:35.130> me<00:02:35.280> but<00:02:35.580> I

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
really taste like cinnamon to me but I

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.060 
really taste like cinnamon to me but I
think<00:02:36.120> that's<00:02:36.420> what<00:02:36.570> it<00:02:36.660> was<00:02:36.840> so<00:02:37.080> anyway

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
think that's what it was so anyway

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:39.800 
think that's what it was so anyway
here's<00:02:38.280> another<00:02:38.550> red<00:02:38.790> one<00:02:38.850> it<00:02:39.120> was<00:02:39.330> kind<00:02:39.660> of<00:02:39.780> a

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
here's another red one it was kind of a

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.410 
here's another red one it was kind of a
little<00:02:39.959> bit<00:02:40.140> different<00:02:40.170> from<00:02:41.060> the<00:02:42.060> red<00:02:42.209> one<00:02:42.360> i

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
little bit different from the red one i

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:43.100 
little bit different from the red one i
just<00:02:42.450> had

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
just had

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.760 
just had
so<00:02:43.380> i<00:02:43.410> think<00:02:43.560> it's<00:02:43.770> a<00:02:43.830> different<00:02:44.070> flavor

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
so i think it's a different flavor

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.070 
so i think it's a different flavor
that's<00:02:46.770> cherry<00:02:47.070> okay<00:02:47.400> i<00:02:47.670> think<00:02:48.570> the<00:02:48.660> other<00:02:48.780> one

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
that's cherry okay i think the other one

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.380 
that's cherry okay i think the other one
was<00:02:49.110> cinnamon<00:02:49.739> okay<00:02:50.520> so<00:02:50.580> we're<00:02:50.880> done<00:02:51.030> with<00:02:51.239> the
