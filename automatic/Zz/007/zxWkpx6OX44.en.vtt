00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
that or try something else but this is

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.080 
that or try something else but this is
basically<00:01:07.040> just<00:01:07.159> a<00:01:07.430> way<00:01:07.460> to<00:01:07.610> like<00:01:07.850> come<00:01:08.060> up

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
basically just a way to like come up

basically just a way to like come up
with<00:01:08.180> any<00:01:08.450> kind<00:01:08.750> of<00:01:08.870> fast<00:01:09.680> thing<00:01:10.070> or<00:01:10.250> anything

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
with any kind of fast thing or anything

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.550 
with any kind of fast thing or anything
that's<00:01:10.700> like<00:01:10.880> sixteenth<00:01:11.450> notes<00:01:11.720> all<00:01:11.900> right

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
that's like sixteenth notes all right

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:23.030 
that's like sixteenth notes all right
I<00:01:19.880> mean<00:01:20.880> it's<00:01:21.000> really<00:01:21.240> it's<00:01:21.770> boneheads<00:01:22.770> but<00:01:23.010> I

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
I mean it's really it's boneheads but I

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.530 
I mean it's really it's boneheads but I
mean<00:01:23.310> that<00:01:23.490> in<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.640> right<00:01:23.820> place<00:01:24.060> could<00:01:24.300> sound

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
mean that in the right place could sound

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.090 
mean that in the right place could sound
cool<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:25.110> what's<00:01:25.410> more<00:01:25.590> important<00:01:25.950> than<00:01:26.040> that

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
cool and what's more important than that

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:35.050 
cool and what's more important than that
is<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.490> concept<00:01:27.090> I'm<00:01:27.570> doing<00:01:27.930> something<00:01:28.170> like

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.170 

I<00:01:35.229> mean<00:01:36.229> it's<00:01:36.380> really<00:01:36.560> not<00:01:36.860> anything<00:01:37.490> but<00:01:37.970> like

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
I mean it's really not anything but like

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.120 
I mean it's really not anything but like
it<00:01:38.450> gets<00:01:38.780> the<00:01:38.990> point<00:01:39.229> across<00:01:39.350> that<00:01:39.799> you<00:01:39.920> want

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
it gets the point across that you want

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:46.500 
it gets the point across that you want
obviously<00:01:40.700> you<00:01:40.760> can<00:01:40.909> do<00:01:41.000> it<00:01:41.119> everywhere

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:46.510 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:49.230 

you<00:01:47.410> can<00:01:47.590> make<00:01:47.950> variations<00:01:48.310> on<00:01:48.700> the<00:01:48.790> fingering

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
you can make variations on the fingering

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.980 
you can make variations on the fingering
and<00:01:49.390> stuff<00:01:49.770> just<00:01:50.770> totally<00:01:51.400> random<00:01:51.580> so<00:01:52.390> I'm<00:01:52.660> a

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
and stuff just totally random so I'm a

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.290 
and stuff just totally random so I'm a
lot<00:01:53.920> of<00:01:53.980> the<00:01:54.160> stuff<00:01:54.400> you<00:01:54.430> have<00:01:54.790> to<00:01:54.910> find<00:01:55.120> out

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.300 
lot of the stuff you have to find out

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.900 
lot of the stuff you have to find out
what's<00:01:55.480> comfortable<00:01:55.750> for<00:01:56.050> you<00:01:56.410> and<00:01:56.910> that's

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:57.910 
what's comfortable for you and that's

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.390 
what's comfortable for you and that's
where<00:01:58.240> you<00:01:58.360> find<00:01:58.870> your<00:01:59.050> own<00:01:59.110> identity<00:01:59.260> if<00:02:00.250> you

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.400 
where you find your own identity if you

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.490 
where you find your own identity if you
just<00:02:00.610> copy<00:02:00.910> other<00:02:01.120> guys<00:02:01.360> who<00:02:02.170> are<00:02:02.260> doing

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
just copy other guys who are doing

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.800 
just copy other guys who are doing
things<00:02:03.100> that<00:02:03.190> you<00:02:03.370> like<00:02:03.580> that's<00:02:04.120> fine

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
things that you like that's fine

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.080 
things that you like that's fine
because<00:02:05.740> you<00:02:05.860> want<00:02:06.040> to<00:02:06.100> see<00:02:06.250> how<00:02:06.400> things<00:02:06.760> tick

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
because you want to see how things tick

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.330 
because you want to see how things tick
but<00:02:07.330> I<00:02:07.360> think<00:02:07.660> you'll<00:02:08.080> get<00:02:08.290> more<00:02:08.530> results<00:02:08.980> if

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
but I think you'll get more results if

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.090 
but I think you'll get more results if
you<00:02:09.850> just<00:02:10.230> experiment<00:02:11.230> with<00:02:11.320> things<00:02:11.710> that<00:02:11.860> are

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
you just experiment with things that are

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.340 
you just experiment with things that are
easy<00:02:12.280> for<00:02:12.430> your<00:02:12.940> particular<00:02:13.420> fingers<00:02:14.110> and<00:02:14.260> the

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
easy for your particular fingers and the

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:15.810 
easy for your particular fingers and the
way<00:02:14.470> you<00:02:14.530> hold<00:02:14.980> your<00:02:15.160> pick<00:02:15.370> and<00:02:15.550> all<00:02:15.610> that

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
way you hold your pick and all that

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.030 
way you hold your pick and all that
stuff<00:02:16.120> and<00:02:16.360> you'd<00:02:16.870> be<00:02:17.020> surprised<00:02:17.530> what<00:02:17.830> you

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
stuff and you'd be surprised what you

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.080 
stuff and you'd be surprised what you
find<00:02:18.340> so<00:02:18.610> I'm<00:02:19.300> there's<00:02:19.810> that<00:02:20.200> so<00:02:21.070> what<00:02:21.970> I<00:02:22.000> did

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
find so I'm there's that so what I did

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.510 
find so I'm there's that so what I did
here<00:02:22.720> was<00:02:22.750> I<00:02:23.260> played<00:02:23.500> the<00:02:23.680> same<00:02:23.920> exact<00:02:24.310> pattern

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
here was I played the same exact pattern

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:36.640 
here was I played the same exact pattern
with<00:02:24.880> a<00:02:24.910> little<00:02:25.270> bonehead<00:02:25.750> variation<00:02:26.380> to<00:02:26.560> it

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.970 

so<00:02:37.650> that<00:02:37.800> phrase<00:02:38.040> I<00:02:38.190> just<00:02:38.400> played<00:02:38.670> obviously

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
so that phrase I just played obviously

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.410 
so that phrase I just played obviously
see<00:02:40.980> would<00:02:41.190> be<00:02:41.220> the<00:02:41.340> place<00:02:41.700> that<00:02:42.030> normally

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
see would be the place that normally

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:53.010 
see would be the place that normally
could<00:02:42.660> play

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.020 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.990 

that'd<00:02:53.470> be<00:02:53.500> the<00:02:53.740> obvious<00:02:53.890> place<00:02:54.430> to<00:02:54.460> play<00:02:54.850> it

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
that'd be the obvious place to play it

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.140 
that'd be the obvious place to play it
but<00:02:55.590> if<00:02:56.590> you<00:02:56.770> use<00:02:57.010> your<00:02:57.160> noodle<00:02:57.370> right<00:02:57.670> here<00:02:57.970> if

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
but if you use your noodle right here if

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.440 
but if you use your noodle right here if
you're<00:02:58.300> right<00:02:58.480> here<00:02:59.820> kind<00:03:00.820> of<00:03:00.880> looks<00:03:01.060> like<00:03:01.120> a

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
you're right here kind of looks like a

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:12.530 
you're right here kind of looks like a
doesn't<00:03:01.900> it<00:03:01.990> and<00:03:02.170> so<00:03:02.920> I'm

and<00:04:28.220> they<00:04:28.760> make<00:04:29.000> them<00:04:29.180> a<00:04:29.419> little<00:04:29.900> bit<00:04:30.050> more

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:30.230 
and they make them a little bit more

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:32.080 
and they make them a little bit more
interesting<00:04:30.800> so<00:04:31.220> if<00:04:31.430> you<00:04:31.550> take<00:04:31.790> everybody

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
interesting so if you take everybody

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.159 
interesting so if you take everybody
does<00:04:33.790> everybody<00:04:34.790> does<00:04:35.060> this<00:04:35.300> blues<00:04:35.720> pattern

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:36.169 
does everybody does this blues pattern

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:37.510 
does everybody does this blues pattern
right<00:04:36.320> there<00:04:36.530> but<00:04:36.710> there's<00:04:36.860> a<00:04:36.950> whole<00:04:37.190> bunch<00:04:37.370> of

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 
right there but there's a whole bunch of

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:38.890 
right there but there's a whole bunch of
notes<00:04:37.730> in<00:04:37.910> between<00:04:37.940> there<00:04:38.570> that<00:04:38.780> you<00:04:38.870> should

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
notes in between there that you should

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:49.589 
notes in between there that you should
be<00:04:39.290> using<00:04:43.870> that<00:04:44.870> type<00:04:45.110> of<00:04:45.140> thing<00:04:45.470> so

00:04:49.589 --> 00:04:49.599 

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:55.830 

let's<00:04:50.599> analyze<00:04:50.809> that<00:04:51.199> for<00:04:51.349> a<00:04:51.409> second

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:03.950 

so<00:04:56.620> fern<00:04:56.830> be<00:04:57.130> the<00:04:58.120> most<00:04:58.330> guys<00:04:58.510> are<00:04:58.720> going

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.840 

most<00:05:04.470> guys<00:05:04.620> are<00:05:04.830> doing<00:05:05.040> that<00:05:05.220> but<00:05:05.610> there's<00:05:05.790> a

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:05.850 
most guys are doing that but there's a

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:07.280 
most guys are doing that but there's a
million<00:05:06.120> more<00:05:06.390> notes<00:05:06.600> that<00:05:06.780> I<00:05:06.870> want<00:05:07.050> you<00:05:07.200> to

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:07.290 
million more notes that I want you to

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:09.140 
million more notes that I want you to
hit<00:05:07.440> in<00:05:07.620> there<00:05:07.830> now<00:05:08.250> how<00:05:08.490> you<00:05:08.550> hit<00:05:08.880> them<00:05:09.030> is

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
hit in there now how you hit them is

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.390 
hit in there now how you hit them is
your<00:05:09.360> business<00:05:09.630> but<00:05:09.840> like<00:05:10.170> a<00:05:10.200> real<00:05:10.560> basic

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 
your business but like a real basic

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.100 
your business but like a real basic
example<00:05:11.820> I'll<00:05:11.880> play<00:05:12.120> slowly<00:05:12.510> something<00:05:12.960> like

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110 
example I'll play slowly something like

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:19.709 
example I'll play slowly something like
this

00:05:19.709 --> 00:05:19.719 

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:22.689 

something<00:05:20.719> like<00:05:20.870> that<00:05:21.139> so<00:05:21.919> that<00:05:22.159> is<00:05:22.400> the<00:05:22.580> way

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:22.699 
something like that so that is the way

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:24.369 
something like that so that is the way
you<00:05:22.759> should<00:05:22.909> approach<00:05:23.509> this<00:05:23.900> whole<00:05:24.110> like

00:05:24.369 --> 00:05:24.379 
you should approach this whole like

00:05:24.379 --> 00:05:26.589 
you should approach this whole like
normal<00:05:24.949> blues<00:05:25.219> section<00:05:25.729> is<00:05:25.909> not<00:05:26.090> like<00:05:26.419> the

00:05:26.589 --> 00:05:26.599 
normal blues section is not like the

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:29.170 
normal blues section is not like the
normal<00:05:27.400> thing<00:05:28.400> that<00:05:28.430> you<00:05:28.610> hear<00:05:28.759> everywhere

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:29.180 
normal thing that you hear everywhere

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:30.850 
normal thing that you hear everywhere
but<00:05:29.360> there's<00:05:29.509> a<00:05:29.599> lot<00:05:29.810> of<00:05:29.930> notes<00:05:30.080> in<00:05:30.259> between<00:05:30.650> so

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:30.860 
but there's a lot of notes in between so

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:32.559 
but there's a lot of notes in between so
that<00:05:30.889> the<00:05:31.159> main<00:05:31.400> one<00:05:31.669> that<00:05:31.909> really<00:05:32.090> easiest

00:05:32.559 --> 00:05:32.569 
that the main one that really easiest

00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:35.700 
that the main one that really easiest
one<00:05:32.719> to<00:05:32.750> understand<00:05:33.379> is<00:05:33.729> something<00:05:34.729> like<00:05:34.879> this

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:35.710 
one to understand is something like this

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:40.540 
one to understand is something like this
everybody<00:05:36.710> knows<00:05:36.889> these<00:05:39.069> but<00:05:40.069> let's<00:05:40.250> put<00:05:40.400> this

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:40.550 
everybody knows these but let's put this

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:44.480 
everybody knows these but let's put this
in<00:05:40.759> here

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:44.490 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:49.820 

so<00:05:45.419> you<00:05:45.479> put<00:05:45.690> this<00:05:45.840> note

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:49.830 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:51.350 

you<00:05:50.220> put<00:05:50.430> those<00:05:50.580> notes<00:05:50.790> in<00:05:51.030> there<00:05:51.180> and<00:05:51.270> then

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:51.360 
you put those notes in there and then

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.920 
you put those notes in there and then
you<00:05:51.450> have<00:05:52.940> but<00:05:53.940> of<00:05:54.060> course<00:05:54.360> we've<00:05:54.630> got<00:05:54.660> this

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:54.930 
you have but of course we've got this

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:56.330 
you have but of course we've got this
whole<00:05:55.110> string<00:05:55.440> that<00:05:55.560> we<00:05:55.650> could<00:05:55.830> be<00:05:55.920> using<00:05:56.070> as

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:56.340 
whole string that we could be using as

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:03.860 
whole string that we could be using as
well<00:05:56.490> like<00:05:57.000> this<00:06:01.910> so<00:06:02.910> let's<00:06:03.120> just<00:06:03.360> alternate

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:03.870 
well like this so let's just alternate

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:06.890 
well like this so let's just alternate
this<00:06:04.080> and<00:06:04.230> put<00:06:04.350> them<00:06:04.440> together<00:06:04.560> like<00:06:04.710> this
