level<00:02:03.290> in<00:02:03.380> the<00:02:03.470> water<00:02:03.680> and<00:02:04.430> that's<00:02:04.640> what<00:02:04.760> just

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
level in the water and that's what just

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:05.690 
level in the water and that's what just
makes<00:02:05.119> these

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
makes these

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.779 
makes these
Celso<00:02:06.060> nice<00:02:06.329> they<00:02:07.020> have<00:02:07.140> a<00:02:07.229> eighty<00:02:07.789> seventy

six inch bottom the eighty nine and a
half<00:02:10.500> inch<00:02:10.830> beam<00:02:11.099> so<00:02:11.849> it<00:02:11.910> makes<00:02:12.060> it<00:02:12.180> really

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
half inch beam so it makes it really

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.699 
half inch beam so it makes it really
nice<00:02:12.660> in<00:02:12.900> the<00:02:12.959> water<00:02:13.170> I've<00:02:13.290> got<00:02:13.410> a<00:02:13.440> lot<00:02:13.680> of

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
nice in the water I've got a lot of

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:16.970 
nice in the water I've got a lot of
displacement<00:02:14.370> on<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:14.519> water<00:02:14.840> but<00:02:15.840> we<00:02:15.930> and<00:02:16.200> the

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
displacement on the water but we and the

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.520 
displacement on the water but we and the
20<00:02:17.340> XL<00:02:17.790> was<00:02:18.000> so<00:02:18.150> popular<00:02:18.480> for<00:02:18.720> so<00:02:19.050> long<00:02:19.260> we

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
20 XL was so popular for so long we

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.680 
20 XL was so popular for so long we
thought<00:02:19.709> about<00:02:19.860> why<00:02:20.489> not<00:02:20.700> build<00:02:20.910> a<00:02:21.090> small<00:02:21.390> boat

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
thought about why not build a small boat

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.320 
thought about why not build a small boat
a<00:02:21.959> smaller<00:02:22.470> version<00:02:22.920> of<00:02:22.950> the<00:02:23.069> XL<00:02:23.459> to<00:02:23.970> get<00:02:24.120> into

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
a smaller version of the XL to get into

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.680 
a smaller version of the XL to get into
some<00:02:24.510> of<00:02:24.540> those<00:02:24.690> smaller<00:02:25.080> rivers<00:02:26.510> some<00:02:27.510> of<00:02:27.630> the

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
some of those smaller rivers some of the

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.390 
some of those smaller rivers some of the
smaller<00:02:27.930> rivers<00:02:28.319> that<00:02:28.470> don't<00:02:28.739> necessarily

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.160 

accept<00:02:32.400> the<00:02:32.519> 20-foot<00:02:33.090> boat<00:02:33.390> you<00:02:33.690> know<00:02:33.810> not

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
accept the 20-foot boat you know not

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.660 
accept the 20-foot boat you know not
that<00:02:34.349> those<00:02:34.440> rivers<00:02:34.769> can't<00:02:35.010> have<00:02:35.160> a<00:02:35.190> 20-foot

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
that those rivers can't have a 20-foot

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.110 
that those rivers can't have a 20-foot
boat<00:02:35.940> but<00:02:36.269> maybe<00:02:37.260> in<00:02:37.470> terms<00:02:37.709> of<00:02:38.190> the<00:02:38.760> local

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
boat but maybe in terms of the local

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.449 
boat but maybe in terms of the local
community<00:02:39.630> and<00:02:39.870> what's<00:02:40.680> accepted<00:02:41.160> and<00:02:41.310> what's

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
community and what's accepted and what's

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:45.050 
community and what's accepted and what's
not<00:02:41.670> so<00:02:42.560> perfect<00:02:43.560> boat<00:02:43.739> for<00:02:43.769> a<00:02:44.040> 17<00:02:44.519> foot<00:02:44.760> length

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
not so perfect boat for a 17 foot length

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.330 
not so perfect boat for a 17 foot length
you<00:02:45.690> can<00:02:45.840> side<00:02:46.110> drift<00:02:46.380> down<00:02:46.530> a<00:02:46.560> bit<00:02:46.799> pull<00:02:47.069> plugs

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
you can side drift down a bit pull plugs

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.370 
you can side drift down a bit pull plugs
guess<00:02:47.760> it's<00:02:48.000> super<00:02:48.360> level<00:02:48.630> in<00:02:48.720> the<00:02:48.810> water<00:02:48.989> and

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
guess it's super level in the water and

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.699 
guess it's super level in the water and
because<00:02:50.130> it<00:02:50.280> is<00:02:50.400> a<00:02:50.430> 17<00:02:50.940> foot<00:02:51.180> boat<00:02:51.450> I'm<00:02:52.260> able<00:02:52.620> to

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
because it is a 17 foot boat I'm able to

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.800 
because it is a 17 foot boat I'm able to
put<00:02:52.980> a<00:02:53.010> 115<00:02:53.730> and<00:02:54.030> that's<00:02:54.299> 80<00:02:54.540> horsepower

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
put a 115 and that's 80 horsepower

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.170 
put a 115 and that's 80 horsepower
through<00:02:55.410> the<00:02:55.500> jet<00:02:55.709> on<00:02:55.950> the<00:02:55.980> back<00:02:56.610> of<00:02:56.790> this<00:02:56.940> and

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
through the jet on the back of this and

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.380 
through the jet on the back of this and
get<00:02:57.540> Plitt<00:02:57.900> plenty<00:02:58.410> of<00:02:58.530> power<00:02:59.180> perfect<00:03:00.180> for

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
get Plitt plenty of power perfect for

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.170 
get Plitt plenty of power perfect for
for<00:03:00.900> three<00:03:01.260> guys<00:03:01.500> side<00:03:01.950> drifting<00:03:02.489> or<00:03:02.670> whatnot
