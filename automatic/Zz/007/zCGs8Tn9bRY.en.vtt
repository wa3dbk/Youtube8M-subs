00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
years start thinking about possibility

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.399 
years start thinking about possibility
of<00:01:00.000> them<00:01:00.180> developing<00:01:00.809> some<00:01:01.170> some<00:01:01.890> diseases

heart<00:01:29.159> folk<00:01:29.400> really<00:01:29.670> halfway<00:01:30.630> between<00:01:30.960> that

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
heart folk really halfway between that

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.499 
heart folk really halfway between that
and<00:01:31.590> your<00:01:31.729> vaccinations<00:01:32.729> get<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.060> right<00:01:33.270> guy

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
and we'll have a look at things like I'm

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.530 
and we'll have a look at things like I'm
suddenly<00:01:35.700> have<00:01:35.909> a<00:01:35.939> good<00:01:36.090> listen<00:01:36.299> to<00:01:36.390> their

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540

chest and whatnot tongue and well
sometimes<00:01:39.509> also<00:01:39.930> do<00:01:40.970> survey<00:01:41.970> x-rays<00:01:42.420> at<00:01:43.020> their

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
sometimes also do survey x-rays at their

chest especially looking to the size of
a<00:01:45.090> half<00:01:45.360> clear<00:01:45.990> because<00:01:46.860> certainly<00:01:47.159> a<00:01:47.220> lot<00:01:47.340> of

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
a half clear because certainly a lot of

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:48.460 
a half clear because certainly a lot of
those<00:01:47.549> disease

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
those disease

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.399 
those disease
catch<00:01:48.620> them<00:01:48.860> early<00:01:49.010> enough<00:01:49.220> they<00:01:49.730> can

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.380 

you<00:01:52.979> can<00:01:53.189> certainly<00:01:53.399> do<00:01:53.640> a<00:01:53.670> lot<00:01:53.909> better<00:01:54.060> job

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
you can certainly do a lot better job

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.190 
you can certainly do a lot better job
than<00:01:54.780> treating<00:01:55.109> them<00:01:55.399> early<00:01:56.399> okay<00:01:57.170> like<00:01:58.170> that

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
than treating them early okay like that

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.899 
than treating them early okay like that
saying<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:58.920> kidney<00:01:59.249> disease<00:01:59.579> and<00:01:59.789> things

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
saying the kidney disease and things

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.169 
saying the kidney disease and things
like<00:01:59.999> that<00:02:00.060> you<00:02:00.329> can<00:02:00.600> always<00:02:01.759> find<00:02:02.759> that<00:02:03.000> on<00:02:03.149> a

00:02:03.169 --> 00:02:03.179 
like that you can always find that on a
