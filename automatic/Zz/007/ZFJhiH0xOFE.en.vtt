you know it's still up in there about
that<00:04:12.380> but<00:04:12.590> i<00:04:12.620> think<00:04:12.680> is<00:04:13.070> it's<00:04:13.670> one<00:04:13.820> of<00:04:13.850> the

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
that but i think is it's one of the

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.000 
that but i think is it's one of the
things<00:04:13.970> that<00:04:14.090> it's<00:04:14.300> not<00:04:14.420> too<00:04:14.600> big<00:04:14.840> but<00:04:15.590> it's

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
things that it's not too big but it's

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:17.409 
things that it's not too big but it's
big<00:04:16.130> enough<00:04:16.160> so<00:04:16.640> i<00:04:16.669> think<00:04:16.760> i<00:04:16.910> think<00:04:17.090> the<00:04:17.269> lady

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:17.419 
big enough so i think i think the lady

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:19.479 
big enough so i think i think the lady
she'll<00:04:17.720> like<00:04:17.870> that<00:04:17.900> but<00:04:18.260> let<00:04:18.440> go<00:04:18.590> yeah<00:04:19.220> our<00:04:19.370> own
