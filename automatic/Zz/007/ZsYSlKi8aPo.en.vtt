00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
had four options so we had a thing where

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.580 
had four options so we had a thing where
we<00:00:29.460> would<00:00:30.119> make<00:00:30.330> what's<00:00:30.599> called<00:00:30.660> a<00:00:30.960> hex<00:00:31.199> blade

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
we would make what's called a hex blade

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.380 
we would make what's called a hex blade
that<00:00:31.890> made<00:00:32.009> all<00:00:32.040> six<00:00:32.430> off<00:00:32.669> and<00:00:33.000> but<00:00:33.180> you<00:00:33.270> got<00:00:33.360> to

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
that made all six off and but you got to

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.450 
that made all six off and but you got to
magnetize<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.079> heck<00:00:34.500> out<00:00:34.680> of<00:00:34.710> it<00:00:34.860> and<00:00:34.950> this<00:00:35.309> is

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
magnetize the heck out of it and this is

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.110 
magnetize the heck out of it and this is
not<00:00:35.670> that<00:00:35.910> this<00:00:36.149> only<00:00:36.329> has<00:00:36.600> two<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:37.879> but<00:00:38.879> it

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
not that this only has two and but it

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.729 
not that this only has two and but it
does<00:00:39.329> magnetize<00:00:40.050> these<00:00:40.290> little<00:00:40.500> turret

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
does magnetize these little turret

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.060 
does magnetize these little turret
things<00:00:40.950> you<00:00:41.129> can<00:00:41.250> see<00:00:41.430> by<00:00:41.610> these<00:00:43.070> heavy

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
flamers and then of course the turret

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.560 
flamers and then of course the turret
which<00:00:46.920> I<00:00:47.039> will<00:00:47.190> not<00:00:47.579> be<00:00:47.789> able<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:48.030> change<00:00:48.270> with

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
which I will not be able to change with

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.510 
which I will not be able to change with
one<00:00:48.840> hand<00:00:49.110> but<00:00:49.379> it<00:00:49.559> is<00:00:49.710> changeable<00:00:50.190> it<00:00:50.340> does

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
one hand but it is changeable it does

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.250 
one hand but it is changeable it does
pull<00:00:50.730> out<00:00:50.910> got<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.600> be<00:00:51.690> gentle<00:00:51.899> with<00:00:52.199> it

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
pull out got to be gentle with it

there's<00:00:52.559> a<00:00:52.620> big<00:00:52.920> ol<00:00:53.190> magnet<00:00:53.730> in<00:00:53.850> there<00:00:54.030> that

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
there's a big ol magnet in there that

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.299 
there's a big ol magnet in there that
kind<00:00:54.329> of<00:00:54.360> holds<00:00:55.050> it<00:00:55.350> in<00:00:55.469> place<00:00:56.239> so<00:00:57.890> so<00:00:58.890> here's

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
kind of holds it in place so so here's

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:05.210 
kind of holds it in place so so here's
the<00:00:59.520> deal<00:01:00.379> so<00:01:01.760> the<00:01:02.760> bane<00:01:03.059> blade<00:01:03.420> kit<00:01:04.220> actually

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
the deal so the bane blade kit actually

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.670 
the deal so the bane blade kit actually
was<00:01:05.430> originally<00:01:05.909> made<00:01:06.060> by<00:01:06.119> forgeworld<00:01:06.720> when

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
was originally made by forgeworld when

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.500 
was originally made by forgeworld when
they<00:01:07.770> came<00:01:07.920> out<00:01:08.040> with<00:01:08.100> epic<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:09.180> I<00:01:09.240> think<00:01:09.420> that

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
they came out with epic and I think that

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.090 
they came out with epic and I think that
was<00:01:09.630> in<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.810> late<00:01:09.960> 90s<00:01:10.530> they<00:01:10.710> had<00:01:10.890> this<00:01:11.040> big

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
was in the late 90s they had this big

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.330 
was in the late 90s they had this big
tank<00:01:11.610> in<00:01:11.850> there<00:01:12.510> or<00:01:12.750> technically<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:13.830> medium

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
tank in there or technically a medium

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.219 
tank in there or technically a medium
size<00:01:14.610> tank<00:01:14.939> because<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.150> Imperium<00:01:15.689> has<00:01:15.900> like

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
size tank because the Imperium has like

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.999 
size tank because the Imperium has like
huge<00:01:17.130> Cathedral<00:01:17.880> sized<00:01:18.150> you<00:01:18.689> know<00:01:19.009> dreaded

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
huge Cathedral sized you know dreaded

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.160 
huge Cathedral sized you know dreaded
buildings<00:01:21.020> so<00:01:22.880> basically<00:01:23.880> so<00:01:24.420> immediately

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
buildings so basically so immediately

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.660 
buildings so basically so immediately
people<00:01:25.500> started<00:01:25.799> scratch-building<00:01:26.549> them

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
people started scratch-building them

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.060 
people started scratch-building them
making<00:01:26.880> homebrew<00:01:27.479> rules<00:01:28.070> forgeworld

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
making homebrew rules forgeworld

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.649 
making homebrew rules forgeworld
obviously<00:01:29.729> came<00:01:29.909> out<00:01:30.030> with<00:01:30.150> a<00:01:30.180> resin<00:01:30.630> one<00:01:30.810> and

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 
obviously came out with a resin one and

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:35.690 
obviously came out with a resin one and
so<00:01:33.659> and<00:01:33.930> then<00:01:34.049> and<00:01:34.290> then<00:01:34.470> later<00:01:34.740> I<00:01:35.159> think<00:01:35.640> it

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
so and then and then later I think it

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.399 
so and then and then later I think it
was<00:01:35.820> like<00:01:35.880> 2008<00:01:36.630> you<00:01:36.810> ended<00:01:37.049> up<00:01:37.140> with<00:01:37.170> your

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
was like 2008 you ended up with your

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.289 
was like 2008 you ended up with your
first<00:01:37.560> plastic<00:01:38.159> bein<00:01:38.369> blade<00:01:38.670> kit<00:01:38.909> which<00:01:39.090> was

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
first plastic bein blade kit which was

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.270 
first plastic bein blade kit which was
was<00:01:39.840> a<00:01:39.869> real<00:01:40.110> treat<00:01:40.470> but<00:01:40.650> it<00:01:40.740> was<00:01:40.860> still<00:01:41.070> kind

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
was a real treat but it was still kind

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.740 
was a real treat but it was still kind
of<00:01:41.310> like<00:01:41.460> ask<00:01:41.670> your<00:01:41.970> opponent<00:01:42.150> permission

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
of like ask your opponent permission

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.300 
of like ask your opponent permission
they<00:01:43.259> were<00:01:43.350> like<00:01:43.500> five<00:01:43.799> or<00:01:43.979> six<00:01:44.189> hundred

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
they were like five or six hundred

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.190 
they were like five or six hundred
points<00:01:44.640> so<00:01:44.909> very<00:01:45.149> unwieldy<00:01:45.479> but<00:01:45.869> now<00:01:46.020> that

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
points so very unwieldy but now that

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.780 
points so very unwieldy but now that
apocalypse<00:01:46.799> has<00:01:46.920> become<00:01:47.159> like<00:01:47.369> an<00:01:47.490> everyday

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.889 
to be that that size so this is uh this
is<00:02:01.530> a<00:02:01.860> level<00:02:02.490> 4<00:02:03.170> shadow<00:02:04.170> sword<00:02:04.590> Stormlord<00:02:05.430> what

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:05.899 
is a level 4 shadow sword Stormlord what

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:08.330 
is a level 4 shadow sword Stormlord what
so<00:02:06.899> this<00:02:07.140> might<00:02:07.320> this<00:02:07.350> might<00:02:07.530> actually<00:02:07.890> be<00:02:08.129> the

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
so this might this might actually be the

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.850 
so this might this might actually be the
second<00:02:08.759> one<00:02:08.910> that<00:02:09.060> they<00:02:09.209> made<00:02:09.390> so<00:02:09.690> anyway<00:02:10.020> ok

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
second one that they made so anyway ok

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.000 
second one that they made so anyway ok
let's<00:02:11.129> continue<00:02:11.220> so

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
let's continue so

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.589 
let's continue so
reading<00:02:13.580> up<00:02:13.670> and<00:02:13.819> apparently<00:02:14.030> now<00:02:14.390> there's

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:14.599 
reading up and apparently now there's

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:18.429 
reading up and apparently now there's
ten<00:02:14.959> variants<00:02:15.620> that<00:02:16.459> include<00:02:17.299> a<00:02:17.329> couple<00:02:18.170> that

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
can already see how this works so this

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.110 
can already see how this works so this
bad<00:02:47.060> girl<00:02:47.329> right<00:02:47.629> here<00:02:47.870> this<00:02:48.079> thing<00:02:48.379> oh<00:02:49.120> yeah

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
bad girl right here this thing oh yeah

bad girl right here this thing oh yeah
this<00:02:50.989> is<00:02:51.260> a<00:02:51.310> Vulcan<00:02:52.310> mega<00:02:52.849> bolter<00:02:53.359> and<00:02:53.680> can

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
this is a Vulcan mega bolter and can

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.069 
this is a Vulcan mega bolter and can
fire<00:02:54.859> twice<00:02:55.220> of<00:02:55.489> the<00:02:55.579> tanks<00:02:55.909> it's<00:02:56.150> still<00:02:56.420> so<00:02:56.780> I

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:57.079 
fire twice of the tanks it's still so I

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:00.280 
fire twice of the tanks it's still so I
do<00:02:57.950> believe<00:02:58.340> that's<00:02:58.519> 20<00:02:58.970> shots<00:02:59.239> per<00:02:59.629> round<00:02:59.870> and

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
do believe that's 20 shots per round and

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:05.399 
do believe that's 20 shots per round and
it<00:03:01.220> is<00:03:01.340> it<00:03:01.609> is<00:03:01.790> not<00:03:02.060> fun<00:03:02.780> and<00:03:04.030> yeah<00:03:05.030> and

it is it is not fun and yeah and

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:08.199 
it is it is not fun and yeah and
apparently<00:03:06.409> it's<00:03:06.920> also<00:03:07.159> a<00:03:07.280> transport<00:03:07.849> so

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
apparently it's also a transport so

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:09.699 
apparently it's also a transport so
correct<00:03:08.569> me<00:03:08.629> if<00:03:08.780> I'm<00:03:08.900> wrong<00:03:08.930> on<00:03:09.260> that<00:03:09.290> one<00:03:09.440> I

metallics<00:04:09.379> on<00:04:09.500> them<00:04:09.650> because<00:04:09.829> eldar<00:04:10.190> you

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
metallics on them because eldar you

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.420 
metallics on them because eldar you

psycho reactive plastics to build their

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.680 
psycho reactive plastics to build their
machinery<00:04:14.090> so<00:04:15.099> you<00:04:16.099> usually<00:04:16.940> don't<00:04:17.239> see<00:04:17.359> metal

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
machinery so you usually don't see metal

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.899 
machinery so you usually don't see metal

doing this you definitely want

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:28.480 
doing this you definitely want
scatter<00:04:27.050> laser<00:04:27.350> there's<00:04:27.650> really<00:04:27.980> no<00:04:28.340> other

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 
scatter laser there's really no other

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:29.830

what they're called offhand but these

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:41.710 
what they're called offhand but these
things<00:04:40.030> and<00:04:41.030> they<00:04:41.150> can<00:04:41.270> have<00:04:41.360> two<00:04:41.540> of<00:04:41.660> these

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720 
things and they can have two of these

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.510 
things and they can have two of these
strengths<00:04:42.290> ten<00:04:42.590> like<00:04:42.770> a<00:04:42.800> d<00:04:43.040> weapon<00:04:43.430> or

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 
strengths ten like a d weapon or

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:48.100 
strengths ten like a d weapon or
whatever<00:04:43.790> and<00:04:46.090> so<00:04:47.090> then<00:04:47.360> you<00:04:47.510> just<00:04:47.690> fire<00:04:47.870> these

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 
whatever and so then you just fire these

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:49.630 
whatever and so then you just fire these
are<00:04:48.530> the<00:04:48.590> two<00:04:48.770> weapons<00:04:49.130> so<00:04:49.250> you<00:04:49.310> have<00:04:49.460> like

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:49.640 
are the two weapons so you have like

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.360 
are the two weapons so you have like
these<00:04:49.820> two<00:04:50.120> or<00:04:50.510> you've<00:04:51.350> got<00:04:51.590> this<00:04:51.830> one<00:04:52.100> and

these two or you've got this one and

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:53.680 
these two or you've got this one and
then<00:04:52.460> this<00:04:52.520> up<00:04:52.850> top<00:04:53.060> that's<00:04:53.360> really<00:04:53.600> your

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:53.690 
then this up top that's really your

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:55.600 
then this up top that's really your
option<00:04:54.080> most<00:04:54.620> people<00:04:54.890> don't<00:04:55.010> take<00:04:55.190> the<00:04:55.250> sword

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:55.610

have a bunch of magnetized piece is down

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.360 
have a bunch of magnetized piece is down
here<00:05:01.850> quite<00:05:02.480> frankly<00:05:02.740> like<00:05:03.740> a<00:05:03.770> lot<00:05:04.070> of<00:05:04.190> times

magnetize everything's in the kit and
now<00:05:09.919> when<00:05:10.190> we<00:05:10.340> say<00:05:10.610> I'll<00:05:10.910> magnetize<00:05:11.630> all

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:11.900 
now when we say I'll magnetize all

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:13.960 
now when we say I'll magnetize all
options<00:05:12.470> that's<00:05:12.680> that's<00:05:13.220> usually<00:05:13.669> just

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:13.970 
options that's that's usually just

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:16.450

everything that's in the kit because all

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:22.330 
everything that's in the kit because all
options<00:05:19.720> can<00:05:20.720> also<00:05:20.930> mean<00:05:21.320> of<00:05:21.590> course<00:05:21.770> whatever

projects<00:06:47.840> a<00:06:47.960> month<00:06:48.170> that's<00:06:48.440> that's<00:06:48.800> a<00:06:48.920> very

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:49.130 
projects a month that's that's a very

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:51.430 
projects a month that's that's a very
conservative<00:06:49.610> estimate<00:06:50.390> actually<00:06:51.290> and<00:06:51.380> if

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:51.440 
conservative estimate actually and if

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:53.800 
conservative estimate actually and if
you<00:06:51.530> look<00:06:51.710> at<00:06:51.830> that<00:06:51.950> per<00:06:52.190> quarter<00:06:52.670> that<00:06:53.600> might

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:53.810 
you look at that per quarter that might

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:57.540 
you look at that per quarter that might
be<00:06:54.020> something<00:06:54.800> like<00:06:55.340> you<00:06:56.120> know<00:06:56.150> 100<00:06:56.660> to<00:06:56.780> 150

00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:57.550 
be something like you know 100 to 150

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:59.980 
be something like you know 100 to 150
yeah<00:06:58.550> I<00:06:58.580> know<00:06:58.700> the<00:06:58.880> math<00:06:59.060> didn't<00:06:59.420> jive<00:06:59.660> just

00:06:59.980 --> 00:06:59.990 
yeah I know the math didn't jive just

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:02.590 
yeah I know the math didn't jive just
then<00:07:00.140> but<00:07:00.650> you<00:07:00.830> get<00:07:00.950> the<00:07:01.010> idea<00:07:01.130> a<00:07:01.820> hundred<00:07:02.480> to

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:02.600 
then but you get the idea a hundred to

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.630 
then but you get the idea a hundred to
150<00:07:03.320> per<00:07:03.470> quarter<00:07:03.740> sometimes<00:07:04.130> even<00:07:04.370> more<00:07:04.400> than

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:04.640 
150 per quarter sometimes even more than

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:07.030 
150 per quarter sometimes even more than
that<00:07:05.600> so<00:07:05.930> the<00:07:05.960> average<00:07:06.140> could<00:07:06.530> actually<00:07:06.710> be

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:07.040 
that so the average could actually be

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.850 
that so the average could actually be
quite<00:07:07.370> higher<00:07:07.730> and<00:07:08.260> we've<00:07:09.260> got<00:07:09.410> a<00:07:09.440> team<00:07:09.650> of

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:09.860 
quite higher and we've got a team of

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:11.650 
quite higher and we've got a team of
painters<00:07:10.040> and<00:07:10.370> the<00:07:10.430> great<00:07:10.640> thing<00:07:10.670> is<00:07:10.910> that<00:07:11.090> if

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:11.660 
painters and the great thing is that if

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:14.830 
painters and the great thing is that if
if<00:07:12.260> one<00:07:12.530> artist<00:07:12.950> you<00:07:13.790> know<00:07:13.910> has<00:07:14.240> some<00:07:14.540> kind<00:07:14.690> of

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:14.840 
if one artist you know has some kind of

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:18.190 
if one artist you know has some kind of
you<00:07:15.590> know<00:07:15.620> major<00:07:15.950> personal<00:07:16.810> crisis<00:07:17.810> come<00:07:18.050> up

you know major personal crisis come up
that's<00:07:18.350> not<00:07:18.620> the<00:07:18.770> end<00:07:18.920> of<00:07:19.160> things<00:07:19.640> we<00:07:19.970> can<00:07:20.090> we

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:20.420 
that's not the end of things we can we

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:21.820 
that's not the end of things we can we
can<00:07:20.540> just<00:07:20.660> move<00:07:20.870> on<00:07:21.020> to<00:07:21.230> a<00:07:21.260> different<00:07:21.320> track

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:21.830 
can just move on to a different track

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:24.310 
can just move on to a different track
and<00:07:22.130> we<00:07:22.820> have<00:07:23.000> a<00:07:23.030> lot<00:07:23.330> of<00:07:23.360> flexibility<00:07:24.110> and<00:07:24.230> a

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:28.130 
I'd say that's generally true of almost

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:32.230 
I'd say that's generally true of almost
any<00:07:28.460> endeavor<00:07:29.300> in<00:07:29.630> a<00:07:29.750> in<00:07:30.050> a<00:07:30.260> society<00:07:30.620> is<00:07:31.550> that
