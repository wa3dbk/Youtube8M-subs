00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 So we 're going to split up 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.930
 heart 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:10.349
 the pasha one more way the thighs is the part 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.969
 lower here in the division here from the south 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.790
 the smallest part we observed that 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.870
 goes your right side and this bigger side 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:26.390
 left 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:26.390
 we have left heart right 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:40.530
 and great vessels because you are leaving the 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:01:00.530
 base will say everything basic comes out of 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:01:00.530
 heart and will mean for the 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:17.220
 vein as in which I gave and my house 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:21.750
 here in this play we do not observe 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:23.430
 law review has just disappointed 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.729
 and we also have the agricultural 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:31.710
 right and left auricchio is a 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:38.240
 way to see what data you have 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:38.240
 will be right and left side 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:46.520
 the inner part of the heart it divides the 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:02:11.690
 screen divided into two parts ventricle 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:02:16.220
 and the triple and the left is to observe the side 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:18.430
 because the person responsible for the whole 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.430
 body 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:38.380
 we are doing the cavities of the 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:38.380
 heart 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:45.680
 we have two other musicians who will 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.630
 overcoming cavities by coating 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:56.620
 we'll call the ventricle music 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:03:00.680
 investing way 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:02.989
 We have two musicians who cover the 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:13.910
 muscle cavity that will be 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:17.799
 investing in a vehicle of friction between 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.799
 we will have a set of valves 

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:33.410
 in the left ventricle of the 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:36.410
 left or left or mitral then 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:43.840
 in the right ventricle of the athlete with 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:43.840
 right to right or tricuspid 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:55.840
 already go there she does not have the table here 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:59.080
 through the marginal tax that will be 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:02.140
 crossing the ventricle here 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:08.520
 days has to be on 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:08.520
 valves and each is each 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:21.180
 Calm ended up leaving the wall that 

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:23.910
 will be between the ventricles to call 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:28.440
 secular internet wall and wall 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:30.000
 between the interatrial septum atria and 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.430
 people have two more sets of 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.480
 valves that will be starting from the 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.340
 wallets 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:37.590
 so here on the side or we'll have 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:43.350
 the aortic valve is a semi- valve 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:47.390
 lunar and here in the earth mona grandfather as in 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:47.390
 art is also a trial without a moon
