00:00:05.499 --> 00:00:05.509 
hello and welcome to a video on finding

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:08.660 
hello and welcome to a video on finding
writing<00:00:06.509> numbers<00:00:06.899> as<00:00:07.560> a<00:00:07.620> product<00:00:08.069> of<00:00:08.400> prime

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
writing numbers as a product of prime

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.910 
writing numbers as a product of prime
factors<00:00:08.970> now<00:00:09.960> all<00:00:10.139> at<00:00:10.290> this<00:00:10.410> phrase<00:00:10.620> here

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
factors now all at this phrase here

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.089 
factors now all at this phrase here
means<00:00:11.190> it<00:00:11.340> just<00:00:11.370> means<00:00:11.700> finding<00:00:12.690> the

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:13.099 
means it just means finding the

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:16.070 
means it just means finding the
combination<00:00:14.099> of<00:00:14.299> prime<00:00:15.299> numbers<00:00:15.780> that<00:00:15.929> will

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
combination of prime numbers that will

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.890 
combination of prime numbers that will
multiply<00:00:16.289> together<00:00:16.920> to<00:00:17.850> make<00:00:18.060> the<00:00:18.690> number

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
multiply together to make the number

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.240 
multiply together to make the number
that<00:00:18.990> I<00:00:19.020> began<00:00:19.350> with<00:00:20.240> now<00:00:21.769> the<00:00:22.769> place<00:00:23.070> to<00:00:23.189> start

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
that I began with now the place to start

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.599 
that I began with now the place to start
here<00:00:23.490> is<00:00:23.820> by<00:00:24.240> drawing<00:00:24.600> what<00:00:24.960> we<00:00:25.800> call<00:00:25.949> a<00:00:26.039> factor

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
here is by drawing what we call a factor

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.970 
here is by drawing what we call a factor
tree<00:00:26.849> so<00:00:27.510> we<00:00:27.630> write<00:00:27.900> out<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.109> number<00:00:28.500> 30<00:00:28.740> to

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
tree so we write out the number 30 to

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.700 
tree so we write out the number 30 to
begin<00:00:29.250> with<00:00:29.429> and<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.570> first<00:00:30.900> question<00:00:31.410> I<00:00:31.500> want

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
begin with and the first question I want

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.920 
begin with and the first question I want
to<00:00:31.740> ask<00:00:31.949> of<00:00:32.250> myself<00:00:32.460> is<00:00:32.910> what<00:00:33.540> two<00:00:33.899> numbers

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
to ask of myself is what two numbers

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.490 
to ask of myself is what two numbers
could<00:00:34.800> I<00:00:34.890> multiply<00:00:35.640> together<00:00:35.880> to<00:00:36.809> give<00:00:37.050> me<00:00:37.290> an

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
could I multiply together to give me an

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.950 
could I multiply together to give me an
answer<00:00:37.800> of<00:00:38.070> 30<00:00:38.399> so<00:00:39.239> lots<00:00:39.480> of<00:00:39.600> ways<00:00:39.780> that<00:00:39.899> I

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
answer of 30 so lots of ways that I

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.930 
answer of 30 so lots of ways that I
could<00:00:40.140> do<00:00:40.230> this<00:00:40.379> I<00:00:40.590> could<00:00:40.649> do<00:00:40.860> so<00:00:41.070> 3<00:00:41.340> times<00:00:41.550> 10

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
could do this I could do so 3 times 10

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.660 
could do this I could do so 3 times 10
or<00:00:42.210> 5<00:00:42.510> times<00:00:42.840> 6<00:00:43.140> and<00:00:43.350> it<00:00:44.250> doesn't<00:00:44.579> really

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
or 5 times 6 and it doesn't really

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.729 
or 5 times 6 and it doesn't really
matter<00:00:44.910> which<00:00:45.239> way<00:00:45.450> you<00:00:46.050> go<00:00:46.079> about<00:00:46.200> doing<00:00:46.649> it

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
matter which way you go about doing it

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.590 
matter which way you go about doing it
because<00:00:47.010> you're<00:00:47.250> your<00:00:47.789> final<00:00:48.210> wants<00:00:48.450> will

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
because you're your final wants will

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.700 
because you're your final wants will
still<00:00:48.870> be<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.140> same<00:00:49.289> thing

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
still be the same thing

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.090 
still be the same thing
we'll<00:00:50.579> say<00:00:50.789> 30<00:00:51.480> will<00:00:51.809> say<00:00:51.989> that's<00:00:52.140> 3<00:00:52.500> times<00:00:52.770> 10

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
we'll say 30 will say that's 3 times 10

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.310 
we'll say 30 will say that's 3 times 10
so<00:00:54.059> 3<00:00:54.329> times<00:00:54.570> 10<00:00:54.840> gives<00:00:55.079> me<00:00:55.500> 30<00:00:56.270> now<00:00:57.270> if<00:00:57.570> I<00:00:57.930> get<00:00:58.020> a

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
so 3 times 10 gives me 30 now if I get a

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.319 
so 3 times 10 gives me 30 now if I get a
prime<00:00:58.710> number<00:00:58.739> what<00:00:59.520> I'm<00:00:59.699> going<00:00:59.850> to<00:00:59.879> do<00:01:00.030> is<00:01:00.210> I'm

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
prime number what I'm going to do is I'm

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.630 
prime number what I'm going to do is I'm
just<00:01:00.359> going<00:01:00.570> to<00:01:00.629> circle<00:01:00.870> it<00:01:01.140> so<00:01:01.829> there<00:01:02.070> 3<00:01:02.609> times

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
just going to circle it so there 3 times

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.939 
just going to circle it so there 3 times
10<00:01:03.090> 3<00:01:03.510> is<00:01:03.600> a<00:01:03.629> prime<00:01:03.899> number<00:01:03.930> so<00:01:04.260> I<00:01:04.409> circled<00:01:04.890> it

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
10 3 is a prime number so I circled it

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.830 
10 3 is a prime number so I circled it
now<00:01:05.790> how<00:01:06.000> can<00:01:06.240> I<00:01:06.360> make<00:01:07.020> 10<00:01:08.210> how<00:01:09.210> can<00:01:09.390> I<00:01:09.450> make<00:01:09.570> 10

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
now how can I make 10 how can I make 10

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.450 
now how can I make 10 how can I make 10
where<00:01:10.229> I<00:01:10.260> can<00:01:10.439> make<00:01:10.590> 10<00:01:10.799> by<00:01:10.979> doing<00:01:11.189> 2

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
where I can make 10 by doing 2

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.039 
where I can make 10 by doing 2
multiplied<00:01:12.450> by<00:01:12.479> 5<00:01:13.430> again<00:01:14.430> I've<00:01:14.670> reached<00:01:15.090> two

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
multiplied by 5 again I've reached two

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.859 
multiplied by 5 again I've reached two
prime<00:01:16.290> numbers<00:01:16.590> here<00:01:17.090> 2<00:01:18.090> is<00:01:18.119> prime<00:01:18.390> number<00:01:18.659> 5

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
prime numbers here 2 is prime number 5

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.109 
prime numbers here 2 is prime number 5
is<00:01:19.020> prime<00:01:19.170> number<00:01:19.560> so<00:01:20.750> what<00:01:21.750> I'm<00:01:21.869> left<00:01:22.049> with<00:01:22.200> is

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 
is prime number so what I'm left with is

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:29.990 
is prime number so what I'm left with is
2<00:01:24.119> x<00:01:25.049> 3<00:01:26.000> x<00:01:27.000> 5<00:01:27.479> and<00:01:28.100> as<00:01:29.100> soon<00:01:29.460> as<00:01:29.579> you<00:01:29.670> get<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:29.880> a

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
2 x 3 x 5 and as soon as you get to a

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.539 
2 x 3 x 5 and as soon as you get to a
prime<00:01:30.240> number<00:01:30.270> Circle<00:01:30.900> it<00:01:30.990> then<00:01:31.490> close<00:01:32.490> that

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
prime number Circle it then close that

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.330 
prime number Circle it then close that
Avenue<00:01:33.479> off<00:01:33.630> you<00:01:34.049> can't<00:01:34.320> carry<00:01:34.770> on<00:01:34.950> doing<00:01:35.220> it

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
Avenue off you can't carry on doing it

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.710 
Avenue off you can't carry on doing it
because<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.640> only<00:01:35.729> way<00:01:35.909> that<00:01:35.939> you<00:01:36.150> can<00:01:36.299> make<00:01:36.390> 3

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
because the only way that you can make 3

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.660 
because the only way that you can make 3
is<00:01:36.840> by<00:01:36.990> making<00:01:37.320> it<00:01:37.380> is<00:01:37.530> by<00:01:37.710> doing<00:01:37.770> 3<00:01:38.220> times<00:01:38.490> by

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
is by making it is by doing 3 times by

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.109 
is by making it is by doing 3 times by
one

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.119 
one

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:43.289 
one
so<00:01:40.659> what<00:01:40.840> I<00:01:40.869> could<00:01:41.079> say<00:01:41.320> is<00:01:41.350> that<00:01:41.590> xxx<00:01:42.490> written

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:43.299 
so what I could say is that xxx written

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:47.190 
so what I could say is that xxx written
as<00:01:43.450> a<00:01:43.509> product<00:01:44.020> of<00:01:44.350> prime<00:01:45.240> factors<00:01:46.240> is<00:01:46.450> 2<00:01:46.810> times

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
as a product of prime factors is 2 times

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.420 
as a product of prime factors is 2 times
3<00:01:47.530> times<00:01:47.560> 5

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
3 times 5

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.429 
3 times 5
so<00:01:48.970> what<00:01:49.240> prime<00:01:49.600> numbers<00:01:49.990> can<00:01:50.170> I<00:01:50.259> multiply

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:50.439 
so what prime numbers can I multiply

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:53.969 
so what prime numbers can I multiply
together<00:01:50.890> to<00:01:51.250> make<00:01:51.460> 30<00:01:51.759> I<00:01:52.210> can<00:01:52.990> multiply<00:01:53.229> 2<00:01:53.409> 3<00:01:53.860> &amp;

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
together to make 30 I can multiply 2 3 &amp;

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:56.370 
together to make 30 I can multiply 2 3 &amp;
5<00:01:54.130> together<00:01:54.369> I<00:01:54.759> can<00:01:55.270> check<00:01:55.570> that<00:01:55.600> my<00:01:56.049> answer<00:01:56.350> is

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
5 together I can check that my answer is

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.669 
5 together I can check that my answer is
correct<00:01:56.670> by<00:01:57.670> actually<00:01:58.569> doing<00:01:58.600> this<00:01:58.990> sum<00:01:59.259> if<00:01:59.470> I

00:01:59.669 --> 00:01:59.679 
correct by actually doing this sum if I

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:01.559 
correct by actually doing this sum if I
just<00:01:59.860> do<00:02:00.039> this<00:02:00.069> very<00:02:00.369> quickly<00:02:00.670> it<00:02:01.060> should<00:02:01.329> give

00:02:01.559 --> 00:02:01.569 
just do this very quickly it should give

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:04.169 
just do this very quickly it should give
me<00:02:01.600> an<00:02:01.780> answer<00:02:01.929> of<00:02:02.110> 30<00:02:02.380> so<00:02:03.130> two<00:02:03.250> times<00:02:03.700> by<00:02:03.880> 3

00:02:04.169 --> 00:02:04.179 
me an answer of 30 so two times by 3

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:09.109 
me an answer of 30 so two times by 3
gives<00:02:04.450> me<00:02:04.509> 6<00:02:05.399> multiplied<00:02:06.399> by<00:02:06.549> 5<00:02:06.850> gives<00:02:07.360> me<00:02:07.569> 30

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
gives me 6 multiplied by 5 gives me 30

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.089 
gives me 6 multiplied by 5 gives me 30
next<00:02:10.119> one<00:02:10.300> right<00:02:10.780> 84<00:02:11.260> is<00:02:11.380> a<00:02:11.410> product<00:02:11.769> of<00:02:11.860> prime

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:12.099 
next one right 84 is a product of prime

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:15.860 
next one right 84 is a product of prime
factors<00:02:12.510> so<00:02:13.510> if<00:02:13.810> I<00:02:13.900> write<00:02:14.140> out<00:02:14.170> the<00:02:14.380> number<00:02:14.620> 84

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
factors so if I write out the number 84

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.930 
factors so if I write out the number 84
then<00:02:16.870> what<00:02:17.530> two<00:02:17.709> numbers<00:02:18.130> can<00:02:18.160> multiply

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
then what two numbers can multiply

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.350 
then what two numbers can multiply
together<00:02:19.330> to<00:02:19.690> make<00:02:19.870> 84<00:02:20.610> so<00:02:21.610> I<00:02:21.670> could<00:02:21.849> start<00:02:22.209> off

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
together to make 84 so I could start off

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:29.120 
together to make 84 so I could start off
by<00:02:22.510> saying<00:02:22.720> that<00:02:23.370> 42<00:02:24.450> times<00:02:25.450> 2<00:02:25.870> gives<00:02:26.459> me<00:02:27.660> 84

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
by saying that 42 times 2 gives me 84

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:35.940 
by saying that 42 times 2 gives me 84
then<00:02:30.720> so<00:02:31.720> 2<00:02:31.870> is<00:02:32.349> a<00:02:32.799> prime<00:02:32.920> number<00:02:33.280> then<00:02:34.890> how<00:02:35.890> can

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
then so 2 is a prime number then how can

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.400 
then so 2 is a prime number then how can
I<00:02:36.250> make<00:02:36.430> 42<00:02:37.239> by<00:02:37.540> multiplying<00:02:38.019> two<00:02:38.230> numbers

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
I make 42 by multiplying two numbers

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.809 
I make 42 by multiplying two numbers
together<00:02:38.680> again<00:02:39.640> I<00:02:39.670> could<00:02:39.970> just<00:02:40.000> say<00:02:40.360> it's<00:02:40.590> 21

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
together again I could just say it's 21

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:46.440 
together again I could just say it's 21
times<00:02:42.819> by<00:02:43.209> 2<00:02:44.079> I<00:02:44.290> could<00:02:45.190> also<00:02:45.400> said<00:02:45.760> it<00:02:45.850> was<00:02:45.970> 6

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
times by 2 I could also said it was 6

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.210 
times by 2 I could also said it was 6
times<00:02:46.720> 7<00:02:46.959> again<00:02:47.319> it<00:02:47.470> doesn't<00:02:47.709> matter<00:02:47.859> what<00:02:48.069> way

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
times 7 again it doesn't matter what way

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.440 
times 7 again it doesn't matter what way
round<00:02:48.430> you<00:02:48.609> go<00:02:48.730> about<00:02:48.880> doing<00:02:49.060> this

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
round you go about doing this

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.509 
round you go about doing this
your<00:02:50.140> final<00:02:50.319> answer<00:02:50.500> will<00:02:51.040> be<00:02:51.069> the<00:02:51.310> same

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519 
your final answer will be the same

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:53.910 
your final answer will be the same
whichever<00:02:51.819> route<00:02:52.209> you<00:02:52.420> choose<00:02:52.450> to<00:02:52.810> take<00:02:52.989> then

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
whichever route you choose to take then

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.729 
whichever route you choose to take then
lastly<00:02:54.250> how<00:02:54.549> can<00:02:54.760> I<00:02:54.819> multiply<00:02:55.470> 21<00:02:56.470> by

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
lastly how can I multiply 21 by

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:59.400 
lastly how can I multiply 21 by
multiplying<00:02:57.280> two<00:02:57.430> numbers<00:02:57.579> together<00:02:58.109> and<00:02:59.109> I

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
multiplying two numbers together and I

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.500 
multiplying two numbers together and I
could<00:02:59.590> say<00:02:59.680> that's<00:02:59.889> three<00:03:00.299> multiplied<00:03:01.299> by

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
could say that's three multiplied by

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.809 
could say that's three multiplied by
seven<00:03:01.950> going<00:03:02.950> both<00:03:03.160> of<00:03:03.370> these<00:03:03.459> are<00:03:03.639> prime

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:03.819 
seven going both of these are prime

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:06.920 
seven going both of these are prime
numbers<00:03:03.850> so<00:03:04.660> I'm<00:03:04.750> going<00:03:04.930> to<00:03:04.989> circle

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
numbers so I'm going to circle

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.740 
numbers so I'm going to circle
now<00:03:07.579> what<00:03:08.579> I<00:03:08.610> could<00:03:08.790> say<00:03:08.939> here<00:03:09.180> then<00:03:09.360> is<00:03:09.569> my

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
now what I could say here then is my

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:17.170 
now what I could say here then is my
answer<00:03:10.140> is<00:03:10.590> 2<00:03:11.360> times<00:03:12.360> 2<00:03:12.959> times<00:03:13.310> 3<00:03:14.310> times<00:03:15.140> 7

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
answer is 2 times 2 times 3 times 7

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.339 
answer is 2 times 2 times 3 times 7
quick<00:03:18.180> check<00:03:18.450> to<00:03:18.480> see<00:03:18.780> if<00:03:18.870> that<00:03:19.019> is<00:03:19.140> actually

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:19.349 
quick check to see if that is actually

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:21.429 
quick check to see if that is actually
correct<00:03:19.890> and<00:03:20.159> that<00:03:20.250> is<00:03:20.370> the<00:03:20.519> correct<00:03:20.760> answer<00:03:20.970> I

00:03:21.429 --> 00:03:21.439 
correct and that is the correct answer I

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:24.920 
correct and that is the correct answer I
can<00:03:22.439> just<00:03:22.590> again<00:03:23.040> do<00:03:23.489> I<00:03:23.519> did<00:03:23.790> last<00:03:24.000> time<00:03:24.120> and<00:03:24.269> do

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
can just again do I did last time and do

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.380 
can just again do I did last time and do
this<00:03:25.079> calculation<00:03:25.340> now<00:03:26.340> if<00:03:26.489> you<00:03:26.640> have<00:03:27.359> got

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
this calculation now if you have got

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.789 
this calculation now if you have got
quite<00:03:27.870> a<00:03:27.900> long<00:03:29.480> version<00:03:30.480> of<00:03:30.599> this<00:03:30.750> it's<00:03:31.319> easier

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
quite a long version of this it's easier

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:33.319 
quite a long version of this it's easier
to<00:03:31.950> start<00:03:32.220> with<00:03:32.310> the<00:03:32.519> bigger<00:03:32.700> numbers<00:03:33.060> first

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329 
to start with the bigger numbers first

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:37.069 
to start with the bigger numbers first
so<00:03:34.079> if<00:03:34.200> I<00:03:34.319> start<00:03:34.650> by<00:03:34.859> doing<00:03:35.010> 7<00:03:35.519> times<00:03:35.819> by<00:03:36.120> 3<00:03:36.480> that

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:37.079 
so if I start by doing 7 times by 3 that

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:40.640 
so if I start by doing 7 times by 3 that
gives<00:03:37.290> me<00:03:37.379> 21<00:03:37.980> times<00:03:38.670> by<00:03:38.879> 2<00:03:38.940> gives<00:03:39.389> me<00:03:39.420> 42<00:03:39.989> times

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
gives me 21 times by 2 gives me 42 times

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.190 
gives me 21 times by 2 gives me 42 times
by<00:03:40.889> 2<00:03:40.950> gives<00:03:41.370> me<00:03:41.430> 84<00:03:42.030> you<00:03:42.540> can<00:03:42.690> see<00:03:42.870> here<00:03:43.079> that's

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
by 2 gives me 84 you can see here that's

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.080 
by 2 gives me 84 you can see here that's
essentially<00:03:43.950> the<00:03:44.159> same<00:03:44.340> route<00:03:44.639> as<00:03:44.760> we<00:03:44.909> took

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
essentially the same route as we took

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.240 
essentially the same route as we took
there<00:03:45.440> there<00:03:46.440> is<00:03:46.530> another<00:03:46.709> way<00:03:46.859> that<00:03:46.889> we<00:03:47.069> could

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
there there is another way that we could

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.629 
there there is another way that we could
write<00:03:47.400> this<00:03:47.579> we<00:03:47.730> could<00:03:47.849> also<00:03:49.129> kind<00:03:50.129> of<00:03:50.220> tidy

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:50.639 
write this we could also kind of tidy

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:52.190 
write this we could also kind of tidy
this<00:03:50.760> up<00:03:50.879> a<00:03:51.000> little<00:03:51.120> bit<00:03:51.329> by<00:03:51.450> saying<00:03:51.659> that<00:03:51.900> ok

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
this up a little bit by saying that ok

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.830 
this up a little bit by saying that ok
or<00:03:52.620> 2<00:03:52.859> times<00:03:53.159> 2<00:03:53.430> that's<00:03:53.609> the<00:03:53.790> same<00:03:53.819> as<00:03:54.180> 2

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
or 2 times 2 that's the same as 2

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:01.420 
or 2 times 2 that's the same as 2
squared<00:03:55.379> times<00:03:56.310> by<00:03:56.609> 3<00:03:56.970> and<00:03:57.209> times<00:03:58.049> by<00:03:58.349> 7

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.330 

and<00:04:01.849> that's<00:04:02.120> about<00:04:02.209> it
