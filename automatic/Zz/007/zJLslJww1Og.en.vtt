kind of terminates right here at the
cheek<00:01:24.050> so<00:01:24.320> when<00:01:24.770> you're<00:01:24.890> looking<00:01:25.040> at<00:01:25.340> your

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:25.370 
cheek so when you're looking at your

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:27.760 
cheek so when you're looking at your
Anatomy<00:01:25.940> reference<00:01:26.390> that's<00:01:26.720> a<00:01:26.870> major<00:01:27.080> one<00:01:27.410> to

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
Anatomy reference that's a major one to

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.980 
Anatomy reference that's a major one to
think<00:01:28.100> about<00:01:28.370> also<00:01:28.910> when<00:01:29.450> you're<00:01:29.570> looking<00:01:29.810> at

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
think about also when you're looking at

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.320 
think about also when you're looking at
the<00:01:30.140> bottom<00:01:30.560> of<00:01:30.860> the<00:01:31.010> chin<00:01:31.280> here<00:01:31.700> all<00:01:32.120> these

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
the bottom of the chin here all these

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.420 
the bottom of the chin here all these
forms<00:01:32.870> remember<00:01:33.590> how<00:01:33.710> I<00:01:33.740> was<00:01:33.890> saying<00:01:34.160> like

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
forms remember how I was saying like

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.180 
forms remember how I was saying like
this<00:01:34.670> fades<00:01:35.090> out<00:01:35.450> that's<00:01:35.870> this<00:01:36.190> depressor

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:37.190 
this fades out that's this depressor

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.580 
this fades out that's this depressor
anguli<00:01:37.490> some<00:01:38.420> muscle<00:01:38.780> here<00:01:39.170> and<00:01:39.410> there's

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
anguli some muscle here and there's

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.740 
anguli some muscle here and there's
another<00:01:39.650> muscle<00:01:40.190> right<00:01:40.490> here<00:01:40.550> that<00:01:41.330> come<00:01:41.570> out

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
another muscle right here that come out

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.540 
another muscle right here that come out
and<00:01:42.050> then<00:01:42.200> you<00:01:42.230> have<00:01:42.350> this<00:01:42.740> muscle<00:01:43.340> right<00:01:43.490> here

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:43.550 
and then you have this muscle right here

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.910 
and then you have this muscle right here
called<00:01:43.940> the<00:01:44.120> mentalis<00:01:44.780> that<00:01:45.200> so<00:01:45.500> it<00:01:45.590> gives<00:01:45.620> you

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
called the mentalis that so it gives you

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.310 
called the mentalis that so it gives you
this<00:01:46.130> shape<00:01:46.460> so<00:01:46.490> these<00:01:47.000> three<00:01:47.870> right<00:01:48.140> here

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
this shape so these three right here

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.290 
this shape so these three right here
that<00:01:48.530> are<00:01:48.650> major<00:01:48.860> and<00:01:49.550> then<00:01:49.820> you<00:01:49.970> have<00:01:50.120> your

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:50.300 
that are major and then you have your

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.170 
that are major and then you have your
orbicularis<00:01:51.050> that<00:01:51.680> wraps<00:01:52.010> around<00:01:52.250> and<00:01:52.940> then

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 
orbicularis that wraps around and then

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.450 
orbicularis that wraps around and then
you<00:01:53.390> have<00:01:53.570> your<00:01:53.870> Rose<00:01:54.110> arias<00:01:54.650> that's<00:01:55.220> what

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
you have your Rose arias that's what

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.580 
you have your Rose arias that's what
pulls<00:01:55.760> out<00:01:56.090> here<00:01:56.600> and<00:01:56.840> there's<00:01:57.050> your<00:01:57.260> Luke

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
pulls out here and there's your Luke

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.220 
pulls out here and there's your Luke
inator<00:01:57.980> underneath<00:01:58.730> it<00:01:58.970> and<00:01:59.180> those<00:01:59.450> give<00:01:59.900> this

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:00.230 
inator underneath it and those give this

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:03.490 
inator underneath it and those give this
shape<00:02:00.590> behind<00:02:01.190> the<00:02:01.670> node<00:02:02.030> right<00:02:02.360> here<00:02:02.420> so<00:02:03.050> when

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
shape behind the node right here so when

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.650 
shape behind the node right here so when
you<00:02:03.620> look<00:02:03.830> at<00:02:04.040> a<00:02:04.070> faces<00:02:04.910> you'll<00:02:05.150> you'll<00:02:05.510> be

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:05.660 
you look at a faces you'll you'll be

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.290 
you look at a faces you'll you'll be
able<00:02:05.720> to<00:02:05.930> see<00:02:06.620> these<00:02:06.920> shapes<00:02:07.400> and<00:02:07.790> why<00:02:08.060> these

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
able to see these shapes and why these

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.699 
able to see these shapes and why these
shapes<00:02:08.780> are<00:02:08.959> doing<00:02:09.110> what<00:02:09.200> they're<00:02:09.349> doing<00:02:09.590> with

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
shapes are doing what they're doing with

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:11.259 
shapes are doing what they're doing with
these<00:02:09.860> muscle<00:02:10.340> groups<00:02:10.580> that<00:02:10.789> are<00:02:11.060> right<00:02:11.239> here

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:11.269 
these muscle groups that are right here

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:14.410 
these muscle groups that are right here
so<00:02:12.019> let's<00:02:12.260> say<00:02:12.590> these<00:02:13.040> muscles<00:02:13.609> right<00:02:13.670> in<00:02:13.999> here

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
so let's say these muscles right in here

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.599 
so let's say these muscles right in here
they're<00:02:14.689> going<00:02:14.840> to<00:02:14.900> create<00:02:15.260> this<00:02:15.650> mass<00:02:16.069> here

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:16.609 
they're going to create this mass here

00:02:16.609 --> 00:02:18.240 
they're going to create this mass here
so<00:02:16.969> depending<00:02:17.540> on<00:02:17.689> you<00:02:17.900> know<00:02:17.930> how

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
so depending on you know how

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.700 
so depending on you know how
much<00:02:18.370> fat<00:02:18.730> is<00:02:18.940> in<00:02:18.970> the<00:02:19.210> face<00:02:19.450> this<00:02:20.110> shape<00:02:20.440> will

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:20.710 
much fat is in the face this shape will

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:22.920 
much fat is in the face this shape will
merge<00:02:20.950> with<00:02:20.980> these<00:02:21.550> sometimes<00:02:21.970> in<00:02:22.690> the<00:02:22.780> one

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
merge with these sometimes in the one

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.170 
merge with these sometimes in the one
massive<00:02:23.290> shape<00:02:23.770> kind<00:02:24.070> of<00:02:24.160> blend<00:02:24.460> kind<00:02:25.000> of<00:02:25.060> give

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
massive shape kind of blend kind of give

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.150 
massive shape kind of blend kind of give
it<00:02:25.210> a<00:02:25.360> more<00:02:25.510> full<00:02:25.840> face<00:02:26.200> and<00:02:26.530> if<00:02:26.830> you<00:02:26.950> want<00:02:27.100> to

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
it a more full face and if you want to

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.040 
it a more full face and if you want to
take<00:02:27.280> it<00:02:27.430> a<00:02:27.490> step<00:02:27.700> further<00:02:27.970> really<00:02:28.690> bring<00:02:28.930> it

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
take it a step further really bring it

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:30.720 
take it a step further really bring it
out<00:02:29.230> through<00:02:29.590> the<00:02:29.680> cheeks<00:02:29.950> are<00:02:30.160> really<00:02:30.430> full

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
out through the cheeks are really full

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:36.580 
out through the cheeks are really full
here

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.650
