00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
going to share my thoughts on how I

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.640 
going to share my thoughts on how I
think<00:00:29.130> they<00:00:29.429> put<00:00:29.730> her<00:00:29.789> into<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.090> game<00:00:30.300> and

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:30.650 
think they put her into the game and

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.959 
think they put her into the game and
exactly<00:00:31.650> you<00:00:31.890> know<00:00:31.980> how<00:00:32.009> she<00:00:32.219> would<00:00:32.579> fit<00:00:32.820> into

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
exactly you know how she would fit into

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.569 
exactly you know how she would fit into
the<00:00:33.149> game<00:00:33.360> so<00:00:33.680> poison<00:00:34.680> his<00:00:34.920> real<00:00:35.100> name<00:00:35.340> is

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
the game so poison his real name is

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.869 
the game so poison his real name is
Pamela<00:00:36.180> Isley<00:00:36.469> so<00:00:37.469> they<00:00:38.010> could<00:00:38.219> go<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.640> first

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
Pamela Isley so they could go the first

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.690 
Pamela Isley so they could go the first
route<00:00:39.239> is<00:00:39.540> just<00:00:40.079> giving<00:00:40.379> her<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.860> Easter<00:00:41.579> Egg

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
route is just giving her a Easter Egg

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.150 
route is just giving her a Easter Egg
they<00:00:42.270> could<00:00:42.570> and<00:00:42.960> I<00:00:43.110> was<00:00:43.260> thinking<00:00:43.590> of<00:00:43.710> a<00:00:43.829> G

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
they could and I was thinking of a G

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.950 
they could and I was thinking of a G
speed<00:00:44.430> DC<00:00:45.059> PD<00:00:45.329> like<00:00:45.719> when<00:00:45.870> you're

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
speed DC PD like when you're

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.740 
speed DC PD like when you're
infiltrating<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.620> GCPD<00:00:47.550> maybe<00:00:48.239> you<00:00:48.420> can<00:00:48.570> see

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
infiltrating the GCPD maybe you can see

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.880 
infiltrating the GCPD maybe you can see
like<00:00:48.930> I<00:00:49.500> guess<00:00:50.399> a<00:00:50.430> bulletin<00:00:50.940> board<00:00:50.969> or<00:00:51.570> a<00:00:51.649> TV<00:00:52.649> or

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
like I guess a bulletin board or a TV or

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.260 
like I guess a bulletin board or a TV or
a<00:00:52.920> newspaper<00:00:53.550> where<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.239> GCPD<00:00:54.809> is<00:00:54.930> saying

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:56.270 
a newspaper where the GCPD is saying

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.510 
a newspaper where the GCPD is saying
explosion<00:00:57.270> happened<00:00:57.719> in<00:00:58.100> greenhouse<00:00:59.100> where

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
explosion happened in greenhouse where

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.520 
explosion happened in greenhouse where
Pamela<00:01:00.000> Isley<00:01:00.180> was<00:01:00.600> in<00:01:00.780> because<00:01:01.140> if<00:01:01.440> you

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
Pamela Isley was in because if you

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.149 
Pamela Isley was in because if you
didn't<00:01:01.770> know<00:01:01.829> pema<00:01:02.160> Isley<00:01:02.760> got<00:01:03.750> her<00:01:04.229> playing

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
didn't know pema Isley got her playing

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.149 
didn't know pema Isley got her playing
controlling<00:01:05.670> powers<00:01:06.290> from<00:01:07.290> I<00:01:07.619> guess<00:01:07.830> I<00:01:08.010> think

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
controlling powers from I guess I think

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.649 
controlling powers from I guess I think
it<00:01:08.220> was<00:01:08.310> a<00:01:08.340> little<00:01:08.520> accident<00:01:09.000> that<00:01:09.210> happened

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
it was a little accident that happened

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.280 
it was a little accident that happened
when<00:01:09.840> she<00:01:09.869> was<00:01:10.110> in<00:01:10.260> a<00:01:10.350> lab<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:11.070> she<00:01:11.790> was<00:01:12.000> a

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
when she was in a lab and she was a

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.359 
when she was in a lab and she was a
eco-terrorist<00:01:13.290> she<00:01:13.500> would<00:01:13.650> enjoyed<00:01:14.040> like

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
eco-terrorist she would enjoyed like

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.399 
eco-terrorist she would enjoyed like
taking<00:01:14.939> care<00:01:15.119> of<00:01:15.180> plants<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:15.750> everything<00:01:15.810> so

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
taking care of plants and everything so

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.560 
taking care of plants and everything so
that's<00:01:16.500> why<00:01:16.680> she<00:01:16.890> has<00:01:17.009> that<00:01:17.250> obsession<00:01:18.180> with

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
that's why she has that obsession with

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.899 
that's why she has that obsession with
like<00:01:18.840> controlling<00:01:19.740> plants<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.430> keeping<00:01:20.759> her

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
like controlling plants and keeping her

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.539 
like controlling plants and keeping her
safe<00:01:21.299> so<00:01:22.170> I<00:01:22.200> obviously<00:01:22.830> they<00:01:23.310> could<00:01:23.460> do<00:01:23.520> a

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
safe so I obviously they could do a

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.550 
safe so I obviously they could do a
really<00:01:24.090> quick<00:01:24.360> Easter<00:01:24.900> Egg<00:01:25.020> where<00:01:25.259> it's<00:01:25.380> just

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
really quick Easter Egg where it's just

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.740 
really quick Easter Egg where it's just
like<00:01:25.740> okay<00:01:26.159> this<00:01:26.189> explosion<00:01:27.030> happened<00:01:27.479> and

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
like okay this explosion happened and

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.560 
like okay this explosion happened and
they<00:01:28.229> can<00:01:28.380> put<00:01:28.560> Pamela<00:01:29.040> Isley<00:01:29.570> supposedly

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
they can put Pamela Isley supposedly

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.410 
they can put Pamela Isley supposedly
dead<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:31.079> that<00:01:31.619> would<00:01:31.799> obviously<00:01:32.119> refer<00:01:33.119> to

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
dead and that would obviously refer to

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.690 
dead and that would obviously refer to
poison<00:01:33.780> ivy<00:01:33.930> or<00:01:34.619> they<00:01:34.920> could<00:01:35.100> go<00:01:35.130> with<00:01:35.280> an

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
poison ivy or they could go with an

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.060 
poison ivy or they could go with an
easter<00:01:36.210> egg<00:01:36.299> or<00:01:36.600> horse<00:01:37.320> art<00:01:37.530> or<00:01:37.740> they<00:01:37.829> could<00:01:37.979> go

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
easter egg or horse art or they could go

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.460 
easter egg or horse art or they could go
through<00:01:38.280> cameo<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:39.150> we<00:01:39.930> could<00:01:40.079> just<00:01:40.229> see

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
through cameo and we could just see

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.130 
through cameo and we could just see
Pamela<00:01:40.770> Isley<00:01:41.070> before<00:01:42.000> she<00:01:42.180> became<00:01:42.479> the

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
Pamela Isley before she became the

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.920 
Pamela Isley before she became the
poison<00:01:43.560> ivy<00:01:43.710> so<00:01:44.610> another<00:01:45.240> idea<00:01:45.509> I<00:01:45.720> thought

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
poison ivy so another idea I thought

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.420 
poison ivy so another idea I thought
they<00:01:46.170> could<00:01:46.320> do<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.439> side<00:01:46.770> mission<00:01:46.950> with<00:01:47.280> her

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
they could do a side mission with her

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.999 
they could do a side mission with her
and<00:01:47.670> if<00:01:48.270> you<00:01:48.360> didn't<00:01:48.600> know<00:01:48.720> her<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:49.619> Harley

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
and if you didn't know her and Harley

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.440 
and if you didn't know her and Harley
Quinn<00:01:50.280> actually<00:01:50.790> had<00:01:50.909> a<00:01:50.939> little<00:01:51.180> thing<00:01:51.420> going

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
Quinn actually had a little thing going

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.480 
Quinn actually had a little thing going
on<00:01:51.750> there<00:01:51.990> I<00:01:52.259> guess<00:01:52.770> you<00:01:52.890> could<00:01:53.070> say<00:01:53.250> they<00:01:53.460> were

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
on there I guess you could say they were

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.359 
on there I guess you could say they were
like<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.119> female<00:01:54.659> Batman<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:55.530> Robin<00:01:55.829> I<00:01:56.040> know

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
like the female Batman and Robin I know

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.670 
like the female Batman and Robin I know
like<00:01:57.000> that<00:01:57.180> they<00:01:57.329> what<00:01:58.079> I'm<00:01:58.170> trying<00:01:58.380> to<00:01:58.439> say<00:01:58.560> is

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
like that they what I'm trying to say is

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.280 
like that they what I'm trying to say is
they<00:01:58.799> usually<00:01:59.009> team<00:01:59.460> up<00:01:59.640> together<00:01:59.820> and<00:02:00.290> I

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
they usually team up together and I

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.510 
they usually team up together and I
thought<00:02:01.469> it'd<00:02:01.590> be<00:02:01.619> kind<00:02:01.920> of<00:02:02.009> interesting<00:02:02.430> to

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
thought it'd be kind of interesting to

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.219 
thought it'd be kind of interesting to
see<00:02:02.549> either<00:02:03.000> two<00:02:03.420> ways<00:02:03.630> they<00:02:03.869> could<00:02:04.020> team<00:02:04.200> up

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
see either two ways they could team up

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.399 
see either two ways they could team up
one<00:02:04.740> is<00:02:05.040> they<00:02:05.670> could<00:02:05.820> go<00:02:06.360> as<00:02:06.540> like<00:02:06.810> Harley

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
one is they could go as like Harley

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.180 
one is they could go as like Harley
Quinzel<00:02:07.920> and<00:02:08.340> Pamela<00:02:09.270> Isley<00:02:09.479> so<00:02:10.440> it<00:02:10.890> could<00:02:11.099> be

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
Quinzel and Pamela Isley so it could be

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.610 
Quinzel and Pamela Isley so it could be
like<00:02:11.370> Pamela<00:02:12.060> Isley

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
like Pamela Isley

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.559 
like Pamela Isley
or<00:02:13.709> the<00:02:13.830> explosion<00:02:14.400> where<00:02:14.640> she<00:02:14.970> was<00:02:15.120> just<00:02:15.390> a

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
or the explosion where she was just a

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.809 
or the explosion where she was just a
normal<00:02:15.900> normal<00:02:16.470> person<00:02:17.099> who<00:02:17.310> was<00:02:17.489> obsessed

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
normal normal person who was obsessed

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:19.550 
normal normal person who was obsessed
with<00:02:17.879> plants<00:02:18.330> and<00:02:18.720> never<00:02:18.930> could<00:02:19.080> see<00:02:19.200> Harley

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
with plants and never could see Harley

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.850 
with plants and never could see Harley
Quinzel<00:02:20.040> before<00:02:20.879> she<00:02:21.030> got<00:02:21.180> you<00:02:21.510> know

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
Quinzel before she got you know

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.140 
Quinzel before she got you know
manipulated<00:02:22.860> by<00:02:22.950> the<00:02:23.010> Joker<00:02:23.310> so<00:02:23.819> some<00:02:24.030> people

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
manipulated by the Joker so some people

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.850 
manipulated by the Joker so some people
might<00:02:24.420> not<00:02:24.480> like<00:02:24.629> that<00:02:24.840> where<00:02:25.319> we<00:02:25.440> could<00:02:25.620> see

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
might not like that where we could see

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.880 
might not like that where we could see
Pamela<00:02:26.400> Isley<00:02:26.580> and<00:02:27.060> Harley<00:02:27.450> Quinzel<00:02:27.890> knowing

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
Pamela Isley and Harley Quinzel knowing

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.250 
Pamela Isley and Harley Quinzel knowing
each<00:02:29.040> other<00:02:29.310> before<00:02:30.120> they<00:02:30.510> became<00:02:30.900> their

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
each other before they became their

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.009 
each other before they became their
villain<00:02:31.950> persona<00:02:32.579> so<00:02:33.360> I<00:02:33.390> guess<00:02:33.690> I<00:02:33.780> want<00:02:33.959> to

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
villain persona so I guess I want to

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:36.680 
villain persona so I guess I want to
really<00:02:34.170> do<00:02:34.680> much<00:02:34.890> you<00:02:34.920> could<00:02:35.510> honestly<00:02:36.510> just

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
really do much you could honestly just

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.089 
really do much you could honestly just
see<00:02:36.750> like<00:02:36.900> an<00:02:36.989> easter<00:02:37.290> egg<00:02:37.319> art<00:02:37.530> cameo<00:02:37.920> with

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
see like an easter egg art cameo with

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:40.430 
see like an easter egg art cameo with
them<00:02:38.310> together<00:02:38.640> but<00:02:39.420> I<00:02:39.599> was<00:02:39.750> thinking<00:02:40.170> a

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
them together but I was thinking a

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.979 
them together but I was thinking a
little<00:02:40.799> more<00:02:40.950> in<00:02:41.250> death<00:02:41.459> would<00:02:41.700> be<00:02:41.849> a<00:02:42.090> side

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
little more in death would be a side

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:46.220 
little more in death would be a side
mission<00:02:43.200> where<00:02:43.890> it's<00:02:44.430> poison<00:02:45.269> ivy<00:02:45.450> and<00:02:45.780> Harley

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
mission where it's poison ivy and Harley

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.589 
mission where it's poison ivy and Harley
Quinn<00:02:46.440> together<00:02:46.769> and<00:02:47.069> I<00:02:47.730> was<00:02:47.910> thinking<00:02:48.060> Batman

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599 
Quinn together and I was thinking Batman

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:52.490 
Quinn together and I was thinking Batman
could<00:02:49.140> have<00:02:49.260> met<00:02:49.620> Harley<00:02:50.129> Quinn<00:02:50.629> before<00:02:51.629> she

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
could have met Harley Quinn before she

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.400 
could have met Harley Quinn before she
met<00:02:52.680> the<00:02:52.799> Joker<00:02:53.129> and<00:02:53.489> it<00:02:54.420> could<00:02:54.540> be<00:02:54.660> his<00:02:55.049> first

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
met the Joker and it could be his first

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.550 
met the Joker and it could be his first
appearance<00:02:55.980> with<00:02:56.280> poison<00:02:57.090> ivy<00:02:57.209> now<00:02:58.019> cuz<00:02:58.440> you

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
appearance with poison ivy now cuz you

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.869 
appearance with poison ivy now cuz you
do<00:02:58.680> know<00:02:58.799> that<00:02:58.950> Batman's<00:02:59.400> meaning<00:02:59.730> judge

00:02:59.869 --> 00:02:59.879 
do know that Batman's meaning judge

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:01.610 
do know that Batman's meaning judge
Joker<00:03:00.180> for<00:03:00.299> the<00:03:00.420> first<00:03:00.629> time<00:03:00.900> so<00:03:01.200> I<00:03:01.230> don't<00:03:01.500> know

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
Joker for the first time so I don't know

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.890 
Joker for the first time so I don't know
it<00:03:01.829> would<00:03:01.980> be<00:03:02.190> right<00:03:02.700> to<00:03:02.879> have<00:03:03.299> Batman<00:03:03.510> meet

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
it would be right to have Batman meet

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.449 
it would be right to have Batman meet
the<00:03:04.019> Harley<00:03:04.319> Quinn<00:03:04.530> and<00:03:04.739> the<00:03:04.890> Joker<00:03:05.220> in<00:03:05.370> the

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
the Harley Quinn and the Joker in the

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:07.970 
the Harley Quinn and the Joker in the
same<00:03:05.670> night<00:03:05.940> I<00:03:06.269> guess<00:03:06.989> that's<00:03:07.170> okay<00:03:07.260> cuz<00:03:07.829> like

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
same night I guess that's okay cuz like

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:08.930 
same night I guess that's okay cuz like
you<00:03:08.099> just<00:03:08.250> really<00:03:08.459> want<00:03:08.609> to<00:03:08.640> add<00:03:08.790> these

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
you just really want to add these

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.910 
you just really want to add these
characters<00:03:09.420> to<00:03:09.569> the<00:03:09.690> game<00:03:09.930> but<00:03:10.620> it's<00:03:10.739> kind<00:03:10.890> of

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
characters to the game but it's kind of

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.920 
characters to the game but it's kind of
difficult<00:03:11.430> because<00:03:11.549> it<00:03:11.970> is<00:03:12.000> an<00:03:12.269> origin<00:03:12.720> so

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
difficult because it is an origin so

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.720 
difficult because it is an origin so
they're<00:03:13.079> a<00:03:13.109> little<00:03:13.290> more<00:03:13.560> limited<00:03:14.010> but<00:03:14.549> they

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
they're a little more limited but they

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.399 
they're a little more limited but they
did<00:03:14.970> mention<00:03:15.180> like<00:03:15.599> I<00:03:15.810> don't<00:03:15.930> want<00:03:16.260> they

00:03:16.399 --> 00:03:16.409 
did mention like I don't want they

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:17.839 
did mention like I don't want they
mentioned<00:03:17.040> the<00:03:17.099> Creator<00:03:17.400> said<00:03:17.609> they<00:03:17.730> don't

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:17.849 
mentioned the Creator said they don't

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:19.970 
mentioned the Creator said they don't
want<00:03:18.060> this<00:03:18.290> origin<00:03:19.290> thing<00:03:19.470> to<00:03:19.620> get<00:03:19.739> to<00:03:19.889> your

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
want this origin thing to get to your

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.129 
want this origin thing to get to your
head<00:03:20.130> like<00:03:20.370> it's<00:03:20.549> still<00:03:20.849> a<00:03:20.880> Batman<00:03:21.510> game<00:03:21.810> it's

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:22.139 
head like it's still a Batman game it's

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:25.909 
head like it's still a Batman game it's
just<00:03:22.470> an<00:03:22.650> origin<00:03:23.340> to<00:03:24.329> the<00:03:24.480> Arkham<00:03:24.840> games<00:03:25.230> so<00:03:25.889> I

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:25.919 
just an origin to the Arkham games so I

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:27.530 
just an origin to the Arkham games so I
still<00:03:26.310> think<00:03:26.519> they<00:03:26.579> could<00:03:26.760> go<00:03:26.880> with<00:03:26.910> a<00:03:27.090> poison

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
still think they could go with a poison

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.390 
still think they could go with a poison
ivy<00:03:27.630> in<00:03:27.780> Harley<00:03:28.019> Quinn<00:03:28.200> team-up<00:03:28.680> side<00:03:28.980> mission

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
and basically those are all the ideas I

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:33.199 
and basically those are all the ideas I
have<00:03:32.040> for<00:03:32.069> poison<00:03:32.519> ivy<00:03:32.609> of<00:03:32.730> being<00:03:32.879> in<00:03:32.940> the<00:03:33.030> game

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
have for poison ivy of being in the game

there's<00:03:39.209> just<00:03:39.359> so<00:03:39.450> many<00:03:39.540> other<00:03:39.780> ways<00:03:39.930> they

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:40.169 
there's just so many other ways they

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:43.039 
there's just so many other ways they
could<00:03:40.319> do<00:03:40.440> it<00:03:40.590> like<00:03:40.739> the<00:03:41.310> most<00:03:41.760> I<00:03:42.090> want<00:03:42.720> to<00:03:42.900> see

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
could do it like the most I want to see

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:45.770 
could do it like the most I want to see
is<00:03:43.260> Harley<00:03:44.040> Quinn<00:03:44.220> and<00:03:44.370> poison<00:03:44.699> ivy<00:03:44.879> team-up<00:03:45.629> I

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
is Harley Quinn and poison ivy team-up I

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.119 
is Harley Quinn and poison ivy team-up I
think<00:03:46.049> they'll<00:03:46.139> be<00:03:46.260> the<00:03:46.379> most<00:03:46.560> interesting

00:03:47.119 --> 00:03:47.129 
think they'll be the most interesting

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:49.909 
think they'll be the most interesting
and<00:03:47.340> more<00:03:47.430> moist<00:03:47.849> like<00:03:48.359> I<00:03:48.690> don't<00:03:49.530> know<00:03:49.739> it's

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:49.919 
and more moist like I don't know it's

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:51.770 
and more moist like I don't know it's
like<00:03:49.980> you<00:03:50.370> get<00:03:50.459> to<00:03:50.730> in<00:03:50.879> one<00:03:51.060> you<00:03:51.209> know<00:03:51.329> it's<00:03:51.720> a

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
like you get to in one you know it's a

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.720 
like you get to in one you know it's a
win-win<00:03:51.900> situation<00:03:52.139> you<00:03:52.739> get<00:03:52.829> Harley<00:03:53.519> Quinn

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
win-win situation you get Harley Quinn

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.659 
win-win situation you get Harley Quinn
and<00:03:54.000> poison<00:03:54.449> ivy<00:03:54.540> together<00:03:55.109> and<00:03:55.430> I<00:03:56.430> thought

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:56.669 
and poison ivy together and I thought

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:58.159 
and poison ivy together and I thought
pretty<00:03:57.389> interesting<00:03:57.690> because<00:03:57.780> we<00:03:58.019> don't

00:03:58.159 --> 00:03:58.169 
pretty interesting because we don't

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:00.170 
pretty interesting because we don't
really<00:03:58.230> see<00:03:58.470> those<00:03:58.620> to<00:03:58.769> communicate<00:03:59.400> I<00:03:59.699> mean<00:04:00.150> a

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
really see those to communicate I mean a

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.509 
really see those to communicate I mean a
little<00:04:00.599> bit<00:04:00.720> in<00:04:00.840> Arkham<00:04:01.109> Asylum<00:04:01.139> but<00:04:01.889> not<00:04:02.190> at

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
little bit in Arkham Asylum but not at

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:04.759 
little bit in Arkham Asylum but not at
all<00:04:02.549> in<00:04:02.730> Arkham<00:04:03.269> City<00:04:03.510> and<00:04:03.780> I<00:04:04.410> think<00:04:04.650> would<00:04:04.739> be

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
all in Arkham City and I think would be

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:07.640 
all in Arkham City and I think would be
interesting<00:04:05.220> to<00:04:05.310> see<00:04:05.489> a<00:04:05.819> boss<00:04:06.660> battle<00:04:06.900> /sy

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
interesting to see a boss battle /sy

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.159 
interesting to see a boss battle /sy
mission<00:04:08.099> with<00:04:08.879> both<00:04:09.180> of<00:04:09.359> them<00:04:09.510> fighting<00:04:10.019> you

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:10.169 
mission with both of them fighting you

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:12.229 
mission with both of them fighting you
at<00:04:10.290> the<00:04:10.379> same<00:04:10.590> time<00:04:10.889> you<00:04:11.549> know<00:04:11.669> imagine<00:04:12.000> like

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
at the same time you know imagine like

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:14.089 
at the same time you know imagine like
Poison<00:04:12.599> Ivy's<00:04:12.660> plants<00:04:13.199> attacking<00:04:13.709> you<00:04:13.859> while

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:14.099 
Poison Ivy's plants attacking you while

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:15.890 
Poison Ivy's plants attacking you while
Harley<00:04:14.489> Quinn's<00:04:14.760> the<00:04:15.000> one<00:04:15.150> actually<00:04:15.359> fighting

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
Harley Quinn's the one actually fighting

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.779 
Harley Quinn's the one actually fighting
you<00:04:15.989> with<00:04:16.109> a<00:04:16.139> hammer<00:04:16.440> so<00:04:17.190> you<00:04:17.250> know<00:04:17.549> that'd<00:04:17.699> be

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:17.789 
you with a hammer so you know that'd be

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:19.099 
you with a hammer so you know that'd be
really<00:04:17.970> interesting<00:04:18.449> hopefully<00:04:18.810> they<00:04:18.930> do

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
really interesting hopefully they do

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:19.520 
really interesting hopefully they do
that

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
that

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.099 
that
and<00:04:19.620> overall<00:04:20.549> poison<00:04:21.239> ivy<00:04:21.359> could<00:04:21.690> be<00:04:21.780> a<00:04:21.810> side

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
and overall poison ivy could be a side

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:24.920 
and overall poison ivy could be a side
mission<00:04:22.260> Easter<00:04:23.099> egg<00:04:23.219> cameo<00:04:23.669> but<00:04:24.330> what<00:04:24.719> about

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
mission Easter egg cameo but what about

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.110 
mission Easter egg cameo but what about
her<00:04:25.110> as<00:04:25.289> an<00:04:25.409> assassin<00:04:25.710> now<00:04:26.130> boys

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
her as an assassin now boys

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.570 
her as an assassin now boys
isn't<00:04:27.810> an<00:04:28.380> assassin<00:04:29.130> of<00:04:29.160> the<00:04:29.250> DC<00:04:29.550> Universe

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
isn't an assassin of the DC Universe

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.370 
isn't an assassin of the DC Universe
she's<00:04:30.090> not<00:04:30.210> known<00:04:30.360> to<00:04:30.510> be<00:04:30.600> an<00:04:30.660> assassin<00:04:30.870> but<00:04:31.290> it

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
she's not known to be an assassin but it

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:32.540 
she's not known to be an assassin but it
doesn't<00:04:31.620> mean<00:04:31.680> she<00:04:31.830> couldn't<00:04:31.919> be<00:04:32.220> one<00:04:32.370> of<00:04:32.460> the

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
doesn't mean she couldn't be one of the

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.370 
doesn't mean she couldn't be one of the
game<00:04:32.760> there's<00:04:33.330> only<00:04:33.449> three<00:04:33.690> assassins<00:04:34.139> left

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
game there's only three assassins left

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.100 
game there's only three assassins left
at<00:04:34.560> the<00:04:34.680> point<00:04:34.889> I'm<00:04:35.010> recording<00:04:35.490> this<00:04:35.610> and<00:04:36.110> one

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
at the point I'm recording this and one

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
at the point I'm recording this and one
of<00:04:37.169> them's<00:04:37.320> automatically<00:04:37.770> gonna<00:04:37.919> be<00:04:37.979> Lady

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
of them's automatically gonna be Lady

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:39.740 
of them's automatically gonna be Lady
Shiva<00:04:38.370> so<00:04:38.639> there's<00:04:38.790> really<00:04:38.940> only<00:04:39.030> two<00:04:39.210> left

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
Shiva so there's really only two left

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.330 
Shiva so there's really only two left
and<00:04:39.990> I<00:04:40.590> don't<00:04:40.830> think<00:04:40.979> they're<00:04:41.070> gonna<00:04:41.160> choose

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
and I don't think they're gonna choose

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:42.260 
and I don't think they're gonna choose
poison<00:04:41.760> ivy

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
poison ivy

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:43.700 
poison ivy
I<00:04:42.300> do<00:04:42.479> think<00:04:42.750> poison<00:04:42.990> ivy<00:04:43.080> has<00:04:43.260> a<00:04:43.290> chance<00:04:43.560> of

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
I do think poison ivy has a chance of

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:46.430 
I do think poison ivy has a chance of
being<00:04:43.830> in<00:04:43.949> the<00:04:44.040> game<00:04:44.510> but<00:04:45.510> I<00:04:45.570> don't<00:04:45.990> think

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
being in the game but I don't think

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.200 
being in the game but I don't think
they're<00:04:46.949> going<00:04:47.100> to<00:04:47.250> add<00:04:47.520> her<00:04:47.729> as<00:04:47.850> an<00:04:47.970> assassin

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
they're going to add her as an assassin

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.689 
they're going to add her as an assassin
I<00:04:48.660> mean<00:04:49.080> if<00:04:49.169> it<00:04:49.290> did<00:04:49.500> I<00:04:49.740> mean<00:04:50.190> I<00:04:50.220> wouldn't<00:04:50.550> care

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:50.699 
I mean if it did I mean I wouldn't care

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:52.250 
I mean if it did I mean I wouldn't care
at<00:04:50.729> all<00:04:50.850> above<00:04:51.270> it<00:04:51.389> but<00:04:51.840> that's<00:04:51.960> pretty<00:04:52.139> much
