so<00:01:54.110> we're<00:01:54.200> trying<00:01:54.350> to<00:01:54.439> sandwich<00:01:54.740> it<00:01:54.860> in<00:01:55.039> there

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
so we're trying to sandwich it in there

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.120 
so we're trying to sandwich it in there
now<00:01:56.330> once<00:01:56.899> it's<00:01:57.049> actually<00:01:57.380> underside<00:01:58.009> your

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
now once it's actually underside your

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:05.350 
now once it's actually underside your
dominant<00:01:58.750> role<00:01:59.750> is<00:01:59.840> pretty<00:01:59.990> easy

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.490 

so<00:02:06.360> if<00:02:06.450> I<00:02:06.540> want<00:02:06.750> to<00:02:06.780> tuck<00:02:06.990> it<00:02:07.110> up<00:02:07.229> against
