monkeys<00:02:16.380> are<00:02:16.620> really<00:02:17.370> really<00:02:18.300> powerful<00:02:18.510> and

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
monkeys are really really powerful and

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.410 
monkeys are really really powerful and
btd5<00:02:20.220> and<00:02:20.880> battles<00:02:21.540> not<00:02:22.080> so<00:02:22.290> much<00:02:22.470> in<00:02:23.420> battles

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
btd5 and battles not so much in battles

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.390 
btd5 and battles not so much in battles
there<00:02:24.510> way<00:02:24.959> too<00:02:25.020> expensive<00:02:25.590> for<00:02:25.860> their<00:02:26.100> price

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
there way too expensive for their price

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.270 
there way too expensive for their price
and<00:02:26.760> in<00:02:27.390> battles<00:02:28.290> i<00:02:28.440> think<00:02:28.680> they<00:02:28.770> should<00:02:28.980> get

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
and in battles i think they should get

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.030 
and in battles i think they should get
like<00:02:29.580> a<00:02:29.640> price<00:02:29.970> drop<00:02:30.209> or<00:02:30.510> something<00:02:31.040> same

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
like a price drop or something same

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.040 
like a price drop or something same
thing<00:02:32.220> goes<00:02:32.250> for<00:02:32.430> glue<00:02:32.790> Gunners<00:02:33.180> I<00:02:33.390> think<00:02:33.720> Lou

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
thing goes for glue Gunners I think Lou

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.440 
thing goes for glue Gunners I think Lou
Gunners<00:02:34.410> should<00:02:34.620> also<00:02:34.830> get<00:02:35.190> like<00:02:35.459> a<00:02:35.700> buff<00:02:36.180> in

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
Gunners should also get like a buff in

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.110 
Gunners should also get like a buff in
some<00:02:37.050> way<00:02:37.200> even<00:02:38.070> though<00:02:38.160> I<00:02:38.190> already<00:02:38.580> said<00:02:38.940> this

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
some way even though I already said this

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.810 
some way even though I already said this
in<00:02:39.360> another<00:02:39.600> video<00:02:39.959> but<00:02:40.170> I'm<00:02:40.650> just<00:02:41.160> restating

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
in another video but I'm just restating

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.210 
in another video but I'm just restating
them<00:02:41.940> now<00:02:42.170> as<00:02:43.170> you<00:02:43.380> saw<00:02:43.530> in<00:02:43.560> the<00:02:43.770> beginning<00:02:43.860> of

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
them now as you saw in the beginning of

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.640 
them now as you saw in the beginning of
the<00:02:44.340> video<00:02:44.400> I<00:02:44.880> learned<00:02:45.870> how<00:02:45.930> to<00:02:46.020> make<00:02:46.170> csgo

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
the video I learned how to make csgo

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.280 
the video I learned how to make csgo
skins<00:02:46.709> or<00:02:47.130> at<00:02:47.340> least<00:02:47.489> custom<00:02:47.910> ones<00:02:48.090> but<00:02:48.780> what

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
skins or at least custom ones but what

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.140 
skins or at least custom ones but what
you<00:02:49.410> might<00:02:49.620> also<00:02:49.860> not<00:02:50.190> know<00:02:50.400> well<00:02:50.940> actually

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
you might also not know well actually

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.030 
you might also not know well actually
you<00:02:51.360> probably<00:02:51.570> know<00:02:51.750> this<00:02:51.900> if<00:02:52.080> you<00:02:52.260> watch<00:02:53.010> my

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
you probably know this if you watch my

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.610 
you probably know this if you watch my
videos<00:02:53.190> but<00:02:53.640> if<00:02:53.880> you<00:02:54.450> don't<00:02:54.660> I<00:02:54.959> also<00:02:55.290> made<00:02:55.590> a

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
videos but if you don't I also made a

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.670 
videos but if you don't I also made a
csgo<00:02:56.100> map<00:02:56.310> the<00:02:57.000> thing<00:02:57.180> you<00:02:57.209> uploaded<00:02:58.200> was<00:02:58.380> just

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.640 
csgo map the thing you uploaded was just
a<00:02:58.799> little<00:02:58.950> like<00:02:59.340> teaser<00:02:59.880> or<00:03:00.060> something<00:03:00.650> which

I<00:03:23.239> still<00:03:24.239> need<00:03:24.420> quite<00:03:25.170> a<00:03:25.350> bit<00:03:25.380> of<00:03:25.890> grinding<00:03:26.640> to

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
I still need quite a bit of grinding to

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.620 
I still need quite a bit of grinding to
do<00:03:27.150> four<00:03:27.780> levels<00:03:28.260> and<00:03:28.440> all<00:03:28.739> the<00:03:28.890> towers<00:03:29.630> after

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.759 
not being high enough rank my top
priority<00:03:53.890> would<00:03:54.099> be<00:03:54.159> to<00:03:54.370> get<00:03:55.150> a<00:03:55.209> blue<00:03:55.540> the<00:03:56.230> 42

priority would be to get a blue the 42
bloom<00:03:57.069> chipper<00:03:57.459> because<00:03:58.090> that<00:03:59.099> basically

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
bloom chipper because that basically

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.929 
bloom chipper because that basically
destroy<00:04:01.150> is<00:04:01.299> the<00:04:01.540> destroyer<00:04:01.989> of<00:04:02.200> Moab's<00:04:03.099> like

00:04:03.929 --> 00:04:03.939

destroy is the destroyer of Moab's like
not<00:04:04.269> even<00:04:04.420> joking<00:04:05.760> something<00:04:06.760> I<00:04:06.879> like<00:04:07.060> about

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
not even joking something I like about

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:12.809 
not even joking something I like about
btd5<00:04:07.829> steam<00:04:08.829> is<00:04:09.099> that<00:04:10.590> the<00:04:11.590> farms<00:04:12.310> actually

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:12.819 
btd5 steam is that the farms actually

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:15.030 
btd5 steam is that the farms actually
have<00:04:13.180> snapped<00:04:13.810> to<00:04:14.140> like<00:04:14.379> some<00:04:14.590> sort<00:04:14.769> of<00:04:14.860> grid

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
have snapped to like some sort of grid

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.560 
have snapped to like some sort of grid
or<00:04:15.159> something<00:04:15.489> which<00:04:15.640> makes<00:04:15.940> placing

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
or something which makes placing

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.900 
or something which makes placing
multiple<00:04:16.720> of<00:04:17.199> them<00:04:17.620> side<00:04:18.100> by<00:04:18.130> side<00:04:18.280> much

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
multiple of them side by side much

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:23.939 
multiple of them side by side much
easier<00:04:19.269> it<00:04:19.479> like<00:04:20.320> an<00:04:20.560> BTD<00:04:21.039> a<00:04:21.660> flat<00:04:22.660> up<00:04:23.020> note<00:04:23.770> not

00:04:23.939 --> 00:04:23.949 
easier it like an BTD a flat up note not
