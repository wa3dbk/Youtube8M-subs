step is to notice when you're feeling

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.760 
step is to notice when you're feeling
stressed<00:01:17.000> now<00:01:18.000> this<00:01:18.330> may<00:01:18.570> seem<00:01:18.630> so<00:01:19.470> obvious

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
stressed now this may seem so obvious

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.070 
stressed now this may seem so obvious
and<00:01:20.280> so<00:01:20.369> simple<00:01:20.700> but<00:01:21.030> it's<00:01:21.210> easy<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:21.720> overlook

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
and so simple but it's easy to overlook

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.070 
and so simple but it's easy to overlook
in<00:01:22.650> fact<00:01:23.040> often<00:01:23.549> times<00:01:23.820> because<00:01:24.659> we're<00:01:24.840> so

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
in fact often times because we're so

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.130 
in fact often times because we're so
accustomed<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.920> feeling<00:01:26.130> stressed<00:01:26.869> we<00:01:27.869> tend

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
accustomed to feeling stressed we tend

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.050 
accustomed to feeling stressed we tend
to<00:01:28.229> just<00:01:28.470> overlook<00:01:28.950> it<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:29.220> we<00:01:29.310> power<00:01:29.610> through

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
to just overlook it and we power through

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.719 
to just overlook it and we power through
but<00:01:30.630> this<00:01:30.840> is<00:01:31.049> absolutely<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:32.520> wrong

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
but this is absolutely the wrong

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.850 
but this is absolutely the wrong
strategy<00:01:33.090> instead<00:01:33.630> simply<00:01:34.110> notice<00:01:34.710> that

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
strategy instead simply notice that

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.319 
strategy instead simply notice that

you're feeling stress that's step 1 step
2<00:01:36.799> let<00:01:37.799> go<00:01:38.009> now<00:01:38.820> before<00:01:39.630> you<00:01:39.720> think<00:01:39.960> that's

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
2 let go now before you think that's

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.420 
2 let go now before you think that's
easier<00:01:40.950> said<00:01:40.979> than<00:01:41.220> done

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
actually it's far easier done than it is

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.749 
actually it's far easier done than it is
to<00:01:46.020> hold<00:01:46.259> on<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.860> stress<00:01:47.100> and<00:01:47.460> I'm<00:01:47.640> going
