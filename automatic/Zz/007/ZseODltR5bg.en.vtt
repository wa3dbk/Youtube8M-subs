00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
need to kind of know a lot more about

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.620 
need to kind of know a lot more about
these<00:01:43.560> players<00:01:43.799> so<00:01:43.979> if<00:01:44.880> you<00:01:45.000> do<00:01:45.149> see<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.450> black

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
these players so if you do see the black

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.840 
these players so if you do see the black
stars<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.110> best<00:01:46.320> thing<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:46.560> do<00:01:46.829> is<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.610> keep

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
stars the best thing to do is to keep

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.700 
stars the best thing to do is to keep
scouting<00:01:48.210> them<00:01:48.509> as<00:01:48.630> much<00:01:48.780> as<00:01:48.990> possible<00:01:49.049> and

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
scouting them as much as possible and

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.429 
scouting them as much as possible and
then<00:01:50.189> you're<00:01:50.369> gonna<00:01:50.520> get<00:01:50.790> kind<00:01:51.390> of<00:01:51.479> a<00:01:51.659> bit<00:01:52.200> more

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
then you're gonna get kind of a bit more

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.410 
then you're gonna get kind of a bit more
of<00:01:52.530> an<00:01:52.619> idea<00:01:52.950> of<00:01:53.009> exactly<00:01:53.159> how<00:01:53.909> good<00:01:54.149> your

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
of an idea of exactly how good your

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.850 
of an idea of exactly how good your
scout<00:01:54.659> actually<00:01:55.049> things<00:01:55.229> these<00:01:55.380> players<00:01:55.649> are

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
scout actually things these players are

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.999 
scout actually things these players are
and<00:01:56.030> but<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.210> black<00:01:57.390> stars<00:01:57.750> basically<00:01:58.439> it's

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
and but the black stars basically it's

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.740 
and but the black stars basically it's
just<00:01:59.100> an<00:01:59.369> opinion<00:01:59.640> basically<00:02:00.030> so<00:02:00.479> I<00:02:00.509> just

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
just an opinion basically so I just

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:01.910 
just an opinion basically so I just
wanted<00:02:00.930> to<00:02:01.020> clear<00:02:01.140> that<00:02:01.290> out<00:02:01.350> for<00:02:01.590> everybody

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
wanted to clear that out for everybody

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.469 
wanted to clear that out for everybody
just<00:02:01.979> so<00:02:02.280> everyone<00:02:02.579> exactly<00:02:03.000> knows<00:02:03.119> exactly

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
just so everyone exactly knows exactly

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.139 
just so everyone exactly knows exactly
what<00:02:03.810> they<00:02:03.899> mean<00:02:04.369> they're<00:02:05.369> they're<00:02:05.700> not<00:02:05.909> the

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
what they mean they're they're not the

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.240 
what they mean they're they're not the
you<00:02:06.600> know<00:02:06.719> exact<00:02:07.229> potential<00:02:07.890> that<00:02:08.039> players

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
you know exact potential that players

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.309 
you know exact potential that players
will<00:02:08.459> get<00:02:08.640> to<00:02:08.940> it's<00:02:09.660> just<00:02:09.840> literally<00:02:10.200> the
