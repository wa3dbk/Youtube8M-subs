00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:21.690 

you<00:02:16.750> get<00:02:16.900> this<00:02:17.020> nice<00:02:17.230> little<00:02:17.380> crosshair<00:02:20.700> whoa

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
you get this nice little crosshair whoa

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.590 
you get this nice little crosshair whoa
and<00:02:22.950> it<00:02:23.950> can<00:02:24.130> delete<00:02:24.490> pretty<00:02:25.000> much<00:02:25.240> anything

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
and it can delete pretty much anything

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:43.460 
and it can delete pretty much anything
so<00:02:26.110> if<00:02:26.170> we<00:02:26.320> delete<00:02:26.620> salter<00:02:30.510> it's<00:02:31.510> gone<00:02:31.900> I<00:02:32.290> think

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:50.000 

not<00:02:44.100> sure<00:02:44.340> why<00:02:44.550> this<00:02:44.610> is<00:02:44.940> so<00:02:45.150> slow<00:02:46.430> but<00:02:48.740> that<00:02:49.740> is

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
not sure why this is so slow but that is

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.620 
not sure why this is so slow but that is
about<00:02:50.190> it<00:02:50.370> for<00:02:50.870> PC<00:02:51.870> live<00:02:52.230> guard
