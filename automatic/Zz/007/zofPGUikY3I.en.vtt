00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.820 
run d1 cross country now reminded me
that<00:00:14.969> I<00:00:15.150> should<00:00:15.570> be<00:00:15.599> telling<00:00:16.199> you<00:00:16.260> what<00:00:16.560> these

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
that I should be telling you what these

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.929 
that I should be telling you what these
great<00:00:17.430> runners<00:00:17.970> do<00:00:18.359> so<00:00:19.320> first<00:00:19.560> the<00:00:20.550> one<00:00:20.699> thing

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
great runners do so first the one thing

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.120 
great runners do so first the one thing
I<00:00:21.060> noticed<00:00:21.480> was<00:00:21.680> great<00:00:22.680> cross-country

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
I noticed was great cross-country

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.450 
I noticed was great cross-country
runners<00:00:23.970> use<00:00:24.420> other<00:00:25.070> cross-country<00:00:26.070> runners

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
runners use other cross-country runners

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.000 
runners use other cross-country runners
what<00:00:26.849> I<00:00:26.880> mean<00:00:27.150> by<00:00:27.330> that<00:00:27.359> is<00:00:27.840> they're<00:00:28.199> drafting

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
what I mean by that is they're drafting

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.339 
what I mean by that is they're drafting
off<00:00:29.189> of<00:00:29.400> other<00:00:29.609> people<00:00:30.150> so<00:00:30.179> then<00:00:30.779> they're<00:00:31.140> not

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
off of other people so then they're not

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.590 
off of other people so then they're not
working<00:00:31.590> as<00:00:31.949> hard<00:00:32.399> because<00:00:32.850> they're<00:00:33.390> getting

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
working as hard because they're getting

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.319 
working as hard because they're getting
less<00:00:33.989> wind<00:00:34.350> in<00:00:34.559> their<00:00:34.710> face<00:00:34.920> they're<00:00:35.670> using

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
less wind in their face they're using

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.569 
less wind in their face they're using
their<00:00:36.540> teammates<00:00:37.200> this<00:00:37.530> is<00:00:37.710> a<00:00:37.739> huge<00:00:38.340> thing

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
tip for the race is to run the tangent

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.569 
tip for the race is to run the tangent
on<00:01:26.640> turns<00:01:27.590> everyone<00:01:28.590> knows<00:01:28.860> you<00:01:29.130> should<00:01:29.340> hug

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
on turns everyone knows you should hug

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
the inside of a tight turn but when you

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.760 
the inside of a tight turn but when you
come<00:01:32.280> off<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.790> turn<00:01:33.030> if<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:33.990> next<00:01:34.229> one's<00:01:34.530> any

come off the turn if the next one's any

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.609 
come off the turn if the next one's any
differing<00:01:35.640> direction<00:01:36.390> then<00:01:37.020> you've<00:01:37.229> got<00:01:37.439> to

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
differing direction then you've got to

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.310 
differing direction then you've got to
cut<00:01:37.829> across<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.520> course<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:39.390> get<00:01:39.720> tight<00:01:40.020> to

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
cut across the course and get tight to

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.649 
cut across the course and get tight to
that<00:01:40.350> turn<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:41.280> don't<00:01:41.729> always<00:01:41.939> run<00:01:42.210> right<00:01:42.479> in

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
that turn to don't always run right in

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.440 
that turn to don't always run right in
the<00:01:42.780> middle<00:01:42.990> of<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.320> course<00:01:43.649> run<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.640> tangent

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
the middle of the course run the tangent

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.219 
the middle of the course run the tangent
between<00:01:46.079> two<00:01:47.060> different<00:01:48.060> direction<00:01:48.509> turns

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
between two different direction turns

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.460 
between two different direction turns
just<00:01:49.740> look<00:01:49.950> at<00:01:50.100> this<00:01:50.340> lovely<00:01:51.079> graphic<00:01:52.079> I<00:01:52.200> made

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
just look at this lovely graphic I made

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.340 
just look at this lovely graphic I made
for<00:01:52.799> you<00:01:52.979> and<00:01:53.220> see<00:01:53.579> how<00:01:53.790> it's<00:01:54.360> longer<00:01:54.720> if<00:01:55.140> you

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
for you and see how it's longer if you

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.569 
for you and see how it's longer if you
just<00:01:55.530> stay<00:01:55.740> in<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.890> middle<00:01:56.009> of<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.340> course

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
just stay in the middle of the course

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.480 
just stay in the middle of the course
you<00:01:56.820> want<00:01:57.000> to<00:01:57.090> run<00:01:57.240> shorter<00:01:57.869> if<00:01:58.049> you<00:01:58.170> can

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
you want to run shorter if you can

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.100

I<00:02:03.960> suggest<00:02:04.950> picking<00:02:05.280> different<00:02:06.060> points<00:02:06.630> on

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
I suggest picking different points on

I suggest picking different points on
the<00:02:06.840> course<00:02:07.079> where<00:02:07.350> you<00:02:07.380> know<00:02:07.590> what<00:02:07.740> you're

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
the course where you know what you're

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.119 
the course where you know what you're
going<00:02:08.099> to<00:02:08.160> move<00:02:08.429> up<00:02:08.640> some<00:02:09.330> easier<00:02:09.959> ones<00:02:10.319> to<00:02:10.590> do

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
going to move up some easier ones to do

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.000 
going to move up some easier ones to do
and<00:02:11.819> you<00:02:11.940> don't<00:02:12.120> have<00:02:12.300> to<00:02:12.450> do<00:02:12.569> this

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
and you don't have to do this

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.710 
and you don't have to do this
but<00:02:13.099> an<00:02:13.220> easier<00:02:13.580> one<00:02:13.760> is<00:02:13.939> at<00:02:14.090> the<00:02:14.120> bottom<00:02:14.239> of<00:02:14.629> a

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720

hill<00:02:14.900> because<00:02:15.230> you<00:02:15.319> already<00:02:15.470> have<00:02:15.680> some

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
hill because you already have some

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.860

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
momentum going you're going fast just

hold<00:02:18.110> that<00:02:18.230> pace<00:02:18.439> make<00:02:19.310> a<00:02:19.340> surge<00:02:19.640> there<00:02:20.060> on

hold that pace make a surge there on
turns<00:02:21.349> is<00:02:21.709> another<00:02:21.980> great<00:02:22.220> place<00:02:22.459> to<00:02:22.790> make<00:02:22.939> a

turns is another great place to make a

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000 
turns is another great place to make a
move<00:02:23.329> especially<00:02:23.870> blind<00:02:24.200> turns<00:02:24.560> if<00:02:24.860> you're

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
move especially blind turns if you're

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.949 
move especially blind turns if you're
trying<00:02:25.250> to<00:02:25.310> get<00:02:25.730> some<00:02:25.909> distance<00:02:26.120> on<00:02:26.510> someone

trying to get some distance on someone

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:28.869 
trying to get some distance on someone
that<00:02:27.560> means<00:02:27.769> when<00:02:27.980> you<00:02:28.099> come<00:02:28.129> around<00:02:28.430> the<00:02:28.670> turn

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:28.879 
that means when you come around the turn

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:31.899 
that means when you come around the turn
make<00:02:29.659> a<00:02:29.690> surge<00:02:30.110> try<00:02:30.650> and<00:02:30.860> get<00:02:31.040> some<00:02:31.220> separation

00:02:31.899 --> 00:02:31.909 
make a surge try and get some separation

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:34.869 
make a surge try and get some separation
from<00:02:32.090> people<00:02:32.540> that<00:02:32.750> are<00:02:32.989> behind<00:02:33.170> so<00:02:33.980> make<00:02:34.459> some

00:02:34.869 --> 00:02:34.879 
from people that are behind so make some

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:37.300 
from people that are behind so make some
moves<00:02:35.180> during<00:02:35.870> the<00:02:36.049> race<00:02:36.290> my<00:02:36.500> last<00:02:36.769> tip<00:02:37.099> is

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
moves during the race my last tip is

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.059 
moves during the race my last tip is
don't<00:02:37.670> wait<00:02:37.909> to<00:02:38.180> kick<00:02:38.480> the<00:02:39.349> earlier<00:02:39.769> the

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
don't wait to kick the earlier the

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:40.509 
don't wait to kick the earlier the
better

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:40.519 
better

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:42.640 
better
I<00:02:40.730> was<00:02:41.090> surprised<00:02:41.450> in<00:02:41.780> this<00:02:41.989> division<00:02:42.530> one

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
I was surprised in this division one

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.069 
I was surprised in this division one
cross-country<00:02:43.340> race<00:02:43.519> there<00:02:43.790> are<00:02:43.819> no

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:44.079 
cross-country race there are no

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:46.410 
cross-country race there are no
incredibly<00:02:45.079> wicked<00:02:45.470> kicks<00:02:45.799> at<00:02:46.040> the<00:02:46.280> end

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
incredibly wicked kicks at the end

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.970 
incredibly wicked kicks at the end
possibly<00:02:47.420> because<00:02:47.780> the<00:02:47.959> race<00:02:48.170> is<00:02:48.200> longer<00:02:48.950> and

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
possibly because the race is longer and

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.399 
possibly because the race is longer and
tougher<00:02:49.549> but<00:02:49.760> also<00:02:50.180> because<00:02:50.569> people<00:02:50.599> really

00:02:51.399 --> 00:02:51.409 
tougher but also because people really

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:55.690 
tougher but also because people really
push<00:02:52.159> it<00:02:52.209> earlier<00:02:53.209> and<00:02:53.950> before<00:02:54.950> the<00:02:55.129> final<00:02:55.519> 100

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
push it earlier and before the final 100

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.360 
push it earlier and before the final 100
meters<00:02:56.389> of<00:02:56.690> the<00:02:56.959> race<00:02:57.200> so<00:02:57.799> if<00:02:57.920> you<00:02:58.010> want<00:02:58.159> to<00:02:58.250> run

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
meters of the race so if you want to run

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.819 
meters of the race so if you want to run
a<00:02:58.430> good<00:02:58.670> time<00:02:59.030> make<00:02:59.540> that<00:02:59.810> move<00:03:00.109> a<00:03:00.379> little<00:03:00.590> bit

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:00.829 
a good time make that move a little bit

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:03.190 
a good time make that move a little bit
earlier<00:03:01.370> if<00:03:01.609> you<00:03:01.730> normally<00:03:02.150> kick<00:03:02.420> with<00:03:03.170> a

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
earlier if you normally kick with a

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.830 
earlier if you normally kick with a
