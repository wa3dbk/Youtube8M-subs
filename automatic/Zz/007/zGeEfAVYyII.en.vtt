have to geek out anything that we do

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.800 
have to geek out anything that we do
right<00:02:02.310> like<00:02:02.520> any<00:02:02.729> activity<00:02:03.210> we<00:02:03.390> have<00:02:03.479> to<00:02:03.570> get

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
right like any activity we have to get

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.200 
right like any activity we have to get
out<00:02:03.930> so<00:02:04.229> for<00:02:05.100> this<00:02:05.189> event<00:02:05.490> we<00:02:05.700> thought<00:02:05.909> okay

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
out so for this event we thought okay

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.490 
out so for this event we thought okay
let's<00:02:06.240> let's<00:02:06.719> do<00:02:06.810> have<00:02:06.960> some<00:02:07.079> fun<00:02:07.200> with<00:02:07.290> spring

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
let's let's do have some fun with spring

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.529 
let's let's do have some fun with spring
the<00:02:07.950> cars<00:02:08.160> out<00:02:08.399> let's<00:02:08.759> bring<00:02:08.819> koecher<00:02:09.179> out

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
the cars out let's bring koecher out

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.780 
the cars out let's bring koecher out
that<00:02:09.899> transmitters<00:02:10.619> everything<00:02:11.009> but<00:02:11.550> let's

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
that transmitters everything but let's

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:12.870 
that transmitters everything but let's
step<00:02:12.000> it<00:02:12.120> up<00:02:12.180> a<00:02:12.330> notch

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
step it up a notch

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.090 
step it up a notch
and<00:02:13.030> release<00:02:13.690> of<00:02:13.810> microsoft<00:02:13.900> technologies<00:02:14.380> to

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
and release of microsoft technologies to

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.310 
and release of microsoft technologies to
kind<00:02:15.280> of<00:02:15.370> hack<00:02:15.820> into<00:02:16.030> everything<00:02:16.360> and<00:02:16.720> maybe

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
kind of hack into everything and maybe

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.900 
kind of hack into everything and maybe
have<00:02:17.500> some<00:02:17.620> fun<00:02:17.770> with<00:02:17.890> it<00:02:17.950> so<00:02:18.160> one<00:02:18.730> thing<00:02:18.820> we

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
have some fun with it so one thing we

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.230 
have some fun with it so one thing we
have<00:02:19.120> is<00:02:19.420> we<00:02:19.630> took<00:02:19.780> the<00:02:20.020> windows<00:02:20.320> phone<00:02:20.560> 7<00:02:20.980> and

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
have is we took the windows phone 7 and

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.370 
have is we took the windows phone 7 and
we<00:02:22.240> wrote<00:02:22.420> some<00:02:22.570> applications<00:02:23.200> that

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
we wrote some applications that

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.040 
we wrote some applications that
basically<00:02:24.010> allow<00:02:24.310> the<00:02:24.370> phone<00:02:24.790> to<00:02:24.900> control<00:02:25.900> the

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
basically allow the phone to control the

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.230 
basically allow the phone to control the
transmitter<00:02:26.590> so<00:02:27.310> the<00:02:27.430> phone<00:02:27.610> talks<00:02:27.940> to<00:02:28.210> a

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
transmitter so the phone talks to a

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.420 
transmitter so the phone talks to a
little<00:02:28.570> netduino<00:02:29.110> device<00:02:29.440> that<00:02:29.770> actually<00:02:29.890> was

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
little netduino device that actually was

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.520 
little netduino device that actually was
wired<00:02:30.700> right<00:02:30.940> into<00:02:31.000> a<00:02:31.210> transmitter<00:02:31.720> and<00:02:31.990> then

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
wired right into a transmitter and then

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.410 
wired right into a transmitter and then
using<00:02:32.920> the<00:02:32.980> accelerometer<00:02:33.250> on<00:02:33.700> the<00:02:33.790> phone<00:02:34.000> and

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
using the accelerometer on the phone and

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:35.880 
using the accelerometer on the phone and
we<00:02:34.540> have<00:02:34.630> some<00:02:34.810> touch<00:02:35.020> screen<00:02:35.290> options<00:02:35.710> for

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
we have some touch screen options for

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.620 
we have some touch screen options for
throttle<00:02:36.340> you<00:02:36.550> can<00:02:36.910> actually<00:02:37.150> use<00:02:37.300> the<00:02:37.450> phone

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
throttle you can actually use the phone

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.240 
throttle you can actually use the phone
to<00:02:37.660> drive<00:02:37.960> the<00:02:38.080> cars<00:02:38.260> around<00:02:38.470> the<00:02:38.560> track<00:02:38.620> and

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
to drive the cars around the track and

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.160 
to drive the cars around the track and
the<00:02:39.370> control<00:02:39.670> is<00:02:39.820> actually<00:02:40.150> remarkably<00:02:40.990> good

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
the control is actually remarkably good

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:42.960 
the control is actually remarkably good
we<00:02:41.410> were<00:02:41.500> surprised<00:02:41.860> at<00:02:42.040> how<00:02:42.160> good<00:02:42.430> the

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
we were surprised at how good the

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.940 
we were surprised at how good the
control<00:02:43.300> is<00:02:43.510> so<00:02:44.320> we've<00:02:44.410> got<00:02:44.530> that<00:02:44.740> and<00:02:44.920> then

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
control is so we've got that and then

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.100 
control is so we've got that and then
another<00:02:45.190> thing<00:02:45.610> we<00:02:45.730> did<00:02:45.970> is<00:02:46.240> we<00:02:46.270> took<00:02:46.630> a<00:02:46.960> bunch

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
another thing we did is we took a bunch

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.410 
another thing we did is we took a bunch
of<00:02:47.290> networks<00:02:47.830> cameras<00:02:48.430> little<00:02:48.850> cameras<00:02:49.300> with

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
of networks cameras little cameras with

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.570 
of networks cameras little cameras with
IP<00:02:49.570> addresses<00:02:50.230> we<00:02:50.860> put<00:02:51.010> them<00:02:51.130> all<00:02:51.220> around<00:02:51.340> the

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
IP addresses we put them all around the

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.360 
IP addresses we put them all around the
track<00:02:51.820> and<00:02:52.180> they<00:02:53.140> plug<00:02:53.620> into<00:02:53.650> it<00:02:53.950> net

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
track and they plug into it net

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.180 
track and they plug into it net
application<00:02:55.060> that<00:02:55.600> basically<00:02:56.260> follows<00:02:57.010> the

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
application that basically follows the

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.310 
application that basically follows the
cars<00:02:57.430> around<00:02:57.790> the<00:02:57.940> track<00:02:58.030> by<00:02:58.900> their<00:02:59.080> color

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
cars around the track by their color

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.410 
cars around the track by their color
motion<00:02:59.710> and<00:03:00.010> color<00:03:00.160> and<00:03:00.430> it'll<00:03:01.000> automatically

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
motion and color and it'll automatically

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.660 
motion and color and it'll automatically
switch<00:03:01.750> to<00:03:01.780> the<00:03:02.530> lead<00:03:02.710> car<00:03:03.010> on<00:03:03.280> a<00:03:03.340> video

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
switch to the lead car on a video

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.700 
switch to the lead car on a video
display<00:03:03.940> so<00:03:04.690> it's<00:03:04.780> like<00:03:04.870> a<00:03:04.900> NASCAR<00:03:05.440> coverage

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:05.710 
display so it's like a NASCAR coverage

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:07.320 
display so it's like a NASCAR coverage
where<00:03:06.010> it's<00:03:06.100> always<00:03:06.250> following<00:03:06.670> the<00:03:06.760> car<00:03:06.970> to

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
where it's always following the car to

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.180 
where it's always following the car to
every<00:03:07.630> camera<00:03:08.050> angle<00:03:08.320> it's<00:03:08.710> all<00:03:08.830> automated

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
every camera angle it's all automated

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.220 
every camera angle it's all automated
using<00:03:10.000> those<00:03:10.450> pretty<00:03:10.690> eyes<00:03:10.780> so<00:03:10.960> that's<00:03:11.110> fun

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
using those pretty eyes so that's fun

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:12.420 
using those pretty eyes so that's fun
stuff<00:03:11.440> so<00:03:11.560> we<00:03:11.620> have<00:03:11.710> to<00:03:11.800> kick<00:03:11.920> it<00:03:12.040> out<00:03:12.160> so<00:03:12.400> we

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
stuff so we have to kick it out so we

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.880 
stuff so we have to kick it out so we
have<00:03:12.580> a<00:03:12.610> good<00:03:12.790> combination<00:03:13.060> of<00:03:13.570> RC<00:03:14.290> and<00:03:14.680> Mike's

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
have a good combination of RC and Mike's

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.310 
have a good combination of RC and Mike's
LED<00:03:15.010> technology<00:03:15.130> any<00:03:15.700> of<00:03:16.420> you<00:03:16.540> guys<00:03:16.630> how<00:03:17.260> many

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
LED technology any of you guys how many

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:18.870 
LED technology any of you guys how many
cars<00:03:17.590> we<00:03:17.680> planned<00:03:17.980> on<00:03:18.130> have<00:03:18.340> the<00:03:18.490> track<00:03:18.700> at<00:03:18.820> the

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
cars we planned on have the track at the

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.270 
cars we planned on have the track at the
same<00:03:19.060> time<00:03:19.270> well<00:03:19.810> part<00:03:20.620> of<00:03:20.680> the<00:03:20.770> challenge<00:03:20.980> is

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
same time well part of the challenge is

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.740 
same time well part of the challenge is
that<00:03:21.490> most<00:03:21.850> the<00:03:21.970> attendees<00:03:22.360> were<00:03:22.480> going<00:03:22.600> to<00:03:22.690> be

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
that most the attendees were going to be

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.750 
that most the attendees were going to be
driving<00:03:22.930> they<00:03:23.530> haven't<00:03:23.710> driven<00:03:24.220> RC<00:03:24.550> cars

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
driving they haven't driven RC cars

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.580 
driving they haven't driven RC cars
before<00:03:24.940> so<00:03:25.360> we<00:03:25.450> had<00:03:25.480> to<00:03:25.600> make<00:03:25.720> sure<00:03:25.930> we<00:03:26.140> made

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
before so we had to make sure we made

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.920 
before so we had to make sure we made
the<00:03:26.740> lanes<00:03:27.160> really<00:03:27.490> wide<00:03:27.700> and<00:03:28.120> of<00:03:28.420> course<00:03:28.690> we

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
the lanes really wide and of course we

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.420 
the lanes really wide and of course we
wanted<00:03:29.140> to<00:03:29.170> slow<00:03:29.410> the<00:03:29.560> cars<00:03:29.770> down<00:03:30.070> a<00:03:30.100> little

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
wanted to slow the cars down a little

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.060 
wanted to slow the cars down a little
bit<00:03:30.700> so<00:03:31.060> it's<00:03:31.210> easier<00:03:31.540> for<00:03:31.720> everyone<00:03:31.960> and<00:03:32.410> so

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.070 
bit so it's easier for everyone and so

great<00:03:50.620> idea<00:03:50.860> that<00:03:50.980> you<00:03:51.040> managed<00:03:51.310> to<00:03:51.550> have

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:52.240 
great idea that you managed to have

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:53.760 
great idea that you managed to have
essentially<00:03:52.720> live<00:03:52.900> coverage<00:03:53.320> on<00:03:53.440> the<00:03:53.560> track

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:53.770 
essentially live coverage on the track

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:55.860 
essentially live coverage on the track
of<00:03:53.800> exactly<00:03:54.040> what's<00:03:54.760> going<00:03:54.970> on<00:03:55.150> just<00:03:55.750> like

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
of exactly what's going on just like

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.570 
of exactly what's going on just like
NASCAR<00:03:56.320> style<00:03:56.530> yeah<00:03:56.740> yeah<00:03:57.160> I<00:03:57.190> think<00:03:57.340> should<00:03:57.520> be

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:57.580 
NASCAR style yeah yeah I think should be

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.430 
NASCAR style yeah yeah I think should be
cool<00:03:57.730> I<00:03:57.940> guess<00:03:58.209> in<00:03:58.360> this<00:03:58.480> but<00:03:58.720> next<00:03:58.959> best<00:03:59.200> idea

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
cool I guess in this but next best idea

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:00.720 
cool I guess in this but next best idea
would<00:03:59.560> be<00:03:59.620> putting<00:03:59.890> a<00:04:00.010> little<00:04:00.160> cameras<00:04:00.520> on<00:04:00.640> the

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
would be putting a little cameras on the

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.040 
would be putting a little cameras on the
car<00:04:00.910> so<00:04:01.120> maybe<00:04:01.300> they<00:04:01.450> can<00:04:01.570> see<00:04:01.720> where<00:04:01.900> they're

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:02.050 
car so maybe they can see where they're

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:03.810 
car so maybe they can see where they're
going<00:04:02.080> is<00:04:02.350> our<00:04:02.500> driving<00:04:02.680> well<00:04:03.010> we<00:04:03.220> see<00:04:03.580> we<00:04:03.670> have

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:03.820 
going is our driving well we see we have

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:05.520 
going is our driving well we see we have
to<00:04:03.850> leave<00:04:04.120> a<00:04:04.180> few<00:04:04.510> things<00:04:04.720> for<00:04:05.080> the<00:04:05.200> next

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
to leave a few things for the next

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:06.900 
to leave a few things for the next
conference<00:04:05.920> that<00:04:06.010> we<00:04:06.130> do<00:04:06.280> right<00:04:06.490> so<00:04:06.790> this

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
conference that we do right so this

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.730 
conference that we do right so this
would<00:04:07.030> be<00:04:07.060> the<00:04:07.209> first<00:04:07.240> step<00:04:07.600> right<00:04:08.140> we<00:04:08.650> have

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:08.740 
would be the first step right we have

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:10.140 
would be the first step right we have
another<00:04:08.980> one<00:04:09.130> coming<00:04:09.430> in<00:04:09.490> the<00:04:09.580> fall<00:04:09.820> that<00:04:10.030> will

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
take this idea because everybody's

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:14.970 
take this idea because everybody's
really<00:04:13.180> excited<00:04:13.270> about<00:04:13.630> this<00:04:13.959> but<00:04:14.560> every<00:04:14.830> time

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
really excited about this but every time

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.949 
really excited about this but every time
we<00:04:15.040> try<00:04:15.490> and<00:04:15.550> do<00:04:15.670> some<00:04:15.910> other<00:04:16.180> kind<00:04:16.540> of<00:04:16.630> geeky

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
we try and do some other kind of geeky

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:18.720 
we try and do some other kind of geeky
experiment<00:04:17.560> with<00:04:17.680> it<00:04:17.709> so<00:04:18.400> putting<00:04:18.580> some

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:18.730 
experiment with it so putting some

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:20.520 
experiment with it so putting some
cameras<00:04:19.120> on<00:04:19.209> the<00:04:19.299> cars<00:04:19.540> obviously<00:04:20.260> we<00:04:20.410> can't

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
cameras on the cars obviously we can't

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:22.230 
cameras on the cars obviously we can't
do<00:04:20.590> something<00:04:20.799> like<00:04:20.890> that<00:04:21.220> maybe<00:04:21.790> a<00:04:21.940> heads-up
