really<00:01:23.189> really<00:01:23.220> hot<00:01:23.610> wax<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:24.180> I<00:01:24.240> was<00:01:24.360> doing

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
really really hot wax and I was doing

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
this with the kids so having this larger

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.060 
this with the kids so having this larger
needle<00:01:27.390> allowed<00:01:27.869> me<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.049> have<00:01:28.229> cooler<00:01:28.500> wax<00:01:28.829> so

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
needle allowed me to have cooler wax so

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.170 
needle allowed me to have cooler wax so
I<00:01:29.130> didn't<00:01:29.310> have<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.520> worry<00:01:29.729> about<00:01:29.880> them

just making a heart and look if it if it
goes<00:01:36.869> over<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.079> edge<00:01:37.259> while<00:01:37.590> it's<00:01:37.740> still<00:01:37.920> warm

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
goes over the edge while it's still warm

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.700 
goes over the edge while it's still warm
it's<00:01:38.310> easy<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.729> scrape<00:01:39.060> back<00:01:39.270> so<00:01:40.259> you<00:01:40.320> can<00:01:40.470> kind

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
it's easy to scrape back so you can kind

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.639 
it's easy to scrape back so you can kind
of<00:01:40.860> scrape<00:01:41.820> it<00:01:41.970> off<00:01:42.090> before<00:01:42.780> you<00:01:43.049> dye<00:01:43.380> it

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
of scrape it off before you dye it

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.649 
of scrape it off before you dye it
so<00:01:43.890> if<00:01:43.979> you<00:01:44.070> make<00:01:44.220> a<00:01:44.250> mistake<00:01:44.430> go<00:01:45.299> ahead<00:01:45.509> and<00:01:45.600> do

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
so if you make a mistake go ahead and do

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:46.999 
so if you make a mistake go ahead and do
that<00:01:45.689> while<00:01:46.079> it's<00:01:46.229> still<00:01:46.439> warm<00:01:46.619> it<00:01:46.740> comes<00:01:46.890> off

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
that while it's still warm it comes off

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.850 
that while it's still warm it comes off
really<00:01:47.490> easily<00:01:47.899> and<00:01:48.899> I'm<00:01:49.290> actually<00:01:49.409> trying<00:01:49.619> to

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
really easily and I'm actually trying to

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.130 
really easily and I'm actually trying to
recreate<00:01:50.220> one<00:01:50.579> that<00:01:50.729> I<00:01:50.759> made<00:01:51.090> earlier<00:01:51.509> but<00:01:52.110> I

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.130 
recreate one that I made earlier but I
had<00:01:52.560> dropped<00:01:52.979> it<00:01:53.189> and<00:01:53.579> so<00:01:54.299> it<00:01:54.420> cracked<00:01:54.720> and<00:01:55.079> I

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
had dropped it and so it cracked and I

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.270 
had dropped it and so it cracked and I
did<00:01:55.350> show<00:01:55.560> you<00:01:55.619> at<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.860> beginning<00:01:56.130> of<00:01:56.219> the

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
you're feeling I wasn't intending to do

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.410 
you're feeling I wasn't intending to do
a<00:02:05.740> video<00:02:05.980> today<00:02:06.340> well<00:02:06.670> I<00:02:06.700> did<00:02:06.910> one<00:02:07.060> already<00:02:07.300> but

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
a video today well I did one already but

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:08.700 
a video today well I did one already but
I<00:02:07.510> wasn't<00:02:07.750> intending<00:02:07.990> to<00:02:08.110> do<00:02:08.290> this<00:02:08.410> I<00:02:08.560> thought

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:08.710 
I wasn't intending to do this I thought

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:10.530 
I wasn't intending to do this I thought
this<00:02:08.830> is<00:02:08.979> kind<00:02:09.130> of<00:02:09.250> fun<00:02:09.460> and<00:02:09.760> it's<00:02:10.119> absolutely

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:10.540 
this is kind of fun and it's absolutely

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:13.070 
this is kind of fun and it's absolutely
not<00:02:10.660> the<00:02:10.780> proper<00:02:11.110> way<00:02:11.650> to<00:02:11.680> do<00:02:12.100> a<00:02:12.130> Ukrainian<00:02:12.790> a

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
not the proper way to do a Ukrainian a

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.080 
not the proper way to do a Ukrainian a
wax<00:02:14.080> resist<00:02:14.350> egg<00:02:15.040> thing<00:02:15.460> or<00:02:15.580> anything<00:02:15.790> but

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
wax resist egg thing or anything but

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.450 
wax resist egg thing or anything but
it's<00:02:16.330> fun<00:02:16.540> and<00:02:16.810> you<00:02:17.290> know<00:02:17.380> I<00:02:17.410> think<00:02:17.560> if<00:02:18.040> you<00:02:18.220> did

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
it's fun and you know I think if you did

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.190 
it's fun and you know I think if you did
this<00:02:18.670> you<00:02:19.000> can<00:02:19.540> maybe<00:02:19.690> use<00:02:19.870> like<00:02:19.990> a<00:02:20.020> little

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
this you can maybe use like a little

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.080 
this you can maybe use like a little
spoon<00:02:20.620> or<00:02:21.040> something<00:02:21.310> like<00:02:21.430> if<00:02:21.550> you<00:02:21.640> here's<00:02:21.970> a

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
spoon or something like if you here's a

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.820 
spoon or something like if you here's a
spoon<00:02:22.360> like<00:02:22.630> maybe<00:02:23.260> you<00:02:23.380> could<00:02:23.500> even<00:02:23.650> just

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
spoon like maybe you could even just

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.250 
spoon like maybe you could even just
like<00:02:24.180> get<00:02:25.180> a<00:02:25.210> spoon<00:02:25.540> and<00:02:25.720> you<00:02:25.810> can<00:02:25.930> make<00:02:26.080> some

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
like get a spoon and you can make some

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.380 
like get a spoon and you can make some
stripes<00:02:26.710> or<00:02:27.160> you<00:02:27.460> know<00:02:27.550> something<00:02:27.880> like<00:02:28.030> that

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
stripes or you know something like that

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:29.820 
stripes or you know something like that
so<00:02:28.720> if<00:02:28.780> you<00:02:28.840> don't<00:02:28.990> have<00:02:29.140> that<00:02:29.320> tool<00:02:29.560> you<00:02:29.590> can

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
so if you don't have that tool you can

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.670 
so if you don't have that tool you can
improvise<00:02:30.340> with<00:02:30.670> what<00:02:30.820> you<00:02:30.910> have<00:02:31.090> at<00:02:31.210> home<00:02:31.240> I

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.870 

hopefully<00:02:35.680> am<00:02:35.860> getting<00:02:36.160> the<00:02:36.280> wax<00:02:36.490> on<00:02:36.670> there

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
hopefully am getting the wax on there

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.820 
hopefully am getting the wax on there
hot<00:02:37.060> enough<00:02:37.330> just<00:02:38.020> make<00:02:38.140> sure<00:02:38.260> your<00:02:38.380> egg<00:02:38.680> is

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
hot enough just make sure your egg is

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.720 
hot enough just make sure your egg is
dry<00:02:39.070> if<00:02:39.310> your<00:02:39.460> age<00:02:39.610> has<00:02:39.910> um<00:02:41.070> has<00:02:42.070> any<00:02:42.250> water<00:02:42.550> on

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
dry if your age has um has any water on

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.460 
dry if your age has um has any water on
it<00:02:43.150> or<00:02:43.330> it's<00:02:43.510> just<00:02:43.780> fresh<00:02:43.900> out<00:02:44.080> of<00:02:44.110> the<00:02:44.230> fridge

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
it or it's just fresh out of the fridge

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:45.930 
it or it's just fresh out of the fridge
it's<00:02:44.770> gonna<00:02:44.860> have<00:02:45.010> that<00:02:45.100> condensation<00:02:45.400> on<00:02:45.790> it

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
it's gonna have that condensation on it

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.820 
it's gonna have that condensation on it
and<00:02:46.090> it's<00:02:46.210> not<00:02:46.360> going<00:02:46.720> to<00:02:46.930> hold<00:02:47.200> the<00:02:47.380> wax<00:02:47.560> it's

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
and it's not going to hold the wax it's

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.560 
and it's not going to hold the wax it's
gonna<00:02:47.920> it<00:02:48.370> seems<00:02:48.580> like<00:02:48.700> a<00:02:48.790> barrier<00:02:49.180> on<00:02:49.390> there

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
gonna it seems like a barrier on there

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:50.940 
gonna it seems like a barrier on there
and<00:02:49.630> then<00:02:49.750> the<00:02:49.840> door<00:02:49.930> diet<00:02:50.290> the<00:02:50.500> egg<00:02:50.620> will<00:02:50.770> put

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
and then the door diet the egg will put

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.130 
and then the door diet the egg will put
the<00:02:51.070> wax<00:02:51.280> will<00:02:51.460> pop<00:02:51.610> off<00:02:51.780> so<00:02:52.780> you<00:02:52.840> don't<00:02:53.020> want

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
the wax will pop off so you don't want

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.820 
the wax will pop off so you don't want
that<00:02:53.200> to<00:02:53.260> happen

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
that to happen

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.010 
that to happen
now<00:02:54.640> obviously<00:02:54.760> the<00:02:55.180> needle<00:02:55.420> is<00:02:55.540> better<00:02:55.690> for

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.020 
now obviously the needle is better for

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:57.060 
now obviously the needle is better for
this<00:02:56.110> but<00:02:56.290> I<00:02:56.350> just<00:02:56.470> wanted<00:02:56.680> to<00:02:56.740> show<00:02:56.920> you<00:02:56.980> that

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
this but I just wanted to show you that

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:02.430 
this but I just wanted to show you that
you<00:02:57.370> go<00:02:57.490> ahead<00:02:57.820> and<00:02:59.490> improvise<00:03:00.870> now<00:03:01.870> I've<00:03:02.140> got

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
you go ahead and improvise now I've got

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.890 
you go ahead and improvise now I've got
a<00:03:02.770> lot<00:03:03.310> of<00:03:03.340> animals<00:03:03.970> around<00:03:04.330> here's<00:03:04.690> we're

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
a lot of animals around here's we're

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.390 
a lot of animals around here's we're
doing<00:03:05.140> this<00:03:05.230> because<00:03:05.650> they<00:03:05.860> all<00:03:06.010> seem<00:03:06.280> to

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
doing this because they all seem to

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.370 
doing this because they all seem to
really<00:03:06.580> like<00:03:06.820> eggs<00:03:07.150> and<00:03:07.510> the<00:03:07.840> eggs<00:03:07.870> are<00:03:08.140> cooked

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
really like eggs and the eggs are cooked

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.870

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
color a little bit this is kind of an

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:44.430 
color a little bit this is kind of an
odd<00:03:42.640> little<00:03:42.820> package<00:03:43.269> of<00:03:43.870> colors<00:03:44.230> there's

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
odd little package of colors there's

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.040 
odd little package of colors there's
only<00:03:44.530> 25<00:03:44.950> cents<00:03:45.340> dia<00:03:45.640> but<00:03:45.970> egg<00:03:46.209> pellets<00:03:46.660> and<00:03:46.870> I

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:47.050 
only 25 cents dia but egg pellets and I

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:48.780 
only 25 cents dia but egg pellets and I
ended<00:03:47.260> up<00:03:47.290> with<00:03:47.440> two<00:03:47.470> blues<00:03:47.890> no<00:03:48.220> Purple's<00:03:48.610> and

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
ended up with two blues no Purple's and

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.130 
ended up with two blues no Purple's and
the<00:03:48.880> right<00:03:49.209> it's<00:03:49.330> kind<00:03:49.510> of<00:03:49.540> orange<00:03:49.690> II<00:03:49.959> so<00:03:50.110> I

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
the right it's kind of orange II so I

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:51.990 
the right it's kind of orange II so I
guess<00:03:50.320> you<00:03:50.470> get<00:03:50.590> what<00:03:50.739> you<00:03:50.830> pay<00:03:50.950> for<00:03:50.980> but<00:03:51.310> that

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
guess you get what you pay for but that

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.330 
guess you get what you pay for but that
gets<00:03:52.150> missed<00:03:52.810> eggs<00:03:53.110> they're<00:03:53.830> fun<00:03:54.130> they're

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:00.850 
that I was trying to replicate that I

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:02.130 
that I was trying to replicate that I
made<00:04:01.030> earlier<00:04:01.180> I<00:04:01.450> love<00:04:01.720> that<00:04:01.900> kind<00:04:02.080> of

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
made earlier I love that kind of

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.050 
made earlier I love that kind of
marbling<00:04:02.530> effect<00:04:02.739> there<00:04:03.580> and<00:04:03.730> I<00:04:03.760> do<00:04:03.820> have<00:04:04.000> a

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
marbling effect there and I do have a

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.990 
marbling effect there and I do have a
video<00:04:04.209> on<00:04:04.360> how<00:04:04.450> to<00:04:04.600> marbleize<00:04:05.230> Easter<00:04:06.190> eggs

using shaving cream on my channel I'll

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.170 
using shaving cream on my channel I'll
put<00:04:09.160> a<00:04:09.190> link<00:04:09.400> to<00:04:09.490> that<00:04:09.550> if<00:04:09.730> you<00:04:09.820> want<00:04:10.000> to<00:04:10.060> check

put a link to that if you want to check
that<00:04:10.240> out<00:04:10.570> I<00:04:10.780> only<00:04:10.900> had<00:04:11.170> brown<00:04:11.410> eggs<00:04:11.650> at<00:04:11.860> the

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 
that out I only had brown eggs at the

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.170 
that out I only had brown eggs at the
time<00:04:12.100> when<00:04:12.340> I<00:04:12.370> was<00:04:12.490> doing<00:04:12.520> that<00:04:12.730> because<00:04:13.090> our

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
time when I was doing that because our

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.780 
time when I was doing that because our
chickens<00:04:13.540> used<00:04:13.750> to<00:04:13.840> lay<00:04:13.990> brown<00:04:14.200> eggs<00:04:14.260> and<00:04:14.790> we

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
chickens used to lay brown eggs and we

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:17.250 
chickens used to lay brown eggs and we
don't<00:04:15.940> need<00:04:16.060> chickens<00:04:16.390> anymore<00:04:16.750> so<00:04:16.930> I<00:04:16.959> had<00:04:17.170> to

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
don't need chickens anymore so I had to

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:18.960 
don't need chickens anymore so I had to
actually<00:04:17.380> buy<00:04:17.680> eggs<00:04:17.920> this<00:04:18.070> year<00:04:18.130> but<00:04:18.760> it<00:04:18.880> is

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
actually buy eggs this year but it is

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.090 
actually buy eggs this year but it is
kind<00:04:19.150> of<00:04:19.209> nice<00:04:19.329> to<00:04:19.540> use<00:04:19.750> white<00:04:20.709> eggs

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.100 
kind of nice to use white eggs

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:22.890 
kind of nice to use white eggs
why<00:04:21.340> don't<00:04:21.489> I<00:04:21.609> design<00:04:22.390> another<00:04:22.570> one<00:04:22.750> while

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
why don't I design another one while

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.560 
why don't I design another one while
letting<00:04:23.170> that<00:04:23.260> sit<00:04:23.590> and<00:04:24.180> what<00:04:25.180> we<00:04:25.270> do<00:04:25.390> some

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
letting that sit and what we do some

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.450 
letting that sit and what we do some
stripes<00:04:26.020> cuz<00:04:26.260> strips<00:04:26.500> are<00:04:26.650> really<00:04:26.890> easy<00:04:27.070> to<00:04:27.310> do

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
stripes cuz strips are really easy to do

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.050 
stripes cuz strips are really easy to do
with<00:04:27.610> this<00:04:27.790> I'm<00:04:28.480> just<00:04:28.660> gonna<00:04:30.030> use<00:04:31.030> some

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 
with this I'm just gonna use some

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.000 
with this I'm just gonna use some
stripes<00:04:31.510> around<00:04:31.690> now<00:04:32.380> obviously<00:04:32.710> this<00:04:32.830> isn't

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
stripes around now obviously this isn't

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.520 
stripes around now obviously this isn't
like<00:04:33.250> some<00:04:33.400> great<00:04:33.900> technique<00:04:34.900> video<00:04:35.230> here

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
like some great technique video here

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.080 
like some great technique video here
some<00:04:35.680> are<00:04:35.740> just<00:04:35.860> kind<00:04:36.100> of<00:04:36.130> a<00:04:36.220> fun<00:04:36.430> inspiration

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
some are just kind of a fun inspiration

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:39.420 
some are just kind of a fun inspiration
then<00:04:37.810> you<00:04:37.900> can<00:04:38.050> try<00:04:38.230> your<00:04:38.410> own<00:04:38.560> thing<00:04:38.860> or<00:04:39.190> a

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
then you can try your own thing or a

that<00:05:21.640> first<00:05:21.880> one<00:05:22.090> I<00:05:22.240> think<00:05:22.330> you<00:05:22.540> might<00:05:22.660> be<00:05:22.690> able

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:22.900 
that first one I think you might be able

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:27.090 
that first one I think you might be able
to<00:05:23.520> remove<00:05:24.520> the<00:05:24.729> wax<00:05:25.470> now<00:05:26.470> I<00:05:26.500> mean<00:05:26.800> I<00:05:26.860> guess<00:05:26.979> if

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:27.100 
to remove the wax now I mean I guess if

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:28.230 
to remove the wax now I mean I guess if
your<00:05:27.220> box<00:05:27.370> is<00:05:27.520> really<00:05:27.729> thin<00:05:27.940> you<00:05:27.970> wouldn't

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 
your box is really thin you wouldn't

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.730 
your box is really thin you wouldn't
even<00:05:28.300> have<00:05:28.630> to<00:05:28.660> bother<00:05:28.870> removing<00:05:29.440> yet<00:05:29.590> but

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:29.740 
even have to bother removing yet but

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:31.200 
even have to bother removing yet but
this<00:05:29.890> is<00:05:29.950> new<00:05:30.340> this<00:05:30.550> is<00:05:30.610> kind<00:05:30.910> of<00:05:31.000> thick

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:31.210 
this is new this is kind of thick

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:33.030 
this is new this is kind of thick
because<00:05:31.479> I<00:05:31.570> the<00:05:31.870> wax<00:05:32.080> is<00:05:32.260> cooler<00:05:32.500> so<00:05:32.770> the<00:05:32.860> wax

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:33.040 
because I the wax is cooler so the wax

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:35.850 
because I the wax is cooler so the wax
is<00:05:33.160> gonna<00:05:33.310> go<00:05:33.400> on<00:05:33.430> thicker<00:05:34.380> when<00:05:35.380> it's<00:05:35.590> time<00:05:35.740> to

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:35.860 
is gonna go on thicker when it's time to

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.469 
is gonna go on thicker when it's time to
remove<00:05:36.160> it<00:05:36.340> I<00:05:36.550> probably<00:05:36.850> let<00:05:37.060> that<00:05:37.180> sit<00:05:37.450> a
