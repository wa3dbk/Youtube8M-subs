00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
to get a level of realism in there so we

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.330 
to get a level of realism in there so we
look<00:01:16.560> at<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:17.570> the<00:01:18.570> bullet<00:01:18.750> ballistics<00:01:19.340> so

look at the the bullet ballistics so
we've<00:01:20.520> got<00:01:20.729> things<00:01:21.060> like<00:01:21.299> bullet<00:01:21.689> drop<00:01:21.900> we've

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
we've got things like bullet drop we've

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.770 
we've got things like bullet drop we've
got<00:01:22.380> windage<00:01:22.770> to<00:01:22.979> calculate<00:01:23.509> its<00:01:24.509> all<00:01:24.659> these

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
got windage to calculate its all these

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.260 
got windage to calculate its all these
things<00:01:24.960> need<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.170> be<00:01:25.290> taken<00:01:25.650> into<00:01:25.770> account<00:01:26.270> to

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
things need to be taken into account to

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:38.090 
things need to be taken into account to
get<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.380> best<00:01:28.500> place<00:01:28.740> shop

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.060

and then you're asked in the game to put

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
a bullet through the head so we kind of

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.400 
a bullet through the head so we kind of

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
thought wouldn't it be great if we could

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:20.930 
thought wouldn't it be great if we could
sort<00:02:19.560> of<00:02:19.650> buried<00:02:19.890> down<00:02:20.100> into<00:02:20.519> that<00:02:20.610> what<00:02:20.790> would

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
sort of buried down into that what would

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.759 
sort of buried down into that what would

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
not to dumb it down and it's certainly

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.460 
not to dumb it down and it's certainly
not<00:03:54.220> dumbed<00:03:54.520> down<00:03:54.610> but<00:03:55.030> we<00:03:55.180> we<00:03:55.900> have<00:03:56.140> made<00:03:56.350> it

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.640 

so<00:04:09.510> I<00:04:09.540> think<00:04:09.810> when<00:04:09.930> we<00:04:10.050> when<00:04:10.260> we<00:04:10.290> were<00:04:10.440> first

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
so I think when we when we were first

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.120 
so I think when we when we were first
tasked<00:04:11.520> with<00:04:11.730> making<00:04:12.120> sniper<00:04:12.510> elite<00:04:12.630> v2<00:04:12.780> we<00:04:13.260> we

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
tasked with making sniper elite v2 we we

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.550 
tasked with making sniper elite v2 we we
had<00:04:14.250> the<00:04:14.310> opportunity<00:04:14.880> to<00:04:14.910> look<00:04:15.600> at<00:04:15.780> all<00:04:16.170> types

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
had the opportunity to look at all types

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.550 
had the opportunity to look at all types
of<00:04:16.650> conflicts<00:04:17.160> all<00:04:17.550> all<00:04:17.790> the<00:04:17.940> wars<00:04:18.180> that<00:04:18.630> the

you've got the shift of power from this
Nazi<00:04:38.040> regime<00:04:38.460> that<00:04:39.060> then<00:04:39.270> gets<00:04:39.450> quashed<00:04:39.870> in

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.200 
Nazi regime that then gets quashed in

the<00:04:40.620> Battle<00:04:40.860> of<00:04:40.920> Berlin<00:04:41.280> that<00:04:41.490> we're<00:04:41.610> now

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820 
the Battle of Berlin that we're now

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.930 
the Battle of Berlin that we're now
placed<00:04:42.480> in<00:04:42.690> as<00:04:42.780> the<00:04:43.170> only<00:04:43.440> Ally<00:04:43.710> so<00:04:44.670> the<00:04:44.820> only

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
placed in as the only Ally so the only

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:46.850 
placed in as the only Ally so the only
Allied<00:04:45.180> sniper<00:04:45.480> we're<00:04:46.230> placed<00:04:46.470> in<00:04:46.710> that

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
Allied sniper we're placed in that

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.770 
Allied sniper we're placed in that
environment<00:04:47.280> whilst<00:04:48.090> the<00:04:48.270> Russians<00:04:48.660> are

washing<00:04:49.260> the<00:04:49.470> Nazis<00:04:50.130> so<00:04:50.370> we're<00:04:50.520> trying<00:04:50.580> to

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:50.730 
washing the Nazis so we're trying to

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:52.970 
washing the Nazis so we're trying to
weave<00:04:50.880> our<00:04:51.030> way<00:04:51.060> through<00:04:51.420> this<00:04:51.710> and<00:04:52.710> we<00:04:52.860> can

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:52.980 
weave our way through this and we can

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:53.930 
weave our way through this and we can
decide<00:04:53.190> whether<00:04:53.400> we<00:04:53.490> want<00:04:53.580> to<00:04:53.700> shoot<00:04:53.820> the

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
decide whether we want to shoot the

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.210 
decide whether we want to shoot the
Germans<00:04:54.270> but<00:04:54.330> should<00:04:54.780> the<00:04:55.350> Russians<00:04:55.950> as<00:04:56.100> we

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
Germans but should the Russians as we

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.460 
Germans but should the Russians as we
work<00:04:56.430> our<00:04:56.580> way<00:04:56.610> through<00:04:56.900> to<00:04:57.900> tackle<00:04:58.170> each<00:04:58.230> of

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
work our way through to tackle each of

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.760 
work our way through to tackle each of
the<00:04:59.010> missions<00:04:59.280> but<00:04:59.460> we<00:05:00.180> kept<00:05:00.360> coming<00:05:00.600> back<00:05:00.630> to

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:00.770 
the missions but we kept coming back to

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:05.870 
the missions but we kept coming back to
it's<00:05:01.770> by<00:05:02.040> far<00:05:02.340> the<00:05:03.270> most<00:05:03.690> intriguing<00:05:04.820> sort<00:05:05.820> of

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 
it's by far the most intriguing sort of

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.160 
it's by far the most intriguing sort of
two<00:05:06.030> week<00:05:06.150> period<00:05:06.330> that<00:05:06.600> we<00:05:06.690> could<00:05:06.840> find<00:05:07.050> it

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:07.170 
two week period that we could find it

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:10.430 
two week period that we could find it
any<00:05:07.290> conflict<00:05:07.740> and<00:05:07.920> it's<00:05:08.340> it's<00:05:08.850> only<00:05:09.440> that

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 
any conflict and it's it's only that

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.530 
any conflict and it's it's only that
interest<00:05:10.740> is<00:05:10.830> only<00:05:10.950> exaggerated<00:05:11.610> by<00:05:11.910> the<00:05:11.970> the

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:12.540 
interest is only exaggerated by the the

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:13.760 
interest is only exaggerated by the the
brain<00:05:12.780> race<00:05:12.990> that<00:05:13.200> was<00:05:13.350> going<00:05:13.560> on<00:05:13.620> at<00:05:13.740> that

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770 
brain race that was going on at that

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:17.060 
brain race that was going on at that
time<00:05:13.860> with<00:05:14.160> the<00:05:14.250> Russians<00:05:14.580> in<00:05:14.790> that<00:05:15.770> area<00:05:16.770> not

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:17.070 
time with the Russians in that area not
