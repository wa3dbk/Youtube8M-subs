opened<00:00:15.129> this<00:00:15.340> box<00:00:15.580> yet<00:00:15.760> I<00:00:15.820> just<00:00:16.150> got<00:00:16.330> this

00:00:52.849 --> 00:00:52.859 

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:59.899 

there<00:00:53.859> are<00:00:54.159> your<00:00:54.399> speakers<00:00:56.309> it's<00:00:57.309> a<00:00:57.339> good<00:00:57.489> size

00:00:59.899 --> 00:00:59.909 

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:02.369 

here's<00:01:00.909> a<00:01:00.999> quick<00:01:01.300> look<00:01:01.449> of<00:01:01.600> all<00:01:01.899> the<00:01:02.079> hardware

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:02.379 
here's a quick look of all the hardware

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:03.689 
here's a quick look of all the hardware
that<00:01:02.469> comes<00:01:02.589> with<00:01:02.739> you<00:01:03.010> have<00:01:03.100> two<00:01:03.399> speakers

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:03.699 
that comes with you have two speakers

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:07.110 
that comes with you have two speakers
they're<00:01:04.300> both<00:01:04.510> hardwired<00:01:05.500> together<00:01:06.120> the

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:07.120 
they're both hardwired together the

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.140 
they're both hardwired together the
right<00:01:07.330> side<00:01:07.630> is<00:01:07.900> the<00:01:08.440> one<00:01:09.040> with<00:01:09.220> the<00:01:09.909> power

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.150 
right side is the one with the power

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.649 
right side is the one with the power
button<00:01:10.420> and<00:01:10.540> the<00:01:10.780> volume<00:01:11.100> change<00:01:12.100> for<00:01:13.060> the<00:01:13.180> AC

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:13.659 
button and the volume change for the AC

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:22.980 
button and the volume change for the AC
adapter<00:01:14.259> and<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:20.020> AC<00:01:20.200> adapter<00:01:20.920> to<00:01:20.950> the<00:01:21.990> actual

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
adapter and the AC adapter to the actual

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.080 
adapter and the AC adapter to the actual
speaker<00:01:23.320> the<00:01:23.500> cords<00:01:23.829> about<00:01:24.039> five<00:01:24.460> feet<00:01:24.759> I

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
speaker the cords about five feet I

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.490 
speaker the cords about five feet I
thought<00:01:25.990> it<00:01:26.110> was<00:01:26.200> a<00:01:26.229> little<00:01:26.500> bit<00:01:26.799> short<00:01:27.130> and

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
thought it was a little bit short and

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.620 
thought it was a little bit short and
the<00:01:29.500> the<00:01:29.950> audio<00:01:30.189> cord<00:01:30.520> is<00:01:30.729> about<00:01:31.030> the<00:01:31.360> same

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
the the audio cord is about the same

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.469 
the the audio cord is about the same
length<00:01:31.930> so<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:35.020> back<00:01:35.229> it's<00:01:35.740> a<00:01:35.799> pretty<00:01:35.979> simple

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
length so the back it's a pretty simple

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.529 
length so the back it's a pretty simple
just<00:01:37.479> plug<00:01:37.840> it<00:01:37.960> in<00:01:38.729> there's<00:01:39.729> one<00:01:39.939> for<00:01:40.149> input

00:01:40.529 --> 00:01:40.539 
just plug it in there's one for input

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:46.410 
just plug it in there's one for input
and<00:01:41.399> one<00:01:42.399> for<00:01:42.549> auxiliary<00:01:42.640> so<00:01:45.000> we'll<00:01:46.000> just<00:01:46.149> test

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
and one for auxiliary so we'll just test

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.700 
and one for auxiliary so we'll just test
it<00:01:46.600> the<00:01:47.079> sound<00:01:47.380> width<00:01:47.649> and<00:01:47.920> then<00:01:48.100> without<00:01:48.340> the

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
it the sound width and then without the

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.120 
it the sound width and then without the
Altec<00:01:50.710> Lansing<00:01:50.740> speakers<00:01:51.210> oh<00:01:52.770> and<00:01:53.770> a<00:01:53.890> quick

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
Altec Lansing speakers oh and a quick

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:55.849 
Altec Lansing speakers oh and a quick
thing<00:01:54.340> is<00:01:54.490> that<00:01:54.640> on<00:01:54.909> the<00:01:55.030> bottom<00:01:55.329> they<00:01:55.450> have<00:01:55.659> a

00:01:55.849 --> 00:01:55.859 
thing is that on the bottom they have a

00:01:55.859 --> 00:02:00.389 
thing is that on the bottom they have a
subwoofers<00:01:58.020> so<00:01:59.020> they're<00:01:59.469> down<00:01:59.710> firing<00:02:00.009> so

00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:00.399 
subwoofers so they're down firing so

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:11.750 
subwoofers so they're down firing so
let's<00:02:00.609> see<00:02:00.700> how<00:02:00.789> it<00:02:00.880> works

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:20.280 

this<00:02:12.760> is<00:02:12.910> without<00:02:13.030> the<00:02:13.330> speakers<00:02:19.140> now<00:02:20.140> we'll

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
this is without the speakers now we'll

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:27.240 
this is without the speakers now we'll
plug<00:02:20.560> it<00:02:20.740> in<00:02:23.520> so<00:02:24.520> you<00:02:24.550> can<00:02:24.820> compare<00:02:25.980> they<00:02:26.980> sound

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
plug it in so you can compare they sound

00:02:27.250 --> 00:03:01.559 
plug it in so you can compare they sound
like

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:03.940 

here's<00:03:02.569> another<00:03:03.140> song<00:03:03.409> this<00:03:03.680> time<00:03:03.739> I'm

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
here's another song this time I'm

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.350 
here's another song this time I'm
starting<00:03:04.340> with<00:03:04.489> the<00:03:04.670> speakers<00:03:05.060> and<00:03:05.239> then

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
starting with the speakers and then

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:41.759 
starting with the speakers and then
going<00:03:05.599> to<00:03:05.629> without<00:03:40.000> they're<00:03:41.000> pretty<00:03:41.209> strong

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:41.769 
going to without they're pretty strong

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:44.410 
going to without they're pretty strong
in<00:03:42.769> comparison<00:03:43.400> to<00:03:43.430> what<00:03:43.909> I<00:03:43.939> used<00:03:44.000> to<00:03:44.269> have

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
in comparison to what I used to have

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.869 
in comparison to what I used to have
which<00:03:44.629> is<00:03:44.750> the<00:03:44.870> Logitech<00:03:45.319> Z<00:03:46.280> 2300<00:03:47.209> I<00:03:47.470> would<00:03:48.470> say

00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:48.879 
which is the Logitech Z 2300 I would say

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:51.550 
which is the Logitech Z 2300 I would say
it's<00:03:49.879> a<00:03:49.939> little<00:03:50.090> less<00:03:50.450> bass<00:03:50.780> obviously

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
it's a little less bass obviously

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.500 
it's a little less bass obviously
because<00:03:51.709> this<00:03:51.769> is<00:03:51.889> not<00:03:52.040> a<00:03:52.069> 2.1<00:03:52.730> system<00:03:53.359> it's<00:03:53.480> a

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
because this is not a 2.1 system it's a

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:56.410 
because this is not a 2.1 system it's a
2.0<00:03:54.139> or<00:03:54.739> as<00:03:55.040> they<00:03:55.370> call<00:03:55.549> it<00:03:55.579> a<00:03:55.700> 2.2<00:03:56.209> on<00:03:56.329> the

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
2.0 or as they call it a 2.2 on the

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:57.940 
2.0 or as they call it a 2.2 on the
website<00:03:56.720> because<00:03:56.870> you<00:03:56.959> have<00:03:57.079> two<00:03:57.230> miniature

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
website because you have two miniature

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.160 
website because you have two miniature
subwoofers<00:03:58.280> on<00:03:58.519> each<00:03:58.609> one<00:03:58.810> the<00:03:59.810> sound<00:03:59.989> is

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
subwoofers on each one the sound is

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.349 
subwoofers on each one the sound is
really<00:04:00.260> clean<00:04:00.590> and<00:04:00.620> crisp<00:04:00.919> and<00:04:01.190> I<00:04:01.819> just<00:04:02.180> played

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:02.359 
really clean and crisp and I just played

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:04.780 
really clean and crisp and I just played
a<00:04:02.419> really<00:04:02.569> bass<00:04:02.810> heavy<00:04:03.049> song<00:04:03.319> so<00:04:03.709> I<00:04:04.280> could

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
a really bass heavy song so I could

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:06.309 
a really bass heavy song so I could
definitely<00:04:04.879> feel<00:04:05.389> the<00:04:05.510> bass<00:04:05.660> the<00:04:05.870> table<00:04:06.169> is

00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:06.319 
definitely feel the bass the table is

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:09.699 
definitely feel the bass the table is
shaking<00:04:06.709> so<00:04:07.329> these<00:04:08.329> would<00:04:08.480> probably<00:04:08.510> not<00:04:09.319> Rock

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:09.709 
shaking so these would probably not Rock

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:12.099 
shaking so these would probably not Rock
a<00:04:09.980> party<00:04:10.430> with<00:04:10.579> maybe<00:04:11.030> twenty<00:04:11.810> or<00:04:11.840> thirty

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:12.109 
a party with maybe twenty or thirty

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:14.379 
a party with maybe twenty or thirty
people<00:04:12.549> that's<00:04:13.549> something<00:04:13.730> that<00:04:13.879> my<00:04:14.239> old

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:14.389 
people that's something that my old

00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:16.509 
people that's something that my old
speakers<00:04:14.690> could<00:04:14.840> but<00:04:15.680> I<00:04:15.949> think<00:04:16.280> these<00:04:16.370> would

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:16.519 
speakers could but I think these would

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:19.240 
speakers could but I think these would
be<00:04:16.669> perfect<00:04:17.299> for<00:04:17.359> filling<00:04:18.019> up<00:04:18.109> a<00:04:18.229> room<00:04:18.470> if<00:04:19.130> you

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
be perfect for filling up a room if you

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:20.800 
be perfect for filling up a room if you
had<00:04:19.340> ten<00:04:19.549> people<00:04:19.699> just<00:04:20.000> hanging<00:04:20.449> out

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
had ten people just hanging out

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.300 
had ten people just hanging out
I<00:04:20.840> think<00:04:21.440> this<00:04:21.530> would<00:04:21.650> definitely<00:04:21.769> go<00:04:22.099> over

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
I think this would definitely go over

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:26.289 
I think this would definitely go over
all<00:04:22.430> that<00:04:22.550> and<00:04:22.789> yeah<00:04:23.780> it<00:04:23.900> sounded<00:04:24.139> good
