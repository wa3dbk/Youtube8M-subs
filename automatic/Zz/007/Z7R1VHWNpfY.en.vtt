drop<00:03:36.280> down<00:03:36.310> and<00:03:38.459> then<00:03:39.510> this<00:03:40.709> so<00:03:41.709> in<00:03:41.920> the<00:03:41.980> rule

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
drop down and then this so in the rule

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:47.100 
drop down and then this so in the rule
of<00:03:42.190> thirds<00:03:43.049> third<00:03:44.049> third<00:03:44.709> third<00:03:45.040> is<00:03:46.110> the

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.520 
of thirds third third third is the
average<00:03:47.290> and<00:03:47.860> then<00:03:48.400> there's<00:03:48.640> the<00:03:48.790> particular

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
average and then there's the particular

00:06:16.099 --> 00:06:19.540 
always weld the shape of your models
plan<00:06:16.819> change<00:06:17.119> a<00:06:17.239> plane<00:06:17.679> to<00:06:18.679> their<00:06:18.830> torso<00:06:19.339> and

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:19.550 
plan change a plane to their torso and

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:21.489 
plan change a plane to their torso and
the<00:06:20.209> reason<00:06:20.599> I<00:06:20.689> want<00:06:20.899> you<00:06:21.019> guys<00:06:21.169> to<00:06:21.379> think

00:06:21.489 --> 00:06:21.499 
the reason I want you guys to think

00:06:21.499 --> 00:06:24.119 
the reason I want you guys to think
about<00:06:21.769> the<00:06:21.919> orientation<00:06:22.610> of<00:06:22.729> your<00:06:22.879> marks<00:06:23.179> is

00:06:24.119 --> 00:06:24.129 
about the orientation of your marks is

00:06:24.129 --> 00:06:28.540 
about the orientation of your marks is
then<00:06:25.129> you<00:06:25.309> can<00:06:25.519> live<00:06:25.909> literally<00:06:26.779> paint<00:06:27.550> away

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:28.550 
then you can live literally paint away

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:31.629 
then you can live literally paint away
from<00:06:28.999> the<00:06:29.149> edge<00:06:29.529> very<00:06:30.529> effectively<00:06:31.249> and

00:06:31.629 --> 00:06:31.639 
from the edge very effectively and

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:37.209 
from the edge very effectively and
efficiently<00:06:31.849> and<00:06:32.539> quickly<00:06:32.809> to<00:06:36.039> get<00:06:37.039> your

00:06:37.209 --> 00:06:37.219 
efficiently and quickly to get your

00:06:37.219 --> 00:06:42.759 
efficiently and quickly to get your
models<00:06:37.519> head<00:06:37.789> to<00:06:38.539> read<00:06:41.469> rather<00:06:42.469> than

00:06:42.759 --> 00:06:42.769 
models head to read rather than

00:06:42.769 --> 00:06:45.179 
models head to read rather than
outlining<00:06:43.219> it<00:06:43.459> and<00:06:43.639> filling<00:06:43.909> it<00:06:43.999> in<00:06:44.079> so

00:06:45.179 --> 00:06:45.189 
outlining it and filling it in so

00:06:45.189 --> 00:06:47.709 
outlining it and filling it in so
anywhere<00:06:46.189> where<00:06:46.399> you<00:06:46.519> stop<00:06:46.849> on<00:06:47.089> that<00:06:47.119> process

00:06:47.709 --> 00:06:47.719 
anywhere where you stop on that process

00:06:47.719 --> 00:06:49.209 
anywhere where you stop on that process
as<00:06:47.899> long<00:06:48.079> as<00:06:48.229> you<00:06:48.319> have<00:06:48.469> those<00:06:48.619> tilts<00:06:49.099> and

00:06:49.209 --> 00:06:49.219 
as long as you have those tilts and

00:06:49.219 --> 00:06:50.949 
as long as you have those tilts and
those<00:06:49.429> bones<00:06:49.729> and<00:06:50.119> you<00:06:50.360> have<00:06:50.509> that<00:06:50.659> thickness

00:06:50.949 --> 00:06:50.959 
those bones and you have that thickness

00:06:50.959 --> 00:06:53.049 
those bones and you have that thickness
of<00:06:51.199> that<00:06:51.379> neck<00:06:51.649> then<00:06:52.279> it<00:06:52.429> becomes<00:06:52.669> very<00:06:52.939> easy

00:06:53.049 --> 00:06:53.059 
of that neck then it becomes very easy

00:06:53.059 --> 00:06:58.239 
of that neck then it becomes very easy
to<00:06:53.479> get<00:06:54.789> your<00:06:55.789> models<00:06:56.149> body<00:06:56.709> to<00:06:57.709> fall<00:06:57.979> away

00:06:58.239 --> 00:06:58.249 
to get your models body to fall away

00:06:58.249 --> 00:07:00.339 
to get your models body to fall away
from<00:06:58.669> that<00:06:58.819> over<00:06:59.509> to<00:06:59.599> your<00:06:59.719> model<00:06:59.869> shoulders

00:07:00.339 --> 00:07:00.349 
from that over to your model shoulders

00:07:00.349 --> 00:07:02.379 
from that over to your model shoulders
and<00:07:00.499> you<00:07:00.559> have<00:07:00.739> so<00:07:01.069> many<00:07:01.219> better<00:07:01.550> act<00:07:01.909> more

00:07:02.379 --> 00:07:02.389 
and you have so many better act more

00:07:02.389 --> 00:07:06.129 
and you have so many better act more
milk<00:07:04.089> let<00:07:05.089> me<00:07:05.149> stop<00:07:05.300> it<00:07:05.419> again<00:07:05.599> and<00:07:05.839> you<00:07:05.990> have

00:07:06.129 --> 00:07:06.139 
milk let me stop it again and you have

00:07:06.139 --> 00:07:09.579 
milk let me stop it again and you have
so<00:07:06.439> many<00:07:06.919> clearer<00:07:07.990> measuring<00:07:08.990> points<00:07:09.439> to

00:07:09.579 --> 00:07:09.589 
so many clearer measuring points to

00:07:09.589 --> 00:07:14.459 
so many clearer measuring points to
assess<00:07:09.979> where<00:07:10.249> the<00:07:10.339> rest<00:07:10.550> of<00:07:10.699> the<00:07:10.759> body<00:07:10.969> is

00:07:14.459 --> 00:07:14.469 

00:07:14.469 --> 00:07:17.199 

compared<00:07:15.469> to<00:07:15.529> that<00:07:15.740> when<00:07:16.669> I<00:07:16.699> don't<00:07:16.939> have<00:07:17.119> the

00:07:17.199 --> 00:07:17.209 
compared to that when I don't have the

00:07:17.209 --> 00:07:18.909 
compared to that when I don't have the
model<00:07:17.539> in<00:07:17.629> front<00:07:17.869> of<00:07:17.929> me<00:07:18.019> I<00:07:18.169> use<00:07:18.529> something

00:07:18.909 --> 00:07:18.919 
model in front of me I use something

00:07:18.919 --> 00:07:20.919 
model in front of me I use something
like<00:07:18.949> this<00:07:19.279> to<00:07:19.490> start<00:07:19.550> things<00:07:19.999> with<00:07:20.240> because<00:07:20.899> I

00:07:20.919 --> 00:07:20.929 
like this to start things with because I

00:07:20.929 --> 00:07:23.230 
like this to start things with because I
don't<00:07:21.319> have<00:07:21.469> a<00:07:21.499> model<00:07:21.889> to<00:07:22.009> steal<00:07:22.249> from<00:07:22.519> this<00:07:23.059> is

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:23.240 
don't have a model to steal from this is

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:27.719 
don't have a model to steal from this is
an<00:07:23.360> idealized<00:07:24.339> template<00:07:25.869> this<00:07:26.869> is<00:07:27.079> an<00:07:27.259> act<00:07:27.439> of

00:07:27.719 --> 00:07:27.729 
an idealized template this is an act of

00:07:27.729 --> 00:07:31.389 
an idealized template this is an act of
artists<00:07:28.729> thievery<00:07:29.599> I<00:07:30.069> encourage<00:07:31.069> you<00:07:31.099> to<00:07:31.219> be
