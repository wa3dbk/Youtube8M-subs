first<00:01:12.930> of<00:01:13.020> all<00:01:13.140> there's<00:01:13.619> potential<00:01:14.250> for<00:01:14.280> lead

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
first of all there's potential for lead

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.179 
first of all there's potential for lead
contamination<00:01:15.680> tiny<00:01:16.680> shards<00:01:17.040> of<00:01:17.130> glass

getting<00:01:17.729> in<00:01:17.909> with<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.180> chlorella<00:01:18.560> there's<00:01:19.560> a

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
getting in with the chlorella there's a

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.429 
getting in with the chlorella there's a
little<00:01:19.830> bit<00:01:19.920> of<00:01:20.009> that<00:01:20.100> danger<00:01:21.049> you<00:01:22.049> know<00:01:22.170> but

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
little bit of that danger you know but

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.109 
little bit of that danger you know but
the<00:01:22.590> main<00:01:22.920> problem<00:01:23.400> with<00:01:23.430> it<00:01:23.729> is<00:01:23.880> that<00:01:23.909> you

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
the main problem with it is that you

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.090 
the main problem with it is that you
pulverize<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.320> chlorella<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:25.890> a<00:01:25.920> lot<00:01:26.070> of

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
pulverize the chlorella and a lot of

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.649 
pulverize the chlorella and a lot of
people<00:01:26.430> really<00:01:26.610> like<00:01:26.880> that<00:01:27.180> they<00:01:27.360> like<00:01:27.479> the

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
people really like that they like the

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.120 
people really like that they like the
idea<00:01:27.930> that<00:01:27.990> it's<00:01:28.200> been<00:01:28.320> pulverized<00:01:28.920> but

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
idea that it's been pulverized but

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.920 
idea that it's been pulverized but
that's<00:01:29.310> not<00:01:29.490> a<00:01:29.520> good<00:01:29.759> thing<00:01:29.939> because<00:01:30.090> you<00:01:30.810> have

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
that's not a good thing because you have

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.600 
that's not a good thing because you have
destroyed<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.619> cell's<00:01:31.860> membrane<00:01:32.369> the

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
destroyed the cell's membrane the

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.520 
destroyed the cell's membrane the

nutrients that should stay intact you

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.760 
nutrients that should stay intact you
know<00:01:39.360> when<00:01:39.540> you<00:01:39.630> digest<00:01:39.840> them<00:01:40.290> so<00:01:40.439> they<00:01:40.530> go<00:01:40.650> on

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
know when you digest them so they go on

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.710 
know when you digest them so they go on
with<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:41.040> body<00:01:41.220> all<00:01:41.460> together<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:42.210> you've

with the body all together and you've

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.310 
with the body all together and you've
also<00:01:43.369> you<00:01:44.369> know<00:01:44.490> opened<00:01:44.939> up<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.390> cell<00:01:45.990> to

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
also you know opened up the cell to

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.649 
also you know opened up the cell to
immediate<00:01:46.860> oxidation<00:01:47.579> that's<00:01:47.850> you<00:01:48.119> decrease

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
pressure release where the chlorella

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.810 
pressure release where the chlorella
moves<00:02:01.500> at<00:02:01.649> a<00:02:01.680> very<00:02:01.890> high<00:02:02.040> speed<00:02:02.430> and<00:02:02.610> then<00:02:02.700> it

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
moves at a very high speed and then it

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.510 
moves at a very high speed and then it
goes<00:02:02.969> through<00:02:03.000> a<00:02:03.270> chamber<00:02:04.020> that<00:02:04.829> is<00:02:05.009> very<00:02:05.280> high

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
goes through a chamber that is very high

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.219 
goes through a chamber that is very high
pressure<00:02:05.850> so<00:02:06.119> it<00:02:06.240> goes<00:02:06.360> from<00:02:06.540> low<00:02:06.719> pressure<00:02:06.750> to

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
pressure so it goes from low pressure to

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.380 
pressure so it goes from low pressure to
high<00:02:07.439> pressure<00:02:07.799> back<00:02:08.429> to<00:02:08.640> low<00:02:08.789> pressure<00:02:09.030> in

high pressure back to low pressure in

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.449 
high pressure back to low pressure in
just<00:02:09.569> a<00:02:09.660> millisecond<00:02:10.319> and<00:02:10.410> what<00:02:10.860> that<00:02:11.069> does<00:02:11.280> is

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
just a millisecond and what that does is

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.190 
just a millisecond and what that does is
it<00:02:11.580> rupture

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
it rupture
