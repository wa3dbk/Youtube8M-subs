Avengers comes into he does a

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:16.860 
Avengers comes into he does a
transdimensional<00:03:15.030> switch<00:03:16.030> I<00:03:16.450> guess<00:03:16.720> you'd

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870

call<00:03:16.959> them<00:03:17.230> ribbons<00:03:17.560> and<00:03:17.680> I<00:03:17.739> think<00:03:17.950> we

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
call them ribbons and I think we

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.050 
call them ribbons and I think we
