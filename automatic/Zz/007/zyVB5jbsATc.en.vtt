the pedals onto the crank and a 6mm okay

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.650 
the pedals onto the crank and a 6mm okay
you<00:00:23.039> could<00:00:23.130> also<00:00:23.310> use<00:00:23.550> an<00:00:23.670> 8<00:00:23.789> mil<00:00:24.029> and<00:00:24.330> key<00:00:24.449> for

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
you could also use an 8 mil and key for

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.640 
you could also use an 8 mil and key for
some<00:00:24.840> cuddles<00:00:25.019> as<00:00:25.260> well<00:00:25.970> so<00:00:27.349> you<00:00:28.349> get<00:00:28.470> your

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
some cuddles as well so you get your

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.490 
some cuddles as well so you get your
pedal<00:00:28.920> first<00:00:29.539> put<00:00:30.539> a<00:00:30.570> bit<00:00:30.750> of<00:00:30.779> put<00:00:31.349> a<00:00:31.380> little

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
pedal first put a bit of put a little

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.979 
pedal first put a bit of put a little
bit<00:00:31.769> of<00:00:31.859> grease<00:00:32.040> on<00:00:32.219> there<00:00:32.430> on<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.820> axle<00:00:33.149> so<00:00:33.600> it

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
bit of grease on there on the axle so it

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.270 
bit of grease on there on the axle so it
goes<00:00:34.230> it<00:00:34.590> installs<00:00:35.070> nicely<00:00:35.690> then<00:00:36.690> we<00:00:36.930> get<00:00:37.079> our

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
goes it installs nicely then we get our

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.869 
goes it installs nicely then we get our
50ml<00:00:38.280> spanner

00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:40.879 
50ml spanner

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:44.090 
50ml spanner
now<00:00:42.170> when<00:00:43.170> you<00:00:43.230> putting<00:00:43.500> it<00:00:43.620> in<00:00:43.739> you're

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
now when you putting it in you're

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.160 
now when you putting it in you're
turning<00:00:44.399> it<00:00:44.489> in<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:44.820> forward<00:00:45.090> motion<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.960> same

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
turning it in a forward motion the same

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.560 
turning it in a forward motion the same
way<00:00:46.320> you'd<00:00:46.500> pedal<00:00:46.890> a<00:00:50.239> little<00:00:51.239> bit<00:00:51.329> of<00:00:51.390> Silla

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
way you'd pedal a little bit of Silla

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.600 
way you'd pedal a little bit of Silla
cribs<00:00:53.000> then<00:00:54.000> you<00:00:54.120> get<00:00:54.270> your<00:00:54.420> spanner

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
cribs then you get your spanner

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.610 
cribs then you get your spanner
thing<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:56.879> then<00:00:57.059> you<00:00:57.210> put<00:00:57.780> your<00:00:57.930> turning<00:00:58.530> it

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
thing and then you put your turning it

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.619 
thing and then you put your turning it
in<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.800> same<00:00:59.070> way<00:00:59.309> that<00:00:59.910> your<00:01:00.090> pedaling<00:01:00.449> in<00:01:00.570> a

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
in the same way that your pedaling in a

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.990 
in the same way that your pedaling in a
forward<00:01:01.020> /<00:01:01.170> motion<00:01:01.590> and<00:01:02.309> that<00:01:02.340> will<00:01:02.579> like

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
forward / motion and that will like

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.899 
forward / motion and that will like
start<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:03.989> thread<00:01:04.229> it<00:01:04.379> in<00:01:04.519> gets<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:05.729> point

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
start to thread it in gets to a point

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:06.969 
start to thread it in gets to a point
there

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
there

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:10.100 
there
firm<00:01:07.979> then<00:01:08.460> you<00:01:08.610> just<00:01:09.150> give<00:01:09.270> it<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.420> nudge<00:01:09.630> you

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
firm then you just give it a nudge you

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.810 
firm then you just give it a nudge you
do<00:01:10.290> that<00:01:10.470> it's<00:01:11.100> not<00:01:11.280> going<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.490> come<00:01:11.670> off

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
do that it's not going to come off

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.219 
do that it's not going to come off
because<00:01:11.970> you<00:01:12.180> see<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.689> threads<00:01:12.960> going<00:01:13.110> the

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
because you see the threads going the

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.960 
because you see the threads going the
same<00:01:13.439> way<00:01:13.590> as<00:01:13.710> your<00:01:13.799> pedaling<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.340> that's<00:01:14.820> all

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
same way as your pedaling and that's all

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.190 
same way as your pedaling and that's all
you<00:01:15.119> need<00:01:15.299> to<00:01:15.420> do<00:01:15.540> is<00:01:15.659> just<00:01:15.810> give<00:01:15.990> it<00:01:16.049> a<00:01:16.080> little

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
you need to do is just give it a little

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.999 
you need to do is just give it a little
know<00:01:16.380> just<00:01:16.590> enough<00:01:17.840> so<00:01:18.840> then<00:01:19.530> we<00:01:19.619> go<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:19.799> the

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
know just enough so then we go to the

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.080 
know just enough so then we go to the
other<00:01:20.100> side<00:01:21.860> turn<00:01:22.860> around<00:01:23.159> again<00:01:23.250> so<00:01:23.939> this

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
other side turn around again so this

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.280 
other side turn around again so this
time<00:01:24.330> we're<00:01:24.509> going<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:24.659> try<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:24.930> do<00:01:25.080> it<00:01:25.170> with

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
time we're going to try and do it with

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.260 
time we're going to try and do it with
the<00:01:25.380> allen<00:01:25.680> key<00:01:25.860> so<00:01:26.610> you<00:01:26.670> sort<00:01:26.880> of<00:01:26.939> put<00:01:27.090> it<00:01:27.180> in

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
the allen key so you sort of put it in

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.730 
the allen key so you sort of put it in
there<00:01:27.390> you<00:01:27.479> put<00:01:27.659> it<00:01:27.810> you<00:01:27.990> put<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.350> allen<00:01:28.590> key

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
there you put it you put the allen key

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.440 
there you put it you put the allen key
through<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:29.369> once<00:01:29.820> when<00:01:30.000> we're<00:01:30.119> turning<00:01:30.240> it

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
through and once when we're turning it

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.600 
through and once when we're turning it
forward<00:01:30.900> and<00:01:31.439> then<00:01:31.740> see<00:01:31.920> it<00:01:32.009> goes<00:01:32.159> on<00:01:32.310> straight

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
forward and then see it goes on straight

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:39.740 
forward and then see it goes on straight
away<00:01:36.350> he<00:01:37.350> gets<00:01:37.470> firm<00:01:37.829> once<00:01:38.640> it's<00:01:38.820> in<00:01:39.090> you<00:01:39.630> just

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
away he gets firm once it's in you just

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.240 
away he gets firm once it's in you just
give<00:01:39.930> it<00:01:39.960> a<00:01:40.200> little<00:01:40.770> nudge<00:01:41.210> that's<00:01:42.210> enough<00:01:43.250> now

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
give it a little nudge that's enough now

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.480 
give it a little nudge that's enough now
to<00:01:44.880> get<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.180> bike<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:45.720> get<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:45.990> pills<00:01:46.200> off

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
to get the bike to get the pills off

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.630 
to get the bike to get the pills off
take<00:01:47.490> out<00:01:47.670> this<00:01:47.880> as<00:01:48.540> a<00:01:48.600> stand<00:01:49.070> is<00:01:50.070> just<00:01:50.130> to<00:01:50.520> do

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
take out this as a stand is just to do

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.230 
take out this as a stand is just to do
it<00:01:50.729> on<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:50.909> floor<00:01:51.180> so<00:01:52.610> we'll<00:01:53.610> do<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:53.850> allen

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
it on the floor so we'll do the allen

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.850 
it on the floor so we'll do the allen
key<00:01:54.390> first<00:01:54.659> so<00:01:55.049> you<00:01:55.110> have<00:01:55.290> your<00:01:55.380> pedal<00:01:55.710> you

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
key first so you have your pedal you

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.639 
key first so you have your pedal you
crank<00:01:56.340> it<00:01:56.430> a<00:01:56.520> forward<00:01:56.909> position<00:01:57.350> so<00:01:58.350> you<00:01:58.409> get

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
crank it a forward position so you get

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:59.899
