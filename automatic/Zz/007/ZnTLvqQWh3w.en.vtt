00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.900 

on<00:02:08.440> top<00:02:08.650> of<00:02:08.680> what<00:02:08.830> we<00:02:08.890> already<00:02:09.040> do<00:02:09.640> for

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
ourselves peas and carrots this is

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.010 
ourselves peas and carrots this is
another<00:02:12.820> thing<00:02:13.150> than<00:02:13.390> just<00:02:13.630> things<00:02:14.620> up<00:02:16.020> okay

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
another thing than just things up okay

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.410 
another thing than just things up okay
so<00:02:17.080> at<00:02:17.920> this<00:02:18.160> point<00:02:18.430> in<00:02:18.580> creating<00:02:19.090> like<00:02:19.240> you've

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
so at this point in creating like you've

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.750 
so at this point in creating like you've
had<00:02:19.540> a<00:02:19.600> lot<00:02:19.780> of<00:02:19.840> indie<00:02:20.260> success<00:02:20.740> at<00:02:21.340> this<00:02:21.520> point

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
had a lot of indie success at this point

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.150 
had a lot of indie success at this point
would<00:02:21.880> it<00:02:22.030> be<00:02:22.560> appealing<00:02:23.560> to<00:02:23.590> go<00:02:23.770> to<00:02:23.830> a<00:02:23.920> major

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
would it be appealing to go to a major

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.640 
would it be appealing to go to a major
label<00:02:24.280> for<00:02:24.700> you<00:02:24.790> or<00:02:25.000> I<00:02:25.630> think<00:02:26.080> me<00:02:26.260> as<00:02:26.380> a<00:02:26.410> young

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
label for you or I think me as a young

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.760 
label for you or I think me as a young
artist<00:02:26.950> and<00:02:27.460> just<00:02:27.730> risk<00:02:28.510> taker<00:02:28.810> I<00:02:29.200> think<00:02:29.590> yes

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
artist and just risk taker I think yes

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:37.140 
artist and just risk taker I think yes
it<00:02:29.800> would<00:02:30.160> definitely<00:02:34.290> much<00:02:35.940> pressure<00:02:36.940> you

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
it would definitely much pressure you

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.490 
it would definitely much pressure you
have<00:02:37.210> a<00:02:37.330> couple<00:02:37.930> projects<00:02:38.290> in<00:02:38.410> the<00:02:38.440> works

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
have a couple projects in the works

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.890 
have a couple projects in the works
right<00:02:38.740> now<00:02:38.890> I<00:02:39.070> know<00:02:39.520> the<00:02:39.640> movement<00:02:40.630> was<00:02:40.660> with

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
right now I know the movement was with

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.890 
right now I know the movement was with
him<00:02:41.200> if<00:02:41.590> I<00:02:41.920> what<00:02:42.400> was<00:02:42.550> the<00:02:42.730> direction<00:02:43.060> I<00:02:43.450> he<00:02:43.780> has

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
him if I what was the direction I he has

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.449

said<00:02:44.080> that<00:02:44.200> something<00:02:44.440> back<00:02:44.709> partner<00:02:45.040> now<00:02:45.190> for

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
said that something back partner now for

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:47.910 
said that something back partner now for
the<00:02:45.580> time<00:02:45.880> being<00:02:46.209> like<00:02:46.900> what<00:02:47.140> was<00:02:47.800> the

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
the time being like what was the

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.350 
the time being like what was the
direction<00:02:48.250> that<00:02:48.610> you<00:02:48.850> were<00:02:48.940> trying<00:02:49.090> to<00:02:49.180> go<00:02:49.330> out

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.000 
direction that you were trying to go out
with<00:02:49.570> that<00:02:49.900> but<00:02:50.050> it<00:02:50.440> was<00:02:50.560> just<00:02:50.590> with<00:02:50.980> a

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
with that but it was just with a

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.160 
with that but it was just with a
youthful<00:02:51.459> funding<00:02:52.150> and<00:02:52.420> we<00:02:52.600> are<00:02:52.750> the<00:02:52.959> only

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170
