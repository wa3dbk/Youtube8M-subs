the<00:00:05.370> Ninja<00:00:05.759> Turtles<00:00:05.790> actually<00:00:06.750> originated<00:00:07.560> in

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
the Ninja Turtles actually originated in

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.470 
the Ninja Turtles actually originated in
the<00:00:07.859> Eastman<00:00:08.189> and<00:00:08.370> Laird<00:00:08.550> comics<00:00:09.030> as<00:00:09.210> very

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
the Eastman and Laird comics as very

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.049 
the Eastman and Laird comics as very
hardcore<00:00:09.929> vigilantes<00:00:10.889> and<00:00:11.130> so<00:00:11.550> I<00:00:11.580> thought<00:00:11.880> the

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
hardcore vigilantes and so I thought the

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:13.970 
hardcore vigilantes and so I thought the
opportunity<00:00:12.750> here<00:00:13.049> that<00:00:13.080> I<00:00:13.230> hadn't<00:00:13.679> really

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
opportunity here that I hadn't really

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.770 
opportunity here that I hadn't really
seen<00:00:14.009> in<00:00:14.309> the<00:00:14.429> past<00:00:14.670> films<00:00:15.000> was<00:00:15.269> to<00:00:15.450> make<00:00:15.599> them

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
seen in the past films was to make them

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.960 
seen in the past films was to make them
even<00:00:16.139> more<00:00:16.170> badass<00:00:16.710> than<00:00:17.430> I<00:00:17.550> had<00:00:17.670> seen<00:00:17.850> them

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
even more badass than I had seen them

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:18.910 
even more badass than I had seen them
before

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:18.920 
before

dude<00:00:19.920> in<00:00:20.400> reinventing<00:00:21.119> the<00:00:21.810> turtles<00:00:22.170> this

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
dude in reinventing the turtles this

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.439 
dude in reinventing the turtles this
time<00:00:22.560> if<00:00:22.830> we<00:00:23.070> made<00:00:23.369> them<00:00:23.550> a<00:00:23.609> little<00:00:23.880> larger

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
time if we made them a little larger

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.800 
time if we made them a little larger
than<00:00:24.600> life<00:00:24.869> a<00:00:25.460> little<00:00:26.480> darker<00:00:27.480> in<00:00:27.630> their

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
than life a little darker in their

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.099 
than life a little darker in their
design<00:00:28.230> they<00:00:28.740> could<00:00:28.949> be<00:00:29.130> fun<00:00:29.550> and<00:00:29.820> badass<00:00:30.810> at

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
design they could be fun and badass at

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.080 
design they could be fun and badass at
the<00:00:31.260> same<00:00:31.500> time<00:00:31.830> allow<00:00:32.369> me<00:00:32.610> to<00:00:32.730> be<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:32.910> badass

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
the same time allow me to be the badass

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:39.100 
the same time allow me to be the badass
for<00:00:33.390> once

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.110 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:40.720 

and<00:00:39.530> so<00:00:39.950> that<00:00:40.160> was<00:00:40.309> sort<00:00:40.550> of<00:00:40.579> the<00:00:40.700> inspiration

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 
and so that was sort of the inspiration

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.110 
and so that was sort of the inspiration
going<00:00:41.420> forward<00:00:41.780> and<00:00:41.960> it<00:00:42.739> just<00:00:43.100> felt<00:00:43.550> different

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.120 
going forward and it just felt different

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.569 
going forward and it just felt different
in<00:00:44.510> a<00:00:44.600> good<00:00:44.629> way<00:00:44.989> and<00:00:45.020> felt<00:00:45.470> like<00:00:45.710> a<00:00:45.920> worthy

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:46.579 
in a good way and felt like a worthy

00:00:46.579 --> 00:01:00.520 
in a good way and felt like a worthy
addition<00:00:47.149> to<00:00:47.750> the<00:00:47.870> canon<00:00:48.290> come<00:00:48.800> on

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.080 

you<00:01:01.530> know<00:01:01.620> I<00:01:01.650> grew<00:01:01.980> up<00:01:02.040> with<00:01:02.310> Ninja<00:01:02.670> Turtles

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
you know I grew up with Ninja Turtles

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.210 
you know I grew up with Ninja Turtles
and<00:01:03.210> what's<00:01:03.840> so<00:01:04.080> great<00:01:04.110> is<00:01:04.650> with<00:01:04.860> today's

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
and what's so great is with today's

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.850 
and what's so great is with today's
technology<00:01:06.060> we've<00:01:06.210> been<00:01:06.390> able<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:06.690> update<00:01:06.990> the

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
technology we've been able to update the

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.130 
technology we've been able to update the
turtles<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.490> give<00:01:08.760> them<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.570> scope<00:01:10.110> that

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
turtles and give them a scope that

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.920 
turtles and give them a scope that
they've<00:01:10.500> never<00:01:10.680> had<00:01:10.890> before<00:01:11.300> we<00:01:12.300> also<00:01:12.660> down

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
they've never had before we also down

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.140 
they've never had before we also down
and<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:13.470> thought<00:01:13.890> about<00:01:13.920> how<00:01:14.190> important<00:01:15.000> it

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
and and thought about how important it

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.810 
and and thought about how important it
was<00:01:15.330> for<00:01:15.660> this<00:01:16.080> movie<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.530> be<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:17.580> character

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
was for this movie to be the character

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.180 
was for this movie to be the character
movie<00:01:18.300> and<00:01:18.570> how<00:01:19.080> important<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.680> performance

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:20.190 
movie and how important the performance

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.940 
movie and how important the performance
is<00:01:20.310> we're<00:01:20.520> so<00:01:21.240> for<00:01:21.660> about<00:01:21.870> six<00:01:22.530> seven<00:01:22.650> months

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
is we're so for about six seven months

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.460 
is we're so for about six seven months
took<00:01:23.820> every<00:01:24.180> one<00:01:24.210> of<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.510> scenes<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:25.110> thought

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
took every one of the scenes and thought

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.650 
took every one of the scenes and thought
about<00:01:25.740> you<00:01:26.160> know<00:01:26.220> how<00:01:26.430> to<00:01:26.490> actually<00:01:26.760> make<00:01:27.240> it

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:27.660 
about you know how to actually make it

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.330 
about you know how to actually make it
possible<00:01:27.690> on<00:01:28.440> the<00:01:28.680> set

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
possible on the set

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.750 
possible on the set
I<00:01:33.050> think<00:01:34.050> previous<00:01:34.800> in<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.250> sequence<00:01:35.640> is

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:35.760 
I think previous in the sequence is

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.219 
I think previous in the sequence is
really<00:01:36.090> really<00:01:36.330> important<00:01:36.690> for<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.840> kind<00:01:37.080> of

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
really really important for the kind of

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.270 
really really important for the kind of
visual<00:01:37.500> effects<00:01:37.680> movie<00:01:37.950> that<00:01:38.070> we're<00:01:38.220> making<00:01:38.250> a

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
visual effects movie that we're making a

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.880 
visual effects movie that we're making a
lot<00:01:41.280> of<00:01:41.430> times<00:01:41.700> you<00:01:41.940> have<00:01:42.150> to<00:01:42.360> previz<00:01:43.050> a<00:01:43.350> scene

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
lot of times you have to previz a scene

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.560 
lot of times you have to previz a scene
so<00:01:44.040> you<00:01:44.130> know<00:01:44.250> exactly<00:01:44.430> what<00:01:44.940> to<00:01:44.970> shoot<00:01:45.360> and

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
so you know exactly what to shoot and

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.270 
so you know exactly what to shoot and
you<00:01:45.720> don't<00:01:45.900> waste<00:01:46.080> a<00:01:46.260> lot<00:01:46.410> of<00:01:46.470> time<00:01:46.770> on<00:01:46.979> set

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
you don't waste a lot of time on set

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.130 
you don't waste a lot of time on set
right<00:01:47.790> some<00:01:48.330> of<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.479> previous<00:01:48.840> has<00:01:48.960> been

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
right some of the previous has been

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.310 
right some of the previous has been
going<00:01:49.830> on<00:01:49.950> for<00:01:50.220> years<00:01:50.250> I'm<00:01:50.910> just<00:01:51.510> planning<00:01:51.750> and

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
going on for years I'm just planning and

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.500 
going on for years I'm just planning and
coming<00:01:52.950> up<00:01:53.070> with<00:01:53.220> shot<00:01:53.460> designs<00:01:53.910> and<00:01:54.330> stuff

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:54.510 
coming up with shot designs and stuff

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.570 
coming up with shot designs and stuff
like<00:01:54.660> that<00:01:54.930> so<00:01:55.170> it's<00:01:55.560> pretty<00:01:55.619> integral<00:01:56.340> part

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:56.580 
like that so it's pretty integral part

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.550 
like that so it's pretty integral part
and<00:01:56.729> it's<00:01:56.850> also<00:01:57.000> very<00:01:57.180> helpful<00:01:57.869> in<00:01:58.110> planning

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
and it's also very helpful in planning

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:29.509 
and it's also very helpful in planning
the<00:01:58.890> shoot

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:32.820 

see<00:02:30.519> Jonathan's<00:02:31.000> really<00:02:31.299> good<00:02:31.480> about<00:02:31.830> taking

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
see Jonathan's really good about taking

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.649 
see Jonathan's really good about taking
a<00:02:33.040> look<00:02:33.280> at<00:02:33.400> those<00:02:33.549> scenes<00:02:33.879> and<00:02:34.120> placing

00:02:34.649 --> 00:02:34.659 
a look at those scenes and placing

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:36.949 
a look at those scenes and placing
cameras<00:02:35.049> were<00:02:35.260> working<00:02:36.040> it's<00:02:36.220> doing<00:02:36.640> and

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
cameras were working it's doing and

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.420 
cameras were working it's doing and
experimenting<00:02:37.959> a<00:02:38.019> little<00:02:38.140> bit<00:02:38.290> some<00:02:39.250> of<00:02:39.340> the

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
experimenting a little bit some of the

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.940 
experimenting a little bit some of the
things<00:02:39.640> do<00:02:40.420> change<00:02:40.450> by<00:02:41.110> then<00:02:41.349> they<00:02:41.650> become

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
things do change by then they become

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.630 
things do change by then they become
funnier<00:02:42.489> or<00:02:42.519> or<00:02:43.420> more<00:02:44.069> emotional<00:02:45.069> and<00:02:45.400> so<00:02:45.579> you

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
funnier or or more emotional and so you

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.030
