00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.280 
much better about this defense

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.650 
much better about this defense
especially<00:00:57.400> with<00:00:58.239> the<00:00:58.329> way<00:00:58.420> that<00:00:58.510> we've

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:58.660 
especially with the way that we've

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:59.940 
especially with the way that we've
bonded<00:00:58.840> together<00:00:59.110> and<00:00:59.440> whether<00:00:59.620> we<00:00:59.680> were<00:00:59.860> out

00:00:59.940 --> 00:00:59.950 
bonded together and whether we were out

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:01.170 
bonded together and whether we were out
here<00:01:00.070> playing<00:01:00.340> for<00:01:00.430> each<00:01:00.610> other<00:01:00.760> we<00:01:00.940> played

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:01.180 
here playing for each other we played

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.420 
here playing for each other we played
with<00:01:01.360> a<00:01:01.390> with<00:01:02.200> a<00:01:02.230> whole<00:01:02.500> new<00:01:02.530> confidence<00:01:03.190> level

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.430 
with a with a whole new confidence level

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:04.920 
with a with a whole new confidence level
and<00:01:03.520> we<00:01:03.579> had<00:01:03.730> a<00:01:03.760> whole<00:01:04.150> new<00:01:04.300> swagger<00:01:04.600> out<00:01:04.809> there

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
and we had a whole new swagger out there

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:06.510 
and we had a whole new swagger out there
on<00:01:05.019> defense<00:01:05.170> we<00:01:05.620> know<00:01:05.740> we<00:01:05.860> got<00:01:06.010> the<00:01:06.100> players<00:01:06.310> to

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
on defense we know we got the players to

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:07.860 
on defense we know we got the players to
do<00:01:06.640> it<00:01:06.790> and<00:01:06.970> you<00:01:07.090> know<00:01:07.150> we<00:01:07.390> have<00:01:07.510> the<00:01:07.600> coaches

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:07.870 
do it and you know we have the coaches

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:09.660 
do it and you know we have the coaches
to<00:01:07.960> do<00:01:08.080> it<00:01:08.200> too<00:01:08.350> so<00:01:08.860> the<00:01:09.070> only<00:01:09.220> thing<00:01:09.310> is<00:01:09.520> it's

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
to do it too so the only thing is it's

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.560 
to do it too so the only thing is it's
about<00:01:09.790> there<00:01:09.970> and<00:01:10.060> execute

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.450 

you<00:01:15.570> know<00:01:15.660> I<00:01:15.690> think<00:01:16.020> we<00:01:16.230> we<00:01:16.680> move<00:01:16.860> Devon<00:01:17.220> back

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
you know I think we we move Devon back

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.510 
you know I think we we move Devon back
to<00:01:17.670> his<00:01:17.850> most<00:01:18.180> comfortable<00:01:18.600> position<00:01:19.040> I<00:01:20.040> think

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
to his most comfortable position I think

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.060 
to his most comfortable position I think
Dion<00:01:20.850> Dion<00:01:21.810> could<00:01:22.080> be<00:01:22.230> a<00:01:22.260> great<00:01:22.410> safety<00:01:22.740> but<00:01:23.040> I

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
Dion Dion could be a great safety but I

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.280 
Dion Dion could be a great safety but I
think<00:01:23.370> in<00:01:23.610> college<00:01:24.360> football<00:01:24.540> right<00:01:24.960> now<00:01:25.080> he's

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
think in college football right now he's

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.660 
think in college football right now he's
going<00:01:25.410> to<00:01:25.500> be<00:01:25.590> a<00:01:25.620> great<00:01:25.800> outside<00:01:26.250> linebacker

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
going to be a great outside linebacker

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.170 
going to be a great outside linebacker
because<00:01:27.240> he<00:01:27.480> can<00:01:27.720> move<00:01:27.960> out<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.380> match<00:01:28.620> up<00:01:29.180> but

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
because he can move out and match up but

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.910 
because he can move out and match up but
he's<00:01:30.270> physical<00:01:30.720> enough<00:01:30.900> to<00:01:31.380> be<00:01:31.530> able<00:01:31.650> to<00:01:31.800> play

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
he's physical enough to be able to play

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.370 
he's physical enough to be able to play
linebacker<00:01:32.310> so<00:01:32.940> I<00:01:32.970> think<00:01:33.930> we're<00:01:34.170> getting<00:01:34.230> the

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
linebacker so I think we're getting the

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.840 
linebacker so I think we're getting the
best<00:01:34.560> of<00:01:34.680> both<00:01:34.800> worlds<00:01:35.160> with<00:01:35.190> both<00:01:35.430> those<00:01:35.640> kids

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
best of both worlds with both those kids

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.820 
best of both worlds with both those kids
so<00:01:36.060> we<00:01:36.210> have<00:01:36.360> three<00:01:36.630> very<00:01:36.840> good<00:01:36.930> Russians<00:01:37.560> in

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:37.830 
so we have three very good Russians in

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.420 
so we have three very good Russians in
the<00:01:37.860> bond<00:01:38.190> and<00:01:38.460> Nick<00:01:38.730> and<00:01:39.000> Wes<00:01:39.630> Horton<00:01:39.870> and

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
the bond and Nick and Wes Horton and

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.650 
the bond and Nick and Wes Horton and
we'll<00:01:41.430> go<00:01:41.550> get<00:01:41.670> some<00:01:41.820> guys<00:01:41.970> inside<00:01:42.360> it<00:01:42.540> could

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:42.660 
we'll go get some guys inside it could

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:44.060 
we'll go get some guys inside it could
really<00:01:42.840> play<00:01:43.170> so<00:01:43.230> I<00:01:43.470> think<00:01:43.740> it<00:01:43.830> will<00:01:43.890> be

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
really play so I think it will be

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.610 
really play so I think it will be
