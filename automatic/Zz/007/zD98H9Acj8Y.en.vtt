00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:03.160 
indicator and the gears are set up to be
I<00:01:01.459> guess<00:01:02.119> just<00:01:02.329> a<00:01:02.389> little<00:01:02.600> bit<00:01:02.690> different<00:01:03.049> than

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
I guess just a little bit different than

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:04.959 
I guess just a little bit different than
a<00:01:03.199> lot<00:01:03.379> of<00:01:03.409> the<00:01:03.559> bikes<00:01:03.769> that<00:01:03.920> I've<00:01:04.309> used<00:01:04.729> in<00:01:04.909> the

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:04.969 
a lot of the bikes that I've used in the

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:06.940 
a lot of the bikes that I've used in the
past<00:01:05.210> this<00:01:05.539> is<00:01:05.780> actually<00:01:06.289> to<00:01:06.380> shift<00:01:06.590> down<00:01:06.649> and

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
past this is actually to shift down and

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.630 
past this is actually to shift down and
this<00:01:07.070> is<00:01:07.189> a<00:01:07.219> shift<00:01:07.549> up<00:01:07.869> so<00:01:08.869> it's<00:01:08.990> just<00:01:09.170> a

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
this is a shift up so it's just a

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.749 
this is a shift up so it's just a
different<00:01:10.640> more<00:01:11.180> simple<00:01:11.659> setup<00:01:12.619> also<00:01:13.310> this

00:01:13.749 --> 00:01:13.759 
different more simple setup also this

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:16.569 
different more simple setup also this
bike<00:01:13.939> has<00:01:14.149> kind<00:01:14.420> of<00:01:14.479> a<00:01:14.679> more<00:01:15.679> upright<00:01:16.009> seating

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:16.579 
bike has kind of a more upright seating

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:19.630 
bike has kind of a more upright seating
position<00:01:17.060> as<00:01:17.380> you<00:01:18.380> can<00:01:18.560> see<00:01:18.829> that<00:01:19.100> the<00:01:19.340> seat<00:01:19.609> is

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
position as you can see that the seat is

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.569 
position as you can see that the seat is
really<00:01:20.229> cushy<00:01:21.229> when<00:01:21.920> you're<00:01:22.070> riding<00:01:22.219> and

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:22.579 
really cushy when you're riding and

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:25.330 
really cushy when you're riding and
you've<00:01:23.450> got<00:01:23.630> an<00:01:23.719> upright<00:01:24.140> view<00:01:24.469> point<00:01:24.770> which

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
you've got an upright view point which

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.639 
you've got an upright view point which
is<00:01:25.579> maybe<00:01:26.450> a<00:01:26.539> little<00:01:26.659> bit<00:01:26.869> safer<00:01:27.289> when<00:01:27.530> you're

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:27.649 
is maybe a little bit safer when you're

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:30.459 
is maybe a little bit safer when you're
in<00:01:27.740> traffic<00:01:28.100> you<00:01:28.189> can<00:01:28.340> look<00:01:28.490> around<00:01:28.609> I<00:01:29.469> have

00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:30.469 
in traffic you can look around I have

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:32.080 
in traffic you can look around I have
had<00:01:30.649> a<00:01:30.679> couple<00:01:30.859> rough<00:01:31.219> moments<00:01:31.640> getting<00:01:31.909> on

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
had a couple rough moments getting on

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.599

00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:34.609 
and off the Pedigo comfort Cruiser just

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:36.039 
and off the Pedigo comfort Cruiser just
because<00:01:34.820> the<00:01:34.939> battery<00:01:35.270> is<00:01:35.570> mounted<00:01:35.899> on<00:01:36.020> the

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
because the battery is mounted on the

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:38.919 
because the battery is mounted on the
saddle<00:01:36.350> and<00:01:36.679> you<00:01:37.189> can<00:01:37.340> kind<00:01:37.609> of<00:01:37.700> kick<00:01:38.450> it<00:01:38.630> when

00:01:38.919 --> 00:01:38.929

you're swinging your feet around sort of

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.029 
you're swinging your feet around sort of
a<00:01:41.119> bummer<00:01:41.710> but<00:01:42.710> when<00:01:42.920> you<00:01:43.240> once<00:01:44.240> you<00:01:44.390> get<00:01:44.539> on

00:01:45.029 --> 00:01:45.039 
a bummer but when you once you get on

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:47.529 
a bummer but when you once you get on
it's<00:01:46.039> really<00:01:46.280> great<00:01:46.640> as<00:01:46.880> you<00:01:46.999> can<00:01:47.149> see<00:01:47.329> here

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:48.999 
it's really great as you can see here
I'm<00:01:47.659> just<00:01:47.689> kind<00:01:47.990> of<00:01:48.020> sitting<00:01:48.259> in<00:01:48.439> a<00:01:48.499> relaxed

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 
I'm just kind of sitting in a relaxed

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:51.279 
I'm just kind of sitting in a relaxed
upright<00:01:49.429> position<00:01:49.850> you've<00:01:50.450> got<00:01:50.630> your<00:01:50.780> head

00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:51.289 
upright position you've got your head

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:53.770 
upright position you've got your head
completely<00:01:51.859> free<00:01:52.130> to<00:01:52.249> look<00:01:52.369> around<00:01:52.520> I<00:01:53.420> think

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
completely free to look around I think

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.749 
completely free to look around I think
you're<00:01:54.049> also<00:01:54.319> maybe<00:01:54.469> more<00:01:54.770> visible<00:01:55.130> to<00:01:55.189> two

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
you're also maybe more visible to two

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:57.940 
you're also maybe more visible to two
cars<00:01:55.999> than<00:01:56.899> if<00:01:57.020> you're<00:01:57.170> in<00:01:57.319> this<00:01:57.469> kind<00:01:57.740> of<00:01:57.799> like

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
cars than if you're in this kind of like

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.849 
cars than if you're in this kind of like
crouched<00:01:58.369> over<00:01:58.789> position<00:01:59.499> so<00:02:00.499> now<00:02:00.619> I'm<00:02:00.740> going

00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:00.859 
crouched over position so now I'm going

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:04.320 
crouched over position so now I'm going
to<00:02:01.009> kind<00:02:01.759> of<00:02:01.789> do<00:02:01.939> a<00:02:01.969> zero<00:02:02.359> to<00:02:02.569> full<00:02:03.139> throttle

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
to kind of do a zero to full throttle

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.300 
to kind of do a zero to full throttle
