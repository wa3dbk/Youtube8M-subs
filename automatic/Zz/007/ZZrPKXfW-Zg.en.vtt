00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.610
 hello how about how are you welcome 

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:06.350
 here again to my channel today I bring you 

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:08.990
 a very interesting accessory that I 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:11.059
 buy then a week and a half yes 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:12.440
 more or less I've been testing it and the 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:15.469
 true that has not given me any problem 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:18.289
 and it's magnificently good it's about a 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:20.779
 cable that will allow me to connect what 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:23.060
 which is the telephone to television for 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:25.189
 I can see the contents of the phone 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.919
 on television so bigger 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:31.130
 so to watch movies or to put a 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:33.830
 video etcetera I was informing and 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:36.560
 they sell a kind of adapters that 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:38.660
 later they have a hdmi output 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:41.180
 to connect it with a cable that 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.670
 sells separately to the television but I 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.550
 it was quite expensive and it was a price 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:50.750
 quite exorbitant and I do not remember 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:53.030
 now but I left it and this cable on ebay 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.700
 concretely it cost me seven euros is a 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:58.220
 cable m hl which in this case is 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:01.370
 compatible with the galaxy s3 alone with him 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:03.410
 do not go to try it with a galaxy s2 or 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.699
 well because it does not work, they're just 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.500
 those devices that are 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.960
 compatible with technology 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.480
 msn and is the next cable that I'm going to 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:14.240
 show right now good I came in the 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:16.550
 pregnancy and everything but good I already opened it 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.590
 like me absolutely or a week ago 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:21.620
 more or less and as you can see is that 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:24.220
 this is the cable voucher sent to slide it 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:27.190
 so you can see it 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:30.070
 Well, here we have to start a 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:33.400
 hdmi input as you can see here not 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.930
 I know if you will see and hdmi as you can see is 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.740
 a normal entry this entry would go 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:40.240
 connected to the television is important 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.230
 obviously that our television has 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.580
 input hdmi and then we have a usb 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:48.840
 normal and current that would be connected to 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:51.340
 charger because if the charger the telefe 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.580
 the phone can not connect is 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.590
 Say you need me to be loading 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.600
 continuously this and happens with this cable 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.720
 and with the adapter it is also valid and then 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:04.440
 the microusb connection that is lm hl I do not know 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.440
 if you can see it 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:12.840
 m hl I am a day to the micro usb of 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:15.300
 phone as you can see is an entrance 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.250
 longer than the loaders but 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.470
 fits perfectly and I never say the 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.090
 there is 2 for example I have tried it and not 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.680
 there has been a way for it to enter either 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.220
 it's a matter of force because you can 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.230
 break down then it would basically be 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.330
 all this so well I do not want you 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.250
 entertain more than cut the video we 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.770
 we go to the television and we try it there 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.320
 agree now as good friends as 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:40.510
 I just connected it as you can see 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:43.180
 it's very simple I just have to 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.930
 connect as I said before 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:49.060
 what is the venue I watched television 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.549
 then the usb connected it to a 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.319
 charger that I have the usb slot that 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:56.110
 is the charger that came with me 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:58.090
 phone and then I connected the 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.790
 phone cord and up as you can 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.790
 see what we can put in time in vertical 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:06.000
 or horizontally 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.730
 and also we are placed and well then 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.209
 we can browse all the screens 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.859
 OK 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.109
 let's go down the notification bar 

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:15.359
 etcetera and good for you to see that 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:17.069
 because they say that the other 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:19.170
 adapter brings its own card 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:21.239
 super fluid video does not have any 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:24.269
 problem I'm going to put it is a game for 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:26.370
 what you see also includes audio a thing 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:29.090
 quite interesting 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:32.500
 then, then 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.500
 it is not cut at all 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:37.830
 you can regulate the audio 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:41.050
 the games perfectly have nothing 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:45.310
 of beer this mind just like him 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:48.510
 what is the phone you can see so 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.510
 it's going pretty good 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:55.960
 I tell you the cable I bought it in 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:58.600
 ebay cost me 78 euros I do not remember 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:00.250
 ok but it's going pretty good and the truth 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:03.910
 I do not have any complaints works to the 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:07.700
 perfection there is no kind of the whole 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:10.099
 perfect that is pretty good 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:13.280
 and nothing friends this was today's video 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:14.989
 I hope you liked it basically 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.620
 was to show you this accessory that 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:18.660
 I've seen 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:22.510
 quite interesting I will not value if 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:25.150
 we want to watch movies or 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:28.120
 or any video to see it bigger 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.710
 and good to tell you that a problem that I have 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.300
 seen I this cable is that the screen 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:34.000
 the phone always stays on 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:36.100
 and then when loading 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.050
 continuously and the screen does not 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:40.470
 Yes crash ever that we 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.790
 it heats up the phone pretty much so 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:44.050
 that's one thing that you can not 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:46.750
 solve because also in the 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:49.570
 adapter happens so that would be the 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:51.220
 main hits that I see to the cable 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:53.410
 but otherwise everything 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:55.980
 perfectly the audio also comes 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:59.140
 integrated so I do not have any 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:01.360
 no fault with him is already I will leave you the 

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:02.470
 link down here from the place where I've 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.290
