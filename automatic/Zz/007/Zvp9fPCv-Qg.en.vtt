00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.490 

Game<00:00:00.210> one<00:00:00.450> but<00:00:00.719> then<00:00:00.810> he<00:00:00.900> kind<00:00:01.020> of<00:00:01.140> choked<00:00:01.380> in

00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:01.500 
Game one but then he kind of choked in

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.470 
Game one but then he kind of choked in
the<00:00:01.589> end<00:00:01.740> so<00:00:02.010> I<00:00:02.280> wouldn't<00:00:02.820> count<00:00:02.939> cast<00:00:03.270> you<00:00:03.449> out

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
the end so I wouldn't count cast you out

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.360 
the end so I wouldn't count cast you out
completely<00:00:03.750> I<00:00:04.170> think<00:00:04.410> he<00:00:04.470> has<00:00:04.560> a<00:00:04.589> chance<00:00:04.680> it<00:00:05.250> is

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
completely I think he has a chance it is

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.309 
completely I think he has a chance it is
mirror<00:00:05.640> match<00:00:05.850> anything<00:00:06.390> kind<00:00:06.839> of<00:00:06.930> happened

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
mirror match anything kind of happened

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.410 
mirror match anything kind of happened
but<00:00:07.950> I'm<00:00:08.280> definitely<00:00:08.550> giving<00:00:08.820> the<00:00:09.030> edge<00:00:09.150> to

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
but I'm definitely giving the edge to

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.120 
but I'm definitely giving the edge to

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
here he's played a lot of games here for

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.630 
here he's played a lot of games here for
prime<00:00:39.780> he's<00:00:39.960> 1<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:40.379> 8<00:00:40.620> kind<00:00:41.280> of<00:00:41.340> like<00:00:41.460> what

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
prime he's 1 and 8 kind of like what

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.290 
prime he's 1 and 8 kind of like what
effort<00:00:42.239> was<00:00:42.390> at<00:00:42.570> he's<00:00:42.930> also<00:00:43.200> owned<00:00:43.530> 2<00:00:44.030> vs<00:00:45.030> zerg

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
effort was at he's also owned 2 vs zerg

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.450 
effort was at he's also owned 2 vs zerg
and<00:00:45.510> he<00:00:45.870> actually<00:00:46.200> has<00:00:46.559> five<00:00:46.860> losses<00:00:47.129> in<00:00:47.370> a<00:00:47.430> row

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
and he actually has five losses in a row

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.850 
and he actually has five losses in a row
here<00:00:47.760> so<00:00:48.000> obviously<00:00:48.899> not<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.260> best<00:00:49.410> results

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
here so obviously not the best results

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.260 
here so obviously not the best results
but<00:00:50.039> still<00:00:50.309> you<00:00:50.579> know<00:00:50.670> everything<00:00:51.000> that<00:00:51.149> move

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
all it all really comes down to often

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:54.490 
all it all really comes down to often
times<00:02:52.730> in<00:02:52.880> this<00:02:53.000> matchup<00:02:53.269> with<00:02:54.019> an<00:02:54.140> early<00:02:54.230> pool

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
times in this matchup with an early pool

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.500 
times in this matchup with an early pool
what<00:02:54.980> the<00:02:55.100> build<00:02:55.340> of<00:02:55.489> sue<00:02:55.730> is<00:02:55.940> how<00:02:56.120> much<00:02:56.269> is<00:02:56.420> he

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
what the build of sue is how much is he

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.509 
what the build of sue is how much is he
going<00:02:56.660> to<00:02:56.720> be<00:02:57.170> greedy<00:02:57.440> exactly<00:02:58.130> right<00:02:58.280> and<00:02:58.340> we

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
see a gases as well so we could very

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.580 
see a gases as well so we could very

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
very girly in a mirror match like this

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.220 
very girly in a mirror match like this
he<00:03:40.340> just<00:03:40.459> wants<00:03:40.730> to<00:03:40.820> play<00:03:40.910> see<00:03:41.030> he<00:03:41.660> feels<00:03:41.989> like

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
wants to get the hatch out but then

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.840 
wants to get the hatch out but then
afterwards<00:03:46.069> be<00:03:46.370> a<00:03:46.400> bit<00:03:46.580> safe<00:03:46.790> and<00:03:46.970> that's<00:03:47.030> why

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
afterwards be a bit safe and that's why

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.120 
afterwards be a bit safe and that's why
that<00:03:48.240> pool<00:03:48.420> right<00:03:48.600> away<00:03:48.780> exactly<00:03:49.590> it's<00:03:49.890> very

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
that pool right away exactly it's very

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.160 
that pool right away exactly it's very
very<00:03:50.670> safe<00:03:50.910> to<00:03:51.060> assume<00:03:51.150> that<00:03:51.450> a<00:03:51.630> player<00:03:51.930> that's

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
very safe to assume that a player that's

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.020 
very safe to assume that a player that's
not<00:03:52.440> doing<00:03:52.710> very<00:03:52.740> well<00:03:52.980> it<00:03:53.280> has<00:03:53.460> five<00:03:53.730> losses

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
not doing very well it has five losses

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.090 
not doing very well it has five losses
in<00:03:54.240> a<00:03:54.330> row<00:03:54.360> is<00:03:55.080> probably<00:03:55.590> going<00:03:55.740> to<00:03:55.800> throw<00:03:55.980> out

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
in a row is probably going to throw out

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.830 
in a row is probably going to throw out
