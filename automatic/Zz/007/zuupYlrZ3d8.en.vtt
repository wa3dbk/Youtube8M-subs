made a couple of these videos in that uh

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.030 
made a couple of these videos in that uh
maybe<00:00:35.640> it's<00:00:35.820> not<00:00:36.390> worth<00:00:36.719> it<00:00:36.899> to<00:00:37.140> record<00:00:37.530> every

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
maybe it's not worth it to record every

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.580 
maybe it's not worth it to record every
single<00:00:38.399> minute<00:00:38.550> of<00:00:38.790> game<00:00:39.000> play<00:00:39.350> I'm<00:00:40.350> still

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
single minute of game play I'm still

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.619 
single minute of game play I'm still
going<00:00:40.710> on<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:40.980> edge<00:00:41.129> of<00:00:41.340> it<00:00:41.489> I<00:00:41.730> just<00:00:42.450> think

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
going on the edge of it I just think

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.840 
going on the edge of it I just think
that<00:00:42.840> there's<00:00:43.559> not<00:00:43.770> much<00:00:44.460> that's<00:00:44.730> gonna

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
that there's not much that's gonna

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.029 
that there's not much that's gonna
change<00:00:45.239> from<00:00:45.570> video<00:00:45.870> to<00:00:45.930> video<00:00:46.170> if<00:00:46.559> all<00:00:46.890> I'm

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
change from video to video if all I'm

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.020 
change from video to video if all I'm
doing<00:00:47.340> is<00:00:47.660> well<00:00:48.660> leveling<00:00:49.320> up<00:00:49.559> I<00:00:50.030> can

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
doing is well leveling up I can

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.119 
doing is well leveling up I can
certainly<00:00:51.210> show<00:00:51.780> a<00:00:52.199> lot<00:00:52.379> of<00:00:52.500> that<00:00:52.620> game<00:00:52.829> play

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
certainly show a lot of that game play

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.180 
certainly show a lot of that game play
and<00:00:53.370> I<00:00:54.360> can<00:00:54.780> do<00:00:54.899> that<00:00:55.020> maybe<00:00:55.199> with<00:00:55.469> again<00:00:56.010> I

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
and I can do that maybe with again I

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.369 
and I can do that maybe with again I
brought<00:00:56.370> this<00:00:56.520> up<00:00:56.670> before<00:00:56.760> but<00:00:57.059> maybe

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
brought this up before but maybe

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:02.779 
brought this up before but maybe
montages<00:00:58.379> or<00:00:58.940> I<00:01:00.530> don't<00:01:01.530> know<00:01:01.710> I'm<00:01:02.280> still

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.710 
might want to see I figure
you<00:01:10.740> know<00:01:10.860> maybe<00:01:11.040> everybody<00:01:11.520> knows<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:12.360> whole

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
you know maybe everybody knows the whole

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.900 
you know maybe everybody knows the whole
stuff<00:01:13.020> I<00:01:13.260> don't<00:01:13.440> know<00:01:13.590> nut<00:01:14.190> maybe<00:01:14.400> not<00:01:14.670> that

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:14.910 
stuff I don't know nut maybe not that

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.120 
stuff I don't know nut maybe not that
everybody<00:01:15.480> knows<00:01:15.690> it<00:01:15.900> but<00:01:16.020> just<00:01:16.350> seeing<00:01:16.920> the

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
everybody knows it but just seeing the

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.590 
everybody knows it but just seeing the
same<00:01:17.370> stuff<00:01:17.610> over<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:17.970> over<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.270> over<00:01:18.360> again

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
same stuff over and over and over again

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.640 
same stuff over and over and over again
it's<00:01:18.900> going<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:19.080> get<00:01:19.230> old<00:01:21.560> so<00:01:22.560> I'm<00:01:23.150> planning<00:01:24.150> on

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:24.650 
it's going to get old so I'm planning on

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.010 
it's going to get old so I'm planning on
kind<00:01:25.650> of<00:01:25.770> splitting<00:01:26.220> it<00:01:26.460> up<00:01:26.550> a<00:01:26.730> little<00:01:26.910> bit<00:01:27.030> I

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
kind of splitting it up a little bit I

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.960 
kind of splitting it up a little bit I
haven't<00:01:28.530> truly<00:01:28.950> decided<00:01:29.490> because<00:01:29.610> right<00:01:29.940> now

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
haven't truly decided because right now

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.910 
haven't truly decided because right now
I'm<00:01:30.180> still<00:01:30.420> not<00:01:30.510> in<00:01:30.690> like<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:30.990> SAT<00:01:31.320> recording

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
I'm still not in like a SAT recording

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.890 
I'm still not in like a SAT recording
pattern<00:01:32.310> so<00:01:33.060> I'm<00:01:33.120> still<00:01:33.330> trying<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:33.600> figure<00:01:33.780> it

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
pattern so I'm still trying to figure it

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.990 
pattern so I'm still trying to figure it
out<00:01:34.110> but<00:01:34.170> I'm<00:01:34.410> thinking<00:01:34.800> maybe<00:01:34.920> you<00:01:35.580> know<00:01:35.700> one

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.990 
out but I'm thinking maybe you know one
or<00:01:36.120> two<00:01:36.390> videos<00:01:36.870> a<00:01:36.900> day<00:01:37.080> like<00:01:37.530> maybe<00:01:37.860> have<00:01:38.190> one

that's<00:02:07.110> probably<00:02:07.410> more<00:02:08.070> productive<00:02:08.990> and<00:02:09.990> more

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
that's probably more productive and more

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.660 
that's probably more productive and more
informative<00:02:10.649> for<00:02:10.860> you<00:02:10.920> guys<00:02:11.160> as<00:02:11.400> well<00:02:13.160> so<00:02:14.160> I'm

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
informative for you guys as well so I'm

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.780 
informative for you guys as well so I'm
still<00:02:14.730> not<00:02:15.450> sure<00:02:15.510> I<00:02:16.340> think<00:02:17.340> that's<00:02:17.520> gonna

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
still not sure I think that's gonna

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.220 
still not sure I think that's gonna
actually<00:02:17.970> require<00:02:18.390> more<00:02:18.660> work<00:02:18.870> for<00:02:19.080> me

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
actually require more work for me

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:20.330 
actually require more work for me
because<00:02:19.440> that<00:02:19.620> means<00:02:19.739> i<00:02:19.890> have<00:02:19.920> to<00:02:20.040> go<00:02:20.160> through

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
because that means i have to go through

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.960 
because that means i have to go through
all<00:02:20.400> of<00:02:20.550> the<00:02:21.120> footage<00:02:21.330> and<00:02:21.780> really<00:02:22.790> find<00:02:23.790> some

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
all of the footage and really find some

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.000 
all of the footage and really find some
highlights<00:02:24.420> but<00:02:24.690> i<00:02:24.840> think<00:02:25.260> in<00:02:25.410> the<00:02:25.590> end<00:02:25.620> it

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
highlights but i think in the end it

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.220 
highlights but i think in the end it
would<00:02:26.160> make<00:02:26.370> for<00:02:26.760> better<00:02:27.180> videos<00:02:29.959> so<00:02:30.959> i<00:02:30.989> might

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
would make for better videos so i might

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.229 
would make for better videos so i might
give<00:02:31.350> that<00:02:31.500> a<00:02:31.530> try<00:02:31.590> it's<00:02:32.519> the<00:02:32.760> weekend<00:02:33.090> right

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920
