are also called gravity pencils you know

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.300 
are also called gravity pencils you know
because<00:02:48.180> they<00:02:49.019> work<00:02:49.200> on<00:02:49.379> gravity<00:02:49.799> you<00:02:50.220> know

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
because they work on gravity you know

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.369 
because they work on gravity you know
you<00:02:50.400> just<00:02:50.730> open<00:02:51.060> the<00:02:51.180> push<00:02:51.690> little<00:02:51.870> button<00:02:52.200> the

out<00:02:54.629> like<00:02:54.840> that<00:02:54.989> and<00:02:55.530> need<00:02:56.370> a<00:02:56.400> little

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
out like that and need a little

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:58.130 
out like that and need a little
sharpener<00:02:57.120> for<00:02:57.299> the<00:02:57.360> each<00:02:57.450> I<00:02:57.870> don't<00:02:58.079> know

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
sharpener for the each I don't know

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.539 
sharpener for the each I don't know
where<00:02:58.260> my<00:02:58.349> sharpener<00:02:58.769> is<00:02:58.829> at<00:02:59.010> the<00:02:59.069> moment<00:02:59.400> but

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
where my sharpener is at the moment but

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:00.949 
where my sharpener is at the moment but
that's<00:02:59.910> okay<00:03:00.209> because<00:03:00.239> I<00:03:00.480> don't<00:03:00.660> use<00:03:00.750> these

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
wrong tool one of the things growing up

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.830 
wrong tool one of the things growing up
and<00:03:17.310> learning<00:03:17.549> cartooning<00:03:18.359> you<00:03:18.690> know<00:03:18.810> I

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
and learning cartooning you know I

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.569 
and learning cartooning you know I
thought<00:03:19.109> there<00:03:19.260> was<00:03:19.319> some<00:03:19.530> magic<00:03:19.980> tool<00:03:20.190> that

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
thought there was some magic tool that

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:22.660 
thought there was some magic tool that
was<00:03:20.790> gonna<00:03:20.940> make<00:03:21.120> me<00:03:21.269> a<00:03:21.299> great<00:03:21.510> cartoonist<00:03:22.140> and

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
was gonna make me a great cartoonist and

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.130 
was gonna make me a great cartoonist and
guess<00:03:23.670> what<00:03:23.940> as<00:03:24.420> well<00:03:24.569> get<00:03:24.690> this<00:03:24.810> out<00:03:24.930> of<00:03:25.079> the

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
guess what as well get this out of the

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.970 
guess what as well get this out of the
way<00:03:25.230> now<00:03:25.440> there<00:03:25.739> is<00:03:25.950> no<00:03:26.159> magic<00:03:26.579> tool<00:03:27.500> okay<00:03:28.530> it

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
way now there is no magic tool okay it

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.229 
way now there is no magic tool okay it
all<00:03:29.099> comes<00:03:29.340> down<00:03:29.459> to<00:03:29.870> practice<00:03:30.870> and<00:03:32.239> learning

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
all comes down to practice and learning

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:36.110 
all comes down to practice and learning
your<00:03:33.389> tools<00:03:33.690> and<00:03:34.160> learning<00:03:35.160> the<00:03:35.430> limitations

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
your tools and learning the limitations

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.170 
your tools and learning the limitations
of<00:03:36.569> what<00:03:36.630> your<00:03:36.930> tools<00:03:37.139> can<00:03:37.410> do<00:03:37.650> and<00:03:38.060> what<00:03:39.060> they

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
of what your tools can do and what they
