okay<00:00:07.180> I'm<00:00:07.360> going<00:00:07.840> to<00:00:07.900> show<00:00:07.990> you<00:00:08.140> how<00:00:08.320> to<00:00:08.670> set

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:09.670 
okay I'm going to show you how to set

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:15.630 
okay I'm going to show you how to set
the<00:00:09.910> speed<00:00:10.690> tables<00:00:11.290> for<00:00:12.280> your<00:00:12.400> logo<00:00:14.430> we've<00:00:15.430> got

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:15.640 
the speed tables for your logo we've got

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:19.109 
the speed tables for your logo we've got
the<00:00:15.880> decoder<00:00:16.390> installed<00:00:17.820> setting<00:00:18.820> on<00:00:18.939> the

the decoder installed setting on the
programming<00:00:19.750> track<00:00:21.449> well<00:00:22.449> we<00:00:22.600> need<00:00:22.810> to<00:00:22.930> do<00:00:23.110> is

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:23.320 
programming track well we need to do is

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:29.330 
programming track well we need to do is
set<00:00:23.590> our<00:00:24.900> voltages<00:00:25.900> to<00:00:25.930> start<00:00:26.560> and<00:00:26.800> run<00:00:26.980> a<00:00:27.039> loco

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
set our voltages to start and run a loco

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.630 
set our voltages to start and run a loco
digitrax<00:00:30.340> gives<00:00:30.910> you<00:00:31.119> a<00:00:31.710> speed<00:00:32.710> table<00:00:33.220> so<00:00:33.580> you

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:33.640 
digitrax gives you a speed table so you

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.869 
digitrax gives you a speed table so you
can<00:00:33.730> set<00:00:34.000> your<00:00:34.210> locomotive<00:00:34.960> to<00:00:35.199> run<00:00:35.850> like<00:00:36.850> a

00:00:36.869 --> 00:00:36.879 
can set your locomotive to run like a

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:39.360 
can set your locomotive to run like a
switcher<00:00:37.600> the<00:00:38.020> road<00:00:38.260> switcher<00:00:38.739> or<00:00:38.770> mainline

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.370 
switcher the road switcher or mainline

loco<00:00:41.340> set<00:00:42.340> your<00:00:42.550> start<00:00:42.850> voltage<00:00:43.390> you<00:00:44.290> can<00:00:44.410> set

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:44.710 
loco set your start voltage you can set

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:51.030 
loco set your start voltage you can set
your<00:00:44.950> maximum<00:00:45.430> speeds<00:00:47.250> see<00:00:48.250> v6<00:00:49.350> is<00:00:50.350> your<00:00:50.770> power

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:51.040 
your maximum speeds see v6 is your power

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.840 
your maximum speeds see v6 is your power
curve<00:00:52.200> so<00:00:53.200> you<00:00:53.530> could<00:00:53.950> start<00:00:54.219> out<00:00:54.399> slow<00:00:54.790> to

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:54.850 
curve so you could start out slow to

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.220 
curve so you could start out slow to
that<00:00:55.090> speed<00:00:56.489> set<00:00:57.489> a<00:00:57.520> higher<00:00:57.789> number<00:00:58.090> it<00:00:58.989> will

00:00:59.220 --> 00:00:59.230 
that speed set a higher number it will

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.619 
that speed set a higher number it will
increase<00:01:00.160> its<00:01:00.430> speed<00:01:00.520> quicker<00:01:01.030> to<00:01:01.510> your

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:01.629 
increase its speed quicker to your
