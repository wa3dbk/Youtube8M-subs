um if you're going for a marathon these
stages<00:02:14.870> don't<00:02:15.870> use<00:02:16.320> the<00:02:16.650> hint<00:02:16.920> monitors<00:02:17.400> that

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
stages don't use the hint monitors that

stages don't use the hint monitors that
often<00:02:18.180> you<00:02:18.300> can<00:02:18.450> use<00:02:18.630> a<00:02:18.959> heat<00:02:19.739> monitor<00:02:20.190> up<00:02:20.370> to

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
often you can use a heat monitor up to

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.130 
often you can use a heat monitor up to
okay<00:02:21.360> there<00:02:21.600> there's<00:02:22.350> the<00:02:22.530> last<00:02:22.739> one<00:02:23.390> um<00:02:24.390> you

times<00:02:26.880> per<00:02:27.270> emerald<00:02:27.690> and<00:02:27.900> I<00:02:30.140> believe<00:02:31.140> up<00:02:31.850> well

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
times per emerald and I believe up well

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.699 
times per emerald and I believe up well
I'm<00:02:33.000> not<00:02:33.150> really<00:02:33.390> sure<00:02:33.510> the<00:02:33.900> siege<00:02:34.140> is<00:02:34.320> really

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
I'm not really sure the siege is really

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:41.000 
I'm not really sure the siege is really
not<00:02:35.340> long<00:02:35.790> at<00:02:35.970> all<00:02:36.060> so<00:02:38.510> um<00:02:39.510> as<00:02:40.140> you<00:02:40.530> can<00:02:40.620> see<00:02:40.830> how

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
not long at all so um as you can see how

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.560 
not long at all so um as you can see how
small<00:02:41.549> the<00:02:41.730> stage<00:02:42.030> is<00:02:42.209> I'm<00:02:42.360> basically

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
small the stage is I'm basically

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.840 
small the stage is I'm basically
wandering<00:02:43.290> around<00:02:43.380> I'm<00:02:43.799> gonna<00:02:44.010> expect<00:02:44.610> to<00:02:44.730> get

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
wandering around I'm gonna expect to get

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:49.759 
wandering around I'm gonna expect to get
over<00:02:45.420> here<00:02:45.720> because<00:02:46.200> just<00:02:48.530> nature<00:02:49.530> of<00:02:49.650> the

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
over here because just nature of the

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:52.310 
over here because just nature of the
stages<00:02:50.400> the<00:02:51.090> nature<00:02:51.360> of<00:02:51.420> these<00:02:51.600> stages<00:02:51.900> don't

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
stages the nature of these stages don't

00:02:52.320 --> 00:03:04.979 
stages the nature of these stages don't
really<00:02:52.560> easy<00:02:52.680> to<00:02:52.890> get<00:02:52.980> going

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:09.369 

Archer<00:03:05.989> no<00:03:06.409> yes<00:03:07.360> I'm<00:03:08.360> pretty<00:03:08.750> sure<00:03:09.019> that<00:03:09.230> was<00:03:09.319> a

00:03:09.369 --> 00:03:09.379 
Archer no yes I'm pretty sure that was a

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:12.220 
Archer no yes I'm pretty sure that was a
perfect<00:03:09.860> right<00:03:10.040> there<00:03:10.069> which<00:03:10.519> is<00:03:10.909> worth<00:03:11.239> 2,000

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
perfect right there which is worth 2,000

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:13.809 
perfect right there which is worth 2,000
points<00:03:12.379> by<00:03:12.680> the<00:03:12.709> way<00:03:12.920> I'll<00:03:13.129> go<00:03:13.250> over<00:03:13.400> the<00:03:13.519> point

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:13.819 
points by the way I'll go over the point

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:14.979 
points by the way I'll go over the point
system<00:03:14.030> some<00:03:14.360> other<00:03:14.510> time

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
system some other time

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:17.229 
system some other time
and<00:03:15.470> I<00:03:15.590> believe<00:03:16.069> this<00:03:16.310> should<00:03:16.370> be<00:03:16.730> perfect<00:03:17.120> for

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
and I believe this should be perfect for

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:21.190 
and I believe this should be perfect for
a<00:03:17.329> name<00:03:17.480> rank<00:03:19.930> yep

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
a name rank yep

a name rank yep
generally<00:03:22.129> my<00:03:22.400> advice<00:03:22.730> for<00:03:23.000> these<00:03:23.150> stages<00:03:23.599> is

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:24.049 
generally my advice for these stages is

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:25.839 
generally my advice for these stages is
that<00:03:24.590> if<00:03:24.709> you're<00:03:24.859> currently<00:03:24.980> going<00:03:25.340> after<00:03:25.700> the

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:25.849 
that if you're currently going after the

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:31.119 
that if you're currently going after the
a<00:03:26.180> ranks<00:03:26.750> um<00:03:27.909> go<00:03:28.909> after<00:03:29.470> maybe<00:03:30.470> if<00:03:30.769> you're<00:03:30.950> not

00:03:31.119 --> 00:03:31.129 
a ranks um go after maybe if you're not

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:33.309 
a ranks um go after maybe if you're not
sure<00:03:31.459> if<00:03:31.670> it's<00:03:31.819> a<00:03:31.879> big<00:03:32.269> level<00:03:32.599> go<00:03:32.930> after<00:03:33.200> the

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:33.319 
sure if it's a big level go after the

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:35.259 
sure if it's a big level go after the
first<00:03:33.650> monitor<00:03:34.250> but<00:03:34.489> don't<00:03:34.639> go<00:03:34.790> after<00:03:35.090> any

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269
