00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.870
 I thought I 'll do some facts video 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.870
 but not for me but about both 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:14.940
 first something we all need to know 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.949
 be the books followed in 1962 in the 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.180
 brass fantasy 15 in which he his 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.500
 has been clarified 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.240
 boy was from a radioactive 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.160
 spider bitten use his power and 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.650
 which also probably be to come from coal 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.369
 uncle learned about it was super blah blah 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.810
 bla 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.820
 Everyone should now this 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.630
 know history and who is not constantly 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.160
 off in the corner 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.989
 his first not the green 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.410
 goblin renault if the mode of 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.469
 shocker 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.870
 no, the fox was simply a criminal 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.910
 who is just a criminal 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.460
 however, we got super first 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.039
 at least the chameleon pushed something 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.539
 of course I bring my net 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.710
 Schwinger was in his first issue 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.050
 not even there alone 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.910
 the fantastic four wants to and indeed 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.949
 since the beginning of his comic career 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.000
 probably that's why he became later 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.980
 then a member of the ff 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.899
 did you actually know the statement for 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.239
 first time from our spider through 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.880
 a vacuum cleaner was defeated with 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.860
 a vacuum cleaner stan lee the maker 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.540
 Spiderman was criticized first 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.490
 his colleague as he gives him the concept 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.630
 introduced and thought spin and 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.670
 teenagers do not arrive 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.860
 Fifty years later , the only one is her 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.540
 their 700 issue finally take them 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.540
 your crossover and special editions 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.860
 Uncle Ben had not said that 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.720
 is a pure myth and was made by 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.720
 hollywood set up at the end of the fair 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.970
 fantasy 15 storyline after uncle band 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.310
 By the way, peter dohm is running in the area 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:42.869
 around and practically the counter is there 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:44.910
 Brathwaite points out that the 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.070
 trilogy of sam raimi was banned 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:49.830
 the fact that peter spider web out 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.720
 a mere hand ok shoots it logically 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.780
 should be a spider but hard 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.590
 I must say that I can come more boiled 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.330
 he really needs it for that 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.950
 built nozzles need the cartridges 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.140
 least has the mailings at one 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.119
 At the beginning of 2012, this was correct for 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.979
 team ups is always so to have no matter 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.550
 example, the fantastic four became the 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.489
 avengers 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:10.410
 he was alright almost everywhere in there 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.270
 sounded a bit strange that parents were 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.760
 Shield's agents would have thought so 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.160
 or there were a lot of cartoons 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.720
 series movies with the man crawler but 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.519
 one of the hottest was the Japanese 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.140
 tv version of them in the had 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:23.970
 the mask schlitztaugen fought along 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.700
 congo and had like the power rangers 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:30.650
 a giant robot blossom is that 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.650
 please this Japanese 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.160
 no matter 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:39.230
 amazing spy at 1 583 spiderman page 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.670
 side barack obama struggled with it 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.590

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.560

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.570
 Chameleon defeated in the ultimate 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.950
 universe, the old one is both dead 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.750
 for explanation in addition to the normal 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.300
 universe there is still a parallel 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.220
 which was introduced in early 2000 to new 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.590

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.410
 years a comic and then betrayed 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:25.060

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.060

 Clown from the original and the clarification of 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.790
 they are ready for the original 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.709
 many fans have been in the 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.900
 90s excited about it and the authors 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:41.819
 have turned it so that peter 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.800
 again the original is the name grand 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:46.410

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.100

 identity in front of all new york around 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.440
 The authors turned it that way 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.760
 that all citizens are somehow forgotten 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.650
