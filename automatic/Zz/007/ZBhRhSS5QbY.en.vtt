00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
 Hello, this is an online shop master 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.859
 my name is Andrey 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.529
 I want to introduce this video to you 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.240
 novelty of our production chopper 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.330
 for dry grass hay and straw on 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.679
 the necessary fraction of the grinding fraction 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.870
 governed by these here 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.379
 nets, that is, they are bundled with two 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.410
 things 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:22.619
 1 bore diameter 45 mm 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:26.640
 grinding fraction will be 0 5 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:29.279
 2 centimeters mesh hole diameter 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.679
 there is a lot more that is there will be a fraction 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.620
 over one centimeter grass sharply 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.420
 It is suitable for crushing implied grass 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.090
 cancellations that is fractions you can 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:43.649
 adjust by yourself 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:45.329
 the fraction will be the same and fine mesh 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.719
 we are set there inside under 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.719
 visor 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.620
 the visor serves to 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.329
 chopping chopping hey the product is not 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.420
 scattered in different directions 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:01.109
 if necessary, you can fix 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.840
 bag visor shoot here paws top 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.380
 and the bottom one that is attached to her bag 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.640
 fixed with wire either 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:13.320
 gum and already whole grind hey 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:15.420
 the product falls into the grass stands abruptly 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.729
 we have on here such legs they have us 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.250
 from the corner here we are present 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.970
 stretch that is right sharply on them 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.970
 still 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.740
 Here is such a conical bunker on top 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.180
 diameter of the hole is pretty big 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:36.190
 grind her product will be convenient 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:38.409
 download here is such an automatic 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.710
 engine mounted engine goes 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:44.020
 new production of Ukraine 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.090
 single phase c 220 volt one and a half 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.950
 kilowatts at 3000 rpm as 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.470
 practice shows with these engines 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:54.640
 almost no problems 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:56.619
 quality is very good cover with us 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.360
 attached to the main body of the one with 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:01.149
 using these bolts here if you 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.200
 need access to the knives you unscrew here 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:04.899
 these bolts 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.590
 there are 4 of them on one side, two of the other 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:13.709
 removed the lid already you have access to 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:15.370
 knife knife goes 4 blade if you need 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:18.340
 replace mesh 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:25.709
 you unscrew this nut that is 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:25.709
 the visor is removed and the mesh changes 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.989
 performance data right cutting 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.459
 depends on which grid they are 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:34.420
 installed ie what is the diameter 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:37.570
 holes 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.549
 also from the grind of the product that is th 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:41.650
 a lot depends on the grass itself 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:43.450
 let's place this alfalfa then 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.959
 performance increases if 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:49.660
 it goes dry grass then falls a little 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:51.430
 average performance let's say there is 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.590
 here is a grid with 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.709
 we have a big hole diameter here 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:59.110
 somewhere there will be about 40 kilograms an hour if 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:59.739
 everything . that's the diameter of the hole 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.590
 slightly less 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:04.420
 grinding fraction will be finer 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.250
 performance drops to around 35 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.850
 kilogram 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:11.459
 grass sharply household in principle for 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:14.650
 small amounts of some 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:17.650
 irreplaceable assistant for you let's 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:20.430
 now I will turn it on you will listen as 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.430
 she works 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:36.430
 the right is pretty pretty quiet 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.430
 on legs stands steady 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.989
 using the machine you turn it on either 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:52.340
 turn it off very conveniently that is you 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:55.760
 stretched extension can turn on 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:57.269
 can turn off 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.420
 this unit 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:04.140
 You can purchase our website from us. 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:08.599
