00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:06.899
 hi all guys have been cool 4 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.679
 of the schumi ct team and this is the 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.809
 first video processing of the for 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:14.960
 then today we will process the app is in 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.699
 processing little push short run 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:22.470
 just as the group was immediately there 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:26.880
 thermal goes well from 90 and 105 is fine by 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:33.480
 all brands can see this is 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:38.250
 5 years 90 90 for bar 50 what do you do 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:42.480
 34 euros and is very convenient 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:45.710
 all here descent mino stack is obvious 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:51.350
 that 105 more turns now we move to 105 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:54.449
 verse is always 105 34 euros 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:57.390
 however uphill and obvious more goals 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.520
 because 105 is a beautiful 90 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:04.920
 difference 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:10.200
 then let's go to the tree it's original good 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:13.110
 the reports then hook this one here 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:19.650
 bell pressure crooked teeth you see 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:22.650
 which exploits order in of 167 f50 80 and 89 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:27.540
 that this would be better with 90 than 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:32.820
 on 105 because no one understands us less 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:37.520
 105 later there was like 90 then at the end 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:43.110
 its unusual that pulls of more 533 euros 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:46.759
 this is then the marches when well 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:50.159
 original paleo vice muffler 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:53.280
 provision badly released explosion of 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.710
 an unexpected 50 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:02:00.110
 also this 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:04.729
 very good similar of the polini are 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:06.590
 capolini ends here has not written 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:08.959
 long splinters then it is much better than the 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:12.160
 polini the next videos I will do as I will 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:17.480
 see how to process them in other ways 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:22.540
 50 euro is not very expensive by 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:27.010
 blow up the buoy way to say then 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:30.290
 the carburetor is good original is 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:33.790
 the original however is not good though 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:37.580
 some problem has it or of 19 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:43.970
 Hand ce que tu player but red 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:46.610
 it was very expensive for the ptp 19 euro 76 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:49.910
 nano skiing and love skiing is expensive 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:54.260
 always been expensive anyway 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:03:01.579
 the original ignition printed on 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:03.350
 250 to 300 performance to one off 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:05.989
 trample the original in all fields 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:07.940
 usually plain resumed descent of 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:11.840
 more processing without having to 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:16.549
 open card and make 55 without the 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:20.239
 report would be this win 18 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:23.450
 where did you go wrong here to do 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:27.140
 some change opinion from 18 without al 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:30.980
 pinion you will make me 50 here in the forklift i 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:34.010
 our chef who makes you in 40 45 e 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.780
 I recommend this elaboration well 6 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:40.250
 he works if he can run short is 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:44.500
 over and the next video will be like 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:47.329
 work out the penalty in other ways 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.690
 good bye guys and the next video 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:49.690
