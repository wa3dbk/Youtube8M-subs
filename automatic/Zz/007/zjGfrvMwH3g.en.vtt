point Mary o daus is still in control of

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.430 
point Mary o daus is still in control of
herself<00:00:57.510> it<00:00:57.780> doesn't<00:00:58.020> seem<00:00:58.170> like<00:00:58.320> he's

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
herself it doesn't seem like he's

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.319 
herself it doesn't seem like he's
actually<00:00:58.649> lost<00:00:59.399> control<00:00:59.670> of<00:00:59.820> himself<00:00:59.940> like<00:01:00.180> he

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
actually lost control of himself like he

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.610 
actually lost control of himself like he
did<00:01:00.449> last<00:01:00.480> time<00:01:00.899> you<00:01:01.020> went<00:01:01.140> into<00:01:01.170> this<00:01:01.350> mode

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
did last time you went into this mode

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.260 
did last time you went into this mode
but<00:01:02.039> it<00:01:02.129> still<00:01:02.309> seems<00:01:02.579> like<00:01:02.670> he<00:01:02.910> most<00:01:03.149> likely

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
but it still seems like he most likely

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.880 
but it still seems like he most likely
could<00:01:03.600> lose<00:01:03.809> control<00:01:03.960> depending<00:01:04.439> on<00:01:04.530> how<00:01:04.680> far

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
could lose control depending on how far

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.010 
could lose control depending on how far
he<00:01:04.949> goes<00:01:05.280> into<00:01:05.610> it<00:01:05.880> either<00:01:06.299> way

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
he goes into it either way

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.929 
he goes into it either way
this<00:01:07.260> chapter<00:01:07.799> I<00:01:07.830> like<00:01:08.220> it<00:01:08.400> really<00:01:08.610> just<00:01:08.760> goes

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
this chapter I like it really just goes

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.670

at hendrickson fight King arfer

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.210 
at hendrickson fight King arfer
which<00:01:15.960> it<00:01:16.110> seems<00:01:16.290> like<00:01:16.439> Hendrickson<00:01:16.979> in<00:01:17.100> this

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
which it seems like Hendrickson in this

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.640 
which it seems like Hendrickson in this
chapter<00:01:17.640> has<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:18.030> upper<00:01:18.360> hand<00:01:18.600> on<00:01:18.840> our<00:01:19.380> furred

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:20.690 
chapter has the upper hand on our furred
for<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:19.920> reason<00:01:20.189> why<00:01:20.280> is<00:01:20.340> because<00:01:20.520> when

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
for the reason why is because when

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.550 
for the reason why is because when
Hendrickson<00:01:21.240> uses<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.659> black<00:01:21.840> flame<00:01:22.140> on<00:01:22.380> our

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
Hendrickson uses the black flame on our

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.440 
Hendrickson uses the black flame on our
four<00:01:22.740> knees<00:01:22.860> burning<00:01:23.280> he<00:01:23.549> says<00:01:23.850> he<00:01:24.030> can't<00:01:24.270> put

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
four knees burning he says he can't put

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
really don't know there's been a lot of

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.240 
really don't know there's been a lot of
speculation<00:01:45.600> most<00:01:46.110> likely<00:01:46.380> its<00:01:46.470> Merlin<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:47.159> I

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
speculation most likely its Merlin and I

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.160 
speculation most likely its Merlin and I
really<00:01:47.490> have<00:01:47.610> no<00:01:47.759> clue<00:01:47.970> who<00:01:48.509> that<00:01:48.540> person<00:01:48.720> most

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
likely could be either way we could see

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.389 
likely could be either way we could see
definitely<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.810> mage<00:01:52.110> behind<00:01:52.680> King<00:01:52.920> Arthur

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
is definitely stronger than when you

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.080 
is definitely stronger than when you
were<00:01:54.899> let<00:01:55.110> on<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.470> believe<00:01:55.770> we<00:01:56.280> also<00:01:56.490> see<00:01:56.939> in

all the questions and answers he wants

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.940 
all the questions and answers he wants
most<00:02:32.330> likely<00:02:32.810> once<00:02:33.140> he<00:02:33.230> finds<00:02:33.440> out<00:02:33.590> the<00:02:33.650> true

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
most likely once he finds out the true

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.230 
most likely once he finds out the true
beef<00:02:34.160> of<00:02:34.310> what's<00:02:34.490> going<00:02:34.670> on<00:02:34.850> with<00:02:35.030> the<00:02:35.090> holy

Knights and this other faction holy
knots<00:02:37.100> most<00:02:37.730> likely<00:02:38.090> he's<00:02:38.240> gonna<00:02:38.420> turn<00:02:38.690> over

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020
