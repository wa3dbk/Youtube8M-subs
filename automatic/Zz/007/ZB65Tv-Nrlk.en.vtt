00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
wasn't really a big enough upgrade from

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.670 
wasn't really a big enough upgrade from
that<00:02:34.040> atrix<00:02:34.490> one<00:02:34.730> but<00:02:35.150> look<00:02:35.840> at<00:02:36.020> to<00:02:36.200> disagree

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
that atrix one but look at to disagree

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.530

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:42.369 
and I think that but the price point to
is<00:02:40.790> 99<00:02:41.329> it's<00:02:41.780> going<00:02:41.900> to<00:02:41.930> be<00:02:42.019> ninety<00:02:42.260> nine
