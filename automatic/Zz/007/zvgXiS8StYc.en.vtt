new<00:00:01.260> videos<00:00:01.740> every<00:00:02.490> day

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:11.059 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:13.430 

but<00:00:12.059> basically<00:00:12.210> the<00:00:12.629> whole<00:00:12.750> idea<00:00:12.959> about

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
but basically the whole idea about

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.960 
but basically the whole idea about
making<00:00:14.660> quality<00:00:15.660> proteins<00:00:16.470> is<00:00:16.970> cooking

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
making quality proteins is cooking

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.420 
making quality proteins is cooking
things<00:00:18.210> low<00:00:18.660> and<00:00:19.140> slow<00:00:19.380> cooking<00:00:20.009> things<00:00:20.220> at<00:00:20.400> a

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
things low and slow cooking things at a

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.630 
things low and slow cooking things at a
low<00:00:20.700> temperature<00:00:20.779> keeping<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:21.900> meat<00:00:22.079> tender

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:22.640 
low temperature keeping the meat tender

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.210 
low temperature keeping the meat tender
if<00:00:23.640> you<00:00:23.789> cook<00:00:24.029> meats<00:00:24.360> or<00:00:24.990> fish<00:00:25.320> it<00:00:25.619> too<00:00:25.800> high<00:00:26.070> of

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
if you cook meats or fish it too high of

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.999 
if you cook meats or fish it too high of
a<00:00:26.310> heat<00:00:26.610> then<00:00:27.419> the<00:00:27.599> protein<00:00:28.050> can<00:00:28.349> be<00:00:28.500> denatured

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:29.009 
a heat then the protein can be denatured

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:31.760 
a heat then the protein can be denatured
be<00:00:29.730> hard<00:00:30.029> to<00:00:30.149> digest<00:00:30.329> so<00:00:31.230> you<00:00:31.290> always<00:00:31.410> want<00:00:31.710> to

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:31.770 
be hard to digest so you always want to

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.880 
be hard to digest so you always want to
cook<00:00:31.919> babies<00:00:32.309> at<00:00:32.669> a<00:00:32.730> lower<00:00:33.090> heat<00:00:33.590> that<00:00:34.590> doesn't

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
cook babies at a lower heat that doesn't

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.799 
cook babies at a lower heat that doesn't
mean<00:00:35.040> you<00:00:35.460> don't<00:00:35.610> ever<00:00:35.910> use<00:00:36.149> higher<00:00:36.450> heat

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
mean you don't ever use higher heat

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.410 
mean you don't ever use higher heat
sometimes<00:00:37.440> higher<00:00:37.739> heats<00:00:38.040> you<00:00:38.940> use<00:00:39.149> higher

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
sometimes higher heats you use higher

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.290 
sometimes higher heats you use higher
heat<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:39.960> sear<00:00:40.590> to<00:00:41.280> see<00:00:41.520> your<00:00:41.610> seal<00:00:42.120> in<00:00:42.270> the

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
heat to sear to see your seal in the

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.010 
heat to sear to see your seal in the
flavor<00:00:43.460> and<00:00:44.460> to<00:00:45.450> you<00:00:46.440> know<00:00:46.560> put<00:00:46.860> a<00:00:46.890> crust<00:00:47.550> on

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
but basically the bulk of your cooking

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.030 
but basically the bulk of your cooking
you<00:00:54.000> want<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:54.239> cook<00:00:54.390> at<00:00:54.600> low<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.410> slow<00:00:55.560> heats

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:56.040 
you want to cook at low and slow heats

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.069 
you want to cook at low and slow heats
to<00:00:56.340> keep<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.670> good<00:00:56.970> oils<00:00:57.360> and<00:00:57.570> talked<00:00:57.810> and

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
to keep the good oils and talked and

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.490 
to keep the good oils and talked and
keep<00:00:58.380> the<00:00:58.530> protein<00:00:58.980> intact<00:00:59.880> as<00:01:00.090> well<00:01:00.500> your

natural the way animals are supposed to

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.749 
natural the way animals are supposed to
be<00:01:12.450> raised<00:01:12.689> but<00:01:13.500> you're<00:01:13.710> getting<00:01:13.829> more<00:01:14.189> a<00:01:14.250> new

more vitamin D live more vitamin D and
the<00:01:31.140> fat<00:01:31.380> very<00:01:31.979> important<00:01:32.580> most<00:01:33.450> of<00:01:33.659> our<00:01:33.780> meat

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
the fat very important most of our meat

these<00:01:34.619> days<00:01:34.830> does<00:01:35.040> not<00:01:35.220> have<00:01:35.400> enough<00:01:35.640> vitamin

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
these days does not have enough vitamin

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:42.289 
these days does not have enough vitamin
D<00:01:36.470> and<00:01:38.869> we<00:01:39.869> get<00:01:40.080> when<00:01:40.369> animals<00:01:41.369> are<00:01:41.490> grazing<00:01:41.880> on

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
D and we get when animals are grazing on

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.590 
D and we get when animals are grazing on
grasses<00:01:43.130> they're<00:01:44.130> also<00:01:44.340> getting<00:01:45.119> lots<00:01:45.479> of

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
grasses they're also getting lots of

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.350 
grasses they're also getting lots of
amino<00:01:45.960> acids<00:01:46.500> so<00:01:47.159> that<00:01:47.310> makes<00:01:47.549> their<00:01:47.880> meat

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
amino acids so that makes their meat

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.000 
amino acids so that makes their meat
rich<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:48.840> tryptophan<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:49.590> other<00:01:49.710> other

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.010 
rich and tryptophan and other other

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.950 
rich and tryptophan and other other
amino<00:01:50.400> acids<00:01:50.939> which<00:01:51.420> boosts<00:01:51.900> serotonin<00:01:52.310> and

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
amino acids which boosts serotonin and

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.690 
amino acids which boosts serotonin and
other<00:01:54.960> neurotransmitters<00:01:55.439> which<00:01:56.040> make<00:01:56.520> you

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
other neurotransmitters which make you

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.960 
other neurotransmitters which make you
feel<00:01:57.030> good<00:01:57.420> healthy<00:01:58.290> happy<00:01:58.770> relaxed<00:01:59.700> calm

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
feel good healthy happy relaxed calm

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.310 
feel good healthy happy relaxed calm
confident<00:02:01.759> so<00:02:02.759> you<00:02:02.930> don't<00:02:03.930> need

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
confident so you don't need

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.029 
confident so you don't need
antidepressants<00:02:05.130> or<00:02:05.909> other<00:02:06.420> drugs<00:02:07.140> basically

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
antidepressants or other drugs basically

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.720 
antidepressants or other drugs basically
so<00:02:09.470> what<00:02:10.470> happens<00:02:10.769> when<00:02:10.950> we<00:02:11.069> don't<00:02:11.280> eat<00:02:11.549> that

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
so what happens when we don't eat that

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.610 
so what happens when we don't eat that
kind<00:02:11.879> of<00:02:12.000> food<00:02:12.239> if<00:02:12.420> we<00:02:12.510> eat<00:02:12.689> factory<00:02:13.349> farm

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
kind of food if we eat factory farm

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.600 
kind of food if we eat factory farm
raised<00:02:13.890> meat<00:02:15.409> which<00:02:16.409> is<00:02:16.650> most<00:02:17.129> of<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:17.370> meat

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
raised meat which is most of the meat

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.360 
raised meat which is most of the meat
