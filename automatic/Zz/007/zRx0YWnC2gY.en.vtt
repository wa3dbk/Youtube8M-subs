00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.800
 where is this myth going 

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.600
 where to gas station all we will be there 

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.320
 discuss bought a car and here is how 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.170
 believes that thrifty motorists that 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:16.630
 will tell generous on good advice and 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.630
 million program in an instant 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:27.460
 finally friends in the world is nothing again 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:28.960
 what happens 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.919
 makes us happy Russians and does not scare some 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:32.860
 in the West 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.210
 oil prices again slowly crawled 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:36.880
 up 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.960
 and what does it mean azat that gasoline is necessary 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.220
 save it will soon begin to rise again 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.930
 You can certainly buy less voracious 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:46.640
 car but this is also a big financial 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:47.520
 expenses 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.880
 it is clear that AvtoVAZ save gas so 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.680
 so as not to resort to this here 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.260
 radical family type 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.260
 my cars 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.539
 car of course man's friend 

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:07.299
 but sometimes this friendship costs us too much 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:10.619
 Expensive 1 gasoline which are worth 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.430
 change to dog sled 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.750
 There are many ways to reduce 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.420
 fuel consumption 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.930
 but are they all bogus 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:21.660
 program gallego decided to hold 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.020
 own yes I am healthy 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.190
 best place for him in the race track 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.250
 if certainly not some traffic jams 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.830
 50 kilometers distance 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.940
 the first 20 cars will go low 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.130
 the next 30 revolutions at full throttle 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.360
 let's see how much fuel our ate 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.360
 steel horse to upgrade 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.490
 to have something to compare 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.120
 results following races 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.110
 almost 6 liters 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.630
 in fifth place ranking galileo here 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.510
 is an aluminum ring 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:58.730
 Is this housing and Oscar capable of something 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:59.850
 to change 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.100
 ring maker assures that 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.299
 located on them the blades of years serves 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:06.400
 to lighten coming in 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.840
 air engine 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.539
 fuel burns better which saves up 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.369
 twenty percent gasoline 

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:15.899
 on such a thing you can cut yourself 

00:02:15.899 --> 00:02:18.299
 from simple and aluminum cans not 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:20.769
 install the item just five minutes and 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:23.469
 ready 

00:02:23.469 --> 00:02:25.039
 Vanuatu machine cuts 

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:27.439
 rubles on the race track exactly 

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:30.529
 repeats turns check 

00:02:30.529 --> 00:02:33.769
 the driver did not feel any twists 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:36.909
 and what will show on the fuel meter 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:39.449
 2 and 6 percent of the benefits 

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:42.749
 A bit though if ride from Moscow 

00:02:42.749 --> 00:02:45.039
 and Petersburg saved money 

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:48.039
 enough for a big bag of chips 

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:51.259
 ranked fourth 

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:52.739
 magnets 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.290
 here will not help save 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.340
 Hotin Fridge Access Possible 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.189
 hang up 

00:02:57.189 --> 00:02:58.819
 all good 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:00.109
 installation of these devices 

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:02.269
 a little harder 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:04.899
 the car has to be lifted 

00:03:04.899 --> 00:03:06.949
 but the manufacturer promises to reduce 

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:09.499
 costs by as much as a quarter 

00:03:09.499 --> 00:03:12.029
 March 1, do not intervene on the fuel hose 

00:03:12.029 --> 00:03:14.919
 his main thing is not to press 

00:03:14.919 --> 00:03:16.839
 the savings will be big but only 

00:03:16.839 --> 00:03:19.329
 because the car is unlikely to go 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:20.889
 the other is set to 

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:22.599
 air overboard 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:23.980
 according to the manufacturers 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.919
 the system works like this 

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:28.599
 magnetic fields acting on the streams 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:31.149
 air and fuel streamline 

00:03:31.149 --> 00:03:32.729
 molecular motion 

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:34.909
 near it mixes better with 

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:37.909
 with oxygen if it burns more actively 

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:41.099
 of course if you go to the red blood 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:44.149
 squash profit can be more than 

00:03:44.149 --> 00:03:45.199
 gasoline 

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:46.720
 but the task is Galileo 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.900
 find such a way to save 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.349
 not to change the usual way of life 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:53.499
 I have to get out 

00:03:53.499 --> 00:03:56.319
 magnets everyones use 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:59.019
 it seems and here we were already no it is not 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:00.129
 held 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:03.179
 just our drivers drive in circles 

00:04:03.179 --> 00:04:06.179
 how much saved magnetic fields 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:09.540
 2 and 8 percent 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.390
 Dear this crawl under the car need not 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.629
 only the top three management 

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:18.049
 reveals revere cornflower 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:20.829
 foot massage and nothing to do with it 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:22.750
 the fact is that the bass is sometimes better 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.879
 feels further 

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:28.029
 and the driver more accurately gives the legs not 

00:04:28.029 --> 00:04:30.379
 accidentally car thief shoes 

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:32.050
 on a thin sole 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.280
 it is not known how much you can 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:35.639
 save gasoline 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:38.199
 but at least the way is completely 

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:39.219
 is free 

00:04:39.219 --> 00:04:41.930
 also on shoes with economy 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.820
 about almost 7 percent benefit can even 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.860
 standing explains something else 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:49.560
 at 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.220
 silver medalist of our rating 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.669
 tire pressure monitoring system 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:55.999
 loud name 

00:04:55.999 --> 00:04:58.310
 although these are just caps 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:01.110
 who screw on the valve chamber 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:02.939
 such a device driver can 

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:04.830
 install and self 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:06.719
 construction of drives and 

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:09.569
 it works very simply cap green 

00:05:09.569 --> 00:05:11.939
 pressure normal red appeared 

00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:12.919
 strip 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:14.879
 need to pump 

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:16.800
 would still be convenient 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.910
 but where are their actions fuel economy after all 

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:22.789
 we are interested in precisely this 

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:25.389
 let them air and try to drive at 

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:27.879
 us here their tires 

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:30.149
 let's see how much careless people lose 

00:05:30.149 --> 00:05:30.870
 drivers 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:34.099
 in which even the wheels do not pump up 

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:36.789
 But it seems to have found such a save and 

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:39.080
 now worries the least 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.060
 with the same intend to keep the car 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:44.400
 on the road was not easy 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.199
 even professionals 

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:47.979
 so for safety and 

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:50.389
 caps device useful 

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:53.229
 but do they affect gas mileage 

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:54.139
 if you have 

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:55.830
 even gas stations 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:57.650
 Is it time to ask for a discount? 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:59.320
 by the way this is also a good way 

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:01.180
 save on fuel 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:03.850
 gasoline out 6 percent more 

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:06.590
 it is easy to calculate that if you go to court and 

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:09.330
 vast barefoot fuel consumption is not 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:12.080
 change but weak winner a 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.460
 energy saving today 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:15.649
 cars 

00:06:15.649 --> 00:06:18.849
 for this you are not some kind of magnetics thing 

00:06:18.849 --> 00:06:21.959
 serious here it is logical to expect substantial 

00:06:21.959 --> 00:06:24.739
 benefits even if replacing all four 

00:06:24.739 --> 00:06:26.099
 wheels won't help 

00:06:26.099 --> 00:06:29.279
 will only change the car for 

00:06:29.279 --> 00:06:31.029
 account of what savings are achieved 

00:06:31.029 --> 00:06:33.969
 these tires have lower resistance 

00:06:33.969 --> 00:06:38.879
 rolling saying is easier they roll easier or 

00:06:38.879 --> 00:06:41.069
 what is most important not to the detriment of security 

00:06:41.069 --> 00:06:44.689
 the braking distance about them is even smaller than that of 

00:06:44.689 --> 00:06:47.349
 ordinary 

00:06:47.349 --> 00:06:49.639
 taking into account the control of our 

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:52.710
 test the same 300 kilometers 

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:55.339
 almost trace of formula 1 

00:06:55.339 --> 00:06:58.330
 with six more runs on pit stop 

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:00.439
 only hardly Schumacher had 

00:07:00.439 --> 00:07:03.439
 ride trivia but what is the result 

00:07:04.339 --> 00:07:06.729
 twelve and a half percent 

00:07:06.729 --> 00:07:08.249
 this is serious 

00:07:08.249 --> 00:07:10.769
 sorry these tires will pay off only after 

00:07:10.769 --> 00:07:13.509
 forty thousand kilometers 

00:07:13.509 --> 00:07:16.569
 that article is equal to her for it bator 

00:07:16.569 --> 00:07:19.659
 if you believe advertising setting all of these 

00:07:19.659 --> 00:07:22.199
 gadgets will cause the car 

00:07:22.199 --> 00:07:24.580
 will be able to drive without gasoline 

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:27.229
 and then he will start to produce it on 

00:07:27.229 --> 00:07:29.610
 the experiment showed the only way 

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:33.080
 blowing and reduce fuel consumption if 

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:35.900
 there are two times less such arithmetic
