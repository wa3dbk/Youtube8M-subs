00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.120
 in this 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:12.080
 first 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:15.170
 This is not a show that is worth 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.000
 penalty first and second there goes what 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.850
 what am I going to comment 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.500
 I've seen very good fighters for 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:25.550
 example 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:29.200
 the east group of three fighters who 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:33.310
 they call the shield in English 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.310
 for the summer 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:39.619
 because it was not money if you do not sleep 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.720
 here all for my problems but it 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:46.050
 sleep here and I do not care 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:50.440
 [Laughs] 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:51.630
 in a vocal group by my person so 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:57.880
 can see 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:02:01.469
 imagine that the grain of the grain is something 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:03.440
 good because they do not join him at the end 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:07.910

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:11.940
 to this king bach and where takers against 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:17.140
 the three kisses and if in punk 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:21.690
 and why do not you ask him questions 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.690
 formal because it does not matter 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.700
 a little bit you already know that they take us out 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:32.230
 you get a little bit out of the comfort zone 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:33.970
 to football but I would like very much 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.010
 taking advantage of what was the first call 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.840
 of the day if you do not want to put the 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:46.200
 question of the day who villamelones 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:46.200

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:52.470
 [Music] 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:55.950
 the question is 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:03:01.980
 if the group where the shield is that 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:04.950
