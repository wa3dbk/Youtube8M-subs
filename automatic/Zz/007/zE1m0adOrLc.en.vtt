00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.150
 hello to all and welcome this new 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:14.660
 episode of the dofus book series in his 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.520
 inventory 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.550
 today we are attacking the forge 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.990
 exotic magic little known and we will 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:25.130
 start in made by kraft is a 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:27.020
 archetype so hop kraft and the little one and 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:30.380
 cheap and kind that I already have but as 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.820
 I exodus forcedly kind does never 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.850
 used a theme that you already have fm 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:38.600
 to do an exo it would be lose 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:41.660
 stupidly an item that is pretty so here 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:44.390
 the teepees and kraft is ok very well so 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:48.170
 especially at wind of exoticism a weapon he 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:51.530
 must put it in the element that you 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:57.469
 so want an archetype that was 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:01:00.320
 done at 50% of the element so either to the self 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:02.719
 r it depends a cape to our meadows of the 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.860
 combines and shouts to the secular chrono so 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:07.310
 I'm going to make it look not what 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:09.520
 I would have more are secular and for 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.420
 for the exodus it is better to have the 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.540
 the equipment you use the most 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.220
 its logical enough part 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:20.420
 so we will use a size 2 dark 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.770
 magic and we will recruit a hardcore 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.970
 I hope it will pass quickly enough 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.920
 about I do not want to do in 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:29.080
 do 50 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:30.460
 so here we put this guy there and the potions 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.550
 and the orange streets hope that the 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:37.690
 potions will pass like that I could 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:41.680
 directly do the fm behind up 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:43.230
 accepts the types the potions and have 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.700
 taken at the bottom it's magic 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:47.950
 so I guess the smaller ones 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:51.580
 easier passes the big ones 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.140
 waves I hope finally that's all is 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.450
 nickel 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.730
 yapluka fm the arc so at the level of g that 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.810
 I want then already forged at the start 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:00.610
 banks because I forgot the streets 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.290
 an invocation so I want a 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.890
 archetype invocations so that risk of 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.260
 problematic 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.210
 so this is an exo that is not hard to 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.190
 do it and not expensive after that remains a 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.630
 luck on a hundred but when you spend 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.310
 a ruin is that 32 and then who gets 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:16.900
 go with the new name good it will not be 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:21.820
 pretty quickly normally so the g that I 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:24.520
 want 150 wines 240 vita min 45 stats 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:28.380
 d2 or 48 of intel it is possible 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:31.510
 minimum wisdom to 38 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:34.989
 the po both will not change strictly 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:37.360
 nothing to fuck the care I think I 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:38.620
 I'll leave something like this 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.700
 because it's not very difficult and 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.709
 that it's better to make wells 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.989
 but I would not have fun putting them to 10 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.250
 these are who on a stand at the archetype 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:48.160
 born 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:51.160
 that you make a throw to milou 1003 that 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.770
 will not change much so for a 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.600
 exodus game not maximized care the tp 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:58.390
 I do not care lafita max pm withdrawal I 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.070
 I do not care and the % I leave them 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.000
 obviously 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:04.209
 so I think the times are going 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.150
 follow each other quickly enough so we go 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:08.230
 start 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.980
 I show you the first time 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:13.930
 attempt the first mount little power 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.000
 closely how do I go out and then 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:20.830
 then I will show you that the attempt 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.930
 who succeeds or almost notice that you 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:24.300
 do not need rap to do 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:29.739
 items that goes up to 50 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:32.459
 frankly there's no need for it to 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:32.459
 point of being behind 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:40.110
 here 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.110
 their opinions and have a direct attempt 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:48.020
 the renamo so that's it jumps and then 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:50.650
 too much mounting disassembly reassembly count 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.650
 until it passes 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:15.150
 and here is a small and typical 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.229
 I am deg because I was doing 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.889
 the ovary quickly assure everything was me 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:22.949
 started good 12 tried a calf that's 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:25.530
 pity I tried on 1,300 fast at all 

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:29.039
 on time it has not happened but the 242 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:35.330
 quickly to 49.1 tel 39 wisdom 1 p o 5 be 

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:35.330
 5 8 10% rest and repeat it's nickel 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:41.250
 but here are twelve one if all the sewers of 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.900
 the series could pass like this 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:47.940
 would be pretty cool I think you in 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:50.580
 do you think all this advice there go we get 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:52.380
 found for we find ourselves later 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.710
 for the next episode pardon ciao 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.710
 everybody
