collection<00:00:09.780> I'm<00:00:10.500> showing<00:00:11.400> how<00:00:11.490> to<00:00:11.550> do<00:00:11.700> it<00:00:11.790> on

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
collection I'm showing how to do it on

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.669 
collection I'm showing how to do it on
pillar<00:00:12.150> of<00:00:12.330> autumn<00:00:12.450> and<00:00:12.840> right<00:00:13.139> here<00:00:13.410> rather

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
pillar of autumn and right here rather

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.890 
pillar of autumn and right here rather
than<00:00:13.889> jumping<00:00:14.340> over<00:00:14.610> these<00:00:14.759> pipes<00:00:15.120> if<00:00:15.719> you

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
than jumping over these pipes if you

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.900 
than jumping over these pipes if you
just<00:00:16.109> crouch<00:00:16.440> up<00:00:16.680> against<00:00:17.130> this<00:00:17.279> railing<00:00:17.609> on

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
just crouch up against this railing on

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.519 
just crouch up against this railing on
the<00:00:18.060> side<00:00:18.330> and<00:00:18.690> keep<00:00:18.960> turning<00:00:19.410> around

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
the side and keep turning around

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.590 
the side and keep turning around
eventually<00:00:20.400> it<00:00:20.520> will<00:00:20.609> push<00:00:20.910> you<00:00:21.150> over<00:00:21.570> the

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
eventually it will push you over the

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.410 
eventually it will push you over the
pipes<00:00:21.930> and<00:00:22.289> you<00:00:22.830> don't<00:00:23.100> have<00:00:23.279> to<00:00:23.490> jump<00:00:23.760> this<00:00:24.359> is

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
pipes and you don't have to jump this is

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.880 
pipes and you don't have to jump this is
the<00:00:24.600> misunderstanding<00:00:25.529> for<00:00:25.680> why<00:00:25.859> people

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
the misunderstanding for why people

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.859 
the misunderstanding for why people
don't<00:00:26.550> think<00:00:26.609> that<00:00:26.970> you<00:00:27.060> can<00:00:27.269> do<00:00:27.449> it<00:00:27.570> on<00:00:27.660> this

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
don't think that you can do it on this

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.320 
don't think that you can do it on this
level<00:00:28.109> it<00:00:28.380> may<00:00:28.529> look<00:00:28.830> like<00:00:29.010> I'm<00:00:29.250> jumping<00:00:29.490> but

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
level it may look like I'm jumping but

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.849 
level it may look like I'm jumping but
I'm<00:00:30.449> actually<00:00:30.689> just<00:00:31.080> pushing<00:00:31.439> against<00:00:31.800> the

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
I'm actually just pushing against the

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.470 
I'm actually just pushing against the
pipes<00:00:32.160> and<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.489> railing<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:32.969> as<00:00:33.120> you<00:00:33.270> can<00:00:33.420> see

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
pipes and the railing and as you can see

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.040 
pipes and the railing and as you can see
it<00:00:34.260> pushed<00:00:34.530> me<00:00:34.710> right<00:00:34.950> over<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.370> pipes<00:00:35.610> so

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.050 
it pushed me right over the pipes so

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.510 
it pushed me right over the pipes so
there's<00:00:37.050> only<00:00:37.170> two<00:00:37.469> places<00:00:37.649> in<00:00:37.950> this<00:00:38.219> level

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
there's only two places in this level

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.740 
there's only two places in this level
that<00:00:38.610> people<00:00:38.760> think<00:00:39.090> you<00:00:39.239> have<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.510> jump

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
that people think you have to jump

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.330 
that people think you have to jump
that's<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.290> first<00:00:40.530> one<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:40.920> other<00:00:41.040> one<00:00:41.219> is

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
that's the first one the other one is

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.760 
that's the first one the other one is
near<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.700> end<00:00:41.879> but<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.870> one<00:00:43.020> at<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.200> end<00:00:43.290> you

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
near the end but the one at the end you

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.490 
near the end but the one at the end you
can<00:00:43.920> actually<00:00:44.129> take<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:44.969> back<00:00:45.270> way<00:00:45.570> around<00:00:46.140> the

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
can actually take a back way around the

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.380 
can actually take a back way around the
barrier<00:00:46.739> so<00:00:46.920> you<00:00:47.219> don't<00:00:47.460> have<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.820> jump<00:00:48.030> over

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
barrier so you don't have to jump over

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.540 
barrier so you don't have to jump over
the<00:00:48.480> barrier<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:49.020> there<00:00:49.890> you<00:00:50.010> have<00:00:50.039> it<00:00:50.219> those

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
the barrier and there you have it those

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.160 
the barrier and there you have it those
are<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.820> two<00:00:51.000> places<00:00:51.210> in<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.660> level<00:00:51.989> people

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
are the two places in the level people

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.310 
are the two places in the level people
think<00:00:52.530> you<00:00:52.649> have<00:00:52.829> to<00:00:52.949> jump<00:00:53.190> but<00:00:53.399> you<00:00:53.520> don't<00:00:53.760> and

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.320 
think you have to jump but you don't and

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.360 
think you have to jump but you don't and
seeing<00:00:55.320> us<00:00:55.500> how<00:00:55.680> this<00:00:55.890> level<00:00:56.250> is

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
seeing us how this level is

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.250 
seeing us how this level is
significantly<00:00:57.120> shorter<00:00:57.629> than<00:00:57.660> any<00:00:57.960> of<00:00:58.140> the

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
significantly shorter than any of the

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.410 
significantly shorter than any of the
others<00:00:58.559> it<00:00:59.129> makes<00:00:59.460> sense<00:00:59.730> to<00:00:59.969> go<00:01:00.090> ahead<00:01:00.120> and

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
others it makes sense to go ahead and

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.119 
others it makes sense to go ahead and
knock<00:01:00.570> this<00:01:00.809> achievement<00:01:01.170> out<00:01:01.440> on<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.920> pillar

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
knock this achievement out on the pillar

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.899 
knock this achievement out on the pillar
of<00:01:02.309> autumn<00:01:02.460> rather<00:01:03.390> than<00:01:03.629> having<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:04.080> do<00:01:04.909> no

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
of autumn rather than having to do no

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.539 
of autumn rather than having to do no
jumps<00:01:06.390> on<00:01:06.630> one<00:01:06.900> of<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.110> longer<00:01:07.500> levels<00:01:07.830> I'm

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
jumps on one of the longer levels I'm

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.330 
jumps on one of the longer levels I'm
gonna<00:01:09.240> go<00:01:09.420> ahead<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:09.659> run<00:01:09.930> this<00:01:10.080> video<00:01:10.290> at<00:01:10.680> 1.5

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
gonna go ahead and run this video at 1.5

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.370 
gonna go ahead and run this video at 1.5
times<00:01:11.700> normal<00:01:12.119> speed<00:01:12.299> so<00:01:12.510> you<00:01:12.869> can<00:01:13.049> see<00:01:13.260> the

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
times normal speed so you can see the

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.780 
times normal speed so you can see the
rest<00:01:13.590> of<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.860> routes<00:01:14.070> through<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.400> level

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
rest of the routes through the level

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.760 
rest of the routes through the level
although<00:01:15.630> I<00:01:15.780> don't<00:01:16.049> think<00:01:16.229> it's<00:01:16.380> entirely

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
although I don't think it's entirely

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.560 
although I don't think it's entirely
necessary<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:17.880> then<00:01:18.030> I'll<00:01:18.119> slow<00:01:18.390> it<00:01:18.420> down

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
necessary and then I'll slow it down

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.289 
necessary and then I'll slow it down
again<00:01:19.110> at<00:01:19.470> that<00:01:19.860> barrier<00:01:20.670> at<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.030> end<00:01:21.150> of<00:01:21.240> the

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
again at that barrier at the end of the

00:01:21.299 --> 00:03:00.979 
again at that barrier at the end of the
level<00:01:21.479> that<00:01:21.630> I<00:01:21.689> was<00:01:21.869> referring<00:01:22.200> to

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:03.059 

how<00:03:01.989> can<00:03:02.140> you<00:03:02.200> the<00:03:02.319> ship<00:03:02.470> sneaking<00:03:02.739> out<00:03:02.860> that

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:03.069 
how can you the ship sneaking out that

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:04.440 
how can you the ship sneaking out that
phrase<00:03:03.250> further<00:03:03.700> than<00:03:03.819> that<00:03:03.849> point<00:03:04.120> we<00:03:04.269> needed

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
phrase further than that point we needed

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:17.130 
phrase further than that point we needed
really<00:03:15.510> the<00:03:16.510> talking<00:03:16.780> target<00:03:16.989> movement

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
really the talking target movement

00:03:17.140 --> 00:04:02.460 
really the talking target movement
outside<00:03:17.440> access<00:03:17.799> right

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:03.990 

you

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
you

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.180 
you
and<00:04:04.150> here<00:04:04.930> you<00:04:05.020> have<00:04:05.200> that<00:04:05.350> barrier<00:04:05.620> coming<00:04:06.040> up

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
and here you have that barrier coming up

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.370 
and here you have that barrier coming up
this<00:04:06.370> one<00:04:06.580> right<00:04:06.760> here<00:04:07.210> just<00:04:07.660> turn<00:04:07.840> left<00:04:08.140> and

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:08.380 
this one right here just turn left and
