00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
so my happy with swype type really fast

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.400 
so my happy with swype type really fast
with<00:02:24.319> swype<00:02:24.730> some<00:02:25.730> of<00:02:25.940> the<00:02:26.180> words<00:02:26.390> I<00:02:26.750> sometimes

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
with swype some of the words I sometimes

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.640 
with swype some of the words I sometimes
use<00:02:27.560> the<00:02:27.950> predictive<00:02:28.459> typing<00:02:28.910> is<00:02:29.060> that

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
use the predictive typing is that

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.030 
use the predictive typing is that
because<00:02:30.650> I<00:02:31.300> would<00:02:32.300> learn<00:02:32.510> to<00:02:32.569> swipe<00:02:33.260> a<00:02:33.620> stewed

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
because I would learn to swipe a stewed

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.130 
because I would learn to swipe a stewed
yet<00:02:34.340> but<00:02:34.730> I<00:02:34.760> am<00:02:34.880> still<00:02:35.209> learning<00:02:38.140> the

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
yet but I am still learning the

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.910 
yet but I am still learning the
predictive<00:02:39.620> typing<00:02:40.130> is<00:02:40.400> also<00:02:41.120> i<00:02:41.600> feel<00:02:42.140> it's

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
predictive typing is also i feel it's

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.240 
predictive typing is also i feel it's
better<00:02:43.190> than<00:02:43.459> swiftkey<00:02:44.060> because<00:02:45.250> predicts

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
better than swiftkey because predicts

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.180 
better than swiftkey because predicts
the<00:02:46.519> words<00:02:46.940> much<00:02:47.569> better<00:02:47.930> even<00:02:48.200> if<00:02:48.440> i<00:02:48.739> miss

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
the words much better even if i miss

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:55.020 
the words much better even if i miss
some<00:02:49.489> keys<00:02:49.970> so<00:02:50.920> don't<00:02:51.920> have<00:02:52.220> to<00:02:53.170> type<00:02:54.170> exactly

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
some keys so don't have to type exactly

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:01.630 
some keys so don't have to type exactly
what<00:02:56.030> word<00:02:56.390> is<00:02:56.870> and<00:02:57.440> thus<00:02:58.400> why<00:03:00.280> know<00:03:01.280> what<00:03:01.609> i

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
what word is and thus why know what i

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.630 
what word is and thus why know what i
want<00:03:02.060> to<00:03:02.299> type<00:03:02.510> anyway<00:03:03.049> so<00:03:03.920> even<00:03:04.220> if<00:03:04.310> you<00:03:04.430> don't

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
want to type anyway so even if you don't

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.840 
want to type anyway so even if you don't
want<00:03:04.940> to<00:03:05.120> use<00:03:05.299> the<00:03:05.540> swipe<00:03:05.900> feature<00:03:06.640> you<00:03:07.640> can
