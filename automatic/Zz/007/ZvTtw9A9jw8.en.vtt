energy<00:02:09.940> but<00:02:10.240> I<00:02:10.270> think<00:02:10.539> we<00:02:10.690> really<00:02:10.929> deliver<00:02:11.230> it

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
energy but I think we really deliver it

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:12.960 
energy but I think we really deliver it
not<00:02:11.860> just<00:02:12.070> through<00:02:12.310> our<00:02:12.430> sound<00:02:12.670> from<00:02:12.850> our

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
not just through our sound from our

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.460 
not just through our sound from our
stage<00:02:13.180> performance<00:02:13.750> we<00:02:14.110> have<00:02:14.200> a<00:02:14.230> lot<00:02:14.440> of

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
stage performance we have a lot of

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.440 
stage performance we have a lot of
catching<00:02:15.100> up<00:02:15.130> beat<00:02:15.550> songs<00:02:15.819> that<00:02:16.150> are<00:02:16.209> really

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
catching up beat songs that are really

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.180 
catching up beat songs that are really
getting<00:02:16.630> everybody<00:02:16.959> out<00:02:17.020> of<00:02:17.140> their<00:02:17.350> seats<00:02:17.620> but

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
getting everybody out of their seats but

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.729 
getting everybody out of their seats but
it's<00:02:18.580> also<00:02:18.850> got<00:02:19.090> a<00:02:19.150> familiar<00:02:19.750> sound<00:02:19.930> so<00:02:20.290> you'll

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739
