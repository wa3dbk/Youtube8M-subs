00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:06.200
 so it's better in this gap together 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.080
 championship game 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:12.049
 so all the workouts were 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:14.990
 recovery plan after playing with 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:17.289
 from there immediately flew away Stalin played a game 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:20.760
 championship 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:23.820
 which one is more precisely restorative and 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.940
 let me have a good mood 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.200
 that all the same victory on the field and who would 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:30.480
 second home a good result expected 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.189
 that it will be possible to win on Tuesday because 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.560
 initially said to be happy 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.840
 Whose but I do not know who spoke 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.780
 I did not say that I mean again that 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.730
 where does this command correspond to 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.820
 level 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:46.390
 it is Colin, I do not think it is collected there 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:49.000
 players are superior to human class there alone 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:51.579
 what were the difficulties in the game can more 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.160
 interfered with or not adapt myself when I 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:56.400
 I will not say that some difficulties were 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.690
 fields for both teams are the same 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.710
 the temperature was pretty pretty 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.780
 good decent that is the only one 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.770
 a plus 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.740
 so that is what 's 3d support 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.909
 gliders built please tell me 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.460
 tomorrow which football will play 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.850
 hinted will play hold 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.759
 result either 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:24.060
 the first number you know honestly can 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:26.159
 say that this is a question or even 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.619
 tomorrow before the game you see while we 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:32.030
 there were general meetings and 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.690
 yet another solution is 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.140
 game who is on 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:39.970
 I do not know 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:42.010
 2 again expect or sold out know 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:45.250
 honestly i would like but i don't think i 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:47.980
 don't think because my first big 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.970
 stadium sold out unfortunately we only 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.970
 collect games team 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:58.330
 here I want to believe of course but there is 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.080
 certain moments that may 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.659
 prevent 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.750
 the viewer 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.670
 voice now 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.400
 if a specific task in the Europa League from 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.830
 the team has a specific task 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.860
 tomorrow's game 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.150
 just and 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.150
 spare grammy for can 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.409
 thanks
