goals<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:39.420> all<00:01:39.570> sorts<00:01:39.869> of<00:01:39.930> stuff<00:01:39.990> so<00:01:40.439> a<00:01:40.890> very

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
goals and all sorts of stuff so a very

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.660 
goals and all sorts of stuff so a very
interesting<00:01:42.000> player<00:01:42.210> I<00:01:42.450> don't<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:42.990> I<00:01:43.890> don't

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
interesting player I don't and I don't

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.340 
interesting player I don't and I don't
think<00:01:44.850> he'll<00:01:45.000> be<00:01:45.119> too<00:01:45.360> expensive<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:46.049> one

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
think he'll be too expensive and one

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.499 
think he'll be too expensive and one
ultimate<00:01:46.680> team<00:01:46.890> maybe<00:01:47.460> because<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:48.030> 86

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
ultimate team maybe because the 86

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.450 
ultimate team maybe because the 86
rating<00:01:48.899> of<00:01:48.990> stuff<00:01:49.229> that<00:01:49.409> he<00:01:49.590> made<00:01:49.860> go<00:01:50.189> for

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
rating of stuff that he made go for

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.389 
rating of stuff that he made go for
somewhere<00:01:50.850> like<00:01:51.030> 25-30<00:01:51.930> k<00:01:52.229> to<00:01:52.740> start<00:01:53.009> off<00:01:53.130> with

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
somewhere like 25-30 k to start off with

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.850 
somewhere like 25-30 k to start off with
but<00:01:53.700> who<00:01:54.570> knows<00:01:54.750> depends<00:01:55.259> what<00:01:55.470> his<00:01:55.590> skill

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
but who knows depends what his skill

but who knows depends what his skill
moves<00:01:56.070> are<00:01:56.250> probably<00:01:56.549> will<00:01:56.729> be<00:01:56.850> like<00:01:56.969> a

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
moves are probably will be like a

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.690 
moves are probably will be like a
three-star<00:01:57.540> skiller<00:01:57.840> and<00:01:58.079> but<00:01:58.920> you<00:01:59.189> know<00:01:59.340> he's

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
something crazy and but D natale I still

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.000 
something crazy and but D natale I still
think<00:02:32.730> would<00:02:33.240> keep<00:02:33.450> that<00:02:33.630> 87<00:02:34.170> pace<00:02:34.380> I'm<00:02:34.890> gonna

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
think would keep that 87 pace I'm gonna

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.970 
think would keep that 87 pace I'm gonna
up<00:02:35.280> him<00:02:35.520> even<00:02:35.850> more<00:02:36.030> to<00:02:36.209> an<00:02:36.330> 86<00:02:37.140> rated<00:02:37.709> player

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
up him even more to an 86 rated player

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.040 
up him even more to an 86 rated player
so<00:02:38.580> sure<00:02:39.030> he's<00:02:39.150> the<00:02:39.240> sort<00:02:39.450> of<00:02:39.510> season<00:02:39.780> he<00:02:39.870> had

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
so sure he's the sort of season he had

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.590 
so sure he's the sort of season he had
for<00:02:40.320> even<00:02:40.560> a<00:02:40.680> day<00:02:40.709> last<00:02:41.040> year<00:02:41.190> still<00:02:42.180> scoring<00:02:42.510> a

loads<00:02:42.810> of<00:02:42.990> goals<00:02:43.170> even<00:02:43.560> at<00:02:43.680> his<00:02:43.830> age<00:02:44.010> almost

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
loads of goals even at his age almost

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.490 
loads of goals even at his age almost
like<00:02:45.180> he's<00:02:45.330> coming<00:02:45.600> into<00:02:45.810> his<00:02:45.900> prime<00:02:46.230> type

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
like he's coming into his prime type

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.440 
like he's coming into his prime type
thing<00:02:46.770> and<00:02:46.890> but<00:02:47.550> I<00:02:47.610> wouldn't<00:02:47.880> up<00:02:48.060> the<00:02:48.239> pace

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
thing and but I wouldn't up the pace

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.240 
thing and but I wouldn't up the pace
because<00:02:48.690> there's<00:02:48.989> no<00:02:49.110> way<00:02:49.290> a<00:02:49.320> gonna<00:02:49.830> do<00:02:50.040> that

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
because there's no way a gonna do that

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.949 
because there's no way a gonna do that
but<00:02:50.700> I<00:02:50.730> would<00:02:50.820> up<00:02:51.150> his<00:02:51.330> dribbling<00:02:51.750> his

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
but I would up his dribbling his

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.560 
but I would up his dribbling his
shooting<00:02:52.380> and<00:02:52.560> he's<00:02:52.890> heading<00:02:53.250> all<00:02:53.400> by<00:02:53.610> one<00:02:53.850> so

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
shooting and he's heading all by one so

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.030 
shooting and he's heading all by one so
everything<00:02:54.900> will<00:02:55.020> see<00:02:55.200> a<00:02:55.230> fairly<00:02:55.680> similar

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
everything will see a fairly similar

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.940 
everything will see a fairly similar
card<00:02:56.430> i<00:02:56.640> mean<00:02:56.790> the<00:02:56.970> stats<00:02:57.660> on<00:02:57.840> his<00:02:57.989> regular<00:02:58.440> 85

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
card i mean the stats on his regular 85

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.979 
card i mean the stats on his regular 85
card<00:02:59.280> at<00:02:59.400> the<00:02:59.430> moment<00:02:59.850> are<00:02:59.970> probably<00:03:00.570> worthy

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
card at the moment are probably worthy

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:05.090 
card at the moment are probably worthy
of<00:03:01.080> an<00:03:01.170> 86<00:03:01.620> I<00:03:01.739> mean<00:03:02.570> 8787<00:03:03.570> pace<00:03:03.900> 87<00:03:04.500> shooting<00:03:04.770> 88

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
of an 86 I mean 8787 pace 87 shooting 88

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.250 
of an 86 I mean 8787 pace 87 shooting 88
dribbling<00:03:05.489> that's<00:03:06.060> very<00:03:06.480> very<00:03:06.690> high<00:03:06.930> for<00:03:07.200> an

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
dribbling that's very very high for an

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.920 
dribbling that's very very high for an
85<00:03:07.920> rated<00:03:08.340> card<00:03:08.610> so<00:03:09.150> I<00:03:09.180> think<00:03:09.300> that<00:03:09.510> we'll<00:03:09.750> see

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
85 rated card so I think that we'll see

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.860 
85 rated card so I think that we'll see
mostly<00:03:10.170> the<00:03:10.530> same<00:03:10.560> stats<00:03:11.070> and<00:03:11.340> again<00:03:12.330> for<00:03:12.630> star

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
mostly the same stats and again for star

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.570 
mostly the same stats and again for star
skill<00:03:13.170> moves<00:03:13.410> and<00:03:13.590> decent<00:03:13.950> week<00:03:14.070> for<00:03:14.280> as<00:03:14.370> well

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
skill moves and decent week for as well

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.240 
skill moves and decent week for as well
would<00:03:14.730> be<00:03:14.940> a<00:03:15.150> nice<00:03:15.810> bonus<00:03:16.110> for<00:03:16.350> us<00:03:16.560> to<00:03:16.739> have<00:03:16.950> and

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
would be a nice bonus for us to have and

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.100 
would be a nice bonus for us to have and
he<00:03:17.489> will<00:03:17.610> be<00:03:17.730> a<00:03:17.760> deadly<00:03:18.120> strike<00:03:18.480> as<00:03:18.660> a<00:03:18.750> partner

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
he will be a deadly strike as a partner

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:49.640 
pick up again this year because he just

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:52.600 
pick up again this year because he just
looks<00:05:49.910> so<00:05:50.300> interesting<00:05:50.840> so<00:05:51.530> these<00:05:52.370> are<00:05:52.580> the

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:52.610 
looks so interesting so these are the

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:54.670 
looks so interesting so these are the
four<00:05:52.820> players<00:05:53.090> and<00:05:53.420> normally<00:05:54.230> at<00:05:54.320> this<00:05:54.380> point

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:54.680 
four players and normally at this point

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.470 
four players and normally at this point
in<00:05:54.740> the<00:05:54.800> video<00:05:54.890> we<00:05:55.220> talked<00:05:55.460> about<00:05:55.610> prices<00:05:56.300> and

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:56.480 
in the video we talked about prices and

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.600 
in the video we talked about prices and
what<00:05:56.600> I<00:05:56.630> think<00:05:56.960> they<00:05:57.080> could<00:05:57.350> be<00:05:57.380> worth<00:05:57.710> so<00:05:58.130> we

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:58.610 
what I think they could be worth so we

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:00.490 
what I think they could be worth so we
did<00:05:58.790> talk<00:05:58.970> about<00:05:59.030> without<00:05:59.570> earlier<00:06:00.020> i<00:06:00.080> reckon

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:00.500 
did talk about without earlier i reckon

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:03.070 
did talk about without earlier i reckon
somewhere<00:06:00.890> around<00:06:01.010> the<00:06:01.280> 30<00:06:01.550> kmart<00:06:02.120> but<00:06:02.930> then

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:03.080 
somewhere around the 30 kmart but then

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:04.510 
somewhere around the 30 kmart but then
thinking<00:06:03.470> about<00:06:03.680> it<00:06:03.860> now<00:06:04.010> it<00:06:04.280> could<00:06:04.460> be

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:04.520 
thinking about it now it could be

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:06.400 
thinking about it now it could be
slightly<00:06:04.910> more<00:06:05.240> than<00:06:05.270> that<00:06:05.540> due<00:06:05.930> to<00:06:06.140> the<00:06:06.230> fact

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:06.410 
slightly more than that due to the fact

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:08.620 
slightly more than that due to the fact
that<00:06:06.530> he<00:06:06.740> could<00:06:06.920> possibly<00:06:07.160> be<00:06:07.580> that<00:06:07.730> 86<00:06:08.060> rating

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:08.630 
that he could possibly be that 86 rating

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:10.960 
that he could possibly be that 86 rating
and<00:06:09.350> that<00:06:09.530> is<00:06:09.650> quite<00:06:10.010> a<00:06:10.070> high<00:06:10.340> rating<00:06:10.580> to<00:06:10.790> have

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:10.970 
and that is quite a high rating to have

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:13.540 
and that is quite a high rating to have
so<00:06:11.330> a<00:06:11.570> good<00:06:12.020> rock<00:06:12.260> solid<00:06:12.500> box-to-box<00:06:13.070> player

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:13.550 
so a good rock solid box-to-box player

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:15.760 
so a good rock solid box-to-box player
could<00:06:13.850> be<00:06:14.000> somewhere<00:06:14.360> near<00:06:14.540> 50<00:06:14.930> k<00:06:15.140> perhaps<00:06:15.530> oh

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:15.770 
could be somewhere near 50 k perhaps oh

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:18.240 
could be somewhere near 50 k perhaps oh
sure<00:06:16.310> are<00:06:16.520> we<00:06:16.670> I<00:06:16.700> think<00:06:16.880> we'll<00:06:17.330> probably<00:06:17.660> be

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:18.250 
sure are we I think we'll probably be

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:20.830 
sure are we I think we'll probably be
it's<00:06:19.250> only<00:06:19.430> a<00:06:19.460> regular<00:06:19.940> card<00:06:20.180> so<00:06:20.390> I<00:06:20.420> would<00:06:20.630> say

good<00:06:35.940> stats<00:06:36.210> on<00:06:36.420> him<00:06:36.600> same<00:06:37.200> with<00:06:37.380> Lamela<00:06:37.710> he

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:37.980 
good stats on him same with Lamela he

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:39.290 
good stats on him same with Lamela he
will<00:06:38.130> probably<00:06:38.340> no<00:06:38.580> doubt<00:06:38.760> be<00:06:38.910> five-star

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:39.300 
will probably no doubt be five-star

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:41.450 
will probably no doubt be five-star
skills<00:06:39.690> but<00:06:40.440> the<00:06:40.530> boosts<00:06:40.950> on<00:06:41.070> him<00:06:41.280> would

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:41.460 
skills but the boosts on him would

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:43.430 
skills but the boosts on him would
really<00:06:41.790> push<00:06:41.970> his<00:06:42.120> pride<00:06:42.390> shut<00:06:42.600> price<00:06:42.990> up<00:06:43.230> I

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:43.440 
really push his pride shut price up I

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:45.290 
really push his pride shut price up I
still<00:06:43.890> think<00:06:43.920> every<00:06:44.460> we<00:06:44.700> would<00:06:44.820> probably<00:06:45.060> be

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:45.300 
still think every we would probably be

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:47.060 
still think every we would probably be
more<00:06:45.510> if<00:06:45.720> he<00:06:45.870> was<00:06:46.050> a<00:06:46.080> five-star<00:06:46.590> skiller<00:06:46.890> and

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:47.070 
more if he was a five-star skiller and

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:49.160 
more if he was a five-star skiller and
but<00:06:47.760> you<00:06:47.880> can<00:06:48.030> look<00:06:48.180> at<00:06:48.330> probably<00:06:48.540> around<00:06:48.840> 30

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:49.170 
but you can look at probably around 30

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:51.440 
but you can look at probably around 30
to<00:06:49.350> 40<00:06:49.620> k<00:06:49.770> for<00:06:49.950> these<00:06:50.430> guys<00:06:50.670> to<00:06:50.730> start<00:06:51.120> off<00:06:51.240> with

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:51.450 
to 40 k for these guys to start off with

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:53.210 
to 40 k for these guys to start off with
perhaps<00:06:51.840> and<00:06:52.080> then<00:06:52.410> d<00:06:52.590> natale<00:06:52.950> would

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:53.220 
perhaps and then d natale would

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:55.160 
perhaps and then d natale would
obviously<00:06:53.430> be<00:06:53.580> a<00:06:53.940> very<00:06:54.570> very<00:06:54.960> expensive

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:55.170 
obviously be a very very expensive

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:56.990 
obviously be a very very expensive
