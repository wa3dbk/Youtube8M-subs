00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:09.179
 we can in several ways candlesticks 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.360
 muscle look him up 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.469
 we anticipate logically and cell biology 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.049
 so look at 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.240
 matter smallest unit we have 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:23.460
 can distinguish into spears guns 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:25.980
 are two white active you have had and 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.510
 actin and myosin your vision and 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.080
 bars of actin 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:35.640
 what do you fall on myosin have 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:39.840
 wonderful zenith and active 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.149
 2000 has seen us here with dara 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.070
 of comics 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:47.460
 cherish them 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:50.879
 because here more every muscle every muscle 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:54.260
 is controlled by a spur of 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:57.329
 motor means that there is a signal 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.760
 from the brain towards the muscle 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.789
 my arm goes that is possible with a synapse 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.629
 in schiedam so that now as metamos in the 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.720
 muscle 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.580
 see also here I happen as soon as my 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.490
 spiel be tightened comes one 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:15.180
 action potential at the synapse one 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:19.490
 from the most common as Kuoni net 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:23.390
 if you are not free to muscle 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:26.340
 membrane to channel and then 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:31.440
 feels those cells that feels like a brabo 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:33.850
 social and therefore a lot goes on 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.720
 muscle cells and becomes one of the few 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.900
 cells 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:40.120
 a special and also plasma triticum 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.100
 number sea is dirty 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.050
 a case on plasma they scare me 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.720
 inches in calcium 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.350
 happened when offer is up 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.380
 change 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:53.979
 go out for a stop here 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:57.250
 calcium ditch road towards you the myosin 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:02:01.600
 and actin and then happens together into one 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:03.610
 you see i normally 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.619
 simple explain well a simple more 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.899
 see a peter active cup 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:09.970
 so bad his powershot me know better now 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:13.660
 thank you these animals 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.830
 once there prefer to let her arm 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.880
 to move 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:21.489
 so and her muscle cells calcium calcium 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:24.519
 white to troponin 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:27.070
 and because troponin go tropomyosin 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:30.070
 shift so you stand a chance 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:33.760
 troponin and bing took care of that already 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:36.280
 said tropomyosin shifts and 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:39.430
 then the binding sites come for one 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:42.820
 new gino cookies free must actin 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.950
 that seeing happens here then together found it 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:46.630
 just very nice and also if i will again 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.330
 megens agent use 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:52.760
 like my movie a very simple one 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:55.670
 this is an actin they are very behind 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.470
 each other and what happens oh by calcium 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.880
 becomes the binding site this is the 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.460
 binding site 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:04.420
 for seeing new and free us the music 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:08.270
 cookie hair wax 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.890
 powerstroke to get your hair up he binds 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:14.930
 atb 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:18.230
 kuss ATP could be realized to ADP 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:20.330
 once again a normal beauty output 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.870
 the forest where no 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:26.210
 then going to actin is a lost one 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:30.410
 find way 

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:31.070
 ali b that loose and so writes actin mode 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.170
 view 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:34.130
 bit by bit so and what matters 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.840
 more 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:39.020
 really kind of a short short report 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:41.360
 and your muscles tighten and goes 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:44.600
 no go all-or-nothing piece 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:47.270
 No completely down and how that happens 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:49.430
 more business more slide into each other in 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:55.330
 forces can be supplied that is 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:55.330
 basically summarizing what you want
