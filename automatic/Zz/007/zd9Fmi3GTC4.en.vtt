00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
and what the great features are so let's

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.779 
and what the great features are so let's
get<00:00:27.570> started<00:00:27.990> right<00:00:28.109> off<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.619> bat<00:00:28.769> so<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.400> HDR

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
get started right off the bat so the HDR

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.540 
get started right off the bat so the HDR
CX<00:00:30.269> 550<00:00:30.960> V<00:00:31.140> as<00:00:31.289> I<00:00:31.439> said<00:00:31.679> is<00:00:31.830> one<00:00:32.009> of<00:00:32.130> Sony's

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
CX 550 V as I said is one of Sony's

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.459 
CX 550 V as I said is one of Sony's
strongest<00:00:33.090> camcorders<00:00:33.719> which<00:00:33.899> means<00:00:34.170> that<00:00:34.350> it

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
strongest camcorders which means that it

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.819 
strongest camcorders which means that it
can<00:00:34.649> do<00:00:34.860> of<00:00:35.100> course<00:00:35.630> 1080p<00:00:36.630> you<00:00:37.380> know<00:00:37.500> video

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
can do of course 1080p you know video

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.790 
can do of course 1080p you know video

you<00:01:13.409> know<00:01:13.530> memory<00:01:13.890> built<00:01:14.250> in<00:01:14.610> so<00:01:15.060> let's<00:01:15.270> see

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
you know memory built in so let's see

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.910 
you know memory built in so let's see
what<00:01:15.540> else<00:01:15.570> we<00:01:15.869> have<00:01:15.900> here<00:01:16.229> does<00:01:16.470> work<00:01:16.710> with

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
what else we have here does work with

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.070 
what else we have here does work with
the<00:01:17.040> Mac<00:01:17.250> work<00:01:17.610> so<00:01:17.759> nicely<00:01:18.150> with<00:01:18.299> iMovie<00:01:18.900> has

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
the Mac work so nicely with iMovie has

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.249 
the Mac work so nicely with iMovie has
the<00:01:19.590> Exmoor<00:01:20.070> CMOS<00:01:20.670> sensor<00:01:21.270> which<00:01:21.479> is<00:01:21.509> one<00:01:22.170> of

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
the Exmoor CMOS sensor which is one of

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.780 
the Exmoor CMOS sensor which is one of
the<00:01:22.320> best<00:01:22.560> sensors<00:01:23.009> around<00:01:23.159> on<00:01:23.580> the

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
the best sensors around on the

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.670 
the best sensors around on the
camcorders<00:01:24.390> now<00:01:24.540> this<00:01:25.229> is<00:01:25.380> really<00:01:25.560> a

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
camcorders now this is really a

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.130 
camcorders now this is really a
next-generation<00:01:26.310> camcorder<00:01:27.240> I<00:01:27.390> have<00:01:27.840> played

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
next-generation camcorder I have played

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.289 
next-generation camcorder I have played
with<00:01:28.170> it<00:01:28.470> a<00:01:28.530> couple<00:01:28.560> times<00:01:29.040> I<00:01:29.400> really<00:01:29.909> have<00:01:30.150> to

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
with it a couple times I really have to

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.080 
with it a couple times I really have to
say<00:01:30.479> that<00:01:30.689> it's<00:01:30.840> lived<00:01:31.110> up<00:01:31.229> to<00:01:31.409> its<00:01:32.009> hype<00:01:32.700> so

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
say that it's lived up to its hype so

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.609 
say that it's lived up to its hype so
let's<00:01:33.299> go<00:01:33.479> ahead<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:33.960> see<00:01:34.110> what<00:01:34.409> we<00:01:34.500> get

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
let's go ahead and see what we get

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.249 
let's go ahead and see what we get
around<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:35.040> box<00:01:35.280> before<00:01:35.729> anything<00:01:36.180> so<00:01:37.049> we<00:01:37.140> get

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
around the box before anything so we get

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.069 
around the box before anything so we get

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
also have the Exmoor CMOS sensor which

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.240 
also have the Exmoor CMOS sensor which
they<00:01:54.750> didn't<00:01:55.049> mention<00:01:55.320> which<00:01:55.439> is<00:01:55.500> one<00:01:56.070> of<00:01:56.100> the

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
they didn't mention which is one of the

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.039 
they didn't mention which is one of the
best<00:01:56.490> sensors<00:01:56.909> on<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.360> market<00:01:57.719> right<00:01:57.840> now<00:01:57.899> and

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
best sensors on the market right now and

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.480 
best sensors on the market right now and
we'll<00:01:58.380> take<00:01:58.530> a<00:01:58.590> look<00:01:58.770> at<00:01:58.920> that<00:01:59.070> it's<00:01:59.250> on<00:01:59.369> the

we'll take a look at that it's on the
front<00:01:59.610> of<00:01:59.729> the<00:01:59.820> camcorder<00:02:00.270> with<00:02:00.390> a<00:02:00.420> manual

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
front of the camcorder with a manual

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.010 
front of the camcorder with a manual
autofocus<00:02:01.920> which<00:02:02.070> is<00:02:02.219> pretty<00:02:02.430> cool<00:02:02.719> we<00:02:03.719> also

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
do have optical steadyshot

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.919 
do have optical steadyshot
which<00:02:07.409> is<00:02:07.560> pretty<00:02:07.770> awesome<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:08.610> that's

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
active we'll take a look at that as well

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.160 
active we'll take a look at that as well
in<00:02:10.459> the<00:02:10.519> review<00:02:10.909> we<00:02:11.420> also<00:02:11.599> have<00:02:11.780> a<00:02:11.810> wide-angle

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
in the review we also have a wide-angle

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.520 
in the review we also have a wide-angle
lens<00:02:12.620> which<00:02:13.489> is<00:02:13.519> very<00:02:13.939> cool<00:02:14.239> that<00:02:14.689> really<00:02:15.349> is

lens which is very cool that really is

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:16.990 
lens which is very cool that really is
one<00:02:15.829> of<00:02:15.859> the<00:02:16.010> features<00:02:16.400> that<00:02:16.430> I'm<00:02:16.730> very

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
one of the features that I'm very

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.179 
one of the features that I'm very
looking<00:02:17.420> forward<00:02:17.480> to<00:02:17.900> so<00:02:18.560> that<00:02:18.709> means<00:02:18.920> you<00:02:19.040> can

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
have really a wide angle and see

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:21.640 
have really a wide angle and see
everything<00:02:20.659> that's<00:02:20.840> around<00:02:21.200> you<00:02:21.379> on<00:02:21.469> your

camcorder<00:02:27.799> right<00:02:28.549> to<00:02:28.760> your<00:02:28.939> you<00:02:29.239> know

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:29.359 
camcorder right to your you know

00:02:29.359 --> 00:02:30.879 
camcorder right to your you know
actually<00:02:29.689> connected<00:02:30.139> to<00:02:30.170> your<00:02:30.379> external<00:02:30.650> hard

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:30.889 
actually connected to your external hard

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.269 
to transfer the information from there I

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:36.910 
to transfer the information from there I
thought<00:02:35.719> that<00:02:35.870> was<00:02:35.959> really<00:02:36.230> really<00:02:36.469> cool<00:02:36.739> as
