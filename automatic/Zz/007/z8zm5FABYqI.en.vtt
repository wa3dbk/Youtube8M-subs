00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.720
 17 

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:14.670
 hello hunters welcome to the channel 

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:18.600
 chin and here we are in monster 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:21.540
 hunter 4 ultimate and let's make one of 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.869
 these events that we have download 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:28.880
 free for the game we are also 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:32.490
 with a mongrel who is a subscriber so 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.590
 Hello hello, you know that 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:37.770
 both edu and I love them 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.620
 match subscribers and be able to cast 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.570
 some game with you so 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:47.240
 come let's focus a little on 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:51.110
 the fight as I said these two 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:54.620
 if you go one is normal and the other is 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:57.320
 the berserker in fact this is the truth 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.990
 that I'm here riding in 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:03.560
 this dlc we can then manufacture as 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:06.110
 reward a megaman costume for 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:10.640
 our tone for our latent good 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:13.130
 the megamall set in fact this this 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.620
 This event must be already suffered by the 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.500
 channel in your Japanese management already tells you 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:21.650
 in his life in the Japanese version but 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.930
 hey since it has come to us here as is 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.340
 as it is, you have to take advantage of it and you have to 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.610
 do it again because in addition the 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.610
 megaman suit is super funny 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.410
 for the gag 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.560
 and good as the sonic one 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:38.440
 it is also another one of the 7 because I like it 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:41.200
 have these little things 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.330
 the other tetsu defined goat come to 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.909
 walk around here like a stone in the 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.460
 mouth 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.609
 so you have to keep an eye on it too 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.069
 well an outside and we can forget about 

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:57.569
 the berserker and now we can 

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:59.850
 focus on the normal to hit the 

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:02.060
 beating your life until you can not 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.310
 cross again 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:07.159
 in this case perhaps it would be better to say 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:11.480
 until he can not roar again or 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:14.840
 take a stone from under the ground 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:17.660
 and I also remember you 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.540
 as always as we always do when 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:23.720
 one of these events 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:27.920
 the reward type weapon armor suit or 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:30.319
 set for the gadget then at the end of the 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.569
 video we make a small addition of 12 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:34.849
 minutes teaching the reward that 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:37.610
 We can manufacture the hunter's chair or 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:38.390
 of the cat depends on what we go 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.920
 giving 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:44.360
 but good to start these things 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:45.980
 we make this little addition so I 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.440
 When the combat is over, I will not 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:51.590
 I will fire in but I will say goodbye to 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:54.340
 end of everything after teaching the 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.340
 reward 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:01.220
 this monster both normal and as 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.600
 the species the truth that I always always 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.820
 has done a lot of good fun in principle 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:08.000
 the normal one not because the version that the 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:09.440
 They pulled out later but always a lot 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.860
 thank you very much I found a monster 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.720
 different than the one they added here to 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:18.950
 monster hunter especially for the appearance 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:22.310
 and so on and that of taking out stones from 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:25.310
 of the soil and have two types of stones 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:27.200
 with which he attacks and so on, no sir 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:30.410
 towards me I like I like it is one of the 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:33.260
 monsters that I like but I remember 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:36.860
 in case someone does not remember me 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:39.140
 showed preferred is and will be the manless 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.850
 if you succeeded and I achieved szyszlo in your two 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:44.260
 sheds 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:46.850
 and I say it always will be so why 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.940
 because yes because that is a monster 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:51.910
 special 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:55.090
 and if so forever and will continue to let 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:57.340
 that is special for me is come twigs 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.930
 that you have to be in line with the policy 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.420
 there is even going to say the beating that has 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:04.050
 been receiving then he has had his 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:07.840
 fruits because finally falls belly up 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:11.050
 I also love how the three of them fall 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:13.540
 goats here defeated with the belly 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:15.340
 above it is sometimes after a little 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:18.040
 tell you in your goat because I have in 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:21.730

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:23.950
