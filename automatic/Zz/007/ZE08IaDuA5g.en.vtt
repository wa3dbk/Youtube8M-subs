00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:09.969
 for this last part concerning this 

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:14.559
 first lesson we will resume the 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:17.490
 principle of the exercise before except that 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:20.710
 it's completely opposite we're going 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:25.840
 take this pentatonic scale into 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:27.490
 sleeves and but we'll do we go the 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.700
 evolve from the basics while 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.750
 keeping the strings acute so this is the 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.420
 thumb and forefinger holding 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:37.480
 pick that will help mount the 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:41.250
 range and the acute strings will be in 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.250
 drone example 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.050
 always looking for these 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.580
 imperfections that make the charm of 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.720
 blues 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:08.470
 I invite you to try roughly 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:10.770
 all the band combinations of 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:17.830
 hammer 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:22.330
 of slide in the end it's your own 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:25.840
 interpretation of his scales of his 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:27.120
 sentences and kiki that ultimately go to you 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.350
 get comfortable 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.880
 there is no way to really follow 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.100
 strictly speaking but more 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.810
 search for sound room 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.810
 rather than parker things to learn 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:46.000
 very clean here are some 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:49.120
 examples on this principle here we consider 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.460
 only to stay miqueu 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:53.920
 like a lot of blues are on one 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.050
 agreement - the joint the association 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.660
 the delineation of the grids will be done 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:01.390
 on some accents on some on 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:03.940
 some little geeks that will indicate 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.290
 that we are at the beginning of a cycle at the end of 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.530
 cycle but good for example at john lee 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:11.850
 hooker there is quantity amount of two 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.850
 little things like that for example 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.260
 m 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.940
 another example on another tempo 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.709
 we 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.709
 m 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.070
 but OK 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:56.849
 m 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.610
 and 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.610
 and 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.950
 and 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.910
 or 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.900
 I 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:39.790
