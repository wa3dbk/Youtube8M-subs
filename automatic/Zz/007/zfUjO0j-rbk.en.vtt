00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:15.039
 I drove a Renault 8 together 

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:19.990
 yes i drove by renault twizy 

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:23.509
 fun and snappy at the right point 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:26.570
 very conceptually very rigid 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:28.550
 a bike that is not very comfortable 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.529
 maybe a little more comfortable than a motorcycle 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.329
 surely I am in favor 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:34.489
 definitely at the beds for all that 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:36.829
 which concerns the environment but obviously 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:37.789
 then you have to deal with your own 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:41.170
 pockets 

00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:45.609
 I drove an electric mitsubishi e 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:48.559
 I was very satisfied with the 

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:52.190
 of the guide and especially in this case 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:56.539
 of this car of the starting point of the 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:01:01.550
 shooting just snappy it would take 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:05.810
 good incentives to lower 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:07.860
 both the cost of the machine and everything 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.299
 what 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.450
 involves using a machine 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:15.189
 guided a nissan leaf I found it 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.290
 obviously very well apart from who I am 

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:18.759
 used to seeing the golf car which is one 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.330
 electric car but it's another one 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:21.220
 thing 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.200
 this is a machine is a real e 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.270
 his own car that he certainly has 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.490
 features all the caresses of a 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.130
 normal car with the advantages that 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.509
 we all know from an electrical part 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.189
 with the big disadvantages of the cost 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:34.960
 proudly of the battery problem 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:38.170
 with everyone we know I've got to 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.880
 try the aic bike at first 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.009
 it's pretty weird it's a bit 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.740
 disorienting, however, is not very difficult 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:46.929
 taking our hand is definitely a means 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.030
 interesting because it is foldable because 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:52.600
 it is really very very light the 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:54.190
 so-so price however it could be 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.880
 an excellent solution to move into 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:56.679
 city 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.009
 I drove one of my cars 

00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:01.390
 French manufacture but I would say well for 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:03.509
 that one can ask for a spot of 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.340
 this kind that is the silent city 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.020
 relatively comfortable then small 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.290
 absolutely 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:13.630
 in all its manifestations the 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.910
 I would probably buy not now 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:19.950
 because the prices are unfortunately now the 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:21.430
 nvg 0 I tried the twizy and mine 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.950
 substantially three machines 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:28.600
 completely different from twizy is one 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:30.550
 Pretty cute car plus one more 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.160
 covered bike 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:35.530
 mine is already more a car and this one 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.230
 a very sporty car a lot 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:41.200
 graceful performance I already have a 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.330
 electric moped then I belong 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.530
 to the world of traveling people 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.870
 sull'elettrico 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.300
 I drove a star electric startup 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.100
 club but I found myself very well indeed 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:54.010
 even better than I thought because it is 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.510
 very quiet much less than box 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.370
 what you imagine is very much 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.260
 handy and therefore a very comfortable for 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.450
 the use I thought of doing, that is, of the dining room 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.910
 in the city ​​he was a little skeptical about 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.160
 made it a little too plastichina 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.950
 a little insecure, however, he finds it very much 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.840
 good visibility because not good 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.580
 looks quite high it seems to me too 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.670
 quite safe and then very easy to 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.670
 to drive
