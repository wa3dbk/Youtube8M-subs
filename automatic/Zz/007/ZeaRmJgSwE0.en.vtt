2010<00:00:46.989> this<00:00:47.989> little<00:00:48.320> comet<00:00:48.770> was<00:00:49.340> in<00:00:49.489> a<00:00:49.579> direct

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 
2010 this little comet was in a direct

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.390 
2010 this little comet was in a direct
alignment<00:00:50.360> between<00:00:50.810> the<00:00:51.170> Earth<00:00:51.350> and<00:00:51.380> the<00:00:52.130> Sun

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:52.400 
alignment between the Earth and the Sun

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.260 
alignment between the Earth and the Sun
on<00:00:52.700> that<00:00:53.390> date<00:00:54.430> there<00:00:55.430> was<00:00:55.550> an<00:00:55.640> earthquake<00:00:55.760> in

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:56.270 
on that date there was an earthquake in

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.260 
on that date there was an earthquake in
chile<00:00:57.170> that's<00:00:58.160> just<00:00:58.310> a<00:00:58.460> coincidence<00:00:58.579> isn't<00:00:59.120> it

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 
chile that's just a coincidence isn't it

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.170 
chile that's just a coincidence isn't it
well<00:01:00.050> there<00:01:00.380> was<00:01:00.410> another<00:01:00.770> coincidence

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:01.180 
well there was another coincidence

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.460 
well there was another coincidence
because<00:01:02.180> when<00:01:02.510> the<00:01:02.600> earth<00:01:02.750> came<00:01:03.050> around<00:01:03.290> the

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
because when the earth came around the

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.010 
because when the earth came around the
other<00:01:03.559> side<00:01:03.680> here<00:01:04.339> and<00:01:04.519> the<00:01:05.449> earth<00:01:05.630> was<00:01:05.869> in

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
other side here and the earth was in

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.450 
other side here and the earth was in
alignment<00:01:06.350> and<00:01:06.710> then<00:01:06.979> the<00:01:07.070> common<00:01:07.340> was<00:01:07.429> a

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
alignment and then the common was a

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:08.440 
alignment and then the common was a
little<00:01:07.639> bit<00:01:07.759> closer<00:01:07.969> but<00:01:08.210> they're<00:01:08.329> in

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
little bit closer but they're in

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.749 
little bit closer but they're in
alignment<00:01:08.749> again<00:01:09.020> and<00:01:09.380> that<00:01:09.829> was<00:01:09.979> September<00:01:10.689> 4

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:12.759 
alignment again and that was September 4

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:15.730 
alignment again and that was September 4
2010<00:01:14.079> there<00:01:15.079> was<00:01:15.170> an<00:01:15.229> earthquake<00:01:15.319> in

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
2010 there was an earthquake in

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.819 
2010 there was an earthquake in
christchurch<00:01:15.859> and<00:01:17.289> then<00:01:18.289> the<00:01:18.409> earth<00:01:18.499> came

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:18.829 
christchurch and then the earth came

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:21.459 
christchurch and then the earth came
back<00:01:19.039> round<00:01:19.280> again<00:01:19.459> and<00:01:19.929> then<00:01:20.929> the<00:01:21.049> next<00:01:21.079> time

00:01:21.459 --> 00:01:21.469 
back round again and then the next time

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:23.620 
back round again and then the next time
it<00:01:21.740> was<00:01:21.950> in<00:01:22.100> alignment<00:01:22.399> with<00:01:22.639> the<00:01:22.789> sun<00:01:23.149> and<00:01:23.389> now

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
it was in alignment with the sun and now

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.060 
it was in alignment with the sun and now
this<00:01:23.780> is<00:01:23.929> closer<00:01:24.639> march

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070 
this is closer march

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.440 
this is closer march
however<00:01:28.030> there's<00:01:28.750> an<00:01:28.870> earthquake<00:01:28.990> in<00:01:29.350> Japan

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
however there's an earthquake in Japan

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.050 
however there's an earthquake in Japan
once<00:01:31.450> is<00:01:31.630> a<00:01:31.659> coincidence<00:01:32.310> twice<00:01:33.310> is<00:01:33.640> pushing

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
once is a coincidence twice is pushing

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.880 
once is a coincidence twice is pushing
it<00:01:34.150> three<00:01:34.600> times<00:01:34.870> wait<00:01:35.350> a<00:01:35.440> minute<00:01:35.620> something's

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
it three times wait a minute something's

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.680 
it three times wait a minute something's
going<00:01:36.310> on<00:01:36.430> here<00:01:36.490> the<00:01:37.090> other<00:01:37.270> one<00:01:37.450> that<00:01:37.600> will

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:37.690 
going on here the other one that will

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:39.690 
going on here the other one that will
happen<00:01:37.870> is<00:01:38.110> august<00:01:38.500> seventeenth<00:01:38.950> I've<00:01:39.430> gone

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
through California I have to turn the

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.390 
through California I have to turn the
Rings<00:02:18.850> down<00:02:19.060> first<00:02:19.390> of<00:02:19.540> all<00:02:19.690> and<00:02:20.010> even<00:02:21.010> then

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
Rings down first of all and even then

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.670 
Rings down first of all and even then
they're<00:02:22.030> just<00:02:22.300> one<00:02:22.540> on<00:02:22.720> top<00:02:22.959> of<00:02:23.110> the<00:02:23.200> other<00:02:23.320> so

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
they're just one on top of the other so

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.970 
they're just one on top of the other so
many<00:02:23.890> you<00:02:24.040> can't<00:02:24.280> even<00:02:24.370> see<00:02:24.670> and<00:02:25.660> if<00:02:26.590> I<00:02:26.680> just<00:02:26.830> go

everybody knows the indonesian agency

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:05.280 
everybody knows the indonesian agency
reported<00:03:01.780> their<00:03:02.049> six<00:03:02.350> point<00:03:02.590> out<00:03:02.680> is<00:03:02.799> a<00:03:02.829> 6.5<00:03:04.290> so

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
reported their six point out is a 6.5 so

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.080 
reported their six point out is a 6.5 so

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
the ESM see it says six on the usgs i

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.400

think<00:03:17.890> is<00:03:17.980> a<00:03:18.010> 5.7<00:03:18.340> and<00:03:19.769> then<00:03:20.769> the<00:03:20.890> japan<00:03:21.370> quake

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
think is a 5.7 and then the japan quake

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.960 
think is a 5.7 and then the japan quake
is<00:03:22.209> listed<00:03:22.540> as<00:03:22.660> a<00:03:22.690> 5.9<00:03:23.620> so<00:03:24.430> what<00:03:24.670> they<00:03:24.790> do<00:03:24.850> is

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
is listed as a 5.9 so what they do is

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.970 
is listed as a 5.9 so what they do is
they<00:03:25.269> downgrade<00:03:25.810> them<00:03:25.989> so<00:03:26.200> they<00:03:26.320> don't<00:03:26.620> show

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
they downgrade them so they don't show

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.830 
they downgrade them so they don't show
