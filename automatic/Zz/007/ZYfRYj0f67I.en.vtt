00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
end if it doesn't have a whole it's not

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.109 
end if it doesn't have a whole it's not
an<00:01:03.930> SOS<00:01:04.320> sampling<00:01:04.739> port<00:01:05.040> so<00:01:05.850> what<00:01:05.970> I'm<00:01:06.030> going

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
an SOS sampling port so what I'm going

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.880

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
full bottle but on our good sample here

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.040 
full bottle but on our good sample here
I<00:02:31.160> filled<00:02:31.460> the<00:02:31.550> bottle<00:02:31.850> up<00:02:32.300> to<00:02:32.540> the<00:02:32.630> line<00:02:32.840> where

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
I filled the bottle up to the line where

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.740 
I filled the bottle up to the line where
it<00:02:33.890> says<00:02:34.040> fill<00:02:34.250> two<00:02:34.400> and<00:02:35.060> now<00:02:35.330> i<00:02:35.360> want<00:02:35.600> to<00:02:35.660> put

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.800 
my cap on here somebody my good cap I
left<00:02:44.600> it<00:02:44.720> in<00:02:44.840> the<00:02:44.960> bag<00:02:46.060> until<00:02:47.060> it<00:02:47.420> was<00:02:47.540> ready<00:02:47.720> to

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
left it in the bag until it was ready to

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.150 
left it in the bag until it was ready to
use<00:02:47.900> it<00:02:48.080> a<00:02:48.110> lot<00:02:48.290> of<00:02:48.410> guys<00:02:48.530> would<00:02:48.680> take<00:02:48.740> that<00:02:48.980> cap

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
use it a lot of guys would take that cap

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.320 
use it a lot of guys would take that cap
stick<00:02:49.430> it<00:02:49.550> in<00:02:49.640> their<00:02:49.730> pocket<00:02:49.880> so<00:02:50.210> it's

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
stick it in their pocket so it's

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:51.640 
stick it in their pocket so it's
convenient<00:02:50.690> and<00:02:50.840> then<00:02:50.990> they'll<00:02:51.110> get<00:02:51.230> Lynn<00:02:51.470> on
