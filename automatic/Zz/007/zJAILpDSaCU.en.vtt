Namaskaar! Welcome to nishamadhulika.com.

00:00:08.234 --> 00:00:13.992
We generally like to eat something in the
evening with tea, so we make pakoras sometimes.

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:17.281
Pakoras are made from many things.

00:00:17.586 --> 00:00:21.414
We can make pakora using potatoes, brinjals and cauliflowers.

00:00:21.695 --> 00:00:25.804
But today we will not make pakora using these vegetables.

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:32.343
Instead we will make poha moongfali crisy pakora that are very tasty.

00:00:32.883 --> 00:00:36.234
So let's start making poha moongfali pakora.

00:00:36.859 --> 00:00:38.696
1 cup flattened rice (poha)

00:00:39.164 --> 00:00:41.273
1 cup peanuts (moongfali)

00:00:41.781 --> 00:00:43.031
1 cup gram flour (besan)

00:00:43.352 --> 00:00:46.898
2-3 tsp chopped coriander leaves (dhaniya)

00:00:47.428 --> 00:00:49.561
½ tsp coriander powder (dhaniya powder)

00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:52.093
½ tsp lred chilli powder (lal mirch powder)

00:00:52.555 --> 00:00:55.000
2-3 finely chopped green chilli (hari mirch)

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:02.304
¾ tsp salt (namak) or as per taste

00:01:02.633 --> 00:01:04.851
Oil for frying pakora

00:01:05.898 --> 00:01:08.891
Let us prepare the batter for making pakora.

00:01:10.663 --> 00:01:13.281
Add 1 cup water in the bowl containing the poha and keep aside for sometime.

00:01:13.772 --> 00:01:17.078
The poha will become and ready for use.

00:01:18.492 --> 00:01:26.789
Put the gram flour in a big bowl. Add a little water in the gram flour.

00:01:27.367 --> 00:01:37.078
Make a paste needed for making pakora. There should be no bubbles in the paste.

00:01:37.461 --> 00:01:40.203
It should be smooth.

00:01:42.391 --> 00:01:47.843
Keep mixing it, till it becomes absolutely smooth.

00:01:49.078 --> 00:02:01.960
Add coriander powder, red chilli powder, green chilli, salt and coriander leaves.

00:02:08.405 --> 00:02:10.273
Mix everything well.

00:02:10.796 --> 00:02:15.749
If coriander leaves are not available, you can also put fenugreek leaves.

00:02:17.023 --> 00:02:22.734
Fenugreek seeds also give a good flavour. Mix the batter properly.

00:02:23.124 --> 00:02:30.507
Now our flattened rice have become fluffy. Remove extra water from the rice.

00:02:30.961 --> 00:02:34.867
Add the soaked rice in the batter.

00:02:35.694 --> 00:02:44.757
Add peanuts in the batter as well. Mix it thoroughly.

00:02:45.602 --> 00:02:49.617
You can add more water if it is required.

00:02:53.773 --> 00:03:06.781
The batter for making pakora is now ready. The oil in the pan is hot

00:03:07.311 --> 00:03:10.992
We can check by putting one pakora in the pan.

00:03:14.757 --> 00:03:23.187
The pakora is getting fried. Put as many pakoras as can fit in the pan.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:33.076
You can put the pakoras in the pan using your hand or with the help of a spoon.

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.451
The gas should not be on a very high flame.But
it should be little more than medium flame.

00:03:47.577 --> 00:03:54.756
Fry the pakoras till they get golden brown in colour.

00:04:10.348 --> 00:04:14.389
It takes around 6-7 minutes to fry one batch of pakoras.

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.685
Continue the process for more pakoras.

00:04:41.256 --> 00:04:48.068
Hot and crispy flattened rice peanut pakoras are now ready.

00:04:48.506 --> 00:05:01.512
One great feature of rice peanut pakoras is that
they remain crispy even when they are cold.

00:05:01.981 --> 00:05:10.121
If you want to make these pakora spicy, add 1 pinch chaat masala on top.

00:05:10.638 --> 00:05:15.973
Serve rice peanut pakoras with kasundi and tomato sauce.

00:05:16.442 --> 00:05:23.043
