teams i like seeing all year says it's
it<00:01:50.759> is<00:01:51.090> yeah<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:51.990> they<00:01:52.140> make<00:01:52.170> compromises<00:01:52.920> to

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
it is yeah and they make compromises to

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.130 
it is yeah and they make compromises to
how<00:01:53.399> those<00:01:53.610> four<00:01:53.880> teams<00:01:54.149> are<00:01:54.299> picked<00:01:54.600> so

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
how those four teams are picked so

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.929 
how those four teams are picked so
they're<00:01:55.320> so<00:01:55.560> gonna<00:01:55.710> give<00:01:55.950> preferences<00:01:56.700> to<00:01:56.820> the

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
they're so gonna give preferences to the

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.760 
they're so gonna give preferences to the
big<00:01:57.149> conferences<00:01:57.930> and<00:01:58.290> they're<00:01:58.409> still<00:01:58.649> gonna

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
big conferences and they're still gonna

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.730 
big conferences and they're still gonna
poll<00:01:59.490> people<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:00.630> make<00:02:00.810> sure<00:02:00.840> that<00:02:01.259> nobody's

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
poll people and make sure that nobody's

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.800 
poll people and make sure that nobody's
feelings<00:02:02.159> are<00:02:02.310> hurt<00:02:02.340> much<00:02:03.180> more<00:02:03.210> importantly

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
feelings are hurt much more importantly

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.679 
feelings are hurt much more importantly
their<00:02:04.049> wallet<00:02:04.680> isn't<00:02:04.799> hurt<00:02:05.130> and<00:02:05.399> then<00:02:06.030> you're

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
their wallet isn't hurt and then you're

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.419 
their wallet isn't hurt and then you're
finally<00:02:07.079> get<00:02:07.380> those<00:02:07.500> four<00:02:07.799> teams<00:02:08.069> and<00:02:08.310> my

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
finally get those four teams and my

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:09.800 
finally get those four teams and my
guess<00:02:08.670> is<00:02:08.879> because<00:02:09.090> they<00:02:09.209> don't<00:02:09.390> have<00:02:09.450> power

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
guess is because they don't have power

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.710 
guess is because they don't have power
even<00:02:10.590> if<00:02:10.679> boise<00:02:11.099> state<00:02:11.400> is<00:02:11.580> like<00:02:11.790> 28<00:02:12.390> uno

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
even if boise state is like 28 uno

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.670 
even if boise state is like 28 uno
somehow<00:02:13.260> they'll<00:02:13.470> be

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
somehow they'll be

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.589 
somehow they'll be
team<00:02:13.829> number<00:02:14.010> five<00:02:14.340> and<00:02:14.849> won't<00:02:15.299> make<00:02:15.480> the

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
team number five and won't make the

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:18.080 
team number five and won't make the
playoffs<00:02:15.739> for<00:02:16.739> the<00:02:16.799> first<00:02:16.950> three<00:02:17.340> years<00:02:17.370> you

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
playoffs for the first three years you

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.209 
playoffs for the first three years you
know<00:02:18.180> how<00:02:18.299> that<00:02:18.510> goes<00:02:18.750> right<00:02:19.049> and<00:02:19.379> eventually

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:20.219 
know how that goes right and eventually

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:23.809 
know how that goes right and eventually
it'll<00:02:20.730> fix<00:02:21.329> itself<00:02:21.510> yada<00:02:22.200> yada<00:02:22.469> but<00:02:22.819> overall

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
it'll fix itself yada yada but overall

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:25.849 
it'll fix itself yada yada but overall
