sound<00:01:14.790> but<00:01:15.030> by<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.570> positioning<00:01:16.110> of<00:01:16.170> your

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
sound but by the positioning of your

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.109

tongue<00:01:16.530> but<00:01:17.159> this<00:01:17.280> is<00:01:17.400> how<00:01:17.490> I<00:01:17.520> usually<00:01:17.759> like<00:01:18.060> to

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
tongue but this is how I usually like to
