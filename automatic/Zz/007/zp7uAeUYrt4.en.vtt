00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
this water attribute deck here is so now

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:05.899 
this water attribute deck here is so now
they're<00:01:04.920> changing<00:01:05.250> it<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.700> water

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
they're changing it to the water

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.960 
they're changing it to the water
attribute<00:01:06.470> structure<00:01:07.470> deck<00:01:07.670> hopefully<00:01:08.670> it

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
attribute structure deck hopefully it

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.800 
attribute structure deck hopefully it
will<00:01:09.060> be<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.439> popular<00:01:10.439> one<00:01:11.510> it's<00:01:12.510> always<00:01:12.689> been

will be a popular one it's always been

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.870 
will be a popular one it's always been
popular<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.619> new<00:01:13.830> structure<00:01:14.340> decks<00:01:14.670> that's

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
popular the new structure decks that's

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.450 
popular the new structure decks that's
been<00:01:15.060> coming<00:01:15.240> out<00:01:15.479> so<00:01:15.840> hopefully<00:01:16.220> this<00:01:17.220> one

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
been coming out so hopefully this one

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.590 
been coming out so hopefully this one
will<00:01:17.549> be<00:01:17.670> good<00:01:17.850> too<00:01:18.380> okay<00:01:19.380> so<00:01:20.150> it<00:01:21.150> will<00:01:21.270> revolve

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
will be good too okay so it will revolve

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.760 
will be good too okay so it will revolve
around<00:01:22.670> eck<00:01:23.670> or<00:01:24.180> exceeding<00:01:24.900> monster<00:01:25.380> level

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
around eck or exceeding monster level

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.060 
around eck or exceeding monster level
three<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:27.020> not<00:01:28.020> don't<00:01:28.470> think<00:01:28.650> that's<00:01:28.799> tuned

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
three and not don't think that's tuned

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.330 
three and not don't think that's tuned
in<00:01:29.250> here<00:01:29.549> so<00:01:30.450> probably<00:01:30.810> be<00:01:31.020> exceed<00:01:31.439> on<00:01:31.979> my

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
in here so probably be exceed on my

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:38.359 
in here so probably be exceed on my
salut<00:01:32.610> okay<00:01:34.640> and<00:01:35.869> then<00:01:36.920> now<00:01:37.920> we're<00:01:38.100> going<00:01:38.250> to

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
salut okay and then now we're going to

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.880 
salut okay and then now we're going to
the<00:01:38.640> reprints<00:01:40.610> okay<00:01:41.960> so<00:01:42.960> this<00:01:43.110> one<00:01:43.380> I<00:01:43.619> think

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
the reprints okay so this one I think

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.330 
the reprints okay so this one I think
for<00:01:44.250> three<00:01:44.579> there's<00:01:45.149> your<00:01:45.299> tuna<00:01:45.659> so<00:01:46.340> they'll

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
for three there's your tuna so they'll

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.460 
for three there's your tuna so they'll
probably<00:01:47.579> tuned<00:01:47.970> between<00:01:48.390> an<00:01:48.540> exceed<00:01:48.990> echo

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
probably tuned between an exceed echo

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:56.179 
probably tuned between an exceed echo
say<00:01:49.759> so<00:01:51.500> ok<00:01:52.500> this<00:01:52.920> is<00:01:54.530> I'm<00:01:55.530> sure<00:01:55.740> you<00:01:55.890> know<00:01:56.009> what

say so ok this is I'm sure you know what

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.679 
say so ok this is I'm sure you know what
they<00:01:56.310> all<00:01:56.460> are<00:01:56.490> so<00:01:57.060> this<00:01:57.240> one's<00:01:57.450> been

so<00:02:13.050> now<00:02:13.200> it's<00:02:13.380> common<00:02:13.920> the<00:02:14.340> price<00:02:14.550> will<00:02:14.730> be

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
so now it's common the price will be

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.240 
so now it's common the price will be
will<00:02:15.360> still<00:02:15.570> be<00:02:15.720> quite<00:02:15.930> expensive<00:02:16.200> but<00:02:16.740> would

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
will still be quite expensive but would

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.980 
will still be quite expensive but would
be<00:02:17.280> a<00:02:17.430> lot<00:02:17.580> cheaper<00:02:17.610> obviously<00:02:18.480> because<00:02:18.690> it's

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
be a lot cheaper obviously because it's

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.390 
be a lot cheaper obviously because it's
common<00:02:20.120> screeches<00:02:21.120> no<00:02:21.390> man<00:02:21.600> eater<00:02:21.900> it<00:02:22.740> was

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
common screeches no man eater it was

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.150 
common screeches no man eater it was
like<00:02:23.910> so<00:02:24.600> it's<00:02:24.780> been<00:02:24.960> a<00:02:24.990> primary<00:02:25.320> card<00:02:25.680> now

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
like so it's been a primary card now

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.000 
like so it's been a primary card now
it's<00:02:26.370> gone<00:02:26.730> into<00:02:27.000> the<00:02:27.120> structure<00:02:27.420> deck<00:02:27.690> so<00:02:28.590> it

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
it's gone into the structure deck so it

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.620 
it's gone into the structure deck so it
