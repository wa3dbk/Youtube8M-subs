00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:08.870
 hello this little toy that I have here is a 

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:11.139
 impressive sound equipment in 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:15.559
 tower format that is capable of generating 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:20.349
 hold on until 1440 watts is the sony 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:20.349
 mhp v7 of 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.850
 you 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.120
 yes 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:56.970
 Well, let's investigate their different 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:01.800
 controls and controls up here is the 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:05.820
 top emitter with this wheel for 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:09.180
 Orient lighting function 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:13.020
 which you choose the audio sources that 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:15.330
 wants to select sound field is the 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.950
 way to define the different modes of 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:22.130
 equalization and even allows one 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:26.490
 Custom light moat allows you to choose 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:29.280
 if you want the emitters to be 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:33.420
 three lit only the wall only 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.750
 lower or off and enter and this 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:40.400
 central control is for 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:42.350
 take care of bluetooth commands 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.850
 because one of the sources of sound is 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.310
 by any external player 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:49.500
 without bluetooth and mega bass cables 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:53.520
 by which they intensify 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.260
 the serious stop button play button and 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.290
 there is the general switch to start 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:00.630
 march and shutdown 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:02.880
 decrease and increase the volume 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.060
 a tactile touch panel that then you 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.040
 I explain 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.369
 different control alternatives 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.369
 gesture 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:15.690
 football mode that also then I tell you 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:17.480
 what is party light 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:21.110
 To define 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:23.150
 the lights in the party party session 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.159
 change to connect multiple systems 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.390
 chain audio and so recreate a 

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:32.459
 party atmosphere 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:35.700
 two usb ports the second allows 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:37.920
 record the sound broadcasts and both 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.900
 they allow to recharge the gases that 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.510
 we have connected for example if 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.000
 you have a mobile connected via usb 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:48.090
 this is the section of the microphones 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.700
 with two microphone inputs wheel 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:54.430
 To define 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:56.829
 the level the volume of the microphones 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.620
 and the vowel father and I miss 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:01.870
 different effects with the microphones 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.870
 this rocker allows you to select the 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:08.739
 folder where the files are 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:11.739
 reproduce if we have used a usb 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:15.189
 another rocker to adjust the stations 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:16.840
 of the radio fm or to advance or 

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:18.790
 go back on the tracks in the 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.489
 songs 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.620
 button to start or shut down to 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:26.019
 activate or desactivate 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:30.760
 gestural controls that this allows 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:32.260
 team and then nfc type because this 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:36.159
 equipment is compatible with the protocol 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:38.830
 nfc that the devices came out through 

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:42.670
 a touch and down here is each tray the 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:45.069
 charger to use the cds or dvds in 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.569
 the sound reproduction one of its 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:48.730
 virtues is the generation capacity 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:50.799
 of very strong blunt 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:53.950
 forceful for it has a 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:56.410
 Buffer cone 25 centimeters 9.8 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.900
 inches you can choose between two modes 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.870
 of serious the normal or super serious 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.430
 using the button that I indicated before 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.690
 It has different technologies 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.940
 improve sound quality 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:10.209
 for example the digital sound in more 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:11.409
 meant engine of that that deals with 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:13.810
 treat musical archives 

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:16.180
 tablets that are in mp3 format 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.699
 a cc a track and wm 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.650
 to intelligently restore the 

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:24.039
 acute and the serious ones that have been lost 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:26.800
 during that compression and talking about 

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:28.810
 This holiday sony v 7 has 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.950
 different features to organize 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.780
 sessions of dj's 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:33.820
 and customize the songs with effects 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.980
 of sound to for example add 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.020
 applause screams saga reggae or 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:40.420
 comments and various animations of your 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.910
 own voice that better than liven up their 

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:44.440
 dj sessions that with lights as well as 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:47.990
 I told you before this song team 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:50.360
 includes integrated lights generators 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:52.100
 at the top in the center and in 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:56.260
 the lower side a few light effects 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.260
 that can keep up with the music 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:15.969
 The sony 7 comes standard with a remote 

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:18.129
 remote hand essence of the normals 

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:21.099
 not the standard ones but you can control it 

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:22.539
 also from your mobile or your tablet to 

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:25.870
 it is enough to download the application 

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:27.639
 sony pal and link team with mobile and 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:30.400
 tablet for it uses the protocol 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:32.500
 bluetooth and also nfc so it 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.090
 associate by a touch 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:36.520
 also also through another application 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:38.469
 call this bowl and stable you can 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:40.300
 control from your mobile or tablet the 

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:43.090
 speaker lights and sound effects 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:44.830
 that entertain the party even more you can 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:46.569
 control all this by gestures of 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:48.250
 your hand to generate the different 

00:05:46.569 --> 00:05:50.740
 sound and light changes the song 

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:52.810
 about the volume and so on look at this life 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:54.639
 while you are watching the team and tells 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:57.900
 that your children are available that 

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:57.900
 emission has each 

00:06:03.569 --> 00:06:07.319
 and you stressed that curiosity about the way 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:09.210
 special equalization for the network 

00:06:07.319 --> 00:06:11.189
 transmissions of a football match 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:12.629
 in order to generate an experience 

00:06:11.189 --> 00:06:14.999
 similar to as if you were in the 

00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:16.619
 center of the stadium and is that another of the 

00:06:14.999 --> 00:06:19.080
 uses of this equipment is that it makes 

00:06:16.619 --> 00:06:24.050
 speaker and a TV as a bar 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:24.050
 sound but with this shocking format
