00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:06.930
 Hello 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.870
 today we will learn how to make a 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.610
 baked potato we start people 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.780
 you have to choose the correct date and 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.380
 correct potato for us to be able to 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.139
 to work 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.779
 is this the potato wind the potato that is 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.609
 slightly lighter bark and 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.010
 that at the time of baking will give a potato 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.289
 very crispy and very golden 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.760
 I have two options to be able to make me 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.039
 Can I get potato the way she is? 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.050
 give some cleans a few pieces that she 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.450
 Be a little uglier, no 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:39.270
 taking out the little eyes here that the potato 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:42.300
 I'm going to wash it very well and I can 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.809
 get potato that way and cut it already 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:49.739
 sliced ​​and prepare to pass the way 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.960
 What is she bark with? 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.870
 Even we do what we people do. 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.980
 rustic potato flame then cut into 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.280
 buds 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.539
 that way and said here I put her 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.149
 square 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.820
 the other option we have is to take 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.390
 our own potato band and instead of 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:12.979
 to wash 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.979
 I'm going to peel her and slums at home 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.470
 with her already peeled I'm going to do the 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.340
 same process I did with the potato 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.250
 with home 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:27.659
 the cut into buds or with a screen in 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.340
 eight pieces more or less because the 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.500
 We cut it to make it easier. 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.369
 to release at the time I'm going to put the 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.189
 in the oven 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.380
 It has more surface to power 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:42.000
 contact with the oven air and 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.590
 is well baked and beautiful here I 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.759
 to put a little salt of fine salt 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.840
 I can put some salt 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.840
 that's okay too 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:55.689
 I'll put some thyme leaves 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:02:00.700
 after placing rosemary in place of the tournament 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:02:05.250
 also if I want and lastly a 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.250
 little olive oil 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:19.540
 Our battle is ready for me. 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:25.510
 take and bake at 180 degrees for more or 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:33.130
 less than 25 to 30 less good and so are 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:38.170
 our golden baked potatoes and 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:42.010
 to finish it, I can 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:46.840
 put a little salt on top and 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:50.519
 a little olive oil again and that 's how 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.519
 We make baked potatoes.
