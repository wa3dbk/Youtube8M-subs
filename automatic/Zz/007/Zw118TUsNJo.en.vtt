00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.299
 Good afternoon, dear viewers, I will brush my 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.429
 speaking and rustam niyozova 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.259
 and in the third issue I would like to win 

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:22.050
 and quite atypical for our project 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:23.910
 the topic of dictation on the example of such 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:28.320
 cute product from philips 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.789
 this lfs 655 rub nancy is not a voice recorder again 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.009
 cost of 18 thousand tenge 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.070
 but actually I wanted to talk not about 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.180
 specific model and about the recorder oh how 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.980
 device class 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.990
 by the way, I noticed that nadi 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.330
 the journalist is now quietly refusing 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.350
 from professional voice recorders replacing 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.750
 them at briefings 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.260
 and I donâ€™t know the usual interviews 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.910
 smartphones as known in any 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.830
 self-respecting smartphone is correct 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.420
 voice and sound recording application 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:56.610
 many actually began 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.950
 use a student really all 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.310
 use smartphones to record important 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:04.920
 lectures there and so on but I would like 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:08.660
 become the protection of professional voice recorders 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:12.360
 due to the fact that they have several 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:16.409
 very important features that make them 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:20.100
 Well, I do not know the necessary thing for everyone 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:22.200
 day for anyone thinking and many 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:27.060
 a working person from schoolchild to 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:30.409
 professors actually first all the same 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:33.270
 voice recorder is a separate device 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:34.890
 energy independent anything then 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.659
 there he works until the battery sits down 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.909
 if you write important 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.590
 a lecture on a smartphone and this moment 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.370
 the bell rang then your entry and 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.860
 indulge 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.840
 what will not happen to the voice recorder of course 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.930
 don't keep it in the rain or trample 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.710
 kicking is the first second voice recorder 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:55.049
 has mechanical buttons to start 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:58.440
 just press one red button and 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:01.760
 the recording will start and is very convenient right there 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.760
 listen immediately 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.640
 now that is nothing bothers you not 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:10.539
 no need to pick the touchscreen 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:12.220
 you just search for the file you need and 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.340
 almost two two buttons for 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:19.180
 order to record and reproduce 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:21.730
 important record this is the second third many 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:26.080
 voice recorder and supplied elected 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:28.959
 connectors to reset the recorded 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.700
 information on the computer is not enough 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.569
 some voice recorder and even equipped 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.849
 inline 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:37.000
 usb connectors that is not even necessary 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:40.840
 carry with them extra lace this is the third 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.959
 factor 4 of course this is an opportunity 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:46.590
 connect a remote microphone and what is it 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:49.720
 expressed in this model she left 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:52.480
 set just like this here 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.250
 microphone style he is good that you 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.920
 can a tape recorder keep playing in 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:59.709
 jacket pocket but such a style 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:02.560
 microphone portable to clip on 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:04.569
 on say on a tie and on the collar with 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.459
 of this moment you can not bother for 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:09.450
 something that participated in some important 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:12.400
 conversation or briefing you and there 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:15.850
 hibernating megaphone too deep in pocket 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:19.799
 and he will record badly this is the fourth 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:23.049
 Factor 5 of course means that 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:25.120
 voice recorder but still records sounds 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:28.209
 better than applications on any 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:32.470
 smartphone firstly better sense 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:35.609
 format I he can theoretically write 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:38.620
 the claimed recording quality is from 60 to 

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:41.400
 20,000 hertz but u though it is theoretically on 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:44.680
 practice of course the range is narrower 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:46.870
 this is the first second after all even 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.950
 built-in microphone in good voice recorders 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:54.130
 more sensitive and can record 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:57.160
 not even loud spoken words on 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:58.480
 a sufficiently large distance to 10 15 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.120
 meters unlike the same 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.700
 smartphone app that use 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:07.120
 for recording the phone's built-in microphone 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:09.280
 which of course severely limits them 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.890
 quality and range capabilities 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.970
 a record 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:17.450
 and one more fact but the fact that many voice recorder 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:18.829
 and record allows you to record voices 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:21.980
 and sounds format 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:24.890
 uncompressed format wav format still called 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:26.990
 Letters is the format that will allow 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:29.120
 you use recorded files in 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:32.300
 further for mounting there or for 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:34.730
 insert as a separate track in 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:38.090
 any of your movie there or not 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:44.870
 know vlog and so on it too 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:47.300
 important thing among the important useful 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:49.250
 features and i would also note the possibility 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:52.010
 index entry what is it 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:55.640
 expressed let's say you are sitting on important 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:57.760
 the briefing turned on the voice recorder a but the briefing 

00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:00.740
 lasts let's say three hours and then 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:03.650
 unscramble a three-hour record by finding 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:07.240
 there are pearls of very important information 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:09.530
 it's hard to cut and 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.390
 significantly reduce your work time 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:13.690
 with need to decrypt the record 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:16.729
 you simply press a button 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:18.919
 indexing in places where announcer 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:21.440
 says some important information 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:23.150
 subsequently, these indices in the form of pro 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.390
 numbered list will appear your 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:28.250
 voice recorder and recordings you can retell 

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:30.260
 jump while playing from 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:34.940
 one index on another finding those 

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:36.890
 important places in the interlocutor's speech which 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:40.910
 you indexed by clicking on 

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:45.590
 button to tell if a smartphone Well 

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:47.780
 Of course not, and if not such 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:50.540
 not such a raspberry so big feature but 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:52.280
 also worthy of note 

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:54.830
 many voice recorder and equipped 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:57.470
 non-built-in conventional batteries 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:06:01.370
 Mizinchikovye batteries as in ours 

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:02.420
 example than a battery is better than any 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:04.270
 built-in battery 

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:06.790
 well of course it's obvious you can 

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:09.890
 casually asks for a pocket a couple of these 

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:11.740
 Mizinchikovyh batteries and do not be afraid that 

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:14.030
 your voice recorder is the most important moment 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:16.280
 suddenly turn off you immediately replace 

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:20.020
 batteries continue recording here 

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:23.360
 it would seem a trifle but also makes your 

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:26.510
 Your work with the recorder is comfortable and 

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.920
 reliable well actually here's such 

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:31.790
 a short speech appeared to me 

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:35.480
 It turned out for a specific model lf 

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:37.430
 river 655 once again express my point 

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:39.290
 I am still a supporter of view 

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:41.300
 in this case the use is not 

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:43.520
 universal of some kind of solution through 

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:45.170
 smartphone but still separately taken 

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:47.090
 a device that wo n't let you down 

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:49.970
 see which will work independently 

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:51.830
 from that will let you not be called there 

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:55.850
 were sitting there you battery on 

00:06:51.830 --> 00:07:00.010
 the smartphone will not sit thanks for your attention 

00:06:55.850 --> 00:07:00.010
 goodbye to the next and gadgets
