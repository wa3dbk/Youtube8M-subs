00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:27.360
 hello welcome on what side v 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.600
 today still a cooler with 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:32.369
 noctua le nhl did what follows 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.260
 at the new ones we tested 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.410
 recently different design since 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.050
 here we have a fan with a 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.780
 radiator in single turn we stay 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.190
 on 90 92 mm with a ventirad that will 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.860
 make 125 mm in height 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.600
 we can see the fan does not 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.980
 not exceed heat pipes of course if 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.520
 we wish we can always the euro 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.769
 went up a bit 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.420
 however we will not be able to December 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:57.540
 since there is the fixing screw here which 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.040
 go on the system this visit him 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.420
 lets see that normally we say 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.670
 well normally but it's one of 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.350
 product arguments the fan does not 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.300
 will not exceed on memory slots 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.910
 whether on deel intel or md 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.869
 so we can let go with two big 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:13.440
 radiator if needed 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.950
 the fan nf at 9 pwm 2000 turns per 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.450
 minute 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.240
 one thousand five hundred and fifty rounds per 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.570
 minute if we go with the little 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.490
 resistance supplied in bundle 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:29.750
 at the level of heat pipes we have 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:32.039
 five with a v-shape here we have 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:35.130
 a small hole that will allow 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:38.009
 normally to access the screw underneath 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.800
 of the fastening system the finish like 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:43.140
 usually at noctua is excellent 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.630
 there is nothing wrong there then the 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:49.259
 little fingerprints and if we compare 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.429
 the nacelle that is still 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:55.520
 place on our mini-itx motherboard 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:58.590
 we see that it takes so much space 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:01.140
 with a graphics card it's the point 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.090
 very interesting 125 mm that's pretty much 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.739
 the height of a graphics card so we 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.550
 puts in a map we end up with a 

00:02:04.739 --> 00:02:11.750
 completely flat system and suddenly it 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:14.940
 there is no component that blocks the test 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:17.910
 980x of course with 2 9 hours 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.069
 moderate cloaking the one of the nine she us 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.950
 was astonished we will see for this one 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:25.200
 we stay maybe a little more mixed 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.760
 because there is still a lot of 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.739
 cross for the fan who 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.420
 could be a little weak 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.349
 occupies as quickly as possible in 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.469
 waiting we wish you a good ending 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:33.469
 of day
