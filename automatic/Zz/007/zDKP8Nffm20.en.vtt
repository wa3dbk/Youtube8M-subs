00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.930
 first of all I must understand that the window is an important component 

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:07.080
 Wrap 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.070
 eternal decisive component for energy consumption in my home 

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:16.550
 it is an important element for the quality of life in this house 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.570
 because on the window re 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.680
 shoddy here are pro problems hop up rock of winter problems but also problems 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.369
 tested 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:27.329
 and the second departure 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:29.119
 and that I must try to 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:29.960
 me and you 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.189
 to understand 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:33.820
 what is the quality today who 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.900
 I'm almost forced to choose why 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.050
 a product with a certain life span 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.770
 it's not like the phone I bought it and I realize that I don't like it 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.210
 does not work not 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.610
 does not give me this help at this time that I want to have from this device 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.850
 change tomorrow or the day after tomorrow the window that pato better today for 30 years 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:00:59.830
 sara d 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:05.040
 and for 30 years it consumes me energy it sends me my bill continuously 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.080
 energy 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.520
 I realize that in the wrong window it is too late 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:17.620
 for this beagle try to understand what is this quality that today market me 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.350
 offers 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.050
 important for the ecological choice but also for the economic choice 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.140
 because I don't have to know how to pay attention 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.640
 all purchase perry is an expense what counts and the expense i go 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.280
 will produce for the next 30 years 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.280
 and we all know that today's energies 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:39.689
 price 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.539
 kepab today is not the price of tomorrow and never return - to those 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:46.930
 one-time prices because 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.460
 the story is so clear that the era of 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.520
 low price energy 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.670
 it's part of the past 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.580
 for this reason choosing well means choosing intelligently 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.330
 a material who really can provide that quality 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.909
 ely be careful not to trust some 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:12.680
 declaration of a good detail also a nice prospect of the advertisement but 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.590
 that they are benefits 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.049
 I'm so sleepy 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:19.560
 as said of international quality new quality my media 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.619
 and that underlies it disappoints 

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:28.299
 uncontrollable misfortunes that there is truly transparency to be able to 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:30.719
 reconstruct this data that is declared
