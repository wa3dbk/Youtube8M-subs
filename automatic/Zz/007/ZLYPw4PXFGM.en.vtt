00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:13.100
 hello everyone this month from anf la tis 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:18.360
 comparative magazine between the boxster s 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:22.080
 281 generation and the 911 cabriolet 3,4 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:24.960
 generation 991 so the little version of 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.240
 the 911 then a loan at first sight one 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.830
 could it be said is it logical and 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.189
 reasonable to make a comparison between 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.560
 two models whose prices are so 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.810
 spread apart ie we have on one side a 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.789
 model that is worth 68 euros on the other side 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:40.020
 without 2000 euros it's forty two 

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:40.350
 thousand euros difference between these two 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.079
 models 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.910
 and yet you will see that they have 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.050
 full of common points today 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.699
 many people are asking the question 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.410
 precisely to know is it better 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:50.100
 buy a boxster's or a 911 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.230
 convertible 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.750
 the question will obviously not arise 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.519
 if you have children or someone 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.480
 you will definitely need one to his 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:00:57.870
 game for the two small squares to 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.149
 the rear 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.220
 the question will not arise either if 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.860
 you are definitely and 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:09.460
 in a way impossible to change in 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.870
 your amateur opinion of 911 and that there is 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.020
 little notion what matters to you 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:15.820
 is also if you do not have the 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.080
 budget to buy the 911 or someone 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.410
 Anyway you will buy the 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.410
 gangster 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.100
 already we are very very close between 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.140
 two models just a little example here 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.000
 on our vineyard circuit are the 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.650
 stadium time is strictly 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.060
 identical between the two models a 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.030
 minute 20 seconds 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.030
 e 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.320
 performance side happily with its 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.930
 350 horses 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.680
 the 911 also prevail in terms 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.070
 acceleration 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.690
 the boxster him on his side at 315 horses 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:53.050
 so that's thirty five horses 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:54.460
 of difference for 42 thousand euros from 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.040
 difference it does it anyway if they have 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:00.130
 well it's over 1000 euros the 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.840
 horse gap is beautiful the question 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.540
 also arises today because 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.390
 more than ever you are very numerous 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:09.580
 to appreciate the aesthetics of the boxster who 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.190
 has never been so beautiful and the tip 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.540
 between the two lets you know 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.970
 regularly your heart balance 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.010
 so today we will offer ourselves the 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.980
 comparative between the two and have a 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.410
 verdict here we are now around 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.150
 the house and she his strong point but he 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.940
 holds in a magic number it's 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.310
 exactly 900 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.950
 and nothing on this gignac uncertain this 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.790
 according to absolutely not to hesitate a 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.870
 second 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.670
 as we said earlier and 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.740
 do them a 911 and nothing else that 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.370
 it's true sometimes on the plane 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.690
 technical 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.630
 exactly where it is interesting 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.750
 to see if it really brings a plus 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.190
 and if it justifies its price gap 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.690
 its main asset on the plan 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.210
 technique is still its engine of 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.340
 350 horses which allows him to have 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:55.310
 more interesting accelerations the 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.959
 Wednesday that the one your style 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.489
 then in terms of behavior these are 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:01.220
 two different cars that are placed 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:03.770
 differently that provides our both 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:06.349
 much pleasure but side 911 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:09.140
 we vote the nonsense of rigor a 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:12.390
 very little less playful and playful 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.460
 than the boxster but still enjoy 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:17.650
 but this says again it's a 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:20.510
 lesson but that's really this is discussed 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.069
 then the strong points of box earth the 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.550
 first is especially 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:26.420
 his agility 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:30.120
 and still legendary 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:32.690
 very light 320 kg obviously the 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.680
 planting its rear center engine 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.570
 among other benefits allows to have 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.920
 two bodies but that's really his point 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.770
 strong is essential it's his 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.480
 behavior the player side that is 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:44.280
 still as true on the news 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.600
 generations because we feared a 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.820
 little bit porsche having bet in 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.220
 memory the process of the great 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:51.630
 chassis quality end up 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.340
 sanitized a little bit the boxer this is 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:56.100
 not good at all so that's it 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.050
 really what I prefer 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.730
 pleasure to drive his little agility 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.960
 particularity on this one it became 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.460
 very rare it is equipped with a box 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.690
 mechanical most models 

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:06.450
 today come with the dark 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:08.970
 pdk it allowed us to try to 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.530
 timed and especially to feel 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.730
 a very good pleasure because we have a 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.130
 driving position that is enough 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.850
 exceptional flying that approaches the 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.239
 body 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:19.699
 like 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:20.690
 handy in some aspects and a 

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:22.130
 certain moment from what we have 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:23.810
 the impression of being in a small 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:26.080
 rally car and add again 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.080
 at pleasure
