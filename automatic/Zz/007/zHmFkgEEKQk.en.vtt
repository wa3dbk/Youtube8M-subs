amazing like my brother was portion but
I<00:00:23.850> thought<00:00:24.240> I'll<00:00:24.390> try<00:00:24.570> it<00:00:24.689> here<00:00:24.930> with<00:00:25.109> this

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:25.760

I thought I'll try it here with this
micro<00:00:26.760> tech<00:00:26.970> Ultratech<00:00:27.599> with<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.230> bayonet

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
micro tech Ultratech with the bayonet

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.339 
micro tech Ultratech with the bayonet
grind<00:00:28.859> blade<00:00:29.630> and<00:00:30.630> we're<00:00:30.779> going<00:00:30.900> to<00:00:30.960> see<00:00:31.109> how

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
grind blade and we're going to see how

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:41.110 
grind blade and we're going to see how
well<00:00:31.529> it<00:00:31.560> pierces<00:00:32.279> this<00:00:33.030> empty<00:00:33.450> water<00:00:33.690> bottle

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.319 

that's<00:00:42.120> a<00:00:42.239> good<00:00:42.390> one<00:00:43.219> it<00:00:44.219> went<00:00:44.520> in<00:00:44.670> deeper<00:00:45.149> I

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
that's a good one it went in deeper I

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.220 
that's a good one it went in deeper I
suspect<00:00:46.110> but<00:00:46.890> that's<00:00:47.300> at<00:00:48.300> least<00:00:48.360> a<00:00:48.809> two<00:00:48.989> inch

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
suspect but that's at least a two inch

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.420 
suspect but that's at least a two inch
cut<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:50.010> it<00:00:51.000> probably<00:00:51.239> went<00:00:51.600> in<00:00:51.780> at<00:00:51.960> least<00:00:52.430> two

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
cut and it probably went in at least two

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.490 
cut and it probably went in at least two
and<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:53.610> half<00:00:53.760> inches<00:00:54.149> it's<00:00:54.660> hard<00:00:54.899> to<00:00:54.989> tell<00:00:55.199> just

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
and a half inches it's hard to tell just

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.099 
and a half inches it's hard to tell just
by<00:00:55.829> looking<00:00:56.570> but<00:00:58.070> that's<00:00:59.070> what<00:00:59.280> looked<00:00:59.489> like

00:01:00.099 --> 00:01:00.109 
by looking but that's what looked like

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:03.590 
by looking but that's what looked like
so<00:01:01.109> we<00:01:01.410> can<00:01:01.620> come<00:01:02.609> up<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.969> conclusion<00:01:03.570> that

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
so we can come up to the conclusion that

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.179 
so we can come up to the conclusion that
the<00:01:03.960> micro<00:01:04.199> tech<00:01:04.379> ultra<00:01:04.680> tank<00:01:04.920> with<00:01:05.100> the

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
the micro tech ultra tank with the

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.840 
the micro tech ultra tank with the
bayonet<00:01:05.640> style<00:01:05.909> and<00:01:06.570> blade<00:01:06.869> is<00:01:07.260> as<00:01:07.890> good<00:01:08.580> as<00:01:08.820> a

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
bayonet style and blade is as good as a

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.730 
bayonet style and blade is as good as a
thrusting<00:01:09.780> knife<00:01:09.990> as<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.710> portion<00:01:12.650> maybe<00:01:13.650> a

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
thrusting knife as the portion maybe a

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.740 
thrusting knife as the portion maybe a
little<00:01:14.070> bit<00:01:14.189> battle<00:01:14.549> then<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.270> hissatsu

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
little bit battle then the hissatsu

this<00:01:19.650> video<00:01:19.830> I'm<00:01:20.460> out

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:22.549 
this video I'm out

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:25.029 
this video I'm out
all<00:01:23.479> right<00:01:23.780> this<00:01:24.200> is<00:01:24.380> something<00:01:24.710> I<00:01:24.799> didn't

00:01:25.029 --> 00:01:25.039 
all right this is something I didn't

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:30.580 
all right this is something I didn't
notice<00:01:25.369> when<00:01:25.939> I<00:01:27.310> first<00:01:28.310> film<00:01:29.000> this<00:01:29.179> video<00:01:29.590> but

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
notice when I first film this video but

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.709 
notice when I first film this video but
the<00:01:30.890> knife<00:01:31.070> actually<00:01:31.429> went<00:01:31.850> through<00:01:31.909> both

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:32.719 
the knife actually went through both

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:35.050 
the knife actually went through both
ends<00:01:33.079> there<00:01:33.890> was<00:01:33.979> a<00:01:34.009> hole<00:01:34.250> right<00:01:34.490> there<00:01:34.549> and

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
ends there was a hole right there and

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.109 
ends there was a hole right there and
there<00:01:35.929> was<00:01:36.020> a<00:01:36.079> hole<00:01:36.259> right<00:01:36.289> there

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:37.119 
there was a hole right there

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:39.940 
there was a hole right there
so<00:01:38.119> the<00:01:38.359> knife<00:01:38.509> actually<00:01:38.780> purist<00:01:39.350> all<00:01:39.560> the<00:01:39.829> way

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
so the knife actually purist all the way

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.380 
so the knife actually purist all the way
through<00:01:40.509> so<00:01:41.509> I'm<00:01:41.959> pretty<00:01:42.170> happy<00:01:42.439> with<00:01:42.679> that<00:01:42.740> I

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
through so I'm pretty happy with that I

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.300 
through so I'm pretty happy with that I
guess<00:01:44.390> this<00:01:44.600> is<00:01:44.810> a<00:01:45.939> superior<00:01:46.939> thrusting<00:01:47.539> knife

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
guess this is a superior thrusting knife

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.230 
guess this is a superior thrusting knife
and<00:01:49.310> I<00:01:51.399> sorry<00:01:52.399> I<00:01:52.490> can't<00:01:52.700> talk
