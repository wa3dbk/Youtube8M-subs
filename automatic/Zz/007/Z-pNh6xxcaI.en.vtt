i think levant end down and then produce
on<00:00:44.489> my<00:00:44.579> best<00:00:44.820> stuff<00:00:45.230> you<00:00:46.230> know<00:00:46.350> but<00:00:46.530> I<00:00:46.559> felt<00:00:46.829> the

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
on my best stuff you know but I felt the

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.500 
on my best stuff you know but I felt the
best<00:00:47.070> in<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.370> match<00:00:47.520> when<00:00:47.789> it<00:00:47.879> was<00:00:47.969> like<00:00:48.120> 11<00:00:48.180> or

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
best in the match when it was like 11 or

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.540 
best in the match when it was like 11 or
12<00:00:48.750> or<00:00:48.930> which<00:00:49.200> doesn't<00:00:49.980> make<00:00:50.039> sense<00:00:50.280> really

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
12 or which doesn't make sense really

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.799 
12 or which doesn't make sense really
