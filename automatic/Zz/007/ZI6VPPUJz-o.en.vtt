the<00:00:06.089> World<00:00:06.299> Campus<00:00:06.750> robot<00:00:07.610> that's<00:00:08.610> right<00:00:08.940> i

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
the World Campus robot that's right i

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.950 
the World Campus robot that's right i
just<00:00:09.870> paid<00:00:10.050> myself<00:00:10.500> that<00:00:10.710> on<00:00:10.980> the<00:00:11.550> interweb<00:00:12.269> by

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
just paid myself that on the interweb by

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.720 
just paid myself that on the interweb by
robot<00:00:13.410> and<00:00:14.540> not<00:00:15.540> quite<00:00:15.750> sure<00:00:15.780> what<00:00:16.080> that<00:00:16.109> was

and it's amazing alright today we're

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.050 
and it's amazing alright today we're
moving<00:00:24.689> on<00:00:24.810> to<00:00:25.019> robot<00:00:25.590> basics<00:00:26.250> so<00:00:26.519> today<00:00:26.849> what

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
moving on to robot basics so today what

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.970 
moving on to robot basics so today what
we're<00:00:27.210> going<00:00:27.240> to<00:00:27.420> do<00:00:27.570> is<00:00:27.840> get<00:00:27.990> started<00:00:28.619> and

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
we're going to do is get started and

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.919 
we're going to do is get started and
some<00:00:29.369> of<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.550> basic<00:00:29.880> concepts<00:00:30.480> of<00:00:30.599> what<00:00:30.630> it<00:00:30.869> is

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
some of the basic concepts of what it is

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.040 
some of the basic concepts of what it is
to<00:00:30.990> do<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.410> robot<00:00:31.619> or<00:00:32.630> animatronics<00:00:33.630> for<00:00:33.870> some

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
to do the robot or animatronics for some

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.660 
to do the robot or animatronics for some
people<00:00:34.200> call<00:00:34.500> it<00:00:34.530> you<00:00:35.070> want<00:00:35.219> to<00:00:35.250> work<00:00:35.399> in<00:00:35.550> your

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
people call it you want to work in your

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.400 
people call it you want to work in your
dime<00:00:35.910> stops<00:00:36.329> there's<00:00:36.660> a<00:00:36.750> link<00:00:36.930> down<00:00:37.170> there

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
dime stops there's a link down there

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.410 
dime stops there's a link down there
hopefully<00:00:37.770> i'll<00:00:37.860> put<00:00:38.040> that<00:00:38.070> up<00:00:38.340> i<00:00:38.579> normally

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
hopefully i'll put that up i normally

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.889 
hopefully i'll put that up i normally
forget<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:40.850> work<00:00:41.850> on<00:00:42.059> that<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.540> that's<00:00:42.750> a

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
forget and work on that and that's a

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.930 
forget and work on that and that's a
good<00:00:43.140> technique<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:43.620> have<00:00:43.980> when<00:00:44.430> you<00:00:44.550> move<00:00:44.760> on

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
good technique to have when you move on

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.729 
good technique to have when you move on
to<00:00:45.210> this<00:00:45.390> because<00:00:45.840> it's<00:00:46.020> all<00:00:46.170> about<00:00:46.350> muscle

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
to this because it's all about muscle

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.069 
to this because it's all about muscle
control<00:00:47.070> it's<00:00:47.340> not<00:00:47.550> using<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.629> popping

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
control it's not using the popping

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.020 
control it's not using the popping
techniques<00:00:49.469> so<00:00:49.649> much<00:00:49.800> as<00:00:50.039> using<00:00:50.670> muscle

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
techniques so much as using muscle

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.020 
techniques so much as using muscle
control<00:00:51.480> all<00:00:52.050> right<00:00:52.289> to<00:00:52.559> start<00:00:52.890> off<00:00:53.070> one<00:00:54.000> of

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
control all right to start off one of

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.299 
control all right to start off one of
the<00:00:54.180> main<00:00:54.360> things<00:00:54.690> about<00:00:55.190> animatronics<00:00:56.190> or

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
the main things about animatronics or

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:03.340 
the main things about animatronics or
the<00:00:56.399> robot<00:00:56.610> the<00:01:01.430> freaking<00:01:02.430> cat<00:01:02.640> so<00:01:02.879> much

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
the robot the freaking cat so much

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.469 
the robot the freaking cat so much
anyway<00:01:04.350> first<00:01:05.010> thing<00:01:05.250> you<00:01:05.790> want<00:01:05.939> to<00:01:05.970> have<00:01:06.119> no

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
anyway first thing you want to have no

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.300 
anyway first thing you want to have no
expression<00:01:06.869> on<00:01:07.080> your<00:01:07.200> face<00:01:07.260> you've<00:01:08.010> got<00:01:08.189> to

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
expression on your face you've got to

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.460 
expression on your face you've got to
really<00:01:08.549> take<00:01:09.000> that<00:01:09.240> out<00:01:09.420> all<00:01:09.780> right<00:01:09.930> really

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
really take that out all right really

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.840 
really take that out all right really
blank<00:01:10.740> facial<00:01:11.130> expression<00:01:11.580> because<00:01:11.760> the

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
blank facial expression because the

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.969 
blank facial expression because the
robot<00:01:12.210> doesn't<00:01:12.390> have<00:01:12.630> facial<00:01:12.780> expressions<00:01:13.409> so

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
robot doesn't have facial expressions so

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.230 
robot doesn't have facial expressions so
you<00:01:14.040> can<00:01:14.189> clench<00:01:14.400> your<00:01:14.460> jaw<00:01:14.700> a<00:01:14.729> little<00:01:14.850> bit<00:01:15.150> if

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
you can clench your jaw a little bit if

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.420 
you can clench your jaw a little bit if
you<00:01:15.330> have<00:01:15.479> to<00:01:15.799> we're<00:01:16.799> going<00:01:16.920> to<00:01:16.979> start<00:01:17.130> really

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
you have to we're going to start really

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.310 
you have to we're going to start really
solid<00:01:17.820> stance<00:01:18.060> clenching<00:01:18.750> your<00:01:18.780> legs<00:01:19.110> and

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
solid stance clenching your legs and

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.679 
solid stance clenching your legs and
your<00:01:19.470> core<00:01:19.530> muscles<00:01:19.939> tense<00:01:20.939> all<00:01:21.180> those<00:01:21.420> to

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
your core muscles tense all those to

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.960 
your core muscles tense all those to
give<00:01:21.810> you<00:01:21.930> a<00:01:21.960> real<00:01:22.229> still<00:01:22.590> look<00:01:22.890> now<00:01:23.820> we're

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
give you a real still look now we're

give you a real still look now we're
going<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:24.119> move<00:01:24.180> that<00:01:24.479> arm<00:01:24.780> up<00:01:25.020> just<00:01:25.500> working

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
going to move that arm up just working

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.640 
going to move that arm up just working
on<00:01:25.890> a<00:01:25.950> rotation<00:01:26.610> technique<00:01:27.090> in<00:01:27.350> this<00:01:28.350> can<00:01:28.530> be

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
on a rotation technique in this can be

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.350 
on a rotation technique in this can be
applied<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:29.100> any<00:01:29.280> body<00:01:29.460> part<00:01:29.790> but<00:01:30.180> we're<00:01:30.329> just

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
applied to any body part but we're just

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.450 
applied to any body part but we're just
going<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.659> use<00:01:30.780> our<00:01:30.900> arms<00:01:31.079> for<00:01:31.380> today<00:01:31.619> I<00:01:31.860> want

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
going to use our arms for today I want

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.340 
going to use our arms for today I want
you<00:01:32.579> guys<00:01:32.729> to<00:01:32.909> think<00:01:32.939> of<00:01:33.450> locking<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.110> whole

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
you guys to think of locking the whole

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.760 
you guys to think of locking the whole
arm<00:01:34.619> in<00:01:35.070> and<00:01:35.490> you're<00:01:36.210> only<00:01:36.479> rotating<00:01:37.079> from<00:01:37.530> the

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
arm in and you're only rotating from the

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.210 
arm in and you're only rotating from the
shoulder<00:01:38.299> okay<00:01:39.299> like<00:01:39.840> a<00:01:39.869> robot<00:01:40.320> rotation

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
shoulder okay like a robot rotation

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.340 
shoulder okay like a robot rotation
points<00:01:41.579> yeah<00:01:42.270> so<00:01:42.540> you're<00:01:42.659> rotating<00:01:42.840> from<00:01:43.259> the

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
points yeah so you're rotating from the

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.319 
points yeah so you're rotating from the
shoulder<00:01:43.680> everything<00:01:44.130> stays<00:01:44.340> still<00:01:44.610> rotate

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
shoulder everything stays still rotate

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.480 
shoulder everything stays still rotate
up<00:01:45.509> and<00:01:45.869> stop<00:01:46.229> going<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:47.009> be<00:01:47.070> really

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
up and stop going to be really

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.380 
up and stop going to be really
definitive<00:01:47.759> on<00:01:48.270> your<00:01:48.570> stops<00:01:48.990> so<00:01:50.210> nothing<00:01:51.210> else

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
definitive on your stops so nothing else

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.210 
definitive on your stops so nothing else
moves<00:01:51.780> otherwise<00:01:52.500> you're<00:01:52.649> going<00:01:52.740> to<00:01:52.799> lose<00:01:52.979> the

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
moves otherwise you're going to lose the

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.490 
moves otherwise you're going to lose the
illusion<00:01:53.670> just<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.450> arm<00:01:54.659> moves<00:01:54.990> one<00:01:55.290> at<00:01:55.409> a

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
illusion just the arm moves one at a

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.950 
illusion just the arm moves one at a
time<00:01:55.740> up<00:01:56.070> up<00:01:56.310> down<00:01:56.549> down<00:01:56.579> do<00:01:57.450> this<00:01:57.570> a<00:01:57.719> few<00:01:57.750> times

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
time up up down down do this a few times

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.330 
time up up down down do this a few times
watch<00:01:58.469> yourself<00:01:58.799> in<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.009> mirror<00:01:59.159> it's

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
watch yourself in the mirror it's

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.859 
watch yourself in the mirror it's
something<00:01:59.670> that<00:01:59.820> you<00:01:59.850> can<00:02:00.210> see<00:02:00.450> do<00:02:00.659> you<00:02:00.750> look

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
something that you can see do you look

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.319 
something that you can see do you look
like<00:02:00.930> a<00:02:01.079> robot<00:02:01.530> or<00:02:01.649> don't<00:02:01.979> you<00:02:02.159> you<00:02:02.909> can<00:02:03.090> be<00:02:03.210> the

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
like a robot or don't you you can be the

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.700 
like a robot or don't you you can be the
judge<00:02:04.250> alright<00:02:05.250> so<00:02:06.149> that's<00:02:06.329> the<00:02:06.570> very<00:02:07.079> basics

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
judge alright so that's the very basics

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.520 
judge alright so that's the very basics
of<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:08.610> robot<00:02:08.970> or<00:02:09.209> animatronics<00:02:09.959> here<00:02:10.170> old

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
of the robot or animatronics here old

of the robot or animatronics here old
school

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
school

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:12.750 
school
now<00:02:11.680> we're<00:02:11.800> going<00:02:11.920> to<00:02:11.980> make<00:02:12.070> a<00:02:12.130> little<00:02:12.340> combo

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
now we're going to make a little combo

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.520 
now we're going to make a little combo
that<00:02:12.790> looks<00:02:13.120> like<00:02:13.270> this<00:02:13.480> it's<00:02:14.200> going<00:02:14.320> to<00:02:14.350> add

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
that looks like this it's going to add

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.530 
that looks like this it's going to add
an<00:02:14.710> isolation<00:02:15.460> of<00:02:15.640> the<00:02:15.730> head<00:02:16.060> in<00:02:16.180> there<00:02:16.360> a

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
an isolation of the head in there a

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.330 
an isolation of the head in there a
really<00:02:16.870> simple<00:02:17.170> one<00:02:17.350> now<00:02:17.650> watching<00:02:17.830> it<00:02:18.040> slowly

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
really simple one now watching it slowly

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.940 
really simple one now watching it slowly
we're<00:02:18.910> going<00:02:19.030> to<00:02:19.120> start<00:02:19.300> with<00:02:19.390> one<00:02:19.660> arm<00:02:19.950> second

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
we're going to start with one arm second

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.860 
we're going to start with one arm second
arm<00:02:21.100> comes<00:02:21.340> up<00:02:21.520> your<00:02:21.970> heads<00:02:22.210> going<00:02:22.390> to<00:02:22.450> turn<00:02:22.690> to

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
arm comes up your heads going to turn to

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.360 
arm comes up your heads going to turn to
the<00:02:22.990> front<00:02:23.200> you're<00:02:23.950> going<00:02:24.070> to<00:02:24.130> turn<00:02:24.310> your

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
the front you're going to turn your

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.730 
the front you're going to turn your
shoulders<00:02:24.910> to<00:02:25.090> meet<00:02:25.360> so<00:02:25.930> your<00:02:26.110> torso<00:02:26.410> is

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
shoulders to meet so your torso is

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.250 
shoulders to meet so your torso is
isolated<00:02:27.430> there<00:02:27.640> from<00:02:28.540> your<00:02:28.720> head<00:02:28.960> and<00:02:29.170> then

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
isolated there from your head and then

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.980 
isolated there from your head and then
you<00:02:29.920> go<00:02:30.070> back<00:02:30.100> same<00:02:30.760> thing<00:02:31.060> torso<00:02:31.720> moves

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
you go back same thing torso moves

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:33.780 
you go back same thing torso moves
across<00:02:32.260> and<00:02:32.560> the<00:02:32.740> arms<00:02:33.100> are<00:02:33.190> locked<00:02:33.370> in<00:02:33.610> with

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
across and the arms are locked in with

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.000 
across and the arms are locked in with
the<00:02:33.910> torso<00:02:34.300> so<00:02:34.510> the<00:02:34.630> arms<00:02:34.900> stay<00:02:35.080> still<00:02:35.410> now<00:02:35.950> the

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
the torso so the arms stay still now the

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.030 
the torso so the arms stay still now the
camera<00:02:36.400> is<00:02:36.460> out<00:02:36.520> of<00:02:36.580> focus<00:02:36.700> I<00:02:37.150> apologize

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
camera is out of focus I apologize

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.410 
camera is out of focus I apologize
another<00:02:39.040> technique<00:02:39.310> but<00:02:39.850> when<00:02:40.000> you're<00:02:40.180> doing

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
another technique but when you're doing

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.120 
another technique but when you're doing
this<00:02:40.540> little<00:02:40.810> combo<00:02:41.110> that<00:02:41.140> I<00:02:41.380> want<00:02:41.740> you<00:02:41.800> to<00:02:41.920> add

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
this little combo that I want you to add

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.250 
this little combo that I want you to add
is<00:02:42.400> not<00:02:42.640> a<00:02:42.670> massive<00:02:43.090> pot<00:02:43.270> just<00:02:43.660> a<00:02:43.780> little<00:02:44.140> one

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
is not a massive pot just a little one

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.800 
is not a massive pot just a little one
yeah<00:02:44.740> just<00:02:45.100> test<00:02:45.370> the<00:02:45.520> water<00:02:45.700> so<00:02:46.300> a<00:02:46.330> little<00:02:46.570> pop

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
yeah just test the water so a little pop

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.230 
yeah just test the water so a little pop
to<00:02:46.930> start<00:02:47.230> and<00:02:47.410> finish<00:02:47.440> the<00:02:47.950> movement<00:02:48.460> you<00:02:49.120> can

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.240 
to start and finish the movement you can

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.940 
to start and finish the movement you can
see<00:02:49.450> it<00:02:49.570> just<00:02:49.720> gives<00:02:49.870> it<00:02:49.960> a<00:02:50.080> little<00:02:50.350> if<00:02:50.650> you<00:02:50.800> can

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
see it just gives it a little if you can

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.160 
see it just gives it a little if you can
see<00:02:51.190> it's<00:02:51.370> a<00:02:51.460> bit<00:02:51.610> foggy<00:02:51.880> gives<00:02:52.810> it<00:02:52.930> a<00:02:53.020> little

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
see it's a bit foggy gives it a little

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.930 
see it's a bit foggy gives it a little
bit<00:02:53.410> more<00:02:53.560> of<00:02:53.620> a<00:02:53.740> robotic<00:02:53.950> looked<00:02:54.610> a<00:02:54.790> little

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
bit more of a robotic looked a little

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:05.930 
bit more of a robotic looked a little
bit<00:02:55.180> kind<00:02:55.960> of<00:02:56.110> gets<00:02:56.670> type<00:02:57.670> thing<00:02:58.170> check<00:02:59.170> that

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.410 

robot<00:03:06.940> check<00:03:07.300> me<00:03:07.480> out<00:03:07.890> yeah<00:03:09.210> another<00:03:10.210> thing

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
robot check me out yeah another thing

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.570 
robot check me out yeah another thing
you<00:03:10.450> can<00:03:10.630> do<00:03:10.840> to<00:03:10.870> add<00:03:11.200> a<00:03:11.530> different<00:03:11.830> element<00:03:12.160> to

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
you can do to add a different element to

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.840 
you can do to add a different element to
it<00:03:12.700> is<00:03:13.060> at<00:03:13.360> a<00:03:13.390> big<00:03:13.750> leg<00:03:14.110> block<00:03:14.470> at<00:03:14.740> the<00:03:15.370> end<00:03:15.610> of

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
it is at a big leg block at the end of

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:17.220 
it is at a big leg block at the end of
the<00:03:16.000> movements<00:03:16.450> kind<00:03:16.690> of<00:03:16.750> giving<00:03:16.990> it<00:03:17.080> like<00:03:17.200> a

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
the movements kind of giving it like a

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.560 
the movements kind of giving it like a
full<00:03:17.500> stop<00:03:17.830> and<00:03:18.100> that's<00:03:18.880> the<00:03:19.030> technique<00:03:19.330> will

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
full stop and that's the technique will

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.750 
full stop and that's the technique will
move<00:03:19.720> on<00:03:19.900> to<00:03:20.020> in<00:03:20.410> other<00:03:20.710> tutorials<00:03:20.950> but<00:03:21.610> you

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
move on to in other tutorials but you

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.460 
move on to in other tutorials but you
can<00:03:21.910> play<00:03:22.060> with<00:03:22.210> it<00:03:22.330> for<00:03:22.390> now<00:03:22.570> we're<00:03:23.290> going<00:03:23.410> to

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
can play with it for now we're going to

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.710 
can play with it for now we're going to
move<00:03:23.530> on<00:03:23.740> to<00:03:23.770> a<00:03:23.920> rotation<00:03:24.700> now<00:03:24.910> so<00:03:25.390> the<00:03:25.510> arm

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
move on to a rotation now so the arm

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.720 
move on to a rotation now so the arm
comes<00:03:25.810> up<00:03:26.200> now<00:03:26.770> the<00:03:26.830> wrist<00:03:27.190> is<00:03:27.370> going<00:03:27.550> to

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
comes up now the wrist is going to

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.450 
comes up now the wrist is going to
rotate<00:03:28.020> the<00:03:29.020> arm<00:03:29.260> stays<00:03:29.530> completely<00:03:30.040> still

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:30.460 
rotate the arm stays completely still

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:32.850 
rotate the arm stays completely still
you<00:03:31.030> come<00:03:31.270> up<00:03:31.450> rotate<00:03:31.810> from<00:03:32.140> the<00:03:32.230> shoulder<00:03:32.590> and

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
you come up rotate from the shoulder and

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.130 
you come up rotate from the shoulder and
rotate<00:03:33.400> the<00:03:33.520> wrist<00:03:33.760> everything<00:03:34.690> stays<00:03:34.900> still

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
rotate the wrist everything stays still

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.690 
rotate the wrist everything stays still
that's<00:03:35.530> a<00:03:35.680> close-up<00:03:35.950> now<00:03:36.430> we're<00:03:36.550> going<00:03:36.640> to

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
that's a close-up now we're going to

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.040 
that's a close-up now we're going to
move<00:03:36.760> the<00:03:36.940> back<00:03:37.150> we're<00:03:37.600> going<00:03:37.720> to<00:03:37.780> do<00:03:37.900> that

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.050 
move the back we're going to do that

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:41.220 
move the back we're going to do that
once<00:03:38.230> with<00:03:38.410> each<00:03:38.620> arm<00:03:38.920> so<00:03:39.280> arm<00:03:39.850> comes<00:03:40.240> up<00:03:40.420> stops

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
once with each arm so arm comes up stops

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.000 
once with each arm so arm comes up stops
rotate<00:03:42.010> stop<00:03:42.520> second<00:03:43.209> arm<00:03:43.390> up<00:03:43.660> rotate<00:03:44.530> stop

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
rotate stop second arm up rotate stop

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:51.840 
rotate stop second arm up rotate stop
and<00:03:45.670> then<00:03:45.910> continue<00:03:46.620> front<00:03:50.459> so<00:03:51.459> this<00:03:51.670> little
