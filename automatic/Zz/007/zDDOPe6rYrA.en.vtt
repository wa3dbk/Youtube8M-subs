00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
know it's even though the reloading is a

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.369 
know it's even though the reloading is a
little<00:00:39.120> bit<00:00:39.329> faster<00:00:39.780> than<00:00:39.899> it<00:00:40.020> wasn't<00:00:40.290> bad

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
little bit faster than it wasn't bad

company<00:00:40.860> 2<00:00:41.010> you<00:00:41.520> don't<00:00:41.790> want<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:42.149> you<00:00:42.989> know

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
company 2 you don't want to you know

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.990 
company 2 you don't want to you know
basically<00:00:43.350> yum<00:00:45.710> put<00:00:46.710> yourself<00:00:47.520> I<00:00:47.640> still<00:00:47.969> a

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
basically yum put yourself I still a

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.580 
basically yum put yourself I still a
disadvantage<00:00:48.629> because<00:00:48.809> even<00:00:49.260> though<00:00:49.379> it's

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
disadvantage because even though it's

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.979 
disadvantage because even though it's
faster<00:00:50.070> it's<00:00:50.430> not<00:00:50.789> as<00:00:51.030> fast<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.570> be<00:00:51.600> able<00:00:51.780> to

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
faster it's not as fast to be able to

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.470 
faster it's not as fast to be able to
you<00:00:52.469> know<00:00:52.620> reloj<00:00:53.250> like<00:00:53.579> if<00:00:53.820> you<00:00:53.940> had<00:00:54.059> slide<00:00:54.449> a

you know reloj like if you had slide a
hand<00:00:54.600> for<00:00:55.020> instance<00:00:55.410> so<00:00:55.590> you<00:00:56.100> know<00:00:56.219> you're

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
hand for instance so you know you're

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:57.770 
hand for instance so you know you're
gonna<00:00:56.520> be<00:00:56.670> put<00:00:56.850> as<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:57.000> disadvantage<00:00:57.690> as

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
there so that's just a quick example now

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.050 
there so that's just a quick example now
that<00:01:28.590> was<00:01:28.920> um<00:01:29.280> an<00:01:29.990> extreme<00:01:30.990> situation<00:01:31.790> but<00:01:32.790> it

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
that was um an extreme situation but it

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.530 
that was um an extreme situation but it
gets<00:01:33.420> even<00:01:33.720> worse<00:01:34.320> like<00:01:34.920> I've<00:01:35.100> literally<00:01:35.540> died

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
gets even worse like I've literally died

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.859 
gets even worse like I've literally died
by<00:01:36.810> someone<00:01:37.320> and<00:01:37.560> I've<00:01:38.159> spawn<00:01:38.640> no<00:01:39.299> lie<00:01:39.479> right

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
by someone and I've spawn no lie right

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.440 
by someone and I've spawn no lie right
behind<00:01:40.290> them<00:01:40.560> so<00:01:40.740> you<00:01:41.490> know<00:01:41.670> I<00:01:41.880> don't<00:01:42.030> know

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
behind them so you know I don't know

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.889 
behind them so you know I don't know
what<00:01:42.990> it<00:01:43.110> is<00:01:43.140> um<00:01:43.680> with<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.430> spawns<00:01:44.880> but<00:01:45.869> I

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
what it is um with the spawns but I

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.950 
what it is um with the spawns but I
guess<00:01:46.140> they<00:01:46.380> not<00:01:46.590> use<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:47.130> this<00:01:47.970> TDM<00:01:48.509> system

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
guess they not use the this TDM system

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.660 
guess they not use the this TDM system
because<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.320> tedium<00:01:49.890> is<00:01:50.009> a<00:01:50.070> new<00:01:50.250> game<00:01:50.460> mode

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
because the tedium is a new game mode

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.870 
because the tedium is a new game mode
they<00:01:50.790> added<00:01:51.409> to<00:01:52.409> this<00:01:52.530> game<00:01:52.829> to<00:01:53.100> a<00:01:53.130> battlefield

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
they added to this game to a battlefield

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.600 
they added to this game to a battlefield
3<00:01:54.299> I<00:01:54.500> guess<00:01:55.500> then<00:01:55.649> I<00:01:55.710> eat<00:01:55.920> dinner<00:01:56.280> they<00:01:56.490> haven't

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
3 I guess then I eat dinner they haven't

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.420 
3 I guess then I eat dinner they haven't
gotten<00:01:56.820> spawns<00:01:57.090> right<00:01:57.329> it's<00:01:58.020> pretty<00:01:58.860> obvious

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
gotten spawns right it's pretty obvious

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.100 
gotten spawns right it's pretty obvious
they<00:01:59.579> haven't<00:01:59.790> gotten<00:01:59.909> spawns<00:02:00.180> right<00:02:00.390> I'm<00:02:00.930> so

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
they haven't gotten spawns right I'm so

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.270 
they haven't gotten spawns right I'm so
hopefully<00:02:01.380> they'll<00:02:01.500> get<00:02:01.590> a<00:02:01.649> patch<00:02:01.890> up<00:02:02.100> for

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
hopefully they'll get a patch up for

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.420 
hopefully they'll get a patch up for
that<00:02:02.399> I'm<00:02:02.579> not<00:02:02.729> complaining<00:02:03.210> um

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
that I'm not complaining um

of decent um unless you get those
situations<00:02:45.020> like<00:02:45.080> I<00:02:45.290> put<00:02:45.590> up<00:02:45.739> with<00:02:46.220> my

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
situations like I put up with my

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.560 
situations like I put up with my
dedicated<00:02:47.470> servers<00:02:48.470> my<00:02:48.709> nuts<00:02:49.040> video<00:02:49.550> where<00:02:50.510> I

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
dedicated servers my nuts video where I

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.870 
dedicated servers my nuts video where I
quickly<00:02:50.959> showed<00:02:51.200> two<00:02:51.470> examples<00:02:52.040> of<00:02:52.190> when<00:02:52.610> the

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
quickly showed two examples of when the

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.550 
quickly showed two examples of when the
dedicated<00:02:53.420> servers<00:02:53.900> look<00:02:54.620> more<00:02:54.890> like<00:02:55.040> host

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
dedicated servers look more like host

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.080 
dedicated servers look more like host
gameplay<00:02:57.560> instead<00:02:57.860> of<00:02:57.950> dedicated<00:02:58.459> servers<00:02:58.880> I

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
gameplay instead of dedicated servers I

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.970 
gameplay instead of dedicated servers I
saw<00:02:59.750> the<00:02:59.810> guy<00:02:59.989> first<00:03:00.260> and<00:03:00.380> he<00:03:00.530> was<00:03:00.680> still<00:03:00.860> able
