of our blog will be in writing about our
homesteading<00:00:14.930> experiences<00:00:15.619> so<00:00:16.219> today<00:00:16.460> we're

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:16.699 
homesteading experiences so today we're

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:20.050 
homesteading experiences so today we're
here<00:00:17.090> to<00:00:17.600> harvest<00:00:17.900> honey<00:00:18.170> without<00:00:18.740> using<00:00:19.460> the

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:20.060 
here to harvest honey without using the

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:21.970 
here to harvest honey without using the
standard<00:00:20.539> honey<00:00:20.900> harvesting<00:00:21.410> equipment<00:00:21.529> like

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:21.980 
standard honey harvesting equipment like

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.400 
standard honey harvesting equipment like
a<00:00:22.009> centrifuge<00:00:22.429> we<00:00:23.390> didn't<00:00:23.869> want<00:00:24.050> to<00:00:24.109> make<00:00:24.230> that

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:24.410 
a centrifuge we didn't want to make that

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.279 
a centrifuge we didn't want to make that
investment<00:00:24.560> we're<00:00:25.220> just<00:00:25.460> home<00:00:26.179> scale<00:00:26.779> honey

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:27.289 
investment we're just home scale honey

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:30.609 
investment we're just home scale honey
producers<00:00:27.800> so<00:00:29.199> here's<00:00:30.199> what<00:00:30.349> we're<00:00:30.439> going<00:00:30.529> to

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:30.619 
producers so here's what we're going to

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:32.830 
producers so here's what we're going to
do<00:00:30.769> we're<00:00:31.009> going<00:00:31.130> to<00:00:31.220> scrape<00:00:31.849> the<00:00:32.150> honey<00:00:32.390> and

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:32.840 
do we're going to scrape the honey and

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.560 
do we're going to scrape the honey and
the<00:00:33.530> wax<00:00:33.739> collect<00:00:34.430> them<00:00:34.550> in<00:00:34.670> these<00:00:34.790> mason<00:00:35.300> jars

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570 
the wax collect them in these mason jars

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.580 
the wax collect them in these mason jars
and<00:00:35.930> then<00:00:36.470> place<00:00:36.860> the<00:00:37.070> mason<00:00:37.460> jars<00:00:37.700> in<00:00:38.090> this

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:38.590 
and then place the mason jars in this

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.160 
and then place the mason jars in this
crock<00:00:39.590> pot<00:00:39.830> at<00:00:40.100> a<00:00:40.670> fixed<00:00:41.150> temperature<00:00:41.390> which

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
crock pot at a fixed temperature which

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.800 
crock pot at a fixed temperature which
we're<00:00:42.440> using<00:00:42.860> a<00:00:43.070> temperature<00:00:43.490> controller<00:00:43.970> to

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:44.810 
we're using a temperature controller to

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:47.590 
we're using a temperature controller to
control<00:00:45.290> and<00:00:45.680> that'll<00:00:46.460> separate<00:00:47.000> out<00:00:47.270> the

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
control and that'll separate out the

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.180 
control and that'll separate out the
honey<00:00:47.810> from<00:00:48.020> the<00:00:48.170> wax<00:00:48.380> which<00:00:48.710> will<00:00:48.890> then<00:00:49.040> be

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
honey from the wax which will then be

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.640 
honey from the wax which will then be
able<00:00:49.280> to<00:00:49.460> strain<00:00:49.820> very<00:00:50.660> simple<00:00:51.110> so<00:00:51.410> I'm<00:00:51.500> going

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:51.650 
able to strain very simple so I'm going

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:52.180 
able to strain very simple so I'm going
to<00:00:51.710> walk<00:00:51.830> you<00:00:51.950> through

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
to walk you through

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:53.710 
to walk you through
for<00:00:52.370> starters<00:00:52.790> again<00:00:53.180> straying<00:00:53.540> from

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:53.720 
for starters again straying from

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.330 
for starters again straying from
traditional<00:00:54.320> equipment<00:00:54.500> I'm<00:00:54.860> using<00:00:55.010> a<00:00:55.160> butter

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.340 
traditional equipment I'm using a butter

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:56.530 
traditional equipment I'm using a butter
knife<00:00:55.400> because<00:00:55.880> it's<00:00:56.030> just<00:00:56.180> my<00:00:56.270> preference

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:56.540 
knife because it's just my preference

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.600 
knife because it's just my preference
it's<00:00:56.960> what<00:00:57.080> I<00:00:57.110> like<00:00:57.290> to<00:00:57.440> work<00:00:57.560> with<00:00:57.620> and<00:00:58.070> I'm

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:58.610 
it's what I like to work with and I'm

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.230 
it's what I like to work with and I'm
scraping<00:00:59.210> the<00:00:59.300> honey<00:00:59.570> off<00:00:59.900> our<00:01:00.610> super<00:01:01.610> with

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:02.240 
scraping the honey off our super with

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.399 
scraping the honey off our super with
the<00:01:02.420> wax<00:01:02.630> and<00:01:02.990> just<00:01:03.290> placing<00:01:03.500> it<00:01:03.770> in<00:01:03.890> this<00:01:04.009> jar

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:05.409 
the wax and just placing it in this jar

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:08.050 
the wax and just placing it in this jar
okay<00:01:06.439> it<00:01:06.590> took<00:01:06.740> me<00:01:06.979> under<00:01:07.310> a<00:01:07.520> minute<00:01:07.789> to<00:01:07.880> fill

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
okay it took me under a minute to fill

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.819 
okay it took me under a minute to fill
this<00:01:08.240> and<00:01:08.479> I'm<00:01:09.020> going<00:01:09.170> to<00:01:09.229> place<00:01:09.409> it<00:01:09.439> now<00:01:09.679> in

00:01:09.819 --> 00:01:09.829 
this and I'm going to place it now in

00:01:09.829 --> 00:01:13.469 
this and I'm going to place it now in
the<00:01:09.920> crock<00:01:10.130> pot<00:01:10.159> so<00:01:11.090> the<00:01:11.479> probe<00:01:11.929> in<00:01:12.320> here<00:01:12.770> is

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:13.479 
the crock pot so the probe in here is

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:16.149 
the crock pot so the probe in here is
reading<00:01:14.479> back<00:01:14.719> the<00:01:14.869> temperature<00:01:15.350> now<00:01:15.920> we're

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159 
reading back the temperature now we're

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:18.700 
reading back the temperature now we're
choosing<00:01:16.520> a<00:01:16.700> temperature<00:01:17.119> of<00:01:17.149> 118<00:01:17.869> degrees<00:01:17.990> to

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
choosing a temperature of 118 degrees to

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.520 
choosing a temperature of 118 degrees to
hold<00:01:19.399> this<00:01:19.549> water<00:01:19.819> at<00:01:20.090> and<00:01:20.359> the<00:01:20.810> reason<00:01:21.109> for<00:01:21.319> it

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
hold this water at and the reason for it

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.800 
hold this water at and the reason for it
is<00:01:21.740> the<00:01:22.549> honey<00:01:22.759> becomes<00:01:23.149> viscous<00:01:23.390> of<00:01:23.689> that

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
is the honey becomes viscous of that

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.779 
is the honey becomes viscous of that
temperature<00:01:24.170> and<00:01:24.530> naturally<00:01:25.280> separates<00:01:25.700> from

00:01:25.779 --> 00:01:25.789 
temperature and naturally separates from

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:28.690 
temperature and naturally separates from
the<00:01:25.969> wax<00:01:26.179> but<00:01:26.960> the<00:01:27.289> most<00:01:27.499> important<00:01:28.009> reason<00:01:28.549> is

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
the wax but the most important reason is

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.609 
the wax but the most important reason is
that<00:01:28.909> it<00:01:29.060> keeps<00:01:29.210> the<00:01:29.359> honey<00:01:29.630> raw<00:01:29.929> so<00:01:30.350> we're<00:01:30.499> not

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
that it keeps the honey raw so we're not

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:32.620 
that it keeps the honey raw so we're not
getting<00:01:30.979> into<00:01:31.130> cooking<00:01:31.670> or<00:01:31.850> pasteurizing<00:01:32.329> and

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
getting into cooking or pasteurizing and

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.289 
getting into cooking or pasteurizing and
that's<00:01:32.749> important<00:01:33.200> to<00:01:33.289> us<00:01:33.380> so<00:01:34.189> um<00:01:34.579> in<00:01:34.969> just<00:01:35.210> a

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:35.299 
that's important to us so um in just a

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:36.669 
that's important to us so um in just a
few<00:01:35.450> minutes<00:01:35.689> we'll<00:01:35.810> check<00:01:35.990> back<00:01:36.020> and<00:01:36.409> see<00:01:36.560> it

00:01:36.669 --> 00:01:36.679 
few minutes we'll check back and see it

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:39.039 
few minutes we'll check back and see it
separate<00:01:37.189> our<00:01:37.460> honey's<00:01:37.789> been<00:01:37.999> sitting<00:01:38.420> for<00:01:38.450> I

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:39.049 
separate our honey's been sitting for I

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:40.660 
separate our honey's been sitting for I
don't<00:01:39.289> know<00:01:39.350> maybe<00:01:39.530> half<00:01:39.799> an<00:01:39.950> hour<00:01:40.100> the

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
don't know maybe half an hour the

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.450 
don't know maybe half an hour the
temperature<00:01:41.299> controller<00:01:41.810> set<00:01:42.619> at<00:01:42.799> 118

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
temperature controller set at 118

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.440 
temperature controller set at 118
degrees<00:01:43.579> and<00:01:44.179> I'm<00:01:44.689> now<00:01:44.869> taking<00:01:44.929> it<00:01:45.499> out<00:01:46.450> and

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
degrees and I'm now taking it out and

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.569 
degrees and I'm now taking it out and
I'm<00:01:47.990> going<00:01:48.170> to<00:01:48.319> strain<00:01:48.619> it<00:01:48.649> just<00:01:49.069> a<00:01:49.159> resemble

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:49.579 
I'm going to strain it just a resemble

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:53.319 
I'm going to strain it just a resemble
strainer<00:01:49.850> into<00:01:50.060> a<00:01:50.179> mason<00:01:50.450> jar<00:01:51.969> you<00:01:52.969> can<00:01:52.999> see

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:53.329 
strainer into a mason jar you can see

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:56.139 
strainer into a mason jar you can see
some<00:01:53.539> of<00:01:53.659> the<00:01:53.719> separation<00:01:54.340> already<00:01:55.340> so<00:01:56.060> I'll

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:56.149 
some of the separation already so I'll

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:05.719 
some of the separation already so I'll
