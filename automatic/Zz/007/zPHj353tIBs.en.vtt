00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.080 
understand if you're commuting my car so
how<00:01:51.960> long<00:01:52.170> you<00:01:52.200> go<00:01:52.590> or<00:01:52.920> how<00:01:53.100> far<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.670> over<00:01:53.880> time

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
how long you go or how far and over time

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.540 
how long you go or how far and over time
so<00:01:54.990> you<00:01:55.050> can<00:01:55.260> see<00:01:55.440> like<00:01:55.740> how<00:01:55.920> long<00:01:56.159> time<00:01:56.400> you

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:56.550 
so you can see like how long time you

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.180 
so you can see like how long time you
spend<00:01:56.790> in<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:56.970> car<00:01:57.200> over<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.320> last<00:01:58.560> week<00:01:58.890> or

00:01:59.180 --> 00:01:59.190 
spend in the car over the last week or

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.700 
spend in the car over the last week or
so<00:01:59.450> if<00:02:00.450> you're<00:02:00.600> commuting<00:02:00.810> by<00:02:00.990> train<00:02:01.020> we<00:02:01.620> do

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
so if you're commuting by train we do

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.130 
so if you're commuting by train we do
train<00:02:01.980> as<00:02:02.130> well<00:02:02.310> so<00:02:03.180> we<00:02:03.390> do<00:02:03.510> all<00:02:03.630> this<00:02:03.750> to<00:02:03.810> paint

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
train as well so we do all this to paint

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.810 
train as well so we do all this to paint
a<00:02:04.260> more<00:02:04.440> holistic<00:02:04.680> picture<00:02:05.100> of<00:02:05.370> your<00:02:05.490> life<00:02:05.700> and

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
a more holistic picture of your life and

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.030 
a more holistic picture of your life and
put<00:02:06.000> everything<00:02:06.270> into<00:02:06.540> context<00:02:07.140> so<00:02:07.680> you<00:02:07.770> step

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:08.040 
put everything into context so you step

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:09.740 
put everything into context so you step
into<00:02:08.250> context<00:02:08.790> so<00:02:08.910> where<00:02:09.090> were<00:02:09.269> you<00:02:09.479> when<00:02:09.630> you

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
into context so where were you when you

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.750 
into context so where were you when you
took<00:02:09.780> those<00:02:10.050> times<00:02:10.320> what<00:02:11.070> music<00:02:11.280> do<00:02:11.640> you

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
took those times what music do you

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.590 
took those times what music do you
listen<00:02:11.880> to<00:02:12.150> when<00:02:12.300> you<00:02:12.390> took<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:12.690> steps

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
listen to when you took the steps

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.560 
listen to when you took the steps
and<00:02:14.320> also<00:02:14.890> like<00:02:15.370> Facebook<00:02:16.000> connections<00:02:16.510> and

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
and also like Facebook connections and

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:17.490 
and also like Facebook connections and
everything<00:02:16.930> you<00:02:17.020> know<00:02:17.080> this<00:02:17.290> would<00:02:17.470> be

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
everything you know this would be

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.970 
everything you know this would be
represented<00:02:18.130> in<00:02:18.160> the<00:02:18.310> application<00:02:19.050> so<00:02:20.050> we<00:02:20.860> do

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
represented in the application so we do

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.580 
represented in the application so we do
this<00:02:21.190> to<00:02:21.400> show<00:02:21.580> more<00:02:22.020> holistic<00:02:23.020> picture<00:02:23.320> of

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
this to show more holistic picture of

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.950 
this to show more holistic picture of
your<00:02:23.740> life<00:02:23.920> rather<00:02:24.430> than<00:02:24.580> boring<00:02:25.480> statistics

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:25.960 
your life rather than boring statistics

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.230 
your life rather than boring statistics
so<00:02:26.620> one<00:02:26.770> example<00:02:26.890> I<00:02:27.250> issues<00:02:27.550> to<00:02:27.910> talk<00:02:28.060> about

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
so one example I issues to talk about

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.980 
so one example I issues to talk about
it's<00:02:28.570> like<00:02:29.430> other<00:02:30.430> devices<00:02:30.850> tell<00:02:31.420> you<00:02:31.570> that

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
it's like other devices tell you that

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:33.540 
it's like other devices tell you that
you<00:02:32.080> took<00:02:32.230> three<00:02:32.470> thousand<00:02:32.830> steps<00:02:33.010> last<00:02:33.280> week

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
you took three thousand steps last week

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.360 
you took three thousand steps last week
but<00:02:34.240> today<00:02:34.660> maybe<00:02:35.050> not<00:02:35.380> easy<00:02:35.860> to<00:02:36.010> understand

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
but today maybe not easy to understand

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.130 
but today maybe not easy to understand
why<00:02:36.700> only<00:02:36.940> took<00:02:37.120> recent<00:02:37.540> step<00:02:37.690> last<00:02:37.930> week

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
why only took recent step last week

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.010 
why only took recent step last week
because<00:02:38.530> or<00:02:39.100> last<00:02:39.490> Tuesday<00:02:39.970> but<00:02:40.570> if<00:02:40.690> you<00:02:40.810> find

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
because or last Tuesday but if you find
