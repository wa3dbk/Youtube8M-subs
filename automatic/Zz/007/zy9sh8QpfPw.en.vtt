00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
is a big oxygen tank machine with like a

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.510 
is a big oxygen tank machine with like a
bunch<00:01:37.380> of<00:01:37.560> tubes<00:01:37.770> coming<00:01:38.159> out<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.400> they're

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
bunch of tubes coming out and they're

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.190 
bunch of tubes coming out and they're
actually<00:01:38.790> little<00:01:39.000> rubber<00:01:39.299> tubes<00:01:39.630> it's<00:01:39.869> really

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200

oxygen<00:01:41.759> tank<00:01:42.390> that<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.869> doll<00:01:43.020> can<00:01:43.170> actually

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
oxygen tank that the doll can actually

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.679 
oxygen tank that the doll can actually
hold<00:01:43.860> in<00:01:44.040> its<00:01:44.159> hand<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:44.850> there's<00:01:45.509> little

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
hold in its hand and there's little

tubes of like medicines and stuff on top

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.999 
tubes of like medicines and stuff on top
so<00:01:48.509> this<00:01:48.659> is<00:01:48.810> like<00:01:48.930> really<00:01:49.259> cool<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:49.770> they<00:01:49.829> put

little stuff of scope and it actually

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.359 
little stuff of scope and it actually
kind<00:02:01.079> of<00:02:01.170> stretches<00:02:01.560> so<00:02:01.799> you<00:02:01.890> can<00:02:02.039> use<00:02:02.220> it

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
kind of stretches so you can use it

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.120 
kind of stretches so you can use it
pretty<00:02:02.579> well<00:02:02.759> and<00:02:03.180> then<00:02:03.840> here<00:02:04.649> is<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:04.890> little

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130

little cast and little head cast and

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.449 
little cast and little head cast and
stuff<00:02:10.289> but<00:02:10.410> you<00:02:10.530> can<00:02:10.619> actually<00:02:10.769> remove<00:02:11.220> them

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
stuff but you can actually remove them

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.250 
stuff but you can actually remove them
they<00:02:11.580> just<00:02:11.760> kind<00:02:11.880> of<00:02:11.940> pop<00:02:12.120> on<00:02:12.330> so<00:02:12.660> there<00:02:12.900> you<00:02:13.019> go

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
they just kind of pop on so there you go

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.620 
they just kind of pop on so there you go

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
and now that all of his casts are off

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.000 
and now that all of his casts are off
you<00:02:15.900> can<00:02:16.050> see<00:02:16.200> what<00:02:16.319> he<00:02:16.380> looks<00:02:16.560> like<00:02:16.650> and<00:02:16.920> then

you can see what he looks like and then

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
you can see what he looks like and then
we'll<00:02:17.069> lay<00:02:17.220> them<00:02:17.340> down<00:02:17.370> on<00:02:17.700> this<00:02:17.790> little

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
we'll lay them down on this little

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.970 
we'll lay them down on this little
medical<00:02:18.269> bed<00:02:18.569> which<00:02:18.780> is<00:02:18.930> super<00:02:19.349> cool<00:02:19.530> it's<00:02:19.800> got

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
medical bed which is super cool it's got

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.729 
medical bed which is super cool it's got
this<00:02:20.069> little<00:02:20.220> attachable<00:02:20.849> light<00:02:21.750> here<00:02:22.380> and<00:02:22.620> it

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
this little attachable light here and it

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:24.650 
this little attachable light here and it
has<00:02:22.890> all<00:02:23.370> these<00:02:23.519> flexible<00:02:24.120> points<00:02:24.510> so<00:02:24.630> that

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
has all these flexible points so that

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.180 
has all these flexible points so that
you<00:02:24.810> can<00:02:25.019> bend<00:02:25.260> it<00:02:25.410> and<00:02:25.620> then<00:02:25.769> you<00:02:25.890> can<00:02:26.010> see

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
you can bend it and then you can see

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.440 
you can bend it and then you can see
there<00:02:26.400> it<00:02:26.489> looks<00:02:26.670> like<00:02:26.760> a<00:02:26.880> bunch<00:02:27.150> of<00:02:27.239> lights

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
there it looks like a bunch of lights

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.120 
there it looks like a bunch of lights
it's<00:02:27.690> super<00:02:28.049> cool<00:02:28.319> and<00:02:28.380> very<00:02:28.799> realistic

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
it's super cool and very realistic

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.580 
it's super cool and very realistic
looking<00:02:29.670> so<00:02:29.790> you<00:02:29.880> can<00:02:30.030> fold<00:02:30.239> it<00:02:30.510> and<00:02:30.810> the

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
looking so you can fold it and the

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.620 
looking so you can fold it and the
medical<00:02:32.010> bed<00:02:32.160> folds<00:02:32.459> itself<00:02:32.970> so<00:02:33.239> here<00:02:33.450> this

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
medical bed folds itself so here this

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.690 
medical bed folds itself so here this
one<00:02:33.840> side<00:02:34.110> pops<00:02:34.410> up<00:02:34.709> and<00:02:35.040> you<00:02:35.220> can<00:02:35.370> pop<00:02:35.489> up<00:02:35.519> the

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
one side pops up and you can pop up the

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.490 
one side pops up and you can pop up the
other<00:02:35.940> side<00:02:36.239> too<00:02:36.420> or<00:02:36.750> you<00:02:36.870> can<00:02:36.989> do<00:02:37.080> both<00:02:37.230> at<00:02:37.410> the

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
other side too or you can do both at the

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.809 
other side too or you can do both at the
same<00:02:37.739> time<00:02:37.980> if<00:02:38.160> you<00:02:38.250> want<00:02:38.370> to<00:02:38.430> like<00:02:38.549> crunch

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
same time if you want to like crunch

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.030 
same time if you want to like crunch
someone<00:02:39.209> and<00:02:39.450> so<00:02:39.989> you<00:02:40.049> can<00:02:40.260> just<00:02:40.290> lay<00:02:40.560> him<00:02:40.680> here

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
someone and so you can just lay him here

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.500 
someone and so you can just lay him here
and<00:02:41.220> then<00:02:41.310> bend<00:02:41.519> one<00:02:41.700> side<00:02:41.940> up<00:02:42.090> and<00:02:42.239> then<00:02:42.330> he

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
and then bend one side up and then he

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.809 
and then bend one side up and then he
can<00:02:42.720> sit<00:02:43.019> upright<00:02:43.200> just<00:02:43.739> like<00:02:44.010> that<00:02:44.250> and<00:02:44.640> then

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
can sit upright just like that and then

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:47.059 
can sit upright just like that and then
you<00:02:45.239> can<00:02:45.420> fold<00:02:45.720> the<00:02:45.900> light<00:02:46.079> down<00:02:46.380> and<00:02:46.799> get<00:02:46.920> like

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
you can fold the light down and get like

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:48.650 
you can fold the light down and get like
a<00:02:47.099> good<00:02:47.310> close-up<00:02:47.579> for<00:02:47.940> the<00:02:48.000> doctor<00:02:48.360> to<00:02:48.480> check

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
a good close-up for the doctor to check
