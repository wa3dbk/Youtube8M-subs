00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
checklist and make sure everything is

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.160 
checklist and make sure everything is
good<00:00:40.760> first<00:00:41.760> thing<00:00:42.000> we're<00:00:42.180> going<00:00:42.329> to<00:00:42.570> check<00:00:42.930> is

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
good first thing we're going to check is

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.520 
good first thing we're going to check is
the<00:00:43.649> theme<00:00:44.780> the<00:00:45.780> seam<00:00:46.020> should<00:00:46.200> not<00:00:46.350> be

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
the theme the seam should not be

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.040 
the theme the seam should not be
noticeable<00:00:47.010> from<00:00:47.789> about<00:00:48.120> two<00:00:48.360> feet<00:00:48.539> away<00:00:48.719> I'm

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
noticeable from about two feet away I'm

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.799 
noticeable from about two feet away I'm
barely<00:00:49.530> able<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:50.010> spot<00:00:50.370> it<00:00:50.520> here<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.120> that's

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
barely able to spot it here and that's

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.799 
barely able to spot it here and that's
because<00:00:52.020> it's<00:00:52.980> smaller<00:00:53.430> than<00:00:53.610> one<00:00:54.180> eighth<00:00:54.480> of

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
because it's smaller than one eighth of

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.740 
because it's smaller than one eighth of
an<00:00:55.020> inch<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.590> also<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.940> epoxy<00:00:57.360> that's<00:00:57.539> used

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
an inch and also the epoxy that's used

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.990 
an inch and also the epoxy that's used
to<00:00:57.989> put<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.350> two<00:00:58.500> pieces<00:00:58.530> together<00:00:59.010> it<00:00:59.430> is

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
to put the two pieces together it is

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.400 
to put the two pieces together it is
colored<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.780> match<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:01.590> stone

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:03.410 
colored to match the stone

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:10.020 
colored to match the stone
and<00:01:03.530> the<00:01:04.010> back<00:01:04.220> one<00:01:04.430> I<00:01:04.460> can't<00:01:04.790> tell<00:01:05.000> at<00:01:05.210> all

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.580 

another<00:01:11.030> thing<00:01:11.299> to<00:01:11.329> check<00:01:11.659> is<00:01:11.840> the<00:01:11.929> sink

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
another thing to check is the sink

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.970 
another thing to check is the sink
reveal<00:01:12.979> the<00:01:13.520> slight<00:01:13.759> /<00:01:14.119> hang<00:01:14.299> around<00:01:14.659> the<00:01:15.020> sink

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:16.980 
reveal the slight / hang around the sink

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:18.980 
reveal the slight / hang around the sink
it<00:01:17.550> should<00:01:17.790> be<00:01:17.820> consistent<00:01:18.300> throughout<00:01:18.750> the

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
it should be consistent throughout the

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.790 
it should be consistent throughout the
and<00:01:20.420> the<00:01:21.420> last<00:01:21.630> thing<00:01:21.900> to<00:01:22.110> check<00:01:22.320> around<00:01:22.530> the

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:22.800 
and the last thing to check around the

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:28.390 
and the last thing to check around the
sink<00:01:23.160> area<00:01:23.340> is<00:01:24.560> the<00:01:25.560> clearance<00:01:25.980> of<00:01:26.160> the<00:01:27.140> faucet

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.400 
sink area is the clearance of the faucet

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.020 
sink area is the clearance of the faucet
so<00:01:29.400> we're<00:01:29.700> going<00:01:29.940> to<00:01:30.150> slide<00:01:30.450> it<00:01:30.510> in<00:01:30.960> and

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
so we're going to slide it in and

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.090 
so we're going to slide it in and
basically<00:01:33.030> what<00:01:33.870> you<00:01:34.020> want<00:01:34.200> to<00:01:34.320> check<00:01:34.680> for<00:01:34.740> it

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
basically what you want to check for it

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.430 
basically what you want to check for it
is<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:36.000> handle<00:01:36.360> operation<00:01:36.930> make<00:01:37.140> sure<00:01:37.290> it's

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:37.440 
is the handle operation make sure it's

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.980 
is the handle operation make sure it's
not<00:01:37.560> hitting<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:37.920> backsplash<00:01:38.490> or<00:01:38.840> the<00:01:39.840> wall

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
not hitting the backsplash or the wall

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.010 
not hitting the backsplash or the wall
behind<00:01:40.170> it<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:41.030> the<00:01:42.030> placement<00:01:42.420> to<00:01:42.690> make<00:01:42.810> sure

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
behind it and the placement to make sure

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.720 
behind it and the placement to make sure
that<00:01:43.320> it<00:01:43.350> rotates<00:01:43.710> accordingly<00:01:44.700> in<00:01:45.390> this<00:01:46.230> case

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:46.730 
that it rotates accordingly in this case

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:52.510 
that it rotates accordingly in this case
we<00:01:47.730> also<00:01:47.940> have<00:01:48.480> a<00:01:49.430> small<00:01:50.810> soap<00:01:51.810> dispenser

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
we also have a small soap dispenser

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.420 
we also have a small soap dispenser
right<00:01:53.520> here<00:01:53.820> which<00:01:54.120> we're<00:01:54.330> going<00:01:54.600> to<00:01:54.750> place

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
right here which we're going to place

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.800 
right here which we're going to place
right<00:01:56.430> here<00:01:56.460> so<00:01:56.820> you<00:01:56.910> want<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.180> make<00:01:57.210> sure<00:01:57.330> that

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
right here so you want to make sure that

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.490 
right here so you want to make sure that
it<00:01:57.840> actually<00:01:58.080> is<00:01:58.560> close<00:01:59.280> enough<00:01:59.430> to<00:01:59.580> the<00:01:59.820> sink

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
it actually is close enough to the sink

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.380 
it actually is close enough to the sink
the<00:02:01.500> next<00:02:01.770> important<00:02:02.160> thing<00:02:02.220> to<00:02:02.490> check<00:02:02.700> is<00:02:02.970> the

the next important thing to check is the

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.050 
the next important thing to check is the
overhang<00:02:04.140> around<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:04.800> cabinets<00:02:05.250> we<00:02:05.820> want<00:02:05.970> to

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
overhang around the cabinets we want to

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.990 
overhang around the cabinets we want to
make<00:02:06.210> sure<00:02:06.240> that<00:02:07.110> it's<00:02:07.350> even<00:02:07.890> on<00:02:08.100> the<00:02:08.850> whole

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
make sure that it's even on the whole

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.590 
make sure that it's even on the whole
length<00:02:12.680> also<00:02:13.680> check<00:02:14.220> to<00:02:14.820> make<00:02:14.970> sure<00:02:15.030> that<00:02:15.540> you

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600
