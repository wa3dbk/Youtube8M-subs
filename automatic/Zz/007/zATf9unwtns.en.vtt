00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.520 
waterproof I can add a 5/16 mounting
bolt<00:00:50.340> so<00:00:50.610> you<00:00:50.700> can<00:00:50.910> mount<00:00:51.090> it<00:00:51.270> to<00:00:51.300> a<00:00:51.780> metal

bolt so you can mount it to a metal

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.290 
bolt so you can mount it to a metal
structure<00:00:53.160> so<00:00:53.340> you<00:00:53.370> can<00:00:53.610> run<00:00:53.789> it<00:00:53.820> out<00:00:54.090> of<00:00:54.239> the

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
structure so you can run it out of the

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.319 
structure so you can run it out of the
water<00:00:54.710> it<00:00:55.710> still<00:00:56.010> is<00:00:56.250> not<00:00:56.430> warm<00:00:56.820> it<00:00:57.059> draws<00:00:57.300> a

water it still is not warm it draws a

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.689 
water it still is not warm it draws a
full<00:00:57.660> three<00:00:58.050> amps<00:00:58.559> which<00:00:59.070> is<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.370> rated

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
full three amps which is the rated

three<00:01:03.270> of<00:01:03.300> these<00:01:03.480> in<00:01:03.780> here<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.290> this<00:01:05.189> thing

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
three of these in here and this thing

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.880 
three of these in here and this thing
basically<00:01:05.930> lights<00:01:06.930> everything<00:01:07.650> up<00:01:07.770> like

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
basically lights everything up like

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.469 
basically lights everything up like
daylight<00:01:08.520> it's<00:01:08.820> a<00:01:09.000> very<00:01:09.510> powerful<00:01:09.840> light<00:01:11.479> I'm

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
daylight it's a very powerful light I'm

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.170 
daylight it's a very powerful light I'm
going<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.750> show<00:01:12.990> you<00:01:13.020> it<00:01:13.320> underwater<00:01:14.180> it's

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
going to show you it underwater it's

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.190 
going to show you it underwater it's
it's<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:16.189> extremely<00:01:17.189> bright<00:01:17.400> light<00:01:17.840> it<00:01:18.840> has<00:01:19.049> an

it's a extremely bright light it has an

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.520 
it's a extremely bright light it has an
incredible<00:01:19.710> throw<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:20.659> it<00:01:21.659> lights<00:01:21.960> up<00:01:22.229> the

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
incredible throw and it lights up the

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.390 
incredible throw and it lights up the
whole<00:01:22.890> pool<00:01:23.250> no<00:01:23.790> problem<00:01:24.860> this<00:01:25.860> light<00:01:26.159> will

whole pool no problem this light will

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.700 
whole pool no problem this light will
light<00:01:26.610> up<00:01:26.790> I'd<00:01:27.030> say<00:01:27.060> all<00:01:28.020> a<00:01:28.080> good<00:01:28.409> hundred

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
light up I'd say all a good hundred

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.030 
light up I'd say all a good hundred
