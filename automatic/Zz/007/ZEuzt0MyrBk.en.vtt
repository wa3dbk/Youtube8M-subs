00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:05.340
 some friends in love with the left 

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.340
 I will present the brand new acquisition 

00:00:09.189 --> 00:00:14.629
 it is a brand-name device so burbure which has the habit of manufacturing 

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:18.050
 xbox and that for 100 m 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:19.589
 on this occasion 

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:22.589
 to make% in the middle of the last century 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.140
 appliances for the sound of the stores 

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:31.060
 and also waiting rooms 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.090
 the of doctors and dentists 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:39.260
 10% and this device is therefore ap the figures of a thousand simply because 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.460
 that it can read 25 discs on which are recorded in the 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.100
 song by face 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.160
 so the whole multiplied by the social dolphins present so miletic 3 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.460
 it could be considered that this is per cent 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.570
 % more mp3 player by his life 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.620
 last century 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.080
 to this device which many us 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.800
 so it's called a patter and music contact unlike the patter a 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.870
 music system that him 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.570
 to belley for 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.290
 a representation a little bit more 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.850
 in a percent aesthetic all this because it was usually found 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.230
 so in the waiting rooms and well the difference% this model has been 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:28.610
 rather hiding it was used in in the back rooms of the 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:29.680
 store 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.030
 so here I am going to give you a demonstration of how this 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.030
 apparatus 

00:02:12.109 --> 00:02:15.109
 that Sens 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:29.299
 the world 

00:02:38.679 --> 00:02:40.620
 these devices were therefore 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.330
 as I told you previously powered by a series of 25 discs m 

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:49.469
 on which is a club by title 

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:53.789
 these ten been provided for this burberry party 

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:58.009
 he was replaced percent every three months does it seem to it by a 

00:02:58.009 --> 00:03:01.009
 new record collection that came in the mail 

00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:06.529
 muller he is father of these machines had so - place the difficulties 

00:03:06.529 --> 00:03:07.479
 to manage 

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:09.359
 return them 

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:14.329
 to target their debts on the farm which blogs all the disputes 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:18.249
 that's why today percent replacing these lists is enough 

00:03:18.249 --> 00:03:22.259
 complicated because they have often been destroyed we still find 

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:24.919
 regularly on the internet 

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:28.889
 and in this case on the international auction site 

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:30.729
 well known 

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:33.049
 thanks for watching 2 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:35.449
 the diet and see you soon
