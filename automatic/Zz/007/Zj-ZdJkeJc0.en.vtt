00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.960
 hi this funky reef blog my name is 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.740
 Ruslan Nikitin today will reef 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.400
 my tones 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:39.180
 using the Phrygian major scale 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.180
 play a riff at a slow pace 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.430
 but 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.230
 changing 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.380
 the Phrygian major scale has the same 

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:25.479
 applicator a different scheme that their 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.270
 harmonic minor in which tonic 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:29.979
 we will take the fifth step 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.569
 from the usual phrygian lada phrygian 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:33.509
 major has a raised third 

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:36.130
 by step 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.899
 the board is dominant and 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.750
 sounds great on dominant chord 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:43.590
 the whole reef is based on it or rather 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.880
 triton you interval from this chord 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.859
 if you do not all understand that I 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.140
 told frets subscribe to my 

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:51.219
 The channel of the next releases will be disassembled 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.009
