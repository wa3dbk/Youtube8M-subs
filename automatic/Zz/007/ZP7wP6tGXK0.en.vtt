red green yellow blue whatever okay

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:26.330 
red green yellow blue whatever okay
obviously<00:01:25.409> they'll<00:01:25.590> train<00:01:25.860> your<00:01:26.009> what<00:01:26.220> the

lights are for and you see if that

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.399 
lights are for and you see if that
system<00:01:29.670> probably<00:01:30.180> doesn't<00:01:30.689> apply<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:31.020> you<00:01:31.290> if

of work by low quality not saying bad

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.170 
of work by low quality not saying bad
work<00:01:42.930> just<00:01:43.259> lots<00:01:43.950> of<00:01:44.070> low<00:01:44.280> cases<00:01:44.790> and<00:01:45.000> and

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
work just lots of low cases and and

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.149 
work just lots of low cases and and
where<00:01:45.840> things<00:01:46.079> are<00:01:46.200> not<00:01:46.259> all<00:01:46.439> that<00:01:46.590> important

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
where things are not all that important

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.620 
where things are not all that important
like<00:01:47.369> let's<00:01:47.610> say<00:01:47.670> have<00:01:47.790> a<00:01:47.820> medical<00:01:48.240> bracket

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
like let's say have a medical bracket

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:49.999 
like let's say have a medical bracket
Medicare<00:01:49.049> practice<00:01:49.439> or<00:01:49.560> something<00:01:49.590> like<00:01:49.950> that

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
Medicare practice or something like that

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.130 
Medicare practice or something like that
and<00:01:50.610> then<00:01:51.149> probably<00:01:51.479> what<00:01:51.720> I'm<00:01:51.810> talking<00:01:52.079> about

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
and then probably what I'm talking about

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.620 
and then probably what I'm talking about
he<00:01:52.380> is<00:01:52.470> just<00:01:52.770> really<00:01:53.579> not<00:01:53.700> so<00:01:53.909> needed<00:01:54.210> but<00:01:54.509> if

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
he is just really not so needed but if

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.050 
he is just really not so needed but if
you<00:01:54.750> run<00:01:54.960> a<00:01:54.990> practice<00:01:55.729> when<00:01:56.729> people<00:01:56.939> actually

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
you run a practice when people actually

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.999 
you run a practice when people actually
based<00:01:57.420> on<00:01:57.570> money<00:01:57.780> and<00:01:57.869> more<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:58.350> more<00:01:58.409> in<00:01:58.860> the

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
based on money and more and more in the

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.590 
based on money and more and more in the
