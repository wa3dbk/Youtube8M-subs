00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
going to be d materialised I find this

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.999 
going to be d materialised I find this
way<00:01:32.869> is<00:01:33.140> the<00:01:33.860> most<00:01:34.100> effective<00:01:34.640> for<00:01:34.789> me<00:01:34.909> I<00:01:35.090> go<00:01:35.390> to

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:36.009 
way is the most effective for me I go to

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:40.120 
way is the most effective for me I go to

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
blur drop that out and the fast blur

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.020 
blur drop that out and the fast blur
will<00:03:55.830> scoot<00:03:56.070> this<00:03:56.220> down<00:03:56.280> so<00:03:56.580> see<00:03:56.880> if<00:03:56.940> we're

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
will scoot this down so see if we're

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:58.850 
will scoot this down so see if we're
doing<00:03:57.120> here<00:03:57.330> just<00:03:57.810> very<00:03:58.140> small<00:03:58.380> value<00:03:58.680> just<00:03:58.800> a

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
doing here just very small value just a

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800 
value of one very little blur but it

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.760 
value of one very little blur but it
gets<00:04:01.980> it<00:04:02.130> going<00:04:02.460> there<00:04:02.840> okay<00:04:03.840> and<00:04:04.200> next<00:04:04.500> thing

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
saturation effect to it and we're going

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:28.120 
saturation effect to it and we're going
to<00:04:24.440> click<00:04:24.680> on<00:04:24.860> the<00:04:25.040> colorize<00:04:25.640> and<00:04:26.890> switch<00:04:27.890> this

up to 100 okay that's our D materializer

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.620 
up to 100 okay that's our D materializer
now<00:04:40.430> we're<00:04:40.670> going<00:04:40.760> to<00:04:40.850> make<00:04:41.030> another<00:04:41.360> new

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:41.630 
now we're going to make another new

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.380 
now we're going to make another new
composition<00:04:42.320> and<00:04:42.700> we're<00:04:43.700> gonna<00:04:43.820> call<00:04:44.180> this

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:44.390 
composition and we're gonna call this

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:49.780 
composition and we're gonna call this
one<00:04:44.450> the<00:04:44.750> overlay<00:04:45.590> and<00:04:47.110> MPC<00:04:48.110> DV<00:04:48.710> widescreen<00:04:49.160> 10

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:49.790 
one the overlay and MPC DV widescreen 10

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:52.750 
one the overlay and MPC DV widescreen 10
seconds<00:04:50.300> full<00:04:50.890> okay<00:04:51.890> we're<00:04:52.310> gonna<00:04:52.400> make<00:04:52.580> a<00:04:52.610> new

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:52.760 
seconds full okay we're gonna make a new

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.570 
seconds full okay we're gonna make a new
solid<00:04:53.000> I'm<00:04:53.300> hitting<00:04:53.570> ctrl<00:04:53.870> Y<00:04:54.050> to<00:04:54.110> do<00:04:54.410> that<00:04:54.620> and

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
solid I'm hitting ctrl Y to do that and

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:57.850 
solid I'm hitting ctrl Y to do that and
we're<00:04:55.700> gonna<00:04:55.790> call<00:04:56.090> this<00:04:56.120> one<00:04:56.480> the<00:04:57.170> streaks

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:57.860 
we're gonna call this one the streaks

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.600 
we're gonna call this one the streaks
and<00:04:58.780> we<00:04:59.780> want<00:04:59.990> to<00:05:00.110> be<00:05:00.200> comp<00:05:00.440> size<00:05:00.710> and<00:05:01.070> black

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610 
and we want to be comp size and black

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:05.260 
and we want to be comp size and black
and<00:05:01.940> say<00:05:02.750> okay<00:05:03.200> the<00:05:03.860> first<00:05:04.070> effect<00:05:04.520> we're

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 
and say okay the first effect we're

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.650 
and say okay the first effect we're
gonna<00:05:05.390> add<00:05:05.630> fractal<00:05:06.620> noise<00:05:06.800> and<00:05:07.510> I'm<00:05:08.510> gonna

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:08.660 
gonna add fractal noise and I'm gonna

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:09.610 
gonna add fractal noise and I'm gonna
dump<00:05:08.870> that<00:05:08.960> out<00:05:09.230> there

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:09.620 
dump that out there

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:12.010 
dump that out there
okay<00:05:09.980> so<00:05:10.040> want<00:05:10.760> to<00:05:10.850> bring<00:05:11.030> the<00:05:11.150> contrast<00:05:11.630> up<00:05:11.810> to

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:12.020 
okay so want to bring the contrast up to

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.530 
okay so want to bring the contrast up to
200

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:14.540 
200

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:17.010 
200
and<00:05:14.630> the<00:05:14.960> brightness<00:05:15.380> down<00:05:15.410> to<00:05:15.830> negative<00:05:16.130> 80

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020 
and the brightness down to negative 80

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.510 
and the brightness down to negative 80
and<00:05:18.020> that<00:05:18.620> doesn't<00:05:18.950> look<00:05:19.040> all<00:05:19.160> that<00:05:19.190> great

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
and that doesn't look all that great

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.220 
and that doesn't look all that great
right<00:05:19.730> now<00:05:19.760> but<00:05:20.420> we're<00:05:20.540> going<00:05:20.660> to<00:05:20.780> open<00:05:20.930> the

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:21.230 
right now but we're going to open the

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:25.530 
right now but we're going to open the
transform<00:05:21.740> box<00:05:23.080> uncheck<00:05:24.080> uniform<00:05:24.560> scaling

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:25.540 
transform box uncheck uniform scaling

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:29.860 
transform box uncheck uniform scaling
take<00:05:26.540> the<00:05:26.690> scale<00:05:26.960> width<00:05:27.260> to<00:05:27.800> 5<00:05:28.160> and<00:05:28.600> the<00:05:29.600> scale

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:29.870 
take the scale width to 5 and the scale

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:33.160 
take the scale width to 5 and the scale
height<00:05:30.170> to<00:05:30.850> 2400<00:05:31.850> to<00:05:32.660> make<00:05:32.780> an<00:05:32.900> expression

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:33.170 
height to 2400 to make an expression

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:34.780 
height to 2400 to make an expression
we're<00:05:33.560> going<00:05:33.680> to<00:05:33.740> hold<00:05:33.860> down<00:05:33.920> alt<00:05:34.220> and<00:05:34.430> click

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:34.790 
we're going to hold down alt and click

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:36.490 
we're going to hold down alt and click
on<00:05:34.940> the<00:05:35.030> stopwatch<00:05:35.270> here<00:05:35.720> on<00:05:35.870> the<00:05:35.990> evolution

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:36.500 
on the stopwatch here on the evolution

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:39.240 
on the stopwatch here on the evolution
and<00:05:36.640> in<00:05:37.640> there<00:05:37.850> we're<00:05:38.030> just<00:05:38.180> going<00:05:38.330> to<00:05:38.390> type

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:39.250 
and in there we're just going to type

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:45.910 
and in there we're just going to type
time<00:05:41.140> times<00:05:42.280> 200<00:05:43.280> and<00:05:43.430> you<00:05:44.200> can<00:05:45.200> enter<00:05:45.380> on<00:05:45.680> the

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:45.920 
time times 200 and you can enter on the

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:47.440 
time times 200 and you can enter on the
number<00:05:46.250> pad<00:05:46.400> or<00:05:46.610> just<00:05:46.790> click<00:05:46.970> away<00:05:47.090> from<00:05:47.210> it

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:47.450 
number pad or just click away from it

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:49.360 
number pad or just click away from it
and<00:05:47.630> that<00:05:47.840> goes<00:05:48.110> now<00:05:48.890> if<00:05:48.980> we<00:05:49.070> scroll<00:05:49.310> through

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:49.370 
and that goes now if we scroll through

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:52.030 
and that goes now if we scroll through
we<00:05:49.760> see<00:05:49.970> we<00:05:50.210> have<00:05:50.240> a<00:05:50.720> bunch<00:05:50.900> of<00:05:51.080> streaks<00:05:51.530> on<00:05:51.770> the

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:52.040 
we see we have a bunch of streaks on the

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:53.350 
we see we have a bunch of streaks on the
screen<00:05:52.310> we're<00:05:52.640> going<00:05:52.760> to<00:05:52.820> make<00:05:52.910> another<00:05:53.030> new

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:53.360 
screen we're going to make another new

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:57.190 
screen we're going to make another new
solid<00:05:53.840> which<00:05:54.620> is<00:05:54.650> hit<00:05:55.190> ctrl<00:05:55.640> Y<00:05:55.790> and<00:05:56.200> we're

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:57.200 
solid which is hit ctrl Y and we're

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:01.090
