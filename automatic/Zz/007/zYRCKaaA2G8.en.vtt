00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.940
 In the middle of the night 

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:09.070
 Crazy love money 49 back row course companion 

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:10.670
 It has started to capture lectures for the second Buhigashidai 3 part-mer 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:16.520
 Branch incense 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:18.200
 Part 2 I diving is a problem with the conversation represented the fifth floor 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:22.370
 I will love you 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:26.600
 Someone or would have been a conversation I boys guard of someone 

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:30.980
 Mercer, you 're mum and mummy 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:35.150
 There is a problem with the ocean like that 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:41.660
 So there is n't any way to go around grammar expressions like that 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:47.250
 Rather, I understand that I can understand the meaning of each word and if I have a leg, for example 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:50.910
 I If you know that a rough kind of, huh minute that Te' 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:56.460
 With notes and opinions for example at home 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:01:01.829
 Ne This love'm good if, for example, main course seed Uh light Hyoge say 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:04.409
 That way, such Hyoge or I fit the or bad likely YYY 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:08.069
 Sorry I'm sorry 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:10.770
 Also because there is a place you are or word is bought, such as say 

00:01:08.069 --> 00:01:14.580
 Please divide and 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:20.100
 Well there is a problem with Onimon 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:24.420
 For example, 5 yen hardware Toka two or ne Yeah Kore 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:28.440
 Because the problem that is scattered among the choices is Nokgel 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:32.710
 Please understand 100% 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:36.369
 Then the next amp day 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:38.590
 The second pump is a word sorting problem 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:45.820
 There are also 5 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:47.720
 The game here is whether it is a idiom or whether you know grammatical matters 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:52.350
 I will 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:53.330
 For example, intimidation as a grammatical item that often appears 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.960
 Ah 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:02:00.390
 It is a child of a timeless automatic eye 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.900
 After that is a simple processing system 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:06.330
 After words that can be combined with the future type 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:11.120
 Indecent practice 2 and money 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:15.980
 It is a Buddhist law accident like words like now 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:23.930
 If blow-you can north if you notice knew pond at the top 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:28.560
 It's not too much time to think too much to say that it was just taken this time 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:34.930
 Please note that it takes a great deal of time if you are over top 5 like this 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:38.650
 It seems that about 1 minute is a standard for every question. 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:43.120
 I often do not learn in particular 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:48.880
 For example, the middle school first grade junior high school one year 49 Febu 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:50.069
 Or pretty but it is still not for the people who are trying at the root was than that 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:56.280
 I think there is 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:03:01.319
 For such people , this unit is an extreme disapproval, but where it is acceptable to give up scores and cooking in the country 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:02.639
 Is actually the fourth part of the fourth play or the first part of the first part of the word 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:08.440
 By becoming part 

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:11.910
 2 songs to make a song that does not take time yet 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.910
 Why still good place 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:20.860
 The effects of today's videos are up to here 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:23.400
 The Well Part 4 or the 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.400
 line
