00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 yo guys all hello today we are 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.759
 read funny comments from social 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:09.120
 networks like you know people endlessly 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.519
 argue what to learn bye or console and on 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.679
 This topic I found a bunch of very funny 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.870
 comments so we will read them and 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.550
 marvel at the stupidity of people want you 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.670
 Warn in this video will be many 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.680
 jokes fps about pixels about consoles 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.900
 so don't take everything seriously 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.800
 so our first comment left a couple 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:31.710
 FPS does not depend on the power of ps4 or pc on 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:35.610
 the quality of your vision if you looked 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.980
 telly up to 10 years then above 24 fps you do not 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.410
 will rise and go I decided to google on 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.930
 this topic and unfortunately no one heard of 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.950
 this disease apparently such trouble happened 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.469
 only with pasha 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.079
 but also assume that the FPS depends on 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.510
 your view is idiocy that is 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.809
 his loki if you have perfect vision then 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.190
 in any game there will be one hundred two hundred fps but that 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.770
 I think bullshit 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.390
 so let's move on 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.850
 the next stupidity we have is sleigh 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.890
 our buddy states on consoles everything 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.439
 runs at maximum speed in any game 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.720
 you don't know what's on the console to only on 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.760
 I will not argue on TV but I still 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.010
 connect nakama niku consoles and 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.979
 couch that 720p 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.750
 at least 4k there is no difference I wonder what it is 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.320
 the magic sofa stands by our patient 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.850
 at home for between 4k and 720 and yet 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.100
 too many differences 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.150
 at least 4k pixel density in 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.610
 four times more 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.829
 and it's sad that Sasha does not notice 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.549
 This but then comes the most interesting 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:39.450
 fps on consoles is always above 30 but if 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:41.430
 it will even be 15 then this is as much as 60 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.979
 This is fucking understand that is, on the console 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.860
 fps is considered different if something is one 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:49.590
 fps on the console is 3 fps . 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.750
 what kind of nonsense fps is the refresh rate 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.090
 the higher the fps the smoother the picture 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.090
 on your monitor flew ki and fuck that 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.490
 but for now on the 30 fps console this one and 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.799
 the same thing is for them to be stable and 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.820
 then everything will be fine but probably not yet 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.530
 all patients understand this 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.659
 it's pretty sad so now 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.479
 move to more serious comments 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:13.600
 our next patient Vasily Vasya writes 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:15.640
 telly increases fps as in the movie and on 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.800
 console well, then you have a little bit 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.140
 pukan burns so here about the fact that 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.180
 tv boosts fps honestly say i 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.280
 I have not heard this but that you are not 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.110
 cheat yet see google and what 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.600
 The most interesting about this no one heard 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.310
 Well, not counting in the axis he can see some 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.320
 special telly for from these 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.300
 technologies even google doesn't know but 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:37.480
 again, there are all sorts of people for some 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:40.510
 20 fps in the game is not enough and for someone 60 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.430
 fps is already too much and already cradling 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.739
 as let's say Kiryusha from our next 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.720
 comments but we will not offend Kirill 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:49.810
 better go to our next dime 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.520
 the patient boldly states that on his ps4 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.560
 everything starts in 4k 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:56.080
 Apparently, Dmitry has a special console 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.120
 exclusive so to speak for ordinary 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.410
 people are not able to run the same 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.200
 tea zones in 4k 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:04.330
 but Dima has such an opportunity and go 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.180
 I just want to be glad for a man 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:09.700
 he has all the class in life instead of 900 beer 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.920
 sin he sees 4k and as stated himself 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.500
 Dmitry his latest comments he 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.840
 squeezes the maximum out of ps4 well and visibility 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.459
 his life is also driven by the same people and of 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.730
 our last comment is 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:23.500
 plasma work at 100 fps and then ps4 and 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.870
 Xboxbox do most bakers 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.489
 Again, even Google does not know about such 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.130
 technology at 100 fps 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:33.190
 finally want people to understand you 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:36.610
 You can connect your ps4 4k telly for 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:39.760
 two hundred three hundred at least 500,000 but if on ps4 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:41.350
 gta 5 runs at 30 fps plus 1080p 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.049
 you will not have more 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:47.620
 and 4k you also will not appear maximum 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:50.290
 now for ps4 it is 1080i + 60 fps 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:53.230
 but no more sound maidens 100 fps say 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:55.150
 people which 4k are really so stupid 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.070
 to write such nonsense in the comments 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:59.440
 summarizing before writing 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.860
 comments please think twice 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.900
 him 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:04.630
 for now too many people are writing 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.950
 bearing nonsense and it's sad if you 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.750
 it was interesting to listen to me 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:09.700
 like this video and
