00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:08.189 
what we want to avoid here is
backpedaling<00:05:05.409> and<00:05:06.159> making<00:05:06.909> a<00:05:06.969> stretch<00:05:07.299> into

00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:08.199 
backpedaling and making a stretch into

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:11.249 
backpedaling and making a stretch into
the<00:05:08.319> goal<00:05:08.579> so<00:05:09.579> as<00:05:09.729> we<00:05:09.909> can<00:05:10.119> we'd<00:05:10.719> like<00:05:10.869> to<00:05:10.929> jump

00:05:11.249 --> 00:05:11.259 
the goal so as we can we'd like to jump

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:13.829 
the goal so as we can we'd like to jump
slightly<00:05:11.739> forward<00:05:12.159> catching<00:05:13.029> the<00:05:13.119> ball<00:05:13.299> above

00:05:13.829 --> 00:05:13.839 
slightly forward catching the ball above

00:05:13.839 --> 00:05:16.319 
slightly forward catching the ball above
the<00:05:14.049> head<00:05:14.289> at<00:05:14.529> its<00:05:14.889> highest<00:05:15.129> and<00:05:15.429> safest<00:05:15.999> point

00:05:16.319 --> 00:05:16.329 
the head at its highest and safest point

00:05:16.329 --> 00:05:18.209 
the head at its highest and safest point
let's<00:05:17.139> take<00:05:17.289> a<00:05:17.349> look<00:05:17.619> at<00:05:17.739> what<00:05:17.889> this<00:05:18.069> would

00:05:18.209 --> 00:05:18.219 
let's take a look at what this would

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:34.200 
let's take a look at what this would
look<00:05:18.249> like

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.210 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.270
