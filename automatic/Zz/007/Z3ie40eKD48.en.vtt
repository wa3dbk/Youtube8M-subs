00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:05.720
 hello friends how are you here 

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:08.540
 we are back with a video that I 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:11.420
 they were requesting that it's techniques 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.970
 to use the double blow on the bass drum 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.220
 we start 

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:18.920
 there are several ways to give double 

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:21.560
 hit on the bass drum I've seen several 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.289
 some that are for example if a hit 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.150
 here 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:28.190
 and the other blow here 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.280
 one here 

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:34.050
 and one here 

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:39.190
 but this technique is quite complicated 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:41.360
 especially when we bring tennis because 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:44.360
 does not bounce well 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.600
 you battle a lot another technique that 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.670
 they use is to strike first with the 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:54.179
 heel 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:54.179
 and the other with the tip of the foot like that 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.170
 It is also quite complicated because 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.350
 we have to do a double movement 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.350
 of the foot 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:06.600
 then the techniques that I recommend 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:10.160
 are the following 1 normally at 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.160
 hype we hit in this way 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.520
 is the most appropriate to give the blow with the 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.439
 puntita and drop very well 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.490
 that prevents us from getting tired so much 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:26.250
 leg to give the double hype 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:29.990
 he only left the whole foot in what 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:32.990
 what is the pedal and then 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:36.880
 the same rebound of the pedal spring 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.880
 it gives us the impulse observing 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.560
 in a solar rhythm and something like that 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:59.190
 it can also be a rhythm a little bit 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.190
 faster 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:15.030
 if we observe it clearly is quite 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.610
 complicated to start making rhythms very 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:21.510
 difficult what can be done is a 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:24.980
 simple simple rhythm and poke 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:27.489
 occasionally the double hype something like that 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.489
 Y 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.239
 ah 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.530
 when we have it dominated to that 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.530
 speed a little faster 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.750
 another technique that sometimes I used is 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:58.420
 give two strokes with toe 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:00.570
 taking advantage of the bounce of the pedal something 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.570
 A) Yes 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:11.260
 ways in which the fastest blow 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.260
 let's observe the rhythm 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:25.630
 and immediately 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:34.710
 with the impulse that brings back the 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.810
 pedal we put the second blow then for 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:39.180
 there are two of the most important techniques 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.280
 simple to use the double hit 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.380
 however if we can not with 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:47.270
 You can practice what is 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:47.270
 one blow down here and the other up 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.790
 or the hit with the heel 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:01.540
 very good friends we are seeing myself 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:05.670
 I am vih sand see you soon in a 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.670
 more video with more battery tutorials
