00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.840 
from my perspective personally feel
that's<00:01:25.110> why<00:01:25.290> it's<00:01:25.470> important<00:01:25.979> but<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.640> bigger

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
that's why it's important but the bigger

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.050 
that's why it's important but the bigger
