00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
I think they would say that I was funny

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.070 
I think they would say that I was funny
at<00:00:17.190> least<00:00:17.369> I<00:00:17.460> would<00:00:17.580> hope<00:00:17.730> so

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
at least I would hope so

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.590 
at least I would hope so
I<00:00:19.109> you<00:00:19.949> know<00:00:20.040> I<00:00:20.070> generally<00:00:20.280> tried<00:00:20.760> to<00:00:21.090> instill

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
I you know I generally tried to instill

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.680 
I you know I generally tried to instill
a<00:00:21.630> lot<00:00:21.780> of<00:00:21.870> humor<00:00:22.110> in<00:00:22.140> my<00:00:22.410> patient<00:00:23.280> education

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:23.690 
a lot of humor in my patient education

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:28.010 
a lot of humor in my patient education
and<00:00:24.980> I<00:00:25.980> think<00:00:26.430> that<00:00:26.550> comes<00:00:26.760> across<00:00:26.850> well<00:00:27.240> both

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:28.020 
and I think that comes across well both

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.730 
and I think that comes across well both
with<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.500> kids<00:00:28.740> and<00:00:29.070> with<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.340> adults<00:00:30.710> but<00:00:31.710> I

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
with the kids and with the adults but I

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.260 
with the kids and with the adults but I
think<00:00:32.009> they'd<00:00:32.160> also<00:00:32.309> say<00:00:32.610> that<00:00:32.820> you<00:00:33.149> know<00:00:33.239> I

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
think they'd also say that you know I

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.290 
think they'd also say that you know I
spend<00:00:33.539> a<00:00:33.570> lot<00:00:33.600> of<00:00:33.750> time<00:00:33.960> doing<00:00:34.710> education<00:00:35.610> so

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
spend a lot of time doing education so

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.060 
spend a lot of time doing education so
that<00:00:36.329> you<00:00:37.020> know<00:00:37.110> next<00:00:37.440> time<00:00:37.560> stuff<00:00:37.800> like<00:00:37.950> this

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
that you know next time stuff like this

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.979 
that you know next time stuff like this
happens<00:00:38.370> they<00:00:38.460> know<00:00:38.970> the<00:00:39.300> mechanisms<00:00:39.810> behind

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
happens they know the mechanisms behind

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.500 
happens they know the mechanisms behind
it<00:00:40.340> and<00:00:41.340> they<00:00:41.460> can<00:00:41.610> understand<00:00:41.970> the<00:00:42.030> concepts
