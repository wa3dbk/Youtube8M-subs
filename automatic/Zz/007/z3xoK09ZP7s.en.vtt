that point in time the company started
off<00:00:15.690> in<00:00:15.809> Hong<00:00:15.990> Kong<00:00:16.170> and<00:00:16.350> then<00:00:16.590> we<00:00:16.650> moved<00:00:16.859> to

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
off in Hong Kong and then we moved to

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.670 
off in Hong Kong and then we moved to
Montreal<00:00:17.400> we<00:00:18.210> originally<00:00:19.140> hired<00:00:19.320> on<00:00:19.590> an

Montreal we originally hired on an
as-needed<00:00:19.890> basis<00:00:20.580> but<00:00:21.000> we<00:00:21.150> very<00:00:21.330> quickly

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
as-needed basis but we very quickly

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.080 
as-needed basis but we very quickly
found<00:00:21.869> we<00:00:22.080> needed<00:00:22.320> more<00:00:22.439> flexibility<00:00:23.090> hiring

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
found we needed more flexibility hiring

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.029 
found we needed more flexibility hiring
it<00:00:24.210> can<00:00:24.480> be<00:00:24.750> very<00:00:24.779> time<00:00:25.170> consuming<00:00:25.199> to<00:00:25.859> find

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
it can be very time consuming to find

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.050 
it can be very time consuming to find
the<00:00:26.099> right<00:00:26.189> candidate<00:00:26.640> it<00:00:26.820> can<00:00:26.939> be<00:00:27.029> very

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
the right candidate it can be very

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.880 
the right candidate it can be very
expensive<00:00:27.380> one<00:00:28.380> of<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.500> other<00:00:28.619> things<00:00:28.800> we

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
expensive one of the other things we

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.830 
expensive one of the other things we
found<00:00:29.070> was<00:00:29.340> that<00:00:29.369> we<00:00:30.060> have<00:00:30.210> a<00:00:30.240> lot<00:00:30.390> of<00:00:30.420> ideas<00:00:30.570> we

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
found was that we have a lot of ideas we

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.930 
found was that we have a lot of ideas we
want<00:00:30.990> to<00:00:31.050> test<00:00:31.260> so<00:00:31.980> you<00:00:32.369> want<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:32.610> test<00:00:32.759> those

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
want to test so you want to test those

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.910 
want to test so you want to test those
ideas<00:00:33.300> out<00:00:33.540> first<00:00:33.899> and<00:00:34.170> then<00:00:34.469> decide<00:00:34.590> if

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
ideas out first and then decide if

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:35.990 
ideas out first and then decide if
you're<00:00:35.070> going<00:00:35.160> to<00:00:35.250> build<00:00:35.370> a<00:00:35.489> strategy<00:00:35.820> around

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
you're going to build a strategy around

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.030 
you're going to build a strategy around
that<00:00:36.329> so<00:00:37.170> we<00:00:37.290> need<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:37.440> lot<00:00:37.620> of<00:00:37.649> different

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
that so we need a lot of different

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.470 
that so we need a lot of different
resources<00:00:38.160> in<00:00:38.579> different<00:00:38.820> countries<00:00:38.969> because

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
resources in different countries because

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.420 
resources in different countries because
we<00:00:39.600> have<00:00:39.750> users<00:00:40.050> all<00:00:40.170> over<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.469> place<00:00:40.649> I<00:00:40.920> first

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
we have users all over the place I first
