you on our normal or normal route and we
have<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.030> test<00:00:39.360> track<00:00:39.480> and<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.739> first<00:00:41.010> thing<00:00:41.340> to

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:42.079 
have a test track and the first thing to

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:45.440 
have a test track and the first thing to
highlight<00:00:43.079> is<00:00:43.590> when<00:00:44.250> Honda<00:00:45.000> came<00:00:45.120> out<00:00:45.300> with

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
highlight is when Honda came out with

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.860 
highlight is when Honda came out with
this<00:00:45.660> they<00:00:46.020> increase<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.850> price<00:00:47.850> of<00:00:47.879> it<00:00:48.239> about

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
200 bucks basically whistles yeah which

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.299 
200 bucks basically whistles yeah which
is<00:00:58.949> incredible<00:00:59.750> the<00:01:00.750> engine<00:01:01.140> they<00:01:01.859> upped<00:01:02.070> it<00:01:02.280> a

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
is incredible the engine they upped it a

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.009 
is incredible the engine they upped it a
little<00:01:02.730> bit<00:01:02.910> in<00:01:03.000> terms<00:01:03.180> of<00:01:03.329> horsepower<00:01:03.750> so

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
little bit in terms of horsepower so

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.039 
little bit in terms of horsepower so
it's<00:01:04.170> 180<00:01:04.580> 184<00:01:06.590> which<00:01:07.590> is<00:01:07.740> up<00:01:07.920> around<00:01:08.369> seven

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:09.049 
it's 180 184 which is up around seven

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:13.580 
it's 180 184 which is up around seven
from<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.170> previous<00:01:10.500> generation<00:01:12.590> probably

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
from the previous generation probably

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.359 
from the previous generation probably
the<00:01:14.000> number<00:01:15.000> one<00:01:15.390> thing<00:01:15.840> that<00:01:16.369> everyone's

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
the number one thing that everyone's

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.670 
the number one thing that everyone's
going<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.670> notice<00:01:18.030> on<00:01:18.180> this<00:01:18.360> car<00:01:18.630> even<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.259> LX

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
going to notice on this car even the LX

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.490 
going to notice on this car even the LX
you<00:01:20.400> get<00:01:20.580> alloy<00:01:20.939> wheels<00:01:21.299> so<00:01:21.840> that's<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.080> huge

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
you get alloy wheels so that's a huge

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.539 
you get alloy wheels so that's a huge
thing<00:01:23.270> something<00:01:24.270> that<00:01:24.299> I<00:01:24.390> think<00:01:24.509> is<00:01:25.290> a<00:01:26.159> very

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
thing something that I think is a very

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.140 
thing something that I think is a very
smart<00:01:27.150> move<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:28.400> then<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.820> CVT

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
smart move and then the the CVT

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.160 
smart move and then the the CVT
transmission<00:01:30.960> first<00:01:31.290> year<00:01:31.470> for<00:01:31.650> those<00:01:31.770> so

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
transmission first year for those so

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.460 
transmission first year for those so
just<00:01:34.170> those<00:01:34.470> alone<00:01:34.740> are<00:01:34.799> worth<00:01:35.490> way<00:01:35.820> more<00:01:35.850> than

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
just those alone are worth way more than

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:43.010 
just those alone are worth way more than
$200<00:01:37.470> yeah<00:01:38.600> they<00:01:39.600> did<00:01:41.329> were<00:01:42.329> able<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:42.630> shorten

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
$200 yeah they did were able to shorten

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.830 
$200 yeah they did were able to shorten
it<00:01:43.259> a<00:01:43.439> little<00:01:43.470> bit<00:01:43.979> around<00:01:44.490> 3<00:01:44.939> inches<00:01:45.060> due<00:01:45.540> to

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
it a little bit around 3 inches due to

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.380 
it a little bit around 3 inches due to
they're<00:01:46.799> now<00:01:46.950> using<00:01:46.979> a<00:01:47.280> McPherson<00:01:47.790> strut<00:01:48.180> in

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
they're now using a McPherson strut in

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.350 
they're now using a McPherson strut in
the<00:01:48.540> front<00:01:48.869> and<00:01:49.759> since<00:01:50.759> they're<00:01:50.939> a<00:01:50.970> little<00:01:51.180> bit

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
the front and since they're a little bit

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.740 
the front and since they're a little bit
more<00:01:51.540> compact<00:01:52.490> there<00:01:53.490> was<00:01:53.670> you<00:01:54.360> know<00:01:54.479> a<00:01:54.509> little

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
more compact there was you know a little

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.560 
more compact there was you know a little
bit<00:01:54.899> more<00:01:54.990> engine<00:01:55.950> space<00:01:56.460> room<00:01:56.850> so<00:01:57.180> they<00:01:57.299> were

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
bit more engine space room so they were

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.389 
bit more engine space room so they were
able<00:01:57.719> to<00:01:57.899> shorten<00:01:58.350> it<00:01:58.409> which<00:01:58.920> saves<00:01:59.250> a<00:01:59.340> little

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
able to shorten it which saves a little

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.270 
able to shorten it which saves a little
bit<00:01:59.549> of<00:01:59.670> weight<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.090> in<00:02:00.990> turn<00:02:01.200> you<00:02:01.950> know<00:02:02.040> help

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
bit of weight and in turn you know help

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.620 
bit of weight and in turn you know help
help<00:02:02.579> get<00:02:02.700> better<00:02:02.909> fuel<00:02:03.420> economy<00:02:03.600> so<00:02:05.630> can't

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
help get better fuel economy so can't

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.880 
help get better fuel economy so can't
really<00:02:06.689> go<00:02:06.960> wrong<00:02:06.990> there<00:02:07.380> and<00:02:09.200> as<00:02:10.200> terms<00:02:10.590> in

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
really go wrong there and as terms in

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.500 
really go wrong there and as terms in
terms<00:02:11.039> of<00:02:11.250> fuel<00:02:11.400> economy<00:02:11.610> it<00:02:12.000> actually

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
terms of fuel economy it actually

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.210 
terms of fuel economy it actually
increased<00:02:13.459> about<00:02:14.459> a<00:02:14.489> mile<00:02:14.790> per<00:02:15.030> gallon<00:02:15.060> so<00:02:15.840> on

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
increased about a mile per gallon so on

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.259 
increased about a mile per gallon so on
the<00:02:17.220> LX<00:02:17.640> model

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:20.269 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:23.890
