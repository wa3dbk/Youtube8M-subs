some<00:01:00.989> of<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.140> trailers<00:01:01.469> that<00:01:01.500> I'm<00:01:01.920> a<00:01:01.949> little

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
some of the trailers that I'm a little

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.380 
some of the trailers that I'm a little
disappointed<00:01:02.699> how<00:01:03.149> much<00:01:03.329> they<00:01:03.539> changed<00:01:03.960> Cole

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
unfortunately so we'll see I think they

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.120 
unfortunately so we'll see I think they
they<00:01:09.570> sort<00:01:09.840> of<00:01:09.930> reverted<00:01:10.350> back<00:01:10.380> after<00:01:10.979> there

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
they sort of reverted back after there

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.399 
they sort of reverted back after there
was<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.280> bit<00:01:11.520> of<00:01:11.549> a<00:01:11.670> backlash<00:01:12.260> when<00:01:13.260> they

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
was a bit of a backlash when they

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.170

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
interacting right so that's cool uh what

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:57.630

else<00:02:54.640> what<00:02:54.910> else<00:02:54.940> I<00:02:55.450> don't<00:02:55.720> know<00:02:55.810> I<00:02:56.549> don't<00:02:57.549> know

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
else what else I don't know I don't know

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.240 
else what else I don't know I don't know
if<00:02:57.760> i'll<00:02:57.849> do<00:02:58.030> a<00:02:58.420> live<00:02:58.870> commentary<00:02:59.470> probably

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
if i'll do a live commentary probably

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.440 
if i'll do a live commentary probably
just<00:03:00.519> for<00:03:01.140> the<00:03:02.140> initial<00:03:02.560> playthrough<00:03:03.190> i<00:03:04.120> think

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
just for the initial playthrough i think

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.930 
just for the initial playthrough i think
there<00:03:04.540> was<00:03:04.629> a<00:03:05.040> harder<00:03:06.040> difficulty<00:03:06.400> settings

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
there was a harder difficulty settings

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.750 
there was a harder difficulty settings
on<00:03:07.269> the<00:03:07.390> original<00:03:07.720> infamous<00:03:08.110> so<00:03:08.799> you<00:03:09.430> know<00:03:09.519> if

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
on the original infamous so you know if

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.650 
on the original infamous so you know if
that's<00:03:10.180> a<00:03:10.480> is<00:03:10.959> the<00:03:11.799> same<00:03:12.220> here<00:03:12.849> what<00:03:13.569> i'll

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
that's a is the same here what i'll

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.210 
that's a is the same here what i'll
probably<00:03:13.840> end<00:03:13.959> up<00:03:14.049> doing<00:03:14.379> is<00:03:14.530> going<00:03:14.920> through

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
probably end up doing is going through

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.400 
probably end up doing is going through
the<00:03:15.310> missions<00:03:15.610> on<00:03:16.090> the<00:03:16.629> hardest<00:03:17.049> difficulty

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
the missions on the hardest difficulty

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.080 
the missions on the hardest difficulty

if<00:03:20.650> not<00:03:20.829> that<00:03:21.010> i<00:03:21.040> probably<00:03:21.190> won't<00:03:21.430> do<00:03:21.519> it<00:03:21.670> but

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
if not that i probably won't do it but

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.559 
if not that i probably won't do it but
if<00:03:22.420> it's<00:03:22.690> required<00:03:22.840> for<00:03:23.230> a<00:03:23.260> trophy<00:03:23.650> then<00:03:24.569> i'm
