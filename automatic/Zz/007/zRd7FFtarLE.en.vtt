00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.480 
life learning online that's so much part

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:39.849 
life learning online that's so much part
of<00:00:38.569> their<00:00:38.659> everyday<00:00:38.839> life<00:00:39.140> they're<00:00:39.559> not<00:00:39.739> aware

of their everyday life they're not aware

00:00:39.859 --> 00:00:41.559 
of their everyday life they're not aware
that<00:00:40.339> they're<00:00:40.489> learning<00:00:40.640> in<00:00:40.909> a<00:00:40.999> way<00:00:41.120> different

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:41.569 
that they're learning in a way different

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:43.000 
that they're learning in a way different
than<00:00:41.600> their<00:00:41.870> parents<00:00:42.019> work<00:00:42.350> for<00:00:42.710> them<00:00:42.829> it's

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010 
than their parents work for them it's

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.860 
than their parents work for them it's
just<00:00:43.100> learning<00:00:43.699> so<00:00:44.120> how<00:00:44.269> does<00:00:44.329> the<00:00:44.539> faculty

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
just learning so how does the faculty

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.200 
just learning so how does the faculty
member<00:00:45.079> take<00:00:45.260> advantage<00:00:45.710> of<00:00:45.829> that<00:00:46.010> but<00:00:46.550> feed

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
member take advantage of that but feed

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.779 
member take advantage of that but feed
the<00:00:47.690> necessary<00:00:47.949> content<00:00:48.949> internet<00:00:49.460> so<00:00:49.640> that

00:00:49.779 --> 00:00:49.789 
the necessary content internet so that

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:51.969 
the necessary content internet so that
the<00:00:49.909> technology<00:00:50.239> again<00:00:50.719> does<00:00:51.109> not<00:00:51.319> take<00:00:51.559> over

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:51.979 
the technology again does not take over

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:55.809 
the technology again does not take over
but<00:00:52.579> becomes<00:00:52.969> an<00:00:53.179> enabler<00:00:54.489> increasingly<00:00:55.489> what

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:55.819 
but becomes an enabler increasingly what

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:58.360 
but becomes an enabler increasingly what
we're<00:00:55.969> finding<00:00:56.269> our<00:00:57.039> courses<00:00:58.039> that<00:00:58.339> are

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
we're finding our courses that are

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.520 
we're finding our courses that are
experimenting<00:00:59.120> in<00:00:59.239> the<00:00:59.269> way<00:00:59.600> the<00:00:59.870> information

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
experimenting in the way the information

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.069 
experimenting in the way the information
is<00:01:00.710> delivered<00:01:00.920> outside<00:01:01.789> of<00:01:01.819> class<00:01:02.210> and<00:01:02.569> then<00:01:03.049> a

00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:03.079 
is delivered outside of class and then a

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:05.260 
is delivered outside of class and then a
change<00:01:03.469> in<00:01:03.679> dynamic<00:01:04.280> of<00:01:04.430> what's<00:01:04.640> occurring<00:01:04.970> in

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:05.270 
change in dynamic of what's occurring in

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:07.930 
change in dynamic of what's occurring in
the<00:01:05.420> classroom<00:01:06.010> the<00:01:07.010> professor<00:01:07.460> would<00:01:07.640> pre

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:07.940 
the classroom the professor would pre

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:09.820 
the classroom the professor would pre
record<00:01:08.300> a<00:01:08.360> video<00:01:08.540> for<00:01:09.080> a<00:01:09.110> topic<00:01:09.620> that<00:01:09.740> we're

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
record a video for a topic that we're

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.010 
record a video for a topic that we're
going<00:01:09.950> to<00:01:10.010> discuss<00:01:10.400> and<00:01:10.730> either<00:01:11.450> ask<00:01:11.690> us<00:01:11.900> to

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
going to discuss and either ask us to

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.390 
going to discuss and either ask us to
watch<00:01:12.170> it<00:01:12.320> before<00:01:12.440> a<00:01:12.650> class<00:01:12.860> or<00:01:13.100> watch<00:01:13.250> it

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
watch it before a class or watch it

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.130 
watch it before a class or watch it
after<00:01:13.670> class<00:01:13.850> whereas<00:01:14.360> he<00:01:14.510> does<00:01:14.720> a<00:01:14.930> more

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
after class whereas he does a more

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.260 
after class whereas he does a more
interactive<00:01:15.380> approach<00:01:15.740> to<00:01:16.130> it<00:01:16.220> in<00:01:16.310> class<00:01:16.520> so

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
interactive approach to it in class so

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:18.850 
interactive approach to it in class so
you<00:01:17.300> make<00:01:17.600> the<00:01:17.630> classroom<00:01:18.350> the<00:01:18.470> place<00:01:18.680> where

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
you make the classroom the place where

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.220 
you make the classroom the place where
those<00:01:18.980> questions<00:01:19.820> get<00:01:20.030> really<00:01:20.390> engaged<00:01:20.810> and

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:21.230 
those questions get really engaged and

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.480 
those questions get really engaged and
you<00:01:21.710> get<00:01:21.860> the<00:01:21.980> fact-based<00:01:22.370> material<00:01:23.060> toenails

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
you get the fact-based material toenails

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.710 
you get the fact-based material toenails
four<00:01:25.490> or<00:01:25.580> five<00:01:25.610> years<00:01:26.030> ago<00:01:26.150> we<00:01:26.450> started

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
four or five years ago we started

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.020 
four or five years ago we started
recording<00:01:27.230> horse<00:01:27.830> lectures<00:01:28.370> so<00:01:28.700> we've<00:01:28.910> been

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
recording horse lectures so we've been

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.820 
recording horse lectures so we've been
working<00:01:29.240> with<00:01:29.510> Cisco<00:01:29.930> to<00:01:29.960> find<00:01:30.320> ways<00:01:30.560> to<00:01:30.800> make

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:30.830

semesters the context within which
younger<00:01:48.320> people<00:01:48.620> learn<00:01:48.920> is<00:01:49.220> being<00:01:49.430> very<00:01:49.640> much

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
younger people learn is being very much

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.430 
younger people learn is being very much
more<00:01:50.060> driven<00:01:50.570> by<00:01:50.810> access<00:01:51.170> to<00:01:51.260> information

more driven by access to information

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.320 
more driven by access to information
they<00:01:51.890> got<00:01:52.040> richer<00:01:52.520> source<00:01:52.760> of<00:01:52.880> excess<00:01:53.210> and

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
they got richer source of excess and

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:54.940 
they got richer source of excess and
secondly<00:01:54.320> is<00:01:54.500> how<00:01:54.650> they<00:01:54.800> actually

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
secondly is how they actually

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.340 
secondly is how they actually
collaborate<00:01:55.580> to<00:01:55.700> make<00:01:55.850> meaning<00:01:56.180> together<00:01:56.480> so

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
collaborate to make meaning together so

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:58.930 
collaborate to make meaning together so
they<00:01:57.500> actually<00:01:57.620> leverage<00:01:58.220> the<00:01:58.340> technology<00:01:58.460> in

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:58.940 
they actually leverage the technology in

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:00.340 
they actually leverage the technology in
much<00:01:59.060> more<00:01:59.210> collaborative<00:01:59.510> ways<00:01:59.930> through

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
much more collaborative ways through

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.580 
much more collaborative ways through
platforms<00:02:00.650> like<00:02:00.980> facebook<00:02:01.490> or<00:02:01.640> myspace<00:02:02.590> when

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
platforms like facebook or myspace when

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.650 
platforms like facebook or myspace when
i<00:02:03.620> start<00:02:04.010> cisco<00:02:04.430> wide<00:02:04.700> the<00:02:04.880> first<00:02:05.090> time<00:02:05.330> i<00:02:05.360> was

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:05.660 
i start cisco wide the first time i was

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.530 
i start cisco wide the first time i was
really<00:02:06.590> excited<00:02:06.830> because<00:02:07.370> it<00:02:07.940> addressed<00:02:08.360> the

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:08.540 
really excited because it addressed the

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:10.240 
really excited because it addressed the
issue<00:02:08.750> of<00:02:09.140> well<00:02:09.440> why<00:02:09.590> don't<00:02:09.770> you<00:02:09.830> just<00:02:09.979> put<00:02:10.220> a

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
issue of well why don't you just put a

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.010 
issue of well why don't you just put a
bunch<00:02:10.399> of<00:02:10.580> stuff<00:02:10.790> in<00:02:10.970> facebook<00:02:11.450> it<00:02:11.660> gave<00:02:11.870> us

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
bunch of stuff in facebook it gave us

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.990 
bunch of stuff in facebook it gave us
something<00:02:12.050> that<00:02:12.440> vaguely<00:02:12.800> like<00:02:13.070> facebook<00:02:13.790> but

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
something that vaguely like facebook but

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.480 
something that vaguely like facebook but
for<00:02:14.360> behind<00:02:14.780> the<00:02:14.870> firewall<00:02:15.170> so<00:02:15.950> we<00:02:16.130> started

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
for behind the firewall so we started

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.130

becomes a really powerful environment
for<00:02:51.920> us<00:02:52.040> that<00:02:52.550> these<00:02:52.760> technologies<00:02:53.450> can<00:02:53.660> help

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
for us that these technologies can help

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.680 
for us that these technologies can help
to<00:02:54.019> enable<00:02:54.350> what<00:02:54.800> we're<00:02:54.980> seeing<00:02:55.220> now<00:02:55.430> is<00:02:55.880> using

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
to enable what we're seeing now is using

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.020 
to enable what we're seeing now is using
technology<00:02:57.370> particularly<00:02:58.370> when<00:02:58.730> it's<00:02:58.880> in

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
technology particularly when it's in

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.509 
technology particularly when it's in
real<00:02:59.269> time<00:02:59.660> that<00:03:00.350> enables<00:03:00.860> faculty<00:03:01.370> and

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
real time that enables faculty and

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:03.550 
real time that enables faculty and
students<00:03:01.880> to<00:03:02.000> interact<00:03:02.180> in<00:03:02.600> much<00:03:02.900> richer<00:03:03.380> ways

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
students to interact in much richer ways

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.310 
students to interact in much richer ways
with<00:03:03.800> much<00:03:04.070> better<00:03:04.280> learning<00:03:04.700> outcomes<00:03:05.320> the

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.320 
with much better learning outcomes the

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.500 
with much better learning outcomes the
telepresence<00:03:06.860> classroom<00:03:07.580> as<00:03:07.730> we've<00:03:08.239> designed

telepresence classroom as we've designed

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.960 
telepresence classroom as we've designed
it<00:03:08.959> really<00:03:09.650> promotes<00:03:09.890> that<00:03:10.370> interactivity

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
it really promotes that interactivity

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.660 
it really promotes that interactivity
even<00:03:11.540> at<00:03:11.630> a<00:03:11.660> distance<00:03:12.160> telepresence<00:03:13.160> has<00:03:13.519> the

even at a distance telepresence has the

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.670 
even at a distance telepresence has the
ability<00:03:14.060> to<00:03:14.090> make<00:03:14.480> that<00:03:14.750> one-to-one

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
ability to make that one-to-one

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.680 
ability to make that one-to-one
connection<00:03:15.950> and<00:03:16.580> to<00:03:17.030> break<00:03:17.209> down<00:03:17.450> those

I<00:03:27.580> think<00:03:28.210> we've<00:03:28.360> really<00:03:28.690> worked<00:03:28.870> hard<00:03:29.260> in

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
I think we've really worked hard in

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.040 
I think we've really worked hard in

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.050 
thinking about what these tools allow us

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:33.720 
thinking about what these tools allow us
to<00:03:32.260> do<00:03:32.410> and<00:03:32.650> how<00:03:32.830> they<00:03:32.860> allow<00:03:33.280> us<00:03:33.460> to<00:03:33.580> help

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
to do and how they allow us to help

to do and how they allow us to help
