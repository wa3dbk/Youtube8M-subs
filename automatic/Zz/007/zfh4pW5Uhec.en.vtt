00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
of midland bands and and I think maybe

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.189

surprising as cave adding out a lot of

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:17.720 
surprising as cave adding out a lot of
things<00:00:16.350> that<00:00:16.560> I<00:00:16.590> would<00:00:16.800> assume<00:00:17.279> they<00:00:17.490> wanted

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
things that I would assume they wanted

plan to pan out this ourselves and but
then<00:00:25.550> yeah<00:00:26.550> are<00:00:26.820> we<00:00:27.029> kind<00:00:27.269> of<00:00:27.330> prepared<00:00:27.660> for

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
then yeah are we kind of prepared for

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.900 
then yeah are we kind of prepared for
blue<00:00:27.960> side<00:00:28.170> because<00:00:28.349> before<00:00:28.560> you<00:00:28.619> said<00:00:28.910> and

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910

blue side because before you said and
then<00:00:30.029> we<00:00:30.119> realized<00:00:30.480> that<00:00:30.539> you<00:00:30.720> guys<00:00:30.929> the

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
then we realized that you guys the

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.799 
then we realized that you guys the
purple<00:00:31.679> side<00:00:31.830> into<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.160> game<00:00:32.369> and<00:00:32.520> so<00:00:33.420> we<00:00:33.630> can

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
purple side into the game and so we can

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.200 
purple side into the game and so we can
adjust<00:00:34.079> did<00:00:34.860> fast<00:00:35.190> pics<00:00:35.489> and<00:00:35.700> it<00:00:35.790> was<00:00:35.910> kind<00:00:36.149> of

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
is it tristana brings I think currently

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:53.930 
is it tristana brings I think currently
true<00:00:52.710> son<00:00:52.890> is<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.190> safest<00:00:53.550> big<00:00:53.730> it's

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
true son is the safest big it's

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.880 
true son is the safest big it's
something<00:00:54.210> you<00:00:54.300> can<00:00:54.449> pick<00:00:54.600> very<00:00:54.840> early<00:00:55.170> just

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
something you can pick very early just

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.709 
something you can pick very early just
like<00:00:56.010> Lucien<00:00:56.370> before<00:00:56.969> you<00:00:57.030> got<00:00:57.149> disabled<00:00:57.600> I

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
like Lucien before you got disabled I

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.110 
like Lucien before you got disabled I
think<00:00:58.500> Lucian<00:00:58.949> is<00:00:59.129> probably<00:00:59.670> strong<00:00:59.940> and

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
think Lucian is probably strong and

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.939 
think Lucian is probably strong and
middling<00:01:00.359> right<00:01:00.510> now<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:00.899> while<00:01:01.649> I<00:01:01.680> wouldn't

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
middling right now and while I wouldn't

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.280 
middling right now and while I wouldn't
really<00:01:02.160> play<00:01:02.969> him<00:01:03.090> that<00:01:03.239> motion<00:01:03.570> in<00:01:03.930> Birdland

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
really play him that motion in Birdland

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.080 
really play him that motion in Birdland
because<00:01:04.320> he's<00:01:04.650> so<00:01:04.799> low<00:01:04.860> range<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:05.400> he<00:01:05.460> can<00:01:05.939> be

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
because he's so low range and he can be

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.240 
because he's so low range and he can be
tough<00:01:06.299> to<00:01:06.450> play<00:01:06.600> in<00:01:06.659> lynn<00:01:06.810> eephus<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.250> because

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
tough to play in lynn eephus and because

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.490 
tough to play in lynn eephus and because
currently<00:01:08.880> it's<00:01:09.090> all<00:01:09.390> about<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.900> long-range

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
currently it's all about the long-range

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.130 
currently it's all about the long-range
ad<00:01:10.650> carries<00:01:11.010> and<00:01:11.299> yeah<00:01:12.299> you<00:01:12.360> can<00:01:12.600> it<00:01:12.869> can<00:01:12.990> be<00:01:13.110> a

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
it can be a tough time if you have to

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.899 
it can be a tough time if you have to
face<00:01:15.540> against<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.200> more<00:01:16.409> tristana<00:01:17.159> also

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
guys kind of find your flow with those

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.760 
guys kind of find your flow with those
pics<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:32.180> you<00:01:33.180> know<00:01:33.329> this<00:01:33.840> game<00:01:34.290> was<00:01:34.470> really

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
pics and you know this game was really

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.520 
pics and you know this game was really
hard<00:01:34.920> for<00:01:34.979> us<00:01:35.159> because<00:01:35.310> we<00:01:35.759> got<00:01:35.909> out<00:01:36.030> pit<00:01:36.240> and

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
hard for us because we got out pit and

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.810 
hard for us because we got out pit and
it<00:01:37.530> was<00:01:37.740> very<00:01:37.950> hard<00:01:38.159> for<00:01:38.220> us<00:01:38.400> to<00:01:38.430> do<00:01:38.610> anything

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
it was very hard for us to do anything

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.030 
it was very hard for us to do anything
because<00:01:39.060> they<00:01:39.270> have<00:01:39.390> stronger<00:01:39.829> team<00:01:40.829> fights

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
because they have stronger team fights

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.770 
because they have stronger team fights
like<00:01:41.310> we<00:01:41.460> had<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:41.790> flank<00:01:42.030> them<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:42.420> we<00:01:42.509> had<00:01:42.659> to

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
like we had to flank them and we had to

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.600 
like we had to flank them and we had to
go<00:01:42.930> one<00:01:43.110> free<00:01:43.320> one<00:01:43.500> to<00:01:43.710> even<00:01:43.979> be<00:01:44.280> able<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:44.520> see

and<00:02:03.570> yet<00:02:03.990> you<00:02:04.170> guys<00:02:04.320> seem<00:02:04.560> to<00:02:04.590> engage<00:02:04.920> so<00:02:05.070> let's

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
and yet you guys seem to engage so let's

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.670 
and yet you guys seem to engage so let's
just<00:02:05.340> roll<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.610> clip<00:02:05.790> here<00:02:06.049> yes<00:02:07.049> I<00:02:07.170> think<00:02:07.530> all

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
just roll the clip here yes I think all

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
just roll the clip here yes I think all
the

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
the

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.130 
the
engage<00:02:08.970> was<00:02:09.119> really<00:02:09.360> really<00:02:09.509> good<00:02:09.569> but<00:02:10.110> I

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
engage was really really good but I

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.300 
engage was really really good but I
think<00:02:10.259> we<00:02:10.379> all<00:02:10.470> were<00:02:10.560> chased<00:02:10.770> a<00:02:10.920> little<00:02:11.190> bit

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
and we could just a walk safe out there

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.670 
and we could just a walk safe out there
and<00:02:13.290> go<00:02:13.470> down<00:02:13.530> blue<00:02:13.890> book<00:02:14.069> and<00:02:14.340> it's<00:02:15.060> tabi<00:02:15.300> just

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:16.909 
ourselves we're definitely focusing on
improving<00:04:15.660> and<00:04:16.200> with<00:04:16.349> this<00:04:16.470> one<00:04:16.680> you<00:04:16.709> actually

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
improving and with this one you actually

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:18.440 
improving and with this one you actually
locked<00:04:17.310> in<00:04:17.489> your<00:04:17.609> spot<00:04:17.820> in<00:04:18.060> the<00:04:18.299> playoffs

locked in your spot in the playoffs

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.300 
locked in your spot in the playoffs
which<00:04:18.989> is<00:04:19.200> a<00:04:19.260> huge<00:04:19.560> improvement<00:04:19.799> from<00:04:20.159> last

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
which is a huge improvement from last

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:21.479 
which is a huge improvement from last
foot<00:04:20.729> so

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
foot so

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:23.850 
foot so
the<00:04:21.759> mindset<00:04:22.180> now<00:04:22.660> now<00:04:22.990> you<00:04:23.050> have<00:04:23.470> locked<00:04:23.740> that

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
the mindset now now you have locked that

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.290 
the mindset now now you have locked that
place<00:04:24.069> in<00:04:24.220> and<00:04:24.340> there<00:04:24.460> is<00:04:24.580> a<00:04:24.610> really<00:04:25.030> real

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
place in and there is a really real

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.700 
place in and there is a really real
chance<00:04:25.630> if<00:04:25.840> you<00:04:25.870> guys<00:04:26.050> keep<00:04:26.289> fighting<00:04:26.590> that

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
chance if you guys keep fighting that

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.320 
chance if you guys keep fighting that
you<00:04:26.770> can<00:04:26.979> make<00:04:27.190> it<00:04:27.340> two<00:04:27.430> worlds<00:04:27.729> so<00:04:28.060> how<00:04:28.180> was

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
you can make it two worlds so how was

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.029 
you can make it two worlds so how was
the<00:04:28.360> atmosphere<00:04:28.569> going<00:04:29.080> around<00:04:29.229> that<00:04:29.319> and

00:04:30.029 --> 00:04:30.039 
the atmosphere going around that and

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:31.559 
the atmosphere going around that and
what<00:04:30.430> the<00:04:30.669> atmosphere<00:04:30.789> is<00:04:31.030> obviously<00:04:31.419> really

00:04:31.559 --> 00:04:31.569 
what the atmosphere is obviously really

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:33.210 
what the atmosphere is obviously really
good<00:04:31.810> but<00:04:32.050> we<00:04:32.530> are<00:04:32.620> still<00:04:32.680> trying<00:04:32.889> really<00:04:33.130> hard

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 
good but we are still trying really hard

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:34.529 
good but we are still trying really hard
to<00:04:33.430> win<00:04:33.669> the<00:04:33.759> next<00:04:33.880> color<00:04:34.090> matches<00:04:34.419> because

00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:34.539 
to win the next color matches because

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:36.300 
to win the next color matches because
there<00:04:34.750> is<00:04:34.870> still<00:04:35.139> a<00:04:35.169> chance<00:04:35.259> for<00:04:35.740> the<00:04:36.069> second

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
there is still a chance for the second

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.040 
there is still a chance for the second
place<00:04:36.460> I<00:04:36.610> believe<00:04:36.819> it's<00:04:37.599> gonna<00:04:37.690> be<00:04:37.810> really

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
place I believe it's gonna be really

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:39.570 
place I believe it's gonna be really
hard<00:04:38.139> and<00:04:38.470> it's<00:04:39.009> probably<00:04:39.190> not<00:04:39.400> going<00:04:39.520> to

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
hard and it's probably not going to

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.580 
hard and it's probably not going to
happen<00:04:39.729> but<00:04:40.180> we<00:04:40.690> have<00:04:40.840> to<00:04:40.960> improve<00:04:41.080> a<00:04:41.229> lot<00:04:41.380> if

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
happen but we have to improve a lot if

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:42.900 
happen but we have to improve a lot if
we<00:04:41.680> want<00:04:41.860> to<00:04:41.949> be<00:04:42.069> able<00:04:42.160> to<00:04:42.370> win<00:04:42.490> against<00:04:42.789> the
