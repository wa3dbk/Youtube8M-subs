good hit down the hall and the reason
for<00:04:08.230> that<00:04:08.380> is<00:04:08.500> when<00:04:09.160> Ali<00:04:09.310> gums<00:04:09.670> down<00:04:10.030> the<00:04:10.690> alarm

usually we also praised the horses for
the<00:04:15.910> same<00:04:16.120> reason<00:04:16.150> so<00:04:16.750> the<00:04:16.870> end<00:04:17.020> of<00:04:17.140> the<00:04:17.230> last

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
the same reason so the end of the last

the same reason so the end of the last
doesn't<00:04:18.160> get<00:04:18.220> caught<00:04:18.489> in<00:04:18.670> the<00:04:18.700> main<00:04:18.910> repair
