00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
 to which boys and girls and welcome to 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:05.490
 still scourge I am master maker today 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.730
 a lesson about sweets and my glasses 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.730
 lost 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:16.970
 lesson 1 candy crush my dreams and i have 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.529
 most people's glasses do 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.150
 of sweets and in a world of kenny 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:22.010
 I was seem to be enough 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.110
 or is that so and not this time 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.210
 a word from the lesson but a sentence and that 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:27.770
 is because I want my candy 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.270
 so say it again with me i want 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.890
 my sweets me too 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:32.180
 but imagine a bag of candy and you 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.070
 put it all piece by piece on the 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.629
 table with the next or so and you want 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.120
 they then sort them neatly 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:39.470
 is that a good plan no on one or 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.900
 other way if you decide three 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.969
 to put sweets next to each other than shit 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.160
 they disappear and that is not nice because 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:48.110
 I want my candy and then you think 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.879
 maybe but if I am more the three 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.649
 sticks what happens then whole 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:53.840
 simple that change those four or more 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:54.649
 candy in a candy and then you think 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.879
 Wow 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:57.739
 but that's okay then you have 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:00.469
 at least that one candy in one 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:01.910
 candy is probably the mistake and that's why 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:04.280
 is that wrong because you have that one candy 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.780
 never go taste what you put that one 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.020
 candy again next to another candy with 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.789
 the same color it is already gone and 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.590
 then even worse if you have five candies next 

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:14.210
 put together and had this change in 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.710
 a disco ball screw and like you 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.210
 then again to be different or 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.130
 all pike with that one disappear 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.420
 bring color from one candy already 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.490
 those sweets we disappear one color 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.250
 exploding from your life become cracks 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.030
 and I fill my candy and then you have 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.890
 chocolate 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.540
 I normally like chocolate check floor 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.950
 therefore also without alcohol because there 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.830
 makes me a chocolate chip cookie 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:36.170
 shake shack but in this I want chocolate 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.369
 some chocolate melts here and melts 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.110
 put the other candies that make you there 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:41.180
 no longer can it make it disappear 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.200
 it's about my sweets an i can 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.140
 no more 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.520
 and that's why I hate chocolate because I want to 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.380
 my 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.420
