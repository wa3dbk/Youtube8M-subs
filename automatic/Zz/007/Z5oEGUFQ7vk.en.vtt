play through the game multiple times one
thing<00:03:34.310> that<00:03:34.340> did<00:03:34.640> kind<00:03:34.849> of<00:03:35.000> bug<00:03:35.180> me<00:03:35.330> though<00:03:35.510> is

00:03:35.679 --> 00:03:35.689 
thing that did kind of bug me though is

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:37.390 
thing that did kind of bug me though is
that<00:03:35.720> there<00:03:35.989> is<00:03:36.140> some<00:03:36.470> backtracking<00:03:36.950> of<00:03:37.310> the

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
that there is some backtracking of the

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.280 
that there is some backtracking of the
game<00:03:37.579> now<00:03:37.970> it<00:03:38.209> actually<00:03:38.420> makes<00:03:38.750> sense<00:03:38.870> in<00:03:39.230> the

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
game now it actually makes sense in the

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.350 
game now it actually makes sense in the
context<00:03:39.739> of<00:03:39.799> the<00:03:39.890> plot<00:03:40.129> but<00:03:40.730> it<00:03:40.819> does<00:03:41.000> make<00:03:41.209> it

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 
context of the plot but it does make it

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.479 
context of the plot but it does make it
feel<00:03:41.390> like<00:03:41.930> the<00:03:41.959> Ishimura<00:03:42.409> is<00:03:42.799> smaller<00:03:43.220> than

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:43.489 
feel like the Ishimura is smaller than

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:45.429 
feel like the Ishimura is smaller than
it<00:03:43.640> actually<00:03:43.760> is<00:03:44.060> you're<00:03:44.900> always<00:03:45.170> going

00:03:45.429 --> 00:03:45.439 
it actually is you're always going

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:47.890 
it actually is you're always going
through<00:03:45.650> some<00:03:45.950> of<00:03:46.099> the<00:03:46.189> same<00:03:46.430> areas<00:03:46.900> luckily

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
through some of the same areas luckily

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.660 
through some of the same areas luckily
the<00:03:48.170> environments<00:03:48.650> are<00:03:48.739> varied<00:03:49.069> visually

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 
the environments are varied visually

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:51.759 
the environments are varied visually
enough<00:03:49.939> and<00:03:50.150> large<00:03:50.689> enough<00:03:50.989> to<00:03:51.230> make<00:03:51.590> up<00:03:51.739> for

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:51.769 
enough and large enough to make up for

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:53.530 
enough and large enough to make up for
that<00:03:52.040> but<00:03:52.489> it's<00:03:52.640> still<00:03:52.790> something<00:03:53.060> to<00:03:53.209> keep<00:03:53.390> in

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
that but it's still something to keep in

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.750 
that but it's still something to keep in
mind<00:03:53.599> dead<00:03:54.379> space<00:03:54.530> is<00:03:54.799> not<00:03:54.950> just<00:03:55.280> Resident
