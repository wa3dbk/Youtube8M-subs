a<00:03:37.599> lot<00:03:37.810> of<00:03:37.840> those<00:03:38.049> puppies<00:03:38.969> this<00:03:39.969> is<00:03:40.150> the<00:03:40.299> new

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
a lot of those puppies this is the new

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:43.140 
a lot of those puppies this is the new
generation<00:03:41.769> band<00:03:41.980> if<00:03:42.219> you<00:03:42.310> will<00:03:42.489> the<00:03:42.700> changes

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
generation band if you will the changes

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.119 
generation band if you will the changes
they've<00:03:43.359> made<00:03:43.389> this<00:03:43.719> bullying<00:03:44.079> that<00:03:44.260> goes<00:03:44.319> all

00:03:45.119 --> 00:03:45.129 
they've made this bullying that goes all

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:47.640 
they've made this bullying that goes all
the<00:03:45.159> way<00:03:45.370> around<00:03:45.659> it's<00:03:46.659> a<00:03:46.749> little<00:03:46.989> wider<00:03:47.230> it's

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
the way around it's a little wider it's

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.589 
the way around it's a little wider it's
all<00:03:47.829> softer<00:03:48.370> communities<00:03:48.909> I<00:03:49.209> think<00:03:49.239> because

00:03:49.589 --> 00:03:49.599 
all softer communities I think because

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:51.539 
all softer communities I think because
of<00:03:49.870> those<00:03:49.989> changes<00:03:50.590> what<00:03:50.799> their<00:03:51.010> slopes<00:03:51.310> and

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:51.549 
of those changes what their slopes and

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:53.399 
of those changes what their slopes and
erosions<00:03:51.760> will<00:03:52.120> be<00:03:52.239> less<00:03:52.629> common<00:03:53.049> what<00:03:53.260> they

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:53.409 
erosions will be less common what they

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:57.259 
erosions will be less common what they
are<00:03:53.499> now<00:03:53.709> posted<00:03:54.639> on<00:03:54.909> all<00:03:55.150> that<00:03:55.840> contract<00:03:56.349> and

then<00:03:58.269> the<00:03:58.389> last<00:03:58.420> risk<00:03:58.900> come<00:03:59.139> to<00:03:59.290> bring<00:03:59.500> up<00:03:59.620> is

00:03:59.789 --> 00:03:59.799 
then the last risk come to bring up is

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:01.830 
then the last risk come to bring up is

this about 12 thousand surgical
standpoint<00:04:13.970> there's<00:04:14.390> certainly<00:04:14.630> a<00:04:14.690> lot<00:04:14.750> less

go wrong compared to the bypass and my
