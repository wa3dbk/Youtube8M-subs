 You can play as a zombie who does 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.500

 buzz night run have in multiplayer and 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.019

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:04.700
 similar to the proposed back 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:06.650
 while the sniper team arrives in the 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.060

 hunt and kill everyone 

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:13.670
 the scene to the precarious although there are weapons 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:15.560
 in the game you will not want to 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.180
 waste them with zombies foot flip flops 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.280
 the ammunition is very meager player goes 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.170
 need to build efficient 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.299
 hand to hand combat for fights 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:28.030
 conventional knives are axes 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:30.970
 sticks and very different sticks 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.260
 performance the same on both consoles not 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.270
 you have to force nobody 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.650
 prejudiced since even clinton promised 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:37.959
 that the resolution of the frame rate of 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:42.090
 give light will be equal both xbox UN 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:44.020
 how much on playstation 4 1080p and 30 fps 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.850
 a lot to do 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:47.620
 the developer's promise is that for 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.630
 accomplish everything the game offers you 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.620
 will spend at least 50 hours 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.140
 It's good that you're not in a 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:58.989
 relationship today because 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:04:00.670
 seen right dubbing in Portuguese you 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:02.380
 prefers games with regionalization that 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.630
 include dubbing be quiet that 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:06.010
 daylights will offer noise adventures 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.840
 that God doubts 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.700
 The good news is that as a game it's being 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.650
 distributed by wb games here in brazil 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.819
 we will probably have a voiceover of 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.650
 great quality 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:16.630
 the blitz has been outstanding for hiring 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.880
 good studios to dub his last 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:21.729
 products that include batman chords 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:24.580
 shadow of moro and lego the hobbit 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:26.380
 he promised that he would not have been to 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:29.139
 developer of dae light and the 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:30.280
 Even if it had done, everyone was 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:32.169
 very disappointed to see that the 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:37.350
 narrative advertisement full of emotion 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:37.350
 of training ended up turning what kitty 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.350
 but until she said that at the time 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.030
 suffered much pressure the publisher had 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:48.040
 a small team had to hand over the 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:49.389
 things and in the end the project was 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.340
 quite different from what they wanted 

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:53.080
 Now that the franchise have been sold 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:54.550
 they wanted to do in their new game of 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.389
 a bis all that was not possible 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.680
 in the previous 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:58.680
 We hope it works out this time. 

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:27.220
 on an axis like the video so do not 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:29.050
 forget to give that strength with your 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:31.030
 And did you know that this is already the fourth 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:33.130
 warming that we have produced 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:35.169
 three others are here on the screen and to 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:37.000
 stay inside the next do not let 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:39.449
