good friends with mack brown the coach
of<00:02:20.940> texas<00:02:21.300> so<00:02:21.990> that's<00:02:22.200> a<00:02:22.320> possibility

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
of texas so that's a possibility

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.220 
of texas so that's a possibility
although<00:02:23.190> i<00:02:23.670> don't<00:02:23.970> think<00:02:24.690> that<00:02:24.810> they<00:02:24.930> that's

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
although i don't think that they that's

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.380 
although i don't think that they that's
where<00:02:25.440> they<00:02:25.560> would<00:02:25.680> go<00:02:25.710> as<00:02:26.610> far<00:02:26.670> as<00:02:26.880> limas<00:02:27.240> goes

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
where they would go as far as limas goes

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.810 
where they would go as far as limas goes
but<00:02:27.720> kelly<00:02:28.140> thomas<00:02:28.590> that's<00:02:29.340> a<00:02:29.490> strong

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
but kelly thomas that's a strong

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.970 
but kelly thomas that's a strong
possibility<00:02:29.880> if<00:02:30.780> they<00:02:30.960> go<00:02:31.080> defensive<00:02:31.560> end<00:02:31.800> i

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
possibility if they go defensive end i

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.080 
possibility if they go defensive end i

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
maybe in the second round a guy like

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.080 
maybe in the second round a guy like

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
jim zorn being their head coach because

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.460 
jim zorn being their head coach because
let's<00:02:44.250> be<00:02:44.310> honest<00:02:44.880> he<00:02:45.480> was<00:02:45.690> not<00:02:45.930> one<00:02:46.290> of<00:02:46.320> their

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
let's be honest he was not one of their

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.160 
let's be honest he was not one of their
top<00:02:46.680> selections<00:02:47.370> in<00:02:47.940> the<00:02:48.090> early<00:02:48.420> process<00:02:48.959> of

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
top selections in the early process of

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.949 
top selections in the early process of
looking<00:02:49.320> at<00:02:49.590> a<00:02:49.620> new<00:02:49.770> coach<00:02:50.450> yeah<00:02:51.450> you<00:02:51.810> know<00:02:51.930> I

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
looking at a new coach yeah you know I

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:53.780 
looking at a new coach yeah you know I
think<00:02:52.110> I<00:02:52.470> think<00:02:52.860> they<00:02:53.010> have<00:02:53.040> I<00:02:53.250> think<00:02:53.430> they're

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
think I think they have I think they're

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
think I think they have I think they're
still<00:02:53.940> going<00:02:54.090> to<00:02:54.180> be<00:02:54.270> a<00:02:54.300> wait-and-see

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
still going to be a wait-and-see

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.290 
still going to be a wait-and-see
mentality<00:02:55.560> because<00:02:55.880> nobody<00:02:56.880> not<00:02:57.060> even<00:02:57.090> the

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
mentality because nobody not even the

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.330 
mentality because nobody not even the
players<00:02:57.660> know<00:02:58.020> what<00:02:58.200> Jim's<00:02:58.410> gonna<00:02:58.530> do<00:02:58.920> he

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
players know what Jim's gonna do he

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.190 
players know what Jim's gonna do he
hasn't<00:02:59.700> even<00:02:59.760> addressed<00:03:00.270> the<00:03:00.420> whole<00:03:00.600> team<00:03:00.900> yet

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
hasn't even addressed the whole team yet

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.440 
hasn't even addressed the whole team yet
so<00:03:01.709> it's<00:03:02.280> really<00:03:02.580> hard<00:03:02.790> to<00:03:02.850> get<00:03:02.970> a<00:03:03.000> sense<00:03:03.060> of

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
so it's really hard to get a sense of

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.479 
so it's really hard to get a sense of
who<00:03:03.630> he<00:03:03.750> is<00:03:03.840> as<00:03:03.989> a<00:03:04.020> head<00:03:04.260> coach<00:03:04.290> I<00:03:04.860> think<00:03:05.310> for

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
who he is as a head coach I think for

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:08.300 
who he is as a head coach I think for
now<00:03:05.520> things<00:03:06.000> are<00:03:06.120> so<00:03:06.300> quiet<00:03:06.690> that<00:03:07.310> the

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
now things are so quiet that the

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:09.770 
now things are so quiet that the
Redskins<00:03:08.730> have<00:03:08.820> kind<00:03:09.000> of<00:03:09.060> fallen<00:03:09.570> off<00:03:09.750> the

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
Redskins have kind of fallen off the

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.229 
Redskins have kind of fallen off the
radar<00:03:10.050> and<00:03:10.620> it's<00:03:10.950> probably<00:03:11.280> good<00:03:11.489> for<00:03:11.520> for<00:03:12.060> Jim

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
radar and it's probably good for for Jim

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:13.760 
radar and it's probably good for for Jim
Zorn<00:03:12.480> right<00:03:12.720> now<00:03:12.840> just<00:03:13.020> kind<00:03:13.260> of<00:03:13.320> ease<00:03:13.560> into

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
Zorn right now just kind of ease into

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.100 
Zorn right now just kind of ease into
the<00:03:13.950> job<00:03:14.190> a<00:03:14.220> little<00:03:14.430> bit<00:03:14.580> but<00:03:15.480> certainly<00:03:15.870> he'll

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
the job a little bit but certainly he'll

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.560 
the job a little bit but certainly he'll
be<00:03:16.230> under<00:03:16.430> intense<00:03:17.430> scrutiny<00:03:17.580> come<00:03:18.120> August

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
be under intense scrutiny come August

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.840
