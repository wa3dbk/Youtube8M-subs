00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
you back to the base and what this is a

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.539 
you back to the base and what this is a
hat<00:01:53.759> then<00:01:54.030> you<00:01:54.299> would<00:01:54.450> actually<00:01:54.689> see<00:01:55.549> it's

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
it right now the first bits of it should

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.840 
it right now the first bits of it should
stop<00:02:03.420> fashioning<00:02:03.990> green<00:02:04.229> and<00:02:04.670> we're<00:02:05.670> just

stop fashioning green and we're just
telling<00:02:06.119> you<00:02:06.390> now<00:02:06.420> you've<00:02:06.780> done<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.110> first

00:02:07.309 --> 00:02:07.319 
telling you now you've done the first

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:09.199 
telling you now you've done the first
that<00:02:07.590> we've<00:02:07.770> got<00:02:07.950> two<00:02:08.130> more<00:02:08.310> steps<00:02:08.640> to<00:02:08.819> do<00:02:08.970> in<00:02:09.149> a

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
that we've got two more steps to do in a

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.420 
that we've got two more steps to do in a
way<00:02:09.390> to<00:02:10.319> get<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.619> rocket<00:02:10.950> launch<00:02:11.130> so<00:02:11.370> you

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
way to get the rocket launch so you

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.520 
way to get the rocket launch so you
could<00:02:11.610> go<00:02:11.760> by<00:02:12.000> the<00:02:12.060> pack<00:02:12.450> punch<00:02:12.750> now<00:02:13.410> I'm

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
could go by the pack punch now I'm

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.520 
could go by the pack punch now I'm
actually<00:02:13.680> go<00:02:13.920> into<00:02:14.160> the<00:02:14.280> second<00:02:15.019> point<00:02:16.019> where

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
actually go into the second point where

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.130 
actually go into the second point where
the<00:02:16.799> Landers<00:02:17.250> I<00:02:17.430> could<00:02:17.580> call<00:02:17.760> the<00:02:17.880> lander<00:02:18.330> in<00:02:18.600> a

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
the Landers I could call the lander in a

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.449 
the Landers I could call the lander in a
way<00:02:19.319> and<00:02:20.900> it's<00:02:21.900> right<00:02:22.290> at<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:22.620> top<00:02:23.069> of<00:02:23.100> the

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
way and it's right at the top of the

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.330 
way and it's right at the top of the
brief<00:02:23.640> which<00:02:24.030> should<00:02:24.840> be<00:02:25.080> you<00:02:25.290> know<00:02:25.350> anyway

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
brief which should be you know anyway

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
brief which should be you know anyway
you<00:02:26.400> know<00:02:26.549> by<00:02:26.730> the<00:02:26.790> way<00:02:26.910> you<00:02:27.000> need<00:02:27.150> to<00:02:27.239> have

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
you know by the way you need to have

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.729 
you know by the way you need to have
some<00:02:27.569> money<00:02:27.720> because<00:02:28.019> you<00:02:28.140> need<00:02:28.260> to<00:02:28.380> open<00:02:28.530> a

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
some money because you need to open a

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:30.800 
some money because you need to open a
few<00:02:28.920> gates<00:02:29.430> or<00:02:29.730> doors<00:02:30.000> where<00:02:30.269> we<00:02:30.390> when<00:02:30.510> I<00:02:30.540> call

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
few gates or doors where we when I call

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.860 
few gates or doors where we when I call
them<00:02:30.930> on<00:02:31.080> the<00:02:31.290> way<00:02:31.440> to<00:02:31.680> get<00:02:32.340> to<00:02:32.670> the<00:02:33.480> lander

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
them on the way to get to the lander

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.199 
them on the way to get to the lander
points<00:02:34.410> we<00:02:34.980> could<00:02:35.160> call<00:02:35.430> the<00:02:35.489> lender<00:02:35.819> in<00:02:35.970> and

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
points we could call the lender in and

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.620 
points we could call the lender in and
then<00:02:36.330> use<00:02:36.540> it<00:02:36.569> again<00:02:36.989> and<00:02:37.910> yeah<00:02:38.910> just<00:02:39.299> hang

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
then use it again and yeah just hang

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.539 
then use it again and yeah just hang
around<00:02:39.660> wait<00:02:40.380> for<00:02:40.530> the<00:02:40.590> land<00:02:40.799> and<00:02:41.040> hopefully

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:41.549 
around wait for the land and hopefully

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:44.990 
around wait for the land and hopefully
come<00:02:41.790> soon<00:02:43.190> scope<00:02:44.190> of<00:02:44.310> things<00:02:44.430> you<00:02:44.609> know<00:02:44.760> I'll

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
come soon scope of things you know I'll

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.580 
come soon scope of things you know I'll
be<00:02:45.209> I'll<00:02:45.299> be<00:02:45.329> doing<00:02:45.630> another<00:02:45.690> tutorial<00:02:46.200> Xena

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
be I'll be doing another tutorial Xena

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.039 
be I'll be doing another tutorial Xena
shown<00:02:46.799> you<00:02:46.950> how<00:02:47.609> to<00:02:47.640> get<00:02:48.269> the<00:02:48.420> Bears<00:02:48.660> and<00:02:48.900> this

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
shown you how to get the Bears and this

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:53.790 
shown you how to get the Bears and this
Russian<00:02:49.320> joy<00:02:49.709> and<00:02:49.829> all<00:02:49.890> that<00:02:50.040> stuff

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.670 

yep<00:02:54.460> lambda<00:02:54.970> is<00:02:55.180> here<00:02:55.450> and<00:02:55.840> now<00:02:56.140> we<00:02:56.200> need<00:02:56.530> to

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
yep lambda is here and now we need to

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.410 
yep lambda is here and now we need to
use<00:02:56.860> it<00:02:57.070> again<00:02:57.460> to<00:02:57.820> go<00:02:58.210> back<00:02:58.240> to<00:02:58.660> the<00:02:58.780> base<00:02:58.960> and

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
use it again to go back to the base and

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.380 
use it again to go back to the base and
it<00:03:01.420> cost<00:03:01.660> you<00:03:01.810> 250<00:03:02.380> points<00:03:03.010> every<00:03:03.820> time<00:03:03.850> you

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
it cost you 250 points every time you

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.380 
it cost you 250 points every time you
use<00:03:04.540> the<00:03:04.570> land<00:03:04.870> up<00:03:05.340> which<00:03:06.340> is<00:03:06.490> not<00:03:06.700> much<00:03:06.940> really

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
use the land up which is not much really

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.000 
use the land up which is not much really
I<00:03:07.690> don't<00:03:08.170> believe<00:03:08.440> it<00:03:08.560> about<00:03:08.770> 750<00:03:09.670> points<00:03:11.010> you

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
I don't believe it about 750 points you

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.350 
I don't believe it about 750 points you
know<00:03:12.160> for<00:03:12.370> the<00:03:12.430> three<00:03:12.640> times<00:03:12.910> you<00:03:13.090> have<00:03:13.180> to<00:03:13.330> use

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
know for the three times you have to use

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.080 
know for the three times you have to use
the<00:03:13.600> land<00:03:13.780> down<00:03:14.020> to<00:03:14.320> get<00:03:14.620> the<00:03:15.090> rocket

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
the land down to get the rocket

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.740 
the land down to get the rocket
activated<00:03:17.580> now<00:03:18.580> we<00:03:18.640> back<00:03:18.970> gave<00:03:19.270> to<00:03:19.450> the<00:03:19.570> base

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
activated now we back gave to the base

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.960 
activated now we back gave to the base
and<00:03:20.080> you<00:03:20.320> can<00:03:20.350> see<00:03:20.500> the<00:03:20.830> second<00:03:21.340> base<00:03:21.580> like

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
and you can see the second base like

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.110 
and you can see the second base like
flash<00:03:22.770> in<00:03:23.770> green<00:03:24.100> as<00:03:24.280> well<00:03:24.460> and<00:03:24.760> now<00:03:24.880> we've<00:03:25.030> got

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
flash in green as well and now we've got

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.830 
flash in green as well and now we've got
one<00:03:25.330> more<00:03:25.510> bit<00:03:25.720> which<00:03:26.970> probably<00:03:27.970> is<00:03:28.210> not<00:03:28.510> and

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
one more bit which probably is not and

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.900 
one more bit which probably is not and
if<00:03:28.960> you<00:03:28.990> don't<00:03:29.110> I'm<00:03:29.590> one<00:03:30.370> much<00:03:30.550> I'm<00:03:30.760> actually

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
if you don't I'm one much I'm actually

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.640 
if you don't I'm one much I'm actually
gonna<00:03:31.210> show<00:03:31.420> anyway<00:03:33.210> so<00:03:34.210> I'm<00:03:34.840> showing<00:03:35.410> here

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
gonna show anyway so I'm showing here

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.680 
gonna show anyway so I'm showing here
that<00:03:35.710> the<00:03:36.550> last<00:03:36.760> bit<00:03:37.000> is<00:03:37.120> still<00:03:37.330> a<00:03:37.390> little<00:03:37.570> I

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
that the last bit is still a little I

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:39.600 
that the last bit is still a little I
bet<00:03:37.960> you're<00:03:38.110> shooting<00:03:38.470> a<00:03:38.590> tip<00:03:38.860> some<00:03:39.130> reason

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:39.610 
bet you're shooting a tip some reason

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.820 
bet you're shooting a tip some reason
I'm<00:03:40.330> just<00:03:40.390> kind<00:03:40.840> of<00:03:40.900> showed<00:03:41.140> y'all<00:03:41.440> this<00:03:41.620> one

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:41.830 
I'm just kind of showed y'all this one

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.810 
I'm just kind of showed y'all this one
will<00:03:41.980> get<00:03:42.100> still<00:03:42.430> there<00:03:42.670> and<00:03:44.310> yeah<00:03:45.310> and<00:03:45.580> I'm

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:45.820

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:50.390 
will get still there and yeah and I'm
just<00:03:45.850> running<00:03:46.600> to<00:03:46.870> get<00:03:47.080> to<00:03:47.320> the<00:03:47.440> third<00:03:49.110> Lander

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
just running to get to the third Lander

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.770 
just running to get to the third Lander
point<00:03:51.400> or<00:03:51.700> spots<00:03:52.030> where<00:03:52.300> you're<00:03:52.390> gonna<00:03:52.480> call

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
point or spots where you're gonna call

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:59.460 
point or spots where you're gonna call
it<00:03:52.930> and<00:03:54.480> and<00:03:55.650> it's<00:03:56.650> here<00:03:57.040> at<00:03:57.490> the<00:03:57.700> back<00:03:58.080> of<00:03:59.080> the

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
it and and it's here at the back of the

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:05.400 
it and and it's here at the back of the
map<00:04:01.740> takes<00:04:02.740> about<00:04:03.720> not<00:04:04.720> long<00:04:04.959> it<00:04:05.140> takes<00:04:05.320> about

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.410 
map takes about not long it takes about

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:09.090 
map takes about not long it takes about
six<00:04:06.160> or<00:04:06.490> about<00:04:07.180> six<00:04:07.480> seconds<00:04:08.050> for<00:04:08.770> the<00:04:08.890> ladder

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:09.100 
six or about six seconds for the ladder

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:10.740 
six or about six seconds for the ladder
to<00:04:09.370> get<00:04:09.550> tail<00:04:09.880> probably<00:04:10.300> a<00:04:10.420> little<00:04:10.570> bit

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
to get tail probably a little bit

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:11.600
