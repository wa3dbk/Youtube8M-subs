00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.540
 in a past issue we talked about the 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.510
 entries to the ring of the fighters of the 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:23.670
 company to triple-a free night and many 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.800
 they were asking and I asked for their 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.259
 comments about if they wanted the entrance 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.509
 of the wrestlers of the world council of 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:33.210
 wrestling is why here they 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:35.730
 I present my top 5 entries 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:39.079
 fighters from the world council of 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.079
 wrestling we begin 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.580
 i 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.049
 let's start this top by listing 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:15.540
 from number 5 to number 1 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.210
 considering that the number 1 is the best 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.310
 remember that this top is very personal 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.220
 so I invite you at the end of this 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:27.210
 leave in your comments for you what is 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.429
 your top from 1 to 5 and start at 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.979
 number 5 this putting a cluster 

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:34.920
 of the wrestling world council that 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:38.299
 has caused a lot of stir it is about 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.299
 the ungovernable 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:48.920
 and these fighters have used 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.079
 different entrances to the ring and something that 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.689
 it is very characteristic is that 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:56.119
 time of submission will remove the 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:59.030
 microphone to the presenter and themselves 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:01.549
 they present themselves as they comment that for 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:04.189
 present a fighter simply what 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:06.109
 can present another fighter for this and 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:09.200
 other things that they have used in their 

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:12.879
 the ungovernable entries are 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.879
 in place number 5 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.440
 in place number 4 we are going to put 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.590
 another group and we 're 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.870
 mentioning the plague black the plague 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.650
 black girl who enters with that singular dance 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:43.680
 of cumbia and with different outfits 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:45.870
 that the plague is very dirty 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.959
 black is why that name because they are 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:51.540
 the plague is the stinky and sometimes 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:54.000
 they take out garbage from stained trash cans 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:57.300
 garbage with giant hats with garbage 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.180
 painted faces and that little dance they do 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.400
 when entering the ring that's why it 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:05.700
 They are in place as No. 4 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:08.489
 his entrance is very cool and above all very 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:11.090
 innovative in the world council of 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.090
 wrestling 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.220
 Oh no 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:19.849
 for 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:30.000
 and in place three we are going to put a 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.130
 fighter who has already made history in the 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.640
 world wrestling council with another 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.610
 fighter 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.980
 we are talking about mystic mystic 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:40.890
 when the port the current my thesis 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:43.560
 he made a story but currently the 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:47.100
 that uses the character of mystic beam 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:49.590
 backpacks tickets for example the remix 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:52.950
 he uses in his background music was 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:55.290
 less remix is ​​very cool and that can 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.930
 be a pair of waters in comparison between 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.600
 the ancient mystic and the present mystic 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.490
 likewise the play of lights that 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:05.490
 uses the world fight council 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:07.590
 free to temporarily turn off some 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:09.960
 seats in the ring and put on 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:12.300
 white reflectors help the 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:15.120
 mystic the new era make an entrance 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.830
 spectacular is why the mystic 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:21.410
 the new era is placed in the place 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:21.410
 number 3 of this top 5 

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:55.240
 and it's no question the two places 

00:04:52.749 --> 00:04:57.879
 they are for me the two fighters number 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:00.129
 one of the world wrestling council and 

00:04:57.879 --> 00:05:02.889
 let's put in place number two a 

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:05.650
 the tradition and in this case you find 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:08.589

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:11.080
 traditional with coat moving hands 

00:05:08.589 --> 00:05:13.659
 greeting the public as they did 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:16.240
 wrestlers of yesteryear reminds us of the 

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:18.580
 origins of Mexican wrestling is 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:21.699
 that's why seeing and entering atlantis is 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:24.580
 see and remember what the fight was like before 

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:27.219
 Mexican free is why they remember 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:29.349
 who says remember is to live for that 

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:32.620
 atlantis is in the number place 

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:34.740

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.740

 different outfits to enter the river and 

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:30.710
 that typical song of queens that uses 

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:33.200
 that song that is already iconic in the 

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:36.320

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:39.230
