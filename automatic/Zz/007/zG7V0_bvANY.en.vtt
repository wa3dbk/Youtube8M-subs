00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.330
 hello his league 1 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.400
 I always greet them very much like 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.800
 usually perfect then today 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.650
 we have prepared a nice recipe a 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.619
 pavlova quite with a dome of 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.199
 chocolate ganache and cream walls of films 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.510
 or so for our set for the accord 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.750
 we are going to need 150 g of 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:34.530
 egg whites a pinch of salt 50 g of 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.780
 semolina sugar 135 g icing sugar and 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.739
 135 g of almond powder for the 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.510
 chocolate ganache 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.780
 we will need 200 g of chocolate 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.850
 black of 20 centilitres or 200 g of cream 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.770
 fresh a little pinch of hot pepper 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.520
 of espelette of a little half- salted butter 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:53.809
 50 grams for fig cream 125 g 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.399
 of mascarpone and 3 figc that smell 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:01:00.840
 wonderfully good and of course 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:02.609
 the cool walls of the garden a plane but 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.030
 the whites date crazy to ride them in 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:09.119
 snow is perfect so there a raffle 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:12.450
 speed bottomed down first 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.010
 speed again faces a bad 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.869
 then we can add salt but 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.450
 it is the fact of not being alarmed 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.770
 speed is to hide bloggers 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.330
 which show that they are much more 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.869
 closes in addition to the salt that goes them 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.759
 strengthen 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.370
 we will have a meringue that goes well 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:29.710
 hold on so here we are 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:33.630
 first one we will be able to add on 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.630
 the south has shot 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.670
 there now we can stop we stop 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.890
 we stay hooked to ps 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.259
 and that's where we'll add our 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.310
 almond powder previously sieved 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:48.610
 with icing sugar 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.770
 a first third of meringue in the 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.750
 powder in the blended powder so there 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.009
 we will mix with our faith well 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.530
 obviously when we can see that 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:59.770
 mix not too much not too much but that 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.450
 allows us to break our egg whites 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.409
 okay okay so there they see 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.470
 that egg white mont are slightly 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:07.840
 broken and I can take a slump and 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.580
 then I mix gently into 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.830
 incorporating a maximum of air 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.110
 I always put walls of my 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.030
 salad bowl yet we see for us 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.709
 but not to actually cross all your 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.350
 adsea gloves quite especially 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.880
 for women that our nadal powder must 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:23.290
 to be another bowl otherwise we would have a 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:33.220
 mixture that would not be homogeneous 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:37.780
 hockey at 160 degrees we have about so we 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:39.850
 let's heat our chalk we're going 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:43.450
 let them blunder and then 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:46.000
 boeing and then we go into pouring 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.230
 this cream on chocolate carrots 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.200
 on chocolates 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.239
 if you mix a ganache with a whip 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.010
 we will incorporate air what wants 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:55.900
 to say that when we cast our ganesh 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.120
 and there will be small bubbles of air 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.980
 and the advantage is also with the 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.190
 maryse we have something that will 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:06.070
 shiny and as we took a butter 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:09.130
 half salt the salt will allow to 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:12.790
 enhance the flavor of chocolate for 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:17.920
 finish the chef's attitude a little bit of 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:19.720
 chili and here in Quebec costing 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.700
 mahalla not bad ball question I think 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.739
 it's time for mussels and well 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.820
 obviously for the recipe we learned from 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:27.280
 donations because we wanted to be 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:30.340
 pleasure if you do not have a dome it's not 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.620
 serious we mold our ganache in a 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.769
 flat of the same diameter as our 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:38.410
 dacquoise we take it apart and 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:40.959
 then we just have to unmould 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.350
 ganache on our okay leg well 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.500
 m 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:47.510
 it works abbas is gone 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.890
 so now place the cream of yarn 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:52.610
 we have our beautiful pictures 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:53.870
 we're going to peel them you're going too fast 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:04:08.060
 gonna find me say that I have not even 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:04:17.720
 so finish then we're still there 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:19.760
 poor at the bar this neighborhood so it's 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:23.510
 there now our fig mascarpone 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:26.990
 to put in pocket we did not bet 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:28.820
 bushings to our in our pocket as we 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.610
 to the girls' songs that would risk 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:34.100
 to get stuck with donations so now 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:37.180
 I even take out the dacquoise stuffed with 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:43.940
 using a knife I will detail 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:48.919
 downstream from the then know family talent 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:51.080
 you that the ganache is born from a recipe 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:52.940
 to miss is an apprentice who has 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.669
 developed and instead of putting the 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:58.550
 chocolate to melt he poured cream 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:05:01.520
 hot on the cold chocolate his boss 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:03.560
 angry the treat of ganache garnache 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:06.470
 it's a jerk in old French 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:09.500
 and after tasting the boss said to himself 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:11.570
 it's not bad it's there and we 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:15.200
 will keep this name there so there you me 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:18.290
 treats of morons I will allow myself so 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:21.710
 a global pack that was made in 

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:25.270
 tribute to the queen of ballerinas anna 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:28.760
 Pavlova during his trip to Australia 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:30.979
 the Australians the New Zealanders is fighting 

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:33.950
 to be at the origin of the creation of 

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:36.169
 these beautiful is a dessert in duo 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:37.220
 beautifully realized I think I have 

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:39.260
