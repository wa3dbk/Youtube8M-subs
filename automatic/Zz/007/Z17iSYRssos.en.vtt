00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:24.829
 champions of italy and perhaps more combative to escape from its genre 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:28.499
 when there was loi sugar robinson 

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:31.619
 what it meant to be a living land

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:05.510
 avoid it 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:10.730
 but in the end I think it is the demand for personal life to be measured 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.500
 experiment of evil and pain 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.960
