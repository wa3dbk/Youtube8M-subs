00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:07.330
 here I have practically changed 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:11.160
 changed the pump this is a little more 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:13.840
 powerful than the previous one 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.029
 instead of to circulate the water from the 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:21.909
 surface I did inter's too 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:25.079
 on the floating cube based on how much 

00:00:21.909 --> 00:00:28.329
 water he needs the pump sucks up the water 

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:36.100
 lowering the tube by letting in more 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:41.289
 water level alone this is always e 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:45.640
 self-leveling then returns the only in 

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:47.859
 vertical or increased position 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.739
 inside the buoyancy I put 

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:53.199
 larger polystyrene if it appears 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:57.850
 largest he aspired to the tube 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:01:01.469
 finished float then increasing the 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:04.869
 polystyrene manages to stay afloat 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:08.290
 and I have to say that this time a lot 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:09.670
 much much more powerful also sucks 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.500
 leaves because I have enlarged the flanges 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.890
 just big played did a little more 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.890
 wide 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.969
 the small pump here 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:32.980
 a pump that has a pre-filter then le 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:36.390
 leaves stop there began the 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:36.390
 characteristics of guilt 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:50.280
 in a few minutes there was the pool that was 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:58.730
 chock full of dirt leaves 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:02:02.490
 practically out of everything and then with 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:05.700
 a bottle that I also made a 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:12.480
 previous video this time should be used if 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:15.540
 flora that does not ask for sea ​​here is fun 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:20.450
 below is the cap there are gods 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.450
 holes around the bottle 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:32.910
 bottled nothing may remain afloat 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:35.850
 so it slowly dissolves chlorine 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:38.570
 granular without leaving pupils stains 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:42.570
 under the pool 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:45.720
 here you are there you managed to come 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:52.310
 under their diffusion now and chorus motions 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:52.310
 stories through the bikini I practiced 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:11.980
 the only fact of seeing it as below 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:13.690
 then that is a 100 tube tube 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:18.910
 you must attach the suction to the hose 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:23.170
 inside and empty then this is the second 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:26.019
 polystyrene piece because they are two common 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:28.050
 that make a bit of a seal because i 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:34.750
 my doubts are not perfectly 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:39.239
 precise insertion 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.239
 here it is and back to his work
