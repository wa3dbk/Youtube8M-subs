00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
benefit is that it's got this little

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.690 
benefit is that it's got this little
kickstand<00:00:49.940> so<00:00:50.870> can<00:00:51.020> stand<00:00:51.200> by<00:00:51.320> itself<00:00:51.640> this<00:00:52.640> is

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:52.700 
kickstand so can stand by itself this is

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.030 
kickstand so can stand by itself this is
quite<00:00:53.150> a<00:00:53.180> nifty<00:00:53.510> feature<00:00:53.840> and<00:00:54.200> I<00:00:54.290> do<00:00:54.350> like<00:00:54.680> it

more<00:01:25.780> unstable<00:01:27.100> alright<00:01:28.130> whereas<00:01:28.670> the<00:01:28.790> red

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:28.940 
more unstable alright whereas the red

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.530 
more unstable alright whereas the red

actually<00:05:04.190> like<00:05:04.520> this<00:05:04.790> I<00:05:06.490> know<00:05:07.490> if<00:05:07.669> you<00:05:07.760> see

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000 
actually like this I know if you see

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.880 
actually like this I know if you see
there<00:05:08.419> you<00:05:08.450> go<00:05:08.660> so<00:05:09.200> when<00:05:09.320> I'm<00:05:09.410> pushing<00:05:09.620> off

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:09.890 
there you go so when I'm pushing off

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:12.909 
there you go so when I'm pushing off
it's<00:05:10.880> kind<00:05:11.120> of<00:05:11.150> like<00:05:11.300> that<00:05:11.560> it's<00:05:12.560> kind<00:05:12.770> of<00:05:12.800> like

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:12.919 
it's kind of like that it's kind of like

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:14.380 
it's kind of like that it's kind of like
a<00:05:12.950> snowboarding<00:05:13.430> stance<00:05:13.700> but<00:05:13.910> at<00:05:14.000> least<00:05:14.090> I<00:05:14.270> can

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:14.390 
a snowboarding stance but at least I can

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:15.700 
a snowboarding stance but at least I can
get<00:05:14.479> both<00:05:14.630> of<00:05:14.810> my<00:05:14.900> foot<00:05:15.169> on<00:05:15.200> there<00:05:15.440> when<00:05:15.590> I'm

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:15.710 
get both of my foot on there when I'm

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:20.610 
get both of my foot on there when I'm
cruising<00:05:17.050> so<00:05:18.050> let's<00:05:18.560> do<00:05:18.979> it<00:05:19.010> ride<00:05:19.250> method

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:20.620

and<00:05:32.430> now<00:05:32.820> you<00:05:32.880> know<00:05:33.030> the<00:05:33.150> differences<00:05:33.449> between

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:33.630 
and now you know the differences between

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:37.249 
and now you know the differences between
the<00:05:33.870> red<00:05:34.020> and<00:05:34.050> the<00:05:34.199> blue<00:05:34.410> as<00:05:34.620> well<00:05:35.960> so<00:05:36.960> a<00:05:36.990> small

00:05:37.249 --> 00:05:37.259 
the red and the blue as well so a small

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:38.930 
the red and the blue as well so a small
upgrade<00:05:37.650> was<00:05:37.860> to<00:05:37.979> get<00:05:38.100> the<00:05:38.220> bones<00:05:38.490> red

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:38.940 
upgrade was to get the bones red

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:42.129 
upgrade was to get the bones red

bearings<00:06:10.350> same<00:06:10.770> size<00:06:11.419> you<00:06:12.419> see<00:06:12.720> I<00:06:13.020> just<00:06:13.740> want

00:06:14.029 --> 00:06:14.039 
bearings same size you see I just want

00:06:14.039 --> 00:06:17.000 
bearings same size you see I just want
to<00:06:14.100> show<00:06:14.250> you<00:06:14.310> the<00:06:15.680> disgusting<00:06:16.680> rolling

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:17.010 
to show you the disgusting rolling

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:19.159 
to show you the disgusting rolling
resistance<00:06:17.160> look<00:06:17.880> at<00:06:18.000> this<00:06:18.210> so<00:06:18.780> the<00:06:18.930> front

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:19.169 
resistance look at this so the front

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:22.040 
resistance look at this so the front
reel<00:06:19.320> has<00:06:19.590> the<00:06:19.800> bounce<00:06:20.039> and<00:06:20.690> the<00:06:21.690> back<00:06:21.900> wheel

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:22.050 
reel has the bounce and the back wheel

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:24.560 
reel has the bounce and the back wheel
has<00:06:22.320> the<00:06:22.470> original<00:06:22.970> so<00:06:23.970> if<00:06:24.060> you<00:06:24.150> take<00:06:24.330> a<00:06:24.360> look

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:24.570 
has the original so if you take a look

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:26.120 
has the original so if you take a look
at<00:06:24.660> the<00:06:24.750> rolling<00:06:25.080> resistance<00:06:25.349> let's<00:06:25.949> take<00:06:26.099> a

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:26.130 
at the rolling resistance let's take a

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:28.339 
at the rolling resistance let's take a
look<00:06:26.310> so<00:06:27.030> go<00:06:27.180> like<00:06:27.300> that<00:06:27.539> and<00:06:27.960> I'll<00:06:28.139> do<00:06:28.259> the

00:06:28.339 --> 00:06:28.349 
look so go like that and I'll do the

00:06:28.349 --> 00:06:29.469 
look so go like that and I'll do the
same<00:06:28.410> thing

00:06:29.469 --> 00:06:29.479 
same thing

00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:33.529 
same thing
I'll<00:06:30.479> even<00:06:30.630> spend<00:06:31.380> an<00:06:31.440> extra<00:06:31.680> fast<00:06:32.389> but<00:06:33.389> look

00:06:33.529 --> 00:06:33.539 
I'll even spend an extra fast but look

00:06:33.539 --> 00:06:37.100 
I'll even spend an extra fast but look
how<00:06:33.690> much<00:06:33.870> smoother<00:06:34.710> the<00:06:35.610> bones<00:06:35.820> in<00:06:35.970> the<00:06:36.930> rear

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:37.110 
how much smoother the bones in the rear

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:39.260 
how much smoother the bones in the rear
wheels<00:06:37.289> already<00:06:37.500> stopped<00:06:37.860> the<00:06:38.729> front<00:06:38.970> wheels

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:39.270 
wheels already stopped the front wheels

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:41.180 
wheels already stopped the front wheels
still<00:06:39.419> going<00:06:39.750> in<00:06:40.229> fact<00:06:40.440> I'm<00:06:40.830> going<00:06:40.949> to<00:06:41.010> keep

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:41.190 
still going in fact I'm going to keep

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:44.779 
still going in fact I'm going to keep
pushing<00:06:41.610> the<00:06:43.400> there<00:06:44.400> we<00:06:44.490> go

00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:44.789 
pushing the there we go

00:06:44.789 --> 00:06:47.350 
pushing the there we go
come<00:06:45.090> on<00:06:45.180> back<00:06:45.360> wheel<00:06:45.510> keep<00:06:45.690> it<00:06:45.780> going<00:06:46.220> nope

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:47.360 
come on back wheel keep it going nope

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:50.480 
come on back wheel keep it going nope
and<00:06:48.360> as<00:06:48.690> you<00:06:48.810> can<00:06:48.900> see<00:06:48.960> the<00:06:49.919> front<00:06:50.190> wheel<00:06:50.340> still

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:50.490 
and as you can see the front wheel still

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:52.490 
and as you can see the front wheel still
going<00:06:50.760> that's<00:06:50.970> how<00:06:51.120> much<00:06:51.300> of<00:06:51.570> a<00:06:52.320> big

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:52.500 
going that's how much of a big

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:55.129 
going that's how much of a big
difference<00:06:52.650> these<00:06:53.010> bearings<00:06:53.370> make<00:06:54.080> so<00:06:55.080> you

00:06:55.129 --> 00:06:55.139 
difference these bearings make so you

00:06:55.139 --> 00:06:57.920 
difference these bearings make so you
definitely<00:06:55.500> go<00:06:56.130> a<00:06:56.159> lot<00:06:56.460> farther<00:06:56.729> on<00:06:57.090> one<00:06:57.659> push

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:57.930 
definitely go a lot farther on one push

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:02.059 
definitely go a lot farther on one push
and

00:07:02.059 --> 00:07:02.069 

00:07:02.069 --> 00:07:05.299 

and<00:07:02.610> do<00:07:03.059> that<00:07:03.180> a<00:07:03.240> couple<00:07:03.270> times<00:07:03.509> and<00:07:04.159> still<00:07:05.159> the

00:07:05.299 --> 00:07:05.309 
and do that a couple times and still the

00:07:05.309 --> 00:07:07.640 
and do that a couple times and still the
front<00:07:05.520> wheel<00:07:05.639> out<00:07:05.789> spins<00:07:06.119> back<00:07:06.360> wheel<00:07:06.619> by<00:07:07.619> a

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:07.650 
front wheel out spins back wheel by a

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:10.939 
front wheel out spins back wheel by a
lot<00:07:08.360> so<00:07:09.360> there<00:07:09.569> you<00:07:09.629> go<00:07:09.779> updated<00:07:10.499> bearings<00:07:10.770> on

00:07:10.939 --> 00:07:10.949 
lot so there you go updated bearings on

00:07:10.949 --> 00:07:21.239 
lot so there you go updated bearings on
the<00:07:11.339> razor<00:07:11.659> 85<00:07:12.659> luxe
