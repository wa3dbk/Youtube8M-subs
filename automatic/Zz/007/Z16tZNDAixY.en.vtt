so<00:02:15.860> when<00:02:15.980> I<00:02:16.099> played<00:02:16.340> music<00:02:16.519> my<00:02:16.849> hobby<00:02:17.060> was<00:02:17.180> to

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
so when I played music my hobby was to

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.539 
so when I played music my hobby was to
put<00:02:17.659> together<00:02:17.959> those<00:02:18.349> little<00:02:18.680> circuits<00:02:19.190> and

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:19.549 
put together those little circuits and

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:21.220 
put together those little circuits and
you<00:02:19.610> play<00:02:19.819> around<00:02:20.060> with<00:02:20.269> it<00:02:20.450> or<00:02:20.629> I<00:02:20.870> had

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
you play around with it or I had

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.110 
you play around with it or I had
different<00:02:21.560> amplifiers<00:02:21.920> I<00:02:22.370> used<00:02:22.519> to<00:02:22.640> modify

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
different amplifiers I used to modify

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.440 
different amplifiers I used to modify
them<00:02:23.420> and<00:02:23.870> that's<00:02:24.409> what<00:02:24.530> kept<00:02:24.769> me<00:02:24.890> you<00:02:25.370> know<00:02:25.519> my

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
them and that's what kept me you know my

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.350 
them and that's what kept me you know my
mind<00:02:26.810> occupied<00:02:27.470> because<00:02:28.040> I<00:02:28.280> like<00:02:29.120> for<00:02:29.269> example

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
mind occupied because I like for example

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.720 
mind occupied because I like for example
Einstein<00:02:30.110> he<00:02:30.409> played<00:02:30.620> the<00:02:30.739> violin<00:02:31.099> you<00:02:31.370> need

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
Einstein he played the violin you need

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.360 
Einstein he played the violin you need
something<00:02:32.150> different<00:02:32.360> to<00:02:32.930> do<00:02:33.170> well

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
something different to do well

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.490 
something different to do well
the<00:02:34.940> creative<00:02:35.569> process<00:02:35.959> in<00:02:36.110> your<00:02:36.230> mind<00:02:36.409> is

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
the creative process in your mind is

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.319 
the creative process in your mind is
happening<00:02:36.980> yeah<00:02:37.220> because<00:02:37.489> that's<00:02:37.700> you<00:02:38.030> used<00:02:38.239> a

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:38.329 
happening yeah because that's you used a

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:40.000 
happening yeah because that's you used a
different<00:02:38.659> part<00:02:38.810> of<00:02:38.900> your<00:02:38.959> brain<00:02:39.200> so<00:02:39.860> that

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
different part of your brain so that

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.300 
different part of your brain so that
actually<00:02:40.519> makes<00:02:41.180> you<00:02:41.390> more<00:02:41.540> creative<00:02:42.310> for

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
actually makes you more creative for

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.869 
actually makes you more creative for
your<00:02:43.459> main<00:02:43.670> job<00:02:44.000> so<00:02:44.720> to<00:02:44.780> speak<00:02:45.110> so<00:02:45.920> I<00:02:46.340> was<00:02:46.849> a

and he said look like electronics you

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:16.720 
and he said look like electronics you
know<00:03:15.109> because<00:03:15.530> I<00:03:15.680> had<00:03:15.829> some<00:03:16.010> problems<00:03:16.400> with<00:03:16.459> my

know because I had some problems with my
equipment<00:03:16.940> always<00:03:17.450> as<00:03:17.930> everybody<00:03:18.500> else<00:03:18.709> I

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
equipment always as everybody else I

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:20.740 
equipment always as everybody else I
said<00:03:19.280> might<00:03:19.609> as<00:03:19.730> well<00:03:19.819> learn<00:03:20.060> about<00:03:20.329> it<00:03:20.540> then<00:03:20.660> I

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
said might as well learn about it then I

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.229 
said might as well learn about it then I
can<00:03:20.930> fix<00:03:21.079> my<00:03:21.290> own<00:03:21.340> so<00:03:22.340> that's<00:03:22.519> how<00:03:22.669> I<00:03:22.700> got<00:03:22.880> into

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
can fix my own so that's how I got into

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:25.059 
can fix my own so that's how I got into
electronics<00:03:24.230> I<00:03:24.319> went<00:03:24.500> to<00:03:24.590> college<00:03:24.799> and

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:25.069 
electronics I went to college and

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:26.680 
electronics I went to college and
learned<00:03:25.280> that<00:03:25.370> and<00:03:26.000> in<00:03:26.209> the<00:03:26.269> meantime<00:03:26.299> I
