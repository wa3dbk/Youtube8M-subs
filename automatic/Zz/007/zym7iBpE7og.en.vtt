a useful garden that I can eat from and

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.749 
a useful garden that I can eat from and
it<00:00:12.059> will<00:00:12.179> probably<00:00:12.509> be<00:00:13.370> same<00:00:14.370> amount<00:00:14.639> of<00:00:14.700> work

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
it will probably be same amount of work

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.820 
it will probably be same amount of work
is<00:00:15.059> taking<00:00:15.269> care<00:00:15.599> of<00:00:15.660> this<00:00:15.780> piece<00:00:16.410> of<00:00:16.590> grass

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
two along the way the 12 foot length for

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.830 
two along the way the 12 foot length for
stability<00:01:05.930> it's<00:01:06.930> going<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.229> get<00:01:07.290> drilled<00:01:07.590> in

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
stability it's going to get drilled in

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.420 
stability it's going to get drilled in
into<00:01:09.840> here<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:10.140> into<00:01:10.320> here<00:01:10.500> for<00:01:11.220> stability

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
into here and into here for stability

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.480 
into here and into here for stability

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.270 
make it pretty solid these Ward's boards
or<00:01:59.850> warped<00:02:00.240> so<00:02:00.600> it<00:02:01.140> didn't<00:02:01.380> fit<00:02:01.560> perfectly<00:02:02.039> as

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
or warped so it didn't fit perfectly as

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.990 
or warped so it didn't fit perfectly as
you<00:02:02.399> can<00:02:02.549> see<00:02:02.820> on<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:03.090> other<00:02:03.210> side<00:02:04.759> but<00:02:05.759> that's
