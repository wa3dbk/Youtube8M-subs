00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 
most likely I'll probably just let it

I used 3/4 inch rebar 36 36 inches in
length<00:00:53.230> and<00:00:53.379> drove<00:00:54.160> it<00:00:54.340> up<00:00:54.430> I<00:00:54.730> drove<00:00:55.719> it<00:00:55.809> into

length and drove it up I drove it into
the<00:00:56.019> ground<00:00:56.289> so<00:00:56.530> that<00:00:56.559> the<00:00:56.710> stake<00:00:57.039> is<00:00:57.250> just

00:00:57.509 --> 00:00:57.519 
the ground so that the stake is just

the ground so that the stake is just
about<00:00:57.760> 14<00:00:58.359> inches<00:00:58.390> above<00:00:58.960> ground<00:00:59.309> from<00:01:00.309> the

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:04.120 
sand now for the pits like I said just

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.390 
sand now for the pits like I said just
to<00:01:04.330> run<00:01:04.540> the<00:01:04.720> mill<00:01:04.870> I<00:01:04.900> use<00:01:05.320> regular<00:01:05.830> treated

three of them and the same goes

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.310 
three of them and the same goes
obviously<00:01:52.090> for<00:01:52.540> the<00:01:52.600> other<00:01:52.720> side<00:01:52.960> pit<00:01:53.500> and

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
obviously for the other side pit and

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.550 
obviously for the other side pit and
what<00:01:56.320> I<00:01:56.350> did<00:01:56.740> was<00:01:57.040> is<00:01:57.370> I<00:01:58.000> nailed<00:01:58.360> the<00:01:59.170> frame

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
what I did was is I nailed the frame

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.020

together first with six inch galvanized
nails

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
nails

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:12.670 
nails
and<00:02:08.410> then<00:02:09.410> what<00:02:09.619> I<00:02:09.649> did<00:02:09.770> was<00:02:10.100> is<00:02:10.429> I<00:02:11.470> I'll<00:02:12.470> get<00:02:12.650> a

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
and then what I did was is I I'll get a

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.890 
and then what I did was is I I'll get a
little<00:02:12.860> closer<00:02:13.100> here<00:02:13.250> I<00:02:13.970> drilled<00:02:14.900> a<00:02:15.080> 3/8<00:02:15.850> hole

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
little closer here I drilled a 3/8 hole

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.950 
little closer here I drilled a 3/8 hole
all<00:02:17.900> the<00:02:17.960> way<00:02:18.410> through<00:02:18.800> and<00:02:19.040> then<00:02:19.940> also<00:02:20.270> used

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:22.960 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.650 

3/8<00:02:24.130> rebar<00:02:25.130> about<00:02:25.430> 18<00:02:25.820> inches<00:02:25.970> length<00:02:26.390> in

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
3/8 rebar about 18 inches length in

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.440 
3/8 rebar about 18 inches length in
length<00:02:27.140> and<00:02:27.380> drove<00:02:28.070> those<00:02:28.340> through<00:02:28.880> so<00:02:29.210> that

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
length and drove those through so that

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.570 
length and drove those through so that
all<00:02:29.930> of<00:02:29.990> each<00:02:30.710> side<00:02:31.100> is<00:02:31.370> anchored<00:02:32.120> by<00:02:32.740> each<00:02:33.740> pit

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
all of each side is anchored by each pit

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.640 
all of each side is anchored by each pit
is<00:02:34.760> anchored<00:02:35.150> by<00:02:35.300> three<00:02:36.340> 18<00:02:37.340> inch<00:02:37.959> 3/8<00:02:38.959> rebar

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
is anchored by three 18 inch 3/8 rebar

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.940 
is anchored by three 18 inch 3/8 rebar
so<00:02:39.920> this<00:02:40.130> isn't<00:02:40.310> going<00:02:40.700> anywhere<00:02:40.970> at<00:02:41.209> all<00:02:41.300> so

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
so this isn't going anywhere at all so

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.500 
so this isn't going anywhere at all so
like<00:02:42.950> I<00:02:43.100> said<00:02:43.160> I<00:02:44.080> don't

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
like I said I don't

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.180 
like I said I don't
this<00:02:47.510> isn't<00:02:47.840> regulation<00:02:48.530> at<00:02:48.709> all<00:02:48.830> it's<00:02:49.130> just
