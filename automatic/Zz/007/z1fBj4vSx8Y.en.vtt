all<00:04:40.710> right<00:04:40.890> so<00:04:41.070> it<00:04:41.220> seems<00:04:41.430> if<00:04:41.580> you<00:04:41.669> do<00:04:41.790> it<00:04:41.910> from

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
all right so it seems if you do it from

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.220 
all right so it seems if you do it from
the<00:04:42.120> top<00:04:42.330> they<00:04:43.280> they<00:04:44.280> die<00:04:44.520> quicker<00:04:45.080> not<00:04:46.080> only

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:46.230 
the top they they die quicker not only

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:47.840 
the top they they die quicker not only
is<00:04:46.440> it<00:04:46.470> easier<00:04:46.890> for<00:04:47.040> me<00:04:47.160> but<00:04:47.310> they<00:04:47.400> also<00:04:47.550> die

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:47.850 
is it easier for me but they also die
