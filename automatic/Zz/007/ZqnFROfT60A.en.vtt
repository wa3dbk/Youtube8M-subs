from many different backgrounds many

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.039 
from many different backgrounds many
different<00:00:40.930> perspectives<00:00:42.239> as<00:00:43.239> an<00:00:43.479> undergrad<00:00:44.019> I

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:44.049 
different perspectives as an undergrad I

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:47.670 
different perspectives as an undergrad I
think<00:00:44.530> I<00:00:44.760> interacted<00:00:45.760> with<00:00:45.820> my<00:00:46.809> TAS<00:00:47.229> which

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:47.680 
think I interacted with my TAS which

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.850 
think I interacted with my TAS which
were<00:00:47.890> grad<00:00:48.519> students<00:00:49.470> because<00:00:50.470> they<00:00:50.619> were<00:00:50.680> in

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:50.860 
were grad students because they were in

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.950 
were grad students because they were in
my<00:00:51.010> classes<00:00:51.549> and<00:00:51.879> college<00:00:52.180> doesn't<00:00:52.659> believe

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:52.960 
my classes and college doesn't believe

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.729 
my classes and college doesn't believe
in<00:00:53.229> a<00:00:53.650> hierarchy<00:00:54.309> of<00:00:54.780> classes<00:00:55.780> it's<00:00:56.559> such<00:00:56.710> a

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:56.739 
in a hierarchy of classes it's such a

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:58.619 
in a hierarchy of classes it's such a
small<00:00:57.159> school<00:00:57.640> that<00:00:57.699> you<00:00:58.089> kind<00:00:58.330> of<00:00:58.420> get<00:00:58.600> to

00:00:58.619 --> 00:00:58.629 
small school that you kind of get to

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:02.340 
small school that you kind of get to
know<00:00:58.750> everybody<00:00:59.530> so<00:01:00.070> you<00:01:00.479> just<00:01:01.479> you<00:01:01.960> start<00:01:02.170> to

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
know everybody so you just you start to

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.940 
know everybody so you just you start to
figure<00:01:02.500> out<00:01:03.720> you<00:01:04.720> know<00:01:04.839> who<00:01:05.170> do<00:01:05.320> should<00:01:05.740> I<00:01:05.770> go

talk<00:01:06.189> to<00:01:06.220> about<00:01:06.780> maybe<00:01:07.780> this<00:01:07.990> idea<00:01:08.350> who<00:01:08.619> has

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:08.710 
talk to about maybe this idea who has

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.190 
talk to about maybe this idea who has
had<00:01:08.860> more<00:01:09.009> experience<00:01:09.609> than<00:01:09.820> me<00:01:10.060> or<00:01:10.329> about<00:01:10.929> a

00:01:43.739 --> 00:01:43.749 
felt like my work was really influenced

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:46.440 
felt like my work was really influenced
by<00:01:43.840> the<00:01:43.899> film<00:01:44.200> classes<00:01:44.740> that<00:01:44.920> I<00:01:44.979> took<00:01:45.130> and<00:01:45.670> the

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
by the film classes that I took and the

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.300 
by the film classes that I took and the
writing<00:01:46.840> creative<00:01:47.350> writing<00:01:47.560> classes<00:01:47.889> that<00:01:48.249> I

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
writing creative writing classes that I

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.090 
writing creative writing classes that I
was<00:01:48.369> taking<00:01:48.969> so<00:01:49.810> that<00:01:50.969> cross-disciplinary

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
was taking so that cross-disciplinary

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.910 
was taking so that cross-disciplinary
interaction<00:01:54.100> I<00:01:54.340> think<00:01:54.579> really<00:01:55.799> supported<00:01:56.799> my

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
interaction I think really supported my

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.020 
interaction I think really supported my
work<00:01:57.130> in<00:01:57.310> a<00:01:57.369> big<00:01:57.579> way

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
work in a big way

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.450 
work in a big way
just<00:01:58.420> the<00:01:58.600> constant<00:01:59.170> performances<00:02:00.100> and

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
just the constant performances and

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.969 
just the constant performances and
lectures<00:02:00.969> and<00:02:01.299> screenings<00:02:01.869> it's<00:02:02.560> awesome

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
lectures and screenings it's awesome

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:05.489 
lectures and screenings it's awesome
well<00:02:03.520> I<00:02:03.609> think<00:02:03.670> they<00:02:03.969> at<00:02:04.329> Keller's<00:02:04.990> they're

00:02:05.489 --> 00:02:05.499 
well I think they at Keller's they're

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:07.949 
well I think they at Keller's they're
constantly<00:02:06.459> asking<00:02:07.030> you<00:02:07.119> to<00:02:07.240> defend<00:02:07.630> yourself

00:02:07.949 --> 00:02:07.959 
constantly asking you to defend yourself

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:10.620 
constantly asking you to defend yourself
no<00:02:08.110> matter<00:02:08.259> what<00:02:08.560> you<00:02:08.740> do<00:02:08.920> and<00:02:09.310> they<00:02:10.270> just<00:02:10.420> want

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
no matter what you do and they just want
