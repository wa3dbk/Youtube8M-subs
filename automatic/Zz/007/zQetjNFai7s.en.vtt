00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 hello my name is noah and today 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.589
 I will show you how not 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.420
 aluminum statuettes in your yard 

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:13.110
 as well as how to make the material 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.020
 needed to first or had to do 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.490
 the foundry 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:22.890
 Here are the objects you will have 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:28.160
 needs below steel in a bucket 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:32.870
 plastic a jump baimout 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:37.130
 dupes the other paris of the seems of 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:39.610
 water a pipe in asia a coupling of 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:45.080
 pvc 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:47.180
 so in pvc balls have also had 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:50.030
 we will need the closet 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:52.460
 I used a fire extinguisher in Asia that 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.010
 I cut in half with a diameter 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:58.880
 about 3 inches and a height of 5 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:01.309
 inches now for the foundry the 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:05.330
 first step would be to mix some 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:08.540
 sober plaster and water in a big 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.490
 containers you have to mix and it 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.979
 make sure there were no more 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:17.990
 lumps quickly when all the 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:20.090
 mixture will harden quickly when you 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:23.509
 are sure that all a liquid 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:27.380
 pour it into the metal penny you 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:30.229
 must also dug a hole in the middle there 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:34.160
 must be bigger than the hollow is 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:36.500
 with at least imposes more the 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.930
 next step would be to make a hole 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:43.460
 inward with a tongue 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:45.620
 about 50 degrees the hole must be 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.400
 big enough for the steel pipe 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:51.920
 could and go without too much trouble 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:54.560
 after that it will be necessary to make the lid 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.510
 must redo the mix sometimes 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.020
 but only with half of the 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.409
 recipe 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:03.650
 the lid must have a hole in 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:04.369
 middle who will be at 0 to spend a 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.899
 duckling 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:11.630
 so I left a can in the middle 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:15.530
 at the moment of colors after having everything 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:18.370
 poured one must put the balls had to 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:22.370
 equal distance from each other 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:25.250
 so about two kaka wrists that 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.360
 handcuffs it will be salty enough to be able to 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.670
 let go long 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.400
 a few hours later when everything 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:34.660
 will completely solidify all 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:37.760
 will remove relatively easily 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.130
 now it's time to melt 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.799
 aluminum 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:45.200
 firstly for it to be hot 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:48.260
 must put coal in the hole of the 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.459
 foundry while leaving enough room 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.200
 for the crisis is 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:55.329
 secondly you have to put the pipes 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.939
 the metal pipe 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:59.459
 you get into the hole in the casting 

00:02:57.939 --> 00:03:03.599
 that we did earlier 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:07.390
 after attaching the one in pvc 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:10.000
 antilles with doctor a dryer at 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.220
 hair all the way along and fall read ming 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.470
 would have minimal power 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.409
 it will give oxygen to the fire for 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.659
 feed it when the coal burns and 

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:21.549
 that the shrimp is placed one can 

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:23.950
 put the lid back on and wait for it 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:25.720
 is warming up the hollow is and at these 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.939
 things both reds 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.519
 at that moment we can put 

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:33.430
 aluminum it could be a good 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:34.030
 idea to start small with costs 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.430
 country 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.290
 any aluminum object combined that 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.780
 it 's paper cans 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.439
 aluminum or any other object made 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.049
 aluminum 

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:46.569
 it does not matter if the object is wise 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:48.819
 painting and the same if a can 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:51.489
 still the liqueurs in when you 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:53.769
 will burn in the fire when you judge 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:55.959
 there have aluminum rather it is a 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:58.150
 good idea to transfer it in a word 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:58.900
 the motion for finally small pieces 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.389
 aluminum 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.879
 this would allow to have line 

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:06.069
 man can still there is excitement 

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:08.349
 is happening in the process 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:10.840
 and all that will stay in the hollow 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:13.870
 after paying the union you can 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.250
 gently hit the crisis is on a 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.440
 hard surface to remove 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:19.329
 acceptance and waste made 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.220
 be careful not to touch emotion 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:24.220
 in the minium because they are extremely 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:27.280
 hot a little piece of paper will last 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:29.560
 instantly to a single contact for the 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.919
 to make a choice their makes the dark in 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.919
 some water 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:39.880
 now for object it is necessary to cut 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:42.789
 sivom camp a figure where a form 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:46.449
 that wanted to reproduce to place the form 

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:50.080
 in sterols in a tray I cover it the 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:53.530
 seems and make sure that there is at least 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:55.300
 one end coming out above it 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.520
 would be important to make a hole in 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:00.280
 the ground to make sure that 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:03.009
 the aluminum gesture in the sand I do not 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:05.680
 did not do them which led to the 

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:08.070
 bin is burning and that the man line has 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:10.690
 fell a little by all that arises 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:13.660
 is that the man line melts the 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:16.030
 syrup forms and takes its place must 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:17.919
 then leave it in the sand to 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:21.550
 a few hours the time that will be 

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:23.199
 chosen then by removing sober one 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:25.570
 found shape in syrup do 

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:27.190
 completely made of aluminum since 

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:29.740
 asbestos is to die for 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:32.340
 the tate there some parts of my 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:36.210
 character do not know what to train 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:36.210
 thank you for listening to me
