00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 greetings to all and welcome to this 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:07.290
 new video in recent days on newsstands 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.960
 a new collection of 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.330
 the collection in question is that 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.250
 of batman cars and therefore 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.400
 having taken the first exit I decided 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.990
 to do a review a little let's say 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.359
 improvised however quick own 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.869
 on the first exit or on this one 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:28.590
 batmobile that the batmobile of the film by 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:31.019
 batman by tim burton from 1989 and then 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.790
 let's see in detail 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.969
 how is this car made but 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.980
 however also all the rest 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.710
 that we can all the rest of that 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.690
 that we find content in this beauty 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.000
 exposure 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.820
 but let's see this in detail 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.550
 automobile starting from its case la 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:54.030
 display case is in transparent plastic and one 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.399
 black plastic base the shape is not 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.760
 that of a true parallelepiped but 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.559
 rather it is trapezoidal in shape 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.949
 in fact the borders between transparent are 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.990
 of the ancient of transparent glass are 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:09.479
 tilted the first thing inside 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.240
 which we note is the background in this 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.100
 3d backdrop that characterizes 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.310
 even more the miniature and recalls 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.799
 a scene just from the tim burton movie 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:23.729
 or when batman enters the 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:25.680
 ischemic we say from there are the 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.170
 origins that is the birth of the joker 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.110
 but let's see the miniature is 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:34.439
 the car in detail and let's start with 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:37.439
 well-sculpted miniature very reminiscent of the 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:40.500
 batman of the tim burton film is 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.299
 the painting while being in spot colors e 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.960
 detailed indeed it seems to me that it 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:48.509
 batman crest on the chest is painted a 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:52.079
 hand the rest of the miniature is 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.670
 really beautiful well carved and the 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.520
 first thing i want to show you are 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.040
 just the wheels that actually do 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.320
 maybe they turn in video do not you 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.780
 will see so well but I assure you that 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.240
 little wheels turn so unscrewing 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.989
 from the base the car can also walk 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:12.180
 for absurd first appreciable thing 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.340
 appreciable factor of the miniature 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.620
 it's 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:19.430
 plastic parts ie rather than 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:22.819
 to build a car entirely in metal 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:25.670
 and then go and paint over the parts 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:27.890
 we say to differentiate it has been decided 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.290
 to use plastic directly 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.840
 colored to differentiate the various 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.690
 components of the car the components that 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.510
 consists precisely in the wheels like 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.700
 we saw then we have these inserts 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.730
 side where you see we say gods 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:46.970
 car component circuits 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.739
 the turbine on the front together 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.470
 to the headlights that we succeed in here 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:53.810
 then we see the glass 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:57.590
 of the passenger compartment made of plastic 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:59.090
 reflective black and finally the tubes of the gods 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.610
 fat shoes those exhaust pipes 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:04.940
 we have the largest of the turbo between 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:07.760
 quotes and other small ones by 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:11.180
 standard along with the headlights so this one 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:13.730
 choice to make the added parts 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.450
 plastic car not to paint them 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.359
 on the metal 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:20.389
 I think it's a perfect choice 

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:24.470
 the car has very fine carvings 

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:26.690
 they are perfect and above all i have 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.480
 appreciated the coloring very much 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.579
 car I don't know if it can be done 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.500
 the car totally in black metal are 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:36.160
 ignorant on the subject however not 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.670
 there are smudges the painting really is 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.310
 perfect 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:42.709
 but let's look at the final part 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:45.590
 of the miniature or its base 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:47.480
 first we see these bins that 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:50.900
 they always remember the setting 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.730
 of the ischemic the painting I would have 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.799
 favorite painting we say with 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.660
 however metallic effect however they are 

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:59.299
 even these made well up in 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:01.669
 plastic and then we move on to 

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:04.819
 paving the flooring that you don't 

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:07.609
 it is engraved but directly painted e 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:11.299
 very well painted it is nuanced 

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:13.970
 of tiled a pavement e 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:16.609
 as you can see it is not a card 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:18.440
 applied is not something added to you 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:20.919
 it is just the painting on the base and it is 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.630
 so really painted here too 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:26.190
 really eaglemoss hat 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:28.380
 who made this miniature 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:31.170
 beautiful is that it cannot miss if 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:33.630
 you are fond of batman well this was 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:36.630
 my review of this first release 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:38.820
 or should you purchase the other s 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.750
 the video convinced you I will also do the 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.370
 other reviews 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.440
 obviously I don't think I'm going to do 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:47.940
 all the collection that is made up of taxes 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:51.120
 don't miss the problem in 60 exits the 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:53.940
 eaglemoss collection then on ebay 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.590
 they are already up to exit 46 maybe 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:58.980
 should you buy any 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:00.330
 sparse output I will always do reviews 

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:02.580
 obviously always if the video is there 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.900
 liked for this video is all one 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:07.220
