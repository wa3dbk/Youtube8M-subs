00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
accounts that increase the security of

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.740 
accounts that increase the security of
this<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.770> stability<00:01:02.340> of<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.579> apps<00:01:02.730> but<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.629> be

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
this the stability of the apps but to be

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.780 
this the stability of the apps but to be
fair<00:01:03.960> it's<00:01:04.470> not<00:01:04.650> it<00:01:05.040> didn't<00:01:05.339> really<00:01:05.460> stop

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
fair it's not it didn't really stop

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.060 
fair it's not it didn't really stop
people<00:01:06.180> getting<00:01:06.510> hacked<00:01:06.720> or<00:01:06.960> anything<00:01:07.320> so<00:01:08.040> I

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
people getting hacked or anything so I

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.500 
people getting hacked or anything so I
think<00:01:08.220> that's<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.580> bit<00:01:08.700> of<00:01:08.790> a<00:01:09.299> reason

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
think that's a bit of a reason

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.780 
think that's a bit of a reason
and<00:01:10.200> I<00:01:10.409> think<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.770> main<00:01:10.950> reason<00:01:11.010> for<00:01:11.400> it<00:01:11.580> going

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
and I think the main reason for it going

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.250 
and I think the main reason for it going
down<00:01:11.970> must<00:01:12.240> have<00:01:12.299> been<00:01:12.510> because<00:01:12.689> of<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.080> coin

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
down must have been because of the coin

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.990 
down must have been because of the coin
sales<00:01:13.470> and<00:01:13.710> I'm<00:01:13.799> sure<00:01:13.950> all<00:01:14.189> of<00:01:14.220> you<00:01:14.460> guys<00:01:14.640> can

most of you guys want one removed as

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.240 
most of you guys want one removed as
well<00:01:42.270> but<00:01:43.110> a<00:01:43.170> big<00:01:43.470> thing<00:01:43.710> about<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:44.040> price

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
well but a big thing about the price

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.819 
well but a big thing about the price
range<00:01:44.549> is<00:01:44.759> his<00:01:45.149> drill<00:01:45.600> down<00:01:45.869> everyone's<00:01:46.530> price

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
range is his drill down everyone's price

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.770 
range is his drill down everyone's price
so<00:01:47.130> much<00:01:47.399> look<00:01:47.610> at<00:01:47.729> messy<00:01:48.060> heat<00:01:48.299> in<00:01:48.450> a<00:01:48.540> minute

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
so much look at messy heat in a minute

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.109 
so much look at messy heat in a minute
he's<00:01:48.899> like<00:01:49.049> 2.6<00:01:50.009> million<00:01:50.220> coins<00:01:50.610> not<00:01:50.909> even

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
he's like 2.6 million coins not even

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.090 
he's like 2.6 million coins not even
being<00:01:51.270> thought<00:01:51.540> so<00:01:52.350> that<00:01:52.470> shows<00:01:52.799> that

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
being thought so that shows that

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.280 
being thought so that shows that
obviously<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.610> price<00:01:53.820> ranges<00:01:54.299> have<00:01:54.780> kind<00:01:55.140> of

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
obviously the price ranges have kind of

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.249 
obviously the price ranges have kind of
made<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.680> play<00:01:55.890> is<00:01:56.130> more<00:01:56.640> able<00:01:57.090> for<00:01:57.630> people<00:01:58.049> to

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
made the play is more able for people to

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.170 
made the play is more able for people to
buy<00:01:58.469> however<00:01:59.070> people<00:01:59.520> aren't<00:01:59.850> going<00:01:59.939> to<00:02:00.000> want

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
buy however people aren't going to want

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.179 
buy however people aren't going to want
to<00:02:00.360> buy<00:02:00.600> because<00:02:01.170> they're<00:02:01.530> not<00:02:01.619> selling<00:02:01.860> and

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
to buy because they're not selling and

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.359 
to buy because they're not selling and
so<00:02:03.140> you<00:02:04.140> could<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.619> reason<00:02:04.920> i<00:02:04.979> could<00:02:05.159> see<00:02:05.280> the

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
so you could the reason i could see the

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:06.830 
so you could the reason i could see the
well<00:02:05.490> up<00:02:05.610> coming<00:02:05.909> back<00:02:05.939> as<00:02:06.210> well<00:02:06.390> is<00:02:06.630> for<00:02:06.780> the

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
well up coming back as well is for the

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.330 
well up coming back as well is for the
fact<00:02:07.020> because<00:02:07.409> these<00:02:07.530> play<00:02:07.740> prices<00:02:08.190> have<00:02:08.310> gone

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
fact because these play prices have gone

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.550 
fact because these play prices have gone
down<00:02:08.489> a<00:02:08.700> lot<00:02:08.819> they've<00:02:09.569> kind<00:02:09.810> of<00:02:09.959> eliminates

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
down a lot they've kind of eliminates

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.300 
down a lot they've kind of eliminates
equine<00:02:10.979> sellers<00:02:11.340> to<00:02:11.550> next

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
equine sellers to next

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.160 
equine sellers to next
this<00:02:13.310> could<00:02:13.580> be<00:02:13.730> a<00:02:13.760> real<00:02:14.090> possibility<00:02:14.480> of<00:02:15.050> the

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
this could be a real possibility of the

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.680 
this could be a real possibility of the
web<00:02:15.349> app<00:02:15.530> coming<00:02:15.769> back<00:02:16.120> however<00:02:17.120> there<00:02:17.569> is

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
web app coming back however there is

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.630 
web app coming back however there is
other<00:02:17.959> ways<00:02:18.319> why<00:02:18.860> I<00:02:18.890> don't<00:02:19.220> think<00:02:19.459> it<00:02:19.549> will

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
other ways why I don't think it will

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.030 
other ways why I don't think it will
come<00:02:19.730> back<00:02:19.940> for<00:02:19.970> example<00:02:20.569> box<00:02:21.530> because

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
come back for example box because

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.470 
come back for example box because
they've<00:02:22.159> obviously<00:02:22.250> got<00:02:22.489> bobs<00:02:22.849> auto<00:02:23.120> buyers

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
they've obviously got bobs auto buyers

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.420 
they've obviously got bobs auto buyers
and<00:02:23.690> I<00:02:23.720> really<00:02:24.200> don't<00:02:24.409> think<00:02:24.500> they'll<00:02:24.890> they'll

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
and I really don't think they'll they'll

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.070 
and I really don't think they'll they'll
bring<00:02:25.549> you<00:02:25.670> back<00:02:25.849> for<00:02:26.209> that<00:02:26.269> reason<00:02:26.629> however

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
bring you back for that reason however

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.809 
bring you back for that reason however

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 
this could be a real strong reason why

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:31.900 
this could be a real strong reason why
they<00:02:28.970> will<00:02:29.120> bring<00:02:29.390> you<00:02:29.510> back<00:02:30.220> so<00:02:31.220> guys<00:02:31.430> here<00:02:31.730> is

down<00:04:12.260> in<00:04:12.319> the<00:04:12.470> comments<00:04:12.709> section<00:04:12.889> what<00:04:13.160> do<00:04:13.340> you

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
down in the comments section what do you

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.099 
down in the comments section what do you
think<00:04:13.669> there<00:04:13.790> is<00:04:13.879> a<00:04:13.910> possibility<00:04:14.389> of<00:04:14.780> the<00:04:14.900> web

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:15.109 
think there is a possibility of the web

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:17.979 
think there is a possibility of the web
app<00:04:15.260> coming<00:04:15.650> back<00:04:16.010> and<00:04:16.479> because<00:04:17.479> I<00:04:17.510> think<00:04:17.870> it

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
app coming back and because I think it

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:19.390 
app coming back and because I think it
could<00:04:18.109> be<00:04:18.199> a<00:04:18.229> real<00:04:18.410> possibility<00:04:18.590> there's

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
could be a real possibility there's

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.789 
could be a real possibility there's
obviously<00:04:19.519> for<00:04:20.239> and<00:04:20.570> against<00:04:21.229> arguments

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
obviously for and against arguments

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:24.100 
obviously for and against arguments
about<00:04:21.919> this<00:04:22.280> but<00:04:23.150> maybe<00:04:23.390> in<00:04:23.599> the<00:04:23.690> future<00:04:23.840> the

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
about this but maybe in the future the

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:25.230 
about this but maybe in the future the
web<00:04:24.260> app<00:04:24.440> will

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240
