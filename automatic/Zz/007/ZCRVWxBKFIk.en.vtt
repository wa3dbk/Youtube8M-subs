00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:20.270
 very good tainted we are now with in 

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:23.180
 this video we are going to show you something that 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.430
 we have loved that it is the game of 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.560
 division that is going to come out good in 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:30.470
 2014 but ubisoft has delayed it to 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.060
 2015 but a safe month but good in 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.040
 this video what they will show in 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:36.770
 different locations of the city of 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:39.770
 new york in which I happen to 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:42.590
 I was on vacation a few weeks ago and 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.090
 how they look in the game and the truth is 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.370
 I'm blown away and I want to share it 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:49.040
 with you the first thing is this part of the 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.830
 bridge manhattan bridge on the right 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.540
 that it is brutal how well recreated it is 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.190
 we will also comment on certain things 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.540
 what the boy says in English in the background and 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.540
 brooklyn bridge here on the left 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.930
 Awesome 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.330
 the feeling of being there brutal could 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.330
 confirm 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.520
 and manhattan bridges and what life is like 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.619
 real 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.420
 is super well done apart from that the 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.710
 game visually let's hope he does not suffer 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.530
 No downgrade of the typical 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:28.439
 lately because it is tremendous how it 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:30.689
 sees the second location is in the 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.549
 central part of manhattan in the 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.210
 subway train station pardon the 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.210
 34th street 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.500
 the effects remember a lot a 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.840
 I 'm very famous 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.850
 graphics even above I believe this 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.680
 it's the real station and like a game 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:51.630
 apocalyptic then clear with consoles 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.630
 destroyed and such but very very similar 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.400
 they give it to you here so we can see 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:59.170
 several zones 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.170
 this that implies real of the game 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.390
 it's awesome how you see these are 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:08.200
 the entrance lathes to the metro and the 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.200
 real image 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.860
 apart from what the city looks like 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.900
 which is the main reason why we wanted 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.570
 show this video how the 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.980
 game is brutal 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:27.130
 The truth is that I was amazed 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:28.870
 with this game this part of the city 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.900
 It is full of very important points 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:35.170
 within the city the first what 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:38.650
 we see the bottom in the east is the empire 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:42.240
 state building and closer you see the 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.240
 part of the madison square garden 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.830
 today we see square garden here opposite and 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.720
 to the left when I left the 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.870
 subway station 34th Street the 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:56.430
 empire state building 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.430
 and this office area 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:04.950
 james foley the post office 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:08.430
 that is the real view is the octave 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:11.819
 avenue on the way to central park el 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.709
 empire state of madison square garden and 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:16.040
 the part again from the beginning of the 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.040
 video 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:22.130
 and we see it in the game now 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.130
 in spirit 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:27.810
 and this the empire state building to the 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:29.990
 right now it will leave the madison square 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.990
 garden 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.769
 and to the right of all areas of 

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:34.769
 mail 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.760
 tremendous 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.230
 They have done a great job and about very 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.560
 very well 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:09.599
 the subway entrance 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.599
 with the lampposts building 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:14.000
 I tell them to see this in the city 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.490
 recently the feeling of 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.680
 see the game 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:19.450
 as close as it is to reality 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:23.020
 the city logically as we say with 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:25.330
 the entire apocalyptic framework but but with 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:28.210
 the main points of the city and 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:31.210
 clearly differentiated is not to that 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:33.760
 school bus the yellow taxi in 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:35.350
 the one that now the soldier goes and he looks 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.970
 the holes of the bullets on the capo 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:38.260
 but it 's the typical new yellow taxi 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:40.580
 york 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:42.919
 tremendous 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.360
 Well nothing if you liked remember 

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:46.639
 subscribe to the channel and we will continue 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.889
 showing things in this game that has 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:50.870
 pleasantly surprised and that we have 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:53.680
 made of the eye very very fast 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.680
 a stale greeting 

00:04:54.409 --> 00:05:00.129
 no thought there because it is available 

00:04:57.379 --> 00:05:00.129
 very well formed
