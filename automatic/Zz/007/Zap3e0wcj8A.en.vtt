00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:39.150
 goats for dairy farming is an excellent alternative to 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.160
 rural properties, especially those near 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.980
 consumers 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.580
 milk for in-natura consumption has a growing market as well as cheeses 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.580
 produced with goat's milk 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.550
 dairy production, however, depends on a series of management techniques 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.450
 from the birth of the goats to the daily care of the goats in 

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:05.680
 lactation 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.680
 that will be presented in this video course 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.270
 we will study the management in the breeding phases 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:15.000
 and goats in production 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.600
 hygienic milking techniques and how to do the 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.600
 herd management 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.190
 In our study we will use as an example management used in the field and the 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.190
 blood one of the best known in the country 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.840
 located in the farm santa rita in the municipality of forest to 70 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.370
 kilometers of beautiful horizon this breeding ground has reached high rates 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.370
 productivity 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.330
 are 100 lactating goats 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.710
 with average production I saw three point six kilos per day 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.750
 which means more than 9 thousand liters of milk per month 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.340
 the herd still counts on average with 40 kids in suckling 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.159
 eighty goats in re-creation and six pots 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:15.209
 who he has managed since 1997, until the technical coordinator 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:20.189
 In this short video the veterinarian Maria Maria Pia Souza Lima Mattos 

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:24.089

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:29.059
 rights with specialization in dairy products in Switzerland and director of 

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:33.519
 arch technique preventive measure that is the mining association of breeders 

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:39.369
 it is very easy to create goats as long as you respect the quotas you need to 

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:40.299
 be normal 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:44.609
 with for example giving you conditions to receive the shares of 

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:45.589
 way 

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:48.819
 that of quality food and quantity 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:51.819
 the animal presents all its potentialities 

00:02:52.499 --> 00:02:55.499
 he is an extremely docile animal that accepts very well 

00:02:56.029 --> 00:03:00.799
 the soul is nexus and it is extremely pleasant to work with these animals not 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:17.099
 the breeding phase corresponds to the period between the birth of the shelter weaning 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:20.359
 food at around 60 days of age 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:25.379
 in these first two months of life should be considered as the basis for the 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:28.909
 development and future performance of shelter animals. 

00:03:30.179 --> 00:03:35.719
 children have different destinations from this stage almost all 

00:03:35.719 --> 00:03:38.389
 be discarded as soon as possible 

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:43.369
 understood or transferred to a fattening sector in the property, aiming at the 

00:03:43.369 --> 00:03:45.759
 part 

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:50.119
 in those who are the best goalkeeper's kids with the best goats can 

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:53.119
 be created to become future breeding
