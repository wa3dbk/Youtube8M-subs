00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:01.229
 is to put you 

00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:04.669
 and friends of txistu this time I come bringing a new tunnel to decide 

00:00:04.669 --> 00:00:07.390
 called h you control plus 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:10.910
 this applies only that you do and slow that is a volume button love here 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:13.569
 it does not look like a window 

00:00:13.569 --> 00:00:16.320
 where the information appears 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.320
 the data of the year instead of even what we are reproducing 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.099
 in Minnesota they excel names nor have we taken to expose but I had 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:25.150
 configured like this 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.269
 in such a way that he has to look for it from the network was generally 

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:30.429
 by putting that 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:34.800
 and add presumed and new nothing seems to you as a cousin in changes 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.120
 remember that if you leave the first time you have decided it does not seem 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:41.660
 hence to recharge the data so that the couple in a few clicks 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.340
 then it is not going to generate any cousin nicómedes what you have to do 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:46.860
 and it's fair 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.800
 and then look for the new new adjustment that gives a range of control 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.410
 select death and here in the parameters 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.070
 we're going to military the one that says nobody 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:58.100
 and here 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.890
 this one that says the text deactivate the property means that I do not go 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.010
 it was this that is here 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.580
 without another the active master 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.720
 it automatically turns off 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.840
 so that this mode activate it 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.110
 there are those who say title conquered a title 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.460
 percent referring to the information that appears in the hv 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.040
 here he appears round and exposes acts that dislocate and that he wants 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.880
 and who says title as you can divide several so have 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.530
 understood that red 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.820
 the blue the green black be popular bank and elda 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.990
 who says its title in the part below in case of appearing with her 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.850
 the same area of ​​color and the name who disseminated xixón actis travelers 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:43.610
 is what we give reproducing the song or what I love 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.780
 stopped and that it towed the one that was sounding for example 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.470
 I'm not going to enable 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.190
 and I have to leave disables custom party because the application does not 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.640
 you do not work all at once 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.300
 so if I go to my iphoto 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:58.570
 and now product 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.400
 the evil I get the first that I get 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.110
 this song 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:04.950
 for these reasons astiz 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:13.299
 66 apparently anarchists light turn 3 then houses 

00:02:18.139 --> 00:02:19.629
 place 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:21.689
 the flight as he said you can 

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:25.979
 penélope established hamilton that this occasion was not only with the 

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:28.919
 subtitle and he 

00:02:28.919 --> 00:02:31.559
 by the way to who says extra 

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:33.069
 we have the following 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:36.249
 where he says he had hb who he is and what he's going to enable 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:40.840
 wolf take possible positive as is volume to be able to lower the brightness 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.519
 for example active 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:45.789
 I rise under the brightness his eye april 

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:48.789
 it's like I say it seems the time is up 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:52.639
 in data 

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:55.559
 the hour would appear and he killed him 

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:59.689
 while kinfolk with weedy side denied that this 15 goals to escape 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:05.779
 let's see what bad after and the application as nothing the application 

00:03:05.779 --> 00:03:09.599
 it is very good to use anytime any doubt any problem something 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:11.339
 inconvenient what I missed 

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:12.859
 - Question 

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:15.389
