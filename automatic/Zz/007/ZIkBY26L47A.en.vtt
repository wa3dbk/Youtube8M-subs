00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:04.470
 no 

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:09.150
 years 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.610
 she does not throw her stump you 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:17.260
 know that today we can ride with 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:22.779
 to ride with a core 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:23.890
 are you sure yes yes hello hello 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:25.599
 call because he bet we can 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:29.560
 to roll with a core of apple is 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:30.910
 true or the art or there or there or there wait 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.060
 wait I do not understand everything I come 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.060
 see you 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.190
 Well, here I come to 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.660
 morsbach in moselle on the site of meta 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.950
 vallorbe and worth it is a site 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.730
 pioneer in France in terms of 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.050
 methanation 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:51.300
 we'll see how it goes here there 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.010
 receives household waste up to 45 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.800
 thousand tons a year it comes out believe 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.940
 the fuel or not when he has a life 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.920
 if the waste is sorted 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.600
 we keep only biowaste it's up to 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.290
 say animal waste or 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.640
 vegetable 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.710
 it's our waste we'll do it 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.540
 to go into a digester it goes for 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.520
 start two does not learn excellent post 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.520
 and that could be transformed into 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.680
 fertilizer but the process of vibrations 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.880
 also produced biogas it's called 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.320
 burgalat because it is original 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.130
 biological 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.710
 gas ie in itself source of energy 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.750
 the singularity here of this site it was 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.790
 to make an environmental profit 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.710
 maximum amount of biogas produced in 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.950
 digesters see themselves we're doing here 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:41.160
 electricity from heat and 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:42.830
 biomethane metal of co2 and its 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.180
 hydrogen sulphide 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.490
 if we summarize thanks to montereau new hope 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.520
 get electricity from the heat 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.350
 and biomethane that's the triple 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.880
 valorization 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:58.110
 not bad for a core of a good me this 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.670
 what I would like to know is how 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.080
 the guy is coming out of this factory to get 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.470
 find in my gas stove in my 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.030
 cooked 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.680
 so to continue my investigation I 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.940
 go with alexis 2 l engineer 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.470
 GrDF 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.850
 the biomethane arrives at the station at 8 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.380
 years already and mashed then the 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.060
 grdf's responsibility is to 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.620
 to authorize it, that is, to give it the 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.130
 same characteristic smell of gas 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.870
 natural 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.340
 then we will lower his pressure to 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.660
 able to allow injection into the 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.590
 network 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.820
 when it is consistent we inject into 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.299
 the network where it mixes with the gas 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.830
 natural 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:24.810
 we can find it in the 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.209
 but also at the station of 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.900
 gas fuel so that's where 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.340
 my apple core 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.780
 after being transformed into 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.310
 biomethane makes it possible to roll all 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.170
 types of vehicles from vehicles of 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.540
 collecting buses I think that enough 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.769
 incredible the site of meta value is 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.019
 today the only one in France to produce 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:42.630
 bio methane and biofuel and 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:43.320
 have integrated an injection station this 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.209
 is just the beginning 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.190
 this site will partly serve as a model to 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.060
 nearly 400 other biomethane projects 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.370
 led by sheikh 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.989
 especially territory and it does not stop 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.250
 there that the biofuel is also 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.209
 developed in several european countries 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.980
 and even beyond 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:03:02.250
 it seems to say that our not too much 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:03.840
 but a long life before him so you 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.519
 was right it's amazing what we 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.790
 can do with a core of apple must 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.790
 that I tell
