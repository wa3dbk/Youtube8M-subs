00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:09.929
 welcome to my red kitchen 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.830
 I'm the sonja and the next three 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:16.230
 Weeks I want you an Asian 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:18.960
 3-course-menu pre-cooking we give 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.730
 start with a portion of coconut soup there 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.090
 then come shrimp pure 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:27.500
 the main course is a lot of vegetables and 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:32.180
 pork fillet prepared in wok and 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:35.700
 then complete that very fine 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.770
 Lemongrass creme brulee and now 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.469
 we come with the search and here 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.510
 is very simple 

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:47.489
 and for that we need the shrimp 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:51.829
 cash registers and of course the shrimp then 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:59.149
 you also need lemongrass ginger 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:01:03.120
 spring onions, fish sauce chili 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:06.290
 fresh coriander part basil and 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:11.490
 limes and then you still need 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:14.430
 coconut milk and water now I am and 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:18.750
 first the oil is heated and then become 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:21.689
 the shrimp carcasses seared with 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.630
 water, I then delete the whole 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:28.710
 After the carcasses well fried 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:32.400
 are of lemongrass due the hard 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:35.000
 leaves and then I cut that in 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:39.650
 fine slices 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:43.940
 the always slippery and schelin off and on 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:47.990
 then the finely diced chili 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:50.890
 and pithy that is spectator and then 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:53.690
 really the fine 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:56.660
 I cut the spring onions 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.130
 also in thin rings and then I come 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.530
 to my herbs 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:04.400
 then the coriander and the thai 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:06.950
 basil chopped afterwards I give 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:11.450
 my shrimp tills by one 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:15.260
 screenprint this and then comes the 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:18.950
 Coconut milk and the lemon grass of the 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:21.070
 the island and the chilli and that leave 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:24.470
 I then simmer for ten minutes 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:27.200
 then I give my fish to the rose and 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:31.040
 it becomes the mown juice 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:33.800
 slimmed down my shrimp then come in 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:38.140

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:41.739
 everything in three minutes briefly pull 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:43.900
 to taste the hot soup again and 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:46.040
 afterwards with the cut 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:49.070
 spring onions and the chopped 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:52.780

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:52.780
