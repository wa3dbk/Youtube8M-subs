00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 more things in the Russian fifth fighter 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.520
 generation in the t-50 soon very soon 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.710
 is going to start and perform the tests 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.450
 of this at the end of missiles is what it 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.730
 announced at the aerospace salon maks 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.530
 2013 that is celebrated in the outskirts of 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.230
 Moscow there are presented the latest 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.150
 innovations from around the world in this 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.189
 sector and alexandra bondarenko visited 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.170
 precisely this event to find out 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:26.420
 what opportunities does the latter offer 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.420
 achievement of the Russian aeronautical industry 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.790
 the supersonic secret with greater 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.290
 flight autonomy on this occasion is not 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.500
 it's about a plane from a movie of 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:40.660
 fiction but of the t 50 also known 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.820
 as a pack for the first fifth plane 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.739
 manufactured generation of russia that has 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.350
 become one of the most projects 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:49.840
 attractions in aerospace salon maks 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.879
 2013 serge bogrÃ¡n is the pilot who 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:55.780
 made the first flight of tests in 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:57.190
 the 2009 according to this the plane 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.170
 it is composed in a different way 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.030
 satisfies all the requirements of a 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.979
 fifth generation aircraft has a 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.570
 great maneuverability but from the 

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:06.130
 piloting point of view can be 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.770
 highlight the new design a great 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.870
 surface of wings minimum turning radius 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.030
 and the vector push and the more 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:15.340
 powerful all this allows you to be more 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.110
 maneuverable most of its 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.030
 features still remains in 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.409
 secret but it is known that in comparison 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.510
 with the combat aircraft of 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:24.430
 previous generations the new pack 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.920
 ffaa has a series of capabilities 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.799
 unique combat including functions 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:32.020
 of a multi-purpose aircraft design 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:34.260
 multipurpose used for hunting attack and 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.790
 defense among many others 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.620
 the fifth generation airplane of 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.320
 Russian manufacture according to the forecasts 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.750
 to advance those analogs 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.640
 but it 's super nice you can love the 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.280
 supersonic speed that is around 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.080
 of 2500 kilometers per hour is also 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.690
 endowed with an advanced intelligence 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.860
 artificial and is also made of 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.040
 material that makes it practically 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:57.110
 invisible to the radars the cabin made 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.360
 in a very simple way is something that 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.100
 it seems attractive for pilots has 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.590
 a seat digital control system 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.930
 multifunction displays but the most 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.369
 shocking is that its design implies that 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.500
 a part of the information could 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:11.570
 appear on the glass of the helmet 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.190
 pilot what is a product 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.800
 completely in play has no analogues 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.209
 and in those enigmas of aerodynamics but 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.760
 the tests continue according to what 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:21.680
 planned join more machines the plane 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.750
 advanced during the tests I hope that in 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.030
 future we can see the planes that are 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.739
 will manufacture in series the cost of this 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.330
 ship produced by the Russian company 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:31.519
 Sukhoi is estimated at 100 million 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.530
 dollars even though the plane is 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:35.630
 in a testing stage it is expected that 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.810
 it is incorporated into the air force of the 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:42.860
 country in 2016 replacing in the arsenal 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:44.720
 to the 1,029 and the sub 27 already so much is 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.860
 how to change a mercedes for one for a 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.680
 ferrari 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.240
 feels that it is easily handled if 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.190
 you need to get used to it a bit but the 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:56.240
 pilot who is driving in his 27 or 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:58.010
 130 can easily handle the t-50 without 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.080
 But the pilots say that for now 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.180
 there are points that they have to pay 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.490
 attention the engineers so that 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.380
 become a perfect plane and I thought 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:08.240
 that for this machine there is still a 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:11.000
 way to go according to what the 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:13.280
 experts the t-50 could become 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.480
 a unique copy to shake the 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.480
 skies of the whole world
