00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.170
 on the first floor 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:11.220
 if it's needed I just took 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.360
 a wind from another world 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.070

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.220
 so exploded to laugh I put my 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:20.190
 hand for typing at titoff and people 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:28.140
 3d model this great moment of loneliness 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:31.590
 I came I felt how the 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.880
 loneliness and then it's simply 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.200
 an ad in a newspaper that 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.700

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:03.810
