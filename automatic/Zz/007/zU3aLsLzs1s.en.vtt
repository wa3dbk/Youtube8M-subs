00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:06.930
 that you have but me it quietly 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.980
 so here I am sorry because you 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.059
 go hear the voice I was with a 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.490
 cousin in the party you go 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.110
 hear his voice do the trick a little 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.049
 little breaks at once I do not know 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.850
 how can we remove remove this 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.859
 bullshit belongs to from the 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.300
 xbox I do not know how we do 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.970
 personally if you have a small 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.900
 idea of ​​how we do to remove the 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.949
 voice I do not know if it's with the 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.060
 cakes with the dio exit 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:31.050
 frankly no idea in any case you 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.570
 normally you will not hear it 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.280
 super strong and I did it here is a small 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.290
 part or I chained 23 pilots 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.390
 in a row because hey it's true he 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.309
 There is material to perigueux the branches 98 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.719
 that he's beating I'm going to explain 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.059
 directly already good there are some there 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.530
 have seen a bar of 10 sizes so 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.430
 the more than 110 that there have been 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.460
 negative comments 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.870
 so good I will not go further 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.059
 in his passion steps it's 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.920
 little childishness that a person 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.170
 continues to hurt with my mcdo video 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.020
 be out more than a week ago 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.190
 short we walk commentary 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.260
 negative years because for a fee 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.650
 some have chosen a craft against 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.780
 trays 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.250
 it's easy and weird that I 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.310
 answer try to do more is to 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.470
 do better bae not answer or he 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.520
 gets angry on one of the guys and especially 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.290
 that in the middle part to some 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.820
 who usually talk about record but I 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.520
 never talked about record I never 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.659
 me humor records for sure they 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.640
 are movies in their head because 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.170
 good Connesson me on the desk is to 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.790
 all on the other hand when I'm silent 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.840
 dead because these were real games 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.540
 I was doing real game of 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.950
 naggers you see and there not at all 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.060
 world when there will be at least five six 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.670
 people who will do with me on 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.689
 youtube which eighth in this case 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.640
 there the video is shit 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.409
 finally short we on titeuf we know 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.729
 not too much what you want to see what 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.720
 clearly I have already answered several 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.030
 times in the comments if I had to 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.590
 play 4 5 hours at play this is it 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.820
 still a lot of gameplay on me 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.140
 will say it's not death 23 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.720
 pilots to do it's still not 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.340
 wrong on this map the age of even not bad 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.860
 to chain a cottage was beating all 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.689
 it's nice and so I do not know what 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.360
 wanted to see arise and eat another one 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.740
 or parties together lyonnaise where 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.490
 I left my drivers in auto mode 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.770
 and I smash the boots 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.939
 just alarm g not chained a lot of 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.130
 pilots and I died six times they 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:11.230
 are there it's the same let loose marc once 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.819
 the end here tell me what you 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.810
 want to see on crazy titanium after I 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.069
 know that there are some who use it 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.660
 not the xbox necessarily they do not have the 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:18.130
 game so I do not think that's them 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.260
 interested apart from watching a video of 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.290
 from time to time so that I wanted to know 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:28.150
 what you think of it 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:29.800
 after another shameful thing playing there 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.720
 I'm going to talk to you about dates and the 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.430
 done because I made myself inevitably 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.530
 little words my technical words for 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:39.190
 nothing obliges a comment it's me 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.870
 I like commented here is the horse has 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.760
 already against fashion on youtube in this 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:46.720
 moment and but that there are some tears 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:48.519
 and frankly but it's rather the 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.769
 kids who says yeah they serve to 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:52.989
 something to revitalize youtube and 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:54.370
 you make it the base of my chair I 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:56.110
 think what I am from the beginning 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.390
 will be understood is to make 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.549
 carnage that's the biggest score 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.590
 possible on the fps the facts what me 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:04.090
 place here it's battlefield I had 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.130
 do a lot of good to the same two 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:09.459
 I had made the country code 1 cat 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.840
 short all the call of etc and loved they 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:12.190
 are beginners on the game who are 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.630
 moderately good even they are good 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.980
 because the wall am not throwing me 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.019
 flowers but I still made some 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.400
 big fat parties and a guard my 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:19.750
 videos trying to understand my 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.769
 trips to take the same strengths 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.450
 that me the same weapons same 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:24.280
 accessories to make you fat 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.410
 parties so that's what I'm used to 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.209
 youtube is to progress 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.370
 some people who watch 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:31.870
 videos and some tender 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.150
 people if it's like my montages bf 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.829
 4 there are a lot of people 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.280
 I thank you on all 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:40.569
 my videos there are a lot of people who 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.930
 I have a lot of positive comments 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:45.790
 it makes me super happy and here it is 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.109
 as of 24 this is true that the 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.280
 little world the last montage that I have 

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:52.270
 here I am the clips were not 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:54.310
 official but that's the goal the goal of 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:56.800
 editing is not to have the most 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.510
 big clip to the world to pass 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.330
 spend a good video relaxing etc at 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:03.100
 look at it and then that's because I know 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.240
 than thion guys who thought f4 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.190
 here they are going to get some poodle stuff 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:07.150
 like to sniper or believe but I have 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.130
 not the level is often on 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.620
 battlefield 4 that's what happens 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.760
 that's usually the guys gets full 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.290
 of clips of many people 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.090
 different because inevitably left 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:17.739
 clips of egg and makes a montage of 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.049
 that and appreciated by the community 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:22.030
 because here it is the thing of whew that 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:24.910
 I could never do it apart if 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:26.560
 I love the tierra rpg the cross 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.420
 the map has smashed icons and I think 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.220
 I do not think so but you will see that the 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:31.390
 next montage bf he'll be great 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.280
 well if the guys who tell me that they 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:35.950
 do that to all parties went there 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.030
 read is still waiting there the next 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:38.470
 state I can tell you that guys 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:41.800
 it's heavy in need and with whom it 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:43.890
 in mass and then here is the new 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:47.320
 if I had thought about battlefield it was 

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:48.550
 for those who finally know it's this 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:52.090
 they just play to answer me 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:54.700
 obviously it's in conquest launched a 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:56.890
 live solo from a to z so not a part 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:59.800
 still obviously where I try to do 

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:00.250
 ten thousand more than 10000 points at the end 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.900
 Of the game 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:02.950
 finally just in the scoreboard of the end 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.200
 of the game because after with all 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:07.300
 ribbons and that is more than 10000 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:09.100
 obviously going to make more than ten thousand in 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.780
 live like that to the whole party so 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:12.370
 it can last fifteen minutes easily 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.540
 the conquest parties where I will try 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:17.860
 to play alarm maybe go up in 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:19.930
 the helicopters and that's finally and that's it 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.340
 the goal is going to be more than 10,000 on 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:22.990
 happens like that in solo conquest 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.750
 after I can not necessarily win all 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:28.030
 the sheaths because here it is of 30 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:30.640
 account 30 points continuous set of 32 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:31.840
 against we do not see here if you play with 

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:34.450
 thirty guys who did not play 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:37.840
 the goal savage had won the game 

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:39.880
 and then here you have to put 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:41.470
 that in the east as if it tempts you 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:44.540
 after I still have a lot of small 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:46.550
 game I have not forgotten my series 1 ag 

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:48.680
 next who will arrive is the mp set 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:51.110
 and I thank the two subscribers who 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:53.300
 lack that actually let me know that 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:57.860
 in battlefield 4 on the menu you go 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:59.060
 in my soldier decoration premium and there 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:59.390
 you have all the challenges of all 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:01.340
 arms 

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:02.450
 finally I'm doing like an idiot I'm going 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:04.550
 thank you in passing and look at this 

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:05.840
 video because saw that battlefield that 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:07.580
 the interest since you're mad at 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.870
 my opinion I do not know if looking 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.850
 this video but now they have me 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:12.050
 explained that and so we can see on a 

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:13.160
 check because to lead different challenges to 

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:14.750
 realize but hey I think that's 

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.040
 easier to make a video you 

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:18.500
 explains the little at the same time with 

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:19.700
 pretty clip so mp7 and after I 

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:21.770
 some ogle magnum clips and 

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:24.260
 honestly it's already very much 

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:25.880
 not exceptional on call of duty but 

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.720
 it's a battlefield 4 boulevard rentrée 

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:29.120
 little things but it's not 

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:31.250
 officially taken and so here are the 

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.180
 guys I think you're aiming at the ball 

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:36.380
 until the vote 

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:37.790
 I did not forget to 

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:39.200
 comment on one to say what you in 

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:41.110
 think about the different topics that 

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:43.730
 I discussed during this video 

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:46.340
 these global doctors and so that finally 

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:47.510
 short and so on titan a crowd 

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:49.100
 so here I do not know what to do in 

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:51.950
 frankly I have not really hooked 

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:53.690
 a thing that pisses me off is the 

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:55.070
 votes the base of a fps it's down 

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:56.900
 against players with brains in 

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:59.710
 face and not I want against the bots 

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:01.640
 unfortunately the world what do you want 

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:02.990
 they did play like that and then 

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:03.620
 in any case, that's not missing 

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:05.390
 dynamism 

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:08.090
 we will see the positive side of things 

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:11.210
 so here is legally if you liked it 

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:12.890
 where is the video and we find ourselves 

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:16.300
 very soon for a new video 

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:16.300
 I have a good evening good day
