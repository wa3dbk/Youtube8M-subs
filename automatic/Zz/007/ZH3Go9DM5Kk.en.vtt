00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
looking at the beijing profile the

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.330 
looking at the beijing profile the
actual<00:02:28.960> amount<00:02:29.170> of<00:02:29.260> climbing<00:02:29.860> in<00:02:29.950> the<00:02:30.070> course

actual amount of climbing in the course
I<00:02:30.520> knew<00:02:30.640> Kristin<00:02:31.060> would<00:02:31.210> be<00:02:31.360> shifting<00:02:31.810> quite<00:02:32.050> a

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
I knew Kristin would be shifting quite a

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.630 
I knew Kristin would be shifting quite a
bit<00:02:32.260> from<00:02:32.410> her<00:02:32.620> big<00:02:32.830> chain<00:02:33.070> ring<00:02:33.250> in<00:02:33.340> the<00:02:33.400> front

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
bit from her big chain ring in the front

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.400 
bit from her big chain ring in the front
to<00:02:33.760> the<00:02:33.790> small<00:02:34.060> chain<00:02:34.330> ring<00:02:34.510> and<00:02:34.690> that's<00:02:35.170> where

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
to the small chain ring and that's where

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.200 
to the small chain ring and that's where
the<00:02:35.620> opportunity<00:02:36.100> to<00:02:36.160> drop<00:02:36.340> change<00:02:36.640> comes<00:02:37.030> in

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210 
the opportunity to drop change comes in

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:38.880 
the opportunity to drop change comes in
that's<00:02:37.420> why<00:02:37.600> the<00:02:37.660> product<00:02:38.290> came<00:02:38.470> out<00:02:38.620> is

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
that's why the product came out is

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.420 
that's why the product came out is
because<00:02:39.070> for<00:02:39.940> some<00:02:40.120> reason<00:02:40.980> I<00:02:41.980> know<00:02:42.220> we<00:02:42.400> all
