00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
out on that there as well I think the

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.340

vignette is the vintage scale which just

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.199

infused this wall again with more charm

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:21.990 
infused this wall again with more charm
I<00:02:19.480> felt<00:02:20.140> like<00:02:20.350> oh<00:02:20.560> I'm<00:02:20.800> in<00:02:20.830> an<00:02:21.069> old<00:02:21.280> grocery

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
I felt like oh I'm in an old grocery

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.360 
I felt like oh I'm in an old grocery
store<00:02:22.540> and<00:02:22.840> I<00:02:23.350> think<00:02:23.590> those<00:02:23.799> kinds<00:02:24.160> of<00:02:24.220> moments

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
store and I think those kinds of moments

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.550 
store and I think those kinds of moments
that<00:02:24.670> evoke<00:02:24.970> a<00:02:25.000> feeling<00:02:25.120> or<00:02:25.600> an<00:02:25.660> emotion<00:02:25.750> those

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
that evoke a feeling or an emotion those

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.830 
that evoke a feeling or an emotion those
go<00:02:26.709> a<00:02:26.739> long<00:02:27.040> way<00:02:27.310> and<00:02:27.670> are<00:02:28.000> really<00:02:28.299> big<00:02:28.450> part<00:02:28.720> of

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
go a long way and are really big part of

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.090 
go a long way and are really big part of
decorating<00:02:30.690> so<00:02:31.690> for<00:02:31.959> a<00:02:31.989> completely<00:02:32.530> different

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
decorating so for a completely different

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.710 
decorating so for a completely different
feel<00:02:33.280> and<00:02:33.459> high<00:02:33.640> contrast<00:02:34.000> feel<00:02:34.450> to<00:02:34.570> that

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
feel and high contrast feel to that

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.140 
feel and high contrast feel to that
white<00:02:34.930> wall<00:02:35.140> Stefan's<00:02:36.010> also<00:02:36.340> created<00:02:36.670> a<00:02:36.790> black

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
white wall Stefan's also created a black

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.580 
white wall Stefan's also created a black
section<00:02:37.570> of<00:02:37.690> the<00:02:37.780> kitchen<00:02:37.930> where

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
section of the kitchen where

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.020 
section of the kitchen where
everything's<00:02:39.070> been<00:02:39.220> painted<00:02:39.519> black<00:02:39.730> and

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
everything's been painted black and

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.720 
everything's been painted black and
what's<00:02:40.510> cool<00:02:40.780> about<00:02:40.840> this<00:02:41.200> is<00:02:41.440> that<00:02:41.829> the<00:02:42.190> ovens

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
what's cool about this is that the ovens

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.550 
what's cool about this is that the ovens
and<00:02:43.120> the<00:02:43.329> stove<00:02:43.570> have<00:02:43.780> actually<00:02:44.079> been<00:02:44.170> hidden

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
and the stove have actually been hidden

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.199 
and the stove have actually been hidden
within<00:02:44.769> the<00:02:44.980> cabinetry<00:02:45.430> which<00:02:45.579> is<00:02:45.700> black<00:02:45.910> I

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
within the cabinetry which is black I

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:48.300 
within the cabinetry which is black I
think<00:02:46.720> a<00:02:46.810> lot<00:02:46.959> of<00:02:46.989> people<00:02:47.350> like<00:02:48.010> to<00:02:48.040> really

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
think a lot of people like to really

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:49.860 
think a lot of people like to really
highlight<00:02:48.730> the<00:02:48.760> stove<00:02:49.120> as<00:02:49.329> the<00:02:49.450> hub<00:02:49.630> of<00:02:49.660> the

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
highlight the stove as the hub of the

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.330 
highlight the stove as the hub of the
kitchen<00:02:50.200> but<00:02:50.380> he's<00:02:50.650> done<00:02:50.829> a<00:02:50.859> completely

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
kitchen but he's done a completely

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:52.949 
kitchen but he's done a completely
different<00:02:51.640> kind<00:02:51.790> of<00:02:51.850> take<00:02:52.030> by<00:02:52.209> blending<00:02:52.840> it

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
different kind of take by blending it

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:55.440 
different kind of take by blending it
out<00:02:53.049> even<00:02:53.980> the<00:02:54.070> backsplash<00:02:54.459> is<00:02:54.700> black<00:02:54.940> it's

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
out even the backsplash is black it's

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:56.849 
out even the backsplash is black it's
like<00:02:55.630> a<00:02:55.660> brick<00:02:55.930> work<00:02:56.170> that's<00:02:56.440> been<00:02:56.530> painted

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:56.859 
like a brick work that's been painted

00:02:56.859 --> 00:02:57.309 
like a brick work that's been painted
black

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:57.319 
black

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:00.160 
black
and<00:02:57.409> even<00:02:58.219> his<00:02:58.310> utensils<00:02:58.909> or<00:02:59.090> black<00:02:59.269> it's

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
and even his utensils or black it's

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.229 
and even his utensils or black it's
again<00:03:00.469> this<00:03:00.620> great<00:03:00.950> high<00:03:01.159> contrast<00:03:01.760> tension

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
again this great high contrast tension

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:03.970 
again this great high contrast tension
that's<00:03:02.389> created<00:03:02.810> between<00:03:02.989> the<00:03:03.230> two<00:03:03.409> sides<00:03:03.680> of

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
that's created between the two sides of

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.209 
that's created between the two sides of
the<00:03:04.189> room<00:03:05.319> what's<00:03:06.319> really<00:03:06.650> interesting<00:03:06.889> about

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:07.219 
the room what's really interesting about

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:10.089 
the room what's really interesting about
this<00:03:07.430> kitchen<00:03:07.700> is<00:03:08.060> that<00:03:08.120> it<00:03:08.930> is<00:03:09.260> basically<00:03:09.769> a

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:10.099 
this kitchen is that it is basically a

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:11.709 
this kitchen is that it is basically a
black<00:03:10.340> and<00:03:10.549> white<00:03:10.609> kitchen<00:03:10.999> which<00:03:11.209> is<00:03:11.420> a<00:03:11.450> look

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:11.719 
black and white kitchen which is a look

00:03:11.719 --> 00:03:13.209 
black and white kitchen which is a look
that<00:03:11.930> we've<00:03:12.049> been<00:03:12.170> seeing<00:03:12.439> in<00:03:12.709> kitchens<00:03:13.099> for

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:13.219 
that we've been seeing in kitchens for

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:16.449 
that we've been seeing in kitchens for
decades<00:03:13.670> it's<00:03:14.090> a<00:03:14.269> classic<00:03:14.810> but<00:03:15.379> Stefan's<00:03:16.159> put

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
decades it's a classic but Stefan's put

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:18.339 
decades it's a classic but Stefan's put
his<00:03:16.579> own<00:03:16.790> unique<00:03:17.180> spin<00:03:17.450> on<00:03:17.510> it<00:03:17.750> and<00:03:17.780> it<00:03:18.079> feels

00:03:18.339 --> 00:03:18.349 
his own unique spin on it and it feels

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:22.509 
his own unique spin on it and it feels
very<00:03:19.250> artistic<00:03:20.200> slightly<00:03:21.200> stylized<00:03:21.799> and<00:03:22.189> kind

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 
very artistic slightly stylized and kind

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:24.729 
very artistic slightly stylized and kind
of<00:03:22.609> surreal<00:03:23.000> to<00:03:23.030> me<00:03:23.239> lots<00:03:24.049> of<00:03:24.230> layers<00:03:24.530> of

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
of surreal to me lots of layers of

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:27.099 
of surreal to me lots of layers of
textures<00:03:25.219> and<00:03:25.250> shapes<00:03:25.969> and<00:03:26.239> forms<00:03:26.719> and<00:03:27.019> how

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:27.109 
textures and shapes and forms and how

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:29.709 
textures and shapes and forms and how
they<00:03:27.260> interplay<00:03:27.650> together<00:03:28.040> and<00:03:28.400> a<00:03:28.719> complete

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:29.719 
they interplay together and a complete

00:03:29.719 --> 00:03:30.909 
they interplay together and a complete
separation<00:03:30.139> of<00:03:30.349> that<00:03:30.500> black<00:03:30.709> and<00:03:30.739> white

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:30.919 
separation of that black and white

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:34.839 
separation of that black and white
palette<00:03:31.760> I<00:03:32.079> think<00:03:33.079> overall<00:03:33.469> it's<00:03:33.980> definitely

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:34.849 
palette I think overall it's definitely
