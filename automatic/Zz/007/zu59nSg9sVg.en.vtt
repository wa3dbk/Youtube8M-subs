on<00:02:44.400> the<00:02:44.489> other<00:02:44.810> arm<00:02:45.810> but<00:02:46.650> the<00:02:48.500> see<00:02:49.500> some

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
on the other arm but the see some

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.729 
on the other arm but the see some
figures<00:02:50.190> shouldn't<00:02:50.580> have<00:02:50.930> I<00:02:51.930> said<00:02:52.620> this

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
figures shouldn't have I said this

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.290 
figures shouldn't have I said this
before<00:02:52.920> that<00:02:53.370> they<00:02:53.520> shouldn't<00:02:53.730> have<00:02:53.850> the

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
before that they shouldn't have the

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.979 
before that they shouldn't have the
individual<00:02:54.989> finger<00:02:55.290> articulation<00:02:55.980> and<00:02:56.989> he

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
individual finger articulation and he

00:02:57.989 --> 00:02:59.720 
individual finger articulation and he
would<00:02:58.140> be<00:02:58.290> one<00:02:58.470> of<00:02:58.590> them<00:02:58.709> you<00:02:59.430> look<00:02:59.580> how<00:02:59.700> they

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
would be one of them you look how they

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.600 
would be one of them you look how they
molded<00:03:00.180> the<00:03:00.360> hand<00:03:00.650> let's<00:03:01.650> just<00:03:01.980> cut<00:03:02.190> this<00:03:02.370> like

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
molded the hand let's just cut this like

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.449 
molded the hand let's just cut this like
these<00:03:03.330> side<00:03:03.780> pieces<00:03:04.320> that<00:03:04.739> stick<00:03:05.010> off<00:03:05.220> and

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
these side pieces that stick off and

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.420 
these side pieces that stick off and
look<00:03:05.550> really<00:03:05.790> stupid<00:03:06.440> but<00:03:07.440> it<00:03:07.590> does<00:03:07.800> have<00:03:08.040> you

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
look really stupid but it does have you

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.560 
look really stupid but it does have you
know<00:03:08.700> individual<00:03:09.390> finger<00:03:09.690> articulation<00:03:10.470> and

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:11.570 
know individual finger articulation and

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:18.320 
know individual finger articulation and
I'm<00:03:12.570> flipping<00:03:12.840> somebody<00:03:13.110> off<00:03:16.760> and<00:03:17.760> really<00:03:18.180> not

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
I'm flipping somebody off and really not

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.000 
I'm flipping somebody off and really not
much<00:03:18.450> else<00:03:18.630> you<00:03:18.750> can<00:03:18.840> do<00:03:19.019> with<00:03:19.049> the<00:03:19.230> same<00:03:19.470> and

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
much else you can do with the same and

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.759 
much else you can do with the same and
