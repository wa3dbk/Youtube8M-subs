00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:10.460
 so this video is for those for whom 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:12.889
 expensive to buy constantly on the classics 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:18.510
 ball bearings 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:20.090
 For what I do, I disassemble them and change them in 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.300
 In this case, on the bottom 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:28.380
 here these gum on top go there 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:33.230
 plastic that's how it is done very 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:39.649
 just for you , you need wheels 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:42.149
 hammer and that's such 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:46.129
 screwdriver with very good metal 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:52.710
 the main thing that she was sharply sharpened 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:53.270
 take support males laugh as you know 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.829
 here 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:58.940
 dissolved two half dot 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.850
 welding so here we need to split it 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:04.890
 I immediately spot welded 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:08.820
 I do not put a chisel or screwdriver right away 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:11.299
 a little globo for a little bit 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.299
 gone 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:18.720
 the metal went now he sold 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.460
 a little bit and now put 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:31.340
 together the video was spot welding and 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:31.340
 several light blows can be seen 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:38.630
 what went the same way 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:47.329
 old dots in welding 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:56.540
 doing this work after 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:10.619
 that's all after replace here 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:12.170
 this is the rubber bushing then re 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:18.629
 welding 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:20.220
 ball bearing is not required here and bolts 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:21.959
 all the exact same job you are 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:26.489
 doing and with the top 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:29.989
 quarrels with supports unscrew the screw 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:34.250
 put the oiler refuel 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:40.739
 all this space is lubricated and all 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:43.069
 go to health and do not break and so 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:48.390
 I continue to make out 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:51.660
 lower ball bearings cleaned them from 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.040
 grease washed over polished surface 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.580
 insofar as 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:03:01.830
 spot welds teeth 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:11.330
 each time did not come across 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:22.970
 take gum put a little grease 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:22.970
 need some grease 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:47.330
 there is enough power here and the old grease 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:53.420
 then a syringe for a syringe interest below 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:04:00.740
 holes and so here we will help 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:04:06.770
 Look a little here so that the lubricant does not 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:19.570
 got here the rubber sleeve she is not there 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:25.880
 need need only paste here 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:27.800
 then see for yourself either immediately 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:31.669
 you put the car fasten 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:35.020
 retract before screwing it 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:38.590
 preferably here is a little gap 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:43.820
 here is this gap before screwing 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:51.050
 preferably a little sealant here 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:55.040
 miss that to protect against 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:59.180
 dust there dirt and all 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:03.590
 garbage here you can know exactly now 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:05.830
 bolt on twist that's plump 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:09.860
 also this very fluff sealant 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:12.800
 you can wait for it to dry and a little 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:17.030
 welding by tacking three places where 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:21.550
 it was exactly everything that way you are ready 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:24.610
 and here's a new one so to speak 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:27.909
 repaired or refurbished 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:32.110
 supports set of 2 pieces these two 

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:36.699
 rezinochki go buy them how many not all 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:40.030
 draw on the market here it is at least 

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:42.909
 cheaper than buying it then of course 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:49.740
 after some time you will have them 

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:54.550
 do i buy a new prop after 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:57.520
 two or three repairs since the mirror is already 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:58.479
 the ball is already getting somewhere rust or 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.029
 sisters 

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:05.020
 what to do this road we have such 

00:06:01.029 --> 00:06:08.939
 it is necessary to change 1 6 

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:14.550
 or somewhere in nine months like this 

00:06:08.939 --> 00:06:17.759
 here so hopefully the video is helpful and so 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:17.759
 can save
