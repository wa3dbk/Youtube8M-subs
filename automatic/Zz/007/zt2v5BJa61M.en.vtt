00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
which is which is nice it gives each

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.559 
which is which is nice it gives each
level<00:02:07.110> a<00:02:07.170> fresh<00:02:07.740> new<00:02:08.099> appeal<00:02:08.489> and<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:09.390> first

will no doubt be impressed by just how
much<00:02:14.459> detail<00:02:14.909> has<00:02:15.330> gone<00:02:15.510> into<00:02:15.659> the<00:02:15.780> levels<00:02:16.080> and

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
much detail has gone into the levels and

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.430 
much detail has gone into the levels and
the<00:02:16.440> world<00:02:16.680> that<00:02:16.830> your<00:02:17.099> your<00:02:17.580> gaming<00:02:17.819> him<00:02:18.440> and

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
the world that your your gaming him and

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.869 
the world that your your gaming him and
the<00:02:19.650> graphics<00:02:19.830> are<00:02:20.280> without<00:02:20.489> a<00:02:20.549> doubt<00:02:20.610> the

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:20.879 
the graphics are without a doubt the

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:23.089 
the graphics are without a doubt the
best<00:02:21.330> I've<00:02:21.690> seen<00:02:21.720> on<00:02:22.019> xbox<00:02:22.379> in<00:02:22.500> a<00:02:22.560> long<00:02:22.830> time

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
best I've seen on xbox in a long time

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:26.240 
best I've seen on xbox in a long time
and<00:02:23.340> they<00:02:23.970> really<00:02:24.360> have<00:02:24.769> pushed<00:02:25.769> boundary

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
and they really have pushed boundary

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.360 
and they really have pushed boundary
with<00:02:26.909> Halo<00:02:27.269> 4<00:02:27.510> and<00:02:27.799> if<00:02:28.799> you're<00:02:28.950> not<00:02:29.040> impressed

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
with Halo 4 and if you're not impressed

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.530 
with Halo 4 and if you're not impressed
by<00:02:29.610> how<00:02:30.360> it<00:02:30.510> looks<00:02:30.810> then<00:02:32.060> I'd<00:02:33.060> be<00:02:33.329> slightly

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
by how it looks then I'd be slightly

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.240 
by how it looks then I'd be slightly
concerned<00:02:34.019> because<00:02:34.200> it<00:02:34.680> just<00:02:34.829> looks

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
concerned because it just looks

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.020 
concerned because it just looks
absolutely<00:02:36.030> fantastic<00:02:37.790> so<00:02:38.790> what<00:02:38.940> about

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
absolutely fantastic so what about

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.300 
absolutely fantastic so what about
gameplay<00:02:39.540> well<00:02:40.079> that's<00:02:40.409> exactly<00:02:40.530> what<00:02:41.159> you'd

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
gameplay well that's exactly what you'd

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.369 
gameplay well that's exactly what you'd
expect<00:02:41.370> from<00:02:41.700> Halo<00:02:42.090> for<00:02:42.390> anything<00:02:43.110> in<00:02:43.349> the

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:43.379 
expect from Halo for anything in the

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:45.800 
expect from Halo for anything in the
Halo<00:02:43.680> series<00:02:43.709> the<00:02:44.519> the<00:02:44.940> physics<00:02:45.269> are<00:02:45.510> pretty

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
Halo series the the physics are pretty

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.410 
Halo series the the physics are pretty
much<00:02:45.930> identical<00:02:46.170> I<00:02:46.680> can't<00:02:46.950> really<00:02:47.129> notice

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
much identical I can't really notice

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.449 
much identical I can't really notice
much<00:02:48.420> much<00:02:48.900> different<00:02:49.140> from<00:02:49.410> any<00:02:49.590> other<00:02:49.650> halos

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
much much different from any other halos

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:55.220 
much much different from any other halos
ER<00:02:50.670> in<00:02:51.030> recent<00:02:51.450> years<00:02:51.510> I<00:02:52.280> would<00:02:53.540> if<00:02:54.540> the

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
ER in recent years I would if the

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.170 
ER in recent years I would if the
formula<00:02:55.560> works<00:02:55.739> you<00:02:56.370> know<00:02:56.400> if<00:02:56.670> it's<00:02:56.879> not<00:02:56.970> broke

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
formula works you know if it's not broke

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.809 
formula works you know if it's not broke
don't<00:02:57.209> fix<00:02:57.569> it<00:02:58.069> which<00:02:59.069> i<00:02:59.220> think<00:02:59.280> is<00:02:59.549> probably

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
don't fix it which i think is probably

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:02.440 
don't fix it which i think is probably
the<00:03:00.180> methodology<00:03:01.140> that<00:03:01.290> they've<00:03:01.859> used<00:03:02.040> here

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
the methodology that they've used here

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.819 
the methodology that they've used here
which<00:03:03.450> is<00:03:03.569> good<00:03:03.720> because<00:03:03.900> you<00:03:04.440> know<00:03:04.560> what<00:03:04.739> you

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:04.829 
which is good because you know what you

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:07.119 
which is good because you know what you
get<00:03:05.010> in<00:03:05.220> and<00:03:05.400> you<00:03:05.760> get<00:03:06.000> straight<00:03:06.329> on<00:03:06.359> with<00:03:06.599> it

00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:07.129 
get in and you get straight on with it

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:09.740 
get in and you get straight on with it
ok<00:03:08.129> so<00:03:08.190> what<00:03:08.549> about<00:03:08.579> the<00:03:08.849> weapons<00:03:08.970> in<00:03:09.269> Halo<00:03:09.540> 4

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
ok so what about the weapons in Halo 4

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.309 
ok so what about the weapons in Halo 4
