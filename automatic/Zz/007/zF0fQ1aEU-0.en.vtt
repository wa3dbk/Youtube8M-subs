figures<00:00:33.149> it<00:00:33.989> fits<00:00:34.350> well<00:00:34.500> enough<00:00:34.770> it's<00:00:34.950> just<00:00:35.010> a

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
figures it fits well enough it's just a

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.670 
figures it fits well enough it's just a
tiny<00:00:35.399> bit<00:00:35.670> too<00:00:35.820> big<00:00:36.030> probably<00:00:36.600> but<00:00:36.840> if<00:00:37.500> you

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
tiny bit too big probably but if you

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.170 
tiny bit too big probably but if you
display<00:00:38.070> it<00:00:38.100> properly<00:00:38.550> you<00:00:38.730> won't<00:00:38.910> even<00:00:39.030> be

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
display it properly you won't even be

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.299 
display it properly you won't even be
able<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.360> tell<00:00:39.600> so<00:00:40.050> it's<00:00:40.170> not<00:00:40.290> a<00:00:40.350> super<00:00:40.829> this

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
able to tell so it's not a super this

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:42.560 
able to tell so it's not a super this
isn't<00:00:41.610> gonna<00:00:41.700> be<00:00:41.820> a<00:00:41.879> super<00:00:42.120> long<00:00:42.270> video

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
isn't gonna be a super long video

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.260 
isn't gonna be a super long video
obviously<00:00:42.899> it's<00:00:43.350> just<00:00:43.530> a<00:00:43.680> minor<00:00:44.520> repaint<00:00:45.149> but

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
obviously it's just a minor repaint but

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.790 
obviously it's just a minor repaint but
I<00:00:45.329> think<00:00:45.510> it<00:00:45.629> warranted<00:00:46.170> a<00:00:46.260> video<00:00:46.500> just<00:00:46.680> to

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
I think it warranted a video just to

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.500 
I think it warranted a video just to
show<00:00:46.950> you<00:00:47.010> guys<00:00:47.250> what's<00:00:47.579> what's<00:00:48.270> capable

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
show you guys what's what's capable

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.299 
show you guys what's what's capable
what's<00:00:49.140> that<00:00:49.260> what's<00:00:49.440> possible<00:00:49.950> I<00:00:50.039> guess<00:00:50.190> I

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
what's that what's possible I guess I

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.180 
what's that what's possible I guess I
should<00:00:50.489> say<00:00:50.700> because<00:00:51.510> um<00:00:51.960> I<00:00:52.230> think<00:00:52.800> a<00:00:52.920> lot<00:00:53.070> of

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
should say because um I think a lot of

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.529 
should say because um I think a lot of
people<00:00:53.399> like<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.760> Vegeta<00:00:54.000> with<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.329> dark

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
people like the Vegeta with the dark

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:55.729 
people like the Vegeta with the dark
hair<00:00:54.600> instead<00:00:55.050> even<00:00:55.230> though<00:00:55.379> we're<00:00:55.500> gonna<00:00:55.590> be

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
hair instead even though we're gonna be

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.639 
hair instead even though we're gonna be
getting<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:56.039> scouter<00:00:56.309> one<00:00:56.750> this<00:00:57.750> this<00:00:58.469> is<00:00:58.620> a

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
getting the scouter one this this is a

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.470 
getting the scouter one this this is a
nice<00:00:58.859> looking<00:00:59.190> figure<00:00:59.399> I<00:00:59.520> think<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.300> black

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
nice looking figure I think the black

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.939 
nice looking figure I think the black
hair<00:01:00.719> really<00:01:00.899> ties<00:01:01.230> in<00:01:01.410> nicely<00:01:01.440> with<00:01:01.800> the

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
hair really ties in nicely with the

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.460 
hair really ties in nicely with the
outfit<00:01:02.430> so<00:01:02.460> I<00:01:03.019> figured<00:01:04.019> I'd<00:01:04.110> just<00:01:04.140> show<00:01:04.409> you

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
outfit so I figured I'd just show you

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.100 
outfit so I figured I'd just show you
guys<00:01:04.559> that<00:01:04.920> so<00:01:05.280> here<00:01:05.610> it<00:01:05.700> is<00:01:05.869> obviously<00:01:06.869> it's

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
guys that so here it is obviously it's

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.190 
guys that so here it is obviously it's
the<00:01:07.700> the<00:01:08.700> smirky<00:01:09.119> face<00:01:09.150> with<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.630> eyes<00:01:09.750> off<00:01:09.990> to

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
the the smirky face with the eyes off to

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.649 
the the smirky face with the eyes off to
the<00:01:10.290> side<00:01:10.500> probably<00:01:10.890> a<00:01:11.159> more<00:01:11.430> iconic<00:01:11.640> look<00:01:12.180> for

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
the side probably a more iconic look for

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.630 
the side probably a more iconic look for
Vegeta<00:01:13.080> then<00:01:13.650> we<00:01:13.799> also<00:01:13.979> have<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.460> two

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
Vegeta then we also have the two

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.170 
Vegeta then we also have the two
alternate<00:01:15.150> heads<00:01:16.460> swap<00:01:17.460> those<00:01:17.670> out<00:01:17.909> real

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
alternate heads swap those out real

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.570 
alternate heads swap those out real
quick<00:01:18.360> or<00:01:18.479> alter<00:01:18.750> alternate<00:01:19.560> faces<00:01:19.979> not<00:01:20.310> heads

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
quick or alter alternate faces not heads

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.499 
quick or alter alternate faces not heads
the<00:01:21.420> heads<00:01:21.600> are<00:01:21.750> all<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.990> same<00:01:23.150> so<00:01:24.150> we<00:01:24.360> also

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
the heads are all the same so we also

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.600 
the heads are all the same so we also
have<00:01:24.900> then<00:01:25.110> just<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.470> plain<00:01:25.680> head<00:01:25.979> where<00:01:26.460> is

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
have then just the plain head where is

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.550 
have then just the plain head where is
just<00:01:26.820> kind<00:01:27.240> of<00:01:27.299> looking<00:01:27.570> forward<00:01:27.810> not<00:01:28.140> really

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
just kind of looking forward not really

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.490 
just kind of looking forward not really
much<00:01:29.040> emotion<00:01:29.520> of<00:01:29.610> expression<00:01:30.090> on<00:01:30.240> his<00:01:30.420> face

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
much emotion of expression on his face

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.929 
much emotion of expression on his face
so<00:01:31.500> we<00:01:31.560> have<00:01:31.680> that<00:01:31.799> one<00:01:31.979> obviously<00:01:32.430> nothing

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
so we have that one obviously nothing

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.910 
so we have that one obviously nothing
too<00:01:33.090> special<00:01:33.329> there<00:01:33.659> then<00:01:34.140> we<00:01:34.290> have<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.560> angry

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
too special there then we have the angry

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.530 
too special there then we have the angry
one<00:01:35.159> where<00:01:35.430> he's<00:01:35.579> kind<00:01:35.790> of<00:01:35.880> gritting<00:01:36.450> his
