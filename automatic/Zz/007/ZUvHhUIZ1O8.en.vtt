00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.740
 and hello to all dear friends with you vulture 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:11.370
 today we will talk about such which 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:15.080
 almost all of the urine so live do not write 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:18.170
 and this topic touches upon that 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:24.150
 how to configure the video card under 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:27.599
 counter-strike 1.6 and me too this 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:31.759
 the question was clogged up in my head and I am a firamir 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:35.460
 rocks on youtube they climbed the forum and 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:38.010
 You know that the trio began for themselves 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.440
 tune up Khakassia shoal thought so 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.140
 better so better whining everybody snapped and 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:47.070
 then here's how you polazil again everywhere 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.320
 watched the video and that's what I got 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:53.960
 what am I in now ron is always 100 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.960
 FPS is not very helpful and 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:01:04.250
 today we talk ati graphics card 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:09.570
 radeon is not a video or any other 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:12.930
 video cards namely about this therefore 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:17.299
 video card can only work through 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:24.049
 this catalyst control center 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:30.170
 like seche or like and in short let's 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:34.979
 let's say we continue and do so 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:36.930
 standard settings are not needed here 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:40.369
 tick the performance 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:44.369
 constantly balanced middle 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:46.979
 smoothing goes further need to write as 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.720
 say how I have everything here is this filter 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.610
 boxing 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:54.570
 level goes 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.780
 is it really use setting 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.130
 applications tick 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:03.930
 adapted smoothing set all 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:06.230
 right and tick no tick here 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.230
 need to 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:19.400
 The following are we them Zod bro 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:21.690
 Anisotropic filtering is still so 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:27.260
 use application settings 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:35.090
 We put a tick and have a drink at the pixel in the 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:38.660
 sampling stand on leo u whether level 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:44.880
 metal and set 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:46.709
 mappings all right and click all 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:50.100
 settings most pen use this 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:51.030
 application settings themselves all all left 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.959
 and filters 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:56.730
 here it is boxing in short all doing it like a 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:02.070
 me first two 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:02.580
 put a tick left then here here to 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:07.709
 goals 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:11.570
 catalyst and it is not necessary to put a tick 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:14.370
 and still put left then 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:18.299
 performance quality level 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:21.500
 detail of the chamber is a set of display and 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:23.570
 set to the right 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:27.209
 wait vertically 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:31.860
 update productive set from 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:33.470
 left 1 unit right off or not 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:38.010
 specify the application 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:40.709
 adapt non- smooth anti-aliasing 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.000
 enable adaptive anti-aliasing set 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:45.510
 completely 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:49.320
 right and not tick and finally 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:53.400
 come to the end of the setting about angel edge 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:59.150
 on and buffer buffering is not necessary to put 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:04:01.980
 tick click apply okay and and 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:04.440
 if you like to say this can 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.970
 swiping cards you must have a top 100 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:10.110
 percent 100 fps 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:12.750
 Well, if you do not have 100 fps then 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:15.090
 put better at 60 I don't know before 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:23.070
 60 fps game I was all ok 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:26.940
 all she took a video card and set up 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:30.980
 completely her under to with and 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:34.890
 get me to the edge 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:36.240
 and yes if you are here for the first time, you can 

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:38.610
