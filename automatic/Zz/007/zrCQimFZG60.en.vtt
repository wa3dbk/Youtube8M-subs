00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.489
 Ivory Coast 

00:00:19.489 --> 00:00:23.539
 after a post-election conflict that reportedly killed nearly 3,000 people 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:28.759
 new power alassane ouattara holds all Ivorians together under its 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:31.519
 presidency whose actresses

 at the rally 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.430
 and hope 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.180
 the assembly 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.310
 it is the vocation of the republic 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:55.980
 we will assume them patiently and fairly 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:02.710
 we count a century the effective and respected fight of the planet 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.040
 yes I have the military laziness 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.420
 you will give personal data 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.280
 you do not have to fight anymore 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.690

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.770

 the union government 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.760

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.800
 in a letter from the political forces of our country 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.380
 and civil society 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.640
 it will consist of men the two women 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.380
 there is no high sense of general interest 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.260
 this is one of the criteria of competence 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.600
 melee and probity 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.159
