00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 
during black ops one time and that was

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.120 
during black ops one time and that was
really<00:05:06.389> expensive<00:05:06.870> it's<00:05:07.199> like<00:05:07.350> 1300<00:05:08.039> a<00:05:08.100> month

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
really expensive it's like 1300 a month

just<00:05:08.520> to<00:05:09.270> live<00:05:09.539> there<00:05:09.720> with<00:05:09.900> the<00:05:10.139> internet<00:05:10.710> and

00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:10.949 
just to live there with the internet and

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:12.740 
just to live there with the internet and
the<00:05:11.340> TV<00:05:11.910> and<00:05:12.030> stuff<00:05:12.240> like<00:05:12.360> that<00:05:12.419> with

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 
the TV and stuff like that with

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.750 
the TV and stuff like that with
utilities<00:05:13.289> had<00:05:13.530> to<00:05:13.590> pay<00:05:13.740> all<00:05:13.860> that<00:05:13.889> shit<00:05:14.250> so

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:14.760 
utilities had to pay all that shit so

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.420 
utilities had to pay all that shit so
it's<00:05:14.910> really<00:05:15.060> really<00:05:15.360> expensive<00:05:15.600> and<00:05:16.139> i<00:05:17.039> think

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:17.430 
it's really really expensive and i think

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:19.490 
it's really really expensive and i think
if<00:05:17.520> i<00:05:17.639> can<00:05:17.849> get<00:05:18.270> a<00:05:18.330> roommate<00:05:18.690> or<00:05:18.900> possibly<00:05:19.289> do<00:05:19.470> a
