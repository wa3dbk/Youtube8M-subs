hello<00:00:06.270> guys<00:00:06.660> the<00:00:06.899> fastest<00:00:07.440> lift<00:00:07.710> ever<00:00:08.040> in

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
hello guys the fastest lift ever in

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.660 
hello guys the fastest lift ever in
Minecraft<00:00:09.210> you<00:00:09.480> cannot<00:00:09.929> make<00:00:10.410> a<00:00:10.710> faster<00:00:11.460> lift

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
Minecraft you cannot make a faster lift

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.310 
Minecraft you cannot make a faster lift
than<00:00:11.910> this<00:00:12.120> I'll<00:00:12.929> give<00:00:13.080> you<00:00:13.139> a<00:00:13.170> quick

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
than this I'll give you a quick

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.570 
than this I'll give you a quick
demonstration<00:00:13.530> first<00:00:14.070> and<00:00:14.309> i'll<00:00:14.370> show<00:00:14.400> you

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
demonstration first and i'll show you

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.519 
demonstration first and i'll show you
how<00:00:14.670> it's<00:00:14.910> done<00:00:14.969> so<00:00:15.870> there's<00:00:16.020> a<00:00:16.080> first<00:00:16.289> floor

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
how it's done so there's a first floor

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.140 
how it's done so there's a first floor
here<00:00:16.770> and<00:00:16.980> a<00:00:17.100> build<00:00:17.340> limit<00:00:17.640> I've<00:00:17.789> only<00:00:17.910> got<00:00:18.119> two

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
here and a build limit I've only got two

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.580 
here and a build limit I've only got two
fours<00:00:18.510> at<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:18.720> moment<00:00:19.020> you<00:00:19.170> can<00:00:19.260> put<00:00:19.380> as<00:00:19.470> many

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
fours at the moment you can put as many

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.950 
fours at the moment you can put as many
as<00:00:19.710> you<00:00:19.800> want<00:00:20.010> or<00:00:20.310> you<00:00:21.029> do<00:00:21.270> it's<00:00:21.570> going<00:00:21.720> trapped

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
as you want or you do it's going trapped

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.769 
as you want or you do it's going trapped
well<00:00:22.140> and<00:00:22.320> you<00:00:23.160> log<00:00:23.279> out<00:00:23.430> go<00:00:24.330> back<00:00:24.480> into<00:00:24.630> your

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
well and you log out go back into your

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.009 
well and you log out go back into your
world<00:00:24.960> and<00:00:25.340> then<00:00:26.340> I'm<00:00:26.460> on<00:00:26.580> first<00:00:26.820> floor<00:00:27.000> as<00:00:27.390> you

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
world and then I'm on first floor as you

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.540 
world and then I'm on first floor as you
see<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.230> first<00:00:28.410> four<00:00:28.590> is<00:00:28.650> not<00:00:28.769> that<00:00:28.859> far<00:00:28.920> above

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
see the first four is not that far above

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.930 
see the first four is not that far above
all<00:00:30.199> you<00:00:31.199> need<00:00:31.740> to<00:00:31.859> do<00:00:31.949> now<00:00:32.130> is<00:00:32.309> if<00:00:32.700> you<00:00:32.759> want<00:00:32.880> to

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
all you need to do now is if you want to

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.120 
all you need to do now is if you want to
go<00:00:33.030> down<00:00:33.210> just<00:00:33.420> go<00:00:33.570> down<00:00:33.750> a<00:00:33.989> normal<00:00:34.710> water

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
go down just go down a normal water

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.720 
go down just go down a normal water
breakage<00:00:35.550> lift<00:00:36.680> so<00:00:37.680> remember<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.219> build<00:00:38.460> limit

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
breakage lift so remember to build limit

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.850 
breakage lift so remember to build limit
so<00:00:39.480> this<00:00:39.780> is<00:00:39.899> going<00:00:40.020> to<00:00:40.079> be<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.379> fast<00:00:40.559> you<00:00:40.739> can

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
so this is going to be the fast you can

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.869 
so this is going to be the fast you can
ever<00:00:41.040> get<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.640> build<00:00:41.879> limit<00:00:43.370> instantaneous<00:00:44.370> we

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
ever get to build limit instantaneous we

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.119 
ever get to build limit instantaneous we
do<00:00:45.090> is<00:00:45.180> go<00:00:45.329> in<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.480> trap<00:00:45.600> door<00:00:45.780> log<00:00:46.440> out<00:00:46.590> back

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
do is go in the trap door log out back

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.760 
do is go in the trap door log out back
in<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.550> now<00:00:47.840> we're<00:00:48.840> at<00:00:48.930> build<00:00:49.110> limit<00:00:49.379> as<00:00:49.530> you

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
in and now we're at build limit as you

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.939 
in and now we're at build limit as you
see<00:00:50.010> if<00:00:50.610> I<00:00:50.700> put<00:00:50.879> this<00:00:50.940> on<00:00:51.260> we're<00:00:52.260> at<00:00:52.379> 240<00:00:53.280> now<00:00:53.460> so

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:54.949 
see if I put this on we're at 240 now so

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:58.220 
see if I put this on we're at 240 now so
we're<00:00:55.949> both<00:00:56.100> limit<00:00:56.480> basically<00:00:57.480> few<00:00:57.899> blocks<00:00:58.109> of

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
we're both limit basically few blocks of

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.380 
we're both limit basically few blocks of
others<00:00:58.410> build<00:00:58.620> limit<00:00:58.829> but<00:00:59.129> if<00:00:59.850> you<00:01:00.030> can<00:01:00.180> beat

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
others build limit but if you can beat

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.569 
others build limit but if you can beat
that<00:01:00.420> on<00:01:00.899> fastest<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.680> top<00:01:01.920> then<00:01:02.340> I'll

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
that on fastest to the top then I'll

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.090 
that on fastest to the top then I'll
love<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:03.059> know<00:01:03.210> now<00:01:03.989> we're<00:01:04.439> going<00:01:04.619> to<00:01:04.710> creative

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
love to know now we're going to creative

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.380 
love to know now we're going to creative
and<00:01:05.540> we<00:01:06.540> will<00:01:06.659> show<00:01:06.810> you<00:01:06.869> how<00:01:06.960> it's<00:01:07.170> built<00:01:08.390> it's

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
and we will show you how it's built it's

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.500 
and we will show you how it's built it's
a<00:01:09.479> very<00:01:09.720> simple<00:01:10.020> design<00:01:10.320> basically<00:01:11.299> very<00:01:12.299> easy

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
a very simple design basically very easy

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.289 
a very simple design basically very easy
to<00:01:12.750> do<00:01:12.900> anyone<00:01:13.500> could<00:01:13.619> do<00:01:13.740> it<00:01:13.770> so<00:01:14.760> first<00:01:15.180> we'll

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
to do anyone could do it so first we'll

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.359 
to do anyone could do it so first we'll
up<00:01:15.390> here<00:01:15.630> he<00:01:16.200> works<00:01:16.409> on<00:01:16.530> principle<00:01:17.009> that<00:01:17.130> in

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
up here he works on principle that in

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.140 
up here he works on principle that in
1.3<00:01:18.299> 1.4<00:01:18.869> if<00:01:19.860> you<00:01:20.070> log<00:01:20.280> out<00:01:20.460> more<00:01:21.000> you're

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
1.3 1.4 if you log out more you're

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.280 
1.3 1.4 if you log out more you're
inside<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.630> block<00:01:22.130> then<00:01:23.130> it<00:01:23.520> will<00:01:23.670> teleport<00:01:23.909> you

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
inside a block then it will teleport you

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.920 
inside a block then it will teleport you
vertically<00:01:25.290> above<00:01:25.909> to<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.000> next<00:01:27.330> available

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
vertically above to the next available

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.800 
vertically above to the next available
blocks<00:01:28.200> so<00:01:29.040> this<00:01:29.670> is<00:01:29.700> what<00:01:29.909> it<00:01:30.000> works<00:01:30.180> on<00:01:30.450> in

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
blocks so this is what it works on in

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.569 
blocks so this is what it works on in
the<00:01:31.020> middle<00:01:31.259> there<00:01:31.500> is<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:31.680> solid<00:01:32.159> pillar<00:01:32.340> and

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
the middle there is a solid pillar and

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.390 
the middle there is a solid pillar and
the<00:01:32.990> bottom<00:01:33.990> there's<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.259> trapdoor<00:01:34.650> you<00:01:35.280> can

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
the bottom there's the trapdoor you can

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.310 
the bottom there's the trapdoor you can
do<00:01:35.460> this<00:01:35.520> four<00:01:35.700> doors<00:01:35.909> trapdoors<00:01:36.659> anything

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
do this four doors trapdoors anything

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.999 
do this four doors trapdoors anything
that<00:01:37.500> can<00:01:37.650> you<00:01:37.770> can<00:01:37.950> glitch<00:01:38.640> inside<00:01:39.329> basically

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 
that can you can glitch inside basically

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:43.850 
that can you can glitch inside basically
so<00:01:41.009> up<00:01:41.850> here<00:01:41.909> I<00:01:42.329> have<00:01:43.170> got<00:01:43.350> a<00:01:43.500> redstone<00:01:43.740> torch

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
so up here I have got a redstone torch

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.940 
so up here I have got a redstone torch
does<00:01:44.460> web<00:01:44.670> vertical<00:01:45.030> wiring<00:01:45.360> up<00:01:45.450> and<00:01:45.600> down

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
does web vertical wiring up and down

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.170 
does web vertical wiring up and down
just<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:47.070> simple<00:01:47.250> inverter<00:01:47.610> all<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:47.970> way<00:01:48.030> up

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
just a simple inverter all the way up

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.480 
just a simple inverter all the way up
and<00:01:48.329> then<00:01:48.420> me<00:01:49.140> at<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.350> top<00:01:49.590> all<00:01:49.829> it<00:01:50.159> does<00:01:50.250> is

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
and then me at the top all it does is

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.609 
and then me at the top all it does is
power<00:01:51.060> these<00:01:51.329> two<00:01:51.570> sticky<00:01:51.930> pistons<00:01:52.290> as<00:01:52.500> you

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
power these two sticky pistons as you

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.600 
power these two sticky pistons as you
see<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:53.990> this<00:01:54.990> block<00:01:55.200> here<00:01:55.530> is<00:01:55.710> where<00:01:56.369> you

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
see and this block here is where you

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.179 
see and this block here is where you
wear<00:01:57.509> this<00:01:58.079> is<00:01:58.259> vertically<00:01:58.649> above<00:01:58.740> where<00:01:59.159> you

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
wear this is vertically above where you

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.969 
wear this is vertically above where you
started<00:02:00.049> water<00:02:01.049> breakage<00:02:01.530> thing<00:02:01.799> are<00:02:01.950> going

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
started water breakage thing are going

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.010 
started water breakage thing are going
to<00:02:02.250> explain<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:03.060> tunnel<00:02:03.390> going<00:02:03.540> down<00:02:03.780> with<00:02:03.990> a

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
to explain the tunnel going down with a

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.740 
to explain the tunnel going down with a
water<00:02:04.259> bottle<00:02:04.740> so<00:02:05.729> this<00:02:05.880> is<00:02:05.909> very<00:02:06.329> very<00:02:06.390> simple

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
water bottle so this is very very simple

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.809 
water bottle so this is very very simple
here<00:02:07.049> and<00:02:07.229> go<00:02:07.770> down<00:02:08.009> we<00:02:08.310> look<00:02:08.429> at<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.700> next

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
here and go down we look at the next

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.990 
here and go down we look at the next
level<00:02:09.030> as<00:02:09.239> well

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.170 

so<00:02:12.840> up<00:02:12.990> here<00:02:13.020> the<00:02:13.710> same<00:02:14.010> again<00:02:14.280> button<00:02:14.940> here

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
so up here the same again button here

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.670 
so up here the same again button here
the<00:02:15.420> reason<00:02:15.690> why<00:02:15.750> I<00:02:15.780> went<00:02:15.900> to<00:02:16.020> the<00:02:16.110> top<00:02:16.260> instead

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
the reason why I went to the top instead

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.220 
the reason why I went to the top instead
of<00:02:16.740> going<00:02:17.010> to<00:02:17.130> here<00:02:17.370> is<00:02:17.970> that<00:02:18.210> this<00:02:18.810> inverter

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
of going to here is that this inverter

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.730 
of going to here is that this inverter
you<00:02:20.010> can<00:02:20.160> have<00:02:20.250> having<00:02:20.580> this<00:02:20.700> one<00:02:20.910> and<00:02:21.470> is<00:02:22.470> then

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
you can have having this one and is then

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.590 
you can have having this one and is then
turning<00:02:23.070> these<00:02:23.280> pistons<00:02:23.670> on<00:02:23.880> which<00:02:24.330> therefore

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
turning these pistons on which therefore

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.150 
turning these pistons on which therefore
this<00:02:24.840> blocks<00:02:25.140> are<00:02:25.380> no<00:02:25.500> longer<00:02:25.680> available<00:02:25.920> to

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
this blocks are no longer available to

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.550 
this blocks are no longer available to
spawn<00:02:26.490> into<00:02:26.670> so<00:02:27.600> the<00:02:27.720> next<00:02:27.870> available<00:02:28.290> one<00:02:28.410> is

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
spawn into so the next available one is

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.210 
spawn into so the next available one is
at<00:02:28.770> the<00:02:28.860> top<00:02:29.040> if<00:02:29.700> I<00:02:29.790> go<00:02:29.910> push<00:02:30.090> the<00:02:30.120> button<00:02:30.510> again

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
at the top if I go push the button again

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.690 
at the top if I go push the button again
it<00:02:32.220> is<00:02:32.340> forest<00:02:32.700> floor<00:02:32.970> so<00:02:33.570> in<00:02:34.470> now<00:02:34.980> lets<00:02:35.580> you

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
it is forest floor so in now lets you

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.310 
it is forest floor so in now lets you
get<00:02:35.820> into<00:02:36.060> this<00:02:36.150> one<00:02:36.390> it<00:02:37.020> doesn't<00:02:37.260> matter

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
get into this one it doesn't matter

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.990 
get into this one it doesn't matter
about<00:02:37.470> the<00:02:37.560> next<00:02:37.860> one<00:02:38.040> although<00:02:38.580> it<00:02:38.850> is

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
about the next one although it is

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.420 
about the next one although it is
actually<00:02:39.209> blocked<00:02:39.570> off<00:02:39.720> up<00:02:39.900> there<00:02:40.220> just<00:02:41.220> means

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
actually blocked off up there just means

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.920 
actually blocked off up there just means
these<00:02:41.640> the<00:02:41.820> next<00:02:42.060> available<00:02:42.240> spots<00:02:42.720> you<00:02:42.900> can

these the next available spots you can
go<00:02:43.200> into<00:02:43.380> so<00:02:44.040> lets<00:02:44.250> you<00:02:44.400> in<00:02:44.550> so<00:02:45.480> you<00:02:46.020> aren't<00:02:46.200> the

go into so lets you in so you aren't the

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.100 
go into so lets you in so you aren't the
most<00:02:46.500> fastest<00:02:47.330> minecraft<00:02:48.330> elevator<00:02:48.750> you<00:02:48.989> can

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
most fastest minecraft elevator you can

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.160 
most fastest minecraft elevator you can
ever<00:02:49.290> have<00:02:49.550> this<00:02:50.550> is<00:02:50.760> it<00:02:50.940> you'll<00:02:51.540> never<00:02:51.840> get

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
ever have this is it you'll never get

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.010 
ever have this is it you'll never get
faster<00:02:52.560> than<00:02:52.680> this<00:02:52.860> they<00:02:53.820> it<00:02:54.330> still<00:02:54.630> works<00:02:54.810> in

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
faster than this they it still works in
