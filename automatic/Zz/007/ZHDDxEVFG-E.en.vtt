00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
evening would qualify something that I

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.630 
evening would qualify something that I
kind<00:00:32.010> of<00:00:32.099> a<00:00:32.189> trick<00:00:32.699> I've<00:00:32.879> and<00:00:33.090> for<00:00:33.210> myself<00:00:33.360> that

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:34.640 
kind of a trick I've and for myself that

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.430 
kind of a trick I've and for myself that
may<00:00:35.640> not<00:00:35.910> or<00:00:36.239> maybe<00:00:36.269> well-known<00:00:37.080> I<00:00:37.170> don't<00:00:37.350> know

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
may not or maybe well-known I don't know

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.350 
may not or maybe well-known I don't know
a<00:00:37.710> lot<00:00:38.220> of<00:00:38.280> people<00:00:38.370> probably<00:00:38.550> don't<00:00:38.940> bother

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
a lot of people probably don't bother

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.060 
a lot of people probably don't bother
this<00:00:39.840> anymore<00:00:40.050> because<00:00:40.470> they're<00:00:40.829> doing

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
this anymore because they're doing

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.049 
this anymore because they're doing
it<00:00:41.190> digitally<00:00:41.640> but<00:00:42.350> I<00:00:43.520> still<00:00:44.520> like<00:00:44.790> doing

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
it digitally but I still like doing

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.500 
it digitally but I still like doing
stuff<00:00:45.480> with<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:46.200> ink<00:00:46.380> and<00:00:47.300> it<00:00:48.300> looks

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
stuff with the ink and it looks

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.420 
stuff with the ink and it looks
different<00:00:48.809> it's<00:00:49.590> perfect<00:00:49.860> when<00:00:50.190> you<00:00:50.250> do<00:00:50.309> it<00:00:50.370> in

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
different it's perfect when you do it in

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.100 
different it's perfect when you do it in
a<00:00:50.489> computer<00:00:50.910> but<00:00:51.510> that's<00:00:51.690> kind<00:00:51.989> of<00:00:52.020> the

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
a computer but that's kind of the

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.170 
a computer but that's kind of the
problem<00:00:53.300> perfect<00:00:54.300> so<00:00:54.750> I<00:00:55.350> like<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.520> little<00:00:57.090> to

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
problem perfect so I like a little to

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.420 
problem perfect so I like a little to
the<00:00:57.210> message<00:00:57.629> of<00:00:57.750> this<00:00:57.920> the<00:00:58.920> problem<00:00:59.250> is<00:00:59.340> how

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
the message of this the problem is how

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.619 
the message of this the problem is how
to<00:00:59.460> ink<00:00:59.700> a<00:00:59.820> circle<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.930> probably<00:01:01.440> right<00:01:01.620> away

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 
to ink a circle and probably right away

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:05.870 
to ink a circle and probably right away
it<00:01:03.629> seems<00:01:04.020> fairly<00:01:04.410> self-explanatory<00:01:04.800> this<00:01:05.700> is

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
it seems fairly self-explanatory this is

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.080 
it seems fairly self-explanatory this is
just<00:01:06.060> a<00:01:06.180> piece<00:01:06.330> of<00:01:06.360> cardboard<00:01:06.979> from<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.910> back

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
just a piece of cardboard from the back

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.389 
just a piece of cardboard from the back
of<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.330> pad<00:01:09.600> I<00:01:10.020> have<00:01:10.560> these<00:01:10.830> clamps<00:01:11.190> around

00:01:11.389 --> 00:01:11.399 
of the pad I have these clamps around

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:15.440 
of the pad I have these clamps around
wearing<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.360> little<00:01:12.740> cheap<00:01:13.740> seat<00:01:14.009> clamp<00:01:14.450> to

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
wearing a little cheap seat clamp to

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.940 
wearing a little cheap seat clamp to
hold<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.810> table<00:01:15.990> securely<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:16.679> I'm<00:01:16.800> going<00:01:16.920> to

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
hold the table securely and I'm going to

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.880 
hold the table securely and I'm going to
put<00:01:17.039> my<00:01:17.100> arm<00:01:17.640> on<00:01:17.819> and<00:01:18.030> rest<00:01:18.179> on<00:01:18.330> it<00:01:18.420> as<00:01:18.509> well

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
put my arm on and rest on it as well

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.070 
put my arm on and rest on it as well
there's<00:01:19.890> a<00:01:20.450> it's<00:01:21.450> over<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.720> edge<00:01:21.840> of<00:01:21.959> the

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
there's a it's over the edge of the

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.870 
there's a it's over the edge of the
table<00:01:22.289> so<00:01:22.590> I<00:01:22.649> could<00:01:22.830> put<00:01:22.979> a<00:01:23.039> tap<00:01:23.310> all<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.789> way

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
table so I could put a tap all the way

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.290 
table so I could put a tap all the way
through<00:01:24.179> it<00:01:24.300> and<00:01:24.590> there<00:01:25.590> is<00:01:25.619> attacked<00:01:26.300> through

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:27.300 
through it and there is attacked through

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.830 
through it and there is attacked through
the<00:01:27.509> middle<00:01:27.750> was<00:01:28.530> this<00:01:28.740> circle<00:01:29.640> record<00:01:30.240> that<00:01:30.810> I

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
the middle was this circle record that I

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:31.899 
the middle was this circle record that I
have<00:01:31.050> to

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:31.909 
have to

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:35.969 
have to
and<00:01:32.630> that<00:01:33.079> means<00:01:33.289> that<00:01:33.409> I<00:01:33.560> can<00:01:33.740> just<00:01:34.329> move<00:01:35.329> it

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979 
and that means that I can just move it

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:39.520 
and that means that I can just move it
back<00:01:36.979> a<00:01:37.009> DAC<00:01:37.310> and<00:01:37.659> I<00:01:38.659> usually<00:01:38.840> put<00:01:39.140> my<00:01:39.259> hand

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
back a DAC and I usually put my hand

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.440 
back a DAC and I usually put my hand
right<00:01:39.770> on<00:01:40.189> the<00:01:40.429> thing<00:01:40.640> to<00:01:40.759> help<00:01:40.850> anchor<00:01:41.210> it

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
right on the thing to help anchor it

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.389 
right on the thing to help anchor it
right<00:01:41.600> on<00:01:41.719> the<00:01:41.840> top<00:01:41.990> of<00:01:42.020> that<00:01:42.229> thumbtack<00:01:42.590> and

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399 
right on the top of that thumbtack and

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:47.800 
right on the top of that thumbtack and
then<00:01:43.850> just<00:01:44.319> make<00:01:45.319> my<00:01:45.789> ink<00:01:46.789> lines<00:01:47.090> and<00:01:47.479> build

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
then just make my ink lines and build

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.039 
then just make my ink lines and build
them<00:01:48.049> up<00:01:48.909> any<00:01:49.909> we<00:01:50.090> can<00:01:50.179> kind<00:01:50.420> of<00:01:50.509> messy<00:01:50.869> because

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049 
them up any we can kind of messy because

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:53.459 
them up any we can kind of messy because
I'm<00:01:51.289> going<00:01:51.530> for<00:01:51.740> a<00:01:51.829> little<00:01:52.099> bit<00:01:52.280> messy<00:01:52.520> anyway

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:53.469 
I'm going for a little bit messy anyway

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:55.719 
I'm going for a little bit messy anyway
basically<00:01:54.469> this<00:01:54.590> gives<00:01:54.859> me<00:01:54.950> a<00:01:55.039> consistent

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
basically this gives me a consistent

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:05.559 
basically this gives me a consistent
curve<00:01:56.119> and<00:02:01.270> fairly<00:02:02.270> good<00:02:02.810> results<00:02:03.469> and<00:02:04.569> then

00:02:05.559 --> 00:02:05.569 
curve and fairly good results and then

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:09.490 
curve and fairly good results and then
you<00:02:05.959> could<00:02:06.319> units<00:02:06.649> long<00:02:08.019> quickly<00:02:09.019> Kate<00:02:09.319> it

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
you could units long quickly Kate it

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.009 
you could units long quickly Kate it
clearer<00:02:09.799> than<00:02:10.129> I<00:02:10.280> do<00:02:10.340> because<00:02:11.299> you<00:02:11.629> know<00:02:11.750> a

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:12.019 
clearer than I do because you know a

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:31.520 
clearer than I do because you know a
message<00:02:12.470> label<00:02:17.560> yeah

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.920 

so<00:02:32.530> things<00:02:32.860> to<00:02:33.069> me<00:02:33.280> you<00:02:33.340> can<00:02:33.489> measure<00:02:33.900> doing<00:02:34.900> a

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
so things to me you can measure doing a

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:40.860 
so things to me you can measure doing a
record<00:02:35.340> and<00:02:38.940> it's<00:02:39.940> actually<00:02:40.090> only<00:02:40.450> posed<00:02:40.750> to

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
record and it's actually only posed to

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.930 
record and it's actually only posed to
have<00:02:40.989> one<00:02:41.290> track<00:02:41.680> but<00:02:42.370> I<00:02:42.459> did<00:02:42.700> it<00:02:42.819> the<00:02:42.910> first

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
have one track but I did it the first

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.520 
have one track but I did it the first
time<00:02:43.270> it<00:02:43.599> appears<00:02:43.930> the<00:02:44.050> beginning<00:02:44.349> of<00:02:44.470> the

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
find clear indication they're actually

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.850

down so I don't worry too much about
whether<00:03:15.310> or<00:03:15.430> not<00:03:15.549> it<00:03:15.670> was<00:03:15.730> in<00:03:15.910> the<00:03:16.000> acuras

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739

yeah<00:03:21.739> you<00:03:21.799> can<00:03:22.040> kind<00:03:22.250> of<00:03:22.310> measure<00:03:22.519> where<00:03:22.819> the

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:23.299 
yeah you can kind of measure where the

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:28.890 
yeah you can kind of measure where the
group<00:03:23.629> is<00:03:25.000> keep<00:03:26.000> your<00:03:26.030> things<00:03:26.480> all<00:03:26.780> lined<00:03:27.170> up

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
group is keep your things all lined up

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.479 
group is keep your things all lined up
and<00:03:29.900> like<00:03:30.110> most<00:03:30.319> things<00:03:30.530> we're<00:03:30.980> thinking<00:03:31.370> it's

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:31.489 
and like most things we're thinking it's

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:36.699 
and like most things we're thinking it's
a<00:03:31.640> little<00:03:31.849> bit<00:03:33.099> slow<00:03:34.099> and<00:03:35.000> tease<00:03:35.360> but<00:03:36.349> it<00:03:36.500> makes

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709 
a little bit slow and tease but it makes

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:40.500 
a little bit slow and tease but it makes
the<00:03:36.920> basic<00:03:37.370> issue<00:03:37.549> of<00:03:37.819> how<00:03:38.000> to<00:03:38.060> get<00:03:38.239> that<00:03:38.450> curve

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
the basic issue of how to get that curve

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:47.259 
the basic issue of how to get that curve
pretty<00:03:41.510> simple<00:03:43.810> fun<00:03:44.810> one<00:03:45.049> that's<00:03:45.500> it<00:03:46.269> take

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:47.269 
pretty simple fun one that's it take

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:49.569 
pretty simple fun one that's it take
another<00:03:47.680> half<00:03:48.680> an<00:03:48.890> hour<00:03:49.069> to<00:03:49.159> finish<00:03:49.340> that

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:49.579 
another half an hour to finish that

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:52.000 
another half an hour to finish that
problem
