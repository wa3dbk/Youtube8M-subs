battle I thought I'd yet I thought I'd

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.909 
battle I thought I'd yet I thought I'd
you<00:05:01.950> know<00:05:02.010> do<00:05:02.250> it<00:05:02.340> um<00:05:02.840> sort<00:05:03.840> of<00:05:03.900> not<00:05:04.110> live<00:05:04.290> for

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:06.020 
you know do it um sort of not live for
difficult<00:05:05.220> after<00:05:05.340> it's<00:05:05.580> just<00:05:05.729> so<00:05:05.790> I<00:05:05.820> can<00:05:05.880> go

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 
difficult after it's just so I can go

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:07.550 
difficult after it's just so I can go
through<00:05:06.210> their<00:05:06.330> theory<00:05:06.600> the<00:05:07.020> last<00:05:07.200> peg<00:05:07.380> one

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
through their theory the last peg one

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.680 
through their theory the last peg one
was<00:05:07.680> a<00:05:07.830> noibat<00:05:08.639> which<00:05:08.970> we<00:05:09.150> could<00:05:09.300> have<00:05:09.419> taken<00:05:09.540> I

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:09.690 
was a noibat which we could have taken I

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:11.150 
was a noibat which we could have taken I
guess<00:05:09.930> we<00:05:10.080> can<00:05:10.200> offer<00:05:10.320> a<00:05:10.410> psychic<00:05:10.800> and<00:05:10.860> taking

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:11.160 
guess we can offer a psychic and taking

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.200 
guess we can offer a psychic and taking
that<00:05:11.220> thing<00:05:11.430> out<00:05:11.520> that's<00:05:11.760> what<00:05:11.850> I<00:05:11.880> was

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.210
