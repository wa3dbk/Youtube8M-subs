00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:22.510
 to the 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:25.160
 so let's start with the video 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:29.150
 for the first idea we are going to need 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:32.150
 a little piece of flowers for 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:34.280
 decorate the odd photo that most 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.940
 like it may be the one they want 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.940
 you choose 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.150
 pieces of paper to write something very very 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:46.020
 cute 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.940
 Tempered pins of many colors and a 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:52.430
 old brush that they do not use anymore and 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.430
 Now let's start 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.780
 The first thing we are going to do to avoid 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:01.299
 stain nothing nothing nothing is cover all the 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:05.070
 area with a little paper diary paper 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:05.070
 magazine network or some old paper 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.800
 now with the colors of the flowers 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.110
 that we like more we are going to take a 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.180
 little plate and let's put the colors there 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.740
 what are we going to want to use happens three nothing 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.150
 more than were the ones that seemed to me 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.850
 combined with the flowers that had 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.430
 chosen then now with the little brush 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.560
 and a little bit of water was 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.990
 like splashing the entire area of ​​the thermos 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.940
 So, two spots are left 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:34.340
 colors because if they combine because 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.680
 as I had put water they are combining 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.450
 and they're going to be great, well, they're going to go 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.580
 doing until you like and if you want 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.950
 you can cover everything or leave it as well 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.870
 salt minced that was how I left it and 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:48.760
 ready now what you have to do is 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.760
 wait for it to dry very, very well 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.660
 all we have left now is to go 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:01.060
 grabbing the flowers the pins the photos 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.070
 the notes and remembering all of the 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.570
 better way than the way more more 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:06.700
 we like the truth that I took a 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:09.100
 lots to tell me but well well I 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.770
 I stay and the truth that I liked was very 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:14.770
 but very easy to do it and I swear that 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:17.250
 it was but beautiful they are going to see that they are going 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.250
 love 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:31.520
 for the next idea we need 300 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:36.710
 grams of flour baking powder a 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:40.580
 teaspoon of sugar 100 grams 150 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:45.770
 grams of butter 2 eggs 1 teaspoon 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:47.430
 of essence of vanilla lot 11 of milk 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:49.530
 and let's start 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.299
 The first thing we are going to do is grab 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.519
 a bowl to go putting all the 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:56.939
 ingredients the first thing we're going to 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:59.989
 place is the flour together with the sugar 

00:03:56.939 --> 00:04:04.849
 and the teaspoon of baking powder 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:04.849
 that we are going to integrate everything very well 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:15.670
 and once integrated super super well you 

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:18.100
 let's add the semi butter 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:20.079
 melted and there we will mix it to 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:23.139
 mix and mix until we have left 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:25.770
 a half way as a shepherd that's 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:25.770
 the perfect shape 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:36.380
 and finally we are going to add the 

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:37.850
 eggs I just add one by one you 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.070
 You can do it the way you like most 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:41.720
 agree and finally also not 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:43.400
 forget to add the teaspoon of 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:46.490
 essence of vanilla that will give you the 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:48.080
 final touch and now if what they have to 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:49.669
 do is mix and mix until you 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.560
 If you want a mass, 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:54.130
 use your hands to make them 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.130
 easier 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:58.790
 now let's flour the whole area in 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:01.010
 which we are going to work because if not 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:02.900
 How has butter and egg and others 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:05.060
 we're going to rally everything and we do not want that 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.820
 then what we are going to do is knead 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:10.010
 and knead to show very well until it 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:11.840
 extend super well because as it has the 

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:14.150
 baking powder in the oven goes 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:16.730
 as to raise and we do not want that then 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:19.340
 what are we going to do with a little bag or 

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:21.230
 with something they have to cut we're going 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:23.510
 to do a kind of circles and what 

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:25.340
 let's place in a source doing 

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:28.780
 like a kind of wall and it 's thing of 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:28.780
 that is like something small 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:31.820
 Y 

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:39.800
 do not forget to put to preheat the 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:41.810
 oven at about 150 or 180 degrees now a 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:43.729
 Once they are ready at the source, 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:46.490
 we will place in the oven until 

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:48.139
 they are golden brown and ready I then 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:50.000
 I took out and put them in a kind of 

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:52.960
 pilotines but if you can 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.960
 do optionally 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:08.289
 once you let them cool so 

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:10.539
 we burn, we are going to add it to each 

00:06:08.289 --> 00:06:12.580
 a little bit of dulce de leche me 

00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:13.870
 prime I exceeded and added a lot 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:17.129
 dulce de leche but the truth is that 

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:17.129
 they were delicious 

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:26.210
 finally I added some pints of 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:27.949
 colors to give it a little more color 

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:30.580
 and emotion to the matter and they were 

00:06:27.949 --> 00:06:30.580
 very good 

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:36.950
 they feel easy to do and there 

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:38.930
 public middle process to give that 

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:41.240
