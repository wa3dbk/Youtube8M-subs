00:00:09.239 --> 00:00:12.239
 this story overwhelmed being seen from the thirties 

00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:16.449
 years that not a week went by us on the bridge, let alone that one 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:18.989
 received payment to be able to pay 

00:00:18.989 --> 00:00:21.989
 every day it was a struggle for the man to feed his family 

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:25.929
 dear wife also sow all day at the fairs 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.480
 one day with his wife at the door and told him you are now better for us 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.560
 army denied to return to technology earlier 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.650
 the man took a shot with big fat duck and started walking 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:38.640
 that is not strange 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.970
 Well he had to come along 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.380
 suddenly he stopped and that idea 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.520
 I call for a pizza delivery 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.260
 maarten blew in mind as I myself would immediately think it was 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.350
 another forty years before the first pizzeria and delivery service Oostakker 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:54.359
 the man is walked 

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:56.250
 walked and kept thinking 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.700
 corner he could have known 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.880
 completely exhausted after two duels 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.520
 he sank through his legs and you can fully open his skates when he realized 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.230
 fits that he had forgotten to put on the pants 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.150
 he takes out his pocket or, for example, a pack of cigarettes and on it 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:10.940
 last 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.050
 head bent siege you know what's on it again 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.240
 he visits to eat completely lifted 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.050
 all this man never succeeded has been a while 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.260
 suddenly the bushes looked, he saw a little transport 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.790
 with his last powers he can do it again 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.720
 he broke off a thick branch of a tree and took a lace from his shoes 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.670
 to make a fishing rod in the hours the may roar or a tiebreak 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.740
 but no nothing at all 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.020
 but still tight a few bags just when the man wanted to get up 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.680
 he just had something better 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:41.970
 this was a hefty one 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.100
 there was a whole on almost broke he put his feet off but didn't get away 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.110
 to guide 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.360
 when all of a sudden the man surfaced, I could clearly see what it was 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.510
 pulled all the way to it 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:53.940
 the man was startled 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.650
 it was still a bike because it was 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.600
 a little for the girl 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.569
 goddamn day time 

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:03.569
 But all that effort is made to house the platform 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.370
 he had not seen if that was a small why on the stove 

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:09.889
 saucepan stood 

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:13.219
 quick look and saucepan he saw the device to buy our car 

00:02:14.359 --> 00:02:17.900
 the man tried to lift the stove out of the water but burn it at the same time 

00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:21.189
 his hands on the neighborhood of what was still growing was 

00:02:21.899 --> 00:02:23.809
 careful so you can neighborhood you up 

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:25.919
 boyd surprised by the government 

00:02:25.919 --> 00:02:27.599
 on what was in it 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:30.769
 in that case you should lay chicken on the Herenweg chicken 

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:34.959
 the man was just lucky 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:37.459
 corner finally feeding his family 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:40.719
 he tried the small things with his last powers 

00:02:40.719 --> 00:02:44.469
 whose father dragged home for trip when he left behind once 

00:02:44.469 --> 00:02:47.589
 a scan at home for the shouted he stays throughout the house 

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:49.609
 he kept me off 

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:51.819
 but remained icy silent 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:53.599
 there was nobody at all 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:55.389
 the man did not walk anymore 

00:02:55.389 --> 00:02:59.009
 then the man saw on the kitchen table of a small note and read 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:02.849
 it was a note from his wife and stood up 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:06.269
 I can be myself with a man who can also maintain 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:07.759
 I am really sorry 

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:09.830

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.830
 just the 10 kilometers away at the African dairy cow 

00:03:13.679 --> 00:03:16.249
 he cluttered the letters and threw it away 

00:03:16.249 --> 00:03:19.449
 the man had the happiest and at the same time there is a day of his 

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:20.129
 life 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:21.979
 he kept all those wrong 

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:25.019
 all glad that we did 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:27.919

00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:30.849
