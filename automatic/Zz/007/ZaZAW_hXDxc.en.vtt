this<00:00:20.120> is<00:00:20.300> the<00:00:20.480> hot<00:00:20.720> water<00:00:21.520> room<00:00:22.520> temperature

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:22.550 
this is the hot water room temperature

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.990 
this is the hot water room temperature
water<00:00:23.270> and<00:00:23.600> cold<00:00:24.200> water<00:00:24.350> and<00:00:24.950> I<00:00:25.010> just<00:00:25.250> put<00:00:25.490> in

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:26.000 
water and cold water and I just put in

temperature of the cold water is 41

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.500 
temperature of the cold water is 41
degrees<00:00:39.340> the<00:00:40.340> temperature<00:00:40.970> of<00:00:41.239> the<00:00:41.390> room

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
degrees the temperature of the room

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:22.370 
their own temperature water is now at

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:30.260 
their own temperature water is now at
787<00:01:24.170> three<00:01:25.170> degrees<00:01:25.590> and<00:01:28.220> the<00:01:29.220> cold<00:01:29.460> water<00:01:30.000> is

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
787 three degrees and the cold water is

00:01:30.270 --> 00:02:16.949 
787 three degrees and the cold water is
now<00:01:30.720> forty<00:01:31.440> two<00:01:31.620> point<00:01:31.920> one<00:01:32.130> degrees

as<00:02:17.530> you<00:02:17.739> can<00:02:17.920> see<00:02:18.189> the<00:02:18.909> dye<00:02:19.920> spread<00:02:20.920> the

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
as you can see the dye spread the
