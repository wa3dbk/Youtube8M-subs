little carbon going to crunch up these
leaves<00:02:27.940> you<00:02:28.599> know<00:02:28.720> you<00:02:28.780> can<00:02:28.989> also<00:02:29.110> use<00:02:29.319> a

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
leaves you know you can also use a

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.729 
leaves you know you can also use a
cardboard<00:02:29.980> or<00:02:30.480> ripped<00:02:31.480> up<00:02:31.629> newspaper<00:02:32.049> but<00:02:32.530> I'm

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
cardboard or ripped up newspaper but I'm

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:33.900 
cardboard or ripped up newspaper but I'm
just<00:02:32.890> going<00:02:33.099> to<00:02:33.190> use<00:02:33.310> these<00:02:33.459> leaves<00:02:33.730> that's

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
just going to use these leaves that's

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.940 
just going to use these leaves that's
around<00:02:34.120> the<00:02:34.269> are<00:02:34.390> and<00:02:35.260> I'll<00:02:35.410> crunch<00:02:35.650> them<00:02:35.830> all

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
around the are and I'll crunch them all

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:43.080 
around the are and I'll crunch them all
up<00:02:39.390> and<00:02:40.390> just<00:02:40.690> keep<00:02:41.410> adding<00:02:41.620> waste<00:02:42.549> on<00:02:42.730> top<00:02:42.910> of

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
up and just keep adding waste on top of

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.890 
up and just keep adding waste on top of
that<00:02:43.769> and<00:02:45.120> I'll<00:02:46.120> just<00:02:46.329> fill<00:02:46.599> this<00:02:46.750> entire

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
that and I'll just fill this entire

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.339 
that and I'll just fill this entire
thing<00:02:48.000> and<00:02:49.000> there<00:02:49.180> you<00:02:49.269> go

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:50.349 
thing and there you go

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:51.869 
thing and there you go
one<00:02:50.769> more<00:02:50.950> thing<00:02:51.129> I<00:02:51.220> probably<00:02:51.400> need<00:02:51.610> to<00:02:51.640> put<00:02:51.819> a

00:02:51.869 --> 00:02:51.879 
one more thing I probably need to put a

00:02:51.879 --> 00:03:05.990 
one more thing I probably need to put a
lid<00:02:52.090> on<00:02:52.120> so<00:02:52.569> I'll<00:02:52.930> just<00:02:53.230> use<00:02:53.410> a<00:02:53.440> michael<00:02:54.310> bucket

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.099 

all<00:03:07.000> right<00:03:07.150> well<00:03:07.359> maybe<00:03:07.480> I'll<00:03:07.629> find<00:03:07.900> a<00:03:07.959> better

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:08.109 
all right well maybe I'll find a better

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:11.330 
all right well maybe I'll find a better
bucket<00:03:08.530> but<00:03:09.269> anyway<00:03:10.269> so<00:03:10.329> there<00:03:10.660> you<00:03:10.750> go

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
bucket but anyway so there you go

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.569 
bucket but anyway so there you go
there's<00:03:12.340> that's<00:03:12.970> how<00:03:13.150> to<00:03:13.209> make<00:03:13.389> a<00:03:13.420> worm<00:03:13.690> tower

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:14.579 
there's that's how to make a worm tower

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:19.170 
there's that's how to make a worm tower
so<00:03:15.579> you're<00:03:15.880> directly<00:03:17.400> using<00:03:18.400> permaculture<00:03:18.819> in

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
so you're directly using permaculture in

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.240 
so you're directly using permaculture in
the<00:03:19.540> garden<00:03:19.900> this<00:03:20.349> is<00:03:20.410> pretty<00:03:20.709> cool<00:03:20.980> I'm<00:03:21.099> gonna

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
the garden this is pretty cool I'm gonna

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.520 
the garden this is pretty cool I'm gonna
see<00:03:21.400> if<00:03:21.489> this<00:03:21.579> works<00:03:22.049> I'll<00:03:23.049> probably<00:03:23.230> make<00:03:23.380> an

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
see if this works I'll probably make an

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:24.860 
see if this works I'll probably make an
update<00:03:23.829> video<00:03:24.010> in<00:03:24.340> a<00:03:24.400> couple<00:03:24.639> of<00:03:24.669> months

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
update video in a couple of months

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.270 
update video in a couple of months
alright<00:03:25.870> once<00:03:26.079> again<00:03:26.290> this<00:03:26.410> Matt<00:03:26.620> let's<00:03:27.069> rock
