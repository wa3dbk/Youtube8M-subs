I'd<00:00:43.070> survive<00:00:43.220> an<00:00:43.670> open<00:00:43.940> eye<00:00:44.030> surgery<00:00:44.540> and

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
I'd survive an open eye surgery and

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.590 
I'd survive an open eye surgery and
Linda<00:00:45.410> my<00:00:45.590> wife<00:00:45.830> found<00:00:46.520> this<00:00:46.850> study<00:00:47.150> that<00:00:47.239> was

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
Linda my wife found this study that was

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.350 
Linda my wife found this study that was
under<00:00:47.870> way<00:00:48.080> for<00:00:48.610> repairing<00:00:49.610> heart<00:00:49.940> valves

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:50.360 
under way for repairing heart valves

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.780 
under way for repairing heart valves
without<00:00:50.480> open-heart<00:00:51.290> surgery<00:00:51.800> there<00:00:52.760> are

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:52.790 
without open-heart surgery there are

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:54.580 
without open-heart surgery there are
only<00:00:52.940> a<00:00:53.059> few<00:00:53.120> hospitals<00:00:53.809> in<00:00:53.989> the<00:00:54.080> country<00:00:54.230> that

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:54.590 
only a few hospitals in the country that

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.130 
only a few hospitals in the country that
were<00:00:54.710> doing<00:00:55.040> it<00:00:55.190> we<00:00:55.790> thought<00:00:56.030> for<00:00:56.629> sure<00:00:56.660> one<00:00:57.110> of

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
were doing it we thought for sure one of

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.070 
were doing it we thought for sure one of
the<00:00:57.290> hospitals<00:00:58.190> in<00:00:58.400> Boston<00:00:58.629> would<00:00:59.629> be<00:00:59.809> doing

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:00.080 
the hospitals in Boston would be doing

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.320 
the hospitals in Boston would be doing
it<00:01:00.230> but<00:01:00.410> they<00:01:00.530> they<00:01:00.949> weren't<00:01:01.190> the<00:01:01.699> closest<00:01:02.150> one

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:02.330 
it but they they weren't the closest one

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.290 
it but they they weren't the closest one
was<00:01:02.540> vein<00:01:03.110> Medical<00:01:03.589> Center

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:05.300 
was vein Medical Center

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.160 
was vein Medical Center
there<00:01:06.300> was<00:01:06.420> no<00:01:06.570> other<00:01:06.660> site<00:01:06.900> in<00:01:07.020> New<00:01:07.140> England

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
there was no other site in New England

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.320 
there was no other site in New England
and<00:01:07.920> so<00:01:08.190> having<00:01:08.730> a<00:01:08.910> site<00:01:09.120> in<00:01:09.240> New<00:01:09.300> England

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
and so having a site in New England

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.360 
and so having a site in New England
meant<00:01:09.870> there<00:01:10.080> was<00:01:10.170> access<00:01:10.680> for<00:01:11.250> patients

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:11.370 
meant there was access for patients

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:12.620 
meant there was access for patients
