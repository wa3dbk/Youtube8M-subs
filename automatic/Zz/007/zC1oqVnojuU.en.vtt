00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 hey i'm doing something i already do today 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.100
 have not done a while namely one 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.140
 review in video form 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.780
 today i'm going for a zoeva mixed metals 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.010
 palette reviewing and showing looks is 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.690
 own what I normally post a blog post 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.920
 but then in a video 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.890
 this is one of the new palettes of 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.230
 zoeva sofa is a tassels brand or one 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.640
 kwastenwebshop from germany and they 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.480
 also have their own since a few 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.430
 make-up and this zoeva metal or this zoeva 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.349
 mixed metals palette is new he sees 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.359
 look beautiful it is a cardboard a palette 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.019
 and it is in a kind of cover 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.660
 a kind with it 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.640
 uhhmm a cardboard case over it very much 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.280
 and the somewhat awkward looking but the first time 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.239
 you do that and then i leave in everyone 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.890
 case that corner is really tight 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:45.030
 is also a bit unnecessary because it 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.760
 looks exactly the same but 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.260
 it looks nice it is one 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.469
 palette of cardboard 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.969
 it is completely cardboard which makes him tasty 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.579
 light and makes his hand and by which he 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.199
 I think it's cheaper but I find cardboard 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.550
 never really a very nice package 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.559
 for palmetjes because I play anyway 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.210
 often take away and cardboard just goes fast 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.519
 pieces state that once product 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.500
 leaks in your toilet bag then this is out 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.939
 you immediately a piece and it 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.189
 quickly damages the corners go fast 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.860
 broken and I just really hate it 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.090
 to our palette of cardboard is far away 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.750
 very handy it is very thin 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.400
 palette 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.909
 he is quite small easy to go with 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.830
 in your bag there is a total of ten times 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.979
 one and a half grams of product in so I got it 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:29.130
 a total of 15 grams of eye shadow in that is a lot 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.320
 and a total of 10 shades of no parabens 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.170
 no mineral oil no perfume 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.000
 give to let superia cock notation easy 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.159
 to blent with far too many and made in 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.780
 italy and all the ingredients 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.509
 on the back 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.829
 when you open it you will see this 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.149
 I've already used it as you see 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.210
 of course otherwise I didn't have a review 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.259
 10 colors can give and I m here 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.170
 show up close 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.759
 I think it is very beautiful that there really is 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.680
 a mix of shades is my love 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.450
 red shopping this is it in my mind 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.579
 there is green and blue in your can 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.130
 make a brown look just look and 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:04.079
 blue look what more pinkish look you can 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.659
 experience gray looks and there is one 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:09.599
 matte black color in I think is great 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.800
 because matte black is just ideal for it 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.390
 to darken the look 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.160
 to make 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.530
 use eyeliner to just be whole 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.060
 nice dark smokey look to do with 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.410
 that is gray or just with one of the 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.200
 other colors 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.780
 every color has a name and they are 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.569
 all inspired the metal types 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:29.720
 so there is branch rusty steel copperplate 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:31.340
 and mini your ear steam crush him well that 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.440
 I just like to think of it and it is 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.730
 useful for beauty bloggers and readers 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.840
 from beauty blogs because when I get a look 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.610
 I can do it exactly 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.150
 tell which color i have where 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.980
 used 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.980
 I am now going to show swatches 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:37.340
 the pigmentation is as you can see really 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:38.269
 really good and the colors are really one 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.340
 bit 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:41.599
 metallic and logical idea is natural 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.150
 also the mixed metals palette 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:45.260
 metallic colors with metallic names 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.000
 I have made it two looks that 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.340
 I have taken a photo before 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.930
 used and what is striking is that on the 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:54.049
 the colors look really good 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:58.189
 pigmented and that they are unwise 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:04:00.349
 easy blend really they blend really 

00:03:58.189 --> 00:04:03.139
 well I can not superlative 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:04.159
 consider how fine they blend and remain 

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:05.959
 in combination with an eye shadow base 

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:07.790
 really sit all day but one 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:09.409
 use eye shadow base without going 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.359
 are in the lines but that is real 

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:12.650
 with the most expensive eye shadow as well 

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:14.120
 and what I had just forgotten to 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:15.739
 so it is also a very beautiful one 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.150
 highlighter in and I miss highlighters 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:18.620
 very often in palettes and this one 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.139
 highlighter can do great under you 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:23.210
 use eyebrow bone or your inner self 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:26.060
 corners of the eye and that often makes a look 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.919
 just finish and that is really here 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.050
 and well i can tell a very long story 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:31.310
 go tell but actually is mine 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.440
 conclusion that it is an incredibly beautiful 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:36.620
 palette is where you have very many sides 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:38.830
 it can on both cool and warm both 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:41.210
 colorful as less colorful and 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:44.270
 handy easy to take along the price 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:47.120
 is great 1750 sent palette and that is 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:48.620
 really not expensive and no you can immediately 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.139
 order beautiful brushes at zoeva 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.430
 if you don't have it yet 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:53.960
 disadvantages I think it is 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.460
 palette of cardboard that is none 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.500
 mirror in it 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.849
 but yes on the other hand I use 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.050
 not very often mirrors in palettes 

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:01.490
 sit but for the road I find it 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.570
 a handy travel tool 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.400
 and here had a very nice big one 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:05.659
 mirror in but yes if you then 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.889
 again 2 euros had been more expensive 

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:10.760
 then it is actually necessary for me again 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:13.340
 not and actually that is it and yes the 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:16.770
 also you would be slightly soft 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:19.380
 crumbly side 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:21.450
 but really whole if I really need something 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:23.790
 Then call it that it was mine 

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:25.440
 review of the zoeva mixed metals 

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:27.000
 Palette Kopietje remained nice to see 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.830
 to do it once 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.680
