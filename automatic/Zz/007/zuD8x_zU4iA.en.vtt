00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.680
 the summer arrived and the time also arrived 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.680
 to rest 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.690
 we open the second season from the 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.890
 Alhambra de Granada and today we say goodbye 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.430
 from Tibidabo Park 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.430
 Barcelona 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.780
 this year we have broadcast more than 50 videos 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.210
 with sweet and salty recipes with 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.970
 bloggers and chefs invited and with the 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.600
 newness of the bakers without them I'm 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.730
 sure that this channel would not be the same 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.960
 from September we will return to the 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.960
 career with many more contents 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.890

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.540

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.740
 any corner of the world 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.820
 to dismiss the season I leave you with 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:30.610
 a typical summer recipe the apple 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.470
 candy or fair of very simple 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.740
 make it irresistible for the most 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.740
 sweet 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.329
 we prepare the candy in a saucepan 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.630
 we throw the sugar the water and the syrup of 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.630
 corn 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.230
 we add the red dye me in this 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.910
 case used gel dye the 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:05.010
 amount will depend on the intensity that 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:07.110
 you want to get us to boil 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.750
 high fire and then let it boil 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.370
 medium-high fire we make a small 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.990
 cut in the apples to be able 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.990
 introduce the stick more easily 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.840
 we will need a thermometer to 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.840
 control the temperature 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:30.760
 we put together a vegetable paper with 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.760
 unsalted butter 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.980
 the thermometer has to reach 150 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.580
 degrees centigrade or its equivalent of 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.620
 300 degrees fahrenheit 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.790
 reaching that temperature will take us 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.790
 about 20 minutes 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:58.030
 we go slightly apples and 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.500
 we let dry on top of vegetable paper the 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.230
 Candy layer should not be too 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.480
 thick are as rich or more than those of 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.010
 the fairs take into account that it is very 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.120
 important to buy apples that are 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.340
 well rich 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.890
 I have used the fuji type and they were 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:15.150
 great what we said we'll see you in 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.150
 september a kissing
