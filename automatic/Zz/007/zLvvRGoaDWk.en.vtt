00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
bands as you guys can see and honestly I

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.219 
bands as you guys can see and honestly I
really<00:01:05.189> don't<00:01:05.400> need<00:01:05.729> them<00:01:06.000> for<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:07.049> weight

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
really don't need them for the weight

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.020 
really don't need them for the weight
that<00:01:07.439> I'm<00:01:07.530> working<00:01:07.710> with<00:01:07.920> but<00:01:08.610> there<00:01:08.909> was

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
that I'm working with but there was

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.520 
that I'm working with but there was
something<00:01:09.270> that<00:01:09.420> I<00:01:09.570> eventually<00:01:10.110> wanted<00:01:10.439> to

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
something that I eventually wanted to

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.460 
something that I eventually wanted to
invest<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.070> money<00:01:11.100> into<00:01:11.670> just<00:01:12.479> for<00:01:12.930> d<00:01:13.200> health

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
invest the money into just for d health

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.370 
invest the money into just for d health
and<00:01:13.770> just<00:01:13.950> general<00:01:14.369> longevity<00:01:14.840> so<00:01:15.840> I<00:01:15.900> figured

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
and just general longevity so I figured

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.740 
and just general longevity so I figured
with<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.770> injury<00:01:17.220> now<00:01:18.119> would<00:01:18.270> be<00:01:18.299> a<00:01:18.420> good<00:01:18.570> time

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
with the injury now would be a good time

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.690 
with the injury now would be a good time
to<00:01:18.810> buy<00:01:19.049> them<00:01:19.320> we<00:01:19.920> cut<00:01:20.070> my<00:01:20.220> knees<00:01:20.400> nice<00:01:20.670> and

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
to buy them we cut my knees nice and

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.210 
to buy them we cut my knees nice and
toasty<00:01:21.390> still<00:01:21.990> wasn't<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.320> great<00:01:22.470> workout<00:01:22.950> I

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
toasty still wasn't a great workout I

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.219 
toasty still wasn't a great workout I
ended<00:01:23.430> up<00:01:23.490> only<00:01:23.790> doing<00:01:24.180> a<00:01:24.270> four<00:01:24.509> by<00:01:24.689> five<00:01:24.900> with

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
ended up only doing a four by five with

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.050 
ended up only doing a four by five with
squats<00:01:25.619> and<00:01:25.860> then<00:01:26.009> I<00:01:26.040> did<00:01:26.280> three<00:01:26.670> sets<00:01:26.909> of
