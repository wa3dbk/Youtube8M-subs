players don't want to start them off by

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:23.750 
players don't want to start them off by
you<00:00:21.779> know<00:00:21.900> order<00:00:22.230> doesn't<00:00:22.560> like<00:00:22.890> order<00:00:23.430> from

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
you know order doesn't like order from

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.660 
you know order doesn't like order from
most<00:00:24.269> useful<00:00:24.689> to<00:00:24.900> least<00:00:25.109> just<00:00:25.500> an<00:00:25.619> order<00:00:25.949> so

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
most useful to least just an order so

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.179 
most useful to least just an order so
first<00:00:26.939> off<00:00:27.180> is<00:00:27.480> perfect<00:00:28.019> iron<00:00:28.289> body<00:00:28.529> or<00:00:28.920> more

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
first off is perfect iron body or more

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.429 
first off is perfect iron body or more
known<00:00:29.400> as<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.880> Super<00:00:30.240> Buu<00:00:30.390> card<00:00:30.689> when

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
known as the Super Buu card when

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.010 
known as the Super Buu card when
guarding<00:00:31.890> use<00:00:32.399> in<00:00:32.759> tune<00:00:33.000> all<00:00:33.180> damages<00:00:33.660> guard

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
guarding use in tune all damages guard

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.770 
guarding use in tune all damages guard
breaks<00:00:34.260> so<00:00:34.440> basically<00:00:34.710> what<00:00:34.950> this<00:00:35.130> does<00:00:35.399> is

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:35.780 
breaks so basically what this does is

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.660 
breaks so basically what this does is
when<00:00:36.780> you're<00:00:37.770> guarding<00:00:38.219> and<00:00:38.399> you're<00:00:38.520> getting

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
when you're guarding and you're getting

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.270 
when you're guarding and you're getting
attacked<00:00:38.940> it<00:00:39.690> won't<00:00:39.840> all<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.200> damage<00:00:40.559> so<00:00:40.920> you

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
attacked it won't all the damage so you

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.340 
attacked it won't all the damage so you
won't<00:00:41.579> take<00:00:41.820> as<00:00:42.000> much<00:00:42.390> as<00:00:42.629> damage<00:00:43.020> from<00:00:43.170> your

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
won't take as much as damage from your

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.200 
won't take as much as damage from your
opponent<00:00:43.800> than<00:00:43.950> you<00:00:44.070> usually<00:00:44.250> do<00:00:44.579> but<00:00:45.120> the

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
opponent than you usually do but the

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.670 
opponent than you usually do but the
downside<00:00:45.420> of<00:00:45.809> this<00:00:45.899> is<00:00:46.140> that<00:00:46.320> you're<00:00:46.440> using

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
downside of this is that you're using

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.779 
downside of this is that you're using
your<00:00:46.980> energy<00:00:47.129> up<00:00:47.579> so<00:00:49.309> it's<00:00:50.309> always<00:00:50.520> a<00:00:50.640> good

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
your energy up so it's always a good

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:51.860 
your energy up so it's always a good
thing<00:00:50.850> if<00:00:51.090> you<00:00:51.180> have<00:00:51.270> a<00:00:51.300> lot<00:00:51.449> of<00:00:51.539> energy<00:00:51.809> and

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
thing if you have a lot of energy and

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.360 
thing if you have a lot of energy and
you're<00:00:52.050> using<00:00:52.199> support<00:00:52.620> characters<00:00:53.070> and

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
you're using support characters and

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.200 
you're using support characters and
they're<00:00:53.610> giving<00:00:53.969> you<00:00:54.289> I<00:00:55.910> don't<00:00:56.910> want<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.090> say

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
they're giving you I don't want to say

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.290 
they're giving you I don't want to say
key<00:00:57.420> cut<00:00:57.750> cut<00:00:58.140> dude<00:00:58.800> they're<00:00:59.460> giving<00:00:59.730> you<00:00:59.879> key

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
key cut cut dude they're giving you key

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.299 
key cut cut dude they're giving you key
so<00:01:00.690> it<00:01:01.020> does<00:01:01.260> really<00:01:01.469> matter<00:01:01.739> if<00:01:01.980> you<00:01:02.100> have

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
so it does really matter if you have

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.009 
so it does really matter if you have
support<00:01:02.730> players<00:01:02.910> on<00:01:03.090> your<00:01:03.149> team<00:01:03.239> either<00:01:03.750> in

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
support players on your team either in

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.469 
support players on your team either in
single-player<00:01:04.559> co-op<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.700> battle<00:01:06.060> because

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
single-player co-op to battle because

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.390 
single-player co-op to battle because
you're<00:01:06.869> always<00:01:07.049> gonna<00:01:07.439> your<00:01:07.979> space<00:01:08.189> with

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
you're always gonna your space with

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.100 
you're always gonna your space with
their<00:01:10.460> next<00:01:11.460> up<00:01:11.610> we<00:01:11.790> have<00:01:11.820> fighters<00:01:12.420> pride<00:01:12.780> all

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
their next up we have fighters pride all

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.320 
their next up we have fighters pride all
abilities<00:01:13.590> are<00:01:13.740> increased<00:01:14.310> although<00:01:14.850> these

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
abilities are increased although these

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.690 
abilities are increased although these
are<00:01:15.390> up<00:01:15.570> small<00:01:16.020> so<00:01:16.350> what<00:01:16.470> this<00:01:16.650> means<00:01:16.920> is<00:01:17.310> if

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
are up small so what this means is if

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.740 
are up small so what this means is if
you<00:01:17.909> have<00:01:18.180> a<00:01:18.210> power<00:01:18.570> level<00:01:19.290> of<00:01:19.470> 2000<00:01:20.220> even<00:01:20.790> your

you have a power level of 2000 even your

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:22.999 
you have a power level of 2000 even your

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
power levels going to be increased by

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.800 
power levels going to be increased by
2200<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:24.360> then<00:01:24.479> all<00:01:24.720> of<00:01:25.080> your<00:01:26.810> categories

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
2200 and then all of your categories

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.890 
2200 and then all of your categories
like<00:01:27.960> melee<00:01:28.439> chi<00:01:28.770> blast<00:01:29.130> speed<00:01:29.659> everything<00:01:30.659> is

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
like melee chi blast speed everything is

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.260 
like melee chi blast speed everything is
going<00:01:31.079> to<00:01:31.170> be<00:01:31.259> increased<00:01:31.829> by<00:01:32.369> a<00:01:32.790> little<00:01:33.150> bit

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
going to be increased by a little bit

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.179 
going to be increased by a little bit
but<00:01:33.450> it's<00:01:33.600> actually<00:01:34.229> it<00:01:34.439> actually<00:01:34.530> helps<00:01:34.979> when

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189

I've<00:01:51.030> only<00:01:51.149> heard<00:01:51.479> of<00:01:51.570> it<00:01:51.750> and<00:01:51.960> I<00:01:52.049> really<00:01:52.079> don't

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
I've only heard of it and I really don't

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.069 
I've only heard of it and I really don't
think<00:01:52.680> it's<00:01:53.100> true<00:01:53.399> next<00:01:54.270> time<00:01:54.390> we<00:01:54.509> have<00:01:54.630> Saiyan

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
think it's true next time we have Saiyan

power<00:01:55.229> all<00:01:55.590> abilities<00:01:56.280> are<00:01:56.430> increased<00:01:56.759> for

power all abilities are increased for

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.719 
power all abilities are increased for
every<00:01:57.299> knockdown<00:01:57.810> so<00:01:58.380> what<00:01:58.530> this<00:01:58.680> does<00:01:58.950> is<00:01:59.369> if

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
every knockdown so what this does is if

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.310 
every knockdown so what this does is if
you're<00:01:59.909> not<00:02:00.119> doing<00:02:00.600> very<00:02:00.630> good<00:02:00.899> in<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.170> game

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
you're not doing very good in the game

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.590 
you're not doing very good in the game
and<00:02:01.680> you<00:02:01.829> have<00:02:02.040> let's<00:02:02.369> say<00:02:02.610> four<00:02:02.969> knockdown<00:02:03.360> so

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
and you have let's say four knockdown so

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.209 
and you have let's say four knockdown so
far<00:02:03.840> your<00:02:04.380> abilities<00:02:04.799> are<00:02:04.950> gonna<00:02:05.040> keep

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
far your abilities are gonna keep

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.410 
far your abilities are gonna keep
getting<00:02:05.430> stronger<00:02:05.729> and<00:02:05.939> stronger<00:02:06.180> and

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
getting stronger and stronger and

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.359 
getting stronger and stronger and
stronger<00:02:06.600> over<00:02:07.110> time<00:02:07.140> so<00:02:07.619> this<00:02:07.770> is<00:02:07.920> very<00:02:08.190> very

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
stronger over time so this is very very

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.339 
stronger over time so this is very very
useful

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:09.349

we have energy absorption system a which
is<00:02:58.110> basically<00:02:58.440> like<00:02:58.709> system<00:02:59.459> B<00:02:59.640> but<00:03:00.000> this<00:03:00.209> is

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
is basically like system B but this is

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:01.940 
is basically like system B but this is
for<00:03:00.569> your<00:03:00.720> melee<00:03:01.049> attack<00:03:01.380> so<00:03:01.650> if<00:03:01.739> you<00:03:01.829> are

Vegeta you're basically just gonna keep
absorbing<00:03:22.109> energy<00:03:22.500> so<00:03:23.220> those<00:03:24.030> are<00:03:24.239> always

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
absorbing energy so those are always

absorbing energy so those are always
useful<00:03:24.959> I<00:03:25.470> think<00:03:26.459> those<00:03:26.760> are<00:03:26.880> the<00:03:26.910> most<00:03:27.090> useful

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
useful I think those are the most useful

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.120 
useful I think those are the most useful
cards<00:03:27.720> that<00:03:27.870> you<00:03:27.930> can<00:03:28.049> use<00:03:28.230> so<00:03:28.470> far<00:03:28.680> up-to-date
