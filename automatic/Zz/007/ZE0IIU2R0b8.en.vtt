00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.020
 a bridge in everyday speech is called tight 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.330
 planted denture 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.000
 when the crown is worn at least 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.849
 for two teeth between which there are still 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 intermediate elements top left 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.550
 in the corner you see a 3 element bridge and a hundred in 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.920
 In this case , gold on 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.939
 illustrations in the center you see as 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.800
 bridge assistance 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.090
 void in place closes 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.720
 missing tooth 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.699
 below is a bridge prosthesis with an external 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.289
 parties 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:32.759
 dental prosthetics develops in 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.910
 the direction of creation is increasingly 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.129
 natural designs so present 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.079
 time gaps in the dentition increasingly 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.230
 closes with artificial 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.390
 root implants use dental 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.480
 blocks as a classic bridge prosthesis 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.879
 less and less becomes necessary except 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.309
 moreover, thanks to the implant can be removed 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.079
 perry load with abutment teeth which 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.719
 may occur with classic 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.699
 bridge prostheses despite all this 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.359
 There are still cases when 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:05.100
 Staged bridge prosthesis is shown 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:07.920
 there are big differences in technique 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.950
 making bridges so some 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:15.390
 bridges held for 30 years or more 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:18.710
 and others only a couple of years it all starts with 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.600
 the doctor prepares a tooth stump 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:24.060
 very fast and easy way at point 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.119
 the so-called tangential vol. 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.670
 just make up the lack of it 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.799
 option at the point is that 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.530
 dental technician in the manufacture of the bridge 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:37.110
 should leave a place on the edges of the bridge for 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.740
 ceramics because otherwise ceramics can 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.049
 break 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.479
 the result is bloated 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.280
 protruding edges to their 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.950
 hide border turning will 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.229
 transferred to the dental gums 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.540
 an umbrella or dental floss stuck when 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.030
 such lands therefore will 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.719
 stuck and leftover food this species 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:00.119
 turning leads to gum disease 

00:01:56.719 --> 00:02:03.299
 over the years due to persistent inflammation 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:05.479
 the gums descend the edges of the bridge become 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:08.459
 visible as in the image 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:09.770
 root caries threat significantly 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.320
 is increasing 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:15.010
 unfortunately tangential of . most 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:17.600
 frequently used type of turning 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.480
 other commonly used species in 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:23.060
 point is the so-called about. with 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.610
 the ledge here is a dental technician has 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.610
 enough space to hide 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.500
 Terraniki edges are unfortunately used and 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.810
 when cementing means not very 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.420
 flows well over it is formed 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.980
 wide glue line 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.200
 the danger that over time the adhesives 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.510
 substances most often cement will 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:45.650
 wash out for example when brushing your teeth and 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:48.020
 root decay will appear very large at 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.150
 tooth grooving with a notch avoids 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:53.270
 disadvantages of other types of turning 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.950
 while maintaining their benefits however 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.030
 this species and at the point is the most 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.980
 laborious 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.650
 cementing agent 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:03.230
 flows well therefore the seam will be 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.480
 the minimum for a dental technician remains 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:08.240
 enough space for ceramic mass 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.880
 end of ceramics sealed 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:13.460
 leave food that way do not get stuck 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.830
 when carrying out turning with dredging 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:18.560
 need to work in binocular glasses 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:20.270
 and when removing the impression of teeth should 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.030
 meet certain criteria 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:25.870
 this method is very laborious but he and 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:28.730
 guarantees you the best quality 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.890
 however, not only accurate. tooth and 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:34.040
 optimal bridge fabrication method 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:36.320
 determine its quality getting the bridge 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.320
 really good quality depends 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:41.209
 from a lot of intermediate steps 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:43.930
 for example before making these teeth 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:45.920
 the patient must impose two threads 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.550
 one of which is removed 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:51.260
 just before taking the print 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:53.930
 why impose precisely two threads with 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:56.720
 one side when turning the tooth crown 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:59.030
 must be protected against damage to the gum 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.130
 the other side of the turning boundary should 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:04.190
 be placed in the so-called sulcus 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:06.830
 that is, under the gum edge passing point 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:08.570
 gum is pushed aside with 1 thread 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:12.200
 prevent damage to the gums when 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:15.110
 tooth grinding is good but why 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:17.450
 at the same time two threads you see an impression 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:20.060
 teeth that dental technician floods 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:21.940
 gypsum thus obtaining state 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.610
 your mouth on a plaster model 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.770
 on it, he later will make your dental 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:29.380
 prosthesis that must be sealed 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.420
 close up at the edges for this dental 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:34.180
 the technician must clearly distinguish the boundaries 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:36.430
 when on the radio and that means that the material 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.640
 used when removing tesco should 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:41.950
 drain to the very edge of the turning 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:45.490
 overlaying 2 strands gum more 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:46.210
 times when removing 2 threads directly 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.550
 before removing 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:51.460
 impression material used is fine 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.890
 copies the shape of the border at point to 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:55.510
 animated video you see 

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:56.110
 office filled with impression material 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:59.140
 a spoon 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:01.030
 which is worn on the tooth stump on 

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:02.560
 the image on the right was the work 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:05.080
 using children 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.950
 imprint on i optic mass in borders 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.080
 reparations 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:11.020
 which thanks to this became good 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:13.810
 discernible on the left you see what happens 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:16.750
 if the removal of the print is carried out without 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:19.210
 overlay filament print does not match 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:21.310
 preparation of the tooth stump material 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:23.100
 used to get an impression not 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:25.570
 erased to the limits when on the radio 

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:28.240
 hence the dental technician himself is not 

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:30.820
 suspecting you make a defective bridge 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.440
 can be called other factors from 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:33.640
 which depends on manufacturing 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:36.250
 quality bridge 

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:38.770
 however, the already mentioned differences in the way 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:41.650
 the work helps to understand why 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:44.490
 prices are so different good bridge not 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:47.230
 will cause inflammation or subsidence of the gums 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:48.280
 good bridge is invisible and it holds 

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:50.410
 many years 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:53.230
 even if it later becomes necessary 

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:56.520
 replace the bridge itself with the cult of the teeth beneath it 

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:56.520
 is in good condition
