00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.850
 a plant that aching without wifi the 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:09.290
 I guess he told me his secret that you were 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.290
 super chinese mobile 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:17.650
 If I do not call you everything we can start 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:20.470
 unpack because I have an illusion 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:23.680
 very big because I have frame had 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:26.620
 seen my video that the iphone 5 s is 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.300
 I had doubled and they sent me this 

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:30.520
 phone to make me bio 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.500
 while you have it in repair that 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.980
 I'm still waiting for you to pick it up and 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:39.309
 it is a green g550 phone and 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.449
 I tried it with you because I 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:42.340
 illusions are your illusions 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:44.440
 your illusions are my illusions 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.540
 because for that we are a united channel or 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.060
 do not 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:51.690
 let's see what is in the box 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:56.790
 and with a protective envelope 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:01:00.080
 screen and let's see what we have for 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:03.989
 here the headphones with microphone 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:06.390
 integrated the charger gÃ¼ey a battery 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.280
 let me be surprised but I come 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.530
 already used in that the mobiles 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.300
 come the integrated battery and me 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.070
 it seems that this is really something 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.870
 positive because I'm fed up with 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.180
 see how the mobiles break the 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:20.310
 battery and you have to carry the terminal 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.930
 completely to be replaced and 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.570
 when you have it loose then you can 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.550
 directly buy a new one and put it 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:31.110
 and you do not have to carry the phone is 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:36.330
 complete and techno spelling cards 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:39.119
 techno space the instructions all that 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.860
 the first thing that came up was what we see 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.509
 the instructions are in many 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.149
 languages so we do not have to 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.200
 learn mandarin chinese 2 years of 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:51.880
 guarantee the whole show 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:53.890
 of technical service is done in Spain 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.750
 you have to send the phone to the Chinese 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.390
 a Chinese phone picks you up or anything 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.460
 this what I'm going to put 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.140
 the battery not to command such a chest 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:06.280
 I'm supposed to catch 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:09.369
 this capital if we throw in theory there is and 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:13.200
 we have removed the cap, I will put the 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:17.110
 today I fall down, do not suffer 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:23.810
 colocadito I'll put your tapita with 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:26.380
 very careful and we will light 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.380
 today 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:32.950
 as well as simple music 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.689
 is that this phone is very premium and 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.230
 let's get to know him better 

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:41.829
 first of all the touch that has to be 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.510
 awesome super silky a blast of 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:45.670
 all the technical characteristics to 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.939
 highlight for me are the microprocessor 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:52.959
 with 8 cores and the megapixels that 

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:55.959
 they have front and rear camera what 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:58.030
 we start up and we see that it has 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:01.150
 One side upper left button to 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:05.650
 right button volume control 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:08.590
 top for locking and unlocking and 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:12.099
 then we have the lower keypad where 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:14.769
 we have the configuration menu on 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:17.439
 home button with which we can 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:20.379
 always return back to the screen 

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:22.450
 main and the cam button that this does not 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:24.400
 I need to explain that only 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.409
 Go back well, I've been there 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.709
 gossiping is throwing my games 

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:31.659
 to the angry birds epic but now I'm not going to 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:35.030
 enter with the player that this one I'm going to 

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:38.090
 teach what it looks like 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:40.950
 it went pretty thin 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:43.079
 main characteristics what has 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.569
 liked is that on the one hand the icons do not 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:46.470
 they are the ones that are normally 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:48.930
 used and do not seem at all 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:51.000
 ugly on the other hand that level 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.010
 applications come to us with the jousts 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.349
 for what is appreciated and we still 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.150
 Entertain in customizing to your liking of 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:04:00.000
 I'm going to show a little when 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:02.159
 we leave the finger pressed on the screen 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.450
 we can go to configure our 

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:11.069
 funds and I'm going to put an animated background 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:14.519
 this for example goes quite well another 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:17.970
 thing I really like the camera has 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:20.310
 to make bursts on video has a 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.979
 lots of little things for photography in 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.780
 Directly beautify the face so that it does not 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:27.539
 you see us the wrinkles is that we 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:30.360
 they give so much courage or continuous shooting 

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:32.460
 good image size a lot of 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:36.210
 little things inside the settings we counted 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:38.130
 with the typical ones in android on the menu 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.050
 of notifications exactly the same 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.070
 in which we have already been 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.669
 accustomed 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:49.099
 let's test how it actually navigates 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:49.099
 let's try here to give a video 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.240
 you see 

00:04:54.450 --> 00:05:00.970
 superbly another little thing the led button 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:03.070
 home has double function when 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:05.170
 let's press it brings us to the part 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:07.870
 multitasking where we can see the 

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:10.810
 applications that are running and 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:12.550
 we can eliminate them I've missed 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:15.590
 there is not an option to erase everything to 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:18.470
 the time is very fluid 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:21.160
 here we can see it sailing among the 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:21.160
 different results 

00:05:21.569 --> 00:05:26.490
 the only thing that I see him towards 

00:05:24.179 --> 00:05:30.469
 telephone miss 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:34.589
 4g does not have for 4g networks otherwise 

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:41.119
 the value for money very very well 

00:05:34.589 --> 00:05:45.979
 subscribe a little bit from Spain or 

00:05:41.119 --> 00:05:45.979
 little dream 

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:52.949
 this was moving 

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:56.029
 I will die if he is not smart in 

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:56.029
 some thanks to you 

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:03.789
 a cache 

00:06:00.789 --> 00:06:03.789
 efe 

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:07.240
 until next time
