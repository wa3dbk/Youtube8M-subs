connecting to the server gonna want to

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.990 
connecting to the server gonna want to
register<00:00:45.239> as<00:00:45.390> an<00:00:45.510> agent<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:46.340> the<00:00:47.340> key<00:00:47.550> here<00:00:47.579> is

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
register as an agent and the key here is

that you want to type in your name as
your<00:00:51.090> school's<00:00:51.600> zip<00:00:52.079> code<00:00:52.320> that<00:00:52.590> way<00:00:52.910> uplink

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
your school's zip code that way uplink

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.779 
your school's zip code that way uplink
knows<00:00:54.300> which<00:00:54.600> mainframe<00:00:55.199> to<00:00:55.410> connect<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:55.890> so

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
knows which mainframe to connect to so

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.090 
knows which mainframe to connect to so
let's<00:00:57.270> say<00:00:57.480> your<00:00:57.660> school's<00:00:57.960> mainframe<00:00:58.620> I<00:00:58.890> mean

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
let's say your school's mainframe I mean

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:08.929 
let's say your school's mainframe I mean
zip<00:00:59.489> code<00:00:59.730> is<00:01:00.559> like<00:01:02.449> 975<00:01:03.449> so<00:01:05.659> 975<00:01:06.950> 975<00:01:07.950> for<00:01:08.790> both

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
zip code is like 975 so 975 975 for both

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.130 
zip code is like 975 so 975 975 for both
the<00:01:09.090> username<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.810> password<00:01:11.210> done<00:01:12.210> now

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
the username and password done now

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.289 
the username and password done now
you're<00:01:13.439> going<00:01:13.680> to<00:01:13.770> select<00:01:13.950> a<00:01:14.159> gateway<00:01:14.400> that's

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
you're going to select a gateway that's

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.120 
you're going to select a gateway that's
closest<00:01:15.869> to<00:01:15.990> your<00:01:16.110> school<00:01:16.439> so<00:01:16.740> you<00:01:16.799> got<00:01:16.979> like

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
closest to your school so you got like

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.640 
closest to your school so you got like
London<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:18.060> England<00:01:18.479> ela<00:01:19.049> Moscow<00:01:19.500> and

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
London and England ela Moscow and

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.020 
London and England ela Moscow and
Ukraine<00:01:20.119> so<00:01:21.119> let's<00:01:21.990> select<00:01:22.170> New<00:01:22.470> York

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
Ukraine so let's select New York

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:29.320 
Ukraine so let's select New York
pretending<00:01:24.030> my<00:01:24.150> school's<00:01:24.479> closest<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.110> that

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:29.330 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.300

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
alright so now we are connecting to our

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.220 
alright so now we are connecting to our
hacking<00:01:31.880> system<00:01:32.120> and<00:01:32.570> downloading<00:01:33.020> some

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:33.230 
hacking system and downloading some

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.250 
hacking system and downloading some
packages<00:01:33.800> here<00:01:34.130> or<00:01:34.790> hackage<00:01:35.420> 'as<00:01:35.630> you<00:01:36.080> could

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.080 
packages here or hackage 'as you could
say<00:01:36.500> should<00:01:37.100> be<00:01:37.220> up<00:01:37.310> and<00:01:37.430> running<00:01:37.550> shortly

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
say should be up and running shortly

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.700 
say should be up and running shortly
we're<00:01:38.330> booting<00:01:38.600> up<00:01:38.660> our<00:01:38.840> hardware<00:01:41.500> alright<00:01:42.500> so

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
we're booting up our hardware alright so

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.050 
we're booting up our hardware alright so
as<00:01:42.800> you<00:01:42.890> can<00:01:42.950> see<00:01:43.010> we<00:01:43.340> have<00:01:43.490> our<00:01:43.520> hacking

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
as you can see we have our hacking

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.000 
as you can see we have our hacking
gateway<00:01:44.360> running<00:01:44.750> now<00:01:45.470> the<00:01:45.530> first<00:01:45.800> thing<00:01:45.920> you

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:46.010 
gateway running now the first thing you

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.430 
gateway running now the first thing you
want<00:01:46.160> to<00:01:46.190> do<00:01:46.340> is<00:01:46.640> hit<00:01:46.970> the<00:01:47.180> second<00:01:47.990> link<00:01:48.140> here

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440 
want to do is hit the second link here

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:49.950 
want to do is hit the second link here
this<00:01:48.620> is<00:01:48.710> going<00:01:48.860> to<00:01:49.040> connect<00:01:49.310> you<00:01:49.400> to<00:01:49.430> the

this is going to connect you to the

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.310 
this is going to connect you to the
hacking<00:01:50.960> mainframe<00:01:52.540> to<00:01:53.540> proceed<00:01:53.870> there<00:01:54.110> and

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
hacking mainframe to proceed there and

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:55.420 
hacking mainframe to proceed there and
you're<00:01:54.440> going<00:01:54.650> to<00:01:54.680> want<00:01:54.860> to<00:01:54.950> download<00:01:55.100> some

mainframe and hit connect hit start the

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.560 
mainframe and hit connect hit start the
test

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 
test

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.930

alright now you are connected to your
school's<00:02:47.209> mainframe<00:02:47.720> and<00:02:47.959> this<00:02:48.230> is<00:02:48.440> their

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
school's mainframe and this is their

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:51.550 
school's mainframe and this is their
login<00:02:49.220> that<00:02:49.940> is<00:02:50.090> shown<00:02:50.330> on<00:02:50.360> the<00:02:50.630> GUI<00:02:50.870> for<00:02:51.260> you<00:02:51.410> a

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
graphical representation so you're going

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.880 
graphical representation so you're going
to<00:02:54.290> you're<00:02:54.860> going<00:02:54.890> to<00:02:55.010> go<00:02:55.190> down<00:02:55.370> here<00:02:55.730> and

also going to select password breaker

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.229 
also going to select password breaker
and<00:03:05.410> click<00:03:06.410> on<00:03:06.590> code<00:03:06.950> so<00:03:07.880> as<00:03:07.910> you<00:03:08.090> can<00:03:08.180> see

and click on code so as you can see

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:10.479 
and click on code so as you can see
right<00:03:08.660> now<00:03:08.810> we<00:03:08.870> are<00:03:09.170> cracking<00:03:09.950> the<00:03:10.040> password

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
right now we are cracking the password

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:15.160 
right now we are cracking the password
to<00:03:10.760> our<00:03:10.790> school's<00:03:11.270> mainframe<00:03:13.630> it's<00:03:14.630> using<00:03:15.050> a

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
to our school's mainframe it's using a

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:20.470 
to our school's mainframe it's using a
advanced<00:03:16.010> dual<00:03:16.400> network<00:03:16.700> matrix<00:03:17.630> to<00:03:17.840> do<00:03:17.959> this

all<00:03:20.930> right<00:03:21.050> so<00:03:21.170> our<00:03:21.230> passwords<00:03:21.709> rosebud<00:03:22.220> let's

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
all right so our passwords rosebud let's

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.680 
all right so our passwords rosebud let's
proceed

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
proceed

this is going on and you could do this

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
to hack pretty much any school you just

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:36.850 
to hack pretty much any school you just
have<00:04:35.900> to<00:04:36.020> have<00:04:36.110> the<00:04:36.230> zip<00:04:36.410> code

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
have to have the zip code

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.850 
have to have the zip code
it's<00:04:37.669> a<00:04:37.820> rare<00:04:38.240> exploit<00:04:38.780> and<00:04:39.020> this<00:04:39.500> hacking

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 
it's a rare exploit and this hacking

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:45.090 
it's a rare exploit and this hacking
tool<00:04:39.889> is<00:04:40.130> pretty<00:04:40.370> new<00:04:40.790> and<00:04:41.030> uh<00:04:41.770> oh<00:04:43.600> shit<00:04:44.600> oh

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.100 
tool is pretty new and uh oh shit oh

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:55.030 
tool is pretty new and uh oh shit oh
shit

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.040 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.070 

Oh
