00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
can start stuffing it the reason why I

can start stuffing it the reason why I
chose<00:04:05.020> stuffing<00:04:05.470> is<00:04:05.590> just<00:04:05.740> because<00:04:05.920> it's<00:04:06.070> a

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:06.100 
chose stuffing is just because it's a

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:10.290 
chose stuffing is just because it's a
lot<00:04:06.250> softer<00:04:06.580> to<00:04:07.180> lay<00:04:07.330> on<00:04:07.510> a<00:04:08.970> pillow<00:04:09.970> form

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:10.300 
lot softer to lay on a pillow form

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.320 
lot softer to lay on a pillow form
obviously<00:04:11.050> will<00:04:11.230> have<00:04:11.260> more<00:04:11.710> structure<00:04:12.330> so

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:13.330 
obviously will have more structure so

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.120 
obviously will have more structure so
