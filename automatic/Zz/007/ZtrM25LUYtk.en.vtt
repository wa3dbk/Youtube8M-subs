this video demonstrates our new app the

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.110 
this video demonstrates our new app the
engine<00:00:03.240> tester<00:00:03.859> this<00:00:04.859> app<00:00:05.069> allows<00:00:05.370> the<00:00:05.879> user

let's begin the demonstration here we
see<00:00:16.830> Patrick<00:00:17.369> the<00:00:17.730> mechanic<00:00:18.300> who<00:00:18.449> introduced

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
see Patrick the mechanic who introduced

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.830 
see Patrick the mechanic who introduced
this<00:00:19.320> concept<00:00:19.640> using<00:00:20.640> the<00:00:20.880> app<00:00:21.029> to<00:00:21.359> test<00:00:21.660> a

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
this concept using the app to test a

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.310 
this concept using the app to test a
healthy<00:00:22.170> vehicle<00:00:23.240> first<00:00:24.240> he<00:00:24.570> enters<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:24.990> car

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
healthy vehicle first he enters the car

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.609 
healthy vehicle first he enters the car
details<00:00:25.800> into<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.460> app<00:00:26.609> even<00:00:27.510> proceeds<00:00:28.230> to

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
details into the app even proceeds to

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.919 
details into the app even proceeds to
use<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.980> app<00:00:29.130> to<00:00:29.369> analyze<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.090> sound<00:00:30.359> emitted

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
use the app to analyze the sound emitted

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:37.590 
use the app to analyze the sound emitted
from<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.199> exhaust

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:37.600 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.290 

we<00:00:38.230> now<00:00:38.440> see<00:00:38.680> they<00:00:38.829> are<00:00:38.859> reporting<00:00:39.699> a<00:00:39.820> positive

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300 
we now see they are reporting a positive

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.440 
we now see they are reporting a positive
result<00:00:40.690> indicating<00:00:41.440> a<00:00:41.559> healthy<00:00:41.890> engine

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:44.450 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:46.780 

Patrick<00:00:45.020> will<00:00:45.200> now<00:00:45.290> introduce<00:00:45.710> a<00:00:46.130> fault<00:00:46.460> into

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:46.790 
Patrick will now introduce a fault into

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.120 
Patrick will now introduce a fault into
the<00:00:46.910> engine<00:00:47.240> so<00:00:47.720> we<00:00:47.840> can<00:00:48.020> test<00:00:48.230> an<00:00:48.470> unhealthy

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:49.130 
the engine so we can test an unhealthy

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:56.280 
the engine so we can test an unhealthy
vehicle

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:56.290 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.300 

you

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:00.310 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:02.610 

you<00:01:00.850> will<00:01:01.000> now<00:01:01.120> begin<00:01:01.360> testing<00:01:01.960> the<00:01:02.080> unhealthy

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:02.620 
you will now begin testing the unhealthy

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.600 
you will now begin testing the unhealthy
vehicle<00:01:03.010> so<00:01:03.250> we<00:01:03.370> can<00:01:03.490> see<00:01:03.640> the<00:01:03.790> result

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.180 

the<00:01:08.120> app<00:01:08.300> is<00:01:08.510> recording<00:01:09.110> a<00:01:09.260> 10-second<00:01:09.920> sound

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:10.190 
the app is recording a 10-second sound

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:15.070 
the app is recording a 10-second sound
clip<00:01:10.370> and<00:01:10.610> analyzing<00:01:11.240> the<00:01:11.330> results

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.380 

and<00:01:15.170> there<00:01:15.830> we<00:01:15.980> have<00:01:16.010> it<00:01:16.190> a<00:01:16.460> negative<00:01:16.940> result

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
and there we have it a negative result

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.870 
and there we have it a negative result
indicating<00:01:18.380> a<00:01:18.530> faulty<00:01:18.890> engine<00:01:19.250> the<00:01:19.850> engine

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
indicating a faulty engine the engine

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.960 
indicating a faulty engine the engine
tester<00:01:20.810> also<00:01:21.350> includes<00:01:21.770> a<00:01:21.950> useful<00:01:22.460> checklist

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970
