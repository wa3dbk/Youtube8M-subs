00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:13.120
 very good everyone I'm beautifully 10 and 

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:16.209
 today I bring you a new video showing 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:20.320
 a new hack they have taken out for the 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:23.320
 version 1.13 of targets 2 and well this 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.590
 new tool what brings again respect 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.509
 to the previous ones is that they have added 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.730
 logically the map of buried and good 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:32.380
 It has a pretty enough function 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.810
 curious that is to teleport us 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:38.739
 off the map and two or three more sites 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:41.350
 of all the maps is worth and good had 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:44.500
 touched here the super speed I'm going to 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.420
 pay ok it's all right and good 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.030
 let's go see what this new 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.850
 menu as you know I have the play in 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.890
 format decks is worth so good is a 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:57.160
 tour for those of you who have format decks 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:01:01.570
 you can find this tool on a skin 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:03.310
 update the english page is worth and good what 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.170
 that basically brings in the same as 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:06.970
 others are worth it but with this new function 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.350
 that now I will show here you see me 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.930
 I put some way they can not kill me anymore 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.960
 the zombies also have to put us 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.760
 maximum points 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.530
 good brings here also the 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.010
 invisible and others that I'm not going to touch 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.619
 it's worth touching statistics and 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.240
 well also brings the weapons menu yo 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.060
 I'll put it for the map of buried us 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.100
 let select the map we want and 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:33.960
 well I can start 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:36.899
 ELSTAT rooted not worth the I 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.880
 I put the rooting with maximum ammunition 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:41.470
 we can also put it here you can see 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.480
 that I can shoot everything I want 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:47.950
 of secondary school we have the option of 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:50.890
 get the csr improved I'm going to 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:54.910
 change so you can see the revolver 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:58.480
 new the sassafras and here you have it 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:02:00.400
 and the stunner good as you see me 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:03.460
 I can put practically the best 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:06.130
 weapons of this on the new map 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.140
 the tuta while and as I say for the 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.030
 other maps that exist of zombies what 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.000
 what happens that today we are going to analyze this 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:17.170
 of buried that is new in which 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.940
 interesting and good we go with the new 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.670
 paragraph that they have added that is the 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.560
 teleporting us from the map gave us 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.180
 very few options in four places 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.319
 different but well worth it 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.079
 see him 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:30.609
 brings an option that does not notice yet 

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:31.719
 which is so that the barriers of 

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:33.840
 death do not kill us 

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:36.280
 this is also pretty good since 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.769
 when we left the map they killed us 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.450
 the barriers of death already with this 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:43.329
 new option will not kill us I have it 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.450
 I activated and well I'm going to 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:51.189
 teleport for example alpaca punch 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:53.000
 worth a jiffy to put this applies not 

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:58.150
 it was put in buried 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.150
 for the pac a punch as I said ok 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:04.450
 You also have the option to send us 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:06.390
 the cell of eloy as you are seeing here 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.819
 OK 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.740
 to the 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:14.020
 power 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:17.060
 to the electricity of the map and also 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:19.040
 off the map here outside the window 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.600
 have these four new options me 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.610
 I hope they keep putting more options 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.740
 here we can leave the map where 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:27.560
 we want for this whole area logically 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:29.270
 or fall off the map and good too 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.130
 we can teleport to classmates 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:33.230
 the only thing that I did not find any 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.210
 debut for zombie multiplayer that 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:38.000
 they do not go in by instantly connecting 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:40.910
 they go in the account and I had to 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.040
 record in single mode voucher 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:45.770
 well this is basically what has 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:48.740
 what this new has this new tur 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:51.760
 it also brings about the change in name 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:54.970
 to all players in the game 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:57.489
 touch us statistics and good what 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:01.569
 typical that this brings these super shifts 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:03.969
 speed super gravity super jump 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:07.450
 good to tell you the name of the blue that is 

00:04:03.969 --> 00:04:12.099
 the one of shock name version 3.3 for the 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:13.900
 1.13 you have it in hangu is worth it and nothing else 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:16.600
 I hope you liked this new
