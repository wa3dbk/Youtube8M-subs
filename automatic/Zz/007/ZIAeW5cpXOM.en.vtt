00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 who goes on the ice falls 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:05.190
 also go there 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.740
 with what difficulties our 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:24.180
 Ice skater Lara has to fight this 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:26.300
 you are now experiencing the unsafe 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.300
 location 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.340
 my name is lara villa i am 17 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:44.180
 years old and figure skater visitor 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.370
 the eleventh grade and was last year 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.110
 third among the Germans 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.899
 championships then have the cup 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:54.470
 won at the end of the season in berlin 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:01:00.559
 has become the most and that is called 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:01:03.559
 unfortunately I do not think last season unfortunately 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:04.519
 that is optimal and thus promotes 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:08.360
 will run 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:10.580
 I know because somehow I think so there 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.840
 my god did not succeed with me 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.729
 my long leg so one 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.970
 Ice skater is so rather then 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:20.530
 a little bit shorter and there I stand like 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.530
 Although you yourself a bit in the way 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.950
 but I really want mine 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.720
 personal limits come and think 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.330
 I have that one more two four 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.790
 I still can not jump that 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.020
 maybe still in there and that then 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.869
 also sometime in 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.729
 Competitive situations occur where you 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:42.080
 say okay I gave everything and it 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:43.820
 Everything is 100 percent off because I 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.530
 Did not experience the moment when I got it 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.740
 let it be and it should still be 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.740
 come 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.950
 I think figure skating is too 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.720
 somehow is not only sport but 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.940
 So it actually shapes people too 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.229
 so do not team because I think we are like that 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.670
 a special game thinks 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:04.789
 probably every sport 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.750
 that she is healthy or that the 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:08.000
 are different 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.500
 but I think that my sport 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.320
 will accompany you for a long time 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:16.220
 inside me myself that I am he has 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:21.340
 imprinted a danger and therefore 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.340
 I'm not so tight 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:30.080
 but I stand as I said myself 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.580
 sometimes a bit away because I am 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.319
 always think if the athletic 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.910
 performance is not right or the 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:38.360
 athletic performance is not right and me 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.140
 not to jump doing well then I 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.610
 the embarrassing 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.500
 and then I want that somehow 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.970
 artistic price also not so out 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.849
 pick up 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:48.950
 I'm self-confident, really me 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:50.720
 believe my self-confidence defines 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:54.110
 Maybe not about it as well 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:57.910
 I am but that I know something 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.910
 still missing so that will get better 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:04.670
 but somehow today has completely 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:06.340
 nice to stay so stay nice 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:10.129
 been 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:12.140
 This will settle what is going to be ok with lara 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:12.560
 your uncertainty even further in the way 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.079

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:19.880
 knot burst 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.320
