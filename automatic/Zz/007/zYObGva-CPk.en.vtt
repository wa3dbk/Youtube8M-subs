00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 because I 'm going to talk about nuts 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.490
 almonds peanuts this kind of stuff 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.830
 and what it means is above all 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.809
 it's people like this and it's very 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.070
 tasty but also many times they say 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.019
 I'm having a healthy snack 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.580
 or something healthy and it's true is 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.080
 healthy but what I want to tell you 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.109
 here very important is that they are very 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.210
 calories and here I bring samples of 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:24.449
 28 grams that is one ounce and each ounce 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.920
 It has between 180 and 220 calories and it is good 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.300
 little bit then when one has a 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.310
 sachet and says it can be a bit of 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.199
 nut or almond snack can 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.199
 finish eating 600 700 calories 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.570
 I have to know that I eat very 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.090
 healthy my snacks are this and this and 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.160
 the day of the disip are healthy 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.399
 are caloric then for these two that 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.260
 they have many bitter many that have 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.270
 they are fantastic here are the samples 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.890
 here they have in those little little boats 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.890
 is where I have in the little steps 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:00.750
 this is being 28 grams are like 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.329
 about 15 almonds and there we have as 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.269
 180 calories that would be good or half 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.280
 of that for a meal or for a 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:09.640
 but for what you see then as a snack 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.640
 it will fill you 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:16.640
 could you combine them let's say there's a 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.979
 little pistachio with some 6 or 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.569
 definitely only this one is alone 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:22.009
 I do like to combine them but when 

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:24.649
 the meals these you have to eat less 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:26.119
 from each one of this to east this has already 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:27.829
 everything combined has like seven 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:29.420
 different and then not from the combined 

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:31.369
 that some have more vitamin than others 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.719
 they have more calcium in order and then to the 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:34.579
 the time you combine them you get more 

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:36.259
 nutrients which is very good but that 

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:37.789
 he is very careful with the 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:39.799
 portions here the portions is what 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:42.140
 basic you recommend combinations by 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:44.390
 example that we want to put nuts or 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.890
 almonds to a yogurt with fabulous egypt 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.289
 and that's a very good idea when I already know 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.789
 put a yogurt or something else then 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:52.130
 you have the other thing that is going to fill you 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:53.539
 more and this has a rich flavor 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.399
 to give their nutrients but without necessity 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:57.979
 that all this is nothing coke all your 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:59.750
 appetizer be pure 9 its pure peanut 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:01.489
 that then there comes the risk of 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:05.450
 Eat too many calories although it is not 

00:02:01.489 --> 00:02:06.940
 too much like all the 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.240
 food the key 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:13.860
 in knowing exactly cup tequila 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.860
 more or less what is an advance 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.730
