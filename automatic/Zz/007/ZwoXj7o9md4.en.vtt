result but it's a waste of don't want a

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:25.589 
result but it's a waste of don't want a
cliff<00:05:23.349> more<00:05:24.009> in<00:05:24.280> yourself<00:05:24.699> can<00:05:25.270> you<00:05:25.389> show

00:05:25.589 --> 00:05:25.599 
cliff more in yourself can you show

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:28.939 
cliff more in yourself can you show
first<00:05:26.590> time<00:05:26.860> I<00:05:26.979> met<00:05:27.009> him<00:05:27.310> it<00:05:27.490> was<00:05:27.669> in<00:05:27.849> the<00:05:28.030> enter

00:05:28.939 --> 00:05:28.949 
first time I met him it was in the enter

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:31.620 
first time I met him it was in the enter
then<00:05:29.949> I<00:05:30.099> think<00:05:30.400> that's<00:05:30.669> so<00:05:30.849> much<00:05:31.030> waste<00:05:31.479> of

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:31.630 
then I think that's so much waste of

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:33.839 
then I think that's so much waste of
energy<00:05:31.990> if<00:05:32.650> you<00:05:32.830> learn<00:05:33.039> to<00:05:33.250> start<00:05:33.610> in<00:05:33.759> the

00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:33.849 
energy if you learn to start in the

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:36.809 
energy if you learn to start in the
front<00:05:33.970> you<00:05:34.870> can<00:05:34.900> do<00:05:35.169> a<00:05:35.199> top<00:05:35.500> 20<00:05:35.830> results<00:05:36.009> and

00:05:36.809 --> 00:05:36.819 
front you can do a top 20 results and

00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:39.930 
front you can do a top 20 results and
then<00:05:36.940> just<00:05:37.060> look<00:05:37.960> into<00:05:38.110> you<00:05:38.370> very<00:05:39.370> strange<00:05:39.669> but
