massive its size also comes with speed

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.060 
massive its size also comes with speed
and<00:00:12.840> a<00:00:12.929> lot<00:00:13.049> of<00:00:13.170> interesting<00:00:13.590> tricks<00:00:13.830> to<00:00:13.920> try

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
and a lot of interesting tricks to try

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.620 
and a lot of interesting tricks to try
and<00:00:14.190> trip<00:00:14.370> you<00:00:14.400> up<00:00:14.490> the<00:00:14.880> snag<00:00:15.089> Y<00:00:15.210> route<00:00:15.389> is<00:00:15.480> weak

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
and trip you up the snag Y route is weak

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.029 
and trip you up the snag Y route is weak
to<00:00:15.719> both<00:00:15.839> ice<00:00:16.049> and<00:00:16.260> water<00:00:16.470> so<00:00:16.740> if<00:00:16.830> you<00:00:16.890> have<00:00:16.980> a

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
to both ice and water so if you have a

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.620 
to both ice and water so if you have a
weapon<00:00:17.190> that<00:00:17.310> uses<00:00:17.580> those<00:00:17.730> bring<00:00:18.029> along<00:00:18.300> the

weapon that uses those bring along the

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.510 
weapon that uses those bring along the
nodule<00:00:18.930> is<00:00:19.140> weakest<00:00:19.560> point<00:00:19.830> as<00:00:19.949> its<00:00:20.100> head<00:00:20.279> but

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
nodule is weakest point as its head but

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.010 
nodule is weakest point as its head but
because<00:00:20.789> it's<00:00:20.939> so<00:00:21.119> tall<00:00:21.390> you<00:00:21.630> should<00:00:21.900> aim<00:00:21.990> for

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
because it's so tall you should aim for

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.840 
because it's so tall you should aim for
the<00:00:22.199> back<00:00:22.380> legs<00:00:22.680> as<00:00:22.859> a<00:00:22.890> secondary<00:00:23.369> now<00:00:23.670> let's

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
escape route changes I recommend waiting

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.549 
escape route changes I recommend waiting
for<00:00:36.270> it<00:00:36.329> to<00:00:36.420> change<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.809> escape<00:00:37.079> route<00:00:37.320> once

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
for it to change the escape route once
