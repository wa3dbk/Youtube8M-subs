00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080 
planks because I didn't gather enough

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.560 
planks because I didn't gather enough
wood<00:02:05.320> at<00:02:05.470> the<00:02:05.530> beginning<00:02:05.800> of<00:02:06.040> this<00:02:06.910> world<00:02:07.150> so

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
wood at the beginning of this world so

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.710 
wood at the beginning of this world so
we've<00:02:08.319> also<00:02:08.500> got<00:02:08.769> lots<00:02:09.160> of<00:02:09.310> dirt<00:02:09.700> and<00:02:09.970> lots<00:02:10.629> of

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
we've also got lots of dirt and lots of

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.300 
we've also got lots of dirt and lots of
gravel<00:02:10.989> I<00:02:11.019> feel<00:02:11.200> like<00:02:11.349> these<00:02:11.500> take<00:02:11.830> up<00:02:11.860> most<00:02:12.220> of

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
gravel I feel like these take up most of

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.559 
gravel I feel like these take up most of
your<00:02:12.430> inventory<00:02:12.700> especially<00:02:13.120> at<00:02:13.510> the

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
your inventory especially at the

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.080 
your inventory especially at the
beginning<00:02:13.690> of<00:02:14.080> a<00:02:14.470> survivor<00:02:14.800> world<00:02:15.069> so<00:02:15.819> this

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
beginning of a survivor world so this

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.640 
beginning of a survivor world so this
will<00:02:16.299> work<00:02:16.450> for<00:02:16.900> when<00:02:17.019> you're<00:02:17.140> starting<00:02:17.469> up<00:02:17.530> a

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
will work for when you're starting up a

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.050 
will work for when you're starting up a
survivor<00:02:17.950> world<00:02:18.159> or<00:02:18.310> if<00:02:18.579> you<00:02:18.670> just<00:02:18.849> need<00:02:18.969> to

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
survivor world or if you just need to

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.950 
survivor world or if you just need to
get<00:02:19.209> some<00:02:19.390> reorganization<00:02:19.870> you<00:02:20.319> got<00:02:20.469> all

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:20.960 
get some reorganization you got all

it's all scrambled about and you don't

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.470 
it's all scrambled about and you don't
know<00:02:24.980> anything<00:02:25.430> is<00:02:25.580> this<00:02:26.060> would<00:02:26.210> be<00:02:26.270> a<00:02:26.300> good

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
know anything is this would be a good

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.450 
know anything is this would be a good
way<00:02:26.570> to<00:02:26.600> reorganize<00:02:27.410> some<00:02:27.560> stuff<00:02:27.770> so<00:02:28.070> moving

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:28.460 
way to reorganize some stuff so moving

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.060 
way to reorganize some stuff so moving
on<00:02:28.610> from<00:02:28.850> these<00:02:29.570> main<00:02:29.960> blocks<00:02:30.290> here<00:02:30.530> to<00:02:30.860> the

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
on from these main blocks here to the

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
so actually I really don't think that a

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.180 
so actually I really don't think that a
double<00:04:05.420> chest<00:04:05.630> is<00:04:05.870> needed<00:04:06.290> for<00:04:06.440> this<00:04:06.590> but<00:04:07.160> I

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
double chest is needed for this but I

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:08.410 
double chest is needed for this but I
just<00:04:07.430> made<00:04:07.550> it<00:04:07.640> anyway

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.420 
just made it anyway

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.500 
just made it anyway
wool<00:04:08.930> is<00:04:08.960> super<00:04:09.890> rare<00:04:10.040> to<00:04:10.700> actually<00:04:11.000> like<00:04:11.180> dye

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 
wool is super rare to actually like dye

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.960 
wool is super rare to actually like dye
and<00:04:11.990> get<00:04:12.470> a<00:04:12.500> bunch<00:04:12.740> of<00:04:12.890> I<00:04:13.100> don't<00:04:13.220> know<00:04:13.490> I<00:04:13.700> don't

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
and get a bunch of I don't know I don't

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:15.160 
and get a bunch of I don't know I don't
know<00:04:14.030> I<00:04:14.090> just<00:04:14.150> don't<00:04:14.390> think<00:04:14.570> that<00:04:14.720> it's<00:04:15.020> really

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170 
know I just don't think that it's really

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:18.760 
know I just don't think that it's really
at<00:04:15.380> that<00:04:15.560> abundant<00:04:16.549> of<00:04:16.810> item<00:04:17.810> whatever<00:04:18.260> and

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:18.770 
at that abundant of item whatever and

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:20.080 
at that abundant of item whatever and
then<00:04:19.070> here's<00:04:19.250> the<00:04:19.310> miscellaneous<00:04:19.850> blocks

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
then here's the miscellaneous blocks

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:21.610 
then here's the miscellaneous blocks
just<00:04:20.210> throwing<00:04:20.540> extra<00:04:20.900> crap<00:04:21.109> blocks<00:04:21.350> in<00:04:21.500> there

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
just throwing extra crap blocks in there

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.820 
just throwing extra crap blocks in there
so<00:04:22.330> crap<00:04:23.330> items<00:04:23.780> crap<00:04:24.230> blocks<00:04:24.530> there's<00:04:24.770> a

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
so crap items crap blocks there's a

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:27.400 
so crap items crap blocks there's a
difference<00:04:25.130> so<00:04:25.730> this<00:04:26.210> is<00:04:26.390> basically<00:04:26.840> my<00:04:27.140> setup

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410 
difference so this is basically my setup

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:28.930 
difference so this is basically my setup
you<00:04:27.680> guys<00:04:27.830> do<00:04:27.980> not<00:04:28.100> have<00:04:28.250> to<00:04:28.370> follow<00:04:28.670> along

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940 
you guys do not have to follow along

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:32.020 
you guys do not have to follow along
exactly<00:04:29.690> you<00:04:30.320> can<00:04:30.590> kind<00:04:30.890> of<00:04:30.950> branch<00:04:31.220> out<00:04:31.400> put

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
exactly you can kind of branch out put

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:33.790 
exactly you can kind of branch out put
your<00:04:32.180> own<00:04:32.240> little<00:04:32.360> spin<00:04:32.780> on<00:04:32.810> it<00:04:32.930> and<00:04:33.140> make<00:04:33.260> it

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
your own little spin on it and make it

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:34.820 
your own little spin on it and make it
however<00:04:33.980> you<00:04:34.400> feel

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
however you feel

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.309 
however you feel
comfortable<00:04:35.729> with<00:04:35.789> so<00:04:36.539> this<00:04:36.780> is<00:04:36.930> just<00:04:37.110> the

00:04:37.309 --> 00:04:37.319 
comfortable with so this is just the

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:39.800 
comfortable with so this is just the
basic<00:04:37.800> you<00:04:38.009> know<00:04:38.129> how<00:04:38.280> I've<00:04:38.520> I<00:04:38.909> feel<00:04:39.030> works<00:04:39.539> for

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
basic you know how I've I feel works for

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.890 
basic you know how I've I feel works for
me<00:04:39.960> especially<00:04:41.300> starting<00:04:42.300> off<00:04:42.479> now

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
me especially starting off now

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.899 
me especially starting off now
eventually<00:04:43.440> I<00:04:43.470> might<00:04:43.560> changes<00:04:44.009> up<00:04:44.129> the<00:04:44.520> the

00:04:44.899 --> 00:04:44.909 
eventually I might changes up the the

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:46.580 
eventually I might changes up the the
setup<00:04:45.210> and<00:04:45.330> stuff<00:04:45.750> once<00:04:46.110> I<00:04:46.229> get<00:04:46.289> more

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
setup and stuff once I get more

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.230 
setup and stuff once I get more
resources<00:04:47.069> and<00:04:47.159> I<00:04:47.250> feel<00:04:47.430> like<00:04:47.580> something

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
resources and I feel like something

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.820 
resources and I feel like something
might<00:04:48.419> be<00:04:48.599> changed<00:04:48.990> around<00:04:49.080> but<00:04:49.620> this<00:04:49.740> is

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 
might be changed around but this is

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.860 
might be changed around but this is
definitely<00:04:49.979> good<00:04:50.280> for<00:04:50.310> starting<00:04:50.759> off<00:04:50.879> your

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
definitely good for starting off your

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.950 
definitely good for starting off your
spy<00:04:52.259> world<00:04:52.500> and<00:04:53.000> should<00:04:54.000> easily<00:04:54.330> work<00:04:54.479> if

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
spy world and should easily work if

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.499 
spy world and should easily work if
you've<00:04:55.139> already<00:04:55.319> started<00:04:55.620> as<00:04:55.979> well<00:04:56.250> so<00:04:56.580> that

00:04:57.499 --> 00:04:57.509 
you've already started as well so that

00:04:57.509 --> 00:05:00.980 
you've already started as well so that
is<00:04:57.629> pretty<00:04:57.750> much<00:04:57.930> it<00:04:58.199> for<00:04:58.759> this<00:04:59.759> little<00:05:00.479> part<00:05:00.840> I

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
is pretty much it for this little part I

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:02.809 
is pretty much it for this little part I
want<00:05:01.199> to<00:05:01.289> go<00:05:01.409> into<00:05:01.650> kind<00:05:02.280> of<00:05:02.400> how<00:05:02.520> you<00:05:02.580> can

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
you can see with my tools here it's

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.809 
you can see with my tools here it's
organized<00:05:07.319> a<00:05:07.650> little<00:05:08.190> bit<00:05:08.310> more<00:05:08.580> there's

00:05:08.809 --> 00:05:08.819 
organized a little bit more there's

00:05:08.819 --> 00:05:11.930 
organized a little bit more there's
space<00:05:09.240> spaces<00:05:09.900> between<00:05:10.169> the<00:05:10.740> pickaxes<00:05:11.669> and

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 
space spaces between the pickaxes and

space spaces between the pickaxes and
the<00:05:12.150> shovels<00:05:12.629> so<00:05:13.139> it's<00:05:13.319> a<00:05:13.349> little<00:05:13.530> bit<00:05:13.710> more
