00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660 
think anything's to overstep like over

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.510 
think anything's to overstep like over
over<00:04:52.050> powered<00:04:52.380> here<00:04:52.590> but<00:04:52.800> let's<00:04:53.160> go<00:04:53.280> ahead<00:04:53.310> and

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 
over powered here but let's go ahead and

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.460 
over powered here but let's go ahead and
drop<00:04:53.670> that<00:04:53.850> into<00:04:54.030> the<00:04:54.120> ravine<00:04:54.450> there<00:04:54.990> is<00:04:55.140> so

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470 
drop that into the ravine there is so

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.080 
drop that into the ravine there is so
much<00:04:55.650> stuff<00:04:55.920> now<00:04:56.100> unfortunately<00:04:56.370> this<00:04:56.790> ravine

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.090 
much stuff now unfortunately this ravine

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:59.570 
much stuff now unfortunately this ravine
isn't<00:04:57.600> the<00:04:58.020> biggest<00:04:58.380> I<00:04:58.650> think<00:04:58.860> there's

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 
isn't the biggest I think there's

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.840 
isn't the biggest I think there's
another<00:04:59.790> one<00:04:59.970> I'm<00:05:00.570> not<00:05:00.720> sure<00:05:00.780> where<00:05:01.410> it<00:05:01.530> is<00:05:01.620> but

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:01.850 
another one I'm not sure where it is but

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:04.370 
another one I'm not sure where it is but
if<00:05:02.850> I<00:05:03.030> pass<00:05:03.210> over<00:05:03.450> it<00:05:03.660> I'll<00:05:03.750> take<00:05:03.930> a<00:05:03.960> drop<00:05:04.200> in

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:04.380 
if I pass over it I'll take a drop in

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:05.900 
if I pass over it I'll take a drop in
but<00:05:04.860> yeah<00:05:05.040> that's<00:05:05.220> pretty<00:05:05.370> much<00:05:05.550> the<00:05:05.730> seed

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:05.910 
but yeah that's pretty much the seed

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:07.190 
but yeah that's pretty much the seed
