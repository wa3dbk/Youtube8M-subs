I'd<00:00:10.559> like<00:00:10.710> to<00:00:10.830> talk<00:00:10.980> a<00:00:11.010> little<00:00:11.219> about<00:00:11.370> our

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
I'd like to talk a little about our

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.430 
I'd like to talk a little about our
latest<00:00:12.059> CD<00:00:12.630> player<00:00:12.900> the<00:00:13.590> c-56<00:00:14.370> 5b<00:00:14.849> EE<00:00:15.440> and

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
latest CD player the c-56 5b EE and

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.170 
latest CD player the c-56 5b EE and
actually<00:00:16.890> call<00:00:17.100> have<00:00:17.279> a<00:00:17.340> CD<00:00:17.609> player<00:00:17.640> is<00:00:18.060> only

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
actually call have a CD player is only

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.480 
actually call have a CD player is only
telling<00:00:18.480> half<00:00:18.810> the<00:00:18.990> story<00:00:19.289> because<00:00:19.740> this

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
telling half the story because this

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.700 
telling half the story because this
actually<00:00:20.939> has<00:00:21.240> a<00:00:21.390> separate<00:00:21.900> high<00:00:22.170> performance

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
actually has a separate high performance

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.880 
actually has a separate high performance
DAC<00:00:23.010> along<00:00:23.910> with<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.300> CD<00:00:24.630> transport<00:00:25.350> so<00:00:25.619> one

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
DAC along with the CD transport so one

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.400 
DAC along with the CD transport so one
side<00:00:26.099> is<00:00:26.279> a<00:00:26.310> CD<00:00:26.670> transport<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.810> other<00:00:27.960> side<00:00:28.230> is

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
side is a CD transport the other side is

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.310 
side is a CD transport the other side is
a<00:00:28.439> DAC<00:00:28.939> and<00:00:29.939> we've<00:00:30.660> done<00:00:30.900> some<00:00:31.170> very

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
a DAC and we've done some very

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.650 
a DAC and we've done some very
interesting<00:00:31.679> things<00:00:32.250> on<00:00:32.460> this<00:00:32.640> player<00:00:32.940> one

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
interesting things on this player one

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:34.880 
interesting things on this player one
thing<00:00:33.809> we've<00:00:33.960> done<00:00:34.110> in<00:00:34.230> this<00:00:34.320> player<00:00:34.590> is<00:00:34.770> we

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
thing we've done in this player is we

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.860 
thing we've done in this player is we
have<00:00:35.010> a<00:00:35.040> sample<00:00:35.370> rate<00:00:35.730> converter<00:00:36.120> this<00:00:36.510> allows

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
have a sample rate converter this allows

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.160 
have a sample rate converter this allows
us<00:00:36.899> to<00:00:37.170> take<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.590> 44.1<00:00:38.520> case<00:00:38.730> ampulla<00:00:39.239> of<00:00:39.450> the

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
us to take the 44.1 case ampulla of the

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.119 
us to take the 44.1 case ampulla of the
CD<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:40.829> upscale<00:00:41.520> at<00:00:41.730> either<00:00:41.879> 96<00:00:42.540> k<00:00:42.780> or<00:00:43.079> 192<00:00:43.739> K

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
CD and upscale at either 96 k or 192 K

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.880 
CD and upscale at either 96 k or 192 K
in<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.969> process<00:00:45.480> we<00:00:45.690> remove<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.260> lot<00:00:46.469> of<00:00:46.649> jitter

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
in the process we remove a lot of jitter

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.549 
in the process we remove a lot of jitter
from<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.340> signal<00:00:47.579> so<00:00:47.969> it<00:00:48.239> any<00:00:48.989> jitter<00:00:49.260> that's

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
from the signal so it any jitter that's

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.250 
from the signal so it any jitter that's
on<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:50.190> disc<00:00:50.460> gets<00:00:51.420> removed<00:00:51.870> in<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.140> up

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
on the disc gets removed in the up

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.189 
on the disc gets removed in the up
sampling<00:00:52.710> process<00:00:53.250> we<00:00:53.969> then<00:00:54.149> go<00:00:54.329> to<00:00:54.390> the

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
sampling process we then go to the

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.920 
sampling process we then go to the
latest<00:00:55.500> generation<00:00:55.739> of<00:00:56.219> Wolfson<00:00:56.730> DAC<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:57.390> we

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
latest generation of Wolfson DAC and we

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.670 
latest generation of Wolfson DAC and we
use<00:00:58.109> two<00:00:58.440> of<00:00:58.469> them<00:00:58.680> in<00:00:58.920> a<00:00:59.010> dual<00:00:59.219> differential

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
use two of them in a dual differential

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.360 
use two of them in a dual differential
configuration<00:01:01.680> which<00:01:01.829> gives<00:01:02.070> us<00:01:02.219> an

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
configuration which gives us an

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.509 
configuration which gives us an

can be fed into your amplifier we also

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.560 
can be fed into your amplifier we also
have<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.740> couple<00:01:20.159> of<00:01:20.400> digital<00:01:20.850> inputs<00:01:21.210> on<00:01:21.360> this

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
have a couple of digital inputs on this

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.070 
have a couple of digital inputs on this
on<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.960> front<00:01:22.200> panel<00:01:22.409> we<00:01:22.770> have<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:22.979> USB<00:01:23.369> input

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
on the front panel we have a USB input

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:30.319 
on the front panel we have a USB input
which<00:01:25.080> is<00:01:25.159> can<00:01:26.159> take<00:01:26.640> a<00:01:27.330> USB<00:01:28.049> finger<00:01:28.680> stick<00:01:29.329> it

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
which is can take a USB finger stick it

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.609 
which is can take a USB finger stick it

because<00:01:38.670> you're<00:01:38.880> likely<00:01:39.150> to<00:01:39.329> have<00:01:39.509> many<00:01:39.780> many

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189 
because you're likely to have many many

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:43.819 
because you're likely to have many many
songs<00:01:41.189> on<00:01:41.549> a<00:01:41.579> memory<00:01:41.970> stick<00:01:42.590> we've<00:01:43.590> done<00:01:43.799> a

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
songs on a memory stick we've done a

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.550 
songs on a memory stick we've done a
different<00:01:44.280> way<00:01:44.399> of<00:01:44.640> selecting<00:01:44.939> things

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
different way of selecting things

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.830 
different way of selecting things
selecting<00:01:46.560> songs<00:01:46.829> and<00:01:47.329> we're<00:01:48.329> using<00:01:48.720> this

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
selecting songs and we're using this

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.830 
selecting songs and we're using this
knob<00:01:49.140> so<00:01:49.799> you<00:01:50.399> select<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.909> track<00:01:51.149> by<00:01:51.420> turning

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
knob so you select the track by turning

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.050 
knob so you select the track by turning
the<00:01:51.930> knob<00:01:52.079> you<00:01:52.890> play<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.310> track<00:01:53.549> by<00:01:53.759> pushing

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
the knob you play the track by pushing

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.719 
the knob you play the track by pushing
it<00:01:54.299> in<00:01:54.450> you<00:01:55.409> can<00:01:55.590> pause<00:01:55.799> it<00:01:55.829> by<00:01:56.219> pushing<00:01:56.460> it

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
it in you can pause it by pushing it

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.270 
it in you can pause it by pushing it
again<00:01:57.079> and<00:01:58.079> this<00:01:58.170> allows<00:01:58.409> you<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:58.770> quickly<00:01:59.009> go

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
again and this allows you to quickly go

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.940 
again and this allows you to quickly go
through<00:01:59.420> you<00:02:00.420> know<00:02:00.509> hundreds<00:02:01.259> of<00:02:01.380> files<00:02:01.619> if

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
through you know hundreds of files if

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.490 
through you know hundreds of files if
you<00:02:01.979> have<00:02:02.219> that<00:02:02.369> many<00:02:02.610> on<00:02:02.790> your<00:02:02.820> memory<00:02:03.210> stick

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
you have that many on your memory stick

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.780 
you have that many on your memory stick
we<00:02:04.500> also<00:02:04.649> have<00:02:04.920> on<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.070> back<00:02:05.250> panel<00:02:05.579> an

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
we also have on the back panel an

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.059 
we also have on the back panel an
optical<00:02:06.240> input<00:02:06.420> and<00:02:06.869> this<00:02:07.079> is<00:02:07.259> ideal<00:02:07.740> for

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
optical input and this is ideal for

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.219 
optical input and this is ideal for
using<00:02:08.340> with<00:02:08.670> a<00:02:08.729> squeeze<00:02:09.270> box<00:02:09.569> or<00:02:09.899> a<00:02:09.929> sono

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229
