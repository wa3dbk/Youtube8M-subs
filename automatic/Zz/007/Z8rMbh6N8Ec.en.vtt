00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.039
 try to avoid 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:45.639
 the police are trying once again not

 not bad in spring cheese bought nura but 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:43.109
 now the government has reduced subsidies and 

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:45.230
 raised taxes and will feel and 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:46.849
 European farmers do not like 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:49.090
 it turns out the place takes 8 points 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.760
 instead of supporting your 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.669
 state farmers buying cheap 

00:02:52.669 --> 00:02:55.359
 products abroad and lose from this all 

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:57.279
 we produce less which means we pay 

00:02:57.279 --> 00:02:59.299
 less taxes with them economic development 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:02.299

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:11.069
 labor is much cheaper though with 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:13.040
 for some time now skete argue with those prices 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.989

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:34.889
 must obey local rules 

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:36.649
 The fact is that taxes but such salaries 

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:38.609
 who pay for coupons much 

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:40.499
 less than real money so 

00:03:40.499 --> 00:03:43.279
 it turns out there were such skills for employees 

00:03:43.279 --> 00:03:45.059
 the main difference is their social function 

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:47.059
 alcohol and cigarettes cannot be bought on them 

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:48.819

00:04:57.509 --> 00:04:59.460
 of course we are not talking about that in this regard
