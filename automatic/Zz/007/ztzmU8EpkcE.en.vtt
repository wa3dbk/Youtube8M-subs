welcome<00:00:32.890> back<00:00:33.010> to<00:00:33.130> the<00:00:33.220> green<00:00:33.370> workbench

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:33.790 
welcome back to the green workbench

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:35.970 
welcome back to the green workbench
today<00:00:34.150> we're<00:00:34.330> building<00:00:34.449> a<00:00:34.840> bike<00:00:35.320> rack<00:00:35.650> out<00:00:35.920> of

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:35.980 
today we're building a bike rack out of

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.380 
today we're building a bike rack out of
two<00:00:36.220> by<00:00:36.370> fours<00:00:37.739> my<00:00:38.739> garage<00:00:39.100> is<00:00:39.550> also<00:00:40.270> my

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:40.390 
two by fours my garage is also my

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.990 
two by fours my garage is also my
workshop<00:00:40.809> and<00:00:41.410> I<00:00:42.160> needed<00:00:42.340> a<00:00:42.489> place<00:00:42.520> where<00:00:42.970> I

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:43.000 
workshop and I needed a place where I

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.360 
workshop and I needed a place where I
can<00:00:43.300> store<00:00:43.660> and<00:00:44.050> organize<00:00:44.290> the<00:00:44.800> bikes<00:00:45.010> in<00:00:45.250> the

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:45.370 
can store and organize the bikes in the

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.160 
can store and organize the bikes in the
garage<00:00:45.580> to<00:00:45.820> keep<00:00:45.970> them<00:00:46.150> out<00:00:46.270> of<00:00:46.420> the<00:00:46.510> way<00:00:46.690> so

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.170 
garage to keep them out of the way so

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:48.509 
garage to keep them out of the way so
I'm<00:00:47.260> actually<00:00:47.379> building<00:00:47.650> it<00:00:47.860> on<00:00:47.949> the<00:00:48.040> back<00:00:48.220> end

00:00:48.509 --> 00:00:48.519 
I'm actually building it on the back end

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:52.799 
I'm actually building it on the back end
of<00:00:48.670> my<00:00:48.750> workbench<00:00:49.750> so<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:52.210> first<00:00:52.390> step<00:00:52.570> is<00:00:52.720> to

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:52.809 
of my workbench so the first step is to

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:57.240 
of my workbench so the first step is to
figure<00:00:52.930> out<00:00:53.079> how<00:00:53.230> tall<00:00:55.290> your<00:00:56.290> back<00:00:56.739> brace<00:00:57.040> is

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.250 
figure out how tall your back brace is

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.010 
figure out how tall your back brace is
going<00:00:57.460> to<00:00:57.550> be<00:00:57.730> we'll<00:00:58.300> talk<00:00:58.480> about<00:00:58.630> how<00:00:58.809> to<00:00:58.840> do

00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.020 
going to be we'll talk about how to do

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.229 
going to be we'll talk about how to do
that<00:00:59.140> in<00:00:59.290> just<00:00:59.469> a<00:00:59.530> minute<00:00:59.880> once<00:01:00.880> you<00:01:01.000> have<00:01:01.120> that

and<00:01:22.569> now<00:01:22.630> your<00:01:22.810> your<00:01:23.110> brace<00:01:23.500> is<00:01:23.709> complete<00:01:24.130> and

00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:24.399 
and now your your brace is complete and

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:27.059 
and now your your brace is complete and
you're<00:01:25.030> ready<00:01:25.360> to<00:01:25.420> begin<00:01:25.569> building<00:01:25.959> now<00:01:26.800> there

00:01:27.059 --> 00:01:27.069 
you're ready to begin building now there

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:29.070 
you're ready to begin building now there
is<00:01:27.220> no<00:01:27.429> other<00:01:27.580> piece<00:01:28.090> against<00:01:28.509> that<00:01:28.630> workbench

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 
is no other piece against that workbench

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.240 
is no other piece against that workbench
so<00:01:29.670> you<00:01:30.670> have<00:01:31.000> the<00:01:31.440> that<00:01:32.440> horizontal<00:01:32.770> brace

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
so you have the that horizontal brace

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.910 
so you have the that horizontal brace
and<00:01:33.520> then<00:01:33.880> your<00:01:34.090> bottom<00:01:34.390> brace<00:01:34.599> and<00:01:34.920> and

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
and then your bottom brace and and

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.370 
and then your bottom brace and and
that's<00:01:36.490> all<00:01:36.700> now<00:01:37.599> you<00:01:37.690> can<00:01:37.959> put<00:01:38.080> this<00:01:38.200> up

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 
that's all now you can put this up

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.160 
that's all now you can put this up
against<00:01:38.709> a<00:01:38.800> wall<00:01:38.979> or<00:01:39.599> against<00:01:40.599> anything<00:01:40.990> where

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
against a wall or against anything where

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.529 
against a wall or against anything where
you<00:01:41.259> can<00:01:41.410> screw<00:01:41.619> in<00:01:41.770> that<00:01:41.890> back<00:01:42.069> brace<00:01:42.360> it<00:01:43.360> does

00:01:43.529 --> 00:01:43.539 
you can screw in that back brace it does

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:48.120 
you can screw in that back brace it does
not<00:01:43.720> have<00:01:43.869> to<00:01:43.990> be<00:01:44.080> against<00:01:44.380> the<00:01:44.440> workbench

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:49.980 

okay<00:01:49.000> first<00:01:49.240> thing<00:01:49.360> you<00:01:49.450> need<00:01:49.540> to<00:01:49.659> do<00:01:49.780> is

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
okay first thing you need to do is

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.380 
okay first thing you need to do is
figure<00:01:50.229> out<00:01:50.350> your<00:01:51.100> angles<00:01:51.490> and<00:01:51.820> the<00:01:52.210> lengths

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
figure out your angles and the lengths

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.510 
figure out your angles and the lengths
of<00:01:52.540> the<00:01:52.630> boards<00:01:52.900> you're<00:01:53.020> going<00:01:53.200> to<00:01:53.290> use<00:01:53.470> I

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:06.330 

chose<00:01:57.520> a<00:01:57.549> 30-60-90<00:01:58.530> triangle<00:02:05.070> because<00:02:06.070> I

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
chose a 30-60-90 triangle because I

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.969 
chose a 30-60-90 triangle because I
didn't<00:02:06.610> have<00:02:06.700> a<00:02:06.729> lot<00:02:06.909> of<00:02:06.970> room<00:02:07.330> so<00:02:08.259> I<00:02:08.590> didn't<00:02:08.860> I

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
didn't have a lot of room so I didn't I

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.850 
didn't have a lot of room so I didn't I
needed<00:02:09.310> my<00:02:09.429> bike<00:02:09.700> rack<00:02:09.910> to<00:02:10.209> not<00:02:10.569> be<00:02:10.869> that<00:02:11.739> wide

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
needed my bike rack to not be that wide

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.000 
needed my bike rack to not be that wide
and<00:02:15.959> again<00:02:16.959> reaching<00:02:17.350> back<00:02:17.530> to<00:02:17.709> your<00:02:17.830> math

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
and again reaching back to your math

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.949 
and again reaching back to your math
class<00:02:18.280> use<00:02:18.580> the<00:02:18.700> Pythagorean<00:02:19.270> theorem<00:02:19.780> a

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
class use the Pythagorean theorem a

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:25.160 
class use the Pythagorean theorem a
squared<00:02:20.400> plus<00:02:21.400> B<00:02:22.030> squared<00:02:22.060> equals<00:02:23.010> C<00:02:24.010> squared

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
squared plus B squared equals C squared

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.270 
squared plus B squared equals C squared
and<00:02:26.170> that<00:02:26.319> way<00:02:26.470> you<00:02:26.530> can<00:02:26.800> figure<00:02:26.980> out<00:02:27.100> the

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
and that way you can figure out the

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:33.120 
and that way you can figure out the
length<00:02:28.350> of<00:02:29.350> C<00:02:29.980> from<00:02:30.610> tip<00:02:31.480> to<00:02:31.510> tip<00:02:32.200> on<00:02:32.769> your

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
length of C from tip to tip on your

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:38.490 
length of C from tip to tip on your
angles<00:02:33.519> set<00:02:34.300> up<00:02:34.420> your<00:02:34.569> saw<00:02:35.970> 30<00:02:36.970> degrees<00:02:37.450> and<00:02:37.870> 60

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
angles set up your saw 30 degrees and 60

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.590 
angles set up your saw 30 degrees and 60
degrees<00:02:39.010> to<00:02:39.370> make<00:02:39.760> your<00:02:39.940> cuts<00:02:40.230> or<00:02:41.880> if<00:02:42.880> you<00:02:43.299> have

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
degrees to make your cuts or if you have

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.360 
degrees to make your cuts or if you have
the<00:02:43.810> room<00:02:44.519> you<00:02:45.519> can<00:02:45.730> go<00:02:45.940> at<00:02:46.239> a<00:02:46.360> more<00:02:47.040> at<00:02:48.040> a<00:02:48.160> wider

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
the room you can go at a more at a wider

00:02:48.370 --> 00:03:04.199 
the room you can go at a more at a wider
angle<00:02:49.200> say<00:02:51.480> 45s<00:03:00.930> now<00:03:01.930> you<00:03:01.989> can<00:03:02.200> see<00:03:02.500> on<00:03:03.280> a<00:03:03.340> big

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
angle say 45s now you can see on a big

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:09.030 
angle say 45s now you can see on a big
bike<00:03:04.590> you're<00:03:05.970> with<00:03:06.970> the<00:03:07.090> 30-60-90<00:03:07.769> your<00:03:08.769> bike

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040
