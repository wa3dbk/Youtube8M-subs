base layout again this base is purely

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.740 
base layout again this base is purely
for<00:00:26.009> decorative<00:00:26.310> purposes<00:00:26.460> maybe<00:00:27.420> in<00:00:27.539> clan

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
for decorative purposes maybe in clan

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.359 
for decorative purposes maybe in clan
wars<00:00:27.960> you<00:00:28.080> can<00:00:28.199> kind<00:00:28.380> of<00:00:28.439> give<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.619> opponent

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
wars you can kind of give the opponent

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:30.800 
wars you can kind of give the opponent
something<00:00:29.699> nice<00:00:29.880> to<00:00:30.060> look<00:00:30.090> at<00:00:30.390> and<00:00:30.449> then

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
something nice to look at and then

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.720 
something nice to look at and then
quickly<00:00:31.140> change<00:00:31.560> your<00:00:31.680> base<00:00:31.800> back<00:00:32.070> but

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
quickly change your base back but

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.130 
quickly change your base back but
actually<00:00:33.090> we<00:00:33.570> were<00:00:33.690> trying<00:00:33.960> to<00:00:34.019> get<00:00:34.110> a

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
actually we were trying to get a

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.020 
actually we were trying to get a
defensive<00:00:34.710> replay<00:00:35.070> out<00:00:35.250> of<00:00:35.370> this<00:00:35.489> layout<00:00:35.760> for

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
defensive replay out of this layout for

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.240 
defensive replay out of this layout for
the<00:00:36.120> longest<00:00:36.570> time<00:00:36.750> we<00:00:37.559> actually<00:00:37.890> went<00:00:38.010> about

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
the longest time we actually went about

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.000 
the longest time we actually went about
20<00:00:38.760> minutes<00:00:39.090> or<00:00:39.360> so<00:00:39.390> of<00:00:39.809> being<00:00:40.199> logged<00:00:40.440> off<00:00:40.739> and

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
20 minutes or so of being logged off and

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.369 
20 minutes or so of being logged off and
not<00:00:41.760> getting<00:00:42.030> attacked<00:00:42.180> maybe<00:00:43.140> it<00:00:43.350> was

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
not getting attacked maybe it was

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:44.900 
not getting attacked maybe it was
because<00:00:43.710> it<00:00:43.980> was<00:00:44.040> a<00:00:44.129> little<00:00:44.399> bit<00:00:44.489> of<00:00:44.579> a<00:00:44.670> unique

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
because it was a little bit of a unique

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.580 
because it was a little bit of a unique
layout<00:00:45.149> maybe<00:00:45.899> there's<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.140> little<00:00:46.200> bit<00:00:46.410> of<00:00:46.440> an

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
layout maybe there's a little bit of an

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.709 
layout maybe there's a little bit of an
intimidation<00:00:47.070> factor<00:00:47.120> but<00:00:48.120> let's<00:00:48.480> go<00:00:48.600> ahead

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
intimidation factor but let's go ahead

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.180 
intimidation factor but let's go ahead
and<00:00:48.840> jump<00:00:48.989> into<00:00:49.140> this<00:00:49.320> defensive<00:00:49.829> raid<00:00:50.039> that

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190
