centered<00:00:12.750> I<00:00:12.929> chose<00:00:13.530> to<00:00:13.679> change<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:14.130> small

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
centered I chose to change the small

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.010 
centered I chose to change the small
detail<00:00:14.790> so<00:00:15.030> I'd<00:00:15.150> have<00:00:15.240> an<00:00:15.389> even<00:00:15.660> amount<00:00:15.750> of

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
detail so I'd have an even amount of

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.540 
detail so I'd have an even amount of
hair<00:00:16.170> on<00:00:16.199> both<00:00:16.529> sides<00:00:16.800> of<00:00:16.949> my<00:00:17.070> head<00:00:17.250> to<00:00:17.400> work

with<00:00:17.760> and<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.539> first<00:00:18.750> step<00:00:18.990> is<00:00:19.140> to<00:00:19.260> take<00:00:19.410> small

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
with and the first step is to take small

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.290 
with and the first step is to take small
sections<00:00:19.980> from<00:00:20.369> either<00:00:20.580> side<00:00:20.880> of<00:00:20.910> your<00:00:21.150> head

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
and braid them backwards next divide the

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.179

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
rest of your hair in half I had a little

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.800

bit of product in my hair so instead of

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.110

ponytail<00:00:31.380> in<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.650> lower<00:00:31.830> section<00:00:32.340> I<00:00:32.489> decided

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
ponytail in the lower section I decided

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.180 
ponytail in the lower section I decided
to<00:00:33.329> braid<00:00:33.570> it<00:00:33.600> out<00:00:33.809> of<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.050> way<00:00:34.170> I<00:00:34.350> didn't<00:00:35.010> want

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
to braid it out of the way I didn't want

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.950 
to braid it out of the way I didn't want
an<00:00:35.280> elastic<00:00:35.820> to<00:00:35.850> crease<00:00:36.180> my<00:00:36.329> hair<00:00:36.570> and<00:00:36.780> this

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
an elastic to crease my hair and this

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.660 
an elastic to crease my hair and this
worked<00:00:37.200> as<00:00:37.350> an<00:00:37.469> alternative<00:00:38.010> to<00:00:38.070> a<00:00:38.250> temporary

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
worked as an alternative to a temporary

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:45.549 
worked as an alternative to a temporary
ponytail

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:45.559 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:48.410 

with<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.680> comb<00:00:46.920> I<00:00:47.100> divided<00:00:47.640> my<00:00:47.670> top<00:00:48.000> section

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
with the comb I divided my top section

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.479 
with the comb I divided my top section
of<00:00:48.510> hair<00:00:48.690> into<00:00:48.960> two<00:00:49.170> this<00:00:49.860> isn't<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.309> necessary

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
of hair into two this isn't a necessary

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.310 
of hair into two this isn't a necessary
step<00:00:51.120> but<00:00:51.449> it<00:00:51.540> does<00:00:51.719> help<00:00:51.960> ensure<00:00:52.290> that

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
step but it does help ensure that

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.020 
step but it does help ensure that
there's<00:00:52.680> an<00:00:52.800> even<00:00:53.100> amount<00:00:53.190> of<00:00:53.430> hair<00:00:53.640> on<00:00:53.670> both

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
there's an even amount of hair on both

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.910 
there's an even amount of hair on both
sides<00:00:54.329> of<00:00:54.480> your<00:00:54.570> head<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:54.930> braid<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.769> that's

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:26.940 
them two by two I just felt it looked a

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.010 
them two by two I just felt it looked a
little<00:01:27.179> neater<00:01:27.390> in<00:01:27.600> my<00:01:27.750> hair<00:01:27.990> this<00:01:28.110> way<00:01:30.020> when

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:34.410 
the ends of the braids and then if you

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:40.719 
the ends of the braids and then if you
want<00:01:34.649> to<00:01:34.830> curl<00:01:35.190> everything<00:01:35.700> that's<00:01:35.880> left<00:01:36.090> over

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:42.919 

when<00:01:41.729> that<00:01:41.759> was<00:01:42.030> done<00:01:42.240> I<00:01:42.270> went<00:01:42.509> back<00:01:42.750> and
