00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 well pixel came out for a while ago 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.540
 I had not reviewed it because 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.620
 if at this time we are organizing not 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.570
 of the anniversary of the program then 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.550
 an apology for the delay but already the 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.830
 we have here and then it's starred by 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:17.690
 Adam Sandler and we all know 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.780
 which is the same I used to do good 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:19.780
 films 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.609
 pixels is a movie directed by 

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:29.650
 cristóbal colón 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:31.210
 chris columbus for those who do not locate it 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.349
 he directed the first two films of 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.050
 Harry Potter and also directed the 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:37.210
 percy jackson's first movie and the 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.550
 thief of the toreno and has other but 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.930
 good has had its ups and downs that 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.280
 director is not characterized by being a 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.199
 great director but neither is 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.800
 characterized by being a lousy director like 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:46.800
 he did it in this movie 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:54.830
 ok I will accept that I wanted to see this 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:58.550
 movie stopped until that certain faith 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:59.780
 but one of the big factors that 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.940
 made people doubt this adam movie 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.040
 sandler because unfortunately in the 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.200
 last 67 projects of adam sandler 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.730
 for me they have been a total garbage I have not 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.000
 seen a good movie adam sandler in 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:12.410
 many years but in the plot of this 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.020
 I found this movie very interesting 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:16.400
 I have grown up in the 80s I grew up 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.590
 with many of these games when the 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.550
 that are appearing, I'm a fan of those of 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.990
 the classic arcade games then 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.729
 the story the short film in which he is 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.070
 based on this movie I liked it very much 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:29.869
 the concept this fence had a 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.790
 huge potential and this movie is 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:34.070
 really bad we landed a little bit of 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.440
 history basically the story is what 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.330
 who saw the traitor in the 80s 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.729
 they launched the nasa launches a probe to 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:43.910
 space with samples left of games 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:46.010
 video with books with drawings with 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:48.830
 culture samples of all history 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:52.009
 of humanity then like to see 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:54.170
 if any race in the universe will come across 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:54.890
 with her and then makes a first contact 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.470
 do not 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.060
 and well do this and years later the 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.920
 extraterrestrials believe that this probe that 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.720
 they send them and in specific the images 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.150
 video is a declaration of war is 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.520
 a challenge for them then they do 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:10.310
 because the aliens adopt these 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.020
 forms and that 's interesting that that in 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.090
 these aspects handle it quite well 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.470
 the way they handle it is that the 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.450
 extraterrestrials saying that we were going to 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.760
 have these battles the first one to win 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.950
 three battles is the one that wins the war and 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.750
 the way in which we are going to carry out 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.910
 the battles is sequences of games 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.310
 then let's say we have pacman if 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.870
 pacman is finished eating all the 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.019
 ghosts before ghosts mate 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.880
 three times to pacman then batman wins 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:36.680
 and like that and it 's interesting and it also has 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.600
 your details that fall every time 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.050
 someone wins a battle the other person 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.400
 you have to give a trophy you make a 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.390
 prisoner of war and those successful to 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.180
 the two prisoners of war who 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.100
 appear the extraterrestrials are 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.320
 shit because it's the old puppy 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.820
 hunt and is juvert and that über also 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.380
 I loved the years of the moment I saw 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.090
 that khyber came out of the movie and said 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.530
 do not cheat skates a gong because 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.390
 I want to see that it has always been charged 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.770
 when he made his appearance in fractured 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.970
 memory in laughter but 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.400
 it broke my heart because it's a 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.810
 super sad scene but they capture 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.520
 perfectly it is so you have to see what 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.020
 makes in this film the war says 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.030
 nothing if part is very nice if you know 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:13.130
 ha ha ha let's remove none of your 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:16.750
 most characteristic qualities we are going to 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.750
 give him a voice and let's talk 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:26.780
 in a single scene it appears if it is with 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:28.820
 scribbles but then I told tell me 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.170
 the chingana like you downloaded now 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.990
 well how are the actors in this 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.430
 Movie Adam Sandler Ultimately Adam 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:37.490
 sandler is the main one is the 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.510
 protagonist and adam sandler you see I do not know 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:40.130
 blind she is tired of doing 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.780
 movies I do not know if I did not want to do this 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:44.210
 movie I do not understand but gallant sanz del 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.890
 cb miserable in the movie I do not know if so 

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:47.480
 the character or adam sandler was designed 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:49.190
 no longer flatly came and said they were 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.050
 mothers leave it as the fucking movie 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.310
 as segmentation I want them to pay me and 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:54.920
 I want to make my millions and I want 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.420
 lengthen me here and put a beer 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.030
 because the same truth is not thrown and two 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:01.640
 grams of effort who has their 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.260
 interesting dialogues have certain 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.060
 interesting exchanges but they do not leave 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.740
 to get them up and they get stuck in being 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.180
 interesting do not take that extra step 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:10.910
 to make good exchanges for 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.290
 good morning to two that's what 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:13.880
 characterizes the whole movie the 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:17.480
 georges de george character 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:19.580
 person is so unpleasant and 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.050
 irritating all your fucking jokes are 

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:22.760
 bad right now all all the pinches 

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:25.490
 jokes are exaggerated his performance is 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:27.050
 exaggerated of all the characters of 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.550
 this movie are cartoons are 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:32.300
 cartoons there are scenes in which they are 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:33.920
 in military talks on strategies 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.480
 military and adam sandler with the other 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:37.280
 Chava are fighting everything becoming 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:39.830
 panchos in front of everyone is that together 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:43.100
 to the president to notice the president 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:44.930
 it's Paul Blart then there's also 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.610
 unfair to first decisions that 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:49.490
 china is doing paul blart like 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:52.100
 president and that is also a character 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:53.810
 both raw as all that is absurd 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:55.610
 everything in this movie is absurd and 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:58.250
 luigi and it shows that they tried to do 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.450
 absurd to get laughs but two in 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.310
 instead of worrying about making a good 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:03.470
 script with good with good strategy 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:05.600
 dialogues and make a little content 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:07.820
 richer 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.410
 to feed your story you go back to 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:11.210
 your characters absurd caricatures that 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:13.520
 they are not memorable that they will not leave 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.840
 footprint for nothing in fact everything 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.790
 otherwise you will leave this movie 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:24.350
 I was going to say with what characteristics 

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:27.340
 I had that short obsessed with the 

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:27.340
 paranoid 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:33.020
 honestly this movie of go no 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:33.950
 there's more I can say there's not much 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:35.570
 what can be said about this film 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:37.130
 has certain elements there are certain 

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:38.180
 sequences that are no more than 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:39.530
 nothing the scenes where there is no 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.300
 dialogues where it's not about doing 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:43.820
 comedy basically the scenes of 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:45.500
 action those sequences so parents something 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:47.300
 that gave me a shitload of courage in his - 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:49.370
 the only joke the only fucking joke 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:52.070
 which I laughed when I was watching 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:55.490
 the trailer was when the president sees 

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:56.780
 when I puncture this smurf and kill him and 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:58.520
 president thank you do not tell the 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:00.140
 declamation smurf that joke was I went 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.870
 very loaded with the truth yes I laughed with 

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:05.390
 the little prince was killed and in this 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:07.190
 they changed film and forgiveness am 

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:09.560
 I'm ruined some parts of the 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:11.540
 movie prometheus believe me believe me no 

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:14.630
 it's worth seeing it is not worth 

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:16.520
 between seeing what I'm saying no 

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:17.990
 will change them at all and the joke 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:19.640
 is that this joke they decided to change 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:21.020
 I do not know if I told anyone 

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:23.420
 apparently people did not like it 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:26.180
 the president of the us will kill smurf 

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:28.100
 so they decided to put that joke with 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:29.110
 not knowing if to give that joke to another 

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:32.630
 person 

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:35.480
 and it's not so funny anymore it's not a blow 

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:36.860
 as charged as if the president is yes 

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:38.480
 the president would have sat another 

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:39.890
 acidity is to say please please please 

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:41.780
 I choose no one say that man that 

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:43.639
 you do in a smurf 

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:45.950
 that joke would have been funnier than 

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:47.570
 they say it's not that funny exactly 

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:50.120
 this movie is not funny but good 

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:51.889
 already with that I'm going to finish no I do not know if 

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:53.240
 have gone to see if the way to see what 

00:06:51.889 --> 00:06:56.240
 they seemed to put their comments 

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:57.620
 down I do not think many of you 

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:59.720
 have seen why they are doing badly 

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:01.490
 at the box office then and the truth 

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:02.990
 all everyone is running or 

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:05.750
 I was slow to see that movie because 

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:08.090
 the truth for love of art boy with 

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:09.860
 you but good without more for the 

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:11.270
 moment guys do not forget to put like
