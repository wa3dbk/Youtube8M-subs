guiding<00:02:48.150> the<00:02:48.420> hair<00:02:48.630> straightener<00:02:49.200> with<00:02:49.980> my

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
guiding the hair straightener with my

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.120 
guiding the hair straightener with my
brush<00:02:51.000> here<00:02:51.390> what<00:02:51.780> happens<00:02:52.110> when<00:02:52.230> you<00:02:52.350> go<00:02:52.560> in<00:02:52.860> a

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
brush here what happens when you go in a

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.949 
brush here what happens when you go in a
bit<00:02:53.250> faster<00:02:53.820> way<00:02:53.940> and<00:02:54.180> then<00:02:54.420> you<00:02:54.540> stop<00:02:54.810> and

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
bit faster way and then you stop and

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.380 
bit faster way and then you stop and
then<00:02:55.680> you<00:02:55.860> go<00:02:56.010> start<00:02:56.340> to<00:02:56.430> go<00:02:56.550> bit<00:02:56.700> slower<00:02:57.090> is

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
then you go start to go bit slower is

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.380 
then you go start to go bit slower is
that<00:02:58.019> you<00:02:58.230> start<00:02:58.530> to<00:02:58.620> create<00:02:59.010> bumps<00:02:59.670> so<00:03:00.090> the

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
that you start to create bumps so the

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.540 
that you start to create bumps so the
hair<00:03:00.660> doesn't<00:03:01.140> look<00:03:01.170> as<00:03:01.410> sleek<00:03:01.920> and<00:03:02.160> straight

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
hair doesn't look as sleek and straight

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.059 
hair doesn't look as sleek and straight
and<00:03:02.819> has<00:03:03.330> more<00:03:03.630> ridges<00:03:04.140> to<00:03:04.440> the<00:03:04.560> length<00:03:04.769> of<00:03:04.950> the

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
and has more ridges to the length of the

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:06.740 
and has more ridges to the length of the
hair<00:03:05.250> and<00:03:05.430> that's<00:03:05.580> not<00:03:05.730> what<00:03:06.120> you<00:03:06.269> want<00:03:06.420> the

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
hair and that's not what you want the

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.900 
hair and that's not what you want the
next<00:03:07.140> step<00:03:07.260> is<00:03:07.319> to<00:03:07.440> make<00:03:07.800> sure<00:03:07.830> that<00:03:08.550> you

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
next step is to make sure that you

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.199 
next step is to make sure that you
stration<00:03:09.540> the<00:03:10.170> front<00:03:10.560> end<00:03:10.860> of<00:03:11.160> your<00:03:11.250> hair<00:03:11.670> the

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
stration the front end of your hair the

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.840 
stration the front end of your hair the
last<00:03:12.569> so<00:03:13.019> make<00:03:13.410> sure<00:03:13.440> that<00:03:13.680> you<00:03:14.370> know<00:03:14.489> you<00:03:14.550> go

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
last so make sure that you know you go

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.759 
last so make sure that you know you go
really<00:03:15.060> slow<00:03:15.480> with<00:03:15.720> it<00:03:15.750> because<00:03:16.230> that's<00:03:16.560> what

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
really slow with it because that's what

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:18.710 
really slow with it because that's what
people<00:03:16.860> will<00:03:17.100> get<00:03:17.250> to<00:03:17.400> see<00:03:17.610> as<00:03:17.850> you<00:03:18.269> can<00:03:18.420> tell

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
people will get to see as you can tell

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.140 
people will get to see as you can tell
that<00:03:19.019> this<00:03:19.350> end<00:03:19.650> of<00:03:19.769> my<00:03:19.890> hair<00:03:20.100> is<00:03:20.250> quite<00:03:20.519> frizzy

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
that this end of my hair is quite frizzy

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.390 
that this end of my hair is quite frizzy
