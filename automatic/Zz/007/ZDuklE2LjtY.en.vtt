was a difficult moment and to go out

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.190 
was a difficult moment and to go out
from<00:00:32.070> this<00:00:32.219> difficult<00:00:32.850> moment<00:00:32.880> you<00:00:33.239> need<00:00:33.420> to

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
from this difficult moment you need to

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.680 
from this difficult moment you need to
have<00:00:34.730> one<00:00:36.170> lucky<00:00:37.170> situation<00:00:37.829> we<00:00:38.790> didn't<00:00:39.149> we

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
have one lucky situation we didn't we

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.590 
have one lucky situation we didn't we
had<00:00:39.719> this<00:00:39.899> like<00:00:40.140> situation<00:00:40.850> came<00:00:41.850> in<00:00:42.059> and<00:00:42.360> is

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
had this like situation came in and is

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.279 
had this like situation came in and is
called<00:00:43.160> second<00:00:44.160> goal<00:00:44.340> but<00:00:44.520> I<00:00:44.579> think<00:00:44.910> that<00:00:45.289> the

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
called second goal but I think that the

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.709 
called second goal but I think that the
most<00:00:46.440> important<00:00:46.950> thing<00:00:47.010> is<00:00:47.430> that<00:00:47.510> we<00:00:48.510> played

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
most important thing is that we played

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.279 
most important thing is that we played
well<00:00:49.219> we<00:00:50.219> had<00:00:50.309> a<00:00:50.340> lot<00:00:50.460> of<00:00:50.489> chance<00:00:50.879> we<00:00:51.660> score<00:00:51.989> and

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
well we had a lot of chance we score and

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.610

when<00:00:55.829> he<00:00:55.890> came<00:00:56.129> off<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:56.579> you're<00:00:56.640> shaking<00:00:57.149> a

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
when he came off and you're shaking a

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.869 
when he came off and you're shaking a
lot<00:00:57.360> of<00:00:57.570> odd<00:00:57.690> sons<00:00:58.020> is<00:00:58.980> this<00:00:59.460> one<00:00:59.670> of<00:00:59.699> most

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879

what<00:01:02.399> is<00:01:02.460> reason<00:01:02.910> because<00:01:03.149> it<00:01:03.270> was<00:01:03.420> not

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
what is reason because it was not

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.410 
what is reason because it was not
difficult<00:01:04.049> but<00:01:04.470> you<00:01:04.739> know<00:01:04.860> after<00:01:05.489> three<00:01:06.090> draw

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
difficult but you know after three draw

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.460 
difficult but you know after three draw
one<00:01:06.750> defeat<00:01:08.450> but<00:01:09.450> not<00:01:09.689> because<00:01:09.840> you<00:01:09.990> deserve

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
one defeat but not because you deserve

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.910 
one defeat but not because you deserve
to<00:01:10.799> do<00:01:11.070> it<00:01:11.189> through<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.909> row<00:01:12.030> but<00:01:12.920> you

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
to do it through the row but you

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.840 
to do it through the row but you
consider<00:01:14.369> goal<00:01:14.610> your<00:01:15.240> score<00:01:15.570> maybe<00:01:16.640> maybe<00:01:17.640> you

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
consider goal your score maybe maybe you

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:18.820 
consider goal your score maybe maybe you
need

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
need

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.490 
need
a<00:01:18.890> game<00:01:19.820> like<00:01:20.030> this<00:01:20.090> difficult<00:01:21.080> game<00:01:21.230> goes

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
a game like this difficult game goes

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.530 
a game like this difficult game goes
full-on<00:01:21.790> is<00:01:22.790> a<00:01:22.850> good<00:01:23.060> team<00:01:23.650> they<00:01:24.650> will<00:01:24.800> manager

I<00:01:26.590> don't<00:01:27.590> think<00:01:27.800> that<00:01:27.860> would<00:01:28.070> be<00:01:28.220> easy<00:01:28.430> for<00:01:28.730> the

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:28.760 
I don't think that would be easy for the

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.930 
I don't think that would be easy for the
other<00:01:29.390> team<00:01:29.570> poo<00:01:29.810> in<00:01:29.960> here<00:01:30.230> it's<00:01:31.100> a<00:01:31.190> little<00:01:31.790> bit
