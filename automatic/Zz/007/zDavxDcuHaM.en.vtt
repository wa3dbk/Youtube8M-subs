00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:16.760
 However it will be your day make you go 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:20.740
 the unboxing of the iPhone 4s 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:23.839
 my model is the real 16gb model 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:26.269
 opening the casket we will find the iphone 

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:31.819
 then the front side we find the 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:34.850
 home button and internal camera at 

00:00:31.819 --> 00:00:36.830
 side we will find in an antenna system 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:41.270
 that would be these tac that I am 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:46.250
 allowed down that below which is the same 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:48.890
 also in iii in this other side here 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.410
 we find the test to adjust the volume 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:54.050
 and rivets it to enable silent 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.520
 here instead as I have already said we find 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:59.270
 of the notches of the new system of 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:02.079
 antennas and that we find the space where 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:07.220
 will go to the sim 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:10.190
 above or then there is the 3.5 mm jack where 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:13.159
 the headset will go this dot the 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:16.900
 microphone to suppress the noises of 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:21.050
 bottom the lock button 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:23.950
 behind it there is nothing on Mr. 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:30.100
 of the apple and we find a camera from 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:32.600
 8.8 pardon megapixels and LED flash 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.340
 below instead we find the two 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.740
 many people say I'm from 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.780
 speakers but in reality it is not in 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.540
 actually one is the microphone for one and 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:46.070
 the speaker and this central and the 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:50.119
 dock connector then inside the 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:54.290
 box we immediately find this where 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:57.140
 this booklet where there is where there is 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:59.240
 most important is this key e 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:03.110
 serves to open the compartment where we will put 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:06.049
 laxity then in addition to the booklet of the 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:09.830
 instructions at the bottom of everything we will find 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:14.330
 the apple stickers 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:17.810
 but this does not interest us then we will find 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:20.780
 within accessories this has 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:25.100
 brought s.bio we can connect it both to 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:29.450
 computer to the charger they have 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:33.920
 brought sb then there are the irregulars 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:35.720
 here they are always the same and there is 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:41.390
 always the same in the sense that I will not change 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:46.420
 never and then or when will we turn on the 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:48.620
 phone is the apple symbol in 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:53.300
 as soon as it lights up I had this 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:55.000
 screen iphone menu not 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:58.400
 they never change 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.980
 so there are no big news 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.350
 then this unboxing ends here since 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.860

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.860
 next
