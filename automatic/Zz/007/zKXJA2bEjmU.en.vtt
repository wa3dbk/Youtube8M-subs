00:00:03.589 --> 00:00:08.580
 Further in the program I want to say that 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.830
 almost all owners of diesel 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.349
 cars that can not be removed 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.130
 nozzles drawn eventually our 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.230
 service center 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.570
 diesel engine first of all need it for 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.369
 most pedestrian output pleases and 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.230
 traveler give money for gasoline 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.570
 but do not give money for any 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:28.189
 case on solving any problems 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.189
 that will arise along the way 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.700
 you are watching the auto theme program I'm in 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.060
 autodiesel service center 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:45.150
 notice reno himself yong 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:46.950
 and finally oranges these three 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.510
 car stand with the same 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.550
 Dima problem as I understand it 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.340
 nozzle removal 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.290
 why such a problem arose because 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.600
 removing nozzles sooner or later 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.780
 will face each driver who 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.060
 have a diesel car so here 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:05.910
 The reason why it is difficult to extract what 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:08.850
 risks when removing the injectors are waiting for us 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:11.130
 but what can be done to 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:15.510
 avoid such a complicated extraction 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:19.440
 nozzles in the future when compared with 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:22.170
 nozzle design 80 90s then 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.140
 cylinder head screwed 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.430
 literally here is one centimeter 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.940
 nozzles and it was screwed on 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.250
 thread 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.200
 that is, even if there are some processes 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.150
 corrosion occurred she calmly 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.030
 twisted out and the nozzle removed 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.600
 this whole part was so to speak 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.620
 outside the cylinder head 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.840
 modern jets all this one 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.700
 the surface is in contact with 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.800
 aluminum cylinder head 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.640
 during the operation here is inevitable 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:52.530
 water gets some salts here 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.890
 the engine naturally heats up 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:59.310
 cools down the processes of corrosion and 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:01.050
 shell seizure occurs 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:05.640
 injector it stick to 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:10.739
 yes and that now you can recommend 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.780
 if you are a new car owner then we 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.950
 recommend 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.310
 especially on those cars that you 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.230
 Called Son Yong and rexton ii 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:22.140
 opel vivaro reno traffic and where is this 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.630
 the problem is especially bright and characteristic 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:28.190
 manifested we recommend extract 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:31.620
 indicators and lubricate them with special 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:34.620
 lubricant which prevents further 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:37.019
 to the rose we use with the mask released 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.600
 mercedes company but it is suitable for any 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:42.090
 injectors that is if you use 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.280
 this grease then ten to twenty. 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:47.730
 it will be necessary to remove the nozzle, we take off I 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:51.660
 no problem right here 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:54.510
 you bought a car that was already in 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:57.930
 used in Europe if previous 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:00.870
 the owner did not take care to protect themselves 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:03.840
 and the next owners then arise 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:06.000
 problems i mean these nozzles like i already 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:10.099
 said wedged block heads 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.780
 cylinders and in order to remove them 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:15.110
 have to use certain 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:19.260
 certain technological methods 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:20.690
 particular tools pullers here you are 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.819
 see to retrieve 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.299
 electromagnetic nozzles production 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:26.480
 bosch 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:28.980
 there from such cars there for example 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.090
 mercedes bmw this and so on and so forth 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.310
 then used here 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.920
 hydraulic puller that is this one 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:38.160
 hydraulic cylinder using before 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:40.079
 pump develops efforts 15 tons of it 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:43.769
 the design is such that it is possible through 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:46.730
 hole in the cylinder skip the screw 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:49.859
 stuck to the nozzle body and this 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:51.840
 15 tons to them and effort and pull out 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:54.389
 cylinder heads without harm 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.829
 whether cylinder heads will be harmful 

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:56.519
 jets do measures depend on how she 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:58.380
 stuck 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:00.239
 I want to say that almost everything 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.069
 owners of diesel cars in 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:04.319
 which can not remove the nozzle 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:04.680
 finally appeals to the service 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:06.389
 Centre 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.280
 autodiesel why because on others 

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:10.859
 service stations of this 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:13.010
 make just simply have not been able to and 

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:14.430

 fuel equipment 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:24.870
 we are in my opinion all the parts on from 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.120
 big hands without intermediaries unique with 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:29.520

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:34.590
 the highest qualification 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:37.080
