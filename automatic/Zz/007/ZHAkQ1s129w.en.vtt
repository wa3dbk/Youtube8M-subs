00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.800 

this<00:00:13.750> is<00:00:14.170> the<00:00:14.440> new<00:00:14.650> Porsche<00:00:15.220> 911<00:00:15.639> Turbo<00:00:15.730> and<00:00:16.209> I

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:16.810 
this is the new Porsche 911 Turbo and I

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:18.060 
this is the new Porsche 911 Turbo and I
know<00:00:16.869> what<00:00:17.019> you're<00:00:17.109> thinking<00:00:17.470> it<00:00:17.619> looks<00:00:17.859> just

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:18.070 
know what you're thinking it looks just

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:27.500 
know what you're thinking it looks just
like<00:00:18.189> the<00:00:18.550> old<00:00:18.730> Porsche<00:00:19.449> 911<00:00:19.869> turbo<00:00:20.609> wrong

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.690 

so<00:00:28.510> what<00:00:28.720> exactly<00:00:28.840> is<00:00:29.290> new<00:00:29.560> on<00:00:29.800> the<00:00:29.920> 911<00:00:30.369> turbo

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:30.700 
so what exactly is new on the 911 turbo

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.030 
so what exactly is new on the 911 turbo
it's<00:00:31.540> hard<00:00:31.690> to<00:00:31.810> know<00:00:31.900> where<00:00:32.050> to<00:00:32.080> start<00:00:32.230> but<00:00:32.739> the

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:33.040 
it's hard to know where to start but the

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.500 
it's hard to know where to start but the
back<00:00:33.280> is<00:00:33.310> probably<00:00:33.640> the<00:00:33.850> best<00:00:34.030> bit<00:00:34.210> with<00:00:34.300> a<00:00:34.330> 911

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:34.510 
back is probably the best bit with a 911

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.900 
back is probably the best bit with a 911
server<00:00:34.900> and<00:00:35.200> of<00:00:35.650> course<00:00:35.920> we<00:00:36.309> have<00:00:36.430> a<00:00:36.460> brand<00:00:36.790> new

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:36.910 
server and of course we have a brand new

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:38.040 
server and of course we have a brand new
twin<00:00:37.420> turbo<00:00:37.690> engine

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.050 
twin turbo engine

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.799 
twin turbo engine
it's<00:00:38.230> 3.8<00:00:39.070> liters<00:00:39.400> this<00:00:39.580> time<00:00:39.760> instead<00:00:40.000> of<00:00:40.090> 3.6

00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:40.809 
it's 3.8 liters this time instead of 3.6

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:43.560 
it's 3.8 liters this time instead of 3.6
and<00:00:41.020> it<00:00:41.500> has<00:00:41.590> direct<00:00:41.980> fuel<00:00:42.309> injection<00:00:42.570> which

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:43.570 
and it has direct fuel injection which

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.689 
and it has direct fuel injection which
not<00:00:43.750> only<00:00:43.780> gives<00:00:43.989> it<00:00:44.230> more<00:00:44.350> power<00:00:44.410> it<00:00:44.980> has<00:00:45.100> 500

00:00:45.689 --> 00:00:45.699 
not only gives it more power it has 500

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:47.400 
not only gives it more power it has 500
horsepower<00:00:45.970> but<00:00:46.629> it<00:00:46.720> makes<00:00:46.900> it<00:00:47.050> a<00:00:47.110> lot<00:00:47.350> more

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:47.410 
horsepower but it makes it a lot more

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.400 
horsepower but it makes it a lot more
economical<00:00:48.129> it<00:00:48.340> is<00:00:48.550> 16%<00:00:49.480> more<00:00:49.750> economical<00:00:50.350> in

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:50.410 
economical it is 16% more economical in

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.560 
economical it is 16% more economical in
the<00:00:50.530> old<00:00:50.650> model<00:00:50.830> this<00:00:51.070> thing<00:00:51.309> will<00:00:51.430> do<00:00:51.550> 25<00:00:52.150> mpg

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:52.570 
the old model this thing will do 25 mpg

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.560 
the old model this thing will do 25 mpg
all<00:00:53.019> day<00:00:53.410> every<00:00:53.860> day<00:00:53.890> very<00:00:54.460> impressive<00:00:55.000> there

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.570 
all day every day very impressive there

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.930 
all day every day very impressive there
are<00:00:55.720> one<00:00:55.900> or<00:00:55.930> two<00:00:56.129> subtle<00:00:57.129> visual<00:00:57.489> changes

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
are one or two subtle visual changes

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.270 
are one or two subtle visual changes
probably<00:00:58.809> the<00:00:58.870> most<00:00:58.989> obvious<00:00:59.200> of<00:00:59.559> which<00:00:59.590> are

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
probably the most obvious of which are

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.910 
probably the most obvious of which are
the<00:01:00.430> new<00:01:00.550> 19-inch<00:01:01.120> wheels<00:01:01.239> which<00:01:02.110> also<00:01:02.350> happen

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
the new 19-inch wheels which also happen

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.160 
the new 19-inch wheels which also happen
to<00:01:02.950> be<00:01:03.160> 2<00:01:03.670> kilograms<00:01:04.149> lighter<00:01:04.330> per<00:01:04.720> corner

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
to be 2 kilograms lighter per corner

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:06.810 
to be 2 kilograms lighter per corner
than<00:01:05.619> the<00:01:05.710> old<00:01:05.860> car<00:01:06.070> that<00:01:06.280> makes<00:01:06.550> a<00:01:06.640> key

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:06.820 
than the old car that makes a key

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.969 
than the old car that makes a key
difference<00:01:07.149> and<00:01:07.420> the<00:01:08.020> big<00:01:08.200> difference<00:01:08.560> is<00:01:08.770> of

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979 
difference and the big difference is of

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:14.550 
difference and the big difference is of
course<00:01:09.369> this<00:01:10.330> and<00:01:11.369> at<00:01:12.369> long<00:01:12.640> last<00:01:12.820> these<00:01:13.690> they

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
course this and at long last these they

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.529 
course this and at long last these they
have<00:01:14.680> fitted<00:01:15.009> the<00:01:15.039> 911<00:01:15.580> turbo<00:01:15.940> with<00:01:16.119> a<00:01:16.149> PDK

00:01:16.529 --> 00:01:16.539 
have fitted the 911 turbo with a PDK

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:19.560 
have fitted the 911 turbo with a PDK
gearbox<00:01:16.750> and<00:01:17.410> not<00:01:17.920> only<00:01:18.070> that<00:01:18.250> they<00:01:19.210> have<00:01:19.360> got

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
gearbox and not only that they have got

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.570 
gearbox and not only that they have got
rid<00:01:19.840> of<00:01:19.869> the<00:01:20.229> ridiculous<00:01:20.860> steering<00:01:21.430> wheel

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:21.580 
rid of the ridiculous steering wheel

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.810 
rid of the ridiculous steering wheel
buttons<00:01:22.000> now<00:01:22.720> you<00:01:22.780> have<00:01:22.990> paddles<00:01:23.410> this<00:01:24.039> one<00:01:24.250> to

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 
buttons now you have paddles this one to

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.719 
buttons now you have paddles this one to
change<00:01:25.030> up<00:01:25.270> this<00:01:25.899> one<00:01:26.170> to<00:01:26.530> change<00:01:26.770> down<00:01:27.039> it'll

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:27.729 
change up this one to change down it'll

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:30.359 
change up this one to change down it'll
cost<00:01:27.880> you<00:01:28.030> another<00:01:28.320> 271<00:01:29.320> pounds<00:01:29.619> if<00:01:30.010> you<00:01:30.189> want

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:30.369 
cost you another 271 pounds if you want

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:31.830 
cost you another 271 pounds if you want
the<00:01:30.430> paddles<00:01:30.790> instead<00:01:31.210> of<00:01:31.299> the<00:01:31.390> silly<00:01:31.570> buttons

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
the paddles instead of the silly buttons

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.390 
the paddles instead of the silly buttons
because<00:01:32.470> Porsche<00:01:32.710> is<00:01:32.860> stubborn<00:01:33.040> enough<00:01:33.340> to

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:33.400 
because Porsche is stubborn enough to

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.070 
because Porsche is stubborn enough to
still<00:01:33.729> think<00:01:33.760> that<00:01:34.000> the<00:01:34.150> button<00:01:34.450> system<00:01:34.659> works

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
still think that the button system works

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:43.010 
still think that the button system works
it<00:01:35.950> doesn't<00:01:36.369> but<00:01:37.000> this<00:01:37.150> does<00:01:37.360> and<00:01:37.600> it's<00:01:38.290> great

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.630 

now<00:01:44.020> I<00:01:44.049> know<00:01:44.200> it's<00:01:44.409> taken<00:01:44.799> Porsche<00:01:45.100> quite<00:01:45.610> a

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
now I know it's taken Porsche quite a

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.850 
now I know it's taken Porsche quite a
while<00:01:46.000> to<00:01:46.270> put<00:01:46.390> a<00:01:46.450> PDK<00:01:46.840> gearbox<00:01:47.080> in<00:01:47.619> a<00:01:47.710> nine

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
while to put a PDK gearbox in a nine

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
different turbo but when Porsche does

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.140 
different turbo but when Porsche does
something<00:01:50.680> like<00:01:50.799> this<00:01:50.979> they<00:01:51.460> do<00:01:51.520> tend<00:01:51.909> to<00:01:52.000> do

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.150 
something like this they do tend to do

something like this they do tend to do
it<00:01:52.270> proper

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:53.580

just<00:02:07.020> like<00:02:07.140> that<00:02:07.430> second<00:02:08.430> gear<00:02:08.750> off<00:02:09.750> you<00:02:10.020> go

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
just like that second gear off you go

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.729 
just like that second gear off you go
third<00:02:11.490> gear<00:02:12.440> fourth<00:02:13.440> gear

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739

and<00:02:16.040> not<00:02:16.220> only<00:02:16.250> to<00:02:16.549> happen<00:02:17.030> really<00:02:17.540> really

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
and not only to happen really really

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.240 
and not only to happen really really
fast<00:02:18.349> it's<00:02:19.280> so<00:02:19.700> smooth<00:02:20.090> as<00:02:20.420> well<00:02:20.860> that<00:02:21.860> makes<00:02:22.099> a

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
fast it's so smooth as well that makes a

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.970 
fast it's so smooth as well that makes a
really<00:02:22.549> big<00:02:22.790> difference<00:02:23.110> as<00:02:24.110> to<00:02:24.170> how<00:02:24.349> usable

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
really big difference as to how usable

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
and how drivable this car is on the road

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.740 
and how drivable this car is on the road
very<00:02:29.230> very<00:02:29.530> impressive<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:31.180> impressiveness

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
very very impressive the impressiveness

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.260 
very very impressive the impressiveness

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.400 
car is a new set of engine mounts which
probably<00:02:42.010> sounds<00:02:42.370> a<00:02:42.400> bit<00:02:42.520> sporty<00:02:43.090> and<00:02:43.240> it

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
probably sounds a bit sporty and it

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.360 
probably sounds a bit sporty and it
doesn't<00:02:44.410> really<00:02:44.530> mean<00:02:44.800> much<00:02:44.860> to<00:02:45.190> the<00:02:45.310> overall

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
it's how fast it is okay it's really

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.900 
it's how fast it is okay it's really
difficult<00:03:35.380> to<00:03:35.650> put<00:03:35.860> into<00:03:36.010> words<00:03:36.130> how<00:03:36.670> much

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
not just at high revs but I mean this

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.880 
not just at high revs but I mean this
thing<00:03:45.220> developed<00:03:45.550> is<00:03:45.610> peak<00:03:45.850> torque<00:03:46.150> at<00:03:46.890> 1950

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
revs that means when you put your foot

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.040 
revs that means when you put your foot
down<00:03:49.930> at<00:03:50.320> less<00:03:50.650> than<00:03:50.680> 2,000<00:03:51.520> revs<00:03:51.760> it<00:03:52.270> fires

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.050 
down at less than 2,000 revs it fires

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:55.290 
down at less than 2,000 revs it fires
itself<00:03:53.590> at<00:03:53.770> the<00:03:53.890> horizon

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:55.300
