00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:06.019 
it starts off with the perfect officered
lesson<00:00:04.950> and<00:00:05.130> that<00:00:05.250> came<00:00:05.550> from<00:00:05.700> doing<00:00:05.970> a

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
get how they could demonstrate progress

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.960 
get how they could demonstrate progress
and<00:00:33.810> what<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.590> elements<00:00:34.830> were<00:00:35.190> and<00:00:35.520> there<00:00:35.880> are

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:35.970 
and what the elements were and there are

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:37.610 
and what the elements were and there are
lots<00:00:36.180> of<00:00:36.360> things<00:00:36.480> written<00:00:36.750> but<00:00:37.200> they're<00:00:37.350> big

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620

i decided i wanted to write something

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.300 
i decided i wanted to write something
was<00:00:41.910> very<00:00:42.150> simple<00:00:42.660> very<00:00:42.690> straightforward

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:43.310 
was very simple very straightforward

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
that could you know really be a little

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.410 
that could you know really be a little
handbook<00:00:46.590> for<00:00:47.160> it<00:00:47.310> with<00:00:47.550> everything<00:00:48.150> in<00:00:48.270> it

that you could use not all of it all the
same<00:00:50.910> time<00:00:51.210> but<00:00:51.570> you<00:00:51.720> could<00:00:51.900> use<00:00:51.930> to<00:00:52.350> refer<00:00:52.500> to

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
same time but you could use to refer to

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.700 
same time but you could use to refer to
just<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.670> help<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.120> ordinary<00:00:54.690> teacher<00:00:55.380> that

the<00:00:58.230> learning<00:00:58.410> in<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.770> classroom<00:00:59.010> whether

00:00:59.480 --> 00:00:59.490 
the learning in the classroom whether

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.640 
the learning in the classroom whether
it's<00:00:59.610> posted<00:01:00.210> or<00:01:00.450> for<00:01:00.840> anything<00:01:01.080> else<00:01:01.350> and

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:01.650 
it's posted or for anything else and

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:03.920 
it's posted or for anything else and
that<00:01:02.430> went<00:01:02.640> you<00:01:02.850> know<00:01:02.910> down<00:01:03.210> really<00:01:03.420> well<00:01:03.570> to

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
that went you know down really well to

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.230 
that went you know down really well to
you<00:01:04.080> seem<00:01:04.259> to<00:01:04.409> think<00:01:04.589> it<00:01:04.830> helps<00:01:05.549> so<00:01:05.880> I<00:01:05.909> then

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
you seem to think it helps so I then

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.700 
you seem to think it helps so I then
thought<00:01:06.299> well<00:01:06.719> actually<00:01:06.869> maybe<00:01:07.229> we<00:01:07.499> can<00:01:07.649> look

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710
