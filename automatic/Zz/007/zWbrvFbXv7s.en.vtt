00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
alright this is a potential new project

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:06.980 
alright this is a potential new project
well<00:00:05.339> I<00:00:05.370> really<00:00:05.640> want<00:00:05.790> to<00:00:05.850> make<00:00:06.000> it<00:00:06.270> but<00:00:06.480> this

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
well I really want to make it but this

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.190 
well I really want to make it but this
is<00:00:07.290> a<00:00:07.799> frame<00:00:08.099> I<00:00:08.280> built<00:00:08.550> it<00:00:08.730> was<00:00:08.849> originally<00:00:09.480> had

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
is a frame I built it was originally had

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.990 
is a frame I built it was originally had
petals<00:00:10.620> on<00:00:10.830> it<00:00:11.010> you<00:00:11.519> can<00:00:11.639> see<00:00:11.849> the<00:00:11.969> bottom

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
petals on it you can see the bottom

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.720 
petals on it you can see the bottom
bracket<00:00:12.690> right<00:00:12.780> there<00:00:13.049> and<00:00:13.769> it<00:00:14.070> just<00:00:14.219> ran<00:00:14.460> back

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
bracket right there and it just ran back

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.279 
bracket right there and it just ran back
and<00:00:15.210> I<00:00:15.599> had<00:00:15.870> a<00:00:17.180> plastic<00:00:18.180> on<00:00:18.510> my<00:00:18.539> derailleur<00:00:19.109> and

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
and I had a plastic on my derailleur and

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.250 
and I had a plastic on my derailleur and
stuff<00:00:19.470> on<00:00:19.680> you<00:00:19.890> to<00:00:20.340> change<00:00:20.640> gears<00:00:21.210> I<00:00:21.449> was

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
stuff on you to change gears I was

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.029 
stuff on you to change gears I was
thinking<00:00:22.560> this<00:00:23.359> outdoor<00:00:24.359> gear<00:00:24.800> gives<00:00:25.800> this

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
thinking this outdoor gear gives this

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.700 
thinking this outdoor gear gives this
little<00:00:26.430> engine<00:00:26.849> that<00:00:27.060> right<00:00:27.810> gearing<00:00:28.439> to<00:00:28.590> be

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
little engine that right gearing to be

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.040 
little engine that right gearing to be
able<00:00:28.800> to<00:00:29.010> propel<00:00:29.369> this<00:00:29.640> thing<00:00:29.939> so<00:00:30.869> I<00:00:30.900> was

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
able to propel this thing so I was

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.650 
able to propel this thing so I was
thinking<00:00:31.199> if<00:00:31.560> I<00:00:31.740> leave<00:00:32.009> it<00:00:32.160> as<00:00:32.250> is<00:00:33.120> and<00:00:33.149> run<00:00:33.600> a

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
thinking if I leave it as is and run a

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.520 
thinking if I leave it as is and run a
chain<00:00:34.079> with<00:00:34.710> little<00:00:35.280> engine<00:00:35.820> I<00:00:36.290> might<00:00:37.290> be<00:00:37.410> able

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
chain with little engine I might be able

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.020 
chain with little engine I might be able
to<00:00:37.910> make<00:00:38.910> this<00:00:39.120> thing<00:00:39.329> goes<00:00:40.340> the<00:00:41.340> equivalent

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
to make this thing goes the equivalent

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.950 
to make this thing goes the equivalent
of<00:00:42.180> a<00:00:42.890> basically<00:00:43.890> a<00:00:43.980> 2010<00:00:44.579> 8<00:00:44.820> but<00:00:45.570> it<00:00:45.660> has<00:00:45.780> no

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
of a basically a 2010 8 but it has no

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.229 
of a basically a 2010 8 but it has no
rim<00:00:46.289> it's<00:00:46.559> all<00:00:46.739> rubber<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.789> there's<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.059> metal

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 
rim it's all rubber and there's a metal

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:52.510 
rim it's all rubber and there's a metal
circle<00:00:51.239> in<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.390> middle<00:00:51.449> of<00:00:51.690> three<00:00:51.840> holes<00:00:52.140> and

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:52.520 
circle in the middle of three holes and

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.760 
circle in the middle of three holes and
it<00:00:53.520> actually<00:00:53.879> it's<00:00:54.180> office<00:00:54.480> 6<00:00:54.690> a-6<00:00:55.289> wheeler

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
it actually it's office 6 a-6 wheeler

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.430 
it actually it's office 6 a-6 wheeler
and<00:00:55.980> I<00:00:56.910> had<00:00:57.149> to<00:00:57.270> make<00:00:57.420> this<00:00:57.600> Center<00:00:57.960> spindle

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
and I had to make this Center spindle

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.340 
and I had to make this Center spindle
and<00:00:58.530> stuff<00:00:58.770> like<00:00:58.890> I<00:00:59.190> got<00:01:00.030> two<00:01:00.329> big<00:01:00.480> washers<00:01:01.079> and

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
and stuff like I got two big washers and

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.640 
and stuff like I got two big washers and
I<00:01:01.890> made<00:01:02.129> half<00:01:02.520> of<00:01:02.640> this<00:01:02.760> spindle<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.619> then<00:01:04.619> I

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
I made half of this spindle and then I

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.109 
I made half of this spindle and then I
made<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.100> other<00:01:05.189> half<00:01:05.460> of<00:01:05.489> this<00:01:05.640> middle<00:01:05.939> and<00:01:06.060> I

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
made the other half of this middle and I

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.120 
made the other half of this middle and I
made<00:01:06.330> them<00:01:06.479> bolt<00:01:06.720> together<00:01:06.900> around<00:01:07.830> the

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
made them bolt together around the

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.429 
made them bolt together around the
center<00:01:08.490> piece<00:01:08.670> I<00:01:08.970> cut<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.510> hub<00:01:09.780> in<00:01:09.930> half<00:01:10.140> and

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
center piece I cut a hub in half and

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.080 
center piece I cut a hub in half and
welded<00:01:10.770> one<00:01:10.920> half<00:01:11.130> on<00:01:11.340> here<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:11.820> one<00:01:12.780> half

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
welded one half on here and one half

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.940 
welded one half on here and one half
over<00:01:15.090> here<00:01:15.560> so<00:01:16.560> that<00:01:16.740> it<00:01:16.920> coasts<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.520> this<00:01:18.479> is

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
over here so that it coasts and this is

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.429 
over here so that it coasts and this is
is<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:20.009> three-wheeler<00:01:20.850> front<00:01:21.299> end<00:01:21.479> that's<00:01:22.320> just

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
is a three-wheeler front end that's just

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.609 
is a three-wheeler front end that's just
a<00:01:22.590> tariff<00:01:22.979> tired<00:01:23.189> 2010<00:01:23.729> 8<00:01:23.960> but<00:01:24.960> this<00:01:25.170> is<00:01:25.380> air

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
a tariff tired 2010 8 but this is air

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.999 
a tariff tired 2010 8 but this is air
suspension<00:01:26.570> fun<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:27.780> you<00:01:27.930> can<00:01:27.960> literally<00:01:28.650> air

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
suspension fun and you can literally air

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:34.160 
suspension fun and you can literally air
suspension<00:01:29.520> you<00:01:32.210> can<00:01:33.210> fill<00:01:33.450> these<00:01:33.630> hook<00:01:34.049> the

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
suspension you can fill these hook the

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.060 
suspension you can fill these hook the
compressor<00:01:34.590> on<00:01:34.740> it's<00:01:35.070> just<00:01:35.220> like<00:01:35.310> a<00:01:35.400> bike<00:01:35.610> and

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
compressor on it's just like a bike and

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.539 
compressor on it's just like a bike and
just<00:01:38.420> like<00:01:39.420> any<00:01:39.570> tire<00:01:39.840> he's<00:01:40.229> you<00:01:40.650> know<00:01:40.680> coke

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
just like any tire he's you know coke

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.830 
just like any tire he's you know coke
can<00:01:41.759> place<00:01:41.939> running<00:01:42.150> air<00:01:42.360> it<00:01:42.479> up<00:01:42.890> but<00:01:43.890> uh

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
can place running air it up but uh

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.990 
can place running air it up but uh
thinking<00:01:45.840> I<00:01:46.049> might<00:01:46.470> I<00:01:46.619> might<00:01:47.509> make<00:01:48.509> this<00:01:48.899> I

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
thinking I might I might make this I

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.620 
thinking I might I might make this I
don't<00:01:51.000> know<00:01:51.060> I<00:01:51.090> was<00:01:51.570> also<00:01:51.780> thinking<00:01:52.610> this<00:01:53.630> this

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
don't know I was also thinking this this

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.410 
don't know I was also thinking this this
thing<00:01:54.659> over<00:01:55.079> here<00:01:55.229> I<00:01:55.710> was<00:01:56.490> thinking<00:01:56.520> if<00:01:56.880> I<00:01:57.060> cut

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
thing over here I was thinking if I cut

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.600 
thing over here I was thinking if I cut
if<00:01:58.140> I<00:01:58.320> got<00:01:58.500> another<00:01:58.890> one<00:01:59.100> of<00:01:59.250> these<00:01:59.369> with<00:02:00.270> the

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
if I got another one of these with the

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.819 
if I got another one of these with the
chain<00:02:02.610> case<00:02:02.909> on<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.450> opposite<00:02:03.869> side<00:02:04.110> take

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
chain case on the opposite side take

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.029 
chain case on the opposite side take
this<00:02:05.009> out<00:02:05.250> and<00:02:05.600> flip<00:02:06.600> it<00:02:06.630> some<00:02:07.350> chain<00:02:07.560> cases<00:02:07.920> on

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
this out and flip it some chain cases on

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.240 
this out and flip it some chain cases on
the<00:02:08.129> other<00:02:08.280> side<00:02:08.550> and<00:02:09.119> I<00:02:09.209> cut<00:02:09.479> these<00:02:09.660> off<00:02:09.720> here

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
the other side and I cut these off here

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.860 
the other side and I cut these off here
and<00:02:11.400> cut<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:11.820> phone<00:02:12.000> off<00:02:12.030> so<00:02:12.360> it<00:02:12.420> was<00:02:12.540> track

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
and cut the phone off so it was track

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.870 
and cut the phone off so it was track
all<00:02:13.320> the<00:02:13.680> way<00:02:13.740> around<00:02:13.860> to<00:02:14.190> cut<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.490> top<00:02:14.700> of<00:02:14.820> the

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
all the way around to cut the top of the

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.970 
all the way around to cut the top of the
tunnel<00:02:15.210> off<00:02:15.330> right<00:02:16.080> and<00:02:16.260> then<00:02:16.560> make<00:02:16.770> my<00:02:16.950> own

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
tunnel off right and then make my own

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.790 
tunnel off right and then make my own
braces<00:02:17.670> I'd<00:02:18.030> be<00:02:18.240> able<00:02:18.390> to<00:02:18.450> put<00:02:18.660> them<00:02:18.840> side<00:02:19.770> by

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
braces I'd be able to put them side by

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.640 
braces I'd be able to put them side by
side<00:02:20.240> with<00:02:21.240> one<00:02:21.510> shaft<00:02:21.840> in<00:02:22.140> between<00:02:22.470> each

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
side with one shaft in between each

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.190 
side with one shaft in between each
crankcase<00:02:23.220> right<00:02:24.150> and<00:02:24.390> that<00:02:24.540> single<00:02:24.930> shaft

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
crankcase right and that single shaft

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.160 
crankcase right and that single shaft
would<00:02:25.800> have<00:02:25.860> a<00:02:26.010> limited-slip<00:02:26.460> dear<00:02:26.910> box<00:02:27.170> with

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
would have a limited-slip dear box with

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.050 
would have a limited-slip dear box with
a<00:02:28.200> break<00:02:28.500> on<00:02:28.709> each<00:02:29.040> side<00:02:29.340> of<00:02:29.370> it<00:02:29.640> it's<00:02:29.940> like<00:02:30.030> a

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
a break on each side of it it's like a

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.699 
a break on each side of it it's like a
break<00:02:30.360> one<00:02:30.630> side<00:02:30.870> and<00:02:31.080> it<00:02:31.140> would<00:02:31.260> only<00:02:31.380> power

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
break one side and it would only power

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.130 
break one side and it would only power
the<00:02:31.860> other<00:02:32.100> side<00:02:32.540> so<00:02:33.540> it's<00:02:33.690> like<00:02:33.810> a<00:02:33.840> little

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
the other side so it's like a little

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.690 
the other side so it's like a little
like<00:02:34.320> the<00:02:34.440> PTV<00:02:34.860> the<00:02:35.070> personal<00:02:35.490> tracked

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
like the PTV the personal tracked

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.750 
like the PTV the personal tracked
vehicle<00:02:36.090> I've<00:02:36.180> seen<00:02:36.420> on<00:02:36.630> on<00:02:37.430> youtube<00:02:38.430> and<00:02:38.670> i

was thinking you'll do that with these
tracks<00:02:40.920> these<00:02:41.100> are<00:02:41.220> a<00:02:41.280> lot<00:02:41.459> more<00:02:41.490> beefy<00:02:42.000> than

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
tracks these are a lot more beefy than

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.560 
tracks these are a lot more beefy than
is<00:02:42.360> this<00:02:42.570> is<00:02:42.750> this<00:02:43.320> has<00:02:43.940> something<00:02:44.940> to<00:02:45.120> it<00:02:45.450> you

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
break here and just throw another disc

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.080

on<00:03:57.239> the<00:03:57.360> other<00:03:57.480> side<00:03:57.810> that<00:03:58.910> equal<00:03:59.910> you<00:04:00.060> know

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
on the other side that equal you know

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:01.640 
on the other side that equal you know
and<00:04:00.390> then<00:04:00.540> you<00:04:00.570> just<00:04:00.780> have<00:04:00.840> your<00:04:01.019> handles<00:04:01.470> and

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
and then you just have your handles and

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.920 
and then you just have your handles and
your<00:04:01.739> handles<00:04:02.160> well<00:04:02.790> literally<00:04:03.150> instead<00:04:03.840> of

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
your handles well literally instead of

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.190 
your handles well literally instead of
having<00:04:04.110> cable<00:04:04.530> or<00:04:05.310> something<00:04:05.760> to<00:04:06.019> pull<00:04:07.019> your

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
having cable or something to pull your

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.199 
having cable or something to pull your
brakes<00:04:07.500> it<00:04:08.190> would<00:04:08.400> just<00:04:08.430> use<00:04:08.670> the<00:04:08.820> lever<00:04:09.030> to

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
brakes it would just use the lever to

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:13.039 
brakes it would just use the lever to
pull<00:04:09.360> the<00:04:09.480> cable<00:04:09.870> so<00:04:10.079> it's<00:04:10.430> you<00:04:11.430> know<00:04:11.670> I<00:04:12.049> think

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049 
pull the cable so it's you know I think

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:15.050 
pull the cable so it's you know I think
that'd<00:04:13.260> be<00:04:13.380> really<00:04:13.560> cool<00:04:13.680> to<00:04:13.950> cruise<00:04:14.430> around<00:04:14.489> I

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
that'd be really cool to cruise around I

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:16.940 
that'd be really cool to cruise around I
got<00:04:15.480> all<00:04:15.600> these<00:04:15.750> trails<00:04:16.140> I<00:04:16.410> got<00:04:16.530> a<00:04:16.560> big<00:04:16.709> field

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
got all these trails I got a big field

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.610 
got all these trails I got a big field
next<00:04:17.220> or<00:04:17.519> to<00:04:18.359> cruise<00:04:18.600> around<00:04:18.630> here<00:04:19.260> and

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
next or to cruise around here and

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.680 
next or to cruise around here and
I<00:04:19.680> think<00:04:20.430> that'd<00:04:20.579> be<00:04:20.729> the<00:04:21.540> ultimate
