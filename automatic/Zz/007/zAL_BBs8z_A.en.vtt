and you don't really know who these

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:54.920 
and you don't really know who these
people<00:00:54.030> are<00:00:54.210> because<00:00:54.390> they're<00:00:54.539> unnamed

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
people are because they're unnamed

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.080

under playing that has to do with

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.600 
under playing that has to do with
Carmela's<00:01:06.600> personality<00:01:07.350> is<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:08.130> idea<00:01:08.549> that

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
Carmela's personality is the idea that

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.840

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
would really struggle with the idea of

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.350 
would really struggle with the idea of
bringing<00:01:25.650> him<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:25.860> another<00:01:26.189> city<00:01:26.580> having<00:01:27.240> him

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
bringing him to another city having him

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.060 
bringing him to another city having him
have<00:01:27.960> to<00:01:28.020> get<00:01:28.350> used<00:01:28.560> to<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:28.770> new<00:01:28.829> environment

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
have to get used to a new environment

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.819 
have to get used to a new environment
having<00:01:29.939> them<00:01:30.210> have<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.509> make<00:01:30.689> new<00:01:31.140> friends<00:01:31.680> I

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
having them have to make new friends I

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.170 
having them have to make new friends I
think<00:01:32.040> that's<00:01:32.220> one<00:01:32.430> factor<00:01:32.700> here<00:01:32.970> that's

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
think that's one factor here that's

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.730 
think that's one factor here that's
going<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.450> weigh<00:01:33.630> on<00:01:33.810> Carmelo<00:01:34.140> throughout<00:01:34.590> the

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
going to weigh on Carmelo throughout the

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.100 
going to weigh on Carmelo throughout the
process<00:01:34.979> if<00:01:35.549> I<00:01:35.700> gave<00:01:35.939> you<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.180> Knicks<00:01:36.750> or<00:01:36.990> the

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
process if I gave you the Knicks or the

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.590 
process if I gave you the Knicks or the
field<00:01:37.530> right<00:01:38.040> now<00:01:38.280> what<00:01:38.939> would<00:01:39.000> you<00:01:39.090> take<00:01:39.299> I

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
field right now what would you take I

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.539 
field right now what would you take I
would<00:01:40.500> take<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:41.009> Knicks<00:01:41.310> a<00:01:42.409> 51-percent<00:01:43.549> field

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
would take the Knicks a 51-percent field

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.460 
would take the Knicks a 51-percent field
at<00:01:44.850> forty-nine<00:01:45.450> percent<00:01:45.659> how's<00:01:46.049> that<00:01:46.259> for<00:01:46.409> a

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
at forty-nine percent how's that for a

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.190 
at forty-nine percent how's that for a

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
makes an advantage I think Phil knows

makes an advantage I think Phil knows
that<00:02:16.140> I<00:02:16.170> think<00:02:16.560> he'll<00:02:16.710> end<00:02:16.950> up<00:02:17.040> offering<00:02:17.310> on

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
that I think he'll end up offering on

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.610 
that I think he'll end up offering on
the<00:02:17.700> max<00:02:17.940> as<00:02:18.240> far<00:02:18.630> as<00:02:18.660> whether<00:02:18.960> he<00:02:19.170> wants<00:02:19.470> him

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
the max as far as whether he wants him

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.680 
the max as far as whether he wants him
back<00:02:19.860> or<00:02:20.070> not<00:02:20.190> I<00:02:20.400> think<00:02:20.850> he<00:02:20.940> definitely<00:02:21.120> wants

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
back or not I think he definitely wants

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.630 
back or not I think he definitely wants
him<00:02:21.780> back<00:02:21.990> because<00:02:22.200> it's<00:02:22.530> easier<00:02:22.980> to<00:02:23.430> build

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
him back because it's easier to build

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.000 
him back because it's easier to build
around<00:02:23.850> Carmelo<00:02:24.510> Anthony<00:02:25.020> are<00:02:25.260> sure<00:02:25.650> thing

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
than it is to roll the dice in free

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.100 
than it is to roll the dice in free
agency<00:02:28.410> in<00:02:29.030> 2015<00:02:30.030> but<00:02:30.360> i<00:02:30.450> should<00:02:30.660> add<00:02:30.810> this

favorite<00:05:39.870> at<00:05:39.960> this<00:05:40.080> point<00:05:40.320> because<00:05:40.500> he<00:05:40.770> knows

that come 2015 that nyx will have the

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:46.580 
that come 2015 that nyx will have the
cap<00:05:44.010> space<00:05:44.310> to<00:05:44.669> add<00:05:45.150> a<00:05:45.180> star<00:05:45.840> player<00:05:46.080> around

think<00:05:48.960> he<00:05:49.050> trusts<00:05:49.470> in<00:05:49.590> Phil<00:05:49.800> he<00:05:49.830> instead<00:05:50.610> of

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:50.760 
think he trusts in Phil he instead of

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.580 
think he trusts in Phil he instead of
gotten<00:05:51.060> close<00:05:51.360> throughout<00:05:52.080> this<00:05:52.290> process

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:52.590 
gotten close throughout this process

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:54.860 
gotten close throughout this process
which<00:05:53.130> is<00:05:53.280> why<00:05:53.430> I<00:05:53.490> think<00:05:53.880> at<00:05:54.390> the<00:05:54.600> end<00:05:54.630> of<00:05:54.780> the

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:54.870 
which is why I think at the end of the

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:56.590 
which is why I think at the end of the
day<00:05:54.990> come<00:05:55.260> L<00:05:55.380> will<00:05:55.410> be<00:05:55.650> back<00:05:55.830> in<00:05:56.010> New<00:05:56.130> York<00:05:56.340> I

ends up in New York or at least that's
the<00:06:01.650> that's<00:06:01.919> the<00:06:02.100> grand<00:06:02.400> plan<00:06:02.669> to<00:06:02.850> Phil

now<00:06:37.380> they<00:06:38.220> tried<00:06:38.520> this<00:06:38.700> in<00:06:38.880> 2010<00:06:39.599> it<00:06:39.960> did<00:06:40.200> not

00:06:40.339 --> 00:06:40.349 
now they tried this in 2010 it did not

00:06:40.349 --> 00:06:41.380 
now they tried this in 2010 it did not
work<00:06:40.560> out<00:06:40.770> into<00:06:41.099> that

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:43.540 
work out into that
10<00:06:41.660> but<00:06:41.870> it's<00:06:42.050> different<00:06:42.500> with<00:06:42.800> Carmelo<00:06:43.310> there

10 but it's different with Carmelo there

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:45.280 
10 but it's different with Carmelo there
because<00:06:43.820> Carmelo<00:06:44.180> would<00:06:44.360> be<00:06:44.450> a<00:06:44.480> big<00:06:44.780> draw<00:06:45.020> for

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:45.290
