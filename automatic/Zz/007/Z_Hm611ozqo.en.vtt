this<00:02:01.929> in<00:02:02.140> place<00:02:02.259> completely<00:02:02.770> but<00:02:03.759> if<00:02:03.850> you

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
this in place completely but if you

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
don't have it friction isn't working you

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:08.699 
don't have it friction isn't working you
want<00:02:07.030> to<00:02:07.149> make<00:02:07.299> sure<00:02:07.330> that<00:02:07.659> the<00:02:07.780> person's<00:02:08.229> arms

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
want to make sure that the person's arms

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:11.100 
want to make sure that the person's arms
are<00:02:08.890> secured<00:02:09.310> around<00:02:09.459> the<00:02:09.759> outside<00:02:10.330> so<00:02:10.690> that

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
are secured around the outside so that

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.710 
are secured around the outside so that
it<00:02:11.410> doesn't<00:02:11.769> unravel<00:02:12.150> and<00:02:13.150> this<00:02:13.299> is<00:02:13.450> a<00:02:13.480> real

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
it doesn't unravel and this is a real

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.720 
it doesn't unravel and this is a real
quick<00:02:14.019> impromptu<00:02:14.560> way<00:02:15.010> you<00:02:15.400> know<00:02:15.489> if<00:02:15.640> you

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
quick impromptu way you know if you

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.550 
quick impromptu way you know if you
don't<00:02:15.850> have<00:02:16.000> to<00:02:16.150> carry<00:02:16.390> somebody<00:02:16.690> just

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
don't have to carry somebody just

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.640 
don't have to carry somebody just
extremely<00:02:18.040> long<00:02:18.400> distances<00:02:19.170> but<00:02:20.170> you<00:02:20.319> can<00:02:20.500> get

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
extremely long distances but you can get

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.080 
extremely long distances but you can get
them<00:02:20.769> out<00:02:20.860> of<00:02:20.920> the<00:02:21.069> woods<00:02:21.250> with<00:02:21.459> a<00:02:21.489> broken<00:02:21.910> leg

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
them out of the woods with a broken leg

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.600 
them out of the woods with a broken leg
or<00:02:22.269> something<00:02:22.660> like<00:02:22.810> that<00:02:26.220> all<00:02:27.220> right<00:02:27.370> so

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
or something like that all right so

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:28.860 
or something like that all right so
that's<00:02:27.730> how<00:02:27.880> you<00:02:28.030> throw<00:02:28.299> it<00:02:28.390> together<00:02:28.660> an

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
that's how you throw it together an

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.870 
that's how you throw it together an
improvised<00:02:29.260> litter<00:02:29.620> with<00:02:29.829> nothing<00:02:30.160> but<00:02:30.340> two

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
improvised litter with nothing but two

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.150 
improvised litter with nothing but two
logs<00:02:31.150> and<00:02:31.480> a<00:02:31.540> tarp<00:02:31.840> and<00:02:31.989> basically<00:02:32.799> what<00:02:33.040> we're

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
logs and a tarp and basically what we're

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.140 
logs and a tarp and basically what we're
going<00:02:33.250> to<00:02:33.310> do<00:02:33.459> now<00:02:33.640> is<00:02:33.820> we're<00:02:33.970> going<00:02:34.060> to

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
going to do now is we're going to

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:35.789 
going to do now is we're going to
transition<00:02:34.570> into<00:02:34.810> a<00:02:35.019> second<00:02:35.440> part<00:02:35.650> of<00:02:35.709> the
