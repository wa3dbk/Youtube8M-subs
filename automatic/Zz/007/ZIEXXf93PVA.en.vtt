00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:04.939 
bits of trickery on here because I love

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:07.149 
bits of trickery on here because I love
this<00:02:05.209> one<00:02:05.450> I<00:02:05.719> really<00:02:06.409> that<00:02:06.590> this<00:02:06.859> really

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159

caught my eye

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:10.719 
caught my eye
you've<00:02:08.539> got<00:02:08.840> what<00:02:09.530> looks<00:02:09.710> like<00:02:09.890> some<00:02:10.250> silicon

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
you've got what looks like some silicon

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.040 
you've got what looks like some silicon
tubing<00:02:11.150> that<00:02:11.300> you've<00:02:11.420> threaded<00:02:11.660> up<00:02:11.870> the

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
tubing that you've threaded up the

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.770 
tubing that you've threaded up the
hooklink<00:02:12.230> yeah<00:02:13.010> and<00:02:13.160> then<00:02:13.280> concertina<00:02:13.970> the<00:02:14.180> up

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
hooklink yeah and then concertina the up

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.960 
hooklink yeah and then concertina the up
yeah<00:02:14.900> so<00:02:15.140> it's<00:02:15.260> so<00:02:15.530> it's<00:02:15.650> a<00:02:15.950> bit<00:02:16.130> textured<00:02:16.730> in<00:02:16.910> a

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
yeah so it's so it's a bit textured in a

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.580 
yeah so it's so it's a bit textured in a
bit<00:02:17.360> yeah<00:02:17.600> what's<00:02:18.020> what's<00:02:18.230> the<00:02:18.380> thinking

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
bit yeah what's what's the thinking

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.860 
bit yeah what's what's the thinking
behind<00:02:18.830> that<00:02:19.130> the<00:02:19.790> thinking<00:02:20.150> behind<00:02:20.240> that<00:02:20.660> is

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
behind that the thinking behind that is

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.480 
behind that the thinking behind that is
that<00:02:21.550> I've<00:02:22.550> saw<00:02:23.240> it<00:02:23.420> from<00:02:24.020> a<00:02:24.110> boat<00:02:24.410> starts

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.490 
that I've saw it from a boat starts

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.059 
that I've saw it from a boat starts
little<00:02:26.060> little<00:02:26.390> tweaks<00:02:26.780> like<00:02:27.050> these<00:02:27.560> little

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
little little tweaks like these little

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:30.010 
little little tweaks like these little
tweaks<00:02:28.250> on<00:02:28.490> the<00:02:28.610> ground<00:02:28.850> right<00:02:29.390> and<00:02:29.630> I<00:02:29.720> want<00:02:29.930> to

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
tweaks on the ground right and I want to

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.460 
tweaks on the ground right and I want to
match<00:02:30.290> all<00:02:31.280> my<00:02:31.580> stuff<00:02:31.880> likes<00:02:32.690> it<00:02:32.870> tweaks<00:02:33.050> right

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
okay so you you see the little twigs on

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.330 
okay so you you see the little twigs on
the<00:02:35.930> spots<00:02:36.260> and<00:02:36.470> not<00:02:36.560> completely<00:02:37.069> clean

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
the spots and not completely clean

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.460 
the spots and not completely clean
little<00:02:38.000> bits<00:02:38.209> and<00:02:38.360> you're<00:02:38.480> trying<00:02:38.750> to<00:02:38.870> break

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:04.210 
big mix of of different baits yep when I

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:06.360 
big mix of of different baits yep when I
go<00:05:04.450> for<00:05:04.660> spotting<00:05:05.050> yes<00:05:05.380> you<00:05:05.590> know<00:05:05.770> you<00:05:06.220> know

go for spotting yes you know you know
better<00:05:06.610> than<00:05:06.850> me<00:05:07.030> one<00:05:07.690> day<00:05:07.840> is<00:05:07.960> this<00:05:08.110> bait<00:05:08.320> is

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:08.350 
better than me one day is this bait is

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:08.760 
better than me one day is this bait is
better

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:08.770 
better

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:10.320 
better

yeah next day the other bait is better
okay<00:05:10.660> I<00:05:10.690> put<00:05:11.050> two<00:05:11.229> different<00:05:11.650> baits<00:05:11.830> I<00:05:12.070> have

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:12.340 
okay I put two different baits I have

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:13.980 
okay I put two different baits I have
different<00:05:12.760> options<00:05:13.090> right<00:05:13.389> okay

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:19.419 
last one again that you've got the party

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:20.730 
last one again that you've got the party
on<00:05:19.510> it<00:05:19.539> and<00:05:19.750> everything<00:05:20.050> else<00:05:20.229> but<00:05:20.470> the<00:05:20.530> thing

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:20.740 
on it and everything else but the thing

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.680 
on it and everything else but the thing
I<00:05:20.860> liked<00:05:21.130> about<00:05:21.310> this<00:05:21.610> one<00:05:21.850> is<00:05:22.060> how<00:05:22.300> the<00:05:22.360> hook

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:22.690 
I liked about this one is how the hook

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:25.110 
I liked about this one is how the hook
turned<00:05:23.190> just<00:05:24.190> that<00:05:24.310> you've<00:05:24.430> got<00:05:24.520> a<00:05:24.550> cha<00:05:24.760> D<00:05:24.820> hook

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.120 
turned just that you've got a cha D hook

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.510 
turned just that you've got a cha D hook
on<00:05:25.270> this<00:05:25.479> on<00:05:25.660> out<00:05:25.810> so<00:05:26.020> and<00:05:26.169> da<00:05:26.320> hook<00:05:26.650> but<00:05:27.370> look

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:27.520 
on this on out so and da hook but look

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.790 
on this on out so and da hook but look
look<00:05:27.880> at<00:05:28.060> I<00:05:28.210> mean<00:05:28.240> it's<00:05:28.720> not<00:05:28.870> even<00:05:29.560> the<00:05:29.650> weight

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:29.800 
look at I mean it's not even the weight

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.170 
look at I mean it's not even the weight
of<00:05:29.949> the<00:05:30.010> bite<00:05:30.220> doesn't<00:05:30.250> seem<00:05:30.760> to<00:05:30.880> be<00:05:31.000> making

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:31.180 
of the bite doesn't seem to be making

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.270 
of the bite doesn't seem to be making
the<00:05:31.419> difference<00:05:31.780> he's<00:05:31.930> just<00:05:32.169> so<00:05:32.979> what<00:05:33.130> made

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.280 
the difference he's just so what made

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.640 
the difference he's just so what made
you<00:05:33.400> come<00:05:33.520> up<00:05:33.669> with<00:05:33.700> that<00:05:33.870> this<00:05:34.870> one<00:05:35.139> turns

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:35.650 
you come up with that this one turns

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:36.870 
you come up with that this one turns
really<00:05:36.010> really<00:05:36.370> quickly

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:36.880 
really really quickly

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.750 
really really quickly
yeah<00:05:37.150> and<00:05:37.360> I've<00:05:38.169> got<00:05:38.229> here<00:05:38.680> a<00:05:38.710> small<00:05:39.160> small

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:39.760 
yeah and I've got here a small small

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:40.230 
yeah and I've got here a small small
loop

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240 
loop

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.210 
loop
yeah<00:05:40.479> four<00:05:40.840> four<00:05:41.169> hinge<00:05:41.410> for<00:05:41.680> the<00:05:41.800> movement

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:42.220 
yeah four four hinge for the movement

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:46.770 
yeah four four hinge for the movement
okay<00:05:42.610> and<00:05:43.620> the<00:05:44.620> thinking<00:05:45.130> behind<00:05:45.220> that<00:05:45.520> is<00:05:45.880> it

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:46.780 
okay and the thinking behind that is it

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:48.900 
okay and the thinking behind that is it
turns<00:05:47.229> really<00:05:47.889> really<00:05:48.099> quickly<00:05:48.340> yeah<00:05:48.639> it<00:05:48.700> does

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:48.910 
turns really really quickly yeah it does

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:53.279 
turns really really quickly yeah it does
and<00:05:51.150> you<00:05:52.150> know<00:05:52.180> I<00:05:52.300> wouldn't<00:05:52.660> expect<00:05:52.960> that<00:05:53.080> for

00:05:53.279 --> 00:05:53.289 
and you know I wouldn't expect that for

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:55.020 
and you know I wouldn't expect that for
a<00:05:53.349> hook<00:05:53.500> with<00:05:53.650> an<00:05:53.770> out<00:05:53.889> turned<00:05:54.190> I<00:05:54.370> like<00:05:54.639> a<00:05:54.669> cha<00:05:54.970> D

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:55.030 
a hook with an out turned I like a cha D

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:57.779 
a hook with an out turned I like a cha D
but<00:05:55.410> it's<00:05:56.410> amazing<00:05:56.979> there<00:05:57.130> quickly<00:05:57.370> it<00:05:57.610> does

00:05:57.779 --> 00:05:57.789 
but it's amazing there quickly it does

00:05:57.789 --> 00:05:59.310 
but it's amazing there quickly it does
turn<00:05:58.060> yeah<00:05:58.479> amazing

00:05:59.310 --> 00:05:59.320 
turn yeah amazing

a little bit you were probably a bit

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:09.870 
a little bit you were probably a bit
mislaid<00:06:08.650> by<00:06:08.800> the<00:06:08.860> last<00:06:09.099> time<00:06:09.340> we<00:06:09.460> fished<00:06:09.669> here

mislaid by the last time we fished here
I<00:06:10.180> was<00:06:10.660> spotting<00:06:10.900> I<00:06:11.320> was<00:06:11.800> catching<00:06:12.039> I've<00:06:12.669> come
