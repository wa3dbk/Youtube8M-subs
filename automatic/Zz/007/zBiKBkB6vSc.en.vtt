00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.150
 what i like is my job is that it 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.099
 to work directly with people 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.389
 I know that I did it well 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.280
 if the participant then comes to me 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.379
 and says 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.570
 Coach that was the best course I have 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:19.880
 Ever made then we have ours 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.040
 job made machine is one thing though 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.689
 I know little about machines like that 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.119
 to deal with technology that is yes 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:27.770
 just as important and only recently 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:29.660
 I passed the participant in the course 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:32.090
 and we have about one 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.800
 error message talked he tells me because 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.730
 This error message he has three days 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.290
 the machine lost 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.300
 three days where the machine is not 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.430
 could produce and that is for me 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:44.360
 the tangible that thereby the 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.949
 My name is going home faster 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.960
 sebastian is pure and I'm here in 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:50.300
 training center nuremberg trainer for 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.929
 machine tools technique my goal im 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:56.899
 Course it is there that we are the half 

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:58.940
 the time that something to know recorded 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:02.620
 will also be reintroduced together 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:04.850
 or individually on our hardware as 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:08.090
 training expert, I stand on two 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:11.479
 legs once is the technical pillar 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.920
 the product is absolutely topical 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:13.210
 I from my colleagues from the products 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.549
 becomes 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.070
 take along and have on the other side 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:20.440
 I methodical mainstay that is 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.290
 i know how i know this 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.159
 can mediate and on both pillars 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.140
 Let's always try the latest 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:28.720
 to hold what is in mine 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.700
 I see that over the years 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.540
 time and again employees of 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.220
 same companies 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.280
 that means the companies have realized that 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:38.020
 it's a valuable partnership with you 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.300
 siemens in the field further substantiates it 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.590
 is it worth your staff to join us 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.409
 not just once 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.720
 but everyone can come to us again and again 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:50.289
 come regardless if it is now a beginner or 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.670
 already advanced expert in 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:53.679
 to offer the different courses 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.119
 Actually, something for everyone 

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:57.070
 of course we have the expert courses 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:57.670
 huge advantage that we mesh so closely 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.649
 are 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.570
 like product development that means we 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:03.729
 the first ones are the newest 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.590
 Software versions the latest product 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:08.289
 generations actually in the hands 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.640
 have and then for the very 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.830
 advanced participant 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.540
 can prepare accordingly be it 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.730
 that the participants to us here in 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.130
 training center come but we can 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:21.220
 of course also on the spot 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:23.019
 Customers for the customer partly completely 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.840
 individually tailored courses 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:26.280
 discourage drive technology 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.000
 automation technology 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.060
 communication technology as well 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.280
 process control sensor technology what we 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.500
 have as products in training properly 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.959
 It's great to see if I'm exactly 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.400
 works under participants that also notes 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:44.680
 that the night a week course 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.680
 Much better than it was at the beginning
