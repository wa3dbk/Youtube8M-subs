like long straightaways you know really

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.209 
like long straightaways you know really
tight<00:00:47.969> breaking<00:00:48.270> and<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:48.870> much<00:00:49.649> much<00:00:49.890> faster

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219

straight<00:00:50.760> away<00:00:50.910> so<00:00:50.969> i<00:00:51.090> think<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.420> fans<00:00:51.660> are

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
straight away so i think the fans are

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.110 
straight away so i think the fans are
going<00:00:52.020> to<00:00:52.110> see<00:00:52.350> really<00:00:52.649> you<00:00:53.430> know<00:00:53.550> all<00:00:53.730> we<00:00:53.910> can

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
going to see really you know all we can

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.610

that's fun for them but also i think the

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.910 
that's fun for them but also i think the
layout<00:00:58.680> is<00:00:59.090> is<00:01:00.090> going<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.539> help<00:01:00.780> you<00:01:01.530> know<00:01:01.680> like

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
layout is is going to help you know like

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.410 
layout is is going to help you know like
slow<00:01:02.250> us<00:01:02.430> down<00:01:02.460> you<00:01:02.940> know<00:01:03.059> at<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.239> end<00:01:03.270> of

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
slow us down you know at the end of

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.759 
slow us down you know at the end of
those<00:01:03.570> long<00:01:03.809> straightaway<00:01:04.260> so<00:01:04.439> it's<00:01:04.559> going<00:01:04.710> to

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
those long straightaway so it's going to

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.969 
those long straightaway so it's going to
improve<00:01:04.890> passing<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.790> runways<00:01:06.180> are<00:01:06.210> wide<00:01:06.570> and

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
improve passing the runways are wide and

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:09.859 
improve passing the runways are wide and
i<00:01:07.979> really<00:01:08.460> expect<00:01:08.880> like<00:01:09.119> lots<00:01:09.510> of<00:01:09.689> action

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
i really expect like lots of action

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.080 
i really expect like lots of action
probably<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.590> most<00:01:11.070> action<00:01:11.310> that<00:01:11.640> we<00:01:11.729> can<00:01:11.909> see

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
probably the most action that we can see

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.580 
probably the most action that we can see
all<00:01:12.240> season<00:01:12.479> long<00:01:12.780> would<00:01:13.020> probably<00:01:13.380> come<00:01:13.560> from

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
all season long would probably come from

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.770 
all season long would probably come from
that<00:01:13.920> track<00:01:14.220> if<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:15.119> layout<00:01:15.420> that<00:01:15.600> i've<00:01:15.750> seen

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
that track if the layout that i've seen

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.370 
that track if the layout that i've seen
on<00:01:16.140> paper<00:01:16.409> is<00:01:16.770> uh<00:01:17.210> is<00:01:18.210> what<00:01:18.600> it<00:01:18.720> is<00:01:18.750> in<00:01:19.020> real

Remington I've had a lot of success

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.010 
Remington I've had a lot of success
there<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.119> I<00:01:36.210> mean<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.450> track<00:01:36.720> there<00:01:36.900> was

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
there and I mean the track there was

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.719 
there and I mean the track there was
always<00:01:37.110> super<00:01:37.380> fast<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:38.009> super<00:01:38.100> technical

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
always super fast and super technical

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.640 
always super fast and super technical
which<00:01:38.970> I<00:01:39.090> like<00:01:39.329> and<00:01:39.600> super<00:01:39.900> physical<00:01:40.409> which<00:01:40.560> is

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
which I like and super physical which is

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.920 
which I like and super physical which is
another<00:01:40.799> challenge<00:01:41.100> I<00:01:41.400> like<00:01:41.610> that<00:01:41.820> this<00:01:42.689> year

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
another challenge I like that this year

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.480 
another challenge I like that this year
it's<00:01:43.049> a<00:01:43.079> completely<00:01:43.560> different<00:01:43.770> layout<00:01:44.250> so

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
it's a completely different layout so

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.340 
it's a completely different layout so
it's<00:01:44.670> again<00:01:45.000> it's<00:01:45.060> unique<00:01:45.509> and<00:01:45.659> everybody

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
it's again it's unique and everybody

it's again it's unique and everybody
everybody<00:01:46.829> enjoys<00:01:47.040> going<00:01:47.250> on<00:01:47.369> new<00:01:47.460> circuits

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
everybody enjoys going on new circuits

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.069 
everybody enjoys going on new circuits
and<00:01:48.060> trying<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:48.270> learn<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:48.509> new<00:01:48.600> track<00:01:48.869> has

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
and trying to learn the new track has

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.090 
and trying to learn the new track has
every<00:01:49.229> driver<00:01:49.439> thinks<00:01:49.710> they<00:01:49.799> can<00:01:49.890> learn<00:01:50.070> it

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
every driver thinks they can learn it

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.520 
every driver thinks they can learn it
faster<00:01:50.490> than<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.670> other<00:01:50.790> guys<00:01:51.000> you<00:01:51.299> know<00:01:51.390> so<00:01:52.140> I

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
faster than the other guys you know so I

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:53.840 
faster than the other guys you know so I
so<00:01:52.829> I'm<00:01:52.890> really<00:01:52.950> looking<00:01:53.310> forward<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.579> just

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
getting there and it's still going to

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:56.690 
getting there and it's still going to
have<00:01:55.740> a<00:01:55.799> great<00:01:55.920> atmosphere<00:01:56.130> it's<00:01:56.520> a<00:01:56.549> terrific

your ones just looking forward to to
this<00:02:02.399> new<00:02:02.549> circuit
