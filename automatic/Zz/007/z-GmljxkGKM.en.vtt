00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:53.660 
steps to do Jacob's Ladder but we are

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.410 
steps to do Jacob's Ladder but we are
going<00:01:53.960> to<00:01:54.080> do<00:01:54.170> a<00:01:54.200> Jacob's<00:01:54.650> Ladder<00:01:54.860> so<00:01:55.700> you<00:01:56.270> are

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
going to do a Jacob's Ladder so you are

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.940 
going to do a Jacob's Ladder so you are
going<00:01:56.660> to<00:01:56.750> take<00:01:56.990> this<00:01:58.540> first<00:01:59.560> you're<00:02:00.560> going<00:02:00.830> to

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
going to take this first you're going to

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.730 
going to take this first you're going to
take<00:02:01.160> this<00:02:01.880> index<00:02:02.510> string<00:02:02.900> and<00:02:03.140> put<00:02:03.500> it<00:02:03.590> on

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
take this index string and put it on

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.190 
take this index string and put it on
your<00:02:03.890> thumb<00:02:04.100> then<00:02:04.940> take<00:02:05.240> your<00:02:05.450> thumb<00:02:05.810> string

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
your thumb then take your thumb string

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.740 
your thumb then take your thumb string
and<00:02:06.920> take<00:02:07.130> it<00:02:07.310> off<00:02:07.520> your<00:02:07.790> thumb<00:02:08.000> now<00:02:08.660> you

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
and take it off your thumb now you

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.949 
and take it off your thumb now you
should<00:02:09.140> have<00:02:09.170> a<00:02:09.320> little<00:02:09.740> triangle<00:02:10.340> in<00:02:10.760> there

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
should have a little triangle in there

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:14.470 
should have a little triangle in there
do<00:02:11.959> that<00:02:12.200> the<00:02:12.709> same<00:02:12.950> thing<00:02:13.370> with<00:02:14.120> your<00:02:14.330> other

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
do that the same thing with your other

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:20.770 
do that the same thing with your other
hand<00:02:15.550> then<00:02:16.690> this<00:02:17.690> is<00:02:17.930> a<00:02:18.200> hard<00:02:19.130> motion<00:02:19.970> this<00:02:20.570> is

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
hand then this is a hard motion this is

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.449 
hand then this is a hard motion this is
the<00:02:20.959> motion<00:02:21.380> that<00:02:21.560> makes<00:02:21.740> the<00:02:22.100> strength

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
the motion that makes the strength

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:24.850 
the motion that makes the strength
appear<00:02:22.850> hard<00:02:23.209> for<00:02:23.570> some<00:02:23.780> people<00:02:24.170> they<00:02:24.800> are

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
appear hard for some people they are

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.820 
appear hard for some people they are
going<00:02:25.220> to<00:02:25.310> stick<00:02:25.580> your<00:02:25.760> index<00:02:26.300> fingers<00:02:26.750> in<00:02:27.290> the

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
going to stick your index fingers in the

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.880 
going to stick your index fingers in the
triangles<00:02:28.519> now<00:02:29.209> in<00:02:29.390> this<00:02:29.630> motion<00:02:30.290> we're

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
triangles now in this motion we're

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.759 
triangles now in this motion we're
releasing<00:02:31.790> your<00:02:32.239> pinky<00:02:32.720> strings<00:02:33.080> and<00:02:33.470> your

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:33.769 
releasing your pinky strings and your
