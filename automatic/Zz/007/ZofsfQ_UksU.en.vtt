custom tactical com here and then I'm
going<00:00:09.270> to<00:00:09.360> be<00:00:09.450> looking<00:00:09.570> at<00:00:09.809> today<00:00:09.990> is<00:00:10.110> the

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
going to be looking at today is the

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.700 
going to be looking at today is the
Kirby<00:00:11.129> Lambert<00:00:11.490> claw<00:00:12.080> one<00:00:13.080> of<00:00:13.200> Kirby's

Kirby Lambert claw one of Kirby's
smaller<00:00:14.160> designs<00:00:14.870> maybe<00:00:15.870> a<00:00:15.929> little<00:00:15.960> bit

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:16.200 
smaller designs maybe a little bit

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.550 
smaller designs maybe a little bit
earlier<00:00:16.529> than<00:00:16.770> a<00:00:16.980> lot<00:00:17.130> of<00:00:17.250> his<00:00:17.990> new<00:00:18.990> stuff<00:00:19.320> it's

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
earlier than a lot of his new stuff it's

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.190 
earlier than a lot of his new stuff it's
it's<00:00:19.770> probably<00:00:20.279> I<00:00:20.580> would<00:00:20.790> say<00:00:20.910> this<00:00:21.210> is<00:00:21.419> prior

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:22.200 
it's probably I would say this is prior

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:27.260 
it's probably I would say this is prior
to<00:00:22.529> his<00:00:22.680> new<00:00:23.009> generation<00:00:23.700> of<00:00:23.849> of<00:00:25.730> recurve<00:00:26.730> bow

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:27.270 
to his new generation of of recurve bow

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:29.389 
to his new generation of of recurve bow
ated<00:00:27.599> folders<00:00:28.110> which<00:00:28.320> he<00:00:28.829> really<00:00:29.070> likes<00:00:29.250> to

00:00:29.389 --> 00:00:29.399 
ated folders which he really likes to

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:33.709 
ated folders which he really likes to
make<00:00:29.579> now<00:00:29.790> this<00:00:30.390> is<00:00:30.570> a<00:00:31.369> flat<00:00:32.369> ground<00:00:32.700> blade<00:00:32.969> so

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
make now this is a flat ground blade so

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.000 
make now this is a flat ground blade so
it's<00:00:34.079> and<00:00:35.300> doesn't<00:00:36.300> have<00:00:36.420> that<00:00:36.739> that<00:00:37.739> curve

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
it's and doesn't have that that curve

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.560 
it's and doesn't have that that curve
look<00:00:38.250> to<00:00:38.429> it<00:00:38.519> with<00:00:38.670> a<00:00:38.699> hammer<00:00:38.969> of<00:00:39.120> finish<00:00:39.449> on

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
look to it with a hammer of finish on

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.060 
look to it with a hammer of finish on
this<00:00:39.719> one<00:00:41.269> so<00:00:42.269> it's<00:00:42.660> not<00:00:43.260> something<00:00:43.710> we're

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
this one so it's not something we're

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.680 
this one so it's not something we're
seeing<00:00:44.309> a<00:00:44.399> lot<00:00:44.579> of<00:00:44.609> from<00:00:44.910> Kirby<00:00:45.210> anymore<00:00:45.539> these

which<00:00:53.730> is<00:00:53.940> very<00:00:54.600> cool<00:00:56.600> it<00:00:57.600> looks<00:00:57.839> nice<00:00:58.249> it's

00:00:59.239 --> 00:00:59.249

which is very cool it looks nice it's
pretty<00:00:59.640> grippy<00:01:00.089> though<00:01:00.929> i<00:01:01.260> would<00:01:01.499> say

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
pretty grippy though i would say

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.770 
pretty grippy though i would say
marginally<00:01:02.429> less<00:01:02.699> comfortable<00:01:03.269> than<00:01:03.420> a

smooth smooth handles but very cool look
to<00:01:09.930> it<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:10.530> something<00:01:11.190> different<00:01:14.390> so<00:01:15.390> as<00:01:15.540> it's

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
to it and something different so as it's

scales contoured and laid on top you see

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.810

it's<00:01:25.170> fully<00:01:25.620> contoured<00:01:26.190> to<00:01:28.580> Kirby<00:01:29.580> always

it's fully contoured to Kirby always
fully<00:01:30.030> contours<00:01:30.540> his<00:01:30.660> knives<00:01:30.930> unless

requested<00:01:31.830> otherwise<00:01:33.530> it's<00:01:34.530> a<00:01:34.590> nice<00:01:34.740> feature

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:34.980 
requested otherwise it's a nice feature

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.350 
requested otherwise it's a nice feature
a<00:01:35.460> lot<00:01:36.360> extra<00:01:36.630> for<00:01:36.750> it<00:01:36.840> goes<00:01:37.050> into<00:01:37.230> doing<00:01:37.590> that

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
a lot extra for it goes into doing that

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.240 
a lot extra for it goes into doing that
so<00:01:39.360> this<00:01:39.600> one<00:01:39.720> has<00:01:39.870> the<00:01:39.900> recurve<00:01:40.830> blade<00:01:41.100> it's

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
so this one has the recurve blade it's

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.250 
so this one has the recurve blade it's
actually<00:01:41.730> the<00:01:41.910> only<00:01:42.060> recurve<00:01:44.720> so<00:01:45.720> not<00:01:46.020> not<00:01:46.200> a

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:46.260 
actually the only recurve so not not a

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.770 
actually the only recurve so not not a
recurve<00:01:46.740> I<00:01:46.890> guess<00:01:47.040> it's<00:01:47.220> a<00:01:47.430> hot<00:01:48.240> belt<00:01:48.510> blade

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
recurve I guess it's a hot belt blade

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.370 
recurve I guess it's a hot belt blade
the<00:01:49.500> only<00:01:49.710> hawk<00:01:49.950> bill<00:01:50.220> blade<00:01:50.550> that<00:01:50.820> Kirby<00:01:51.660> has

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
the only hawk bill blade that Kirby has

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.220 
the only hawk bill blade that Kirby has
ever<00:01:52.920> made<00:01:53.280> in<00:01:54.240> full<00:01:54.510> production<00:01:54.630> at<00:01:55.020> least

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:55.230 
ever made in full production at least

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.310 
ever made in full production at least
and<00:01:55.440> the<00:01:56.250> pretty<00:01:56.640> unique<00:01:56.970> looking<00:01:57.240> as<00:01:57.690> you<00:01:58.170> can

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
and the pretty unique looking as you can

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.220 
and the pretty unique looking as you can
see<00:01:58.530> this<00:01:58.790> back<00:01:59.790> here<00:02:00.150> comes<00:02:00.600> up<00:02:00.780> like<00:02:00.990> that

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:01.230 
see this back here comes up like that

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:03.680 
see this back here comes up like that
and<00:02:01.580> actually<00:02:02.580> quite<00:02:02.970> comfortable<00:02:03.480> in<00:02:03.600> the

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
and actually quite comfortable in the

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.720 
and actually quite comfortable in the
hand<00:02:03.720> when<00:02:04.080> you're<00:02:04.200> holding<00:02:04.560> it<00:02:04.680> your<00:02:05.250> pinky

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:05.730 
hand when you're holding it your pinky

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:07.210 
hand when you're holding it your pinky
kind<00:02:05.940> of<00:02:06.030> wraps<00:02:06.210> around<00:02:06.420> that<00:02:06.690> will<00:02:06.840> end

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
kind of wraps around that will end

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.389 
kind of wraps around that will end
and<00:02:07.820> then<00:02:08.300> he's<00:02:08.570> got<00:02:08.780> a<00:02:09.440> little<00:02:10.070> bit<00:02:10.250> of<00:02:10.280> a

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
and then he's got a little bit of a

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.530 
and then he's got a little bit of a
thumb<00:02:10.610> ramp<00:02:10.820> here<00:02:11.030> no<00:02:11.210> jumping<00:02:11.690> on<00:02:11.810> this<00:02:11.990> one

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
thumb ramp here no jumping on this one

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.310 
thumb ramp here no jumping on this one
I'm<00:02:14.540> probably<00:02:14.750> going<00:02:14.930> to<00:02:15.020> use<00:02:15.140> a<00:02:15.170> little

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
I'm probably going to use a little

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.800 
I'm probably going to use a little
jumping<00:02:15.890> there<00:02:16.070> on<00:02:16.220> the<00:02:16.370> on<00:02:16.580> the<00:02:17.060> thumb<00:02:17.540> ramp

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
jumping there on the on the thumb ramp

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.420 
jumping there on the on the thumb ramp
and<00:02:19.540> feels<00:02:20.540> really<00:02:20.750> good<00:02:21.040> quite<00:02:22.040> like<00:02:22.220> the

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
and feels really good quite like the

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.520 
and feels really good quite like the
feel<00:02:23.000> of<00:02:23.030> this<00:02:23.270> one<00:02:25.120> so<00:02:26.120> essentially<00:02:26.540> same

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
feel of this one so essentially same

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.060 
feel of this one so essentially same
lock<00:02:27.800> up<00:02:28.010> as<00:02:28.160> a<00:02:28.190> as<00:02:28.460> a<00:02:28.670> frame<00:02:28.880> lock<00:02:29.890> one<00:02:30.890> of<00:02:30.980> the

lock up as a as a frame lock one of the

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.370 
lock up as a as a frame lock one of the
neat<00:02:31.220> features<00:02:31.430> that<00:02:31.820> could<00:02:32.630> be<00:02:32.780> incorporated

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
neat features that could be incorporated

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.100 
neat features that could be incorporated
on<00:02:33.440> this<00:02:33.590> one<00:02:33.830> is<00:02:34.010> on<00:02:34.310> I'll<00:02:34.460> zoom<00:02:34.700> in<00:02:34.970> show<00:02:35.960> the

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110
