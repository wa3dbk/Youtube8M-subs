00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
oasis is just weirdly spread out it's so

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.390 
oasis is just weirdly spread out it's so

the way over here to your third it's
really<00:01:19.830> quite<00:01:19.920> hard<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.400> defend<00:01:20.640> me<00:01:21.150> lists<00:01:21.420> are

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
really quite hard to defend me lists are

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:22.999 
really quite hard to defend me lists are
great<00:01:21.659> because<00:01:21.840> they<00:01:22.049> can<00:01:22.229> just<00:01:22.530> ignore<00:01:22.740> these

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
great because they can just ignore these

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.700 
great because they can just ignore these
little<00:01:23.250> gaps<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:23.700> this<00:01:24.689> has<00:01:24.840> been<00:01:25.020> changed<00:01:25.530> in

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
little gaps and this has been changed in

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.219 
little gaps and this has been changed in
a<00:01:26.280> 1.1<00:01:26.909> but<00:01:27.060> this<00:01:27.180> is<00:01:27.270> pretty<00:01:27.450> 1.1<00:01:27.900> so<00:01:28.080> we've

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
a 1.1 but this is pretty 1.1 so we've

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.539 
a 1.1 but this is pretty 1.1 so we've
still<00:01:28.439> got<00:01:28.590> that<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:28.920> we<00:01:28.979> don't<00:01:29.159> have<00:01:29.280> rocks

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
still got that and we don't have rocks

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.569 
still got that and we don't have rocks
at<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.180> ramp<00:01:30.420> so<00:01:30.869> this<00:01:31.409> is<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.619> old<00:01:31.829> Oasis<00:01:32.400> not

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
at the ramp so this is the old Oasis not

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.730 
at the ramp so this is the old Oasis not
the<00:01:32.700> new<00:01:32.850> both<00:01:33.479> players<00:01:33.780> scouting<00:01:34.229> pretty

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
the new both players scouting pretty

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.380 
the new both players scouting pretty
efficiently<00:01:35.159> just<00:01:35.850> a<00:01:35.939> little<00:01:36.030> bit<00:01:36.150> of<00:01:36.240> a

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
efficiently just a little bit of a

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.880 
efficiently just a little bit of a
standoff<00:01:36.990> right<00:01:37.170> now<00:01:37.290> as<00:01:37.409> we're<00:01:37.590> seeing<00:01:37.710> more

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
standoff right now as we're seeing more

just need to leave this beaten up ultra
at<00:05:01.470> home<00:05:01.620> but<00:05:02.250> that<00:05:02.430> was<00:05:02.580> targeted<00:05:03.060> very<00:05:03.660> nice

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
at home but that was targeted very nice

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.660

by<00:05:04.200> next<00:05:04.470> giant<00:05:04.650> he<00:05:05.100> managed<00:05:05.340> to<00:05:05.400> get<00:05:05.520> that

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:05.670 
by next giant he managed to get that

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:06.920 
by next giant he managed to get that
ultra<00:05:05.940> that<00:05:06.060> was<00:05:06.150> super<00:05:06.390> low<00:05:06.540> bit<00:05:06.780> of<00:05:06.870> a

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 
ultra that was super low bit of a

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:08.390 
ultra that was super low bit of a
mistake<00:05:07.260> there<00:05:07.440> by<00:05:07.530> ice<00:05:07.710> there's<00:05:08.010> a<00:05:08.100> super

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 
mistake there by ice there's a super

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.910 
mistake there by ice there's a super
expensive<00:05:08.670> ultras<00:05:09.150> but<00:05:09.600> these<00:05:09.720> are<00:05:09.870> slow<00:05:10.170> very

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:10.920 
expensive ultras but these are slow very

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:12.830 
expensive ultras but these are slow very
slow<00:05:11.040> units<00:05:11.520> and<00:05:11.670> ultras<00:05:12.300> can<00:05:12.450> basically<00:05:12.570> pick

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 
slow units and ultras can basically pick

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.600 
slow units and ultras can basically pick
these<00:05:12.990> off<00:05:13.200> fungal<00:05:13.830> growths<00:05:14.010> on<00:05:14.160> the<00:05:14.220> ultra

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
these off fungal growths on the ultra

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:16.730 
these off fungal growths on the ultra
too<00:05:14.820> bad<00:05:15.000> they<00:05:15.180> are<00:05:15.600> immune<00:05:16.020> to<00:05:16.050> smooth<00:05:16.380> slow

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 
too bad they are immune to smooth slow

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.350 
too bad they are immune to smooth slow
moving<00:05:17.220> in<00:05:17.340> effects<00:05:17.790> so<00:05:17.940> they'll<00:05:18.090> be<00:05:18.180> just

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360 
moving in effects so they'll be just

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.430 
moving in effects so they'll be just
fine<00:05:18.450> but<00:05:19.110> right<00:05:20.040> now<00:05:20.570> long<00:05:21.570> distance<00:05:21.750> mining

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:22.440 
fine but right now long distance mining

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.910 
fine but right now long distance mining
by<00:05:22.590> next<00:05:22.860> time<00:05:22.980> this<00:05:23.160> is<00:05:23.270> interesting<00:05:24.270> so<00:05:24.920> we

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:25.920 
by next time this is interesting so we

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.920 
by next time this is interesting so we
are<00:05:26.070> seeing<00:05:26.400> all<00:05:26.910> these<00:05:27.240> ultras<00:05:27.600> coming<00:05:27.840> on

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930

are seeing all these ultras coming on
the<00:05:28.050> platform<00:05:28.740> place<00:05:29.100> and<00:05:29.370> we<00:05:29.490> have<00:05:29.610> 26<00:05:30.480> hydras

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:31.110 
the platform place and we have 26 hydras

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:34.130 
the platform place and we have 26 hydras
being<00:05:31.920> produced<00:05:32.310> by<00:05:32.880> next<00:05:33.180> shine<00:05:33.360> it's<00:05:33.750> very

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:34.140 
being produced by next shine it's very

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:37.190 
being produced by next shine it's very
interesting<00:05:34.650> choice<00:05:34.830> it<00:05:35.100> has<00:05:35.220> pure<00:05:36.200> ultra

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:37.200 
interesting choice it has pure ultra

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.470 
interesting choice it has pure ultra
right<00:05:37.410> now<00:05:37.560> 18<00:05:38.280> more<00:05:38.430> hydras<00:05:38.760> coming<00:05:39.030> out<00:05:39.150> for

of position now all the hydras going to
the<00:05:44.940> right<00:05:45.180> hand<00:05:45.480> side<00:05:45.600> of<00:05:46.310> ice<00:05:47.310> ice<00:05:47.700> going<00:05:48.030> to

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:48.180 
the right hand side of ice ice going to

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:52.220 
the right hand side of ice ice going to
the<00:05:48.270> left<00:05:48.540> hand<00:05:48.780> side<00:05:49.400> forcing<00:05:50.420> will<00:05:51.420> he<00:05:51.960> say

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:52.230 
the left hand side forcing will he say

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:53.780 
the left hand side forcing will he say
aggressive<00:05:52.380> no<00:05:52.680> next<00:05:52.980> one<00:05:53.100> is<00:05:53.220> going<00:05:53.460> to<00:05:53.670> go

be much more enforced you can actually

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:17.750 
be much more enforced you can actually
do<00:06:15.480> the<00:06:15.600> reversal<00:06:16.050> and<00:06:16.230> do<00:06:16.380> what<00:06:16.560> I<00:06:16.950> stick<00:06:17.640> to
