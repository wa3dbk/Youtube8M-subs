00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.089
 bye bye today i'm here for one 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.429
 to spit the challenge of March because 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.889
 just in the months I would like to do one is 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:14.790
 the theme of this video is the journey 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.529
 because as many of you know I love 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.109
 travel really a lot and something that 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.720
 I have always been since I am a child not 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.100
 I have made many trips and so I have you 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.359
 asked to ask me questions about 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.890
 instagram 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.930
 to learn more about my experiences 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.939
 because often even on to scream the facts 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.500
 questions about my travels e 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.660
 so I think this theme was 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.430
 perfect for this new to the child is 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.899
 like you're downloading it 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.790
 so definitely camera now 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.230
 while the video starts it will turn off 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.700
 realize everything from the nandor 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.590
 from the start it is enough to realize from 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.480
 piece like always but I wonder why 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.180
 not but he must always scream when he speaks 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.030
 own street when talking on the phone 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:57.260
 you can't understand screams like I don't know 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:57.260
 so let me start with the questions 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:02.100
 of embroidery asks which was yours 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.470
 worst trip is because my trip 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.640
 per day was the marbella one in 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.710
 Spain 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.990
 simply because of me 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.150
 Mom we missed the plane twice 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.180
 first time because if you don't want it ribbed 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.860
 he is an enemy from and just when 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.840
 they touched the tickets they were finished 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.850
 because sometimes low-cost flights do 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.680
 I don't know if these things are still used though 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.080
 before , however, the company was there 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.070
 had booked a hotel room 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.869
 only that he also went to find out if 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.650
 need to put the alarm clock in the room 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:34.259
 but they did not do it and therefore the day 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.299
 after the alarm a map the fifteen 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.520
 chelsea my name is also awakened 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.710
 giulia could mind an alarm clock for ho 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.290
 said okay if only the hotel does not 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.049
 I admit I woke up and right in the 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.360
 moment the plane was taking off 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:49.790
 and therefore they had to assemble it 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.610
 nights on wheels the next day to leave 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.870
 but once the barber arrived the first 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.030
 week 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:58.370
 my mom 40 of fever the second 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:02.240
 week I 40 of fever 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:05.150
 so I don't know if you understand the situation e 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.100
 so in the end there is barbie was a lot 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:12.740
 nice and all so an era of guilt 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:14.840
 spain in the city ​​was not bad luck speak 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:18.020
 next question prefers mare la 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:21.230
 mountain the city I am a girl from the 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:23.270
 city ​​flight I say its crisis has seen 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.850
 that I like to visit new places me 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:29.030
 like to move lie down on 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:31.130
 beach to sunbathe no mountain 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.840
 same reasoning I like nature 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.820
 I like mountain air 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.959
 after a while I want to go back to the city 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:40.550
 citigroup faith says witches tomorrow of 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:42.950
 leave for the last trip of yours 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:45.890
 life where you would go 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:48.260
 I am aware that for the last one 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:51.290
 trip for my life I should choose 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:54.739
 a city never seen 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:58.330
 but precisely being the last journey on 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:03:01.220
 my heart tells me to go to london on 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:03.140
 you enjoyed traveling there ever more 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.239
 was one that disappointed expectations 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.010
 then the journey I like best is 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:09.590
 was the one in california with my mom 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.540
 and two of our friends is I liked a 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.070
 sack because then now seas but also 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.870
 san francisco we rented one 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:17.209
 car then that did all the rounds 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:20.030
 of california by car 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:21.830
 yes ok anyway I would like his 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.510
 killing of going to california was 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:26.390
 just the fact that we were the four of us 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:29.030
 by car to travel from city to city 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:31.610
 I really liked this thing and for 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.110
 answer the second question a post 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.580
 which disappointed my expectations 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.319
 It was just during that vacation 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:40.489
 or los angeles 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:42.469
 I expected from los angeles is not one 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:44.420
 city ​​for tourists pinning like 

00:03:42.469 --> 00:03:46.280
 reciting we do who san francisco 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.560
 on the other hand, I was out of breath 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.840
 What you feel it remains a fact if 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.760
 could save the memory of only three 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.250
 trips which you would choose 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:58.250
 then I would choose a trip I have 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.900
 done in calabria with my dad this 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.719
 the house in california that I just have 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.549
 told in the study holiday in new 

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:06.980
 york because despite not having 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:08.870
 learned nothing of church and again 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:12.049
 I met great people and I have 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:15.230
 seen new york from god they made me 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:17.150
 see every single corner 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.430
 if you had to leave for volunteering for 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.680
 going to help people in 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.449
 difficulty in which country you would go for 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.720
 that reason you greet me a kiss 

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:28.250
 hello true i think because the real writing 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.710
 Spanish so think of veronica 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:32.090
 hi Iran a kiss are also me 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.560
 this question has arrived because of its own 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:34.940
 these days I'm thinking of 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.800
 go to with volunteering the year 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:38.960
 next I want next year 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:42.380
 take a year off to reflect 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:44.960
 su as well as a bit of basins so e 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:46.759
 so I would like to take advantage of free time 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.560
 to make me a month and a half a month from 

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:50.180

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.310

 i went the year every go there at 1 no 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:57.650
 even if there is one thing that stops me 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:02.690
 alone that can tell me inaugurates and not 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:04.639
 go old though but for me I'll do it 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:06.830
 I will get used to it for six days 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:10.190

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:17.570
 time for that trip to california by 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:19.310

 francisco last question you always have 

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:40.139
 I had this passion for since I was a child 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:42.900
 The travels 

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:44.430
 you know that to make you understand my first 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.240
 journey was in my belly 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:46.560
 mum 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:49.290

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:52.020
 used to move often even for the 

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:54.750
