it's<00:01:47.990> a<00:01:48.050> pretty<00:01:48.260> proven<00:01:48.770> bike<00:01:48.980> I<00:01:49.190> know

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.270 

and<00:01:52.180> I<00:01:52.330> think<00:01:52.390> the<00:01:53.110> weifare<00:01:53.530> on<00:01:53.710> the<00:01:53.800> back<00:01:54.010> she

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
and I think the weifare on the back she

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.360 
and I think the weifare on the back she
feels<00:01:54.490> maybe<00:01:54.760> a<00:01:54.940> little<00:01:55.210> bit<00:01:55.510> I<00:01:56.100> think<00:01:57.100> she

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:57.370 
feels maybe a little bit I think she

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:00.120 
feels maybe a little bit I think she
might<00:01:57.520> be<00:01:57.550> higher<00:01:57.880> up<00:01:58.210> than<00:01:58.750> Phil's<00:01:59.590> she<00:01:59.920> feels

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
might be higher up than Phil's she feels

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
might be higher up than Phil's she feels
