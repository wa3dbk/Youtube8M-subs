00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 and violent towards young people and add thorium 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.030
 now for example scored since last year 

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:09.849
 I remember that at the last moment it was changed 

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:13.910
 the place not to space and now they are having a little more trouble 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:16.789
 still because I think I would change again 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:20.249
 done and what happens what happens with the authorities not 

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:24.210
 a hollow world there is a lot of knowledge needs 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.499
 of young people in search of this space we are realizing 

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:31.139
 I here interview interviews with music groups and others 

00:00:31.809 --> 00:00:35.750
 we see that one of the main problems is the lack of spaces 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.420
 and if we can not take the streets in a peaceful way then 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.870
 what is happening 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.850
 Well, I do not think there is anything yet and I think it is incongruous that for a 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:46.600
 side 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.870
 p emphasizes so much the social development of mexico 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.870
 and that within this social development the parties there have provoked moved 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.540
 a law for young people in the federal district 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.370
 and that this law does not respect its minimum aspects 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.940
 As is the case with the guarantee of young people, free expression and 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.030
 enjoy public spaces if there is a law 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.780
 that regulates these aspects and saw the need to enact this law 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.340
 because then it can be contradicted only with a trade 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.310
 for at this moment to that and settled the reasoning that why should we 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.600
 give a notification does not accept it or we do not accept it we hide ourselves from it 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.119
 it seems to me that we owe you only consider the free democratic game not 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:33.990
 On the one hand, the government of Andrés André López López 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.640
 the change of schedule since then of the time that was lived met by the 

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:40.829
 federal government that if this schedule change is not 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:46.240
 and the desire for a consultation with the money of all of us and also by a hundred of 

00:01:46.239 --> 00:01:49.740
 the borbolla with constitutional controversy he had the ability and 

00:01:49.739 --> 00:01:54.099
 feel then why we are not recognized citizens and only be 

00:01:54.099 --> 00:01:57.499
 the political forces recognize also the Mexican indigenous people 

00:01:57.499 --> 00:02:01.379
 500 years they were told that they have no right to anything and that does not prevent that in 

00:02:01.379 --> 00:02:03.720
 this moment say enough 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.250
 this this new mexico I believe that without issuing what to do with the mobilization and 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.639
 with new subjects 

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:11.340
 that enter no longer 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.870
 to party politics 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.730
 china the politics of communities 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.030
 and young people are one of the characters that women present themselves 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.040
 homosexuals the indigenous all these subjects that give life to the lime the bread 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.260
 the new democratic mexico 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.609
 I believe that the world also recognizes young people 

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:32.540
 as an important force what is not grouped in parties 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.900
 although it is not grouped in chepo type of associations stephen incidence 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.200
 clear policy should be recognized in its independent field which is the 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.220
 more important 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.560
 I think that here the big problem is independence, what we have and 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.580
 I think we want to assert that from our independent voice we have to 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:50.869
 be listened 

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:54.389
 now the h3 that for the security means or what was it 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:57.989
 they requested him 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.630
 so that you could servet here for which eta I do not know 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.449
 some for which permission was denied 

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:08.519
 percent in mention of which is spoken in general terms to guarantee 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:11.359
 the key of the participants 

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:14.679
 I just want to go in relation to these that 

00:03:14.679 --> 00:03:17.149
 in the two previous years it has been guaranteed 

00:03:17.149 --> 00:03:20.149
 the integrity of the participants in which a white balance 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:24.410
 I would like to know in the same delegation I counted who was 

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:26.009
 guarantees citizens 

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:27.619
 this integrity 

00:03:27.619 --> 00:03:31.939
 when we have some areas that are already medium that you can not go through 

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:36.319
 they who guarantee to the pedestrian that he can go for the ccaa through the streets of 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:37.489
 historical Center 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:43.799
 without that the sic well the twenty 1 one is that a case with boiling oil hotel 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:48.059
 set to go by these there are agreements with gas tank 

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:50.029
 and he says nothing about it 

00:03:50.029 --> 00:03:53.429
 now a matter of explosives is handled I think it's completely was 

00:03:53.429 --> 00:03:58.040
 discussion because there is no mobile any form of presence of the 

00:03:58.039 --> 00:04:01.299
 explosives in the press at a music festival you know 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:03.440
 four musical sessions struck equaled 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.370
 I think that about explosives is the last thing you can think of that without 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:10.349
 But at the mercy we had two big explosions 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:13.150
 huge that has a cost this 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.840
 tremendous fire not of the sedena indicated and there but and operative against explosives 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:17.700
 not detonated 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.620
 that kind of incongruities that language that double language 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:25.300
 It makes us think that maybe we are not so far from that in Mexico that 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.200
 we thought 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.440
 to bitch the ally involved with democracy does not and I think where 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.000
 they were as citizens has to make the executive the change of a year 

00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:38.069
 the meeting keep the lines let's see 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.999
 min 

00:04:53.999 --> 00:04:56.999
 7 

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:07.969
 on this front 

00:05:17.499 --> 00:05:19.370
 as well 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:22.069
