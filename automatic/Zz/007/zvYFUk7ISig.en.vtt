00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
to do that because in November there is

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.080 
to do that because in November there is
a<00:03:32.570> 5k<00:03:33.570> run<00:03:33.600> that<00:03:34.110> my<00:03:34.650> family<00:03:35.100> and<00:03:35.160> I<00:03:35.250> do<00:03:35.310> every

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
a 5k run that my family and I do every

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.910 
a 5k run that my family and I do every
single<00:03:36.269> year<00:03:36.630> and<00:03:36.870> I<00:03:36.930> didn't<00:03:37.200> do<00:03:37.320> it<00:03:37.350> last<00:03:37.500> year

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
single year and I didn't do it last year

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.190 
single year and I didn't do it last year
because<00:03:38.250> I'd<00:03:38.760> gained<00:03:39.120> weight<00:03:39.360> and<00:03:39.660> I<00:03:39.840> had<00:03:40.079> like

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
because I'd gained weight and I had like

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.100 
because I'd gained weight and I had like
knee<00:03:40.829> pain<00:03:41.190> and<00:03:41.519> i<00:03:42.420> think<00:03:42.720> it<00:03:42.840> was<00:03:42.930> in<00:03:42.989> a

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
knee pain and i think it was in a

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.500 
knee pain and i think it was in a
correlation<00:03:43.680> with<00:03:43.829> a<00:03:43.860> hiking<00:03:44.519> injury<00:03:45.150> and<00:03:45.360> the

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
correlation with a hiking injury and the

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:46.759 
correlation with a hiking injury and the
fact<00:03:45.720> that<00:03:45.810> i<00:03:45.900> had<00:03:46.049> put<00:03:46.200> on<00:03:46.350> so<00:03:46.590> much<00:03:46.650> weight

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
fact that i had put on so much weight

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:49.160 
fact that i had put on so much weight
over<00:03:47.640> the<00:03:47.700> last<00:03:47.910> two<00:03:48.180> years<00:03:48.209> and<00:03:48.690> I<00:03:48.780> just<00:03:49.019> did
