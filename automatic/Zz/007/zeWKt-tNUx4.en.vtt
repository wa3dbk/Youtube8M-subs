think<00:01:33.270> is<00:01:33.360> going<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.630> be<00:01:33.720> a<00:01:33.750> lot<00:01:34.079> different<00:01:34.500> and

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
think is going to be a lot different and

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.200 
think is going to be a lot different and
I<00:01:34.890> think<00:01:34.950> Microsoft<00:01:35.250> is<00:01:35.790> going<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.090> have<00:01:36.180> a

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
I think Microsoft is going to have a

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.179 
I think Microsoft is going to have a
much<00:01:36.509> easier<00:01:36.540> time<00:01:36.930> getting<00:01:37.829> them<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:38.040> do

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
much easier time getting them to do

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.380 
much easier time getting them to do
whatever<00:01:38.400> they<00:01:38.549> want<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:39.000> I<00:01:39.030> really<00:01:39.270> do<00:01:39.360> think

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
whatever they want and I really do think

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.580 
whatever they want and I really do think
that<00:01:39.659> we're<00:01:39.840> gonna<00:01:39.930> see<00:01:40.170> something<00:01:40.380> from

graphically<00:02:18.680> I<00:02:19.070> think<00:02:19.400> it<00:02:19.490> would<00:02:19.580> be<00:02:19.670> really

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
graphically I think it would be really

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.240 
graphically I think it would be really
cool<00:02:20.120> if<00:02:20.240> they<00:02:20.360> made<00:02:20.510> a<00:02:20.660> real<00:02:21.170> world<00:02:21.620> realistic

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
cool if they made a real world realistic

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:23.680 
cool if they made a real world realistic
looking<00:02:22.520> Minecraft<00:02:23.030> of<00:02:23.270> course<00:02:23.540> that's

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
looking Minecraft of course that's

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.240 
looking Minecraft of course that's
basically<00:02:23.990> an<00:02:24.140> abomination<00:02:24.560> of<00:02:24.860> why

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
basically an abomination of why

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.820 
basically an abomination of why
everybody<00:02:25.760> likes<00:02:25.910> Minecraft<00:02:26.480> but<00:02:26.960> yeah<00:02:27.380> it'd

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
everybody likes Minecraft but yeah it'd

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.080 
everybody likes Minecraft but yeah it'd
be<00:02:27.890> interesting<00:02:28.130> are<00:02:28.550> we<00:02:28.640> going<00:02:28.850> to<00:02:28.910> see<00:02:29.060> a

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
be interesting are we going to see a

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.000 
be interesting are we going to see a
beefier<00:02:29.570> fleshed<00:02:30.020> out<00:02:30.170> product<00:02:30.650> in<00:02:30.770> a<00:02:30.860> new

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
beefier fleshed out product in a new

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.440 
beefier fleshed out product in a new

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:33.760 
iteration of minecraft - I think it
could<00:02:32.570> be<00:02:32.690> really<00:02:32.810> cool<00:02:33.050> console<00:02:33.440> versions

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
could be really cool console versions

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.890 
could be really cool console versions
