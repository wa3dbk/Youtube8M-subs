however<00:03:14.610> unlike<00:03:15.300> the<00:03:15.450> Polo<00:03:15.660> there<00:03:16.020> is<00:03:16.110> a<00:03:16.140> bit

however unlike the Polo there is a bit

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.650 
however unlike the Polo there is a bit
lag<00:03:16.650> and<00:03:16.950> that<00:03:17.610> means<00:03:17.880> you<00:03:18.030> have<00:03:18.150> to<00:03:18.240> work<00:03:18.450> the

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
lag and that means you have to work the

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.450 
lag and that means you have to work the
gearbox<00:03:19.050> a<00:03:19.200> bit<00:03:19.350> to<00:03:19.830> extract<00:03:20.160> the<00:03:20.280> best

performance<00:03:22.190> so<00:03:23.190> then<00:03:23.430> it<00:03:23.640> seems<00:03:23.880> the<00:03:24.030> Polo<00:03:24.270> GT

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.560

TDI<00:03:24.930> has<00:03:25.290> the<00:03:25.710> power<00:03:25.920> advantage<00:03:26.310> but<00:03:27.180> where
