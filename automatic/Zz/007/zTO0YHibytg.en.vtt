there's<00:00:04.410> often<00:00:04.680> a<00:00:04.859> misconception<00:00:05.370> of<00:00:05.580> what

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
there's often a misconception of what

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.089 
there's often a misconception of what
facelift<00:00:06.180> surgery<00:00:06.299> really<00:00:06.779> is<00:00:07.020> and<00:00:07.259> logically

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
facelift surgery really is and logically

the face involves the entire face and so

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.310 
the face involves the entire face and so
patients<00:00:11.730> will<00:00:11.820> think<00:00:12.059> a<00:00:12.300> left<00:00:12.690> involves<00:00:13.230> the

which is the mid-face and there's a

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.320 
which is the mid-face and there's a
lower<00:00:22.350> third<00:00:22.619> which<00:00:23.130> is<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.369> jawline<00:00:24.000> and<00:00:24.240> the

do is we elevate the skin and often as
time<00:00:48.120> goes<00:00:48.420> will<00:00:48.690> accumulate<00:00:48.960> a<00:00:49.230> little<00:00:49.530> bit

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
time goes will accumulate a little bit

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.680 
time goes will accumulate a little bit
of<00:00:49.739> fat<00:00:49.920> here<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:50.399> some<00:00:50.730> people<00:00:50.760> you'll<00:00:51.390> start

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
of fat here and some people you'll start

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.660 
of fat here and some people you'll start
seeing<00:00:51.870> these<00:00:52.050> two<00:00:52.289> bands<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:53.219> that's<00:00:53.460> the

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
seeing these two bands and that's the

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.189 
seeing these two bands and that's the
front<00:00:53.940> edge<00:00:54.149> of<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.570> muscle<00:00:54.780> called<00:00:55.050> the

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
front edge of a muscle called the

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.200 
front edge of a muscle called the
platysma<00:00:55.500> muscle<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:56.520> what<00:00:56.730> happens<00:00:57.090> over

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
platysma muscle and what happens over

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.779 
platysma muscle and what happens over
time<00:00:57.360> is<00:00:57.600> that<00:00:57.870> participants<00:00:58.770> will<00:00:58.859> sag<00:00:59.280> and

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
time is that participants will sag and

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.490 
time is that participants will sag and
it's<00:00:59.969> a<00:01:00.059> muscle<00:01:00.359> that<00:01:00.480> runs<00:01:00.629> from<00:01:00.870> here<00:01:01.170> down

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
it's a muscle that runs from here down

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.319 
it's a muscle that runs from here down
to<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.770> collarbone<00:01:01.980> it's<00:01:02.699> actually<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.090> whole

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
to the collarbone it's actually a whole

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.840 
to the collarbone it's actually a whole
sheet<00:01:03.690> of<00:01:03.719> muscle<00:01:03.960> that<00:01:04.739> inserts<00:01:05.159> here<00:01:05.519> and<00:01:05.729> in

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
sheet of muscle that inserts here and in

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.030 
sheet of muscle that inserts here and in
the<00:01:06.000> collarbone<00:01:06.450> in<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.869> back<00:01:07.080> edge<00:01:07.409> you<00:01:07.890> can

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
the collarbone in the back edge you can

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.190 
the collarbone in the back edge you can
draw<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.430> line<00:01:08.640> from<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.970> former<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.479> high<00:01:09.750> to

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
draw a line from the former the high to

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.170 
draw a line from the former the high to
the<00:01:10.320> angle<00:01:10.860> of<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.010> jaw<00:01:11.220> down<00:01:11.520> into<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:11.970> neck

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
the angle of the jaw down into the neck

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.420 
the angle of the jaw down into the neck
so<00:01:12.360> as<00:01:12.510> we<00:01:12.780> address<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.530> front<00:01:13.799> edge<00:01:13.950> we'll

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
so as we address the front edge we'll

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:15.620 
so as we address the front edge we'll
actually<00:01:14.580> so<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.119> front<00:01:15.330> edge<00:01:15.479> of<00:01:15.570> the

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
actually so the front edge of the

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.140 
actually so the front edge of the
multiple<00:01:16.020> together<00:01:16.310> now<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.400> second<00:01:17.880> part<00:01:18.000> of

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
multiple together now the second part of

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.780 
multiple together now the second part of
baselet<00:01:18.509> surgery<00:01:18.810> involves<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.409> face<00:01:19.790> now

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
baselet surgery involves the face now

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.280

allows<00:01:39.270> us<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:39.659> do<00:01:39.810> is<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.170> access<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:41.159> area

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
allows us to do is to access the area

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.399 
allows us to do is to access the area
that's<00:01:41.610> sagged<00:01:41.970> and<00:01:42.240> so<00:01:42.479> when<00:01:42.659> we<00:01:42.780> access<00:01:43.200> this

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
that's sagged and so when we access this

that's sagged and so when we access this
and<00:01:43.619> tighten<00:01:43.950> it<00:01:44.070> will<00:01:44.430> actually<00:01:44.700> tighten<00:01:44.939> the

back<00:01:45.299> edge<00:01:45.540> of<00:01:45.659> that<00:01:45.750> muscle<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.290> what<00:01:46.770> that

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
back edge of that muscle and what that

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.039 
back edge of that muscle and what that
does<00:01:47.159> is<00:01:47.430> it<00:01:47.579> restores<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.149> youthful<00:01:48.540> jawline

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
does is it restores the youthful jawline
