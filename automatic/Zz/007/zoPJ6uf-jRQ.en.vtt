00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 Hi there, you're on the moon channel and today 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:05.960
 I want to talk to you about the figures for 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.220
 the garden 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.679
 I went wandering recently 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.460
 construction store but not even 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:16.820
 the store and that's what this super duper mega 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:20.039
 construction supermarket and would go 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:23.510
 garden decor I wanted to find there 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:26.310
 some stork mushrooms 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:28.019
 flamingo don't know I wanted something 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.060
 find interesting for the garden 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.669
 something to make it real 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.430
 diversity we have there bike i 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:39.570
 I do n't think you see him there later 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.790
 show in general I would have bought something if 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.750
 wouldn't it all cost twice 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:48.809
 more expensive bike that I bought in 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.539
 year is worth 2 times more expensive than all these mushrooms 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.969
 these little ones are twice as expensive and 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.480
 if maybe I didn't know the previous one 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.800
 prices 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:02.760
 I would buy but knowing that it was worth one 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:05.880
 the price now costs another price no I 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.790
 I found another way out I made figures from 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:12.510
 mounting foam unfortunately i have in 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:15.240
 The photo is not the whole process but I have something 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.189
 made 2 mushrooms but this is the easiest 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.140
 probably what can be done at all from 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.020
 garden figures and decided to make 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:25.049
 sheep lamb lamb 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:28.470
 I don't know who I will have for now 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:30.960
 somehow so be sure to show you how i am 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.979
 did it and what happened as a result 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:37.470
 Foam took a lot I read read the forum and 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:40.740
 for some reason, she never found out how much she leaves 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.899
 foam on one figure which balloon in 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.210
 overall and bought this foam a lot 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:48.899
 it turned out this is not a figurine not too cheap 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.880
 but not as expensive as it came out 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:54.540
 ram if he stood in this super 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.520
 super mega hyper marketplace so I can 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.610
 now show you how it looks 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.409
 At this stage , you need to 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:07.619
 first make the frame 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:08.640
 here they are hidden under the table 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.500
 general 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.130
 and now she is still not very 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.200
 pretty but now i'm sorry i have them 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.290
 put my 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:22.910
 left table sorry for the inconvenience 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:26.540
 Here I have a ram mom says that I have 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:32.730
 gigantomania is worth a little 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:36.510
 mill but here's a ram well yes he doesn't 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:40.140
 small but I solved it all carrying 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:43.440
 tee leave it as cool and 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:45.000
 just color well how to color 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.580
 at first it will be more 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.330
 acrylic putty then acrylic 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.410
 paints 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:55.850
 and then acrylic lacquer froze all 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.000
 acrylic to protect this foam from 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:02.459
 sunny 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:04.590
 u in the filters shade ray filters in general 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:07.050
 He first I did frame pictures 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.910
 I don't have a lamb frame but I tell you 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:12.390
 I will try to show me here 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:15.690
 if you see this paper here it is soft 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:22.079
 there is scotch and paper and here it is 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:23.940
 can better be seen here and this is bottled 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:26.780
 it at me it is a little Don 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:31.200
 moved out okay head shape 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:32.910
 there is then here I have him singing 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.340
 such a tuft in ears 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:38.010
 and this is all you sneeze to be smooth and 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.890
 as well as legs from them at me strange and well 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:43.260
 there they are on wood 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:46.049
 in general it's me him all you sneeze to be 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.480
 smooth nose well and paint there still 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:51.299
 do not worry you further 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:53.280
 here it must be a mushroom I don't 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:55.260
 I did not have enough in general foam in 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:04:00.299
 that time and this time when I arrived 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:01.640
 I made the first one at the dacha 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:05.280
 I will finish 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.640
 here still for the time being it looks little like 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.850
 mushroom 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:12.090
 so outlines what that is in general 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:14.630
 I hope that we can do it normally 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:17.910
 here, too, inside there is a eggplant 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:20.820
 in this rowing probably not visible and here 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:22.230
 accidentally also crumpled newspapers and to 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:26.550
 just trim some pho 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:28.770
 but it already falls off he did not know me 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:31.350
 another mushroom but he is generally huge 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:33.990
 turned out my megalomania as a mountain mom 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:36.420
 makes itself felt and here a lot more 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:39.150
 singing now these here now on this pomu 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:43.770
 I can see there right now I 'll show you 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:47.220
 see there inside the force will not drop over there 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:50.160
 sandpick with sand so that it is not theirs 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:52.050
 swept away by the wind then generally plan 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:57.030
 in general today it's all a penny to 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:05:00.390
 Tomorrow it’s already apricate though with acrylics for everyone 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:02.760
 to finish this acrylic stuff 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:04.950
 I have a huge ram like a deer 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:07.770
 generally I don’t know if he will fit 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:12.150
 Then for the winter somewhere, but I hope that 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:16.230
 fit in general something like this for me 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:19.190
 it turns out my figures then show that 

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:19.190
 turned out look 

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:39.099
 these are my figures from 

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:41.259
 polyurethane foam 

00:06:39.099 --> 00:06:44.020
 if you want something like that 

00:06:41.259 --> 00:06:45.699
 try to experiment if there is 

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:48.759
 write questions in the comments I 

00:06:45.699 --> 00:06:50.710
 I will surely answer that we know that I do not know 

00:06:48.759 --> 00:06:52.539
 google and answer if all of a sudden you don’t 

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:55.750
 find because I experienced a lot 

00:06:52.539 --> 00:06:57.610
 different articles found offline different read 

00:06:55.750 --> 00:07:00.729
 I read the news I scooped there 

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:03.069
 ideas and how to fix in principle 

00:07:00.729 --> 00:07:05.379
 well save and secure from cracking 

00:07:03.069 --> 00:07:08.110
 foam I don't know, I hope that 

00:07:05.379 --> 00:07:10.060
 in two weeks under the sun my lamb 

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:11.979
 do not crack once already zagrebu 

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:14.259
 so worried lamb some I 

00:07:11.979 --> 00:07:20.909
 large-scale project turned out and he will 

00:07:14.259 --> 00:07:24.190
 stand over there over there at the entrance 

00:07:20.909 --> 00:07:25.060
 let's see how he will behave through 

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:27.819
 two weeks 

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:30.159
 Thank you all for watching. I hope you 

00:07:27.819 --> 00:07:33.250
 like subscribe to my channel 

00:07:30.159 --> 00:07:36.150

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:36.150
 video bye bye
