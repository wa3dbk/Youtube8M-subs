00:00:53.849 --> 00:00:53.859 
to the States as well as i should get

good<00:00:53.980> year

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:58.610 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:00.580 

I<00:00:58.700> think<00:00:59.480> going<00:00:59.600> into<00:00:59.690> a<00:00:59.840> new<00:00:59.990> season<00:01:00.200> you've

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:00.590 
I think going into a new season you've

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.730 
I think going into a new season you've
always<00:01:00.800> got<00:01:00.920> to<00:01:00.980> be<00:01:01.040> very<00:01:01.370> positive<00:01:02.740> otherwise

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:03.740 
always got to be very positive otherwise

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.680 
always got to be very positive otherwise
what's<00:01:04.070> the<00:01:04.160> point<00:01:04.220> you<00:01:04.760> know<00:01:04.879> I<00:01:05.059> think<00:01:05.210> when

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:05.690 
what's the point you know I think when

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.020 
what's the point you know I think when
you're<00:01:05.810> working<00:01:05.900> with<00:01:06.200> this<00:01:06.350> many<00:01:06.560> people<00:01:07.340> to

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
you're working with this many people to

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.180 
you're working with this many people to
produce<00:01:08.180> a<00:01:08.450> car<00:01:08.660> there's<00:01:09.260> got<00:01:09.710> to<00:01:09.830> be<00:01:09.860> a<00:01:09.920> lot<00:01:10.100> of

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:10.190 
produce a car there's got to be a lot of

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:12.550 
produce a car there's got to be a lot of
positive<00:01:10.550> energy<00:01:10.640> I'm<00:01:11.570> constantly<00:01:11.960> asked<00:01:12.350> how

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
positive energy I'm constantly asked how

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.170 
positive energy I'm constantly asked how
confident<00:01:12.980> I<00:01:13.070> am<00:01:13.190> going<00:01:13.460> to<00:01:13.610> a<00:01:13.640> season<00:01:13.970> but<00:01:14.150> you

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
confident I am going to a season but you

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.870 
confident I am going to a season but you
can<00:01:14.480> never<00:01:14.600> really<00:01:14.840> be<00:01:15.310> too<00:01:16.310> confident<00:01:16.760> I

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
can never really be too confident I

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.600 
can never really be too confident I
think<00:01:17.090> you<00:01:17.180> have<00:01:17.330> to<00:01:17.360> always<00:01:18.280> remain<00:01:19.280> calm<00:01:19.580> and

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
think you have to always remain calm and

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.060 
think you have to always remain calm and
just<00:01:20.360> make<00:01:21.320> sure<00:01:21.470> you've<00:01:21.650> prepared<00:01:21.950> yourself

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
just make sure you've prepared yourself

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:23.950 
just make sure you've prepared yourself
well<00:01:22.640> that's<00:01:23.090> that's<00:01:23.450> the<00:01:23.600> best<00:01:23.780> way<00:01:23.900> to

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
well that's that's the best way to

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.030 
well that's that's the best way to
approach<00:01:24.290> you

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.220 

it<00:01:29.430> looks<00:01:29.640> a<00:01:30.120> little<00:01:30.450> bit<00:01:30.600> different<00:01:30.900> to<00:01:31.050> last

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:31.230 
it looks a little bit different to last

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:32.870 
it looks a little bit different to last
year's<00:01:31.440> car<00:01:31.650> even<00:01:32.220> though<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.640> is<00:01:32.670> an

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
year's car even though it is an

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.350 
year's car even though it is an
evolution<00:01:33.390> of<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:34.140> previous<00:01:34.500> year's<00:01:34.650> car<00:01:35.360> but

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
evolution of the previous year's car but

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.720 
evolution of the previous year's car but
just<00:01:37.020> optimizing<00:01:37.620> certain<00:01:38.160> areas<00:01:38.430> where<00:01:38.610> it

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:38.730 
just optimizing certain areas where it

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:40.880 
just optimizing certain areas where it
wasn't<00:01:39.090> so<00:01:39.210> strong<00:01:39.480> last<00:01:39.750> year<00:01:39.930> all<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.680> time

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
wasn't so strong last year all the time

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.190 
wasn't so strong last year all the time
where<00:01:41.190> we're<00:01:41.460> improving<00:01:41.790> phone<00:01:42.420> Lancaster<00:01:42.930> so

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
where we're improving phone Lancaster so

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.020 
where we're improving phone Lancaster so
there<00:01:43.590> are<00:01:43.680> many<00:01:43.950> things<00:01:44.250> on<00:01:44.400> this<00:01:44.520> car<00:01:44.790> that

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
there are many things on this car that

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.430 
there are many things on this car that
are<00:01:45.090> different<00:01:45.240> to<00:01:45.480> last<00:01:45.690> year<00:01:45.960> because<00:01:46.140> we

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:46.440 
are different to last year because we

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.290 
are different to last year because we
just<00:01:46.590> taken<00:01:46.920> it<00:01:46.980> to<00:01:47.100> another<00:01:47.130> level<00:01:47.370> and<00:01:47.790> for

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:48.300 
just taken it to another level and for

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.060 
just taken it to another level and for
me<00:01:48.420> it's<00:01:48.810> something<00:01:49.200> that's<00:01:49.350> always<00:01:49.590> been<00:01:49.830> key

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
me it's something that's always been key

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.180 
me it's something that's always been key
and<00:01:50.310> very<00:01:50.670> important<00:01:51.120> is<00:01:51.240> to<00:01:51.270> be<00:01:51.540> in<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:53.040> right

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.190 
and very important is to be in the right

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.100 
and very important is to be in the right
position<00:01:53.370> in<00:01:53.760> the<00:01:53.820> car<00:01:54.150> be<00:01:54.360> low<00:01:54.600> enough<00:01:54.630> in<00:01:54.990> the

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
position in the car be low enough in the

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:01.090

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.399 

during<00:02:01.939> the<00:02:02.000> course<00:02:02.210> of<00:02:02.360> the<00:02:02.479> year<00:02:02.780> we

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409 
during the course of the year we

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:05.140 
during the course of the year we
discover<00:02:03.770> things<00:02:04.040> about<00:02:04.250> the<00:02:04.580> car<00:02:04.790> things

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150 
discover things about the car things

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:06.520 
discover things about the car things
that<00:02:05.330> we<00:02:05.420> might<00:02:05.600> like<00:02:05.900> to<00:02:06.080> do<00:02:06.200> that<00:02:06.380> we

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
that we might like to do that we

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.559 
that we might like to do that we
probably<00:02:06.740> wouldn't<00:02:07.100> have<00:02:07.280> time<00:02:07.759> or<00:02:08.060> scope<00:02:08.390> to

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 
probably wouldn't have time or scope to

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:10.840 
probably wouldn't have time or scope to
change<00:02:08.840> if<00:02:09.110> we<00:02:09.140> want<00:02:09.380> to<00:02:09.440> make<00:02:09.649> a<00:02:09.860> fundamental

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
change if we want to make a fundamental

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:12.520 
change if we want to make a fundamental
change<00:02:10.910> to<00:02:11.180> the<00:02:11.270> chassis<00:02:11.690> or<00:02:11.840> repositioning

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
change to the chassis or repositioning

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.470 
change to the chassis or repositioning
of<00:02:12.620> the<00:02:12.739> gearbox<00:02:13.220> or<00:02:13.459> then<00:02:14.000> those<00:02:14.180> kind<00:02:14.420> of

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
of the gearbox or then those kind of

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.870 
of the gearbox or then those kind of
changes<00:02:14.989> involves<00:02:15.770> so<00:02:16.010> much<00:02:16.250> time<00:02:16.580> and<00:02:16.760> effort

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
changes involves so much time and effort

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.210 
changes involves so much time and effort
so<00:02:17.300> we<00:02:17.450> harvest<00:02:18.350> that<00:02:18.470> up<00:02:18.590> during<00:02:18.920> the<00:02:19.010> course

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
so we harvest that up during the course

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.010 
so we harvest that up during the course
of<00:02:19.370> the<00:02:19.489> year<00:02:19.670> and<00:02:19.790> go<00:02:19.910> right<00:02:20.150> now<00:02:20.180> come<00:02:20.900> the

of the year and go right now come the

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.479 
of the year and go right now come the
revolution<00:02:21.050> brothers<00:02:21.800> will<00:02:21.950> get<00:02:22.069> all<00:02:22.160> that<00:02:22.310> on

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.720 

I<00:02:41.180> find<00:02:42.180> the<00:02:42.480> technical<00:02:43.110> side<00:02:43.260> of<00:02:43.520> form<00:02:44.520> one

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
I find the technical side of form one

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.610 
I find the technical side of form one
fascinating<00:02:45.690> all<00:02:46.260> these<00:02:46.410> different

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620

a<00:02:55.170> phenomenal<00:02:55.530> process<00:02:55.980> I<00:02:56.100> think<00:02:56.130> we're

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
a phenomenal process I think we're

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.510 
a phenomenal process I think we're
always<00:02:57.180> looking<00:02:57.660> to<00:02:58.080> improve<00:02:58.560> apart

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
steep hill and every year you you attack

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:15.410 
steep hill and every year you you attack
it<00:04:13.739> in<00:04:13.980> a<00:04:14.069> slightly<00:04:14.250> different<00:04:14.430> way<00:04:14.670> but
