vidya video chip set in it and due to a
lousy<00:01:03.739> design<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:05.159> a<00:01:05.640> crappy<00:01:06.420> motherboard

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
lousy design and a crappy motherboard

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.880 
lousy design and a crappy motherboard
the<00:01:08.100> video<00:01:08.729> card<00:01:09.030> and<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.869> main<00:01:10.200> processor

the video card and the main processor

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.370 
the video card and the main processor
are<00:01:11.130> extremely<00:01:11.760> close<00:01:11.939> together<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:12.780> share

are extremely close together and share

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.020 
are extremely close together and share
the<00:01:14.100> same<00:01:14.720> cooling<00:01:15.720> source<00:01:16.229> which<00:01:17.220> is<00:01:17.460> way<00:01:17.970> too

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
the same cooling source which is way too

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.050 
the same cooling source which is way too
small<00:01:18.210> for<00:01:18.960> what<00:01:18.990> happens<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:19.860> in<00:01:20.610> essence

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
small for what happens and in essence

small for what happens and in essence
what<00:01:21.270> takes<00:01:21.509> place<00:01:21.630> is<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.939> video<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.930> video

what takes place is the video the video
a<00:01:25.290> chip<00:01:25.860> gets<00:01:26.220> so<00:01:26.610> hot<00:01:27.150> that<00:01:27.479> it<00:01:27.869> basically

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
a chip gets so hot that it basically

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.130 
a chip gets so hot that it basically
desolder<00:01:29.579> zit<00:01:30.000> self<00:01:30.299> from<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.659> motherboard

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
desolder zit self from the motherboard

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.480 
desolder zit self from the motherboard
and<00:01:31.380> you<00:01:32.040> get<00:01:32.369> a<00:01:33.270> no<00:01:33.869> video<00:01:34.170> display<00:01:34.650> or<00:01:34.920> maybe

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
and you get a no video display or maybe

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.840 
and you get a no video display or maybe
no<00:01:35.790> s-video<00:01:36.240> out<00:01:36.689> working<00:01:37.380> or<00:01:37.619> no<00:01:37.890> vga<00:01:38.430> out

no s-video out working or no vga out

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.850 
no s-video out working or no vga out
working<00:01:39.390> that's<00:01:39.600> just<00:01:39.869> a<00:01:39.960> crapshoot<00:01:40.229> of<00:01:40.680> which

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
working that's just a crapshoot of which

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.830 
working that's just a crapshoot of which
one<00:01:41.070> fails<00:01:41.490> but<00:01:42.180> eventually<00:01:42.840> it<00:01:43.380> will<00:01:43.560> fail

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
one fails but eventually it will fail

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.749 
one fails but eventually it will fail
one<00:01:45.840> of<00:01:45.930> my<00:01:46.020> best<00:01:46.259> friends<00:01:46.740> has<00:01:46.979> this<00:01:47.280> exact

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
one of my best friends has this exact

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.990 
one of my best friends has this exact
computer<00:01:48.360> we<00:01:48.869> purchased<00:01:49.380> them<00:01:49.619> 30<00:01:50.310> days<00:01:50.549> apart

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
computer we purchased them 30 days apart

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.740 
computer we purchased them 30 days apart
from<00:01:51.210> each<00:01:51.329> other<00:01:51.540> he<00:01:52.320> bought<00:01:52.560> his<00:01:52.829> first<00:01:53.130> and

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
from each other he bought his first and

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.289 
from each other he bought his first and
his<00:01:54.750> went<00:01:55.049> out<00:01:55.229> and<00:01:55.590> 30<00:01:56.130> days<00:01:56.340> later<00:01:56.700> mine<00:01:57.090> went

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
his went out and 30 days later mine went

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.830 
his went out and 30 days later mine went
out<00:01:57.509> so<00:01:57.920> um<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.700> reason<00:01:59.790> for<00:02:00.119> this<00:02:00.210> video<00:02:00.540> is

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
out so um the reason for this video is

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.020 
out so um the reason for this video is
as<00:02:01.110> i<00:02:01.320> flat-out<00:02:01.829> was<00:02:02.159> just<00:02:02.430> going<00:02:02.610> to<00:02:02.640> shoot<00:02:02.880> it

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
as i flat-out was just going to shoot it

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.280

is as much as I'm all for taking stuff

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.990 
is as much as I'm all for taking stuff
apart<00:02:22.239> and<00:02:22.750> trying<00:02:23.019> to<00:02:23.110> fix<00:02:23.319> it<00:02:23.610> in<00:02:24.610> order<00:02:24.939> to

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
apart and trying to fix it in order to

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.630 
apart and trying to fix it in order to
get<00:02:25.420> to<00:02:25.629> where<00:02:25.870> the<00:02:26.110> video<00:02:26.500> chip<00:02:26.890> is<00:02:27.159> you

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
get to where the video chip is you

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.759 
get to where the video chip is you
literally<00:02:28.420> have<00:02:28.870> to<00:02:29.079> have<00:02:29.260> this<00:02:29.500> thing

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:29.769 
literally have to have this thing

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:32.490 
literally have to have this thing
completely<00:02:30.180> disassembled<00:02:31.180> and<00:02:31.390> then<00:02:32.349> you

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
completely disassembled and then you

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.280 
completely disassembled and then you
have<00:02:32.739> to<00:02:32.769> heat<00:02:33.430> the<00:02:33.640> chip<00:02:33.909> up<00:02:34.120> well<00:02:34.480> it<00:02:34.720> sits<00:02:35.049> on

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
have to heat the chip up well it sits on

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.199 
have to heat the chip up well it sits on
the<00:02:35.439> motherboard<00:02:35.709> which<00:02:36.189> means<00:02:36.489> it<00:02:36.819> needs<00:02:36.970> to

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
the motherboard which means it needs to

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:39.869 
the motherboard which means it needs to
be<00:02:37.329> hot<00:02:37.659> enough<00:02:37.840> to<00:02:38.019> resolder<00:02:38.590> it<00:02:38.890> and<00:02:39.069> yet

00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:39.879 
be hot enough to resolder it and yet

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:42.509 
be hot enough to resolder it and yet
cool<00:02:40.299> enough<00:02:40.599> not<00:02:40.930> to<00:02:41.140> destroy<00:02:41.590> it<00:02:41.920> or<00:02:42.250> these

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
cool enough not to destroy it or these

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:45.839 
cool enough not to destroy it or these
