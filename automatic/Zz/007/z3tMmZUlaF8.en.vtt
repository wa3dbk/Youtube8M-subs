get<00:03:18.329> it<00:03:18.420> developed<00:03:19.370> you<00:03:20.370> never<00:03:20.549> know<00:03:20.640> what's

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
get it developed you never know what's

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.289 
get it developed you never know what's
on<00:03:20.880> there<00:03:21.090> good<00:03:21.390> solve<00:03:21.630> a<00:03:21.720> mystery<00:03:23.060> next<00:03:24.060> is

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
on there good solve a mystery next is

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.809 
on there good solve a mystery next is
just<00:03:24.480> basically<00:03:25.430> you<00:03:26.430> have<00:03:26.609> little

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:26.819 
just basically you have little

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:33.650 
just basically you have little
connectors<00:03:27.239> here<00:03:27.799> maybe<00:03:28.799> just<00:03:29.069> pull<00:03:29.250> over<00:03:32.660> and

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
connectors here maybe just pull over and

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.140 
connectors here maybe just pull over and
the<00:03:33.720> camera<00:03:34.019> will<00:03:34.139> begin<00:03:34.350> to<00:03:34.470> come<00:03:34.650> apart<00:03:35.150> this

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
the camera will begin to come apart this

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:44.120 
the camera will begin to come apart this
is<00:03:36.299> battery<00:03:36.480> in<00:03:36.720> there<00:03:42.620> break<00:03:43.620> the<00:03:43.739> top<00:03:43.920> off

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
is battery in there break the top off

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.240 
is battery in there break the top off
let's<00:03:45.120> roll<00:03:45.269> the<00:03:45.329> plastic<00:03:45.690> away<00:03:46.040> then<00:03:47.040> you

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
let's roll the plastic away then you

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.129 
let's roll the plastic away then you
have<00:03:47.400> your<00:03:47.579> circuit<00:03:47.880> board<00:03:48.000> we<00:03:48.840> can<00:03:48.959> then

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:49.139 
have your circuit board we can then

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:53.210 
have your circuit board we can then
remove<00:03:49.290> this<00:03:49.760> bottom<00:03:50.760> piece<00:03:51.709> take<00:03:52.709> the

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
remove this bottom piece take the

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.670 
remove this bottom piece take the
battery<00:03:53.639> out

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.270 

that<00:03:58.270> photo<00:03:59.270> flash<00:03:59.650> this<00:04:00.650> can<00:04:00.980> give<00:04:01.100> you<00:04:01.220> a

that photo flash this can give you a
nasty<00:04:01.730> nasty<00:04:01.880> shock<00:04:03.040> if<00:04:04.040> it's<00:04:04.340> a<00:04:04.400> big<00:04:04.550> enough

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
nasty nasty shock if it's a big enough

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.540 
nasty nasty shock if it's a big enough
one<00:04:04.910> it<00:04:05.180> can<00:04:05.480> kill<00:04:05.720> you<00:04:05.860> do<00:04:06.860> not<00:04:06.980> mess<00:04:07.400> with

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:07.550 
one it can kill you do not mess with

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:12.070 
one it can kill you do not mess with
those<00:04:07.700> that's<00:04:08.510> all<00:04:09.430> just<00:04:10.430> try<00:04:10.790> and<00:04:11.150> you<00:04:11.930> get<00:04:12.050> a

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:12.080 
those that's all just try and you get a

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:40.590 
those that's all just try and you get a
pop<00:04:12.320> you<00:04:12.530> short<00:04:12.770> it<00:04:12.830> out<00:04:37.870> once<00:04:38.870> this<00:04:39.020> is<00:04:39.200> out

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:40.600 
pop you short it out once this is out

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.140 
pop you short it out once this is out
that's<00:04:41.600> cut<00:04:42.280> then<00:04:43.280> you<00:04:43.310> can<00:04:43.490> mess<00:04:43.640> the<00:04:43.790> rest<00:04:44.000> of

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.150 
that's cut then you can mess the rest of

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:49.690 
that's cut then you can mess the rest of
it<00:04:45.040> you<00:04:46.810> know<00:04:47.810> on<00:04:47.960> the<00:04:48.050> keyboard<00:04:48.410> or<00:04:48.530> on<00:04:48.560> the<00:04:48.860> on

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:49.700 
it you know on the keyboard or on the on

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:50.530 
it you know on the keyboard or on the on
the<00:04:49.850> board<00:04:50.090> here

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:50.540 
the board here

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:55.840 
the board here
you<00:04:50.870> can<00:04:51.020> see<00:04:51.790> just<00:04:52.790> some<00:04:52.970> little<00:04:53.120> screws<00:04:54.850> you

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:55.850 
you can see just some little screws you

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:58.660 
you can see just some little screws you
need<00:04:56.090> to<00:04:56.150> remove<00:04:56.830> or<00:04:57.830> you<00:04:58.010> can<00:04:58.160> just<00:04:58.250> break<00:04:58.460> it

00:04:58.660 --> 00:04:58.670 
need to remove or you can just break it

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:02.260 
need to remove or you can just break it
