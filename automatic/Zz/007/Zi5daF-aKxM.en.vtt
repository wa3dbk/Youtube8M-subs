00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
and then literally after a few seconds

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.109 
and then literally after a few seconds
of<00:01:31.409> you<00:01:31.530> waiting<00:01:31.740> on<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.009> dashboard<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.670> shark

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
of you waiting on the dashboard a shark

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.120 
of you waiting on the dashboard a shark
will<00:01:33.390> spawn<00:01:33.720> out<00:01:33.990> of<00:01:34.439> nowhere<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:35.040> it's

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
will spawn out of nowhere and it's

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.160 
will spawn out of nowhere and it's
literally<00:01:35.579> as<00:01:35.759> easy<00:01:36.150> as<00:01:36.420> that<00:01:36.509> it<00:01:36.810> doesn't

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
literally as easy as that it doesn't

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.440 
literally as easy as that it doesn't
seem<00:01:37.380> legit<00:01:37.829> you<00:01:38.400> would<00:01:38.549> think<00:01:38.670> doing<00:01:38.939> that<00:01:39.180> it

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
seem legit you would think doing that it

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.090 
seem legit you would think doing that it
just<00:01:39.659> wouldn't<00:01:39.960> work<00:01:40.079> but<00:01:40.500> for<00:01:40.619> some<00:01:40.770> reason

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
just wouldn't work but for some reason

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.280 
just wouldn't work but for some reason
just<00:01:41.130> by<00:01:41.460> doing<00:01:41.520> that<00:01:41.909> it<00:01:42.360> somehow<00:01:42.750> manages<00:01:43.200> to

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
just by doing that it somehow manages to

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.929 
just by doing that it somehow manages to
get<00:01:43.500> a<00:01:43.560> shark<00:01:43.920> to<00:01:44.100> spawn<00:01:44.369> in<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.640> game<00:01:44.790> now

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
get a shark to spawn in the game now

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.730 
get a shark to spawn in the game now
sometimes<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:46.020> shark<00:01:46.259> will<00:01:46.380> actually<00:01:46.649> be

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
sometimes the shark will actually be

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.649 
sometimes the shark will actually be
frozen<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.430> then<00:01:47.729> as<00:01:48.090> you<00:01:48.210> can<00:01:48.329> see<00:01:48.450> you<00:01:48.570> will

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
frozen and then as you can see you will

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:49.789 
frozen and then as you can see you will
actually<00:01:48.869> unfreeze<00:01:49.259> and<00:01:49.470> start<00:01:49.649> moving

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
actually unfreeze and start moving

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.950 
actually unfreeze and start moving
around<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:50.520> it<00:01:50.729> doesn't<00:01:50.759> seem<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.479> attack<00:01:51.840> you

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
around and it doesn't seem to attack you

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.539 
around and it doesn't seem to attack you
neither<00:01:52.110> kinda<00:01:52.409> just<00:01:52.560> swims<00:01:52.860> around<00:01:53.220> you<00:01:53.399> can

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
neither kinda just swims around you can

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.310 
neither kinda just swims around you can
actually<00:01:53.670> kill<00:01:54.060> it<00:01:54.149> though<00:01:54.360> and<00:01:54.570> you<00:01:54.990> can<00:01:55.110> see

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
actually kill it though and you can see

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.929 
actually kill it though and you can see
died<00:01:55.590> and<00:01:55.890> then<00:01:55.979> you<00:01:56.070> can<00:01:56.310> go<00:01:56.430> ahead<00:01:56.549> and<00:01:56.700> get

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
died and then you can go ahead and get

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.760 
died and then you can go ahead and get
another<00:01:57.119> one<00:01:57.270> to<00:01:57.390> spawn<00:01:57.630> again<00:01:57.750> I'll<00:01:58.259> by<00:01:58.500> doing

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
another one to spawn again I'll by doing

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.380 
another one to spawn again I'll by doing
the<00:01:58.860> same<00:01:59.100> trick<00:01:59.430> again<00:01:59.579> so<00:02:00.000> something

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
the same trick again so something

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.330 
the same trick again so something
definitely<00:02:00.899> pretty<00:02:01.140> or<00:02:01.290> some<00:02:01.530> very<00:02:01.920> very<00:02:02.130> easy

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
definitely pretty or some very very easy

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.700 
definitely pretty or some very very easy
to<00:02:02.610> do<00:02:02.729> as<00:02:02.969> well<00:02:03.360> a<00:02:03.600> quick<00:02:04.049> cronic<00:02:04.320> does<00:02:04.469> go<00:02:04.619> out

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
to do as well a quick cronic does go out

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.350 
to do as well a quick cronic does go out
to<00:02:04.860> surveyed<00:02:05.280> I<00:02:05.369> did<00:02:05.490> originally<00:02:05.880> see<00:02:06.030> this<00:02:06.180> on

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
to surveyed I did originally see this on

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.540 
to surveyed I did originally see this on
his<00:02:06.570> channel<00:02:06.840> but<00:02:07.469> if<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:07.829> original<00:02:08.069> found

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
his channel but if the original found

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.669 
his channel but if the original found
that<00:02:08.759> is<00:02:08.910> someone<00:02:09.239> known<00:02:09.450> as<00:02:09.479> sour<00:02:09.959> OG<00:02:10.229> so<00:02:10.560> you

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
that is someone known as sour OG so you

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:11.950 
that is someone known as sour OG so you
can<00:02:10.800> check<00:02:10.950> out<00:02:11.039> both<00:02:11.220> for<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.459> links

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960 
can check out both for the links

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.080 
can check out both for the links
down<00:02:12.350> below<00:02:12.680> as<00:02:12.890> well<00:02:12.920> so<00:02:13.490> with<00:02:13.790> that<00:02:13.910> being

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
down below as well so with that being

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.340 
down below as well so with that being
said<00:02:14.180> that<00:02:14.510> pretty<00:02:14.720> much<00:02:14.870> wraps<00:02:15.110> it<00:02:15.200> up<00:02:15.290> for

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
said that pretty much wraps it up for

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.050 
said that pretty much wraps it up for
today's<00:02:15.710> video<00:02:16.010> I'm<00:02:16.250> not<00:02:16.280> entirely<00:02:16.730> sure<00:02:16.880> if

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
today's video I'm not entirely sure if

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.580 
today's video I'm not entirely sure if
this<00:02:17.150> does<00:02:17.450> work<00:02:17.660> on<00:02:17.840> the<00:02:17.960> PlayStation<00:02:18.560> 4

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
this does work on the PlayStation 4

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.680 
this does work on the PlayStation 4
another<00:02:19.340> dashboard<00:02:19.670> systems<00:02:20.270> are<00:02:20.450> pretty

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
another dashboard systems are pretty

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.240 
another dashboard systems are pretty
similar<00:02:20.900> so<00:02:21.140> it<00:02:21.260> should<00:02:21.530> work<00:02:21.710> but<00:02:21.770> I<00:02:21.980> haven't

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
similar so it should work but I haven't

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.490 
similar so it should work but I haven't
actually<00:02:22.430> got<00:02:22.670> around<00:02:22.850> to<00:02:23.330> enough<00:02:23.510> time<00:02:23.720> to

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
actually got around to enough time to

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.020 
actually got around to enough time to
actually<00:02:24.620> go<00:02:24.830> ahead<00:02:24.980> and<00:02:25.100> test<00:02:25.460> it<00:02:25.640> yet<00:02:25.820> so<00:02:25.970> if

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
actually go ahead and test it yet so if

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.980 
actually go ahead and test it yet so if
you<00:02:26.120> guys<00:02:26.210> can<00:02:26.390> let<00:02:26.450> me<00:02:26.510> know<00:02:26.600> down<00:02:26.810> in<00:02:26.870> the

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
you guys can let me know down in the
