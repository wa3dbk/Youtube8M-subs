00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:10.710
 I was always nice to win 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.960
 Any prizes can win that you must 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.760
 Now you must try to win that money 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.380
 as I am always for any game 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.520
 but is also a game of final 

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:20.640
 I don't want to be in the eternal 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.170
 dawn was very easy game 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.540
 no certainly not i think we are good we 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.160
 We did n't start that much 

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:28.169
 create opportunities but was a threat 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.970
 becoming just like their last bullying than 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:32.430
 not but were beautiful combinations 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.230
 at it may not be the nicest 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.750
 scale are those on round your career how 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.910
 would you describe this as my first 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.670
 Jonker it scale so very happy with it 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.129
 and I fought hard again, I think 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.840
 reasonable to good moment had a 2nd 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.859
 half past the goal actually in my 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.890
 sank 

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:52.859
 luck is caught then again but you 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.120
 must learn from it and insure it 

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:56.100
 is only written that we 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.690
 have the same team that we are the clover 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.010
 but we still have to 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.660
 and I think we do 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.249
 sharper 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.989
 Is it then that way right away 

00:01:02.249 --> 00:01:05.790
 the first real match of it 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.810
 season a nice week on cabbage that it 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.430
 does not happen automatically 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.080
 well i think we are glad we did 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.659
 eventually still win but I think 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.420
 that the good signal is good and that 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.850
 We do have to realize that it is not a gift 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.740
 get this season and everyone will love it 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.420
 want to win us and certainly if you go 3 times 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.149
 in a row champion is this kind 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.100
 you sometimes need competitions in terms of 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:27.780
 suspense all and again I had 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.149
 rather than a late season season 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.219
 played such a game but mentally 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:33.810
 area and also just being aware of that 

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:35.009
 we always have you looking for it 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.380
 Fight that it's not just one 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.810
 walk-over it has turned out to be 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.430
 its i'm glad we got it back 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.539
 have arrived and finally three more 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:47.579
 two make and yet gives a 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:48.270
 feel good I think the game should 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.909
 sometimes better 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.799
 luckily we drag the movement and and 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.049
 for a mental thing in the weather one step 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.670
 I have not played well 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.820
 fortunately a few moments makes me 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:03.320
 glad i can be important and yet 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.320
 another great prize for the team
