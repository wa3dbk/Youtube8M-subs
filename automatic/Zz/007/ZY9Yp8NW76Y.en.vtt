00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:09.600 

you

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:09.610 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:12.000 

by<00:00:09.970> the<00:00:10.030> driver<00:00:10.630> an<00:00:11.140> American<00:00:11.560> friend<00:00:11.710> from

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:12.010 
by the driver an American friend from

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:13.860 
by the driver an American friend from
Alaska<00:00:12.220> and<00:00:12.730> al<00:00:12.850> Qaeda<00:00:13.180> and<00:00:13.360> Tom<00:00:13.510> for<00:00:13.690> free

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:13.870 
Alaska and al Qaeda and Tom for free

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:24.880 
Alaska and al Qaeda and Tom for free
here<00:00:19.230> so<00:00:20.230> this<00:00:20.350> is<00:00:20.830> something<00:00:21.100> that

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:24.890 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.390 

much<00:00:25.220> more<00:00:25.460> stable<00:00:26.119> this<00:00:27.019> is<00:00:27.080> the<00:00:27.410> calmly<00:00:28.009> in

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:28.400 
much more stable this is the calmly in

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:41.990 
much more stable this is the calmly in
this<00:00:28.580> scenario<00:00:30.880> so<00:00:31.880> actually

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000 

so<00:00:43.000> you<00:00:43.059> can<00:00:43.300> just<00:00:43.480> imagine<00:00:43.750> that<00:00:44.379> code

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.010 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.690 

we<00:00:48.730> land<00:00:49.059> a<00:00:49.120> void<00:00:49.300> object<00:00:49.960> this<00:00:50.559> time<00:00:50.620> with<00:00:51.100> ABS

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:51.700 
we land a void object this time with ABS

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.790 
we land a void object this time with ABS
switched<00:00:52.300> on<00:00:52.570> and<00:00:52.960> you<00:00:53.200> watch<00:00:53.410> what<00:00:53.680> the

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:53.800 
switched on and you watch what the

00:00:53.800 --> 00:01:21.870 
switched on and you watch what the
difference<00:00:54.130> is<00:00:55.710> so<00:00:56.710> you<00:00:56.770> can<00:00:56.980> clearly<00:00:57.280> see

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.310 

so<00:01:22.880> then<00:01:23.060> you'll<00:01:23.240> see<00:01:23.450> the<00:01:23.780> same<00:01:23.810> maneuver

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
so then you'll see the same maneuver

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.670 
so then you'll see the same maneuver
done<00:01:24.950> in<00:01:25.310> the<00:01:25.580> second<00:01:25.940> car<00:01:26.260> so<00:01:27.260> you'll<00:01:27.380> see<00:01:27.560> the

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
done in the second car so you'll see the

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.290 
done in the second car so you'll see the
