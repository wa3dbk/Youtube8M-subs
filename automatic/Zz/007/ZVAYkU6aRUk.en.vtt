00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:06.270
 two more years 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:15.049
 and then just how about youtube friends 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:17.869
 here I bring this this me this 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:20.210
 teach them a seed from here of the del 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:22.400
 minecraft out they discovered I do not know if 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:26.390
 there is someone else that the keel raised it 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:31.590
 but now I have not seen the seed 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:35.310
 this is called yolo with a capital 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.710
 so I will be then put in difficulty 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:40.579
 peaceful so they can see this what 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:44.530
 the seed is coming 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:44.530
 let's wait here load the map 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.600
 good that such friends of youtube one 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.489
 already being here in the seed one day 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:56.790
 after passing the video this map 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:58.680
 has expectations of being flat is 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:01.230
 almost completely flat and those who 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:05.550
 want to make your map in something flat this 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:09.810
 this is a well varied map of trees 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:11.520
 and you can do that plane and good here 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.640
 they can build their house and as they saw 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.700
 at the beginning found clay too 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:21.090
 for those who want so at the beginning 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.850
 also this is a good map to have 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.160
 the clay and as you can see there is this 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.840
 good is going to give a tour there was 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.310
 pass the video to be in another 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.930
 section of the map and that you can 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:36.820
 see how it is differentiated from 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:39.460
 some things on the map good 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:43.240
 well here they are in another part of the map 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:47.290
 this here we can observe the fullness 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.640
 from here this good we will advance a 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:51.490
 bit 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:54.970
 let's see mountains what has been 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:58.150
 the trees and this map I like what 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:00.670
 peculiar because the truth is that almost not 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:03.340
 there are many things in places where where 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.259
 is therefore where there is nothing or where 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:09.369
 it is flat and there you can do your 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:11.770
 houses and I just discovered this 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.720
 a few minutes ago and I wanted to 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.510
 convert this for youtube already having 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.730
 my captor and I hope that they 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.790
 have liked and there you can 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.950
 observe more the map in what comes 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:27.400
 being the respond to some other 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:29.890
 parts there are also parts or places that 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:33.300
 they are floating as they see this one that is 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:36.940
 here and here another thing that is there 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:39.750
 and well I hope you liked it and 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:44.310
 here I hope you like it and 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.310
