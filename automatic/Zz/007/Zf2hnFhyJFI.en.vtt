explain<00:00:37.620> it<00:00:37.770> right<00:00:37.920> to<00:00:38.190> you<00:00:38.399> she<00:00:39.120> nodded<00:00:39.390> that

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
explain it right to you she nodded that

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.410 
explain it right to you she nodded that
she<00:00:39.840> had<00:00:40.250> fine<00:00:41.250> you<00:00:41.670> just<00:00:41.910> found<00:00:42.030> a<00:00:42.120> recessive

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
she had fine you just found a recessive

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.979 
she had fine you just found a recessive
gene<00:00:42.600> you<00:00:43.050> see<00:00:43.290> a<00:00:43.500> what<00:00:44.250> a<00:00:44.489> recessive<00:00:45.360> gene<00:00:45.539> no

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
gene you see a what a recessive gene no

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.240 
gene you see a what a recessive gene no
go<00:00:46.260> back<00:00:46.410> to<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.710> start

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
go back to the start

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.220 
go back to the start
you<00:00:47.730> get<00:00:47.850> one<00:00:48.090> copy<00:00:48.360> of<00:00:48.510> each<00:00:48.690> gene<00:00:48.960> from<00:00:49.170> your

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
you get one copy of each gene from your

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.020 
you get one copy of each gene from your
mother<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:49.770> one<00:00:49.980> copy<00:00:50.219> of<00:00:50.399> each<00:00:50.550> gene<00:00:50.820> from

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
mother and one copy of each gene from

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:51.560 
mother and one copy of each gene from
your<00:00:51.180> father

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
your father

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.689 
your father
and<00:00:52.079> sometimes<00:00:52.620> these<00:00:52.890> genes<00:00:53.190> come<00:00:53.430> in<00:00:53.520> two

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
and sometimes these genes come in two

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.020 
and sometimes these genes come in two
varieties<00:00:54.140> dominant<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.289> recessive<00:00:56.030> so

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
varieties dominant and recessive so

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.220 
varieties dominant and recessive so
let's<00:00:57.210> say<00:00:57.390> you<00:00:57.449> get<00:00:57.629> a<00:00:57.690> dominant<00:00:58.199> allele

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
let's say you get a dominant allele

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.069 
let's say you get a dominant allele
front<00:00:58.680> allele<00:00:58.969> it's<00:00:59.969> like<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.329> flavor<00:01:00.690> of<00:01:00.899> a

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
front allele it's like the flavor of a

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.380 
front allele it's like the flavor of a
gene<00:01:01.289> genes<00:01:02.160> that<00:01:02.309> have<00:01:02.460> multiple<00:01:02.789> types<00:01:03.090> are

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
gene genes that have multiple types are

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.299 
gene genes that have multiple types are
said<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.629> have<00:01:03.719> multiple<00:01:04.170> alleles<00:01:04.320> for

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
said to have multiple alleles for

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.190 
said to have multiple alleles for
example<00:01:05.640> those<00:01:05.790> earlobes<00:01:06.390> hang<00:01:06.840> off<00:01:06.960> those

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
example those earlobes hang off those

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.230 
example those earlobes hang off those
seashells<00:01:07.530> of<00:01:07.979> yours<00:01:08.130> they<00:01:08.760> could<00:01:08.909> be<00:01:09.000> hanging

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
seashells of yours they could be hanging

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.270 
seashells of yours they could be hanging
or<00:01:09.630> they<00:01:09.840> could<00:01:09.990> be<00:01:10.080> attached<00:01:10.409> and<00:01:10.770> those

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
or they could be attached and those

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.920 
or they could be attached and those
possibilities<00:01:11.820> are<00:01:12.180> determined<00:01:12.540> by<00:01:12.630> which

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
possibilities are determined by which

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.499 
possibilities are determined by which
alleles<00:01:13.439> of<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.680> earlobe<00:01:14.130> gene<00:01:14.400> you<00:01:14.580> get<00:01:14.820> you

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
alleles of the earlobe gene you get you

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.420 
alleles of the earlobe gene you get you
get<00:01:15.720> that<00:01:15.900> hanging<00:01:16.320> varieties<00:01:16.860> or<00:01:17.340> the

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
get that hanging varieties or the

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.899 
get that hanging varieties or the
attached<00:01:17.759> varieties<00:01:18.420> you<00:01:18.990> follow<00:01:19.290> I<00:01:19.680> think<00:01:20.670> so

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
attached varieties you follow I think so

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.210 
attached varieties you follow I think so
well<00:01:21.180> alright<00:01:21.570> then<00:01:21.650> let's<00:01:22.650> say<00:01:22.740> you<00:01:22.830> have<00:01:22.950> two

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
well alright then let's say you have two

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.920 
well alright then let's say you have two
alleles<00:01:23.520> for<00:01:23.790> eye<00:01:24.000> color<00:01:24.270> one<00:01:24.600> of<00:01:24.689> them<00:01:24.780> gives

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
alleles for eye color one of them gives

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.300 
alleles for eye color one of them gives
you<00:01:25.080> blue<00:01:25.409> eyes<00:01:25.590> and<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:25.920> other<00:01:26.040> gives<00:01:26.159> you

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
you blue eyes and the other gives you

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.450 
you blue eyes and the other gives you
brown<00:01:26.640> eyes<00:01:27.380> now<00:01:28.380> you<00:01:28.409> get<00:01:28.680> one<00:01:28.920> copy<00:01:29.159> of<00:01:29.310> the

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
brown eyes now you get one copy of the

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.399 
brown eyes now you get one copy of the
gene<00:01:29.490> from<00:01:29.850> your<00:01:29.909> mother<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.420> one<00:01:30.509> copy<00:01:31.259> of

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
gene from your mother and one copy of

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.440 
gene from your mother and one copy of
the<00:01:31.560> gene<00:01:31.590> from<00:01:31.920> your<00:01:32.070> father<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:32.640> they<00:01:33.270> can

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
the gene from your father and they can

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.109 
the gene from your father and they can
be<00:01:33.540> dominant<00:01:33.750> or<00:01:34.110> recessive<00:01:34.700> so<00:01:35.700> let's<00:01:35.909> say

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
be dominant or recessive so let's say

here<00:01:36.420> that<00:01:36.630> brown<00:01:36.869> eyes<00:01:37.140> are<00:01:37.320> dominant<00:01:37.770> and

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
here that brown eyes are dominant and

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.249 
here that brown eyes are dominant and
blue<00:01:38.310> eyes<00:01:38.490> are<00:01:38.729> recessive<00:01:39.090> if<00:01:39.450> you<00:01:39.930> have<00:01:40.020> two

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
blue eyes are recessive if you have two

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.410 
blue eyes are recessive if you have two
copies<00:01:40.650> of<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.829> dominant<00:01:41.280> brown<00:01:41.520> gene<00:01:41.850> you'll

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
copies of the dominant brown gene you'll

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.450 
copies of the dominant brown gene you'll
have<00:01:42.630> brown<00:01:42.869> eyes<00:01:43.079> if<00:01:43.890> you<00:01:43.979> have<00:01:44.070> two<00:01:44.250> copies

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
have brown eyes if you have two copies

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.819 
have brown eyes if you have two copies
of<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.850> blue-eyed<00:01:45.270> recessive<00:01:45.899> gene<00:01:46.079> you'll

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
of the blue-eyed recessive gene you'll

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.219 
of the blue-eyed recessive gene you'll
have<00:01:47.009> blue<00:01:47.280> eyes<00:01:47.329> but<00:01:48.329> if<00:01:48.420> you<00:01:48.509> have<00:01:48.630> one<00:01:48.899> copy

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
have blue eyes but if you have one copy

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.499 
have blue eyes but if you have one copy
of<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.500> brown-eyed<00:01:49.920> gene<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:50.520> one<00:01:51.000> copy<00:01:51.240> of<00:01:51.390> a

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
blue-eyed gene the dominant gene wins

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.700 
blue-eyed gene the dominant gene wins
and<00:01:53.939> you'll<00:01:54.030> still<00:01:54.329> have<00:01:54.509> brown<00:01:54.810> eyes<00:01:54.990> well

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
and you'll still have brown eyes well

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.230 
and you'll still have brown eyes well

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
not so fast babe there's a bit more this

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:35.920 
not so fast babe there's a bit more this
is<00:02:34.250> a<00:02:34.400> nice<00:02:34.610> example<00:02:35.120> you<00:02:35.209> see<00:02:35.450> one<00:02:35.660> they<00:02:35.780> like

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
is a nice example you see one they like

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.930 
is a nice example you see one they like
to<00:02:35.989> put<00:02:36.110> all<00:02:36.260> the<00:02:36.530> textbooks<00:02:37.190> but<00:02:37.430> it<00:02:37.790> ain't

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
to put all the textbooks but it ain't

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.059 
to put all the textbooks but it ain't
true<00:02:38.239> and<00:02:38.480> they<00:02:38.540> ain't<00:02:38.720> being<00:02:38.959> square<00:02:39.560> there's

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
true and they ain't being square there's

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:41.259 
true and they ain't being square there's
more<00:02:40.250> than<00:02:40.400> just<00:02:40.430> one<00:02:40.730> gene<00:02:40.970> that<00:02:41.150> controls

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:41.269 
more than just one gene that controls

more than just one gene that controls
eye<00:02:41.630> color<00:02:41.900> there's<00:02:42.170> less<00:02:42.500> that's<00:02:43.220> why<00:02:43.370> you

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
eye color there's less that's why you

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:44.890 
eye color there's less that's why you
don't<00:02:43.610> have<00:02:43.760> just<00:02:43.940> brown<00:02:44.239> and<00:02:44.420> blue<00:02:44.540> eyes<00:02:44.690> in

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
don't have just brown and blue eyes in

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.600 
don't have just brown and blue eyes in
the<00:02:44.989> world<00:02:45.019> you<00:02:45.380> get<00:02:45.500> all<00:02:45.620> different<00:02:45.980> various

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610

remember so what do I tell my husband

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.140 
remember so what do I tell my husband
you'd<00:02:54.110> tell<00:02:54.350> him<00:02:54.440> you<00:02:54.620> had<00:02:54.890> an<00:02:55.010> affair<00:02:55.430> but<00:02:56.120> I

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
you'd tell him you had an affair but I

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.740 
you'd tell him you had an affair but I
told<00:02:56.450> you<00:02:56.569> I<00:02:56.660> didn't<00:02:57.080> well<00:02:57.560> didn't<00:02:57.980> you<00:02:58.750> and

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
told you I didn't well didn't you and

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.600 
told you I didn't well didn't you and
then<00:02:59.930> just<00:03:00.200> like<00:03:00.410> she<00:03:00.560> derives<00:03:00.890> she<00:03:01.130> blew<00:03:01.459> out

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.130 
then just like she derives she blew out
