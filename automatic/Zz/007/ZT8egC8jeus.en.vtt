00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:08.800
 voodoo 

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:08.800
 deh p Lord 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:18.139
 Mosquito dance dance guard 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.139
 This is a wild mosquito's blogger 

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:26.400
 Here there is a mosquito of the lag in 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:37.340
 It is a light guard on the hook of the thin axis of the mosquito in the whole of trouble 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.910
 More than a month 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:43.360
 And 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:46.510
 Because files are often used in bait finesse 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:50.490
 Hook of the degree axis 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:54.210
 And hard guard comes with 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:01:01.140
 It is this double guard but this guard is fine 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:03.530
 Kedomo I'm being told not you there to everywhere Well, this one by one is actually in Japan 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.530
 It is made by 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:10.510
 Because it becomes quite Japan 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:14.830
 Against this movement 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:17.320
 This hard to fall this is that it is one that's one 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:21.930
 Easy to fall 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.930
 However , to be able to see people from Japan 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.370
 By attaching 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:31.180
 When No. 5 sex is born and goes to fall 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:33.680
 Really, the removal which is used actually It is good even with this pattern bitterness, but as one's favorite 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.010
 I just spread a bit 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:39.830
 In 4 minutes 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:42.730
 If you have a slight degree of leedown or open wood areas 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.409
 I need to keep this guard 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:48.240
 It is difficult to stick shipping 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:52.369
 If this is a man of one composition, it will be caught 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.369
 That 's why I made this dub 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:02:01.330
 If you say why you thought you would make this grab guard for 8 years ago 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:05.560
 I thought that I would like to have a problem, but I started making it 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:07.330
 And of course that thick guard 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:13.490
 I will attach to 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:16.780
 However, when the thick metal sound is attached, that metal fatigue is intense. Let's go to the question only 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:21.760
 'D end break from here when bent 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:27.819
 I went searching for various materials, but I couldn't get anything satisfactory. 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:30.780
 The rest is brush guard It is considerable when we try to get that reverse synthesis that brush guard is 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:30.780
 Nde becomes thicker 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:40.920
 If the brush guard receives water against the war disaster fishing it can be done a little 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:51.150
 I thought it was quite early though I thought it was not, but 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:51.250
 Hyo''s that over good in great guard if over and hooking by putting this Juraku Kati book 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.910
 The 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:57.220
 Kedomo it does not may also be a Luo hooking not it bad 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:01.810
 Here is open 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:04.840
 When it comes out from the mouth of the pass work, it will be stuck 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:09.940
 I'm acting on my behalf 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:14.560
 As it enters and turns and sticks in Kuzumi , when one falls down and is pierced 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:16.410
 That's why it's hard in Japan, but it should be here, but if one falls 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:21.570
 When booking comes steady 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:23.290
 I 'm wild here, so I got a tight fit and a big hook with a strong guard. 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:27.750
 Even though I 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:30.720
 Something's here usually in the case of use in 6 spinning 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:33.130
 I think it's a double -osce 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:36.220
 It is considerable by using this 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:41.030
 Well to recover in the weak force 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:43.920
 Is light this guard also flows into the obstacle with respect to what 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:46.750
 As the calmon terminal is strong in zade 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.980
 I think I will guard enough 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:54.790
 But when used for heavy 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:58.379
 If I put it, I would say it by weight . 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.379
 I think to be a here speaking 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:06.010
 I want to do it in the wild 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:08.930
 Emaopu I'd end had this test much 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:16.130
 I think I do not this catch at Toka roses 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:16.959
 This is mixed on the way there is a thin between this hook and I try not to go back 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:21.759
 you know 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:27.460
 If it is done like this, it's fine to go here 

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:30.180
 Well such because a sufficient guard tax is no longer even in the Masun the Tteyuu stick 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:34.400
 When doing complicated things, it is already here 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:37.009
 line is about 6 or 8 pounds 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:41.740
 What is more amazing is a multiple brother 

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:41.740
 Attach them also because use or bait finesse 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.580
 Minutes
