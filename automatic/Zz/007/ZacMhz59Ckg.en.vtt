00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.220
 walking alongside the moron rabbits 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.580
 for many years rehman had 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.869
 a little vanished from the videogame landscape 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.430
 one of the big names of the 2d platform 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.460
 so back to his first love with 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.109
 an old-fashioned origins rayman 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.089
 an old school side that goes up 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.199
 the lack of a real scenario with 

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:33.059
 only a few big bad guys to 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.930
 eliminate history of keeping the peace 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.250
 in this colorful universe in the skin of 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.969
 Rayman or other characters 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.739
 available 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.470
 you will have gone through sixty 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.239
 levels all articulated around a 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.379
 theme whether it's the jungle the sea and 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.239
 well again the music 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:52.229
 these have in common a universe 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:54.449
 hyper detailed developed with the engine 

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:57.989
 of the rayman origins billiard framework 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.399
 offer beautiful scenery one side 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.399
 handmade full of curves that gives 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.750
 often an impression of cartoons 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:05.519
 the animation is not left with 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.030
 flexible characters that advances with a 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.030
 great fluidity 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.480
 if they are missing as for them a 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.870
 little depth their mimicry their 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:16.760
 gives a lot of life a mood 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.140
 warm and very delirious happening 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:22.000
 also by a very varied soundtrack 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.000
 giving fishing to each party 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:27.830
 possessing several accessible abilities 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.870
 as you go 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:33.290
 rayman can hover or even swim 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:34.640
 run on curved walls and a 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.510
 range of movements put to contribution 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.590
 in often twisted levels 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:41.510
 imposing a nervous rhythm 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.500
 rayman origins compels to calculate well 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:46.670
 his jumps and especially to be very responsive 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.170
 of course it is possible to 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.460
 take your time and browse the 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.410
 last few go in search of 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.770
 loose or voters often very well 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.770
 hidden 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.520
 the most interesting however remains the 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.440
 quest for the pieces of death that are 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.340
 often very difficult to access and put 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.340
 your life at risk 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.370
 especially as the game is showing 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:10.140
 intractable that the slightest contact with 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:11.890
 an enemy turns out to be fatal 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.060
 luckily it is possible to find 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.770
 hearts functioning as a 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.120
 shield and your companions can 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.120
 always bring you back into the part 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.110
 the interest of multiplayer is there 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.780
 with a difficulty that is reduced in 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.340
 depending on the number of players a little 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.750
 confusing but very amusing 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.880
 four-player sessions alternate 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:35.230
 between vicious blows and resurrection at the 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:37.720
 stolen very well thought be it in 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.890
 solo or in multi rayman origins suffers 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.900
 yet some problems of 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.000
 particular gameplay in the followed jumps 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.330
 of a gliding flight where accelerations that 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.890
 often have trouble triggering a 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.480
 problem who sometimes know annoying about 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.420
 portions but you're denying 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.950
 in no way a very pleasant experience 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.250
 for his return and man has rather well 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.250
 do things 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:06.019
 the note that killed 17 out of 20
