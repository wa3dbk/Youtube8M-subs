00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
base for Penn State I know their defense

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.380 
base for Penn State I know their defense
is<00:01:35.070> there<00:01:35.310> they'll<00:01:35.520> give<00:01:35.670> a<00:01:35.790> less<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.180> some

fits<00:01:36.720> their<00:01:37.110> offense<00:01:37.619> but<00:01:38.280> can<00:01:38.640> their<00:01:38.880> offense

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
fits their offense but can their offense

make<00:01:40.380> plays<00:01:40.680> against<00:01:41.159> LSU<00:01:41.640> defense<00:01:42.270> was<00:01:42.420> a

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
make plays against LSU defense was a

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.780 
make plays against LSU defense was a
good<00:01:42.689> secondary<00:01:43.170> that's<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:43.950> key<00:01:44.159> I<00:01:44.340> think

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
good secondary that's the key I think

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.510

they<00:01:45.630> will<00:01:45.960> be<00:01:46.140> able<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.530> look<00:01:46.979> at<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.310> match
