00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:20.450
 Bonjour. Nous sommes très honorés d'être ici ce soir. Je suis Raph .... 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.290
 Hey, in English! Plan, Ray! Piano and in English. 

00:00:24.291 --> 00:00:25.570
 All right, you're right. 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:29.030
 I said: hi to all. We are honored to be here tonight. 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:30.270
 I'm Raphael Colantonio. 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.650
 And I Harvey Smith. 

00:00:31.651 --> 00:00:34.210
 We are the creative directors of Arkane Studios 

00:00:34.211 --> 00:00:35.990
 the creators of Dishonored. 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:38.970
 Thank you! 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.530
 Arkane was founded in 1999 with a mission 

00:00:44.531 --> 00:00:48.190
 create special games that excite us. 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.170
 Games with detailed worlds in which the game experience 

00:00:51.171 --> 00:00:54.810
 focus on the player's choices and the consequences that follow. 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.350
 We always wanted to create games based on simulation 

00:00:58.351 --> 00:01:00.430
 instead of on predefined events. Following this passion 

00:01:00.431 --> 00:01:05.130
 we have created our most ambitious game so far: Dishonored. 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:08.990
 In Dishonored, take on the role of a murderer with supernatural powers. 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.890
 You have been wrongly accused of murder and want to fix things. 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.510
 Dishonored has become famous for the unique mix of first-person action, 

00:01:18.511 --> 00:01:20.550
 exploration and stealth, 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.450
 for the art direction 

00:01:22.451 --> 00:01:24.670
 and the steampunk setting. 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:30.170
 We really want to thank the millions of fans who played Dishonored. 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.630
 On behalf of the whole team, I would like to tell you 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.890
 that your passion has been gratifying, and has inspired us enormously. 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.110
 That's why we're here tonight, 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.730
 excited to announce to you what we have prepared for you. 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:11.490
 History repeats itself. 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.750
 They put you in the wheels. 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.010
 You had an empire at your feet and you lost it ... 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.010
 Let's be honest: did you really deserve this? 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.890
 And above all, what would you do to get it back? 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.530
 But be careful: there is always a price to pay. 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.390
 Your choices will have repercussions for years. 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.370
 Blood in the sewers and corruption in the wind. 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.030
 It will be fun to watch ... 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.130
 What will you do with the powers I gave you? 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.190
 What sign will you leave in this squalid, miserable world? 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.250
 You cover your face, but I know who you are, 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.110
 ... Emily Kaldwin. 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.610
 Nothing happens by chance, everything flows ... 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.550
 That's why you're here, right now. 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:37.550
 Think carefully! If you kill me you'll be right! 

00:04:37.551 --> 00:04:39.550
 You will become a murderer like us! 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:51.490
 Years pass, but it's always nice to see a familiar face. 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:03.710
 In Dishonored 2 the island empire is again in danger 

00:05:03.711 --> 00:05:07.170
 when an otherworldly usurper settles on the throne. 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:12.870
 You will go to Karnaca, once a flourishing coastal city in the south, 

00:05:12.871 --> 00:05:16.880
 to face new opponents as you try to save the empire. 

00:05:16.881 --> 00:05:19.920
 You can decide to play as Corvo Attano 

00:05:19.921 --> 00:05:22.010
 or of Emily Kaldwin, a new character. 

00:05:22.011 --> 00:05:24.010
 Both have personal powers, 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:25.650
 peculiar weapons and gadgets. 

00:05:25.651 --> 00:05:29.189
 Of course you can creatively combine these particularities 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:30.620
 to eliminate opponents as you see fit. 

00:05:30.621 --> 00:05:34.210
 You can play flat weapons, or even complete the story without killing anyone. 

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:38.680
 We will tell you more details as soon as possible, but tonight 

00:05:38.681 --> 00:05:42.730
 we are here to announce that Dishonored 2 is coming and will be available on PC, 

00:05:42.731 --> 00:05:46.020
 Xbox One and PS4. Thank you so much! 

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.110
 And while you wait for the new game, 

00:05:56.111 --> 00:05:58.110
 we have something new 

00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:58.870
 on the original Dishonored: 

00:05:58.871 --> 00:06:01.110
 Dishonored Definitive Edition. 

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:04.910
 The complete original game, all the contents of the DLCs 

00:06:04.911 --> 00:06:09.731
 and the completely redesigned graphics for Xbox One and PS4. 

00:06:16.541 --> 00:06:19.710
 Dishonored Definitive Edition will be available this fall. 

00:06:19.711 --> 00:06:22.610
 Thank you all! Enjoy the rest of the show!
