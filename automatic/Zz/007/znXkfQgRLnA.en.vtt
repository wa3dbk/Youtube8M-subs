foods that we need to be concerned about

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:25.630 
foods that we need to be concerned about
one<00:00:23.089> is<00:00:23.269> saturated<00:00:23.989> fat<00:00:24.230> the<00:00:24.739> other<00:00:24.890> is<00:00:25.159> trans

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:25.640

one is saturated fat the other is trans
fat<00:00:26.060> let's<00:00:26.839> talk<00:00:27.019> about<00:00:27.169> saturated<00:00:27.529> fat<00:00:28.069> first

00:00:28.799 --> 00:00:28.809

fat let's talk about saturated fat first
saturated<00:00:29.809> fat<00:00:29.989> is<00:00:30.199> animal<00:00:30.890> fat<00:00:31.159> it'll<00:00:31.609> be<00:00:31.819> fat

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:32.059 
saturated fat is animal fat it'll be fat

a registered dietician can tell you
exactly<00:00:36.530> how<00:00:36.740> much<00:00:36.890> saturated<00:00:37.370> fat<00:00:37.520> you're

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.120 
exactly how much saturated fat you're

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.120 
exactly how much saturated fat you're
allowed<00:00:38.390> to<00:00:38.570> eat<00:00:38.600> each<00:00:38.900> day<00:00:38.930> let's<00:00:39.890> look<00:00:40.040> at

allowed to eat each day let's look at

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:41.910 
allowed to eat each day let's look at
the<00:00:40.220> foods<00:00:40.490> that<00:00:40.640> contain<00:00:40.940> saturated<00:00:41.570> fat

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:41.920 
the foods that contain saturated fat

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.040 
the foods that contain saturated fat
first<00:00:42.920> milk<00:00:43.490> foods<00:00:43.790> milk<00:00:44.390> foods<00:00:44.600> are<00:00:44.750> from<00:00:44.930> an

first milk foods milk foods are from an
animal<00:00:45.380> so<00:00:45.710> they<00:00:45.920> would<00:00:46.160> contain<00:00:46.400> saturated

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.000 
animal so they would contain saturated

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.130 
animal so they would contain saturated
fat<00:00:47.210> you<00:00:47.480> have<00:00:47.810> a<00:00:47.990> whole<00:00:48.290> milk<00:00:48.970> cheese<00:00:50.140> butter

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.990 
fat you have a whole milk cheese butter
and<00:00:51.440> anything<00:00:52.010> with<00:00:52.130> the<00:00:52.220> word<00:00:52.340> cream<00:00:52.730> in<00:00:52.880> it

these would all be high sources of

these would all be high sources of
saturated<00:00:58.040> fat<00:00:58.730> you<00:00:59.420> still<00:00:59.690> need<00:00:59.900> the<00:01:00.020> calcium

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:00.590 
saturated fat you still need the calcium

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.979 
saturated fat you still need the calcium
from<00:01:01.130> milk<00:01:01.220> foods<00:01:01.700> so<00:01:02.300> be<00:01:02.450> sure<00:01:02.480> you<00:01:02.780> choose

meat foods meat such as this rib would
be<00:01:16.159> very<00:01:16.399> high<00:01:16.609> in<00:01:16.759> saturated<00:01:16.999> fat<00:01:17.679> we<00:01:18.679> get<00:01:18.889> fat

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
be very high in saturated fat we get fat

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:20.620 
be very high in saturated fat we get fat
around<00:01:19.280> the<00:01:19.549> ribs<00:01:19.729> and<00:01:19.909> the<00:01:19.999> animals<00:01:20.299> get<00:01:20.450> fat

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
around the ribs and the animals get fat

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.209 
around the ribs and the animals get fat
around<00:01:20.780> the<00:01:21.049> ribs<00:01:21.259> so<00:01:21.649> you<00:01:21.710> want<00:01:21.950> to<00:01:22.039> choose

00:01:22.209 --> 00:01:22.219 
around the ribs so you want to choose

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:25.029 
around the ribs so you want to choose
leaner<00:01:22.490> cuts<00:01:22.850> like<00:01:23.119> loin<00:01:23.689> or<00:01:24.109> round<00:01:24.170> cuts<00:01:24.799> of

things like Bologna salami kielbasa

00:01:30.889 --> 00:01:33.760 
things like Bologna salami kielbasa
sausage<00:01:31.369> we<00:01:32.299> take<00:01:32.479> a<00:01:32.509> nice<00:01:32.780> lean<00:01:33.200> cut<00:01:33.469> of<00:01:33.499> meat

sausage we take a nice lean cut of meat

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.309 
sausage we take a nice lean cut of meat
we<00:01:33.950> grind<00:01:34.280> it<00:01:34.399> up<00:01:34.490> and<00:01:34.609> add<00:01:34.789> fat<00:01:35.149> to<00:01:35.569> it<00:01:35.749> so<00:01:36.229> they

00:01:36.309 --> 00:01:36.319 
we grind it up and add fat to it so they

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:38.020 
we grind it up and add fat to it so they
become<00:01:36.560> very<00:01:36.859> high<00:01:37.219> sources<00:01:37.729> of<00:01:37.850> saturated

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
become very high sources of saturated

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.929 
become very high sources of saturated
fat<00:01:38.630> and<00:01:39.439> when<00:01:39.530> it<00:01:39.619> comes<00:01:39.770> to<00:01:39.889> poultry<00:01:40.189> it's

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:40.939 
fat and when it comes to poultry it's

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:42.699 
fat and when it comes to poultry it's
the<00:01:41.149> skin<00:01:41.479> that<00:01:41.659> has<00:01:41.810> the<00:01:41.990> most<00:01:42.139> fat<00:01:42.439> so<00:01:42.679> you

00:01:42.699 --> 00:01:42.709 
the skin that has the most fat so you

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:45.309 
the skin that has the most fat so you
want<00:01:43.009> to<00:01:43.189> take<00:01:43.549> the<00:01:43.789> skin<00:01:44.029> off<00:01:44.060> before<00:01:44.689> you<00:01:44.840> eat

00:01:45.309 --> 00:01:45.319 
want to take the skin off before you eat

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.519 
want to take the skin off before you eat
it

00:01:45.519 --> 00:01:45.529 
it

00:01:45.529 --> 00:01:48.639 
it
now<00:01:46.429> again<00:01:46.819> you<00:01:46.999> can<00:01:47.029> have<00:01:47.359> meat<00:01:47.689> products<00:01:48.200> you

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649 
now again you can have meat products you

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:50.410 
now again you can have meat products you
just<00:01:48.889> need<00:01:49.039> to<00:01:49.189> budget<00:01:49.639> for<00:01:49.670> the<00:01:49.999> saturated

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
just need to budget for the saturated

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.199 
just need to budget for the saturated
fat<00:01:50.719> in<00:01:50.929> it<00:01:51.109> or<00:01:51.319> choose<00:01:51.859> some<00:01:52.399> leaner<00:01:52.609> versions

00:01:53.199 --> 00:01:53.209 
fat in it or choose some leaner versions

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:56.589 
fat in it or choose some leaner versions
now<00:01:53.990> let's<00:01:54.170> talk<00:01:54.319> about<00:01:54.380> the<00:01:54.709> trans<00:01:55.100> fat<00:01:55.599> trans

00:01:56.589 --> 00:01:56.599 
now let's talk about the trans fat trans

00:01:56.599 --> 00:01:59.199 
now let's talk about the trans fat trans
fat<00:01:56.810> is<00:01:57.200> when<00:01:57.380> we<00:01:57.499> take<00:01:57.709> an<00:01:57.829> oil<00:01:58.159> and<00:01:58.459> we<00:01:58.579> harden

00:01:59.199 --> 00:01:59.209 
fat is when we take an oil and we harden

00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:01.480 
fat is when we take an oil and we harden
it<00:01:59.450> and<00:01:59.659> then<00:02:00.049> we<00:02:00.170> use<00:02:00.409> it<00:02:00.619> in<00:02:00.799> processed

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
it and then we use it in processed

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.029 
it and then we use it in processed
products<00:02:02.060> for<00:02:02.539> example<00:02:02.630> let's<00:02:03.529> start<00:02:03.829> looking

00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:04.039 
products for example let's start looking

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:06.910 
products for example let's start looking
at<00:02:04.279> this<00:02:04.429> popcorn<00:02:05.149> this<00:02:06.049> popcorn<00:02:06.619> as<00:02:06.709> you<00:02:06.799> can

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
at this popcorn this popcorn as you can

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.820 
at this popcorn this popcorn as you can
see<00:02:07.069> by<00:02:07.219> the<00:02:07.279> label<00:02:07.729> says<00:02:08.149> six<00:02:08.660> grams<00:02:08.990> of<00:02:09.200> trans

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
see by the label says six grams of trans

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.600 
see by the label says six grams of trans
fat

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
fat

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.540 
fat
and<00:02:11.700> even<00:02:12.510> if<00:02:12.630> it<00:02:12.720> says<00:02:12.900> zero<00:02:13.230> trans<00:02:13.800> fat<00:02:13.980> you

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
and even if it says zero trans fat you

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.150 
and even if it says zero trans fat you
need<00:02:14.760> to<00:02:14.820> look<00:02:15.090> beyond<00:02:15.480> the<00:02:16.080> trans<00:02:16.380> fat<00:02:16.680> label

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
need to look beyond the trans fat label

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.260 
need to look beyond the trans fat label
and<00:02:17.310> look<00:02:17.910> at<00:02:18.210> the<00:02:18.960> hydrogenated<00:02:19.830> oil<00:02:20.190> in<00:02:20.760> the

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
and look at the hydrogenated oil in the

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.750 
and look at the hydrogenated oil in the
food<00:02:21.510> in<00:02:21.810> the<00:02:21.960> ingredients<00:02:22.620> so<00:02:22.980> you'll<00:02:23.430> see<00:02:23.640> it

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
food in the ingredients so you'll see it

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.320 
food in the ingredients so you'll see it
will<00:02:23.910> say<00:02:24.470> hydrogenated<00:02:25.470> oil<00:02:25.920> so<00:02:26.760> even<00:02:27.210> if

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
will say hydrogenated oil so even if

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.000 
will say hydrogenated oil so even if
something<00:02:27.540> says<00:02:27.810> zero<00:02:28.110> grams<00:02:28.350> of<00:02:28.560> trans<00:02:28.800> fat

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
something says zero grams of trans fat

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.460 
something says zero grams of trans fat
check<00:02:29.400> the<00:02:29.550> ingredients<00:02:30.180> for<00:02:30.660> example<00:02:31.170> this

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
check the ingredients for example this

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.530 
check the ingredients for example this
creamer<00:02:31.860> coffee<00:02:32.340> creamers<00:02:32.850> tend<00:02:33.060> to<00:02:33.150> be<00:02:33.270> very

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
creamer coffee creamers tend to be very

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.840 
creamer coffee creamers tend to be very
high<00:02:33.750> in<00:02:33.780> hydrogenated<00:02:34.500> oil<00:02:34.770> and<00:02:35.100> even<00:02:35.610> if

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
high in hydrogenated oil and even if

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.790 
high in hydrogenated oil and even if
they're<00:02:36.060> fat-free<00:02:36.510> it<00:02:36.990> can<00:02:37.170> be<00:02:37.260> the<00:02:37.410> second

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
they're fat-free it can be the second

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.760 
they're fat-free it can be the second
ingredient<00:02:37.940> so<00:02:38.940> look<00:02:39.750> at<00:02:39.959> the<00:02:40.170> ingredients

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
ingredient so look at the ingredients

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.040 
ingredient so look at the ingredients
and<00:02:40.950> use<00:02:41.190> one<00:02:41.430> that<00:02:41.580> maybe<00:02:41.870> it's<00:02:42.870> like<00:02:42.990> a

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
and use one that maybe it's like a

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.640 
and use one that maybe it's like a
fat-free<00:02:44.390> half-and-half<00:02:45.390> which<00:02:45.900> is<00:02:46.050> based<00:02:46.440> on

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
fat-free half-and-half which is based on

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.020 
fat-free half-and-half which is based on
milk<00:02:46.920> but<00:02:47.130> it's<00:02:47.250> skim<00:02:47.550> milk

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030

these products being made with liquid

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.360 
these products being made with liquid
oil<00:03:15.300> instead<00:03:16.019> of<00:03:16.080> hydrogenated<00:03:16.680> oil<00:03:16.980> our

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
oil instead of hydrogenated oil our

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.729

sweets and baked goods would also be

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.800 
sweets and baked goods would also be
high<00:03:19.950> we<00:03:20.580> can<00:03:20.730> make<00:03:20.880> many<00:03:21.090> of<00:03:21.209> them<00:03:21.420> with<00:03:21.600> oil

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
high we can make many of them with oil

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.220 
high we can make many of them with oil
so<00:03:22.620> again<00:03:23.130> you'll<00:03:23.519> find<00:03:23.850> ones<00:03:24.360> that<00:03:24.690> have<00:03:24.900> oil

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
so again you'll find ones that have oil

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.530 
so again you'll find ones that have oil
in<00:03:25.410> them<00:03:25.620> instead<00:03:25.830> of<00:03:26.040> hydrogenated<00:03:26.670> oil<00:03:26.940> so
