the<00:00:04.020> way<00:00:04.200> I<00:00:04.230> draw<00:00:04.680> an<00:00:04.830> eye<00:00:04.979> is<00:00:05.420> often<00:00:06.420> start

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
the way I draw an eye is often start

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.440 
the way I draw an eye is often start
with<00:00:06.870> the<00:00:06.990> upper<00:00:07.139> part<00:00:07.710> of<00:00:08.340> the<00:00:08.429> eye<00:00:08.460> which

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
with the upper part of the eye which

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.640 
with the upper part of the eye which
tends<00:00:09.870> to<00:00:10.050> bow<00:00:10.259> out<00:00:10.469> on<00:00:10.709> the<00:00:11.120> top<00:00:12.120> right<00:00:12.650> well

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
tends to bow out on the top right well

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.440 
tends to bow out on the top right well
you<00:00:13.889> know<00:00:14.009> on<00:00:14.160> Western<00:00:14.820> eyes<00:00:14.969> I<00:00:15.150> suppose<00:00:15.419> err

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
you know on Western eyes I suppose err

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.140 
you know on Western eyes I suppose err
and<00:00:15.839> then<00:00:16.710> on<00:00:17.039> the<00:00:17.369> bottom<00:00:17.520> it<00:00:17.850> tends<00:00:18.060> to

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
and then on the bottom it tends to

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.310 
and then on the bottom it tends to

is<00:00:30.930> hard<00:00:31.170> to<00:00:31.230> get<00:00:31.380> a<00:00:31.650> good<00:00:32.099> round<00:00:32.340> circle<00:00:32.820> see

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
is hard to get a good round circle see

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:40.460 
is hard to get a good round circle see
if<00:00:33.750> I<00:00:33.809> get<00:00:33.930> lucky<00:00:34.050> here<00:00:39.050> and<00:00:40.050> then<00:00:40.320> of<00:00:40.440> course

full of little light spots then I like

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:01.520 
full of little light spots then I like
to<00:00:57.750> draw<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:57.960> lid<00:00:58.380> next<00:00:59.570> up<00:01:00.570> on<00:01:00.809> top<00:01:01.020> grade<00:01:01.380> my

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
to draw the lid next up on top grade my

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.770 
to draw the lid next up on top grade my
pencils<00:01:01.950> breaking<00:01:02.370> see<00:01:03.059> if<00:01:03.149> I<00:01:03.180> can<00:01:03.329> draw<00:01:03.660> this

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
pencils breaking see if I can draw this

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.660 
pencils breaking see if I can draw this
with<00:01:03.899> a<00:01:03.989> broken<00:01:04.170> pencil<00:01:06.860> then<00:01:07.860> lids<00:01:08.100> also<00:01:08.490> have

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
with a broken pencil then lids also have

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:15.050 
with a broken pencil then lids also have
shadows<00:01:09.950> which<00:01:12.380> because<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.500> lid<00:01:13.710> is<00:01:14.000> is<00:01:15.000> a

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
shadows which because the lid is is a

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.789 
shadows which because the lid is is a
three-dimensional<00:01:15.810> object<00:01:15.960> it<00:01:16.350> casts<00:01:16.710> a

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
three-dimensional object it casts a

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.500 
three-dimensional object it casts a
shadow<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:17.430> no<00:01:17.549> cast<00:01:17.850> it<00:01:18.030> right<00:01:18.180> across<00:01:18.390> the

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:18.510 
shadow and no cast it right across the

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.260 
shadow and no cast it right across the
top<00:01:18.690> of<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.049> eye<00:01:19.760> sometimes<00:01:20.760> some<00:01:20.909> beautiful

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
top of the eye sometimes some beautiful

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.060 
top of the eye sometimes some beautiful
reflections<00:01:21.780> happen<00:01:22.080> up<00:01:22.260> in<00:01:22.380> that<00:01:22.530> shadow<00:01:22.830> too

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
reflections happen up in that shadow too

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.760 
reflections happen up in that shadow too
I'm<00:01:23.940> going<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.119> keep<00:01:24.240> it<00:01:24.360> simple<00:01:24.390> today<00:01:27.770> it's

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
I'm going to keep it simple today it's

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.620 
I'm going to keep it simple today it's
sort<00:01:28.920> of<00:01:28.950> outline<00:01:29.280> that<00:01:29.430> little<00:01:29.729> highlight

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
sort of outline that little highlight

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.030 
sort of outline that little highlight
area<00:01:30.900> just<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.200> make<00:01:31.380> sure<00:01:31.409> I<00:01:31.560> stay<00:01:31.830> away<00:01:32.010> from

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
area just to make sure I stay away from

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.130 
area just to make sure I stay away from
it<00:01:33.380> darkening<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.500> pupil<00:01:35.960> just<00:01:36.960> keep

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
it darkening the pupil just keep

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.900 
it darkening the pupil just keep
building<00:01:37.380> on<00:01:37.740> this

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:42.910 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:46.090 

we've<00:01:43.910> got<00:01:44.060> a<00:01:44.090> basic<00:01:44.590> basic<00:01:45.590> shape<00:01:46.010> we're

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
we've got a basic basic shape we're

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.320 
we've got a basic basic shape we're
going<00:01:46.130> to<00:01:46.310> pretend<00:01:46.550> that<00:01:46.640> that<00:01:46.730> light<00:01:47.180> is

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330 
going to pretend that that light is

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:48.720 
going to pretend that that light is
coming<00:01:47.540> from<00:01:47.630> this<00:01:47.960> direction<00:01:48.170> right<00:01:48.500> here

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:48.730 
coming from this direction right here

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:52.260 
coming from this direction right here
top<00:01:49.730> top<00:01:50.300> right<00:01:50.570> so<00:01:51.380> that<00:01:51.530> means<00:01:51.740> that<00:01:51.920> this

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
top top right so that means that this

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.050 
top top right so that means that this
this<00:01:53.270> is<00:01:53.510> a<00:01:53.720> ball<00:01:53.960> really<00:01:54.500> such<00:01:54.740> rounds<00:01:55.730> around

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
this is a ball really such rounds around

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.840 
this is a ball really such rounds around
like<00:01:56.390> a<00:01:56.420> ball<00:01:56.630> does<00:01:56.960> and<00:01:57.320> just<00:01:57.350> like<00:01:58.310> a<00:01:58.340> ball

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
like a ball does and just like a ball

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.430 
like a ball does and just like a ball
we're<00:01:59.690> like<00:01:59.840> our<00:02:00.020> earth<00:02:00.850> one<00:02:01.850> side<00:02:02.120> is<00:02:02.440> is

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
we're like our earth one side is is

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.650 
we're like our earth one side is is
darker<00:02:03.980> than<00:02:04.010> the<00:02:04.160> other<00:02:04.490> sometimes<00:02:05.150> totally

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:05.660 
darker than the other sometimes totally

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:11.370 
darker than the other sometimes totally
dark<00:02:07.780> so<00:02:08.780> I'm<00:02:08.929> going<00:02:09.110> to<00:02:09.170> just<00:02:09.320> round<00:02:09.619> this

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
dark so I'm going to just round this

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.940 
dark so I'm going to just round this
round<00:02:12.380> this<00:02:12.650> ball<00:02:13.870> inside<00:02:14.870> the<00:02:15.170> iris<00:02:15.560> it's<00:02:15.800> all

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
round this ball inside the iris it's all

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.540 
round this ball inside the iris it's all
going<00:02:16.220> on<00:02:16.340> behind<00:02:16.520> the<00:02:16.850> skin<00:02:18.430> give<00:02:19.430> this

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
going on behind the skin give this

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.000 
going on behind the skin give this
shadow<00:02:19.880> a<00:02:20.000> little<00:02:20.090> bit<00:02:20.360> of<00:02:20.480> a<00:02:20.830> little<00:02:21.830> bit<00:02:21.920> of

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
shadow a little bit of a little bit of

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.390 
shadow a little bit of a little bit of
contrast<00:02:23.500> see<00:02:24.500> if<00:02:24.560> I<00:02:24.620> can<00:02:24.800> last<00:02:25.040> before<00:02:25.250> the

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
contrast see if I can last before the

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.280 
contrast see if I can last before the
pencil<00:02:25.760> just<00:02:25.880> completely<00:02:26.300> snaps<00:02:26.720> and<00:02:27.050> I<00:02:27.140> have

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
pencil just completely snaps and I have

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.910 
pencil just completely snaps and I have
to<00:02:27.500> start<00:02:27.770> this<00:02:27.980> over<00:02:28.190> there<00:02:28.340> it<00:02:28.400> goes

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
I have to put the point of the pencil to

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.660 
I have to put the point of the pencil to
get<00:03:37.840> a<00:03:37.900> darker<00:03:38.319> for<00:03:39.010> that<00:03:39.129> pupil<00:03:39.549> in<00:03:39.640> the

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
get a darker for that pupil in the

piece<00:03:44.739> of<00:03:44.769> lead<00:03:46.680> now<00:03:47.680> I<00:03:47.709> think<00:03:47.890> what<00:03:48.189> we<00:03:48.310> need

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
piece of lead now I think what we need

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.809 
piece of lead now I think what we need
to<00:03:48.489> add<00:03:48.939> here<00:03:49.049> this<00:03:50.049> is<00:03:50.230> actually<00:03:50.680> all<00:03:51.310> would

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:51.819 
to add here this is actually all would

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:53.660 
to add here this is actually all would
be<00:03:51.939> kind<00:03:52.209> of<00:03:52.329> shaded<00:03:52.690> right<00:03:52.870> around<00:03:53.019> in<00:03:53.200> here

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
be kind of shaded right around in here

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.890 
be kind of shaded right around in here
this<00:03:54.670> could<00:03:54.849> actually<00:03:55.000> get<00:03:55.209> pretty<00:03:55.480> dark<00:03:55.690> down

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
this could actually get pretty dark down

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.880 
this could actually get pretty dark down
in<00:03:56.110> this<00:03:56.230> corner<00:03:56.560> here<00:03:57.090> depending<00:03:58.090> on<00:03:58.890> the

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890

individual lines sure they can be that

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:17.659 
individual lines sure they can be that
they<00:04:12.549> can<00:04:12.730> also<00:04:12.849> be<00:04:13.980> a<00:04:15.000> mass<00:04:16.350> especially

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.770 

you<00:04:50.860> know<00:04:51.040> you<00:04:51.790> just<00:04:52.030> work<00:04:52.240> with<00:04:52.420> what<00:04:52.600> you've

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780

right

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:02.860 

then<00:04:59.750> we<00:05:00.410> can<00:05:00.560> go<00:05:00.680> ahead<00:05:00.770> and<00:05:00.980> put<00:05:01.130> in<00:05:01.250> a<00:05:01.870> some

then we can go ahead and put in a some

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.170 
then we can go ahead and put in a some
sort<00:05:03.110> of<00:05:03.139> an<00:05:03.290> Iowa<00:05:03.620> eyelid<00:05:04.100> I<00:05:04.310> mean<00:05:04.520> I<00:05:04.550> I<00:05:04.850> brow

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:05.180 
sort of an Iowa eyelid I mean I I brow

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:14.939 
sort of an Iowa eyelid I mean I I brow
here<00:05:06.100> give<00:05:07.100> it<00:05:07.160> a<00:05:07.250> little<00:05:07.400> more<00:05:07.610> of<00:05:08.020> an<00:05:09.020> anchor

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:14.949 

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:24.960 

shade<00:05:15.949> in<00:05:16.130> a<00:05:17.500> bit<00:05:18.500> more<00:05:18.740> of<00:05:18.830> this

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:24.970 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:27.090 

of<00:05:25.270> course<00:05:25.540> this<00:05:25.990> curves<00:05:26.290> around<00:05:26.380> -<00:05:26.740> so<00:05:26.950> this

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:27.100 
of course this curves around - so this

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:29.430 
of course this curves around - so this
would<00:05:27.280> be<00:05:27.400> like<00:05:27.580> dark<00:05:28.330> and<00:05:28.660> shadow<00:05:28.930> here<00:05:29.230> this

would be like dark and shadow here this

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.860 
would be like dark and shadow here this
here<00:05:29.830> would<00:05:30.010> be<00:05:30.420> let's<00:05:31.420> get<00:05:31.570> some<00:05:31.750> more

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:31.870 
here would be let's get some more

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:36.330 
here would be let's get some more

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:39.250 
waiting for the lad to break just as I

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:43.290 
waiting for the lad to break just as I
am<00:05:41.070> get<00:05:42.070> that<00:05:42.250> in<00:05:42.430> there<00:05:42.580> nice<00:05:42.760> this<00:05:43.030> sort<00:05:43.240> of

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:43.300

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:45.030 
am get that in there nice this sort of
defines<00:05:43.690> the<00:05:43.870> bridge<00:05:44.050> of<00:05:44.200> the<00:05:44.260> nose<00:05:44.290> here

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:45.040 
defines the bridge of the nose here

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:50.610 
defines the bridge of the nose here
that's<00:05:45.640> where<00:05:45.820> it<00:05:45.910> begins<00:05:49.320> so<00:05:50.320> you<00:05:50.380> can<00:05:50.500> see

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:50.620

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:53.280 
that's where it begins so you can see
that<00:05:50.740> reflection<00:05:51.070> really<00:05:51.430> sort<00:05:51.640> of<00:05:52.200> gives<00:05:53.200> it

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:53.290 
that reflection really sort of gives it

00:05:53.290 --> 00:06:02.950 
that reflection really sort of gives it
a<00:05:53.350> bit<00:05:53.470> of<00:05:53.530> a<00:05:53.680> pop<00:05:53.920> there

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:02.960 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.720 

so<00:06:03.960> let's<00:06:04.920> see<00:06:05.100> if<00:06:05.160> we<00:06:05.250> can<00:06:05.370> get<00:06:05.460> that<00:06:05.610> a<00:06:05.640> little

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:05.730 
so let's see if we can get that a little

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:07.100 
so let's see if we can get that a little
bit<00:06:05.910> more<00:06:06.120> messed<00:06:06.450> that<00:06:06.570> up<00:06:06.630> a<00:06:06.810> little<00:06:06.900> bit

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:07.110 
bit more messed that up a little bit

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:11.750 
bit more messed that up a little bit
more<00:06:09.500> even<00:06:10.500> dark<00:06:10.710> not<00:06:10.890> even<00:06:11.220> more<00:06:11.400> let's<00:06:11.550> give

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:11.760 
more even dark not even more let's give

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.140 
more even dark not even more let's give
this<00:06:11.880> some<00:06:12.090> serious<00:06:12.120> light<00:06:12.690> going<00:06:12.930> on<00:06:13.080> here

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:14.150 
this some serious light going on here

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:23.350 
this some serious light going on here
even<00:06:15.150> darkness
