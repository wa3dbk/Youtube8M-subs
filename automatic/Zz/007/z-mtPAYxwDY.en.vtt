00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 hi girls how are you welcome to 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.799
 my york channel that disappeared a few days 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.900
 to enjoy these dates 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.150
 and share with my family because 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.179
 I'm back but this video is not 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.520
 mainly from a raffle thanks to 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.109
 ron wear but I said since I'm going to talk 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.970
 of roamware because they showed us more 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.740
 tidbits from this store I just got 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:27.510
 get there then I'll share them 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:29.189
 here they remember the dress that I 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.349
 It has been big that I was big 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.020
 What I showed you is from another store 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:38.040
 I ordered it in jest because I found it in 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:41.399
 extras suffer as much holes being skinny 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:44.430
 true but this dress is beautiful 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.590
 I loved it is extra size small I have left 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:50.010
 a little product of the waist but 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:53.610
 this does fix pretty well because 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:56.880
 to see here his belt is clear then 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.890
 already with his belt put there because 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.380
 it can accommodate what I liked was 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.590
 this cut that he has here in the back 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:06.750
 I loved it, I loved the other one, 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:09.360
 I gave to one of my sisters who has already 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.080
 it was perfect it was beautiful and 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.120
 more than anything to see the opposite of 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:18.630
 getting dressed really liked me more and 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:20.880
 that's why I reordered things 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.820
 for this other dress is the one that uses 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.220
 for Christmas so if you look at it cochino 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.220
 If you're dirty, it's because 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.800
 you for 24 the 24 for the eve 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.920
 Christmas so I take it out he shared 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.960
 a photo on instagram that I was going to 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.960
 put on a loose dress so they knew 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:44.369
 all the tamales and I really loved it 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:47.920
 the stamping and it's hot then so 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:50.020
 warm because it shelters a little more 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:54.040
 of this small town here and on the part of 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.689
 down still has a liner and I think 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.270
 which is so that the fabric does not sting but 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:02:02.439
 as they want to tÃ©lam and it did not sting me 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:05.350
 he liked it a lot so it's super coquettish but 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:07.180
 the same time loose to me not much 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.920
 they like the sites so they come carved 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.140
 because first I do not feel that I suffocate 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.239
 and second place because it's not much 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.270
 style does not go much with my style like that 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:17.150
 is 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:20.090
 and how not another one to order and 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.970
 Truth is that it is economical 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:27.140
 like when you want to wear jeans and 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:30.410
 boots nothing else how is the orbit something 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.990
 as a little guy but it's just 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.670
 where you have to cover in the leggins 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.620
 because he sees that the laws are not 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:40.040
 pants but it's the same already the charge 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:42.470
 partner for using many of the things 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:46.310
 good everything to say it well everything I already 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:48.620
 use and it is so pretty simple no 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.810
 it's like the great thing but a 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.300
 basic blouse with that ass for 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:57.200
 feel comfortable and not see everything 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:03:01.730
 of the piece and something else 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:04.580
 is this skirt and this outfit is no longer 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:07.550
 use and I will upload the photos in 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:11.230
 the blog of this outfit use it like this 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:16.370
 together is this skirt that if you can see it 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:19.250
 It's leather on the bottom and 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:22.340
 It has a lining but what I love about 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:25.280
 that skirt is that it has the black background 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:30.340
 then it does so as more autumnal and the 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:33.019
 colors is mustard green red violet 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.060
 purple or are those colors that are 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:39.560
 stand out in the autumn really I 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:40.940
 fascinated this color is for telling me 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.860
 I love all the progres and masters 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:46.430
 all colors but by telling you this 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:50.319
 color is my favorite colors in 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:54.489
 this season has here like 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:57.730
 to this texture is quite warm 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:04:00.040
 pretty warm and long I loved it 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:03.609
 and I also wanted to put it that way with 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:07.450
 leggings and high boots the sweater itself 

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:09.250
 It's all I did not like and that's good 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:12.700
 I am now if I am going to talk to you about 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:14.650
