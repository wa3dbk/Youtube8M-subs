00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.340

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:44.380
 he like his mother were happy 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.380
 with the idea of reaching this place 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.000
 a lot of happiness a lot of emotion that 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.710
 bastian reaches these achievements with so many 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.129
 limitations that all elite still 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.780
 since it deserves now bastian is 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.190
 next to step on stage more 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.250
 important of our country 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:13.130
 Viña del Mar expects the participation of 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:16.100
 Former Roman Coliseum for Wednesday 27 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.590
 February and less than two weeks before 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.450
 day in question this is part of the 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.600
 routine with which to visit different 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:26.840
 events throughout our country 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:29.080
 factory that your grandfather told you before 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.080
 die 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:36.900
 who the boxer looks like 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.900
 comfort that you can see comfort 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:44.700
 and what the tree's healing looks like 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:46.740
 easter not a pretty uploaded booklet of 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.780
 tone with a vocabulary that rosell what 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.460
 vulgar remind us of the words of 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.619
 humorist arturo ruiz tagle who 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.689
 He stated from the beginning that they were 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.600
 did not meet the conditions for 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.890
 participate in the viñamarino contest 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.709
 I think that vineyard festival has to think 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.090
 in the audience and then the journalists 

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:06.539
 they say that there is not a model here 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.670
 smart in this country to go and 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:10.410
 intelligent humor what happens that the 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.510
 festival line does not show one 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.030
 representative of what happens in the smoke 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.069
 related is ashamed to say that a 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.450
 Chilean humorist with the quality of 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:21.390
 comedians who have for special of 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.459
 she while arturo followed in a tailspin 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.380
 against the nascent humorist would have 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.989
 other colleagues who lent him all his 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.579
 I support the quilicura native and 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:32.290
 we are very happy 

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:34.719
 we are very happy is like 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.730
 team like canal sebastián go 

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:39.790
 vineyard festival because an achievement of 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.890
 all of us the first program of 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.959
 the first time we saw it a 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.239
 angel very special good bastian was a 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:47.500
 social phenomenon from before and we 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:49.900
 with a Roman coliseum what we did was 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.599
 massify order a little bit what 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:55.420
 we advised had some start 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:56.890
 preventions but has shown in 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.870
 great scenarios has proven in 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.340
 said since this year and where they have 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.319
 presented that people love him very much 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.959
 is the team's biggest success work that 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:06.760
 is with him is doing quite 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:08.889
 merit so that people in the day that 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.720
 he acts act bastian have a good time 

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:12.609
 and entertain after the 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.159
 presentation of the 26 year old humorist 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:17.079
 who became famous on youtube and who already 

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:19.030
 I would have had rehearsals with Rafael 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:21.760
 araneda we went in search of the 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.950
 cheerleaders of the event and this was their 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.720
 reaction is frank and you thought the routine 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.849
 de bastian to be new the deputy 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.560
 michetti is changing clothes a 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:32.280
 pretty risque routine could be 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.280
 present for yourself 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:39.500
 it's a bit strong but it 's driven by 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:42.230
 other people and I understand that there 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.810
 much trial had already been tried already with 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:48.830
 the rafa several times and everything so I think 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:51.320
 that bastian away is going to be one of the 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:53.150
 more people effectively produced the 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.920
 time will tell us sebastián managed to leave 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.920
 successful in their participation in the 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:00.140
 Viña del Mar 2013 Festival what yes 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.330
 it is clear that his routine is undoubtedly 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:05.210
 should be revised to avoid 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:07.720
 become one of those devoured by 

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:09.850
 the monster 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.400
 it's even important that we have to 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:16.209
 to clarify is that the routine he did 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:18.190
 sebastián paz is so strong and so little 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:19.540
 reproducible television that we 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.210
 what you reached to see and we have 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.650
 much more than the showing now is what 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.590
 less rude 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:28.240
 the double sense of much level also 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.860
 the amount grava cough is I go back to 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.150
 repeat and reproducible for the 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.580
 television for this schedule and even 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.170
 by night time we want to give a 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.750
 little more information regarding the 

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:40.060
 present less happy because the you 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:42.150
 that is prepared this boy are already 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:44.500
 the librettists want accompanies him 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.700
 because you see that it repeats the 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.440
 same routine even to people 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:49.150
 disillusiona was worried but now 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.830
 I see that he repeats the same thing father is that 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.870
 say that the show that then antón pelarco 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.090
 it is a preview of what you are going to present 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:57.550
 the vineyard festival of the sea and what 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:59.230
 We could see in Pelarco in truth not 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:01.870
 we saw nothing because it 's a pretty show 

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:02.860
 raised tone full of insolence full of 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.080
 rudeness 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:07.419
 who what used to be bastian peace 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:10.180
 in his show is not the first of these 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:13.150
 parts your style and you in another festival 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:15.400
 municipal where leo caprile 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:17.530
 He also blamed it because they are 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:19.630
 stepping further that the times must be 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:22.390
 saying it is not understood many scares 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:22.930
 because he talks to see at once what 

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:24.580
 known 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:26.590
 Of course I do not understand it, you do not think 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:28.840
 high with a speech pathologist is with a 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:31.300
 librettist is with a producer of 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:33.820
 measure that accompanies it everywhere and 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:35.860
 your routine is the only one that is going to be 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:37.330
 reviewed and supervise with the 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.580
 organization of the vineyard festival 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:42.550
 sea ​​because a show like the one that presented 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:44.650
 In Pelarco you can not broadcast to see 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:46.120
 attention to the organization of the 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:48.010
 life festival we have a preview of 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:50.410
 what you have to do now 

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:51.970
 in a few more weeks see the following 

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:54.010
 routine is ultra edited I go back to 

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:55.240
 repeat because it is irreproducible but 

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:57.040
 only material but not even 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:59.520
 for the schedule and although we show them the 

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.520
 morning 

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:08.539
 what is the shampoo 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:15.910
 here it looks like the priest to the tree of 

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.910
 Easter 

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:23.420
 you fill me with a mine 

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:34.080
 Marin that your grandfather told you before 

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:37.650
 die affirms mezcal in the itching sound 

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:39.810
 lemon and application I'll say 

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:43.470
 what is the poorest birthday the one 

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:46.700
 tired because there is a meat so 

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:46.700
 balloon and these assholes 

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:51.890
 I told him nominated a whistle
