so I just want to make a quick video of

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:03.710 
so I just want to make a quick video of
a<00:00:02.490> little<00:00:02.520> project<00:00:02.790> I've<00:00:03.179> done<00:00:03.389> which<00:00:03.540> is

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
a little project I've done which is

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.840 
a little project I've done which is
taking<00:00:04.049> these<00:00:04.170> cheaper<00:00:04.710> ebay<00:00:05.609> brushless

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
taking these cheaper ebay brushless

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.220 
taking these cheaper ebay brushless
gimbal<00:00:06.060> is<00:00:06.420> where<00:00:06.509> I<00:00:06.569> call<00:00:06.720> me<00:00:06.930> baby<00:00:07.140> but

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
gimbal is where I call me baby but

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.640 
gimbal is where I call me baby but
they're<00:00:07.410> just<00:00:07.770> Chinese<00:00:08.069> brushless<00:00:08.460> Kimball's

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:09.650 
they're just Chinese brushless Kimball's

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.770 
they're just Chinese brushless Kimball's
which<00:00:10.650> I<00:00:10.830> bought<00:00:11.490> one<00:00:11.670> year<00:00:12.330> and<00:00:12.450> a<00:00:12.480> half<00:00:12.660> ago

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
which I bought one year and a half ago

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.690 
which I bought one year and a half ago
for<00:00:13.230> the<00:00:13.320> quadcopter<00:00:13.860> which<00:00:14.040> I've<00:00:14.219> used<00:00:14.250> a

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
for the quadcopter which I've used a

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.150 
for the quadcopter which I've used a
fair<00:00:15.360> bit<00:00:15.540> and<00:00:15.719> it<00:00:15.809> works<00:00:15.960> brilliantly<00:00:16.160> but

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
fair bit and it works brilliantly but

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.439 
fair bit and it works brilliantly but
the<00:00:17.279> prices<00:00:17.609> come<00:00:17.730> right<00:00:17.910> down<00:00:18.029> so<00:00:18.300> they're

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
the prices come right down so they're

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.439 
the prices come right down so they're
now<00:00:18.539> about<00:00:18.840> 29<00:00:19.740> pounds<00:00:20.010> delivered<00:00:20.760> which<00:00:21.330> is

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
now about 29 pounds delivered which is

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.450 
now about 29 pounds delivered which is
like<00:00:21.600> 50<00:00:21.930> dollars<00:00:22.230> so<00:00:22.890> I<00:00:22.920> thought<00:00:23.250> I'd<00:00:23.340> get

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
like 50 dollars so I thought I'd get

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.179 
like 50 dollars so I thought I'd get
another<00:00:23.550> one<00:00:23.820> as<00:00:24.420> they<00:00:24.630> come<00:00:24.930> they<00:00:25.590> mounted

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
another one as they come they mounted

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.150 
another one as they come they mounted
the<00:00:26.550> camera<00:00:26.820> sits<00:00:27.300> underneath<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:27.930> frame<00:00:28.160> so

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
the camera sits underneath the frame so

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.780 
the camera sits underneath the frame so
all<00:00:29.460> I<00:00:29.550> did<00:00:29.699> was<00:00:30.060> I've<00:00:30.420> just<00:00:30.779> swapped<00:00:31.170> two<00:00:31.790> just

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
all I did was I've just swapped two just

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.569 
all I did was I've just swapped two just
undone<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.329> bolts<00:00:33.660> on<00:00:33.809> this<00:00:33.960> arm<00:00:34.320> and<00:00:35.160> just

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
undone the bolts on this arm and just

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.299 
undone the bolts on this arm and just
swiveled<00:00:36.090> around<00:00:36.149> forward<00:00:36.690> so<00:00:36.899> now<00:00:37.079> the

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:37.309 
swiveled around forward so now the

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:40.580 
swiveled around forward so now the
camera<00:00:38.309> sticks<00:00:38.550> out<00:00:38.700> in<00:00:38.879> front<00:00:39.140> so<00:00:40.140> this<00:00:40.350> means

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
camera sticks out in front so this means

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.290 
camera sticks out in front so this means
that<00:00:41.040> when<00:00:41.820> you<00:00:42.379> tilt<00:00:43.379> up<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:44.370> down<00:00:44.520> you<00:00:45.180> don't

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
that when you tilt up and down you don't

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.979 
that when you tilt up and down you don't
get<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.750> frame<00:00:46.110> in<00:00:46.320> in<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:47.250> top<00:00:47.550> of<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.760> shot

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
get the frame in in the top of the shot

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:50.690 
get the frame in in the top of the shot
so<00:00:48.989> then<00:00:49.230> it<00:00:50.100> comes

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
so then it comes

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.069 
so then it comes
I<00:00:50.789> mean<00:00:50.940> it's<00:00:51.059> advertised<00:00:51.390> as<00:00:51.480> a<00:00:51.570> gopro<00:00:51.899> gimbal

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
I mean it's advertised as a gopro gimbal

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.330 
I mean it's advertised as a gopro gimbal
but<00:00:52.649> obviously<00:00:53.010> we're<00:00:53.219> now<00:00:53.370> we've<00:00:54.030> got<00:00:54.210> these

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.340 
but obviously we're now we've got these

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.430 
but obviously we're now we've got these
sj4000<00:00:56.340> and<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:57.109> cme

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
sj4000 and the cme

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.450 
sj4000 and the cme
which<00:00:59.129> are<00:00:59.430> these<00:00:59.940> cheap<00:01:00.750> GoPro<00:01:01.410> plans<00:01:01.710> which

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
which are these cheap GoPro plans which

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.039 
which are these cheap GoPro plans which
a<00:01:02.579> lot<00:01:02.699> of<00:01:02.730> people<00:01:02.850> using<00:01:03.149> so<00:01:03.480> I<00:01:03.510> wanted<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:03.809> try

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
a lot of people using so I wanted to try

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.750 
a lot of people using so I wanted to try
if<00:01:04.110> they<00:01:04.260> would<00:01:04.379> work<00:01:04.500> with<00:01:04.559> that<00:01:04.890> now<00:01:05.549> that

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
if they would work with that now that

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.570 
if they would work with that now that
the<00:01:06.090> GoPro<00:01:06.810> fits<00:01:07.409> straight<00:01:07.830> into<00:01:08.159> this<00:01:08.310> um

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
the GoPro fits straight into this um

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.530 
the GoPro fits straight into this um
velcro<00:01:09.119> mount<00:01:09.409> real<00:01:10.409> easily<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.970> strap

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
velcro mount real easily and the strap

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.740 
velcro mount real easily and the strap
actually<00:01:13.020> fits<00:01:13.350> in<00:01:14.280> front<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:14.850> behind<00:01:15.240> it<00:01:15.630> I

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
actually fits in front and behind it I

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.120 
actually fits in front and behind it I
think<00:01:15.990> you<00:01:16.049> can<00:01:16.170> just<00:01:16.320> about<00:01:16.409> see<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.860> slot

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
think you can just about see the slot

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.030 
think you can just about see the slot
there<00:01:17.659> so<00:01:18.659> and<00:01:18.960> obviously<00:01:19.350> works<00:01:19.710> perfectly

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
there so and obviously works perfectly

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.630 
there so and obviously works perfectly
with<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.250> GoPro<00:01:20.659> what<00:01:21.659> I<00:01:21.689> found<00:01:21.900> with<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.640> Yi

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
with the GoPro what I found with the Yi

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.810 
with the GoPro what I found with the Yi
is<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.570> lens<00:01:24.810> is<00:01:25.110> slightly<00:01:25.680> thicker<00:01:26.250> than<00:01:26.640> the

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
is the lens is slightly thicker than the

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.080 
is the lens is slightly thicker than the
GoPro<00:01:27.360> lens<00:01:27.600> just<00:01:27.900> by<00:01:28.680> half<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:29.579> millimeter<00:01:29.939> or

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
GoPro lens just by half a millimeter or

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.289 
GoPro lens just by half a millimeter or
so<00:01:30.299> so<00:01:30.840> I<00:01:31.110> just<00:01:31.200> had<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:31.619> just<00:01:32.579> enlarge<00:01:32.970> this

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
so so I just had to just enlarge this

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.289 
so so I just had to just enlarge this
hole<00:01:33.360> in<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.900> in<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.530> carbon<00:01:34.950> PlayBook<00:01:35.490> g10

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
hole in the in the carbon PlayBook g10

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.660 
hole in the in the carbon PlayBook g10
plate<00:01:36.540> just<00:01:37.500> to<00:01:37.650> get<00:01:37.770> that<00:01:37.920> in<00:01:38.040> and<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.549> other

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
plate just to get that in and the other

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.780 
plate just to get that in and the other
thing<00:01:38.880> I<00:01:38.970> found<00:01:39.180> is<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:40.350> cameras

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
thing I found is the the cameras

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.630 
thing I found is the the cameras
slightly<00:01:41.790> wider<00:01:42.710> and<00:01:43.710> I<00:01:43.890> think<00:01:44.130> more<00:01:44.310> because

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
slightly wider and I think more because

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.490 
slightly wider and I think more because
the<00:01:44.820> lens<00:01:45.119> is<00:01:45.479> a<00:01:46.729> different<00:01:47.729> shape<00:01:48.030> you<00:01:48.990> have

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
the lens is a different shape you have

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.270 
the lens is a different shape you have
to<00:01:49.619> unload<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.549> strap<00:01:50.820> from<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.299> back<00:01:51.479> slot

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
to unload the strap from the back slot

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.130 
to unload the strap from the back slot
to<00:01:53.280> get<00:01:53.430> this<00:01:53.640> to<00:01:53.909> sit<00:01:54.329> down<00:01:54.450> tightly<00:01:54.840> if<00:01:55.020> the

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
to get this to sit down tightly if the

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.959 
to get this to sit down tightly if the
camera<00:01:55.470> isn't<00:01:55.619> snug<00:01:56.130> on<00:01:56.310> that<00:01:56.490> camera<00:01:56.759> boy<00:01:56.909> if

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
camera isn't snug on that camera boy if

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.179 
camera isn't snug on that camera boy if
there's<00:01:57.119> any<00:01:57.299> player<00:01:57.600> tool<00:01:57.930> then<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.860> gimbal

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
there's any player tool then the gimbal

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.679 
there's any player tool then the gimbal
will<00:01:59.369> vibrate<00:01:59.579> and<00:02:00.030> you'll<00:02:00.210> get<00:02:00.299> a<00:02:00.360> buzzing

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
will vibrate and you'll get a buzzing

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.170 
will vibrate and you'll get a buzzing
noise<00:02:00.719> so<00:02:01.469> that<00:02:02.009> it's<00:02:02.219> not<00:02:02.340> a<00:02:02.399> fault<00:02:02.909> with<00:02:03.090> the

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
noise so that it's not a fault with the

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.940 
noise so that it's not a fault with the
gimbal<00:02:03.479> it's<00:02:03.719> just<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.140> mounting<00:02:04.530> needs<00:02:04.799> to

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
gimbal it's just the mounting needs to

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.340 
gimbal it's just the mounting needs to
be<00:02:05.009> really<00:02:05.399> snug<00:02:05.670> so<00:02:06.659> yeah<00:02:06.840> so<00:02:06.990> if<00:02:07.079> I<00:02:07.170> just

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
be really snug so yeah so if I just

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.889 
be really snug so yeah so if I just
mount<00:02:07.560> this<00:02:07.680> up<00:02:07.890> now<00:02:08.160> and<00:02:08.520> you<00:02:09.270> really<00:02:09.660> have<00:02:09.780> to

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
mount this up now and you really have to

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.390 
mount this up now and you really have to
get<00:02:09.959> it<00:02:10.080> firmly<00:02:10.410> down<00:02:10.709> on

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
get it firmly down on

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.000 
get it firmly down on
strap<00:02:11.700> so<00:02:12.090> it's<00:02:12.720> really<00:02:12.930> important<00:02:13.620> to<00:02:13.799> give

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
strap so it's really important to give

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.220 
strap so it's really important to give
it<00:02:14.099> some<00:02:14.310> good<00:02:14.459> tension<00:02:17.569> there<00:02:18.569> again<00:02:18.870> and

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
it some good tension there again and

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:20.929 
it some good tension there again and
what<00:02:19.349> you<00:02:19.470> need<00:02:19.620> is<00:02:19.829> their<00:02:20.069> camera<00:02:20.370> to<00:02:20.489> be<00:02:20.610> snug

00:02:20.929 --> 00:02:20.939 
what you need is their camera to be snug

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:23.330 
what you need is their camera to be snug
on<00:02:21.120> the<00:02:21.239> strap<00:02:21.480> so<00:02:21.750> it<00:02:22.290> can't<00:02:22.500> move<00:02:22.680> around<00:02:22.980> and

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
on the strap so it can't move around and

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.039 
on the strap so it can't move around and
then<00:02:23.730> secondly<00:02:24.209> you<00:02:24.299> need<00:02:24.569> to<00:02:24.629> just<00:02:24.840> make<00:02:25.019> sure

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:25.049 
then secondly you need to just make sure

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:28.309 
then secondly you need to just make sure
balances<00:02:25.769> so<00:02:26.489> if<00:02:27.299> you<00:02:27.569> just<00:02:27.750> slide<00:02:27.989> it<00:02:28.170> up<00:02:28.290> and

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
balances so if you just slide it up and

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.460 
balances so if you just slide it up and
down<00:02:28.530> the<00:02:28.680> camera<00:02:28.980> bar<00:02:29.959> so<00:02:30.959> that<00:02:31.109> roughly

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
down the camera bar so that roughly

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.429 
down the camera bar so that roughly
balances<00:02:32.069> that's<00:02:32.579> fine<00:02:33.079> so<00:02:34.079> I<00:02:34.140> decide<00:02:34.409> I'm

00:02:34.429 --> 00:02:34.439 
balances that's fine so I decide I'm

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:36.949 
balances that's fine so I decide I'm
talking<00:02:34.859> about<00:02:35.390> nothing<00:02:36.390> I've<00:02:36.569> done<00:02:36.599> which

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
talking about nothing I've done which

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.860 
talking about nothing I've done which
you<00:02:36.989> don't<00:02:37.230> have<00:02:37.379> to<00:02:37.590> is<00:02:37.859> the<00:02:38.579> when<00:02:39.239> this<00:02:39.450> came

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
you don't have to is the when this came

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.930 
you don't have to is the when this came
the<00:02:40.650> sensor<00:02:41.310> was<00:02:41.609> mounted<00:02:42.180> on<00:02:42.390> the<00:02:43.340> hinge<00:02:44.340> what

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
the sensor was mounted on the hinge what

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.330 
the sensor was mounted on the hinge what
I<00:02:45.000> call<00:02:45.209> the<00:02:45.329> hinge<00:02:45.510> side<00:02:45.829> Marv<00:02:46.829> that<00:02:46.950> meant<00:02:47.190> is

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
I call the hinge side Marv that meant is

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.280 
I call the hinge side Marv that meant is
when<00:02:47.549> the<00:02:47.700> cable<00:02:48.060> was<00:02:48.120> plugged<00:02:48.420> in<00:02:48.599> it<00:02:49.139> would

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
when the cable was plugged in it would

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.160 
when the cable was plugged in it would
foul<00:02:49.920> on<00:02:50.190> this<00:02:50.370> bar<00:02:50.609> so<00:02:51.060> you<00:02:51.090> could<00:02:51.389> only<00:02:51.510> you

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
foul on this bar so you could only you

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.020 
foul on this bar so you could only you
if<00:02:52.440> you're<00:02:52.560> having<00:02:52.769> the<00:02:52.950> camera<00:02:53.250> flat<00:02:53.489> it's<00:02:53.909> no

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
if you're having the camera flat it's no

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.490 
if you're having the camera flat it's no
problem<00:02:54.239> at<00:02:54.359> all<00:02:54.510> but<00:02:54.989> if<00:02:55.079> you<00:02:55.139> want<00:02:55.260> to<00:02:55.319> tilt

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
problem at all but if you want to tilt

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.410 
problem at all but if you want to tilt
it<00:02:55.620> down<00:02:55.650> you<00:02:56.040> could<00:02:56.159> only<00:02:56.280> tilter<00:02:56.670> about<00:02:56.939> 45

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
it down you could only tilter about 45

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.809 
it down you could only tilter about 45
degrees<00:02:57.750> before<00:02:57.989> we<00:02:58.230> hit<00:02:58.709> so<00:02:59.489> to<00:02:59.549> get<00:02:59.760> around

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
degrees before we hit so to get around

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:01.550 
degrees before we hit so to get around
that<00:03:00.269> I've<00:03:00.480> just<00:03:00.750> extended<00:03:01.290> the<00:03:01.379> wire

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
that I've just extended the wire

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.679 
that I've just extended the wire
slightly<00:03:02.040> and<00:03:02.189> mounted<00:03:02.579> the<00:03:02.760> sensor<00:03:03.420> on<00:03:03.629> the

00:03:03.679 --> 00:03:03.689 
slightly and mounted the sensor on the

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:06.830 
slightly and mounted the sensor on the
opposite<00:03:04.680> side<00:03:04.950> of<00:03:04.980> the<00:03:05.220> bar<00:03:05.430> and<00:03:05.700> then<00:03:06.629> that

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
opposite side of the bar and then that

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.869 
opposite side of the bar and then that
can<00:03:07.049> tilt<00:03:07.290> all<00:03:07.500> the<00:03:07.620> way<00:03:07.709> down<00:03:07.920> and<00:03:08.129> then<00:03:08.760> the

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:08.879 
can tilt all the way down and then the

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:10.009 
can tilt all the way down and then the
other<00:03:09.000> thing<00:03:09.239> I've<00:03:09.359> done<00:03:09.569> I<00:03:09.599> thought<00:03:09.810> I've

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:17.099 
got a thread here so you can attach a

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:18.680 
got a thread here so you can attach a
handle<00:03:17.250> to<00:03:17.579> it<00:03:17.609> I've<00:03:17.819> got<00:03:17.940> a<00:03:17.970> short<00:03:18.359> handle<00:03:18.629> on

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
handle to it I've got a short handle on

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.710 
handle to it I've got a short handle on
a<00:03:18.750> long<00:03:18.930> handle<00:03:19.310> I've<00:03:20.310> also<00:03:20.489> put<00:03:20.819> just<00:03:21.239> part<00:03:21.690> of

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
a long handle I've also put just part of

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.150 
a long handle I've also put just part of
power<00:03:21.930> switching<00:03:22.319> just<00:03:22.500> for<00:03:22.620> neatness<00:03:22.769> so<00:03:23.099> you

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
power switching just for neatness so you

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.470 
power switching just for neatness so you
don't<00:03:23.340> have<00:03:23.459> to<00:03:23.609> plug<00:03:23.760> the<00:03:23.940> battery<00:03:24.030> now<00:03:24.329> now

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
don't have to plug the battery now now

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.839 
don't have to plug the battery now now
the<00:03:24.989> battery<00:03:25.290> is<00:03:25.349> a<00:03:25.410> little<00:03:25.470> 3s<00:03:25.949> a<00:03:26.069> 50<00:03:26.519> milliamp

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:26.849 
the battery is a little 3s a 50 milliamp

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:28.879 
the battery is a little 3s a 50 milliamp
lipo<00:03:27.299> that<00:03:27.510> sits<00:03:27.959> in<00:03:28.109> there<00:03:28.290> very<00:03:28.440> neatly<00:03:28.650> and

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:28.889 
lipo that sits in there very neatly and

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:31.460 
lipo that sits in there very neatly and
then<00:03:29.609> lastly<00:03:29.879> I've<00:03:30.030> added<00:03:30.150> a<00:03:30.299> servo<00:03:30.780> tester

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
then lastly I've added a servo tester

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.809 
then lastly I've added a servo tester
and<00:03:31.859> that<00:03:32.370> is<00:03:32.579> so<00:03:32.849> I<00:03:33.150> can<00:03:33.569> if<00:03:33.989> I<00:03:34.109> fire<00:03:34.349> this<00:03:34.470> up

00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:34.819 
and that is so I can if I fire this up

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:41.559 
and that is so I can if I fire this up
until<00:03:35.819> the<00:03:35.940> camera<00:03:37.190> so<00:03:38.190> I<00:03:38.280> just<00:03:38.459> turn<00:03:38.639> this<00:03:38.760> on

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:41.569 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:44.990 

it<00:03:42.569> initializes<00:03:43.109> now<00:03:43.889> that<00:03:44.069> that<00:03:44.310> dial<00:03:44.729> I've

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
it initializes now that that dial I've

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.180 
it initializes now that that dial I've
got<00:03:45.269> here<00:03:45.569> will<00:03:46.139> adjust<00:03:46.409> the<00:03:46.590> angle<00:03:47.010> of<00:03:47.099> the

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
got here will adjust the angle of the

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.589 
got here will adjust the angle of the
camera<00:03:47.370> so<00:03:48.180> I<00:03:48.209> can<00:03:48.419> point<00:03:48.599> it<00:03:48.889> down<00:03:49.889> or<00:03:50.329> flat<00:03:51.329> or

00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:51.599 
camera so I can point it down or flat or

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:53.960 
camera so I can point it down or flat or
absolutely<00:03:52.530> now<00:03:53.040> obviously<00:03:53.159> normally<00:03:53.790> you're

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
absolutely now obviously normally you're

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.770 
absolutely now obviously normally you're
going<00:03:54.000> to<00:03:54.180> point<00:03:54.389> it<00:03:54.569> flat<00:03:55.280> so<00:03:56.510> but<00:03:57.510> it<00:03:57.599> means

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
going to point it flat so but it means

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.390 
going to point it flat so but it means
that<00:03:57.959> if<00:03:58.079> you<00:03:58.109> want<00:03:58.379> to<00:03:58.470> do<00:03:58.590> a<00:03:58.620> tilt<00:03:58.889> shot<00:03:59.159> you

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
that if you want to do a tilt shot you

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.129 
that if you want to do a tilt shot you
can<00:03:59.579> just<00:03:59.729> do<00:03:59.879> it<00:03:59.909> easily<00:04:00.209> while<00:04:00.599> while<00:04:01.019> it's

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:01.139 
can just do it easily while while it's

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:03.199 
can just do it easily while while it's
on<00:04:01.260> the<00:04:01.290> gimbal<00:04:01.650> so<00:04:02.400> yeah<00:04:02.519> so<00:04:02.669> that<00:04:02.790> shows<00:04:03.030> that

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
on the gimbal so yeah so that shows that

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:06.409 
on the gimbal so yeah so that shows that
it's<00:04:03.359> working<00:04:04.519> so<00:04:05.519> yes<00:04:05.879> so<00:04:06.000> that<00:04:06.120> works<00:04:06.269> fine

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:06.419 
it's working so yes so that works fine

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:07.280 
it's working so yes so that works fine
with<00:04:06.569> a<00:04:06.659> Zowie

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
with a Zowie

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.289 
with a Zowie
you<00:04:07.500> can<00:04:07.650> also<00:04:07.769> use<00:04:07.979> the<00:04:08.099> Wi-Fi<00:04:08.280> on<00:04:08.579> the<00:04:08.790> yi<00:04:09.060> so

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:09.299 
you can also use the Wi-Fi on the yi so

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:10.699 
you can also use the Wi-Fi on the yi so
you<00:04:09.359> can<00:04:09.569> see<00:04:09.840> what<00:04:10.049> you're<00:04:10.169> recording<00:04:10.409> with<00:04:10.680> a

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
you can see what you're recording with a

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:13.039 
you can see what you're recording with a
little<00:04:10.889> bit<00:04:10.979> of<00:04:11.069> lag<00:04:11.250> and<00:04:12.150> I<00:04:12.479> just<00:04:12.840> turn<00:04:13.019> that

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049 
little bit of lag and I just turn that

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:14.680 
little bit of lag and I just turn that
off

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
off

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.750 
off
you<00:04:15.690> can<00:04:15.840> also<00:04:15.990> mount<00:04:16.380> up<00:04:16.680> the<00:04:16.830> estate<00:04:17.370> board

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
you can also mount up the estate board

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.490 
you can also mount up the estate board
which<00:04:18.720> has<00:04:19.880> a<00:04:20.880> slightly<00:04:21.180> smaller<00:04:21.600> lens<00:04:22.020> than

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
which has a slightly smaller lens than

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.740 
which has a slightly smaller lens than
the<00:04:22.770> GoPro<00:04:23.310> so<00:04:23.790> you<00:04:23.880> don't<00:04:24.060> have<00:04:24.270> to<00:04:24.450> adjust

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
the GoPro so you don't have to adjust

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.050 
the GoPro so you don't have to adjust
the<00:04:24.960> mount<00:04:25.140> strap<00:04:25.710> for<00:04:25.860> that<00:04:26.040> but<00:04:26.820> it<00:04:26.940> is

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
the mount strap for that but it is

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.020 
the mount strap for that but it is
slightly<00:04:27.390> deeper<00:04:27.780> so<00:04:28.320> you<00:04:28.380> do<00:04:28.680> have<00:04:28.710> to<00:04:29.030> run

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
slightly deeper so you do have to run

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.300 
slightly deeper so you do have to run
that<00:04:30.210> strap<00:04:30.630> around<00:04:30.810> the<00:04:31.050> outside<00:04:31.920> the<00:04:32.070> slot

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
that strap around the outside the slot

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.000 
that strap around the outside the slot
again<00:04:33.020> but<00:04:34.020> again<00:04:34.110> that's<00:04:34.380> not<00:04:34.530> a<00:04:34.590> difficult

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
again but again that's not a difficult

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:36.590 
again but again that's not a difficult
thing<00:04:35.040> to<00:04:35.190> do<00:04:35.400> again<00:04:36.060> just<00:04:36.240> make<00:04:36.390> sure<00:04:36.420> it's

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 
thing to do again just make sure it's

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.340 
thing to do again just make sure it's
really<00:04:36.660> snugly<00:04:37.620> firm<00:04:38.660> pulled<00:04:39.660> up<00:04:39.810> so<00:04:40.140> that

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:40.350 
really snugly firm pulled up so that

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.160 
really snugly firm pulled up so that
there's<00:04:40.530> no<00:04:40.770> play<00:04:41.160> on<00:04:41.190> the<00:04:41.520> bar<00:04:41.730> and<00:04:42.170> again

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:43.170 
there's no play on the bar and again

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:45.650 
there's no play on the bar and again
just<00:04:43.800> make<00:04:44.340> sure<00:04:44.490> it's<00:04:44.640> balanced<00:04:45.150> by<00:04:45.300> sliding

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
just make sure it's balanced by sliding

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:51.290 
just make sure it's balanced by sliding
the<00:04:45.930> camera<00:04:47.570> on<00:04:48.570> the<00:04:48.750> bar<00:04:48.930> okay<00:04:50.030> so<00:04:51.030> a<00:04:51.060> cat

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 
the camera on the bar okay so a cat

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.120 
the camera on the bar okay so a cat
that's<00:04:51.450> recording<00:04:51.840> now<00:04:51.960> so<00:04:52.710> again<00:04:52.890> if<00:04:53.010> I<00:04:53.100> just

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
that's recording now so again if I just

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.660 
that's recording now so again if I just
turn<00:04:53.340> it<00:04:53.550> on<00:04:53.580> understand<00:04:54.570> ich<00:04:54.660> weiß<00:04:55.490> and<00:04:56.490> there

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:56.670 
turn it on understand ich weiß and there

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:01.910 
turn it on understand ich weiß and there
you<00:04:56.730> go<00:04:56.880> so<00:04:57.150> that's<00:04:57.240> now<00:05:00.860> stabilizing<00:05:01.860> the

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:01.920 
you go so that's now stabilizing the

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.580 
you go so that's now stabilizing the
camera<00:05:02.270> so<00:05:03.270> yes<00:05:03.420> so<00:05:03.540> the<00:05:03.630> idea<00:05:03.990> was<00:05:04.170> the<00:05:04.350> reason

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
camera so yes so the idea was the reason

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.800 
camera so yes so the idea was the reason
I<00:05:04.680> did<00:05:04.890> this<00:05:05.100> was<00:05:05.160> so<00:05:05.550> that<00:05:05.730> I<00:05:05.760> could<00:05:06.060> then<00:05:06.090> fit

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
I did this was so that I could then fit

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:10.520 
I did this was so that I could then fit
this<00:05:06.960> to<00:05:07.230> a<00:05:07.430> decorators<00:05:08.430> pol<00:05:08.670> so<00:05:09.300> just<00:05:09.690> this

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530 
this to a decorators pol so just this

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:11.840 
this to a decorators pol so just this
one<00:05:10.650> actually<00:05:10.800> has<00:05:11.160> a<00:05:11.190> little<00:05:11.490> quick<00:05:11.610> release

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:11.850 
one actually has a little quick release

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:17.410 
one actually has a little quick release
and<00:05:14.330> it's<00:05:15.330> going<00:05:15.480> to<00:05:15.630> screw<00:05:15.810> that<00:05:15.960> in<00:05:16.110> there

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:17.420 
and it's going to screw that in there

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:21.910 
and it's going to screw that in there
and<00:05:18.420> then<00:05:18.750> I<00:05:18.780> can<00:05:18.990> just<00:05:19.170> clip<00:05:19.440> this<00:05:19.560> pole<00:05:19.860> on

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:21.920 
and then I can just clip this pole on

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:25.280 
and then I can just clip this pole on
and<00:05:22.920> then<00:05:23.550> I<00:05:23.820> can<00:05:24.150> use<00:05:24.180> this<00:05:24.420> handheld<00:05:24.750> this

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:25.290 
and then I can use this handheld this

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:28.220 
and then I can use this handheld this
extends<00:05:25.800> to<00:05:25.950> a<00:05:25.980> full<00:05:26.760> feet<00:05:26.970> but<00:05:27.540> I<00:05:27.570> also<00:05:27.900> have<00:05:28.200> a

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:28.230 
extends to a full feet but I also have a

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:31.430 
extends to a full feet but I also have a
much<00:05:28.680> longer<00:05:28.890> a<00:05:29.100> 5<00:05:29.340> meter<00:05:29.700> pole<00:05:30.060> which<00:05:30.450> is<00:05:30.660> 15

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 
much longer a 5 meter pole which is 15

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.310 
much longer a 5 meter pole which is 15
feet<00:05:31.710> just<00:05:32.490> over<00:05:32.790> and<00:05:32.970> which<00:05:33.870> have<00:05:34.050> been<00:05:34.080> using

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:34.320 
feet just over and which have been using

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.440 
feet just over and which have been using
outside<00:05:34.590> so<00:05:35.070> where<00:05:35.340> I've<00:05:35.610> got<00:05:36.000> some<00:05:36.180> video<00:05:36.390> of

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:36.450 
outside so where I've got some video of

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:53.540 
outside so where I've got some video of
that<00:05:36.980> how<00:05:37.980> that's<00:05:38.190> useful
