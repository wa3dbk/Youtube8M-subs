00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
question today really of going through

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.030 
question today really of going through
their<00:02:28.970> paces<00:02:29.180> that's<00:02:30.170> trying<00:02:30.500> out<00:02:30.650> one<00:02:30.800> or<00:02:30.920> two

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
their paces that's trying out one or two

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.560 
their paces that's trying out one or two
different<00:02:31.430> things<00:02:31.610> Ali<00:02:31.880> from<00:02:32.150> time<00:02:32.390> to<00:02:32.540> time

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
different things Ali from time to time

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:34.060 
different things Ali from time to time
yeah<00:02:33.230> I<00:02:33.260> think<00:02:33.560> should<00:02:33.680> join<00:02:33.860> that's

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
yeah I think should join that's

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:35.410 
yeah I think should join that's
obviously<00:02:34.430> the<00:02:34.490> whole<00:02:34.670> object<00:02:34.850> and<00:02:35.180> friend

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
obviously the whole object and friend

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:36.820 
obviously the whole object and friend
the<00:02:35.510> game<00:02:35.660> I<00:02:35.870> will<00:02:36.170> give<00:02:36.290> the<00:02:36.410> coaches<00:02:36.800> and

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
the game I will give the coaches and

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.620 
the game I will give the coaches and
indeed<00:02:37.100> the<00:02:37.190> plea<00:02:37.370> of<00:02:37.400> an<00:02:37.580> opportunity<00:02:38.120> but<00:02:38.570> I

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
indeed the plea of an opportunity but I

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.960 
indeed the plea of an opportunity but I
play<00:02:38.960> something<00:02:39.320> doesn't<00:02:39.650> my<00:02:40.190> new<00:02:40.370> formation

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
play something doesn't my new formation

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.850 
play something doesn't my new formation
of<00:02:41.150> even<00:02:41.870> official<00:02:42.200> skill<00:02:42.470> I<00:02:42.530> think<00:02:42.740> that<00:02:42.830> I

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
of even official skill I think that I

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.130 
of even official skill I think that I
don't<00:02:43.010> know<00:02:43.370> one<00:02:43.460> thing<00:02:43.640> i<00:02:43.700> do<00:02:43.760> you<00:02:44.360> think<00:02:44.810> it's

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
don't know one thing i do you think it's

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.170 
don't know one thing i do you think it's
