and<00:03:14.090> that's<00:03:14.269> the<00:03:14.510> steering<00:03:14.959> which<00:03:15.140> is<00:03:15.290> too

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
and that's the steering which is too

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.319 
and that's the steering which is too
damn<00:03:15.799> slow<00:03:16.129> to<00:03:16.190> make<00:03:16.519> the<00:03:16.670> most<00:03:16.849> of<00:03:17.060> such<00:03:17.299> a

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:17.329 
damn slow to make the most of such a

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:19.869 
damn slow to make the most of such a
fine<00:03:17.750> chassis<00:03:18.260> why<00:03:18.950> Honda<00:03:19.340> went<00:03:19.519> with<00:03:19.670> such<00:03:19.849> a

00:03:19.869 --> 00:03:19.879 
fine chassis why Honda went with such a

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:21.640 
fine chassis why Honda went with such a
slow<00:03:20.180> rack<00:03:20.450> back<00:03:20.660> in<00:03:20.810> the<00:03:20.900> day<00:03:21.049> boggles<00:03:21.500> of

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
slow rack back in the day boggles of

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:33.640 
slow rack back in the day boggles of
mind<00:03:21.859> but<00:03:22.549> I'm<00:03:22.700> not<00:03:22.849> a<00:03:22.910> fan

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.740 

now<00:03:34.459> the<00:03:34.519> thing<00:03:34.730> I've<00:03:34.849> noticed<00:03:35.000> about<00:03:35.239> what

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
now the thing I've noticed about what

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.390 
now the thing I've noticed about what
happens<00:03:36.110> when<00:03:36.230> the<00:03:36.349> VTEC<00:03:36.739> kicks<00:03:36.980> in<00:03:37.159> on<00:03:37.250> this

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
happens when the VTEC kicks in on this

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.850 
happens when the VTEC kicks in on this
engine<00:03:37.640> is<00:03:38.480> that<00:03:38.540> it's<00:03:38.810> still<00:03:39.049> really<00:03:39.379> really

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
engine is that it's still really really

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.190 
engine is that it's still really really
linear<00:03:40.250> it<00:03:40.580> doesn't<00:03:40.849> suddenly<00:03:41.030> over<00:03:41.390> hop<00:03:41.959> and

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
linear it doesn't suddenly over hop and

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.750 
linear it doesn't suddenly over hop and
then<00:03:42.260> the<00:03:42.409> whole<00:03:42.590> world<00:03:42.860> goes<00:03:43.099> into<00:03:43.549> warp

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
then the whole world goes into warp

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.380 
then the whole world goes into warp
speed<00:03:44.030> in<00:03:44.209> you<00:03:44.299> like<00:03:44.450> Wow<00:03:44.930> because<00:03:45.620> it<00:03:45.799> can<00:03:45.950> ma

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
speed in you like Wow because it can ma

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:49.360 
speed in you like Wow because it can ma
you<00:03:47.390> don't<00:03:47.510> really<00:03:47.959> notice<00:03:48.170> any<00:03:48.709> increase<00:03:49.340> in

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
you don't really notice any increase in

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:50.920 
you don't really notice any increase in
power<00:03:49.730> it<00:03:50.060> sounds<00:03:50.510> a<00:03:50.540> little<00:03:50.659> bit<00:03:50.870> different

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
power it sounds a little bit different

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.740 
power it sounds a little bit different
sounds<00:03:51.500> a<00:03:51.530> little<00:03:51.650> bit<00:03:51.920> fruitier<00:03:52.340> but<00:03:53.150> um<00:03:53.360> yeah

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
it's not one of those kind of VTEC

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.759 
it's not one of those kind of VTEC
kicked<00:03:55.430> in<00:03:55.579> means<00:03:55.849> yo<00:03:56.120> it's<00:03:56.959> just<00:03:57.290> power<00:03:57.500> all

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:57.769 
kicked in means yo it's just power all

00:03:57.769 --> 00:03:59.559 
kicked in means yo it's just power all
the<00:03:57.920> time<00:03:58.129> it<00:03:58.310> nowadays<00:03:58.849> a<00:03:58.879> low<00:03:59.180> mileage

00:03:59.559 --> 00:03:59.569 
the time it nowadays a low mileage

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:01.089 
the time it nowadays a low mileage
example<00:04:00.079> like<00:04:00.260> this<00:04:00.440> will<00:04:00.650> set<00:04:00.860> you<00:04:00.950> back

00:04:01.089 --> 00:04:01.099 
example like this will set you back

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:03.250 
example like this will set you back
around<00:04:01.250> sixty<00:04:01.790> five<00:04:02.030> thousand<00:04:02.569> pounds<00:04:02.989> which
