there<00:00:33.650> are<00:00:33.800> two<00:00:34.040> edge<00:00:34.220> types<00:00:34.579> available<00:00:34.900> the

there are two edge types available the

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.290 
there are two edge types available the
standard<00:00:36.560> option<00:00:37.010> is<00:00:37.309> the<00:00:37.579> unfinished<00:00:37.970> edge

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 
standard option is the unfinished edge

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.780 
standard option is the unfinished edge
you<00:00:38.570> see<00:00:38.809> here<00:00:39.200> this<00:00:39.530> edge<00:00:39.800> is<00:00:40.040> fine<00:00:40.280> for

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:40.790 
you see here this edge is fine for

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.760 
you see here this edge is fine for
projects<00:00:41.360> where<00:00:41.480> the<00:00:41.840> look<00:00:41.989> at<00:00:42.110> the<00:00:42.200> top<00:00:42.410> isn't

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:42.770 
projects where the look at the top isn't

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:44.979 
projects where the look at the top isn't
important<00:00:43.550> or<00:00:43.730> you're<00:00:44.329> painting<00:00:44.690> it<00:00:44.750> with

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989 
important or you're painting it with

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:49.090 
important or you're painting it with
thick<00:00:45.290> coats<00:00:45.559> of<00:00:45.710> paint<00:00:46.870> the<00:00:47.870> upgraded<00:00:48.680> option

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
thick coats of paint the upgraded option

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.280 
thick coats of paint the upgraded option
is<00:00:49.340> the<00:00:49.699> birch<00:00:49.940> laminated<00:00:50.660> edge<00:00:50.870> which

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:51.290 
is the birch laminated edge which

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:53.410 
is the birch laminated edge which
matches<00:00:51.559> the<00:00:51.769> tabletop<00:00:52.370> exactly<00:00:53.000> and<00:00:53.210> gives

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 
matches the tabletop exactly and gives

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.570 
matches the tabletop exactly and gives
you<00:00:53.540> a<00:00:53.570> nice<00:00:53.809> smooth<00:00:54.320> surface<00:00:54.350> for<00:00:54.920> staining

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:55.580 
you a nice smooth surface for staining

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.970 
you a nice smooth surface for staining
or<00:00:55.760> painting<00:00:56.180> this<00:00:56.780> is<00:00:56.839> the<00:00:57.110> optimal<00:00:57.589> finish

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980 
or painting this is the optimal finish

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.540 
or painting this is the optimal finish
for<00:00:58.370> staining<00:00:58.790> or<00:00:58.910> painting

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.660 

and<00:01:02.420> here<00:01:02.810> we<00:01:02.930> have<00:01:03.050> an<00:01:03.170> example<00:01:03.470> of<00:01:03.830> a<00:01:04.129> painted

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
and here we have an example of a painted

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.630 
and here we have an example of a painted
tabletop<00:01:05.300> so<00:01:05.570> this<00:01:05.720> is<00:01:05.870> one<00:01:06.050> of<00:01:06.080> our<00:01:06.260> tops<00:01:06.640> that

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
tabletop so this is one of our tops that

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.000 
tabletop so this is one of our tops that
was<00:01:07.760> actually<00:01:08.240> painted<00:01:08.780> and<00:01:08.990> as<00:01:09.530> you<00:01:09.680> can<00:01:09.800> see

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.010 
was actually painted and as you can see

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.420 
was actually painted and as you can see
they<00:01:10.190> come<00:01:10.370> out<00:01:10.520> very<00:01:10.850> very<00:01:11.630> nice<00:01:12.220> here's<00:01:13.220> an

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
they come out very very nice here's an

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.510 
they come out very very nice here's an
example<00:01:13.700> of<00:01:13.940> the<00:01:14.090> edge<00:01:14.270> and<00:01:14.840> this<00:01:15.560> edge<00:01:15.620> was

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
example of the edge and this edge was

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.480 
example of the edge and this edge was
unfinished<00:01:17.380> so<00:01:18.380> this<00:01:18.560> was<00:01:18.740> not<00:01:18.950> a<00:01:18.979> finished

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
unfinished so this was not a finished

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.300 
unfinished so this was not a finished
edge<00:01:19.729> and<00:01:20.000> you<00:01:20.060> can<00:01:20.240> see<00:01:20.660> how<00:01:21.080> if<00:01:21.620> you<00:01:22.280> look

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
edge and you can see how if you look

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.460 
edge and you can see how if you look
close<00:01:22.820> enough<00:01:22.850> you<00:01:23.390> can<00:01:23.450> kind<00:01:23.870> of<00:01:23.990> see<00:01:24.290> the

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 
close enough you can kind of see the

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:30.010 
close enough you can kind of see the
layers<00:01:24.740> and<00:01:28.060> so<00:01:29.060> that's<00:01:29.330> kind<00:01:29.660> of<00:01:29.690> where<00:01:29.869> the

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
layers and so that's kind of where the

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.140 
layers and so that's kind of where the
benefit<00:01:30.530> of<00:01:30.560> having<00:01:30.800> a<00:01:31.070> finished<00:01:31.490> edge<00:01:31.729> comes

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.150 
benefit of having a finished edge comes

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:33.820 
benefit of having a finished edge comes
in<00:01:32.360> is<00:01:32.570> that<00:01:32.600> you<00:01:32.780> won't<00:01:33.140> see<00:01:33.350> those<00:01:33.530> layers

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830 
in is that you won't see those layers

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:35.910 
in is that you won't see those layers
but<00:01:34.190> if<00:01:34.550> you're<00:01:34.790> using<00:01:34.970> thick<00:01:35.300> enough<00:01:35.509> paint

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
but if you're using thick enough paint

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.160 
but if you're using thick enough paint
like<00:01:36.920> this<00:01:37.160> top<00:01:37.729> was<00:01:37.940> painted<00:01:38.270> with<00:01:38.390> it<00:01:38.930> may

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
like this top was painted with it may

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.020 
like this top was painted with it may
not<00:01:39.320> really<00:01:39.649> matter<00:01:39.890> but<00:01:40.250> and<00:01:40.580> here<00:01:40.790> is<00:01:40.880> an

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
not really matter but and here is an

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.359 
not really matter but and here is an
example<00:01:41.300> of<00:01:41.540> another<00:01:41.630> tabletop<00:01:42.350> of<00:01:42.770> ours<00:01:43.070> that

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
example of another tabletop of ours that

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:46.780 
example of another tabletop of ours that
was<00:01:43.520> painted<00:01:44.860> so<00:01:45.860> again<00:01:46.190> it<00:01:46.369> really<00:01:46.460> kind<00:01:46.759> of

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
was painted so again it really kind of

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:48.670 
was painted so again it really kind of
gives<00:01:46.970> you<00:01:47.090> a<00:01:47.119> sense<00:01:47.450> for<00:01:47.780> the<00:01:48.020> possibilities

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 
gives you a sense for the possibilities

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.460 
gives you a sense for the possibilities
whether<00:01:49.520> you're<00:01:49.700> looking<00:01:49.880> to<00:01:50.170> make<00:01:51.170> over<00:01:51.440> a
