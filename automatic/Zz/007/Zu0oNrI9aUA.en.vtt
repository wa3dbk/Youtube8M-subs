00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 how am i nicolÃ¡s film and the super 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:08.099
 pixel and today we are going to do the analysis of 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:09.719
 the ip camera x view over watch let's say 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.130
 that we have physically good in everything 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.250
 which are the sides we are going to tell 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.750
 with nothing but metal is 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:18.449
 impressively sun and it's a block 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.250
 unique because this a single block of 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.080
 metal that if they come to steal and they have 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.670
 desire to take actions totally 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.140
 aggressive and violent can grab the 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.900
 camera with your hand to hit a 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.820
 cameras or in the skull to the thief and 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.059
 split it from the skull in 25 million 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.100
 pieces because it's a hard hard piece of 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.380
 camera on top and bottom 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.840
 we are going to meet with the thread 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.070
 standard for a tripod that comes in the 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.079
 box to which we can simply 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.750
 screw in this way we turn 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.550
 institute of we finished screwing and 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.410
 once you get to the end of 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.020
 the thread we simply adjust by 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.250
 this ring that is here to finish 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.050
 to do pressure and make it look good 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.270
 adjusted of course this tripod is 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.469
 adjusted by a sphere which also 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.420
 we have to adjust here and we can 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.039
 move it freely so you can adjust the 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.690
 just once we choose the 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.690
 position we simply adjust with 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.640
 strength and desire 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.290
 is going to move a little bit if we fight with 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.600
 the hand but if we support it to the camera 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.860
 if banking perfectly fine and for 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.690
 Of course we have some holes here 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.610
 able to look at the wall to the ceiling 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.890
 let's have a desire for now we're going to 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.260
 remove this so we continue with a 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.180
 ease to be able to handle it in what 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.560
 regards the analysis and while we go 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.660
 seeing that in the back we 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.950
 we found with the thread to be able 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:30.380
 connect the wifi antenna that simply 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.120
 the curls moss the following way there 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.770
 there is the thread and of course the 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.180
 we are going to address it is not necessary 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.170
 unscrew the to address the 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.820
 just the address we like 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.980
 we really want to contain it 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.780
 directly like that up already is more 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.460
 that enough in general we are going to 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.650
 take it out we want a reset button 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.880
 to erase all the options that are going to 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.740
 be inside the camera which 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.030
 let's talk in a few minutes and 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.310
 then finally we have something very 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.800
 important and key to keep in mind that 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.000
 they are the ethernet network connector and 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.770
 then also the connector 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.300
 feeding because good because the 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.800
 feeding is done through a 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.860
 transformer a source directly it 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.510
 connects the transformer like this and then 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.300
 of course this to an outlet in 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:10.070
 the wall and then the network cable there 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.690
 that connect it only for what it is 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.670
 the setup or to start it 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.740
 what are they going to do they are going to look for in the play 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.120
 store the xxvi over watch application and it 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.950
 they will go down it is completely by 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.660
 supposedly free and they will find it 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.890
 easily if you look for it with that name 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.690
 then we connect the source of 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.070
 power to the camera and then 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.800
 we open the application and we will ask 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:30.050
 that we connect good the network cable to 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.640
 the camera and then finally to a 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.070
 router that this one of course connected to 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.930
 internet this is only for the 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.220
 initial configuration and it's good that 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.990
 be this way or that is not what it is 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.950
 cumbersome is simply a matter of 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:41.900
 safety because if not anyone 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.490
 could access the camera and ready in 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.990
 not really or the idea is that it's 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.700
 configured with our network of our 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:48.380
 house then having all this with 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.670
 connected in this way if as 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.380
 we see and of course to find 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.770
 logically connected outlet and 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.240
 having internet we are going to configure the 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:59.450
 camera that is an off of simply 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:01.580
 follow the steps are two pavadas and 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.350
 after that it is already simply we take the 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.850
 network cable of the camera and this 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:08.060
 basically it serves us for nothing ever 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:09.530
 more or directly is unused 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.030
 unfortunately it is all something that is not 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.950
 I liked it because you can not remove it very 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.360
 delighted you could get out like that is not 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.670
 this hanging space in which can enter 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.990
 water or bugs or whatever but after 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.910
 directly works with wifi 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:22.190
 and they can calmly disconnect the 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.570
 source of the camera and plug it into another 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.310
 side and will raise the same network 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:27.560
 automatically say do not have to 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:28.610
 reconnect the router to be able to 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.470
 reconfigure the network not 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.900
 simply by connecting it the first 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:35.300
 then it connects automatically and 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.800
 that of course is very very comfortable 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.630
 finally on the front of this 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.790
 the most important thing are two things 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.860
 first of course the sensor cameras 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.870
 with the lens that is not a wide-angle 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.580
 therefore it does not deform the image 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.830
 still has a good field of vision is 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:51.020
 say is not that you have a zoom applied 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:52.820
 fixed factory and then also 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:54.470
 we have the infrared LEDs because 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:57.530
 because we can use the camera from 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.760
 night say without external light as it 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.680
 they activate good basically we have 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.150
 a photocell that once it's done 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.650
 of night in low light or 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.120
 also if they want to try it they can put 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.860
 the hand forward to cover all the light 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.620
 the infrared LEDs are going to be activated 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:11.240
 automatic way does not make it hot or 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.040
 that overheats in no time 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.870
 that was good and the time they have a 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.760
 cute scope is to say not necessarily 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.620
 there has to be a subject half a meter 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.270
 to be able to illuminate what really illuminates 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.430
 quite the whole scenario where is 

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:24.110
 put the camera so they are pretty 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.710
 effective do not necessarily have to 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.050
 use it 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:29.810
 that is, they can use software in 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.039
 pc to be able to use this camera and 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.590
 to be able to visualize what is 

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:36.110
 watching and can see up to 8 cameras in 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:38.090
 simultaneous that is 8 cameras connected to 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.710
 the same router with the software that 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.240
 You can search the displayed page 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:42.770
 if they look for other specialized software and 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.229
 if you can not see even more but with that 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.910
 software up to 8 still so in my case I 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:49.550
 it is much easier and more useful 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.479
 use the application of the over bots 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.740
 because the wta that connected is 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:53.840
 simply one off we touch on the 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.610
 plus symbol and let's see what we have 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.680
 four options and if links martins with 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:58.880
 killer code and the search land the latest 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.410
 two are the most important and most 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.180
 simple because one directly looks at 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:04.039
 the wifi network and we can enter it 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:05.660
 we can simply put a password 

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:07.099
 that is to say we have some security not 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:08.750
 anyone can enter our 

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:11.570
 camera because why are we going to put a 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:13.340
 password for each of the cameras and 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:15.259
 good in this search wifi money is 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:17.389
 we directly scan the qr code or 

00:05:15.259 --> 00:05:19.099
 be we got off the camera we have a 

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:20.449
 sticker with the qr code just what 

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:22.370
 we scan and you're really 

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:23.930
 connect it is a pavada 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:26.449
 the camera records in three resolutions 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:28.160
 low medium and high high definition 

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:30.080
 would be 720 p and the truth that the 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:32.000
 image quality is very good 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.889
 especially considering that 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.630
 refresh rate of the image is 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:37.160
 quite high that is to say it is quite 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:38.810
 fluid when we have people or things 

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.280
 moving I'll leave an example in 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:41.510
 this moment has seen directly from 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:44.830
 application through two 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:44.830
 devices in simultaneous 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:51.889
 t 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:00.700
 as you will see the camera I liked it a lot 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:02.440
 beyond that the camera itself or the 

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:05.080
 body is very well built is 

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:07.090
 well designed the connection is super super 

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:08.620
 simple through the application and also 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:09.700
 a first time with the router I thought that 

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:11.260
 it was going to be much more cumbersome and in 

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:11.980
 reality it was a stupid thing that I did it in 

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.600
 three minutes 

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:15.550
 so if you plan to use it 

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:17.380
 for security or home for your 

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:19.780
 room or for your whole house ie 

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:22.150
 for more than one camera it really is a 

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:23.020
 very very good option if they want 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:24.640
 use it for a little more 

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:26.560
 specific or maybe a scope 

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:28.600
 business could also serve them 

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:30.130
 calmly depending on 

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:32.020
 of course what your goals are but 

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:33.730
 in my opinion it is a very good camera and 

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:34.630
 pp to take into account of course if 

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:36.490
 they want to do something a little more 

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:37.990
 specific how to take a photo or record 

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:38.919
 the video that you are watching from the 

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:40.750
 application can do it directly 

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:43.720
 from the application and also by 

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:45.340
 course if they connect a physical recorder 

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:47.470
 to record everything that is 

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:49.060
 plugged in and watching all the cameras what 

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:50.710
 they will be able to do but that escapes a 

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:51.940
 little bit the scope of this video 

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:53.290
 so tell me low in the comments 

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:54.880
 What do you think if you buy it? 

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:57.310
 if they were looking for an ip camera or if 

00:06:54.880 --> 00:07:00.270
 they had never seen a sonic film it 

00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:03.980
 and see you in future videos 

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:03.980
 and another one that was not subscribed 

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:10.139
 vote 

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:12.590
 to 

00:07:10.139 --> 00:07:12.590
 we go 

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:19.830
 it's worth more 

00:07:20.849 --> 00:07:25.390
 no no 

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:25.390
 I
