00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
iphone kits used a lot and so this app

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.420 
iphone kits used a lot and so this app
was<00:00:39.540> kind<00:00:39.809> of<00:00:39.899> nice<00:00:40.050> for<00:00:40.110> me<00:00:40.530> to<00:00:40.649> install<00:00:41.100> and

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
was kind of nice for me to install and

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.420 
was kind of nice for me to install and
you<00:00:41.940> just<00:00:42.090> hit<00:00:42.300> start<00:00:42.719> and<00:00:42.989> you<00:00:43.079> run<00:00:43.440> this<00:00:44.129> and

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
you just hit start and you run this and

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.979 
you just hit start and you run this and
it<00:00:44.550> runs<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.910> test<00:00:45.149> on<00:00:45.390> your<00:00:45.510> app<00:00:45.690> basically

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
it runs the test on your app basically

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.810 
it runs the test on your app basically
checking<00:00:46.620> its<00:00:46.739> performance<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.460> make<00:00:47.640> sure

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
checking its performance to make sure

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.260 
checking its performance to make sure
that<00:00:48.000> your<00:00:48.120> app<00:00:48.329> or<00:00:48.870> your<00:00:49.230> phone<00:00:49.500> is<00:00:49.739> meeting

that's<00:01:27.150> cool<00:01:27.420> um<00:01:28.670> you<00:01:29.670> know<00:01:29.790> for<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.090> average

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
that's cool um you know for the average

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.319 
that's cool um you know for the average
user<00:01:30.479> person<00:01:31.439> uh<00:01:31.670> probably<00:01:32.670> doesn't<00:01:33.090> have<00:01:33.180> any

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
user person uh probably doesn't have any

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.050 
user person uh probably doesn't have any
idea<00:01:33.689> what<00:01:33.930> a.m<00:01:34.380> flop<00:01:34.920> is<00:01:35.189> or<00:01:35.430> whatever<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:35.970> I

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
idea what a.m flop is or whatever and I

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.580 
idea what a.m flop is or whatever and I
guess<00:01:36.240> it<00:01:36.390> doesn't<00:01:36.540> really<00:01:36.659> matter<00:01:37.020> it's<00:01:37.320> just

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
guess it doesn't really matter it's just

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.730 
guess it doesn't really matter it's just
a<00:01:37.710> unit<00:01:38.549> so<00:01:39.030> if<00:01:39.900> you're<00:01:40.049> operating<00:01:40.439> within

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
a unit so if you're operating within

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.060 
a unit so if you're operating within
normal<00:01:40.890> ranges<00:01:41.579> that's<00:01:41.820> good<00:01:42.770> there<00:01:43.770> aren't

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
normal ranges that's good there aren't

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.399 
normal ranges that's good there aren't
anything<00:01:44.460> else<00:01:44.909> there<00:01:45.450> there<00:01:45.899> isn't<00:01:46.200> anything

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
anything else there there isn't anything

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.039 
anything else there there isn't anything
else<00:01:46.740> that<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.070> app<00:01:47.220> does<00:01:47.640> as<00:01:48.060> far<00:01:48.720> as<00:01:48.750> that

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
else that the app does as far as that

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.700 
else that the app does as far as that
goes<00:01:49.460> and<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.640> user<00:01:50.850> interface<00:01:51.180> is<00:01:51.840> is<00:01:52.170> kind

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
goes and the user interface is is kind

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.550 
goes and the user interface is is kind
of<00:01:52.860> flat<00:01:53.729> I<00:01:54.030> mean<00:01:54.210> it's<00:01:54.360> it's<00:01:54.750> not<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.409> best

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
of flat I mean it's it's not the best

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.740 
of flat I mean it's it's not the best
graphics<00:01:56.280> or<00:01:56.460> anything<00:01:56.850> I<00:01:57.000> think<00:01:57.240> for<00:01:57.450> an<00:01:57.570> app

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
graphics or anything I think for an app

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.580
