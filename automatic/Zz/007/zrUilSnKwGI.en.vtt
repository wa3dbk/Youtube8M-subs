a few different features about the t2i

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.150 
a few different features about the t2i
one<00:00:17.820> of<00:00:17.940> them<00:00:18.060> was<00:00:18.359> how<00:00:18.840> to<00:00:18.900> adjust<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.890> iris

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
level the other one was the ISO and then

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.599 
level the other one was the ISO and then
the<00:00:24.779> shutter<00:00:25.109> speed<00:00:25.410> so<00:00:25.680> right<00:00:26.400> now<00:00:26.550> the

the shutter speed so right now the

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.359 
the shutter speed so right now the
camera<00:00:27.090> is<00:00:27.269> in<00:00:27.330> a<00:00:27.810> manual<00:00:28.609> picture<00:00:29.609> mode<00:00:29.820> and

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510 
we are going to be using the AV button

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:43.040 
we are going to be using the AV button
that<00:00:36.510> we<00:00:36.630> see<00:00:36.870> right<00:00:37.079> up<00:00:37.260> there<00:00:40.280> and<00:00:42.050> we're

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
that we see right up there and we're

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.779 
that we see right up there and we're
going<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.200> be<00:00:43.320> using<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.860> shutter<00:00:44.190> wheel<00:00:44.489> up

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
going to be using the shutter wheel up

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.860 
going to be using the shutter wheel up
top<00:00:45.180> on<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.899> top<00:00:46.140> part<00:00:46.440> of<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.590> camera<00:00:47.870> so

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
top on the top part of the camera so

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.479 
top on the top part of the camera so
what<00:00:49.020> we<00:00:49.140> do<00:00:49.350> in<00:00:50.100> order<00:00:50.579> to<00:00:50.789> adjust<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:52.489> f-stop

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
what we do in order to adjust the f-stop

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.049 
what we do in order to adjust the f-stop
is<00:00:53.730> you<00:00:54.570> push<00:00:54.899> and<00:00:55.199> hold<00:00:55.559> in<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:56.160> AV<00:00:56.670> button

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
is you push and hold in the AV button

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.180 
is you push and hold in the AV button
and<00:00:57.239> then<00:00:57.719> turn<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.260> wheel<00:00:58.440> on<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.680> top<00:00:58.770> of

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
and then turn the wheel on the top of

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:08.679 
and then turn the wheel on the top of
the<00:00:59.309> camera

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:08.689 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:10.719 

so<00:01:09.259> you<00:01:09.320> can<00:01:09.439> see<00:01:09.590> there<00:01:09.770> that<00:01:09.799> I<00:01:10.039> adjusted<00:01:10.670> the

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729 
so you can see there that I adjusted the

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:14.469 
so you can see there that I adjusted the
is<00:01:11.119> the<00:01:11.630> f-stop<00:01:12.109> and<00:01:12.729> now<00:01:13.729> it's<00:01:13.880> at<00:01:13.999> six<00:01:14.270> point

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
is the f-stop and now it's at six point

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:17.590 
is the f-stop and now it's at six point
three<00:01:14.619> to<00:01:15.619> adjust<00:01:15.979> the<00:01:16.130> ISO<00:01:16.310> you'll<00:01:17.179> press<00:01:17.450> the

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600

three to adjust the ISO you'll press the
ISO<00:01:18.140> button<00:01:18.409> that's<00:01:18.619> on<00:01:18.710> top<00:01:18.979> of<00:01:19.039> the<00:01:19.340> camera

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:19.549 
ISO button that's on top of the camera

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:34.340 
ISO button that's on top of the camera
and<00:01:20.020> turn<00:01:21.020> the<00:01:21.229> wheel

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.920 

and<00:01:35.350> to<00:01:36.280> adjust<00:01:36.640> the<00:01:36.760> shutter<00:01:37.030> you'll<00:01:37.750> just

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.850 

so<00:01:48.130> if<00:01:48.250> I<00:01:48.340> was<00:01:48.490> shooting<00:01:48.909> a<00:01:49.030> picture<00:01:49.469> where<00:01:50.469> I

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
so if I was shooting a picture where I

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.520 
so if I was shooting a picture where I
had<00:01:51.490> a<00:01:51.520> lot<00:01:51.729> of<00:01:51.759> light<00:01:52.000> already<00:01:52.240> this<00:01:52.719> might<00:01:53.409> be

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
had a lot of light already this might be

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.100 
had a lot of light already this might be
what<00:01:53.680> I<00:01:53.710> would<00:01:53.799> shoot<00:01:54.070> at<00:01:54.509> 150th<00:01:55.509> of<00:01:55.659> a<00:01:55.750> second

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
what I would shoot at 150th of a second

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.529 
what I would shoot at 150th of a second
shutter<00:01:56.259> speed<00:01:56.820> somewhere<00:01:57.820> around<00:01:57.880> six<00:01:58.329> point

00:01:58.529 --> 00:01:58.539 
shutter speed somewhere around six point

00:01:58.539 --> 00:01:59.999 
shutter speed somewhere around six point
three<00:01:58.659> if<00:01:58.929> I<00:01:58.990> was<00:01:59.140> trying<00:01:59.320> to<00:01:59.350> get<00:01:59.469> it<00:01:59.590> exposed

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
three if I was trying to get it exposed

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:05.520 
three if I was trying to get it exposed
in<00:02:00.429> a<00:02:01.500> fairly<00:02:02.500> lit<00:02:02.829> area<00:02:03.929> if<00:02:04.929> I<00:02:05.079> needed<00:02:05.319> more

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
in a fairly lit area if I needed more

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.499 
in a fairly lit area if I needed more
light<00:02:05.770> I<00:02:05.799> would<00:02:05.950> I<00:02:06.100> address<00:02:06.399> my<00:02:06.579> my<00:02:06.970> f-stop

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509 
light I would I address my my f-stop

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:12.300 
light I would I address my my f-stop
down<00:02:07.810> and<00:02:08.489> ISO<00:02:09.489> 100<00:02:10.440> gives<00:02:11.440> you<00:02:11.620> the<00:02:11.769> cleanest

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
down and ISO 100 gives you the cleanest

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.000 
down and ISO 100 gives you the cleanest
picture<00:02:12.670> you<00:02:12.790> can<00:02:12.940> get<00:02:13.180> the<00:02:14.049> higher<00:02:14.349> up<00:02:14.650> you<00:02:14.680> go
