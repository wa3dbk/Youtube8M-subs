00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
an entire plane you know when we first

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.300 
an entire plane you know when we first
were<00:04:36.810> hearing<00:04:37.080> reports<00:04:37.169> of<00:04:37.470> the<00:04:37.590> a<00:04:37.830> lot<00:04:38.069> of<00:04:38.220> us

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
were hearing reports of the a lot of us

were hearing reports of the a lot of us
thought<00:04:38.490> that<00:04:38.550> this<00:04:38.970> plane<00:04:39.270> had<00:04:39.569> a<00:04:39.870> number<00:04:40.380> of

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.410 
thought that this plane had a number of

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
people on it a number of civilian we

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.219 
people on it a number of civilian we
thought<00:04:42.330> this<00:04:42.479> perhaps<00:04:42.810> might<00:04:42.990> have<00:04:43.110> been<00:04:43.199> a

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:43.229 
thought this perhaps might have been a

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:44.600 
thought this perhaps might have been a

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
civilian craft but as we're learning

civilian craft but as we're learning
from<00:04:44.789> math<00:04:45.030> you<00:04:45.210> know<00:04:45.360> a<00:04:45.389> government<00:04:45.930> a

craft<00:04:49.380> we<00:04:49.500> got<00:04:49.650> much<00:04:49.770> more<00:04:49.949> on<00:04:50.069> this<00:04:50.160> coming<00:04:50.310> up

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
craft we got much more on this coming up

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.129 
craft we got much more on this coming up
20<00:04:50.819> years<00:04:51.030> old<00:04:51.240> obviously<00:04:51.479> needed<00:04:51.990> to<00:04:52.080> be

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:52.139 
20 years old obviously needed to be

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:54.890 
20 years old obviously needed to be
replaced<00:04:52.380> hopefully<00:04:53.099> something<00:04:54.060> else<00:04:54.330> coming

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
replaced hopefully something else coming

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.160 
replaced hopefully something else coming
