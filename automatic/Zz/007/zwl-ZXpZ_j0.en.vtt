00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
computer I don't suggest doing this just

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.499 
computer I don't suggest doing this just
because<00:02:01.619> a<00:02:02.189> lot<00:02:02.640> of<00:02:02.670> times<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.180> internal

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
because a lot of times the internal

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.450 
because a lot of times the internal
microphones<00:02:03.960> on<00:02:04.170> computers<00:02:04.920> are<00:02:05.070> not<00:02:05.250> that

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
microphones on computers are not that

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.100 
microphones on computers are not that
great<00:02:05.700> they're<00:02:06.210> not<00:02:06.329> as<00:02:06.509> good<00:02:06.659> as<00:02:06.780> something

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
great they're not as good as something

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.190 
great they're not as good as something
like<00:02:07.350> a<00:02:07.380> blue<00:02:07.710> Yeti

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
like a blue Yeti

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.139 
like a blue Yeti
or<00:02:08.679> a<00:02:08.709> blue<00:02:09.099> snowball<00:02:09.369> and<00:02:09.729> of<00:02:09.819> course<00:02:10.030> not

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
or a blue snowball and of course not

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:12.150 
or a blue snowball and of course not
everybody<00:02:10.420> can<00:02:10.629> afford<00:02:10.690> those<00:02:11.230> so<00:02:11.680> therefore

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
everybody can afford those so therefore

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.580 
everybody can afford those so therefore

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:25.589 
make a commentary then you can go ahead
and<00:02:23.890> use<00:02:24.280> the<00:02:24.459> internal<00:02:24.760> microphone<00:02:25.000> on<00:02:25.420> your

and use the internal microphone on your

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:27.059 
and use the internal microphone on your
computer<00:02:25.989> and<00:02:26.019> it<00:02:26.200> will<00:02:26.319> work<00:02:26.470> just<00:02:26.680> fine<00:02:26.800> it

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
computer and it will work just fine it

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:28.740 
computer and it will work just fine it
won't<00:02:27.220> sound<00:02:27.430> is<00:02:27.640> good<00:02:27.819> but<00:02:28.150> it<00:02:28.330> will<00:02:28.480> work

your commentary you can also do

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:01.620 
your commentary you can also do
automatically<00:02:59.530> reduce<00:02:59.980> game<00:03:00.370> sound<00:03:00.760> and<00:03:01.030> what

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
automatically reduce game sound and what

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.960 
automatically reduce game sound and what
this<00:03:01.780> does<00:03:01.840> is<00:03:02.410> if<00:03:02.680> you<00:03:02.829> click<00:03:03.099> this<00:03:03.370> it<00:03:03.849> will

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
this does is if you click this it will

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.150 
this does is if you click this it will
actually<00:03:04.150> reduce<00:03:04.450> the<00:03:05.079> game<00:03:05.290> sound<00:03:05.680> even

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
actually reduce the game sound even

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.890 
actually reduce the game sound even
lower<00:03:06.340> than<00:03:06.459> what<00:03:06.880> you<00:03:07.030> have<00:03:07.180> it<00:03:07.269> set<00:03:07.299> up<00:03:07.599> here

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
lower than what you have it set up here

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.530 
lower than what you have it set up here
so<00:03:08.170> that<00:03:08.380> it's<00:03:09.370> pretty<00:03:09.610> much<00:03:09.790> just<00:03:09.849> your<00:03:10.510> voice

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
so that it's pretty much just your voice

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.539 
so that it's pretty much just your voice
and<00:03:10.989> the<00:03:11.079> gameplay<00:03:11.500> is<00:03:11.680> just<00:03:11.980> barely

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:12.549 
and the gameplay is just barely

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:14.849 
and the gameplay is just barely
noticeable<00:03:13.090> the<00:03:13.299> background<00:03:13.720> I<00:03:13.930> don't<00:03:14.620> use

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:14.859 
noticeable the background I don't use

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:16.710 
noticeable the background I don't use
this<00:03:15.069> now<00:03:15.340> I<00:03:15.370> used<00:03:15.819> to<00:03:16.000> when<00:03:16.150> I<00:03:16.180> first<00:03:16.269> started

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
this now I used to when I first started

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.960 
this now I used to when I first started

and I would have my game audio too high

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:25.500 
and I would have my game audio too high
and<00:03:24.639> then<00:03:24.730> you<00:03:24.790> would<00:03:24.880> hear<00:03:24.970> the<00:03:25.060> game<00:03:25.209> audio

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
that i did a tutorial and that they were

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:08.789 
that i did a tutorial and that they were
not<00:04:07.389> making<00:04:07.810> sure<00:04:07.959> this<00:04:08.139> was<00:04:08.319> clicked<00:04:08.620> and

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:08.799 
not making sure this was clicked and

not making sure this was clicked and
highlighted<00:04:09.370> and<00:04:09.519> therefore<00:04:10.329> they<00:04:10.450> were

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
highlighted and therefore they were

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.150
