North<00:00:38.700> Dakota<00:00:39.020> these<00:00:40.020> are<00:00:40.320> fairly<00:00:40.950> difficult

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
North Dakota these are fairly difficult

North Dakota these are fairly difficult
to<00:00:42.270> address<00:00:42.930> in<00:00:43.469> wintertime<00:00:44.219> so<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:44.489> lot<00:00:44.640> of

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
to address in wintertime so a lot of

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.150 
to address in wintertime so a lot of
this<00:00:44.789> work<00:00:44.910> is<00:00:45.120> done<00:00:45.329> during<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.780> summertime

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.160 
this work is done during the summertime

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.360 
this work is done during the summertime
so<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.670> Castagna<00:00:48.559> system<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.800> sulfur<00:00:50.309> II

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.689 
der 201 coating can be deployed both in
a<00:00:55.110> shop<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:55.620> as<00:00:55.800> you<00:00:55.920> see<00:00:56.100> here<00:00:56.340> open<00:00:56.610> the

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
a shop and as you see here open the

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.450 
a shop and as you see here open the
field<00:00:57.030> at<00:00:57.480> these<00:00:58.140> cool<00:00:58.739> temperatures<00:00:59.309> so

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
field at these cool temperatures so

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.279 
field at these cool temperatures so
basically<00:00:59.670> becomes<00:00:59.969> a<00:01:00.059> year-round<00:01:00.329> business

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
basically becomes a year-round business

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.910 
basically becomes a year-round business
for<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:02.010> applicators<00:01:02.690> in<00:01:03.690> this<00:01:03.899> case<00:01:04.170> the

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
for the applicators in this case the

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.340 
for the applicators in this case the
tank<00:01:05.159> was<00:01:05.460> prepared<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:06.330> sandblasted<00:01:07.170> which

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
tank was prepared and sandblasted which

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.800 
tank was prepared and sandblasted which
takes<00:01:07.650> about<00:01:08.159> a<00:01:08.310> day<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.610> steam-clean<00:01:09.330> an<00:01:09.659> old

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
takes about a day to steam-clean an old

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.270 
takes about a day to steam-clean an old
tank<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:10.320> then<00:01:10.409> blasted<00:01:10.830> out<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.130> the

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
tank and then blasted out and the

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.300 
tank and then blasted out and the
surface<00:01:12.090> is<00:01:12.240> very<00:01:12.270> rough<00:01:12.510> and<00:01:13.140> and<00:01:13.350> once

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
surface is very rough and and once

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.210 
surface is very rough and and once
that's<00:01:14.490> done<00:01:14.729> you<00:01:15.570> know<00:01:15.720> our<00:01:15.780> our<00:01:16.650> technician

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
that's done you know our our technician

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.310 
that's done you know our our technician
or<00:01:17.490> or<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.210> applicator<00:01:18.659> just<00:01:18.840> goes<00:01:18.990> in<00:01:19.170> and

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
or or the applicator just goes in and

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.060 
or or the applicator just goes in and
coats<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:19.920> it's<00:01:20.159> done<00:01:20.610> within<00:01:20.909> about<00:01:21.830> 30<00:01:22.830> to

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
coats and it's done within about 30 to

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.249 
coats and it's done within about 30 to
40<00:01:23.610> minutes<00:01:23.640> on<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.270> tank<00:01:24.570> of<00:01:24.780> this<00:01:24.990> size

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
40 minutes on the tank of this size

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.560 
40 minutes on the tank of this size
which<00:01:26.100> is<00:01:26.310> what<00:01:26.820> you<00:01:26.909> would<00:01:27.000> expect<00:01:27.299> for<00:01:27.509> a

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
which is what you would expect for a

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.289 
which is what you would expect for a
normal<00:01:27.869> coating<00:01:28.759> application<00:01:29.759> but<00:01:30.090> the

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
normal coating application but the

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.370 
normal coating application but the
difference<00:01:31.020> is<00:01:31.500> that<00:01:31.890> rather<00:01:32.520> than<00:01:32.790> waiting

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
difference is that rather than waiting

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.499 
difference is that rather than waiting
you<00:01:34.380> know<00:01:34.470> days<00:01:34.770> with<00:01:35.130> expensive<00:01:35.909> heating<00:01:36.299> to

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
you know days with expensive heating to

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.060 
you know days with expensive heating to
bring<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.869> tanks<00:01:37.200> up<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.409> temperature<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:38.040> a

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
bring the tanks up to temperature to a

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.370 
bring the tanks up to temperature to a
cure<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.460> coating<00:01:38.850> is<00:01:39.000> we<00:01:39.869> just<00:01:40.049> leave<00:01:40.200> them

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
cure the coating is we just leave them

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.719 
cure the coating is we just leave them
at<00:01:40.470> ambient<00:01:40.799> and<00:01:41.009> then<00:01:41.130> we're<00:01:41.280> able<00:01:41.400> to<00:01:41.579> come
