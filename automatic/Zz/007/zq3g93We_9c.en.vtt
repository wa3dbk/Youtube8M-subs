00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
won't have to

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.850

won't<00:02:10.510> have<00:02:10.630> to<00:02:10.750> separate<00:02:11.080> separate<00:02:11.620> out<00:02:11.740> the

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
won't have to separate separate out the

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.110 
won't have to separate separate out the
decks<00:02:12.070> like<00:02:12.250> you<00:02:12.400> would<00:02:12.550> have<00:02:12.760> if<00:02:12.910> you<00:02:13.060> are

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
decks like you would have if you are

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.750 
decks like you would have if you are
using<00:02:13.480> two<00:02:13.920> two<00:02:14.920> decks<00:02:15.130> from<00:02:15.280> the<00:02:15.370> base<00:02:15.520> game

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
using two two decks from the base game

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.300 
using two two decks from the base game
so<00:02:16.600> there<00:02:16.750> we<00:02:16.840> have<00:02:16.960> it<00:02:16.990> the<00:02:17.290> two<00:02:18.010> decks<00:02:18.220> of

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
so there we have it the two decks of

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.620 
so there we have it the two decks of
cards<00:02:18.370> and<00:02:19.260> last<00:02:20.260> but<00:02:20.440> not<00:02:20.560> least<00:02:20.800> we<00:02:21.040> have

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
eight new dice eight more dice for the

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.310 
eight new dice eight more dice for the
game<00:02:24.490> so<00:02:24.910> they'll<00:02:25.360> obviously<00:02:25.480> come<00:02:25.930> in<00:02:26.050> handy

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
game so they'll obviously come in handy

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.770
