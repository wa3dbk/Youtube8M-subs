tip number one watch drivers heads and

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:39.429 
tip number one watch drivers heads and
mirrors<00:01:36.950> that's<00:01:37.460> pretty<00:01:37.640> basic<00:01:38.320> you<00:01:39.320> know

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:39.439 
mirrors that's pretty basic you know

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:40.779 
mirrors that's pretty basic you know
just<00:01:39.649> watching<00:01:39.979> the<00:01:40.070> head<00:01:40.250> movements<00:01:40.729> of

00:01:40.779 --> 00:01:40.789 
just watching the head movements of

just watching the head movements of
drivers<00:01:41.270> so<00:01:41.479> their<00:01:41.630> windows<00:01:41.930> and<00:01:42.109> mirrors

drivers so their windows and mirrors

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.660 
drivers so their windows and mirrors
that's<00:01:42.590> an<00:01:42.680> excellent<00:01:42.920> way<00:01:43.189> to<00:01:43.219> anticipate

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
that's an excellent way to anticipate

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.550 
that's an excellent way to anticipate
you<00:01:44.359> no<00:01:44.450> sudden<00:01:44.780> moves<00:01:44.930> that<00:01:45.020> they<00:01:45.140> might<00:01:45.320> make

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
you no sudden moves that they might make

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.889 
you no sudden moves that they might make
but<00:01:46.280> most<00:01:46.700> drivers<00:01:46.909> they<00:01:47.240> won't<00:01:47.420> lunge<00:01:47.600> left

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899 
but most drivers they won't lunge left

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:49.419 
but most drivers they won't lunge left
or<00:01:48.109> right<00:01:48.289> without<00:01:48.469> first<00:01:48.890> moving<00:01:49.310> their

00:01:49.419 --> 00:01:49.429 
or right without first moving their

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:52.779 
or right without first moving their
heads<00:01:49.670> one<00:01:50.299> way<00:01:50.509> or<00:01:50.630> another<00:01:50.950> so<00:01:51.950> even<00:01:52.640> if<00:01:52.700> they

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:52.789 
heads one way or another so even if they

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:55.300 
heads one way or another so even if they
don't<00:01:52.880> check<00:01:53.060> the<00:01:53.210> moves<00:01:53.619> so<00:01:54.619> trust<00:01:55.039> your

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
don't check the moves so trust your

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:56.950 
don't check the moves so trust your
mirrors<00:01:55.640> like<00:01:55.880> your<00:01:56.060> bike<00:01:56.240> notice<00:01:56.600> but<00:01:56.719> not

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.430 

tip<00:02:40.400> number<00:02:40.550> three<00:02:40.940> never<00:02:41.870> get<00:02:42.140> between<00:02:42.230> a

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
tip number three never get between a

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.700 
tip number three never get between a
vehicle<00:02:42.950> and<00:02:43.100> an<00:02:43.340> off<00:02:43.430> ramp<00:02:43.700> oh<00:02:44.530> it's<00:02:45.530> pretty

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:45.710 
vehicle and an off ramp oh it's pretty

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.100 
vehicle and an off ramp oh it's pretty
basic<00:02:45.890> you<00:02:46.250> know<00:02:46.340> it's<00:02:46.430> pretty<00:02:46.580> obvious

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
basic you know it's pretty obvious

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.890 
basic you know it's pretty obvious
almost<00:02:48.110> sounds<00:02:48.380> too<00:02:48.410> simple<00:02:49.100> but<00:02:49.570> the<00:02:50.570> drivers

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
almost sounds too simple but the drivers

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.210 
almost sounds too simple but the drivers
who<00:02:50.990> decide<00:02:51.230> to<00:02:51.260> exit<00:02:51.620> at<00:02:51.710> the<00:02:51.740> last<00:02:51.950> minute

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
who decide to exit at the last minute

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.710 
who decide to exit at the last minute
they<00:02:52.400> killed<00:02:52.670> plenty<00:02:52.850> of<00:02:53.120> riders<00:02:53.390> each<00:02:53.510> year

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
they killed plenty of riders each year

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.930 
they killed plenty of riders each year
so<00:02:54.110> the<00:02:54.350> simple<00:02:54.710> rule<00:02:54.860> is<00:02:55.100> just<00:02:55.670> too<00:02:55.760> narrow

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
so the simple rule is just too narrow

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.550 
so the simple rule is just too narrow
position<00:02:56.360> yourself<00:02:56.690> between<00:02:56.840> a<00:02:56.990> vehicle<00:02:57.440> and

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
position yourself between a vehicle and

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.130 
position yourself between a vehicle and
the<00:02:57.950> off-ramp<00:02:58.600> passing<00:02:59.600> on<00:02:59.690> the<00:02:59.750> right<00:02:59.780> is

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
the off-ramp passing on the right is

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.670 
the off-ramp passing on the right is
generally<00:03:00.550> just<00:03:01.550> and<00:03:02.050> big<00:03:03.050> known<00:03:03.230> as<00:03:03.380> I<00:03:03.410> don't

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
generally just and big known as I don't

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.700 
generally just and big known as I don't
do<00:03:03.800> it<00:03:05.110> sometimes<00:03:06.110> you<00:03:06.170> have<00:03:06.260> to<00:03:06.350> do<00:03:06.470> it<00:03:06.590> just

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
say so do it between cross streets next

bike because you put the brake on if
it's<00:05:31.039> a<00:05:31.100> rear<00:05:31.280> brake<00:05:31.550> which<00:05:31.729> are<00:05:31.850> really<00:05:32.150> light

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:32.419 
it's a rear brake which are really light

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:34.480 
it's a rear brake which are really light
that<00:05:32.930> log<00:05:33.050> feels<00:05:33.289> so<00:05:33.470> quick<00:05:33.770> if<00:05:33.890> you<00:05:34.010> can<00:05:34.250> apply

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:34.490 
that log feels so quick if you can apply

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:38.130 
that log feels so quick if you can apply
too<00:05:34.610> much<00:05:34.820> over<00:05:35.419> gravel

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:38.140 

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:41.550 

also<00:05:39.140> unifying<00:05:39.650> our<00:05:39.800> writing<00:05:40.280> in<00:05:40.370> open<00:05:40.730> areas

also unifying our writing in open areas

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.080 
also unifying our writing in open areas
so<00:05:42.560> wherever<00:05:43.040> this<00:05:43.220> you<00:05:43.520> know<00:05:43.640> get<00:05:43.820> away<00:05:43.910> from

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:44.090 
so wherever this you know get away from

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:48.270 
so wherever this you know get away from
all<00:05:44.360> the<00:05:44.570> other<00:05:44.690> classes<00:05:44.990> you<00:05:45.080> can<00:05:45.290> in<00:05:45.560> traffic

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:52.430 
and grouping of vehicles you know always

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:53.800 
and grouping of vehicles you know always
there's<00:05:52.640> always<00:05:52.730> some<00:05:53.000> gap<00:05:53.210> so<00:05:53.390> find<00:05:53.630> these

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:53.810 
there's always some gap so find these

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:56.470 
there's always some gap so find these
and<00:05:54.050> try<00:05:54.350> writing<00:05:54.740> them<00:05:54.890> and<00:05:55.150> doing<00:05:56.150> so<00:05:56.360> will

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:56.480 
and try writing them and doing so will

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:00.610 
and try writing them and doing so will
separate<00:05:56.780> you<00:05:56.870> two<00:05:56.900> gether<00:05:57.200> ship<00:05:58.540> can't<00:05:59.620> use

separate you two gether ship can't use
your<00:06:00.770> thumb<00:06:01.010> so<00:06:03.790> make<00:06:04.790> sure<00:06:04.820> basically<00:06:05.420> just

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:05.510

make sure you put your thumb ready for
those<00:06:07.070> ok<00:06:07.940> cancel<00:06:08.660> on<00:06:08.840> your<00:06:08.960> turn<00:06:09.140> signals<00:06:14.920> so

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:15.920 
those ok cancel on your turn signals so

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:24.280 
those ok cancel on your turn signals so
yeah<00:06:16.130> so<00:06:16.400> make<00:06:16.550> sure<00:06:16.580> you<00:06:16.760> do<00:06:16.850> that<00:06:22.570> always<00:06:23.570> try

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.520 
you bike is light yeah yeah they'll fall
down<00:06:37.310> but<00:06:37.820> it's<00:06:38.090> like<00:06:38.450> a<00:06:38.660> marrow<00:06:38.960> so<00:06:39.260> you<00:06:39.380> can

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:39.530 
down but it's like a marrow so you can

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:41.200 
down but it's like a marrow so you can
get<00:06:39.650> your<00:06:39.710> gaps<00:06:40.070> and<00:06:40.700> that's<00:06:40.910> one<00:06:41.060> of<00:06:41.090> the

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:41.210 
get your gaps and that's one of the

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:44.680 
get your gaps and that's one of the
strengths<00:06:41.630> so<00:06:42.290> if<00:06:42.410> it's<00:06:42.590> good<00:06:42.770> i<00:06:42.800> mean<00:06:43.690> make

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:44.690 
strengths so if it's good i mean make

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:47.020 
strengths so if it's good i mean make
sure<00:06:44.930> that<00:06:45.080> you<00:06:45.170> know<00:06:45.320> you<00:06:45.380> can<00:06:45.850> find<00:06:46.850> another
