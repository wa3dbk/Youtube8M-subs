00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 suitable for winter 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.700
 thq releases new gameplay scenes 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.589
 to company of heroes 2 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.360
 the us on the cold east front of the 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.099
 second world war sends on 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.420
 basic gameplay changes 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.070
 not much in part two 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.379
 We still carry with you 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.570
 manageable number of soldiers or 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.970
 armor very tactical battles for the 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.130
 dominance in certain sectors 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.439
 the extremely cold climate of the east front 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.970
 Permitted developer relic but a few 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.250
 nice innovations to install 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.960
 For example, we should be our soldiers 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.160
 not on long walks through 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.110
 send deep snow 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.540
 especially not when just one 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.040
 blizzard rages otherwise freeze the 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.840
 namely one after the other 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.140
 the first one has already caught here 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.420
 a second new game element is ice 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.850
 over a frozen river or lake 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.410
 driving is certainly faster than me 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.980
 first the way over the bridge free to 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.750
 fight 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.670
 however, a well placed 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.989
 artillery hits the ice below the 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.230
 Break groups 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.920
 radio tank the water freezes by the way 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.960
 back to when a snowstorm erupts 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:06.360
 only snow and ice and cold experience the 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.680
 company of heroes 2 but not always 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.400
 Again, it also gets into battles 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.080
 something colors foren battlefields what 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.479
 we see it sounds like in 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.939
 Strategy playing is customary from the sight radius 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.500
 our troups off in company of heroes 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.720
 2 block but also houses and 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.520
 other obstacles our view that 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.189
 should for even more tactical depth 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.200
 make an official list of new ones 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.310
 Vehicles and units have relic though 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.170
 not published yet 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.659
 One thing is very easy 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.000
 make out the infamous stalin 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.920
 Organ of the soviets one fierce 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.740
 rocket showers let go of the enemy 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.630
 against opponents on ice is likely the 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.250
 cause true miracles 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.979
 even if it is not too much too 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.320
 see what we know so far and what 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:53.450
 Relic for company of heroes 2 promises 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.450
 makes you want to the final version 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.200
 want
