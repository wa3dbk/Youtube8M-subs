00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.570 
some light scratches then we can go
around<00:02:05.969> the<00:02:06.090> edge<00:02:06.240> here<00:02:06.689> and<00:02:07.619> again<00:02:08.310> maybe

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
around the edge here and again maybe

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.760 
around the edge here and again maybe
some<00:02:08.910> light<00:02:09.119> scratches<00:02:09.390> but<00:02:09.959> with<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.379> yellow

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
some light scratches but with the yellow

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.979 
some light scratches but with the yellow
and<00:02:10.800> they<00:02:11.069> don't<00:02:11.310> show<00:02:11.610> up<00:02:11.640> at<00:02:12.000> all

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
and they don't show up at all

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:16.080 
and they don't show up at all
so<00:02:13.989> it<00:02:14.170> probably<00:02:14.500> is<00:02:14.980> very<00:02:15.280> hard<00:02:15.579> to<00:02:15.640> see<00:02:15.879> them

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.589
