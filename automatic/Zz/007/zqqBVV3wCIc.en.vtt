00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:13.420
 Welcome to a round full 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:17.029
 there and wanted to time minecraft 1905 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:21.319
 last time from me so from mine 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:25.640
 page from my page is like 

00:00:21.319 --> 00:00:28.729
 said so and everyone under it we demand 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:33.010
 hope that we will be longer this time 

00:00:28.729 --> 00:00:36.800
 survive if you won exactly those 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:40.610
 I also had extremely cool star 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.140
 somehow this apple knows nine empty 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.990
 I should be so for a short time 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.730
 moment you get the double heart 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:48.770
 so above it a new bar that 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.520
 means you have 20 hearts maximum oh so 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.860
 hot 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.170
 no matter everything right that right 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.430
 In any case, if we are in such a way 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.280
 In any case, opponents run away 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:02.000
 or so or the whole try though 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.890
 to the ball something like that but yes 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.939
 otherwise it sometimes works here sometimes 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:14.899
 I have so far but I think so 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:18.319
 armor or what I have armor 

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:19.819
 to chain so half iron he half chains 

00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:23.560
 I really do not need it this time 

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:23.560
 good stuff yes my phone is clean 

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:36.859
 sure yes if you need what I need 

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:41.179
 I have iron tops and old pants 

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:43.399
 I also am okay full armor 

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:44.600
 I have and do you have it hard or 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:47.389
 very difficult 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.259
 I almost have the app again 

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:49.909
 Perfect 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:51.799
 I can not do it again 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:56.029
 So again, where is one? 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:59.450
 champion title in the sand be ok and 

00:01:56.029 --> 00:02:02.010
 cabbage leaves are playing again today 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:11.709
 the last 1 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:14.290
 Escalator 1 Conclusion 2 and now 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:16.800
 I need to be back here thought 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:24.819
 right now there is luckily none 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:28.720
 understands that we return like that 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:29.459
 that already cleaned not the club 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.989
 throw 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:35.140
 I would be in favor of the club, of course 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:38.410
 from 16 that's why I say that too 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.190
 snowbearth he breaks what he knows 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.000
 still like 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:46.209
 yes yes yes already okay well it must 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.670
 watch this trick 2 20 seconds 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:49.989
 I still have you by chance 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.690
 something expanded 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:54.550
 haye just did not give me value 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.050
 Hey hey, you have anything besides that 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:03:00.480
 Comparison with the already other type of 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.480
 I had nothing not there 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:12.209
 perfect i hold the path i had mine 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:12.209
 helps us, it's good must do it 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:24.660
 then look if the way is with the 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.660
 effect 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.310
 which means that means yours 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.590
 blood on now is the father has the 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.730
 bandage your blood for a short time 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:49.620
 stops when a blood test is 0 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:53.120
 I really do have it automatically 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:56.990
 one of us full on us from the back like that 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:58.910
 and he's behind you 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:01.080
 dark 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:03.120
 Attention comair briefly come to her me 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.800
 I have the teacher at ok otherwise 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.930
 I would have preferred to throw now 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:10.620
 the more my blood is still on 99 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.820
 percent airlines at 98 so that should be 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.280
 we still manage what I have anyway 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:15.000
 so here's our blood dying on the 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.709
 or is gone 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.020
 I do not know what a team is or 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.520
 not no idea, well, are only 

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:23.160
 two that is if it is then one 

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:24.000
 probably two team then yes 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:29.520
 two against two 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:33.630
 i dont know what i am from you i am 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:49.190
 But I do not want to go okay 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:49.190
 get well 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:07.099
 he is still alive 

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:09.340
 yes you are just yet I come 

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:12.319
 to you what you are here 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:15.219
 why is only one yes because I the 

00:05:12.319 --> 00:05:18.139
 Guiding others with the snowball 

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:19.789
 is invisible running hopeless running 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:22.960
 diamond as you can to make similar 

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:27.349
 because he could have you ok with that go 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:31.219
 shoot your video now visible 

00:05:27.349 --> 00:05:34.759
 again you have both diamonds because 

00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:35.629
 I can not see any of them and I hope 

00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:40.150
 In any case I'm not too quiet 

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:40.150
 if or should not really 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:06:14.580
 I was wanted and gave away 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:14.580
 now here the others I 'm the hole 

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:23.199
 thrown away 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:26.080
 yes she can without him 

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:28.779
 actually quite good sender so clean 

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:30.279
 okay we do televised or yes 

00:06:28.779 --> 00:06:31.870
 If I were good then you are full again 

00:06:30.279 --> 00:06:34.120
 or something like that in two sentences 

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:35.229
 yes well then we'll wait for you soon 

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:37.300
 I think I'll win anyway 

00:06:35.229 --> 00:06:45.839
 because I just have something off and that 

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:49.930
 ok is okay okay okay i'm ready 

00:06:45.839 --> 00:07:21.719
 So with items going on I'll go okay 

00:06:49.930 --> 00:07:28.629
 can i get it running or yahoo 

00:07:21.719 --> 00:07:30.909

00:07:33.009 --> 00:07:36.430
